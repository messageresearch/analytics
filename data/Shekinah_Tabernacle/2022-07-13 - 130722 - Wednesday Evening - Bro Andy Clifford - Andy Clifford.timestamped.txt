[30:18] is definitely here amen amen glory to
[30:21] god thank you musicians
[30:23] we can uh i won't put that there where's
[30:25] that hook gone
[30:30] hallelujah
[30:32] um
[30:33] who knows can someone please josh can
[30:35] you just stick that clip back on
[30:37] we're all uh getting tangled up here
[30:40] amen who's ready to worship jesus
[30:42] hallelujah
[30:44] amen
[30:46] while you're standing let's turn in our
[30:47] bibles
[30:49] to
[30:51] mark chapter six
[30:54] and it's an honor as always and a
[30:56] privilege to be standing here
[30:58] uh before the purchase of the blood of
[31:00] jesus
[31:01] giving um
[31:03] honor to brother ben pastor
[31:06] and thanking ben for the opportunity
[31:08] and the confidence
[31:10] amen and also we have a little
[31:12] celebration for tomorrow his name is
[31:15] jono hey man how are you going to be
[31:17] jono
[31:18] 12 am happy birthday bro
[31:21] amen hallelujah
[31:23] amen well let's just read amen i want to
[31:26] speak i just you know um want to
[31:29] continue on that series we begin and
[31:31] this is part two of that two tree series
[31:33] and it's called the revelation of the
[31:35] tree of life at the darkest hour
[31:38] amen and so i just want to read now from
[31:41] mark chapter six from verses 45 to 52
[31:46] and
[31:47] the context of this reading
[31:50] is going see we want to just
[31:52] put sign some light on what it means
[31:55] when we go off on an intellectual whim
[31:58] or without jesus and our own idea our
[32:00] ambition how fitting the song was you
[32:02] know we want to surrender those things
[32:04] to the lord and and lay it all down
[32:06] because
[32:06] we can end up where the disciples ended
[32:09] up on the ship when they went without
[32:11] jesus
[32:12] amen so when you go without jesus it may
[32:15] be all right for a little while but you
[32:17] wait
[32:18] trouble is on the way
[32:21] absolutely every time no matter what you
[32:23] can't escape it travel is on the way
[32:26] amen and the
[32:28] the reality of that is when in context
[32:31] with this particular series is you begin
[32:34] eating from the tree of knowledge of
[32:36] good and evil and you leave off the tree
[32:39] of life
[32:40] amen
[32:41] and you put your faith in your own
[32:42] ambitions and intellectualism and it
[32:45] will take you into trouble
[32:47] it may take a while but it will get
[32:48] there
[32:49] amen hallelujah so let's just read mark
[32:53] 6 45 to 52 and it says and straightway
[32:56] he constrained his disciples to get into
[32:59] the ship and to go to the other side
[33:02] before unto bethsaida
[33:05] amen while he sent away the people
[33:08] and i just want you to pay significant
[33:10] attention particular attention to these
[33:12] verses because every word and line in
[33:16] this story in this uh
[33:20] transcript of history has got meaning
[33:22] very very personal meaning so and when
[33:26] he had sent them away he departed into a
[33:28] mountain to pray
[33:30] and when even evening was come the ship
[33:33] was in the midst of the sea and he alone
[33:36] on the land
[33:37] all right so they ventured off without
[33:39] him
[33:40] hallelujah and he saw them toiling in
[33:44] and rowing
[33:45] see he he he sees don't worry he sees
[33:49] for the wind was contrary unto them and
[33:52] about the fourth watch of the night the
[33:54] darkest hour he came cometh unto them
[33:57] walking upon the sea
[33:59] and would have passed by them
[34:02] all right that's okay
[34:04] we can strain him tonight okay
[34:06] hallelujah you say come lord jesus
[34:08] hallelujah amen you he's looking you
[34:11] know might you might not speak it with
[34:12] your lips but with your heart he's he
[34:15] can feel that desire in your life come
[34:18] lord jesus amen hallelujah let me read
[34:22] so you can sit down and enjoy the
[34:23] comfort of your seats while i stand
[34:27] i like that brother and bob thank you
[34:28] very much amen okay so and the fourth
[34:31] watch passed by them but when they saw
[34:33] him walking upon the sea they supposed
[34:36] it had been a spirit and cried out
[34:39] my
[34:40] how many times we've seen that for they
[34:42] all saw him and were troubled
[34:46] and immediately i love that immediately
[34:49] he talked with them hallelujah and said
[34:51] unto them be of good chair it is i be
[34:54] not afraid
[34:55] and he went up unto them into the ship
[34:58] and the wind ceased and they were so
[35:00] amazed in themselves beyond measure i
[35:03] like that and wondered hallelujah and in
[35:06] the in matthew it says and they
[35:08] worshipped him
[35:09] so you can see now oh hold on let me
[35:12] just read this
[35:13] for they considered not the miracle of
[35:15] the loaves for their heart was hardened
[35:18] amen may the lord add his blessing to
[35:19] the reading of his word you may be
[35:21] seated
[35:22] hallelujah
[35:23] amen
[35:28] hallelujah
[35:31] see they had temporarily
[35:33] lost the vision of where they came from
[35:36] they went through some trials they went
[35:38] through a hardship and in that and
[35:40] getting immersed in that with their
[35:42] focus off
[35:44] the very source of their strength
[35:46] they lost their vision
[35:48] they became hardened in their heart
[35:50] their heart was unmalleable in that
[35:53] condition and therefore they lost their
[35:55] vision of what had just happened you see
[35:58] they just come from a mighty revival
[36:01] they had come from a revival where the
[36:03] son of man
[36:05] was creating bread and fish
[36:08] and feeding thousands of people a
[36:10] miracle of epic proportions
[36:13] amen yeah
[36:14] hallelujah they had temporary lost their
[36:16] vision but god
[36:18] i love this because it never ends like
[36:20] that it never ends you just sitting in a
[36:22] dark place sometimes we end up in a
[36:24] place where we lose our vision sometimes
[36:26] we end up in a situation where we cannot
[36:29] see the wood for the trees and we go
[36:31] through things in life and trials may
[36:33] beat us down until we can't see
[36:36] but god rich in mercy will not let you
[36:39] remain in that condition hallelujah
[36:42] whether it's you whether it's a church
[36:44] whether it's an age whether it's a
[36:46] family whether it's a dispensation
[36:48] whatever it may be
[36:50] the lord will not leave his people
[36:52] sitting in darkness great light will
[36:55] come to the people to change the
[36:57] situation amen hallelujah i'll make you
[37:00] guys a deal if you paul i will preach
[37:03] amen i want you to apply your faith
[37:05] every one of you and pull amen and then
[37:07] you'll get what you need is everyone
[37:09] hungry tonight does everyone need a
[37:11] blessing tonight amen i encourage you
[37:13] now just pull amen i encourage you to
[37:15] say lord whatever that need is in your
[37:17] life you make it known to him i want you
[37:19] to touch the hem of his garment
[37:21] hallelujah because you see the revival
[37:23] that these people came into they went
[37:25] from a revival they went from a mighty
[37:28] revival and then they ventured for a
[37:30] while into the dark of the night in
[37:32] their own strength in their own ability
[37:35] and they were without jesus
[37:37] and all the trouble began but you see
[37:39] jesus would then come and he would go
[37:41] from where he was at and he would he
[37:43] would go and he would begin to enact
[37:45] redemption he would go and he would say
[37:48] you know what these people are getting
[37:49] into a dark condition they might be
[37:51] getting into a dark place in their lives
[37:53] they might be going through the hardest
[37:54] trial the sea the demons of the sea
[37:56] would swear that they would drown these
[37:58] people but you see now jesus saw it and
[38:02] jesus sees what you're going through
[38:04] jesus sees the struggles that you go
[38:06] through in your life has anyone been
[38:08] delivered in this place
[38:10] hallelujah so then you are in the story
[38:12] tonight amen we're just establishing a
[38:15] few little ground roots here hallelujah
[38:18] the churches were constantly struggling
[38:20] now on a church level over the last 2000
[38:22] years with intellectual giants
[38:25] you see the human being is always
[38:27] wanting to revert to his mind
[38:29] it's a natural
[38:32] what i don't even know what the word is
[38:33] aversion no that's the opposite to that
[38:35] but it's like an inclination to go into
[38:38] that intellectual realm and begin to do
[38:40] it in your own strength but christianity
[38:42] is not based on our intellect
[38:45] christianity is not based on our ability
[38:48] christianity is entirely based on rest
[38:54] entirely and utterly and completely
[38:57] based on rest
[38:59] so that he can operate
[39:01] hallelujah so that he can express his
[39:03] attributes so that he can say i am the
[39:06] savior i'm the redeemer i'm the one that
[39:08] wants to work in your life so that you
[39:10] can love me more
[39:12] he wants you to love him more so he
[39:14] wants you to see that side of him
[39:17] so rest little bride
[39:19] rest amen see the churches though and us
[39:23] in ourselves personal and on a church
[39:25] level con struggled for many years with
[39:27] intellectual giants
[39:29] waves tossing them under the vice of
[39:32] science and educated faith
[39:34] you see many times if you see over the
[39:36] church history they would rise up there
[39:39] would be a revival and god would move in
[39:41] them and then within a couple of
[39:43] generations it was intellectual again
[39:45] within a couple of generations because
[39:47] they were scared of losing what they had
[39:49] or what their founder had and they begin
[39:50] to intellectualize it and they begin to
[39:52] write books around it and they begin a
[39:54] church government around it and then
[39:55] they start the whole conduct order and
[39:57] doctrine and it make a denomination
[40:00] and then it goes to seed
[40:02] then it's no longer able to reproduce
[40:08] until you see now this church
[40:11] not this church but the the age
[40:14] they came and they went they adventured
[40:16] you know there was jesus and he was
[40:18] doing these great things and and and and
[40:21] the church just begin to get go united
[40:23] says in ephesians that they were aimed
[40:25] at but they relaxed and and they they
[40:28] had the deeds of the nicolaitans and
[40:29] they begin to go down and and they begin
[40:32] to walk without him
[40:34] in general there was always a witness
[40:36] but there was and as a general move it
[40:38] began to go down and they begin to
[40:40] venture into the sea without him
[40:42] hallelujah over the last 2000 years it
[40:44] got worse and worse and worse until one
[40:46] day hallelujah one day he came amen and
[40:50] he said be not afraid it is i and he
[40:52] spoke it through a little kentucky and
[40:54] amen
[40:55] he came and he revealed himself and said
[40:57] be not afraid of his eye i'm going to
[40:59] reveal myself to you in a full measure
[41:02] again
[41:03] amen
[41:04] you're going to have a nice contact with
[41:07] me
[41:08] more than more than ever before amen
[41:11] because i'm going to give you something
[41:13] that's going to make you live forever
[41:16] i'm going to let you eat of something
[41:18] that you will never die amen the very
[41:21] essence of what adam and eve walked away
[41:23] from when they left the garden of eden
[41:25] is what is being given back to the
[41:27] church
[41:30] hallelujah
[41:31] amen
[41:32] and so it says here
[41:34] a message came at the darkest hour of
[41:37] laodicea saying be not afraid it is i
[41:41] however the believers of this very
[41:43] message have also battled against
[41:45] similar patterns so here we have now i'm
[41:47] just going to lay like a few so that you
[41:49] can know with the context of where we're
[41:50] going and so you have now god raises up
[41:53] a mighty prophet and he takes the people
[41:56] out of all of the false teachings and
[41:58] consolidates everything together so that
[42:00] we have a true message and and and
[42:02] reveals the truth and the conduct and
[42:04] everything and begins to take the people
[42:06] out of denominational thinking out of
[42:09] the roman catholic tiebacks all of those
[42:11] doctrines and everything that tied the
[42:13] people back into rome tied those
[42:16] churches back to roman teaching and he
[42:18] would take the people he would
[42:19] consolidate truth again and he would
[42:21] begin to shine that light on the people
[42:23] and the people would gather around this
[42:25] prophet the seventh angel amen and and
[42:28] they would begin to gather and they
[42:29] would begin to walk with him and god
[42:32] would say to this prophet william
[42:33] branham now turn northward and take my
[42:36] people out of the wilderness take them
[42:38] out of this pentecostal denominational
[42:40] wilderness take them out of what this
[42:42] man's age and take them into the bright
[42:45] age take them out and take them into the
[42:47] promised land take them from all this
[42:50] thinking of man and bring them in to the
[42:53] field of promise
[42:54] bring them to the true baptism of the
[42:56] holy ghost amen so under luther martin
[42:59] luther you have justification the start
[43:02] of the reformation the people were freed
[43:04] and released from the slavery of the
[43:06] superstitions of rome and then under
[43:09] john wesley later on they begin to clean
[43:11] up the people's lives under
[43:12] sanctification amen and so he sanctified
[43:15] the church and then later on he began to
[43:18] reveal the gifts again under the
[43:20] pentecostal outpouring of 1904 around
[43:24] that age and allowed to see an age begin
[43:26] and he began to pour out a spirit upon
[43:28] them to what to reveal the gifts of the
[43:31] spirit and so then you have
[43:33] justification
[43:34] sanctification
[43:36] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:39] those three ingredients restored to the
[43:41] church and then he sends a messenger
[43:43] elijah the prophet to bring those things
[43:46] together to reveal the holy ghost
[43:48] himself
[43:49] take the people out of the wilderness
[43:52] out of the denominational darkness out
[43:54] of egyptian slave mentality you see when
[43:56] they came out of egypt they came out of
[43:58] rome they still had roman thinking
[44:01] do you know that
[44:03] the church denomination nominal still
[44:06] had roman thinking they were still very
[44:08] much chained down to a roman way of life
[44:10] and they started that slave mentality
[44:12] but for many years they were hit by that
[44:14] task master and their teachers were hit
[44:16] by that slave master of rome and those
[44:18] different doctrines and those different
[44:20] teachings and that way
[44:22] that wasn't the true way but a prophet
[44:25] was given to bring us out of that to
[44:27] bring the church out of that and so what
[44:30] happened was he brought them out amen
[44:32] hallelujah he obeyed the heavenly vision
[44:35] he was not disobedient to the heavenly
[44:37] vision he stood up against councils and
[44:39] councils of
[44:40] great ministers all international bodies
[44:43] and none of them could refute it
[44:45] none of them could stand up with him and
[44:47] even say one word against it
[44:50] they couldn't
[44:51] and he challenged them and you can hear
[44:53] it on the tapes he actually in those
[44:55] meetings
[44:56] and he did not bat down and god proved
[44:58] his word for this was not done in the
[45:00] back room this was like as lightning
[45:02] goes from the east to the west over the
[45:04] whole earth as a witness that god was
[45:07] taking his people into a higher
[45:09] revelation of himself
[45:11] to take luther's message of truth
[45:14] wesley's message of truth the
[45:16] the restoration of the holy ghost
[45:18] baptism and all of the gifts of the
[45:20] spirit and the supernatural and
[45:22] consolidate it and reveal the true holy
[45:24] ghost himself and so when the church
[45:27] came over jordan came into a death to
[45:30] all those things through jordan came
[45:32] into the promised land lo and behold who
[45:35] comes down but the mighty angel himself
[45:38] the captain of the lord's host comes
[45:40] down with a sword in his hand who knows
[45:42] the story does everyone know the story
[45:45] your children do you know the story does
[45:47] everyone know are you with me
[45:49] i need a drink i'm very dry
[45:56] he comes down
[45:58] into the promised land comes down
[46:00] to reveal i've come to take over
[46:02] amen now a great change takes place
[46:08] a dispensational change begins to shift
[46:11] what is it it's the revelation of the
[46:13] holy ghost himself it's the fullness of
[46:15] god revealed amen and we read in
[46:18] revelation chapter 10 how a mighty angel
[46:21] would come down in the seventh church
[46:23] age and he would come down with what in
[46:25] his hand does anyone know what he had in
[46:27] his hand
[46:30] rebecca
[46:32] well yes he did have a sword in his hand
[46:34] the captain did in the old testament but
[46:36] what did the mighty angel have in his
[46:38] hand
[46:39] in 1963 when he came down
[46:43] uh noel
[46:45] a bible he had an open book in his hand
[46:48] the sword of the spirit was open
[46:50] hallelujah and that's the great
[46:52] difference saints that when he came down
[46:54] in this age he revealing the full
[46:56] inheritance of everything that's been
[46:58] lost since adam
[46:59] that's what the baptism of the holy
[47:01] ghost gives you
[47:02] hallelujah that's what this message has
[47:04] brought us out
[47:06] to receive
[47:08] amen
[47:10] is everyone warm yeah
[47:12] good i'm very warm
[47:14] it's so hot
[47:15] is it summer
[47:18] mate
[47:19] okay
[47:21] see and so but it doesn't stop there
[47:24] because you see the same cycle the same
[47:27] intellectual battle the same nicolaitan
[47:30] spirits that would come upon the church
[47:33] in the beginning of the church ages to
[47:35] make them cold formal intellectual and
[47:37] powerless as the same spirits that would
[47:40] come on people that would follow this
[47:42] message
[47:42] you know that
[47:44] none of us are exempt from that just
[47:46] because you follow the message it
[47:47] doesn't mean that you ain't going to get
[47:48] attacked by those same spirits that's
[47:50] why you have to discern them and that's
[47:51] why tonight i'm here to talk to you
[47:53] about these things
[47:54] so that you can discern these spirits so
[47:57] that you when they try to come on you
[47:58] hey that devil ain't got nothing
[48:01] he won't be able to touch you because
[48:03] you've got discernment because you've
[48:04] been made aware of these things
[48:07] because you see what they are trying to
[48:09] do to you on an individual level is
[48:11] bring you into an intellectual condition
[48:13] to take you to try and do it yourself
[48:16] solve your own problems you know
[48:18] entertain yourself you see we have a big
[48:20] problem as a human and that problem
[48:22] we'll call it a problem for the sake of
[48:23] this as you need entertainment you need
[48:26] joy right we need joy everyone wants to
[48:28] be happy right does anyone in here not
[48:30] want to be happy
[48:31] you can put your hand up
[48:33] anyone does anyone not want to be happy
[48:35] does anyone in here not want to have joy
[48:39] no one everyone wants to have joy right
[48:41] everyone wants to have peace
[48:43] amen so therefore that is the that's a
[48:46] question to humanity and so
[48:48] now
[48:50] the intellectual side of it the feasting
[48:52] from the tree of knowledge the tree of
[48:53] knowledge has got a lot of things that
[48:55] you can do to be happy you know that of
[48:57] good and evil use a lot of good things
[48:59] in the tree of knowledge of good and
[49:01] evil that can give you happiness they
[49:03] can give you joy but you know what
[49:05] there's a lot better things in the tree
[49:07] of life amen that's why in this end time
[49:10] the lord's come to take you completely
[49:13] from the need for joy out of those other
[49:16] things
[49:18] hallelujah
[49:19] and so
[49:20] you can see now how
[49:22] we fight these same spirits these same
[49:24] spirits are going to come against us to
[49:27] try and cause us to solve these problems
[49:30] the problem of having comfort the
[49:32] problem of having money that's a big
[49:35] problem right that's a big problem
[49:37] that's why god said you're the royal
[49:39] seat of abraham and you can live above
[49:40] that you can be the head and not the
[49:42] tail you don't have to be subservient to
[49:44] the economy whether it goes down whether
[49:47] it goes up you don't have to worry you
[49:49] don't have the fear right
[49:51] that problem solved
[49:53] now god says at his right hand as the
[49:55] fullness of joy and there are pleasures
[49:57] forever more does everyone know that
[49:58] psalm 16 there are pleasures forever
[50:01] more and at his right hand there is the
[50:02] fullness of joy amen so there is joy
[50:04] unspeakable and full of glory just from
[50:07] him so he solved that problem but you
[50:09] see when we begin to venture into our
[50:12] own
[50:13] intellectual understanding and ability
[50:15] we begin to venture away now we're in a
[50:18] position where we are vulnerable to
[50:21] anything
[50:22] and so we don't want to be in that
[50:24] position now as people believers of the
[50:27] message after the prophet came and he he
[50:29] took the people into the land and the
[50:31] mighty angel came down with the open
[50:33] book and he began to preach the opening
[50:35] of the seven seals and reveal the
[50:37] inheritance from dan to beersheba the
[50:40] whole promised land all the inheritance
[50:43] and begin to speak and you know within
[50:45] there is your inheritance and you begin
[50:47] to speak the inheritance to the people
[50:49] that would come out under this message
[50:51] and establish the boundaries and
[50:53] establish the borders and begin to
[50:55] to declare it all out for us
[50:57] right you're with me
[51:00] to speak it all out and give it to the
[51:01] people and then lo and behold not many
[51:04] days later the prophet was taken off the
[51:06] scene
[51:06] and then the trouble then the
[51:08] intellectual spirits begin to come in
[51:10] and begin to cause the people just like
[51:12] it did to the jewish people they had a
[51:14] mighty messenger joshua gave them all
[51:16] the land the captain came down and says
[51:18] i'm gonna fight your battles go and take
[51:20] it all and they could have courage and
[51:22] be courageous and follow and turn not to
[51:24] the left or to the right and follow the
[51:26] message of joshua and take all the land
[51:30] take the land
[51:32] take your inheritance all of it from all
[51:34] of jerusalem judah take it
[51:37] benjamin take it
[51:38] right
[51:39] dan take your land
[51:41] did they take it
[51:43] some
[51:45] but what happened
[51:47] it says and and judges now judges one
[51:49] two three around that time it says now
[51:53] the the elders that passed away after
[51:55] joshua then the people to begin to not
[51:57] call on the name of the lord anymore
[51:59] you know they went now they were like
[52:01] well we've got all this land now we've
[52:02] got like this great message and we've
[52:04] got this the great teaching we've got
[52:06] the great doctrines we're the people of
[52:08] the book
[52:09] right
[52:10] oh my so then they begin to venture into
[52:12] their own intellectual ability many
[52:14] many of them they went into their own
[52:16] ways and they they they compromised they
[52:19] begin to make friends with the
[52:20] inhabitants of the land and they begin
[52:22] to marry their wives and and and cross
[52:24] over
[52:25] and god was not happy
[52:27] why because they ventured without
[52:31] the lord
[52:32] they begin to do it in their own
[52:34] ability you know and this is something
[52:36] that we have to be very aware of
[52:38] just because we have a message it
[52:40] doesn't mean that we're not uh you know
[52:42] we that we are
[52:44] completely vulnerable from these same
[52:46] spirits so i just want to encourage you
[52:48] now
[52:49] we're going to get there amen amen we're
[52:51] going to get there
[52:52] hallelujah amen but remember it went to
[52:55] the same pattern the people in this
[52:57] message the the message you could say
[53:00] messaged them
[53:01] now i'm not talking about that true
[53:04] seed that experience and had to battle
[53:06] this and thought through it and with
[53:08] stalwart and they began they had faith
[53:10] right through it your samsons your roots
[53:12] you know they went right through that
[53:13] time of judges they went right through
[53:15] and it was it was they had a glorious
[53:16] time
[53:18] even though all this destruction and
[53:20] darkness was right around them and
[53:21] sometimes they got so far down they just
[53:23] got pushed down but that faith of
[53:25] abraham rose up in men like shamga in
[53:28] the time of judges when benjamin was
[53:30] killing this one
[53:32] and this one was slaying that one and
[53:33] that tribe nearly wiped out benjamin and
[53:35] they cut people up and all those things
[53:37] happened in the message
[53:41] you know that
[53:43] and yet there was sand guards and there
[53:44] was roofs and there was boazers that
[53:46] took the faith
[53:48] hallelujah that took the land that was
[53:50] claiming their inheritance
[53:52] and there's a people
[53:54] throughout the time of this message in
[53:55] the last 40 50 years that it's been
[53:57] since the seals open since the word came
[53:59] forth since the tree of life was
[54:01] revealed to the people
[54:03] since then there's been a people with a
[54:05] true faith there's been a people that
[54:07] have stood fast there's been a people
[54:09] like shamgar that's fought against all
[54:10] the demon powers that's taken land
[54:12] that's taken this message and translated
[54:14] into every language
[54:17] faithful stalwart soldiers right through
[54:20] it and yet there's all these false
[54:22] things and legalism and intellectualism
[54:25] and and this one going that way and this
[54:27] one going that way this church dying
[54:29] this pastor falling away this one doing
[54:31] that that one doing that these ones all
[54:33] the way in the millennium are gone
[54:35] and then you have a new earth probably
[54:37] already these ones still in the old
[54:39] testament
[54:40] why because of intellectual
[54:42] they ventured
[54:44] after a great revival of bread and fish
[54:46] when there was creation brother brown
[54:48] said
[54:49] what did he do to those atoms you know
[54:52] how he he created cooked fish
[54:55] and cooked bread he just released those
[54:57] atoms
[54:58] what you see they they there was a great
[55:00] revival
[55:01] and and once that revival and then they
[55:03] went out into the sea
[55:05] and they were all right you know it was
[55:06] all good for a while until they got into
[55:08] the dark of the night
[55:09] amen you don't want to ever
[55:12] ever
[55:13] venture without christ
[55:15] don't ever venture
[55:17] without him
[55:18] because the sea is dark
[55:20] the sea is rough
[55:22] amen
[55:23] and if you do
[55:24] it's not the end
[55:26] hallelujah
[55:28] because he will come
[55:41] revelation 2 7 that says here this was
[55:43] meant to be an opening scripture but it
[55:45] didn't quite get that but um the first
[55:47] um so it says revelation 27 it says he
[55:49] that has an ear let him hear what the
[55:51] spirit sayeth unto the churches to him
[55:53] that overcometh will i give to eat of
[55:56] the tree of life
[55:58] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[55:59] god
[56:00] hallelujah
[56:02] you see
[56:03] and through all the ages of the churches
[56:05] they did eat of it in
[56:08] in part they they got a portion of it
[56:11] because they will be raised up and they
[56:13] will live forever but now in this age
[56:16] that tree is being materialized
[56:18] into this dimension to cause these
[56:21] bodies to never die
[56:23] exactly the thing that adam was not
[56:25] allowed to touch
[56:27] that's what that open book comes to
[56:29] reveal right that's what the baptism of
[56:31] the holy ghost in the end time with the
[56:32] open book you know it's not a close book

[57:25] too deep we don't want to go into those
[57:26] things it's just too messaging don't

[57:43] the prophet you know because you see now
[57:46] that coming
[57:47] of of the fullness of the holy ghost
[57:49] himself comes down into your heart that
[57:52] is the beginning of the lord's coming
[57:53] right the coming of the lord begins in
[57:55] your heart
[57:57] this is significant it's not just
[57:58] another anointing you're not just
[58:00] justified now you're not just sanctified
[58:03] anymore you're more than that
[58:05] you're not just got gifts
[58:07] that's what these other churches have in
[58:08] the old other ages now that was what
[58:10] they got and that was the light that god
[58:12] was giving so they were justified
[58:14] sanctified and whatever they got in that
[58:16] that was the holy spirit to them but to
[58:18] you
[58:19] it is given to know all and to receive
[58:22] all
[58:24] the lord and so thank you lord that
[58:27] very thing that which i've just said
[58:29] is
[58:31] the very picture where you were found
[58:34] one day floating on the sea
[58:37] rocked around by the storms of life in
[58:39] your darkest hour
[58:41] and here he comes
[58:43] walking on the water he was watching you
[58:45] all that time from his mountain top
[58:47] watching you and then one day then one
[58:50] day
[58:51] someone told me of your mercy
[58:54] oh
[58:55] amen
[58:56] hallelujah and through those words he
[58:58] came
[58:59] and he stepped out of the bible he
[59:01] stepped out of history and he said here
[59:04] i am
[59:05] you know he says be not afraid
[59:08] be courageous
[59:10] because this is a very fearful time
[59:13] but you're not to be feared you're not
[59:15] to be afraid
[59:16] you'll to be courageous
[59:18] the demons that try and trouble you and
[59:20] try and keep you and try and push you
[59:22] down
[59:22] are everywhere and all around but be
[59:25] courageous
[59:26] because behold
[59:28] it is i jesus and he steps out of
[59:31] history out of an idea
[59:33] out of being just some form of religion
[59:36] and a person reveals himself to you
[59:39] hallelujah and what happens praise the
[59:41] lord
[59:42] what happens from there oh my we'll get
[59:45] there
[59:46] another revival takes place
[59:49] you know that
[59:50] they went from revival
[59:52] creation whatever you want to call it
[59:55] revival
[59:57] to storm
[59:58] to revival
[1:00:00] and that revival now we're going to just
[1:00:02] we're going to relish in that this this
[1:00:04] next revival we are relishing in it but
[1:00:07] i'm going to preach it to you
[1:00:09] hallelujah and then you're going to
[1:00:10] respond by let by praying and laying
[1:00:14] your people and your is it prayer night
[1:00:16] tonight
[1:00:17] or is it just service you're going to
[1:00:19] lay your people
[1:00:21] like what they did at the guinness eric
[1:00:22] lake
[1:00:23] i'm getting way ahead of myself
[1:00:26] but you're going to lay your people
[1:00:27] you're going to lay your needs and the
[1:00:29] needs of your people wherever they may
[1:00:30] be at whatever region they may be in
[1:00:33] whatever your need is
[1:00:35] you will touch the hem of his garment
[1:00:37] tonight
[1:00:40] so remember this promise now because
[1:00:43] what what what it is
[1:00:45] justin you know i'm just being very
[1:00:46] frank here
[1:00:48] is it's the tree of life
[1:00:50] the tree of life has been revealed
[1:00:53] in this dimension
[1:00:55] for you to eat
[1:00:57] spiritually but it will manifest in your
[1:01:00] flesh
[1:01:01] because he says i'm the vine and you're
[1:01:03] the branches
[1:01:04] and so now what if the holy ghost is
[1:01:07] holding nothing back and the book is
[1:01:09] open and all the thunders have been
[1:01:10] released and all the mysteries and
[1:01:12] everything has been opened and it's all
[1:01:13] been revealed to you and and not now i
[1:01:15] don't say you have to know everything
[1:01:17] right i'm talking about it it just comes
[1:01:18] inside you yeah it's in you whether you
[1:01:21] understand everything or not it's in you
[1:01:23] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:25] and then you yield to him and you
[1:01:27] consecrate your life and you begin to
[1:01:28] love him
[1:01:29] and i mean really love him with felio
[1:01:31] anagapo
[1:01:32] not just some love that's way up here
[1:01:35] somewhere but i mean you really fond
[1:01:37] who's fond of jesus
[1:01:39] who's good when you think of him do you
[1:01:41] get physically do you feel physical love
[1:01:45] because i believe he wants to bring you
[1:01:46] to that
[1:01:48] so you're friends
[1:01:51] then you yield and then all of a sudden
[1:01:52] you begin to become fruitful what are
[1:01:54] you a branch to that same tree
[1:01:56] now the tree of life becomes manifested
[1:01:58] in this world
[1:02:00] it's becoming flesh again
[1:02:02] so now there's seed inside your fruit
[1:02:04] that people eat amen
[1:02:07] and tonight
[1:02:08] by faith we can touch the hem of his
[1:02:10] garment
[1:02:11] and give out that seed word and fruit
[1:02:14] you know you can just we've got such
[1:02:16] authority right
[1:02:19] in the spiritual realm
[1:02:21] you know and and and you know maybe the
[1:02:22] storms of life you're busy you go
[1:02:24] through lots of things and the mind
[1:02:26] battles are strong whatever we all go
[1:02:28] through those things right you're not
[1:02:30] alone
[1:02:31] we all go through them right but you
[1:02:32] have discernment because you see
[1:02:34] authority without discernment is useless
[1:02:37] i've said that every time i think i
[1:02:39] preach but just that you cannot have
[1:02:42] there's no point in having authority if
[1:02:43] you can't discern good and evil and know
[1:02:45] that that's a demon troubling you or a
[1:02:47] demon troubling your brother that's
[1:02:48] making you upset and and you realize
[1:02:50] that it's the devil because once you
[1:02:52] discern it and you know who it is that's
[1:02:54] causing that and it ain't your brother
[1:02:55] and it ain't your sister and it ain't
[1:02:57] your friends it's the devil and that's
[1:02:59] when you begin to pray with targeted
[1:03:02] faith
[1:03:03] to destroy the enemy
[1:03:05] and make him regret ever giving you that
[1:03:07] mind battle
[1:03:09] this is war yes my lord
[1:03:12] i have to do it i'm inciting you to war
[1:03:16] and i believe the lord is inciting you
[1:03:17] to war
[1:03:18] hallelujah the bar has gone out the roof
[1:03:22] ben preached it
[1:03:23] that's in season man that's such a
[1:03:25] powerful thought
[1:03:27] that this war
[1:03:28] you don't just give you know the devil
[1:03:31] was always trying to you know when jesus
[1:03:33] came to the maniac of gadara he was
[1:03:35] trying to reason the devil was scared
[1:03:37] because you know if he gets cast out
[1:03:38] into
[1:03:39] somewhere else he can't get back so he
[1:03:41] says get me let me go into this herd of
[1:03:43] swine so they were trying to negotiate
[1:03:45] their casting out don't negotiate the
[1:03:47] devil
[1:03:48] you cast them real good
[1:03:50] you cast them back into hell
[1:03:52] don't just cast them out there cast them
[1:03:54] into hell
[1:03:55] cast them into out of darkness you see
[1:03:56] when jesus cast him he said you cast him
[1:03:58] into out of darkness there's a take it
[1:04:00] tell him where to go and don't just
[1:04:02] leave it there then you begin to wage
[1:04:04] war
[1:04:05] because that guy attacked you what are
[1:04:07] you going to respond or you're just
[1:04:08] going to let him off
[1:04:10] don't let him off you know the troubles
[1:04:12] that people are going through you know
[1:04:14] the people that may be struggling and
[1:04:15] you just say lord i'm now going to pray
[1:04:18] as a retaliation a retaliatory response
[1:04:21] because that devil's going to know
[1:04:24] he's going to know that when he attacks
[1:04:26] me he ain't gonna get no friendly
[1:04:28] warfare back he's gonna get a real war
[1:04:30] back
[1:04:31] and you see then you begin to pray for
[1:04:33] people then you begin to engage in
[1:04:35] warfare then you begin now you see now i
[1:04:38] think i was praying it but this is
[1:04:39] something the lord revealed to me
[1:04:41] because the word has come to you
[1:04:43] the word of god divides soul and spirit
[1:04:45] and joints and marrow and discerns the
[1:04:47] thoughts and intents of the heart right
[1:04:49] it's a very sharp sword that can cut
[1:04:51] through atoms
[1:04:52] the atom is the smallest thing well
[1:04:54] probably nuclear physicists will say
[1:04:56] different but for us the atom is like
[1:04:58] the smallest particle right now the
[1:05:00] sword of the spirit can cut it open
[1:05:02] you know that the sword of the spirit
[1:05:04] can split the atom
[1:05:05] and i'll tell you when jesus comes down
[1:05:07] in the mount of olives after the wedding
[1:05:10] supper after armageddon and and to
[1:05:12] finish finish off the demons and finish
[1:05:14] off the enemy comes down into jerusalem
[1:05:16] and he begins to the fire that proceeds
[1:05:19] out of his mouth dissolves the people
[1:05:21] while they stand the enemies that were
[1:05:23] attacking him and against him and those
[1:05:25] people that were destroying his kingdom
[1:05:27] and the devil's people that were
[1:05:29] fighting directly against god the fire
[1:05:32] that comes out of his mouth dissolves
[1:05:34] them while they stand as describing
[1:05:36] nuclear fire because the word of god is
[1:05:38] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:05:40] two-edged sword so now the word and your
[1:05:44] prayer
[1:05:45] is actually
[1:05:47] nuclear power
[1:05:50] is
[1:05:51] your prayers are nuclear power
[1:05:53] that devil ain't got nothing
[1:05:55] hallelujah he's weak
[1:05:57] he's a bluff
[1:05:58] and when he attacks you he's showing his
[1:06:00] cards
[1:06:02] you know that he's showing his cards he
[1:06:04] goes this is what i'm attacking and he's
[1:06:05] like oh is that all you've got
[1:06:07] i like the is that all you got
[1:06:09] right
[1:06:10] this is war
[1:06:11] don't let them off and do not bargain
[1:06:13] with them
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:16] don't entertain them the moment you
[1:06:18] become aware of what's going on
[1:06:21] deal with it right there
[1:06:22] don't wait till the end of the day go
[1:06:24] down into the toilet at your work go
[1:06:26] down to your office shut the door and
[1:06:27] deal with it
[1:06:28] and if it's real bad just deal with it
[1:06:30] right there
[1:06:32] smack him amen amen
[1:06:34] what happens is you begin now the law
[1:06:36] begins to teach your hands to war
[1:06:39] you need to learn
[1:06:41] and the only way to learn is to do it
[1:06:43] the only way to learn is to face him and
[1:06:45] brother brown says any person that's
[1:06:47] ever mounted to anything in god has had
[1:06:49] to face the devil head on
[1:06:51] if you're not facing the devil head on
[1:06:53] you're not really doing too much damage
[1:06:54] to his kingdom you're kind of just
[1:06:56] drifting around like a log in the ocean
[1:06:59] you know and not really got so much
[1:07:01] you know but but when you begin to
[1:07:03] engage in the war
[1:07:04] and when you see people that are
[1:07:06] struggling and you begin to pray for
[1:07:07] them and you're entering into a burden
[1:07:08] for those people
[1:07:10] as a retaliatory response but also as a
[1:07:12] general love
[1:07:14] because you love people
[1:07:16] if you want to develop your love for
[1:07:17] people more begin praying for them
[1:07:19] pray for people
[1:07:20] enter into their burden
[1:07:22] feel for them that's why i preached that
[1:07:24] sermon the week before because you need
[1:07:26] to be daring enough to love people
[1:07:29] and
[1:07:30] and open your channel of love and feel
[1:07:33] philadelphia love for people and it does
[1:07:36] hurt if you get hurt but it's worth it
[1:07:39] because then when you pray for them and
[1:07:41] when you enter into their burden you can
[1:07:42] feel it
[1:07:43] you know brother branham when he was
[1:07:45] praying for those men with the jacket uh
[1:07:47] you know he couldn't that guy didn't
[1:07:48] have clothes or shoes whatever he just
[1:07:49] had rags and brother brandon felt sorry
[1:07:51] for him he had compassion and and
[1:07:53] through that connection of love that man
[1:07:56] got healed
[1:07:59] it's like when you connect with somebody
[1:08:01] you begin to pray for them it develops
[1:08:03] faith muscles it develops love muscles
[1:08:06] hallelujah
[1:08:07] it develops this connection and they
[1:08:10] might not even know that you're doing it
[1:08:14] and yet you've got this connection with
[1:08:15] them
[1:08:16] and you love them and you begin to grow
[1:08:18] and develop
[1:08:20] hallelujah
[1:08:22] amen and you watch and rejoice your
[1:08:24] heart when you see people change
[1:08:26] and you see them having a revival and
[1:08:28] just to think maybe you had a little
[1:08:30] part to play in that revival
[1:08:32] you know
[1:08:33] and that develops your love
[1:08:35] and then when that person gets attacked
[1:08:36] it's personal ben will know all about
[1:08:38] that
[1:08:40] when he sees anyone in this congregation
[1:08:42] get under attack it's personal hey ben
[1:08:44] real personal
[1:08:46] because they're you love them
[1:08:48] and you care
[1:08:49] and you don't want them to go through
[1:08:50] those things and so the devil gets a
[1:08:52] better hiding
[1:08:54] because when you pray you break through
[1:08:56] and pray you don't just say a little
[1:08:57] prayer oh thank you lord i please pray
[1:08:59] bless us for this and that and um i just
[1:09:01] pray that you'll just heal them and no
[1:09:03] it's more there's a connection there you
[1:09:05] uh you enter into his gates with
[1:09:07] thanksgiving you enter his courts with
[1:09:09] praise and you wait until the spirit of
[1:09:11] god comes and then you pray it's
[1:09:14] different because you care there's
[1:09:16] something different there's something
[1:09:17] with more substance
[1:09:19] hallelujah
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:26] the prophet says this and um only
[1:09:28] believe hallelujah
[1:09:29] i want to challenge you now
[1:09:32] this is a challenge for me a challenge
[1:09:33] for you
[1:09:34] hallelujah says and in time the old
[1:09:37] wheels grind slow but it grinds sure
[1:09:40] it's got to be just the way god said it
[1:09:43] was going to be no matter how unreal it
[1:09:46] seems but it's going to be that way as
[1:09:49] we talked last night
[1:09:51] one time they didn't have electricity
[1:09:53] but some man believed now we're talking
[1:09:55] about tree of knowledge and tree of life
[1:09:56] here because there's a thrust these
[1:09:58] people they want you know if they get
[1:10:00] something in them that has to
[1:10:03] bring forth a fruit to the tree of
[1:10:05] something whether it's tree of life or
[1:10:07] tree of knowledge you get this burden
[1:10:10] right and something's going to be
[1:10:11] birthed
[1:10:12] something that may be minor or major
[1:10:14] monumentous whatever it's got so these
[1:10:16] people over throughout time have had
[1:10:18] these these great burdens and and and
[1:10:20] huge things have come forth from big
[1:10:22] fruit for the different trees okay
[1:10:24] tree of knowledge and tree of life all
[1:10:26] right but some men believed there was
[1:10:29] such a thing
[1:10:31] can you imagine now you children would
[1:10:32] not even think about it and even us they
[1:10:34] didn't used to have electricity
[1:10:36] you couldn't just turn the light on yeah
[1:10:38] but there was somebody that said we can
[1:10:41] harness that thing they got a burden for
[1:10:43] the tree of knowledge
[1:10:46] hallelujah
[1:10:47] and they got such a burden that they
[1:10:49] spent their whole life
[1:10:52] are you with me
[1:10:54] their whole being was was was completely
[1:10:57] caught up
[1:10:58] caught up
[1:10:59] to make this thing to harness this
[1:11:01] lightning that they and electricity
[1:11:03] static they could see and they wanted to
[1:11:05] channel it so that it would bring forth
[1:11:07] something
[1:11:08] how much more now i challenge you
[1:11:11] right how much more the tree of life
[1:11:14] hallelujah amen there's fruit to be born
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] and now it's like you know make your
[1:11:22] calling and election sure
[1:11:25] you know that's one thing it says that
[1:11:26] if you diligently seek this you you
[1:11:28] won't fail or fall
[1:11:31] you know and and because it'll place you
[1:11:33] in your purpose
[1:11:35] it'll place you where god has made you
[1:11:37] for
[1:11:38] so that fruit can come forth
[1:11:40] and he will begin to reveal to you why
[1:11:43] you live
[1:11:44] why you're here
[1:11:46] what are you on this earth for
[1:11:48] can you get down and say lord i want to
[1:11:50] know
[1:11:51] i don't want to just float around or be
[1:11:52] tossed with the waves of the sea like a
[1:11:55] buoyant log
[1:11:57] i want to be anchored
[1:11:59] hallelujah
[1:12:02] says here one time they didn't have
[1:12:04] electricity but some man believed that
[1:12:06] there was such a thing and he kept
[1:12:08] working tireless hours until he
[1:12:10] discovered what it was
[1:12:12] hallelujah
[1:12:14] and the same thing by television by
[1:12:16] automobile and so forth god put all
[1:12:19] these things here for our benefit
[1:12:21] what about the tree of life
[1:12:23] now
[1:12:25] if we who are acquainted with the
[1:12:26] supernatural would just take a man where
[1:12:29] the man in
[1:12:31] his senses is limited to his senses but
[1:12:34] a man in his spirit is unlimited
[1:12:37] so now we're transferring now to a
[1:12:39] different realm
[1:12:41] the tree of knowledge can only climb so
[1:12:43] far and it breaks back
[1:12:46] that's why all these denominations go so
[1:12:48] far then they break back or the
[1:12:50] disciples they go so far and then they
[1:12:52] they're about to drown or you know your
[1:12:54] life you go so far you might just climb
[1:12:57] that tree of knowledge you might become
[1:12:58] a phd you might become a professor but
[1:13:01] if you're walking without christ
[1:13:03] you watch out it will only go so far
[1:13:06] then it will fall back denominations
[1:13:08] they went so far then they fell back
[1:13:10] because they went into an intellectual
[1:13:11] condition
[1:13:12] amen
[1:13:13] but the tree of life goes on hallelujah
[1:13:16] forever and now and now that science
[1:13:19] this is the challenge now i want you to
[1:13:21] listen very carefully and how that
[1:13:24] science has taken man farther with his
[1:13:27] five senses than we have with his soul
[1:13:30] that's the challenge
[1:13:32] now
[1:13:33] these people have had burden after
[1:13:35] burden and you know and they've and then
[1:13:37] fruit has come
[1:13:38] because they found their purpose they
[1:13:40] you know in the tree of knowledge and
[1:13:42] they begin to
[1:13:44] things just develop and look at the hard
[1:13:46] work and the mechanisms and it's just
[1:13:48] like developing until oh who knows
[1:13:49] what's going on out there
[1:13:51] tapping into the very gods laboratory
[1:13:53] the prophet says why because there's
[1:13:55] this desire to imitate
[1:13:58] the tree of life using technology and
[1:14:00] using the intellect that's why you have
[1:14:02] gps it's to replace the guide of the
[1:14:05] holy ghost who's ever been guided by god
[1:14:07] to something
[1:14:09] and he's guided you and you've walked
[1:14:11] and he says go that way and then go that
[1:14:12] way and go that way and then go down and
[1:14:14] pick up this thing
[1:14:17] that's the real gps
[1:14:19] he says i will be your god yes my lord
[1:14:22] amen amen hallelujah
[1:14:26] amen you have these big like cars right
[1:14:30] and you travel in a car and it started
[1:14:32] off about 20 miles per hour 10
[1:14:34] kilometers that way and 10 kilometers an
[1:14:36] hour that way
[1:14:37] right that was as fast as it could go
[1:14:39] but they were traveling at the speed of
[1:14:41] the thought of man
[1:14:43] because that was man's idea that was the
[1:14:44] intellect that was thought and it had
[1:14:46] been pushed into this like car and it
[1:14:49] went that way
[1:14:50] they traveled by thought but it was only
[1:14:52] 10 miles an hour
[1:14:54] and it got wetter and better and better
[1:14:55] and better until they want to travel at
[1:14:57] the speed of light
[1:15:00] i don't think it's very possible i've
[1:15:02] had big discussions about that
[1:15:04] because apparently it's impossible so
[1:15:06] we'll just call it that because actually
[1:15:08] you see the lord travels at the speed of
[1:15:10] light
[1:15:11] amen he says i am
[1:15:14] hallelujah i am the light of the world
[1:15:17] hallelujah but you see now you travel
[1:15:20] and i was i remember just flying in an
[1:15:22] airplane you know you kind of can't
[1:15:24] sleep properly and you're just dozing in
[1:15:25] and out now when i'm like dozing in and
[1:15:27] out my i start thinking strangely like
[1:15:30] i'm like oh what am i what am i doing in
[1:15:33] this cylinder 30 000 feet in the air you
[1:15:35] know i'm thinking this is freaky you
[1:15:37] know what how did i end up here and i
[1:15:39] just say lord you got me here
[1:15:42] i trust you i'm in this like and then i
[1:15:44] start pondering i'm like oh this is
[1:15:46] actually the mind of man
[1:15:48] this is thought and it's been put
[1:15:51] together into this very complicated
[1:15:54] cylinder that's flying 30 000 feet in
[1:15:56] the air and i'm going this is very high
[1:15:58] if anything goes wrong we're going down
[1:16:01] one engine you know and i've had engines
[1:16:03] stop and i think my
[1:16:05] i don't want this engine to stop i'm
[1:16:07] very glad for the aircraft engineer
[1:16:09] because they check it over real good
[1:16:12] so that not many engines stop
[1:16:14] because it's not very nice if it stops
[1:16:15] in the air and when you're going like
[1:16:17] this and it goes
[1:16:18] whoa
[1:16:20] you're praying
[1:16:21] and there's hail mary's going all over
[1:16:23] the place and no man
[1:16:27] because people are scared
[1:16:29] because that is the that is really the
[1:16:31] effort of the tree of knowledge it goes
[1:16:34] so far but then it falls backwards it
[1:16:36] has turbulence
[1:16:38] right
[1:16:39] it has turbulence and it has it has it
[1:16:41] has a
[1:16:42] potential to fail but let me tell you
[1:16:45] one thing if you put all your faith or
[1:16:47] your trust or your yielding in the tree
[1:16:49] of life he will never fail you
[1:16:52] [Music]
[1:16:53] he will never fail you he will never
[1:16:56] leave you nor forsake you he will not
[1:16:58] leave you unfinished
[1:17:00] if anyone feels unfinished today i'm
[1:17:02] sure we can all say yes then just
[1:17:05] remember he will not leave you
[1:17:07] unfinished
[1:17:08] being confident of this very thing that
[1:17:11] he which begun
[1:17:13] a good work in you shall continue it
[1:17:15] unto the day of jesus christ
[1:17:18] that that's comforted me many years
[1:17:21] because sometimes i felt like i was like
[1:17:23] lost and undone or like just completely
[1:17:26] like man i'm failing and but then i
[1:17:28] always had faith
[1:17:29] knowing that he begun something
[1:17:32] he begun something a devil would try and
[1:17:34] howl at me
[1:17:35] you don't believe you don't have faith
[1:17:37] right ever when i was early on and i
[1:17:40] held to that because i knew that god
[1:17:42] started something amen and i could take
[1:17:45] the devil right back and begin testimony
[1:17:47] meetings
[1:17:48] hallelujah
[1:17:51] take him back
[1:17:53] to where jesus begun
[1:17:55] and then you know that the word said
[1:17:57] that he which begun a good work shall
[1:17:59] continue it
[1:18:00] but you see the tree of life will never
[1:18:02] fail you
[1:18:03] hallelujah but i want to challenge you
[1:18:06] that there is such an exponential
[1:18:09] increase of technology and advancement
[1:18:12] and the prophet gave a parallel and said
[1:18:15] that as technological advancement takes
[1:18:18] place in the spirit the lord is
[1:18:20] revealing a further part of the
[1:18:22] inheritance so that we go from just you
[1:18:26] know the age of horse and buggy
[1:18:29] justification the age of
[1:18:32] um
[1:18:33] um
[1:18:34] you know car
[1:18:36] sanctification the age of um
[1:18:39] aeroplane the the pentecostal outpouring
[1:18:43] of the spirit then the age of the
[1:18:45] astronaut is now the holy ghost himself
[1:18:47] the capstone of god's love taking us out
[1:18:50] of the earthen ways under the eagle
[1:18:53] anointing
[1:18:54] and let me tell you it's not an eagle on
[1:18:56] the ground
[1:18:57] who knows that it's a flying eagle
[1:18:58] anointing
[1:19:00] it's an eagle anointing that takes you
[1:19:02] to fly above judgment
[1:19:04] above sin
[1:19:06] above darkness above lust above fear
[1:19:09] into a position with christ
[1:19:11] hallelujah
[1:19:12] above those things so when you pray
[1:19:15] people things change
[1:19:17] because you have vision to see
[1:19:19] hallelujah and you say lord let me have
[1:19:21] that isab that you said because you know
[1:19:23] he promised isaf to us
[1:19:25] in this day
[1:19:26] the laodicean church in revelation 3
[1:19:29] he says come to me and take of this i
[1:19:31] serve
[1:19:32] and put it on your eyes so you can see
[1:19:35] that's for you
[1:19:37] we you know we
[1:19:38] many of us born in the message but you
[1:19:40] still need the isaf
[1:19:41] take it oh yes it's like you would go to
[1:19:43] the shop and you go buy some ointment
[1:19:45] for your itchies you know spots whatever
[1:19:48] and you go buy that and your buyer won't
[1:19:50] take the ointment from him amen same
[1:19:53] you might not see it but it's there
[1:19:56] and you can put it on wipe it on your
[1:19:58] eyes
[1:19:59] and let you see spiritually
[1:20:01] give you spiritual vision to see beyond
[1:20:03] the veneer of all of this
[1:20:05] so that you can break through and see
[1:20:07] reality
[1:20:09] hallelujah
[1:20:11] hallelujah
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:15] and i just challenge you now
[1:20:18] if all of this effort has gone in and
[1:20:20] they've built up this whole big thing of
[1:20:22] technology and the tree of knowledge has
[1:20:23] got as the prophet says
[1:20:25] science has taken man farther with his
[1:20:27] five senses
[1:20:29] than we have with the soul
[1:20:31] and see he's preaching this early on in
[1:20:32] the message but now under the opening of
[1:20:35] the seals and under the revelation of
[1:20:36] the son of man and under the fullness of
[1:20:38] god he's taken us into an astronaut age
[1:20:41] and raised us up above these things so
[1:20:43] now the fruit that you bear can bring
[1:20:46] change
[1:20:47] hallelujah you can change nations
[1:20:50] you know that
[1:20:52] if god gets a hold of you
[1:20:54] you're omnipotent
[1:20:56] you know that omnipotent
[1:20:59] or powerful
[1:21:00] hallelujah nothing is impossible to them
[1:21:02] that believe
[1:21:04] that's why i'm encouraging you to pray
[1:21:06] i'm encouraging you to a supernatural
[1:21:08] prayer life
[1:21:10] approach god the right way and he'll
[1:21:12] come praise the lord hallelujah just
[1:21:14] approach him the right way
[1:21:16] don't run into it
[1:21:17] just
[1:21:18] rest
[1:21:20] sit back and and worship
[1:21:22] kneel down and worship whatever you need
[1:21:24] to do just worship god
[1:21:26] enter in his gates of thanksgiving his
[1:21:28] courts with praise
[1:21:31] within minutes seconds the presence of
[1:21:33] the lord
[1:21:34] just broods down over you
[1:21:36] the blood put us on speaking terms amen
[1:21:40] hey
[1:21:41] that doesn't there's no other catch
[1:21:44] there's no like speaking terms plus
[1:21:47] or speaking terms and then you've got to
[1:21:48] do this this and this and this i'm going
[1:21:50] to be a really good girl today
[1:21:51] and then i've got my mom speaking to no
[1:21:53] you just make sure that you just
[1:21:55] lay your life before the lord
[1:21:56] consecrate yourself to the lord
[1:21:58] trust in his grace and mercy and watch
[1:22:01] what happens
[1:22:02] hallelujah
[1:22:04] amen and be not afraid of desire
[1:22:08] the prophet says satan
[1:22:10] seen them go off like that without god
[1:22:12] now he's talking about them going on the
[1:22:14] sea
[1:22:17] satan's waiting for people to leave the
[1:22:20] jurisdiction of faith
[1:22:22] he's waiting and he's waiting for
[1:22:24] someone
[1:22:25] to go off in their own intellect and see
[1:22:28] what happens
[1:22:29] he's waiting
[1:22:31] so just be careful
[1:22:32] now he says this satan's seen them go
[1:22:35] off like that without god and so he said
[1:22:38] now let's get rid of them and that's
[1:22:41] just
[1:22:42] the good way to get rid of it too
[1:22:45] and matthew 14 24 you know and i just
[1:22:47] want you to see now in this storm
[1:22:50] so the storm enabled the revelation of
[1:22:52] jesus in a powerful way don't be
[1:22:54] discouraged when you find yourself in a
[1:22:56] similar storm because you walked in your
[1:22:59] own path
[1:23:00] revelation awaits you
[1:23:02] the lord will not leave you in the storm
[1:23:04] the law will not leave you in your
[1:23:06] condition
[1:23:08] matthew 14 24 says but the ship was now
[1:23:11] in the midst of the sea tossed with the
[1:23:13] waves for the wind with contrary you see
[1:23:15] it's always going to be contrary even
[1:23:17] when you're walking with the lord the
[1:23:19] wind will always be contrary to you and
[1:23:20] always trying to push you but just keep
[1:23:23] pressing the battle keep pressing on do
[1:23:26] not cower under fear
[1:23:28] watch how the lord always strips fear
[1:23:30] away first
[1:23:32] he doesn't want us to be afraid
[1:23:34] hallelujah
[1:23:35] perfect love will cast out all fear
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:39] and he sees your struggles says here in
[1:23:41] mark 6 47-48 and i will be repeating
[1:23:43] myself a little bit but i just wanted
[1:23:45] for emphasis here and when even was come
[1:23:48] the ship was in the midst of the sea and
[1:23:50] he alone on the land and he saw them
[1:23:53] toiling and rowing
[1:23:55] he sees those things that you go through
[1:23:57] he sees you toiling in prayer
[1:23:59] he sees you beating the the ground
[1:24:02] he sees that when you're struggling
[1:24:04] under some slave master and and he and
[1:24:07] he's waiting for the moment he's going
[1:24:09] to come he's going to set you free
[1:24:11] and you're going to get liberation thank
[1:24:13] you jesus hallelujah liberty from that
[1:24:16] besetting sin
[1:24:18] liberty from that fear liberty from that
[1:24:20] lust
[1:24:21] or by
[1:24:22] liberty from your own ability hallelujah
[1:24:25] you know the prophecy if you can just
[1:24:27] master your own ability
[1:24:29] by getting it out of the way then god
[1:24:31] can perfect to strengthen you
[1:24:34] you've got to master weakness
[1:24:38] you know
[1:24:41] and he saw them toiling and rowing
[1:24:44] for the wind was contrary see they were
[1:24:46] battling and battling they were trying
[1:24:47] they'd realize we're gone too far now
[1:24:50] this is still dark everywhere the storms
[1:24:52] are raging the seas whatever 10-foot
[1:24:55] swells 10 meters
[1:24:56] raging it's impossible it's coming to
[1:25:00] the darkest hour
[1:25:02] and they're rowing and they're trying
[1:25:04] and many times we find ourselves in
[1:25:05] these situations where we're just trying
[1:25:07] and going and we just think it's never
[1:25:09] going to happen it's never never going
[1:25:11] to get delivered from this thing this
[1:25:12] pathetic says oh and no it's not
[1:25:15] it's not there is an end to it
[1:25:17] hallelujah because the tree of life is
[1:25:19] here the redeemer is here hallelujah
[1:25:22] your season for deliverance is here
[1:25:25] hallelujah the lord is clearing the
[1:25:27] title
[1:25:28] hallelujah he's clearing the title he's
[1:25:31] clearing all the family traits that are
[1:25:33] negative he's clearing all of those
[1:25:35] deceptions the lies that may be in your
[1:25:37] children's minds that are holding them
[1:25:39] prisoner hallelujah
[1:25:42] he's clearing those lies he says be not
[1:25:44] afraid it is i
[1:25:47] i have come to take over this battle
[1:25:50] be not afraid
[1:25:52] hallelujah the visitation is here
[1:25:54] amen
[1:25:56] hallelujah amen
[1:25:59] for the win was contrary unto them
[1:26:03] anyone that stands for christ the wind
[1:26:05] will be contrary unto you
[1:26:08] but greater as he is in you than he is
[1:26:10] in the world
[1:26:11] and about the fourth watch of the night
[1:26:13] he cometh unto them walking upon the sea
[1:26:17] and would have passed by them hallelujah
[1:26:20] he would have passed by them
[1:26:22] oh my
[1:26:24] hallelujah but there's a people
[1:26:26] that are that know that the lord is
[1:26:29] walking on the water they know that
[1:26:31] there's a calling in their life they
[1:26:33] know that there is their time for
[1:26:35] deliverance it's their time for healing
[1:26:38] hallelujah they know it's their time
[1:26:40] that this fear shall disappear that
[1:26:42] these gossip spirits will disappear that
[1:26:44] this this darkness will disappear
[1:26:47] in the darkest hour and the fourth watch
[1:26:49] of the night just like it was for the
[1:26:51] church the church was in its darkest
[1:26:53] place and babylon was taking over
[1:26:55] denominational systems on everything and
[1:26:58] the locusts and the palmer women the
[1:26:59] caterpillars just like in your life
[1:27:01] sometimes it gets to a point where the
[1:27:04] locusts and the caterpillars and all
[1:27:05] those things begin to eat
[1:27:08] but then he comes
[1:27:10] the real message
[1:27:12] this message ain't no doctrines
[1:27:15] it's more than that
[1:27:16] this message is a revelation of a person
[1:27:19] this message is a person of being
[1:27:21] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:26] she's here in the fourth watch in the
[1:27:27] darkest hour bleak storms are aging
[1:27:31] like it is out there
[1:27:33] but then you sit here in peace
[1:27:35] and you sit here
[1:27:37] and it's just peaceful
[1:27:38] and you've got something
[1:27:40] what
[1:27:42] do you have
[1:27:43] what changed it
[1:27:45] who came in
[1:27:47] hallelujah
[1:27:48] oh i just want to encourage you tonight
[1:27:50] amen hallelujah
[1:27:53] to think about the magnitude of your
[1:27:56] benefit
[1:27:58] and would have passed by them
[1:28:01] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:28:03] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:28:05] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[1:28:08] oh my how many times you see now as the
[1:28:11] revival begins to pour out their
[1:28:14] intellectual spirits now begin to attack
[1:28:16] the people that are getting in revival
[1:28:18] hallelujah
[1:28:20] you know what
[1:28:22] we've been attacked as a church
[1:28:24] people think that we're too wild or
[1:28:25] whatever or too pentecostal there's all
[1:28:27] sorts of things and they're looking upon
[1:28:29] from an intellectual perspective from an
[1:28:31] external perspective and not knowing
[1:28:33] that we're experiencing them
[1:28:35] not knowing that it's the i am causing
[1:28:37] this disruption
[1:28:39] it's a passing disruption you know what
[1:28:41] pattern disruption is a very good
[1:28:42] technique when you want to make a change
[1:28:44] and you want to make a statement and i
[1:28:46] want to tell you jesus christ is making
[1:28:48] a statement in this generation
[1:28:50] and you guys are a statement of jesus
[1:28:52] christ because he's making changes he's
[1:28:55] taking you from intellectual faith into
[1:28:57] a true dynamic spirit and truth
[1:29:00] to prepare you to leave the earth and
[1:29:03] let you eat from the tree of life
[1:29:05] you eat from the tree of life and you
[1:29:08] live forever
[1:29:09] he put you in rapture and condition
[1:29:11] disrupting the pattern that all the
[1:29:13] people would go off and become formal
[1:29:17] and have all the doctrines tied up all
[1:29:19] the mysteries together every type every
[1:29:23] shadow
[1:29:24] and it's all complete and the
[1:29:27] the the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:29:29] is that you understand the message
[1:29:33] you understand all the doctrines
[1:29:35] of how pious
[1:29:37] but really
[1:29:39] the lord comes to disrupt the pattern to
[1:29:42] take it from here and make it a
[1:29:44] heartfelt religion
[1:29:46] to make it something that changes lives
[1:29:49] that's why in the darkest hour when it
[1:29:52] was all going grim and everyone's going
[1:29:54] off and sin and and leadership is
[1:29:57] failing and and and all this stuff's
[1:29:59] happening all over the world
[1:30:00] internationally and you think wow and
[1:30:02] all these websites going out there
[1:30:04] criticizing
[1:30:06] and yet
[1:30:07] the lord
[1:30:09] is working
[1:30:10] amongst his elect
[1:30:11] and he is creating an intimacy that
[1:30:14] we've never seen before
[1:30:16] and bringing a people closer than
[1:30:18] they've ever been before to disrupt the
[1:30:20] pattern
[1:30:21] of the tree of knowledge and making a
[1:30:24] religion making a denomination the lord
[1:30:26] will not settle for a message
[1:30:28] denomination when he returns will he
[1:30:30] find faith yes
[1:30:32] here we are
[1:30:33] why because he came
[1:30:35] why because he came and he changed it
[1:30:39] amen amen hallelujah
[1:30:42] not because we've done anything it's
[1:30:44] because of what he's done it's because
[1:30:46] we found ourselves sailing
[1:30:48] we found ourselves on that storm riding
[1:30:51] someone else's ideas
[1:30:52] riding someone else's faith maybe it's
[1:30:54] mum and dad's faith but then one day he
[1:30:56] comes to you and makes it real to you
[1:30:59] young children hallelujah
[1:31:02] oh my
[1:31:04] but straightway jesus spake and i love
[1:31:06] this

[1:31:09] and they cried out for fear
[1:31:11] and when i what i was going with this is
[1:31:13] they come and they they begin to look at
[1:31:16] this dynamic
[1:31:18] supernatural miracle-working god who
[1:31:20] changes people's lives who who makes
[1:31:23] people dance who makes people shout
[1:31:26] for joy
[1:31:27] who gives them joy unspeakable so they

[1:32:52] spake unto them saying be of good chair

[1:33:33] stormy
[1:33:34] black sea and reveal himself as the i am
[1:33:39] to remove fear hallelujah some are

[1:33:52] hallelujah the prophet says this in a
[1:33:53] prophet like unto moses he says in this
[1:33:55] hour that we're now living

[1:36:42] ship he walked on the water
[1:36:45] to go to jesus
[1:36:47] hallelujah
[1:36:50] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[1:36:53] was afraid and began to sink he cried
[1:36:55] saying lord save me and immediately i
[1:36:58] love this
[1:36:59] immediately jesus streets forth his hand
[1:37:02] and caught him and said unto him o thou
[1:37:04] of little faith wherefore did us thou
[1:37:06] doubt
[1:37:07] and notice now peter didn't sing here
[1:37:09] and when they hallelujah when they both
[1:37:12] were coming to the ship the wind ceased
[1:37:15] you see there was a journey back peter
[1:37:18] he had the the the grace and the daring
[1:37:21] and the courage to step out to go to

[1:37:39] the law
[1:37:40] when you enter that prayer life when you
[1:37:42] find your purpose when you find your
[1:37:44] calling when you your reason to live on
[1:37:46] this earth
[1:37:47] what are you here for
[1:37:49] i ask you that question do you know
[1:37:51] where you stand
[1:37:53] do you know what your purpose is
[1:37:56] on the earth
[1:37:58] you're made for a purpose
[1:38:01] every single one of you are made for a
[1:38:03] purpose
[1:38:04] do you know where you stand
[1:38:08] don't waste
[1:38:14] time nothing else will be as good
[1:38:18] nothing else will fit you properly
[1:38:20] all your own ideas you might know you
[1:38:22] think you know yourself more than he
[1:38:23] does but he knows you better
[1:38:25] and he's got a purpose for you
[1:38:27] and then when you get into that purpose
[1:38:29] then you begin to pray through that
[1:38:31] calling the faith of the son of god
[1:38:33] operates in your life
[1:38:35] and before that
[1:38:36] you wonder why is my prayers not being
[1:38:38] answered why i pray for this and it
[1:38:40] doesn't happen why i pray for that it
[1:38:41] doesn't happen
[1:38:42] but then when you find your purpose
[1:38:44] and then you pray through that purpose
[1:38:46] and you know your calling and you know
[1:38:48] the will of god for your life and you
[1:38:49] begin to channel it through there and
[1:38:51] then your prayers become answered
[1:38:53] it's because you're anointed to that
[1:38:56] that's where your anointing is that's
[1:38:58] where god will begin to empower you to
[1:39:00] enforce victory for your ministry for
[1:39:03] your calling for whatever you are made
[1:39:04] for
[1:39:05] and you can pray through those channels
[1:39:07] and you'll have confidence in god
[1:39:10] like elisha he followed elijah over the
[1:39:12] river and then he received the mantle
[1:39:15] now he could do the same thing yeah
[1:39:17] absolutely
[1:39:19] amen

[1:39:23] can we stand
[1:39:25] we're going to finish this but we're
[1:39:26] going to finish it standing and we're
[1:39:28] going to get the musicians up
[1:39:30] hallelujah
[1:39:35] and immediately jesus stretched off his
[1:39:37] hand oh and and when they were both
[1:39:39] coming to the ship the wind ceased can

[1:39:53] and when he saw the wind uh boisterous
[1:39:58] he was afraid and begin to sink and he
[1:39:59] cried lord save me and immediately jesus
[1:40:01] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:40:03] and said unto him oh thou of little
[1:40:04] faith wherefore did estelle doubt
[1:40:08] and when they both were come into the
[1:40:10] ship the wind ceased
[1:40:13] then they that were in the ship came and
[1:40:16] worshiped him
[1:40:17] saying of a truth thou are the son of
[1:40:19] god
[1:40:24] the ark returns to break amnesia
[1:40:27] the lord is that ark that the prison the
[1:40:30] the revelation of christ among the
[1:40:32] people amen in the old testament they
[1:40:34] had the ark of the covenant and it was
[1:40:37] treated as the presence of god amongst
[1:40:39] them
[1:40:40] and you see when that ark returned to
[1:40:42] jerusalem it brought worship it evoked
[1:40:45] worship and david danced around that ark
[1:40:49] the ark returns to us to break the
[1:40:51] amnesia christ comes to the people in

[1:41:04] and separated conditions can bring
[1:41:06] amnesia but god rich in mercy will come
[1:41:09] to you
[1:41:10] for they considered not the miracle of
[1:41:12] the loaves for their heart was hardened
[1:41:14] you see they were so
[1:41:16] it was just so foreign and even though
[1:41:18] they were just in a revival
[1:41:20] but the lord would come into their ship
[1:41:23] because now the sea was calmed and then
[1:41:26] they were able to cross over
[1:41:28] and this is the revival that the lord is
[1:41:30] bringing us into
[1:41:31] and when they had passed over they came
[1:41:33] into the land of guinness eric and drew
[1:41:35] to the shore
[1:41:37] and when they would come out of the ship
[1:41:39] straight away they knew him
[1:41:41] and ran through that whole region
[1:41:43] roundabout and began to carry about beds
[1:41:46] and those that were sick when they heard
[1:41:48] where they heard he was you see there
[1:41:50] was a desperation in the people when
[1:41:52] they realized that he was there
[1:41:54] they realized that revival that was
[1:41:56] before is happening again and i can
[1:41:58] declare to you that the revival that
[1:42:00] happened in the 60s is happening again
[1:42:03] hallelujah the revival that you hear

[1:42:07] things happening is happening now christ
[1:42:09] comes out of history out of message
[1:42:12] history out of the time of judges out of
[1:42:15] all of the confusion and wildness of
[1:42:17] what it was it's not that anymore
[1:42:19] because he is here and he's the one
[1:42:21] that's come to change it all so that we
[1:42:23] can rejoice the storm can be stilled the

[1:43:24] they
[1:43:25] they
