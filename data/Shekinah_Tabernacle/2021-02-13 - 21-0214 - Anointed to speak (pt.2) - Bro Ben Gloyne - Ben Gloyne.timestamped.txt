[54:33] i have them up on the board if you want
[54:35] to turn in the in the scripture to them
[54:36] that's fine so revelations 3 and 22
[54:40] says here he that hath an ear let him
[54:43] hear what the spirit saith
[54:45] under the churches and then in second
[54:48] corinthians 4 and 13
[54:50] we having the same spirit of faith
[54:52] according that is is written
[54:54] i believed and therefore have i spoken
[54:57] we also believe
[54:59] and therefore speak amen so may the lord
[55:01] bless his word this morning you may have
[55:03] your seats
[55:04] amen in his presence so i want to
[55:06] continue on from
[55:07] speaking last sunday to about being
[55:08] anointed to speak and you know
[55:11] this may be very elementary kind of a
[55:13] service but we need to say what the
[55:14] spirit says
[55:15] i mean we need to we need to god is
[55:17] looking for a response you know as
[55:19] as he would come to mary and martha
[55:21] before he rose lazarus he asked
[55:23] the question to to to mary or or to
[55:26] martha he said
[55:27] you know i am the resurrection and the
[55:30] life
[55:30] believeth thou this you know because god
[55:32] always wants to put out a question
[55:34] because he wants to see what our
[55:35] response is
[55:36] you know to see do we really believe
[55:38] what he's saying to us you know and
[55:40] and and she said yeah lord i believe
[55:42] that they are the christ that should
[55:43] come into the world so your god is
[55:45] always looking for a response back to
[55:47] him
[55:48] i mean he sends his word into the earth
[55:50] and then there's always uh you know he's
[55:51] looking for people to respond to that
[55:53] word
[55:53] and it's very important that we hear not
[55:56] only hear what the spirit says to the
[55:58] churches but we speak back what the
[55:59] spirit says to the church
[56:01] amen it's not it's not us changing what
[56:03] the spirit says but to repeat back
[56:05] basically back to god
[56:06] what he said to us amen it's very
[56:09] important you know
[56:10] it's very important that our lives aim
[56:12] in the word of god
[56:14] and i'd actually say it's vital that our
[56:16] lives amen not just with lip service but
[56:18] with it from your heart say
[56:19] amen amen it's essential that our hearts
[56:22] agree with the word
[56:23] and we speak what the spirit says now
[56:26] you know we know it was just a couple of
[56:28] just a couple of verses there but
[56:29] brother braham says it's not the size of
[56:31] the text but what's in the text that
[56:32] matters now
[56:33] we know through seven church ages uh
[56:35] after every address to the seven
[56:37] churches in the book of revelation
[56:39] that this this phrase to him he that
[56:41] hath an heir let him hear what the
[56:42] spirit says into the churches
[56:44] that is that is always given and and so
[56:46] that's showing that god would be
[56:48] speaking through seven church ages that
[56:50] you know that that the same spirit that
[56:52] inspired the prophets or inspired the
[56:54] your apostles to write the word would be
[56:56] speaking through a body down through the
[56:58] ages and
[56:59] so you know i'm so thankful that i'm
[57:01] looking at a people that
[57:02] we've been given an ear to hear what the
[57:04] spirit says amen that we're not just
[57:06] looking at a historical figure of 2000
[57:08] years ago but that same jesus is alive
[57:11] today
[57:12] now hallelujah so so this
[57:15] um you know we might say you know so
[57:18] even in this even in this ladies and age
[57:20] the spirit
[57:21] is speaking to the church now this is
[57:23] vital that we hear what the spirit says
[57:25] now
[57:26] obviously well you might be looking at
[57:27] me rather blankly saying but i believe
[57:29] the message of the hour of course i'm
[57:30] listening to what the spirit says
[57:32] but we need to respond to that it means
[57:34] it's more than just absorbing something
[57:36] but you've got to respond back to god
[57:38] see god is
[57:38] god is brooding over the earth looking
[57:40] for people to say will you say what i
[57:42] say
[57:43] will you respond back to me yay lord i
[57:45] believe your promises for me
[57:48] amen so you know but you know so this
[57:51] there's two there's basically two powers
[57:54] at every age
[57:55] there's a there's god and there's the
[57:56] devil you can break down the devil to
[57:58] many different facets but it just boils
[58:00] down to two
[58:02] and i'll say that there are everyone is
[58:04] listening to a spirit in this day
[58:06] every single man woman and child upon
[58:08] the earth is listening to a spirit
[58:10] it's either an antichrist spirit which
[58:13] can be very religious
[58:15] or it can be the spirit of god there's
[58:16] only two and what we're being led by
[58:19] shows what the spirit that we're
[58:21] listening to
[58:23] so you say well you know we you know so
[58:25] we live in this ladies and gents
[58:27] lukewarm blind you know say you're
[58:29] rich increased with goods but you're
[58:30] wretched miserable blind naked don't
[58:32] even know it
[58:33] and you may say well but the bride is in
[58:34] a bright age and surely we are in a
[58:36] bright age we've been called up i mean
[58:38] into a bright age just as
[58:40] you know it's a you could say it's an
[58:41] age within an age so the world is still
[58:43] in ladies here but the bride is in a
[58:45] bright age where god has called us out
[58:47] we've heard his voice
[58:48] and we've come out to him and now we're
[58:50] in union with christ you know it's the
[58:52] same as you look at this modern era you
[58:54] know within the 21st century we had
[58:56] different eras
[58:58] there was the era of the airplane
[59:00] spacecraft the uh
[59:01] the nuclear age the internet age now or
[59:03] in this age but it's all within the same
[59:05] span of time
[59:06] just as today we are the bride is in a
[59:08] bright age but the world is still in
[59:10] ladies here
[59:12] now if if we're not careful
[59:15] the spirit of this world will make us
[59:18] blind
[59:19] that we will not see the promise of our
[59:21] age because what you're looking at you
[59:23] know many people are panicking there's
[59:25] going to be covert 20 or cover 21 or
[59:27] different viruses or
[59:28] economic collapse or whatever more and
[59:30] they you know and they and they begin to
[59:32] get worried about what's going to happen
[59:34] you know what's coming i'll say jesus is
[59:36] coming i mean that should be the main
[59:38] goal of our whole life as jesus is
[59:40] coming
[59:41] it doesn't matter about what else is
[59:43] coming upon the earth jesus is coming so
[59:45] we need to prepare for his coming amen
[59:47] hallelujah isn't that right you know
[59:50] people panic and they do all kinds of
[59:51] crazy stuff but jesus is coming
[59:53] what's the main focus of our lives
[59:55] should be the catching away the bride of
[59:57] christ
[59:59] hallelujah amen so it's very important
[1:00:02] there's such a bunch you know this two
[1:00:04] hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:00:06] released in this age that haven't been
[1:00:08] here before
[1:00:09] there's many different demon powers upon
[1:00:11] the earth everyone has a voice and it's
[1:00:13] speaking it's trying to get your
[1:00:14] attention
[1:00:15] it's trying to get your attention
[1:00:16] because it wants you to follow it
[1:00:18] but we've heard the voice of god in this
[1:00:20] day
[1:00:22] hallelujah now you got to look at
[1:00:26] this leads you
[1:00:29] is what's manifesting in your life so
[1:00:31] spiritually
[1:00:33] where you're going spiritually is what
[1:00:35] is actually leading you
[1:00:37] now samson started as an overcomer
[1:00:40] he started he was anointed he was
[1:00:42] actually birthed to the earth
[1:00:44] to defeat the philistines and free the
[1:00:46] children of god that was his purpose in
[1:00:48] life
[1:00:49] but he deviated from that path and the
[1:00:52] thing that he was called to overcome
[1:00:55] overcame him so now there's many spirits
[1:00:58] in this world
[1:00:59] there's many different spirits and if
[1:01:01] we're not careful if we pay heed to it
[1:01:04] those spirits will overcome us instead
[1:01:06] of us overcoming them
[1:01:07] amen as you know as we heard the what
[1:01:09] you know a real nice song yeah we're
[1:01:10] called to just walk on the devil
[1:01:13] that's our job description i mean but if
[1:01:15] we go
[1:01:16] beyond our calling to something else
[1:01:18] we'll end up like samson
[1:01:20] where instead of him overcoming the
[1:01:22] spirit of that age it overcame
[1:01:24] him we are called to be separate from
[1:01:26] the world
[1:01:27] right we may be living in this world
[1:01:29] being a witness to this world but we are
[1:01:30] not of this world
[1:01:31] i mean so we shouldn't speak like the
[1:01:33] world dress like the world act like the
[1:01:35] world be like the world we're separated
[1:01:36] people under god
[1:01:38] hallelujah god does the separating
[1:01:41] isn't that right amen so the very nation
[1:01:45] samson was made
[1:01:46] born to destroy he became a slave to and
[1:01:49] sadly that can happen to us where where
[1:01:52] the demon power
[1:01:53] that we have been ordained or born to
[1:01:56] overcome
[1:01:57] will make us formal lukewarm and
[1:01:59] powerless
[1:02:00] that's what the antichrist spirit does
[1:02:02] it doesn't make us necessarily not a
[1:02:03] believer
[1:02:04] it'll make us formal lukewarm and
[1:02:06] powerless i remember the bride of christ
[1:02:08] is not ordained to be formal lukewarm
[1:02:10] and powerless
[1:02:11] she's ordained to be full of the
[1:02:12] anointing overcoming
[1:02:14] made in his image conquering every devil
[1:02:16] that comes against her
[1:02:18] i mean standing on the neck of the enemy
[1:02:20] spiritual powers hallelujah
[1:02:21] overcoming all things that's what we're
[1:02:23] made to be
[1:02:26] amen now this you know we'll get through
[1:02:28] this i see some people are scared don't
[1:02:30] be scared i may look scary but i'm not
[1:02:32] scary
[1:02:33] okay please never get the idea i'm scary
[1:02:36] i'm really not i don't think i am
[1:02:39] i may need a reality but i'm really not
[1:02:41] scary
[1:02:43] hallelujah thank you amen
[1:02:46] anyway so the direction that our lives
[1:02:49] are going
[1:02:50] should be proved spiritually now i don't
[1:02:52] know i'm not talking about going through
[1:02:54] trials now i'm talking about
[1:02:55] with where are we going it should be
[1:02:57] proof of the spirit that's leading us
[1:02:59] now
[1:02:59] either the scripture tells us now here's
[1:03:02] a
[1:03:02] i just okay i'm just going to get this
[1:03:04] out of my system this is just how i feel
[1:03:06] now now i've got a remote now which
[1:03:10] i can i don't have to jump forward and
[1:03:12] back now brother brown tells a story
[1:03:14] in the uh in the sermon deceived church
[1:03:17] by the world
[1:03:18] that's a very powerful sermon and to me
[1:03:22] i always take everything he preaches i
[1:03:24] don't put it on someone else
[1:03:25] this is my walk with god you know i'm
[1:03:27] gonna stand i'm gonna stand before him
[1:03:29] one day
[1:03:30] and i can't say well this person did
[1:03:31] this and the world did this and this did
[1:03:33] this and this did this and this person
[1:03:34] said this and he'll say
[1:03:36] that's not an excuse what did you do
[1:03:38] with my word
[1:03:39] amen when you're upon the earth so he
[1:03:41] tells the story he says it reminds me of
[1:03:44] a little book
[1:03:45] i read one day in california about 10
[1:03:48] years ago i picked it up in an old
[1:03:49] bookstore i forgot
[1:03:51] i forget who was the author just a
[1:03:53] little 10 sec book it had some good
[1:03:55] sense um a to it through though it
[1:03:58] seemed jokingly and cunningly but i
[1:03:59] found something in there that sounded
[1:04:01] like god to me
[1:04:02] and one of the little stories started
[1:04:04] out like this one morning in a great
[1:04:06] chicken pen
[1:04:07] there was a certain little rooster that
[1:04:09] thought he had all the knowledge that
[1:04:11] that was to be known so he flies up on a
[1:04:13] box and beat his little bill against the
[1:04:15] box four or five times
[1:04:17] threw back his little head and crowed
[1:04:18] like he never hurt a rooster crow
[1:04:21] and the others attracted their attention
[1:04:23] he said ladies and gentlemen this great
[1:04:25] of this of this chicken pen i would like
[1:04:28] to speak to you all this morning on some
[1:04:30] great educational program we have just
[1:04:32] designed
[1:04:32] said i have required a um a lot of
[1:04:36] knowledge in my studying
[1:04:37] as he pulled out his little glasses over
[1:04:39] his bill
[1:04:40] and he said i've decided that we
[1:04:42] chickens can can better ourselves by
[1:04:44] more knowledge therefore
[1:04:45] i can tell you that where if we dig and
[1:04:47] work in a certain pen or hole
[1:04:49] you'll find a certain vitamin that'll
[1:04:51] make us grow better
[1:04:53] prettier feathers and oh i can tell you
[1:04:56] how we can
[1:04:56] and better ourselves in many different
[1:04:58] ways now i'm not talking against
[1:04:59] education right now okay
[1:05:01] so get that out of your mind okay i'm
[1:05:03] not talking about i'm talking about
[1:05:04] spiritual
[1:05:05] your spiritual walk i'm not talking
[1:05:07] about go study if you want to study
[1:05:08] whatever but i'm not talking about
[1:05:10] against that
[1:05:11] i don't what about your spiritual walk
[1:05:12] see see i have decided that we can
[1:05:15] um so i'm going to begin from the
[1:05:17] beginning i've decided that we chickens
[1:05:19] can better ourselves by more knowledge
[1:05:21] therefore i can tell you that where if
[1:05:23] we dig in and work in a certain pen or
[1:05:25] whole
[1:05:26] we'll find a certain vitamin that'll
[1:05:27] make us uh grow better pretty our
[1:05:29] feathers
[1:05:30] and oh i can tell you how we can and
[1:05:32] better ourselves in many different ways
[1:05:35] and the little pulitz with their little
[1:05:36] red combs they just
[1:05:38] um cackled and said isn't here darling
[1:05:41] and they certainly admired him oh he's
[1:05:42] such a brilliant rooster
[1:05:44] reminds me of some of these seminary
[1:05:45] preachers such a brilliant man
[1:05:47] there's no need of us hanging around
[1:05:49] with the rest of the chickens we ought
[1:05:51] to go with him well before the little
[1:05:53] fellow got his speech finished
[1:05:55] there was another little chicken that
[1:05:57] didn't have such bright feathers come
[1:05:59] running in
[1:05:59] from the rest of the chicken yachts here
[1:06:01] boys just a minute
[1:06:03] i have heard the latest bulletin on the
[1:06:04] radio chickens went up four cents on the
[1:06:06] pound we're all going to the slaughter
[1:06:08] tomorrow
[1:06:09] what's good your knowledge is gonna do
[1:06:11] brother all the knowledge that we can
[1:06:12] accumulate what good does it do
[1:06:14] we're six foot of dirt we're all dying
[1:06:16] by inches and by minutes
[1:06:18] our knowledge means nothing we want to
[1:06:20] know him but they do that
[1:06:22] and even says in the sermon that that
[1:06:24] people are afraid of the new birth
[1:06:26] they will sidestep it in every way they
[1:06:28] will quote the prophet right they'll
[1:06:30] tell the scriptures right play the part
[1:06:31] just right but without a birth
[1:06:33] it all means nothing this is what this
[1:06:35] this is what this chicken's saying this
[1:06:37] chicken had some real sense
[1:06:38] he says what's the point of all this
[1:06:40] stuff and getting caught up in all this
[1:06:42] other stuff
[1:06:42] where we're all this world's gone to a
[1:06:44] tribulation right we're going to go in a
[1:06:46] rapture
[1:06:48] so what really matters amen i think
[1:06:50] there should be an urgency in this hour
[1:06:53] hallelujah there should be a real
[1:06:54] urgency in this hour amen that we are
[1:06:57] looking at the coming of the lord right
[1:06:58] now
[1:06:59] everything's everything's in place the
[1:07:01] beast has all his machinery in place to
[1:07:03] take over this earth it's all here
[1:07:06] hallelujah china's doing what it's
[1:07:08] ordained to do russia is doing what it's
[1:07:09] ordained to do
[1:07:10] amen and the bride of christ is in her
[1:07:12] position hallelujah
[1:07:14] you know the rapture is for the raptured
[1:07:16] now what does that mean a rapture means
[1:07:18] a catching away
[1:07:19] so those who are already caught away in
[1:07:21] god in his word will be raptured
[1:07:23] those who are not caught up in this word
[1:07:25] they're going to stay here where your
[1:07:28] affections are where your heart is
[1:07:29] that's where your treasures are
[1:07:31] so if your treasures are in this terra
[1:07:32] firma you're gonna stay in this terra
[1:07:34] firma
[1:07:34] upon this earth but if your treasures
[1:07:36] are in heaven that's where you're going
[1:07:39] hallelujah that may be awful blunt but
[1:07:42] that's just how it is
[1:07:43] the rapture is for the raptured god
[1:07:46] ain't taking no lukewarm believer he's
[1:07:48] taken those
[1:07:48] on fire who love him more than anything
[1:07:51] else
[1:07:52] hallelujah so i feel how yeah i feel
[1:07:57] like they're chicken
[1:07:58] the world's ending are we ready
[1:08:01] are we ready my heart's desire is that
[1:08:03] when the rapture goes
[1:08:05] every seat in this church will be vacant
[1:08:08] all of us are going that's that's my
[1:08:10] heart's desire we're all gonna make it
[1:08:12] we're not gonna leave one hoof behind it
[1:08:14] doesn't matter if that hoof is wayward
[1:08:15] somewhere a protocol they're coming back
[1:08:17] i mean they're gonna meet the lord jesus
[1:08:19] hallelujah that's my heart desire as we
[1:08:21] are
[1:08:22] all going hallelujah and god is present
[1:08:26] to make us ready
[1:08:27] hallelujah shouldn't be you know brother
[1:08:29] ram said people would say to him you
[1:08:31] scare the people to death talking about
[1:08:32] the coming of the lord
[1:08:33] he said it shouldn't scare you today
[1:08:35] that should be the most exciting thing
[1:08:37] upon the earth is we're going to be
[1:08:39] lifted up into glory in a moment a
[1:08:41] twinkling of an eye
[1:08:42] we're going to see the one that walked
[1:08:43] down the you know this way of suffering
[1:08:45] hallelujah
[1:08:46] hallelujah we're going to see him face
[1:08:48] to face
[1:08:50] amen that kind of thing should just
[1:08:51] thrill our souls soon and very soon
[1:08:53] we're going to see the king
[1:08:56] hallelujah so i just feel like that
[1:08:58] little rooster right today
[1:09:00] amen hallelujah
[1:09:06] scripture tells us that music is a very
[1:09:07] powerful tool
[1:09:09] the devil knows that real good he's not
[1:09:11] surprised at me saying that
[1:09:13] he knows it real well he was the worship
[1:09:15] leader in heaven
[1:09:17] he knows the power of music he knows the
[1:09:18] influence that it can exert
[1:09:20] and he uses it today very much
[1:09:25] you look at you look at every well not
[1:09:28] every but basically the vast majority
[1:09:31] of powerful videos on tick tock on
[1:09:33] instagram
[1:09:34] any social media has music in it
[1:09:37] because a spirit rides on music we don't
[1:09:40] sing for entertainment
[1:09:42] we sing that god comes down why do we
[1:09:44] sing at home that god comes down
[1:09:46] we don't sing to bring the devil into
[1:09:48] the room he's not welcome
[1:09:50] we don't sing songs that bring the devil
[1:09:52] we sing songs that the god would come
[1:09:54] down
[1:09:55] because you're you're calling a spirit
[1:09:57] when you sing
[1:09:59] you're either you're either calling hell
[1:10:00] or you're calling heaven
[1:10:02] who do you want in your play in your
[1:10:04] life i want heaven
[1:10:05] i want all that heaven is hallelujah i
[1:10:08] want nothing of hell
[1:10:10] i want all of heaven hallelujah
[1:10:13] and so brother brown identified this
[1:10:16] this is the message ashamed of him and
[1:10:20] that's the church we have authority by
[1:10:22] the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:10:24] and his promised word hallelujah the
[1:10:26] things that i do shall you do also more
[1:10:28] than this
[1:10:29] will you do for i go unto the father
[1:10:32] don't be ashamed of him in this
[1:10:33] generation
[1:10:34] sinful perplexed the last generation
[1:10:37] that will ever be on the earth as sinful
[1:10:39] adulteress
[1:10:40] full of petrified sores all everything
[1:10:42] that's been decent has become
[1:10:44] indecent national politics filth nations
[1:10:46] are broke up
[1:10:48] he says way back in the jungles of
[1:10:50] africa on safari hunters they had
[1:10:53] to take high-powered radios to hear
[1:10:55] elvis presley pat boone and them guys
[1:10:57] with that rock and roll and twist and
[1:10:59] the natives trying to see them act along
[1:11:02] jerking their head and acting like that
[1:11:04] the natives stood and looked at them but
[1:11:05] you see they're not americans like pat
[1:11:07] boone and elvis presley
[1:11:09] and ricky nelson and them guys are
[1:11:11] they're not judases of that type but see
[1:11:13] it's a spirit and the spirit is not only
[1:11:16] in america
[1:11:17] it has spread itself all over the world
[1:11:20] to bring them to the battle of
[1:11:22] armageddon
[1:11:23] this is happening right now where where
[1:11:26] the devil's using music to grab people
[1:11:28] and it's going to take and it's going to
[1:11:30] take them to one place the battle of
[1:11:31] armageddon
[1:11:32] but i could even say this we're all
[1:11:34] going to be at the battle of armageddon
[1:11:36] hallelujah because christ is going to
[1:11:38] come down in revelations 19 with a
[1:11:40] mighty host
[1:11:42] holy we're all going to be there you'll
[1:11:43] be on one side or another side
[1:11:46] i'd be on the lord's side because i read
[1:11:48] in the book he wins the battle
[1:11:50] hallelujah why pick the losing side you
[1:11:52] say well we don't listen to rock and
[1:11:53] roll that was the popular music genre of
[1:11:55] the day
[1:11:56] now it's gone to v basically every every
[1:11:58] different genre you want to name it's
[1:12:00] gone but as a spirit has gone into the
[1:12:01] world
[1:12:02] to to get the minds of people the
[1:12:05] spirits of people to take them to the
[1:12:06] battle of armageddon
[1:12:08] so you've got to be real careful what
[1:12:11] spirit you're listening to
[1:12:17] he says they act like that whether they
[1:12:19] whether whatever nation
[1:12:21] they come from africa india whatever it
[1:12:23] is that vulgar and stuff has spread all
[1:12:25] over the earth
[1:12:26] by just one man starting it and so has
[1:12:29] the gospel and the power of almighty god
[1:12:30] has spread around the world
[1:12:32] and the separation time is now taking
[1:12:34] place where god is calling a bride
[1:12:36] and the devil's calling a church let me
[1:12:38] be part of that bride
[1:12:40] hallelujah is the devil calling it
[1:12:42] church absolutely
[1:12:44] there'll be a time where that mannison
[1:12:45] sits in the temple of god as crowned
[1:12:48] hallelujah that's going to take place in
[1:12:51] in in physical form now
[1:12:53] with the devil's incarnate and a man and
[1:12:54] he'll be worshipped
[1:12:56] amen but at that time the bride is gone
[1:13:01] i want to be in the gone category
[1:13:03] hallelujah
[1:13:05] amen so it's a very powerful tool
[1:13:09] we want to be careful what we paid here
[1:13:11] to
[1:13:12] i heard a i heard a brother um he
[1:13:16] he preached on i can't uh the title of
[1:13:18] my wrong be to underlying symptoms
[1:13:21] he's from he's from south africa real
[1:13:23] powerful message
[1:13:25] and he said he talked about food but he
[1:13:27] went to spiritual things because you
[1:13:28] know covert a lot of people have
[1:13:29] underlying
[1:13:30] health cases when it came they get sick
[1:13:33] and
[1:13:33] unfortunately they pass on and but then
[1:13:36] spiritually we can have underlying
[1:13:37] symptoms
[1:13:39] and so he would um he would talk about
[1:13:42] these things and
[1:13:44] you know i thought it was real real
[1:13:47] powerful
[1:13:48] we've got to be careful what our
[1:13:49] underlying you know what's the
[1:13:51] underlying symptoms
[1:13:53] you know because either either will
[1:13:54] bring god or bring the devil
[1:13:56] complexes are different anyway you know
[1:13:58] different things
[1:13:59] but you gotta buddy but he said in that
[1:14:01] in the natural he says if you eat junk
[1:14:03] food you become junk
[1:14:05] yeah so we don't want to become junk
[1:14:08] spiritually
[1:14:10] we want to be organic free range
[1:14:14] past your feet hallelujah why he leads
[1:14:16] us into green pastures but
[1:14:18] besides still waters hallelujah
[1:14:21] amen now do i have this here i have this
[1:14:24] here now
[1:14:26] samuel would speak to saul and samuel
[1:14:29] said hath the lord
[1:14:30] as great delight and burnt offerings and
[1:14:32] sacrifices as obeying the voice of the
[1:14:34] lord
[1:14:35] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:14:38] and to hearken than the fed of rams
[1:14:40] for rebellion is as the sin of
[1:14:42] witchcraft and stubbornness
[1:14:44] is as iniquity and idolatry because thou
[1:14:47] has rejected the word of the lord thou
[1:14:50] hath
[1:14:50] also rejected thee from being from being
[1:14:53] king
[1:14:54] so so god spoke to him and said kill
[1:14:56] everything
[1:14:57] this is the story he did not speak back
[1:15:00] to the people what god told him
[1:15:02] he spoke something else because he was
[1:15:04] swayed by the popularity of the people
[1:15:07] and that's why we need to speak what the
[1:15:09] spirit says if he spoke what the spirit
[1:15:11] says this scripture would not be there
[1:15:14] but you see to be you know rebellious is
[1:15:16] a sin of witchcraft
[1:15:18] god is putting rebellion on the same
[1:15:20] category of witchcraft
[1:15:21] and we know witchcraft is basically
[1:15:23] communing with either devils
[1:15:25] or in the case of the witch of endor the
[1:15:27] dead
[1:15:29] so it's actually rebellion is actually
[1:15:31] listening to another spirit
[1:15:33] not the voice of god
[1:15:37] and even even you know and you know
[1:15:39] through the church ages we know we have
[1:15:41] it very much now but in the thytaran
[1:15:43] church age
[1:15:44] if i have it here no i don't have it
[1:15:45] here you know there's a complaint saying
[1:15:47] notwithstanding i have a few things
[1:15:49] against
[1:15:50] thee because thou sufferest that woman
[1:15:52] jezebel which call herself a prophetess
[1:15:54] to teach and
[1:15:55] to seduce my spirits to commit
[1:15:58] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[1:16:00] unto idols
[1:16:01] so there's a spirit antichrist spirit
[1:16:03] there that come to such a maturity in
[1:16:05] that
[1:16:05] age where people were listening to it
[1:16:08] and they are actually
[1:16:09] because they are listening because it
[1:16:10] wasn't god speaking to the church no
[1:16:11] more
[1:16:12] it was an antichrist spirit was now
[1:16:13] speaking through the church and the
[1:16:15] people were paying heed to that spirit
[1:16:17] and they began to speak what their
[1:16:18] spirit was telling them to speak
[1:16:22] we need to stay with the word we really
[1:16:24] need to stay with the word
[1:16:26] you know it's quite evident so god is
[1:16:29] speaking today
[1:16:31] he is and he is not speaking something
[1:16:34] that is outside of his word he cannot do
[1:16:36] that
[1:16:37] amen he will be speaking what his word
[1:16:40] has already declared
[1:16:41] and it will be the word manifested for
[1:16:44] the day in which we live
[1:16:46] now we know christ in every age is
[1:16:49] messiah
[1:16:50] you're going to receive that word and
[1:16:52] that's you receiving the messiah
[1:16:54] may the word is the messiah many people
[1:16:56] just attribute him to being 2000 years
[1:16:58] ago dying on a cross which he did for us
[1:17:00] but you must receive the word for your
[1:17:02] day to receive the benefits of calvary
[1:17:05] the full benefits of calvary
[1:17:07] because christ manifests himself in
[1:17:09] every age
[1:17:10] and the people of that age must receive
[1:17:12] him in that age you're following me
[1:17:13] you know what good would it be to do if
[1:17:16] you're following john the baptist
[1:17:17] there's christ and john the baptist
[1:17:18] preaching
[1:17:19] but then when jesus came along you
[1:17:20] rejected him saying no i'm a follower of
[1:17:22] john the baptist
[1:17:23] no you god moved on it was the same god
[1:17:27] but a different form doing a different
[1:17:28] thing
[1:17:29] right working out his plan of redemption
[1:17:31] the scribes and pharisees would say to
[1:17:33] jesus we are moses disciples
[1:17:36] and because and they could say this
[1:17:38] because of tradition
[1:17:40] and culture that's the only reason they
[1:17:42] could say they were moses disciples they
[1:17:44] were raised in a certain culture
[1:17:45] the culture was jehovah god is the god
[1:17:47] of israel moses was his prophet he gave
[1:17:49] us the first five books of the bible
[1:17:51] so we can say we are moses disciples out
[1:17:53] of tradition
[1:17:54] but it was not out of revelation because
[1:17:56] if it was out of revelation
[1:17:58] then they would have seen the one that
[1:18:00] spoke through moses was now in flesh
[1:18:02] and they would have been following jesus
[1:18:04] but because they could not see him
[1:18:06] as god and turned him down they were
[1:18:09] just following a historical god
[1:18:12] they were not listening or speaking what
[1:18:14] the spirit was saying to the church at
[1:18:16] that time
[1:18:19] they would not receive the word that was
[1:18:21] made flesh in their day
[1:18:24] this is in john 1 and 12 as many as
[1:18:26] received him
[1:18:27] to him gave you power to become the sons
[1:18:29] of god even them that believe on his
[1:18:31] name
[1:18:32] they did not receive him so they did not
[1:18:34] receive that power to come into sonship
[1:18:37] because they rejected the word for their
[1:18:38] day so it's the same thing in our day
[1:18:40] if we receive the word remember he's
[1:18:42] he's spoken to this generation
[1:18:44] hallelujah and now he's looking for a
[1:18:47] response
[1:18:48] for you and i and we should just be from
[1:18:50] our hearts amen
[1:18:52] i take this message i take you at your
[1:18:54] word you know i was thinking
[1:18:55] you know we need to receive the message
[1:18:58] in the same inspiration it was given
[1:19:00] so the same anointing that came upon the
[1:19:02] prophet to speak the mysteries of god
[1:19:05] should be the same anointing that comes
[1:19:06] upon us that we can receive it
[1:19:09] hallelujah amen
[1:19:13] jesus himself would say he would say in
[1:19:16] john 6 he says
[1:19:17] he says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:19:20] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[1:19:22] that i speak and do they are spirit and
[1:19:23] they are life
[1:19:24] i mean to the words that he was speaking
[1:19:26] there was life coming forth in that word
[1:19:28] but they could not receive his sayings
[1:19:30] they could not receive his words they
[1:19:32] did not receive the life we need to see
[1:19:34] the life of christ amen we need to speak
[1:19:37] what the spirit says now it says in
[1:19:38] revelations 22 and 17
[1:19:40] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:19:42] why they're saying the same thing
[1:19:44] they're not saying a different thing
[1:19:46] hallelujah this may be very simple but i
[1:19:49] trust it it
[1:19:50] means something to me amen
[1:19:54] and him that heareth say come yeah so
[1:19:56] we've heard so now we're going to speak
[1:19:58] we've heard him call and now we're
[1:20:00] calling because the same spirit that
[1:20:02] made the
[1:20:03] made the call now is in us and now we
[1:20:05] make the call
[1:20:06] amen we should be saying what the spirit
[1:20:08] says now
[1:20:10] it says in romans 8 for as many are as
[1:20:12] led by the spirit of god they are the
[1:20:14] sons of god
[1:20:15] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:20:17] bondage again to fear
[1:20:19] this is not the anointing we have
[1:20:20] received i mean we should not be fearful
[1:20:23] in this hour we should be rejoicing full
[1:20:25] of confidence
[1:20:26] hallelujah we should be so happy in
[1:20:29] spite of situation remember
[1:20:30] we don't worship god because of
[1:20:32] situation we we worship god because of
[1:20:34] who he is and what he has done
[1:20:36] that's why we worship him do we not amen
[1:20:38] that's why we're christians because of
[1:20:39] who he is
[1:20:40] holy you know modern christianity is all
[1:20:42] about well i'm the pursued one he's

[1:20:48] important thing but
[1:20:50] man has turned christianity it's all
[1:20:52] about the worshipper
[1:20:53] and not the worshipped
[1:20:57] amen but it's all about the worshipped
[1:21:00] about god himself you understand what
[1:21:01] i'm saying they actually turn around
[1:21:02] instead of worshiping god
[1:21:04] it's all about me and what and and my
[1:21:06] current state
[1:21:07] it should all be about him and what he's
[1:21:09] done in our lives that's the important
[1:21:11] thing
[1:21:11] hey he's he's redeemed us he's washed
[1:21:13] our sins away
[1:21:14] yeah he tells us in his word him them is

[1:22:49] corroborate with
[1:22:50] so you're giving the same um evidence
[1:22:53] you're giving the same testimony
[1:22:55] because what you're saying what the
[1:22:56] spirit's saying is the same thing
[1:22:59] hallelujah that's how we should be there
[1:23:01] should be a witness it shouldn't be a
[1:23:03] jarring when you hear the word
[1:23:04] should be amen even if it takes you you
[1:23:08] know
[1:23:09] takes literal height off your back
[1:23:11] should be amen
[1:23:12] hallelujah why because it's doing us
[1:23:15] good
[1:23:16] now he says we've got to have the token
[1:23:18] this is from the token message i think
[1:23:19] it's in 1964 one
[1:23:21] and when the token comes it testifies of
[1:23:23] christ
[1:23:24] he said it would and christ is the word
[1:23:27] and how can you deny the bible is
[1:23:29] true part of it and still say you have
[1:23:32] the token
[1:23:33] when the token is the testimony of jesus
[1:23:35] christ
[1:23:36] pardon me see there is what i wonder
[1:23:39] oh say i don't believe i believe the
[1:23:43] days of miracles oh look out there's no
[1:23:45] token there the token punctuates every
[1:23:47] word with
[1:23:48] an amen everything because it's god
[1:23:50] itself see all right
[1:23:52] but if the token is not there the
[1:23:53] covenant was in not effect it was a null
[1:23:56] same now no matter how much you say how
[1:23:58] much you'd say i believe every word in
[1:24:00] the bible
[1:24:01] say brother braham i can quote you half
[1:24:03] of that bible and all the bible by heart
[1:24:05] i believe every bit of it that's good
[1:24:06] satan does too
[1:24:08] uh-huh it takes the token hallelujah you
[1:24:11] know
[1:24:11] my my phone cannot quote me
[1:24:15] and this can out and this can quote the
[1:24:16] message and the bible in multiple
[1:24:18] languages that i know nothing about
[1:24:20] but this is not going in a rapture this
[1:24:23] will be left behind
[1:24:25] he is not taking message books in a
[1:24:27] rapture he's not taking your search
[1:24:29] program in a rapture or your bibles your
[1:24:30] concordances they're going to stay upon
[1:24:32] the earth
[1:24:33] he's taking a people that are living his
[1:24:35] word is manifested in their lives he's
[1:24:37] taking parts of himself
[1:24:39] up into glory hallelujah
[1:24:42] so it's very important to receive the
[1:24:45] word for your day
[1:24:47] now we can see this very um simply
[1:24:51] when we go to uh the story of of um
[1:24:55] caleb and joshua when when uh israel is
[1:24:58] at
[1:24:59] cadiz barnea so i don't have it on here
[1:25:03] either yeah i changed my notes it's kind
[1:25:04] of bit you know you make a slideshow but
[1:25:06] you change everything and here we are
[1:25:07] yeah but you know it's amazing when you
[1:25:10] think about it where
[1:25:11] where god would tell abraham your seed
[1:25:13] is going to go to a strange land we all
[1:25:15] know this very well but we're just going
[1:25:16] to rehearse some things
[1:25:17] you know your seat is going to be in a
[1:25:19] strange land 400 years
[1:25:21] they're going to be afflicted but but
[1:25:24] but also that nation whom they shall
[1:25:26] serve will i
[1:25:27] judge and afterwards they shall come out
[1:25:28] with great substance
[1:25:30] so they're going to be there about yeah
[1:25:31] 400 years then they're going to come out
[1:25:33] rich
[1:25:35] now what happened when israel was in a
[1:25:38] strange land
[1:25:39] they reflected 400 years then moses came
[1:25:42] to bring them out
[1:25:43] and and the night they were going out
[1:25:45] the egyptians gave all their gold all
[1:25:46] their stuff take everything just just
[1:25:48] be gone so they left with great
[1:25:49] substance so it was fulfilled exactly as
[1:25:52] it was prophesied
[1:25:54] now so if they could just take that and
[1:25:56] say well if god brought us thus far
[1:25:59] because what would have been the story
[1:26:00] around the campfire or maybe in their
[1:26:02] houses
[1:26:03] before moses came to egypt children
[1:26:07] it's nearly 400 years daddy are we gonna
[1:26:10] ever gonna be out of this bondage
[1:26:12] yes son how's it gonna happen
[1:26:15] well our father abraham told us there's
[1:26:18] gonna be a delivery gonna come
[1:26:19] he said we'd be down here and we've been
[1:26:20] down here about 400 years
[1:26:22] and there's going to be deliverance
[1:26:23] going to come and god himself is going
[1:26:25] to judge
[1:26:25] egypt what happened as egypt got judged
[1:26:29] hallelujah you look at the accuracy of
[1:26:31] the scripture it's a very accurate thing
[1:26:33] amen and you know and so and so you know
[1:26:36] a deliverer is going to come this nation
[1:26:37] is going to be judged
[1:26:38] and we're going to walk out with great
[1:26:39] substance but we're
[1:26:42] you know we're slaves we have nothing i
[1:26:43] don't well how's it going to work i
[1:26:45] don't know
[1:26:46] son but we're going to walk out with
[1:26:47] great substance how are we ever gonna be
[1:26:49] delivered out of this world power i
[1:26:51] don't know son but the word says it's
[1:26:53] gonna happen
[1:26:54] and what happened the word was fulfilled
[1:26:56] moses came
[1:26:57] i mean judgment came upon egypt and then
[1:26:59] they walked out with great substance
[1:27:02] so think it would be very important if
[1:27:05] god took them that far
[1:27:07] then god was going to take them all the
[1:27:08] way because that wasn't the whole
[1:27:10] promise
[1:27:11] the whole promise was they were going to
[1:27:12] go into the promised land
[1:27:14] drive out and destroy all the
[1:27:15] inhabitants of the land and they were
[1:27:16] going to dwell
[1:27:17] in their inheritance that was the
[1:27:19] promise of the hour
[1:27:21] but they did not speak what the spirit
[1:27:24] said
[1:27:26] the ten spies two of them did twelve
[1:27:28] spies
[1:27:30] two against ten
[1:27:35] you know two against ten only two
[1:27:38] echoed back what the spirit said only
[1:27:41] two caleb and joshua
[1:27:43] they said we've seen the land it's a
[1:27:44] good land it's amazing you think about
[1:27:46] this here they come packing grapes
[1:27:48] a cluster of grapes yay big two men are
[1:27:50] packing it here's the fruit of the land
[1:27:52] taste the grape they hadn't tasted a
[1:27:54] grape maybe the older generation did but
[1:27:56] you know the young ones
[1:27:57] what's that those that are born in the
[1:27:59] wilderness what's that it's a grape i
[1:28:01] heard about that what's it like
[1:28:02] taste the fruit of the new land you're
[1:28:06] gonna go live by this
[1:28:08] hallelujah as the same thing with you
[1:28:10] and i the holy ghost comes down this
[1:28:12] word comes forth
[1:28:13] well we're tasting the evidence of the
[1:28:15] new land
[1:28:16] hallelujah of our eternal home god comes
[1:28:19] down he says feed on this word
[1:28:20] feed on this this is what it tastes like
[1:28:23] this is the experience of it
[1:28:24] and they're literally chewing on these
[1:28:26] grapes the evidence of the new land
[1:28:29] and ten spies say yep it's a good land
[1:28:32] it's wonderful look we're you know
[1:28:33] you're eating this grape
[1:28:35] or maybe two you know it depends how
[1:28:36] many you can grab maybe but then he says
[1:28:39] but then they say nevertheless the
[1:28:41] people be strong that dwell in the land
[1:28:44] and the cities are walled and very great
[1:28:46] moreover we saw the children of anak
[1:28:48] there
[1:28:48] so they're beginning to speak so
[1:28:50] initially they are saying what the
[1:28:52] spirit has said
[1:28:53] but then because their own reasoning
[1:28:55] comes in that they are not speaking what
[1:28:57] the spirit has already spoken
[1:29:00] so now they are putting in their first
[1:29:02] first um
[1:29:04] you know opinions eight here scripture
[1:29:06] and their opinion is we cannot take the
[1:29:09] land so
[1:29:10] they were agreeing with what the spirit
[1:29:11] said but now they're speaking something
[1:29:13] different
[1:29:14] but caleb stilled the people before
[1:29:16] moses and said let us go up at once and
[1:29:19] possess it for we are
[1:29:20] able to overcome it what was caleb doing
[1:29:23] he was speaking back to god
[1:29:26] because the spirit the lord had told
[1:29:28] them the holy ghost had told them you
[1:29:30] are going into the land
[1:29:31] you are going to possess it you're going
[1:29:32] to be in your position you're in your
[1:29:34] inheritance
[1:29:35] and caleb is just echoing back to god
[1:29:38] what god had told them
[1:29:40] hallelujah and it's very vital we do the
[1:29:42] same thing
[1:29:44] hallelujah amen but we know the rest of
[1:29:47] the story
[1:29:49] the other 10 spy said we're not able to
[1:29:51] go up against it we can't they're
[1:29:53] stronger than we
[1:29:54] that wasn't the promise of god see we
[1:29:57] see the challenge comes is now when we
[1:29:59] are part of the fulfillment
[1:30:00] it's easy to say god sent a prophet in
[1:30:02] this age amen
[1:30:04] the pillar of fire is here again amen
[1:30:07] jesus christ is hearing his people
[1:30:09] amen but then now when it comes to you
[1:30:11] and i my mind
[1:30:13] the bride is being called it's easy to
[1:30:15] talk about a prophet
[1:30:16] what about what the bride is mean to do
[1:30:18] in this day and now what about the
[1:30:20] fulfillment of the scripture
[1:30:21] the prophet said that as jesus fulfilled
[1:30:23] the old testament the bride will fulfill
[1:30:25] the new testament
[1:30:27] amen i'll say we are more than able to
[1:30:30] fulfill the promise of god for our lives
[1:30:32] how we are more than able because he is
[1:30:34] the one who enables us to do the job
[1:30:36] hallelujah amen you know jesus
[1:30:39] jesus we know he was he was the god man
[1:30:42] he was fully god but he was fully man
[1:30:45] but he he had to as a man agree with
[1:30:48] what the scripture said about him
[1:30:50] he had to come into agreement with the
[1:30:51] scripture you know i'd say in luke 9 now
[1:30:54] do i have this on here
[1:30:59] we'll get there one day
[1:31:03] here we are jesus is there with the you
[1:31:06] know peter james and john drop what we
[1:31:08] call mount transfiguration
[1:31:10] and moses and elijah appeared to him
[1:31:13] and they began to preach to him of his
[1:31:16] decrees and what he should accomplish at
[1:31:18] jerusalem
[1:31:19] so here is here is the one here is the
[1:31:22] lamb of god that will take away the sin
[1:31:24] of the world
[1:31:25] and these two have been called they've
[1:31:27] been given the job to preach to the word
[1:31:30] what the word says about the word and
[1:31:33] what he had to accomplish remember
[1:31:35] all of creation hung on one man the
[1:31:38] outcome of all creation
[1:31:40] will it be redeemed back to adam's
[1:31:41] fallen race or just stay under the power
[1:31:43] of the devil forever
[1:31:44] there was not another lamb coming it was
[1:31:46] the only one amen he was the one
[1:31:49] in shadow of the passover and different
[1:31:51] shadows to the old testament here was
[1:31:52] the fulfillment of this
[1:31:54] of this and here he is standing there
[1:31:56] and pete
[1:31:57] and and and moses and elijah are
[1:31:59] standing and telling him
[1:32:01] what he is going to fulfill now
[1:32:04] i don't believe it just would you know
[1:32:06] it would not have been just a nice
[1:32:07] thought
[1:32:08] many times we take a sermon as just a
[1:32:10] nice thought but god is trying to put
[1:32:13] something across to us
[1:32:14] that will change our lives and so i
[1:32:17] doubt very much they talked about the
[1:32:19] weather they talked about the current
[1:32:20] state of the world but they were talking
[1:32:22] about
[1:32:22] the scripture that he had to fulfill and
[1:32:25] they begin to preach to him
[1:32:27] you are the lamb of god they'll take
[1:32:28] away the sin of the world john the
[1:32:30] baptist told you that
[1:32:31] amen you are you are to fulfill genesis
[1:32:34] 3 being the seed of the woman that will
[1:32:36] crush your bruise ahead of the seed of
[1:32:37] the serpent
[1:32:38] you will be wounded for our
[1:32:40] transgressions quoting isaiah 53 you
[1:32:42] will
[1:32:42] you will be wounded for our
[1:32:43] transgressions the chastisement of our
[1:32:45] peace will be upon you and by your
[1:32:47] stripes who will be healed
[1:32:48] hallelujah because they needed just
[1:32:50] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:32:52] they were forgiven but the sin was just
[1:32:54] covered they needed
[1:32:55] a a real blood to come to wipe away the
[1:32:58] debt completely
[1:33:00] so they were looking at him to fulfill
[1:33:01] that for them
[1:33:03] hallelujah amen you will
[1:33:07] you will fulfill psalms 22 my god my god
[1:33:09] why is that forsaken me
[1:33:11] you will fulfill that but he had to
[1:33:14] agree with the word concerning himself
[1:33:17] he had to believe what they were telling
[1:33:18] him well you say that's easy he's jesus
[1:33:21] he was still a man
[1:33:24] amen now he did not have unbelief
[1:33:27] he did not have that battle but still he
[1:33:29] had to believe the scripture brother
[1:33:31] brahm says
[1:33:32] that he went to he went to the tomb he
[1:33:34] went to the cross
[1:33:36] with one scripture promise that he'll
[1:33:38] come out of the grave
[1:33:39] i'll not leave my holy i'll not suffer
[1:33:42] my holy one yeah i'll not leave my
[1:33:44] his soul in hell nor suffer thy holy one
[1:33:45] to see corruption that was the
[1:33:47] one scripture he went to calvary with
[1:33:49] knowing that he was going to come out of
[1:33:51] the tomb
[1:33:52] he had to believe that scripture
[1:33:53] concerning himself no one else had done
[1:33:55] it before but he was going to fulfill it
[1:33:58] hallelujah so he had to agree with the
[1:34:00] word that was concerning him
[1:34:04] amen psalms 16 and 9
[1:34:08] therefore my heart is glad and my glory
[1:34:10] rejoiceth
[1:34:11] my flesh shall also rest in hope for
[1:34:13] thou shalt will not leave my soul in
[1:34:15] hell neither will thou suffer thy holy
[1:34:17] one to see corruption
[1:34:18] that's what he went to calvary worth
[1:34:23] now we have a word to fulfill we're here
[1:34:27] to do a job
[1:34:28] we're not here just to float through
[1:34:30] life we're here to listen
[1:34:32] to what the spirit says to the church
[1:34:33] and then speak it back and manifest it
[1:34:36] brother ram says in the masterpiece
[1:34:38] 1964. now for nearly 2000 years god has
[1:34:41] been making him a masterpiece because
[1:34:43] he struck adam to get a piece off of him
[1:34:46] part of him a rib to make a wife for him
[1:34:49] and now that perfect masterpiece that he
[1:34:51] struck at calvary
[1:34:52] he got a piece off of him it's just the
[1:34:56] new testament that's all
[1:34:57] he fulfilled the old testament now it's
[1:34:59] the new testament another piece to be
[1:35:01] fulfilled
[1:35:02] the old and newest husband and wife see
[1:35:05] and it taken
[1:35:06] uh the old two four to four show the new
[1:35:09] christ come the masterpiece to fulfill
[1:35:12] that speak of the old testament
[1:35:13] now his bride will fulfill everything
[1:35:15] that's in the new testament
[1:35:17] another masterpiece in making
[1:35:20] i'm talking about you by the way i'm not
[1:35:22] talking about someone else i'm talking
[1:35:23] about you
[1:35:24] we're here to fulfill the new testament
[1:35:26] hey if someone's going to take a rapture
[1:35:28] here i am i don't know about everyone
[1:35:31] else but here i am
[1:35:32] enoch had a walk with god and and god
[1:35:34] said you want to come a bit higher one
[1:35:36] day
[1:35:36] he didn't say what about everyone else
[1:35:38] it's not recorded he just god just took
[1:35:40] him
[1:35:40] and that should be our walk in this
[1:35:42] world i'm walking with god
[1:35:44] hallelujah and god's going to take me
[1:35:46] one day that's my focus
[1:35:48] though misunderstood maybe he was though
[1:35:51] rejected maybe he was he just walked
[1:35:52] with god
[1:35:54] hallelujah that's how we should be in
[1:35:57] this hour
[1:35:59] hallelujah let's just walk with god amen
[1:36:02] now the apostle paul would speak saying
[1:36:03] seeing we have
[1:36:04] we are also encompassed with so greater
[1:36:06] cloud of witnesses
[1:36:08] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:36:10] sin that does so easily beset us and let
[1:36:12] us run with patience the race that is
[1:36:13] set before us
[1:36:14] you know there's so many names written
[1:36:16] in the lamb's book of life
[1:36:18] when the last one is dipped in blood
[1:36:21] we're out
[1:36:23] what if we found that last one what if
[1:36:25] that became our life's ambition
[1:36:28] now i'm not saying i'm not saying
[1:36:30] forsake having children a job or a
[1:36:32] career no no do all those things
[1:36:34] but what if our soul our main ambition
[1:36:37] in life
[1:36:38] was i want to find the last one i want
[1:36:40] to go home
[1:36:42] shouldn't that be our drive of our life
[1:36:45] lord jesus
[1:36:46] hallelujah we want to get out of here
[1:36:50] the world tries to make it very
[1:36:51] comfortable to stay but we are not
[1:36:52] ordained to stay we're ordained to go
[1:36:55] amen and this should be our focus of our
[1:36:57] life should be lord
[1:36:58] prepare me to leave amen hallelujah
[1:37:04] amen
[1:37:06] we have received a kingdom that cannot
[1:37:08] be shaken
[1:37:09] it says in hebrews 12 see ye refuse not
[1:37:13] him that speaketh
[1:37:16] for if they escaped not who refused him
[1:37:18] that spake on earth
[1:37:20] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[1:37:23] away him that speaketh from heaven
[1:37:25] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[1:37:27] he hath promised saying
[1:37:29] yet once more i shake not the earth only
[1:37:31] but also heaven
[1:37:33] this earth this whole world has been
[1:37:35] shaken the powers of heaven have been
[1:37:36] shown everything has been shaken in this
[1:37:38] day
[1:37:39] you can see the world we live in you
[1:37:41] think civilization
[1:37:42] the highest form of civilization should
[1:37:44] have no crime
[1:37:46] right should have no divorce should have
[1:37:49] no trouble
[1:37:50] shouldn't need a police force should
[1:37:52] look after
[1:37:54] the old and the unborn that should be
[1:37:57] civilization
[1:37:58] everyone lives in peace do we have that
[1:38:00] upon the earth
[1:38:02] no because it's shaken it's falling
[1:38:04] apart
[1:38:05] hallelujah that's because it says
[1:38:08] everything that can be shaken
[1:38:09] he says and this word yet once more
[1:38:13] signified the removing of the
[1:38:15] of those things that are shaken as of
[1:38:17] things that are made
[1:38:18] that those things which cannot be shaken
[1:38:21] may remain
[1:38:23] wherefore we're receiving a kingdom
[1:38:25] which cannot be moved let us have grace
[1:38:26] whereby we may serve god acceptably
[1:38:29] with reverence and godly fear now this
[1:38:32] word receiving
[1:38:33] part of the definition is to receive
[1:38:36] something that's transmitted
[1:38:38] how shall we receive a kingdom because
[1:38:40] jesus would say the kingdom of god is
[1:38:41] within you
[1:38:42] i mean so this kingdom we have received
[1:38:44] it's been transmitted down into our
[1:38:46] souls
[1:38:47] hallelujah because jesus says the words
[1:38:49] i speak to you that are spirit and they
[1:38:50] are life
[1:38:51] i mean so now the spirit of god goes
[1:38:53] upon the word of a prophet
[1:38:54] and it's transmitted that kingdom is
[1:38:56] transmitted into you and i i
[1:38:58] mean that we cannot be shaken glory
[1:39:01] should that make us happy you know i'm
[1:39:04] about to close
[1:39:05] that make us happier maybe you know but
[1:39:07] we are living in an uncertain time but
[1:39:09] this gospel is certain
[1:39:12] hallelujah faith cometh by hearing and
[1:39:14] hearing by the word of god
[1:39:16] this is why this message of spoken word
[1:39:19] is so important
[1:39:20] because it's transmitting a kingdom amen
[1:39:23] our lord jesus
[1:39:24] is spoken word he was spoken through the
[1:39:26] mouth of a prophet
[1:39:27] and then those who receive it echoed
[1:39:29] back to god saying amen
[1:39:32] hallelujah and they see that word
[1:39:34] putting on flesh in their lives
[1:39:36] hallelujah you know brother brown tells
[1:39:38] a story about a about an eagle as the
[1:39:41] eagle stir with her nest
[1:39:43] and he he begins to speak about you know
[1:39:45] that there comes a certain age
[1:39:47] where where where mama eagle doesn't
[1:39:50] want her babies in the nest anymore
[1:39:53] she wants them to fly because she's
[1:39:56] looking down at them
[1:39:58] and she knows the same life and the same
[1:40:01] power
[1:40:02] and the same ability is in them she
[1:40:05] didn't raise chickens
[1:40:07] she didn't raise buzzards she rose
[1:40:09] eagles she raised eagles she birthed
[1:40:12] eagles
[1:40:13] that are exactly the same in her in
[1:40:15] power
[1:40:16] inability in strength everything she is
[1:40:20] they are by birth and our new birth has
[1:40:23] made us like christ
[1:40:24] hallelujah so now she comes to a place
[1:40:27] where she has to stir
[1:40:29] up the nest to get them to fly because
[1:40:31] she wants
[1:40:32] them to see the power that's in her is
[1:40:35] in them
[1:40:36] you know you think about a little eagle
[1:40:38] other than this you know they watch mama
[1:40:40] way up in the heavens
[1:40:41] and they're looking up and they see her
[1:40:42] just swoop down with great power puts
[1:40:44] out her great big wings and just lands
[1:40:46] on the nest
[1:40:47] no doubt they're you know just just just
[1:40:49] amazed by it aren't you amazed by it
[1:40:52] and they see mum with a big 14 foot some
[1:40:54] some some eagle wingspans big giant
[1:40:56] wings
[1:40:57] and and she just rests down on the nest
[1:40:59] and they're thinking that's so amazing
[1:41:01] mama you're so amazing hallelujah
[1:41:04] but she wants them to realize you're
[1:41:07] built like me
[1:41:09] you're not built to stay in the nest
[1:41:10] you're built to fly in the heavenlies
[1:41:12] with me
[1:41:13] hallelujah and now there's so there
[1:41:15] comes a time when the when the nest gets
[1:41:17] stirred up
[1:41:18] where all the because what happens is an
[1:41:20] eagle will take things that are soft and
[1:41:22] nice and lines the
[1:41:24] nest with say animal skins or brunt your
[1:41:26] leaves and different things
[1:41:28] and lines the nest it's nice and soft so
[1:41:30] when the eagles are hatched they've got
[1:41:31] a nice soft
[1:41:32] place to live but then there comes a
[1:41:34] time where the eagle stirs the nest and
[1:41:36] takes all the soft things and throws it
[1:41:38] out
[1:41:38] and maybe the babies are sitting here
[1:41:40] saying mama that was my favorite
[1:41:42] rabbit skin why are you taking this
[1:41:45] comfort
[1:41:46] from me but mama's in her mind saying
[1:41:49] boy you're gonna fly
[1:41:51] you can't stay here no more you're not
[1:41:53] built to be in a nest you're built to be
[1:41:54] heaven-bound
[1:41:56] you're built i mean to fly like me so
[1:41:58] she begins tearing those things out and
[1:41:59] they think mama
[1:42:00] what are you doing mama sometimes we ask
[1:42:03] god i don't understand
[1:42:05] he wants us to fly he wants us to soar
[1:42:08] up in the heavenlies with him
[1:42:10] hallelujah so now here they are and then
[1:42:12] and then what happens is where
[1:42:14] once we're soft and comfortable it
[1:42:16] becomes lots of thorns and stickers in
[1:42:18] there and they stand on something again
[1:42:19] and it gets uncomfortable and brother
[1:42:21] ram says it's like us when you begin to
[1:42:23] testify and people
[1:42:24] and people kick back against it what's
[1:42:26] that that's a thorn
[1:42:27] that's a hard place where it used to be
[1:42:29] soft and wonderful there's rejection
[1:42:30] comes and all that hurts
[1:42:31] that pricks in amen but then but then he
[1:42:35] begins
[1:42:36] shipping as a flapper great big wings to
[1:42:38] blow out all the loose feathers
[1:42:40] because she's preparing them to fly
[1:42:42] friends we're going to fly so fast one
[1:42:44] day we're going to be twinkling
[1:42:45] we're going to be gone hallelujah we're
[1:42:48] going to be gone before anyone knows
[1:42:49] we're gone
[1:42:50] where did they go well they're just gone
[1:42:53] hallelujah
[1:42:54] and we're preparing for that flight you
[1:42:55] take a space shuttle i'll come back to
[1:42:57] you you take a space shuttle
[1:42:59] there's so many checks you know the
[1:43:02] craft is
[1:43:02] as as well carefully to the launch pad
[1:43:06] and and all the engineers check it over
[1:43:08] is it built right
[1:43:10] there can be one thing loose it'll make
[1:43:11] the whole thing blow up which we've seen
[1:43:13] unfortunately in history one little
[1:43:15] valve one little thing loose the thing
[1:43:16] just blows up as it goes up
[1:43:18] so the engineers check it over is this
[1:43:20] correct is this right
[1:43:22] and then they begin to fill it up and as
[1:43:24] the tanks are being filled
[1:43:26] they check if that's all right
[1:43:29] and they check all the gauges and this
[1:43:32] is why we come to church
[1:43:34] we're filling up for a flight fuel for a
[1:43:36] flight
[1:43:37] hallelujah it's not it's not rocket
[1:43:39] propellant this is holy ghost power
[1:43:41] amen but then our gauges need to be
[1:43:43] checked is our love gauge on full
[1:43:45] as our malice on zero as our
[1:43:47] unforgiveness on zero as our long
[1:43:49] suffering on full as our patience on
[1:43:51] full
[1:43:51] amen as our you know as our faith on
[1:43:53] full hallelujah that's our gauges should
[1:43:55] be ready
[1:43:56] and now here we are and the astronauts
[1:43:58] come out they sit in this great big
[1:43:59] thing
[1:44:00] they're not flying anything they just
[1:44:01] sit there hallelujah

[1:44:33] of this world and we dwelling around
[1:44:35] this totally foreign to this world
[1:44:37] hallelujah so here they are sitting in
[1:44:39] there who's watching launch
[1:44:40] anyone watch the launch the asteroids
[1:44:42] just sit there

[1:44:46] weather above is the atmosphere right
[1:44:49] is it is it clear not much wind just the
[1:44:52] sun shining
[1:44:53] everything's fine or is it the gloomy
[1:44:56] clouds of unbelief and hatred malice
[1:44:58] strife
[1:44:58] if that's hanging over someone you can't
[1:45:00] fly god's got to get it
[1:45:02] god's got to get rid of it so there so
[1:45:04] there they are then the countdown
[1:45:05] happens
[1:45:06] because the engineers have checked the
[1:45:08] ship you know this this
[1:45:09] this gospel i'll just tell you this

[1:48:12] feet across

[1:48:15] calf and pack it away
[1:48:16] and that little eagle never realized

[1:49:59] i mean it's soon and very soon we're
[1:50:01] gonna see the king amen and our whole
[1:50:02] life should be guided by that one thing

[1:50:11] egypt i'm going to get the children of
[1:50:13] israel out then we're going to return to
[1:50:14] this mountain
[1:50:15] although we've been in a place we may
[1:50:17] not
[1:50:18] may not have remembered it because we're
[1:50:19] in the mind of god but now where his
[1:50:21] attributes expressed on the earth
[1:50:23] and something within us says we're going
[1:50:24] to go home
[1:50:26] hallelujah this ain't no pie in the sky
[1:50:29] there's reality
[1:50:30] i remember mama eagle wants her children
[1:50:32] to know the same power and ability the
[1:50:34] same life that's in her
[1:50:35] is in them as the same thing with this
[1:50:37] word hallelujah it wants you to know
[1:50:39] the same life by the baptism of the holy
[1:50:42] ghost the same life that was in jesus
[1:50:44] christ is in you
[1:50:45] the same anointing that was what the
[1:50:46] prophet is in you it means to the same
[1:50:48] power
[1:50:49] the same authority hallelujah
[1:50:53] god sent the prophet to the earth to
[1:50:54] prove this is the power of the cross
[1:50:56] this is what my blood achieves
[1:50:58] i mean that nothing will stand before
[1:51:00] you the angel said nothing will stand
[1:51:02] before your prayers
[1:51:03] and he actually asked the question not
[1:51:04] even cancer not even cancer why because
[1:51:07] cancer was the biggest problem of the
[1:51:08] age
[1:51:09] harley says that so so he was told
[1:51:11] nothing in this world will stand before
[1:51:13] your prayers
[1:51:15] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:51:17] i say we're believers aren't we
[1:51:19] we believe this message we believe the
[1:51:22] word of god
[1:51:23] it's true amen if it brought us out of
[1:51:26] the world just like it brought egypt you
[1:51:27] know
[1:51:28] you know the israelites should have you
[1:51:29] know caleb and them the spy should have
[1:51:31] thought hold on let's just take stock
[1:51:33] let's take stock children so the
[1:51:36] prophecy said
[1:51:38] i'm just repeating what i said before
[1:51:39] but we're going to think about this the
[1:51:41] prophecy said we'd be there 400 years
[1:51:42] how long were we there
[1:51:44] about 400 years the prophecy said that
[1:51:47] that that nation is going to be judged
[1:51:49] what happened to egypt
[1:51:51] well i don't need to say anything
[1:51:53] because you're there you sort yeah they
[1:51:54] got judged
[1:51:55] and the prophecy said we'll come out
[1:51:57] with great substance
[1:51:59] what is where's all this bling now we've
[1:52:01] got where do we get it from
[1:52:04] and the prophecy says we're going to go
[1:52:05] in and take this land irrespective of
[1:52:07] what's in there
[1:52:09] hallelujah if they were speaking that
[1:52:11] way they would have been speaking what
[1:52:12] the spirit said
[1:52:14] they are just echoing it back to god but
[1:52:16] they didn't take stock
[1:52:17] their reasoning overrode the word of god
[1:52:20] for them
[1:52:21] that's the same thing for you and i
[1:52:23] we've got a rapture to take
[1:52:25] this message has been sent to bills in
[1:52:27] the statue of the perfect man
[1:52:29] to be made in his very image where god
[1:52:31] sees brother abraham says that
[1:52:33] that jesus is the messiah and he says
[1:52:35] the bride is the messiah
[1:52:37] amen as he is anointed the word we are
[1:52:39] their word anointed as well that's what
[1:52:41] he said
[1:52:42] hallelujah that's what i said we are and
[1:52:43] i believe it
[1:52:46] hallelujah amen so if he said we would
[1:52:49] overcome see
[1:52:50] this is this is a good way you know our
[1:52:52] lord jesus is the high priest
[1:52:54] of our profession right
[1:52:58] if we speak back to god his promises he
[1:53:01] can act upon those promises in our life
[1:53:04] if we speak negative we'll that's just
[1:53:06] all we'll be but if we speak positive
[1:53:08] irrespective of condition
[1:53:10] remember caleb had the sleigh same same
[1:53:13] slave marks and you know things in his
[1:53:15] body as the other spies
[1:53:16] joshua the same but they didn't take
[1:53:19] that into consideration they just said
[1:53:20] we're going to take this land
[1:53:22] doesn't matter our situation our
[1:53:24] condition it doesn't matter
[1:53:26] hallelujah so the lord wants us to have
[1:53:30] the same experience of the same life
[1:53:32] the same faith that was in him as in you
[1:53:34] and i amen because that word that he has
[1:53:36] spoken has been placed by faith in you
[1:53:39] and i amen this is the hour of sonship
[1:53:43] i'm just going to throw some phrases out
[1:53:45] there but you know this is the hour of
[1:53:46] sonship this is what the word has told
[1:53:48] us
[1:53:48] that nature is groaning and in travail
[1:53:50] that's why the world's falling apart
[1:53:53] nature itself is groaning and travailed
[1:53:55] why because there's birth pains come
[1:53:56] upon the earth because a new earth is
[1:53:58] going to be birthed
[1:53:59] how a new age is going to be birth the
[1:54:01] millennium is going to be birthed amen
[1:54:02] brother brown preached birth pains
[1:54:04] the church is going to bring forth
[1:54:07] hallelujah
[1:54:09] we're we happen to be living in the hour
[1:54:11] of the manifestation of it
[1:54:12] i mean so this is the hour of sonship
[1:54:14] this is what the word has told us that
[1:54:15] that
[1:54:16] now would be the manifestation of the
[1:54:18] sons and daughters of god you know i
[1:54:19] always think of where john said now we
[1:54:21] are the sons of god
[1:54:23] right now i say oh god the inspiration
[1:54:25] that struck him to write that
[1:54:26] may it strike us to recognize we are the
[1:54:29] sons and daughters of god
[1:54:30] right now i mean that means all the
[1:54:32] devil's works are going to be under our
[1:54:34] feet
[1:54:34] right now all the devices of him gonna
[1:54:36] be under our feet right now
[1:54:37] no weapon formed against us shall
[1:54:39] prosper right now aim into the same
[1:54:41] power those in the mouth of adam
[1:54:43] hollio to speak the power the spoken
[1:54:45] word to move things around and take
[1:54:47] control and dominion is in us right now
[1:54:49] amen
[1:54:50] hallelujah amen this is the other full
[1:54:54] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:54:55] this is the hour of the breaking of
[1:54:57] every cycle
[1:54:59] hallelujah this is the hour where the
[1:55:01] cycle of death is gonna
[1:55:02] break amen this is the hour why because
[1:55:06] there's a people upon the earth
[1:55:07] i believe i'm looking at them i trust
[1:55:09] there's something in you says that's me
[1:55:11] holy that is not gonna taste death but
[1:55:13] they're gonna step from this world
[1:55:15] and a glorified body into the next world
[1:55:18] hallelujah there's a cycle going to be
[1:55:19] broken this is the hour
[1:55:20] that cycle will be broken this is the
[1:55:23] hour where every family trait cycle will
[1:55:25] be broken
[1:55:27] if you want it to be broken it can be
[1:55:29] broken
[1:55:30] doesn't matter if it's been in your
[1:55:31] family if your last name means basically
[1:55:33] temper
[1:55:34] hallelujah and the reason your forebear
[1:55:36] was named that because he had attempted
[1:55:38] to fight a buzzer and you've got their
[1:55:39] last name
[1:55:40] there's a power in this room in this
[1:55:41] word right now that can break that off
[1:55:43] of your life hallelujah
[1:55:45] if you want it to be broken off your
[1:55:46] life amen unforgiveness whatever it may
[1:55:49] be
[1:55:51] there is a power in this word to break
[1:55:54] every single cycle of family spirits
[1:55:58] tradition whatever it is
[1:55:59] there's a power in this world because
[1:56:01] god wants a bride made in his image
[1:56:04] hallelujah made in his image as where he
[1:56:06] looks us he sees the word made flesh
[1:56:09] you know what he's going to see one day
[1:56:12] he's going to look down i believe he's
[1:56:13] looking at us
[1:56:13] in this way right now i just see
[1:56:17] i see me in a people i see my attributes
[1:56:21] it's not potential no more it's reality
[1:56:24] and i just can't stand i've got to take
[1:56:25] them home
[1:56:26] holy i just got to take them home to be
[1:56:28] with me
[1:56:30] hallelujah this is the hour
[1:56:34] where the devil's been exposed
[1:56:37] all of his tricks have been exposed
[1:56:40] hallelujah
[1:56:42] this is the hour where the dead in
[1:56:43] christ erased you know the rapture the
[1:56:45] cycle of the rapture of the
[1:56:46] of the of the shout the voice and the
[1:56:48] trumpet brother brown says the message
[1:56:50] is the shout
[1:56:51] he made it real clear the message is the
[1:56:54] shout so we don't need another shout out
[1:56:55] so the voice of god has already spoken
[1:56:57] so now the second part of the rapture
[1:56:59] cycle is the voice of the archangel
[1:57:02] that's not another ministry to come upon
[1:57:04] the earth that's actually a life
[1:57:06] that's coming to a bride that will
[1:57:08] literally bring the dead in christ from
[1:57:10] the grave
[1:57:11] you take it in the natural and i
[1:57:13] probably say this bef well many times
[1:57:14] before but you take a harvest season
[1:57:17] you see grain you see wheat that's grown
[1:57:19] in a field the farmer
[1:57:21] what dictates the harvest is the
[1:57:23] condition of the wheat
[1:57:25] hallelujah it's not the farmer deciding
[1:57:27] well it's thursday i might as well go
[1:57:28] harvest my crop no no
[1:57:30] he looks out upon that crop and because
[1:57:33] he has the mind of a farmer he knows
[1:57:35] that's
[1:57:35] harvest condition so the life the life
[1:57:38] in the field brother and preacher is the
[1:57:41] rising of the sun to me it's more than a
[1:57:42] sermon
[1:57:43] where he says that that wave chief
[1:57:45] offering the life of christ is waved in
[1:57:46] front of the people
[1:57:48] i mean because god is declaring that
[1:57:49] there's more in the field just like this
[1:57:52] hello so the life that was in the
[1:57:53] prophet was waved hallelujah in front of
[1:57:55] us
[1:57:55] and god is actually saying you see this
[1:57:57] that's being waved over you
[1:57:59] you'll become that same life will come
[1:58:01] into you and manifest the same word
[1:58:03] hallelujah so now it's actually the life
[1:58:05] in the grain that cries to the
[1:58:07] farmer harvest me i'm ready
[1:58:11] the sunshine has been what yo yo you're
[1:58:13] ripening me
[1:58:14] that all the greenness is gone so it's
[1:58:17] actually a life that's calling forth
[1:58:19] hallelujah
[1:58:20] and that life will call the dead in
[1:58:22] christ from the grave
[1:58:25] hallelujah that's why we've got to
[1:58:26] listen to what the spirit says keep
[1:58:28] walking with the voice
[1:58:30] amen hallelujah
[1:58:33] that's what we should do it's more than
[1:58:35] a message
[1:58:36] it's more than a collection of sermons
[1:58:38] it is jesus christ revealed today
[1:58:41] hallelujah it's more than a nice idea
[1:58:44] it's more than a religion it's jesus
[1:58:46] christ made known today
[1:58:48] hallelujah and he has called you and i
[1:58:50] he's spoken to us
[1:58:53] you're my bride there should be
[1:58:55] something to say yes lord
[1:58:56] yes i love you more than anything else
[1:59:00] there should be something to say yes
[1:59:01] lord i love you more than everything
[1:59:02] else too
[1:59:03] through such a love affair that his word
[1:59:05] takes preeminence over our lives
[1:59:07] above what we think in our own humanity
[1:59:11] hallelujah look so take heed to the
[1:59:15] voice of god
[1:59:16] we should speak i'll just finish with
[1:59:18] what i started with
[1:59:19] we should repeat back to god what he has
[1:59:22] already spoken
[1:59:23] not with our own human interpretation
[1:59:25] anything we say yes lord
[1:59:26] you declared it thus amen
[1:59:30] hallelujah let's have the musicians i
[1:59:32] mean this morning
[1:59:33] amen mary did the same thing god spoke
[1:59:36] through the angel gabriel to her
[1:59:38] you're gonna have the promise son jesus
[1:59:40] echo back let it be unto me according to
[1:59:41] thy word
[1:59:43] hallelujah amen
[1:59:51] i mean they stand this morning i mean i
[1:59:54] want to sing
[1:59:55] beulah land

[2:00:01] wants to go

[2:00:05] here
[2:00:07] amen get all the career you can job
[2:00:09] money whatever whatever but the main
[2:00:11] thing is

[2:00:15] wouldn't it be good if this was the year
[2:00:17] wouldn't it be good if the
[2:00:19] see the loved ones that have gone on you
[2:00:22] see someone who's 18 or 21 age and
[2:00:24] they speak something to you and your
[2:00:26] eyes come open because we've been
[2:00:28] anointed with isab that we can see
[2:00:30] we're not blind like the world
[2:00:32] hallelujah we can see where we're going
[2:00:33] what's going on
[2:00:35] imagine if they said you the rapture's
[2:00:37] on is that you brother so-and-so
[2:00:40] and there's something in you you don't
[2:00:40] need to ask you know hallelujah
[2:00:43] and then these bodies have changed
[2:00:45] before you realize that we're caught up
[2:00:46] to meet him in the air
