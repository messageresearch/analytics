[26:30] evening everyone but heavy one here Oh
[26:32] may God bless you welcome Amen if you've
[26:36] got your Bibles handy we just go
[26:38] straight to the scripture we'll go to
[26:40] proverbs 18 in verse 10 and then we're
[26:45] gonna read from Luke chapter 30 Luke 21
[26:49] verses 34 and 35 so proverbs 18 and
[26:52] verse 10 I'm sure it's a familiar
[26:58] scripture to us all but I'm glad I mean
[27:05] it sees the name of the Lord is a strong
[27:08] tower the righteous run earth into it
[27:11] and is safe amen hallelujah amen then
[27:15] we're going to look chapter 21 verses 34
[27:19] and 35 hallelujah that means this is
[27:29] Jesus speaking of thee well let's read
[27:34] from verse 29 showing it says and he
[27:36] spake to them a parable as Jesus
[27:38] speaking he says behold the fig tree and
[27:40] all the trees when they now shoot forth
[27:44] you see and know that your ownselves at
[27:46] summers night hands so likewise ye when
[27:49] you see these things come to pass know
[27:52] you that the kingdom of God is nigh at
[27:54] hand
[27:55] verily I say to you this generation
[27:56] shall not pass away till all be
[27:59] fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass
[28:01] away but my words shall not pass away
[28:04] and take heed to yourselves lest at any
[28:06] time your hearts be overcharged with
[28:09] surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of
[28:12] this life and so that they come upon you
[28:14] unawares for as a snare shall it come on
[28:18] all them that dwell on the face of the
[28:20] whole earth Watchi therefore and pray
[28:22] always that ye may be accounted worthy
[28:25] to escape all these things that you
[28:28] shall that shall come to pass and to
[28:31] stand before the Son of man a man made
[28:34] Lord this is word you may have your
[28:36] seats tonight in his presence I'd like
[28:38] to if I could take a little thought up
[28:41] in I
[28:41] been thinking of I've been listening to
[28:43] the messages that brother branham he he
[28:46] preached a few sermons entitled letting
[28:48] off the pressure and we understand from
[28:52] this day and age that we live in I'm
[28:53] basically just going to I'm going to
[28:55] preach letting off the pressure tonight
[28:57] you know we it's incredible where where
[29:01] you look at the age that we are that we
[29:02] live in time has filled up you know none
[29:06] of us really have a spare moment you
[29:08] know we are rushing from from the
[29:10] morning to the evening you know our our
[29:13] our timescale of things and our you know
[29:16] our what do you call it
[29:18] you know our day especially boiled down
[29:21] to minutes and seconds instead of hours
[29:23] and you know we're going to how to do
[29:24] this out it's a minute here a minute
[29:25] there and you know we wake up and you
[29:27] know we are we are straight away many
[29:29] people they check their cell phone and
[29:31] they aren't semesters the answer emails
[29:33] before they even get out of bed and then
[29:34] they've got a rush and have breakfast
[29:35] and maybe they'll take a coffee in the
[29:37] and the car on the way to work and
[29:39] they're listening to something maybe in
[29:40] the car on their China you know snatch a
[29:42] few minutes maybe with the Lord as
[29:44] they're driving then they're at work and
[29:45] then there are work mode and then
[29:46] they're you know and then they're you
[29:48] know they're trying to do things that
[29:49] they should have done last week and
[29:50] they're running running running running
[29:51] it's a pressurized age right and then
[29:55] you've got the you know and then you've
[29:56] got your bills to pay you've got you
[29:58] know you've got to call the bank to
[29:59] organize this and you got to get this
[30:01] insurance and you've got a you know
[30:03] there's all these things and then you
[30:04] know maybe your phone has died you got
[30:05] to call the insurance company
[30:07] and then you know you got all these
[30:08] things you've got to organize and sort
[30:10] out you know it's not just simple as
[30:11] wake up in the morning here's the day
[30:13] there's many things that you need to do
[30:15] that's because this age is a pressure
[30:18] age I mean we've never lived the the
[30:21] world has never been in such a pressure
[30:23] I believe from from Adam and Eve till
[30:26] till now where there is such the
[30:29] busyness of life as everywhere you know
[30:32] children even growing up they can go
[30:34] they can have your sport or music before
[30:37] school than their school than they have
[30:39] some activity after school dinner at
[30:41] home they're going to do their homework
[30:42] then they've got to go to bed then
[30:43] Saturday they're at sport and they do
[30:45] something in the Saturday afternoon and
[30:46] then there's Sunday maybe church is
[30:48] telling us in this Monday and it rolls
[30:49] around you know it's pressurized
[30:52] busyness
[30:54] amen and it's meant to be this way
[30:57] unfortunately but fortunately for us we
[31:02] have a a strong tower that we can run
[31:05] into and are safe amen as we read there
[31:08] in Proverbs the you're the name of the
[31:10] Lord is a strong tower where the
[31:12] righteous run into and they are safe
[31:15] Alleluia so now we so there is a place
[31:18] of safety in this age now I know this
[31:20] may be all very familiar but we sang
[31:22] this morning tonight
[31:23] you know renew the joy of thy salvation
[31:25] so it's good yeah it's good every so
[31:28] often just to just to really maybe go to
[31:31] 101 and just rejoice and the fact of
[31:33] what God has done for us because
[31:35] pressure will try and take your joy away
[31:37] pressure tries to make you lose sight of
[31:40] the goal of our body change you know
[31:42] pressure tries to take away the fact
[31:45] that we're more than overcome as in
[31:46] Christ because pressure makes you look
[31:48] at natural things it makes you look at
[31:50] things you might have got to do here but
[31:52] when it's all said and done they won't
[31:54] be remembered I mean when it's all said
[31:56] and done we once out wish I did that a
[31:58] bit more I wish I you know it'll all be
[32:01] forgotten we'll be around as throne will
[32:03] be praising him for a salvation we'll be
[32:05] giving him glory hallelujah we'll be
[32:08] thanking him amen and the pressure will
[32:10] really be off then but we have a place
[32:12] of safety we have a place of refuge in
[32:14] this day where we can run into and dwell
[32:18] hallelujah where we're not only we just
[32:20] go in to once in a while but we dwell in
[32:22] that place I mean let's go to Joshua
[32:25] chapter 20 Alleluia
[32:29] if you're feeling pressure let it off
[32:31] tonight amen this is we're just going to
[32:37] read the first six verses of Joshua
[32:39] chapter 20 but you can read the whole
[32:41] foot amen we under all this just read it
[32:43] here so Joshua 20 verse 1 down to verse
[32:45] 6 and it says the Lord also spake unto
[32:52] Joshua saying speak to the children of
[32:55] Israel saying appoint for you cities of
[32:57] refuge wherein I spake unto you by the
[33:00] hand of Moses that the slay that killeth
[33:03] any person unawares and unwittingly
[33:07] and unwittingly may flee phizzer
[33:11] further and they shall be your refuge
[33:14] further from the Avenger of blood and
[33:16] when he that doth flee unto one of those
[33:19] cities shall stand at the entering of
[33:20] the gate of the city and shall declare
[33:23] his cause in the ears of the elders of
[33:25] that city they shall take him into the
[33:27] sir take him into the city unto them and
[33:30] he shall and give him a place that he
[33:33] may dwell among them and if the Avenger
[33:36] of blood pursue after him then they
[33:38] shall not deliver the Slayer up into his
[33:40] hand because he smote his neighbor and
[33:43] unwittingly and hated him not before
[33:45] time and he shoved well in that city
[33:48] until he shall stand before the
[33:50] congregation for judgment and until the
[33:52] death of the high priest that shall be
[33:54] in those days then shall the Slayer
[33:56] return and come unto his own City and
[33:58] unto his own house unto the city from
[34:01] whence he fled so here we have Joshua we
[34:05] know Joshua the minister of Joshua
[34:08] places the people in the promised land
[34:09] it's a it's a ministry of adoption or
[34:12] placing and in the land there is
[34:14] actually six cities of refuge and we
[34:17] understand through the scripture that
[34:19] air is the seventh is always a mystery I
[34:21] mean for there was you know so there was
[34:23] so the seventh is always a mystery so
[34:26] Jesus when he was you know filling me
[34:29] you know when he turned the water into
[34:30] wine there were six pots of water for
[34:32] purification and he was the source of
[34:34] the purification he was the seventh the
[34:37] woman at the well head had six husbands
[34:39] but her real husband was the seventh
[34:40] standing in front of her amen because he
[34:42] is the rear you know he's the mystery
[34:44] and then so the seventh city of refuge
[34:46] is Christ amen it is not a geographical
[34:49] location but it is a it is a being it's
[34:52] a supernatural God I mean where you can
[34:54] enter into rest entering into Christ and
[34:57] it's a very simple process to repent and
[34:59] be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ
[35:01] for remission of sin and you shall
[35:03] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[35:05] I mean you shall enter into the city of
[35:07] refuge you shall run into the strong
[35:09] tower I'm in the high tower so the
[35:12] seventh as Christ himself so now we read
[35:15] here that if someone unwittingly did it
[35:17] they may flee thither
[35:18] so they had a writer fight actually
[35:20] he killed someone saying accidentally
[35:22] happened where they knew that the
[35:24] relations of those person going to come
[35:25] and kill him they could run into one of
[35:27] these cities and once they got into the
[35:29] city they were safe and then they could
[35:31] really let off the pressure and makers
[35:33] imagine that your life was in jeopardy
[35:35] and the Old Testament knows eye for eye
[35:37] tooth for tooth amen your there was no
[35:39] mercy I mean so so imagine the pressure
[35:42] your life was in danger you've got a run
[35:44] and you don't know you know maybe maybe
[35:46] there's a few cities you could go to
[35:47] maybe there's one yo you know there's
[35:49] hip runs over here or you know there's a
[35:52] few which one should I go to and then
[35:53] you make your fast as you can you run
[35:55] that's the same thing in this day you
[35:57] know there comes an awareness you're
[35:59] lost and undone amen you have a sin
[36:02] burden and then you know that the you
[36:05] know the hounds of hell are chasing you
[36:07] I mean that's God's conviction and
[36:09] you're going to recognize I'm going to
[36:11] run I got to find a place to lay off the
[36:13] pressure
[36:14] holy and then you recognize now Christ
[36:16] as that city of refuge and then you run
[36:18] to him you've got to give your life to
[36:19] Him I mean you can't just be raised up
[36:22] at a Christian home you've got to
[36:23] surrender your all hallelujah but then
[36:26] when you really get into him and you
[36:28] know your sin has been done away with
[36:29] you know he he took care of the sundeck
[36:33] hallelujah Amen you you know you know
[36:35] it's gone who knows your sins are gone
[36:37] then you can really live off the
[36:39] pressure
[36:40] hallelujah because once you know that's
[36:42] been sorted out it doesn't matter what
[36:45] happens in life I mean you can have it
[36:47] all you can have nothing it doesn't
[36:48] matter if you're in the city of refuge
[36:50] glory to God hallelujah if you're just a
[36:54] bum on the street with nothing
[36:55] hallelujah Amen if you're a millionaire
[36:58] praise the Lord it doesn't matter
[37:00] hallelujah Amen so now it's a glorious
[37:04] thing we can because this life makes us
[37:07] forget about what really we have I mean
[37:10] if you're a believer this night Amen if
[37:12] you're sealed into the kingdom buyers
[37:14] Holy Spirit you have the most precious
[37:16] thing and you can lead off the pressure
[37:18] you know why worry about tomorrow he's
[37:21] got tomorrow
[37:22] why not worry don't worry about next
[37:24] week he's got next week if he had last
[37:26] week he left this week I mean if he had
[37:28] last year if this year if he's guarded
[37:30] you down here he'll God
[37:31] the rest of the way we don't need to
[37:33] worry about anything we can lid off the
[37:35] pressure hallelujah when my enemies come
[37:37] against me when the yeah when the flood
[37:39] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[37:40] I'll raise up a standard I can lid off
[37:42] the pressure I'm in the battles the
[37:44] Lord's I can let off the pressure
[37:45] parley he's the captain of the hosts
[37:47] leading this battle I'll let off the
[37:49] pressure mentioned Joshua he would have
[37:51] had a real burden he's he's raised up in
[37:54] the ministry of moses he was there in
[37:56] egypt seeing the plagues fall he was
[37:58] there on the Passover night hallelujah
[38:00] he can lead off the pressure I mean all
[38:02] the firstborn sons could lead off the
[38:03] pressure that night I'm in the head of
[38:05] screaming in the Egyptians your brother
[38:07] Brown Joan does it your firstborn son
[38:09] goes daddy the head Johnny just died I
[38:12] used to play them now he's dead I hear
[38:14] screaming down the street and then and
[38:16] then the son I mean ending the father
[38:17] your brother says you know just takes
[38:19] off the spectacles puts down his Bible
[38:21] don't race and you can lid off the
[38:23] pressure how do you know what do you
[38:25] mean Danny what do you mean he died I
[38:26] might die just look out the window see
[38:29] the blood on the door and lentil you can
[38:31] lid off the pressure how do we know it's
[38:33] going to work because did you see what
[38:35] happens there Moses with the plagues
[38:36] then he said do this you'll be safe that
[38:39] this angels going to come if that's true
[38:40] this is true you can let off the
[38:42] pressure and little you know whatever
[38:44] his name is little Eli I could just live
[38:45] off the pressure hallelujah but now
[38:47] here's Joshua think of it as a burden
[38:49] God God moves in a powerful way
[38:52] and the Ministry of Moses they never saw
[38:54] things like this they never saw the Red
[38:56] Sea part they were slaves for hundred
[38:59] years are slaves then God seems to
[39:00] deliver it out 80 year-old man with a
[39:02] stick let my people go oh my a few you
[39:07] know there in Goshen it's light in
[39:09] Goshen it's dark over Egypt they never
[39:10] saw things like this I mean and Joshua
[39:13] was there and he saw God come down on
[39:15] Mount Sinai and the Lord given and you
[39:17] know yeah he saw the tabernacle be built
[39:19] in the glory of the Lord filling the
[39:20] tabernacle and you know he saw
[39:22] incredible things but now the burden
[39:24] came to him you got to take the people
[39:26] over you have to place the people in the
[39:29] land Moses we don't mention the mention
[39:31] passing that burden on to the you say
[39:33] the next generation you've got to finish
[39:35] this work I mean the ministry is not
[39:37] done we've been taken out be eager to
[39:39] take them in I can't take them in
[39:42] hallelujah because I said because I
[39:44] smoked the rock
[39:45] I'm a DA you know I can't go in you got
[39:47] to do it they would have built up some
[39:49] pressure now now there's a burden now
[39:53] there's a burden you know he would have
[39:55] had Joshua would have had a burden amen
[39:57] but then and then they and then they
[39:59] crossed thee you know then they and they
[40:02] cross the Jordan now he would have had
[40:04] confidence because God said as I was
[40:05] with Moses I'll be with you but he still
[40:07] had a would have been still a a pressure
[40:10] because he had to finish his job they
[40:14] couldn't just that they couldn't just
[40:15] cross Jordan they had to go all the way
[40:17] they had to be placed in the land here
[40:19] defendant for Fuller's ministry
[40:21] hallelujah and thence in the Harriers he
[40:24] you know any and he gets up one morning
[40:25] he looks at Jericho now he knows in his
[40:28] mind
[40:28] do we have siege equipment no we have
[40:31] battering rams know there are siege
[40:33] towers no do you have catapults no do
[40:37] you have anything that can break these
[40:39] walls no what am I going to do then he's
[40:42] there he sees a man with a sword drawn
[40:44] but the pressure is about to come off
[40:46] here he sees the captain he says you for
[40:50] us or against us and God says I'm not
[40:52] for you against you I've come to take
[40:53] over this battle I come as the kept of
[40:56] the hosts of law amen so I'm not on your
[40:58] side you're on my side I mean that would
[41:00] lay off a lot of pressure I mean when he
[41:03] would have recognized god you're here I
[41:05] mean you've come as the cap to the Xhosa
[41:06] law and you're the general of this
[41:08] battle
[41:09] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[41:11] us friends individually or as families
[41:14] who's who's in charge of this battle are
[41:17] you in charge of the battle you're not
[41:18] in charge of the battle if you take it
[41:20] upon yourself a built pressure I mean
[41:22] but then if you know he's in charge it
[41:25] takes off a lot of pressure and you can
[41:26] let off the pressure hallelujah because
[41:29] if you know God is in control Amen just
[41:31] stay following him stay following him
[41:34] and he'll see you through hallelujah
[41:37] and that lets off pressure member
[41:39] because there is a pressure now because
[41:40] now we know there's a rapture and this
[41:42] go to 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 we
[41:45] know there's a rapture you know we know
[41:46] there's a Bride of Christ
[41:48] are you on that number amen and there's
[41:50] such a battle there's such a battle of
[41:52] muster I've heard it up your the last
[41:53] few weeks from a few people but am i
[41:55] worthy I'll tell you he makes you worthy
[41:59] and we read about the righteous run into
[42:01] the strong tower and a safe well well do
[42:04] I fit in that category because that's
[42:07] the big battle amen and I have that
[42:10] banner we all have that battle a my
[42:12] righteous am I do I actually warrant
[42:15] getting into the lid off the pressure I
[42:18] say yes yes
[42:20] by the authority of this I say yes by
[42:22] the message there I say yes hallelujah
[42:25] now as we're turning to first
[42:28] Thessalonians chapter 4 we read there
[42:31] and Luke 21 and I'll just read it
[42:36] quickly just - he says now and the cares
[42:43] of this life so that that day come upon
[42:46] you unawares it's verse 34 of Luke 21
[42:49] sits a warning pleased to come upon you
[42:52] I know it is but we have to understand
[42:55] and I trust we do understand if I can
[42:59] find this alone Ian's there Paul makes a
[43:02] promise to this age I'm glad we have a
[43:05] way of escape does that that should
[43:07] cause us to lid off the pressure I mean
[43:09] where God has opened the door come up
[43:12] hither hallelujah you know revelations
[43:16] four and one is after the last Church
[43:18] age where a door is open in heaven and
[43:20] John as a symbol of the bride has called
[43:22] up amen and we are trusting and say I'm
[43:26] John in the book of Revelation can you
[43:29] say you've got to be able to identify
[43:30] that's me he's talking about me I'm
[43:33] gonna fall fool what he what he wasn't
[43:35] prophecy I'm gonna fulfill
[43:37] hallelujah you gotta claim it name it
[43:39] and claim it that's just not some you
[43:41] know that's actually a scriptural thing
[43:43] your Caleb said give me this mountain
[43:46] this one that one there give it to me I
[43:48] want it he named didn't he claimed it
[43:52] you have to it's like it yo this is this
[43:56] is a will is it not this is a will and
[43:59] it sees to so-and-so is is this and if
[44:03] you're so so you're gonna say I want
[44:04] what's in the will give it to me by the
[44:07] authority of the lawyer it's mine
[44:10] amen now sorry I just lost my page
[44:14] first Thessalonians 4 now I love it we
[44:17] know we read we read the Bible many
[44:19] times and we think that chapter and
[44:21] verse is a change of thought many times
[44:24] but when Paul wrote the wrote the most
[44:28] well all of the Bible did not have
[44:30] chapter and verse it was just written
[44:33] okay so now we read here first
[44:35] Thessalonians 4 and we'll just read from
[44:38] from verse 15 for this we say unto you
[44:42] by the word of the Lord that we which
[44:44] are alive and remain until the coming of
[44:46] the Lord shall not prevent them which
[44:47] are asleep so there has to be a people
[44:50] which are alive physically alive and
[44:52] remaining and remaining is to remain in
[44:54] the truth in the faith of the father's
[44:56] and this Ministry of Malachi 4 has
[44:59] restored us to the faith of the fathers
[45:02] so we are remaining yes amen that's it
[45:07] that should make us very happy I am
[45:09] Alive and I remain amen to the chemical
[45:12] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[45:13] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[45:15] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[45:17] the Archangel the Trump of God and the
[45:19] dead in Christ shall rise first and we
[45:21] know that the shout is the message
[45:23] brother Graham says in the rapture
[45:24] message the message is the shower I mean
[45:27] so so he's not making you guess at it or
[45:29] think maybe he says the message is the
[45:31] shower holy so we're living in the
[45:34] scripture we've heard the shout I mean
[45:36] I'm sure you've heard that shot
[45:37] something in your soul said this is not
[45:39] this man speaking this as God has spoken
[45:42] hallelujah amen I'd say that should
[45:46] cause us the lid off the pressure then
[45:48] we which are alive and remain shall be
[45:49] caught up together with them in the
[45:51] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[45:53] so well so shall we ever be with
[45:56] the Lord wherefore comfort one another
[45:58] with these words now many times we think
[46:00] that's the end but but chapter 5 verse 1
[46:04] notice the first word of but which is a
[46:07] conjunction which binds what you've just
[46:09] read to what you're about to read but at
[46:11] the times and the seasons brethren you
[46:13] have no need that are write unto you for
[46:16] yourselves know perfectly that that day
[46:18] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[46:21] for the night for when they shall say
[46:23] peace and safety then sudden destruction
[46:25] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[46:28] with child and they shall not escape but
[46:31] ye brethren and not in darkness who's
[46:34] not in darkness
[46:35] this should let off the pressure you're
[46:37] not in darkness that that day should
[46:38] overtake you as a thief yeah all the
[46:41] children of light and the children of
[46:42] the day we are not of the night nor of
[46:45] darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[46:47] do others but let us watch and be sober
[46:49] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[46:51] and they that be drunken are drunken in
[46:53] the night but let us who are of the day
[46:55] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[46:58] faith and love and for the home at the
[47:00] hope of salvation for God has not
[47:02] appointed us now say for God has not
[47:05] appointed me God has not appointed me to
[47:09] wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[47:12] Lord Jesus Christ who died for us
[47:15] whether we should wake or sleep we
[47:17] should live together with him wherefore
[47:19] comfort ye comfort yourselves together
[47:21] and edify one another even also ye do
[47:24] hallelujah say saying you're not in
[47:26] darkness this day will not overtake you
[47:29] as a thief it's not going to come and go
[47:31] and you miss it but your children of the
[47:33] light hallelujah and never as a day is
[47:36] the lights on so bright as this day this
[47:39] glorious take that's more than a song I
[47:42] mean when brother Graham was standing
[47:44] and he'd preach a message Shalom God's
[47:46] peace be upon you holy and he speak
[47:49] about the light shining I meant how the
[47:51] word the word when it's manifested has
[47:53] made light and you go from now you go
[47:57] from Calvary when Jesus has lost you
[47:59] your days on earth multitude of
[48:02] Scripture was fulfilled
[48:04] the light was shining even in his last
[48:06] few minor moments a lot of prophecy was
[48:08] fulfilled and then there was a long
[48:10] period of a better fulfillment but a lot
[48:12] of tip a lot of waiting wasn't so bright
[48:14] and then God sends Elijah upon the earth
[48:17] and a multitude of scripture has been
[48:20] fulfilled in this day what's happening
[48:22] light is shone hallelujah so we're not
[48:25] children of darkness this should cause
[48:28] us to lid off the pressure I'm just
[48:29] going to list a whole bunch of things
[48:30] that they are caused us to lead off the
[48:32] pressure that means because what there
[48:34] are things that
[48:35] what's with him the good and honest
[48:37] think on these things hallelujah glory
[48:41] to God so now he says though and Luke
[48:45] chapter 21 we we read there he says
[48:49] watch your so verse verse 36 we read
[48:52] this in her opening Scripture but now
[48:54] here comes the challenge I said we
[48:56] because there's the battle where we
[48:58] think we're unworthy okay but the
[49:02] scripture tells us very plainly he has
[49:05] made us worthy okay so I'm just going to
[49:08] hopefully knock knock a leg out of this
[49:10] one because it's what we because if we
[49:13] don't have confidence with God we feel
[49:16] that we are unworthy to lay hold upon
[49:18] the promise if we feel we are unworthy
[49:21] then we feel we can't take hold of the
[49:23] promise because Who am I and then you
[49:26] could really say well Who am either the
[49:27] King of glory would die for amen so sees
[49:31] here now what she therefore and pray
[49:32] always that ye may be accounted worthy
[49:35] to escape all these things that shall
[49:37] come to pass and to stand before the Son
[49:40] of man so now so a challenge comes on
[49:43] and maybe you never realize this
[49:44] performance subconsciously as human
[49:46] beings we we look at ourselves and say
[49:49] but we're fallen as human beings you
[49:52] know we're unworthy to take the promise
[49:54] and many times we can look back and see
[49:56] what God has done for us that he's
[49:58] raised us up together I mean that we sit
[50:00] in heavenly places we've crossed the
[50:03] Jordan I mean we've you know we've come
[50:05] out of the world we've come through a
[50:07] wilderness with no we've been justified
[50:09] and sanctified the Jordan is a death
[50:11] itself we laid it all on the altar and
[50:13] now we're into the promised land
[50:15] amen do we not who's been there
[50:19] Amen but then now the challenges now but
[50:21] you've got to take the whole end and
[50:23] then now this is now now it comes to the
[50:25] pot oh now now how am I I'm unworthy to
[50:29] take it yeah I'm unworthy to take it now
[50:33] you've got to lay that aside because
[50:35] you've got to understand see see and
[50:38] you're in former ages it was always the
[50:41] works and the blood they separate until
[50:43] you go read the Philadelphia interchange
[50:45] like your Weasley bored out you know it
[50:47] was
[50:48] so it's your works and the blood of two
[50:49] separate things but brother Graham says
[50:51] in this in this age when this has come
[50:55] open a new book as count yes become a
[50:57] new book that's not your works and the
[50:59] blood it's all the blood I mean but your
[51:02] works are out of love what he did for
[51:03] you and if you're motivated by love it's
[51:06] not works hallelujah so now if it is all
[51:09] the blood now then we can rest in the
[51:12] assurance if he has washed us Amen if we
[51:15] are sinless you got a look what does he
[51:18] made me now this should let off the
[51:19] pressure I mean because where it says to
[51:21] have boldness because that you had to
[51:23] come before a throne of mercy and grace
[51:25] but then we say well am I where did it
[51:27] come before a throne absolutely Amen you
[51:31] know so we have the right he makes us by
[51:34] one offering he has perfected forever
[51:37] them that are sanctified it says the
[51:38] book of Hebrews by one offering not one
[51:40] every year
[51:41] not every Easter time or Sabbath or
[51:44] whatever it is by white offering he has
[51:46] perfected me hallelujah so now we can
[51:50] rest
[51:50] that is true it's true amen and then
[51:53] when God member we are called by him
[51:55] because where we were predestinated by
[51:57] him remember when he hung when he hung
[52:00] on Calvary he wasn't thinking
[52:02] I'll make some people maybe feel sorry
[52:04] for me and they'll give their lives to
[52:06] me and they'll serve me no Sarah I mean
[52:08] he knew he knew who was going to serve
[52:10] him he knew down through 7 Church ages
[52:13] he knew you'd be here glory to God
[52:15] I mean he knew you'd be here he knew
[52:17] that when your word his word came across
[52:19] your path Amen you'd give it give your
[52:21] life it may have been struggles who
[52:23] cares about the struggles what are you
[52:25] now instead of what you were hallelujah
[52:28] so now he knew in his mind before the
[52:30] foundation of world he thought of you
[52:32] amen and his thoughts towards you are a
[52:35] peace there good thoughts hallelujah I
[52:38] mean so if he thought of you as being
[52:41] redeemed maintenance image hallelujah
[52:45] washed in his blood sinless perfect I
[52:47] mean he became sin that we'd become his
[52:50] righteousness this should lead off the
[52:51] pressure I mean because of he met you
[52:54] once why does he seal you into the
[52:56] kingdom he claims you he says this is my
[52:59] property
[53:00] seyton they don't belong to you they
[53:02] never belong to you I mean they just
[53:04] have to recognize they're my children
[53:07] hallelujah
[53:08] so now we are having sailed into the
[53:10] kingdom he's put a brand upon you
[53:12] hallelujah he sealed you and saying this
[53:14] is mine
[53:15] I mean good luck trying to take take his
[53:18] things away from him I wouldn't try and
[53:21] take try and take anything from him well
[53:23] I want anyone to a try hallelujah sly
[53:27] brother brems says about you you're an
[53:29] eagle takes his little eaglets you know
[53:31] from the nest flies down to the meadows
[53:33] you know they jump off they have a
[53:35] little Pentecostal revival there she
[53:37] flies up and looks over there and and
[53:39] then he says therefore coyote comes
[53:41] after one of those you're one of those
[53:44] eaglets that eagle mama Eagle flogged
[53:46] him to death
[53:47] and he says woe unto you your Satan
[53:49] comes against one of God's children he's
[53:51] got Jesus Christ on his hands I mean you
[53:53] got to remember that the enemies ask you
[53:55] howler he's got Jesus Christ on his
[53:57] hands and no one you know my daddy is
[54:00] bigger than anyone elses daddy
[54:01] hallelujah my daddy's way bigger than
[54:04] all the daddies in the world hallelujah
[54:07] my daddy you beat up all the daddies
[54:09] amen bet you'd lead off the pressure
[54:13] hallelujah so we're children of the
[54:15] light amen glory to God now so that we
[54:23] would be counted worthy now let's go to
[54:25] I want to go to revelations chapter 19
[54:28] because everything you just think now
[54:31] here we are we here we are in this age
[54:36] and of God
[54:38] remember God doesn't enforce something
[54:40] upon you without giving you the ability
[54:43] to do it
[54:43] amen he never says God go God become my
[54:48] bride without preparing anything I mean
[54:51] he's already got everything sorted out
[54:53] hallelujah just like Abraham when he
[54:55] said Eliezer to go get Rebekah all the
[54:58] all the welfare Abraham was when on
[55:00] those camels
[55:01] he said the servant the trusted servant
[55:03] everything was prepared
[55:04] I mean Sarah's ten was still there
[55:06] hallelujah for the Union wind when
[55:08] Rebecca comes back amen
[55:11] everything was prepared
[55:13] hallelujah and now it's the same in this
[55:15] age because he's calling a bride he's
[55:17] called the bride through all the other
[55:18] ages but this one's gonna be in his full
[55:21] image
[55:22] I meant we're going to grow to the
[55:24] fullest of the statue of Christ he
[55:26] promised it hallelujah so now if that's
[55:29] the case he must prepare us amen so
[55:32] revelations 19 and verse 1 let's just
[55:36] read this whole thing because I love it
[55:37] house is a lujah cuz that's us after
[55:40] these things I heard a great voice of
[55:41] much people in heaven saying Alleluia
[55:44] salvation and glory and honor and power
[55:46] unto the Lord our God for true and
[55:49] righteousness are his judgments for he
[55:50] has judged the great which did
[55:52] corrupt the earth with her fornication
[55:53] at it and hath avenged the blood of his
[55:56] servants at her hand and again they said
[55:58] I'll lujah and her smoke rose up for
[56:00] ever and ever so when the enemies cast
[56:02] into the lake of fire coming hallelujah

[56:07] to say then and foreign 20 elders are we

[56:37] glory to God
[56:39] amen and four and twenty elders and the
[56:42] four beasts fell down to worship God who
[56:44] sat on the throne saying amen Alleluia
[56:46] and a voice came out of the throne
[56:48] saying praise our God all ye servants
[56:50] and ye that fear and both small and
[56:51] great and I heard as it were the voice
[56:54] of a great multitude and as the voice of
[56:56] many waters and as the voice of mighty
[56:58] thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord
[57:01] God omnipotent reigneth now we know that
[57:03] voice of many waters
[57:04] I mean s people's multitudes nations and
[57:07] tongues I mean so our voice is part of
[57:09] that saying Alleluia for the Lord our

[59:51] rest if you received the Holy Ghost you
[59:53] are arrayed in fine linen clean and what
[59:55] and remember a wife in the scripture is
[59:58] very different to a girlfriend or a
[1:00:00] fiancee I mean because now our wife is
[1:00:03] the only one legally that can be the
[1:00:06] child amen so so a girlfriend a fiance
[1:00:10] they can have some nice gifts but they
[1:00:12] can't legally have bring forth the life
[1:00:14] you follow me but a wife can actually
[1:00:17] it's more than picking up a nice piece
[1:00:19] of jewelry they can pick up a baby and
[1:00:21] say who does it look like looks like him
[1:00:24] looks like my husband amen it's the same
[1:00:27] thing with us now there's a life in us

[1:00:33] producing a life hallelujah
[1:00:35] and it looks like him hallelujah he
[1:00:39] followed me that's what's so different
[1:00:41] between ER between a flirt or fiance or
[1:00:43] a girlfriend and someone who's been
[1:00:45] United Amen it produces a life
[1:00:47] hallelujah and that's why it's so
[1:00:50] glorious you just let him live once in a
[1:00:52] while let him live all the time and you
[1:00:55] see your life begins to move in a very
[1:00:56] different kind of direction hallelujah
[1:01:00] hey man that's glorious that should
[1:01:03] cause you to live off the pressure
[1:01:04] Amen when you look in the you know when
[1:01:07] you look in the mirror who do you see
[1:01:11] you know time what is time it's kind of
[1:01:16] hebrews chapter 2 you know time is
[1:01:18] running out for a lot of things and
[1:01:23] that's a good thing when it's time shall
[1:01:27] be no more I'll say glory hallelujah
[1:01:29] hallelujah amen now time time is here
[1:01:37] because of sin we know that eternity
[1:01:41] plus N equals time I'll put it that way
[1:01:43] so if you take away sin it goes back
[1:01:45] there's no more time but now we are
[1:01:48] manifested in this time in this little
[1:01:50] hickey of time
[1:01:52] for for two purposes one is that God
[1:01:57] with all his attributes of being a
[1:01:59] redeemer and a kinsman and a husband and
[1:02:01] a healer and a guide and a redeemer and
[1:02:03] a comfort and a advocate and everything
[1:02:06] that he is would be expressed to you I
[1:02:08] mean so the devil actually did your
[1:02:10] favor when he when he caused the fall to
[1:02:12] happen because God couldn't reveal the
[1:02:15] fullness of himself to Adam and Eve if
[1:02:17] they're in a perfect state so God
[1:02:19] allowed the fall to happen that he could
[1:02:20] fully reveal that's why it's actually
[1:02:21] such a glorious thing I'm sick you
[1:02:24] should say hallelujah God you can show
[1:02:27] yourself as a healer to me amen Lord I'm
[1:02:30] losing my way hallelujah you can trim me
[1:02:32] as a guide hallelujah amen I feel very
[1:02:35] stressed and worried glory you can show
[1:02:37] me as a company you can show yourself as
[1:02:39] a comforter to me Amen you say well let
[1:02:42] the earth that's why count it all joy
[1:02:43] when you try by fiery trials and all
[1:02:47] these things you say thank you Lord
[1:02:48] because you're going to reveal yourself
[1:02:49] to me in this in some way hallelujah
[1:02:52] take the three Hebrew children they
[1:02:55] didn't see the fourth man outside they
[1:02:57] didn't see the fourth band before the
[1:02:59] decree went forth you know that everyone
[1:03:01] had to worship the image they didn't see
[1:03:02] the fourth man when they're standing
[1:03:04] there before the king saying we will not
[1:03:06] bow to your image if we die we die if we
[1:03:08] live we live they didn't sit but in the
[1:03:11] midst of the trial when they're in the
[1:03:13] furnace that's when they saw the fourth
[1:03:15] man and you got to think about it now
[1:03:18] would they trade that for the world no
[1:03:20] sir
[1:03:21] hallelujah because that member the fire
[1:03:23] all the fire did was loose their beds
[1:03:25] that's all the trial did was loose
[1:03:28] they're banned see how the lujah and
[1:03:30] it's the same thing with us all trials
[1:03:33] are good just say praise God I don't
[1:03:37] know what's going to happen tomorrow
[1:03:38] hallelujah Amen things are going
[1:03:40] sideways you're the shepherd hallelujah
[1:03:43] if he tried to guide any sheep without
[1:03:45] yo I remember my brother and I we were
[1:03:48] we were about you guys aged over there
[1:03:51] on my uncle's cattle farm
[1:03:53] I mean sheep sheep and deer station and
[1:03:56] the back road from Wilder gisbert where
[1:03:59] nowhere a quad bike 500 sheep take them
[1:04:03] down this road into this paddock
[1:04:05] it's not that it's just a road it's not
[1:04:07] that easy you gotta go up here chase
[1:04:10] them down this bank and go here and did
[1:04:11] it you know you gotta guide them and a
[1:04:14] Shepherd

[1:04:27] going sideways Lord you're my shepherd
[1:04:29] Here I am that's not crazy I don't think
[1:04:36] Amen now
[1:04:37] Hebrews do time so time the first thing
[1:04:42] that time was manifested for was to
[1:04:45] reveal himself to you the second thing
[1:04:48] was he would destroy the devil I mean
[1:04:51] that's why time is here now let's read
[1:04:53] here I love to Hebrews 2 but we'll just
[1:04:56] read this is read from verse 9 and then
[1:04:59] we'll go down to verse 15 but we see
[1:05:02] Jesus who was made a little lower than
[1:05:03] the Angels for the suffering of death
[1:05:06] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[1:05:09] the grace of God should taste death for
[1:05:11] every man for became him for whom are
[1:05:14] all things and by whom are all things
[1:05:16] and bringing many sons unto glory to be
[1:05:20] made the captain of their salvation
[1:05:21] perfect through sufferings for both he
[1:05:25] that sanctifies and they who are
[1:05:27] sanctified are all of one for which
[1:05:30] cause he has not ashamed to call them
[1:05:31] brethren call you brethren Alleluia
[1:05:35] saying I will declare thy name and to my
[1:05:38] brethren in the midst of the church will
[1:05:40] I sing praise unto thee and again I'll
[1:05:42] put my trust in him and again behold I
[1:05:45] and the children with God has given me
[1:05:48] for as much sin as the children are
[1:05:50] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[1:05:52] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:05:55] that through death he might destroy him
[1:05:58] that had the power of death that is the
[1:06:00] devil and deliver them who through fear
[1:06:03] of death were all their lifetime subject
[1:06:05] to bondage I mean so he took on the form
[1:06:09] here to come unto time to redeem you and
[1:06:13] to destroy his enemy Amy that's why this
[1:06:16] time
[1:06:17] and that's why timers you know that's
[1:06:19] why it sees in Revelation chapter 12
[1:06:21] then you know the devil has been cast
[1:06:23] out upon the earth you know well let's

[1:06:54] from 7 to 12 I'm glad because the devil
[1:06:58] wherever is he loses early let's read
[1:07:01] and there was war in heaven Michael and
[1:07:04] his angels fought against the Dragon and
[1:07:05] the dragon dragon fought and his angels
[1:07:07] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:07:10] place found any more in heaven that
[1:07:11] should lead off the pressure because if
[1:07:13] he lost there he's gonna lose here and
[1:07:15] because the same God that defeated my
[1:07:17] fear has come down down to human flesh
[1:07:19] to defeat him here hallelujah that
[1:07:21] should make us lid off the pressure and
[1:07:23] the Great Dragon was cast out that old

[1:07:27] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:07:28] out into the earth and his angels were
[1:07:30] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[1:07:32] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:07:34] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[1:07:37] of our God and the power was Christ for
[1:07:39] the accuser of our brethren is cast down
[1:07:41] which accused them before our God day

[1:07:48] interstage left right of Christ you this
[1:07:52] is your cue and they overcame him by the
[1:07:54] blood of the Lamb and the word of their
[1:07:56] testimony and they loved not their lives
[1:07:58] unto the death therefore rejoice ye
[1:08:00] heavens and ye that dwell in them amen
[1:08:03] we live in him where I lifted up the
[1:08:05] heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're
