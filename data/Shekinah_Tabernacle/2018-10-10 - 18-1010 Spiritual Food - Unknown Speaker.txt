musicians I mean good evening everyone amen praise the Lord you've got your Bibles handy let's go to to Luke chapter 4 Amen what a wonderful day we live in they look for we're gonna read fairly lengthy scripture reading when I read from verse 14 down to verse 32 of Luke chapter 4 cease hearing Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a fame of him throughout all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as this custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place ruin it was where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of a sight to the blind and who sit at liberty them that are bruised excuse me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day as the scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son and he said unto them ye will surely sound to me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum do also hear in thy country and he said verily I say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country but I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the days of a when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when a great famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was a liar sent save unto sir sorry / a city of Sidon unto a woman that was a widowed now remember she's a Gentile and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elias and Elias the prophet and none of them were cleanse saying saving naming the Syrian another Gentile and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath and rose up and thrust them out of the city and led him and to the brow the hill we're on their city was built that they might cast them down headlong but he passed through the midst of them winters way and came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee and taught them on the Sabbath days and they are astonished at his doctrine for his word was worth power amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this night now like to I'd like to speak about spiritual food and Jew season an amazing scene we you know it always astounds me reading reading the scene you know we're just going to go through it a bit but what an incredible scene we have here here is the Messiah standing in the synagogue identifying himself in the scripture he's pointing to the the word he is to fulfill in that day an hour as we read he found the place in the Book of Isaiah swear it was written so you didn't just haphazardly reader read a verse but he found the place that was written and he read exactly the the portion of that scripture that was allotted to us first coming because if you go read where we are that portion of Isaiah is from he doesn't read the second part of verse 19 but he leaves it for a second coming which is the Stace one incredible scene that says he's a the Word made flesh is identifying himself in the written word but notice it does not people it doesn't make the people happy they're not rejoicing there's not a spontaneous hallelujah mighty Jehovah God has become our Messiah reason our Mets the word us fulfilled the very Messiah we're looking for is here it didn't make them happy they were angry they were angry at him and now notice Jesus did not bring his own Scrolls he did not bring his own holy books he did not bring anything else he read from the same Bible they read right so he was he was reading exactly the same Bible they read and it was the Word made flesh was reading the written word the prophecy concerning the day he was living in and what he was to fulfill and that made them mad so they were he was reading the same Bible they read no doubt they would have read that scriptures many times before but this was a different kind of day because now was more than an idea it had become flesh it was more than a and debate and what do you think this you know how do you think this will happen do you think what happened in our lifetime you know how is this all going to transpire it goes beyond that he says this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears so he's saying that what I have just read has become flesh in front of you hallelujah he's saying that I am the fulfillment of this portion of scripture that I have just read and it made them mad now one was saying mistakes the Scriptures fulfilled see they came they both read the same Bible but they both came to two different conclusions from reading the same scripture one said this data scripture is fulfilled in your ears this is the fulfillment Here I am and the other by their response was saying no it's not doesn't matter what their theory was of it they're basically saying no you're not it and now how can this be multitudes read the same Bible we read we don't have a different Bible we don't have the william branham version of the bible we have the King James Bible that's been here for 400 years give or take I don't know how long you know so we all have the same scripture even if we had different versions they still really basically say the same thing so but how can people come to two radically different conclusions and it's very simple it's God reveals the truth of a scripture to her me well he reveals it to whom he will he blinds whom he will he quickens who he will he bypasses who he will he's God he's sovereign I just be thankful Lord you chose me I'm glad you chose me you open your word to me that makes me happy hallelujah Jesus says in Matthew chapter 11 he says that these things so let's just go there shall we just as I'm fighting with an iPad it's childproof I'll get the other he says in Matthew chapter 11 Henry and in verse 25 he says at that time jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes so he says he's heading these from some and revealed it to others that's God's choosing you know the Bible is not a textbook you can't send an exam to see through to know the author you know the Word of God never comes to a Bible School right and ever speaks out of a Bible School will come to up let's just read it now second Peter 1 and verses 20 and 21 it says knowing this first that no that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation okay and now here's the answer the reason it's not of any private interpretation is shown in the next verse for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so he's saying it's not private interpretation they didn't work it out you know like Moses Moses didn't sit there in Egypt and plant a whole bunch of laws he didn't say well I'm the deliverer us I need to our nation's are going to come out of a nation they're going to dwell in the promised land so I've got to work out a system of laws that this nation can live by that's not what he did he went up Mount Sinai the Spirit of God moved upon him he said thus saith the Lord when you come into land you do this when this happens you do this this is how you should be yo he was moved by the Holy Spirit and he sprang it wasn't his thoughts it was God's thoughts right brother Ram said I wanted to be a trapper and this wasn't even my idea it was God's thoughts right God making himself known that's why the Bible is not a private interpretation because it's men of all were moved amen by the Holy Spirit so they spake as God spake through them as God moved upon them they spake up I mean the inspiration they received so the word is heading to the eyes of wise and prudent revealed unto babes now you would think standing in a synagogue they're all expecting a messiah they're all looking for him to come you think you know they're all reading the same Bible you would think that they would say yes you are this one hallelujah they could have just asked around a bit ask for some testimony they could have gone to the woman at the well woman at the well what happened to you one day I was bound I had a man I had a love problem I couldn't find love and I was married and divorced and married and divorced and eventually I quit I just live with a person I was wounded right because of my first relationship I was wounded I was bruised I was bound by that wounding in my spirit but he set me free sit at Liberty them and Oh Bruce I was set free hallelujah I received that ministry in now I'm free Oh Louie they could have just see that because brother branham tells a very very simply God interpreters word by bringing it to pass you know God tells Abraham you're my see thy seed is going to sowed you in a strange land four hundred years I'll bring them out with a mighty hand right they'll come back to this place again God interprets it by bringing talking to Moses in a burning bush commissioning him with two signs goes down to Egypt he's the fulfillment or the interpretation of that prophecy God interprets it God said a virgin shall conceive she did and when she didn't you too need to interpret it it was manifested voice one voice one crying in the wilderness Amen you don't need to interpret it God God interpreted his word he comes the Messiah God interpreted the prophecy of the Messiah hallelujah same thing all the way down through amen now we understand that the Bible is is divinely inspired and as we read on the church what's Happ you've got to get in the same inspiration John in the book of Revelation I've got three thank you water Amen god bless a good deacon he always looks after you Allu yeah amen so you got to get John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and if you want to see anything by God you're going to get in the spirit right you can't see it cuddly you got to get in the under under the inspiration and the one who wrote the word you get into the spirit then you'll begin to see what the word says right he sees an Isaiah 29 verse the ayah says stay yourselves and wonder cry out and cry they a drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep now I'm not talking about you right you take the opposite of the scripture the bride's eyes are open right we're not blind and we have been given I save holy and we're not naked I'm in spurts there anyway we're clothed in his righteousness our eyes have come open I mean we're being anointed with ice em that we see hallelujah so but so this is speaking of a different group of people they stagger but not with strong drink for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers and says he covered and the vision of all has become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which mean deliver one that has learned saying read this I pray thee says I cannot for it sealed and the book is delivered to him that's not learned saying read this I pray that he says I'm not learned wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouths and their lips to honor me but they have removed their heart far from me and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men see your heart your whole heart has to be towards the Lord you have to thirst and desire after more than anything else when he goes becomes first place in your life then you he'll meet you when you seek me with your whole heart you shall find me right so it can't just be a partial thing on the side it's going to be your whole heart has the desire and longed for him that you can't risk your stirred up oh I've got to meet him I've got to have a meeting Lord I got to know my sins are washed away I'm not satisfied with this condition and you know you can't just sit back you're gonna really pursue and I mean I first is a painful desire and the scripture is a painful painful I can't just I can't just put up with this thirst I gotta meet it it's got to be the saddest you know it's going to be satisfied hallelujah now the book to the bride is not a vision that is sealed but has come open write the Bible brother BAM says after the seals open the Bible became a new book and I trust it became a new book to you when you met the Lord it's no longer a book of history a book a parables a book of ethics or morals as Jesus Christ made known hallelujah well I remember when I when the Lord was dealing with me know over eleven years ago I was reading first your sick and Peter it wasn't and I'd read that scripture before cuz I'd read the entire Bible through by that stage but when I was reading at that time Peter was writing personally to me it was not Peter to someone else that was Peter to me he was at my dress he was writing it to me and the whole Bible became personal to me hallelujah I'm glad the Bible becomes new glory to God we don't liver this is not a dead book there's a Living Word only if you're under the same anointing as the word it becomes alive to you amen but in a more sane eleven now before I go into this notice it's amazing how Jesus when he when he stands in identifies the son of man identifies himself in the word saying this day the Scriptures fulfill notice how he it's amazing how he taste this fulfillment of Scripture and then he speaks to the ones that he came to but but rejected him and he tied it to a meeting a would a woman in a time of famine that that Elijah did so he ties it to that and he ties it to name in the Syrian who had leprosy so he's saying now I've come and now it's exactly the same a prophet is not accepted in his own country so I go to another so the ones that should receive me reject me and the ones are not really looking for me they find me hallelujah so now here it is where so so he ties these two together now Elijah we know he went in before I had a says there won't be rain or Dew until I fall I mean until I call for it and he just storms out and he's looked after by the brook and then eventually that dries up and God tells them now you go to a different country you leave Israel you go to a place of the Gentiles now this is talkie of you right this is not as just it's more than a story you're the widow woman you'll need your you're naman as well we were once the enemies of God we're once his enemy but he reconciled us holy just like name it was the enemy of Israel holy but he received healing there are many lepers in a man's day he wasn't the only leper in the place there pletely in Jerusalem plenty in the promised land but God's God healed another one he bypassed all the likely candidates and went to another one who was an enemy hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I I mean we're once his enemy God my possible to choose to get you right God by bus multitudes to find you hallelujah that's why we should rejoice Lord you Piper I don't know why you bypass them but I say thank you you found me that's the main thing people say well it's not fair there'll be a few I'm glad I'm one of the few hallelujah I'm glad I'm one of them that's like brother Chris said last few years ago it's like imagine this three monkeys going up the ramp and I was like and you the third monkey right you don't want to sit back and say well I guess I won't make it no one of those monkeys has to go hallelujah if there's - boy monkeys that boy that other boy monkeys off I'm in hallelujah you know to me you got a you know you just got to be glad and once you're in you're in oh yeah the fight the kingdom came to God the violent take it by force what away what's in there for me you see people on a sail you see people on earth was a Black Friday or you know some special sale they're queued up before the doors open some camp overnight to get the first spot and then even before the doors are even opening they're trying to brush them down I want my special I want that thing and they have it in their mind I need this TV on and they don't really need it but they need it but there something in them says I want this right they want it I want the special I got the money it's on and I know where it is in the store and you know they do and if there's only one left who seen it people fight they people fight over stuff they're aggressive it's this have you seen there's just natural things just natural things and the warranty will be void you will expire the single die and they'll be back the next year probably but we have eternal things we have eternal things and God's great big our cake brother Graham says as the word is a great bigger cake you're going to go in and see what belongs to you I mean walking through the front doors is enough for me I don't you understand in the foyer where this cheap stuff on special I want to go back into the back shelf the stuff that's really I want right it should be the same way shouldn't be we have a treasure chest holy or we've been given all things I don't just want to walk in you know they design stores that you can't just walk in and walk out anymore you got to go around your walk into my tatin or wherever the exits are you got to go around through the checkouts or a supermarket they try and do it the same way because there's those barrier things you know those things you push through you can't just turn around and get out through them you gotta you know because they want you to buy something I've never seen really so I'm walking with a list I need all anything they go out they get what they need how about you in the Lord we have a list the other list I've got things I need family that don't know you burdens for people healing restoration I want more of him I want another outpouring of aspart I'm not satisfied with what I have I want more of you Lord I want your word to open hallelujah I wanna see beyond the veil honestly that they take from your word this is the spirit searches out the deep things right that you ignore the heights the depth the breadth and the length the whole dimensions of the kingdom of God hallelujah I say Lord give me a deep a great a deep calling because there's a there's a deep there's a deep to respond to that call hallelujah but season Amos 8:11 says behold the days come saith the Lord God that I'll send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst of water but of the hearing of the words of the Lord it's a notice it doesn't say a famine for Bibles or man's opinion or commentaries or systematic theology none of those things it's hearing the words of the Lord so God's divine revelation of his word there'll be a famine for that right it comes that day and we are living in that day we are living you could spend more than one lifetime just on YouTube trying to find the truth and good luck well I'm just going to find it good luck trying to find it the truth has to find you right God I hunted Adam in the garden Adam where are you the truth found Adam hallelujah the truth dealt with Adam right the truth has to find you and deal with you hallelujah now I'm glad we're living in a time we may be living in a time of famine the world is but the bride is description the Song of Solomon he brought me into his banqueting house and his banner over me is love hallelujah and he and he prepares me a table in the presence of mine enemies hallelujah so now there's a place of feasting right there's a place of feasting we have a feast we have a spiritual feast hallelujah not just a little lettuce leaf kind of word within a seven course meal right we have a sieve and sealed menu we have everything the whole buffet what do you want it's a continental Plus you know it's not just a potato the word is the whole thing as I said you're a few months ago I said imagine if you have a banquet and the person walks in and they're just on their phone and the corn are not interested they say what is wrong with that person but the person that comes in saying I'm hungry fill me up I already have more than first I want to go to double digits hallelujah I would eat everything I want to try it all a bit of this brothers brothers and go back again a bit more and then we're because it always fits in and you see them like it really you go bus get the stretcher team to carry them out you think that person's had a great feast hallelujah and that's how it should be with the word this should excite you the word should excite you you know we were reading I've got it in the here but we were reading where Jesus has taken Jesus has taken us as and look to Jesus has taken to the temple no he's he's eight days all these circumcised they're going to give the offering of the of the pigeons for him and then there's some people in there there's two in the tip here's the temple just think about this here's the temple the center of their religion rule the offerings are the high priest everything there to catch it Andrew God reveals it to two and here's his Simon and the Lord quickened to him he will not die until he has seen the Lord's Christ and he's an old man hallelujah you know then the Bible this is hardly this is for free now in the Bible I hope the word hope in the Bible actually is an expectation it's not a hope like I trust none of you do and you shouldn't but people that buy a lot of tickets they hope they'll win the lotto there's not an expectation is just a hope it's just a stab in the dark but in the Bible of hope is an expectation and I was thinking Christ in you the hope of glory or Christ in you the expectation of glory hallelujah expectation I've been put under expectation hallelujah I'm gonna walk on streets ago cuz Christ is in me hallelujah Amen should they give you the expectation what do you mean a I've heard a rapture call let's just rejoice Polly you mean I've heard a bridegroom cool I've been United with my bridegroom Holly I'm going to I'm going to a wedding feast jesus paid it all I don't have to try and bargain him with him Lowell Lord I do this and Laura third listener he paid it all I'm not trusting in me I'm trusting in him we're resting on it hallelujah say Simon he will not taste death until he has seen the Lord's Christ and then he come here comes Mary here comes Joseph they joined the queue they weren't the only ones there here was the temple where everyone came he's a lot of people around it and here here they came they just looked like the rest of the poor because not everyone could present a land and have enough money to buy the land they said the turtledoves or the two pigeons so here they come and God speaks to Simon he's there think about it let's just go back there you've been told you're going to seen the Lord's Christ and then there comes a day something in you says he's here where is he you start walking you see the lighting of women I don't know how they did it orderly probably some some way it's something in you sissies here where is he I want to see him and then something brings you draws you to one you pick him up he picks him up it's his Lord let thy servant now depart in peace for I've seen thy salvation hallelujah he talked about our rejoicing hallelujah he is under expectation mention that he's here where is he I want to see him oh hi hmmm I'm carrying I'm looking into his face hallelujah hallelujah and you know we have we have seen the Lord salvation in the state this message is the Lord salvation holy and now we can depart in peace for I beheld thy salvation holy I've seen Messire in this day hallelujah that's something we're shouting him we have something we're shouting about Aliyah amen you know it's Easter season the third seal there's a voice comes out of the midst of the throne touching up the oil and the wine so the Antichrist is riding forth on a black horse with a pair of scales measure wheat for a barley half a penny for whatever but there's a voice that comes out of the throne touchy not the oil on the wine and God is giving instruction do not restrict my anointing do not restrict the stimulation by revelation it's gonna pour out free Satan you can't bind my revelation you can't bind the stimulation you can't hold my children back they get a rejoice hallelujah and it should be poured out an abundance and that's what it is being done hallelujah so I'll tell you what we don't have this obscure it I mean but sometimes when you and my very BC days I'm glad they're in the sea goes forgetfulness you don't have a lot to drink sometimes you got to drink it sparingly we don't have to live that way not with this wine parlor you know with this wine hallelujah drink it all hallelujah glory to God hallelujah yeah the devil likes us to be reserved oh yeah I've seen the quietest nerdiest people you get a few in the Miss Xiao ting holy there's just under natural wine they start talking you say weirdly with that person's be saving up their words for a long time they using them all right now because they forget who they are they're not worried they're relaxed early we should be the same way should we I mean we should just rejoice you say well a lot of things are going on but jesus never did anything bad to you I mean we don't worship I don't worship God because of situation I worship God because of who he is what he's done for me he's always done good things he's still doing good things for me and the LEAs we just worship because of that and you worthy yes he yes he's worthy as they glorious yes he's glorious isn't he all together lovely absolutely hallelujah so we're not living in a time of famine notice Elijah was seat to the widow woman she only had enough she had enough meal and oil we're gonna make a cake I'm gonna feed it to my son then we're gonna die but she was she was told by the Prophet make me one first for thus saith the Lord the meal will not go empty the cruiser all won't run dry and he did exactly that hallelujah and they were now sustained through the famine right they didn't run out how many do you want today Oh hallelujah you know this there's actually believers there's a counselor hood brother bus cool share testimony Vindhya believers there same thing happened to them they have a meal barrow they have oil it just keeps just keeps pouring out hello yeah some but friends there's more than natural food there's a supernatural food it doesn't run out it doesn't get stale it doesn't get common this bread is wonderful hallelujah it's the best kind of bread hey man it keeps getting better and richer and wonderful amen jesus said I am the bread of heaven I'm the bread that came down from heaven hallelujah and we get to eat that bread see he sees that in John 6 I'm the bread that I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and neither believe in me shall never thirst hallelujah so what is he saying this bread won't run out and the drink won't run out you'll never hungry you'll never thirst you always be satisfied but then you'll always want more too but that initial thirst and hunger will be satisfied you know how you know you just sometimes he's just something you really like it's like y'all could squeeze a bit more and but you know you can't be you wonder right because it's so good you following me you say wait I'm not joking you know this is how the word the wood should be like honey in the rock how they should be wonderful to you I mean when all things because what your what your comforters really is your religion what your comfort is if your comfort if your comfort is the Internet that's what your religion will be or some entertainment or whatever it may be movies music some fantasy of being something or other that becomes your comfort you start to worship that you want to become it thou art my comfort more than life you are to meet you Lord hallelujah amen but you always want to fit the extra burden but with this you never regret it hallelujah oh yeah doesn't make you sick amen the Bible says in Psalm 16:11 that will show me the path of life in my presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand are pleasures forevermore so Anna's presence is the fullness of joy not a little bit of the fullness of joy everything joy is you can barely contain yourself hallelujah so he will show me the path of life he has showed us the path of life in his word right and it's more than just mentally knowing it he puts you on that path he quickens you to his word and you're on the path hallelujah and in his presence is the fullness of joy so now in this time of famine Elijah goes to the widow woman a Gentile bypasses all the other widows in Israel goes to a Gentile and they survive the famine hallelujah and this word maybe the Prophet represents the word Amen she wasn't looking for him he just was seen her way and brother Brahim says about that widow woman she was the same caliber as the Prophet the same kind of callable person right and it's the same thing we said well what's that got to do with you the wordless Jesus has come to you right the bridegroom has come to you he's made himself real to you right has he not he's made himself known to you and he's come to you because you are the same kind of caliber as he is hallelujah you know it says in 1st Corinthians 11:1 our preacher says the the woman is the glory of the man hallelujah that's what it says in 1st Corinthians 11 the woman is the glory of the man hallelujah so now when he redeemed us he washed us he transformed us he says look at my glory earlier we know that you downtrodden a bunch of people he lifts up his bride look at my glory Satan she's wonderful she's with that spot she doesn't belong to you she has no part of you at all hallelujah should be the same thing us us us men who are married look at my glory hallelujah

doesn't share us with any devices of the world she belongs we belong to him he's jealous over his bride he is absolutely jealous over you hallelujah he's not haphazard nonchalant whatever you want to call it he's very jealous over you I mean he's cause nation's to fall nations to rise technology to be made that you had be reached hallelujah he literally has moved earth for his bride to come to their position he said oh I don't know if that's so look at Israel because the world to go to war for them to be in the homeland again he calls that nation to be birthed a certain way that they'll stand alone when the crunch comes they will stand alone and it should be the same thing with us we've been birthed out of the world Great Tribulation came upon our lives and something innocence is going to be a place for us there's going to be a homeland and our homeland is the Word of God let's come open holy and something brought us back to the homeland and now we say this is our identity this is where we belong and we've got to remember now we came out with great affliction we're not going to give this up we're not going to give our homeland up we will stand on the word it is our heritage when are given up for nothing hallelujah and they're active I got sent a video a while ago there are some Jews in Israel and they have their own fields and they grow there and wait for the kosher but it happened that because you know every seventh year they leave their fields fellow they don't cultivate it all according to the law so all their fields were fellow so they were looking for other wheat that was raised the same way they they raised it they found a field on the Gaza Israel border and so they and so they bought the region they harvested it the next day or a couple of days after that terrorists from from Gaza came up out of tunnels in those fields and in 90 seconds there was air strikes and they were wiped out now they tunneled into that wheat field because they saw there's wheat we can come up and we can crawl into it get into the population therein wreak havoc but those Jews harvested the wheat so when they came out of the field I mean into the fields just to be a patch but the Israeli defense is so active 90 seconds is an air strike they have they have active defense watching their borders they're not just asleep waiting for things to they're actively they have they had a blimp up in the air with cameras and everything people on the ground as soon as they came out there was an alert was sent and off they were gone we should be the same way we

people say about him you know imagine if you know someone comes up to me and says a whole bunch of horrible stuff about my wife I say you don't know what you're talking about she's true she's faithful she's loving she's kind her testimonies are true I would just say them what are you talking about you don't know that I know I'm married to her hallelujah amen that's when people come against you sir all this business just list the word listen does it say hold on that's not the god I know that's not the Lord Jesus I know there's not the one that walks with me I don't know what kind of glasses you're looking through but I'm wearing his ring he took all my sins away he's never done anything bad for me he's only done good for me and all he did was open his word show me where I am show me where I'm going show me I'm in a rapture season show me my sins are all taken care of show me that the cross paid at all and I don't need to fear I don't need to worry I'm on my way oh yeah that's what he means to me I pray it he means that much to you why'd he get emotional anything without emotion as did the prophets ease did things get buried right but something with life has feeling has emotion I believe in a half out religion don't you hallelujah prophet sure did now we've been brought to his banqueting house and his banner of me was love and when I read this I thought of so David made a pact with us with his friends saw Jonathan and in David becomes king and in David says to his servants are any of any of Josh Jonathan's household still alive and then and then word comes back to him yes his son mephibosheth is still alive and in he says bring him here he comes from a furbish youth he's crippled he's crippled when he was when when word came to him or came to his nurse because he was a little boy when it happened when when word nurse that is father Jonathan and his grandfather King Saul were did in battle they fled for their lives and he was dropped and he may and he got crippled in his legs and he comes and crutches before his king and the King thinks he and Jonathan thinks he's gonna be killed hallelujah you know when you first come into the prince of god he's a holy God right and there's a fear there's a rip when you first come in Hollywood he takes care of your sin and then all the fear leaves you he comes in on crutches crippled and we were crippled this this world cripples us whether you like it or not this world is a crippling world but we don't have to stay crippled he's here to restore us you can say well I can I can do I can do all kind of cartwheels and sprinter whatever engine or whatever but you be crippled in your spirit right you be crippled that's why I see is I've come to bind up the brokenhearted seeing at liberty them that are bruised feeling him bruised in their spirit brokenhearted from this world so we all crippled in some way here comes the finish death before the king thinks the kings going to kill him because he has right to the throne right but then he says though I made a promise to your father that I wasn't take care of his children whoever's alive and he brings him to his banqueting table he says come sit at my sit at my banqueting table sit at the Kings Kings table you're welcome here every day to feast with me hallelujah and the beautiful thing is we don't have a thing here but he pulls himself up under the table you don't see his crippled legs you see a able-bodied person like everyone else at the table hallelujah that's why the Lord we have a seat at his table not just there but here right we have a place at his banqueting table here because this message is a feast hallelujah and he and he invites us come to the table and when we sit down or glory you don't see is you didn't see is brokenness anymore because he's at the table of the Lord hallelujah I'm so glad hallelujah name of Furby chef according to the Eastern Eastern CSTO in his Bible dictionary means exterminator of shame ie of idols he lived out King David exterminator of shame he had shame he had shame my father died in battle he's following a failed kingship they carry some shame wouldn't you agree but he couldn't live out his name because he couldn't wipe out the shame of his family right of his natural birth are you following me he couldn't wipe it out it took the king to invite him to the table that now the king would wipe out his shame the king would exterminate a shape because he say any says to him all the lands of your father will be restored to you everything that was lost because of what your father did will be restored to you you come and fish at my table hallelujah to God hallelujah I'm so glad so it brings us to his banqueting table amen Mephibosheth he looked like anyone else at that table and the Lord wants us to be the same way I don't know what you make of him but he is wonderful especially in time of trial especially in the hard times he gets more wonderful he gets more lovely he means more in the hard times than in the good times hallelujah I trust he means more to you today than when you first met him I mean that you're more anchored and grounded in love wholly and knowing that he's in control of all things that we are living we are having a feast he's invited you to his table and something in you said yes I don't have an excuse brother Brown teaches on the parable of the of the wedding feast invitation and and the invitation goes out the first two times and they both turn it down so he has gone to the highways the byways get the good and the bad just get them my table is going to be full and brother M says are the Pentecostals they turned down the spiritual feast they turned down the feast of the word and so it bypasses all of them and comes to you the invitation comes here and something and you says well this is better than the hi I'm sick of the highways and the byways I'm sick of being a vagabond upon the earth I'm sick of just wandering without purpose this invitation come in my hand oh I'm invited to a feast oh it's the king of Glory's feast oh yes and then you come so you says well what better than it's better than being in the state I trust you or that way it's better than being stuck this way and then you come and then and then there's one door into the feast which is Jesus Christ the word and you come to that door give yourself never hole I've never regretted I've never regretted giving myself to him I never regretted standing yo I didn't care I came to a point the Lord just stood up my life I pray he stirs up anyone who doesn't know I bet you still is get sick of life I'm sick of the status quo I can't stand this anymore I pray stirs you up that way you say Lord I got to find rest for the Soul and I found reef how long had your place I just don't care anymore I don't care about my friends you know they're good people I'm not worried about them what people will think lord I must meet you in some way hallelujah and he found me I was listening to the message he listened to that word he listened to that word this transforming power in that word and the reason I can say this because I've experienced it myself hallelujah so an invitation comes your way and then it's something in you says well I'm going then you come to the door you give yourself your washed your feet are washed from the stench of the world God knows how to wash you know God knows how to wash he he he does a thorough job washes you doesn't matter where you walked on this world you get washed of it he washes your feet puts on a new robe doesn't matter what state you come in you come as the poorest man on the earth or the richest man after you go through the door you're free whosh you've given a new rope they all look the same and then you're anointed Oh glory hallelujah and then you kissed welcome then you're in hallelujah amen and he we are having a feast so I wouldn't worry about what other people say see you can only really talk about from where your experiences right you can only go from me where your experiences david's mighty men nearly is coming into power that was their experience their experience a man in seoul's army said this go hunt down this renegade that was his experience that's all they could talk from you know but it depends where you where your experiences the disciples said to whom shall we go they have the words of eternal life that was their experience the others didn't have that same kind of experience so they left what about you who do you say this is he says jesus jesus christ the word or is it something else hallelujah who do you say that my experience is it it's this made flesh right this message is this Bible right the message is the Bible that's why he takes scriptures and just expands it up even sometimes they seem to be obscure and it becomes so plain and it runs all the way through the scripture you say how did I not see that hallelujah he shows you where you are amen naman I'll just finish with naman real quick there are a lot of lepers in Israel it was an enemy of enemy of the Jews he had leprosy he heard of a prophet in Israel he goes there and then the Prophet sends out a servant tell the dip in the Jordan seven times and he gets angry there will be two rivers by my church my denomination was a lot more nicer than this one or this church this river Jordans this muddy little thing nothing special about it the river through Damascus US or wherever the Euphrates whatever is in Syria far better River but gods in that place go dip seven times in that place and he'd humbled himself and there's something in the Bride of Christ they can handle themselves to the word they can't they may say well I don't know how this works for something em this is you should do it hallelujah and then naman servant was wise enough to say think about it again because the wood does offend people right but they should I pray this something in you that says think about it again think about what he said if he said something hard wouldn't you do it and they even had enough scenes to say yeah that's true and then he wanders down to the Jordan whatever state it's in it's not a pretty thing you go google it it's not a it's not a big majestic mighty whatever river and he dips in first time nothing second time nothing third time and probably by the fifth time he's thinking is this ever he's probably trying to keep count and it maybe comes out one more time the servant says he goes in he comes out he's not a letter anymore Allu yeah and it's the same thing with us the wood washes us we come out and we see oh my the thing that brought me here I'm not carrying any more lujah the sin of this world the sin nature I was carrying right I'm not packing it no more it got washed there ago we buried Satan hallelujah glory to God don't forget that amen and Jesus ties those two accounts and with the state of Scriptures fulfilled because he's saying no and brother and preaches him and this day the Scriptures fulfilled and he's not just picking something out of the year and all this will excite people it's actually God moving his prophet saying this is this has just happened and he was there and he was trying to preach birth pains and he got a new Bible and the two pages he was trying to read was stuck together you can hear it on the hear it on the tape and he didn't realize he attacked either because the number of verses were perfectly in line like it's actually properly printed and then a bishop bishop Stanley comes with his Bible he hear him on tape he says be steady son you can hear him and he reads out of his Bible and he takes the Bible and goes back and brother and preaches birth pains then afterwards he's looking at Bible and he realizes the two pages are stuck together and then God's dealing with him saying and takes them and to look for saying and Jesus stood up to read and God allowed all that to happen because God is wanting you to know that we are in his second coming it's not a haphazard thing misprinted Bible all things had to happen for that to be that way and God's causing it to happen that you would know behold I send you Elijah the Prophet to turn your heart back to the original faith to turn your heart from creeds and fables of man true the Living God to walk with the living Jesus Christ hallelujah hasn't he done that isn't it wonderful that you're in the scripture you didn't even know hallelujah and you can and people say well that didn't happen you say I'm sorry it happened my heart got turned hallelujah he's in me Elijah his words were recorded on a tape and it spoke to me differently to any other voice I've ever heard and something in me turned hallelujah and in me it doesn't want to turn back I mean because when it turned something in me said this is you this is what you mean to be hallelujah glory to God sorry what we should really do I think I haven't said this in a while maybe I'm wrong it's like laughing all the way to the bank who's heard that expression you're just laughing all the way in the bank tellers aren't laughing and you laugh all the way out it's like us you mean jesus paid it all we are saved by grace through faith and it's more than a nice scripture on Instagram but it's a reality His grace has brought me safe thus far his grace taught my heart to fear and then his grace my fears relieved when I realized that I was fearful because I realized I was lost but then his grace moved upon I realize he paid it all and I accepted his pardon you mean really yes really you mean that you have no fear of death I don't feed it Jesus should I through that door I've won waiting for me Allu you so doesn't matter what happens to this thing I have one waiting for me and he promised the same God that is present the same God that moves in your soul right is the same God that will take you through that door should you go through that door and you won't fall you'll just go up you'll find yourself on a green grassy place should you be waiting for the rapture and you'll meet all the saints that have gone on and you'll be having a rejoicing time and the word sublime doesn't even touch it the prophet said hallelujah isn't that right we are going to a real place Jesus is here to take us to that place I go to prepare a place for you and if I go I shall come again and receive you unto myself this isn't the Gospel of John the 14th chapter right I got to prepare a place for you and if I do I'll come again and receive you to myself who's been received as he received you as he really really received your faith and given you his Holy Spirit hallelujah that means you've been received yeah I'm hallelujah just like the man with the prodigal son the son comes back is embraced by the father hallelujah he's come back home everything's fine there where I am oh where you are but where I am you shall be also hallelujah this message is Jesus Christ the word and it has come to receive and you clayed and if he's received you he will take you to where he is God where you are that's why our minds our house you be fixed on Lord you have come to carry me away hallelujah it's more than a it's more than a story the Bible is more than a story it's a reality holy the Holy Ghost we talk about is a reality right salvation is a reality redemptions a reality but you're just gonna give yourself to him you can't just hold back and say well another day that's the devil's life another day another day no what about today what about now you'll never regret it I know I have no regrets I didn't even know in the bridges that I crossed over it was just vaporized how are you I'm not looking for it I'm not looking for a way back I don't want her way back I don't want some nice kind of life I want to walk with him right because when it's all said and done hallelujah we'll say Lord you said well why do you want to walk with him because I want to give him something to place at his feet and what we place at his feet is the victories he's won in our lives it's nothing we do right it's healing healing nothing we do it's what he has done hallelujah redemption is nothing we do it's what he has done salvations nothing we do it's what he has done deliverance is nothing we do it's what he has done walking with Him there's nothing we do it's what he has done right isn't that right so I want something Lord you gave me these victories in life not because of me but because of you so I want to place it at your feet because he's worthy isn't he wonderful shall we stand tonight hallelujah isn't he glorious I mean let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer let's pray together oh my Jesus my Savior Lord there is none like thee Lord we're so thankful father you're more than emotion
