[23:37] thank you in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:39] amen amen God bless you friends you can
[23:41] have your seats uh tonight I want to I
[23:44] want to take this aspect I've been I've
[23:45] been pondering on it about uh from verse
[23:48] 15 here that your feet shod with the
[23:50] preparation of the gospel of peace amen
[23:52] we know uh you on Sunday we're talking
[23:54] about taking the sword of the spirit
[23:55] which is the word of God or the
[23:57] inspiration of God and um brother Braham
[23:59] tells us that we know this Armor of God
[24:01] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it's
[24:03] not a second thing you need to get but
[24:05] if you've been filled with the Holy
[24:06] Ghost you you you have the full armor of
[24:09] God Amen that's the only way to stand in
[24:11] this evil day so now this uh your feet
[24:14] sh with the preparation of the gospel of
[24:16] peace now this word I really enjoy this
[24:18] word preparation here because uh yeah
[24:21] it's there so so it has many many of
[24:23] course to be be uh the act of preparing
[24:26] it's the condition of a person or a
[24:27] thing as far forth as prepared Readiness
[24:31] is being you know but but I like it
[24:33] where where the root meaning of this
[24:34] word it means part of it means to
[24:36] prepare the minds of men to give the
[24:39] Messiah a fit reception and secure His
[24:42] blessings amen so if your feet are shod
[24:45] with the gospel with the prep
[24:47] preparation of the gospel of peace I say
[24:49] you are prepared you are ready to make a
[24:52] fit reception for the Messiah amen
[24:54] because it's the biggest fear I think
[24:56] that would strike a Believer is am I
[24:57] ready
[24:58] amen isn't that right we want to be
[25:00] ready we want to be ready to move amen
[25:02] and I say that the Lord has made us
[25:04] ready amen that you know it's not our
[25:06] ability that makes us ready but it's
[25:08] what's been given unto us to put on
[25:10] that's what's matters amen as the
[25:12] Apostle Paul say take under you the
[25:13] whole armor of God Amen the the reason
[25:16] he would say that is because there was
[25:18] armor to put on Amen that it wasn't they
[25:20] didn't have to work out what they needed
[25:22] to where it was already there for them
[25:24] amen as as um as John as he saw in Revel
[25:28] ation 19 one of my favorite favorite
[25:30] parts of the Book of Revelations and you
[25:32] know as and and and and John would say
[25:35] and I heard as it were the voice of a
[25:36] great multitude and the voice of many
[25:38] Waters and is the voice of Mighty
[25:40] thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord
[25:42] God omnipotent reth let us be glad and
[25:45] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[25:47] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[25:49] wife hath made herself ready amen so she
[25:52] is prepared and to her was granted that
[25:54] she should be ar raay in fine linen
[25:56] clean and white for the fine linen is
[25:58] the righteousness of saints and he saith
[26:01] unto me right blessed are they which are
[26:02] called unto the marriage supper of the
[26:04] lamb and he saith unto me these are the
[26:06] true sayings of God Amen so the so the
[26:09] bride has made herself ready because
[26:11] she's been granted to put on these
[26:13] garments amen that's not something that
[26:15] you know that that the bride works out
[26:16] how to do in her own strength no the
[26:17] word has been given and there's
[26:19] something in us that puts it on Amen I
[26:22] mean to be fashioned in this word now we
[26:24] know the strength that we walk in is the
[26:27] is the strength of the Holy Ghost
[26:29] himself amen it's not our human ability
[26:32] that allows us to walk this walk but
[26:34] it's but but it's God's ability amen and
[26:36] it's our Footwear is very important you
[26:38] know I remember when I um you know I was
[26:40] at boarding school many years ago now
[26:42] and you know the first the first morning
[26:44] of the Year we'd have to get up about
[26:46] 6:00 in the morning the whole boarding
[26:47] house had to go for a run round the
[26:49] field one one time I decided I'm going
[26:52] to run bare feet that was a bad idea it
[26:55] was Frosty it was cold and we had to run
[26:57] a long way my feet weren't prepared i w
[27:01] I wasn't wearing the right kind of shoes
[27:03] to make the journey comfortable amen I
[27:06] still made it I've still got all 10 toes
[27:08] I can still count with them you see but
[27:10] you know some people can go far enough
[27:12] for long enough in the wrong conditions
[27:14] with the wrong Footwear and they get
[27:15] Frost bright they start to lose part of
[27:17] themselves but but the and and and how
[27:20] you walk is really based on the Footwear
[27:21] you have if you have no grip on your
[27:24] shoes and you know you have no grip on
[27:25] your shoes and it's slippery and muddy
[27:27] and wet you got to be careful how you
[27:29] walk right you can be sliding along and
[27:32] doing the splits and falling over and
[27:34] covered and my the person right next to
[27:35] you is just kind of strolling along why
[27:38] cuz they've got the right Footwear now
[27:40] there's only one kind of Footwear that
[27:41] can make this journey there's not two
[27:43] there's only one what I'm saying if you
[27:44] got the right Footwear you can walk with
[27:46] confidence amen you don't have to walk
[27:48] in fear that you're going to fall over
[27:49] and trip and something's going to snag
[27:51] you and you're going to slide no you
[27:52] have confidence that the that the one
[27:54] who gave you these shoes is going to
[27:56] carry you through amen so now as as um
[27:59] in the first Exodus here you know Israel
[28:02] was told to to take the lamb we know it
[28:05] had to be without blemish the male of
[28:07] the firstborn and you know either the
[28:09] sheep or the goats and they had to keep
[28:10] it up for a certain amount of time they
[28:11] had to take the blood and strike it on
[28:13] the two post of the you know door and
[28:15] the you you the upper post of the house
[28:17] and they had to eat it that night they
[28:19] had to roast it with bitter herbs and
[28:21] have it with unleavened bread but you
[28:23] see but then even Moses would give or
[28:25] God would give the instructions this is
[28:27] how I want you to be dressed when you
[28:28] eat the lamb that you got to be dressed
[28:30] to leave amen you're not dressing to
[28:32] stay you're not you're not here to have
[28:33] a big long feast and staying go should
[28:35] know this is the last night you're going
[28:37] to be in this place you're going to be
[28:39] dressed to leave this world or leave
[28:41] Egypt amen it's the same thing with us
[28:43] friends we are as we eat the word as we
[28:45] eat the lamb as we draw strength amen
[28:48] and virtue and peace and love and joy
[28:49] from the word of God Amen we're dressed
[28:51] to leave amen we're dressed to leave
[28:54] amen as as as God would tell them you
[28:56] got to you got to eat it with your loins
[28:59] GED your shoes on your feet and your
[29:00] staff in your hand amen you got to eat
[29:03] it in haste amen so don't just sit
[29:05] around and no eat this with purpose amen
[29:07] and so we're going to realize that it
[29:09] didn't matter how weak the Israelite was
[29:12] all they needed to do was eat the lamb
[29:14] maybe there's old Grandpa Grandma they
[29:16] couldn't even get out of bed they
[29:17] bedridden and maybe they would tell the
[29:19] family just just leave me here you can't
[29:21] carry me it's too far and look I just
[29:23] can't walk anymore I've been beding for
[29:25] so many years and I just can't do it you
[29:27] know I just can't get up and you know
[29:29] maybe the head of the house maybe their
[29:31] son would say you know you know Dad Mom
[29:33] just eat this lamb eat this lamb that
[29:35] God's provided amen have this unleaving
[29:37] bread and you know maybe they'd start
[29:39] eating it they'd find strength come into
[29:41] their body I mean where they once bed
[29:43] they couldn't walk they troubled and
[29:44] they look at their own Frailty and their
[29:46] insufficiencies but they begin to draw
[29:48] strength from that land I mean they
[29:49] begin to stand up and say look I can
[29:51] walk I can move my feet amen and then
[29:53] hallelujah then then the first thing in
[29:55] knew they were ready to leave when the
[29:56] trumpet sounded amen and God would come
[29:59] down and he would tell them in is um
[30:02] Deuteronomy 29 that for for the 40 years
[30:05] they are in the wilderness that their
[30:06] shoes didn't get old amen and their
[30:08] clothes didn't wear out why is that
[30:10] because and there wasn't a feeble one
[30:12] among them amen if you read Deuteronomy
[30:14] and so on why is that because they
[30:16] walked out of Egypt under the power of
[30:19] the Lamb I mean under the power of the
[30:20] blood I mean and that strengthened them
[30:23] sustained them for their 40-year Journey
[30:26] hallelujah we're not journeying 40 years
[30:28] upon the Earth We're Going
[30:29] upward amen and is a natural the
[30:31] strength of a natural lamb amen a
[30:33] sacrifice there and under the Old
[30:35] Testament there could get them from that
[30:37] place strengthen them and they could
[30:38] walk in that way how much more this amen
[30:40] we can realize that the clothing we've
[30:42] been clothed with the baptism of the
[30:43] Holy Ghost it doesn't wear out amen it
[30:46] doesn't get holes in it amen this armor
[30:48] cannot be punctured amen it can't be
[30:50] dented it you may receive a lot of
[30:52] strikes amen but it can't be dented amen
[30:54] it can't be it can't be holes it doesn't
[30:57] have to be replaced it doesn't need to
[30:58] be patched up with a new idea but no the
[31:00] word of God is as given is just as good
[31:03] today as it was when it was given amen
[31:06] so it shows just goes to show that we
[31:08] can walk in confidence amen because
[31:10] these these feet that we these shoes
[31:13] that we're shot with this preparation of
[31:14] the gospel of peace has made us to have
[31:17] such an attitude that Messiah is very
[31:21] welcome that Messiah can receive a fit
[31:24] reception I'm just reading that bottom
[31:25] part in the yellow there I me no no
[31:27] notice now how differ how different we
[31:30] were before we were dressed this way
[31:33] with our attitude towards the Lord to
[31:35] how we are now before I ever met God I
[31:37] would never have come to a place like
[31:39] this I just be honest I would never be
[31:41] standing here I wouldn't be reading this
[31:43] I would never have come to a place like
[31:44] this but God said you are dressed wrong
[31:47] I'm going to get a hold of your life I'm
[31:49] you're going to willingly give yourself
[31:51] to me and I'm going to dress you I'm
[31:52] going to I'm going to put the right
[31:53] shoes on your feet amen that you are now
[31:57] fit to to to receive the Messiah amen
[32:00] that you can you can be fit that when he
[32:02] comes back again to catch his bride away
[32:04] you are prepared you are ready you're
[32:06] not just standing there watching events
[32:08] unfold and seeing what's happening in
[32:10] the world no you are the main event amen
[32:12] because the Rapture the secret going of
[32:15] the Bride of Jesus Christ is the main
[32:17] world event that's taking place right
[32:19] now I mean there's a people around the
[32:21] world out of every nationality am mean
[32:23] are being dressed in the word of God
[32:25] they're being prepared they're being
[32:26] transformed by the AP ISM of the Holy
[32:28] Ghost and they are getting ready to
[32:30] leave amen and if you're not ready get
[32:33] ready let God get you ready Amen Let Him
[32:36] transform your life and change you to
[32:38] match his word amen so now so so we
[32:41] because there's always a question that
[32:42] can come up up in a believer's mind the
[32:44] devil loves to plague people with it am
[32:47] I ready to leave and it says in
[32:49] Ephesians 4:30 grieve you not the Holy
[32:51] Ghost whereby you're sealed until the
[32:53] day of your Redemption am mean so
[32:55] there's a sealing that takes place that
[32:57] you're sealed to the the day of your
[32:58] Redemption that that means now that
[33:00] you're sealed to your destination y yep
[33:03] amen amen my destination's glory where
[33:05] are you going am mean the seal on your
[33:08] life will dictate to where you're going

[33:13] sticker whatever and that goes to where

[33:42] blessings amen we don't just have some
[33:44] of his blessings it's a blessing to know
[33:46] that he lived it's a blessing to know
[33:48] the tomb is empty it's a blessing to
[33:50] know that this word is true it's another
[33:54] thing to see that same God step out of
[33:56] history and prove as word in our lives
[33:58] amen that's the Supreme blessing amen
[34:00] that we don't believe he rose just cuz
[34:02] the tomb is empty we believe that he
[34:04] rose because he when he said he would
[34:06] and two he stepped out of History to you
[34:08] and I in this day amen he's proved
[34:10] himself alive in

[34:30] and I'll say it this way and if any
[34:32] blessing gets stolen it's going to be
[34:34] returned come on Amen like I heard
[34:37] someone say a story about a young boy I
[34:39] think he had a sailboat you know he made
[34:41] the sailboat and he went sailing in the
[34:42] river and and you know but but but one
[34:44] day the current was too strong and the

[34:52] upset cuz he spent a lot of time making
[34:53] the sailboat but then one day he was
[34:55] walking down past the cash converters
[34:57] and he looked in the window and he saw
[34:58] his sailboat you know what he did he saw
[35:01] the price on that sailboat he went home
[35:03] broke his piggy back open or transferred
[35:06] some funds I don't know what he did but
[35:07] you know he got the money that was his
[35:09] money right amen and he went to that
[35:11] place he bought the sailboat he walked
[35:13] out and then he said sailboat now you're
[35:15] twice mine you're twice mine sailboat
[35:18] hallelujah it's like the Lord Jesus we
[35:20] we were his before the foundation of the
[35:22] world but then we came into this Earth

[35:26] and he grabs us a hold of us picks up
[35:28] and says now you're twice mine and I'm
[35:31] not letting you go no more hallelujah

[35:38] amen if the peace of God that pass all
[35:40] understands been taken it can become
[35:42] twice yours am amen you take any any any
[35:45] blessing of God Amen it can become twice
[35:47] yours I tell you when it becomes twice
[35:49] yours it means twice as much to you amen
[35:51] cuz you know what it's like to have it
[35:53] you know what it's like to lose it but
[35:54] you know what it's like to get it back
[35:55] again amen and when you get it back back
[35:57] again it means a lot more to you when
[35:59] you maybe you first had it am hallelujah
[36:01] amen so there's a Hallelujah so it makes
[36:04] us fit isn't that wonderful that he
[36:06] makes us
[36:08] fit give the Messiah a fit
[36:11] reception amen so there's a there's a
[36:14] heart of love and Thanksgiving and
[36:16] joy that gives him a fit reception he
[36:19] feels welcome when he comes into your
[36:21] presence amen there's not a spirit of
[36:24] unbelief and skepticism that would push
[36:26] him away there's a welcoming Spirit like
[36:28] many times brother Ram would stand in
[36:30] the prayer line or you discernment line
[36:32] someone comes up before him and says you
[36:34] are a Christian you have a welcoming
[36:37] Spirit wouldn't that be a wonderful
[36:39] wonderful thing to be told of you and I
[36:42] that there's a spirit in us that's so
[36:44] welcoming that the lord loves to be
[36:46] around us amen that we don't have a we
[36:48] don't have a a a spirit that gives him
[36:52] the wrong kind of reception that gives
[36:54] him rejection that makes him not feel
[36:56] welcome but no the Lord has made us in
[36:58] such a way that we give him a fit
[37:00] reception yeah amen
[37:03] hallelujah as second Timothy uh the
[37:06] Apostle Paul be writing to Timothy he
[37:08] says I've fought a good fight I've
[37:09] finished my course I've kept the faith
[37:12] henceforth there is laid off me a crown
[37:13] of righteousness which the Lord the
[37:15] righteous judge shall give me at that
[37:17] day and not to me only but unto all them
[37:20] also that love his appearing amen so you
[37:23] know that you've been made you're
[37:24] wearing the right shoes when you love is
[37:26] appearing amen when you love the
[37:28] manifestation of his Spirit when he
[37:29] begins to move Among Us amen you can be
[37:31] in your car you can be at home and you
[37:33] just feel that sweet presence of God
[37:35] come around you and it just Thrills your
[37:37] soul it makes your day I mean what is
[37:39] that you love his appearing amen and you
[37:42] love his appearing because there's a
[37:44] crown of righteousness laid up for you
[37:45] on that day am hallelujah amen isn't
[37:49] that oh to me that's tremendous amen
[37:51] whether there something in us that loves
[37:52] is appearing amen we don't get angry
[37:54] when he moves we don't get offended when
[37:56] he touches someone else's life we don't
[37:59] get annoyed when he blesses someone else
[38:00] no we're happy for that person we're
[38:02] happy when God fulfills his word amen
[38:04] we're pleased when God moves and does
[38:06] something in our midst amen we are
[38:07] thankful for that amen why is that
[38:09] because we love his
[38:11] appearing praise God praise the Lord
[38:14] hallelujah now now these these these
[38:17] feet that we're sha with or the or the
[38:20] shoes that we're shod with are going to
[38:22] take us on a
[38:23] journey and it's a glorious
[38:25] Journey amen I'm I'm sure everyone can
[38:28] relate to that it's a glorious Journey
[38:30] it's not always an easy Journey but it's
[38:31] a glorious Journey amen I say the the
[38:35] the destination is well worth the
[38:36] journey amen amen and now in order to in
[38:41] order to Walk This Way see these shoes
[38:45] have a have a very interesting thing
[38:47] about them they have a mind of their
[38:49] own right the shoes I wear I decide
[38:52] where they're going to walk unless
[38:54] someone else is run unless William's got
[38:56] them and he's running off somewhere
[38:57] walking in them but the shoes of the
[38:59] preparation of the gospel of peace have
[39:01] a mind of their own because it's the
[39:03] mind of Christ amen and if we stay
[39:06] surrendered because we got to stay
[39:07] surrendered to the mind of the Lord
[39:10] right that's why David would pray in
[39:12] Psalms 119 he says look thou upon me and
[39:15] be merciful unto me as thou usest to do
[39:19] uh unto those that love thy name Glory
[39:23] order my steps and thy word and let not
[39:25] my and let not any iniquity have
[39:28] dominion over me so his prayer was Lord
[39:31] order my steps in thy word Lord I need a
[39:33] certain kind of Footwear that I'm going
[39:35] to walk in thy word I'm not going to
[39:37] walk in my ideas and my opinion and what
[39:40] the world is hasht trending on some
[39:43] Instagram stream somewhere no we our our
[39:46] steps must be ordered in his word amen
[39:48] and if we but the thing is if we realize
[39:50] if we allow God to order our steps in
[39:52] his word there's tremendous blessings to
[39:55] have amen there's there's such a rich
[39:57] relationship we can have with our Lord
[39:59] Jesus Christ that before we start
[40:01] walking we could never imagine how great
[40:02] it is amen if you look at any of the
[40:04] Heroes of Faith down through the Bible
[40:07] amen they would have I believe if they
[40:09] could you know you know if they could be
[40:10] resurrected and placed right here and
[40:13] they and they gave their testimony and
[40:15] You' ask them about the hardest time of
[40:17] their walk and you'd say maybe would you
[40:19] want to change that they'd say
[40:21] no why because God proved himself in
[40:24] those moments am mean I do not have the
[40:27] testimony that I have without those
[40:29] moments amen and I treasure those
[40:31] moments because the lord always showed
[40:32] up in those moments you see these shoes
[40:35] these shoes are incredible shoes amen
[40:37] because they got a security detail that
[40:39] walk around these shoes amen the Lord
[40:41] himself he says you know that the angel
[40:43] of the Lord encamps about those that
[40:45] fear Him and delivers them all amen so
[40:48] so we're not walking alone in this
[40:50] journey now I don't know if I have it
[40:52] here but um if I can find it no I don't
[40:55] but you know we know the scripture well
[40:56] that Enoch you know it says that Enoch
[40:59] walked with God right we know that
[41:01] scripture well now in other translations
[41:03] it said that Enoch habitually walked
[41:06] with God so it became a habit of Enoch
[41:10] to walk with God now a a a habit can
[41:14] look like something that's just done
[41:15] subconsciously that's part of a habit
[41:17] right you know but the thing is a habit
[41:20] when it comes to Walking with God is
[41:22] your heart's got to be in it now I was
[41:25] thinking the other day now this may seem
[41:26] a bit of left feel but you know some
[41:28] people you know the devil puts it on
[41:29] people's minds do they feel like they
[41:31] have faith or do I feel like do I really
[41:34] feel like a Christian and I was thinking
[41:38] so my last name's gloin as we all know
[41:41] what does it feel like to be a
[41:43] gloin I have no
[41:46] idea but the reason I know I'm mlin
[41:49] because I was born
[41:50] one so I'm not one day feeling oh yes
[41:53] I'm a glory next day I don't feel cuz I
[41:55] don't know what that feeling Baseline is
[41:56] I just there's nothing tangible I can
[41:58] say yes it's this and I feel like this
[42:00] and it's the same thing with being a
[42:01] Christian feeling like you're full of
[42:03] Faith feeling like you're not feeling
[42:05] like you're a Christian that's
[42:06] irrelevant you're born one I mean like
[42:08] brother R said they I've been in the
[42:10] Brandon family 53 years they never asked
[42:13] me to join I was born in it amen so when
[42:15] the Devil comes on and ask you do you
[42:17] feel like a Believer do you feel like
[42:18] the word is true do you feel like you're
[42:19] overcoming you say I have no idea cuz I
[42:23] don't know what that means
[42:25] hall hallelujah amen so we don't walk by
[42:28] faith we don't we don't worship or walk
[42:30] with God because we feel like it cuz
[42:33] what does that even mean it's so to i'
[42:36] just been thinking about this like what
[42:37] does that even mean it's like if you ask
[42:39] me what you ask any of my children
[42:41] what's it like to feel what does it feel
[42:42] like to be glowing they'll look at you
[42:44] with some funny stare I'm
[42:46] sure cuz it's so it doesn't make any
[42:49] sense and the devil asks you the same
[42:51] thing about being an overcomer I don't
[42:53] know what that feels like I was born one
[42:56] that's the main thing amen I'm born I
[42:58] was born and overcome by the Holy Ghost
[43:01] amen I was born to be full of Faith by
[43:02] the Holy Ghost AM mean I was made a
[43:04] Christian born a Christian by the Holy
[43:06] Ghost so whenever the enemy makes you oh
[43:08] do you feel what do you not well you say
[43:10] well I don't know you're asking the
[43:13] wrong person you ask yourself that you
[43:14] don't know the question either so we
[43:16] don't walk by feelings we walk by faith
[43:18] so a habit can be the devil come along
[43:20] and say oh you're just walking with God
[43:22] by habit no but in truth you're walking
[43:25] with God by Revelation by desire
[43:27] am mean that the Lord remember Enoch
[43:29] there was 65 years of his life he didn't
[43:31] walk with God we don't know what he did
[43:34] but he was doing something but then in
[43:36] the 65th year of his life something
[43:38] happened where God said no no no you're
[43:40] walking wrong you got the wrong shoes on
[43:43] I'm going to give you the right kind of
[43:45] shoes and and and ultimately these shoes
[43:47] are going to take you into glory amen so
[43:50] so so he put on I say I say Enoch wore
[43:53] the whole armor of God Amen and so he
[43:55] was now dressed right to walk with God
[43:57] and he habitually walked with God but it
[44:00] wasn't just going through the motions
[44:02] his heart was in it my Lord amen it was
[44:04] the main thing of his life amen and
[44:06] that's why I said before any hero of
[44:08] Faith through the hard times where God
[44:10] came on the scene that's I I loved
[44:12] walking through that moment why because
[44:14] God built his relationship with me in
[44:15] that moment amen those things mean the
[44:18] mean mean the world to me because God
[44:20] proved himself in those Hard Times amen
[44:22] so walking through the fire walking
[44:23] through the flood walking over mountains
[44:25] or down through valleys through Bri
[44:26] patches it's all worth it cuz God wants
[44:28] to prove himself in those things amen
[44:30] that's why God God would allow us to
[44:32] walk through those places now let's go
[44:34] to let's go to Psalms 23 Jus let's read
[44:38] this I don't I don't have it on here so
[44:39] we're going old school we're going to be
[44:42] turning
[44:44] uh yes whatever this paper's called I
[44:47] don't know anyway Psalms 23 the thin
[44:49] paper how's everyone tonight wonderful
[44:52] has everyone got the right shoes on Amen
[44:55] praise the Lord hallelujah remember H
[44:57] Jimmy where's he gone he's out the back
[44:59] yeah but I remember being in um being in
[45:02] Chile with brother Jimmy I mean no sorry
[45:03] brother Pedro's brother you know walking
[45:05] around just in bare feet or socks in the
[45:07] house no no you don't you don't wear
[45:10] that here you need shoes on you need
[45:12] shoes on wherever you go you need shoes
[45:14] on okay in the Christian walk you need
[45:17] shoes on you need the Lord's shoes on
[45:20] hallelujah amen Psalms 23 the Lord is my
[45:23] shepherd I shall not
[45:25] want he maketh me to light down in Green
[45:27] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[45:29] Waters he leads me he restores my soul
[45:32] he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the
[45:34] path Paths of righteousness for his
[45:36] name's sake ye th I walk through the
[45:38] valley of the shadow of death I will
[45:40] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[45:42] rod on thy staff they comfort me thou
[45:44] preparest a table before me in the
[45:46] presence of my enemies thou anointeth my
[45:48] head with oil my cup runneth over surely
[45:51] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[45:53] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[45:55] the house of the Lord
[45:57] forever amen now now now for those who
[46:00] are wearing the right kind of
[46:02] shoes this Psalm means a lot this SSM
[46:05] means an incredible thing to them amen
[46:08] where where where where they have a
[46:10] revelation the Lord is my shepherd yeah
[46:12] now we know a walk means a progression
[46:15] we don't sit still sure we're sitting
[46:16] and maybe I'll preach on that one day
[46:18] resting and fighting and walking at the
[46:19] same
[46:21] time I don't know we'll see how we go
[46:23] but you know but but but this see a walk
[46:25] speaks of a relationship ship a walk
[46:28] speaks of a different day speaks of
[46:31] spending time together having new
[46:33] experiences amen and so David knew what
[46:35] it was like to be a Shepherd he knew
[46:37] what it was like to have a a
[46:38] relationship with his sheep and so he
[46:41] had a revelation now the Lord as I am
[46:43] the Sheep Shepherd the Lord is my
[46:45] shepherd amen and he causes me to go
[46:48] through all kind of different situations
[46:50] but I will fear no evil amen amen why
[46:53] because thou art with me as I said
[46:55] before these shoes come with a security
[46:58] detail amen we're never alone in this
[47:01] walk amen sometimes we may feel lonely
[47:03] but we're never alone amen because the
[47:06] Lord said I'll never leave thee nor
[47:07] forsake thee amen so so now this Psalm
[47:10] is an incredible Psalm because you think
[47:12] about it now where where David would be
[47:14] inspired to write these words and
[47:16] Believers from that moment down to this
[47:18] time have drawn strength from these
[47:19] words now those those who have these uh
[47:23] shoes on Amen walk through the rally the
[47:27] shadow of death and they fear no evil
[47:30] they are not worried about what will
[47:31] happen to them because their Shepherd
[47:33] goes before them amen amen we don't walk
[47:36] God never sends us into something
[47:37] without first stepping into it amen amen
[47:40] so now Daniel and shadra mishak and
[47:43] abedo they had the whole armor of God
[47:46] they had the right kind of foot we on
[47:49] Amen and so so Daniel Daniel would
[47:52] habitually walk with God just like Enoch
[47:54] would every day he would walk with with
[47:57] God and if you have the right kind of
[47:59] shoes on nothing is going to stop you
[48:03] from um allowing you're not going to
[48:05] allow anything to break your walk with
[48:07] God things will try and break your
[48:09] relationship things will try and come
[48:11] between you and God situations will come
[48:14] times of Life trouble whatever it is
[48:16] we'll try it but but as as as Paul would
[48:19] say in Romans chapter 8 nothing can
[48:21] separate us amen from the love of God
[48:23] which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[48:25] nothing and and so so Paul I'd say these
[48:29] shoes were put to the test in the
[48:30] Apostle Paul's life he was Shipwrecked
[48:34] he was beaten he was chased from City to
[48:36] City amen he was he was in Peril by
[48:39] those who are without the church those
[48:40] are within all kinds of things happen
[48:43] but but but he became he he became
[48:46] persuaded nothing can separate us from
[48:48] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[48:50] our lord amen why because he he had what
[48:53] what he was writing to the Ephesians
[48:55] about the whole armor of God he was
[48:56] already wearing amen so now Daniel
[48:59] Daniel no doubt would have taken this
[49:01] Psalm 23 with him into into Babylon now
[49:04] we know Daniel and shadra mesach and B
[49:06] too they were young people when they
[49:08] left Jerusalem they weren't old people
[49:10] they were young they were in their
[49:10] teenage years and their in their
[49:12] formative years that would shape their
[49:14] character shape the way that they would
[49:16] go they made up their made up their mind
[49:18] we're serving God Amen where are we
[49:20] going babyon do you know what it is I
[49:21] don't know but we're serving God that
[49:24] that's what they decided wherever
[49:26] wherever God would take them or allow
[49:27] them to go they're going to serve him
[49:30] the lord they're going to be Believers
[49:31] and I say the reason they could do that
[49:33] is because they had the right kind of
[49:34] foot we on Amen so now when Daniel up in
[49:37] years he was an elderly man with this
[49:39] happened but then Daniel you know heard
[49:41] the decree because he had enemies in the
[49:43] cabinet there or in court there with the
[49:45] King and and those enemies had the law
[49:48] written that that that no one was
[49:49] allowed to pray to any other God or Man
[49:52] Apart from the King for 30 days now
[49:55] Daniel had was habitually Walking with
[49:58] God and when he prayed to God three
[50:01] times a day it wasn't just going through
[50:03] the motions though sometimes it can feel
[50:06] that way his heart was Lord I want to
[50:07] talk to you I want to I want to I want
[50:10] to maintain my relationship Lord I want
[50:12] to report in and he opened those window
[50:14] shutters that were looking towards
[50:16] Jerusalem maybe said oh Al Shai Adonai
[50:19] Lord God Almighty it's Daniel again
[50:22] Hallelujah glory to your name you've
[50:25] made a covenant with me God
[50:28] hallelujah amen you know and so so what
[50:31] it was he was building his relationship
[50:34] with with God and when that decree came
[50:37] it didn't change who he was because he
[50:40] was not willing to let anything s his
[50:44] relationship with God Amen because we
[50:46] know prayer is a communion it's not just
[50:49] us speaking some words and yo that's it
[50:51] no no it's God we talking to God and God
[50:53] talks to us and as we're talking to God
[50:56] God's changing our heart and our mind to
[50:57] match his heart and mind amen and he's
[51:00] giving us Direction I was thinking
[51:01] really you know there's nothing new
[51:03] Under the Sun right Ai and and chat Bots
[51:07] and stuff AI stuff that's just a cheap
[51:10] copy of
[51:12] God because what what do people do when
[51:15] did this happen or explain this to me
[51:17] just a minute you know that's a cheap
[51:20] copy of people praying to
[51:24] God isn't it it's just a cheap copy
[51:27] the thing is you can't trust a chatbot
[51:29] you can trust
[51:31] God
[51:33] Amen so you know don't don't be pouring
[51:36] your heart out to a
[51:37] chatbot pour your heart out to God and
[51:40] God will answer in the
[51:41] season amen God will prove his word God
[51:44] will show you the way to go amen So
[51:47] Daniel refused Amen to to to uh let
[51:50] anything s his relationship with the
[51:52] Lord amen so so he continued praying and
[51:54] of course he got busted being a
[51:56] Christian
[51:57] I mean he got thrown to the Den of Lions
[51:59] now he didn't know that he didn't know
[52:01] that um you know what would happen when
[52:02] he got thrown into the den but that
[52:05] didn't change his mind he knew the
[52:07] threatenings of the king he knew the law
[52:08] of the king and he knew the King was a
[52:10] man of his word but that didn't stop him
[52:12] why CU he had the right kind of Footwear
[52:14] on am mean so when he got thrown into
[52:17] the you see you see these these shoes we
[52:20] wear Supernatural shoes they'll cause
[52:23] you to stand in some places amen where
[52:25] you don't you don't work it out you
[52:26] don't plan it beforehand but you find
[52:28] yourself standing in a position it's
[52:30] amazing because it causes you to stand
[52:33] amen and in face of anything it causes
[52:36] you to stand remember it's not us that
[52:38] that in our own ability that stand as a
[52:40] Christian every day no it's the ability
[52:42] of God in our lives causes us to be a
[52:44] Christian every day amen so he' stand
[52:47] there he knew the threats of the king he
[52:49] said well just throw me in King but I'll
[52:51] see you in the
[52:52] morning hallelujah amen so those shoes
[52:56] took away into a lion's den Hallelujah
[52:58] did he try and take them off before he
[52:59] got thrown in no cuz they were part of
[53:01] him yes amen so so those shoes caused
[53:03] him to walk into a lion's den am mean
[53:06] but the one who gave the shoes stepped
[53:08] down to the Lion's Den shut the mouth of
[53:10] the lion he pulled up maybe I know Leo
[53:13] the Lion fluffed his man made a pillow
[53:16] put him put his feet on Simba and had a
[53:19] good sleep that night maybe there's a
[53:21] good s log snore going on down there you
[53:25] know he was sleeping the king wasn't
[53:28] sleeping because the king didn't have
[53:30] these kind of a shoes so he was worried
[53:32] he was stressed what's going to happen
[53:33] now if Daniel got eaten up well his last
[53:36] breath here would be as then the next
[53:38] breath he would take would be up there
[53:41] cuz these shoes transcend Dimensions
[53:44] up Hallelujah so the next morning you
[53:47] know Daniel you know you the king came
[53:49] early in the morning play bags and bags
[53:51] under his eyes and you know all worried
[53:53] and stressed with his slippers on his
[53:54] dressing going on and comes down and
[53:57] says Daniel are you still alive and
[53:59] maybe maybe heard a stretch verse and a
[54:01] yawn oh good King live forever you know
[54:04] I'm still
[54:06] here you
[54:08] see nothing could stop Daniel Walking
[54:11] with God Shadrach mesach and abedo had
[54:14] the same kind of Footwear on we know the
[54:15] story as well but it's good to go back
[54:16] to these things I think I me so now Dano
[54:19] they would they would not allow see see
[54:21] it's amazing how you
[54:24] know they did not allow anything to
[54:26] become come between them and their God
[54:29] so when when when controversy came they
[54:32] walked into it because their walk with
[54:35] God was far more important than what
[54:37] everyone else was doing amen I mean they
[54:39] stood before the king and said oh good
[54:42] King live forever we will not worship
[54:44] this image that you have created isn't
[54:47] it amazing how people will make images
[54:50] of the word their opinions or fashion
[54:53] ideas or brother Ram said this the
[54:54] message says this the Bible means this
[54:57] I'm not bowing down to those kind of
[54:59] images he had already seen God come on
[55:02] the scene sadra misho had seen God the
[55:05] the Living God come down on the scene of
[55:08] Babylon for them I mean they were
[55:09] worshiping the true God so how on Earth
[55:13] could they bow to man's opinion when
[55:15] they already met the true and living God
[55:17] I mean the true and living God had
[55:18] turned up before the king's idea had
[55:21] already come amen so nothing could make
[55:24] them bow to man's IDE idea basically
[55:27] they could have said oh King because the
[55:28] king even said will you not bow to the
[55:30] image I have made so the king wasn't
[55:33] trying to pretend this was actually God
[55:34] made this statue no he said no I built
[55:37] this thing and if people were honest
[55:40] with their websites and their ideas and
[55:42] things I'd say no no I have made this
[55:43] image the image I have made will you bow
[55:46] down to this image this opinion I have
[55:48] made and the believer with the because
[55:50] these Footwear do not allow you to bow
[55:53] to anything but the word of
[55:55] God it doesn't it it doesn't cause you
[55:57] to bow to man's opinion doesn't matter
[56:00] how uncomfortable it may feel there's
[56:01] something in you say I'm going to stand
[56:03] this is wrong I'm not bound to your
[56:05] image that you've set up because your
[56:07] image is dead there's no reality to it
[56:09] it doesn't prove the word of God it
[56:10] doesn't Manifest this word I mean they
[56:13] could say no I've seen the god of the
[56:14] Bible step out of history I mean I've
[56:17] seen the god that spoke to Moses spoke
[56:19] to Abraham spoke to Noah I mean spoke to
[56:21] David now speaks to us I mean we've had
[56:23] prayer O King and God has come down far
[56:26] greater than your image far greater than
[56:27] all your pump and your music The Very
[56:29] God Of Heaven stepped down and given us
[56:31] visions and revealed himself so we're
[56:33] not going to bow to you we are going to
[56:36] so what will you bow to I'm going to bow
[56:39] to the Lord God Almighty which is his
[56:41] word doesn't matter who gives the
[56:43] opinion doesn't matter who Fashions an
[56:45] image I'm not
[56:47] interested amen yeah and they said oh
[56:51] good King we will not be careful how
[56:53] we're going to answer you our God can
[56:55] deliver us but but if not we're still
[56:57] not
[56:57] bowing amen so so these shoes took them
[57:01] into a furnace it took them through peer
[57:04] pressure it took them throughout see
[57:06] they would have felt no doubt very
[57:07] uncomfortable they knew what was coming
[57:10] they saw the image being built it wasn't
[57:11] built overnight they saw it be built
[57:14] they probably would have seen the plans
[57:15] of it in the king's Palace they knew the
[57:17] day of the ceremony of the unveiling
[57:20] they knew they were invited they knew
[57:22] the circumstances if they don't bow they
[57:24] still went
[57:26] they still went they knew the
[57:29] repercussions they still went so they
[57:32] went so these shoes took them through
[57:34] all those feelings of sticking out in
[57:36] trouble and the mind battles and what
[57:37] may happen all these things they walked
[57:39] right through those things and now they
[57:41] found themselves standing in a furnace
[57:44] amen but the one who gave the shoe
[57:46] stepped down into the furnace Hallelujah
[57:48] and you know what brother R says he says
[57:50] he says when shad mesach and abedo were
[57:52] in the furnace the Lord Jesus himself
[57:54] was in there telling them of what they
[57:57] were going to enjoy Hereafter he was
[58:00] standing there telling them of their
[58:02] future Hallelujah so these shoes will
[58:04] take you into a very hard situation
[58:06] where God steps down proves himself and
[58:10] as he's proving himself he's saying this
[58:12] is not your end we're having a marvelous
[58:15] time here but I'm going to take you over
[58:17] there amen and over there there's no
[58:18] furnaces streets of gold amen you'll be
[58:21] in you'll be in Eternal bodies
[58:24] hallelujah amen you'll be dancing around
[58:26] my Throne
[58:27] redeemed Hallelujah this why this is
[58:29] where these shoes take you amen so so
[58:32] they had a glorious time and you what's
[58:34] amazing where these shoes because our
[58:37] steps are ordered of the Lord they know
[58:39] what's going on in here so they will
[58:42] take you places that cause complexes to
[58:46] be broken yeah they cause you to go to
[58:48] places where things that bind you are
[58:51] loosed Hallelujah why because they were
[58:54] actually thrown into the furnace back
[58:56] and they walked out free am me so they
[58:59] walked they were thrown in they couldn't
[59:01] move they couldn't do anything they were
[59:02] thrown in there but then they walked out
[59:04] and they didn't even smell like the
[59:06] furnace Hallelujah that's how great
[59:08] these shoes are I should be a shoe
[59:09] salesman no these kind of shoes yes but
[59:13] these are the best kind of
[59:15] shoes hallelujah amen these are the best
[59:18] ones and I pray you're wearing them
[59:20] tonight amen now you've got to realize
[59:24] that we we walk we possess I'm just
[59:28] going to maybe wipe up Round Up finish
[59:31] up with this kind of thought now these
[59:35] shoes in the natural took them out of
[59:38] Egypt and took them into the promised
[59:40] land now we're going from this world
[59:43] into glory amen right and we're going to
[59:46] make some
[59:47] footsteps amen amen today you made some
[59:50] footsteps
[59:51] spiritually amen every day we should be
[59:54] climbing higher so it doesn't feel like
[59:57] I'm really climbing high but then if you
[59:58] look back long enough you'll see I've
[1:00:00] actually ascended what you were a year
[1:00:02] ago I'm trust you're not the same person
[1:00:04] tonight amen now Joshua was told by God
[1:00:08] wherever you put the soul of your foot
[1:00:10] is yours amen so wherever he stood it
[1:00:12] was his amen so it didn't matter what
[1:00:16] the promise was it didn't matter how big
[1:00:18] the enemy was stopping him getting that
[1:00:20] promise God said you're going to stand
[1:00:22] there you're going to possess it amen so
[1:00:25] so so Jericho looked like a big city but
[1:00:28] there came a moment after God gave him
[1:00:30] the instructions he stood in Jericho he
[1:00:33] didn't he didn't just walk around at see
[1:00:34] a um Rahab in her house no he stepped
[1:00:37] into Jericho and Jericho became their I
[1:00:40] mean AI um AI was a disappointment at
[1:00:43] first but there came a point where he
[1:00:45] stepped into AI it became his amen when
[1:00:49] they crossed Jordan it became his amen
[1:00:51] every every place they stood became
[1:00:54] theirs and that's why Joshua when he got
[1:00:57] those five Kings out of the cave he told
[1:00:59] us princes stand on the neck of your
[1:01:02] enemies am mean cuz he's telling them
[1:01:04] listen that's your possession amen these
[1:01:07] five senses are your possession amen the
[1:01:10] gates into the spirit are your
[1:01:11] possession I mean you can stand on the
[1:01:13] neck of your imagination of your
[1:01:15] conscience your reason your affection
[1:01:16] your memory all these things you can
[1:01:18] have dominion over things over those
[1:01:21] things amen that's why the Lord says
[1:01:22] that we have we have the ability to
[1:01:24] bring every thought subject to
[1:01:27] Christ amen hallelujah amen but when he
[1:01:31] was walking amen he didn't just conquer
[1:01:33] cities and take out enemies no he got
[1:01:36] blessings amen Rahab got Deliverance
[1:01:38] because he walked Hallelujah person who
[1:01:42] was bound up in Jericho couldn't get out
[1:01:44] amen because because Joshua walked amen
[1:01:46] according to as God instructed him they
[1:01:48] came out alive amen and the you the
[1:01:52] burial place that Jo um you that Joseph
[1:01:54] was buried that became the possession of
[1:01:56] Joshua Hallelujah huj and he was he was
[1:01:59] buried where Abraham Sarah Isaac Jacob
[1:02:02] all the Patriarchs was buried was where
[1:02:04] Joseph was buried in the promised land

[1:02:09] his
[1:02:10] possession praise God Amen we possess a
[1:02:13] place of Resurrection amen there's the
[1:02:16] there's no Resurrection in Egypt in the
[1:02:18] world Amen there's no place of there's
[1:02:20] no Rapture in that place amen but in
[1:02:22] Christ Jesus our lord amen there is
[1:02:24] resurrection there is Rapture amen so

[1:06:46] brother ramam says the Keystone of the
[1:06:48] whole Bible the thing that holds it
[1:06:49] together is the fact that Jesus Christ
[1:06:51] is the same yesterday today and
[1:06:54] forever amen let say okay I'm just going
[1:06:56] to finish with this
[1:06:57] quote and then and then the musicians
[1:06:59] can come I don't want to keep you too
[1:07:00] late brother speaks about a apple tree
[1:07:04] he says did you know every bushel of
[1:07:05] apples every Apple every Blossom every
[1:07:08] leaf that would be ever on that tree is
[1:07:10] on it right then did you know that you
[1:07:12] know you might uh gather 200 bushel of
[1:07:15] Apple off of that tree and every one of
[1:07:17] them is in that little tree when it's
[1:07:20] that big if it isn't where did it come
[1:07:23] from tell me who puts it on there it's
[1:07:25] it's in the tree when it begins and
[1:07:27] that's just the way what you have what
[1:07:30] you have to do with the tree you take
[1:07:31] the tree and you plant it in the ground
[1:07:34] and then you have to water it and as you
[1:07:36] water it it doesn't do nothing but drink
[1:07:39] drink drink it has to drink more than
[1:07:41] its portion and the more it drinks the
[1:07:43] bigger it swells out it just pushes out
[1:07:45] limbs then it pushes out leaves and it
[1:07:47] pushes out blossoms then it pushes out
[1:07:49] apples is that right and that's the way
[1:07:51] a Christian is we're planted together in
[1:07:53] Christ Jesus who is the in exhaustible
[1:07:56] Fountain of Life we are planted in
[1:07:58] Christ and we just drink and drink and
[1:08:00] drink and push out everything we have
[1:08:02] need of for the Earthly Journey Divine
[1:08:04] Healing the power of God and all of
[1:08:06] these things is in every individual here
[1:08:09] that's received the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:11] Ghost for your planted in Christ am mean
[1:08:14] what you drink drink drink you push out
[1:08:16] to Joy I mean you drink drink drink you
[1:08:19] push out to peace peace grows Joy grows
[1:08:22] overcoming power grows why because
[1:08:23] you're drinking and pushing out it's a
[1:08:25] life that's within you it's pushing out
[1:08:28] it's not you trying to produce a fake
[1:08:29] peace no it's God produces his own peace
[1:08:32] amen everything in US everything for
[1:08:35] this Earthly journey is in us this is
[1:08:36] how great these shoes are these are good
[1:08:39] shoes I like these shoes I hope I don't
[1:08:41] sound sacrilegious saying things like
[1:08:42] that amen the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir
[1:08:45] and everything you have need of for uh
[1:08:47] for this life's journey even the Rapture
[1:08:49] is in you right then why because
[1:08:52] remember this remember the these shoes
[1:08:55] which the preparation pie of the Gospel
[1:08:57] prepares us to give the Messiah a fit
[1:09:00] reception amen so that's why I can say
[1:09:03] that the Rapture brother say the Rapture
[1:09:05] is in you right then don't resent that
[1:09:07] that's the truth the Rapture is in us
[1:09:08] now I'll prove it by the gospel those
[1:09:11] who he called he justified and those who
[1:09:14] he justified Heath glorified Hallelujah
[1:09:16] then in heaven today we are glorified in
[1:09:18] the presence of God right now I'm just
[1:09:20] pushing out to it amen glory god is in
[1:09:22] his word do you believe it all right
[1:09:25] huah so just drink and push out that's
[1:09:28] it right you want to go walking with God
[1:09:31] drink and then push out to that walk you
[1:09:34] want a closer walk with God drink it in
[1:09:37] and push out that's why this world is so
[1:09:39] full of nonsense that fills our minds
[1:09:42] cuz the devil doesn't want us to drink
[1:09:44] and push out because he knows if we
[1:09:46] drink we're going to push out Victory
[1:09:49] amen we're going to drink and push out
[1:09:50] his demise amen we're going to drink
[1:09:52] amen and push out we're going to tread
[1:09:54] on his head
[1:09:56] amen have victory in every part of our
[1:09:57] life amen we drink we're going to push
[1:09:59] out overcoming power that that overcomes
[1:10:02] this
[1:10:03] flesh amen so this is why friends you
[1:10:06] say well I want to habitually walk with
[1:10:08] God how to do that drink in his word and
[1:10:11] push
[1:10:12] out enjoy the goodness of God you say
[1:10:15] the devil says well you don't feel like
[1:10:17] reading your Bible what does it even
[1:10:18] mean cuz you're not a Christian I'm just
[1:10:20] going to go back to that cuz I like that
[1:10:22] though you know you don't feel like an
[1:10:24] overcomer today the devil tell tells you
[1:10:25] what does that even feel like just I say
[1:10:27] what does it feel like to be a Glo I'll
[1:10:28] never tell you what that means cuz I
[1:10:30] don't know what does it feel like to be
[1:10:32] a Christian I don't
[1:10:33] know but I'm one cuz I believe it amen
[1:10:36] we believe it by faith do we not amen
[1:10:39] these are Faith shoes so let God let
[1:10:41] these remember when brother Braham left
[1:10:43] the scene he left us with shoes that
[1:10:46] work right he would he would he would
[1:10:48] explain it uh in a slightly different
[1:10:50] way and it is the rising of the sun he
[1:10:52] would speak about a car two cars
[1:10:56] just came off the assembly line perfect
[1:10:58] everything's perfect about them one has
[1:11:00] spark plugs the other does not have
[1:11:01] spark plugs so both can talk about what
[1:11:04] they are but only one can prove what it
[1:11:06] is I mean both can say the specs of the
[1:11:09] engine and how fast it go from Z to 100
[1:11:11] all those things only one can prove it
[1:11:13] amen only one can prove that's gasoline
[1:11:16] in the tank yeah amen and so and so that
[1:11:19] car if you got in that car it would take
[1:11:21] you where you needed to go a car that
[1:11:24] works like my car works it's going to
[1:11:26] take me
[1:11:27] home I know it's going to take me home
[1:11:29] cuz it got me here I have confidence I
[1:11:32] believe my car works right and when
[1:11:35] brother Bram left he left a car a gospel
[1:11:37] that works amen he left shoes that he
[1:11:41] walked in himself and said these shoes
[1:11:43] work amen that everywhere he went he had
[1:11:47] Victory he had victory over himself he
[1:11:50] had victory over the devil amen he had
[1:11:52] victory over religious Spirits he had
[1:11:54] victory over skeptic ISM science
[1:11:56] whatever it is he had victory over
[1:11:58] everything why because he let the shoes
[1:11:59] that he was that got put on his feet
[1:12:02] walk him into Victory amen and when he
[1:12:04] left he said put on these shoes yes amen
[1:12:08] so we've had one that's proven these
[1:12:10] shoes
[1:12:11] work hallelujah amen he so let's not
