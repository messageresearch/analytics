[9:55] good evening Saints brothers and sisters
[9:59] what an tremendous week we have had
[10:03] trials and tribulations I can give a
[10:07] quick testimony if that's allowed on the
[10:11] camp we were we were rejoicing we were
[10:14] busy maybe before I say that can I just
[10:18] be slightly biased and and acknowledge a
[10:21] few a few cells in ailments we've had
[10:25] we've had this camp set up and we've
[10:27] never never done this this magnitude
[10:29] this the sighs I wish brother Stewart
[10:33] just came but early and help us out god
[10:36] bless you brother now just joking but um
[10:38] yeah brother a month sitting there at
[10:41] the back on his post of duty making
[10:43] everything works tracing as he as he as
[10:46] he does sometimes but he pushed through
[10:49] and he was he was on his post for a
[10:52] reason and he saw Souls come to the
[10:54] altar and give everything and surrender
[10:58] everything and throw those shackles off
[11:00] and I want to acknowledge them and then
[11:02] young ones
[11:03] well the Caleb day at the back he was
[11:06] sitting there behind that desk and trust
[11:08] me if I was his age I would not have
[11:11] been there I know for a fact and he was
[11:15] on his post of duty and he was stressed
[11:17] and he was wanting to to not disturb the
[11:21] atmosphere and created and help it and
[11:24] and and and make the the Holy Spirit and
[11:27] the time of worship welcomed he was
[11:30] trying to get that words as fluently as
[11:33] quickly up and we've had limitations we
[11:35] have we had our struggles but he just
[11:38] made it work and but the Kris maybe
[11:40] that's honors on the boat it was next to
[11:43] him and they made a tremendous good team
[11:45] obviously we have blessed all the all
[11:48] the musicians that helped us out but is
[11:51] those people that sometimes you don't
[11:52] see I just want to lift them up and say
[11:54] they were a true blessing to me
[11:57] I probably pretended Jesus walking there
[11:59] with the iPad and pretending to know
[12:01] what I'm doing I definitely did not they
[12:05] they were they were the handiwork there
[12:06] in the back and sitting behind the
[12:08] screens and sometimes we we could we
[12:11] could just miss that but that helped
[12:13] make that camp tremendous yes handclaps
[12:18] of praise Amen with we've had a quick
[12:23] testimony or two about about the camp
[12:25] and what's what the Lord's done I was
[12:28] busy with the sound and I was I was just
[12:30] praising the Lord I think it was son was
[12:32] a Saturday night Sunday night
[12:33] sister Lonnie would know but um we were
[12:36] just oh I was just having a wonderful
[12:38] time and and seeing the people and as
[12:41] they go forward and as that that rush
[12:45] just comes to me I'm thinking of names
[12:47] and the names it's just coming in my
[12:49] head and I'm it's a break for them yes
[12:51] Lord and just the Christine was here and
[12:54] I prayed for her leg and her ankle so
[12:55] this needs to be healing Jesus Christ's
[12:57] name and I remember you know Joshua was
[13:00] so sincere he wanted to do to worship
[13:03] you know but his his voice was keeping
[13:05] you know holding him back I said pray
[13:07] for I just want him to to enjoy the
[13:10] fellowship as I am and don't take away
[13:12] his voice Lord and I'm just praying for
[13:14] all the sick and I've been I've been
[13:17] having back issues since I was young you
[13:19] know and couldn't play rugby at a
[13:21] certain age and couldn't play cricket
[13:23] and had to stop this and do that and and
[13:26] and one of the one of the muscles were
[13:29] acting up again with all the you know
[13:31] picking up and loading and standing the
[13:33] whole day and and you know I'm there in
[13:36] pain but I'm glorifying the Lord you
[13:39] know it's this this flesh doesn't have
[13:41] anything on us and all of a sudden while
[13:44] I was praying now for sister Christine
[13:45] and Joshua was on my mind there was
[13:47] someone else going to the front this
[13:49] pain just shot it just released it was
[13:53] like a little band that you just shoot
[13:54] into the air and I had to stop for a
[13:57] split second and think that this just
[13:59] happened because all of a sudden this
[14:01] tension in the back is gone all of a
[14:03] sudden I can move and everything just
[14:05] feels so free and that was my that was

[36:44] on unlocking your faiths true potential
[36:47] tonight and you know I don't want to
[36:51] we're not so much going to major on
[36:53] rapturing faith or adoption faith which
[36:56] will unfold as we get closer to the end
[36:58] and I'm not going to major too much on
[37:03] the divine faith or the gifts of faith
[37:05] all right so just so it just as a
[37:08] foundation there we're going to really
[37:11] major on human faith tonight and major
[37:14] on that faith that that we have as when
[37:18] Jesus came to the the Gentile and
[37:20] Centurion and then he said great as thy
[37:23] faith great as thy faith now who in this
[37:27] room would like to
[37:28] Jesus to say that about you would you
[37:31] like him to say great as thy faith I
[37:33] would like Jesus to say that about me
[37:36] amen amen hallelujah and do you know
[37:39] what that is your inheritance it's not
[37:42] meant to be
[37:43] anyone with oh ye of little faith
[37:44] anymore because we're coming so close to
[37:47] the rapture that he's clearing out all
[37:49] the things that would make you oh ye of
[37:51] little faith
[37:52] amen hallelujah and I know I know that
[37:56] we struggle there's lots of struggles we
[37:59] get frustrated I can't pray in this cult
[38:02] doesn't go away why doesn't the cult go
[38:04] away
[38:05] we have those we're all just in this
[38:07] flesh all right but I want to the Lord's
[38:10] giving a burden on my heart you know we
[38:11] want that to finish I don't want that
[38:14] anymore
[38:14] hallelujah I don't want to have a little
[38:16] faith but I want to have great faith
[38:18] great human face face there has no
[38:21] hinder its face that can just believe
[38:22] like a child and simplicity amen
[38:26] hallelujah amen so we'll just tune now
[38:29] that we've got that under control
[38:31] a man will turn to Romans 12 verse 3
[38:35] amen hallelujah I felt on my heart to
[38:38] just say that because you know the faith
[38:40] is such a vast subject and it's like
[38:43] when you like the Lord gives the burden
[38:45] now the burden was that he would unlock
[38:47] not me but he would unlock our human
[38:50] faith to its true potential and but then
[38:54] you look at the subject you think man's
[38:56] faith is just this vast subject okay and
[39:00] you got to just hone it down and just
[39:01] just take your time on one aspect for
[39:04] tonight okay
[39:05] hallelujah amen amen Romans 12 verse 3
[39:09] assist for I say through the grace given
[39:11] unto me to every man that is among you
[39:14] not to think of himself more highly than
[39:17] he ought to think but to think soberly
[39:20] according as God has dealt to every man
[39:26] can everyone just say that every man the
[39:31] measure of faith amen may the Lord bless
[39:35] his word you may be seated
[39:38] every man has a measure of faith you are
[39:44] born with it it's yours you've been
[39:47] given it and it cannot be taken away
[39:49] from you that's there that's part of you
[39:52] that kept but like your five senses I
[39:55] will get into a bit more later but
[39:57] you've got see touch feel smell and hear
[40:00] right those five senses you were born
[40:03] with right actually you know a prophet
[40:05] came on the scene and he told us there's
[40:07] actually more than five there's six
[40:09] senses okay so let's get this really
[40:12] clear and really straight you have see
[40:16] smell touch taste hear faith it's part
[40:20] of you let's settle it now settle it now
[40:23] the devil will always try and tell you
[40:25] that faith is some eerie fairy thing
[40:27] that maybe you don't have much of let me
[40:30] just declare to you right now you have
[40:32] faith fullness of faith hallelujah amen
[40:36] and that faith can move mountains that
[40:40] faith can do all things as possible if
[40:42] that faith is completely clear and
[40:45] uninjured so you can have you're born
[40:49] with sight now let's say it's just a
[40:50] normal birth no troubles complications
[40:52] whatever and you're born with all your
[40:54] senses you're born with faith as well
[40:56] but do you know things can happen in
[40:58] your life things can you can come up
[41:01] against that can injure that folk injure
[41:03] that which sites can injure that hearing
[41:06] you can do things that can hurt those
[41:08] senses and the same thing is with faith
[41:11] and this world is designed designed to
[41:16] hinder faith this world is catering to
[41:19] see touch hear feel all of those ones
[41:23] but Satan does not want that faith realm
[41:26] in the first world he can't hit help the
[41:29] Africans and then they're just gone
[41:30] there and they believe everything and
[41:32] you just tell them those promises and
[41:33] they believe it there's no hindrance in
[41:36] that aspect but they also has its own
[41:39] issues on the dark side because there's
[41:42] worked crafts and spiritualism and
[41:43] everything and they just believe but
[41:45] here over here in the West and the first
[41:47] world countries the Devil attacks that
[41:50] faith and
[41:51] this plate that allies we just grow up
[41:53] in a garden of unbelief and grow up in a
[41:56] condition that hinders us from believing
[42:00] the simplicity of the gospel the
[42:02] simplicity of the promises that with
[42:05] faith as all things as possible amen
[42:09] Isaac touched on these things I'm going
[42:12] to go down a different channel but we
[42:14] are speaking about the same faith this
[42:17] is a faith that you have it's a faith
[42:19] that God has given you because he gave
[42:21] to every man a measure so you can say
[42:24] and declare boldly regardless of how you
[42:27] feel regardless of how injured your
[42:29] faith may be right now because many of
[42:32] us have injured faith but tonight let me
[42:34] tell you you're injured faith can become
[42:36] healed you're injured faith can be
[42:39] completely healed tonight all the dams
[42:42] that has dammed up through upbringing
[42:45] through schools things and through
[42:46] whatever through stuff that you allowed
[42:48] into your life and things all of those
[42:50] dams can be unblocked the Lord is here
[42:53] hallelujah he is here with a mission he
[42:57] is here with a vision he has sent us
[42:59] Elijah the Prophet and then he took a
[43:01] larger the Prophet after the message was
[43:03] given and the open book was revealed and
[43:05] that same angel is here tonight that
[43:08] same Gabriel is here tonight the one
[43:12] that announces the things of God the
[43:15] announcing angel is here tonight to
[43:19] announce to you to make you understand
[43:23] the vision because when you understand
[43:26] the vision hallelujah God's will God's
[43:29] plan all of these things when you
[43:32] realize what he's here to do for you
[43:33] when you realize what he's here to do
[43:36] for you and that that five-star general
[43:38] is here hallelujah to guide your
[43:41] campaign to guide your life to lift you
[43:43] up to make you understand to give you
[43:46] skill and understanding in the vision
[43:48] hallelujah so that you can see where you
[43:51] are and prophesy so that you can see who
[43:53] you are in Christ so that your true
[43:56] identity can be revealed and you can say
[43:58] yes that's me I believe that hallelujah
[44:02] sometimes I don't feel like that but I'm
[44:04] going to
[44:05] and I'm gonna declare it to my god
[44:07] because he is faithful no matter how I
[44:10] feel no matter what he's faithful and

[44:15] face may have encountered in your life
[44:17] the Lord is here to heal the Lord is
[44:20] here to clear the Lord is here to expose
[44:22] those enemies that is hidden down deep
[44:25] in your life the ones that the devil
[44:27] tells you that you'll never be delivered
[44:29] from the ones that seem too small and
[44:31] the people tells you it's too small it's
[44:33] just a little thing I can live with that
[44:34] you can't live with that hallelujah you
[44:37] cannot live with that don't live with it
[44:40] hallelujah make a stand against him
[44:43] hallelujah for the small things because
[44:46] you'll realize that when he starts
[44:48] dealing with that when the light shines
[44:50] on it and may he's trying some light on
[44:52] some things tonight when the light
[44:54] shines on it it become you realize how
[44:57] big that little thing really is that
[44:58] little tiny thing can be the thing
[45:01] that's blocking you from heaven great
[45:03] human faith amen hallelujah
[45:07] okay so we're going to just cover a few
[45:09] things here you know you get so nervous
[45:12] with this because it's such a cool
[45:13] subject so powerful that you know it's
[45:16] like man as a human as a person you like
[45:18] man I'm so insufficient to cover this
[45:20] but praise the Lord Luke 17 verse 3 to 6
[45:24] it says here now take heed to yourselves
[45:27] if thy brother trespass against thee
[45:29] rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
[45:33] and if he trespass against these seven
[45:36] times in a day and seven times in a day
[45:39] tune again to thee saying I repent thou
[45:42] shalt forgive him hallelujah
[45:45] forgive us to relinquish the right to
[45:48] surrender the right to hold it against
[45:50] him amen that's a true that's a it's an
[45:54] experience of forgiveness and the
[45:57] Apostles said unto the Lord because they
[46:00] hear the troubles of this they were like
[46:02] my goodness how are we going to do this
[46:03] because man they probably had lots of
[46:05] accounts and the louia remember this was
[46:07] before the Holy Ghost was poured out so
[46:09] these men probably had lots of accounts
[46:11] a lots of things that people did to them
[46:14] and remember they came under eye for an
[46:16] eye and a tooth for a tooth and
[46:17] no that thing is just bred into our
[46:19] culture and bred into the this world
[46:21] where people hold things against each
[46:23] other but you see we're of a different
[46:26] culture we're of a culture that's come
[46:28] from above and our culture came to us on
[46:30] there in the hands of an mighty angel
[46:32] hallelujah amen and he brought down a
[46:35] culture hallelujah and he gave it to a
[46:37] seventh angel and said here's my culture
[46:39] forgive hallelujah amen hallelujah
[46:43] don't hold no accounts amen hallelujah
[46:46] amen do you know it's such you know its
[46:48] grace because some nature's just find it
[46:51] very hard to forgive some nature's are
[46:53] very sticky
[46:54] we all got sticky nature's in some area
[46:56] but some people actually really struggle
[46:59] with this thing but did you know God's
[47:00] grace is greater than that stickiness
[47:02] God's grace is greater so if tonight the
[47:06] Lord has spoken to you about holding a
[47:09] grudge against somebody or being having
[47:10] unforgiveness in your heart for the
[47:12] tiniest little thing and summer camp
[47:14] just instantly let it go tonight is the
[47:17] night you can let that go
[47:18] amen because you see faith is based on
[47:21] forgiveness amen because look what they
[47:25] look what happens here it says in the
[47:27] pub after he's there talking about like
[47:30] you know Jesus is telling them why all
[47:31] of it there they would have been
[47:33] thinking on my seventy times seven why
[47:36] how do you do this Lord you know this
[47:38] would have been he would have known that
[47:40] this was going to stir up some feathers
[47:42] this was going to strike them backwards
[47:44] with their fear you know and they're
[47:45] gonna go Oh Lord so what are they ask
[47:47] the first thing they ask is Lord
[47:49] increase our faith
[47:50] help us Lord lit my faith lit the
[47:53] tributary that little river that comes
[47:55] out of me that little human faith
[47:57] amen that faith helped Peter walk on the
[48:00] water remember amen
[48:01] so let that faith access the grace of
[48:05] God to help me forgive and I pray that
[48:08] tonight tonight if what someone in here
[48:11] is needing that grace tonight
[48:13] - that's Harbor that they want to be
[48:16] delivered from harboring unforgiveness
[48:17] they want to be delivered from harboring
[48:20] something that's hindering their faith
[48:21] it's just simple that's the simple the
[48:24] grace let your faith now just just hold
[48:27] those things aside let them aside and
[48:29] say Lord Here I am in the middle of this
[48:31] while in the middle of where these
[48:33] things have happened to me and I can't
[48:34] get it it's so hard but just right now
[48:37] Lord give me some amnesty here give me
[48:39] em nasty from all these thoughts and
[48:41] everything that's troubling me about
[48:42] these people and all that they've done
[48:43] and all maybe they did and it was
[48:45] deliberate and all that stuff whatever
[48:47] it may be how bad it may be lord your
[48:49] grace is greater than that Lord let your
[48:52] grace come into my life let my little
[48:55] tributary river of my little stream now
[48:57] access the ocean because when you access
[49:00] that ocean my brother my sister
[49:02] hallelujah that ocean glory oh my I
[49:06] can't I'm not even gonna go any further
[49:08] for a bit yet hey man hallelujah oh my
[49:12] it makes me so excited because you see
[49:14] you can just bypass the sound barrier of
[49:17] all that unforgiveness bypass the sound
[49:19] barrier of all the troubles and all the
[49:20] things that they did to you and come up
[49:23] into a higher realm come up into a
[49:26] higher consciousness a higher thought
[49:29] process hallelujah
[49:31] a higher culture a culture that you
[49:34] actually come from amen because remember
[49:36] you're already an eternity in God's mind
[49:39] you're already part of that culture it
[49:42] just happened to be that you were
[49:43] incubated in this Western society or
[49:45] whatever society you came from it was
[49:47] incubated in it but you see God is just
[49:50] saying these things to you to break the
[49:52] amnesia to give you an opportunity that
[49:54] tonight don't just sit there and learn
[49:57] Amen this is not a learning session amen
[50:01] this is a you can travel tonight who
[50:03] wants to travel tonight travel into a
[50:06] higher experience in your Christianity
[50:09] travel in your faith from little faith
[50:12] to a great faith that can just say Lord
[50:14] at your word whatever it is Lord I
[50:16] believe it amen
[50:18] because you we all know that here yes we
[50:20] believe it's easy to believe you know
[50:23] it's true the Bible's true how can it
[50:25] not be God is faithful and in your heart
[50:27] and your soul but came from eternity I
[50:30] don't even need to tell you but I will
[50:31] amen it always believed you so cannot
[50:35] unbelief because it's part of God amen
[50:37] but this it's down in here it's down a
[50:40] neck that nature that remembers
[50:41] everything on my it's that one that we
[50:44] know as
[50:45] that one that the Lord connects is
[50:46] tonight so let that little faith that
[50:48] you may hit step out of the boat amen
[50:52] step out of it step out of it and into a
[50:55] higher walk with the Lord now these are
[50:57] simple simple simple things amen
[51:00] but you see we need real faith we need
[51:04] that faith
[51:05] hallelujah amen oh my if I just I just
[51:10] have to keep moving it and the Lord said
[51:12] if you had faith the grain of a mustard
[51:14] seed you might say onto the sycamore
[51:16] tree be thou plucked up by the root and
[51:18] be thou planted in the sea and it should
[51:21] obey you
[51:21] hello everyone restored back to Eden
[51:24] hello everybody restored back to the way
[51:26] it was before a fall it's all in you
[51:29] it's all in you right now all of it it's
[51:34] right in you amen
[51:36] and when you got born again at quickened
[51:38] it at quicken that seed it brought it to
[51:41] life amen hallelujah oh my vote for the
[51:45] new birth amen if someone doesn't have
[51:47] the new birth tonight is your night any
[51:50] of you in here amen if you don't have
[51:53] the new birth tonight is your night
[51:55] don't put it off to another camp you got
[51:57] a year who wants to walk again without
[51:59] the Holy Ghost amen let's do it now
[52:01] hallelujah heaven now
[52:04] hallelujah just surrender everything now
[52:07] the Lord knows he knows he knows he
[52:10] knows your heart you can say it all with
[52:12] your mouth you can cry down here you can
[52:15] cry all your light you can speak you can
[52:17] sing worship whatever but he's listening
[52:19] not so much to this but he's listening
[52:22] to this and he knows those things that
[52:25] you've been holding onto those things
[52:27] that's been hindering your faith Oh
[52:28] just surrender them tonight because
[52:30] there's a power in this room hallelujah
[52:32] they can change everything and raise
[52:35] your faith to move mountains raise your
[52:38] faith to do whatever the Lord wants you
[52:40] to do raise your face to connect you to
[52:43] the divine faith I said I wasn't going
[52:47] to go too far into the divine face but
[52:48] we have to see where it connects amen
[52:52] okay we hit the sea where it connects
[52:54] amen let me just put this in here for
[52:57] now
[52:58] so in Hebrews 11:1 it says now faith is
[53:01] the substance of things hoped for the
[53:03] evidence of things not seen
[53:06] I struggled with this for a long time to
[53:09] understand what it really meant because
[53:10] he said such a simple verse right it's
[53:13] so simple but it's like I know that
[53:15] verses means more than what I know what
[53:17] I understand and it still means more
[53:19] than what we could comprehend but and
[53:22] one day I was driving my car and I've
[53:24] probably for you people that have been
[53:26] around for more than three years maybe
[53:28] I've probably said this every time I
[53:30] used to say it a lot but I'll say it
[53:32] again so I'm driving my car and I'm like
[53:34] this is a problem for me I have to
[53:36] understand the scripture you know and
[53:38] I'm just I'm thinking it over my head
[53:41] faith is the substance of things faith
[53:43] is the substance of things what does
[53:45] this mean and then all of a sudden I
[53:48] just say it faith substantiates your
[53:52] hope the Lord help me just changing the
[53:57] word now I don't know I hope you know
[53:59] what substantiate means it's like
[54:01] another oh man I don't know you have to
[54:04] read that in the dictionary but faith it
[54:09] brings you it brings substance but let
[54:12] me just put this here so hope hope now
[54:16] hope is an expectation and anticipation
[54:18] with pleasure
[54:19] right you it's it's a Bible hope that's
[54:22] a real you because a true promise has
[54:24] been showing you and you are like yes I
[54:26] really believe that you know and then
[54:28] one day one day because God cooking that
[54:32] to you then all of a sudden the Spirit
[54:34] of the Lord comes down into your room or
[54:36] comes down into the service where you're
[54:37] sitting and tonight he can come to where
[54:39] you're sitting
[54:40] just let your faith got to him but your
[54:43] little tributary go up to him
[54:44] young people let your little river go up
[54:47] to him because he will speak to you he
[54:49] will change things for you now this
[54:52] little you know there's a promise for
[54:54] you maybe you're looking for something
[54:56] maybe you've seen something in the word
[54:57] you like Lord make this real to me and
[54:59] see there's an anticipation you've got a
[55:01] pleasurable anticipation amen
[55:04] and you're waiting on the Lord and it
[55:06] all of a sudden has mercy comes down and
[55:08] that great angel of the Lord that came
[55:10] down and for the message
[55:12] he gives you a revelation and he reveals
[55:15] to you he brings substance to what
[55:18] you've been hoping for and actually you
[55:21] know he will bring substance to the
[55:23] things that you've hopeful that pertain
[55:25] to the vision for your life that pertain
[55:27] to the calling of your life to pertain
[55:29] to the local vision that he's taking you
[55:31] at the people through that he's taking
[55:33] the church through he will give
[55:35] substance to the scriptures that pertain
[55:37] and eventually he builds and builds and
[55:39] builds and builds for scriptures builds
[55:42] these things that you're hopeful the
[55:44] scriptures that you've seen all of a
[55:46] sudden become reality and the will of
[55:48] God is revealed in it and God's will in
[55:51] his program and as counseling his wisdom
[55:53] and his life and his emotion and his
[55:55] feelings and all of those things comes
[55:57] with that revelation so that you can
[56:00] experience it and he takes the things
[56:02] that was just an intellectual heartfelt
[56:05] intellectual hope then all of a sudden
[56:08] becomes substance in your life amen and
[56:11] the will of God is revealed in it and
[56:12] now faith changes from living by a
[56:15] tributary into a divine faith into an
[56:18] ocean of faith an ocean that can change
[56:22] things an ocean that can move mountains
[56:24] amen hallelujah hope was substantiated
[56:28] by revelation of God's will walking in
[56:34] his vision amen but what about common
[56:40] hyssop faith because we read about this
[56:44] and I want to know about this because I
[56:47] want my common hyssop faith to not live
[56:51] in a life and yet not bogged down by
[56:54] some grudge that I've held that I've
[56:56] forgotten about but you know you can
[56:58] have grudges that you don't even know
[57:00] you've got that you've forgotten about
[57:01] and the Lord remembers and he knows he
[57:05] knows that that little gradual that
[57:07] little thing that you held against
[57:08] somebody down there his light will shine
[57:11] on that one day because he knows it's
[57:14] hindering your spirit that's hindering
[57:16] your subconscious that's hindering that
[57:18] River because remember he says those
[57:20] that believe on me out of their belly
[57:22] shall flow rivers of living water
[57:25] there's too many of these rivers of
[57:27] living waters that is not flowing as
[57:30] stumped up and it dribbles out here and
[57:33] there and every now and again you get
[57:34] something and you believe in there and
[57:35] all of a sudden God and His mercy does
[57:37] something for you and a sovereign grace
[57:39] takes over for you but he's actually
[57:42] really and what he's building us into is
[57:45] that that river will flow that that
[57:47] river will flow freely without any
[57:49] hindrance amen and I believe that we've
[57:52] come into the season as we heard on
[57:54] Sunday where all these things will be
[57:56] eradicated all these things will be
[57:58] clarified all the devil's works will be
[58:00] exposed and a very victory that was won
[58:04] on Calvary
[58:04] well the fullness of it the full measure
[58:07] that will help you to raise up as a son
[58:09] and a daughter knowing who you are will
[58:12] be realized
[58:13] amen he will substantiate these things
[58:16] that we've been hoping for amen these
[58:19] things that we've seen in the message
[58:20] you know they're children of Israel and
[58:22] Joshua preached to them the message
[58:24] Joshua was preaching them and showing
[58:26] them all their land but you see there
[58:28] were so many wars and so many struggles
[58:30] to get those betlem they had to fight
[58:33] for it they had to consult the captain
[58:35] amen and when they didn't consult the
[58:37] captain they fell on their face and the
[58:39] sins come in and all of these things
[58:41] happen but then all of a sudden later on
[58:44] the Lord in His mercy Amen who's
[58:46] thankful for the Lord's mercy the Lord
[58:48] and His mercy comes down and delivers
[58:50] them and you have an angelic visitation
[58:52] now it's the same angel that came down
[58:54] with the sword in his hand because he is
[58:56] faithful and he's intent on letting you
[58:59] gain your land letting you inherit
[59:02] everything that the Lord has given you
[59:04] and all that's been ministered to you in
[59:06] this message the Lord is intent on you
[59:10] having that but there is some healing
[59:12] that needs to take place there is some
[59:14] changing that needs to take place and
[59:16] the simplicity of your life and the
[59:18] simplicity of these things sees here but
[59:24] what it sees now you know this this
[59:26] human faith to believe in simplicity
[59:28] brother Branham sees an identification
[59:30] this is now sometimes faith is unknown
[59:33] to you you got it
[59:37] and you don't know it if you try to push
[59:40] yourself into something you miss it you
[59:43] go over the top of it it's so humble and
[59:45] simple see you actually have it and when
[59:50] you try and work everything up you see
[59:52] that this isn't quietness and Trust show
[59:54] you find salvation and quietness and
[59:56] rest resting and the promise is resting
[59:59] and the fact that we ever kept him we
[1:00:01] have a law the Lord who was guiding the
[1:00:04] army pushing the battle he's behind us
[1:00:06] bubbling and he's before us fighting and
[1:00:08] cutting but you see we have to be
[1:00:10] connected to that vision we have to be
[1:00:12] connected to his leadership so that he
[1:00:14] could he knows the bigger picture he
[1:00:16] knows all the things in our life and he
[1:00:18] knows that he's planned it all out and
[1:00:19] he's allowing you to go through these
[1:00:21] things so that he can reveal herself in
[1:00:23] you so he can reveal himself through the
[1:00:26] process Amen hallelujah brother branham
[1:00:31] sees this in ministry explained he sees
[1:00:33] now hope as one thing in faith as
[1:00:36] another faith is a positive sense it's
[1:00:39] not a guesswork you don't just imagine
[1:00:42] it it's just as real as any other sense
[1:00:44] of your body just the same as sighters
[1:00:47] sight is real hearing is real see taste
[1:00:51] feel smell and hear the five senses of
[1:00:53] the body that control the body
[1:00:55] they're real faculties to you if none of
[1:00:57] them is injured this is where that
[1:01:01] thought really came and then faith is
[1:01:03] just as real as any of the other five
[1:01:06] senses and more real because it'll go in
[1:01:09] and above those five senses and and
[1:01:12] above those five senses in and and above
[1:01:17] them amen
[1:01:18] to guide them but how does that work you
[1:01:21] know and our own experience when you
[1:01:23] have faith it connects you to God
[1:01:25] because without faith it's impossible to
[1:01:27] please God and so you see in here
[1:01:30] tonight as an opportunity and here
[1:01:33] tonight for each one of us is an
[1:01:34] opportunity for our faith to be stronger
[1:01:37] there's an opportunity if there is
[1:01:39] something in your life that's hindering
[1:01:40] faith that's pounding at you some spirit
[1:01:44] of unbelief you've got a question Lasell
[1:01:46] or why am I being troubled by the spirit
[1:01:48] of unbelief what's given him acts
[1:01:51] to trouble me all the time hallelujah
[1:01:55] and ask the Lord say Lord how do how am
[1:01:57] I going to overcome this because this
[1:01:59] has to be a personal thing for you this
[1:02:02] has to be a personal experience for you
[1:02:04] we can't just sit here and absorb the
[1:02:07] ministry in the word and then just go
[1:02:09] home you know and then just go and live
[1:02:13] your life but you have to personally now
[1:02:16] it's got to be a personal connection to
[1:02:19] the King a personal connection to her me
[1:02:21] say why Lord Jesus my faith can touch
[1:02:25] your hem of your garment
[1:02:27] it's better myiasis faith in the middle
[1:02:29] of the thronging crowds you see Jesus
[1:02:31] heard him he didn't have to make a big
[1:02:33] loud scream he just believed in faith
[1:02:36] stopped the king stopped the Lord he was
[1:02:39] an unimportant mission the Lord's always
[1:02:41] on an important mission but when when
[1:02:44] faith touches the hem of His garment
[1:02:45] remember he's the same tonight and if
[1:02:48] your faith can just touch His garment
[1:02:49] tonight amen don't let this go over your
[1:02:53] head or under your head or whatever you
[1:02:55] may think but just let your faith now we
[1:02:58] all know the things that the devil
[1:03:00] fights us with right and you say Lord
[1:03:03] tonight while we're here in the service
[1:03:05] Lord

[1:03:09] why we're all here why we're all can
[1:03:12] pray and the fires that come together
[1:03:13] and the devils are scared they're scared
[1:03:16] when the weakest of Christians gets down
[1:03:18] on their knees how many people can get
[1:03:20] down on their knees tonight and ask the
[1:03:22] Lord for deliverance ask the Lord for
[1:03:24] healing ask the Lord to heal that tiny
[1:03:26] thing that's down in there
[1:03:28] let's be niggling at you all these years
[1:03:30] and you just want it down I just want it
[1:03:33] gone Lord Lord Jesus

[1:03:45] life and you know when a promise comes
[1:03:48] sometimes and I say Lord I believe there
[1:03:50] is something downstairs just says no and

[1:04:12] more happy she becomes a more happy in
[1:04:14] the home so this is your home right but
[1:04:17] your soul needs to be more connected to
[1:04:19] the king hallelujah amen you know you

[1:04:44] loves you he comes down because he wants
[1:04:46] to help you hallelujah
[1:04:48] it's that personal touch the personal
[1:04:51] touch makes all the difference and all
[1:04:54] these things that you're hearing or the
[1:04:56] word that comes it becomes more of a
[1:04:57] reality when your spirit your emotional
[1:05:01] realm she becomes more happy inside you
[1:05:03] because when she's not happy man you
[1:05:06] have a troublesome home amen when wife
[1:05:09] is not happy it's a bad atmosphere you
[1:05:13] can have a bad atmosphere in that home
[1:05:15] but at first but when when when the soul
[1:05:17] is in a good place when the lord comes
[1:05:20] and he funnels through that anointing
[1:05:22] you know this healing that takes place
[1:05:24] in the human realm in the spirit because
[1:05:27] that she is the one that human spirit is
[1:05:29] the one that's causing all the trouble
[1:05:30] the one that revolts against but when
[1:05:33] there's an atmosphere of love in the
[1:05:35] home I'm talking about this home now the
[1:05:38] body when there's a love atmosphere
[1:05:40] because you're in communion when you're

[1:05:45] who I am
[1:05:46] Amen who God says I am Amen you know
[1:05:49] that identity and you just walk in there
[1:05:51] and you speak that and you live that and

[1:07:01] believe that and I claim that and I
[1:07:04] speak that and I sing that amen
[1:07:08] I believe that that's why it comes down
[1:07:12] that's that perfect love that's up there
[1:07:14] it's that river that's up there that
[1:07:16] river of life that just rolls down out
[1:07:19] of his throne hello Lou yeah you know

[1:07:24] little tributary or a little spring for
[1:07:27] him Alleluia he wants that to fly but
[1:07:31] there's certain little things stop amen
[1:07:36] and that's what I believe a look can
[1:07:38] deal with these things tonight
[1:07:40] hallelujah
[1:07:41] who believes that who really who
[1:07:43] believes that with all their heart that
[1:07:45] the Lord can deal with these things

[1:07:50] right tonight the the deepest things
[1:07:53] because we're in the season you know as
[1:07:56] the season unfolds you know and all of
[1:07:58] the vision and everything has been
[1:08:00] prophesied in the rapture and all the
[1:08:02] the third pole coming into its full
[1:08:04] manifestation really but you've got to
[1:08:06] look at the practical side of that now
[1:08:07] the Lord has to deal down and those
[1:08:10] little tiny things they're stopping it
[1:08:12] from happening
[1:08:13] because all that's been prophesied all
[1:08:15] the third pole the spoken word that can
[1:08:17] speak a world into existence and you go
[1:08:19] and live on it it's already in you but
[1:08:22] it's locked down it's locked up because
[1:08:24] of these little things niggle
[1:08:27] these little things that your nature
[1:08:30] holds against you but remember perfect
[1:08:34] love is here Jesus Christ is perfect
[1:08:38] love he is perfect love and we need to
[1:08:41] give him preeminence amen when you
[1:08:44] realize how God is manifesting in your
[1:08:47] hour amen remember we know all about the
[1:08:51] pyramid and the look at all of the
[1:08:53] different ages and their different
[1:08:55] anointings and the different attributes
[1:08:56] of God that was revealed in those ages
[1:08:59] who can tell me what is the attribute
[1:09:02] that is being revealed now perfect love
[1:09:07] so in this age to see that manifested
[1:09:12] and its full reality we need to anoint
[1:09:15] him King him perfect love King let
[1:09:19] perfect love be the king of your life
[1:09:21] let perfect love come down so when you
[1:09:25] just yield and rest and you get into an
[1:09:29] atmosphere where you can conceive a love
[1:09:32] atmosphere and in the Lord and you can
[1:09:36] conceive you know and you're resting and
[1:09:38] you're enjoying him and you were
[1:09:40] enjoying your prayer life and you're
[1:09:41] enjoying your Bible studies and you're
[1:09:43] enjoying fellowship and you're enjoying
[1:09:45] the sermons even these young people

[1:09:51] where you can enjoy the service enjoy
[1:09:54] him it's perfect love and perfect love
[1:09:58] casts out all fear and it's fear is the
[1:10:02] next thing that hinders faith so you've
[1:10:06] got unforgiveness hinders faith they
[1:10:10] wanted to move mountains that the Lord
[1:10:12] knew here to deal with something to
[1:10:13] other disciples they were holding too
[1:10:15] many grudges they needed to go from a
[1:10:17] age of law and accountability to an age
[1:10:21] of grace to a dispensation of grace so
[1:10:24] the law was teaching and he showed them
[1:10:26] and he revealed through their
[1:10:28] experiences just how much of that law
[1:10:30] was still in them because you see you
[1:10:32] took he took them out of the law but now
[1:10:35] you got to take the law out of him and
[1:10:36] he's taken us out of an educational age
[1:10:40] of men's ideas and now he's taking back
[1:10:43] out of us now our upbringings and our
[1:10:46] parents upbringing has been managed in
[1:10:50] their administration the way that it's
[1:10:52] been that Delta the way that we were
[1:10:54] brought up the way that we were bothered
[1:10:56] the way that we were mothered the way
[1:10:57] that schools the paradigm of thought
[1:11:00] that they talked now it's just
[1:11:02] completely gone
[1:11:02] it's just absolutely rubbish but back
[1:11:05] then there was solidity to it and there
[1:11:06] was a certain vision that they had but
[1:11:08] it was Victorian style leadership and
[1:11:11] rulership and law and hardness and
[1:11:14] toughness and self achievement and
[1:11:17] discipline and all of those esteems and
[1:11:19] everything like that but a hard rigorous
[1:11:21] affair but the Lord you see in this
[1:11:25] engrained into us it's ingrained into us
[1:11:27] it's ingrained into our parents and our
[1:11:29] parents brought us up like that and all
[1:11:31] of these things has been ingrained in
[1:11:32] but the Lord is taking us out of it the
[1:11:36] Lord is taking us out of that way whole
[1:11:38] of thing the whole way of thinking he's
[1:11:40] completely removed us out of it and now
[1:11:42] he's removing that out of us because all
[1:11:45] that logic all the logic that we learn
[1:11:49] in school as the logic of the tree of
[1:11:52] knowledge they used to teach Bible stuff
[1:11:56] but it was completely riddled with the
[1:11:58] tree of knowledge of course because it's
[1:12:00] an educational system but they had the
[1:12:02] Bible in their schools and they found it
[1:12:03] on this and that but they were still but
[1:12:05] the idea the Greek philosophical idea of
[1:12:08] logic and and the thoughts of all of
[1:12:10] these sages and things of the ages that
[1:12:13] they've encompassed into schooling
[1:12:14] systems is actually not heavenly logic
[1:12:18] I'll tell you heavenly logic I like
[1:12:21] heavenly logic heavenly logic works for
[1:12:24] me Amen hallelujah
[1:12:26] heavenly logic says that even if it
[1:12:29] looks impossible that's possible
[1:12:31] heavenly logic says then no matter how
[1:12:34] hard it is no matter how deep you've
[1:12:36] gone and sin no matter how bad that
[1:12:38] person did their thing to you heavenly
[1:12:40] logic says they're okay
[1:12:41] it wasn't really them it was actually
[1:12:43] the devil amen and the same bleep
[1:12:46] hallelujah the police your sins can
[1:12:49] bleach the problem that that person did
[1:12:51] for you can bleach them can absolve them
[1:12:53] can
[1:12:54] completely out of your whole spirit
[1:12:56] hallelujah all that stickiness and all
[1:12:58] that stuff that makes you shake and you
[1:13:00] have adrenaline when you think about it
[1:13:01] and it brings you down and weakens you
[1:13:03] hallelujah
[1:13:04] beer Azhar breats in this room and
[1:13:06] there's a power and a voice that can
[1:13:08] speak hallelujah to deliver you because
[1:13:11] as you as the one that's holding it
[1:13:13] against them and that power can deliver
[1:13:15] you from holding it against him a
[1:13:18] complete out of your spirit
[1:13:19] complete from all your emotions so
[1:13:22] that you can believe next time you get a
[1:13:24] cult you can say go leave you know Jesus
[1:13:29] they brought that guy that was foaming
[1:13:30] at his mouth and chucking himself in a
[1:13:32] fire had that demon and the demon was
[1:13:35] too strong for those disciples because
[1:13:37] they had unforgiveness all those things
[1:13:40] that he you know he slowly got it all
[1:13:42] out of them hallelujah so they could
[1:13:44] believe but first had to reveal the
[1:13:47] weakness that they had because they did
[1:13:50] really you know they gave them power to
[1:13:52] if they deliver right and they could say
[1:13:54] there was sons of God he said oh I'll
[1:13:56] bruise your heel so they were already
[1:13:58] stumbling on the devil but it was
[1:14:00] something that was just too much for him
[1:14:02] what was it the devil the higher up I
[1:14:05] don't know how it all works but
[1:14:06] obviously there's higher ones and lower
[1:14:08] ones and more powerful ones
[1:14:09] now those ones there they have a bit
[1:14:11] more of a higher law degree in there in
[1:14:13] in spiritual law they can go out to the
[1:14:15] Lord and say actually hold on what about
[1:14:17] the subclause be twelve fourteen six
[1:14:19] seven seven seven three what about that
[1:14:23] sub-clause and when we merge that with
[1:14:24] this case that happened in 512 after
[1:14:29] Adam what about that you see that demon
[1:14:32] must have known a bit more than the last
[1:14:34] ones and so he goes and he brings it
[1:14:36] before the Lord it says now I'm not
[1:14:38] coming down ain't coming out amen
[1:14:42] look we've got unforgiveness in them
[1:14:44] even though you've given them power but
[1:14:47] those little demons that already cast
[1:14:49] there they might not have no in there so
[1:14:50] they remove but these ones were a bit
[1:14:53] stronger they had a bit more knowledge
[1:14:54] on them and they said no I'm not leaving
[1:14:55] because they've got this this and this
[1:14:57] and this so they're a bit more knowledge
[1:14:59] of logic and because you see God's laws
[1:15:03] as all legal stuff as well there's all
[1:15:05] different things in this while the
[1:15:06] accuser
[1:15:07] the brethren is cast out why because
[1:15:09] perfect love amen when perfect love
[1:15:12] comes it casts out the accuser of the
[1:15:15] Brethren and when you could get to a
[1:15:17] place when your faith can be healed
[1:15:19] look I just pray Lord heal some faith
[1:15:23] heal some faith so that we can have
[1:15:27] access to this divine love on a personal
[1:15:30] practical way sorry I'm getting excited
[1:15:33] man I don't know how to explode you
[1:15:38] understand hallelujah I need to write a
[1:15:44] song I get so excited I just cannot
[1:15:49] fight it I'm going up and I'm going to
[1:15:52] pop or something like that I don't know
[1:15:57] amen Amanda there you go bro you know
[1:16:01] what I mean
[1:16:02] amen if Shannon was here she would know
[1:16:05] what I mean I've seen her pop a few
[1:16:06] times you just get so full of joy and
[1:16:13] it's so simple it's the most simple
[1:16:15] thing as having faith that hasn't got a
[1:16:18] blockage or a damming or you know
[1:16:21] something that this hinders that little
[1:16:23] do you know brother Brandon said
[1:16:25] this is how sensitive these things are
[1:16:27] really sensitive he's he says you know
[1:16:31] I'm paraphrasing that's it's a long time
[1:16:33] since I read her but he says basically
[1:16:35] like you know the if someone comes up in
[1:16:39] the healing line and he says even if
[1:16:41] there's a tiny little shadow like a
[1:16:43] little shadow that blocks them from
[1:16:46] getting their healing and it's just a
[1:16:47] little tiny thing of the fort or
[1:16:49] something he says that little shadow can
[1:16:51] stop them from their healing and he can
[1:16:53] see into it and demons stringing from
[1:16:55] that one to that one and all of what's
[1:16:57] going on you know even in the service I
[1:16:59] mean you know now it's kind of broken
[1:17:02] but before there was just like demons
[1:17:04] fighting and trying to stop the
[1:17:07] anointing and trying to push back but
[1:17:08] then the Lord just breaks it amen the
[1:17:11] Lord's grace comes and he steps and you
[1:17:13] just gotta keep pushing and it's like
[1:17:14] that when you pray it's like that when
[1:17:15] you sit sometimes it's just you don't
[1:17:17] feel nothing and you feel like man as
[1:17:19] the devil fighting you
[1:17:21] it's the devil fighting you he doesn't
[1:17:23] want you to pray he doesn't want perfect
[1:17:25] life to come down and heal
[1:17:27] he doesn't want perfect loved you he
[1:17:28] doesn't want you to sit here and have
[1:17:30] perfect life coming all over you why do
[1:17:32] you think these people in this room that
[1:17:33] are rejoicing amen why is it and then
[1:17:37] there's some people going why is what do
[1:17:39] they see in this what's going on here
[1:17:41] why are they so happy hallelujah
[1:17:45] now I don't mean like an outward of
[1:17:47] emotion or anything I'm just talking
[1:17:48] about in the heart you're sitting there
[1:17:50] and there's something happening and
[1:17:52] you're rejoicing and you're enjoying and
[1:17:54] it's it's perfect love it's because this
[1:17:57] faith you're believing you're you're in
[1:18:00] a communion you're in a channel with the
[1:18:02] Lord and he's coming down to do things
[1:18:04] for you so that a service is not just
[1:18:07] sitting there listening to a sermon and
[1:18:09] getting a bit more knowledge as nice as
[1:18:11] it is to know a few more things it's
[1:18:13] fine by higher the net cuz we've come
[1:18:17] out of the man age we've come out of an
[1:18:19] age of knowledge increase would come up
[1:18:21] to an age of deliverance an age where
[1:18:25] you will be given a glorified body an
[1:18:27] age of rapturing faith an age where you
[1:18:31] come into the very image the atom lost
[1:18:35] an image that was displayed in the first
[1:18:38] second Adam when he came to the earth
[1:18:40] and there and he took the four Matthew
[1:18:43] Mark Luke and John the lion the ox of
[1:18:45] man and the ego and he took those
[1:18:46] anointings and he captured that life and
[1:18:49] then he put that life into pages and
[1:18:51] then that life was manifested and you
[1:18:54] read it and you see a life on display he
[1:18:57] was actually showing the life that
[1:18:59] you're coming to this you'll this is
[1:19:01] your inheritance this is an inheritance
[1:19:03] and the church has gone through all
[1:19:04] these ages and up and down and finally
[1:19:06] come back in its time it is time that is
[1:19:10] why these things is coming forth that is
[1:19:12] why he's dealing in your life now
[1:19:13] tonight you can take that opportunity
[1:19:15] amen hallelujah so and this is here and
[1:19:27] Matthew 11 no sorry mark 11 verse 22 25
[1:19:31] it says and in the morning as they
[1:19:32] passed by they saw the fig tree
[1:19:34] dried up from the roots and Peter
[1:19:36] calling to remembrance saith to them
[1:19:38] master behold the fig tree which thou
[1:19:41] cursed as withering away and Jesus
[1:19:44] answering saith unto them have faith in
[1:19:47] God for verily I say unto you that
[1:19:49] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:19:51] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:19:53] the sea shall and hence shall not doubt
[1:19:55] in his heart so you see there is a
[1:19:58] clause there and if he didn't put that
[1:20:00] there
[1:20:01] you know if he didn't put that there we
[1:20:03] would be already speaking worlds into
[1:20:04] existence if that clause wasn't there
[1:20:06] but the Lord knows just like he knew
[1:20:08] that Israel when they first came into
[1:20:10] the land they didn't have the maturity
[1:20:12] as a nation to handle the inheritance
[1:20:14] but he said but I will give it to you
[1:20:16] but it'll be little by little if you
[1:20:18] just followed my captain if you follow
[1:20:20] my angel with the open book if you just
[1:20:22] have a love relationship with him and
[1:20:24] let him lead you as Jesus Christ an
[1:20:26] angelic form if you just let the Holy
[1:20:28] Ghost lead you with the open book in his
[1:20:30] hand he will guide you through the land
[1:20:32] little by little where you get it just
[1:20:34] like with Israel when that captain came
[1:20:36] down he said little by little just just
[1:20:38] beware of that angel he's going to cause
[1:20:41] you to and here at your land you're
[1:20:42] gonna get it but you see straightaway
[1:20:44] you don't have it all right away there's
[1:20:47] a clause there little by little because
[1:20:49] you need to grow a maturity to be able
[1:20:51] to handle that eternal word spoken power
[1:20:54] amen why do you think the Prophet our
[1:20:56] prophet William Branham had to go
[1:20:58] through so many hardships so much
[1:21:01] training so much so that he was
[1:21:04] completely and utterly surrendered to
[1:21:06] the king so surrendered because that one
[1:21:10] of the greatest events in history
[1:21:11] transpired on Mount sunset where a man
[1:21:14] who was born in sin hallelujah a man
[1:21:18] hallelujah who try to kill people a man
[1:21:22] who tried to commit suicide a man that
[1:21:26] went through all of these things just
[1:21:27] like you just like us
[1:21:28] Elisha was subject to like passions just
[1:21:31] like Weaver and we are but God put him
[1:21:34] through such a
[1:21:36] he had a race set before him that would
[1:21:39] prepare him for one of the greatest
[1:21:40] events the very purposed Calvary
[1:21:43] happened the very purpose of the blood
[1:21:45] being spilt the very purpose God and
[1:21:49] visits before the world even began that
[1:21:51] he would restore man
[1:21:52] then he would give man back that
[1:21:54] creative power but the word that
[1:21:57] creative power you see such a great
[1:22:00] event happened on that day when there
[1:22:02] was a prophet standing there redeemed
[1:22:04] man that came subject to the blood who
[1:22:07] had forgiven all because the bleach had
[1:22:09] come into his life and you see hid li
[1:22:11] all those things go and he was
[1:22:12] completely surrendered and now it came
[1:22:14] time where God would trust a man with
[1:22:16] the very power that Satan's wanted since
[1:22:19] time immemorial the very power and he
[1:22:23] and it came down in his hand that sword
[1:22:27] came down into his hand this is now a
[1:22:29] redeemed man that has the very things
[1:22:32] that Satan has always wanted the
[1:22:34] creative power and he says now go and
[1:22:38] preach this land preach this land the
[1:22:42] very angel that came down to Israel to
[1:22:46] free Rahab now could come inside a human
[1:22:50] be and hold the same sword hallelujah
[1:22:54] hallelujah the same sword I believe that
[1:22:59] was the same sword the one that freed
[1:23:02] Rahab hallelujah the one that a race to
[1:23:05] prostitution has three oh my Oh glory to
[1:23:09] his name it makes me like just amazed
[1:23:12] how the Lord can do these things and
[1:23:15] show it all like this it's same angel
[1:23:21] it's doing the same thing for you for me
[1:23:25] for all of us why do you think you're
[1:23:28] struggling why do you think you're
[1:23:29] suffering because you shall be found in
[1:23:32] the likeness of a suffering he has a
[1:23:34] purpose for he has a purpose for those
[1:23:36] mind bells he's got a purpose that enemy
[1:23:39] is just a tool
[1:23:40] he's only can go so far he will not take
[1:23:43] the Lord will not let him go any further
[1:23:45] then he's allowed and all of those
[1:23:48] things that's happening is for
[1:23:49] purpose because the Lord needs to remove
[1:23:53] some things out of lives these things in
[1:23:56] our lives that need to be removed little
[1:23:59] things and that's why the Devils allowed
[1:24:01] so far that's why he's been allowed to
[1:24:03] squat on certain parts of your land but
[1:24:06] little by little I will give you the
[1:24:08] land little by little
[1:24:09] I will heal your faith little by little
[1:24:12] those injuries that are causing those
[1:24:14] tributaries to block up little dams
[1:24:16] every now and again it spurts forth and
[1:24:18] you're at camp and the barriers go down
[1:24:20] but the enough to camp and after these
[1:24:22] things happen it starts to form up again
[1:24:24] those little beavers start to build up
[1:24:25] and that little thing that's been
[1:24:27] hounding you you know
[1:24:28] God is the cycle breaker there has to
[1:24:30] come a time where those cycles need to
[1:24:32] be broken completely and it has to go
[1:24:36] beyond you rejoicing over the thought
[1:24:38] about it it has to say you have to say
[1:24:40] Lord why not me why not now now come on
[1:24:46] hallelujah why put off for tomorrow the
[1:24:50] things that can be done today amen
[1:24:52] hallelujah because I believe we're in
[1:24:55] the very Alice the hours hallelujah oh
[1:25:00] why would he unfold all these things why
[1:25:03] would he show all these things why is
[1:25:05] the whole Bible coming open why is every
[1:25:07] type every story every character
[1:25:11] becoming personal because he's trying to
[1:25:15] show you who you are and the power that
[1:25:17] we live in we're living in a very
[1:25:19] special hour we're living you know we
[1:25:21] think oh man that's gonna be such a
[1:25:23] great time it's gonna be so awesome when
[1:25:25] it comes
[1:25:26] but then miss the very event that you
[1:25:30] might be finding yourself involved with
[1:25:32] right now right now remember it's so
[1:25:35] simple it's so humble if we get you know
[1:25:39] one of the greatest events in history
[1:25:41] the Prophet preaches before God and
[1:25:44] simplicity because he knows you know
[1:25:46] people are gonna miss this thing and
[1:25:48] they're gonna get caught up in this in
[1:25:50] there and the horse riders and caught up
[1:25:52] in there and the very backdrop has been
[1:25:55] causeth of all of it all the events and
[1:25:57] all of us and then in the Catholic
[1:25:58] Church and all its just backdrop the
[1:26:01] real event was taking place
[1:26:03] the Lord had descended down to reveal
[1:26:05] himself to his bride hallelujah so that
[1:26:08] he could begin the process of his coming
[1:26:11] hallelujah now this I say this candidly
[1:26:13] and I say this like you know because
[1:26:15] we're not but really this is one of the
[1:26:17] greatest events you know this is the
[1:26:18] whole thing is culminating the whole
[1:26:20] thing is turning into this great big
[1:26:22] crescendo and yet it feels if you think
[1:26:26] men age thoughts if you think
[1:26:28] intellectual thoughts of you look at too
[1:26:30] much Hollywood and see these
[1:26:31] denominational ideologies you'll miss it
[1:26:35] because you see now I'm gonna say
[1:26:37] something and prophets already said it
[1:26:39] but I'll say it anyway
[1:26:40] glamour its glamour okay I don't know
[1:26:43] really what the definition of glamour is
[1:26:44] but I'm gonna give you my definition of
[1:26:46] glamour glamour is a false facade a fake
[1:26:50] reality it's this whole tree of
[1:26:52] knowledge and all of its glory
[1:26:55] I don't call it's not really glory but
[1:26:57] it's it's an glory
[1:26:58] it's glamour now when you behold that
[1:27:01] glamour it paralyzes your faith so this
[1:27:05] your third thing now I can land the
[1:27:08] plane I've done my three points that
[1:27:10] we're gonna lend amen
[1:27:12] hallelujah glamour when we look at it
[1:27:16] and it's everywhere but you know these
[1:27:18] things they can be a real blessing but
[1:27:20] they can be a real curse too because on
[1:27:22] that screen can come glamour even in the
[1:27:25] middle of the glory you know you can be
[1:27:28] looking at something glorious and all of
[1:27:30] a sudden popping up on the side as
[1:27:32] glamour and the glamour you we all know
[1:27:35] this how they're to fix you instantly
[1:27:37] and I'm not talking about some explicit
[1:27:39] thing I'm just talking about just the
[1:27:42] ten everything the ten business whatever
[1:27:45] and you and you're in a spiritual time
[1:27:47] and I'm like man this is amazing I'm
[1:27:49] having a good time
[1:27:49] but then on the side I see a little
[1:27:51] thing pop up and it's clemmer and I
[1:27:53] instantly feel it it's like this pull
[1:27:55] it's like it's pulling me to that and
[1:27:58] it's pet and it's paralyzing faith so
[1:28:01] you were gonna be careful you have to be
[1:28:04] watchful this is the devil as a roaring
[1:28:05] lion secrets whom he may devour true
[1:28:11] lujah
[1:28:17] the prophecies in perfect faith so I'm
[1:28:21] gonna kind of when I read this that
[1:28:23] there's a backtracking a little bit but
[1:28:24] I just want to give some foundation and
[1:28:26] substance to what I've been saying
[1:28:28] because it's the Word of God and I
[1:28:31] believe it has an effect this is he says
[1:28:33] now faith is based on forgiveness then
[1:28:35] and then as we said this morning trying
[1:28:38] to get the church into the place to
[1:28:40] where we could really see apostolic
[1:28:42] times moving you know I think sometimes
[1:28:44] the Prophet says these things and it's
[1:28:46] kind of for them but it's actually
[1:28:47] almost more for us now you see like it's
[1:28:51] like he's saying these things and just
[1:28:53] like Paul said things in the beacons it
[1:28:54] kind of worked into a natural event that
[1:28:57] took place but then when we look at it
[1:28:58] we see the full reality of how it's
[1:29:00] really transpiring on a bigger picture
[1:29:02] for us okay so it's kind of like I
[1:29:04] believe it's like that with this message
[1:29:05] - it's prophetic this is here to get the
[1:29:12] church into the place to where we could
[1:29:14] really see apostolic times moving among
[1:29:16] us amen I believe that we're seeing that
[1:29:18] that's what we all hunger and that's and
[1:29:22] it's just laying right at the door we
[1:29:24] see it but we want to see more of it who
[1:29:26] wants to see more of it
[1:29:27] amen more of it guess what you can and
[1:29:30] you will because we're in an exciting
[1:29:33] time believe it amen
[1:29:36] sing it hallelujah every revival brings
[1:29:39] forth music every revival brings forth
[1:29:41] song and the song is not just for us to
[1:29:44] enjoy it's actually something for the
[1:29:45] Lord to enjoy because you see the Lord's
[1:29:47] expressing something he's expressing his
[1:29:50] word he's unfolding his word he's
[1:29:53] revealing himself and what he wants us
[1:29:56] he wants us to write songs about it to
[1:29:59] sing it back to him and rejoice in the
[1:30:00] moment with them it's romance doesn't it
[1:30:03] the right word for it I don't want to
[1:30:05] call it romance because that comes from
[1:30:06] Rome but whatever that is is it what
[1:30:11] really the word Rome it's cultural like
[1:30:13] a Roman type of thing I don't know
[1:30:15] intimate that's it thank you brother
[1:30:17] imple intimate it's an intimacy it's a
[1:30:20] communion and song amen
[1:30:24] I kind of touched on that before we sung
[1:30:26] that song it came because
[1:30:28] at such a powerful thought and I believe
[1:30:30] it's part of it and you know it's not
[1:30:32] just that always there's another natural
[1:30:34] a level of it it's at all that's a
[1:30:36] powerful tool for us to think because
[1:30:39] you know there's something about music
[1:30:41] that helps you remember the words you
[1:30:43] can actually as we know of the Sunday
[1:30:45] School in the songs you know you want to
[1:30:46] get the children to remember this long
[1:30:48] verse you just teach it in a song and
[1:30:49] they remember the whole song because
[1:30:52] it's something about it the Lord's made
[1:30:53] it in us to when there's a melody
[1:30:55] attached to in a rhythm it makes it
[1:30:57] easier to remember so if you're singing
[1:31:00] out the revival and the Lord's inspired
[1:31:01] you to write something about the revival
[1:31:04] that you're in and it's faith expressed
[1:31:07] because it's a lot expressed that you
[1:31:09] believe it and faith is expressed and
[1:31:11] you sing about it and then you're
[1:31:13] singing the church gets familiar with it
[1:31:14] and they can be just walking around I'm
[1:31:17] so glad that I can say I'm one of them
[1:31:19] you know and they're singing that and
[1:31:21] while they're singing that song that's
[1:31:22] about the revival that they're in and it
[1:31:25] just goes over and it's thinking about
[1:31:26] it gets ingrained into your thoughts a
[1:31:28] manic cook that dibal down hallelujah
[1:31:31] amen
[1:31:33] he didn't let the devil win Amen I like
[1:31:35] this song hello Louie these songs was
[1:31:37] powerful hallelujah
[1:31:39] need to sing out that expression that
[1:31:42] Thanksgiving to him for what he's doing
[1:31:45] now
[1:31:45] hallelujahs fresh fresh manna amen
[1:31:48] fresh libres it's like you're expressing
[1:31:51] back to the king and I believe that he
[1:31:53] enjoys that
[1:31:54] I believe the Lord enjoys music and he
[1:31:58] wants to hear music when we sing and we
[1:32:00] sit here we have song service we're not
[1:32:02] singing to entertain ourselves you know
[1:32:04] we can get caught up in there and our
[1:32:06] thoughts are this wasn't a very good
[1:32:07] song service well it might have been for
[1:32:09] the Lord not saying this one sorry it I
[1:32:12] don't mean it but you know I'm just
[1:32:14] saying in general like the song service
[1:32:17] man it was a real foot-in-mouth where is
[1:32:20] he is he gone he he walked out not this
[1:32:25] one but I'm saying in general you know
[1:32:27] like you we we get so caught up in
[1:32:30] passive entertainment that we get geared
[1:32:33] towards being entertained by something
[1:32:35] that you know we sit there and we listen
[1:32:37] to a song and maybe the singing wasn't
[1:32:39] so good and we think our men it wasn't
[1:32:41] that nice
[1:32:41] enjoy that but the Lord wasn't really
[1:32:43] listening to how good that voice was the
[1:32:45] Lord amen the Lord was responding to the
[1:32:52] faith that was being sung through the
[1:32:55] expression and that's what's pleasing
[1:32:57] him and so when we get that into our
[1:32:58] hearts and minds and when we come to
[1:33:00] church and we're singing this song we're
[1:33:02] singing them for him we're singing and
[1:33:05] worship we're responding to what he's
[1:33:06] doing we're responding to him you'll see
[1:33:09] what will happen in your life he comes
[1:33:12] down it says in and he inhabits the
[1:33:14] praises of Israel he inhabits the
[1:33:16] praises of his elected seat he inhabits
[1:33:18] the praises of his people who is he his
[1:33:21] perfect love what does perfect love do
[1:33:23] it'll remove unforgiveness and a remove
[1:33:25] fears here he will remove unforgiveness
[1:33:28] he will remove fears he will remove
[1:33:30] unsure ities he will give identity he
[1:33:33] will raise you up he will increase your
[1:33:35] faith he will unblock those subconscious
[1:33:37] complexes that have been handing you he
[1:33:39] will do it but you see there has to be a
[1:33:42] connection and that connection comes
[1:33:44] with a great human faith now I'm not
[1:33:47] saying if you feel like you've got
[1:33:48] little human faith because you know the
[1:33:50] devil will always like to tell us that
[1:33:51] Amen well I just tell him he's a liar
[1:33:55] he's an absolute lie he's defeated how
[1:33:58] can this guy who's on the ground under
[1:34:00] our feet he just slides up from there
[1:34:03] you know lies ascending from the ground
[1:34:05] sending up it's like get out you're a
[1:34:09] liar
[1:34:10] the Lord has given every man a measure
[1:34:13] of faith a full measure amen and he's
[1:34:18] here now to heal anything that would
[1:34:20] hinder that he's here now to unblock
[1:34:22] every channel Amen let's stand
[1:34:25] hallelujah musicians can we sing that
[1:34:28] song faith tunes the night into the day
[1:34:30] and then winds of faith amen hallelujah
[1:34:36] hallelujah we're going to pray before we
[1:34:39] sing and I just want you as me as we
[1:34:42] pray we close our eyes we all know these
[1:34:45] things in our life and and we're in this
[1:34:48] battle together but why not now why
[1:34:51] we're together as the words go forth
[1:34:54] and let's just pray together and if
[1:34:57] there's anything that you know that the
[1:35:00] Lord has touched on that's that's that's
[1:35:02] convicted you or the Lord's revealed
[1:35:04] something to you that needs to be let go
[1:35:06] or there's a fear in your life or
[1:35:08] there's suddenly a victim mentality or
[1:35:10] an attitude that you know is hurting you
[1:35:13] and and you can tell it's not balance
[1:35:15] you know like a certain situation would
[1:35:17] come about and all of a sudden you can
[1:35:19] almost not even stand because of the
[1:35:21] adrenaline and all of their all of those
[1:35:23] things may be diligent if you just lift
