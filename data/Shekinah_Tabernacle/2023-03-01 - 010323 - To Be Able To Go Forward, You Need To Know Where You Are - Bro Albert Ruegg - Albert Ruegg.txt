the Lord so God bless you it's real great to have you here it's great to have everyone else here tonight as well so this is Brother Albert comes let's just sing the um chorus of you know I feel the pull amen but I believe the Lord has a word for us tonight each and individual you know all of us an individual word that's going to speak I believe is going to speak to all of us by the time he says amen at the end of the service God's gonna speak to us all personally who believes that tonight amen so praise God Amen so let's sing this as um brother Albert comes I mean tonight I feel [Music] I am Christmas [Music] be through me I agree [Music] ment amen amen let's just pray first Heavenly Father we come tonight to meditate upon your word and Lord unless you quickener to us and reveal something it's just words but we talk about a word of God and we pray that you're an anointing will come and minister to us Lord you know our hearts and our needs and our position in life and I just pray that he would encourage us tonight you know commit us into your hands and and I pray that your Holy Spirit has full control in Jesus Christ's name amen amen just before we um read the word I just want to say it's lovely to be here and to see not just natural family spiritual family as well and it's always good the real family is the spiritual family but when the natural family followers the Lord is twice as wonderful amen I've got a few thoughts tonight and just read one scripture while we stand well-known scripture Genesis 3 9. and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where are thou and you may be seated where are thou where am I tonight right now in Christ in a body of Christ in in my life situation because you see there is a season for everything we we know Ecclesiastes says that uh to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven so we need to know where we at yeah we all are at a on a journey we know that or on the pilgrimage it sounds even better but not all of us are in the exact same place spiritually I always find um you know sometimes people like like you to see everything alike but it's like with children when they're part of the family that may not know everything you know but they're still part of the family so that's the unity of the spirit but we try to come to an understanding and an agreement in all things but what I'm saying there is a specific word of God for specific people you know there was a word in the Old Testament I I'll make some reference to it later you know the children of Israel there was a type there was a word for the nation through the prophet God spoke for the nation and the word that was spoken was for everyone for everyone yeah yeah but now we are in a love relationship with a Heavenly bridegroom so we have an individual word we are not part of their even though God makes us one but we are individually lead by the Holy Spirit so therefore it's important that we have a word from the Lord individually and so how do you know I I said this way I get a lot of times people ask me advice and what should I do brother I always and should I go there or should I do this I I just can't say I don't know where he is what he prayed for what the Lord has in mind for you I said keep on seeking the Lord until you have confirmation and the witness about it but you see it's it's like um we we say we have the compass uh the the map the road map the Bible and we have to Compass the Holy Spirit now I for those who have been in the bush and if you go hunting if if you don't have a GPS through all these things you have a map and you have a compass now remember one year I went in the bush and and I thought I thought I heard the deer you know gone off the track and I ran down the hill and you know and you know you start to hear things and see things and there was no there there but I didn't know where it was I just got off the track and uh what do you do I have to find my place back onto that track now how can you find your way back on the track first you have to know where you are it's impossible to know where to go unless you know where you are I knew I went South off the track so I knew I was somewhere down here so I knew if I go north north west I hit that track sooner or later I think I walked for about three hours fighting my way through the bush got it hurt and injured and slipped and and it was such thick bush but the compass kept on telling me this direction and I I couldn't understand I only rained down the hill for about 10 minutes and now after three hours walking and never give up you know I was two meters away from the Trek and the compass it through there that thick bush and the dead and stepped on the track but you know if somebody said which way should I go I would say where are you yeah yeah you have to know where you are before you can be late yeah and a lot of times people follow the leadership of somebody else but they're in a different position and uh to go forward we need to know where we are that's what I'm trying to say in Hebrews eight the second part of the verse there uh in the Amplified Bible it says for when Moses was about to erect the Tabernacle he was warned by God saying see that thou maketh all exactly according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain so he had to go back to that pattern that was shown to him at the mountains and not oh it would be a good idea to put another room there or make a little office on the side no it had to be according to the perfect way God showed it so human nature gets impatient we want an answer now when we have a problem we want an answer right now and sometimes the law gives you an answer and sometimes you wait and wait you know you came push thing up put out the fleece you know you know what you want you put out a fleece use this Lord is this your will is this you will and uh sometimes it isn't a perfect will of God it's our impatience and I've seen that in my own life for times you know you want to do something when I um was a young Christian I didn't know um I felt the Lord spoke to me that I should wait with getting married because I was living a worldly life until I was 27 and then the Lord taught me to wait five years and I thought wow where to now where to now I needed to know instantly open the Bible and got a verse that spoke to me and then I thought what was it maybe I should apply for the Bible school you know you sort of go down their track but the Lord has other plans for you you know it's not bad planes but it's it's our own doing or impatient impatience so um we run run to and fro sometimes and get disappointments until we actually know where we at Lord where am I at I need more of you before I can give more to others and if they're certainly that Lord am I really in the right place and quite often we have all these ideas but we don't even know where we are you know there's never been a time like now where this Bible says a lot of people don't know it you look at the signs of the last days you know people are so blinded they don't even know it love is a pleasure lovers of themselves and and all these things they don't even know what they it is maybe have an idea you know it's getting close to the coming of the Lord but they don't know where they are are at themselves and unless you we know where we are we're not going places we just go around circles so I'd like to encourage you to to know before the Lord exactly where you are so he can direct you where he wants you to be so do yourself invite upon the Lord you know last last year I was driving around the South Island and often when I drive I pray and uh something two things happened which were quite incredible I was driving them praying and I don't know why I said what I said I said sorry Lord for overtaking you I mean I was driving I wasn't overtaking the Lord what am I saying but then I realized yes I don't want to go ahead of the Lord I want to follow the lord and so I said I took that on board and then uh I carry on driving and then I started to sing to sing and it was just uh wonderful I said I just made up a song you know you how it goes when you when you do single prey and I said have you ever heard them say I love you have you ever heard him say you're mine have you ever ever heard him say I die for your sins have you ever heard him say and then it was quite a song and then I sort of made the next verse yes I heard him say and there I was confirming the word and then the presence of God came in the car yeah you know be in the right place and think the right things apply to you I think it's it's really wonderful so knowing where you are at will help us to see who he is you see Israel was a type or a pattern from which we can learn problem is sometimes people try to copy their pattern you can't copy the pattern the pattern is is like for us to learn it's not to do the same thing right the children of Israel knew that they were in slavery they knew it I mean it didn't need to be a scientist to find out during slavery when you beat them and work and how they get any food so they knew they were enslaved they knew that the only one and living God that the Living God could help them they knew that as well yeah so they prayed and cried until Moses came so that's what the fact was in Exodus 3 from verse 1 it says now Moses kept the flock of testro his father-in-law the priest of the median and he led the flock on the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb so Moses went about his natural business we we know he tried before to fulfill the plan of God you know to he heard about the great God and he heard about how he can deliver so he tried to do his own strength and we know it was a flop and he ended up in a desert and working uh there but he went about his business he didn't do anything special just many looking after the Sheep and then it says in the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed now the time had come God's time for Moses that was the time before it was all man's doing but that was the time and he had to learn not to do anything just to go about the business until God comes on the scene yeah you know we we especially when we're young we we can do a lot of things we can sort out things you know in in many ways in the in the natural way if somebody gives you trouble you can sort it out with you first you know if you're strong enough and you can sort it out in other ways if you're clever enough but that may not be the way to do it yeah wait upon the Lord so he it was his time and Moses said uh and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt you see he didn't expect the supernatural to come his way he thought he was a failure he failed God 40 years later Here Comes Scott on the scene you see when you're chosen by God from before the foundation of the world then it's not this year it has to happen tonight has to happen next year has to happen in God's time we're in his program and it's a time to come you know it's it's like the great Symphony we know about you know you know a great Symphony and I never forget when I went to school we had one man a boy he he uh played in the in a Orchestra I thought wow he plays in an orchestra he played the symbols I only had to strike the things once or twice during a symphony but at the right time at the right time he had to wait his turn read the music wait wait to do bang and he did his part you see you know your time comes but you know it's it's it's it's actually like that he didn't even play the flute or the trumpet just hit those things together at the right time that's important otherwise it makes a mess but Moses didn't expect the supernatural but when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the abortion said Moses Moses and he said who am I he said God calls you by name that's that wonderful thing if that burning fire calls you by name you know it's God dealing with you and it it's just absolutely amazing and he said draw not now Heather put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where I'm thou stainless is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob you know he identified himself and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said listen to this I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows but only now was the time right you see he heard their cry they probably thought why doesn't God answer it wasn't the time for it yeah right but now was the time for the Deliverance it says here you know only no I wrote it that only now was the time right for deliverance not when Moses by religious knowledge tried to do it but when God's time is right and when we are no longer trusting in our own strength and that comes to that you know so many times we get frustrated because we trust in our own strength yeah and then things don't go our way and uh can be very very hard but when the time is right with the Lord which is rest in it we just rest in it then it says and I am come down to deliver them out of the land of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the High bytes and the gpsides you see God not only promised to take them out of Egypt but he also promised to bring them into a land that flies with milk and honey you know sometimes we just get out of a place but we fail to enter in you know we can get out of a life of sin we can stop smoking we can stop drinking we can stop all sorts of things and try not to swear so much and all this kind of things we come out of it but we have to enter in into that rest that's that's what what really counts and the promise is to come out and enter in that's that's the promise now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression with the Egyptians oppressed them to the Lord is aware of all these things come now therefore now we sent the unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people and the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt You Shall Serve God upon this mountain man what what a statement it takes you know it's like a proactive promise that can only be applied to a believer you know he wasn't sure in himself Moses says he said how can I do that and God says certainly I will be with thee yeah what else do we need amen God's presence with us and this shall be a token unto thee a sign that I have spoken to you but that was in the future and I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt after you've brought him out You Shall Serve me on this mountain you see it's not I'll show you give you a sign now or or or another sign now once you actually followed my advice followed the word I will then confirm it so it is not a matter of hearing it and wanting confirmation no it's a matter of following the word and then God comes down and proves of it you see that I find that's quite an interesting verse how can somebody seeking a sign and how can you say God says to you um do a certain things go down downtown and handle the Bible to somebody and you say oh you're not sure is that the Lord and he said well you will know it's me after this person said such and such to you once you've done it yeah you know it goes that way you see the journey and its goal you know it was Deliverance from slavery Experiencing God on the journey test or faith and entering into the rest you know there's various parts of the journey and the instructions were different at every part of the journey that's why we can't just generally say do this or do that it depends where yet if you've never repented repent yeah yeah if you've never been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ if you never hit the Holy Spirit experience raise your hands until you've filled with the spirit you see we cannot say just a general statement I I know it's different people have different ways of getting that experience and I just tell you my experience was very different uh or leading on to my experience was very different to my wife's experience I lived I believed in God since it was four years old even prayed and so God's helping me and doing things uh went in the Catholic church in stone Idols you know because I knew it was wrong to have Idol said you know I was sincere and then of course I didn't really know God in the power of the Holy Ghost even though I had experiences and then when I was 13 or 12 I wrote the little prayer on the wall in my bedroom and prayed every night the Lord's Prayer nobody else in in the family did that so it was believing in God but then well mixed uh when you sort of grow up 15 16 few complexes and things and you try to compete with the world and be part of it and and it takes you further and further away from the Lord I still pray the Lord's Prayer every night and sometimes drunk sometimes I fell asleep halfway through and you know it drags him more and more into the ways of the world but then the time came when God called me out and he delivered me from from that way of life and he revealed himself to me and taught me who I was in him and then everything changed amen amen I wasn't and then I was in a church you couldn't raise your hands very conservative structure I ended up I had to go and then secrets and raise my hands and pray to the Lord our church oh gifts you know be careful you know I was at home so happy one night raising my hands praying and praying couldn't sleep after about 15 20 minutes suddenly I spoke in thanks I mean if the church would have known they would have said okay so that's of the devil or whatever yeah you know the holy spirit is not bound God's spirit is not bound so that was my experience I had a holy ghost experience actually I had the experience when I was in the car at that time I wasn't baptized or anything but when I heard more truth of course someone would walk in the load off to work so you step into it my wife was brought up in a message search how's that she never did wrong she never was in the world she never did all the things I did and it was lovely in the church environment now you feel pretty good when you go to church because you're amongst brothers and sisters or Believers and you feel quite good when you're out there on your own it's quite a different story yeah so that security of the church was suddenly gone when she married me you know when you get married you have other things to to contend with and you you live that secure home the secure church family or you go somewhere else and that took her overseas straight away and you know it brought out something could see where are you bornman are you in Christ oh yeah are you there or she she realized she never had a holy ghost experience she was on her knees when I uh that's about four months later crying out to the Lord Lord please save me after living A really lovely life for 18 years and then the Holy Ghost came down he is so excited and besides herself it was wonderful but you see she was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ she had all these things but she didn't know where she was at you're fine they used to call her an angel in church some people said she was an angel she was so lovely I don't know how many pets she got on the shoulder I never got those but she did but you see it gives you a false security you don't need approval of man you need the proof of God and if you know where you at then when you come into a situation where you're on your own and the fear comes on you you know you're not in the right place perfect love castes out all fear so there's no fear for a Believer we should not have fear whether the Earth shakes or whether this happens we should not fear in Christ we have security we have peace we have a peace that pass all understanding so when there is fear when there is all these things where are you at yeah where are you at now what did they do the children of Israel they did fear when they came to the The Raid sea and the Egyptian Army was about to get them back their feared for their lives absolutely feared for their lives I don't think Moses feared the law promised him to be with him and they had to while they looked to Moses you know and we know the story he made a way through the trouble he didn't lift him up and and teleported him across he made a way through and sometimes you know there's a way through things they complained there were even sick of manna you know can you believe it they even complained about that they argued who should do what and Moses shouldn't do everything they doubted and the worst thing was they forgot the promise of the Lord the whole word they forgot the entering impact you see that is that that is a terrible thing and these things Bible says are written and happen for an example for us so we would not follow the way of unbelief amen Hallelujah so what I'm saying believe the whole Council of God and live by every word and you know never ever has there been a time like now you see Jesus says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now the devil uses everything in the book in his book to attack the Christians so we need every word to combat that every word there's a word for everything I tell you that much that believe the whole word know where you are in your journey I think that is one of the most important things to know where we are at in our journey yeah you know something sometimes it's it's a it's a a little thing that we trust too much in our own program our own plans and the Lord has something else and we lose the peace what does it mean we're not necessarily not born again now suddenly no it's we can make mistakes we all constantly need to trust him do not lose sight of the promise that's the important one so you're entering to the wrist and we know the rest is the true Sabbath the Holy Ghost that's what it represents to enter into that rest and you know sometimes people follow Old Testament scriptures to the letter and have to keep the Sabbath okay if you don't worship on a Saturday oh that's the mark of the beast and you hear all that kind of stuff but have they entered into the rest have they entered into the true spiritual words into Christ I have Sabbath every day honestly every day Wednesday night as well so it's entering into that rest into the Holy Ghost into the true rest when you have entered then all fear complaints doubts and arguments are gone you will have peace the re the peace that passes all understanding I like that not all troubles and storms around you will be gone of course not but your faith will be anchored in God's word you'll overcome these things you know that makes me think it's oh sweet and we enter into the promised land now I've got the Holy Ghost now we have to fight in there we have to make sure we fight the good fight of faith and believe the word and let let not the enemy trying to rob you of of these things you know it's that is that there is so much of it says he can't just came to steal and drop and and destroy we are in that promised land and we have the victory given it's our land so we have to stand on the word of God and claim what's ours all the time all the time and we can read through the examples there uh how how they overcame the enemy you know in Supernatural ways how did the walls of Jericho fall supernaturally amen they didn't have to do anything they had to just play their trumpets at the right time and God did the rest you see it's it's incredible what happens when God's with you and we have the Lord the Holy Spirit within us and he says I will never leave you and I'll forsake you so when things go difficult can always reach out to the Lord and he is right there right there to give you the victory now I'll just uh have one or two more scriptures here acts 27 verse 18 to 20. talks about um the Apostle Paul when he was on the journey he says and we being exceedingly tossed with the Tempest the next day they lightened the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship and when now the sun no stars in many days appeared and no small Tempest lie on us all hope that we should be saved was taken away I don't know if you've ever been in a storm on a boat but this must have been terrible yeah must have been everybody thought they're dying yeah except Paul yeah why oh because he was such a good Christian no because he believed the word of God Amen and you know what the word of God told him before he boarded the ship the word of God also told him that going to be a disaster you better not you know they shouldn't sail but they did but in in Acts 23 11. it says and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheerful for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou be witness also at Rome and he was on the journey to Rome how can you fear if you have the word of God how can he doubt even if the storm is Raging the way it did yeah that shouldn't doubt because after the word the word said you're going to be a witnessing wrong that's why it's so important that we hear from God we need to hear from God no no not from me you know there's many scriptures where where even men of God you know that they struggled with things even Paul when he had this Thorn In the Flesh he struggled he struggled and and uh he it says in the Bible he sought the Lord Thrice three times crying out to God you know Lord deliver me from this deliver me from this and he struggled with it until when until you hear from God yeah and what God Said didn't really matter it mattered that you heard it from God and he said my grace is sufficient unto you and then he said now I rejoice in persecutions I'm exceeding glad when things go go south for me you know he was because he heard it from God you can't say somebody who is in misery oh come on look at Paul you know you should not be like this and you should no you have to hear from God this is I don't want to hear from men I want to hear it from God When God says you're healed then you're healed when God speaks then you you you're actually uh you know it in your heart because we have something to respond to the word of God Amen we have a receiver yeah I don't know if she's there but about five years ago I was in a terrible mess I injured my back in a really bad way I was in such pain I don't know if you ever had back pain but it was terrible and it was over Christmas I felt myself with painkillers and that didn't work and I prayed and I cried out to God and said Lord what's wrong with my faith and you know like put all pray across on me and and every tried everything you know when you're in such pain you try everything even as a rock from Brother Brown's grave and I put that on me and didn't make any difference you know I tell you what I was in such a terrible State on the 27th of December doctors closed but there was a physio open so I went there and you know physios are not doctors and they don't x-ray or we examine you they just do whatever they think is right they squeeze so hard and so much on me I just didn't know where I was still alive or not at the end but what happened at the end did damage the nerve and that was paralyzed in my foot and I was what I couldn't lift my foot anymore I was there at the at the physio on a motorbike I went home I would try to get off I just fell over because my foot didn't work anymore so I had a drop foot I dragged my foot behind and when I told them they were in absolute shock and they organized a specialist at the Grace Hospital straight away straight away so I had to see that specialist and I prayed specifically I said Lord I don't understand it why I'm not healed but if you want me to go through the doctor then please speak through the doctor so I was listening for God to speak through the doctor so I went there he sent me through this MRI scan or whatever you call these things and had a meeting with the doctor he showed me the scan he said Mr Rook I've never seen it back that bad before all these things came out between the discs and whatever was he said I've never seen anything that bad before and as I said oh what can you do he said oh there's a you can do an operation and they said what about my paralyzed 40s there's a small chance if you do something straight away a small chance that it can come right after three months it's definitely permanent I said okay I have this operation and I was still not convinced but I did have all the the preliminaries and all these things and meetings with the doctors and anyth assists and all that they have off the um operation I went there of course you have to fasten all these things and then you put on this strange nighty and all that kind of stuff and and then they wheeled me in and then the anesthesis comes pulls down his mask and telling me that I might have a sore throat after the operation you know or the hose to put down his throat and then the doctor comes pushed down his mask pets me on the shoulder and say how are you feeling you know just trying to encourage me at the operating theater and I said I feel quite good and then he said have you got feelings touch my knee have you got feelings there I said yeah and he said can you walk he said to get off the bed and walk in this nightly up and down dragging my foot behind you know a and then it came I sat on a bed the doctor looked at me an exorcist was waiting doctor looked at me looked at me hasn't said a word then there was a strange atmosphere in the room wow then he turned his head sideways and he spoke and thou believed it was God spoken he said if I were you I would cancel this operation wow at the operating theater everything's planned done I said I'll cancel and I walked out dragging my foot behind like before got changed again and the nurse said oh what have you been doing you know they were in shook seeing me coming out there I said I've been praying and then I rang bronman she burst into tears you know she didn't need to look after me for the next three months to prop me up again you know she was in tears she picked me up I was absolutely sure I heard from God and I was rejoicing I was still crippled but I was rejoicing three days later I wake up completely healed completely healed and a week after that I played a tennis tournament and you know these people from the tennis club sent me this get well card and everybody signed and they had nearly fell over when they saw me there amen and a year later Whispering I said it was fine I'm great you know but you see I had to hear from God I didn't have to hear it even from the doctor I had to be God speaking to me otherwise it would not have triggered off something in a heart and if man means well with you and speaks to you lovely words to even retire the Bible unless God speaks through that man it will not do the same thing but when God speaks it will a witness to a man just recently and uh never met him before and then started to speak about certain things and he was exactly in that situation wow wow oh he was blown away he said I'm just going through that right now you know a week later he was in church he knew there was something and ever since he's been in contact and when they have he is just uh wants to get married or meet a girlfriend after all these years and he rang me and said can I bring my girlfriend and talk to you and get some advice you know that they knew there was something from the Lord in there and then you have confidence in that but you shouldn't have confidence in me if I haven't got to work from the Lord and you know it's just a bit of natural advice but if it's off the Lord then something will happen amen that's why it's so good to wait upon the Lord till you hear from God give you another one I was driving down Kevin Road a while ago with quite the modern car and there was this fellow sort of looked like homeless on the roadside was a bicycle wheel in the hand scruffy as can be and try to get a ride downtown somebody stole his wheel on the bike and whatever so I stopped he got it somehow into the car and he felt I don't know how he felt but I was driving along and then he said to me do you know what I've just been thinking he said it could have been the other way around could have been you standing on a roadside and I drive a flash car and I said that's right that's right we are what we are by the grace of God we're not because we we've done something special by the grace of God we have our place you know there's so many things which happened uh I I can talk to you for hours and hours about things but you know we need to hear from God we don't need we can learn things we can listen to anointed sermons which happen 50 years ago but when you need healing your name has to be called out and God has to speak to you and so many times people try to copy something or or do something and actually brings more more reproach to the word of God unto the Lord than anything else if God speaks for you then something will happen and if it's not God speaking this reason just share a few things but you may must hear from God like I said Paul was so blown away when he heard from God that he said I'm rejoicing in my infirmities a glory and persecution you think he's is he gone not now he heard from God and you know when we hear from God it's not collectively is individually if I say here I mean I can get people enthusa we are all the bride you know we're waiting for a coming of the Lord and we soon meet him in the air and we all listen we all that and hallelujah praise the Lord you know we all heard the message and well you know maybe we're not all in the same place yes I've met people they've been for 30 years or whatever in church and then suddenly had a holy ghost experience you know we need to know where we're at oh yes come on I want to know where I'm at I want to be always ready yeah you know it's not something we need to uh what do you call it fear if we if we're chosen by God and elected by God and he he he called us and we we predestinated I mean it gives you a rest and a peace but still that we are in this flesh and we need to be uh absolutely certain Where We Are I'll give you a test one more example and I heard that a while ago I've met a couple pastors overseas and next thing I mean when I always say when when people are young they had a lot of enthusiasm when they get a bit older they're looking for acceptance and when you when you get a bit older and wiser you think it's all a waste of time you know it's only God's hands anyway but you know they had a lot of competition and infighting and church splitting and everything anyway this man I visited him and had a lovely time and then I visited him again A year later and he was dying of cancer man there was no more same fellowship and there was oh nervousness and all that I just recently somebody told me he was fearful he didn't want to die and he was scared to die a pasta and then his wife was left behind and she started to I don't know what she did exactly but you know you're a widow you want to look your best to go to the gym and do all these different things and then a disease struck her she was dying and on this bed she said look I've wasted my time I've wasted so much time here is a couple preaching the message for a lifetime and come to the death beard and one is scared and the other one confesses I wasted my time we need to know where we are at before that happens oh I wanna you know I want to know where I'm at Lord if I'm not in the right place push me right there now not right now I want to be in that place where I can have absolute confidence absolute confidence God hears me God leads me there's no need of fear no need of problems if problems come well all things work together for good to them they love God and of course according his purpose doesn't mean no problems come but he cope with them you cope with them and you know you go outside of his there's a rainstorm you don't go in the corner and cry lord it's raining now you put on the rain coat go out there you know you adjust you overcome these things and I just wanted to encourage you to know be certain of your position and if your position is in Christ do you have ever the more reason to Rejoice you should never be miserable never right and if you feel down because you're looking down to look up yeah no I just want to finish with this here you see oh Paul head was the word of God to go by and that was enough there was no fear on that boat he said you'll be a witness in Rome so I believe it so that's not unto this this storm no matter how it was writing and when you were in a storm and you feel forsaken by everybody no it is it I will never leave you nor forsake you so it's absolutely wonderful so all we have to do is go by the word of God be honest with yourself where are you on your journey don't just claim to be the bride make yourself ready yeah yeah yeah yeah you know yeah absolutely absolutely I had a oh I I like to share that but I don't want to mention names but I somebody from Wellington I met him and uh he claims to be an atheist you know probably had his disappointments and all these things but last week I had a dream uh you know that sign of getting old old Mandarin dreams you know but what happened in a dream I was talking to him there and uh he said boy his wife died and being an atheist I haven't even got a father you know when you're an atheist you haven't got here Heavenly Father yeah you know in that sense and there was a huge big sliding gate coming down and he said the gates closed for me and then I threw a rock in as it came down it left a little Gap open I thought yeah never give up on people never give up on people there's this little Gap and it really struck me you know even he himself in a dream okay I don't want to say this the way it is but in a dream he had no hope no future no nothing and he saw the gate coming down closing there's no more gate is closed and that's Put a Little Rock in the left to get open and yeah you know we can do that ourselves we put that rock in there people you know you put their Rock in by prayer you put that rock in by by compassion you put that rock in there by your prayers and and faith in the Lord and I think while we're down here while there's breath there is hope you know I mean we all have children or or loved ones which not serving the lord the way they should or we have uh loved ones there religiously confused so we have all sorts but let's never give up let's never give up so I just want to finish with this um two three thoughts if you are still in Egypt enslaved drugs now calling morality hatred unbelief then press on look to God's word and receive it that's really what it is if you have heard the voice of God and you came out of Egypt and started the journey pray a song through water baptism Walking with God yes if you're at the border and you see the Giants wow if I go in there press on be a Joshua yeah just the other last week too I talked to a a man he was 29 years old rough ass and I talked to him about the things of the Lord I could see as all these tattoos but the odd one had a cross centered you know so he he swore like anything but he never misused the name of the Lord so I thought there might be something there it's just the way you talk and then I talked to him about things and then he taught me he saw like a mountain ridge and he's there I don't know how I can go to the other side and I had that same vision before I came to the Lord wow I was sitting in a church I saw myself there but I knew if I go on the other side there's no return but I said look with me I knew the love of God drew me in that's that's what it was you know I didn't want to redo it and but isn't it interesting how God can show people exactly and I knew exactly what to answer and what what what to tell them amen you see there's still hope out there for people if you are at the border and see the Giants just remember children of Israel saw the Giants and look where they all ended up fear despair misery and cast you know all died in the wilderness if you have entered into the promised land now if you have entered receive the Holy Ghost the true rest then claim your promises and fight for every inch claim your promises yes claim your promises are finished with one little story and one scripture story wise about claiming the promises I um when I was a young Christian I met this old lady and she was a Christian but she was not very confident you know you know quickly intimidated uh she had a terrible life she was married for Monday the next the husband said Lee said well I had enough and left out of nowhere unexpected she was left alone an old woman she was about 80. and I try to encourage her to have to stand on the word of God claim the promises not be timid how do you explain it to an old lady so I thought well what Lord what should I say yeah don't even think much but I made an example she lived in quite a good neighborhood and they said look Give an example if you're a neighbor will build a garage and put it across your land and deprive you of your little vegetable garden I know for your view there and do you go over there and say hey that that's that the boundary pig is still that's my lane and Hill shout and blast you you get all intimidated and go back home sit in your little house sit in your little house deprived of your little Garden on your view feeling sorry for yourself go to the council go to the lawyer get the title deed yeah get the word and go to him it is written get off my land you know this old lady she was really touched oh you know what happened the neighbor actually built the garage across her land not the entire garage but the corner of quite a big piece of it how would I know that but she heard from God that night I believe so when you hear that you can take it on board you know you can take it on board and know that the last scripture here is Joshua 13 1 we all know it now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him Thou Art old and stricken in years and they remindeth yet much land to be possessed and they were in the promised land you can say they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and still didn't walk in the full power of God as we should and I think tonight we should should say hello have I retreated to my comfortable home and and and uh where am I at am I the border am I in a land am I still struggling on the journey yeah you know we have look we have met if we have got the Holy Ghost we have met the Heavenly broken yeah I've been to Convention once where the preacher was talking about Rebecca child riding on the camel in the desert and the few heart bumps and this and that and oh praise God everybody was totally oh elighteth you know but then I thought no I have made my Isaac I've been in the tent you know I have met my heavenly bridegroom I have had that uh experience I'm not riding in a desert I have arrived and I think we should say look I have arrived I have privileges I'm one with Christ and we are ears and joint is with Christ Kings and Priests and I think when we arrived we have to make sure hey yeah that's my situation I have arrived so we don't need to hold back we need to know where we're at whether it is still further to go or whether we have arrived then if we know I have arrived then we know we have all these Privileges and everything to climb amen should we pray heavenly father I just ask in the name of Jesus Christ that you would just Quicken and reveal to us where we are at I know there is more for us to have and Lord we need to know where we are at so we can walk in the right direction claim the right promises and and go forward and bring glory to your name I just ask that you would in the coming days even Minister To Us by your Holy Spirit and direct and guide us into all truth into the place you have us to be Lord that we can truly truly walk in the power of God and knowing that you are with us and that we are walking that light as you are in the light and father I just ask that you have have your way with each one of us and thank you for this time of meditation and uh just pray your blessings up on each one of us in Jesus Christ's name amen
