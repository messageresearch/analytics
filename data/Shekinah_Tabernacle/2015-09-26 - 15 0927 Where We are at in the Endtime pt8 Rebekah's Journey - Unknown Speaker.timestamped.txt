[42:02] from Hebrews
[42:04] 12 and
[42:07] so uh so we'll just start reading from
[42:09] from Genesis 24 and verse 61 and we'll
[42:12] just go down to verse 65 and it and it
[42:14] and it speaks this and says and Rebecca
[42:18] arose and her damsels and they rode upon
[42:20] camels they followed the man the servant
[42:22] took Rebecca and went his way and Isaac
[42:25] came from the way of the well of laari
[42:28] for he dwelt in the South Country and
[42:31] Isaac went out to meditate in the field
[42:33] at the even tide and he lifted up his
[42:35] eyes and saw and behold the camels were
[42:38] coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes
[42:40] and when she saw Isaac she lighted off
[42:43] the camel for she had said unto the
[42:45] servant what man is this that walketh in
[42:48] the field to meet us and the servant had
[42:50] said it is my master therefore she took
[42:53] a veil and covered herself amen amen
[42:56] there let go to Hebrews chapter 12 and I
[42:58] just want to uh
[43:01] read uh verses 18 down to verse 24 of
[43:04] Hebrews chapter
[43:06] 12 and we're going to spend a bit more
[43:08] time in the uh Hebrews the 12th chapter
[43:10] so if you want to keep it handy uh uh
[43:13] later on we'll come back to it but so
[43:15] this is Paul speaking of now where where
[43:17] where we have come because he's speaking
[43:20] to a people a Hebrew people have come
[43:22] out of Judaism but he's pointing them on
[43:24] now you must go on you know you've
[43:26] you've you know you've received Christ
[43:28] in a way but you must go on into
[43:29] Perfection let us go unto the perfect
[43:31] man and you know he's calling them to to
[43:34] to go beyond where they are and he says
[43:36] now in verse 18 He says for ye are not
[43:39] come into the mount that might be
[43:41] touched that burnt with fire nor unto
[43:43] Blackness and Tempest I mean unto
[43:46] Blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[43:48] the sound of a trumpet and the sound of
[43:50] Words which voice they that heard and
[43:53] treated that the word should not be
[43:55] spoken to them anymore for they could
[43:57] not endure that which was commanded and
[44:00] if as such a beast touch the mountain it
[44:02] shall be stoned or th thrust through
[44:04] with a d and so terrible was the sight
[44:07] that Moses said I exceedingly fear and
[44:09] Quake but ye are come unto a mountains
[44:12] uh but yet come unto Mount Zion and unto
[44:15] the city of the Living God the heavenly
[44:17] Jerusalem and to an innumerable company
[44:20] of angels to the general assembly uh and
[44:23] Church of the firstborn which are
[44:25] written in heaven and to God the judge
[44:27] of all and to the spirits of just men
[44:30] made perfect and to Jesus the mediator
[44:33] of the New Covenant and to the blood of
[44:35] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[44:38] than that of Abel amen may the Lord
[44:40] bless his word you may you may have your
[44:45] seats so if I'd like to title this I I'd
[44:48] like to uh I want to speak about
[44:50] Rebecca's
[44:51] journey and you know just to uh some of
[44:54] these things I've already covered but
[44:56] you know just as one of my my chemistry
[44:57] lecturers told me at University he said
[45:00] in a you know in a lecture you know if
[45:01] he repeats himself there's a reason and
[45:04] it's to emphasize some things so some of
[45:06] this will be a bit of of a review but
[45:09] you know we understand that Rebecca you
[45:11] know from her journey from where she was
[45:13] in in modern day Iraq and to up to where
[45:16] where Isaac was was a long distance it
[45:18] was an incredible journey that she took
[45:21] and we understand from from Genesis 24
[45:23] that Genesis 24 is a prophecy and that
[45:26] prophecy is being lived out today where
[45:28] God has sent an Alazar you know into the
[45:30] Earth and he has you know sent a sent a
[45:33] messenger into the Earth your God
[45:35] governing the whole thing to find a
[45:37] bride for Isaac to find a bride for
[45:39] Jesus Christ so we can see already that
[45:43] the alaza has come he's not here anymore
[45:45] he wasn't you know as soon as he
[45:47] introduced you know Rebecca to Isaac he
[45:50] he he went off the scene cuz he wasn't
[45:52] important his message was the important
[45:54] thing and so now we can see that
[45:57] Rebecca and Isaac we have become one
[45:59] with Christ but I want to just go into
[46:02] this a little bit because Rebecca you
[46:03] know we understand that the Book of
[46:05] Genesis now I'm not I'm not trying to
[46:07] inject anything into it but we
[46:09] understand that her journey her journey
[46:11] from from her her father's house into
[46:14] Isaac you know Sarah's tent you know
[46:17] that whole journey encompasses the
[46:18] Christian walk and the Book of Genesis
[46:21] it's called Genesis because it's the
[46:22] genus the seed chapter so it's
[46:24] everything's condensed but it you know
[46:26] grows out as as things go along so you
[46:29] know we we understand that the very
[46:33] camels that Rebecca watered now are the
[46:35] same camels that took her to her Isaac
[46:38] and I just want to read this it just
[46:39] blessed me and I'm just going to read
[46:41] the whole thing this is from earnestly
[46:42] contending for the faith listen 53 he
[46:46] says a little woman down in New Albany
[46:48] had been crippled 17 years draw up I
[46:51] never knew her in my life the Holy
[46:53] Spirit told me where she was at she was
[46:56] an Armenian
[46:57] her name was Mrs ohania Mrs Daryl ohania
[47:01] she was crippled up and I walked in
[47:03] there I seen her she looked like a
[47:05] spider drawn up in a bed her younger uh
[47:08] her young daughter 17 years old Dorothy
[47:11] they lived up there at 1900 Oak Street
[47:14] in New Albany this has been years ago
[47:17] and there I went by I said now that's
[47:20] the house he showed me I went down to
[47:21] the house the girl came to the door and
[47:23] I said how do you do she said how do you
[47:25] do I said she looked at me real funny Mr
[47:29] Merl you that read it in my book uh had
[47:31] been healed up there at uh St Edward's
[47:34] hospital and it had come out in the
[47:36] paper said are you that man that went
[47:38] down and healed that man I said no ma'am
[47:41] I said isn't there a lady here that's
[47:43] crippled up said my mother said step in
[47:47] and she was kind of like backwards she
[47:48] was a young lady about 17 I guess she
[47:51] had on her brother's shoe she kindly
[47:52] stepped back to one side and there laid
[47:55] this old woman said that that's her
[47:57] that's the one I said sister what are
[47:59] you reading she said it's an Armenian
[48:00] Bible I said Do you believe she said
[48:03] ever since I seen the paper about that
[48:05] man being healed I said there's hopes
[48:07] for me I said God has heard your prayer
[48:10] he sent me that I might pray for you and
[48:12] the woman jumped out of the bed running
[48:14] around over the house perfectly normal
[48:16] and well right to her or go see her many
[48:19] of the people in the neighborhood heard
[48:21] the screaming and they thought there was
[48:23] a funeral service it was an old person
[48:25] died and was born again again all right
[48:28] when she came out of there they said
[48:30] she's excited that's all she she just
[48:32] got excited and let the muscles down in
[48:35] her legs about 5 years later I was
[48:37] standing in the butcher shop I seen her
[48:40] through the glass come in she walked in
[48:43] with her husband she touched me on that
[48:44] arm I acted like I didn't see her I
[48:47] looked over this way she touched me back
[48:50] here and I looked uh this other way she
[48:52] said I fooled you didn't I I said no she
[48:54] said brother Brandon you remember a long
[48:56] time ago they told me I was excited I
[48:59] said yes ma'am she said I'm still
[49:01] excited because I'm still walking amen
[49:04] then you'd better get excited brother
[49:06] excitement don't heal the sick the power
[49:08] of God is what heals the sick he says
[49:10] it's the evening time uh evening lights
[49:13] are falling remember it was Isaac that
[49:15] wanted a wife when the Father Abraham
[49:17] sent the servant out a very beautiful
[49:19] type of God the Father sending out for
[49:21] his bride to get his bride a servant the
[49:24] Holy Spirit alasar and it was in the
[49:26] cool of the evening when the beautiful
[49:28] Rebecca came out to water the camel you
[49:30] know the story and the Beautiful Rebecca
[49:32] come out and he said who now who uh ever
[49:36] who Waters this camel he said Lord let
[49:39] that be the one you've chosen and
[49:41] Rebecca went and watered the camel and
[49:43] give them a drink and then watered uh
[49:45] his animal look the very animal that she
[49:47] was watering the animal represents a
[49:50] beast amen of course a beast of burden
[49:52] which means a power in the Bible and the
[49:55] Very animal that shs water was the very
[49:57] animal that packed her to see her her
[49:59] bridegroom is that right and what is
[50:02] watering the very power that we're
[50:04] watering now with praises and with
[50:06] Thanksgiving and glory and power and
[50:08] might is the very holy spirit that will
[50:10] pack us up to see Jesus someday look it
[50:12] was in the call of the evening when
[50:14] Isaac walked out some people say what if
[50:16] you see him and he's a real dark Jew if
[50:19] he's this I don't care what he looks
[50:21] like he's my savior and when the bride
[50:23] sees him it'll be love at first sight
[50:25] when Rebecca Isaac she jumped off the
[50:28] camel run to meet him it was love at
[50:29] first sight I tell you when we see him
[50:32] it'll be love at first sight off we'll
[50:34] go and a well will go into his arms
[50:36] certainly how beautiful the bride the
[50:38] evening lights coming the faith that was
[50:39] once delivered to the Saints beginning
[50:41] to restore back to the church the Fig
[50:43] Tree is putting forth its buds she begin
[50:45] to move out the evening light the very
[50:47] same gospel that was preached on the day
[50:49] of Pentecost the very signs that
[50:51] followed for 30 odd years after that
[50:53] down in the church has returned back to
[50:55] the church again falling right down to
[50:58] the End Amen so we can see you know I
[51:01] just I wanted to read that first part
[51:02] because it just blessed me she says I'm
[51:04] I'm still excited cuz I'm still walking
[51:07] amen amen I'm still walking with the
[51:08] Lord so I'm still excited Hallelujah so
[51:11] we see here that you know this this
[51:14] power that we worship you know our lord
[51:16] Jesus the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ in
[51:18] another form to the same one that we
[51:20] worship and we love that we're watering
[51:22] it's going to pack us to see him in the
[51:24] air amen so now
[51:27] she made that great decision she said I
[51:29] will go amen and now you may read
[51:31] Genesis 24 and you say well if you're
[51:33] placing us on the journey does that mean
[51:35] we haven't become one with him yet I say
[51:37] no we have become one with him because
[51:39] the marriage supper is up there but the
[51:41] union takes place here and so there's a
[51:45] people now you know there's a people
[51:47] upon the Earth that received the alasa
[51:50] call they have met they have received
[51:51] the alaza call and that is and they are
[51:54] on their way to meet their in the air
[51:58] now we have become one with him now and
[52:00] I want to just clarify this because when
[52:03] someone hears the anointed word for
[52:05] their day and they receive it in faith
[52:07] it throws them into an invisible Union
[52:09] with Christ amen and we can see this
[52:12] perfectly well if you read Acts chapter
[52:14] 10 we have Peter there and Cornelius is
[52:16] a gentile and he would give to the Lord
[52:19] and he you know worshiped the god of the
[52:20] Old Testament and an angel came to him
[52:23] and said your arms have come up before
[52:24] God send men to joper go get Peter and
[52:27] he'll tell you what to do and and God
[52:29] was working on Peter's end as well and
[52:31] then finally the two came together where
[52:33] where Cornelius began to testify to his
[52:35] household and to the others that
[52:37] gathered said I had a vision of an
[52:39] Angel and and and he told now I'm going
[52:42] to go get this man Peter he's going to
[52:43] come preach to us the words of life and
[52:46] and then finally when when Peter came
[52:48] and and God was working on both ends and
[52:50] then all the people were stirred by one
[52:52] man having a vision and now they stirred
[52:55] because this Vision was be material
[52:57] where the man that was pointed out in
[52:59] the vision was standing in their very
[53:00] midst and then so Peter be to preach to
[53:03] them Jesus Christ and said while yet
[53:06] Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost
[53:07] fell upon them and they marveled saying
[53:10] shall we you know these ones you know
[53:12] can we forbid water sing they have
[53:14] received the Holy Ghost like we did on
[53:16] the day of Pentecost and on the day of
[53:18] Pentecost Christ and his church became
[53:21] one amen and those Gentiles because they
[53:24] heard the word amen they heard the word
[53:27] from an anointed servant of God and that
[53:29] caused them to receive the Holy Ghost it
[53:31] caused them to come into an invisible
[53:33] Union with their bridegroom so now when
[53:36] alaza was speaking now to Rebecca and
[53:39] her receiving the message from out of
[53:42] his mouth and Faith had actually caused
[53:44] her to be come into invisible Union with
[53:47] Isaac yes amen amen because Faith cometh
[53:49] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[53:51] now and so Faith Rose in their hearts
[53:54] and they received what Peter was saying
[53:56] and they sealed into the Kingdom so they
[53:58] became United with Christ right there
[54:01] and it is the same thing now when we
[54:03] receive the word when we really receive
[54:05] it not in here but in here amen and we
[54:08] can look back and see my life is
[54:09] different now sure we have battles and
[54:12] struggles but something on the inside is
[54:13] pushing out and something on the inside
[54:15] is taking over amen we''re being thrown
[54:17] into a invisible Union with our
[54:20] bridegroom Hallelujah because a gentile
[54:23] faith is different to a Jewish faith
[54:25] because the Jews always said to Jesus
[54:27] just come and lay hands on them or you
[54:30] know comeing and like you know D and his
[54:32] daughter he said come and lay hands on
[54:34] her and she'll she'll come back alive
[54:36] but the Gentile faith is not that way
[54:38] amen and we see this in in Matthew
[54:40] chapter 8 where a centurion would come
[54:43] before would would would would come
[54:45] before the very Lord Of Glory and he
[54:47] would inrig to him because he had a
[54:48] servant that was sick and he came to him
[54:51] and said Lord come you know he says now
[54:55] he says in saying Lord Lord my servant
[54:57] lieth at the home sick of ay grievously
[55:00] tormented and Jesus sayith to him I will
[55:02] come and heal him so he was going to go
[55:04] lay his hands upon him you know and pray
[55:07] the Centurion answered said Lord I'm not
[55:09] worthy that thou should come should come
[55:12] under my roof but speak the word only
[55:14] and my servant shall be healed so this
[55:18] Centurion had a revelation that Jesus
[55:20] speaking the word sending his word was
[55:23] exactly the same as him physically
[55:24] standing in the house and laying his
[55:26] hands upon the servant because a gentile
[55:29] Faith recognizes God and His word are
[55:31] the same thing Hallelujah so now when a
[55:33] Messenger stand stood in this day and
[55:36] and the truth of the Bible would be
[55:38] unveiled now and it was Christ being
[55:40] preached now that was the same as Jesus
[55:42] himself standing there in physical form
[55:46] Hallelujah and by receiving that word
[55:47] we've become one with him amen so now
[55:51] that is that is a gentile Faith he said
[55:53] I want more of Jesus everything that
[55:55] Jesus is present amen God has fully
[55:58] revealed himself in this end time oh I
[56:00] want to see him just look into his word
[56:02] and you'll see him amen as we Behold Him
[56:05] we change from glory to glory how do you
[56:07] do that you just listen to the word read
[56:09] the word pray amen it'll transform you
[56:13] if you let it transform you amen
[56:17] now we are on a journey like like
[56:19] Rebecca was traveling from where she
[56:21] lived to a different land that she never
[56:23] heard about Hallelujah and we are on
[56:25] that same journey to leave this earth
[56:28] amen and we see that now when when Jesus
[56:31] would stand and and he would begin to
[56:33] speak in in John chapter 14 he says let
[56:36] not your heart be troubled ye believe in
[56:39] God believe also in Me and My Father's
[56:41] House of many mansions if it were not so
[56:44] I would have told you I go to prepare a
[56:46] place for you and if I go and prepare a
[56:48] place for you I will come again and will
[56:51] receive you unto myself that where I am
[56:54] not where you are where I am
[56:57] there ye may be also amen now this
[57:00] preparing a place we understand that he
[57:02] has spent these last 2,000 odd years
[57:04] preparing a place for us but then he
[57:07] says now because in my father's house in
[57:09] that father's house if you uh if you
[57:11] bring it into the modern language of
[57:13] house is a kingdom yes amen so he says
[57:16] he's actually saying in my father's
[57:17] Kingdom there are many mansions and if
[57:20] it were not so I would have told you I
[57:21] go to prepare a place for you and if I
[57:24] go and prepare a place for you I will
[57:26] come again and receive you unto myself
[57:28] now and he said that that where I am
[57:31] you'll be also so what we have is Jesus
[57:33] is saying in a future event he says I
[57:35] will come again and I'll receive you to
[57:38] myself that where I am so not in not
[57:41] because remember he was lifted up amen
[57:43] Acts chapter 1 physical form was lifted
[57:46] up and they didn't see him again in that
[57:49] way and so he's saying that that where
[57:51] he is where his physical body is amen
[57:54] there you will be also
[57:57] but then when he when he says he'll come
[57:59] again and receive us that receiving now
[58:02] is God preparing us to go to that place
[58:04] hallelujah amen because we understand
[58:06] it's the same thing with the you know
[58:08] with the wedding uh feast and things in
[58:11] the Bible terms someone would come to
[58:13] the door and Jesus speaks about it
[58:15] there's only one door into the feast you
[58:17] know someone comes in doesn't matter if
[58:18] they're rich or poor or whatever they
[58:20] were they're anointed their feet were
[58:22] you know washed and a robe was put on
[58:24] them so they were prepared now to come
[58:27] in to the feast Hallelujah they just had
[58:29] to come to the door that's all they had
[58:30] to do they received an invitation they
[58:32] came to the door the respective of good
[58:34] or bad you know it didn't matter of
[58:36] their status in Life or what they
[58:38] thought of themselves as long as they
[58:40] had the invitation they had a right to
[58:43] come into the feast amen and and the and
[58:46] the one over the feast prepared the
[58:48] guest to come in it's the same thing now
[58:51] here is he says I'll come and receive
[58:53] you to myself he he must prepare us in
[58:55] order to be received and that's why he
[58:58] died on Calvary for you amen he shed his
[59:01] blood to make us perfect in him amen and
[59:04] then the wedding garment is the baptism
[59:06] of the Holy Ghost amen the very life of
[59:09] the one that died comes and dwells in
[59:11] you and that prepares you Amen to come
[59:14] in amen hallelujah amen so he's saying
[59:18] that where he is you'll be also so this
[59:20] now when God himself
[59:23] comes amen and reveals himself
[59:26] amen that is actually a part that is the
[59:29] receiving I'll receive you unto myself
[59:32] it's all part of the receiving yes
[59:34] because now when God speaks now and we
[59:37] Faith cometh by hearing and it caus us
[59:39] to become one with him that means that's
[59:42] where that person's being received into
[59:44] the kingdom yes GL amen you following me
[59:47] yes because if you're sealed by the
[59:49] whole who has the holy ghost that means
[59:52] you're sealed not just anointed but
[59:53] you're sealed in that means you're
[59:55] sealed into to the day of your
[59:57] Redemption you have you've been you
[59:59] you've been actually already received
[1:00:02] now you just got to be ushered up into
[1:00:04] glory glory amen yes you know I think if
[1:00:07] we really recognize what we have yes
[1:00:11] amen the war between God and man is
[1:00:13] finished amen he has he has come to
[1:00:16] reconcile us back to himself and if
[1:00:19] you've met him he has amen that means
[1:00:21] you've been received amen so this
[1:00:25] message because this message is Jesus
[1:00:27] Christ
[1:00:28] revealed amen so I'll come again he came
[1:00:31] he he's not because we meet him in the
[1:00:32] air in a physical way but but this
[1:00:35] message is Jesus in word form because he
[1:00:37] is the word so now he says I come to
[1:00:41] receive you and this message is part of
[1:00:43] the receiving amen hallelujah thank you
[1:00:46] Lord that's right and then because we
[1:00:48] must understand that it's like in the
[1:00:50] first Exodus with Moses the people who
[1:00:53] really received
[1:00:56] the tree of Moses yes they came under
[1:00:58] the full effect of that word they were
[1:01:00] they went into the promised land they
[1:01:02] left Egypt and they went into the
[1:01:03] promised land and you take and then you
[1:01:06] can take the same thing in you know John
[1:01:08] the Baptist day here comes a forerunner
[1:01:11] he's preaching the people come under the
[1:01:13] influence of that Ministry amen and then
[1:01:16] they and then the whole purpose of that
[1:01:18] Ministry was to start following Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ and they did and then after John
[1:01:23] has his head's cut off and he's put in
[1:01:25] the gra all these things in they say why
[1:01:27] did the scribes say Elias must first
[1:01:29] come amen they didn't even understand
[1:01:33] what was going on but they came under
[1:01:35] the effect I know I've said this before
[1:01:36] but I just want to Anchor it in because
[1:01:38] many times we look at ourselves and say
[1:01:40] I'm not worthy I can't do it and yet
[1:01:42] your life is fully manifesting what it's
[1:01:44] meant to amen you're living out the
[1:01:46] intent of the messag Hallelujah and then
[1:01:50] so they had no idea and they had the
[1:01:52] very purpose of John they had met that
[1:01:54] purpose living out that purpose and they
[1:01:57] couldn't grasp fully who was this man on
[1:02:00] the River Bank whose words stirred my
[1:02:02] heart very strangely no other words did
[1:02:06] Hallelujah Hall the same thing with this
[1:02:08] message friends amen amen this this is
[1:02:11] Supernatural this God coming down in
[1:02:13] these last days Amen to visit his visit
[1:02:16] his church amen to prepare her to take
[1:02:19] her up into glory amen if your heart has
[1:02:21] been turned something in you says this
[1:02:24] is true Beyond how you feel or how
[1:02:27] Victorious you think you are you say has
[1:02:29] my heart been turned something in me
[1:02:32] says this is real something in me
[1:02:34] believes in spite of all the doubt and
[1:02:36] all the questions and all the critics
[1:02:39] amen and all what everyone else is doing
[1:02:41] something me says yes and God proves it
[1:02:44] to you and says this is me hallelujah
[1:02:47] hallelujah what's happening now you've
[1:02:48] come under the effect of it and you're
[1:02:50] on your way amen glory hallelujah
[1:02:53] hallelujah amen amen
[1:02:57] now I put a part of this on WhatsApp
[1:02:59] yesterday but I I I was just reading
[1:03:01] above and I was just so blessed this is
[1:03:03] from the Lamb's Book of Life okay I'm
[1:03:06] going to get into really what this is
[1:03:08] all Foundation basically he says what
[1:03:10] are we scared what we scared about
[1:03:12] listen to me my weary brother the Bible
[1:03:15] said that Jesus was the Lamb of God
[1:03:17] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:03:19] notice now this Burns how this burns
[1:03:22] your heart how this gives you the hope
[1:03:24] way back before the foundation of the
[1:03:26] world when Satan perverted to evil God
[1:03:29] being infinite looked down through the
[1:03:31] stream of time and saw the end for
[1:03:33] knowledge if he don't know all things
[1:03:36] you have a limited God you have made him
[1:03:38] finite like you and I but God is
[1:03:40] unlimited God's power God's knowledge
[1:03:43] everything he's
[1:03:45] omnipotent way back before the
[1:03:47] foundation of the world when Satan done
[1:03:49] the evil cuz Satan had in his mind what
[1:03:52] he was going to do then pardon me God
[1:03:56] seen how he could counteract it amen the
[1:03:59] Bible said in the beginning was the word
[1:04:01] St John 1 and the Word was with God and
[1:04:04] the Word was God in the beginning when
[1:04:06] time began it was eternity before that
[1:04:09] it was this is in time we're talking
[1:04:11] about eternity is like a
[1:04:13] panoramic uh it never ends it's a circle
[1:04:16] continually forever and forever and
[1:04:18] forever it's an endless wheel that never
[1:04:22] stops or never has an end to it but
[1:04:24] Satan put a break there and come down
[1:04:27] here and would have spoiled the whole
[1:04:29] thing but God seen where there' be a
[1:04:32] space of time and being the great
[1:04:34] infinite one from the beginning to
[1:04:37] beginning he he looked down and he was
[1:04:39] in the beginning the
[1:04:41] Worden now a word is a thought expressed
[1:04:44] God begin to think as he begin to see
[1:04:47] every human being that ever come on the
[1:04:49] earth and every bird and every flea and
[1:04:51] every fly Hallelujah that makes that
[1:04:54] makes him the Almighty etern ever
[1:04:56] present God that's the one we serve this
[1:04:58] morning way back in the beginning when
[1:05:01] he seen that there was some people that
[1:05:03] was going to desire to be saved some
[1:05:07] people who was going to want to be saved
[1:05:10] some people who would be loyal in their
[1:05:12] heart they wanted to be saved then he's
[1:05:15] going to make a preparation for their
[1:05:17] salvation say well I had no desire to be
[1:05:20] saved before I heard the word faith
[1:05:21] cometh by hearing amen and when you come
[1:05:23] under the sound of the word something in
[1:05:25] says you I want that I may not obtain to
[1:05:28] that now I may feel unworthy but
[1:05:29] something in me says I want it that is
[1:05:32] the desire to be
[1:05:33] safe that God put in you remember God
[1:05:36] put it in you you didn't put it in you
[1:05:38] amen amen God put it in you he says now
[1:05:43] they wanted to be saved then he got to
[1:05:45] make a preparation for their salvation
[1:05:47] that's right or they will never be saved
[1:05:49] and he knows that anything imperfect
[1:05:52] cannot come into heaven so he has has to
[1:05:56] make a way for Perfection uh for that
[1:05:58] amen you see it then back there he said
[1:06:01] I myself will come down into the world
[1:06:03] and take on human flesh I'll pay the
[1:06:05] penalty that's required there and I'll
[1:06:07] take the place and I'll make them
[1:06:09] perfect because I'll bring them in me
[1:06:11] and I am perfect then when Jesus said be
[1:06:13] ye therefore perfect even uh even as
[1:06:17] those that God is perfect then here was
[1:06:19] this mangled body that was beaten and
[1:06:21] bruised for sin and every sin in the
[1:06:23] world ever had or ever would have was
[1:06:26] laid upon him and he is the body that
[1:06:29] the je that the Jehovah raised up in the
[1:06:31] last days there on the third day after
[1:06:34] his death and if we are in that body we
[1:06:36] are just as perfect as the body is amen
[1:06:39] there you are how do you get into that
[1:06:41] body how do you get in the Bible says in
[1:06:44] Romans 8:1 that's therefore no
[1:06:46] condemnation to them that which are in
[1:06:48] Christ Jesus that walk not after the
[1:06:50] flesh but the spirit they don't care
[1:06:53] what the world says or what anybody else
[1:06:55] says or even what their family says they
[1:06:59] uh they walk in the spirit of God in
[1:07:01] perfect Divine love you see it how do
[1:07:04] you get into it by journeying Church by
[1:07:05] shaking hands by water baptism no sir uh
[1:07:09] the 12th chapter of First Corinthians by
[1:07:11] one Spirit we're all baptized into one
[1:07:13] body being members of that body and then
[1:07:16] it's not what I've done what I am who I
[1:07:19] was or nothing about it it's what God
[1:07:22] has done for me in Christ and we are
[1:07:24] perfect with sacrifice he makes no
[1:07:27] mistakes now no you just listen he makes
[1:07:30] no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if
[1:07:33] you wasn't worthy amen he knows your
[1:07:36] heart that's right he knows what you are
[1:07:39] he knows your motives he knows what you
[1:07:41] are there's traps all along the road
[1:07:44] Shore the devil will cause you to
[1:07:47] stumble yes and say God I don't mean to
[1:07:51] do that God you know it you're still
[1:07:54] perfect because a perfect blood offered
[1:07:57] for you for every day and a bleeding
[1:07:59] sacrifice hanging over Before the Throne
[1:08:02] of God Almighty that's rightl how did
[1:08:06] you get in there God by for knowledge
[1:08:08] now God said that Jesus Now put on your
[1:08:11] caps get uh you get open your heart look
[1:08:15] the Bible said that Jesus was the lamb
[1:08:17] slain from where the foundation of the
[1:08:19] world he was slay why God the father
[1:08:22] when he looked down and seen Jesus never
[1:08:26] come just to die a hap haed death death
[1:08:29] yes he never came and say well maybe
[1:08:31] somebody will have pity when they see
[1:08:33] the way I die and everything no it
[1:08:36] wasn't God don't run his business like
[1:08:40] that God runs his business perfect
[1:08:43] that's right he knows exactly what was
[1:08:46] going to take place that's where he
[1:08:49] could force uh forese he knows exactly
[1:08:52] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:08:53] he's not willing but if he is infinite
[1:08:56] he knows who will and who won't
[1:08:58] therefore you can rest assure if you
[1:09:00] have received God and been filled with
[1:09:03] the Holy Ghost hello you're anchored to
[1:09:06] your Eternal destination
[1:09:09] correctly amen amen he forn knows yes
[1:09:13] amen hallelujah now watch now I'm just
[1:09:15] sorry oh I actually don't apologize I'm
[1:09:17] just reading now watch the Bible said
[1:09:20] that Jesus the lamb was slain from the
[1:09:22] foundation of the world uh was ever laid
[1:09:26] uh he says I know I act funny up here I
[1:09:28] feel glorious look Jesus was slain
[1:09:30] before the world even had the first
[1:09:32] Speck of dirt laj Jesus was already
[1:09:35] slayed why because God here it do get it
[1:09:37] God by for knowledge when he was the
[1:09:39] word in the beginning he perceived the
[1:09:41] thought now it's just a thought but when
[1:09:44] he spoke it said it shall be Jesus was
[1:09:46] slain yes the very minute God spoke the
[1:09:49] word then what 4,000 years later he come
[1:09:51] and paid the price that God had already
[1:09:54] done back then already spoke it now
[1:09:57] believer have you got your joy shoes on
[1:09:59] Amen have you got your joy shoes on
[1:10:02] listen to this if you're a Christian if
[1:10:03] you're truly God's child the Bible said
[1:10:06] that's not a preacher that's the Bible
[1:10:08] it said your names was written in the
[1:10:10] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:10:12] foundation of the world oh my the same
[1:10:14] time that Christ that God sent Christ to
[1:10:16] be slain he wrote your name with his
[1:10:19] Hallelujah glory amen you see so what
[1:10:22] are we what are we afraid about amen
[1:10:25] amen what are we afraid about hallelujah
[1:10:28] hallelujah he said remember he says he
[1:10:30] makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you
[1:10:33] in if he wasn't worthy this is a direct
[1:10:35] quote from brother Brandon amen I don't
[1:10:38] feel worthy forget it amen he wouldn't
[1:10:41] have called you if you weren't worthy he
[1:10:44] wouldn't have brought you in if he
[1:10:45] didn't think you're worthy didn't know
[1:10:46] you're worthy Hallelujah that's right
[1:10:50] amen so now Hallelujah now but often
[1:10:55] you know I'm I'm still you know sing to
[1:10:58] my subject but often we think of the
[1:11:01] Christian War cuz we see Rebecca she
[1:11:03] gets on the camel she goes straight to
[1:11:05] Isaac yes amen amen that's what's
[1:11:06] recorded because in God's word often the
[1:11:09] important things are recorded uh but
[1:11:11] there was many it's like 500 odd miles
[1:11:14] from where she was to where she was
[1:11:15] going could have taken a while on a
[1:11:17] camel back right but there's no record
[1:11:19] of any hardship of any things they had
[1:11:21] to endure you know all all that's
[1:11:24] recorded as she went on the camel and
[1:11:25] she went with Alasia to meet her Isaac
[1:11:28] and often we can think of the Christian
[1:11:30] walking the same way amen where
[1:11:32] everything is sunshine and smiles once
[1:11:34] you meet the Lord and everything's going
[1:11:35] to be well but we understand and I'm
[1:11:38] sure we all understand that the
[1:11:40] Christian walk isn't always sunshine and
[1:11:42] smiles but there's a lot of hardship and
[1:11:45] bitterness that that a a Believer must
[1:11:47] endure now remember the Christian walk
[1:11:50] is not always trials it's not always
[1:11:53] hardship amen it's not always a bad time
[1:11:55] there's a lot of good times amen and
[1:11:57] there's more good times than bad hey
[1:11:59] when you receive God that's the only
[1:12:01] good time you ever need have you been
[1:12:04] sealed in that's all that matters your
[1:12:05] Eternal destination is settled no one
[1:12:08] can you can't change it the devil sure
[1:12:11] can't change it and God is not going to
[1:12:13] change it amen but you know so so the
[1:12:17] Christian walk is not all
[1:12:19] struggles amen if you're going through a
[1:12:21] struggle just keep walking with God
[1:12:23] doesn't matter remember this is a faith
[1:12:25] walk amen if you have to go through wait
[1:12:28] amen if you have to go through all kinds
[1:12:29] of things I just was meant to put this
[1:12:31] on my notes but we'll go to the book of
[1:12:33] Isaiah am I want to read you some
[1:12:36] things Isaiah
[1:12:39] 43 amen we have confidence I tell you
[1:12:42] what we have Supreme
[1:12:43] confidence amen I I settled it in my
[1:12:47] heart a few years ago if God wants me at
[1:12:50] a wedding supper table yes amen the only
[1:12:53] reason I'm there is because he wants me
[1:12:54] there
[1:12:56] in spite of me he'll get me there if he
[1:12:59] wants me there I believe he wants me
[1:13:01] there amen that's why he receed me here
[1:13:03] is because he wants me there am me so we
[1:13:06] don't need to worry about whatever we
[1:13:08] whatever bombardment The Guns of the
[1:13:10] devil and all these things amen it only
[1:13:12] releases us the fire the fire released
[1:13:16] the Hebrew children in the furnace did
[1:13:18] it not they went inbound but they didn't
[1:13:20] walk out bound it was the fire that set
[1:13:23] them free Hallelujah you say I'm in a
[1:13:26] furnace it'll just set you freeall amen
[1:13:30] hallelujah we have Supreme confidence I
[1:13:32] have Supreme confidence whatever we're
[1:13:34] going through oh it's terrible no doubt
[1:13:37] it probably is terrible yes but God
[1:13:39] allowed it God ordained it amen God has
[1:13:43] confidence in you and he's got
[1:13:45] confidence in his
[1:13:46] salvation amen hallelujah amen God
[1:13:50] doesn't leave us just CU we've got bad
[1:13:52] days God doesn't leave us just cuz we

[1:13:56] us just cuz we're going through a hard
[1:13:58] time it's been years God doesn't leave

[1:14:13] created thee oh Jacob and he that formed
[1:14:17] thee o Israel remember we Are Spiritual

[1:14:37] name that's it thank you Lord so you
[1:14:38] have heard see I have called thee by
[1:14:40] name Thou Art mine amen amen now when
[1:14:44] God declares ownership over something
[1:14:46] good luck trying to
[1:14:49] argue that's it and sometimes we
[1:14:51] struggle and we say you know don't agree
[1:14:54] with because the devil tries to tell you
[1:14:56] you don't belong to God he doesn't care
[1:14:58] about you look what he did to even the
[1:15:01] garden yeah has God said a distant God

[1:15:07] relationship yeah has God said this

[1:15:24] does it's his method all the way down

[1:15:29] don't belong to God I'm sorry if your
[1:15:31] name is being called by this message you

[1:18:39] where it looked like going to be the
[1:18:40] biggest Massacre there there would ever
[1:18:42] be at that time God ordained it and then
[1:18:45] God opens the Red Sea and they come
[1:18:47] through and their enemies are defeated
[1:18:49] behind them and they have a good old
[1:18:51] Pentecostal meeting there and then when

[1:19:26] read cuz Paul is admonishing
[1:19:29] here you know there's
[1:19:32] things God allows us to endure things
[1:19:35] and to experience things and they're not
[1:19:37] always good yes amen that's right and
[1:19:41] sometimes we like to Major on the
[1:19:42] wonderful glories of being in the
[1:19:44] presence of God and our Christian walk
[1:19:46] like that and God comes down and God
[1:19:48] speaks to us we have such a wonderful
[1:19:49] time and those things are all true and
[1:19:52] real amen hallelujah but there's another
[1:19:55] part of the Walk where we need to
[1:19:57] remember this is all part of the Walk

[1:20:03] 12 and we'll just we're just going to

[1:20:11] now uh from verse three of Hebrews 12
[1:20:13] and we'll go down to verse
[1:20:15] 15 and and we are going to come to the
[1:20:18] later part if we have if we have time
[1:20:19] permits for he considered him that
[1:20:22] endured such a contradiction of sinners
[1:20:24] against him lest they be weed and faint
[1:20:28] lest ye be weired and faint in your
[1:20:30] minds ye have not resisted unto blood
[1:20:33] striving against sin and ye have
[1:20:36] forgotten the exaltation which speaketh
[1:20:38] unto you as unto children my
[1:20:41] son despise not thou the chastening of
[1:20:45] the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked
[1:20:48] of him for when the Lord for whom the
[1:20:51] Lord loveth amen he chasteneth and
[1:20:55] scourgeth every son whom he receives if
[1:20:58] you endure chastening God deal with you
[1:21:01] as with sons for what son is he whom the
[1:21:05] father chasteneth not but if ye be
[1:21:08] without chastisement therefore ye are

[1:24:01] they came they came to this place this
[1:24:04] this uh it's in Exodus
[1:24:08] 12 oh no sorry in Exodus 12 is when they
[1:24:11] take the Passover yes and when he's in
[1:24:15] when there when Moses is instructing the
[1:24:17] people it says roast it with fire and
[1:24:20] unleavened bread and with bitter herbs
[1:24:24] why why is there why is there a
[1:24:25] bitterness that must be Associated why
[1:24:28] would there be bitterness associated
[1:24:30] with the very sacrifice that means Death
[1:24:33] Shall Not Touch the house what a
[1:24:35] glorious Deliverance they had that night
[1:24:37] but yet there was a bitterness
[1:24:39] associated with that with that with that
[1:24:41] Passover Lamb yes and it is the same
[1:24:44] thing with us there is a bitterness amen
[1:24:48] Jesus Jesus lived a bitter
[1:24:51] life amen but he didn't let it make him
[1:24:55] bitter that's right amen it didn't let
[1:24:57] him he when he died on Calvary he said
[1:25:00] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:25:02] they doing if he let his bitter life get
[1:25:05] a hold of him he would have cursed them
[1:25:08] yes in the name of God yes amen he would
[1:25:11] have he would never have gone to Calvary
[1:25:13] he would have called Angels you know I
[1:25:15] just need to say a word I've got whole
[1:25:17] bunch of Legions of angels and they're
[1:25:19] all brother said they're all waiting
[1:25:21] there amen Michael and and wormwood all
[1:25:23] these mighty Angels they're saying just
[1:25:25] nod your head when he's when he's taking
[1:25:27] the beatings and all these things he
[1:25:29] they're all stand there just nod your
[1:25:30] head the prophet says and we'll change
[1:25:32] the whole picture amen and if he was
[1:25:34] bitter he would have said you know it
[1:25:36] would never have got to that place he
[1:25:38] would have wiped out the whole thing
[1:25:40] amen amen he would have done it and he
[1:25:42] could have done it all power is given
[1:25:44] unto me he cursed a fig
[1:25:46] tree Jerusalem get into the sea and the
[1:25:49] whole thing would have moved he could
[1:25:51] have rained far down out of heaven like
[1:25:53] Sodom Gomorrah if he wanted
[1:25:55] he could have done it amen he's the very
[1:25:58] Creator in flesh he can do what he wants
[1:26:01] he's Sovereign amen but because he
[1:26:03] didn't let the this these things become
[1:26:06] bitter he could lay he could just hang
[1:26:08] himself there they didn't need
[1:26:10] Nails amen they didn't need to put him
[1:26:13] there he would have he would have hung
[1:26:15] there
[1:26:17] amen why because there's no he didn't
[1:26:19] let anything become it didn't become
[1:26:21] bter than you amen H and so now they
[1:26:26] came to this this is in
[1:26:28] Exodus no sorry this is in Exodus 15
[1:26:32] where they come to this place called
[1:26:33] Mara which means bitter amen and they
[1:26:36] drink and they say the whole you know
[1:26:37] this whole place is bitter yes amen now
[1:26:40] many others would have come to the same
[1:26:42] pool many others would have been
[1:26:44] journeying and they would have come to
[1:26:45] the same pool and they would have drunk
[1:26:47] the bit of water and they would have no
[1:26:50] doubt seen the tree that God told Moses
[1:26:52] to cut down yes amen and throw in to
[1:26:54] make it sweet they would have seen it
[1:26:56] but God didn't tell them to do that to
[1:26:59] make it sweet that they could
[1:27:00] drink amen he he following me amen it
[1:27:04] was in God's season now when God's
[1:27:06] children were coming through this place
[1:27:08] where those Waters would turn sweet amen
[1:27:12] and the I'll say this the bride of
[1:27:13] Christ is the only one upon the
[1:27:16] Earth that experiences in life that make
[1:27:19] people bitter yes they are the only
[1:27:22] people that have the thing that can turn
[1:27:25] that experience into a sweet thingl amen
[1:27:28] that can take the busness out of the
[1:27:30] experience because that tree we
[1:27:33] understand brother Brown speaks about
[1:27:34] and he and he and he says that that tree
[1:27:36] was Calvary amen that was chopped down
[1:27:39] amen put into the water to make it sweet
[1:27:41] that people could drink that's right
[1:27:43] amen so now GL we are here we must
[1:27:47] understand this is why this is why Paul
[1:27:49] is saying lift up the hands that hang
[1:27:51] down you know and the feeble knees and
[1:27:53] all these things he's saying because
[1:27:55] this you have something that can turn
[1:27:57] the bitterness of your life or the
[1:27:59] things that make you know the things you
[1:28:00] don't understand amen you can take those
[1:28:03] things amen and take it and then so it's
[1:28:06] not bitter to you anymore but it's
[1:28:08] actually
[1:28:09] sweet amen hallelujah they were still
[1:28:12] drinking the water the water was still
[1:28:14] the same water but it was changed so the
[1:28:16] experience was still the same but it was
[1:28:18] just changed amen because of one act
[1:28:20] that made it
[1:28:22] different and now brother BR said says
[1:28:24] this is in redemption in completeness
[1:28:26] and joy in
[1:28:27] 54 he says
[1:28:29] sometimes God has to lay you on your
[1:28:32] back with a sickness that the doctors
[1:28:34] say you're going to die God could give
[1:28:37] you uh God could give you a little
[1:28:39] special treatment so you'll love him a
[1:28:42] little more that's right amen he says
[1:28:44] some through the waters some through the
[1:28:46] flood some through deep trials but all
[1:28:49] through the blood Jesus leads his church
[1:28:52] now when they were there and the waters
[1:28:55] were bitter and they couldn't drink God
[1:28:57] provided away a little old tree swinging
[1:29:00] there on the bank Moses cut it down and
[1:29:03] throw it in the water changed the whole
[1:29:05] thing to good sweet water now when you
[1:29:08] come up against one of your bitter
[1:29:11] Waters or something another like that
[1:29:14] there's a tree tonight spiritually
[1:29:16] speaking hanging over gol gotha or the
[1:29:19] world tonight that'll sweeten any bitter
[1:29:22] Waters that you may be led by remember
[1:29:26] they were LED they were led to drink of
[1:29:28] those bitter Waters yes amen
[1:29:31] amen that's right that Calvary will
[1:29:35] sweeten any experience he says many
[1:29:38] times we get into hard places and wonder
[1:29:41] how but I shut my eyes sometime and
[1:29:44] think Yonder on gol gotha where my
[1:29:45] redeemer bled and died for my life then
[1:29:48] my trial seem so little I just throw
[1:29:52] aide and walk on it makes it sweet it
[1:29:55] sweetens every experience I ever had
[1:29:58] amen he always sweetens it when I come
[1:30:01] to my Waters of Mara and remember the
[1:30:04] prophet went through very a lot of
[1:30:06] bitter times in life he didn't have a
[1:30:09] flowery bed of East that's right you
[1:30:10] know his life story any of those things
[1:30:13] could have made him very bitter against
[1:30:15] God incredibly bitter you know he said
[1:30:19] about you know every time a crossy child
[1:30:22] with cross eyes would come across the
[1:30:24] they never left the platform that way
[1:30:26] Hallelujah and the people had no idea
[1:30:28] what he had to endure amen the
[1:30:31] incredible bitter time you know you know
[1:30:33] you read about it you know every time he
[1:30:36] tells the story of when you his first
[1:30:37] wife hope dies and when Sharon Rose Dies
[1:30:40] he's in tears amen it's still it still
[1:30:42] cut you know he's very sad about it he's
[1:30:45] still you know
[1:30:46] devastated but he's not bitter about it
[1:30:49] and little Sharon Rose you know the
[1:30:51] story her eyes were crossing in pain
[1:30:53] before she died
[1:30:54] and because that happened to the prophet
[1:30:56] amen and he took it to Calvary and it
[1:30:59] became sweet it wasn't bitter anymore
[1:31:01] amen then he could enter into the burden
[1:31:03] of every crosy child that came across
[1:31:04] the platform he says hundreds amen amen
[1:31:07] were healed and the people had no idea
[1:31:10] the bitter Waters he had to drink amen
[1:31:12] for them to
[1:31:13] receive C sight you see hallelujah amen
[1:31:17] he just took it to
[1:31:18] calary amen that tree that's why I say
[1:31:22] we have what we need
[1:31:24] am me to make any bitter experience
[1:31:26] sweet am thank you Lord Jesus amen they
[1:31:29] say well I've been through terrible
[1:31:31] things he went through terrible things
[1:31:33] we've been through terrible things take
[1:31:35] it there's a tree hanging amen they can
[1:31:39] change those Waters to be
[1:31:41] sweet
[1:31:43] amen so this is where this is where you
[1:31:47] know God God took them when they came
[1:31:49] out from the Red Sea and we are not
[1:31:52] exempt now from bitter experience
[1:31:54] expences and that's why Paul says look
[1:31:57] diligently least any man fail of the
[1:32:00] grace of God or fall from the grace of
[1:32:02] God lest any root of bitterness spring
[1:32:05] up trouble you and thereby many be
[1:32:07] defiled so he's saying do not let so
[1:32:11] he's so he's not saying you won't
[1:32:12] experience bitter things because we do
[1:32:14] experience bitter things he says don't
[1:32:16] let it take root in you yes and defile
[1:32:19] you amen amen because at the end of the
[1:32:22] day when bad things happen to us amen uh
[1:32:25] it doesn't really you know it it all
[1:32:27] depends what you're going to do about it
[1:32:28] yes amen amen it doesn't matter if
[1:32:30] you're right you the other person was
[1:32:32] totally in the wrong yes you know it
[1:32:34] doesn't matter if they daylight robbery
[1:32:37] or whatever it was but are you going to
[1:32:40] let it be are you going to let it become
[1:32:42] bter or or is it going to make you
[1:32:44] better amen amen cuz remember brother
[1:32:47] Bram his wife dying his child dying that
[1:32:50] actually because he took it to Calvary
[1:32:52] it made him better
[1:32:54] yes am amen amen one incredible loss but
[1:32:57] it made him better didn't make him
[1:32:59] bitter that could have become a root of
[1:33:01] bitterness and it could have defiled him
[1:33:03] yes you see and so it's the same thing
[1:33:06] with us now people doesn't matter if
[1:33:09] they're in the you know Believers or
[1:33:10] whatever they are they can come and and
[1:33:13] total misunderstandings can
[1:33:15] happen and and the devil can just take
[1:33:18] that thing yes that's right and it turn
[1:33:20] into a big cowy tree that's it amen and
[1:33:24] what happens now is that if if if
[1:33:27] something happens against us and we
[1:33:30] don't take it to Calvary we can always
[1:33:32] be looking through yes it's like a lens
[1:33:36] it's you know you it becomes like a
[1:33:37] filter that's right and everything in
[1:33:39] life is now filtered through that
[1:33:41] through that complex or that experience
[1:33:42] yes yes amen amen even though things can
[1:33:46] can happen and they totally unrelated
[1:33:48] yes right different totally different
[1:33:50] place different time whatever it could
[1:33:51] be years down the road yes but because
[1:33:54] that root of bitterness is there that
[1:33:57] filter is there you will look at
[1:33:58] something different to really how you
[1:34:00] should be looking at it amen cuz that
[1:34:03] how else can you be defiled the only way
[1:34:05] a person can be defiled is if something
[1:34:07] takes you off the beaten path takes you
[1:34:09] off the rugged way you see and that's
[1:34:12] and that's why Paul is saying don't let
[1:34:14] a root of busness spring up amen amen
[1:34:17] cuz it'll it'll it'll put a filter in
[1:34:19] there it'll warp your whole War a whole
[1:34:22] person's warp yes
[1:34:25] amen so that's why Paul says do not let
[1:34:27] these things spring up will they try
[1:34:30] absolutely will they try and grow yes
[1:34:34] amen we have the same five senses we
[1:34:37] have the same emotional realm we have
[1:34:39] the same body as an unbeliever but the
[1:34:42] soul is redeemed there's a life in there
[1:34:44] that is more powerful than anything else
[1:34:46] yes Lord hallelujah that's right and
[1:34:50] that's why that's why brother Ram could
[1:34:51] overcome everything that happened in his
[1:34:53] life yeah you see and become better amen
[1:34:57] and these things happened that we could
[1:34:59] look and read them and see this is how
[1:35:01] God was in a man and this is how he
[1:35:03] overcame certain things in life yes
[1:35:06] that's why he shares testimonies and all
[1:35:07] these things he could have you
[1:35:10] know you read standing in the Gap I
[1:35:12] think it's standing in the Gap and he
[1:35:14] preaches about you know he wanted to he
[1:35:16] was this close to becoming just go up to
[1:35:19] Northern British Columbia that's right
[1:35:21] you know and just becoming a guide
[1:35:23] because the people were rejecting the
[1:35:25] message 1963 remember Jesus Jesus you
[1:35:29] know in in this l in church J says
[1:35:31] behold I stand at the door and knock he
[1:35:33] was kicked out and this had to be lived
[1:35:35] out in the ministry of the Prophet
[1:35:37] that's why when he moved to Tucson he
[1:35:38] says you know not one church has invited
[1:35:40] me amen why cuz and he he's standing at
[1:35:43] the door knocking amen amen so then he
[1:35:45] got to a place he says no I'm sick of
[1:35:47] this I always wanted to be a hunter I'm
[1:35:49] going to go up to Northern British
[1:35:50] Columbia be a guide and if God puts
[1:35:52] anything on my heart stomp out of the
[1:35:54] Wilderness like an Old Testament Prophet
[1:35:56] say thus say the Lord and preach or
[1:35:58] whatever then then go back up there what
[1:36:01] why is that he lost the feeling for the
[1:36:03] people because now something had because
[1:36:07] he'd been rejected now what had happened
[1:36:09] a root of buness was trying to spring up
[1:36:12] you mean it a prophet he's still a man
[1:36:14] amen just like us Elijah was a man of
[1:36:16] like passions amen so but then God came
[1:36:20] in a Sovereign Grace and God pointed out
[1:36:22] a couple of B on the street said if you
[1:36:25] go what you if you do what you want to
[1:36:28] do amen if you do what you want you'll
[1:36:30] end up like them yes and your wife will
[1:36:32] leave you in all these things he could
[1:36:34] have kept walking that way yes yes
[1:36:37] amen now that doesn't harm his salvation
[1:36:41] you understand yes our destination may
[1:36:43] be sealed yes but there's things we do
[1:36:46] amen yes how Victorious do you want to
[1:36:48] be in this life amen how Victorious do
[1:36:51] you want to be I want to be 100% Victor
[1:36:54] amen if he paid it all and his intention
[1:36:57] was people would just Crest every wave
[1:36:59] didn't matter if they had the submarine
[1:37:01] through a few they'll keep a float
[1:37:02] eventually yes amen amen you know and
[1:37:05] then so that he could have walked that
[1:37:07] way if he chose to CU God's a gentleman
[1:37:09] yes you mean but he's been walking he he
[1:37:11] was commissioned in 1947 whatever you
[1:37:14] whatever you know the angel of the Lord
[1:37:15] came to the cave whatever year that was
[1:37:17] great you know Ministry around the world
[1:37:20] all these things and yet down the end he
[1:37:23] let a choice to walk away and do what he
[1:37:25] wanted yes yeah
[1:37:27] absolutely amen you know Jesus poured
[1:37:32] himself out amen and it doesn't matter
[1:37:35] if the people hated him or whatever it
[1:37:36] was he just ped himself out now us being
[1:37:40] the bride of
[1:37:42] Christ we are called to the same same
[1:37:44] life not to give ourselves die die for
[1:37:48] the sins of the world that's been done
[1:37:49] he paid it all but just to pour
[1:37:51] ourselves out to live a
[1:37:54] selfless life not a selfish life a
[1:37:57] selfless life am and it doesn't matter
[1:38:00] about who the person is that comes to

[1:38:46] already have and some people will yes
[1:38:48] that's right amen doesn't me I'm talking
[1:38:51] about believer unbeliever make beli
[1:38:53] whatever it doesn't matter they use
[1:38:55] Jesus yes Simon you know that Pharisee
[1:38:59] he he had him invited to a feast just to
[1:39:02] make fun of him that's right but Jesus
[1:39:04] you know the prophet tells us wherever
[1:39:06] Jesus invited he
[1:39:08] goes
[1:39:09] amen and they were trying to make use of
[1:39:14] him but he allowed himself he didn't he
[1:39:17] didn't he said I've got one thing to say
[1:39:18] against the of course he did but he
[1:39:21] allowed himself to go
[1:39:24] imagine if he sat there and he and he
[1:39:27] was resenting this Pharisee and
[1:39:29] resenting all these Hypocrites and all
[1:39:30] these things and then now this woman
[1:39:32] comes to anoint his feet all these
[1:39:34] things he would have said what do you
[1:39:36] get out of here what are you
[1:39:39] doing amen but he lived a selfless
[1:39:43] life amen and we you know and you look
[1:39:46] at that whole
[1:39:47] situation he called that Feast he
[1:39:50] invited the guests alsoo woman could
[1:39:53] find Salvation in in his house amen so
[1:39:58] sometimes we can go on things in life
[1:40:00] you what am I doing here what's this all
[1:40:02] about there might be a woman with an
[1:40:04] alabaster
[1:40:06] box amen hallelujah that's right amen so
[1:40:11] now we must not let these
[1:40:14] things uh let us become bitter amen
[1:40:19] now that's why he says lift up your
[1:40:21] hands amen rejoice in these things
[1:40:24] rejoice in the hardship Hallelujah but
[1:40:27] then now Paul and we'll just skip a
[1:40:29] couple of verses but we'll just actually
[1:40:31] go to our text in verse 18 but Paul is
[1:40:34] saying now for ye have not come he
[1:40:37] begins to make a contrast says this is
[1:40:38] part of your journey Amen to be
[1:40:41] corrected to be chastised don't let
[1:40:43] Burness come in and defile you all
[1:40:45] that's part of your walk but then he
[1:40:47] says now but you have not come to mount
[1:40:49] mount Z I mean I mean Mount Si you have
[1:40:52] not come to the the law you have not
[1:40:54] come to these things which you've
[1:40:55] actually left You' have come to a
[1:40:57] different
[1:40:58] place and he says in verse 22 but ye
[1:41:02] have come unto Mount Zion and unto the
[1:41:05] city of the Living God the heavenly
[1:41:07] Jerusalem and to an innumerable company
[1:41:10] of angels now Mount Zion speaks of the
[1:41:12] Bride brother tells us the future home
[1:41:15] that Zion always speaks of the bride and
[1:41:16] he goes to a scripture in Isaiah 4 and
[1:41:19] he speaks about the daughters of
[1:41:22] Zion and he says now that always speaks
[1:41:24] of the bride and if I have it here he
[1:41:27] says now he says and when the Lord shall
[1:41:31] have washed away the filth of the
[1:41:32] daughters of Zion and shall have purged
[1:41:34] the blood of Jerusalem from the midst
[1:41:36] thereof of the spring uh uh by the
[1:41:38] spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
[1:41:40] burning and the Lord will create upon
[1:41:42] every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and
[1:41:44] upon her assemblies a cloud and a smoke
[1:41:46] by day and a shining of a flaming fire
[1:41:48] by night for upon all the glory shall be
[1:41:51] a defense and there shall be a
[1:41:52] tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
[1:41:55] from the Heat and for a place of refuge
[1:41:57] and for a and and for a cover uh from
[1:42:01] storm and from rain if if you read the
[1:42:03] whole and he says Mount Zion speaks to
[1:42:05] the bride saying you have come to where
[1:42:07] the bride is you have come to the bride
[1:42:10] I mean you've been called to to to be
[1:42:12] part of this bride now it says into the
[1:42:15] Heavenly Jerusalem yesen he says unto
[1:42:18] the city of the Living God and we are
[1:42:21] remember we're Lively Stones built into
[1:42:22] the yes building amen so we are the
[1:42:25] Tabernacle of the Living God amen amen
[1:42:28] he says this is where you've come to
[1:42:30] where God comes and dwells in you amen
[1:42:32] and unto innumerable company of angels
[1:42:35] now this innumerable company uh it uses
[1:42:38] similar words as when uh John sees you
[1:42:41] know the 200,000,000 Devils come out of
[1:42:44] the river Euphrates it's such a high
[1:42:45] number that you know they couldn't
[1:42:47] really they didn't really have a figure
[1:42:48] in those days so he's saying now that
[1:42:50] you've come to a place where where God
[1:42:53] this this unseen realm is affecting
[1:42:55] where you live amen because before
[1:42:59] remember well this is this is me anyway
[1:43:02] before I heard this message I believe
[1:43:05] sure God is the same and God is real
[1:43:07] Jesus is real but it wasn't a a reality
[1:43:11] it wasn't a reality that God is alive
[1:43:13] and well and he's and he's really
[1:43:15] interested in what man is doing and
[1:43:16] Gathering his bride you know it wasn't
[1:43:18] such a real thing that God is is with us
[1:43:21] every day and is dealing every day it
[1:43:23] was a yes he's real yes he's the same
[1:43:26] but he's distant someplace amen and in
[1:43:28] the ministry of Jesus Christ what
[1:43:30] happened is he he causes disciples to
[1:43:34] see that there's so much more than what
[1:43:36] these eyes declare that's right but
[1:43:37] there's an unseen realm there's hell and
[1:43:39] there's heaven and there's you know and
[1:43:41] there's devils and there's angels and
[1:43:42] you know he made them you know he opened
[1:43:44] a realm to them that they did not know
[1:43:46] just fishing on a fishing boat or going
[1:43:48] to the synagogue as the same thing now
[1:43:51] when when Jesus Christ has made the same
[1:43:53] yesterday today and forever and not just
[1:43:55] in 1965 but in
[1:43:57] 2015 where we see God alive and well
[1:44:00] amen that whole unseen realm becomes a
[1:44:02] very real place to us now so he says you
[1:44:05] have come to an an innumerable company
[1:44:08] of angels that's right and angels are
[1:44:09] sent to minister to the ear of Salvation
[1:44:12] so we can see that even in our everyday
[1:44:14] life angels are
[1:44:15] influencing are influencing our Liv yes
[1:44:18] amen amen so we have come to an
[1:44:20] inumerable company of angels to the
[1:44:22] general assembly and the Church of the
[1:44:24] firstborn which are written in heaven
[1:44:27] amen and that means those that are
[1:44:30] written in heaven is more than just on
[1:44:32] the book of life but the Lamb's Book of
[1:44:34] Life yes
[1:44:37] amen and to God the judge of
[1:44:41] all now why would we come he says he
[1:44:45] says now you have not come to Mount Si
[1:44:47] and on Mount Si they received the law
[1:44:49] well that was a judge that was judgment
[1:44:51] that was the judge you know the law giv
[1:44:53] was there amen but but now Paul is
[1:44:55] actually contrasting saying you have
[1:44:57] come to a different Mountain amen and to
[1:45:00] God the judge of all you mean isn't he
[1:45:03] isn't he mercy and Grace he is but
[1:45:06] remember a judge has the final say the
[1:45:09] Supreme Court has the has the supreme
[1:45:11] authority in in any land you see and so
[1:45:15] now the
[1:45:16] judge he is he is the judge of all
[1:45:19] because he has judged just
[1:45:21] righteous am mean you read in John
[1:45:23] chapter 8 now where where the Pharisees
[1:45:25] and things they they they bring a woman
[1:45:27] caught in adultery you you all know the
[1:45:30] story and they drag her before Jesus
[1:45:33] they're actually dragging her before the
[1:45:35] lawgiver that came down on Mount Si
[1:45:38] they're actually dragging her before the
[1:45:39] Lord Giver so now he and and he he is
[1:45:42] supreme judge of heavens and earth they
[1:45:45] bring her to the highest court there
[1:45:47] is and they're expecting him to condemn
[1:45:50] the woman amen but then he says you know
[1:45:55] he begins to ride on the sand and all
[1:45:57] these things he says him that was is
[1:46:00] without sin Let Him cast the first stone
[1:46:03] amen and they all from the oldest to the
[1:46:04] youngest they drop their stones and they
[1:46:06] walk away and then he begins to say
[1:46:08] woman where are you accuses and she says
[1:46:10] Lord I have none was more than a prophet
[1:46:13] From Galilee or some some different guy
[1:46:15] Lord God God I have none neither do I
[1:46:18] condemn the go and sin no more so the
[1:46:21] judge now a amen the judge deemed her
[1:46:25] righteous amen the judge pardoned her of
[1:46:28] what she had done amen and so now the
[1:46:31] Supreme judge that's why you know
[1:46:33] brother Ram says about you know what is
[1:46:35] the attraction on the mountain you know
[1:46:37] when when the when the cloud is formed
[1:46:39] there over sunset Mountain he says
[1:46:41] that's our Lord up there and he says
[1:46:43] it's a supreme
[1:46:45] judge amen amen and the reason that all
[1:46:48] happened now is that God was showing he
[1:46:51] was showing he Jesus Christ is a supreme
[1:46:54] judge and a judge doesn't always just
[1:46:56] condemn people but he pardons people
[1:46:59] amen and then and then brother Brown
[1:47:01] tells us now you know imagine going into
[1:47:03] a court and and and you know you're
[1:47:05] guilty and you get the best lawyer you
[1:47:06] could and all these things and maybe he
[1:47:08] could you know get you off the case but
[1:47:10] there's still a question they says but
[1:47:12] when your when when when the judge
[1:47:14] became your attorney be you know became
[1:47:17] your lawyer the case is settled and it's
[1:47:18] thrown out and he said it's the same
[1:47:21] thing now with our lord Jesus the
[1:47:22] Supreme judge amen became our lawyer
[1:47:25] became our attorney Hallelujah and you
[1:47:28] know and the case is dismissed amen
[1:47:31] hallelujah that's why he is the judge of
[1:47:33] all amen cuz his judge is righteous amen
[1:47:36] his judge is perfect amen hallelujah and
[1:47:39] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[1:47:42] notice it doesn't say that the Flesh of
[1:47:44] just men made perfect it speaks of their
[1:47:46] Spirits yes I mean speaks of their real
[1:47:49] you know their real them because in the
[1:47:51] Bible Soul and Spirit the words
[1:47:53] interchangeable amen so he's saying and
[1:47:56] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[1:47:59] that's right so he's saying now you've
[1:48:01] come to this place and this is the
[1:48:03] condition of the people in this place
[1:48:05] amen he's saying they've been made
[1:48:07] perfect remember because the blood of
[1:48:10] Jesus Christ makes us perfect yes amen
[1:48:14] sinless sinlessly perfect glory amen so
[1:48:18] you know sure we got to mature and grow
[1:48:21] but we're sinlessly perfect I'm as
[1:48:24] righteous as God is righteous amen amen
[1:48:27] cuz I'm in him yes amen and to Jesus the
[1:48:30] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[1:48:33] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[1:48:35] things than that of Abel amen now the
[1:48:38] reason we can say we have come to this
[1:48:39] place is because now I'm I'm
[1:48:43] probably you know um we understand the
[1:48:46] high priest remember we we've just had
[1:48:48] the day of atonement y kapo yes and the
[1:48:52] high priest you know had an an
[1:48:54] incredible function because without the
[1:48:57] high priest there's no forgiveness of
[1:48:59] sins you could have the Tabernacle you
[1:49:02] could have the sacrifice you could have
[1:49:03] the Levites but without the high
[1:49:06] priest amen the high priest has a
[1:49:09] supreme authority there amen and without
[1:49:12] that man amen there's no forgiveness of
[1:49:15] sins for the people amen and then now in
[1:49:19] the Old Testament there was the temple
[1:49:21] or the Tabernacle there there was the
[1:49:23] high priest and there was the blood were
[1:49:24] three separate things and then Jesus
[1:49:27] comes along and he's a high priest made
[1:49:29] after the order of mesc which means an
[1:49:30] eternal one amen and then he is the high
[1:49:34] priest this in the days of his flesh yes
[1:49:36] he is the high priest in him is the
[1:49:38] blood that's right amen and he's also
[1:49:40] the temple yes amen amen so he comes
[1:49:44] along now and they tell him what
[1:49:46] marvelous stones are these you know the
[1:49:48] temple and all these things he says in 3
[1:49:50] days you know you know he said not one
[1:49:51] stone will be left upon another speaking
[1:49:53] of the you know the destruction of the
[1:49:54] temple this is all going to be done away
[1:49:56] with that's right and he was the real
[1:49:57] high priest standing with them with the
[1:50:00] blood amen that wasn't just going to
[1:50:02] offer it once a year but was going to
[1:50:03] offer it you know once and for all was
[1:50:05] going to perfect them which are
[1:50:06] Sanctified and then so now remember when
[1:50:10] when the high priest came out alive
[1:50:12] after giving the blood before the mercy
[1:50:14] seat then the people could Rejoice
[1:50:17] because their sins were
[1:50:18] forgiven so it's when the high priest
[1:50:21] reappeared it wasn't he went in but when
[1:50:23] he reappeared yes was the great moment
[1:50:26] amen amen so now we've had 2,000 years
[1:50:30] you know remember Jesus arose Mary saw
[1:50:33] him in the garden she says yeah he says
[1:50:35] don't touch me cuz I haven't ascended I
[1:50:37] haven't taken my blood up into the
[1:50:39] presence of God yet and then he came
[1:50:41] back down he say to Thomas touch the you
[1:50:43] know touch the holes and you know these
[1:50:45] things he said touch me now amen yes and
[1:50:49] remember he's our high priest so and
[1:50:52] then after that he he ascended up into
[1:50:53] heaven he sent down his holy spirit we
[1:50:56] had 2,000 odd years of the same way
[1:50:58] where the high priest has not revealed
[1:51:01] himself amenu but then in these last
[1:51:04] days he said the son of man would be
[1:51:06] revealed amen the high priest would be
[1:51:08] revealed and then you have a Ministry
[1:51:11] standing upon the Earth where he says
[1:51:13] you know he goes back to you know Sarah
[1:51:15] and God you know you know God visits
[1:51:17] Abraham in Genesis 18 and he says now
[1:51:20] you know Sarah was in the tent you know
[1:51:22] you know behind them amen he says now I
[1:51:25] now I'll turn my back amen and there's a
[1:51:27] woman standing on the platform here
[1:51:29] that's right and and he does these
[1:51:31] things over and over again CU he's
[1:51:32] showing now the same God that was there
[1:51:35] that became Jesus Christ in flesh has
[1:51:38] now reappeared again in these last days
[1:51:41] amen so he turns his back says now I'll
[1:51:42] turn my back and tells the people this
[1:51:44] is what's wrong with them here and this
[1:51:45] is your name and all these things who is
[1:51:47] it say Jesus Christ revealing himself
[1:51:50] it's the high priest it is the high
[1:51:53] priest revealing himself so what happens
[1:51:55] now is the high priest has come out
[1:51:57] again Amen to declare yes amen the
[1:52:01] atonement has been accepted Hallelujah
[1:52:04] your sins have been forgiven you amen
[1:52:06] you're as perfect as I and I am perfect
[1:52:10] remember without the high priest amen
[1:52:12] and this to me transcends the argument
[1:52:14] which church is Right which church has
[1:52:17] the high
[1:52:18] priest which church which I'm not
[1:52:21] talking about I'm talking about
[1:52:21] believers
[1:52:23] amen you take any denomination which one
[1:52:25] has the high priest declaring
[1:52:28] itself amen you say well that was 50
[1:52:31] years ago uhuh amen that's right that
[1:52:34] same one is still alive with us well how
[1:52:36] do you know who's pass from Death To
[1:52:38] Life who's been quickened who sees this
[1:52:41] begin to express itself more and more
[1:52:43] every day who's been
[1:52:45] delivered amen who has a new life that's
[1:52:47] com to them it's not them trying to live
[1:52:49] it but it lives out of youall that is
[1:52:52] that you have the high priest hallelujah
[1:52:55] hallelujah hallelujah cuz remember if
[1:52:57] you have the high priest you have the
[1:52:59] blood amen if you don't have the high
[1:53:02] priest you don't have the blood amen
[1:53:04] hallelujah amen amen that's why it says
[1:53:07] we've
[1:53:08] come Amen to the blood amen amen to
[1:53:12] Jesus now so he's saying now this is
[1:53:15] where you've come and this is where we
[1:53:17] are yes amen we're not at the bottom of
[1:53:19] Mount Zion we've come to the top we've
[1:53:21] come to the fin in amen we've come we
[1:53:24] can say we have the high priest cuz
[1:53:27] we've seen him appear in these last
[1:53:30] days amen hallelujah and that to me
[1:53:33] changes everything yes amen because if
[1:53:35] you high have the high priest you have
[1:53:36] the blood if you have the blood you have
[1:53:38] forgiveness of sins amen amen if you
[1:53:40] have forgiveness of sins you're going in
[1:53:41] a Rapture Hallelujah Jes amen now why do

[1:53:45] John chapter 5 and we'll just read it
[1:53:47] together and I'll try and close on this
[1:53:49] remark
