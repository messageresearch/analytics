[10:16] we have a little problem that we call an
[10:18] air gap
[10:21] when we diagnose a problem when
[10:22] something's not working we diagnose we
[10:24] say oh it looks like you have an air gap
[10:26] here
[10:27] you know that means it means it's not
[10:29] plugged in
[10:30] so there's something that's not plugged
[10:31] into something else and there's an ear
[10:32] gap
[10:35] this was just a mute it's what this
[10:36] wasn't an ear gap though
[10:41] i mean so um it's good to be here this
[10:42] morning to have an opportunity to
[10:45] worship the lord to be with saints
[10:48] [Music]
[10:49] of like precious faith and souls that
[10:52] [Music]
[10:54] have a special
[10:55] [Music]
[10:58] that are special in the mind of god
[11:02] that have been sitting in his mind for a
[11:04] very very long time
[11:06] since before the world began each one of
[11:09] us were
[11:10] in the mind of god that's what we
[11:12] believe and that's what we
[11:14] that's why we're here this morning
[11:16] because we are his desire expressed he
[11:18] wanted
[11:19] he he saw us he's got a desire for us

[11:32] journeys that we've all taken in our
[11:34] life it hasn't been just an accident
[11:36] even the things and the decisions that

[11:51] certain things to unfold and things to
[11:52] happen a certain way
[11:53] you know we're led by the lord all the
[11:55] time and we don't even realize that
[11:57] the different things and the decisions
[11:58] we make so we thank god that that's the
[12:01] god that we serve

[56:31] what brother james preached on sunday i
[56:33] mean on

[56:36] but the other
[56:38] power the spoken word and um yeah
[56:42] i mean so we're in acts one and six
[56:46] he says then they therefore
[56:49] will come together they asked him saying
[56:51] lord
[56:52] will thou this time restore again the
[56:54] kingdom of israel
[56:55] and he said unto them it is not for you
[56:58] to know the times
[57:00] nor the seasons which the father has put
[57:02] in his own power
[57:03] but ye shall receive power after that
[57:06] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[57:08] shall be witnesses
[57:09] unto me both in jerusalem and in all
[57:12] judea
[57:12] and in samaria and the uttermost parts
[57:15] of the earth now
[57:16] that word power in the greek is dunamis
[57:19] which where we get the word dynamite
[57:21] from
[57:21] you're going to receive this kind of
[57:23] power hallelujah
[57:25] and um then we're going to go to first
[57:27] john i was actually reading this
[57:28] scripture here when
[57:29] um in the service on wednesday before
[57:31] brother james started preaching and
[57:33] um verse 20 stood out to me what was
[57:36] going to read from verse 18 says little
[57:38] children it is the last time
[57:41] and as ye have heard that antichrist
[57:43] shall come
[57:44] even now are there many antichrists
[57:47] whereby we know that we are
[57:49] we know sorry that it is the last time
[57:52] they went out from us but they were not
[57:54] of us
[57:54] for if they had been of us they would
[57:56] have no doubt have continued with us
[57:58] but they went out that they might be
[58:01] made manifest that they are not of us
[58:03] but ye have an unction from the holy one
[58:06] and you know all things i have not
[58:08] written unto you because you know
[58:10] not the truth but because you know it
[58:12] and that no lie
[58:14] is of the truth amen may the lord bless
[58:16] the reading of his word you may have
[58:18] your cease this morning and i want to
[58:20] if i could title us i want to speak
[58:22] about being anointed to speak
[58:24] we're living in a day where there's many
[58:25] spirits around the world and they're
[58:28] and they're speaking forth you see it in
[58:30] the political realm you said in the
[58:31] social realm there's a lot of spirits
[58:33] they're speaking a lot of words but
[58:35] there's also a time for the bride of
[58:37] christ to speak now
[58:38] this word as uh this word ancient here
[58:41] in verse 20 it's a
[58:42] it's a it's it's a compound word it's an
[58:44] unusual kind of word with
[58:46] not one that we use much these days it
[58:48] says but you have an ancient from the
[58:49] holy one and you know all things now
[58:51] the word unction it means and it's it's
[58:54] an
[58:55] an action of it anointing someone with
[58:57] an oil or an ointment
[58:59] but it's also a fervent manner of
[59:01] expression
[59:02] apparently arising from deep emotions so
[59:04] these are you know so
[59:05] so so so it's a compound word where
[59:07] there's an anointing that's involved but
[59:09] there's actually a voice that goes forth
[59:10] because of that anointing
[59:12] and i say that we have an unction amen
[59:14] it's not just you know
[59:15] christianity's not just people working
[59:17] out how to follow god but god comes down
[59:19] lives in those people's lives
[59:21] and his word puts on flesh in their
[59:22] lives so you know
[59:24] today we live in a day where where the
[59:26] bride is anointed to speak and we're not
[59:28] here to
[59:29] speak our own words and our own thoughts
[59:31] but we're here to speak
[59:32] god is actually here to speak his word
[59:34] and his thoughts but
[59:35] he has no other lips but your lips he
[59:37] has no other voice but your voice amen
[59:40] you know we know we have the bible but
[59:42] you know that this bible that's in
[59:44] printful must put on flesh and you and i
[59:46] and it must be lived you know as the
[59:47] prophet said that what jeffersonville
[59:49] needs tonight and i'll say what
[59:51] wellington needs this morning is
[59:52] thousands of lived voices i mean was not
[59:55] just speaking about a god that lived 2
[59:57] 000 years ago but that same god lives in
[59:59] you and i
[1:00:00] and our voice becomes i mean our life
[1:00:02] becomes a lived voice
[1:00:03] hallelujah where god himself lives now
[1:00:06] we've been in jude
[1:00:07] with power from on high as as jesus
[1:00:11] would say in luke 12
[1:00:12] you know you shall be i mean sorry this
[1:00:14] is this is the latter part of luke
[1:00:15] but then yo brother james brought out
[1:00:18] the scripture that you shall um
[1:00:20] you know don't think of what to say you
[1:00:22] shall take no thought of how or the
[1:00:24] thing you shall answer or what you shall
[1:00:26] say
[1:00:26] for the holy ghost shall teach you in
[1:00:28] the same hour what you ought to say so
[1:00:30] it's not going to be you speaking
[1:00:31] when the pressure comes on it's not
[1:00:33] going to be you that's going to be
[1:00:34] responding it's going to be the god in
[1:00:36] you that's going to be doing the
[1:00:37] responding
[1:00:38] he's the one that's going to be doing
[1:00:39] the speaking hallelujah but you know it
[1:00:41] really
[1:00:42] comes from what's within you know the
[1:00:43] scripture tells us in in proverbs 18
[1:00:46] a man's belly shall be satisfied with
[1:00:48] the fruit of his mouth and with the
[1:00:50] increase of his lips shall he be filled
[1:00:52] death and life from the power of the
[1:00:54] tongue and they that love
[1:00:56] it shall eat the fruit thereof so you
[1:00:58] know there's a lot of power in this
[1:00:59] little member here
[1:01:00] you can speak death or you can speak
[1:01:03] life
[1:01:03] you can speak victory or you can speak
[1:01:06] defeat it all depends what you are led
[1:01:08] to
[1:01:08] to to speak hallelujah now this now
[1:01:11] this is not the power of positive
[1:01:13] speaking this is not mind over matter
[1:01:16] but the apostles did not apply mind over
[1:01:18] matter to overcome the
[1:01:20] challenges of their day they did not use
[1:01:22] mind over matter to overcome the scribes
[1:01:24] and the pharisees and all the religious
[1:01:25] pressure they had and everything no
[1:01:27] it was god anointing them to speak amen
[1:01:30] but if they confess
[1:01:31] if you confess if you have a negative
[1:01:33] testimony your life will become negative
[1:01:35] because there's power in your words i
[1:01:37] mean there's power everyone has power in
[1:01:39] their words
[1:01:40] right we you know you can see it even if
[1:01:41] you can look at old footage of
[1:01:43] if you look at war documentaries you
[1:01:45] know hitler would release a word
[1:01:47] and it transformed the world in a bad
[1:01:49] way it led to a global war
[1:01:51] but he was anointed there was power in
[1:01:53] his words he's just there's just a demon
[1:01:55] power anointing a man
[1:01:56] and he did what he did we know it's it
[1:01:58] was in scripture it was fulfilled but
[1:02:00] those words had power it stirred up a
[1:02:02] people
[1:02:03] and if that kind of if a fallen spirit a
[1:02:06] demon power could anoint a man to speak
[1:02:08] in such a way and stir up a people
[1:02:10] how much more god himself anointing a
[1:02:13] people
[1:02:13] releasing a word upon the bride of
[1:02:15] christ and stir them up how much more
[1:02:17] that in the positive side
[1:02:19] hallelujah and we know that this message
[1:02:21] we have received has power in it
[1:02:23] hallelujah amen
[1:02:27] now jesus would say for a good tree
[1:02:29] bringeth forth
[1:02:30] uh not corrupt fruit neither does a crop
[1:02:33] tree bring forth
[1:02:34] good fruit for every tree is known by
[1:02:36] his own fruit four of thorns men do not
[1:02:38] gather figs
[1:02:39] nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes
[1:02:42] a good man out of the good treasure of
[1:02:44] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[1:02:46] good
[1:02:47] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[1:02:49] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[1:02:51] is evil
[1:02:52] for of the abundance of the heart his
[1:02:54] mouth speaketh so
[1:02:56] it's really what we harden our hearts is
[1:02:58] what we value
[1:02:59] that's the treasure it's either a good
[1:03:01] treasure or an evil treasure but it's a
[1:03:03] treasure
[1:03:03] it depends on the value you put upon it
[1:03:05] you know if something is evil and you
[1:03:07] see it as evil you're not going to store
[1:03:08] it in your heart you want to shun that
[1:03:10] thing
[1:03:11] but if you view it as good don't be evil
[1:03:13] you're going to store it in your heart
[1:03:14] but whatever's in your heart is going to
[1:03:16] be so spoken forth
[1:03:17] you can't help but speak of the things
[1:03:19] that's in you
[1:03:21] now this word abundance it means a
[1:03:24] surplus
[1:03:24] or a super abundance it is that which is
[1:03:27] left over
[1:03:29] that which is left over and above so
[1:03:32] it's actually abundance is greater than
[1:03:33] the allotted portion that you need
[1:03:36] are we together here i mean so and and
[1:03:38] it's also
[1:03:39] an abundance is is in which one delights
[1:03:42] and of that which fills the heart so
[1:03:45] then it fills it but also overflows
[1:03:47] that's the abundance has got to go
[1:03:48] somewhere you know you pour water or
[1:03:50] somewhere you know just like you take uh
[1:03:52] you know the hot river if you keep
[1:03:54] filling up the hot river it's going to
[1:03:55] flow somewhere
[1:03:56] it'll either go out to see it or burst
[1:03:58] the banks it's got to go because there's
[1:03:59] a
[1:04:00] abundance of water in the river it's the
[1:04:02] same thing with you and i there should
[1:04:03] be an abundance
[1:04:05] of the spirit of god of the word of god
[1:04:06] in our lives
[1:04:08] hallelujah that should just be flowing
[1:04:10] all over the place
[1:04:12] amen amen now we've been commissioned in
[1:04:15] this day
[1:04:16] we know that the seventh angel has come
[1:04:18] the message has come the book the bible
[1:04:20] has come open we have
[1:04:21] you know you know the mysteries have
[1:04:22] been revealed but that wasn't the end of
[1:04:24] the prophecy
[1:04:25] for for we know uh yes in revelations 10
[1:04:29] now and the voice which i heard from
[1:04:30] from heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:04:32] go take the little book which is open on
[1:04:34] the hand of the angel
[1:04:35] which standeth upon the scene upon the
[1:04:37] earth and i went unto the angel and said
[1:04:39] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:04:41] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[1:04:43] it shall
[1:04:43] make thy belly bitter why because the
[1:04:46] word's got to purge out everything that
[1:04:47] that you know that's contrary to it
[1:04:49] but it shall be in my mouth sweet as
[1:04:51] honey it's
[1:04:52] it's very sweet to speak about the
[1:04:54] goodness of god and you know his plan of
[1:04:55] redemption what he's done for you and i
[1:04:57] it's very sweet
[1:04:58] but when the word cuts and you know the
[1:04:59] lord says you've got to you've got to
[1:05:00] surrender that to me you've got to give
[1:05:02] up your pride give up your self ability
[1:05:04] give up trying to be a big shock give up
[1:05:05] you know your unforgiveness resentment
[1:05:07] gossip you got to give that all up
[1:05:09] that's when the belly gets better
[1:05:10] because it's going to be a purging
[1:05:12] hallelujah and i took the little book
[1:05:15] out of the angel's hand and ate it up
[1:05:17] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:05:19] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[1:05:21] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:05:24] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:05:26] nations and tongues
[1:05:27] and kings now we know historically
[1:05:30] speaking after
[1:05:32] after john received the series of
[1:05:34] revelations which we call the book of
[1:05:36] revelation on the isle of patmos
[1:05:38] he went back to the um he went back to
[1:05:40] ephesus and he pastored the church and
[1:05:41] then he passed on he was the only
[1:05:43] apostle to die a natural death all the
[1:05:45] others were martyred
[1:05:46] so you know he didn't fulfill this in
[1:05:48] his in
[1:05:49] in in his own humanity to prophesy
[1:05:51] before many people's nations tongues and
[1:05:53] kings
[1:05:54] and we also know the book of revelation
[1:05:56] that john
[1:05:57] you know you know the book of revelation
[1:05:59] being a book of symbols being a book of
[1:06:00] prophecy
[1:06:01] is that john himself is a symbol in the
[1:06:03] book right he is actually a
[1:06:05] representation of something
[1:06:07] and we know from from reading the end of
[1:06:10] revelations 3 which is the end of the
[1:06:11] church ages to revelations 4
[1:06:13] 1 what happens you know in revelations 4
[1:06:16] 1
[1:06:17] as john says i heard a voice the same
[1:06:19] voice up in heaven there's an open door
[1:06:20] in heaven said come up hither
[1:06:22] i'll show you things that come so that
[1:06:23] he was actually taken from this
[1:06:24] dimension
[1:06:25] into the heavenly realm hallelujah so
[1:06:27] what does that represent
[1:06:29] that represents the rapture of the bride
[1:06:31] of christ at the end of the seventh age
[1:06:33] hallelujah so one man and a vision
[1:06:35] represents a whole body of people
[1:06:37] amen so so here he is he's commanded to
[1:06:40] take this little book and eat it up
[1:06:42] and then prophesy again it's actually
[1:06:45] you are actually
[1:06:46] this is a symbol of you in the book
[1:06:48] right the bride of christ
[1:06:49] amen you have to become one with the
[1:06:51] word and then you must speak it forth
[1:06:53] again
[1:06:53] hallelujah so now because we know to
[1:06:56] prophesy
[1:06:58] it means to speak under it's yeah it
[1:07:00] means to foretell events
[1:07:02] to speak under inspiration or to
[1:07:04] exercise the prophetic office
[1:07:07] so it speaks of speaking under
[1:07:09] inspiration now
[1:07:10] i just want to put this all on our own
[1:07:12] lap because many people say oh you've
[1:07:13] got to prophesy again you have to be a
[1:07:15] prophet no
[1:07:16] just to speak under inspiration amen
[1:07:18] that is prophesying again
[1:07:21] so you can be led by the holy ghost to
[1:07:23] speak something under inspiration that
[1:07:24] can change someone's life
[1:07:26] amen that you can speak saying to your
[1:07:27] children wisdom whatever be and it'll
[1:07:29] end
[1:07:29] you know undo whatever the devil is
[1:07:31] trying to do in their lives or or your
[1:07:32] brother and sister whoever it might be
[1:07:34] you can be inspired who believes in
[1:07:35] being inspired
[1:07:36] shouldn't our lives be inspired i mean
[1:07:38] we're not here just to go through a
[1:07:40] motion of a human ability but our lives
[1:07:42] should be inspired by god
[1:07:43] amen how we raise our children should be
[1:07:45] inspired by the word how we treat our
[1:07:47] spouses should be inspired by the word
[1:07:49] how we treat one another should be
[1:07:51] inspired by the word how we treat those
[1:07:53] in the world we want to see saved
[1:07:54] inspired by the word we should be living
[1:07:57] under inspiration how we do our jobs
[1:07:59] everything we do in life should be
[1:08:00] inspired by the word of god
[1:08:02] amen should be under inspiration we
[1:08:05] should be living
[1:08:06] under an influence hey the world is
[1:08:09] under an influence we should be under an
[1:08:10] influence but our influence should be a
[1:08:12] heavily influenced
[1:08:14] amen now jesus would say here
[1:08:19] many therefore if his disciples when i
[1:08:21] heard this said this is a hard saying
[1:08:23] who can hear it
[1:08:24] when jesus knew in himself that his
[1:08:26] disciples murmured it he said unto them
[1:08:28] does this offend you what and if ye
[1:08:30] shall see the son of man ascend up to
[1:08:32] where he was before
[1:08:34] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:08:36] flesh profiteth nothing the words that i
[1:08:38] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[1:08:40] are life
[1:08:41] so the words that jesus was speaking
[1:08:44] carried a spirit
[1:08:45] and they were and it was the spirit of
[1:08:47] god that was being carried in those
[1:08:49] words
[1:08:50] he would say to the scribes and
[1:08:51] pharisees later he said you can't hear
[1:08:53] my word because you have no place in you
[1:08:55] for my word
[1:08:56] so there has to be a betting ground in a
[1:08:58] person's soul
[1:08:59] that they can receive the word of god as
[1:09:02] as as the scripture says to him that
[1:09:04] have an heir let him hear what the
[1:09:05] spirit says to the church so
[1:09:07] you know the people who are ordained to
[1:09:09] eternal life are actually built to hear
[1:09:11] the word of god
[1:09:12] not just in their ears but in their in
[1:09:14] their hearts if i put it that way
[1:09:15] i mean so so the words that he speaks
[1:09:18] now
[1:09:19] as he says now i'm probably running a
[1:09:20] lot of things together but you know when
[1:09:22] god says something it's not just going
[1:09:24] to fall to the ground and nothing's
[1:09:25] going to happen
[1:09:26] he says in the scripture my word shall
[1:09:28] not return unto me void
[1:09:30] but it will produce that which i sent it
[1:09:32] to do i mean so so
[1:09:34] what he sent it to do it will produce it
[1:09:36] so when he said in the beginning let
[1:09:37] there be the sun moon and the stars
[1:09:39] he didn't get a watermelon that may be a
[1:09:42] ridiculous
[1:09:43] illustration but he got sun moon and
[1:09:44] stars what he got in his mind and what
[1:09:47] he spoke forth
[1:09:48] was produced exactly what he wanted it
[1:09:50] to be
[1:09:51] it means it's the same thing with his
[1:09:53] word now what he speaks
[1:09:56] it will produce it so if he said he's
[1:09:58] going to have a bride without spiral
[1:10:00] wrinkle
[1:10:01] made in his image she's going to be
[1:10:03] there i mean there's going to be a
[1:10:05] people upon the earth that are made in
[1:10:06] his image
[1:10:07] i mean because they have a they have a
[1:10:09] place to receive his word
[1:10:12] hallelujah but now when you receive the
[1:10:14] word of the lord
[1:10:15] it doesn't just sit there dormant it
[1:10:18] actually puts on flesh
[1:10:20] hallelujah in our character and what we
[1:10:22] do i say lord help us when i say our
[1:10:24] character lord keep changing me
[1:10:26] to be more like you every day but it
[1:10:28] should also be it comes into us you
[1:10:30] could say
[1:10:30] to be spoken forth hallelujah when
[1:10:33] you know when moses let's just let's
[1:10:36] just jump down to this
[1:10:38] when moses was there
[1:10:41] in egypt and he met the burning bush
[1:10:45] everything he lacked of was in that
[1:10:47] burning bush everything here
[1:10:49] he lacked he knew he was called to
[1:10:50] deliver the people of israel
[1:10:52] but he couldn't do it in his own ability
[1:10:54] he miserably failed
[1:10:56] but then when he met the pillar of fire
[1:10:57] in the burning bush he received what he
[1:10:59] needed
[1:11:01] amen to to he he actually became
[1:11:03] anointed to speak
[1:11:04] now you think about you think about uh
[1:11:07] moses for a second
[1:11:08] it's amazing how god will take a people
[1:11:12] that are born in sin shaped an iniquity
[1:11:14] come to the world speaking lies that's
[1:11:16] just putting a few scriptures together
[1:11:18] they're actually under the influence of
[1:11:19] the devil because the bible says in
[1:11:22] ephesians 2 we
[1:11:23] all walked according to the prince of
[1:11:24] the power of the earth our lives were
[1:11:26] all
[1:11:26] led by him but then god rich in mercy
[1:11:29] quickness made us alive by his spirit
[1:11:31] and now we're in a new kingdom but you
[1:11:33] know but that's amazing how god will
[1:11:35] take a people that are born
[1:11:37] lost and and once upon a time our lives
[1:11:40] spoke cursing
[1:11:41] our lives actually glorified the devil
[1:11:44] whether you were aware of it or not the
[1:11:46] things we did the things we thought
[1:11:48] about the things you know the things we
[1:11:49] gave our lives to we're actually giving
[1:11:51] glory to satan
[1:11:53] maybe i'll just speak for myself for a
[1:11:54] bit that was my old life
[1:11:56] i gave glory to him the things i spoke
[1:11:58] about the things i did i was actually
[1:12:00] worshiping
[1:12:01] demon power right but then god would
[1:12:03] take a sinner such as i
[1:12:05] he would wash us in the blood transform
[1:12:07] us change our nature
[1:12:09] i mean that that same mouth now that was
[1:12:11] once once
[1:12:12] once made or inspired to speak cursing
[1:12:14] now speaks blessing
[1:12:16] it was once speaking death it now speaks
[1:12:18] life
[1:12:19] hallelujah why because you're anointed
[1:12:21] to speak one way but then another
[1:12:22] anointing came now we speak another way
[1:12:25] hallelujah so so here is moses now moses
[1:12:28] was made
[1:12:30] to be the deliverer of israel but he was
[1:12:33] raised in pharaoh's house
[1:12:35] and he was and and pharaoh had an
[1:12:38] ambition in his mind
[1:12:39] for moses that moses was there to
[1:12:41] further his kingdom
[1:12:43] just like the devil has an ambition for
[1:12:45] your your lives
[1:12:46] that you're going to further his kingdom
[1:12:48] in some some degree
[1:12:50] but god has other plans god had other
[1:12:52] plans for moses
[1:12:54] i mean so moses was built you think
[1:12:55] about it he was raised in pharaoh's
[1:12:57] palace
[1:12:58] he could have been the next pharaoh he
[1:13:00] would afford him wars he had been a
[1:13:01] mighty general because the
[1:13:03] royalty in those days led the armies so
[1:13:06] he was groomed he was
[1:13:07] trained he was molded to further uh
[1:13:10] you know the kingdom of egypt but then
[1:13:12] when he met the pillar of fire in the
[1:13:14] burning bush
[1:13:14] that same one that was there furthering
[1:13:16] the kingdom of egypt went back into
[1:13:18] egypt and he tore egypt down
[1:13:20] i mean that god's children would go free
[1:13:23] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[1:13:24] and i
[1:13:25] i mean we are here to tear satan's
[1:13:26] kingdom down now i'm not talking about
[1:13:29] physically overthrowing governments
[1:13:31] that's not what i'm talking about i'm
[1:13:32] talking about where where the children
[1:13:34] of god are inspired by god
[1:13:36] and they speak a word to a people where
[1:13:38] once a person had had the devil on the
[1:13:40] throne of their heart right was ruling
[1:13:42] but then that devil gets thrown off
[1:13:45] that kingdom of satan gets cast out and
[1:13:47] the kingdom of heaven gets established
[1:13:49] in the heart of people hallelujah isn't
[1:13:52] that our job
[1:13:53] go into all the world and preach the
[1:13:55] gospel wherever you find the devil cast
[1:13:57] them out
[1:13:58] hallelujah amen
[1:14:01] that's our job well i'm not a preacher
[1:14:04] no your life can do the same thing
[1:14:06] remember it's not just it's not just
[1:14:08] song leaders it's not just ministers
[1:14:10] that do these things all of us are
[1:14:11] commissioned to do it
[1:14:13] jesus says in mark 16 these signs shall
[1:14:15] follow them that believe who's a
[1:14:17] believer today
[1:14:19] hallelujah those signs should be
[1:14:21] following your life
[1:14:23] amen amen even
[1:14:27] even paul would speak in first
[1:14:29] corinthians 6 or i don't have a
[1:14:30] way to blank that know you not that the
[1:14:32] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:14:34] kingdom of god be not deceived neither
[1:14:36] fornicators nor idolaters nor
[1:14:37] adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of
[1:14:40] themselves with mankind nor thieves
[1:14:42] nor covetous nor drunkards nor revelers
[1:14:44] nor extortion shall inherit the kingdom
[1:14:46] of god
[1:14:47] and such were some of you but ye are
[1:14:50] washed who's washed today
[1:14:53] but ye are sanctified but yeah justified
[1:14:55] in the name of the lord jesus
[1:14:57] and by the spirit of our god so that you
[1:14:58] know that's quite a listening list of
[1:15:00] people who want to
[1:15:01] want to hear it but he says you were
[1:15:03] like that once upon him some were such
[1:15:04] as you
[1:15:05] but you've been sanctified you've been
[1:15:07] washed i mean you've been justified by
[1:15:09] the by the lord jesus and by the spirit
[1:15:11] of our god
[1:15:13] hallelujah amen i'm so glad he does the
[1:15:16] work
[1:15:17] amen hallelujah now
[1:15:21] we'll read this and this is the way this
[1:15:22] is from here ye him and this is the way
[1:15:24] it is this afternoon
[1:15:26] if our nature becomes converted from the
[1:15:28] things of the world to the nature of the
[1:15:29] holy spirit
[1:15:31] god will take his stand he will abide on
[1:15:33] us inspired believers taking in the
[1:15:35] inspired word
[1:15:36] those two together brings the results
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:40] it brings the word to life the
[1:15:41] inspiration that's on your heart puts
[1:15:43] the word to living
[1:15:45] why because he's changed our nature to
[1:15:47] agree with his nature
[1:15:48] i mean once upon a time our nature was
[1:15:50] opposite we were once his enemies
[1:15:52] the scripture tells us but he does such
[1:15:54] a work by the power of the blood you
[1:15:56] know
[1:15:56] i probably say it every sunday but i
[1:15:58] love to talk about what the cross does
[1:16:00] not just talk about the cross but what
[1:16:02] was it seen to do i mean
[1:16:04] jesus died that he would he would
[1:16:05] cleanse the people of their sins and he
[1:16:07] would transform them
[1:16:08] live in them i mean that that they would
[1:16:10] be living
[1:16:11] temples of the living god hello there's
[1:16:14] no longer them the apostle paul would
[1:16:15] say it's no longer i that liveth but
[1:16:17] christ that liveth in me
[1:16:18] hallelujah so the actions of paul was
[1:16:20] not the actions of paul it was actions
[1:16:22] of the holy ghost and paul
[1:16:25] hallelujah amen
[1:16:28] peter would say knowing this first that
[1:16:30] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:16:32] private interpretation now
[1:16:34] why is this for the prophecy came not an
[1:16:36] old time by the will of
[1:16:38] man but holy men of god spake as they
[1:16:40] were moved by the holy ghost this is why
[1:16:43] it's not a private interpretation
[1:16:44] because
[1:16:45] moses interpretation wasn't his
[1:16:47] interpretation that was god's
[1:16:48] interpretation
[1:16:49] because the lord said now give them
[1:16:51] these laws thus saith the lord you shall
[1:16:52] do this and this and this
[1:16:54] it wasn't moses saying this is how it
[1:16:55] should be this is god saying how it
[1:16:57] should be
[1:16:58] just like paul when he would write or
[1:16:59] any of the prophets it wasn't their
[1:17:01] thoughts and their
[1:17:02] you know their way of well i better
[1:17:03] write this to them and they're going to
[1:17:05] hear this no it was god inspiring they
[1:17:06] were moved
[1:17:08] hallelujah by the holy ghost so it
[1:17:10] wasn't the yeah it wasn't their will
[1:17:12] that brought the word it was god's will
[1:17:14] that brought the word
[1:17:16] hallelujah and i believe our lives
[1:17:18] should be moved as well
[1:17:20] i mean the word should come through us i
[1:17:23] mean the words you put on flesh through
[1:17:25] us because we're moved by the holy ghost
[1:17:27] hallelujah amen all scripture is given i
[1:17:31] know this is probably fundamental but
[1:17:33] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:17:35] god and is profitable for doctrine for
[1:17:37] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:17:39] and righteousness
[1:17:40] that the man of god may be perfect
[1:17:42] thoroughly furnished
[1:17:43] unto all good works now this word
[1:17:46] inspiration
[1:17:47] it actually means about uh uh you know
[1:17:49] from the greek to be divinely breathed
[1:17:51] in
[1:17:53] holy so so to be inspired you've
[1:17:55] received something
[1:17:56] there's been actually the breath of god
[1:17:58] has breathed over your life the word of
[1:18:00] god has been breathed into you
[1:18:02] hallelujah that's why well i'm inspired
[1:18:05] what
[1:18:05] something's been divinely breathed in
[1:18:07] and not speaking out
[1:18:10] hallelujah
[1:18:15] now you know jesus said all things are
[1:18:19] possible to them that believe
[1:18:22] remember we're anointed to speak we
[1:18:23] can't limit god
[1:18:25] yeah we know with god all things are
[1:18:26] possible and everyone says amen
[1:18:28] absolutely
[1:18:29] but jesus challenged us and said but if
[1:18:32] thou cannest believe
[1:18:33] all things are possible to him that
[1:18:35] believeth now here is a man with his
[1:18:38] child this is this is the background of
[1:18:39] the story here's a man with a child that
[1:18:41] had epilepsy
[1:18:42] and he had taken him to the apostles but
[1:18:44] the apostles couldn't cast him out and
[1:18:46] you know and then and then and then
[1:18:47] jesus comes down and and this is the
[1:18:50] scene that jesus comes into
[1:18:52] and then you know this man says but if
[1:18:54] thou can just do anything
[1:18:55] have compassion on us and help us and
[1:18:58] jesus said unto him if thou
[1:18:59] canist believe all things are possible
[1:19:01] to him him that believes
[1:19:03] all things are possible not some things
[1:19:06] all
[1:19:07] all all encompasses everything all
[1:19:10] things are possible
[1:19:11] and straight away the father of the
[1:19:13] child cried out and said with tears lord
[1:19:15] i believe
[1:19:16] help thou my unbelief so the so the
[1:19:18] father came with a real need
[1:19:21] and he knew it could be done that's why
[1:19:22] he brought him to the to the disciples
[1:19:24] but then but then when the master came
[1:19:26] himself
[1:19:27] jesus says well if you believe all
[1:19:28] things are possible basically your son
[1:19:30] can be healed so
[1:19:31] but the father recognized the state said
[1:19:33] lord i do believe
[1:19:35] but help my unbelief take my unbelief
[1:19:37] away that my child will be made whole
[1:19:40] hallelujah then when jesus saw that the
[1:19:43] people came running
[1:19:45] together he rebuked the foul spirit
[1:19:46] saying unto them thou dumb and death
[1:19:48] spirit our charges come out of him and
[1:19:49] enter into him no more
[1:19:51] and the spirit cried and rent him saw
[1:19:53] and came out of him
[1:19:54] as he was as one dead and so much that
[1:19:57] many said he is dead
[1:19:58] so that spirit came out but i but what i
[1:20:01] want to draw from here is jesus says if
[1:20:03] thou
[1:20:03] cannest believe all things are possible
[1:20:05] to him that believes
[1:20:07] do we have believers today are we
[1:20:09] believers today
[1:20:10] i mean so so in other words there is
[1:20:12] nothing impossible with you
[1:20:15] now i'm not talking about human ability
[1:20:17] now i'm talking about god's ability in
[1:20:19] you
[1:20:20] but there's nothing impossible do you
[1:20:22] know that man
[1:20:23] is all-powerful you know man is
[1:20:25] all-powerful
[1:20:26] we are not limited in
[1:20:31] brother power says this he says amen cut
[1:20:34] every obstacle from human beings that
[1:20:36] they might be connected like in the
[1:20:37] garden of eden
[1:20:38] amen what did adam have in the garden
[1:20:40] all power
[1:20:41] tree move here he'll do this he could
[1:20:43] just rearrange the place by the power of
[1:20:45] the spoken word
[1:20:46] because he was god over the earth that
[1:20:48] was his god-given position
[1:20:50] he did not make himself that he was made
[1:20:53] that
[1:20:53] just like the bride of christ we are not
[1:20:55] made amen
[1:20:57] well i might get this mixed up like i
[1:20:59] mixed up words but you know
[1:21:00] we are made to be the bride of christ he
[1:21:03] the lord says you're the bride
[1:21:04] you're my wife you have certain you you
[1:21:07] know you know you have privileges that
[1:21:08] the rest of world knows nothing about
[1:21:10] your joint here with me hallelujah all
[1:21:12] that i am you'll become
[1:21:15] so it's not us trying to make ourselves
[1:21:17] something if he says i'm something that
[1:21:18] well
[1:21:19] i'll just take that you know mary mary
[1:21:22] said to gabriel when gabriel said you're
[1:21:23] going to have the promised son you're
[1:21:24] going to have emanuel
[1:21:26] she just said let it be unto me
[1:21:27] according to that word basically i
[1:21:29] accept what you've told me yes
[1:21:31] that happened she didn't say well i'm
[1:21:33] going to do it and here's how it's going
[1:21:34] to be no let it be unto me according to
[1:21:36] my work
[1:21:38] that's how it should be with us he says
[1:21:41] cut every obstacle from human beings
[1:21:43] that they might be connected like the
[1:21:44] garden of eden that's what the blood
[1:21:46] does that's what
[1:21:46] the cross achieves amen i was going to
[1:21:49] choke it but i'm going to say it man is
[1:21:51] omnipotent that means all powerful
[1:21:53] you don't believe that but he is a man
[1:21:54] fully surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:21:57] did not he say in mark 11 22 whatsoever
[1:22:00] things you say
[1:22:01] and don't doubt in your heart it will
[1:22:03] come to pass and you can have what
[1:22:04] you've said
[1:22:06] he says what happens when two
[1:22:09] omnipotents meet when god and man comes
[1:22:11] together two omnipotent something's got
[1:22:13] to shake
[1:22:13] something whatsoever you'd say with that
[1:22:15] creative power of omnipotence of god
[1:22:18] knowing that he promised it and he said
[1:22:19] it in his word it creates a power
[1:22:22] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:22:24] to pass things that is not it makes them
[1:22:26] as though they are
[1:22:27] because two omnipotents have met here he
[1:22:29] stands oh
[1:22:30] isn't he wonderful hallelujah that's how
[1:22:32] it is when man and god
[1:22:34] come together amen and we have
[1:22:36] confidence that he said it in his word
[1:22:37] if god said it
[1:22:38] that's done hallelujah i believe it that
[1:22:41] settles it let's just move on
[1:22:43] it creates a power and that's not a
[1:22:44] power of unbelief it's a power of faith
[1:22:46] and it will produce things that though
[1:22:49] they are not they will be
[1:22:51] hallelujah amen so man is omnipotent
[1:22:56] all powerful i'm looking at a bunch of
[1:22:57] all-powerful people
[1:22:59] hallelujah someone fully surrendered to
[1:23:02] god
[1:23:02] is all-powerful amen moses was fully
[1:23:05] surrendered to god when he walked into
[1:23:07] egypt he said let my people go
[1:23:09] and pharaoh said i'll not let them go so
[1:23:11] moses just said well i'm going to plague
[1:23:12] your kingdom till you let them go
[1:23:14] hallelujah he already had the prophecy
[1:23:15] that they were going to go
[1:23:17] hallelujah same thing with you and i
[1:23:20] repent and be baptized name the lord
[1:23:22] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[1:23:24] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:23:25] holy ghost for the promises to you and
[1:23:27] to your children those that are far off
[1:23:29] as many as the lord our god shall call
[1:23:30] and we've already got the prophecy
[1:23:33] hallelujah
[1:23:34] amen amen so we can walk in confidence
[1:23:37] god said it it's going to happen
[1:23:39] but now he's got to put our faith in
[1:23:40] action amen hallelujah moses put his
[1:23:43] faith in action
[1:23:44] flags came trouble came to egypt

[1:24:26] spiritual outcome now
[1:24:28] moses you say well that sounds pretty
[1:24:30] far-fetched no no
[1:24:31] moses would be standing by a red sea and
[1:24:34] the children of israel were in dire
[1:24:35] straits because they saw
[1:24:37] pharaoh and his armies coming and it
[1:24:39] looked like it's going to be the biggest
[1:24:40] massacre there's ever been
[1:24:42] and they were all upset they were
[1:24:43] troubled and moses
[1:24:45] had an unction remember anointed to
[1:24:47] speak moses received an
[1:24:49] action where he would say to say to
[1:24:51] israel he says fear ye not
[1:24:53] stand still and see the salvation of god
[1:24:55] now notice he had not heard that the sea
[1:24:57] was going to open at this stage
[1:24:59] he just said fear not stand still and
[1:25:01] see the salvation of the lord
[1:25:03] which he will show you today for the
[1:25:06] egyptians who you see today you shall
[1:25:08] see them again no more forever
[1:25:10] for the lord shall fight for you and you
[1:25:12] shall hold your peace
[1:25:14] whatever he was he was anointed to speak
[1:25:16] this is gonna be the outcome it looks
[1:25:18] really bad but this is gonna help this
[1:25:20] is what's gonna happen
[1:25:22] hallelujah it's gonna be the same thing
[1:25:23] with you and i we're gonna speak faith
[1:25:26] hallelujah the family circle will be
[1:25:28] unbroken

[1:25:30] victorious we're not leaving one hoof
[1:25:32] behind
[1:25:33] i mean everyone's going to come
[1:25:34] hallelujah hallelujah believe on the
[1:25:36] lord jesus christ and thy and thy house
[1:25:38] shall be saved
[1:25:40] hallelujah and you know the rest of the
[1:25:43] story
[1:25:45] god said to him why cry to me speak and
[1:25:47] move forward
[1:25:48] lift up your staff and the reds he
[1:25:50] parted they went over the egyptians
[1:25:51] tried to follow them they all drowned
[1:25:53] and then the israelites had a real
[1:25:54] jubilee pentecostal meeting on the other
[1:25:56] side
[1:25:57] hallelujah but it's because moses
[1:26:00] received an unction
[1:26:02] he spoke david was anointed to be king
[1:26:07] he was a shepherd boy to begin with but
[1:26:09] god saw him as king
[1:26:10] yes you know it's incredible really if
[1:26:12] we could just really
[1:26:14] you know sometimes you see little
[1:26:16] children you think what's the potential
[1:26:17] in them
[1:26:19] you know in the world you know sporting
[1:26:21] scouts will look at people at young age
[1:26:23] you know i remember when i started
[1:26:25] um uh school or was it boarding school
[1:26:27] all the not that i started in
[1:26:29] in the year is it year 11 these days
[1:26:31] that's what they call it third form back
[1:26:33] in my day
[1:26:34] i didn't do ncea i was the last year to
[1:26:36] do the bursary anyway
[1:26:37] you know the third formers or the year
[1:26:39] 11s they were put through all these
[1:26:40] different sports exercises for a day
[1:26:43] and all the so they did rowing machines
[1:26:44] that had running they did all kinds of
[1:26:46] stuff because
[1:26:47] all the coaches were looking what's in
[1:26:49] these children
[1:26:50] that they can harness what's in them
[1:26:52] that when they hit the final year of
[1:26:54] school
[1:26:54] they'll be maybe national champions they
[1:26:57] were looking for potential
[1:26:59] now that's just in a natural realm how
[1:27:01] much more a supernatural realm
[1:27:03] i mean the potential that's in a
[1:27:05] believer hallelujah
[1:27:08] amen so here's david he's anointed to be
[1:27:10] king on the outward
[1:27:11] he looks like well he's just a shepherd
[1:27:13] boy but he has been anointed amen to be
[1:27:16] king over israel
[1:27:18] and he would he would take some food he
[1:27:20] was under the obedience of his father
[1:27:21] and he'd take some food to the battle
[1:27:23] and
[1:27:23] you know you know we're where the
[1:27:25] philistines are on one side and you know
[1:27:27] israel was on the other side and
[1:27:28] you know goliath would come out and make
[1:27:30] his boats for 40 days and
[1:27:32] you know but there came a time where
[1:27:34] where
[1:27:36] the words of goliath fell in the wrong
[1:27:38] ears
[1:27:39] and they fell into the ears of a man who
[1:27:42] had an unction
[1:27:42] he was anointed by the holy ghost i mean
[1:27:45] that anointing was going to speak forth
[1:27:48] and then so david would would would
[1:27:50] testify
[1:27:51] you know you know the different ones in
[1:27:52] the camp he would have to overcome the
[1:27:54] pressure of his
[1:27:55] older brother telling him he's just
[1:27:56] naughty wanted to see the battle he had
[1:27:58] to overcome family pressure
[1:28:00] but he he just stuck to his guns and
[1:28:02] said who is this uncircumcised
[1:28:03] philistine
[1:28:04] why basically you stuck here you should
[1:28:06] be putting the sword in their neck and
[1:28:08] you should be delivered
[1:28:09] you know we should have won this by now
[1:28:11] because we are the armies of the living
[1:28:13] god and this guy's just some
[1:28:14] uncircumcised philistine
[1:28:16] and you know he would he would talk
[1:28:17] about these things and eventually he was
[1:28:19] taken into the presence of saul
[1:28:21] who was really built for the job but he
[1:28:22] was a backslidden king in a backslidden
[1:28:24] condition wasn't willing to go fight no
[1:28:26] more
[1:28:27] and you know david was allowed to go
[1:28:29] face this champion
[1:28:30] now it's amazing when you know i don't
[1:28:32] know what was well
[1:28:33] goliath no no doubt he thought what an
[1:28:35] insult
[1:28:37] here i am the champion of the
[1:28:38] philistines and they send out a shepherd
[1:28:39] boy with a stick and a
[1:28:41] you know you know to try and kill me but
[1:28:43] you know
[1:28:44] so goliath made his boasts
[1:28:47] he he would say i'm going to feed you to
[1:28:49] the dogs
[1:28:51] or what am i about a dog he says i'm
[1:28:52] just going to feed your carcass to
[1:28:54] you know but then david received an
[1:28:56] unction he's going to speak an outcome
[1:28:59] he said thou come this to me with a
[1:29:00] sword and with a spear and with a shield
[1:29:03] but i come to thee in the name of the
[1:29:04] lord of hosts the god of the armies of
[1:29:06] israel whom now has defied
[1:29:08] he said this day will the lord deliver
[1:29:11] thee into my hand
[1:29:12] i will smite them will take thy head
[1:29:15] from me he didn't even have a sword
[1:29:17] hallelujah and i will give the carcasses
[1:29:19] of the host of the philistines this day
[1:29:21] into the fowls of the air
[1:29:22] so basically say he said i will give
[1:29:25] hallelu the carcasses of the host of the
[1:29:27] philistines
[1:29:28] so basically he said basically i'll kill
[1:29:30] you
[1:29:31] i'm going to kill all them that are
[1:29:32] behind you i'm going to take out the
[1:29:34] whole thing
[1:29:35] what he was under an action amen because
[1:29:37] our god is mighty in battle
[1:29:39] amen he is mighty in battle he's not
[1:29:41] afraid of a challenge
[1:29:42] i mean the devil may do a lot of things
[1:29:44] but god doesn't get intimidated he says
[1:29:46] okay devil if you're going to do what
[1:29:47] you're going to do i'm going to do what
[1:29:48] i'm going to do
[1:29:49] and you know the outcome of what you're
[1:29:50] going to do you're going to be defeated
[1:29:52] you're going to be made humiliated and
[1:29:53] i'm going to be victorious
[1:29:55] hallelujah so he would he would say so
[1:29:57] so he came under an unction
[1:29:59] and he spoke his outcome what is what
[1:30:02] happened he cut off glass head
[1:30:04] amen and and and israel rallied and they
[1:30:08] won a great victory
[1:30:10] hallelujah why because he was under an
[1:30:13] action
[1:30:15] amen we've got to be at under an action
[1:30:16] as well where do we move by the holy
[1:30:19] ghost more than just our natural mind

[1:33:49] church meeting
[1:33:50] oh we're gonna sing songs for about half
[1:33:52] an hour maybe a couple of specials
[1:33:54] maybe some prayer requests and the
[1:33:55] preacher will get up and do what he does
[1:33:57] who have some closing serve
[1:33:58] is that what church is about shall we do
[1:34:01] those things to create an atmosphere but
[1:34:03] really
[1:34:03] what do we what do we gather to do i
[1:34:06] mean that god will come down and give an
[1:34:07] unction
[1:34:08] amen when we are in our seat we praise
[1:34:10] god it's not us praising us him praising
[1:34:12] through us
[1:34:12] when we sing we sing in the spirit when
[1:34:14] we praise we praise in the spirit we
[1:34:16] preach

[1:34:18] our hands we when we play our
[1:34:20] 10-stringed instrument right here
[1:34:22] i mean we clap in the spirit when we
[1:34:23] dance we dance in the spirit why
[1:34:25] it's all god doing it hallelujah amen
[1:34:28] you say well there's nothing really to
[1:34:30] that i know you can create an atmosphere
[1:34:32] around you
[1:34:32] that god just comes down you know god
[1:34:34] loves to worship
[1:34:36] he he loves to be worshipped but he
[1:34:38] loves to worship
[1:34:39] hallelujah you know when there's an
[1:34:40] atmosphere that's created god just says
[1:34:42] i've got to step into the atmosphere
[1:34:43] why because he inhabits the praises of
[1:34:45] his people he comes and dwells in our
[1:34:47] praises hallelujah
[1:34:50] hallelujah glory to god now
[1:34:53] this may be a bit of a segue but well
[1:34:57] this is the age we live in and unto the
[1:34:59] angel of the church and ladies here
[1:35:01] write these things sayeth the amen the
[1:35:03] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:35:04] of the creation of god
[1:35:06] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:35:08] cold nor hot i
[1:35:10] work that thou were cold or hot so then
[1:35:12] because thou art lukewarm
[1:35:14] and neither cold nor hot i'll spew the
[1:35:16] out of my mouth because thou
[1:35:17] sayest i am rich and increased with
[1:35:19] goods they have need of nothing
[1:35:21] knows not that thou art wretched
[1:35:23] miserable and poor
[1:35:24] and blind and naked now
[1:35:28] this covers the whole world you take any
[1:35:32] any country in the world it doesn't
[1:35:33] matter what economic status
[1:35:36] we're all rich increased with goods
[1:35:37] compared to say 50 years ago
[1:35:39] or 100 years ago you know i remember
[1:35:42] standing in papua new guinea i was in a
[1:35:43] little bible
[1:35:45] um study there in a pentecostal church
[1:35:46] and they read the scripture out
[1:35:48] they said look we are rich and increased
[1:35:50] with goods now
[1:35:51] to to the first world they
[1:35:54] aren't but to themselves they are
[1:35:57] because now they have power they got
[1:35:58] running water they got cell phones they
[1:35:59] got internet they got all these things
[1:36:00] cars and things they didn't have those
[1:36:02] things
[1:36:02] not that long ago but they're saying
[1:36:03] we're rich increase with goods
[1:36:06] amen and we and because the whole world
[1:36:08] is rich and increased with goods
[1:36:10] but notice the complaint he says because
[1:36:12] thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[1:36:14] hot i will spew thee out of my mouth now
[1:36:16] this is very important
[1:36:18] uh to to understand now
[1:36:22] this is this is from the ladder i see in
[1:36:24] church ages a bit of a bible study
[1:36:25] and we're going to look at this
[1:36:26] carefully it says this ladies and church
[1:36:28] age group is lukewarm
[1:36:30] this look warmness demise a penalty from
[1:36:32] god the penalty is that they will be
[1:36:34] spewed out of his mouth
[1:36:36] here is where we don't want to go astray
[1:36:38] as a lot of folks do
[1:36:39] they very unwisely say that god can spew
[1:36:42] out of his mouth and that proves there
[1:36:44] is no such thing
[1:36:45] as the truth of the doctrine or the
[1:36:47] perseverance of the saints
[1:36:50] i want to correct your thinking right
[1:36:52] now this verse does not get
[1:36:53] is not given to an individual that's
[1:36:55] given to the church he's talking to the
[1:36:57] church
[1:36:58] furthermore if you will just keep the
[1:37:01] word in mind you'll recall
[1:37:03] nowhere does it say that that we are in
[1:37:05] the mouth of god
[1:37:06] we are engraved on his palms we are
[1:37:09] carried in his bosom
[1:37:10] way back in the unknown ages before time
[1:37:13] we were in his mind
[1:37:14] we are in his sheepfold and his pastures
[1:37:16] but never
[1:37:18] his mouth but what hold on
[1:37:22] but what is in the mouth of the lord the
[1:37:24] word is in his mouth
[1:37:26] matthew 4 4 but he answered and said it
[1:37:28] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:37:30] alone but by
[1:37:31] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:37:33] mouth of god the word
[1:37:34] is supposed to be in our mouths too amen
[1:37:37] what does faith say
[1:37:39] what does faith say the word is neither
[1:37:41] even in thy mouth
[1:37:43] amen now we know that the church is his
[1:37:46] body amen
[1:37:48] it is here taking his place what will be
[1:37:51] in the mouth of the church the word
[1:37:53] first peter 4 and 11 if any man speak
[1:37:55] let him speak is the oracles the word of
[1:37:57] god
[1:37:58] second peter 1 21 for prophecy came not
[1:38:01] in
[1:38:01] old time by the will of man but holy men
[1:38:04] of god spake as they were moved by the
[1:38:06] holy ghost
[1:38:07] then what is wrong with these people of
[1:38:08] the last day they have gotten away from
[1:38:10] the word
[1:38:11] they are no longer fervent about it they
[1:38:13] are lukewarm about it
[1:38:14] i'm gonna prove that right now
[1:38:17] hallelujah
[1:38:18] the baptists have their creation dogmas
[1:38:20] based on the word and you can't shake
[1:38:21] them they say the apostolic days of
[1:38:23] miracles are over
[1:38:24] and there's no baptism with the holy
[1:38:26] ghost subsequent
[1:38:27] to believing the methodists say based on
[1:38:30] the word there is no water baptism
[1:38:31] sprinkling is not baptism
[1:38:33] and that sanctification is the baptism
[1:38:35] with the holy ghost
[1:38:36] the church of christ majors in
[1:38:38] regenerational baptism and
[1:38:39] in too many cases they go down dry
[1:38:41] sinners and come up wet ones
[1:38:43] yet they claim their doctrine is
[1:38:44] word-based go right down the line and
[1:38:46] come to the pentecostals
[1:38:48] do they have the word give them the word
[1:38:49] test and see they'll sell out the word
[1:38:51] for a sensation
[1:38:53] just about every time if you can produce
[1:38:55] a manifestation like oil and blood and
[1:38:57] tongues and other signs
[1:38:59] whether in the word or not or whether
[1:39:00] properly interpreted from the word the
[1:39:02] majority
[1:39:03] will fall for it but what has happened
[1:39:06] to the word the word has been put aside
[1:39:08] so god says i'm going against you all i
[1:39:11] will spew out of my mouth this is the
[1:39:13] end
[1:39:14] for seven out of seven ages i've seen
[1:39:17] nothing but
[1:39:18] men are steaming their own word above
[1:39:20] mine and you can bring this into our own
[1:39:21] ranks as well
[1:39:22] when we esteem our own word above the
[1:39:25] scripture
[1:39:27] yes same problem amen so at the end of
[1:39:30] this age i'm spewing out of my mouth
[1:39:32] it's all over i'm going to speak
[1:39:34] all right yes i'm here in the midst of
[1:39:36] the church the amen of god the faithful
[1:39:38] and true witness will reveal himself and
[1:39:40] it will be by my prophet oh yes it is so
[1:39:42] revelations 10 7
[1:39:43] and in the days of the voice of the
[1:39:45] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:39:47] sound
[1:39:47] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:39:49] he has declared to his servants the
[1:39:50] prophets
[1:39:51] there it is he is sending a vindicated
[1:39:53] prophet he's sending a prophet after
[1:39:55] almost 2 000 years
[1:39:56] he is sending someone who is so far from
[1:39:58] organization education and the world of
[1:40:01] religion
[1:40:01] that is john the baptist and elijah of
[1:40:03] old he will hear only from god
[1:40:05] and he will have thus saith the lord and
[1:40:07] speak for god
[1:40:08] he'll be god's mouthpiece and he as
[1:40:10] declared in malachi 4 6
[1:40:12] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:40:13] back to the fathers he will bring back
[1:40:16] the elect of the last days and they will
[1:40:18] hear a vindicated prophet give the exact
[1:40:20] truth
[1:40:20] as it was with paul he will restore the
[1:40:23] truth as they had it
[1:40:24] and those elect with them and that they
[1:40:26] will be the ones
[1:40:28] who truly manifest the lord and be his
[1:40:30] body and be his voice and perform his
[1:40:32] works
[1:40:32] hallelujah do you see it
[1:40:37] a momentary consideration of church
[1:40:39] history will prove how accurate this
[1:40:41] thought is
[1:40:42] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:40:44] entirely lost to the people
[1:40:45] but god sent luther with the word the
[1:40:47] lutheran spoke for god at that time but
[1:40:49] they organized and again the pure word
[1:40:52] was lost for organization tends towards
[1:40:54] dogma and creeds and not simple word
[1:40:56] they could no longer speak for god then
[1:40:58] god sent wesley and he was the voice
[1:41:00] with the word in his day
[1:41:02] the people who took his revelation from
[1:41:04] god became living epistles
[1:41:06] reader known of all men for their
[1:41:07] generation when the methodists failed
[1:41:09] god raised up others and so it has gone
[1:41:12] on through the ages
[1:41:13] until in this last day there is again
[1:41:15] another people in the land
[1:41:16] who under their messenger will be the
[1:41:18] final voice to the final age they're
[1:41:20] saying
[1:41:21] there will be living epistles again
[1:41:23] there will be a people who are living
[1:41:24] epistles what's living epistles that's
[1:41:26] when the word
[1:41:27] lives hallelujah yes sir he says the
[1:41:30] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:41:32] god it's its own mouthpiece
[1:41:34] so god is turning on her he will
[1:41:36] confound her through the prophet
[1:41:38] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:41:40] be in her
[1:41:42] we have received an unction hello yes it
[1:41:44] is for it says in the last days
[1:41:46] i mean so in the last chapter of
[1:41:48] revelations verse 17
[1:41:50] the spirit and the bride say come once
[1:41:52] more the world will head direct from god
[1:41:54] as at pentecost
[1:41:56] but of course that word bride will be
[1:41:58] repudiated
[1:41:59] as in the first stage now that word
[1:42:00] repudiated means to be judge wrong
[1:42:04] but they weren't wrong hallelujah so now
[1:42:08] the world will once more hear direct
[1:42:09] from god is at pentecost why because
[1:42:11] we've been restored back
[1:42:13] that same book of acts church we've been
[1:42:15] restored back to it
[1:42:16] not all the problems and the fussing and
[1:42:18] the fighting but god living in a people
[1:42:20] manifesting his word for the day
[1:42:23] hallelujah now he has cried out in this
[1:42:25] last age you have the word you have more
[1:42:27] bibles than ever but you're not
[1:42:29] doing anything about the word except
[1:42:30] dividing and hacking
[1:42:32] into pieces we never want to be in that
[1:42:34] state
[1:42:36] where we sit around we just chop chop up
[1:42:38] the word and
[1:42:39] what about this you know because
[1:42:40] remember we should never be examining
[1:42:42] the word from an intellectual
[1:42:44] standpoint saying what can i see it
[1:42:47] should be lord speak to me through your
[1:42:49] word
[1:42:50] amen you know if anyone's ever done any
[1:42:54] psych
[1:42:54] yeah you know science experiments as as
[1:42:57] as i work in that realm
[1:42:59] you know you are with your mind working
[1:43:01] out things
[1:43:02] and you're coming to conclusions based
[1:43:04] on what you know
[1:43:05] we shouldn't look at the bible that way
[1:43:07] we should look at the scripture lord
[1:43:08] speak to me remember in here is the
[1:43:10] character of christ
[1:43:11] from genesis to revelation what are we
[1:43:13] called to put on in this day his nature
[1:43:16] his word so it should be lord wherever i
[1:43:18] read in your scripture
[1:43:19] change my character to match your
[1:43:22] character
[1:43:23] change my thoughts to match your
[1:43:24] thoughts may i be more like you as i
[1:43:27] read your word
[1:43:28] amen amen
[1:43:31] i would sooner you were cold or hot if
[1:43:33] you were cold and rejected
[1:43:35] i could stand that uh if you were white
[1:43:38] hot to know it's truth and live it i
[1:43:40] praise you for that but when you simply
[1:43:42] take my word and don't honor it
[1:43:43] i in return must refuse to on you i will
[1:43:46] spew you
[1:43:47] out for you nauseate me and he's on the
[1:43:50] outside of his church today he says if
[1:43:52] any yeah if anyone here might
[1:43:53] he's behold i stand at the door and
[1:43:55] knock and that's
[1:43:57] you know many people take that as an
[1:43:58] evangelistic call saying god's knocking
[1:44:00] on your heart just open the door
[1:44:02] and for a sense that's true but he's
[1:44:03] actually on the outside of the church
[1:44:05] world trying to get back in but he's
[1:44:07] been
[1:44:07] being replaced by man's ideas and men
[1:44:09] debating and hacking the word apart
[1:44:11] creeds and dogmas
[1:44:12] as opposed to them letting god come in
[1:44:14] and live we want him to come in and live
[1:44:16] don't we
[1:44:17] that his word would have preeminence in
[1:44:19] our lives
[1:44:21] hallelujah because when it's him living
[1:44:24] it's no longer our ability it's no
[1:44:27] longer us trying to be a christian
[1:44:29] remember true christianity is him being
[1:44:30] the christian in you
[1:44:32] amen yo that's really how it is it's not
[1:44:34] us trying to be the christian you
[1:44:36] we die out to ourselves we allow
[1:44:38] ourselves as a living sacrifice
[1:44:40] he comes down and consumes the sacrifice
[1:44:42] he comes in and liver
[1:44:44] comes and lives in us now brother
[1:44:46] brown's relating this story here
[1:44:49] he says the other day over in a little
[1:44:51] place i was having a meeting over here
[1:44:52] in
[1:44:53] in uh topeka kansas there was a boy a
[1:44:56] young preacher one of my first sponsors
[1:44:58] brother roy sitting here remembers the
[1:45:00] place
[1:45:00] and this was a great place and there was
[1:45:02] uh this minister had got under a roof or
[1:45:04] a place
[1:45:05] the side wall mashed him down beneath
[1:45:07] that the little fella was going to die
[1:45:09] his liver was bursted his spleen was
[1:45:11] knocked out of place tons fell on him
[1:45:13] i sat at the breakfast talking to the
[1:45:15] wife i said why if you know if jesus was
[1:45:17] here you know what he'd do
[1:45:19] i said when he spot when he sponsored me
[1:45:22] pardon me i believe that word he is
[1:45:24] sponsoring christ and i said
[1:45:25] that's a trick of the devil if jesus was
[1:45:28] here
[1:45:29] hit your layers holy hands upon him and
[1:45:31] the boy would get well
[1:45:34] i don't care if his liver's bursted he'd
[1:45:36] get well because jesus would walk in
[1:45:38] there knowing exactly who he was
[1:45:40] he noticed calling the scripture was
[1:45:42] right by me vindicating in him
[1:45:45] that he knowed who he was and not a
[1:45:47] shadow of doubt he'd lay his hands upon
[1:45:48] him and say son be well
[1:45:50] walk out of there and i'd say there
[1:45:51] isn't enough devils in hell to kill that
[1:45:53] boy then
[1:45:54] i said he'd get well but if but but if i
[1:45:57] said you see honey he was jesus the holy
[1:45:59] hands of god
[1:46:02] i said i'm a sinner i'm born sexual
[1:46:04] birth my father and mother were both
[1:46:05] sinners and i'm
[1:46:07] just and no good nothing and i said you
[1:46:09] know what
[1:46:10] if the lord would give me a vision and
[1:46:12] send me down there then that would be
[1:46:13] different i said i'd go
[1:46:14] down lay my hands on him he'd come out
[1:46:17] of that bed if he
[1:46:18] gave me a vision then i got to thinking
[1:46:20] after all
[1:46:21] if it was the vision what was it it's
[1:46:24] the same dirty hands on omaha same man
[1:46:26] praying for him same dirty hands
[1:46:28] now i got to thinking after all if it
[1:46:30] was a vision what was it
[1:46:32] if it's the same dirty hands on him same
[1:46:34] man praying
[1:46:36] same dirty hands but then i begin to
[1:46:37] think
[1:46:39] i'm a representative i'm i'm his
[1:46:41] representative
[1:46:43] then god doesn't see me that blood of
[1:46:45] that righteous one lays up there upon
[1:46:47] the altar and maketh intercessions for
[1:46:49] me
[1:46:49] he is my sufficiency here's my prayer
[1:46:52] here's my life
[1:46:53] i said the only thing that would make me
[1:46:56] put his
[1:46:56] put my hands on him with faith because i
[1:46:59] had faith in the vision
[1:47:01] and without the vision the same faith
[1:47:02] would do the same thing
[1:47:05] so i can reckon myself nothing but
[1:47:07] reckon him my all in all he is my life
[1:47:09] he is my commissioner
[1:47:11] no denomination sent me he sent me
[1:47:13] hallelujah
[1:47:14] i go on his name i'll lay my hands upon
[1:47:17] him walk down there
[1:47:18] laid hands on that boy and that night he
[1:47:20] was in the meeting
[1:47:21] solid well amen because many times we
[1:47:24] put a
[1:47:25] you know we put ourselves in the same
[1:47:26] bracket if jesus just came and did it
[1:47:29] it'd be fine
[1:47:31] but then we have to come to a conclusion
[1:47:33] i'm his representative
[1:47:34] he called me remember if god put me in
[1:47:37] man can't put me out
[1:47:39] hallelujah if the lord brought me into
[1:47:40] the body of christ man can't kick me out
[1:47:42] of the body of christ
[1:47:43] if he called me man can't uncall me
[1:47:46] hallelujah isn't that right i mean so
[1:47:48] we're gonna we're gonna come to that
[1:47:49] place
[1:47:50] where we just say he's my he's my
[1:47:53] righteousness
[1:47:54] i'm not my own righteousness he's my
[1:47:56] sufficiency
[1:47:57] amen he is my all in all and it may be
[1:48:00] the same hands
[1:48:01] but now god can use those hands
[1:48:03] hallelujah
[1:48:04] vision or no because it says lay hands
[1:48:06] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:48:08] that's our standing orders
[1:48:09] amen he says even faith without the
[1:48:11] vision it would be fine and
[1:48:13] and he went down and prayed for me got
[1:48:15] up in his fine solid well
[1:48:17] you're following me we've received an
[1:48:20] action
[1:48:21] hallelujah we're anointed to speak yes
[1:48:24] now i'm just going to finish with this
[1:48:25] quote i wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:48:28] impressed with the word in our midst
[1:48:31] let me give you a thought here remember
[1:48:33] were the disciples efficient
[1:48:35] sufficiently impressed they saw this was
[1:48:38] god and flesh with them
[1:48:40] yes this one can do anything calm the
[1:48:43] storm
[1:48:44] bring lazarus back from the dead after
[1:48:46] four days in the grave
[1:48:47] do anything he wanted to heal is god now
[1:48:50] that same one that was in the body
[1:48:52] jesus is in the believer you believe
[1:48:54] that the same holy ghost that was in him
[1:48:56] without measures now
[1:48:57] in you hallelujah we are his body upon
[1:49:01] the earth
[1:49:02] and we know the word is living it's not
[1:49:04] just ink on paper
[1:49:06] so i wonder if we're sufficiently
[1:49:07] impressed with the word now mitz
[1:49:10] let me give you a thought here how do we
[1:49:11] pray we pray in jesus name don't we
[1:49:14] every prayer is in his name or there
[1:49:16] isn't any answer yet
[1:49:17] in first john 5 14 we are told this is
[1:49:20] the confidence we have in him
[1:49:22] that if we ask anything according to his
[1:49:24] will he heareth us
[1:49:26] and if we know that he and and if we
[1:49:28] know that he hear us whatsoever we ask
[1:49:30] we know that we have the petitions that
[1:49:32] we have desired of him
[1:49:34] now we ask what is the will of god
[1:49:36] there's only one way to know his will
[1:49:38] and that is by the word of god
[1:49:39] lamentations 3 who is he that saith
[1:49:43] and it cometh to pass when the law
[1:49:45] commandeth not there it is
[1:49:46] if if it isn't in the word you can't
[1:49:48] have it so we can't ask unless it's in
[1:49:51] the word and we can't petition or ask
[1:49:52] unless it is in his name
[1:49:54] there it is again jesus the name is the
[1:49:57] word the will
[1:49:58] you can't separate god and the word they
[1:50:00] are one
[1:50:02] now when this word he has left behind on
[1:50:04] printed pages is a part of him
[1:50:07] when you accept it by faith into a
[1:50:09] spirit-filled life
[1:50:10] he said his word was life john 6 63 the
[1:50:13] be part of the verse
[1:50:14] now that's exactly what he is john 14 6
[1:50:17] i am the way
[1:50:18] the truth and the life romans 8 9 be
[1:50:21] part of it if any man have not the
[1:50:23] spirit of christ
[1:50:23] is none of his there it is he is spirit
[1:50:26] in his life that is exactly what the
[1:50:28] word is
[1:50:28] that is exactly what jesus is hears the
[1:50:30] word so when a spirit born
[1:50:32] to me this is more than a quote when a
[1:50:35] spirit born
[1:50:36] spiritual man in faith takes the word
[1:50:38] into his heart and place it upon his
[1:50:40] lips
[1:50:41] why that is the same as deity speaking
[1:50:43] every mountain has to go
[1:50:45] satan cannot stand before that man
[1:50:47] hallelujah
[1:50:49] when a spirit-born spirit-filled man
[1:50:51] takes a word in faith apart you know
[1:50:53] into his heart and plays it upon his
[1:50:54] lips
[1:50:55] wise the same as deity speaking every
[1:50:57] mountain has to go
[1:50:58] satan cannot stand before that man i
[1:51:00] mean when the disciples were there in
[1:51:02] the book of acts was it them speaking
[1:51:04] it says no then stephen was filled with
[1:51:05] the holy ghost and he preached or
[1:51:07] different ones you know
[1:51:08] it was god speaking through them they
[1:51:10] received an unction
[1:51:12] hallelujah and with that action they
[1:51:14] overcame
[1:51:16] hallelujah it wasn't them trying in
[1:51:18] their minds work out how to you know
[1:51:20] win the argument things no god just
[1:51:22] spoke through them it should be the same
[1:51:24] thing with you and i
[1:51:25] just let god speak let god be god as
[1:51:27] brother um paul said
[1:51:28] how this is how we should be amen why
[1:51:31] because we are anointed to speak
[1:51:34] we've have received an unction in this
[1:51:36] day
[1:51:37] i trust you have individually where god
[1:51:39] has come into your life it's no longer
[1:51:41] you living you see him
[1:51:43] hallelujah yo that's why we can rejoice
[1:51:45] in the testimonies we have it was him
[1:51:47] it's him that saved us him that kept us
[1:51:49] him that delivered us
[1:51:50] anyway so don't let the devil clog up
[1:51:52] your mind with trouble
[1:51:54] no just just fill your heart with the
[1:51:56] word of god remember no weapon formed
[1:51:58] against he shall prosper
[1:52:00] there'll be a lot of weapons formed
