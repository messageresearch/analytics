[22:47] believe it's it was even greater when
[22:49] the Lord came into my heart
[22:51] and he founded the bounding place in in
[22:53] the minds of my heart so I'll just be
[22:56] very sore this morning so I've written

[23:05] It's just such a wonderful presence you

[23:08] choruses this morning so yeah
[23:11] um
[23:12] God has brought us um to New Zealand by
[23:14] his grace and by his Mercy as a family
[23:16] and we are just so happy and so glad
[23:19] that you know the Holy Spirit leads and
[23:21] he guides us and we've had many
[23:24] wonderful experiences made many
[23:26] wonderful people
[23:27] and my prayers always constantly been
[23:30] whatever I've done since the Lord has
[23:32] found that that means in my heart has
[23:34] always been to to find God's perfect
[23:36] will so brother Branham says you can um
[23:39] you can walk in his permissible
[23:43] um but he says he prays a praise His God
[23:46] I always want to be in God's perfect
[23:48] will amen and that that makes you a
[23:50] little bit nervous it makes you you know
[23:52] it makes you always a bit funny because

[23:57] a little bit funny
[23:58] and God opened up the door for us to
[24:01] eventually end up here in Wellington so
[24:03] by the grace of God we've had the
[24:04] opportunity to actually speak to a few
[24:07] Believers here um those that we could
[24:09] come in contact with families that we
[24:10] had an opportunity to just fill us up
[24:12] with it maybe at a dinner or something
[24:14] that we could actually expound a bit
[24:15] more so due to time I'm just concising
[24:18] the the testimony this morning and
[24:21] um
[24:22] are we so glad that we have been able to
[24:24] Surf with you and then also thank the
[24:26] almighty God for your wonderful and
[24:28] welcoming spirit amen it's it's really
[24:31] wonderful it's really glad to to meet
[24:33] people and and through life's journey
[24:34] and you you meet like you get into
[24:36] certain homes when you come into certain
[24:38] homes you realize wow the kids are just
[24:40] relaxed everybody's just relaxed uh the
[24:43] kids they the mom and dad so and you're
[24:45] just relax and you're coming to another
[24:47] home and then you realize wow it's
[24:48] different you know you have to just stay
[24:51] you don't know if the kids can touch the
[24:53] toys and touch this so it's just the the
[24:55] way things are you know and that's God
[24:57] sometimes uses different people in
[24:58] different ways amen but we're so happy
[25:00] that we have found a place for with a
[25:03] welcoming spirit amen and we love you
[25:06] all dearly and and and
[25:08] um you have obviously made us realize
[25:10] how much we have to be thankful for
[25:14] to have such wonderful brothers and
[25:16] sisters in New Zealand amen
[25:18] it took a lot of fasting and and pray
[25:22] um
[25:22] after the Lord is is spoken to my heart
[25:25] and and told me that it's time to return
[25:27] to South Africa
[25:29] amen and um
[25:31] so uh you know the wife and I um we've
[25:35] always been asking God what's his
[25:37] purpose and
[25:38] true life's journey God is um had a a
[25:42] different way in working in my life and
[25:44] he might have a different way in working
[25:45] brother John's like brother Ed different
[25:47] ones I'm really missing brother a
[25:49] brother Isaac this morning you know so
[25:51] there's a there's a part of the finger
[25:52] that's not a hand a part of the body
[25:54] that's not here so
[25:56] um oh it's just the sand and he's here
[25:58] oh oh she went with oh that's that's
[26:00] wonderful at least the whole family is
[26:01] there so just you know just send my
[26:04] regards to him as well or maybe I have
[26:06] to call him yeah so um it took a lot of
[26:08] fasting and pray saying God what's
[26:10] what's the purpose for bringing us here
[26:12] and um
[26:14] and then obviously saying in my mind it
[26:16] cannot be that um you know uh while we
[26:19] were only on the south island we were a
[26:21] bit isolated and we came here we were
[26:23] really glad for for the fellowship but I
[26:26] have learned through many experiences
[26:29] that the Lord has taken me through not
[26:32] to go against the plan of God Amen many
[26:34] things has happened where the Lord it
[26:36] wanted me to be in a particular place
[26:38] and not to question God no matter how
[26:41] ridiculous something that you do seems
[26:44] and um
[26:45] broadbandem on Wednesday night we just
[26:48] read a small quote of brother Branham
[26:49] way brother Branham says the holy spirit
[26:51] in the Revelation series he sees the
[26:53] Holy Spirit leads you and guides you and
[26:55] he says no matter how ridiculous
[26:58] it seems so so sometimes you do things
[27:01] that's ridiculous but you have to do it
[27:03] brother you have to stand on the corner
[27:05] and if you listen to it you just have to
[27:07] stand there the holy spirit said wait
[27:09] here and the policeman came up to him
[27:11] after a few minutes and said why are you
[27:13] still standing here maybe you want to
[27:14] throw himself in a car in front of a
[27:16] truck or something because the people
[27:17] are crossing the road he's got to stand
[27:18] on the on the corner a half an hour
[27:21] standing on the corner and people are
[27:22] crossing the road Holy Spirit said stand
[27:24] here so we we therefore discovered your
[27:28] prayers amen for the family and I as we
[27:30] are making our way back to South Africa
[27:33] um we've given a testament to a few
[27:35] brothers and um also believe that we've
[27:38] also come here by prey it's amazing how
[27:41] God I I've never in all my life I've
[27:44] never realized how strong prayer is
[27:48] and I'm you know I've I've you've done
[27:51] many things and when I came here when I
[27:54] heard when I said we're going back when
[27:57] I heard the sister says it's my prayer
[28:00] that we ended up here then I had made me
[28:03] think many times that God for a simple
[28:05] human God would stop the plane somewhere
[28:07] God would still cause a storm to rise
[28:10] just so did a simple human's prayer
[28:13] sister the Mind must pray can be
[28:15] answered so so you you know I I told my
[28:18] wife maybe brother Brennan was stupid
[28:19] and ridiculous he had to get out of the
[28:21] plane he had to walk out of the airport
[28:22] then he had to walk down the road they
[28:24] said stop
[28:26] maybe you we don't know but you have to
[28:29] do whatever the Holy Spirit leads so we
[28:32] covet your prayers we we ask that you
[28:34] just pray for us as we continue in this
[28:36] program's journey I mean it's really
[28:38] truly a Pilgrim's Journey
[28:41] um
[28:41] so I've just concise at uh you know the
[28:44] the the testimony this morning and I've
[28:46] I've put a little quote on
[28:49] um
[28:50] that I want to read I um I might be
[28:52] brother any well brother and he just
[28:54] gets it ready or while you're getting it
[28:55] ready while they're getting it ready I
[28:57] want to read something quickly from
[28:59] Brother branham's
[29:00] life so this is when he dedicated the
[29:03] Tabernacle the morning he got up at six
[29:04] he's finished with Brenham Tabernacle he
[29:06] built it he pulled the Tabernacle and
[29:08] the angel Lord appeared snatching ball
[29:11] away from that location and setting him
[29:13] down in the corner of 18 Penn Street in
[29:15] Jeffersonville
[29:18] he says and then he says oh on the Lord
[29:21] that once held a lollipunt aside he says
[29:24] it there now stood a large concrete
[29:26] building with a sign above it the front
[29:28] door Dead red Brenham Tabernacle the
[29:31] angel carried him inside Bill scarcely
[29:34] believe his eyes the building was
[29:36] jam-packed with people not only was
[29:38] every seat full but people sit in the
[29:41] aisles and stood against the Halls this
[29:44] is when he was in the vision the morning
[29:45] before they were dedicated at the far
[29:47] end of the room hungry crosses all he
[29:50] says here on one on on one of or one on
[29:54] the front of the pulpit and one on each
[29:57] side in the vision Bowl moved to a place
[29:59] behind the pool but then said oh this is
[30:02] this is what he said oh this is
[30:03] wonderful this is glorious God how good
[30:07] you ought to be to give me the stubborn
[30:10] Echo
[30:11] then the angel of the Lord said but this
[30:14] is not your Tabernacle amen so I'll just
[30:16] leave it there for now
[30:18] um
[30:18] I'll just want to read read a prayer
[30:22] that has really tossed my heart
[30:24] um out of the Revelation series
[30:26] um if the brother is ready so brother
[30:27] Branham admired the building he admired
[30:30] a wonderful building and the angel of
[30:32] the Lord said to him this is not your
[30:33] Tabernacle so you can maybe just go read
[30:35] it so I just want to read this one this
[30:37] came from the Revelation Series in the
[30:39] spring it's just been very heavy on my
[30:40] heart and um I salute brother
[30:44] uh
[30:46] uh brother Ben the pastor and I believe
[30:49] as I'm gonna going to read the prayer
[30:51] this is uh
[30:52] you know it's it's it's it's very
[30:54] difficult because you know I'm saying
[30:57] we're saying our last service we're
[30:59] saying our greetings this morning to you
[31:01] as we as we will be making our way back
[31:03] on the 25th on December
[31:06] um there's also been a a very heavy pull
[31:08] on the other side people that that um
[31:10] that started asking that we used to deal
[31:13] with churches that we used to go to
[31:14] people that we used to help and while
[31:17] coming here the Lord had a specific
[31:18] purpose and when we ended up in in
[31:20] Wellington the whole purpose of the Lord
[31:23] just started falling very nicely in
[31:25] place we realized why God had us brought
[31:27] here we realized and then what time is
[31:30] that purpose was playing itself out here
[31:32] God was calling the causing the pool to
[31:35] go back on the other side my family
[31:37] quite ill that side people I'm one of my
[31:41] my people that I used to help is to pray
[31:43] people we used to use our house just to
[31:45] for people to recover when they come
[31:46] from hospital and so on so we used to
[31:48] have a place and a purpose that you
[31:50] fulfill and we had to ask the Lord it
[31:53] came here by by Praise of God pressed us
[31:56] to give up everything that we had
[31:57] outside and he wanted us in a specific
[31:59] place and um
[32:01] uh uh you know brother Branham says you

[1:16:58] now the man just love how everything all

[1:17:04] idea the skit was a secret
[1:17:06] amen praise the Lord I enjoyed that
[1:17:08] and also the special as well so Luke
[1:17:10] chapter 2 verse 7
[1:17:12] and you brought forth her first born son
[1:17:15] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:17:17] laid him in a Manger because there's no
[1:17:19] room for them in the end
[1:17:20] and they were in the same country
[1:17:22] shepherds are biting in the field
[1:17:23] keeping watch over their flock by night
[1:17:26] and lo the angel the Lord Came Upon them
[1:17:28] and the glory of the Lord shine around
[1:17:30] about them and they were sore afraid and
[1:17:33] the angel said unto them fear not for
[1:17:35] our behold I bring you good tidings of
[1:17:37] great joy which shall be to all people
[1:17:40] for unto you was born this day in the
[1:17:42] city of David a savior which is Christ
[1:17:44] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[1:17:47] you you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[1:17:50] swaddling clothes lying in a manger and
[1:17:53] suddenly there was that
[1:17:55] um and suddenly there was with the angel
[1:17:58] a multitude of heavenly hosts praising
[1:18:00] God and saying glory to God in the
[1:18:03] highest and on Earth peace and Good Will
[1:18:04] towards men and it came to pass as the
[1:18:07] Angels were gone away from them into
[1:18:09] heaven the shepherd said one to another
[1:18:12] let us now go even unto Bethlehem and
[1:18:15] see this thing which has come to pass
[1:18:17] which the Lord has made known unto us
[1:18:19] and they came with haste and found Mary
[1:18:21] and Joseph and the Babe laying in a
[1:18:23] manger and when they had seen it they
[1:18:25] made known abroad the saying which was
[1:18:28] told unto them concerning this child and
[1:18:30] all that heard it wondered at those
[1:18:32] things which were told then by the
[1:18:34] Shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[1:18:37] and pondered them in her heart and the
[1:18:39] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[1:18:41] praising God for all the things that
[1:18:43] they had heard and seen as it was told
[1:18:46] unto them amen Lord bless his word you
[1:18:49] may you may have your seats amen I want
[1:18:51] to I want to speak about Christmas in
[1:18:53] 2015.
[1:18:55] you know it's incredible really I was it
[1:18:58] just really struck me I've been
[1:18:59] listening uh I was listening to a bit of
[1:19:01] you know brother bear and preaching
[1:19:02] white white had to be Shepherds and you
[1:19:05] know he read the same scripture here but
[1:19:07] it's a it's incredible just if you think
[1:19:10] about it where you know and and maybe if
[1:19:12] you keep your Bibles handy we'll go to
[1:19:14] Matthew Chapter 2 as well but it's
[1:19:16] incredible where here was here was the
[1:19:19] you know here was God's chosen people
[1:19:22] they were God's chosen Nation
[1:19:24] and they were they they believed that
[1:19:27] God was going to come and you know they
[1:19:29] believed the Messiah was going to be
[1:19:30] born and it wasn't a secret coming it
[1:19:34] was declared all the prophets declared
[1:19:35] It And yet when it was happening they
[1:19:38] had no idea what was going on and God
[1:19:41] bypassed who he should have spoke to he
[1:19:44] bypassed that channel and he went to
[1:19:45] Shepherds or he went to wise men in the
[1:19:48] East he didn't that's incredible let's
[1:19:50] just read here Matthew chapter two you
[1:19:52] know
[1:19:53] it's it's so to me to me it's one of the
[1:19:56] most probably the saddest the saddest
[1:19:58] portion of scripture you could read and
[1:20:01] it's the most profound
[1:20:03] the same time it's just it's just
[1:20:04] incredible how God would God would
[1:20:07] choose to do things like this so we'll
[1:20:08] go to Matthew chapter two we read from
[1:20:09] verse one and this is where the where
[1:20:12] the uh wise men the Magi have come so
[1:20:15] this is a bit after now when Jesus was
[1:20:17] born in Bethlehem of Judah in the days
[1:20:19] of Herod the king behold came wise men
[1:20:22] from the east of Jerusalem
[1:20:24] saying where is he that is born King of
[1:20:27] the Jews for we have seen his star in
[1:20:29] the east and have come to worship him
[1:20:31] when Herod the king had heard these
[1:20:33] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[1:20:35] with him why would they be troubled they
[1:20:38] would they would think you know
[1:20:40] they should not be troubled at these
[1:20:42] things
[1:20:43] because these wise men they went to the
[1:20:45] logical place they went to Jerusalem
[1:20:47] that's where the temple was in Jerusalem
[1:20:49] so they went to the logical place you
[1:20:52] know they didn't go to any other place
[1:20:54] in Israel they went straight to where
[1:20:55] you would think they would know what is
[1:20:57] going on and they were troubled and when
[1:21:00] he had gathered all the chief priests
[1:21:01] and scribes of the people together he
[1:21:03] demanded them where Christ should be
[1:21:05] born and they said unto them in
[1:21:07] Bethlehem of Judah for thus it is
[1:21:09] written by the prophet and now Bethlehem
[1:21:11] in the land of Judah aren't not the
[1:21:13] least among princes of Judah for out of
[1:21:15] thee shall come a governor that shall
[1:21:17] rule My People Israel then Herod when he
[1:21:20] had privately called the wise men and
[1:21:22] quiet of them diligently what time the
[1:21:24] star appeared and he sent them to
[1:21:26] Bethlehem and said go and search
[1:21:28] diligently for the young child and when
[1:21:30] you have found him bring me word again
[1:21:32] that I may come and worship him also and
[1:21:36] when they had heard the king they
[1:21:37] departed along the star which they saw
[1:21:39] in the East went before them till it
[1:21:41] came and stood over where the young
[1:21:43] child was when they saw the star they
[1:21:46] rejoiced with exceeding great joy and
[1:21:49] when they were come into the house they
[1:21:51] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[1:21:53] and fell down and worshiped him and when
[1:21:56] they had opened their Treasures they
[1:21:58] presented unto him gifts gold and
[1:22:01] frankincense and myrrh and being warned
[1:22:03] of God in a dream that they should not
[1:22:05] return to Herod they departed into their
[1:22:08] own country another way now we
[1:22:10] understand that the reason that Herod
[1:22:12] killed all the children two years old
[1:22:15] and younger is because by the time the
[1:22:17] wise men got there Jesus wasn't in the
[1:22:19] manger anymore but he was living in
[1:22:20] Bethlehem as a young child that's
[1:22:22] astounding where where here we have two
[1:22:25] scenes and these scenes should not have
[1:22:27] happened because God should have
[1:22:30] revealed it to this the you know why
[1:22:32] didn't the angel appear to the high
[1:22:34] priest why didn't the angel appear in
[1:22:36] the temple and tell them this night
[1:22:38] Christ the lord is born in a manger in
[1:22:41] Bethlehem why didn't he go to these
[1:22:43] people
[1:22:44] he had to you know the reason is and you
[1:22:47] can see it when the wise men they go
[1:22:48] into going to Jerusalem there's no
[1:22:51] record of them are seeing the star until
[1:22:52] they go out of the city again he was
[1:22:55] meant to be the most holy people the
[1:22:57] most holy nation the most holy Place
[1:23:00] upon the Earth Jerusalem And yet when
[1:23:02] when when those wise men were following
[1:23:04] that star from the East when they came
[1:23:07] into that place they couldn't see the
[1:23:08] sign anymore they couldn't see the star
[1:23:10] it was you could say it was obscured
[1:23:13] by the religion that was in that place
[1:23:15] it was obscured by the traditions of the
[1:23:18] scribes and Pharisees and it's amazing
[1:23:21] because
[1:23:23] he should have they should have been
[1:23:25] pointed out you know here it shouldn't
[1:23:27] have been troubled you know the scribes
[1:23:29] and Pharisees they shouldn't have been
[1:23:30] troubled it says all of Jerusalem
[1:23:33] all of it says and he was troubled in
[1:23:35] all of Jerusalem with them they were
[1:23:37] troubled what does this mean what's
[1:23:38] going on amazing isn't it you would
[1:23:41] think surely now I want to labor on this
[1:23:43] point because man doesn't change history
[1:23:46] repeats itself and what they did in his
[1:23:49] first coming this you're gonna do in a
[1:23:51] second coming
[1:23:52] and here we have a whole Christian world
[1:23:54] that is that is has major scenes in
[1:23:57] there and they're celebrating the birth
[1:23:58] of Jesus and we should celebrate the
[1:24:00] birth but we understand he was born in
[1:24:02] Spring he wasn't born in December
[1:24:04] because this 25th of December is the you
[1:24:07] know it's just the winter solstice time
[1:24:10] and we know the Romans they they took
[1:24:13] the birth of their son God and they just
[1:24:15] made it the birth of the Son of God yeah
[1:24:17] and they just change it they just change
[1:24:19] Pagan festivals they put Christian names
[1:24:21] to it too bring Christianity and
[1:24:23] paganism together
[1:24:25] so we understand he wasn't even born at
[1:24:27] this time because there's normally snow
[1:24:28] on the hills of Judea and sure Shepherds
[1:24:31] aren't going to be out in the snow
[1:24:33] amen and God runs with nature so he'll
[1:24:35] be born in Spring Lambs are born in
[1:24:37] Spring but we have come together still
[1:24:39] we still celebrate the birth of our Lord
[1:24:41] today I mean you're you're on Christmas
[1:24:43] but he was born there in the spring but
[1:24:46] it's amazing because man doesn't change
[1:24:48] as I said
[1:24:49] so if they were totally you know
[1:24:52] obscured they had no idea what was going
[1:24:54] on and God had to bypass
[1:24:57] think of it God had to bypass they had
[1:25:00] Bible schools in that day they had
[1:25:02] scholars in that day they had great
[1:25:04] Halls of learning studying the studying
[1:25:07] the Old Testament
[1:25:08] he bypassed the zealots he bypassed the
[1:25:11] herodians he bypassed the scribes and
[1:25:13] Pharisees and Sadducees he bypassed the
[1:25:15] high priest himself he bypassed kfss and
[1:25:19] all the he bypassed all these people and
[1:25:21] he came to Shepherds right amen he came
[1:25:23] to people who weren't even weren't even
[1:25:25] the ones you know he he came to these
[1:25:28] kind of people you think and that blows
[1:25:30] my mind
[1:25:31] because the very reason you know the
[1:25:34] temple was there and the high priest was
[1:25:36] there it's because the because the high
[1:25:38] priest
[1:25:39] you know stands between you know he
[1:25:41] offers the sacrifice on behalf of the
[1:25:43] people
[1:25:44] so you think surely you know this
[1:25:47] Angel's announcement because here was
[1:25:48] coming one who's going to do away at
[1:25:50] those sacrifices here was coming one
[1:25:52] that by one offering he has perfected
[1:25:55] forever them that are Sanctified amen so
[1:25:57] here was this great announcement where
[1:25:59] the blood of bulls and goats was going
[1:26:00] to be done away with and now the perfect
[1:26:02] lamb was going to come upon the Earth
[1:26:03] you'd think he would have gone there
[1:26:06] they didn't go there he went to
[1:26:08] Shepherds he went to he went to Mages in
[1:26:11] the east
[1:26:12] and we understand the reason those Magis
[1:26:14] were looking
[1:26:16] is because when Daniel and them were out
[1:26:18] in Babylon
[1:26:19] they he he taught them the wise men the
[1:26:21] scriptures and in Genesis is out of
[1:26:24] Judah says a star will arise out of
[1:26:26] Judah
[1:26:27] and so that scripture they will they
[1:26:29] were studying the heavens and they knew
[1:26:31] the Bible and they saw the star come up
[1:26:34] however it appeared maybe three joined
[1:26:35] together or a consolation however it
[1:26:38] worked and they saw that and they
[1:26:39] recognized in the scripture that a star
[1:26:42] will arise out of Judah
[1:26:44] and then they said now he must be born
[1:26:45] upon the Earth
[1:26:47] and then they begin to travel
[1:26:50] and here was
[1:26:52] you know and and here was the religious
[1:26:54] center of the world the true True
[1:26:56] Religion totally blinded to the whole
[1:26:58] thing right amazing
[1:27:01] now
[1:27:03] the angels
[1:27:05] they had to appear to the Shepherds
[1:27:07] because this is the kind of person God
[1:27:09] was going to become
[1:27:10] he wasn't can you imagine the high
[1:27:12] priest going into a Manger
[1:27:15] amen all in his dignified robes and all
[1:27:17] the things you know and he goes into
[1:27:19] this manger and there's you know manure
[1:27:21] and there's muck and there's animals and
[1:27:22] all could you imagine a high priest
[1:27:24] could you imagine those kind of people
[1:27:25] going into that place they wouldn't go
[1:27:27] into that place no sir they wouldn't
[1:27:29] want their robes all dirtied and things
[1:27:31] so God had to God had to speak to people
[1:27:35] who are willing to go into that kind of
[1:27:37] place
[1:27:38] amen and that's why he appeared you know
[1:27:41] that's why he appeared to the Shepherds
[1:27:43] that they weren't all bound up by their
[1:27:45] religion but they when they saw God you
[1:27:47] know God reveal himself and they knew
[1:27:50] that that was a lot apparent to them
[1:27:51] they acted upon what they saw
[1:27:53] and the angel LED them to where the word
[1:27:55] was born
[1:27:57] amen the angel led into where the word
[1:27:59] was born and it's a thing in this day
[1:28:02] we've had a visitation of the Angel amen
[1:28:04] amen God himself was a pit and he's led
[1:28:07] us to where the word is where the word
[1:28:09] is for this hour
[1:28:10] amen and it comes to your address
[1:28:12] because he knows that you have something
[1:28:14] in you that'll humble yourself to the
[1:28:16] word
[1:28:17] amen they the Shepherds they said well
[1:28:20] we're just at home in a in a Manger
[1:28:22] remember a Manger in those days it's
[1:28:25] like a cave cut out of a cliff yeah it's
[1:28:28] not you know it doesn't have a nice roof
[1:28:29] on it and you know how they have manger
[1:28:31] scenes in these days it wasn't that nice
[1:28:34] amen it was just a like a hole cut out
[1:28:37] of a side of a hill or a cliff and that
[1:28:39] was where the manger was
[1:28:40] here's a very king of glory being born
[1:28:43] into a place like that right
[1:28:45] has shown his godship by showing how
[1:28:48] humble he became amen so here was here
[1:28:51] was a place where the Shepherds felt at
[1:28:53] home
[1:28:54] but the religious world no no way these
[1:28:58] robes cost a lot of money I'm not
[1:28:59] getting them dirty I'm not going down
[1:29:02] here with all these animals I'm not I'm
[1:29:03] not going to this place
[1:29:05] and you'll find people today they will
[1:29:07] not humble themselves
[1:29:09] I mean to where God is
[1:29:11] they say no way God would I would never
[1:29:13] be seen with those kind of people yes
[1:29:15] they're a bunch of Fanatics Hallelujah
[1:29:18] hey yeah they just they just gone off
[1:29:20] the deep end they're just a bit crazy
[1:29:23] I'm happy this way if you want to call
[1:29:26] me whatever you want I'm happy to be
[1:29:27] this way I'm just in love with Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ amen hallelujah so here we have
[1:29:32] you know they would never have but the
[1:29:34] Shepherds were at home in that place
[1:29:36] Hallelujah
[1:29:38] and it's amazing because they they they
[1:29:40] listen to The Angel's message
[1:29:42] and they they went exactly where the
[1:29:44] angel told them to go and they found him
[1:29:45] they found him there and we've received
[1:29:48] an angel's message we've received the
[1:29:50] seventh Angel's message and he said
[1:29:52] you'll find Christ in his word
[1:29:54] Hallelujah and we have and we've humbled
[1:29:57] ourselves to the word and found him he's
[1:29:59] alive
[1:30:00] amen he's alive and well there's nothing
[1:30:02] wrong with saying I've met God sure a
[1:30:05] lot of people have said God told me do
[1:30:06] this and they shoot up a whole bunch of
[1:30:08] people that wasn't God telling them that
[1:30:10] but the devil on the news that to try
[1:30:13] and diminish the genuine
[1:30:15] there's nothing wrong with saying I've
[1:30:16] met Jesus Christ amen amen because if
[1:30:19] the apostles sure made him we have to
[1:30:21] meet him amen because he's the same in
[1:30:22] every generation
[1:30:24] and if he is the same people people are
[1:30:27] still the same you say we're more modern
[1:30:29] we're more educated there's no way we
[1:30:31] could make the same mistake as they made
[1:30:33] I'm sorry friends
[1:30:35] humanity is just exactly like they were
[1:30:38] when he came the first time so they will
[1:30:41] act the same way when he comes the
[1:30:42] second time
[1:30:44] now we understand that this that the
[1:30:47] first coming in his first coming he
[1:30:49] never said he was coming as a thief
[1:30:52] like a thief in the night and the second
[1:30:54] coming he says I come like a thief in
[1:30:55] the night and we'll read this in first
[1:30:57] Thessalonians Brother Andy touched on
[1:30:59] this but we'll go to first Thessalonians
[1:31:01] we'll read some scripture
[1:31:08] you know I was maybe this will
[1:31:13] just as we're turning to first
[1:31:14] Thessalonians chapter four you know I
[1:31:16] was thinking and this is totally a not
[1:31:17] uh I don't even know how to put this in
[1:31:20] words but you see when the angel gave
[1:31:22] the when the angel gave the message to
[1:31:23] the Shepherds then all all that Heavenly
[1:31:25] Host they just cried out they couldn't
[1:31:27] contain themselves they said Good Good
[1:31:29] Will and peace on Earth towards men you
[1:31:31] know they were saying glory to God you
[1:31:33] know there was they you know they had to
[1:31:35] cry out and praise God for what he'd
[1:31:36] done and and so in his first coming it
[1:31:39] was angels that they they they couldn't
[1:31:42] contain themselves for a Redemption had
[1:31:44] come to the Earth and then in a second
[1:31:46] coming when the lamb takes the book amen
[1:31:48] it's not just Angels crying out but John
[1:31:51] and all the redeemed in Revelations 5
[1:31:53] they said worthy and blessings and power
[1:31:55] and honor and glory be unto the lamb for
[1:31:58] he has redeemed us back to God they
[1:32:00] couldn't contain themselves when they
[1:32:01] saw the lamb take take the book
[1:32:03] Hallelujah and I just you know ever
[1:32:05] since I've been reading this I felt the
[1:32:07] same way amen when you see uh yo you've
[1:32:09] been redeemed by the blood of the lamb
[1:32:11] and something and you cannot contain it
[1:32:13] you say glory and blessing and power and
[1:32:15] honor be out to our lord Jesus
[1:32:17] Hallelujah I mean John John couldn't
[1:32:20] hold himself back he said I heard all
[1:32:23] everyone above the Earth and the Earth
[1:32:25] under the Earth heard me say glory and
[1:32:28] blessing and honor Hallelujah and we
[1:32:30] understand that John because in that in
[1:32:33] that scripture
[1:32:34] and you're in Revelations 5 it said you
[1:32:36] have redeemed us out of every Kindred
[1:32:38] Tongan Nation so we are all part of that
[1:32:40] scene in Revelations chapter five and
[1:32:43] John because he was caught up into an
[1:32:45] eternal realm John saw himself there
[1:32:47] amen Amen brother Graham says John saw
[1:32:49] John
[1:32:52] himself and that's why he was glaring
[1:32:55] and praising God because he saw he was
[1:32:56] part of the redeemed hey Hallelujah then
[1:32:59] you see us you you see yourself part of
[1:33:01] this word yes sir amen and you recognize
[1:33:03] I've been redeemed hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:06] it should just burst off glory and power
[1:33:08] and blessing and honor be unto the lamb
[1:33:11] you may think you're just beside
[1:33:12] yourself I know I'm just happy in the
[1:33:14] Lord as John If Heaven couldn't contain
[1:33:17] it the redeemed could not contain their
[1:33:20] their praising of God
[1:33:22] now I've always believed that Revival
[1:33:25] they had
[1:33:27] to put on flesh amen where there's the
[1:33:30] people upon the Earth and it just
[1:33:32] becomes such a you know it becomes so
[1:33:35] real amen amen that that I've been
[1:33:38] redeemed he's laid his hand upon me I
[1:33:41] belong to him I'm his property amen
[1:33:44] we're bought with a price we're not our
[1:33:46] own amen hallelujah I meant oh I just
[1:33:49] wish I could put it into words but you
[1:33:51] know when you recognize Jesus died for
[1:33:53] you amen Jesus was born that he would
[1:33:56] purchase your salvation
[1:33:58] hey Hallelujah you know people get
[1:34:00] excited in a sports event they get
[1:34:03] excited at the rugby they get excited
[1:34:05] and they shout and they paint themselves
[1:34:07] all different colors and Sub-Zero
[1:34:09] weather and they're there early I mean
[1:34:12] they're there early in the parking lot
[1:34:13] and they're getting ready
[1:34:15] Hallelujah hey we never say they're a
[1:34:18] bunch of Fanatics yeah the world does
[1:34:20] not say those guys are crazy right right

[1:34:30] right right I don't believe in that I
[1:34:32] believe in this I believe
[1:34:34] Hallelujah and so the world thinks you
[1:34:37] know the world does not think that's
[1:34:38] fanaticism but if someone's just in love
[1:34:41] with God and they're happy and rejoicing
[1:34:43] about it the world just says that
[1:34:45] person's crazy yes amen and they're

[1:35:07] Glory yes first Thessalonians 4.
[1:35:11] amen
[1:35:17] now
[1:35:18] worried first Thessalonians chapter four

[1:35:23] remember
[1:35:24] chapter five is a continuation of verse
[1:35:27] of chapter four it's not two different
[1:35:28] thoughts
[1:35:31] so he says for this sorry for verse 15.
[1:35:34] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:35:36] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:35:37] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:35:40] not prevent them which are asleep so
[1:35:41] he's coming
[1:35:43] absolutely for the Lord himself shall
[1:35:45] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:35:48] the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:35:49] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:35:51] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:35:53] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:35:55] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[1:35:57] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[1:35:59] the Lord wherefore Comfort one another

[1:36:27] true but God God laid in his word when
[1:36:30] you see these conditions as it was in
[1:36:33] days of Noah as it was the days of Sodom

[1:39:17] Hallelujah
[1:39:19] we have we have such an abundance

[1:39:32] been a day like this day I mean with God
[1:39:34] who has opened his word and it's not
[1:39:37] sealed to us but we know what it says
[1:39:39] amen we know who he is
[1:39:41] you know I I was yeah I probably shared
[1:39:43] it before but when I was back in
[1:39:44] University and I was trying to
[1:39:47] uh be a witness in amongst the
[1:39:49] university Christians quite a few of
[1:39:51] them said
[1:39:53] no one can really know truth today how
[1:39:55] can you know what truth is why and it
[1:39:57] just made me sad because Jesus said and
[1:40:00] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[1:40:03] shall make you free and he's not a man
[1:40:05] that can lie so if there's truth and
[1:40:08] there's truth ye shall know the truth
[1:40:10] and the truth shall make you free amen
[1:40:12] so if he said that then how can people
[1:40:14] say well how can you know what truth is
[1:40:16] it's because they've been taught wrong
[1:40:18] yes amen amen if someone sincerely wants
[1:40:21] to know the truth God is obligated to
[1:40:23] give them that truth
[1:40:26] so you know we have such a we have we

[1:40:40] amen amen Satan Satan if he oh I said it
[1:40:44] your your brother Danny Stephen said it
[1:40:45] they said if the devil is on your case
[1:40:48] if he's hounding you he's not under your
[1:40:50] feet and therefore he's out of your out
[1:40:52] of his position right amen

[1:41:31] this Bible is a record of exploits of
[1:41:33] faith
[1:41:34] amen and you can bring it all the way
[1:41:36] down through seven Church ages down into

[1:42:49] it's so resting and you feel refreshed
[1:42:51] and you know we just take it for granted
[1:42:53] because we live in that realm right
[1:42:55] right and that's the realm we're called
[1:42:57] to live in and Satan's Eden yeah this
[1:43:00] world six thousand years he's been

[1:43:35] to give you a good job or or lots of
[1:43:38] money or some something that'll take you
[1:43:40] away from God because he's trying to win
[1:43:42] you to himself he'll give you popularity
[1:43:45] or whatever it may be social standing
[1:43:47] you know he tries to do those things to
[1:43:49] try and you know attract you he tries to
[1:43:51] distract you yes amen he tries to
[1:43:54] attract You by everything but then we
[1:43:55] just come into this world and we get
[1:43:57] born again and something in us just just
[1:44:00] we see it for what it is amen and we're
[1:44:03] veiled we're actually the brightest you
[1:44:05] know you look at something out there on
[1:44:07] the street and Once Upon a Time it used
[1:44:09] to entice you and it used to excite you
[1:44:11] and it used to be actually that was your
[1:44:14] main love of life was whatever out there
[1:44:16] but then God comes down
[1:44:19] and then you look at the same thing
[1:44:21] ensure you have memories of what you
[1:44:23] used to enjoy but now you're looking and
[1:44:25] say there's nothing in me that wants
[1:44:27] that amen hallelujah what's happened
[1:44:29] you've been veiled to that thing
[1:44:31] glory to God
[1:44:32] yeah where were we first Thessalonians
[1:44:34] chapter five
[1:44:35] hey man I'm talking about Christmas if
[1:44:37] you're wondering where I'm going now
[1:44:39] first Thessalonians chapter five he says
[1:44:40] now
[1:44:42] but ye a verse five I believe we're but
[1:44:44] yeah all the children of light and the
[1:44:47] children of the day we are not of the
[1:44:49] night nor of Darkness he's telling the
[1:44:51] Believers you're not in darkness that
[1:44:54] day will not overtake you as a thief
[1:44:57] hallelujah amen I'm sure that and the
[1:45:00] church says glory to God Amen
[1:45:04] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[1:45:06] and they that be drunk in a drunken in
[1:45:08] the night but let us but lead us who are
[1:45:11] of the day be sober putting on the
[1:45:12] breastplate of faith and love for and
[1:45:15] for a helmet the hope of salvation for
[1:45:18] God has not appointed us now now put now
[1:45:21] God has appointed me for God has not
[1:45:23] appointed me
[1:45:24] to wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[1:45:28] Lord Jesus Christ so Paul is telling us
[1:45:31] quite plainly he's going to come as a
[1:45:33] thief in the night but he's not gonna
[1:45:34] you're not gonna miss your day and hour
[1:45:37] of visitation
[1:45:38] amen amen and and second Peter 3 verse
[1:45:42] 10 I'll just read it quickly but the day
[1:45:44] of the Lord will come as a thief in the
[1:45:46] night in which the heaven shall pass
[1:45:48] away with a great noise and the elements
[1:45:51] shall melt with fervent heat the Earth
[1:45:53] also and the works that therein shall be
[1:45:56] burnt up
[1:45:57] so yo his first coming he never said
[1:46:00] he's coming like a thief but a second
[1:46:02] coming says I'm going to come like a
[1:46:03] thief in the night so the first coming
[1:46:06] they all should have known
[1:46:08] they shouldn't have been surprised and
[1:46:10] troubled by what was going on in those
[1:46:12] days they should have known exactly what
[1:46:14] was happening
[1:46:16] and it's incredible
[1:46:18] where you even have with the you know
[1:46:20] you just think how people can be so numb
[1:46:23] you know they can be in the temple of
[1:46:25] God they can they can worship the true
[1:46:27] and living God but yet they can be so
[1:46:28] numb to what God is doing well you look
[1:46:31] at when John you know the angel visits
[1:46:33] John's dad he's a priest in the temple
[1:46:36] and he doesn't believe the Angel's
[1:46:38] message of of his son shall prepare the
[1:46:40] way of the Lord and he struck down
[1:46:43] and he and he comes out because I think
[1:46:45] he's ministering there with the incense
[1:46:47] and he comes out to where the people are
[1:46:49] and he can't speak
[1:46:50] and then finally after John was born
[1:46:53] and they and they're saying now which
[1:46:56] you know who are we gonna you know what
[1:46:57] shall we call them and only the
[1:47:00] tradition was that the that the Father
[1:47:02] the Son receives the father's name and
[1:47:04] they say let's call him Zacharias and
[1:47:06] they gave a writing table to to to sorry
[1:47:09] Zechariah Zacharias and he wrote call
[1:47:11] him John and as soon as he did that his
[1:47:14] mouth was open and he'd be in the
[1:47:15] glorified God hallelujah you think what
[1:47:18] an incredible event
[1:47:19] and the people's sword
[1:47:21] amen and just like when Mary went and
[1:47:24] spoke to Elizabeth before she you know
[1:47:27] he was even born and said you know and
[1:47:29] then as soon as her salutation came came
[1:47:32] into Elizabeth's ears I'm gonna have
[1:47:33] Jesus he's gonna be the Messiah John
[1:47:35] left in her womb amen and then they
[1:47:38] begin to praise and glorify the Lord the
[1:47:40] spirit of God Came Upon them what Manner
[1:47:42] of Child it says one place what Manner
[1:47:44] of Child shall this be right and that
[1:47:47] they were there there in Jerusalem they
[1:47:48] saw all these things take place and yet
[1:47:51] they forgot about it amen God was trying
[1:47:53] to get their attention I'm coming my
[1:47:56] forerunners being born into the Earth
[1:47:58] and then the messiah's gonna be brought
[1:48:00] into the Earth all these things are
[1:48:01] taking place and the and the church
[1:48:04] world in the day is just like what's
[1:48:05] going on
[1:48:08] amen we wouldn't miss we wouldn't be
[1:48:11] like them speaking of the church world
[1:48:13] we are in the new test now people have
[1:48:17] changed no
[1:48:19] people never change yes that's right
[1:48:22] you know they had they had scripture
[1:48:24] they were looking for for the Lord
[1:48:25] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[1:48:27] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:48:30] shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:48:32] and then it says it is in Isaiah 7 14
[1:48:35] Isaiah 9 6 front to us a child is born
[1:48:37] unto us the son is given and the
[1:48:39] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:48:41] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:48:42] counsel of the Mighty God the
[1:48:44] Everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:48:46] and brother bam says now when when
[1:48:48] Isaiah prophesied those things about a
[1:48:50] virgin conceiving it wasn't his own
[1:48:52] thinking because it never happened
[1:48:53] before was God declaring things and then
[1:48:56] when people who had who had young you
[1:48:58] know young woman virgin children you
[1:49:01] know ladies who could have had children
[1:49:03] all the parents said that's going to be
[1:49:05] my daughter my daughter's going to bring
[1:49:07] forth amen she's going to conceive by
[1:49:09] God and she's going to bring forth the
[1:49:11] Messiah and it carried about 800 years
[1:49:13] yes that's right and then finally it had
[1:49:16] carried for 800 years and then Mary Mary
[1:49:20] she's you know you know she's going
[1:49:22] about her Daily Business and then
[1:49:23] Gabriel appears to her says fear not and
[1:49:26] begins to declared to her you shall have
[1:49:29] the promised son you shall have you
[1:49:31] shall be the Fulfillment of Isaiah's
[1:49:33] prophecy hallelujah amen and now she
[1:49:37] only had her own testimony
[1:49:39] no one else had seen the angel at that
[1:49:41] time no one else was there when the
[1:49:43] angel told her what her name was how you
[1:49:46] know told her you know that she's going
[1:49:48] to marry Joseph and all these different
[1:49:49] things
[1:49:51] it was only her testimony
[1:49:52] yes and her testimony did not make her
[1:49:54] popular
[1:49:56] amen her testimony didn't make her
[1:49:58] popular Joseph it says in Matthew you
[1:50:01] know the start of Matthew
[1:50:03] he was going to put it away privately
[1:50:06] you know because how could how could you
[1:50:09] believe you imagine that you're going to
[1:50:10] get married hadn't known each other
[1:50:13] and then
[1:50:14] she comes with says honey I'm pregnant
[1:50:18] you know your heart would just drop like
[1:50:20] a stone like a lid a lead balloon how
[1:50:24] did this happen
[1:50:25] you know because normally you ask that
[1:50:27] because there's a whoever the guy did it
[1:50:28] you're going to string him up
[1:50:30] amen but then but then she said the
[1:50:32] angel Gabriel appeared to me and said
[1:50:34] you're going to have the promise you
[1:50:35] know promised Messiah and it's a he was
[1:50:38] he was he was singing because he loved
[1:50:40] her
[1:50:41] but he said he just it was just too
[1:50:43] fantastic how could it be right and so
[1:50:45] that's why he was going to put it away
[1:50:47] and then gay then the angel visited him
[1:50:49] in a dream but now so now they have a
[1:50:52] testimony
[1:50:54] but notice this did not make them
[1:50:55] popular
[1:50:57] because he was because the rumor went
[1:50:59] around
[1:51:00] she was pregnant before they are married
[1:51:02] or or she was in you know having an
[1:51:04] affair or saying before they got married
[1:51:05] and they just got married that that that
[1:51:07] that he would cover cover her up protect
[1:51:10] her from being stoned
[1:51:12] and then so now she she had a black name
[1:51:15] she had a dark name a bad reputation and
[1:51:18] now Jesus had the same bad reputation
[1:51:20] illegitimate born
[1:51:22] amen and then and then brother bear me
[1:51:25] dramatized at you on the eighth day they
[1:51:26] circumcised and they take him into the
[1:51:28] temple and he just wrapped in swaddling
[1:51:30] clothes
[1:51:32] When They Carried him into the temple
[1:51:34] all the other woman with their fine lace
[1:51:37] you know dedication dresses or whatever
[1:51:39] they had on their babies they all
[1:51:40] separated to the other side of the room
[1:51:42] that's right because they didn't want to
[1:51:43] be associated with this one and here was
[1:51:46] The Lord Of Glory now
[1:51:48] here was God's perfect lamb and coming
[1:51:50] to the temple to be dedicated right and
[1:51:53] these other ones didn't want anything to
[1:51:54] do with them
[1:51:56] amen but it's so beautiful because even
[1:51:58] in those conditions
[1:52:00] God still leads his children to find
[1:52:02] amen amen and then and then there was
[1:52:06] I think it was Simon
[1:52:08] there and I can't uh just think his name
[1:52:11] there but it's the start of start of
[1:52:13] Luke there
[1:52:14] where where they come into coming to the
[1:52:16] temples and Simon he you know the Lord
[1:52:19] had told him the Lord had told him that
[1:52:21] he shall see the Lord's Christ before he
[1:52:23] dies that's right yeah no doubt that
[1:52:25] didn't make him popular either
[1:52:27] man it's gone a bit you know he's got a
[1:52:28] bit funny and his his religion been
[1:52:30] reading the Bible too much and he's just
[1:52:32] taking a turn
[1:52:34] but God told it when God tells you
[1:52:36] something heavens and earth will pass
[1:52:38] away amen but his word will not pass
[1:52:41] away if God's commissioned you to a
[1:52:43] certain work stay true to that
[1:52:44] commission amen amen so he and then he
[1:52:47] just began to tell I'm gonna see I'm
[1:52:49] gonna see Emmanuel born I'm going to see
[1:52:52] the Lord's Christ and then so in that
[1:52:54] thing so they're in the very Temple and
[1:52:57] all the other woman there are trying to
[1:52:58] separate themselves from Mary here and
[1:53:01] in the Lord directs them
[1:53:03] straight amen and then he and he picks
[1:53:06] up the child I just love this part of
[1:53:07] this one picks up the picks up the lamb
[1:53:10] and said Lord let thy servant depart in
[1:53:12] peace amen for I've seen your you know
[1:53:15] you know I've seen the consolation of
[1:53:16] Israel and then there was blind out of
[1:53:19] the prophetess stone blind
[1:53:21] but yet she saw further than the high
[1:53:24] priest she saw further than the Bible
[1:53:26] schools she saw further than all the
[1:53:28] denominations and the Lord led her
[1:53:31] straight in that same scene amen led her
[1:53:33] straight to where the Lord was there
[1:53:35] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen God
[1:53:38] still leads his children Amen to where
[1:53:40] the word is
[1:53:42] Hallelujah I'm so glad for that God's
[1:53:44] leadership
[1:53:45] Hallelujah
[1:53:47] now he says this in um Susan Wyatt had
[1:53:50] to be Shepherds I just want to read this
[1:53:51] he says all of our schooling all their
[1:53:54] teaching and so forth was worked out uh
[1:53:58] to the worst for them it finally denied
[1:54:00] him
[1:54:01] they're very schooling that they had had
[1:54:04] for him to believe him turned around and
[1:54:07] became his most critical enemy and
[1:54:09] crucified him do you know that history
[1:54:12] repeats itself every so often it's a
[1:54:16] noted fact it could happen again right
[1:54:19] by the side of us oh you say if I'd have
[1:54:23] lived then well now I want you to know
[1:54:26] what you'd have done then look at your
[1:54:29] present State now that's right amen wow
[1:54:32] and you can see what you'd have done
[1:54:35] then because it certainly is revealing
[1:54:37] trying to believe his word and then when
[1:54:40] his word was Vindicated before their
[1:54:42] very eyes they denied the word that was
[1:54:45] made Vindication when God proved what he
[1:54:48] would do and said what he would do and
[1:54:52] proved what he would do then they'd turn
[1:54:54] around and call this man an evil spirit
[1:54:57] speak about the Lord himself which
[1:54:59] cursed them all think of what's taking
[1:55:01] place think of what caused them their
[1:55:03] training caused them not to recognize
[1:55:06] the very word made flesh in their day
[1:55:09] yes you know to me there is such a it
[1:55:12] just it just blows my mind where you
[1:55:14] think oh imagine that a whole religious
[1:55:16] system yes amen amen has been studying
[1:55:19] and claiming to look for him to come
[1:55:22] but they're very training and their
[1:55:24] knowledge and their understanding turns
[1:55:27] them against them when he does come
[1:55:29] that's incredible the yo yo John says he
[1:55:32] came to his own and his own received him
[1:55:35] not but many as received him gave them
[1:55:38] power to become the sons of God
[1:55:40] amen so he came to his own but his own
[1:55:42] didn't receive him
[1:55:44] to me it's the saddest thing it's just
[1:55:46] incredible
[1:55:48] amen and I can put it in you know I can
[1:55:51] put it the same way
[1:55:53] where
[1:55:54] if it happened back there it has
[1:55:57] happened today yes amen it sure has
[1:55:59] happened I'm sure I'm standing here this
[1:56:00] morning it has happened today amen where
[1:56:03] they're learning turn them against a
[1:56:05] very Lord of glory amen and then in the
[1:56:08] second coming they're learning in their
[1:56:10] denominational ways turn them against
[1:56:12] the Lord Of Glory wonderful
[1:56:14] amen and we can see this we can see how
[1:56:16] history repeats if you just go to
[1:56:18] Matthew 23.
[1:56:19] uh we're just going to read a portion of
[1:56:21] scripture here because Jesus is showing
[1:56:24] man we can't
[1:56:27] we can't just look at it a god of
[1:56:29] history and uh so every time I think of
[1:56:31] this it just so strikes me with brother
[1:56:32] Brown he preaches a sermon lifting him
[1:56:34] up out of History yeah and he mentions
[1:56:37] in quite a few places says what good
[1:56:39] does a god of History do to you today
[1:56:42] what good does he do he doesn't do you
[1:56:43] any good right oh he was back there in
[1:56:46] the main jar he was there with Moses oh
[1:56:48] he was there you know with Paul or
[1:56:50] irenius or Paulie couple Martin or
[1:56:52] Colombo or Luther or Wesley or you know
[1:56:54] the Pentecostal movie with brother
[1:56:55] Branham I say what good does a
[1:56:57] historical God do
[1:56:59] that's right amen you can't get warm
[1:57:01] next to a painted fire
[1:57:04] what good he doesn't do you any good
[1:57:06] sure it's good to know the testimonies
[1:57:09] and and draw from their experience of
[1:57:11] their testimonies and how they are LED
[1:57:12] yeah
[1:57:13] but if but if that is it and if you just
[1:57:16] learn yes amen if the teaching just
[1:57:19] becomes a learning and not a reality
[1:57:20] yeah where the word is actually
[1:57:22] engrafted into your soul and changes
[1:57:24] your nature what good does it do
[1:57:27] we don't want a god of History if he is
[1:57:29] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:57:31] amen well he's
[1:57:34] he is the same every way the same he's
[1:57:36] just not in his Corporal body
[1:57:38] amen says every way the same
[1:57:43] so we don't want to
[1:57:45] we don't want to say you know and that's
[1:57:47] and that's why
[1:57:48] wait let's just read this and I'll and
[1:57:50] I'll come to what I'll say so Matthew 23
[1:57:52] verse 27 he says why aren't you scrubs
[1:57:55] and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like
[1:57:58] unto why did sepulchers which indeed
[1:58:00] appear beautiful outward but are within
[1:58:03] full of Dead Man's Bones and of all
[1:58:05] uncleanness even so ye also outwardly
[1:58:08] appear righteous unto men but within ye
[1:58:10] are full of hypocrisy and iniquity wow
[1:58:13] unto you scribes and Pharisees
[1:58:15] Hypocrites because you build
[1:58:17] pardon me the tombs of the prophets and
[1:58:19] garnish the sepulchers of the righteous
[1:58:20] and say if we had been in the days of
[1:58:23] our fathers
[1:58:25] we would not have been partakers with
[1:58:28] them in the blood of the prophets
[1:58:29] wherefore ye be Witnesses unto
[1:58:32] yourselves that ye are the children of
[1:58:34] them which kill the prophets and then he
[1:58:36] says fill ye up then the measure of your
[1:58:38] fathers yes see so he's just showing
[1:58:40] history is repeating itself he said oh
[1:58:42] if we're in that they would never have
[1:58:44] done that by saying your very actions
[1:58:46] proved what you would have done in that
[1:58:48] day
[1:58:49] because history just kept every time God
[1:58:51] would send a prophet God would send a
[1:58:53] deliverer they would reject his message
[1:58:56] and you know they would they would
[1:58:58] eventually kill the man
[1:59:01] and every generation had the same
[1:59:03] problem
[1:59:06] so if God now
[1:59:09] if God was if Jesus was rejected in his
[1:59:13] first coming
[1:59:14] he has been rejected in a second coming
[1:59:16] yeah
[1:59:18] amen
[1:59:19] Hallelujah
[1:59:22] now
[1:59:26] we have a we have such an amazing time
[1:59:29] to be alive and yeah
[1:59:31] we understand
[1:59:33] the scripture has told us
[1:59:35] that the Lord would come again
[1:59:39] and we see this very clearly he says in
[1:59:42] John 14 he says behold I go to prepare a
[1:59:45] place for you and if I go to prepare a
[1:59:47] place for you I'll come again and
[1:59:49] receive it to myself that where I am not
[1:59:51] where you are but where I am you shall
[1:59:53] be also
[1:59:54] so there's this promise where God would
[1:59:56] come and receive his elected ones and we
[1:59:58] read there in first Thessalonians that
[2:00:00] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[2:00:03] we which are alive you know will be
[2:00:04] caught up together with them to meet the
[2:00:06] Lord in the air
[2:00:07] so there comes a season where this has
[2:00:10] to be fulfilled
[2:00:13] and so we understand that we are living
[2:00:15] in that season you know brother Branham
[2:00:17] you know he would you know you go to
[2:00:19] Luke 17 30 and he said yo Luke Luke
[2:00:22] chapter 17 it says it wasn't the days of
[2:00:24] Noah
[2:00:25] so shall it be when the when the son of
[2:00:27] man is revealed as it was a days of lot
[2:00:29] days of lot was Sodom and Gomorrah the
[2:00:32] world is in those conditions right it
[2:00:34] says as it shall be when the son of man
[2:00:36] is revealed well and he spoke of himself
[2:00:39] as as son of man
[2:00:41] so he's saying when the world's in this
[2:00:43] condition I'm going to be made known
[2:00:44] again I'm going to be revealed to the
[2:00:46] people amen that's what he said Remember
[2:00:48] the world is forever praising God for
[2:00:50] what he's what he's done looking forward
[2:00:53] to what he's going to do but they miss
[2:00:55] what he's doing they miss where he is
[2:00:57] presently the whole the whole world is
[2:01:00] saying oh he was born in a manger and
[2:01:02] they sing the same carols we sing and
[2:01:04] they sing and they're so thankful and we
[2:01:06] should be thankful but they just put him
[2:01:08] back in a Manger they they put him back
[2:01:11] 2000 and he died on the cross and he
[2:01:13] rose again and now we don't know what
[2:01:14] he's doing but he's coming again
[2:01:16] and they miss what he's doing
[2:01:19] if they did it in his first coming
[2:01:21] they'll do it in a second coming
[2:01:23] they'll all be trouble what does this
[2:01:25] mean what is this all about
[2:01:27] amen and here we are
[2:01:33] so
[2:01:35] without a doubt you know
[2:01:37] we you're a read here and John because
[2:01:40] the scribes and Pharisees could could
[2:01:42] identify Moses
[2:01:44] now let's go to John chapter nine
[2:01:46] I don't really want to be too long but I
[2:01:48] just wanna
[2:01:49] maybe swing this around a little bit but
[2:01:51] so John chapter nine
[2:01:57] and we're using verse 19.
[2:02:01] he says and they asked them saying is
[2:02:04] this your son no so this was a man that
[2:02:06] was born blind
[2:02:08] and then Jesus opened his eyes we're
[2:02:10] just coming halfway through the story
[2:02:11] and they asked them saying is this your
[2:02:13] son who say who say ye was born blind
[2:02:18] how then doth he now see his parents
[2:02:20] answered them and said we know that this
[2:02:22] is our son and that he was born blind
[2:02:24] but by what means he now seeth we know
[2:02:27] not or who hath opened his eyes we know
[2:02:30] not he is of age ask him he shall speak
[2:02:33] for himself
[2:02:34] these words Spike his parents because
[2:02:36] they feared the Jews for the Jews had
[2:02:38] agreed already that if any man did
[2:02:40] confess that he was Christ he should be
[2:02:42] put out of the synagogue religious
[2:02:44] pressure come on the people therefore
[2:02:46] said as parents he has of age ask him
[2:02:48] then again call they the man which was
[2:02:50] blind and said unto him give God the
[2:02:53] praise we know that this man is a sinner
[2:02:54] he answered and said whether he is a
[2:02:57] sinner or no I know not one thing I know
[2:02:59] that we're as I was blind but now I see
[2:03:01] you know the whole world they say Oh
[2:03:03] Brother Bear me went off on the end it's
[2:03:05] a cult and all these different things
[2:03:06] one thing I know I was spiritually blind
[2:03:09] but now I see I was lost and now I'm
[2:03:12] found Hallelujah I know whom I have
[2:03:15] believed I know that Jesus is not a god
[2:03:18] of History to me anymore he's a living
[2:03:20] reality every day that's the one thing I
[2:03:22] know Hallelujah
[2:03:25] amen so yeah so one thing I know and
[2:03:28] then said they again to him again what
[2:03:31] did he do to thee how opened he Thine
[2:03:34] Eyes he answered them I have told you
[2:03:36] already and you did not hear wherefore
[2:03:39] would you hear it again would you also
[2:03:40] be his disciples then they reviled him
[2:03:43] and said Thou Art his disciple but we
[2:03:46] are Moses disciple right we know what
[2:03:48] God did but you know they have no idea
[2:03:50] what he's doing
[2:03:52] as for this fellow we know not from
[2:03:55] whence he is and before this Nicodemus
[2:03:58] went to him and said we we know the
[2:04:00] other teacher come from God
[2:04:02] amen because no man can do these things
[2:04:04] unless God be with them so they had to
[2:04:06] come to a point because remember
[2:04:08] they're very study of the scripture
[2:04:11] cause them to reject him
[2:04:14] their very study of the same Bible that
[2:04:16] was prophesied he would come cause them
[2:04:18] to reject him so they had to come to a
[2:04:21] point they said what are we going to do
[2:04:22] with this Jesus called the Christ they
[2:04:24] had a council and they said we must tell
[2:04:26] the people have nothing to do with them
[2:04:27] he's he's of the devil have nothing to
[2:04:29] do with this God or sorry this man
[2:04:31] because they didn't believe he was God
[2:04:33] that's right and then that's why they
[2:04:34] say that's why they said If any man
[2:04:36] confessed he was the Christ the Messiah
[2:04:38] he's cast out of the synagogue yeah amen
[2:04:42] and you can actually see it it's
[2:04:44] incredible where you you know I saw some
[2:04:47] films on you know John whitecliffe
[2:04:49] here's the first one to translate the
[2:04:52] Bible into English this is back in like
[2:04:54] the 1300s
[2:04:56] and and then and then you see John Huss
[2:04:59] who was influenced by a White Cliff and
[2:05:01] his teachings and then he was a hundred
[2:05:03] years before Luther and then Luther you
[2:05:05] know he had the same burden to translate
[2:05:07] the word into their own language and he
[2:05:09] wanted to fix they never wanted to start
[2:05:12] a new church they wanted to fix the one
[2:05:14] they were in
[2:05:15] amen they came to their own
[2:05:18] but their own received them not and you
[2:05:20] shot you see it all the way down
[2:05:23] that people come but Jesus didn't want
[2:05:26] to start a new movement yes amen he
[2:05:29] wanted to show I'm the Fulfillment of
[2:05:30] what you've been doing right
[2:05:32] right amen that's why John he wants to
[2:05:34] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[2:05:36] children that was his commission so he
[2:05:38] wanted to turn that religious system to
[2:05:41] prepare them for the way of the Lord
[2:05:42] amen amen and it came all the way down
[2:05:45] but then it always comes to a point
[2:05:46] where where they they killed all you
[2:05:49] know they didn't kill Wyclef he died of
[2:05:51] old age but they killed us at the stake
[2:05:52] and Huss prophesied in a hundred years
[2:05:55] the same man will stand your man will
[2:05:57] stand up with the same teaching and him
[2:05:59] you'll not burn and 100 years later
[2:06:00] Luther nailed us 99 thesis on the on the
[2:06:04] on the church door amen amen and then
[2:06:08] and then the Reformation was on but then
[2:06:10] it came to a point where
[2:06:12] where they actually come to conclusion
[2:06:15] these people are of the devil because
[2:06:17] they are not agreeing with what the
[2:06:20] church teaches that's right and the
[2:06:22] people become more interested in what
[2:06:24] the church teaches them what the Bible
[2:06:25] teaches right exactly I mean you see the
[2:06:28] same thing with Lonnie jenkins's
[2:06:29] testimony if you've seen it he is there
[2:06:31] with Lutheran people very early on and
[2:06:33] and actually the pastor wanted more of
[2:06:36] God and they had a discussion and their
[2:06:39] brother Lonnie said to him I you know
[2:06:40] you know I feel there's more of the Lord
[2:06:42] out there and the pastor Lutheran Pastor
[2:06:45] said I feel the same way but I can't go
[2:06:47] out you go out and whatever you find
[2:06:49] bring back
[2:06:50] and they begin you know God began to do
[2:06:52] things in the church then they had a
[2:06:54] meeting with the governing body of the
[2:06:55] Lutheran Church
[2:06:57] and they were trying to show them out of
[2:06:58] the Bible these things are in the
[2:07:00] scripture but the but the officials of
[2:07:02] the church said we're not we're not
[2:07:04] talking about this and he brought this
[2:07:06] church papers in front of the you know
[2:07:07] on the table we're talking about this
[2:07:10] what had happened the same thing they
[2:07:12] hold on to their Church teaching more
[2:07:14] than the word amen amen and this is what
[2:07:18] they did in his first coming they held
[2:07:20] on to their teaching more than the word
[2:07:22] made flesh
[2:07:25] so now
[2:07:29] in verse 30. why hearing is a marvelous
[2:07:32] thing that ye know not from whence he is
[2:07:35] and yet he hath opened my eyes now we
[2:07:37] know that God heareth not Sinners but if
[2:07:40] any man be a worshiper of God and doeth
[2:07:42] His will he hear he him he heareth since
[2:07:46] the world began was it not her that any
[2:07:49] man opened the eyes of one that was born
[2:07:51] blind if this man were not of God he
[2:07:55] could do nothing
[2:07:56] and then they thrust them out of their
[2:07:58] presence
[2:07:59] and then and then Jesus comes his way
[2:08:01] amen and then he says here
[2:08:05] he says and then Jesus heard they cast
[2:08:08] them out and when they he had found him
[2:08:10] he said unto him thus thou believe on
[2:08:12] the Son of God remember Jesus felt so
[2:08:14] after he was kicked out Jesus found him
[2:08:16] amen amen when you're willing to burn
[2:08:20] every bridge
[2:08:21] and follow the lord then the Lord will
[2:08:23] find you there wonderful that's right
[2:08:25] Hallelujah he answered and said who is
[2:08:27] he Lord that I might believe on him and
[2:08:30] Jesus said unto him thou Hast both seen
[2:08:33] him and it is he that talketh with thee
[2:08:36] Hallelujah and he said Lord I believed
[2:08:39] and and he worshiped him amen amen
[2:08:41] hallelujah
[2:08:42] amen glory all the whole all of my
[2:08:46] family will kick me out everything he'll
[2:08:48] kick me out he won't kick you out
[2:08:51] amen just walk with the Lord whatever
[2:08:54] you do
[2:08:55] and then in John 5 verse 45 do not think
[2:08:59] that I'll accuse you to the father there
[2:09:01] is one that accuses to you even Moses
[2:09:03] and whom you trust for had ye believed
[2:09:05] Moses you would have believed me for he
[2:09:08] wrote of me but if you believe not his
[2:09:10] writings how shall you believe my words
[2:09:14] and now saying we have we are the
[2:09:16] Disciples of Moses we have Moses as our
[2:09:19] Prophet we have Moses's words but they
[2:09:21] didn't believe they didn't truly believe
[2:09:23] what Moses was saying yes amen because
[2:09:25] if they really believe what he said they
[2:09:27] would have accepted him
[2:09:29] and that's where you just come down to
[2:09:31] rubber hits the road if people can't
[2:09:33] believe the Bible
[2:09:35] really believe it how can they believe
[2:09:37] the words of a prophet amen amen because
[2:09:40] if they really believe this they believe
[2:09:42] his word because his word comes out of
[2:09:44] this
[2:09:46] amen amen
[2:09:48] Hallelujah
[2:09:49] so now
[2:09:51] we have
[2:09:53] we're living at a time of a second
[2:09:55] coming the Lord himself has descended
[2:09:57] with a shout the prophet tells at the
[2:09:59] end of his end of his life
[2:10:01] one of the last sermons he preaches on
[2:10:03] the Rapture he says this is the divine
[2:10:06] order of the Rapture he says he shall
[2:10:08] descend with a shout and the voice of
[2:10:10] the Archangel the Trump of God and all
[2:10:11] these things and he says the message is
[2:10:13] the shout yeah and then because there
[2:10:15] has to be there's a there's a mark
[2:10:17] there's such a multitude of
[2:10:19] denominations which one is God gonna
[2:10:21] take
[2:10:22] hey man is he going to take the
[2:10:24] Catholics is he going to take the
[2:10:25] Baptist are you going to take the
[2:10:26] Jehovah's Witness which one's he gonna
[2:10:29] take amen and and everyone has their own
[2:10:32] opinion and our doctors of theology say
[2:10:35] this and our doctors of theology say
[2:10:36] this you know and then so it's all like
[2:10:38] it becomes just a discussion who's right
[2:10:40] that's not how God works that's right
[2:10:43] God sends a voice upon the Earth and he
[2:10:46] vindicates that voice to prove this is
[2:10:48] me amen he did it in the days of Moses
[2:10:51] he did in the Days of Elijah
[2:10:53] I mean he did it in the Jesus Jesus said
[2:10:56] if you can't believe me believe the
[2:10:59] works because they are they which
[2:11:01] testify of me amen amen and he
[2:11:04] Vindicated Paul even decayed the church
[2:11:06] age Messengers down on the way through
[2:11:08] amen and so people say yo if you can't
[2:11:11] believe me
[2:11:12] believe the works because they are they
[2:11:14] which testify of this
[2:11:16] amen being alive and well
[2:11:20] and so now
[2:11:22] they couldn't
[2:11:24] but here we are and so we are living in
[2:11:28] the days of the Rapture amen because he
[2:11:30] said the message is the shout so he's
[2:11:32] not making you guess where you are he's
[2:11:34] saying you're living here you've arrived
[2:11:36] here amen where the messages the shout
[2:11:38] yes sir amen so he just declares that
[2:11:41] you've received the shout there's no
[2:11:43] more shout to come you've received it
[2:11:44] yes yes hallelujah amen so he's saying
[2:11:48] that and he says the Lord will do all
[2:11:50] those things as he descends
[2:11:52] I am in and then we were talking briefly
[2:11:55] you know uh uh yo is it the Bible study
[2:11:57] we talk about second Thessalonians
[2:11:58] chapter two
[2:12:00] and then we understand that this
[2:12:02] scripture speaks of us because he says
[2:12:04] now
[2:12:05] he says now we beseech you Brethren by
[2:12:08] the coming of our Lord Jesus and by our
[2:12:11] gathering together unto him
[2:12:13] amen
[2:12:14] that you soon not be soon shaken in mind
[2:12:16] or troubled neither by Spirit nor by
[2:12:19] word nor by letter as from us as that
[2:12:22] the day of Christ is at hand let no man
[2:12:24] deceive you by any means but that day
[2:12:26] shall not come except their cometh
[2:12:28] Falling Away first and there's been a
[2:12:31] falling away from from Pentecost all the
[2:12:33] way down
[2:12:34] amen there's a great falling away even
[2:12:36] today and that man of sin be revealed
[2:12:38] the Son of Perdition who oppose us and
[2:12:41] exalted himself above all that is called
[2:12:43] God or that is worshiped so that he is
[2:12:46] God sinneth in the temple of God showing
[2:12:48] himself that he is God remember ye not
[2:12:51] that when I was yet with you I told you
[2:12:53] these things
[2:12:55] now
[2:12:56] so he's saying he's saying here that
[2:13:00] there'll be a great falling away and
[2:13:01] we've seen a great falling away he said
[2:13:04] he said that this man of sin the Son of
[2:13:07] Perdition will be revealed and he's been
[2:13:09] revealed amen amen and we know where he
[2:13:11] is and we know what his daughters are
[2:13:13] doing as well I'm in the Harlot system
[2:13:15] we know what it's doing so all these
[2:13:17] things have been revealed faces now we
[2:13:20] beseech your brethren by the coming of
[2:13:21] our Lord Jesus Christ and by our
[2:13:23] gathering together unto him
[2:13:25] now he has come
[2:13:28] we understand he has come in word form
[2:13:30] he's present I'll never leave thee nor
[2:13:32] forsake thee he said he says he says
[2:13:36] that this mystery of iniquity death
[2:13:37] already work until he who now letteth
[2:13:40] will let until he be taken out of the
[2:13:42] way now to have a he now remember this
[2:13:45] is the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is
[2:13:47] present on the Earth holding back the
[2:13:49] powers of Darkness so he gathers his
[2:13:51] elective
[2:13:52] but in order for him to be here it's not
[2:13:55] a part of him it's not a partial word
[2:13:59] amen you under yeah are you following me
[2:14:01] if it was just my arm resting on the
[2:14:04] pulpit and I was the rest of me wasn't

[2:14:08] not here that's just my arm
[2:14:10] all my toenail or my foot you know it's
[2:14:13] not it's not the whole person
[2:14:14] and then when Luther came the just shall
[2:14:16] live by faith that was God in a measure
[2:14:19] but it wasn't the full restoration
[2:14:21] you see and then God has been restoring
[2:14:23] us word all the way down and then
[2:14:25] finally when the lamb takes the book and
[2:14:27] he looses the seals and he's done that
[2:14:29] amen amen he he is taking that book he's
[2:14:32] he's revealed to us the truth of of the
[2:14:35] scripture amen he's he's revealed
[2:14:37] himself in his word
[2:14:38] what does that mean it's not just his
[2:14:40] arm here anymore
[2:14:42] amen the the seals reveal Christ oh I
[2:14:46] need to know more of Jesus just listen
[2:14:47] to the message read your Bible he's
[2:14:50] being revealed amen he's been declared
[2:14:52] brother bam says my message is to tell
[2:14:55] you that he is here
[2:14:56] amen amen in spirit form he is present
[2:15:00] so we're not looking for more of him you
[2:15:02] know we have we have all of Jesus Christ
[2:15:04] amen that's right because he is he is
[2:15:07] his word yes sir amen amen so it's not
[2:15:11] part of him here so the only way that he
[2:15:13] who now willeth will let till he be
[2:15:14] taken out of the way is that the whole
[2:15:16] person's here and we understand that
[2:15:19] Moses struck the rock twice
[2:15:21] instead of calling for water he struck
[2:15:23] the rock twice and that was a shadow of
[2:15:27] when Christ would be struck amen and he
[2:15:30] was struck once at Calvary he was
[2:15:31] crucified once at Calvary but then
[2:15:33] because Moses struck the rock twice he
[2:15:35] had to be crucified again yeah
[2:15:38] well how can you crucify
[2:15:40] someone who's not here in physical form
[2:15:43] easy you take him you take his word and
[2:15:47] you say it's the devil yeah that's right
[2:15:49] and you're actually killing its
[2:15:50] influence you're crucifying him to the
[2:15:52] people once again that's right amen and
[2:15:55] then brother man when he preaches the
[2:15:57] indictment I indict this generation for
[2:15:59] the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[2:16:01] he says this could not have been done 10
[2:16:03] years ago or 50 years ago it could only
[2:16:07] be done now because he preached it after
[2:16:09] the opening of the seals
[2:16:11] workers after the opening the seals you
[2:16:13] know Christ was fully revealed amen amen
[2:16:16] so the person all of him was there and
[2:16:19] that's the only way he could be
[2:16:20] crucified is that when he's in full
[2:16:22] manifestation Hallelujah
[2:16:26] so he said back there the word has been
[2:16:28] crucified again amen amen he came to his
[2:16:33] own
[2:16:33] but his own received him not
[2:16:36] what's this talk in Bethlehem what's all
[2:16:38] this going on
[2:16:39] yeah yeah you go to the first coming the
[2:16:42] church world had no idea what was going

[2:16:50] that were not bound into those things
[2:16:52] and if they were abounded in those
[2:16:54] things the voice of God called them out
[2:16:56] Amen to where he was
[2:16:59] Hallelujah there are some people in the
[2:17:01] east
[2:17:02] we've seen us rise in the east We've
[2:17:04] Come To Worship Him
[2:17:06] there's some spiritually blind people in
[2:17:08] a church someplace or physically blind
[2:17:10] people
[2:17:12] you know like Anna the prophetess stone
[2:17:14] blind physically but spiritually she was
[2:17:16] looking she was waiting Amen in the
[2:17:18] spirit of God led her a right to where
[2:17:20] Christ was yes Hallelujah and there's

[2:17:45] generation amen hallelujah
[2:17:48] Hallelujah this is where we are that's
[2:17:50] right brother amen this is where we are
[2:17:52] this is why I thank God for this
[2:17:53] Christmas amen amen I thank him for the
[2:17:56] first one because he had to be born he
[2:17:58] had to come and purchase my salvation
[2:18:00] but I thank God in the second coming yes
[2:18:03] I mean in this time when he's come again
[2:18:05] remember we'll meet him in the air he'll
[2:18:07] physically we'll meet him in the air I
[2:18:09] mean so his coming is finished when we
[2:18:11] meet him in the year but he's already
[2:18:12] come to take us away amen he's come to
[2:18:15] take us away you think yo yo we pray God
[2:18:18] we want to talk to you where are you and
[2:18:20] all these things and he's dwelling in
[2:18:21] your soul amen he's with you even in you
[2:18:24] to the end of the world yes I feel so
[2:18:26] separated from God he says I'm with you
[2:18:28] yeah amen amen I made my Abode in you
[2:18:31] Hallelujah you're a Manger like that
[2:18:33] manger was
[2:18:34] Hallelujah
[2:18:37] describe some Pharisees they would have
[2:18:39] seen no value in a Manger yes no no
[2:18:42] scriptural no scriptural you know value
[2:18:45] in that Manger
[2:18:47] but God had God inspired a man or
[2:18:50] whoever was to create that manger
[2:18:51] because God had an idea
[2:18:54] God knew this is where my son is going
[2:18:57] to be born and then the religious world
[2:18:59] may look at you and they will
[2:19:02] you know whether you like it or not
[2:19:04] you walk down the street and they look
[2:19:07] at you look at how these people are

[2:19:16] are they doing yes and they look at you
[2:19:18] that's right
[2:19:19] and the church World puts no value upon
[2:19:21] you whatsoever that's right Hallelujah I

[2:19:35] crossed the road any any and he had a
[2:19:38] heart attack he just died in his car you
[2:19:40] know he just pulled over somebody just
[2:19:41] managed to pull over the photo he just
[2:19:43] died and then his good friend a Believer
[2:19:45] they're here to dream with that same
[2:19:47] pastor but a young man visited him in
[2:19:49] his dream

[2:19:54] of you over there
[2:19:55] amen beyond the curtain of time
[2:19:58] will you follow me that's what they said
[2:20:00] so so the pastor died and when when his
[2:20:03] friend saw him in a dream he was a young
[2:20:04] man
[2:20:05] and he had gone into Glory
[2:20:08] and then he said to the man who's who's
[2:20:10] showing the dream to well the dream I
[2:20:12] said you are thought so highly of
[2:20:14] on the other side
[2:20:16] Hallelujah and here you are and you

[2:20:27] important I'll tell you this you're
[2:20:30] highly thought of over there amen you're
[2:20:32] very highly thought of over there
[2:20:34] Hallelujah
[2:20:37] God put high value upon you
[2:20:39] amen hallelujah because he knew you're
[2:20:42] like the manger
[2:20:43] amen hallelujah amen hey God made you a
[2:20:48] certain way the world doesn't see any
[2:20:49] value in you but God prepared that
[2:20:52] manger amen God prepared you you know I
[2:20:55] was hearing a sermon and and when when I
[2:20:58] think it was Elijah or Elisha went to
[2:21:00] the widow woman the Gentile widow woman
[2:21:02] I mean and and and she was gonna she
[2:21:06] only had a little bit of oil and a
[2:21:07] little bit of meal and I'm gonna make
[2:21:10] their last last meal and then they were
[2:21:12] gonna eat it here and us and they were
[2:21:13] gonna die
[2:21:14] and he said to her make me a cake first
[2:21:18] for this so Lord the oil won't run out
[2:21:21] in the cruise we go you know the food
[2:21:23] won't run out brother Ram says that that
[2:21:25] woman
[2:21:27] she was of the same caliber as the
[2:21:30] prophet
[2:21:31] amen she was the same caliber as the
[2:21:34] prophet that's why God sent her to this
[2:21:36] Gentile woman amen hallelujah hallelujah
[2:21:40] amen his word has come to you he has
[2:21:43] come to you he has come to you yes sir
[2:21:45] amen he's revealed himself to you what's
[2:21:48] he doing he is seeing his caliber in you
[2:21:51] amen he is actually saying you're the
[2:21:53] same caliber as me
[2:21:55] it's not far-fetched one Hallelujah
[2:21:58] think about it and think about how Jesus
[2:22:00] said there are many widows in that day
[2:22:02] of Elijah yet God sent her over there to
[2:22:05] a gentile there are many lepers
[2:22:08] when when when the Syrian General came
[2:22:10] and got healed but yet he came and got
[2:22:12] healed so there are many people
[2:22:15] who had the need but yet God bypassed
[2:22:18] all them in the Sovereign in the
[2:22:20] sovereignty and he picked the ones who
[2:22:22] were the least likely
[2:22:24] to receive it and here you are yes amen
[2:22:28] here you are just think about it you
[2:22:29] know you have the scribes and Pharisees
[2:22:31] they thought now when the Messiah comes
[2:22:33] is gonna how it's going to be there's
[2:22:34] gonna be a letter come down from heaven
[2:22:36] he's going to step off the clouds he's
[2:22:38] going to reveal himself to the high
[2:22:39] priest here I am you know and you know
[2:22:41] it's all just going to work out a
[2:22:42] certain way
[2:22:44] and the message never came to them yes
[2:22:46] it came to Shepherds
[2:22:48] amen the message never came to Jerusalem
[2:22:51] it went to the east where some wise men
[2:22:53] were amen amen it wasn't revealed to the
[2:22:57] people of Temple that could see
[2:22:59] you know it was revealed to an old
[2:23:00] priest and it was revealed to a blind
[2:23:03] prophetess that's right Hallelujah
[2:23:05] and God history repeats itself again
[2:23:09] Hallelujah maybe I'll just close with
[2:23:11] this amen and that's why I thank God for
[2:23:14] this Christmas amen that he would in his
[2:23:17] choosing bypass everyone who thinks is
[2:23:20] eligible
[2:23:21] and and reveal himself to me Hallelujah
[2:23:26] I mean that Christ is not born in a
[2:23:28] manger he was but he's not there anymore
[2:23:30] amen the scripture says
[2:23:33] every Spirit or everyone that confesseth
[2:23:35] that Jesus has is come is come in flesh
