thank you very much for all your giving towards there because if he didn't give we wouldn't be able to go we had a wonderful time so thank you very much really love and appreciate you all and it's like to thank all the brothers for the construction that's going on so praise lord thank you for your Labor's as well we really appreciate it thank you amen our flight got um we got halfway across the Tasman on Friday we had to turn around so missed out on helping but anyway praise the Lord we made at home I mean you've got your Bibles handy let's just go to 1st John then we're going to go to we're going to go to the book of Matthew chapter 4 familiar piece of scripture to to us all sees this thing this then is the message which we heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin I mean let's just read that last verse again but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another that's us and God having fellowship and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin I mean let's just let's go to Matthew chapter 4 I sorry we have a bit more here if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so if we walk in the light I see the light as blood cleanses from all sin amen and if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us right but it's very this is key fellowship Scripture with God it's very important it's going to so just let's go to Matthew chapter 4 and we're going to read verses 12 down to verse 17 if you see Tufts we pray so Matthew 4 and 12 it says now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came into Alton Capernaum which is upon the Sea coast and the borders of Zebulun and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of Zebulun and the land of Nephilim by the way of the sea beyond Jordan Galilee of the of the Gentile the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which said in the region and shadow of death life has sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of God is at hand amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious father we thank you we can be in your presence this morning Lord we thank you Father that we can read your word but Lord we know that anyone can read your word but it takes you the eternal author father you moved men of old by your Holy Spirit they wrote your scripture father I pray Lord that the same anointing that came upon them to write your word would come upon us the speaker and hearer father may your word living in every heart for these every need we carry every burden that we bear Lord I pray father that you would meet every need this morning father touch every life father may we walk out of your presence changed Lord like Moses did at the burning bush Lord you transformed him there father Lord of here's a new man dear god I pray father we would be new new creations father and I pray father you'd guide our thoughts today father as we go through your word I pray father your Lord your word may be very deliberate this morning father may it be with clarity and father we want to pray for those who are not here today father may you be their portion we want to pray especially for no Elias mom and Argentina Lord she had our believers our kidney removed father I pray your race her up law to full health father Lord may there be no more cancer found in her body makes you be healthy and strong Lord even without that organ father and Jesus Christ's name we commit her into your hands and we love you we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats this morning I want to I want to dwell on a subject it's very vital as we as we read there in the scripture verse 7 there it says if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin now sure sure you know we all agree we want to be cleans from Wilson we want the blood I'm just gonna be quite deliberate this morning so if you see Boreas well this is just how it may be gonna go I just want it I don't want anyone to misunderstand what I'm saying today okay I really want you to really grasp because the scripture you know we read you know we read the Bible that's God's Word and you know in print it's not man's idea it's not a just a collection of nice sayings or things this is God expressed right and this message is God expressed okay so heaven we're gonna go into that later but now Jesus says in John 3 if you've got your scriptures handy we're just gonna go through quite a few scriptures today now in John 3 and verse 16 now some of the some of it's on PowerPoint so it's not so John 3:16 it says for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him shall not be condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because he deeds were evil for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God now first I just want to establish what does it mean to walk in the light because it sounds like a very vague kind of a phrase but it's a very definite phrase because light and the Bible's when God fulfills his word that becomes light so when the word has manifested upon the earth that is light and the people that walk in that light they actually you know the people that receive God manifesting his word in their day an hour they're walking in light right we read there in Matthew chapter chapter 4 because it said that the myth the people that said in darkness they saw great light and the light they saw was God's Word manifested here was the Messiah became flesh it went from prophecy to a reality Saul the prophecy speaking of the Messiah coming Jesus the Redeemer coming that was now become manifest as they were sitting in darkness but now light had come the wood had become fulfilled in their day an hour so they weren't sitting in darkness anymore they saw a great light now if we go to John chapter five we're gonna read about John the Baptist no one's gonna lay a bit of a foundation John five and and we're gonna read from verse 33 sees here ye sent unto John and he bear witness unto the truth but I received not testimony from men but these things I say that he might be saved he was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light now he said well hell was how was he the bright and shining light he was the he was the prophecy made manifested he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord so Isaiah God prophesied it through Isaiah and it was there for hundreds of years waiting and then finally it became manifested and Jesus says he was a bright he was a he was a burning and a shining light and you're willing for a season to rejoice in his life the people that receive God rejoiced because he was the one who's introducing the Messiah and they that received John received the scripture fulfilled received the Messiah because John pointed out the Messiah so they said oh he's the one who's good a forerunner Messiah John the Baptist they received him and then they receive Jesus because they are walking in light I mean they're walking and the word manifested in their day an hour and that is always like you know it's very easy to go through the scripture and we say well if we lived in the days of Noah we had to receive knows message otherwise we would have drowned it's very easy to say looking looking in past three E's and say well of course we would have had to get in the Ark even though they offered animal sacrifices from just outside of it and all the way down to their the blood of a lamb wouldn't work and Noah's day you had to get in the boat you had to receive as preaching you had to receive as message in order not to be drowned with the world very elementary right Moses as day you had to receive the Ministry of Moses to go into the Promised Land right you couldn't just say well I'm a circumcised Jew I'm a I'm a covenant Israelite you know I'm God's chosen people you had to receive his word you had to receive his ministry in order to walk in the light and go into the Promised Land very you say well that's obvious God doesn't change right all of those you know Moses ministry was spoken of in the scripture it became manifested in his life it became light and those who received it walked in light John's ministry was the word manifested and people rejoiced in his light now if that's the same fear and God doesn't change then it has to be the same at the end okay has to be the same at the end where God because God doesn't you know being a Christian is not just being a historian right everyone can say I believe in Jesus on Calvary but when the same God that manifested and you know died on the cross comes a manifest in our day an hour then what do you do with it right because that's the you know that's always the challenge the challenge is not to receive a historical God the challenge is to receive that God in your day that's always the challenge so and that was the problem with the scribes and Pharisees they say we're Moses disciple they could point into history we believed Moses we know his writings we believe what he did that was history but the very God that Moses spoke about was in flesh in front of him and they couldn't receive him because their traditions blinded them from what God was doing in their day an hour and they are in darkness right because jesus said if you believed Moses you would have believed me they didn't really believe Moses even though they could court the scripture they could memorize it they could debate about it you know but they didn't really believe it cuz when the God that he spoke of was now in front of them they said no this is Beelzebub of nothung to do with this man okay now there but if one sees a lot of people say they walk in the light you know we could just quote that scripture we walk in the light the light as Jesus how wonderful it is but what is it as I said it's the manifested word for your day now there is a if someone is walking in light or walking in darkness you see how they're walking preusse what they're walking in now you know let's just take it naturally because everyone would say every Christian in the world say I'm walking in the light he's the light the light of the world but how they're walking how they're walking now I'm sure we want to everyone wants to be cleansed from all sin right God puts a qualifier in here we have to walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of Jesus crisis and cleanse us from all sin we can't throw that out of the Bible that's in the Bible right we want to be cleansed from all service so we've got to walk in the light of what God is doing in our day and our now those who are walking now have you ever tried now this is just my words but let's just take it naturally have you ever tried to walk with his no where it's totally dark you know this is now I want to just go through these things because we want to look at now people who say they're walking in light will walk with God a certain way their life will show what they're in people walking in darkness will war will walk a certain way doesn't matter what you say jesus said by their fruits you shall know them so the life that is produced you will know what life isn't them by the life is being produced now you can be in your own home you can live that your entire but when you are surrounded in darkness you can't walk with confidence the way you can't win the lights on right just had the lights on you know where all the obstacles are you know where the furniture is you know where you don't stumble over things you just navigate yeah like if we for example had a fire drill right now and the lights on that's easy we will fire late everything's fine then we turn the light off and now we've got to go out you got to walk a lot more carefully right cuz you don't know where everything is now see you can take like your own home and you try and walk through it and darkness you can't walk with the confidence you do when the lights on anyone ever got up in the middle of the night kids are asleep you don't want to turn lights on you go get a drink of water you just stroll out into the kitchen you know get it get it off you go you walk careful because when you're walking in darkness you can only walk by memory right I think the eye I think the chair was there I think that was there you're only walking by memory you're not walking by sight you're not walking by Faith you just walking by what you've remembered what you've learned that's walking in darkness because you can think well I thought that was there you're walking too in the morning you'd go crash back into it it's so how did that get there I don't remember that big move and someone moves it because you're walking by memory you're walking in darkness you don't know it's there yeah people walk you can't walk by walk with God by things you remember well he used to do this you know I remember it way back in there I learned this by walking by memory something you learn right and people try and walk with with God by memory we don't walk with by memory we walk by his word as a light unto our feet right it's a light to our path and he is his word amen we're not walking by those who are walking in light and not walking by memory they know where everything is because they can see it I mean if someone moves the furniture when you're walking in darkness you will trip it up I mean you will you kick over the thing amen ever walked in darkness and stood on Lego it can be such a little thing but so much pain but if the lights on you won't stand on that piece of Lego but if you're walking in darkness you won't see it you'll stand right on the thing I don't remember that being there amen multitudes of people walk by a memory of who Jesus was 2,000 years ago they all know about the man from Galilee we have to know about the man from Galilee right but he's not back - he's not a God of history he's a God of the present right if you want the full benefits of Calvary you have to walk in the light of your day I mean if we walk in the lightest here's the light you know the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin right so if you want the full benefits of Calvary you got to walk in the light and they also learn of who he is as opposed to knowing who he is today God's known by relationship right he's not known by learning we can learn we should read the Bible listen to the message we should study but there's not the ultimate God takes that because you've got to give something God to work with just like a prayer life you know or church or whatever you gotta give something God to work with and God works with it but it's not the ultimate the end is hit when he comes down anoints that word anoints the message anoint your prayer yeah and it becomes a living reality I mean you can know all about someone but when you meet them it's very different right you can know all about your whoever in the world some celebrity but then when you're finally in their presence and meet them that's a very different kind of experience you cannot walk confidently when you're walking in darkness you have to walk with caution someone who's walking in darkness will ultimately walk and fear and they lose where they are they lose where they are they men we were flying over Brisbane last night and when we flew in the daytime you could say well there's the river the is this you can see all the landmarks and then when you're flying in darkness that's to say exactly the same flight path you fly over exactly the same things but then because you're trying to look out by a memory and see where you are you think well I think this is this and this is this and you find that you actually totally wrong because the next morning we flew over it again say no that wasn't the river no this was this and this was this and we were totally losing our bearings with of we work because we were in darkness and we're but we're trying to work out where we are by memory walking in darkness if you're in the dark and unfamiliar territory it produces fear right that produces fear you know we don't have predators in this country well four-legged ones anyway we are the kind of predators but you know if we went into Africa or say America aware of these big big land predators you know and you just go out I'm just gonna go for a walk and the bush in the nighttime you don't think you're mad you're gonna walk through the Kruger in the nighttime even in the daytime there be a bit of fear but in the dark and in the slightest break of a twig you know things you you know it can just be a little mouse or something breaking a twig but in your mind it's this big line that's gonna chew you up in a second because you're walking in darkness so everything that is unfamiliar people become paranoid and they live in fear if they're walking in darkness if you're walking in light you can see it for what it is and you're not afraid I mean so where are you walking today are you in darkness you have to agree with the light to walk in the light the light is a person right it's not an idea the light is a person Jesus is the light of the world he's the manifested word amen now if you're walking down a road in the dark and there's a hole in your path that's all I'll say if you're walking down the road and then it's light time and you see a hole in your path you're not afraid of the hole you don't get scared of the hole or the potential care there be potholes on that road of course there'd be potholes eventually on a road you'll find a pothole you'll find a crack you'll find something you can trip over but if you're walking in the light you're not afraid of the hole you're not scared of it you just keep driving you just you move around it sometimes you go through them to make sure they stay where they are you know but you're not afraid but then if you're driving down a road you know I've driven down roads with the potholes here potholes but they look a lot bigger in the dark because the moon is shining you can't see how deep it is and that and that produces a fear because what if you brake your vehicle so you know you're not if you're walking in light you're not afraid because you can see you can see in the light I want to let up I want these things to mean something I want you to think about your life and where you are we shouldn't be afraid of potholes in life or the enemy might do this oh he's out there he might do this I have you heard about it we're not here to breed fear a walk with God is not about questions and fear but did this really happen that he really say this yeh hath God said I'm not interested in the serpent and what he's trying to produce what is God producing God has said this is my word this is me brother branch stood there multitude of times you know I'm waiting for something I'm just your brother I'm waiting for him to come the angel of the Lord and those who are in the meetings they they said you didn't need him to say he's here if we knew he was there yes such a holy presence came down I mean a being stepped into the into the place everyone knew God was there but the thing is they saw the angel of the Lord they saw the miracles they saw the ministry that was far beyond and the Nixie services I want to go into it to show you what history said about it far beyond any of brother Brandon ever contemporary he didn't have any ministry parent you know the same level as him they all saw the miracles they saw the discernment they saw the vision they they knew the angel was with them but they couldn't they couldn't place a ministry in Scripture and that was where they that was their problem they couldn't see the ministry in Scripture just like the scribes and Pharisees even though John stood they said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness and they fell out there because they said tell us who you are so we can go tell them who sent us this is John chapter one are you Elijah their prophet that restoration prophet no I'm not him well who are you then I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord well he's a man placing himself in Scripture you would think that go when they went back or filled out their report or whatever they did you think they would have said you know when their boss said to them what did he say well he quoted to us I was our 40 in verse 3 you think that would have been good enough he's a man identifying himself in Scripture he knows where he is Jesus Jesus said he was the voice of one crying in the world that's Jesus said he is the one to prepare the way for him to come he identified himself in Scripture and so you think well if this man is saying he's this ministry and here he standpoints out this man Jesus of Nazareth behold the lamb of God that thanks to Anderson in the world you would think now if you had a question you think well let's just see what this Jesus does and if he is something it'll be supernaturally proof that this is him and it would go beyond the argument well he's made to be born in Bethlehem but he lives in Nazareth he was born of Bethlehem they didn't dig deep enough to see the truth of it that was their problem and dig deep enough to find the truth and they should have just sat around and they should have just watched Jesus in his ministry and they were said this man's different this is not something hatched up by because John and Jesus were I think second cousins according to the flesh you know that you know they would have said because someone to see it all this is just something these people have just hatched up to start some kind of religion but if you sit around with a neutral clod look you'd say no this is different never a man spake like this man the other men did like this man did hallelujah and that and if they want us with themselves I would say this is God this is the scripture made manifest this is light but because of the fear of the synagogue the fear of their religion the fear of their culture they stayed in darkness because they're worried about potholes it's into the path at least the life eternal there will be potholes on the road God's giving us a light that we can see them for what they are and we can just continue on if you walk in darkness and know that there's holes out there you'll be walking in fear and cautiously and your mind will be fixed on the danger and not the destination if you're in fear you'll be worried about the dangers out there amen you will not be you'll be fixed on the danger and not the destination and especially not the one who's mean to be leading you I mean if you're if you are fixed on the one who's lead if you're walking in light you will only see him right I don't worry about what the devil may do I'm not concerned it doesn't mean I just tend to blind eye and just ignore him we're not ignorant to the devil's devices we're not ignorant but yet I'm not worried about what he's doing I'm more concerned about what is my lord doing what is my Lord doing in my life what is he doing for me amen now brother brems he didn't turn on the light of 1964 sees people thinking they're walking in light the traditions of the father's the first thing you know they're walking in a glare of a light not the same light rejected the very light they claim to be worshiping his works thoroughly vindicated who he was Jesus hid himself search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me who can condemn me of sin he said who can prove that I've said anything or any claim I've made that the Heavenly Father has invented that threw me has proved to you that he was the light of the hour because of all the prophets that this Messiah should be this way and here it bloomed to life I like their phrase it bloomed to life it came to life I mean but their traditions had separated them from the real light of the word Pharisee said you cease Herodians whatever might be they got the world so gummed up like they did in all ages that they could not see the real light that put out their eyes they was used to walking in the glare Nix that'll be this tomorrow to me this will join this it'll be this will join that we find it's a false Morales Jesus is just as real today to a human heart as he ever was his power and his living presence is just as real today as it ever was hallelujah thou living by a glare of a false light now whatever you're living and will produce in your life right as I said now we shouldn't be if we're walking in darkness then it'll breed fear right if we walk in light there'd be perfect love now Jesus says in John chapter 12 verse 30 jesus answered see if this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the judgment of this world now shall the Prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he said signifying what death he should die the people answered him we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever and how saith thou the Son of Man must be lifted up who is the son of man he was the son of man in front of them then jesus said unto them yet a little while as the light with you walk while you have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth right while he have light believe in the light that ye may be children of the light these things spake Jesus and departed and did hide himself from them I mean if your children of light it means you've been birthed by the light now that light is produced in you hallelujah and that's that's the proof of the pudding now as the life that's produced out of a believer as light as the word made manifested and then amen we don't have the spirit of fear the believer does not have if you're walking in darkness you have fear right but if you walk in light you do not have fear amen Romans 8:14 says for as many as that led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God hallelujah you see God's leadership in your life according to his word you know you're a child of God that's a good indication he leads you according to his word amen for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear that word bondage means slavery we have not received the spirit of slavery into fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father hollowly that spirit of adoption is the placing of a son or a child at the family Amen those who are walking in light they've received the spirit of adoption you know who your daddy is ever father's my father my father hallelujah the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then is is of God and joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together amen if someone is fearful if someone has fear it will produce right and so but we haven't received a spirit of bondage again to fear we're not slaves I mean the believer is if you're walking in light you're not a slave right you're not you haven't received a spirit of slavery again to fear but you received a spirit of adoption hallelujah you know who you are your life says who you are I mean the life that's living out of you this message is an adoption message we'll come to it later I mean this message just to open your eyes that you would understand you're the children of God hallelujah we don't have the spirit of fear I'm no longer a slave to sin I'm not I'm not HR I'm not in fear what about what about what about I known who my believed and am persuaded here that he is able to keep that which I've committed to him against that day hallelujah now the Bible speaks of fear in different ways there is no such thing as godly fear having a real reverence right there is a godly fear there's also a fear as and being afraid but the thing is if we have been reconciled to God there is no fear anymore right if you've been reconciled to him right if you become a new creation and home amen you don't have fear because what can destroy you what can snuff your you know walk and ultimately they may burn this body you can do whatever you want with it but there's a soul in here and that soul is sealed into the kingdom hallelujah jesus said in Matthew 10 now this is the attributes of ones who walk in light we have nothing to be afraid of we have nothing to be afraid of come what may we know at whom we have belief hallelujah Matthew 10 and 28 and fear not them which kill the body but uh but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him that is able to destroy both soul and body in hell are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered I mean fear not therefore you are more valuable than many sparrows just don't fear those who can destroy the body so don't fear them be though fear him that can destroy both the soul in the body hallelujah but now if God has reconciled you you know the Bible says where once enemies of God amen where once his enemy but then there comes a point where we're no longer as enemy now if you have an enemy you fear your enemy right because you're actually working against them but then once you're reconciled this piece you don't need to figure enemy anymore right and we were his enemy he was never Arian to me we had to be reconciled in our mind right now brother brems says in the great and mighty Conqueror now this is walk in light great victories have been won many of us today can remember well the First World War this is this is priests of 1957 so many could have met date I remember when I was just a little boy I could hear the whistles blowing even the farmers of the fields stopped their horses waved their hats they scream they hollered what had happened the war was over victory was won the great economy that we were fighting for finally we had won the victory I'm thinking of this last World War I looked just across the street and when the whistles begin to blow people ran into the yards woman with their aprons on taking them off swinging them at the air bullets blew flew through the trees whistles blowed cars raced through the street people fell on their knees raised up their hands they scream they cried way because the war was over and the bless was the dear boys that was across the sea would soon be sailing home again to them what a victory what a time and what a thrill to any heart what a Jubilee that night everybody was in such a humor you could have walked into a restaurant eat walked out and not paid for it it would it would have been all right you could have asked for the next man's car it would have been alright we you could have asked what you wanted to and you would have probably got it because why the victory was won the boys were coming home it was all over and I'm thinking my brother it's it's too bad that those kind of feelings can't stay all the time but to the Christian this morning the victory is won the joy bells are ringing the war is over between God and man the victory has been won hallelujah so to the believer there's no war between God and man I mean God has reconciled man back to himself hello Luis we don't need to live in fear we don't need to walk in darkness when he's given us light another lujah i've been reconciled to god my sins have been all washed away I mean I'm not worried when I get over there is it all going to be okay it's been settled he settled my case for me hallelujah so I'm not walking in fear that's why the biggest problems people walk in darkness they think well have I done enough have I done enough have I prayed enough okay but yeah look at the religions of the world they're in darkness Catholicism you know they they they they pay money to get people out of purgatory they go on pilgrimages they rub you know walk up you know pray up steps and do all different kinds of things rub fit your kiss statues feet and do all kinds of things you say well isn't that ridiculous people are so-called Protestants do exactly the same thing with the Word of God they think of they've remembered enough studied enough tried to be good enough amen and they think well and they have no peace in the assault and they try and reconcile I've done this and I've done this and I've done this what has God done for you amen when do I meet him and it's all done because if you walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin so it's not what I've done it's what he did for me that's what matters amen it's easy to point a finger at the problem I mean at the Catholic what about everyone else they do that out of sincerity and other people they go to Bible school that are the kinds of things good works programs nothing wrong with good works but that's what they trying to be trying to find bargaining power with God because they're in darkness now the believer now has peace with God so what do we have to fear so you can Timothy why don't see open for God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind right those who walk in light do not have the spirit of fear a member of power love and a sound mind those who are in fear looking for the exit they're looking for the first glimpse yet you know someone at you you watch or you seen in the bush like a deer go through the bush or some prey animal the first you know they're just going about their life but they're they're always they see well those who have seen in Africa you know the ears of the gazelles and things they're always turning there are security mode then living in fear because they know there's a predator out there they may see mummy eating or daddy I don't know but someone they knew bad things happen to them they're no longer with us because because they were they joined this kind of Church and this is what happened it's a scarecrow and they're living in fear you're not in confidence you ever seen a lion that's afraid they just you know they're you know they live a different kind of life to something that's prey they know they're not prey they know who they are in the jungle right do you know who you are in the jungle do you know we're not some gazelle that gets chewed up by the devil who walks around like a lion right devouring who you will if you're in darkness you will be that way you're always looking for and those who and feared always jumpy looking for the first sign of danger then they're gone they're always looking for the exit I'm not looking for an exit I found the one who's guiding me I found the ship of the ship and actually found me hallelujah where have the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind amen hey first John four so uh we're just going to read a lot I want these things you know just are you enlightened darkness and not just to be associated with people in life but to be really walking in the light first John four and sixteen and we have known and have believed that the love that no and the love that God hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him he renews our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so we are in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect and love we love him because he first loved us right so he that has because fear hath torment he that loveth he that feareth is not made perfect than love right so if someone has fear they're walking in darkness they haven't made be made perfect in love fear hath torment right peace does not have for p-set love has peace amen we love him because he first loved us wherefore we receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God except ibly oh this is Hebrews 12:28 forgive me whereby we receive me a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear write godly fear as a it's a caution this is the definition it's a caution it's a religious reverence of piety right so it's not as in fear as your fear of you know we want to walk according to his word to please him yeah if you're walking in light you're more you're focused on the light and not what maybe outside the light okay walking in darkness has fear but not a godly fear those walking in light have fellowship with him we know he's going to turn it a bit those who are walking in light have fellowship with him he is their Shepherd he leads them by his word his voice right remember those who walk in darkness walk by a memory that's not walking according to us that's not walking according to a relationship those who walk in the light have a real relationship with God beyond a memory amen so now Sam's 23 verse 1 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me though I walk down through this world there may be potholes they may be snares there may be troubles I will not fear them I will not fear them because he is with me amen though I write on my staff they comfort me thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever hallelujah that's how we should be you take Saul and David Saul after the Lord left him and an evil spirit came upon him he could only be king by memory right that evil spirit was on him he was paranoid who's going to take his kingdom he was living by fear and his whole kingdom was now established by fear and intimidation but now David was walking in the light here he was anointed he knew he's going to become king he knew that God would put him on the throne one day he wasn't walking in fear I mean he knew God would put him on the throne one day hallelujah two very different King chips one and darkness one and light I trust you can you can identify with David Ayotte was Saul hey Saul was consumed who's going to take my kingdom while he is David now I'm going to destroy him you know tries to go find him a few times raises an army Joe he's all paranoid yeah we don't walk by paranoia amen Jesus says my sheep know my voice and a stranger they'll not follow Amen and I know them by name hallelujah that's someone walking in the light amen he says now I'm the Good Shepherd and I know my sheep and am known of mine as the father loveth me even side so I even so know either father I lay down my life for the Sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold him also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and they shall be of one fold and of one sheep so he's speaking now he's speaking of other ships he says they're sheep here but there's other sheep that I have right he's talking about you and I he's talking about through seven church ages there's sheep through seven church ages and they shall their my him also I must bring Amen so God was hunting them out he he hunted for you right he handed for you them also I must bring they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd so God has a voice speaking through seven Church ages amen and this and every church age lit every Church age finishes with the same phrase him that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so God is saying it's more than just having an ear he that really has a spiritual ear then let him hear what the Spirit is speaking to the church and we sit down through seven church ages God has still had light a mint and now so this is this is um so there has to be a voice in this day which will come - now John 8 John 8 and 37 says I know that you're Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you I speak that which I've seen with my father and you do that which you've seen with your father jesus saith unto them of God were your father so I just joked jump down to verse 42 if god were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word so they did not have an ear to hear what God was speaking in their generation samms 119:105 my word is a lamp unto my thigh word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path hallelujah so his word we becomes manifested it's a light amen it's not by memory right Amos three and three can two walk together except they be agreed you have to agree with the light with us word in order to walk with it yes amen and that is more than just saying you know it's more than just out of tradition accepting his word you actually have to say this is it has to be reveal to you this is God's Word it says in first Corinthians 14 and 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that are right unto you are the commandments of the Lord that's pretty bold of Paul well he just said it if your spiritual or a prophet then you we'll acknowledge the things are right unto you they are the commandments of the Lord this is 1st Corinthians 14 37c saying this is not my idea this is not my opinion this is not just because we had some kind of meeting and this is the minutes of the meeting the things I write unto you they are God's work and if you're spiritual if you actually hear if you ever hear that here's what God is saying to the church you will receive my letters as God's Word I mean even as Peter says that brother Paul writes letters the words that are hard to understand as those who are unstable they wrestle with it as they do the rest of the scriptures right so Peter already had the revelation what Paul was writing in his day was equal with the Old Testament scripture amen and those people who walked in the light received Paul's ministry they received his writings and they recognized this was God's voice to us amen and that's but as I said if how can two walk together and they say and be agreed if those are not even of all people do it today as well they take the writings of Paul and they say well that's just his idea it doesn't apply to us as a different culture it doesn't apply in this day they're not agreeing with it so how can they walk with God's Word if they're saying no this is man's idea right so they're not walking in light anymore now they've gone into darkness they meant does he have to receive it and Paul didn't make any apologies for it he said he said if if you're really spiritual you you will receive what I write as God's Word if you're spiritual this is the judgment of your spirituality if you say this is if what I writing you know imagine if we got something in this day and a man said that you think that's way off that's what Paul did in his day and the people the people had the Spirit of God had an ear to hear what the Spirit said they said this is God God has written us a letter there's not as I D he's not leaning a certain way because of how he was built or his background or as as his culture this is God speaking to us hallelujah amen why are you saying that we have a lot of scripture that is being fulfilled in this day an hour right it says in Malachi 4 let's just let's just read a bit because then we're gonna then we're gonna drive it home this is Malachi 4 and 5 behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers least I come and smite the earth with a curse right there's a prophecy this prophecy has been fulfilled amen we go to Luke 1 and 17 we're just going to read three scriptures Luke 1 and 17 this is being of John the John the Baptist ministry notices his he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children and then there's a comma and the heart of the children to the father's to speak about two different ministries Luke 1 and 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and to the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord Amen it's is turning the hearts of the father's to the children not the hearts of the children to the father's John never turned the people back to Moses law he never turned it back to the faith of the fathers he turned the hearts of the fathers of the children to a new faith that was coming which was the furtherance of Moses law right so he never he never he never established a true worship according to Moses law Amen he didn't do that he he preached the kingdom of God is coming he pointed out the Messiah that was and his preaching turn the hearts of the people from the law of the traditions to receive the Messiah right that was his ministry amen he didn't and then also John did not come before the great and dreadful day of the Lord which is the Great Tribulation because it's been two thousand years and there hasn't been a Great Tribulation yet right but he came with the spirit of Elijah it's what you saw Elijah do and Elijah do John was the same kind of Prophet wilderness preach against ungodly woman and churches and different things pointed the people back to the truth yes same characteristics as the same spirit was upon them yes amen let's go to Matthew let's go to Matthew 17 I'm just establishing that it's like we say well why are you reading these things I just want to establish that now if God has said he'd send a prophet to restore in this day then that is light for this day right and those who really received that ministry will walk and the light as he is in the light Matthew 17 and we'll go to verse 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then shall the scribes I mean sorry why didn't say the scribes that Elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things so he shall come in the future but I say to you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist see notice Jesus said he shall come and restore all things yea John didn't restore right he didn't we can go - maybe we'll go to x1 in Acts chapter 3 the disciples are still looking there asking Jesus when are you gonna restore the kingdom you know John didn't restore right if he restored all things the kingdom would have been restored in the days of ministry Jesus speaking of another coming of Elijah is in this day right let's go to x1 and verse 6 there's after the resurrection when when they therefore will come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive the but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth they're asking when are you gonna restore the kingdom it's not for you to know it's a feature e-vite right so John didn't restore all things Jesus speaking of two comings of Elijah I'm sure I'm sure that's quite clear right and then now let's go to x3 because we're still in the book of Acts and we're gonna go to verse 19 he says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and ye and he shall see in Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the times the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began so Peter is speaking of a future times of restitution of which restitution the same as restoration it's been a feature time of the times of restoration of all things now we are living in that time I mean we're living in that time where God if you go through church history it's very clear that the that the church went into the dark ages right truth was virtually blotted out but God said I will restore so now light began to shine and then God sent Luther with the just shall live by faith right he brought a lot of Catholicism with him but that was the part God began to restore that was light those that received that light now they're the blood of Jesus Christ pleased them from all sin because they now walk in life don't you stayed with the Catholic Church were in darkness and then there was a Reformation all right God begins to restore interest or you say well does that mean you have to know what all the lighters no you just go to receive it and walk in it like like brother Isaac said on Wednesday in there I believe was a masterpiece he said it's like to say same thing between a general who served in the Army 40 odd years and and a new recruit that's been there for a week you know if they died that same moment they serve the army just as well because that's all they knew they lived according to what was revealed to them right and so now Luther came out just shall live by faith then and then life begin to get bigger Wesley came young with with sanctification living a holy life that was a furtherance of the light right and now there was a challenge will the people just stay you know with with what became a denomination or would they walk further and go without walk and more of the word I meant where would you be and people receive the light it was within their gifts were restored but then there had to be at time at a full time of restoration where are people who who were a people would be restored to the full power of the book of Acts Church again I mean that they would be restored to a church with full power amen in presence of God as they had in the beginning because he was a great falling away but they had to be a restoration so people would now would be taken from from living under creeds and dogmas right but then they would return to walking with the truth of God's Word Alleluia so now God said in this day an hour that the Son of Man would be revealed as it was the days of lot Sodom and Gomorrah wasn't days of Noah go read about what happened two days of Noah so shall be when the Son of Man is revealed we're living in that day so now God is saying when you see these conditions in the earth lights gonna come immediately announced the revealing of the Son of Man so the same ministry that Jesus had would repeat again but now in a prophet I mean there will be a ministry at the end time of of a of a restoration prophet amen that we read about in Malachi that the hearts of the children returned to the faith back to the faith of the fathers again I mean and in that ministry now is the revealing of the son of man as Christ would be revealed hallelujah and that was done that the people would know that what that messenger was preaching was according to the scripture not according to man and that's why I said about the Apostle Paul if those who took it said well he's a he's a Jew anis you know he's been a Pharisee and this is why he's preaching this way and this is why he writes very kind of legal and strict and you got to know how to possess your visa with honor and all these different kind of things you know why is it so complicated well it's because he was a Pharisee and they have a lot of old tradition no it wasn't because of that you know it was because God was speaking through right it was the commandments of God so Paul when he was writing it wasn't because of his personality he was writing a certain way or you know or his upbringing it was God and it was perfectly balanced right and it's the same thing today God has seen Elijah to the earth right he wasn't leaning a certain way because of his personality I mean he wasn't preaching a certain way cuz it was upbringing it was God speaking I meant that a balance came into the church that people could actually walk according to the scripture and not according to personality of man amen and then so he's there in front of thousands of people and you can hear it on tape I trust you hear those tapes amen where God would now say you know when he said now I'm waiting for him to come then the angel of God comes down into the meeting as I said before everyone knew he was there amen him being able to call people out and and reveal things down to details but that was all done that your people would recognize this is God's doing and it wasn't done in a corner it wasn't a private thing it was a public thing hallelujah and didn't know this was done because it says in Revelations 10 and 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound all the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets right and heavenly beings heavenly angels do not preach the gospel man always preaches the gospel that's a earthly messenger that severed angel amen so he said in the days of his voice the mystery of God should be finished hallelujah and so now we are we are living in that day we are living in that day they say well what does that got to do with life because it's the reason we read those scriptures and we'd go through many more as to show you that God has interpreted as word by bringing it to pass right there's no longer prophecy but it's been manifested it's been manifested in our generation and so now if you receive it your walk and light amen if you receive your walk in light but then to reject it is to walk in darkness because all because what it is it just reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture I mean that we can have a true relationship with Jesus Christ according to his Scripture right not according to man's theology but according to a scripture amen so if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin amen you say well that's awfully kind of rigid that's God's program we had to if we were living if we were living in the days of John the Baptist and we lived up into the up into yo the book of Acts you had to receive John to receive Jesus right if you're addicted John you would have rejected Jesus you would have right and then now you receive Jesus and then now here come the apostles you had to actually receive what they were preaching you say well they just make it more complicated I just want to follow Jesus of Nazareth and I just want to sit at us feed all these things in order to do that you had to receive their preaching you had to receive their epistles right because that was the same ministry just continuing on yes you know we can we can let's go to X 18 this is a perfect example let's go to the end of X 18 now we're about to read about a man who's a converted lawyer his name's Apollo's it's read from verse 24 of acts 18 and a certain Jew named Apollo's born at Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus this man was instructed in the way the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue and when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him under them expounded unto Him the way of God more perfectly and when he was disposed to pass into acacia and brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come help their much which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the Jews and their publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ so he's a man who believes that Jesus was the Messiah but he only knows the baptism of John but he's forever and in the spirit this man's a real believer he sincere at what he's doing but he only knows the baptism of John God's moved on God's we've gone John John John has come God died the Messiah's come this man believes in the Messiah but he hasn't received and then but then he hasn't been baptized right John's baptism doesn't work anymore this minute so so now now he's a challenge he's a man he's very devout right fervent Heat he's fervent in spirit he preached he showed them from the scripture that Jesus was the Messiah he's a fundamental believer fervent and spirit but now let's see but the lights moved on season in Ex 19 and 1 and when it came to pass that while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul being passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto Him we have not so much as heard as whether there be any Holy Ghost and they said unto them under what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul and John then said Paul John Bailey baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all men were about twelve so now these people are they going to receive are they gonna say no I'm already a believer I've received Jesus's death you know I was baptized by the way to introduce the man I think that's good enough for me look look at my Christian life no they had to go beyond that they had to receive the truth of Scripture they had to walk in the light they had to walk in the light as he is in the life right and then when they did then the Holy Ghost came upon them and they manifested what what the believers did on the day of Pentecost because they begin to walk in the light right but if they said no we don't need this we're we're good enough now our faith is good enough his blood is good enough you know we don't need to receive what you're saying do they would have gone into darkness but it's easy to it's easy to say that well that was in history or what about today I mean that's why if you look at people who really believe the Ministry of brother Branham they don't fall in love with the messenger they fall in love with Jesus Christ the message hey man they love they have relationship with the shepherd they're never relationship with the one who introduced the shepherd that relationship with the shepherd is very different I mean where are people who really what was this ministry as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ he was told by the angel lord your message will forerun the second coming right and his message has fallen a second coming where people have become one with Jesus Christ hallelujah and now you look at their lives you say well you in darkness or in light well I can walk around and I'm not worried about potholes I can see this I'm not going to trip over it because I'm in light I got to turn the lights off and then I apply my trip over this thing someone moved it somewhere right you gotta look at now what is your life producing a walking in darkness and and fear well there's this pot all this person did this I've heard this this is on the Internet oh I'm not worried about those things because I see what it produces I mean I see what it makes hallelujah you become a real part a graphic you say this thing works and now if his blood cleanses us from all sin now water sin sinners unbelief right and unbelief is manifested in many different ways amen so if someone is still in darkness there's still sin manifesting their life they're still smoking drinking killing adultery whatever more living like the world you say well all that's you know John said if you love the world other things the world lover girls not even in you and your life will show what you love you know what's really in you so if
