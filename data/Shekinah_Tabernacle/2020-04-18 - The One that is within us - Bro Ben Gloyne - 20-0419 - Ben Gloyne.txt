John and chapter one and we're gonna read the first three verses then we're going to read the verse fourteen I just want to go through I'd say quite a familiar piece of scripture with us but I probably would be a blessing a minute just so let's go to st. John chapter one and we're gonna read verses one down to three they're gonna read verse fourteen and then we're going to go to first John chapter four I mean so wave your hand or say Amen when you're there hmm amen was he good to see ones video and praise a little good to see your smiling faces and appreciate the songs brother Jeremy brother Peter David amen praise the Lord you know I'm yeah I'm I'm so thankful we can meet you know even it's this way you know the Lord is still God you know he comes and visits us in our houses you know we don't need to just go to church to experience his presence and for him to change and touch us but you know as we experienced on the weekend he can come into our address he can touch us where we are I mean so let's just be expecting for the Lord to move on our hearts today I mean let's go to so st. John and chapter 1 verse 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made this drop down to verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth amen a let's turn to first John chapter 4 and we're gonna read verses 1 down to verse 3 of 1st John chapter 4 I mean who's happy to be a believer this morning amen hallelujah the Lord made us believers a me unless it's got a first John and chapter 4 we read verses 1 1 2 3 he says beloved believe not every but try the spirits we're there of God because many false prophets have gone out into the world but hereby hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come and that words those two words has come is very important and the flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of Antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even even now already it is in the world let us read verse 4 as well ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world amen let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we truly are amazed that you love us I just asking father as your word has been read Lord we no man's words can fail but your word never fails I pray Lord you're an idea word Lord anoint speaker and hearer father once again Lord wherever we are Lord on this on this country Lord Lord in this country watching this or wherever Lord your believers our Lord I pray you would anoint him O God father may we recognize Lord whose in us father I pray you'd bless the word now their speaker and hearer Lord and we love you so much just want to commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name have your way among us Lord may be so real today in our lives Lord in Jesus Christ then we ask amen amen god bless your friends you may you may have your seats so I want to if I could I you know I'd like to actually continue from what what brother John Andes was was was ministering you know over Easter time and the last service that he preached was was our eyes are open and it is Christ and if I could continue on from his thought I would like to speak about the one that is within us I mean so so I want to go and look at the spirit that the believer has has received you know this this Holy Ghost that we have received you know I you know this may be very elementary but you know if we could just recognize the one that's within us now I mean the one that said there'd be Sun Moon and stars and he believed his own word and there was some moon and stars the one who created all things is now within the believer so you know I wanted to read there from from first John four because notice it says that every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is coming flesh so he's saying so it's not saying that every spirit that confesses that he has come as in past tense but every spirit that confesseth that he is come as of God so presently in flesh now amen that that spirit is of God but every spirit that says he had that that that yo he has not come presently is not of God I mean so it's very easy any devil can say yes God was manifested in Jesus Christ I mean the the prophet of Nazareth it's very every devil can say yes historically he was there I mean but but but the devil does not want you to recognize who's in you today remember the Holy Ghost is within us is not a lesser spirit it's not some other part of your you know it's not some lesser spirits not some religious bird but it's God Himself dwelling in the soul of the believer I mean says the very God who made all things is now on us I mean we we we need to recognize who's within us I mean because because we read there in the scripture greater is within you then he that's in the world so we need to see who's the one in us and then we know the one in the world is the devil I'm in that's very that's very straightforward Amen but we need to recognize the one that's dwelling in us now the one that has come in flesh now amen you know we read there and st. John that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and all things were made by him and then we went down to verse 14 and he became flesh and dwelt among us I'll say that same word that same logos that same Christ as in flesh today and the believer amen 2000 years ago but he's he's the same God in flesh today he's put on flesh in you hallelujah amen not just not just a prophet of God but he's now in his bride amen amen I mean because remember God changes his form but the same God has still failed behind that form so we know he was you know he appeared to to Abraham in many different forms but it was the same God all the time revealing himself I mean the same God that led Israel out of Egypt as a pillar of fire by night or a cloud by day I mean that that same that same God changed form and became a man as Jesus Christ now that same God is now in you and I hallelujah amen so you know it's season so many in this day I just there's just a statement I just wrote down many in this day have diminished the Holy Ghost as some basically helpless spirit that makes people feel a bit religious amen that will just make them go to church or quite some favorite bible scriptures and some kind of like a sympathetic kind of comforter that's just kind of there and it's different to the one that was in Jesus of Nazareth I say that is scripturally an era I mean because the same God that was in Jesus of Nazareth is the same God in you you need to recognize that God is and not just in heaven but he's in you hallelujah so you know but so they try and make it that it's a different spirit that were that was in Christ amen and what we've just read that means that is an antichrist spirit it's not just some feminine part of God or saying oh we are the feminine part of God but God is in bride form today so that same God that was in the groom is now on the bride having the same one that was in Christ the man is in you hallelujah you and I amen you know because it's season seek in Corinthians five and nineteen it says to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation and so Paul him say we have received this Ministry of reconciliation so God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and that same God is with Christ is anew I mean so it's not a different dog it's not a different but there's only one God he manifests himself in different ways but there's only one God hallelujah but you know it's the same God who's in Christ reconciling the world to himself isn't here hallelujah now it's like it's like I'm just going to try and do it experience it sees them yah yah it sees in the prophecy of Joel the Gurudwara spirit out upon all flesh the same God himself into his believers now you can take the same thing soso God God so God is changing his form so you say this is just say this is God right this is God right here this is just a very crude example now this is the believer now God said on the day of Pentecost he fulfilled the word that and and Peter Quadrant that he will pour his spirit out into all fish that he will empty himself so it's like now hope they don't make a big mess here but we'll see how this goes right so he said he will empty himself into the believer so so imagine this is you I mean the blood has cleansed you the Bloods washed you I mean you no longer in the muck of the world you been cleansed your already vessel then God empties himself into you hallelujah so so what was in God is now on you the same spirit God has now dwelling in you know God doesn't go empty I mean he doesn't get less I mean he's a an exhaustible fountain right but on the day of Pentecost he came along and poured himself into a hundred twenty open ready vessels I meant any still pouring himself out today would would would make a statement here if I can just find it he says it's likethey he sees and Susan the message Elijah in 1955 he says one thing to recognize the truth one thing to recognize the truth or to seal it forever when Jesus was here on earth did he claim to be a healer no sir he said I can't do any healing at all it's my father that does the healing that dwells in me is that right he said I as the son can do nothing what did he do he was possessed with the power of God without measure remember the scripture says that the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him we have it in measures he has it without measures just let you go out in the ocean and get a spoonful of the water it's just a spoonful out of the ocean that'll be just a little gift here up to the side of him so so compared to the whole ocean it's just a little spoonful but remember the same chemicals that send the spoonful of water is the same in the whole ocean see the same just small away smaller so so all the chemical properties of the ocean is in that spoonful right so I say all the properties of the Spirit of God are now within you I mean so all of my power is what's in you right I mean is within you Amen I like everything that God is he poured into Christ and all the Cross was he poured into you the church hallelujah so everything he is as in you right it made him an amnesia that was in him but the same same properties of the spirit cause it's exactly the same spirit is now in the believer amen amen now so so the Holy Ghost is not a Lisa spirt no as I said this may be very elementary but we shouldn't we should never diminish what's within us we need to recognize what's within us I mean so so so the so first John it's here that is coming flesh so every spirit that says he has come and is come presently in flashes of God amen to that same Jesus Christ is now in flesh and you amen so present tense right now so the Holy Ghost is not elissa spirit it's not a weaker spirit it's exactly the same spirit those in Jesus it is exactly the same one they said let there be light that created all things is now in you amen hallelujah Paul would say in 2nd Corinthians 6 said and from from verses 16 and down to 18 he says and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God hello temple of the Living God how we this morning amen god hath said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people he says wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you everyone wants to be been received or wants to be received don't be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty so of the believers the Temple of the Living God I mean that in order to be his dwelling place he has to dwell in us right yeah amen it can't just be yo we can't no one's a vacant temple of Nozawa I mean is either the Spirit of God or the spirit of the devil in us I mean we have people for something right but I trusted I believe that I'm looking at people who are the Temple of the Living God in this Alleluia God Himself is dwelling in us Halloween rings great now notice he says saith the Lord Almighty now when when Jesus begin to declare hers has her seven-pole you know you're you know I'm Jesus begin to declare his deity and and and who he was - John on the Isle of Patmos he would send revelations 1 and 8 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is which was which is to come the Almighty amen so the Lord Jesus Christ was clearing that he is supreme deity gave me remember this is not a lesser part of God I mean he is God my Lord Jesus is the Lord God Almighty I mean with him in glory there's only one Almighty amen is not Minnie almighty's this one God was manifested in the man Christ Jesus and then that body was glorified that was God manifested in the flesh I mean so that is God hallelujah it's not elicit God just like the Holy Ghost is oil-less of God it is there's only one God hallelujah and that same one that led Moses and Israel out of Egypt is the same God in you hallelujah yes I mean we're to recognize this he's just changed form I mean the physical form maybe might be different Amen he was in the pillar of fire who's in the Tabernacle in the wilderness he was in many different forms in the prophets but now he's in you hallelujah glory to God is what Easter should produce I mean this is what the crosses mean to produce that the blood of God would be shed upon the earth and it would cleanse the people that God can do well and those people once again hallelujah this is what this is our Easter amen our eyes have come open we see Christ and we see it's the same one that created all things is now in you and I are lujah amen to the so brother bran would say in the Patmos vision 1960 he says the greatest of all revelations is the deity the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get the first base until you believe that that's what Peter said repent and then see the deity be baptized the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and then you'll be ready to get in the spirit I mean the first thing you have to know is that the deity of Christ I am Alpha and Omega I'm from a deceit there's no more but me I was at the beginning I'll be at the end I'm he that was which is and shall come the Almighty think of it that's what the trumpet said I mean to the greatest of all revelations is the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ he's not a Lisa God he's not another God He is God amen hallelujah this is what the bar is declares I mean you take all the way from Genesis down to Revelation as the manifestation or the unfolding of the same God hallelujah I mean so the Holy Ghost that's within us is not a little spirit ain't but as the spirit that was in Jesus Christ I mean God Himself I'm in a Matthew 28 from 18 down to 20 Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and on earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name one name you will have the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost you know it's amazing how many people just just read straight over that and they just quote but then a prophet stood in this they said now what's the name is he a baptized in the name what's the name as father a name it's not a name it's another name it's not a name as the Holy Ghost a name no it's what it is I mean it's like me I'm a father I'm a son I'm a brother I'm a New Zealander I'm many things but my name is Benjamin John Gloin right so it's just like the Lord Jesus Christ when he said baptize in the one name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he didn't say baptize in the titles of God he said baptizing in in his name name and then Peter stood on the day of Pentecost the same God that spoke in Matthew 28 was now speaking in Acts chapter 2 and said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins I mean there's no contradiction the scripture is perfect Peter just gave the interpretation of what Jesus was saying that's right teaching them teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you lo I am with you always even until the end of the world amen so God said I'll be with you I mean until the end of the world hallelujah so so if he promised you'd be with the believer he's still with the believer today you mean hey man we need to recognize the one that walked with us that's in us every day the one that we got asleep he's there in us when we wake up he's there in us hallelujah hey man glory to God you know we need to we need to recognize amen that that our Lord Jesus Christ is in us amen amen this now he would say in John 14 I hope you don't mind the reading but but but in John 14 from verse 16 to 21 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither Northam but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so Jesus amen you know Jesus saying that the Spirit of Truth that you're gonna receive he's actually with you right now who was speaking to them he was the one yeah the Spirit of Truth is the Holy Ghost himself as a spirit he's saying the world cannot see him amen the world cannot see him but you could say well you know but but they saw the man of Galilee miracles he did but but they didn't see him they didn't see the father even the disciples are show-offs the father all suffice with us and Jesus said have I been so long with you and you don't know me he said if you can't believe me believe the works sake for they know he says it's not me to do it the works as the father that dwelleth in me do it the works Alleluia and I love it when he when he spoke to Mary at the tomb and and and and Mary didn't know who he was and and even even Mary would say to say to the Lord Jesus not knowing who was you know where have you carried his body that I make take him and carry him away and then jesus said to her Mary and her eyes came open but then he said to Mary don't touch me because I have an ascended yet would I go unto my god and your God and to my father and to your father I mean so he could say the same one that said you know it's not me to do it the works but the father that dwelleth in me has it you should be able to say the same thing this life I live has not me doing the work so it's not me living this life it's my father to me it's not a different one friends hallelujah it's the same God amen but see the center of the world cannot see him and they cannot receive him but those who are not of the world see him you know many times people wrestle mi of the world am I not of the world am I am a believer my not a believer well he's a good evidence do you see him in this day right healing and miracles but his word manifested today do you see it today do you see him today you've seen him today you're not of the world amen but ye know him so we're in still in verse 17 ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you speaking of the coming of the Holy Ghost he's gonna he's with you he's standing the Spirit of Truth is in me now Jesus saying I'm with you but I'm gonna be in you hallelujah amen I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you saying the spirit of truth is going to come it's actually me I'm going to come to you you know all in the world see if me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and this is a day we say I mean Lord because you live I live also amen who's alive in Christ today a Amen at that day at that day winds that day when you receive the Holy Ghost when you become one with God at that day you shall know that I'm and my father you and me and I on you and he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them that is he that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself I mean to him that beautiful I meant as I said in the beginning he is now veiled in his bride as he was on the day of Pentecost I mean we need to recognize remember this message is a restoration message amen before we are restored back as the church was before it fell I mean before the church age you know started I mean because remember the first complaint against the Ephesian Church age was I mean but thou art fallen amen rip yo you know you have left your first love that was the complaint so they lift up position and they begin to fall I mean but there was a space of time from Pentecostal that moment I mean where they had their first love and so now the ministry of of the spirit of Elijah is always a restoration ministry human you go back to the original when Elijah the spirit of Elijah was used the first time amen it says on Mount Carmel that Elijah rebuilt the altar of the Lord so it was there it was there but it had fallen into disrepair it had been neglected it wasn't being used anymore so but so he didn't come along and build another altar but he restored the altar that was already there you know he restored the correct approach back to God it's the same thing in this hour I mean the gospel we ever received is not another gospel it's not a different gospel it is it is the original gospel mm-hmm earlier but we have been restored back to the original gospel to restoration so that's why I can say on the day of Pentecost that was God coming and Brad form you see been restored it's now God and Brad for once again because we've been restored back to amen the original hallelujah amen I'm glad we're living in the book of Acts again aren't you not just watching it happen you're part of the fulfillment hallelujah humane amen he's gone that's right he brother bran would saying the mighty God unveiled before us but in the evening time it shall be light in the evening time and no scripture can be broken and the same I so in that poured himself out quino's on the day of Pentecost promised to do the same thing in the evening time it's according to the promise hallelujah and this is where we are amen hallelujah now the scripture tells us in Colossians 2:9 from him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily omits all that God was was in Christ and then what all that Christ was is poured into the church amen now brother brown would say this is in 1949 and the deity of Jesus Christ I'm so glad this was laid out in the early part of his ministry he says the church has been brought from the cradle that's right Pentecostal rocked it down yonder a few years ago back there while the people throwed stones and made fun and laughed at but she grow to maturity now that's exactly right the errors here hallelujah that's right that's what I'm interested in to see God's church coming together now we've been beat out here beat out there but the hour is coming when God has thrown the blanket around us all to draw us in for the enemies at the gate hallelujah yes sir easy now of my people now of us people Daniel said the great things of the last days when these things come to pass my the great exploits will the people then the men of faith will do in that day and the hour has come now that when the great drama picture of God sets forth of the latter rain Joel said in the last days it shall come to pass I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy upon my handmaids and my maid servants will I pour out on my spirit and I'll show signs and the heaven above and signs in the earth below and pillars of smoke so our pillars of fire vapours of smoke it shall come to pass until the great terrible day of the Lord shall come that whosoever shall call upon them what shall be saved Jesus said in there these things that I do you shall do also and greater than this for I go unto my father hallelujah here is what is in there I mean the wood came back said if you abide in me and my word of God and you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you now we've got understand to a godless word as not to in our own human ability maintain keeping the word but here's his word right soso if his remember the word the logos became flesh a few so if you serve his word his presence his spirit abides in you I mean then ask what you will and it shall be done I mean we're gonna let our faith just just just take the brakes off let your faith just take control of your life who said God can't do Oh God that's not what I read in the scripture I mean he's still the same today I'm God doesn't work miracles person he doesn't work miracles in our homes anymore you know when we were watching the convention brother John Andes read that cried about the angel log passing through the neighborhood fulfilling his word and you've invited him into your house and then we had a glorious visitation once but many times I mean that same God came into our house I know we're in a convention someplace or just a church that same prisons that same God is with us here and we need to recognize him the same I may not just put a limitation all we need to go back to church and I'll feel the Prince of God the individual amen I'll be with you away I mean was here no but other people not was a group of young hallelujah right man he was with Daniel in the lines in a min we have to be the same way the god of Daniel the god of I meant Enoch as your God hallelujah amen brother bran would say and that say misses the deity of Jesus Christ that same power that same Christ hallelujah he says that the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost a lot of people with the Holy Ghost I mean that's right men and women it's time that we found out who we are find out and other side find out what we're packing man some little religious prayer make us quite a prophet and say well 50 years ago God did the star the same God that was in the Prophet as the same God in you I mean the revelations 10 where is he today he's at his bride to the Living God the sword that came down in the prophets hand that was the Word of God words that saw today as now in the heart of the bride in the mouths of the people and it wasn't saying promised in the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth that would have - that we pray chop the devil down and keep chomping them down Cora is the devil's on the mat keep punching him in the face hallelujah we can never be too free friends we can never be too free that is the Holy Ghost making you do things it will be in order come firing I mean let's not get old teach let's just enjoy the Lord hallelujah amen he said while here but Pentecostal will the Peter comes with two trials and didn't even believe in raising hands was a quiet place hallelujah God in the book of Acts you'll be Pentecostal hallelujah and it won't be a put-on it'll just be manifested by a spirit I mean just love the Lord I mean that same power that same Christ I'm just going to stop at the beginning because I like it I mean how do you let the fundamentalist in people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that sparked the world into existence is in those people has got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time we found out who you are is when the bride realizes what she is in the rapture will go it's not gonna recognize who we are and the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little cab down something you're not your sons and daughters I mean I god he says this he is not inhibited to you you say well I'm not worthy to be to have God in me forget what you think about yourself if you're God's chosen people you're God's chosen people he charges is always correct it's always right I mean I just receive it in the name of Jesus Christ hello yeah I mean I feel but religious hallelujah we just ought to rejoice through the rejoicing deity is not in heaven it's a new hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy you can play say the same thing about me but let me tell you something brother when you realize that Almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being lelou you he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs or bees ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but what was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down plagues everything other days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions decrease of violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword they raised it from the grave cranks the results of faith we should have an atmosphere of unbelief I mean we should confess the right thing what we see around us I mean we should confess the right thing amen no brother Jordanna she was very outstanding this from your buddy the mighty God unveiled before us this is now I was brought in them face it was caught in a man and son Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man and not an ordinary human being who was in Christ the fullness of God in the Godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word now we find out God all ages had had skin on it he God has been hid behind the veil so it's not just God and a man now it's God and men mean and I believe as I look through the gallery hello you see all your faces everything I see God in me and I see God in people I mean God is and his people once again this is what the cross was meant to achieve at least you got to recognize what God has done in my life is the achievement of Calvary hallelujah this is his purpose that's why he died on the cross not just that our sins would be forgiven only but then he would cleanse a people in dwell in them hallelujah benefices word through the ages to come hallelujah isn't why it had to be shepherds now notice he says as the father sent me so send I you I mean the father that sent him went in them to confirm the word the same Jesus that sends his people goes in the people that he sends hallelujah so we have been seed friends and the women commissioned by Almighty God go into all the world hallelujah and the God that sends you goes in you to fulfill his word Amen saying the works that I do shall you do also sure he prayed that that we might be one with him not with an organization not with a system but with one God for God in his word as one and Jesus and God was one and you and I and the word must be one I mean well how do you become one with the word the Holy Ghost that wrote the word comes in one man officious word out of your life hallelujah that's right we must be one in agreement with the word not with what somebody else is this is no private interpretation take it what it says and believe it and God will vindicate it and prove that it's right youth you think it's just for the disciples only take his word for it and try it once and see who's done that hallelujah amen and has it done what said it would do absolutely and if you get it before he'll do it again you'll find out that it'll work for you just the same as he promised yes sir I mean that's why you take you know yo you're the Apostle Peters prescription of the day of Pentecost repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ remission soon and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we found out we received it I mean the spirt that worked they booked the entire Bible is now in the believer hallelujah hallelujah I mean so we have to come to a place and recognize a man as Jesus would stand there and say I'm my father or one right there was a oneness between him and the Father they weren't two separate beings they were one now many people in the state tried to make God into three different people but if you look into history you'll see that the that that that those church fathers that actually made the Trinity doctrine they were actually influenced by Plato's ideas now Plato was a philosopher who knows who Plato us who's heard who Plato is right so Plato believes that things were always constant they weren't but but the Jewish thought if you read through the autism as God was always unfolding or revealing himself but Plato's philosophy philosophy was no everything's just constant so they said well the fathers are constant the son is a constant the Holy Ghost is a constant it's not one god unfolding himself but three separate beings right right so but we can't think that way remember the greatest revelation is that Jesus Christ is supreme deity human I mean god unfolding himself right so we can't we can't have the thought that he's just yo dis that there's three people a minister's like Burrell Bram said you know one person came to him see no you know God is one like you and your wife or one but then bro man said real simply no but you've met me but you haven't met my wife but but Jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the father it's different kind of oneness see yes it's so simple but he says for God Jesus said I am the father or one we need to come to a place where we actually say Christ and I are one amen amen I ain't gotta be made one hallelujah I mean there's that me and him are one I mean by the blood of Jesus Christ I mean by what he did for me on Calvary he took away that that that gulf that sin created a wall of partition that we would be one hallelujah that's why Paul would say you know the great mystery of of marriage husband and wife they'll become one flesh he speak about Christ and the church amen amen brother I'm seizing this other seat is not here with the shook of 1965 but when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the shucks pulls away but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullness and in its strength he's the same yesterday today and forever that's why I pray God will just soso anchor into our souls the Holy Ghost we have is not a list of God it's not a different kind of God it's not just a religious spirit but it's the crater himself was now with me yes amen Jesus would say in John 14 believeth that I not believeth I'm not that I am and the father and the father and me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me so I do yep but the father dwells in me he doeth the works right we have to what is the Holy Ghost as a spirit of the Father amen amen so the same spirit that Jesus said it's not me I'm just the man Jesus is the man of Galilee saying it's not me that do these works it's the father dwells in me dirt these works so as the father and I'm raised the dead healed the sick both pride the braid and the fishes I mean cold lasers from the grave the resurrection was there yeah that same one right he says it's not me to do it these works as the Father 12th enemy do it these works so we've got to say people may ask you how do you live this kind of life Hedy how these things done you say it's not me it's not me like I'm great something it's not me that that moves this kind of life as a spirit of the father's the Holy Ghost out of me amen really really I sang to you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than these shall he do because I go unto my father amen now we know it's not us trying to manufacture the supernatural you just say yielded and loved the Lord and when and and if he chooses to he'll anoint you to raise the dead he'll anoint you to cast the devil out remember we have standing orders mark 16 as the Standing Orders of every believer shall follow him believe it's not just the science here follow the ministry or these signs will follow the Apostles or these signs will follow the Prophet these signs shall follow them that believe I'm looking down you know Hawaii believers he he doing good mark 16 orders hallelujah Amen and you don't have to manufacture it just walk with God and you'll see him live I mean you'll see a trail behind you of God loving I'm in now brother Branham would say in the Pergamon church ages from the church age book he sees now then this word that he left behind on the printed pages as part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit filled life he said that his word was life John 6:63 the be power verse but that is exactly what he is John 14:6 s I'm the way the truth and the life Romans 8 and 9 the be part if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he's none of hers there it is he is spirit and his life that is exactly what the world that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man and faith takes that word into us heart and place it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man it man I'm looking at these people guru I'm talking you know when I read this you say he's talking about me today you mean where the spirit filled this is you maybe you got to recognize he that greater is He that is in you that he sits in the world I mean when a spirit filled amen he says when a spirit born spirit filled man I say man or woman in faith that's why you got always believe the word never have a question never let the devil put a question on the word I can it still happen does he really do a supernatural healing does he heal does he really give the Holy Ghost the same get that out of your mind mm-hmm that's the devil trying to put doubt or unbelief into you I mean get rid of those thoughts right away I mean so you got to see a spiritual man and faith takes that word unto us heart and place it upon his lips that's the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man in it now that's not us praying about what we want its yielding ourselves to the Spirit of God that God praise what he wants prayed recognize now how does God get a manifest his word upon this earth it's bright it's through his bride in the sour a mess not for some just some big ministry to do something that's for you the would have benefits through your life hallelujah if the church he says way back there in the Third Age had only held onto the revelation of the Living Word and the amidst the power of God would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word and faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in hermits again amen and they are the wonderful acts of God our endowments again we have returned to this is where we're arrive to a man I mean we're not looking for it to come it's already here yes hallelujah amen so just let faith have a perfect work in our lives hallelujah now I'm just going to read a bit more this is from the lady I see in church age where where it says revelations 3 it's the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't exactly mean as they sound to us just taking him the way they sound has made some people and he says in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God make him Lord and Godhead then this first creation crowded all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he is the beginner or the author of the creation of God now we know for a surety that Jesus is God very God he's the crater john 1 and 3 says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it said in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth also it says in Exodus 20 and 11 for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation surely we can see that what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God how could God be created when he himself is the creator but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he is standing there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride demon as the Spirit of God he came down and created and Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last Adam FM Allah said lo a body hast thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided that body Mary was a human incubator and she carried the Holy child and brought him to birth that was a god man he was the son of God he was of the new creation man and guard meat and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead and in all things he might have the preeminence 2nd Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that through man was of the old old order of creation now in union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2 and 10 for we are his workmanship created in union with Christ Jesus unto good works Ephesians 4 and 24 and that he put on the new man after words God is created and righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over alone hello hello hallelujah amen that it is not nor as it nor it could be called see this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is a new creation it is not another creation I mean sorry it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the ways of flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue called the Isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God that created creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God this was as purpose this purpose took form through election I read all that does it you can see we're not a patched-up creation I mean we're not just like a big open sore with a bandaid on us I mean but we are we have been made new again I mean all all things have passed away all things have become new I mean we are a new creation in Christ hallelujah amen amen so so Jesus was not elissa God God did not create God a me or create a God amen but Jesus was the author of the creation hallelujah even now there's one thing week now I'm just going to close with this thought it's the same God that conquered hell death and the grave isn't us I mean but nothing could stop him from Genesis all the way down through the book of Revelation I mean it is God being victorious all the way through it's not God being defeated even through the dark ages with the church had to die under persecution and then the other dark ages came that was not the church being defeated that was part of God's program admit and all the way even through the Dark Ages when there's just a very small bit of life they will still God's believers all the way down through those times nine hundred years God still had children and God still lived in a measure amen amen God being defeated there I made under under the Antichrist burn but it was actually all part of God's program and it's a now has been God victorious always remember he's the mighty Conqueror he's a man of war I mean he's a god of victory amen hallelujah so now remember Jesus we need died on Calvary me about this is actually a sign of victory can we see our hands maybe this is a sign of defeat but this is not a sign of defeat this is a sign of victory amen remember when the children of Israel were battling and God just said to Moses if you have your hands up one but as soon as they go down there begin to love Hey thanks he held Moses hands up and this was a sign of victory they raised they mean they were defeated without defeating a physical flow I mean in our conquering him and they win Samson Samson Kemeny and his eyes were out and he told the little boy when he came into the temple put my hands against the pillars hallelujah and they began to push I mean this is a sign of victory how they his hands a residence of pillars and he pushed his strength returned his pride once were Lord once more any push any one the greatest victory of his life he Philistines in his death he did his entire life why it was a sign of victory hallelujah win he carried the gates of gazer on his shoulders his hands raised holding the gates and the gate couldn't hold me carried all the way up the hill that day only showing a physical gate couldn't hold him now that was just in the natural but in the supernatural in the son of gods hands were raised and they're pinned to the crust like this and we know they didn't need to be now that he would have held them they gladly I mean this was a sign of victory he wasn't just conquering your physical food but every enemy in Hell death and the grave Amen was conquered that day when his hands were raised and he won the greatest victory aiming for mankind ha Lisa wasn't a it wasn't a defeat it was a victory same thing when we raise our hands always said look take my life and make it mine it's a victory we're overcoming hallelujah we'll be victorious Laurie I mean to never think I you know this is victory right here lord I give up what I surrender the high to myself Lord I surrender that complex that pain that hurt hallelujah you're overcoming your victorious brother man would say and and I seed all that because remember he conquered hell death and the grave death could not hold him the grave couldn't keep him no devil could stop him hallelujah he conquered everything that could be conquered and he rose up triumphant now brother burns says in the message how can I overcome in 1963 he says overcome means to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks it means how you overcome amen to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and that's why we have an eagle anointing in this hour and then we can see from eternity to eternity we can see what the devil is doing all the way through Amen that's why season you know Isaiah 14 yo it says that you're the devil he says I'll see myself on high but God says I'll bring you to the sides of the pit it says and they that see thee shall narrowly look upon me and say well sister man they did this week in the nations that says they that see him we've seen him in this day right hallelujah is this really the guy that did all this I mean so as to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that I mean there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that so there's our overcome one step to overcoming not seven or five one you must recognize that the God that's in you is greater and mightier than here's the one that's in you has all ready let's say already already overcome him I mean it says not all these a big contest and maybe let's say you have God and Satan or God or Satan will win oh god dirty overcome him he has already overcome him and by His grace you know more than a match for him amen there's real overcoming when you recognize you look back saying I'm doing this and I'm doing that see people always look at their performance I'm praying enough I'm reading enough I'm dressing extra whatever and you know I'm quoting enough and I'm doing all these things you look back in time doing this and I'm doing that we're not then you're defeated I mean when you run you can't overcome a supernatural devil by natural works don't I mean how can you overcome a supernatural devil by your natural works of your flesh can do that the other way you can overcome the devil is by supernatural faith that's in you mmm amen so he says when you do it well I'm doing this and I'm doing that then you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you've overcome hallelujah and you know that he's a devil you can't say I've got sickness and I don't believe it's a sickness are you is this a sickness you got cancer you don't own you don't believe it's a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer but remember greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world just realize that the Holy Spirit descending you has already overcome this thing he's in you and you can overcome by him brother man says that's exactly sensible that's exactly the way the scripture is written overcoming so if you want to be a sensible believer who ought to be sensible believer today you've got to recognize that the one that's in you has already overcome that thing it's already overcome covered 19 it's already yes like every devil this has been named and has not been named yet by man God's already overcome recognize friends I'll just I'll just wrap this up real quick we have to recognize Jesus Christ is come in flesh okay presently No has come in the past only but is coming flesh that confesseth that Jesus Christ is not coming flesh is the Antichrist human people say yeah but the Holy Ghost present different kind of spirit no no it's the same one same mother was the Word made flesh 2000 years ago is the same one who has made he's made his Word made flesh and you now yes hallelujah it's that same one that made Sun Moon and stars is in you today the creator of heavens and earth is in you amen hallelujah and we live listen Paul said the food the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God so remember God had to believe his own word when he said let there be Sun Moon and stars brother I said and he believed his own word and it became material rights to the faith that created all things is now the faith we live by I'll say how is that I just I just accept it if I was you have to be a believer and believe that God is and love him and worship everyone live for him that's the same faith that made all things amen hallelujah so we've got to recognize remember our eyes have come open it's Christ and now we see who Christ is and he's in you hallelujah amen we'll push you around you say oh don't say oh you know remember we're not gonna survive yeah I mean this may sound wrong but we're not going to survive lady or seer we're gonna overcome we're not just watching the calendar tick down we're a day closer to the rapture try and survive and hunt away and try and survive it and you know Oh where'd a car so we survived another day hallelujah we said oh no we're walking with God in Satan's Edom I mean we're walking we're overcoming in this way and God has confidence in you I mean that you'll overcome the thing don't just hunker in your bunker and say oh you know coming in the Laurel tightener just walk with God I mean what was God be happy rejoice I mean give glory to our Lord Jesus because he's already and he's already overcome all things greater is within you he that's in the world I mean siliceous bow he's in a
