[48:15] Australia and New Zealand their national
[48:18] identity was formed because of World War
[48:20] one and the battles they fought so
[48:22] Gallipoli we we know in this country is
[48:24] a important you know they call it the
[48:26] birth of the Anzac of the of the New
[48:29] Zealand Australian identity and you know
[48:32] the Canadians have the Battle of Vimy
[48:33] Ridge in different battles as well of
[48:35] May and they they use those as part of
[48:38] the forming of a national identity where
[48:40] people were no longer identified just
[48:43] with Great Britain us as just a colony
[48:45] but they were actually begin to inform
[48:46] their own identity because of the
[48:48] battles now if a nation can be formed
[48:52] out of just natural battles that have
[48:53] been fought how much more the bride of
[48:56] Jesus
[48:57] Christ where our identity has been
[49:00] formed and fashioned because of battles
[49:03] and victories that have been won I mean
[49:06] so so can conform their identity around
[49:09] battles that were fought a hundred years
[49:11] ago how much more the kingdom of God the
[49:14] bride of Jesus Christ we're not a
[49:15] hundred years ago but 2,000 years ago
[49:18] the King of glory won the greatest
[49:20] victory conquering hell death and the
[49:22] grave and rose triumph hallelujah and we
[49:26] know we can bring that even and today
[49:27] the victories that we have won that
[49:29] through us through the bride the great
[49:32] victories that God has one through his
[49:34] bride and it forms our identity this is
[49:37] these are the battles we fought where
[49:38] the devil was cast out and and people
[49:40] came free and the word became open and
[49:43] and a people rose to their position in
[49:45] Christ and they become to realize
[49:47] they're not slaves of the devil they
[49:48] don't belong to him but they the Bride
[49:50] of Christ that they're by a new birth
[49:52] that identifies us as his bride as part
[49:54] of himself hallelujah we can rise when
[49:57] you say this is our identity as the
[49:59] Living Word of God has put on flesh in
[50:01] us and this is who we are
[50:03] right so I'm not just when I talk about
[50:05] well what I'm not trying to raise up
[50:07] some nationalism national spirit but I'm
[50:09] trying to say if they can fashion if
[50:11] this country is fashioned on those
[50:12] battles how much more the bride on our
[50:15] battle and what we have won and what he
[50:17] has done for us
[50:19] hallelujah now brother Bram sees in the
[50:22] in the oneness of unity 1958 and he uses
[50:26] this story you're in a few places but
[50:29] but he says in the world today my
[50:31] friends is wanting to see people that's
[50:33] United with Christ to display the
[50:36] genuine Spirit of Christ gallant heroes
[50:38] and closing I might say the world is one
[50:41] to see heroes they honor heroes that's
[50:43] good the old saying is that cowards die
[50:45] a million times while the hero never
[50:47] dies there's a story that comes to mind
[50:49] and I'd like to quote a few just for a
[50:51] few moments the story over here there's
[50:54] too often forgotten many of you mean my
[50:56] age and you woman you'll remember well
[50:58] in our school books and it was many
[51:01] years ago in Switzerland the little
[51:03] Swiss people had went up in the
[51:06] mountains build themselves some houses
[51:08] that had their own economics and so
[51:10] forth a little
[51:11] and they love them there wasn't a
[51:13] warring people they were peaceful and
[51:14] all at once one time coming to
[51:16] Switzerland a great powerful army and
[51:18] they were well-trained men just sitting
[51:21] like them Sikhs they're like a great
[51:22] brick wall great shields great spears
[51:25] well-trained war men and they come
[51:27] marching into Switzerland to take what
[51:29] the Swiss had and the and the Swiss to
[51:32] guard their homes kissed their wives
[51:33] goodbye and their children and their
[51:36] babies and they took old pieces of
[51:37] sickle blades rocks and stones great big
[51:40] clubs went out in the valley to meet the
[51:42] oncoming army and when they got gathered
[51:45] out there just a little bitty handful of
[51:46] men and all around them was a great
[51:49] marching army what could they do
[51:51] they stood hopeless helpless when
[51:53] looking as the other they were licked
[51:55] there was no way around it they were
[51:57] finished after a while there was a man
[51:59] by the name of arnold von wiggler he
[52:02] stepped out and said my men of
[52:04] Switzerland
[52:05] over across the mountains lies a little
[52:07] white home where my wife and three
[52:10] children wait when I kissed them goodbye
[52:13] this morning I'd never seen them again I
[52:15] know I'd never seen them again on this
[52:16] earth they said arnold von we're glad
[52:18] what do you look what are you going to
[52:20] do he says this they are divers
[52:22] whistling well they say Arnold that will
[52:27] do no good why did you say you'll die
[52:31] for Switzerland he said I take you take
[52:33] what you got plowshares little old stick
[52:36] sickles and sticks rocks and clubs you
[52:39] follow me you fight the best you can
[52:41] with what you got said what will you do
[52:44] he threw down a sickle the thing he was
[52:47] going to fight with he raised up his
[52:48] hands he screamed to that great great
[52:50] big army he looked around he saw where
[52:53] the thicker Spears was just everyone in
[52:56] uniform a number marching them right and
[52:58] get them against the mountain on and on
[53:01] that's the way the devil does marching
[53:03] them right into a corner he raised his
[53:05] hands he screen make way for liberty and
[53:07] the oncoming army wondered what and he
[53:10] started running he screamed again make
[53:11] way for Liberty and when he got right
[53:13] into that those big bunch of Spears
[53:15] where many pointed to catch him he
[53:18] grabbed his arms out like this grabbed a
[53:20] whole full arm arm full of spears eand
[53:22] and he threw them into his bosom
[53:24] such a display of real heroes that upset
[53:26] their big army and it routed them here
[53:29] comes the Swiss with clubs and sticks
[53:30] and beat the army out of their nation
[53:32] and they've never had a war from that
[53:34] time to this because one man played the
[53:36] part of the hero and did what was right
[53:38] it's never been exceeded and very seldom
[53:40] compared with such a heroism but oh
[53:42] that's such a little thing till one day
[53:45] many years ago when Adams children the
[53:47] race of this world was backed into a
[53:48] corner with sickness disease and sin
[53:51] they had been sent prophets and they
[53:53] killed them they had all kinds of laws
[53:54] and refused them and an Adam's race was
[53:57] backed into a corner there was one who
[53:59] stepped out of him and said I'm going
[54:01] down to earth this day to give my life
[54:03] he was found where the thickest and the
[54:05] dots was the fears of Adams race was
[54:08] death he grabbed death he went to
[54:10] Calvary he pulled it into his bosom
[54:11] hallelujah and he and he told his
[54:14] disciples empty out now go yonder wait
[54:17] up yonder till I send you back something
[54:19] to fight worth he says blessed be the
[54:21] name of the Lord he said the Holy Spirit
[54:24] said follow me
[54:24] cat sin and sickness to the wall men and
[54:27] women the greatest thing that's ever
[54:28] been given to the Church of God is not
[54:30] to hold some ecclesiastical paper in
[54:32] your hand
[54:33] but as to be filled with God's holy
[54:35] spirit to cut the kingdom of the devil
[54:37] until our chief captain comes to take
[54:39] over god bless you don't think I'm
[54:41] beside myself as true I know what I talk

[54:56] like a coward why do we stand on the
[54:58] sidelines let's follow the captain let's
[55:01] follow him that went to Calvary when he
[55:03] went to Calvary he was wounded for our
[55:04] transgressions with the stripes we were
[55:06] healed

[55:09] sickness and sin fight unbelief away
[55:11] tell the devil is a liar Christ said he
[55:14] has overcome the world greater is He
[55:16] that send you that he that's in the
[55:17] world greater as the power of Christ in
[55:20] you than that sickness that's in your
[55:22] body tonight greater is the power of
[55:24] Christ and that little bus hitting sin
[55:27] that you can't overcome let's take the
[55:29] Holy Spirit and fight the devil down
[55:31] walk out victorious hearers of the cross
[55:34] hallelujah amen gunfight was what you
[55:37] got

[55:40] come back yonder and give us something
[55:42] to fight with we have it we have the
[55:44] weapon and then we have the living
[55:46] anointed word for the stay it's in our
[55:48] possession
[55:49] hallelujah swishin just sit back we
[55:51] should press on I mean we should take
[55:53] the devil
[55:54] I mean cast them out of every part of
[55:56] our lives we'd have to put up with them
[55:58] in any unbelief has to go you fight that
[56:00] unbelief you fight that doubt you fight
[56:02] that reasoning you cast it out of your
[56:04] life hallelujah we don't have to put up
[56:07] with it I mean if a bunch of Swiss
[56:09] standing there for their homeland could
[56:11] say I'm going to go die for Switzerland
[56:12] hallelujah and they defeat I think as
[56:14] the Austrian army at the time but your
[56:16] farmers stood there hallelujah they said
[56:19] this is my land I'm not leading us
[56:21] invader coming how much more people we
[56:23] have a land we have a language being
[56:26] returned through the word of the Living
[56:27] God hallelujah the devil tries to come
[56:30] against you take your family away you
[56:31] say no I'm not going to put up with his
[56:34] lies put up with us deceit but with what
[56:36] you have and kill every enemy that comes
[56:39] against you hallelujah amen that's what
[56:45] we're going to do friends we shouldn't
[56:48] be we should not you know our Lord Jesus
[56:53] we know him as kinsman redeemer he's our
[56:55] kinsman he became flesh he become became
[56:58] one of us to fulfill the law of kinsman
[57:00] redeemer where if someone and a family
[57:03] had been had to sell themselves into
[57:04] slavery thereand debt or whatever it was
[57:06] then someone of the family could come
[57:08] and redeem them they could purchase
[57:10] their deliverance their their freedom
[57:12] and so our Lord Jesus became one of us
[57:15] he became one of us he became a man
[57:17] hallelujah amen and he came he paid the
[57:20] debt that we could not pay amen he paid
[57:23] it on Calvary to set us free so that's
[57:25] one part of the kinsman's work but
[57:27] there's another part of the kinsman's
[57:28] work where I think that we neglect as
[57:30] the kinsmen of India I mean we're here
[57:33] where a kinsman has the right to avenge
[57:36] you know avenge upon if someone came and
[57:39] say murdered one of my family then I
[57:41] have the right as kinsman Avenger to to
[57:44] deal with that enemy
[57:45] I have the right and and our Lord Jesus
[57:48] says that those who who cry out day and
[57:51] night before their God will he not come
[57:53] and avenge them speedily amen we he's
[57:56] our kinsman redeemer he's our kinsman
[57:59] Avenger I mean when we cannot defeat the
[58:01] devil when we cannot cast them out when
[58:03] we cannot overcome even our own self he
[58:05] comes down and undertakes for us for the
[58:08] Lewis I think we've got to call upon our
[58:10] kinsman Avenger or God cast us enemy or
[58:13] God restore my face or God deliver my
[58:16] family

[58:50] have through my safe win with what they
[58:51] had and they killed them all hallelujah
[58:55] fight with what you got anything in the
[58:59] hands of God God will meet will will
[59:02] meet the challenge of the enemy and
[59:03] defeat him with what you have
[59:05] hallelujah now we have escaped the stare
[59:09] of the enemy daresay we read about the
[59:14] about the living bird that was that was
[59:17] dipped you know so the mate was killed
[59:19] and then and in the living mate was was
[59:23] was dipped in you know the hyssop and
[59:25] the scallop were you on the cedar and
[59:26] the and and the blood of the of the mate
[59:29] and him was released to to to fly loose
[59:34] into an open field now we we know I'm
[59:37] sure very quickly from reading that that
[59:39] we realize our did make was the Lord
[59:40] Jesus Christ and and the bride has been
[59:43] dipped in his blood I mean that the
[59:46] living word that the life wasn't in him
[59:48] is now in her right and then now the
[59:51] bride has been flying for for seven
[59:53] church ages over the over the world with
[59:56] his life
[59:58] this freedom this Liberty I'm in this
[1:00:01] there's redemption this healing this
[1:00:03] restoration hallelujah and the greatest
[1:00:07] thing is now but the devil he he is the
[1:00:10] he is the Fowler that tries to catch the
[1:00:13] catch the bird with a snare right so he
[1:00:17] tries to and and this is what he wants
[1:00:19] to do he wants to design a snare that
[1:00:22] will kill its prey and we know the
[1:00:24] ultimate sneer that he made was death
[1:00:26] hallelujah I mean the ultimate steer and
[1:00:29] we're bored and it's sin that produces
[1:00:32] death and we're born and sin right we
[1:00:35] don't become sin as we were born sinners
[1:00:37] we were born lost you don't need to
[1:00:39] train a child to lie you don't need to
[1:00:41] teach them to steal or deceive it's just
[1:00:44] in them because it's for the nature
[1:00:46] already enter people right and so now so
[1:00:50] we are in that snare we're born in that
[1:00:52] snare but the Lord Jesus comes and
[1:00:56] breaks the snare of death practice near
[1:00:58] of unbelief hallelujah that our souls
[1:01:00] have escaped as a bird out of a snare
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:05] so now we are now free we are now free
[1:01:09] the program says of the great speckled
[1:01:12] bird that we worried about well let's
[1:01:13] just read let's go to Jeremiah 12 if you
[1:01:15] want to follow me Jeremiah speaks of the
[1:01:19] speckled bird which is the one I believe
[1:01:22] we just read about he sees in Jeremiah
[1:01:31] 12 7 and just just down to 9 he says
[1:01:40] I've forsaken so I don't have this on
[1:01:43] over here I have forsaken my house
[1:01:45] I've left my heritage I have given the
[1:01:49] dearly beloved of my soul into the hands
[1:01:51] of her enemies my heritage is as unto a
[1:01:54] lion in the forest that cries out
[1:01:56] against me therefore have I hated it my
[1:01:58] heritage is unto me as a speckled bird
[1:02:01] the birds round a round about our
[1:02:05] against her come here cymbal all the
[1:02:07] beasts of the field come to devour
[1:02:10] so the
[1:02:11] how the brightest looked at as a
[1:02:12] speckled bird where there's the enemy
[1:02:14] has assembled around her to to to devour
[1:02:18] her now we are living in a day where
[1:02:23] we're the Bride of Christ is flying
[1:02:26] right the bride is flying this great
[1:02:30] speckled bird is flying but there's also
[1:02:33] as we just read this more than just you
[1:02:37] know just like a natural just like in
[1:02:38] nature there's not just doves this crows
[1:02:40] these Magpies there's all different
[1:02:42] kinds of animal your birds but God is
[1:02:46] looking for heavenly dove because he
[1:02:48] because he because he identified himself
[1:02:50] as a dove and a dove Mary's a dove just
[1:02:53] like a lamb you know a sheep you know a
[1:02:55] sheep Mary sheep you know like Mary like
[1:02:57] so he's looking for a group of people
[1:03:00] that are this great speckled bird
[1:03:02] there's been speckled by his blood that
[1:03:05] has life is now in her now in
[1:03:08] Revelations 18 I'm probably jumping
[1:03:10] around a bit but let's go to revelations
[1:03:12] 18 because there's a cage in this earth
[1:03:16] that that contains a lot of hateful
[1:03:20] Birds lay a bit of a foundation so so
[1:03:24] revelations 18 and one this is now after
[1:03:27] these things I saw another angel come
[1:03:30] down from heaven having great power and
[1:03:32] the earth was lightened with his glory
[1:03:34] and he cried mightily with a strong
[1:03:37] voice now we read there in verse one and
[1:03:39] after these things now in revelation 17
[1:03:42] there's identification of of the great
[1:03:45] of Revelation which we know is the
[1:03:48] Catholic Church and her daughters it's
[1:03:50] man's religion right so now he's saying
[1:03:53] so after these things I saw another
[1:03:54] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:03:56] power and the earth was lightened with
[1:03:58] his glory and he cried mightily with a
[1:04:00] loud voice saying Babylon the Great is
[1:04:02] fallen is fallen and has become the
[1:04:05] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:04:07] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[1:04:10] unclean and hateful bird so you say no
[1:04:13] this is upon the earth
[1:04:15] this this this Babylon has become a cage
[1:04:18] and in this cage is every foul spirit
[1:04:20] demon spirit right habitation of devils
[1:04:24] and a
[1:04:24] every unclean and hateful bird and that
[1:04:28] word hateful Mesa detest especially to
[1:04:30] persecute so these so so this is
[1:04:33] actually and and this keep reading and
[1:04:35] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[1:04:36] of the fauna of the wrath of her
[1:04:38] fornication and the kings of the earth
[1:04:40] have committed fornication with her and
[1:04:42] the merchants of the earth are waxed
[1:04:43] rich through the abundance of her
[1:04:45] delicacies and I heard another voice
[1:04:48] from heaven saying come out of her my
[1:04:49] people that ye be not partakers of her
[1:04:52] sins and that ye be receive not of her
[1:04:55] plagues for sin has reached unto heaven
[1:04:57] and God hath remembered her iniquities
[1:05:00] so now here's a call and this angel that
[1:05:03] came down and how having great power and
[1:05:06] the earth was lightened with his glory
[1:05:07] is the Ministry of Malachi for where the
[1:05:10] glory of the Lord has filled the earth
[1:05:11] because the Son of man has been revealed
[1:05:14] again in the same time and so now the
[1:05:16] voice saying this angel saying you know
[1:05:18] Babylon is fallen is fallen and we know
[1:05:20] that this world has fallen when the
[1:05:22] church started at Pentecost fully
[1:05:25] redeemed free people the snare was
[1:05:27] broken see the most deceptive snare on
[1:05:29] the earth is religion right it's a
[1:05:32] religious snare and so and so the church
[1:05:35] started off free but then the Antichrist
[1:05:38] spirit came in made it lukewarm and
[1:05:41] powerless and formal and it was sneered
[1:05:44] right and then so now and this has grown
[1:05:48] until it's the cage you very hateful
[1:05:50] that unclean you hateful unclean bird
[1:05:52] habitation of devils hold of every foul
[1:05:54] spirit and so but now there's a call
[1:05:59] saying it has fallen and it has fallen
[1:06:01] but in these another call come out of
[1:06:03] her my people and be not partaker of a
[1:06:05] pledge there's a call now come out from
[1:06:07] among them come out from her that you
[1:06:10] don't receive her plagues but you
[1:06:12] receive eternal life so there was a time
[1:06:14] when there this cage was upon all of us
[1:06:17] really
[1:06:18] I meant without the grace of God we
[1:06:20] would still be in the cage doesn't
[1:06:22] matter if you were raised in the message
[1:06:24] you you came out of the world or some
[1:06:25] church I'm in there had to come a time
[1:06:27] with her where the Fowler's snare was
[1:06:30] broken the cage was broken you heard a
[1:06:33] voice and you had to walk out you had to
[1:06:35] walk out even sitting in a
[1:06:37] without a real experience the Cabot omen
[1:06:39] God met you I trust when he became real
[1:06:41] to you we heard the voice behind the
[1:06:43] voice and it's not someone else's

[1:06:47] said you know the same God he knows I
[1:06:49] mean you met the same Jesus of the Bible
[1:06:52] hallelujah so now there's a voice in you
[1:06:55] and then the bride always responds to
[1:06:57] his voice there's something inner says I
[1:06:58] must go if he's called me out here I
[1:07:00] come
[1:07:01] hallelujah there's something in me Amen

[1:07:30] were pulled the head off one of the
[1:07:32] birds and drained the blood upon the
[1:07:33] other bird and the other bird was
[1:07:35] speaking with the red blood and it
[1:07:37] flopped its wings like this and the
[1:07:39] blood cried holy holy holy and it base
[1:07:41] the ground so Christ as that did mate he
[1:07:44] put his blood his blood from his life
[1:07:47] upon us carrying his blood crying holy
[1:07:50] holy unto the Lord
[1:07:51] it's an odd-looking bird sure sure

[1:08:39] know that he is the word right he is the
[1:08:41] Living Word so the bride is identified
[1:08:44] by Jesus Christ Himself manifesting any

[1:09:53] we don't need some implement infomercial
[1:09:55] for this for this message trying to
[1:09:58] pretend it does some wonder thing but
[1:09:59] when people bite it's a it's a dumb
[1:10:01] product no it does what it says it goes
[1:10:04] hallelujah so now the bride is carrying
[1:10:07] his word and she becomes his word amen
[1:10:10] so now she is now walking upon this
[1:10:13] earth or you fly however you want to use
[1:10:15] it now proclaiming Liberty for all that
[1:10:19] who will receive it
[1:10:20] hallelujah yeah it's exactly like the
[1:10:22] days worth yo-yo of Abraham Lincoln in
[1:10:25] the Civil War where the Emancipation and
[1:10:27] yet sorry the proclamation of
[1:10:29] emancipation was signed in the White
[1:10:32] House and that's the that's the that's
[1:10:34] the government signing into being that
[1:10:36] on a certain time a certain day all the
[1:10:38] slaves have to go free right and and
[1:10:41] it's like anything that the government
[1:10:43] puts in place it's in time of war there
[1:10:46] has to be a war to obtain what's what
[1:10:48] has been written right so now they had
[1:10:51] to fight just like the Declaration of
[1:10:52] Independence they they those thirteen
[1:10:55] colonies signed a signed a piece of
[1:10:57] paper saying we are free of England
[1:11:00] independent nation we're a republic but
[1:11:02] they had to fight many years of
[1:11:04] bloodshed to actually that that what was
[1:11:07] written became living right they said
[1:11:10] our free birth and I had to fight for
[1:11:11] their freedom and then they were free so
[1:11:13] what they signed became manifest in the
[1:11:15] colonies he with me right so that just
[1:11:18] like this we have received a sign I
[1:11:20] meant a signed document from heaven an
[1:11:23] open book from heaven saying that the
[1:11:25] bride is a free woman I mean she is
[1:11:27] United with Christ all things belong to
[1:11:30] her I mean the word has come open to her
[1:11:32] she has received everything Adam loves
[1:11:34] Amy in the position they had in the
[1:11:36] garden of being having dominion over
[1:11:38] everything upon the earth has been
[1:11:40] restored to her right but then there has
[1:11:42] to come a time of fighting I mean that
[1:11:46] the contents of the document become
[1:11:48] manifested right so that's why it
[1:11:50] becomes a war I mean we're where our
[1:11:52] government heaven has signed it that's
[1:11:54] come upon the earth now we need to fight
[1:11:56] for it I mean you say well but Jesus
[1:11:59] does all the work was just like Israel
[1:12:01] God said I'll give you the land they
[1:12:03] received the document on Mount Sinai I
[1:12:05] mean this is the word now this is the
[1:12:07] deed to the land right that but but they
[1:12:09] weren't even in the land they weren't
[1:12:11] there they were on Mount Sinai they had
[1:12:13] to walk to the promised land they had to
[1:12:15] cross Jordan they had to take out
[1:12:17] Jericho and AI and every different
[1:12:19] inhabited the land they had to go fight
[1:12:21] for what was theirs even though God said
[1:12:23] I give it to you but he said you go
[1:12:24] fight I mean you go take possession I
[1:12:27] mean you've got to put your you got to
[1:12:29] identify yourself with the promise why
[1:12:31] you can't just give it lip service there
[1:12:33] you got to put your faith in to say this
[1:12:35] promise is mine I mean my healing is
[1:12:38] mine my redemption is mine I'm in the
[1:12:40] salvation of my family is mine
[1:12:42] hallelujah you've got a you've got to
[1:12:44] put your hand to it hallelujah
[1:12:47] and that's with a that's where the
[1:12:50] challenge can come it's very easy to sit
[1:12:52] and talk about it but when it comes a
[1:12:55] time now you've got to pick it up now
[1:12:57] you've got our be identified with this
[1:12:59] word and you've got to possess every
[1:13:01] promise that God's given you Alleluia so
[1:13:05] the dawn came finally other civil war
[1:13:07] was over and the Emancipation the
[1:13:09] proclamation of emancipation was going
[1:13:11] to come into effect and so it door
[1:13:13] Nasser
[1:13:14] day was when the law came in we're we're
[1:13:17] we're the slaves were no longer slaves
[1:13:19] and so now here were here were they they
[1:13:22] were waiting for that morning and it was
[1:13:25] when the Sun came up was when they were
[1:13:27] free and now so the strongest ones would
[1:13:30] climb up to the top of the mountain the
[1:13:32] older ones they remember they're all
[1:13:33] slaves do but but but the older ones
[1:13:36] they couldn't climb the mountain to see
[1:13:37] the Sun come up the strong ones only the
[1:13:39] strong ones could so the strong ones ran
[1:13:41] up to the top and the young and the
[1:13:43] babies and the and the mothers may be
[1:13:45] awaiting down in the valley and they're
[1:13:47] looking up and they're watching them
[1:13:49] stand on the ridge and dawn begins to
[1:13:51] break polio and then they see the Sun
[1:13:53] Sun strike those on the top of the
[1:13:55] mountain and then those that are feeling
[1:13:57] the sun rays call down to the ones down
[1:14:00] below
[1:14:00] we're free the Sun is up early the Sun
[1:14:03] is out we're free hello they are lean
[1:14:05] they were going to call that a call
[1:14:06] there you guys wonder the rhuebottom
[1:14:08] said hallelujah we're free but then they
[1:14:11] were looking at the Sun but then it's
[1:14:12] win those sunrays when the Sun went up
[1:14:14] higher then finally the ones at the
[1:14:16] bottom of the valley they weren't in
[1:14:17] darkness anymore but they found those
[1:14:19] sun rays perlu that they really felt the
[1:14:22] same sun rays those that at the top and
[1:14:24] they realized every hallelujah Oh God
[1:14:28] give me boy
[1:14:30] hallelujah is the same thing without I'm
[1:14:32] in a profit climb to the top of the
[1:14:33] pyramid the Sun as another as a dawn of
[1:14:36] another day he found the Sun rising and
[1:14:39] he proclaimed down to the bride you're
[1:14:41] free you're a free woman you're a free
[1:14:43] woman and then no doubt we heard about
[1:14:45] it see that's glorious but they win the
[1:14:47] Sun rose and there in those racetrack
[1:14:50] you but the sun rays of us were struck
[1:14:52] you and you felt the warmth you felt
[1:14:55] that as another day it's not that I
[1:14:57] heard about it I'm experiencing
[1:14:59] hallelujah hallelujah and so now the
[1:15:03] bride is flying saying we're free amen
[1:15:07] the word has come into effect amen the
[1:15:10] battles over I mean the victory has been
[1:15:13] won the documents come down from heaven
[1:15:15] hallelujah glory to God
[1:15:20] amen Jesus gave the Commission to his
[1:15:23] church go you into all the world and
[1:15:26] preach the gospel these signs shall
[1:15:28] follow them that belief and he went with
[1:15:30] them he went he said yo in my name
[1:15:34] you'll cast out Devils speak with new
[1:15:35] tongues take up servant a serpents if
[1:15:38] you drink any deadly thing it shall not
[1:15:39] hurt you
[1:15:40] you shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:15:42] shall recover and and and so then after
[1:15:45] the Lord had spoken unto them he was
[1:15:46] received up into heaven and said on the
[1:15:48] right hand of God and they went forth
[1:15:50] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[1:15:54] with them and confirming the word with
[1:15:56] signs following
[1:15:57] so the life they were carrying confirmed
[1:15:59] with what they were talking about
[1:16:01] hallelujah
[1:16:02] and so now and this isn't John it says
[1:16:08] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:16:09] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:16:11] neither Northam but ye know him for he
[1:16:15] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:16:17] I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come
[1:16:20] to you a little while the world seeth me
[1:16:22] no more but you shall see me because I
[1:16:24] live you shall live also and that day
[1:16:27] you shall know that I am in the father
[1:16:28] and ye and me and I in you he that hath
[1:16:32] my Commandments and keepeth them he it
[1:16:35] is that loveth me and he that loveth me
[1:16:37] shall be loved of my father and I'll
[1:16:39] love him and will manifest myself to him
[1:16:42] hallelujah
[1:16:43] who's whose experience have manifesting
[1:16:46] himself to you amen because you loved
[1:16:48] his word you love his Commandments
[1:16:50] hallelujah amen glory to God amen she's
[1:16:54] saying that the world will not see me so
[1:16:56] now I think his brother Aaron McGarry
[1:16:58] said very simply that well that means
[1:16:59] that everyone who's of the world doesn't
[1:17:01] see him I mean so the world doesn't see
[1:17:03] his manifestation they don't understand
[1:17:05] his manifestation they don't see it they
[1:17:07] can see maybe a group of people and you
[1:17:09] know but they don't see the life on
[1:17:10] display just like Jesus they saw a man
[1:17:13] even probably wasn't too tall didn't
[1:17:15] look like much but they didn't see it
[1:17:17] was the Word made flesh they didn't see
[1:17:19] the Messiah because they were of the
[1:17:20] world the scribes and Pharisees they
[1:17:22] were of the world right they didn't see
[1:17:24] him so those who are of the world do not
[1:17:26] see his manifestation but those who are
[1:17:28] not of the world see him in this day
[1:17:31] those who are not of the world hand of
[1:17:33] behind the voice guys who are not of the
[1:17:35] world a united I mean what with Jesus
[1:17:38] Christ the Living Word hallelujah amen
[1:17:43] he said at the end of Matthew he says lo
[1:17:45] I'm with you always even to the end of
[1:17:46] the world amen now a dove is a special
[1:17:50] kind of bird and dove does not need to
[1:17:53] take a bath big and the reason is
[1:17:57] because a dove has has oil that it
[1:17:59] naturally excretes that keeps it clean
[1:18:03] so there's a life in it pushing out that
[1:18:05] keeps its feathers clean it doesn't need
[1:18:07] take a bath amen and it's the same thing
[1:18:09] with the Bride of Christ
[1:18:11] right we have a life in a Swede there's
[1:18:13] something that produces an oil right the
[1:18:15] oil of the Holy Ghost is enough and
[1:18:17] keeps pushing out cleansing us right
[1:18:20] keeps me there that's life saying last
[1:18:21] Sunday you got to have the strong man in
[1:18:23] the house amen if he is in your soul the
[1:18:26] enemy comes into your spirit that life
[1:18:28] will just push out push out against the
[1:18:30] enemy amen hallelujah however he's
[1:18:33] trying to get at you he'll push you out
[1:18:34] hallelujah glory to God I'm glad he's
[1:18:37] that way so now his life in us keeps us
[1:18:39] clean it keeps us clean from the world
[1:18:42] his life doesn't and it's not our own
[1:18:44] Reformation it's his transformation
[1:18:46] it's his life in you keeps you clean
[1:18:49] hallelujah I'm glad I'm out trust you're
[1:18:52] glad - hallelujah now as I see it the
[1:19:01] the so the oil keeps us clean though the
[1:19:04] anointing God's presence in us keeps us
[1:19:07] clean now 1st Corinthians 6 he says know
[1:19:11] ye not that the unrighteous shall not
[1:19:13] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[1:19:15] deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:19:17] idolaters neither adulterers nor
[1:19:19] effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[1:19:21] with mankind nor thieves nor covetous
[1:19:24] nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[1:19:26] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:19:29] of God but such were some of you I mean
[1:19:33] I'm no but such were some of you but ye
[1:19:35] are washed but ye are sanctified but ye
[1:19:38] are justified in the name of the Lord
[1:19:40] Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[1:19:42] now when Paul is writing this he's not
[1:19:44] saying well you know
[1:19:46] you know you were this but you're still
[1:19:49] this right he's not saying to these
[1:19:51] Corinthians well you are still this way
[1:19:53] but then you say well as the grace of
[1:19:55] God and you're still this way right
[1:19:57] let's say the thing is people what they
[1:19:59] claim to be grace is because they have
[1:20:01] no power in their walk with God right
[1:20:03] there the word that is ministered has no
[1:20:05] power to cleanse and redeem and to set
[1:20:08] free right so they have to now take a
[1:20:10] substitute well it's just all grace and
[1:20:12] keep living the way you want that's not
[1:20:14] how the gospel works there's a power in
[1:20:16] the gospel to transform the vilest
[1:20:19] darkest richest person or the most
[1:20:21] religious person it doesn't matter what
[1:20:23] state we're coming I mean there's power
[1:20:25] in this word to transform anyone who set
[1:20:28] anyone free I meant to cleanse anyone of
[1:20:31] anything I mean there is nothing too
[1:20:33] hard for the Lord nothing at all that's
[1:20:36] why we don't look at what we see we look
[1:20:38] by the eyes of faith in His Word and if
[1:20:41] his word says that thou and thy seed
[1:20:43] will be there amen
[1:20:44] this is the heritage of the Lord I say
[1:20:46] amen amen
[1:20:48] thine in thy house shall be saved amen
[1:20:51] absolutely well how do I get my house
[1:20:53] same the same faith you had for your own
[1:20:55] soul you now believe with that same
[1:20:57] faith for your family that's what you do
[1:20:58] as I say you don't have the build you
[1:21:00] know a perfect faith the bride has
[1:21:02] perfect faith because the life we live
[1:21:05] has pulse in the life I now live I live
[1:21:07] by the faith of the Son of God you don't
[1:21:10] say
[1:21:11] with faith in the Son of God but by the
[1:21:14] faith of the Son of God so the same
[1:21:16] faith Jesus had to lay down his own life
[1:21:19] and take it back up again the same faith
[1:21:21] Jesus had to go down take the keys off
[1:21:23] Satan the same faith that he had to cast
[1:21:25] all the devil's out allegiant the same
[1:21:27] faith he had to calm the storm the same
[1:21:29] faith he had to raise Lazarus out of the
[1:21:31] grave the same faith he had to subject
[1:21:34] his flesh to the Word of God for him to
[1:21:36] go to Calvary as a man hallelujah take
[1:21:39] the sins of the world on himself
[1:21:40] and come out victorious the same faith
[1:21:43] he had the bride has because he his
[1:21:48] faith is in you because he is in you why
[1:21:51] are you following me it's not your human
[1:21:53] faith the Bible says that you believe in
[1:21:55] one God you do well the devil believes
[1:21:57] also in tremble he doesn't have that
[1:21:58] kind of faith
[1:22:00] right for that that's just natural human
[1:22:02] faith but the brides
[1:22:04] the faith of the bride is the faith of
[1:22:06] Jesus Christ right and that is perfect
[1:22:09] faith he walked out upon the water he
[1:22:12] didn't sink amen
[1:22:14] he went to you know he went to dry sis
[1:22:17] house raised up his daughter hallelujah
[1:22:21] this is the kind of faith we have but
[1:22:22] our humanity can get in the way I mean
[1:22:25] that's why we're go to cast aside
[1:22:27] reasoning cast aside this person this
[1:22:30] flesh oh thank you one day because it'll
[1:22:31] be changed hallelujah you got to drag it
[1:22:34] around I mean but this humanity gets in
[1:22:37] the way just put it aside only believers
[1:22:39] word I mean so the bride has perfect
[1:22:43] faith because we're the faith of the Son
[1:22:45] of God the life I now live amen the same
[1:22:48] faith that the martyrs and the Dark Ages
[1:22:51] went to the stake with that were torn
[1:22:53] asunder were butchered terribly by the
[1:22:56] Antichrist system that same faith is in
[1:23:00] the bride today I'm in the same faith
[1:23:02] that you overcome this world with as the
[1:23:04] same faith they had Alleluia we we we
[1:23:08] take it for granted what we possess
[1:23:10] hallelujah the same faith that they
[1:23:13] could go into the Coliseum I don't know
[1:23:15] what they sing but they were rejoicing
[1:23:16] hallelujah
[1:23:18] you mean soon and very soon I'm going to
[1:23:19] see the king and more than a nice song
[1:23:21] that brother whoever wrote Oh sister
[1:23:23] EVER
[1:23:23] it's an hour reality hallelujah and
[1:23:25] these lines are just a just a travel bus
[1:23:27] to get me to where I want to go
[1:23:29] hallelujah and they rejoiced and they
[1:23:31] were thankful and they knew who they
[1:23:33] were the same faith that because you
[1:23:36] know we admire them and we should
[1:23:38] because they stood in their day
[1:23:40] that's the time-tested memorial of God
[1:23:42] how glorious but sometimes we think how
[1:23:44] can we compare but yet the same faith
[1:23:46] they have you have we need we need that
[1:23:49] every part of all you say well I'm not
[1:23:51] facing lions there's a lot of demons out
[1:23:53] there I'm not facing persecution like
[1:23:56] they did there's a lot of demons out
[1:23:58] there this whole world is actually built
[1:24:00] against you society is built against you
[1:24:02] whether your local roads being
[1:24:04] engineered against you because on one
[1:24:07] hand the devil makes soft living that we
[1:24:09] don't want to leave and on the other
[1:24:10] hand he tries to rob us of our faith
[1:24:13] amen but that's why we don't feel
[1:24:14] comfortable here because God's going to
[1:24:16] stir us up just like children of Israel
[1:24:18] you know and the proper I mean I mean in
[1:24:20] in Goshen it was the best part of Egypt
[1:24:23] and Pharaoh gave them Goshen do you
[1:24:26] think if they were not slaves now no
[1:24:29] persecution came on them do you think
[1:24:30] they'd want to leave Moses comes in
[1:24:33] they've just had a good for 400 years
[1:24:34] we're going to go to the promised land
[1:24:36] now God's you're Abraham's the God of
[1:24:39] Abraham Isaac and Jacob met me there
[1:24:41] burning bush he said now go down we're
[1:24:43] gonna take you in the promised land
[1:24:44] that's a no we'll stay here what do you
[1:24:48] mean I don't want to go fight there I've
[1:24:50] got this this is good land look at my
[1:24:53] cattle look at my vineyards you
[1:24:55] everything's knives you know we're
[1:24:56] blessed here I don't want to go that's
[1:24:58] why God had to stir them up he allowed
[1:25:00] Pharaoh to race that when the deliverer
[1:25:02] came they said thank you Lord we're on
[1:25:05] our way
[1:25:05] hallelujah and that's why there that's
[1:25:08] why this world troubles us because God
[1:25:10] doesn't want us comfortable here because
[1:25:12] this is not our final resting place
[1:25:14] this is not our destination streets of
[1:25:17] gold are our destination the winning
[1:25:19] suppers our destination that's where he
[1:25:21] wants you to yearn for there I mean that
[1:25:23] we can really say I'm a pilgrim I'm a
[1:25:25] stranger I'm just wandering through this
[1:25:27] world of sin I know where I'm going
[1:25:28] though hallelujah
[1:25:30] so you say well I just don't feel
[1:25:32] comfortable I'd say thank you Lord Jesus
[1:25:35] but there's nothing in me that really
[1:25:37] identifies with this world hallelujah
[1:25:40] all identify mainly is with you and your
[1:25:42] word and I want to go who wants to go
[1:25:45] hallelujah amen glory to God amen so now
[1:25:54] he says so those that Paul said were
[1:25:57] washed and we're sanctified they really
[1:25:59] were I mean they were cleansed by you
[1:26:02] know from all those things because he
[1:26:04] said but such as 1 some of you now we
[1:26:07] know the biggest deception because the
[1:26:10] snare of death has been conquered
[1:26:12] right the snare of death has been
[1:26:14] conquered but it has to become real to
[1:26:16] you that it's been conquered when the
[1:26:18] Apostle Paul said Oh grave death where
[1:26:20] is thy sting grave where is thy victory
[1:26:22] I mean he knew he he had been taken up
[1:26:25] beyond the curtain of time
[1:26:26] right he knew where he was going a meant
[1:26:30] he had met the very God of creation the
[1:26:33] Lord Jesus Christ on the road to
[1:26:34] Damascus he knew who he wasn't him right
[1:26:37] so he wasn't afraid because he knew the
[1:26:39] sneer of death was broken he knew what
[1:26:41] was waiting for him just beyond the veil
[1:26:44] hallelujah and I trust it well it has to
[1:26:48] be the same with us we've heard a voice
[1:26:49] from heaven why we've heard a voice from
[1:26:51] the eternities we've heard the voice of
[1:26:53] godless last days and that voice has
[1:26:56] come to find other bits of eternity
[1:26:58] they'd have to go back into eternity but
[1:27:00] that's why it speaks to your soul I mean
[1:27:03] that's why it's gripped you it's because
[1:27:04] the voices come and said I'm laying
[1:27:06] claim this is part of me this is part of
[1:27:08] eternity this has no expiry date
[1:27:11] hallelujah this world of the devil has
[1:27:13] an expired name of my children have no
[1:27:15] expiry date I'll never go off the never
[1:27:17] go rancid they're never going to get
[1:27:18] moldy they're just gonna be eternally
[1:27:20] good hallelujah so now that's why that's
[1:27:24] why this message I trust has gripped
[1:27:25] your soul something in use there's been
[1:27:27] a cry hallelujah just like the chicken
[1:27:30] you're the eagle in the chicken yard
[1:27:32] I trust that means something to you I
[1:27:34] mean with her with a mother Eagle knew
[1:27:36] she laid two eggs but one was missing
[1:27:38] and she says I'll not rest until I find
[1:27:40] number two or number one whichever it
[1:27:42] was because a farmer snuck in got the
[1:27:44] egg and put it in his chicken coop and
[1:27:45] then that chicken hatches out I mean
[1:27:47] throw that Eagle Hedges out of the
[1:27:48] chicken coop and it tries to be a tries
[1:27:51] to be a chicken tries to eat the same
[1:27:53] things walk the same way tries to fit in
[1:27:55] you know kids with your kids are yo yo
[1:28:00] yo kids say terrible things to each
[1:28:02] other they just they just cut you know

[1:28:28] and they played that game and you know
[1:28:29] sees us and they every everyone wants to
[1:28:33] fit in so the Eagle little baby girl
[1:28:35] tries to fit in it doesn't know it's an
[1:28:36] eagle it thinks it's one of them but
[1:28:39] their mamas mamas
[1:28:40] flying around looking looking where is

[1:28:47] with one I had to they all must return I
[1:28:51] must have the second enter so she's
[1:28:53] flying and then finally she flies over
[1:28:55] the barnyard and and pray always run
[1:28:58] when there's a predator so all the
[1:29:00] chickens start making a bunch of noise
[1:29:01] they they they run as fast as they can
[1:29:03] but then the shadow of that eagle
[1:29:05] crosses over there baby eagle on the
[1:29:07] ground and then and then so so the baby
[1:29:09] will sees this shadow of the mother
[1:29:11] Eagle fly over it and it's not frayed
[1:29:13] and look and something in it says it's
[1:29:17] something about there I don't know what
[1:29:19] it is I'm not afraid of that thing and
[1:29:21] all the others same time you're ugly one
[1:29:23] you know come in here hiding with us
[1:29:26] it's scary but it's not scared something
[1:29:28] this is no and then and then the mother
[1:29:30] looks down and and cries out cries out
[1:29:35] what are you doing down there honey
[1:29:37] hallelujah you're an eagle you're like
[1:29:40] me and then everything begins to make
[1:29:42] seats for the baby eagle oh that's why I
[1:29:46] have these big wings you know I've never
[1:29:48] used that's why I have these big claws
[1:29:50] it's like this big beak that's why this
[1:29:52] razor vision that no one else has down
[1:29:54] the banya look summer says yes how do I
[1:29:56] go in how do I get up there just begin
[1:29:59] to fluff your wings take the faith you
[1:30:01] haven't begin to play maybe up to the
[1:30:03] fencepost hallelujah maybe bit of
[1:30:05] justification up to the top of the
[1:30:07] barnyard have a Pentecostal shouting
[1:30:09] time hallelujah this is one more swoop
[1:30:12] down and catch it he begins the floppers
[1:30:14] wings flap into the air mother catches
[1:30:16] it and off they go
[1:30:17] hallelujah and that is what this message
[1:30:19] does I trust you one day you're in the
[1:30:22] barnyard I just don't fit in I remember
[1:30:24] I didn't really fit in at school I
[1:30:26] didn't really fit in at universe I tried
[1:30:28] I tried real hard I just didn't really
[1:30:31] fit in but then one day I heard a voice
[1:30:33] one day I heard the voice I made it
[1:30:36] something in me said that's what I am
[1:30:38] hallelujah I began to flap my wings may
[1:30:41] not have been too graceful to begin with
[1:30:42] but it's not how you start it's how you
[1:30:44] finish that's the main thing hallelujah
[1:30:47] glory to God I trust this happened the
[1:30:50] snare has been broken all those chickens
[1:30:52] were just being breed
[1:30:53] to be food hallelujah we're not food
[1:30:56] friends
[1:30:56] I mean we're ordained to fly in the
[1:30:58] heavenly and you've got to realize just
[1:31:01] just open your eyes and flight oh this
[1:31:02] is where I am because the devil tries to
[1:31:04] get our mind your earthbound you'll
[1:31:06] never get anywhere this is you know just
[1:31:08] realize who you are in him holy I'm glad
[1:31:12] we're flying glory to God now but then
[1:31:18] as I said in the in the beginning the nd
[1:31:20] Christ spirit came in among the church
[1:31:22] to make it to try and take the life out
[1:31:27] he said brother Bram stairs and there's
[1:31:30] from the church age book he sees here he
[1:31:37] says he knows so Satan Satan is afraid
[1:31:40] he knows that the Spirit of God is about
[1:31:42] to let the people know what of his works
[1:31:45] this is why he hates these meetings so
[1:31:47] much when names are called and diseases
[1:31:50] revealed Satan hates it now what is this
[1:31:53] it is not mine reading is not telepathy
[1:31:55] nor is that witchcraft it is a
[1:31:57] revelation by the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:32:00] only way I can know it of course the
[1:32:01] carnal mind will call it anything but
[1:32:03] the Holy Ghost let me show you another
[1:32:04] reason why Satan hates this book of
[1:32:07] Revelation of the gene of Jesus Christ
[1:32:09] in the church hello church the rich the
[1:32:13] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:32:14] in the church I mean when he reveals
[1:32:16] himself to you right that's why he hates
[1:32:19] this he knows that Jesus Christ is the
[1:32:21] same yesterday today and forever and he
[1:32:23] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[1:32:26] more than do 90% of the theologians he
[1:32:28] knows that since God is immutable in his
[1:32:31] nature then he's just as immutable in
[1:32:33] his ways the Satan knows is surely that
[1:32:35] the original church at Pentecost with
[1:32:37] the power of God mark 16 in action is
[1:32:40] the true church that Jesus claims as his
[1:32:43] own all houses false it has to be now
[1:32:45] remember this Christ in the true church
[1:32:47] as a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:32:50] hallelujah because it's the same life
[1:32:52] living through them but the book of
[1:32:54] Revelation shows how that the Antichrist
[1:32:57] spirit would come into the church and
[1:32:59] defile it making it lukewarm formal and
[1:33:02] powerless and exposes Satan revealing
[1:33:05] his works which are the attempt
[1:33:07] destruction of God's people and the
[1:33:09] discrediting of God's Word
[1:33:11] amen right down to the time he's cast
[1:33:14] into the lake of fire he fights it he
[1:33:16] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:33:18] people get the true revelation of the
[1:33:21] true church and what she is what she
[1:33:24] stands for and that she can do the
[1:33:26] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:33:29] army if they can get a true revelation
[1:33:31] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:33:33] of the Christian Church and by God's
[1:33:35] Spirit discern and withstand the
[1:33:38] Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[1:33:40] powerless before her he will be
[1:33:42] differently thoughted today as when
[1:33:44] Christ was stood as every effort to gain
[1:33:46] power over him in the desert yes sir
[1:33:48] Satan hates revelation but we love it
[1:33:51] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:33:53] gates of hell cannot pray Oh prevail
[1:33:55] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:33:59] Alleluia so if the people can get the
[1:34:02] true revelation of the true church and
[1:34:04] what she is and what she stands for then
[1:34:07] she can do the greater works she will be
[1:34:11] an invincible army I mean I and I just
[1:34:14] wanted to clear to you now now we have
[1:34:16] the revelation of the true church right
[1:34:19] because the true church is part of his
[1:34:20] words while the true church is the
[1:34:22] continuation of his ministry the true
[1:34:24] churches the Word made flesh as the
[1:34:27] Apostle Paul said you are living
[1:34:28] epistles read and known of all men
[1:34:30] writes the epistles he wrote and what
[1:34:32] they preached became flesh in their
[1:34:33] lives hallelujah so that is the true
[1:34:35] church it is the Word made flesh again
[1:34:37] and people God and His people once again
[1:34:40] we are the word right when we wake up in
[1:34:43] the morning we are the word how we treat
[1:34:45] each other as is the word right you know
[1:34:48] how we how we treat each other how we
[1:34:49] dress how we you know how we walk in
[1:34:52] this world as the Word made flesh amen
[1:34:56] right so that and then what she and what
[1:34:58] she stands for what are we standing for
[1:35:00] God living in a people I mean a Ministry
[1:35:03] of reconciliation there people are
[1:35:04] reconciled to God they become one with
[1:35:06] him that's what we stand for
[1:35:08] right that the last one would come into
[1:35:10] the kingdom amen then she and that and
[1:35:13] and if we are standing for thus then the
[1:35:16] enemy cannot stand against us
[1:35:19] I mean as I fight with what you got
[1:35:21] it'll work I tell you it'll work fight
[1:35:24] with what you got because she can do the
[1:35:26] greater works we can do the greater
[1:35:27] works right and she will be in an
[1:35:30] invincible army now an invincible I mean
[1:35:32] never loses a battle but they go through
[1:35:33] battles amen
[1:35:36] they may they may fight but they'll be
[1:35:38] invincible they'll win every every fight
[1:35:40] and that's what we're cool to do we're
[1:35:42] cool to win every fight amen
[1:35:44] when every mind battle cast down
[1:35:46] reasoning conquer the yo-yo Satan is
[1:35:49] conquered hallelujah our Lord Jesus
[1:35:53] conquered a met down Calvary we fight a
[1:35:56] defeated being a meant he he's been
[1:35:59] stripped of all power right so we should
[1:36:03] just go forth and victory and don't let
[1:36:07] the devil whisper down you know in
[1:36:08] theories but he doesn't do those things
[1:36:10] anymore this is just too much pie in the
[1:36:12] sky and it's not for us it is for us
[1:36:14] amen the word is for us I mean the
[1:36:16] promise of the word Irish true is the
[1:36:18] day they were spoken right it hasn't
[1:36:20] diminished in any way hasn't gone stale
[1:36:23] it's just as potent just as powerful as
[1:36:25] the day I was spoken hallelujah now in
[1:36:32] the saddest sergej so as we know through
[1:36:35] church history you go down to the dark
[1:36:37] ages is the great snare of religion but
[1:36:39] then God began to break the snare and in
[1:36:43] the saddest church age we know that was
[1:36:44] the church age where the Reformation was
[1:36:46] was was birthed Martin Luther so I wrote
[1:36:50] as 95 theses put it on the church door
[1:36:52] there and at Birth the Reformation so in
[1:36:56] the word Sardis and the English means
[1:36:58] means the escaped one so they they begin
[1:37:02] to live out the name of each church age
[1:37:04] and even I could say this that the bride
[1:37:08] is living out now don't get me wrong
[1:37:10] I'll clarify what I mean
[1:37:11] but we live in the letter C in church
[1:37:13] age and that means people's rights if
[1:37:17] one's rising up wanting their rights you
[1:37:20] see it on the news if everyone is trying
[1:37:22] to claim their rights now if that's
[1:37:23] happening on the negative side
[1:37:25] how much more on the positive side it's
[1:37:28] not the bride rising up to claim her
[1:37:30] god-given rights is she not rising up
[1:37:32] and
[1:37:33] test saying I will not be bound although
[1:37:35] BK shall not be put in the box
[1:37:37] I'll not be silenced I mean but I will
[1:37:39] speak I will I will petition I will
[1:37:41] claim what belongs to me I'll take my
[1:37:43] land I'll take every promise that
[1:37:45] belongs to me
[1:37:45] are we not rising up to take our rights
[1:37:48] hallelujah are we not said something in
[1:37:50] a saying I will not live below my
[1:37:52] privilege I will not live in a
[1:37:53] backslidden defeated State I will live
[1:37:56] in victory
[1:37:56] I will walk in victory every day I will
[1:37:58] be on fire because of a spirit in me
[1:38:01] hallelujah so we are I'll say it this
[1:38:05] way we are living out that part of Lady
[1:38:07] hacia that name because there's the
[1:38:10] bride has rights and God is here to
[1:38:13] enforce your rights that you receive
[1:38:14] them I mean that's why I say he's the
[1:38:16] kinsman Avenger I mean he's here to to
[1:38:19] avenge - to take out the vengeance upon
[1:38:22] the enemy yes hallelujah amen so he says
[1:38:26] now Sardis now we start up means in
[1:38:29] English terms that means the escaped one
[1:38:31] the true side us was the escaped once
[1:38:34] and now and see the escaped one now
[1:38:39] we're going to start and he's going to
[1:38:41] read it says we're going to call at the
[1:38:42] age of the Reformation and it's a very
[1:38:44] fitting thing for this Reformation if we
[1:38:46] call that because the Reformation was
[1:38:48] the escaped ones the ones that came way
[1:38:50] and escaped out of it they escaped out
[1:38:52] of room and it's religion they begin the
[1:38:54] escape right but then there came a time
[1:38:57] where where where they form their own
[1:38:59] denomination so they started out as the
[1:39:02] escaped ones but then the big came and
[1:39:03] sneered again and then God raised up
[1:39:05] another group that's why there's so much
[1:39:06] so many groups raised up in the
[1:39:08] Reformation they started out right there
[1:39:10] they didn't have a full restoration of
[1:39:11] the word rights they started off but
[1:39:14] then but then they became sneered but
[1:39:18] then they had to come a time now where
[1:39:20] the Fowler's snare the devil stare is
[1:39:22] fully broken that there is a people that
[1:39:25] do not fall back into the stare of of
[1:39:27] that religious snare hallelujah and
[1:39:30] that's why now God had to send a prophet
[1:39:33] in this last stage that the whole word
[1:39:35] came open rare because Jesus Christ
[1:39:38] cannot be denominated but it kind of
[1:39:41] what what did the Lutheran's do they
[1:39:43] raised up the Josh I lived by faith God
[1:39:44] was working then they put
[1:39:46] God in a box they took a name and they
[1:39:48] denominator then they died then God
[1:39:49] raised up Wesley and many others but
[1:39:52] then finally there comes down into this
[1:39:54] last stage where it's not a Reformation
[1:39:56] but it's a restoration where our people
[1:39:59] are restored back to the original faith
[1:40:01] of the father's right and that's what
[1:40:03] the Ministry of Malachi 4 was to do I
[1:40:06] mean by the opening of the word as there
[1:40:08] are people's faith people's hearts will
[1:40:11] be turned back to the original faith of
[1:40:13] the fathers hallelujah that they are not
[1:40:15] turned to another just a way or another
[1:40:17] religion but they are restored to the
[1:40:20] faith of the gospel the faith of the

[1:41:21] glory to God I mean the Fowler's snare
[1:41:25] has been broken in this hour the devil

[1:41:29] speckled bird hallelujah and the devil
[1:41:32] cannot stop your flight hallelujah the

[1:42:25] to let them go hallelujah that's the
[1:42:27] same thing with us friends if God was
[1:42:29] unstoppable back then if he was
[1:42:31] unstoppable and then he comes to Joshua
[1:42:33] take the land did he take the land did
[1:42:36] he did he conquer
[1:42:37] he conquered he was unstoppable
[1:42:39] hallelujah all down through the prophets
[1:42:42] God was unstoppable doesn't matter what
[1:42:44] the devil tried to do God's victorious
[1:42:46] and then Jesus came the word became
[1:42:49] flesh I'm going to show you I'm
[1:42:51] unstoppable
[1:42:51] hallelujah unbelief didn't stop him
[1:42:54] culture didn't stop him
[1:42:56] pressure a family didn't stop him he had
[1:42:58] family here family pressure he's in a
[1:43:00] house preaching as breather in a tract
[1:43:03] call to him my mother and my brethren or
[1:43:05] without their calling for you he didn't
[1:43:07] come to that pressured you said those
[1:43:09] that do the will of my father they are
[1:43:10] my brother of my brother right and so so
[1:43:13] the religious of the day didn't stop him
[1:43:14] unbelief didn't stop her and difference
[1:43:16] didn't stop him death didn't stop him
[1:43:19] which no witchcraft whatever at war
[1:43:21] demons first didn't stop him he just
[1:43:24] plowed through he conquered everything

[1:43:28] says I've conquered at all I'm just
[1:43:30] going to rise up on high and I'm gonna
[1:43:31] give the victory to my children and I
[1:43:34] say down through the church ages the
[1:43:35] bride was actually unstoppable because
[1:43:36] she did what she was ordained to do even
[1:43:39] to die and go down to a dark age she was
[1:43:41] ordained to do this right so they were
[1:43:43] victorious because they fulfilled the
[1:43:46] would for their age and that makes a
[1:43:49] victory hallelujah and then here we are
[1:43:51] we're in a rapture season
[1:43:53] I mean we're in a wrap your season you
[1:43:56] know will will one stop because it says
[1:43:57] the Bakura
[1:43:58] she's in the book of Revelation to hold
[1:44:01] back the four winds
[1:44:02] and so I've sealed my servants so the
[1:44:04] war stopped I mean because now was going
[1:44:07] to come a season where where Israel had
[1:44:09] to be gathered back in as a nation are
[1:44:12] they there
[1:44:13] did they stand you know look at their
[1:44:17] founding battles the weapons they had or
[1:44:19] lack thereof and then all the Arab
[1:44:22] countries around them and the weapons
[1:44:23] they had and the lack they did not have
[1:44:25] all and then what happened
[1:44:28] God stood God stood for them his
[1:44:32] numerous accounts of the of the night
[1:44:34] was at 1948 war or whatever it was you
[1:44:36] know that War of Independence
[1:44:38] with his soldiers Israeli soldiers and
[1:44:40] they're just really militia yeah you
[1:44:43] know they don't have all the training
[1:44:43] like all the others and they're there
[1:44:45] and they're trying to hold off I think
[1:44:47] the was it your day into or will some of
[1:44:50] the Arabs and they run out of bullets
[1:44:52] and they just theater said well we're
[1:44:53] just going to die and then suddenly all
[1:44:56] the Arabs they they they were going to
[1:44:58] cry out Ibrahim Ibrahim and they could
[1:45:00] all skid they run off tuck tail and run
[1:45:02] and then these Israeli so well what
[1:45:05] happened here
[1:45:06] I didn't years later one of the Arabs
[1:45:09] meets one of the Israelis and they find
[1:45:12] out they're fighting in the same place
[1:45:13] they said yeah we were there and then
[1:45:15] Abraham stood up behind you let's bring
[1:45:18] giant man stood up behind you and we got
[1:45:20] terrified and we ran away numerous
[1:45:24] things happen like that yo yo yo
[1:45:27] numerous supernatural things happen God
[1:45:29] was there because he was going to gather
[1:45:31] his natural children and when the odds
[1:45:33] were stacked against them God said no no
[1:45:35] I'm doing this saying you cannot stop
[1:45:37] what I'm doing hallelujah now if that's
[1:45:40] just the natural people hey they'll be
[1:45:42] there you understand these 144,000
[1:45:45] they're going to come forth but if the
[1:45:46] word said now Israel will become a
[1:45:48] nation again who's going to stop it
[1:45:50] happening right and if the Bible says
[1:45:52] the bride will come to her position his
[1:45:54] wife has made herself ready she's been a
[1:45:56] rain to her was granted that she'll be
[1:45:59] arrayed in linen clean and white the
[1:46:00] righteousness of saints who's gonna stop
[1:46:02] it where he's gonna stop a a bride
[1:46:05] that's cleanse that's separate from
[1:46:07] every spirit of the world all religion
[1:46:09] any any device of man and she spotless
[1:46:12] she's pure she's virtuous she's sinless
[1:46:15] as he is sinless hallelujah
[1:46:17] hey if the scripture says that he became
[1:46:19] me that I might become him by grace
[1:46:23] right he became sin for me that I would
[1:46:26] become the very
[1:46:27] righteous of God through Christ that's
[1:46:29] what the Bible says did he become sin
[1:46:31] was he your sin offering was he your sin
[1:46:33] offering did he take you your sins upon
[1:46:35] himself and went to Calvary and your sin
[1:46:38] offering well if we do that for you then
[1:46:40] the other part of the scripture is still
[1:46:42] still true hallelujah that if he became
[1:46:45] my sin offering I become his very
[1:46:47] righteousness I'll just say something I
[1:46:49] heard brother Harold Hildebrandt's at
[1:46:50] the first convention to ever win - I'm
[1:46:52] as righteous as God is righteous I'm a
[1:46:54] sinless as God as sinless Alleluia I'm
[1:46:59] just that's what the scripture says if
[1:47:00] he became sin for me I become his very
[1:47:02] righteousness of God through Christ
[1:47:04] hallelujah that's why the Apostle Paul
[1:47:07] can say stand up and say who can make
[1:47:08] charge the gods are linked it's God that
[1:47:10] justifies I mean it's God that justifies
[1:47:13] a god that calls a god that glorifies
[1:47:15] it's God's doing so you can they charge
[1:47:17] the devil rise up and say you did this
[1:47:19] and did this and did this
[1:47:20] it's a hold on Satan go talk to the
[1:47:23] judge
[1:47:23] holy because a judge doesn't just prove
[1:47:26] people guilty they prove them innocent
[1:47:28] as well hallelujah just like the woman's
[1:47:31] caught in adultery John eight brought
[1:47:33] before Jesus and and and they say rabbi
[1:47:37] we've caught her in the very act well
[1:47:39] where's the man but the devil waist
[1:47:41] twist what's going on where's the man
[1:47:43] and then so now he's that he's that he's
[1:47:45] the lawgiver who was on Sinai is now in
[1:47:48] flesh and they brought this woman before
[1:47:51] the lawgiver and before that on yo when
[1:47:55] he gave the Beatitudes he magnified the
[1:47:57] law I've heard of all time thou shalt
[1:47:59] not commit adultery but I say unto you a
[1:48:01] man who looks upon a woman to lust after
[1:48:03] her in this heart has committed adultery
[1:48:05] already has done the same act as if he
[1:48:08] physically did it with her you have
[1:48:10] heard of all time thou shalt not kill I
[1:48:11] said to thee if any man is anger against
[1:48:14] his brother without a cause he's in
[1:48:16] danger of hellfire
[1:48:18] amen so he magnified the law so he is
[1:48:21] now the lawgiver
[1:48:22] who's just magnified the law and this
[1:48:24] woman who's been caught in the act is
[1:48:26] now brought before her hallelujah this
[1:48:30] is what the devil tries to do he's the
[1:48:32] snare of the Fowler as caught one I've
[1:48:34] caught one what are you gonna do about
[1:48:37] it now because he's a judge he's a
[1:48:38] righteous judge
[1:48:39] right but then he begins to ride in the
[1:48:41] sand he probably want to know if he's
[1:48:43] left the right hand it doesn't matter
[1:48:44] but he began to ride in the sand he
[1:48:47] doesn't even and he just says he who is
[1:48:49] without sin cast the first stone and
[1:48:51] from the oldest to the youngest are
[1:48:53] pricked and make conscious because their
[1:48:54] memory begin to go I did this I did this
[1:48:56] I did this
[1:48:57] that person doesn't know I did this and
[1:48:59] they dropped their stones they walk off
[1:49:00] and then he just sits woman whereas I in
[1:49:04] accusers and he says she says they're
[1:49:08] all gone Lord Supreme One that's what
[1:49:10] that word Lord oh god they're all gone
[1:49:13] and and he says to her neither do i
[1:49:16] condemn thee go and sin no more so he
[1:49:19] judged her righteous hallelujah and so
[1:49:23] the snare court won but then when she
[1:49:26] was brought before the judge he just
[1:49:28] said no she's free the very ones who
[1:49:32] have brought the judge had tried to
[1:49:33] bring the judgment upon her actually
[1:49:35] judgment went upon them because they
[1:49:37] were they were now convicted than their
[1:49:38] own hearts and it's the same thing
[1:49:40] friends the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:49:42] doesn't just cover our sin it washes
[1:49:45] them free but then someone has to deal
[1:49:48] someone has to take responsibility and
[1:49:50] then it traces all the way back the sins
[1:49:52] that you did even willingly once
[1:49:55] confessed the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:57] and and he changes your nature where
[1:49:59] does their sin go it goes on the head of
[1:50:02] the accuser it goes on the head of the
[1:50:04] accuser hallelujah and and the devil
[1:50:07] takes your judgment your punishment
[1:50:09] rather and he goes to lake of fire with
[1:50:12] the sins that he made you do hallelujah
[1:50:16] amen that's the power of this blood what
[1:50:19] a Thanksgiving hallelujah because
[1:50:21] there's only the white great white
[1:50:23] throne judgment will all boil down it'll
[1:50:25] come down to one person one person one
[1:50:27] person one person it's Satan who did all
[1:50:30] this but just like the judgment and the
[1:50:32] garden where did it come down to finally
[1:50:34] the serpent you did this within you're
[1:50:37] going to be judged you're gonna be
[1:50:37] turned into what we call a snake you
[1:50:40] were a beast you were an animal you
[1:50:42] could reason you could speak the Bible
[1:50:44] doesn't say that God opened his mouth
[1:50:46] like Balaam's donkey he could speak he
[1:50:48] could reason he had that he had that yo
[1:50:52] intelligence
[1:50:53] the vocal cords here the anatomy to
[1:50:55] speak into reason then he has turned
[1:50:57] into a serpent hallelujah so now I'm
[1:51:03] glad the devil's gonna carry oh it's all
[1:51:07] being returned to sender you'd better
[1:51:11] return it to sender to that said mates
[1:51:13] you're born with you say Lord take it
[1:51:15] from me I don't want the same nature
[1:51:16] because it's not just to be not just to
[1:51:18] be forgiven
[1:51:19] like someone who's fallen into great
[1:51:21] debt agreed you're a man of great wealth
[1:51:23] can come and pay the debt off but if
[1:51:25] they still have that same nature that
[1:51:27] caused him to fall into debt in the
[1:51:28] first place they'll fall into debt again
[1:51:29] but if the spirit of that rich man who's
[1:51:32] good with money comes into the one who
[1:51:34] who has been forgiven
[1:51:36] oh you're of the dead then they won't
[1:51:38] fall into debt again you following me I
[1:51:39] mean it's the same thing it's not just
[1:51:41] us being forgiven you know many many
[1:51:45] claim the cross of Calvary but they
[1:51:47] don't have the resurrection I mean too
[1:51:50] many claim the blood but what makes it
[1:51:52] glorious isn't just the payment but that
[1:51:55] he rose to prove that he paid it right
[1:51:57] he had the proof now I am the
[1:51:59] resurrection and the life
[1:52:00] and he resurrected out of the tomb
[1:52:02] saying it's been paid for
[1:52:03] I didn't many people have died many were
[1:52:06] crucified he wasn't the only one
[1:52:08] crucified in that day heaven the two
[1:52:10] thieves the Romans did it all over the
[1:52:12] place many were crucified but he's the
[1:52:14] only one who came out of the grave to
[1:52:15] really prove what he did hallelujah
[1:52:18] and it's the same thing with us friends
[1:52:20] when that resurrection life comes in to
[1:52:22] us I mean than we ever proof because he
[1:52:25] rose I've risen because the same
[1:52:27] resurrection life that brought him out
[1:52:28] of the grave is now and me and a well
[1:52:30] quicken my mortal body hallelujah lujah
[1:52:35] so the devil is determined to trap the
[1:52:37] bride upon the earth but he'll never do
[1:52:39] it because we have a perfect sacrifice
[1:52:41] we have a perfect blood we have a
[1:52:43] perfect word that is cleanse us of all
[1:52:45] unrighteousness amen so we are not
[1:52:47] trapped there's nothing holding us here
[1:52:49] I trust you can just look in your life
[1:52:51] and say no jesus paid it all I'm only
[1:52:53] trusting in his blood
[1:52:55] I'm only trusting in his sacrifice I
[1:52:57] hope you know I heard brother Bram I
[1:52:59] think it's in the rising of the Sun or
[1:53:00] the Easter seal comes down to the end of
[1:53:02] that message 1965 he says I would hate
[1:53:05] to try and get too
[1:53:06] heaven on my visions I'd hate to try and
[1:53:09] get to heaven on my preaching he says
[1:53:11] I'm not trying to get to heaven on those
[1:53:13] things but I'm getting to heaven because
[1:53:14] of the blood of Jesus Christ because of
[1:53:17] his sacrifice and the life that was
[1:53:19] released on Calvary is coming to me
[1:53:21] that's what I'm holding on to hallelujah
[1:53:24] no brother Brahim says in Christ a
[1:53:26] mystery God revealed and she and she
[1:53:29] alone stands by it the living word for
[1:53:32] this day that's why the devil's howling
[1:53:34] these great organizations set up
[1:53:36] something to close her up
[1:53:37] they'll never do it right there's a
[1:53:41] religious persecution upon the right
[1:53:42] there's a squeeze early coming into
[1:53:44] place as I said before the Jews did not
[1:53:47] wake up one day one day they're free the
[1:53:49] next morn that wake up there in
[1:53:50] Auschwitz a squeeze came upon them and
[1:53:53] it took it took a period of time it got
[1:53:56] worse and worse and worse then finally
[1:53:58] they were in the truck concentration
[1:54:00] camps right and the squeeze has already
[1:54:02] come upon the earth I mean I can't go
[1:54:06] into hospital and and pray for anyone
[1:54:08] you know I can't go I can't go into
[1:54:10] prison and just go speak to them right
[1:54:12] there's a squeeze come hallelujah so
[1:54:16] we're already but you could remember the
[1:54:18] third pull the power of the spoken word
[1:54:21] which is in us right the third pull is
[1:54:24] already in operation amen owes us what
[1:54:27] so brother Bram said what was manifested
[1:54:29] temporarily will come into its fullness
[1:54:32] when the squeeze comes on but many
[1:54:35] people are looking for a great they have
[1:54:37] in their mind some we're all in camps
[1:54:39] and this is all going on the squeeze is
[1:54:40] already here
[1:54:41] the power of the spoken word is in the
[1:54:43] brave right that voice is on the bride
[1:54:46] once again just like a Pentecost the
[1:54:48] world will hear directly from God
[1:54:50] through the Bride of Christ hallelujah
[1:54:53] so he says they'll never do it so that
[1:54:56] means close her up
[1:54:57] these great organ so that's why the
[1:54:59] devil's howling these great
[1:55:00] organizations set something up to close
[1:55:02] her up
[1:55:03] they'll never do it she'll be taken up
[1:55:05] not closed up she is now risen and by
[1:55:08] the power of the vindicated word promise
[1:55:10] to her amen now a bride holds that
[1:55:13] promise Hedrick he told me he'd return

[1:56:02] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about
[1:56:04] it was waved over the people so the life
[1:56:06] of God was waved
[1:56:08] Dave Pentecost that wave sheaf offering
[1:56:09] the life of Christ was waved over the
[1:56:11] people and it was waved at those in the
[1:56:13] upper room said I'm gonna be like you're
[1:56:15] gonna make me like this God is looking
[1:56:17] at those people say I'm gonna make you
[1:56:18] like the wave sheaf offering God himself
[1:56:22] right and then now we've come to another
[1:56:25] season where that wave sheaf amateur
[1:56:27] life of Christ has been waved over the
[1:56:29] people this word has been waved over
[1:56:32] people and God did it as a memorial
[1:56:34] saying that this life that wasn't
[1:56:36] displaying the Prophet which is Jesus
[1:56:38] Christ will be manifested in a many
[1:56:40] membered body that they will come to the
[1:56:42] same maturity depends what part of the
[1:56:44] body you are but we'll come to our
[1:56:45] maturity right so I'm see what you're
[1:56:47] talking about it was waved over the
[1:56:49] people and the first time where it come
[1:56:51] forth for the bride age for a
[1:56:52] resurrection out of dark
[1:56:54] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:56:56] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:56:58] back again in its full power and being
[1:57:01] waved over the people by the same signs
[1:57:03] and wonders he did back there because I
[1:57:05] live you live also speaking to his wife
[1:57:08] because I live you live also what a
[1:57:10] resurrection that was and what a
[1:57:12] resurrection this is to be quickened
