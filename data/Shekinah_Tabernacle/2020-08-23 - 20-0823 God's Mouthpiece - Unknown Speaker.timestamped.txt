[42:24] the world unto himself
[42:26] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[42:28] and hath committed
[42:30] unto us the word of reconciliation now

[42:38] and as though god to beseech you by us

[44:39] in jesus christ's name amen amen god
[44:42] bless you may
[44:43] have your seats this morning and if i
[44:45] could title this i'd like to speak about
[44:47] god's mouth peace
[44:48] now we want to
[44:52] we are as the scripture said we are
[44:54] ambassadors for christ
[44:55] now if we're ambassadors for christ all
[44:57] of heaven is behind us but
[44:59] i just want to go into this little girl
[45:01] who would who was who was taken and into
[45:03] taken into neyman's neyman's house you
[45:05] know she was a slave girl
[45:07] but god had placed her there as an
[45:09] ambassador for for him
[45:11] many times we we look at the situation
[45:13] of our life and we always think it's not
[45:15] ideal but
[45:16] to god it's ideal i mean to god that's
[45:18] where he wants you to be that's that's
[45:20] that's the place he wants you to be in
[45:22] i mean he's not panicking where you are
[45:23] he knows where you are and he placed you
[45:25] there
[45:26] hallelujah so and you know it's amazing
[45:28] when you think about a
[45:29] a ambassador you know you think that
[45:31] they normally just say if the ambassador
[45:33] of the united states would come into a
[45:35] country or
[45:36] you know they would come with great pomp
[45:37] and great ceremony
[45:39] or you know air force one or whatever
[45:40] plane would land and you'd be a big
[45:42] thing
[45:43] you know but god he doesn't he doesn't
[45:45] uh he doesn't put forth his ambassadors
[45:47] that way
[45:48] he puts them forth in meekness and in
[45:50] humbleness and humility
[45:52] amen you know we know the gospel it
[45:53] doesn't shine it glows it's a different
[45:55] kind of life that comes forth and
[45:57] you know god would god would wrap his
[45:59] ambassadors or or
[46:01] or rather the outward appearance of his
[46:03] ambassadors is very different to how the
[46:04] world would view an ambassador you know
[46:06] if i was the ambassador of new zealand
[46:08] i'd go speak to another country my suit
[46:10] would be pressed my tie would be just
[46:12] right
[46:12] you know my shoes would be shining my
[46:14] hair would be cut just right you know i
[46:16] would i'd be the most presentable i
[46:17] could be and there's nothing wrong with
[46:19] that that's a good thing
[46:20] but it's just more of an outward thing
[46:22] but but to be an ambassador for christ
[46:24] is all inward
[46:26] amen so here was this little girl that
[46:28] was taken you know and
[46:29] and and and she was a slave you know she
[46:32] was taken from her family you know she
[46:33] did not choose to be there
[46:35] and if if we had our way maybe we would
[46:38] probably choose another life if we could
[46:39] have it
[46:40] you know but god chose you to to to be
[46:42] where you are in this morning and
[46:44] this may seem very general but i just
[46:46] want you to think about it god knows
[46:47] where
[46:48] he wanted you to be and you are where he
[46:50] wants you to be
[46:52] hallelujah i mean so so here she is
[46:54] she's a slave girl she
[46:56] you know faced great difficulties you
[46:57] know she was taken from her family maybe
[46:59] very loving family
[47:01] you know but but they instilled
[47:02] something in her life i mean that that
[47:04] jehovah god of israel was the real god
[47:06] he was a living god
[47:08] he wasn't just a god or a local god he
[47:10] was the god
[47:11] i mean he was the creator of heavens and
[47:12] earth and they put that in her
[47:14] and then now when great trial came up in
[47:17] naaman's house
[47:18] i mean though though he was an enemy
[47:20] though he was an enemy of
[47:21] of of her nation of her family and it
[47:24] was actually really
[47:25] his orders that caused her to become a
[47:27] slave i mean but when great crisis came
[47:29] into that home
[47:30] she could step into that role as an
[47:32] ambassador and say the right things
[47:34] i mean no doubt she could have been been
[47:37] been
[47:38] weeping for joy because now vengeance
[47:40] had come up with judgment had now come
[47:41] upon
[47:42] the enemy of israel but she she wasn't
[47:44] that kind of ambassador
[47:45] i mean and and we are not those kind of
[47:47] ambassadors either i mean our highest
[47:49] desire is that every
[47:51] man woman and child will be reconciled
[47:52] to god everyone would know him in the
[47:54] power of his resurrection
[47:56] amen and we know that if if we are an
[47:58] ambassador amen we don't just sit still
[48:01] i mean we have a message to declare we
[48:03] have a life to live we have a message
[48:05] from the king
[48:06] not just an earthly king but the king
[48:08] that jesus lives i mean he's alive
[48:10] forevermore
[48:11] that this word works yes amen it'll
[48:13] it'll transform the most violent sinner
[48:16] doesn't matter where we're from it'll
[48:17] transform someone just raised in church
[48:19] it'll change them forever more
[48:20] this word works i mean it's not just an
[48:23] empty promise but it really works you
[48:25] know
[48:26] a lot of ambassadors they go to the u.n
[48:28] and they make a lot of bluffs and they
[48:29] make just a lot of empty words
[48:31] and and a lot of the countries there
[48:32] know that they're just bluffing
[48:34] because they actually know more about
[48:35] their country than they do themselves
[48:37] and their military capability and all
[48:39] those things
[48:39] but we don't just make an empty bluff i
[48:42] mean the bride has something backing her
[48:44] up
[48:44] i mean it's not a bluff it's not a put
[48:46] on it's not photoshopped
[48:48] it's not you know a filter put in to
[48:49] make it look more powerful this word
[48:51] works
[48:52] hallelujah it'll work in our lives if we
[48:54] just let it work okay man so
[48:56] here she was she was a slave girl she
[48:58] was fa she you know she faced great
[49:00] difficulty
[49:01] but she had one line to give this was
[49:04] her moment
[49:05] nothing else was recorded in the
[49:06] scripture that she said
[49:08] but god had to place her in that
[49:10] household
[49:11] amen as a slave girl to give a message
[49:14] to
[49:14] to to a great leader in syria and it's
[49:17] so amazing where where
[49:18] you know she just says that i would to
[49:20] god that he would be
[49:22] with the prophet in in in israel
[49:26] that was all she said that was her line
[49:28] hello that's all she said that's all she
[49:30] needed to say
[49:31] many times we think our lives are not
[49:33] significant they hold no weight they're
[49:35] not going to be remembered then you know
[49:37] they're not important
[49:38] you're very important to god you're very
[49:40] important to god we know that one soul
[49:42] is worth more than ten thousand worlds
[49:45] holly you can't quantify we're priceless
[49:49] you can't you can't ensure of the bride
[49:51] of christ
[49:52] hallelujah you know your great pieces of
[49:55] artwork there comes a point where they
[49:56] just become priceless
[49:58] they can't actually put a figure behind
[49:59] that piece of artwork or that great
[50:01] piece of antiquity because it's
[50:02] priceless
[50:03] it can never be replaced we are
[50:06] irreplaceable
[50:08] hallelujah in god's mind you're
[50:09] irreplaceable i mean that's why he
[50:11] didn't
[50:12] just you know when when the penalty of
[50:14] sin had to be paid
[50:15] i mean he didn't just send a prophet or
[50:17] someone else to do it he came himself
[50:19] holy just like the three hebrew children
[50:20] that going into the father
[50:22] nebuchadnezzar's day
[50:23] he says to the angels you know you know
[50:25] brother brown would dramatize it and he
[50:26] would
[50:27] he would say now you know as they're
[50:28] being carried or as they're walking into
[50:30] the furnace let's look up a bit higher
[50:32] and he and he said let's shift the
[50:33] camera up and see because when things
[50:35] are going on on the earth
[50:36] things are happening in heaven harley
[50:38] you must always remember
[50:40] our life god is watching over us and and
[50:44] god is on his great big throne his great
[50:45] royal robes there and his majesty and
[50:47] he's
[50:48] and then and and then gabriel comes up
[50:50] to him he says good master
[50:52] have you been watching what's happening
[50:54] there in babylon
[50:56] your children are your children who have
[50:58] stood for you they're going to be thrown
[50:59] into that furnace
[51:00] let me go down there i'll just wipe them
[51:02] off the map i'll wipe babylon off the
[51:04] map he could have done it
[51:05] he could have done it but then god said
[51:07] no no gabriel you're a good angel
[51:09] you've been faithful to me ever since
[51:11] the day i created you
[51:12] but i can't let you go down so gabriel
[51:14] being a faithful angel
[51:16] put his sword back in its scabbard stood
[51:17] to attention and then wormwood came
[51:20] along
[51:20] master or great king of glory don't you
[51:23] see what's going on in babylon
[51:26] three of your children are going to be
[51:27] burning a fire they've made a stand for
[51:29] you
[51:31] i i flooded the world in the days of
[51:33] noah you let me do it
[51:34] i can flood babylon and save them he
[51:37] could have done it
[51:38] but god said god said to woman woman
[51:40] you're a good angel you've been faithful
[51:42] since i created you
[51:43] you didn't fall to satan's lie but i
[51:45] can't let you go down there and do it
[51:48] so and then and then god said no no no
[51:50] this is not an angel-sized job this is a
[51:52] god-sized job
[51:54] otherwise he said i'm going to go down
[51:55] myself and right at the right moment he
[51:58] stepped down into the fiery furnace
[52:01] and his children had a jubilee in his
[52:02] presence and the bands that they were
[52:04] the complexes the hurts the bands the
[52:06] intimidation they were bound with
[52:08] amen all the fight it was loosely from
[52:10] their trouble
[52:11] and they walked out free hallelujah amen
[52:14] so we gotta just rejoice you know
[52:16] oh i'm like i'm people say oh i'm living
[52:19] in a pressure cooker at the moment you
[52:20] need to be in that pressure cooker
[52:22] it's for your good it's not because god
[52:24] is mad with you no god's willing to
[52:25] prove himself in your life
[52:27] god's willing to deliver you from your
[52:28] trouble hallelujah like you know daniel
[52:31] was an incredible ambassador
[52:33] there's more than just one line written
[52:35] about him but he always had trouble all
[52:37] the way through his life
[52:39] the scripture would tell us that man's
[52:41] you know you know man is
[52:42] you know few days on the earth and it's
[52:44] full of sorrow
[52:46] hallelujah why are you saying hallelujah
[52:49] because if we're going through trouble
[52:50] well we're meant to go through trouble
[52:52] doesn't mean we just sit there and feel
[52:54] sorry for ourselves though we're
[52:55] ambassadors
[52:56] amen we're god is it god has has
[52:59] ordained us
[53:00] he's commissioned us he sent us forth
[53:03] hardly as ambassadors for himself
[53:05] now it's incredible when you think about
[53:07] ambassadors before they leave to a big
[53:09] meeting they'll have a
[53:10] they'll have a um they'll have a what
[53:13] they call it a
[53:14] a meeting in their own government before
[53:16] they go
[53:17] and the head of state and the different
[53:19] agencies will will will brief them on
[53:21] things
[53:22] this is our official position just like
[53:25] this say talks nuclear talks with iran
[53:27] or north korea whatever it is
[53:29] america would say this is our position
[53:32] and they'll have their briefing
[53:33] and now the ambition that the ambassador
[53:37] has to remember what the orders of the
[53:40] briefing are
[53:41] and he's got to speak by a memory what
[53:43] what his head of state has told him
[53:45] he has to speak by memory but for us
[53:48] it's not that way
[53:49] amen we don't have to remember what the
[53:51] king said amen and then come give forth
[53:54] the
[53:54] message from our king no our king goes
[53:57] in us
[53:58] and it's him that's speaking amen as as
[54:01] jesus would tell the disciples when you
[54:03] are brought before synagogues and
[54:05] and different things and you know courts
[54:07] and different things don't think of what
[54:08] to say
[54:09] my father will teach you what to say
[54:11] he'll put the words in your mouth
[54:13] so it's not you trying to remember it
[54:14] amen god will speak through you
[54:16] hallelujah so we're a different kind of
[54:18] ambassador to a natural ambassador
[54:20] because our king goes in us he's not in
[54:23] some foreign place he's not just in
[54:24] heaven brother braham says dead he's not
[54:26] just in heaven it's in you
[54:27] amen amen to the king hey hallelujah
[54:29] he's the one who who
[54:31] comes through us now daniel was an
[54:33] incredible ambassador as i was saying
[54:36] daniel would daniel would make up his
[54:38] mind before he left jerusalem i'm going
[54:40] to serve god
[54:41] wherever god sends me yeah it's amazing
[54:44] you know god has to have a witness in
[54:45] this day
[54:46] hallelujah god has to have a witness and
[54:48] he's put us here to be a witness
[54:50] and daniel had to be a witness in
[54:52] babylon that was his assignment
[54:54] he would never have picked going there
[54:55] but that's where he was sent
[54:57] hallelujah and so daniel went through an
[55:00] incredible things in his life
[55:02] and there was a lot of struggles there
[55:03] was a lot of turmoil you know he had to
[55:05] he had to walk in a
[55:07] political arena you know other you know
[55:09] even when he became basically the second
[55:11] in the kingdom the other princes
[55:13] i mean were were were trying to get rid
[55:15] of him
[55:16] and so he was going through a pressure
[55:18] cooker where he had to be careful with
[55:19] what he said and how he conducted
[55:21] himself and
[55:21] no doubt they'd try and trap him in his
[55:23] words and all these things they couldn't
[55:25] do it
[55:25] but then they realized his source of
[55:28] strength they realized his source of
[55:30] strength was his prayer to god his
[55:31] communion with god
[55:33] is what kept him walking in that way
[55:36] so now they they they tricked the king
[55:38] now we all know these stories don't we
[55:41] trick the king into in into writing a
[55:43] decree
[55:44] no man can pray to any god or any other
[55:47] man but you for 30 days or however long
[55:48] it was
[55:49] but daniel had made up his mind i'm an
[55:52] ambassador
[55:53] all of heaven's behind me hallelujah so
[55:56] so
[55:56] here he goes he prays he gets caught
[55:59] he's going to be thrown in the lion
[56:00] stand he gets thrown in the lion's den
[56:02] the there the enemies of daniel had no
[56:06] idea
[56:07] that the purpose that they actually rose
[56:09] up to try and destroy daniel in this way
[56:11] is that they would be destroyed remember
[56:14] the lion's den brought freedom
[56:16] for daniel from his enemies because
[56:18] remember before the lion's den they were
[56:20] attacking him trying to destroy him
[56:21] but after the lion's den they got thrown
[56:23] in the lines then
[56:25] so i'm going through a trial it's
[56:26] actually to just destroy
[56:28] the things that are trying to destroy
[56:30] you hallelujah all things work together
[56:33] for good
[56:34] are you with me so you know we don't
[56:36] need to be down about just rejoice
[56:38] i'm throwing in the lines in but you'll
[56:40] get out i'm in a dark place you'll get
[56:43] out
[56:44] i'm in the devil's trying to destroy me
[56:46] you'll get out
[56:47] hallelujah so don't despair remember if
[56:50] god can bring you thus far he'll take
[56:52] you all the way
[56:53] if he can bring you out of the world
[56:54] he'll take you all the way amen if he
[56:56] can save you he can save others
[56:58] hallelujah amen so so so
[57:02] the slave girl in naaman's house had one
[57:04] line
[57:05] but it's so impacted they probably would
[57:08] have had other slaves in the house
[57:10] they would have maybe said some other
[57:11] things but she said that
[57:13] that's incredible when you think about
[57:14] that statement i wish he was with the
[57:16] prophet in israel or samaria
[57:18] that was the enemy's place you know
[57:22] but she somehow just so knew if he could
[57:25] just get to that prophet
[57:26] amen he would be made well and just that
[57:29] that one phrase she was a faithful
[57:31] ambassador
[57:32] and she spoke that and it so moved on
[57:34] whoever heard it
[57:36] and it so moved on name and somehow he
[57:38] believed it too that he went his way and
[57:41] we know the rest of the story
[57:42] he came back not a leper
[57:45] hallelujah but the thing is now you
[57:47] think here's this little girl
[57:49] she's an ambassador for the god of glory
[57:53] why isn't she dressed up in great big
[57:54] robes and maybe came on a great big
[57:56] golden chariot and stopped outside
[57:58] damon's house with
[57:59] fine arabian horses leading it and you
[58:01] know all these things that's not how god
[58:03] operates
[58:03] that's how man operates that's not how
[58:05] god operates when god would have a um
[58:08] would allow
[58:08] moses to build him a tabernacle it was
[58:12] it was wrapped in badger skins it was
[58:14] not wrapped in the finest of skins
[58:16] badger skins hallelujah and god was
[58:19] projecting through that
[58:21] actually this is really to the world i
[58:23] mean what what what my ambassadors will
[58:25] look like
[58:26] they will not be the finest people they
[58:28] will not be the greatest people they
[58:29] won't be the most beautiful or handsome
[58:30] or whatever as the world would say
[58:32] but they are my ambassadors if we would
[58:35] just look at you know
[58:36] many people have reconstructed that um
[58:38] tabernacle
[58:39] it doesn't look like much does it it's a
[58:41] tent
[58:42] that's really all it is it's just a tent
[58:44] but yet almighty god decided this is
[58:46] where i'm gonna dwell
[58:48] hallelujah and we look in the mirror
[58:50] sometimes and we
[58:52] we think oh boy but we're ambassadors
[58:56] amen don't worry about don't worry about
[59:00] the outward
[59:02] amen hallelujah now
[59:06] the apostles would would would stand
[59:08] before the sanhedrin
[59:10] and they would say they were asked
[59:15] what shall we they said you know they
[59:18] said to them
[59:20] by what power or by what name
[59:23] have you done this healing the man by
[59:25] the gate beautiful
[59:27] and they begin to tell them this is who
[59:30] we
[59:31] this is the name and this is the power
[59:32] that we have raised this man up in the
[59:34] name of jesus christ
[59:36] so here were the ambassadors for christ
[59:38] in that day
[59:40] hallelujah and they're saying actually
[59:41] the one backing us up is the one you
[59:42] crucified
[59:45] the high priest had a lot of influence
[59:47] behind him but it was the wrong kind of
[59:48] influence
[59:49] he was an ambassador for a church system
[59:52] he was an ambassador for god himself
[59:55] and we want to be very careful that we
[59:56] do not become the same way
[59:58] i remember but remember this gospel came
[1:00:00] not in word only but in power
[1:00:02] and a demonstration of the holy ghost
[1:00:04] and much assurance
[1:00:06] hallelujah so we don't want to be like
[1:00:08] them we want to be
[1:00:09] like the first church was and we
[1:00:11] understand that the
[1:00:12] that because we're in an age of
[1:00:14] restoration that we
[1:00:16] will be and are being restored back
[1:00:18] before the church ages began
[1:00:20] that space of time before the ephesian
[1:00:22] age ever started we are being restored
[1:00:24] back to that
[1:00:25] not to the fussing and the trouble and
[1:00:26] the stewing in the churches but god
[1:00:28] dwelling in his people once again
[1:00:30] amen hallelujah amen
[1:00:35] now as i said
[1:00:39] an earthly ambassador has to go by
[1:00:42] memory
[1:00:43] has to go by memory what he's briefed on
[1:00:46] and what she's briefed on then she goes
[1:00:47] and gives that briefing
[1:00:49] but we're not the same way our king goes
[1:00:52] in us and he does the speaking
[1:00:54] he does the living he does the talking
[1:00:56] hallelujah i like that don't you
[1:00:58] he does it all um amen we just make
[1:01:00] ourselves available
[1:01:03] amen so so the apostle paul would say in
[1:01:05] ephesians 5
[1:01:06] for no man ever yet hated his own
[1:01:10] flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it
[1:01:12] even as the lord the church
[1:01:14] for we are members of his body and of
[1:01:16] his flesh and of his bones
[1:01:19] and then in first corinthians 12 and 12
[1:01:21] 4 as the body is one and has many
[1:01:23] members
[1:01:24] and all the members of that one body
[1:01:26] being many
[1:01:28] are one body so also is christ for by
[1:01:31] one spirit we're all baptized into one
[1:01:33] body
[1:01:33] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[1:01:35] be bound or free
[1:01:37] we have all been made to drink into that
[1:01:39] spirit
[1:01:41] we are the body of christ amen
[1:01:44] by the new birth we are the we are the
[1:01:46] body of christ
[1:01:47] i mean so we're not ambassadors for a
[1:01:49] church we're not ambassadors for
[1:01:51] shekinah tabernacle
[1:01:52] that'd be the word most endearment
[1:01:54] that'd be the that'd be my worst fear
[1:01:57] as as rust be ambassadors of an earthly
[1:02:00] system
[1:02:01] right but we are ambassadors for the
[1:02:03] lord jesus christ
[1:02:04] amen hallelujah we are his body upon the
[1:02:07] earth
[1:02:08] amen he has no mouth but yours he has no
[1:02:10] ears but yours no eyes but yours no feet
[1:02:12] you but your
[1:02:13] no hands but yours no heart but yours
[1:02:16] hallelujah we are his body amen
[1:02:20] now as i said last um
[1:02:24] last sunday when when the lord made the
[1:02:27] complaint
[1:02:29] against this age and said because thou
[1:02:32] art lukewarm i'll spew the out of
[1:02:34] out of my mouth and we know that from
[1:02:37] from reading the latest in church age
[1:02:39] brother brown would say that being
[1:02:40] spewed out
[1:02:41] out of his mouth is that it's not that
[1:02:43] they are rejected as in cast out
[1:02:45] but they no longer speak for him right
[1:02:49] i mean so so we never want to get into
[1:02:51] that kind of condition
[1:02:52] where we speak for ourselves i mean
[1:02:55] jesus said it's not me it's actually the
[1:02:57] you know the father beareth witness of
[1:02:58] what i do
[1:03:00] amen so we don't want to speak for
[1:03:02] ourselves we want to speak for him
[1:03:04] and we want him to speak for himself
[1:03:05] through us
[1:03:07] amen amen now
[1:03:11] as as he had said in the church age book
[1:03:12] we are carried in his bosom
[1:03:14] way back in the unknown ages before time
[1:03:17] we were in his mind
[1:03:18] we were in his sheepfold i mean we are
[1:03:20] in a sheepfold we're in his pasture
[1:03:22] but never in his mouth but what is in
[1:03:25] the mouth of the lord the word is in his
[1:03:27] mouth
[1:03:28] matthew 4 and 4 i'm just repeating this
[1:03:29] from last sunday i trust you don't mind
[1:03:31] a bit of repetition
[1:03:32] i mean but he answered and said it is
[1:03:34] written man shall not live by bread
[1:03:35] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:03:37] out of the mouth of god
[1:03:38] the word is supposed to be in our mouths
[1:03:41] too now we know that the church is his
[1:03:43] body it is here taking his place
[1:03:45] what will be the mouth of the church i
[1:03:48] mean what will be in the mouth of the
[1:03:49] church
[1:03:49] will be the word amen first peter 4 and
[1:03:52] 11 if any man speak let him speak is the
[1:03:54] oracle's the word of god
[1:03:56] second peter 1 and 21 for the prophecy
[1:03:58] came not an
[1:03:59] old time by the will of man but holy men
[1:04:01] of god spake as they are moved by the
[1:04:03] holy ghost
[1:04:04] and we are still being moved by the holy
[1:04:06] ghost you say but i'm not a preacher but
[1:04:08] the inspiration of god can move your
[1:04:09] life
[1:04:10] hallelujah that you'll be a witness amen
[1:04:13] remember
[1:04:14] it's not about preaching a sermon we
[1:04:16] should live a sermon first
[1:04:18] amen many will never read the bible but
[1:04:20] they'll read you
[1:04:22] hallelujah amen for the prophecy came
[1:04:26] not an old time by the will of men but
[1:04:28] holy men of god spake is our move by the
[1:04:30] holy ghost
[1:04:31] then what is wrong with these people of
[1:04:33] the last day they have gotten away from
[1:04:35] the word
[1:04:36] they are no longer fervent about it they
[1:04:38] are lukewarm about it i'm going to prove
[1:04:40] it to you right now
[1:04:42] he says the baptists have their creeds
[1:04:44] and dogmas based on the word and you
[1:04:45] can't shake them
[1:04:46] they say the apostolic days of miracles
[1:04:49] are over and there's no
[1:04:50] and there is no baptism with the holy
[1:04:52] ghost subsequent to believing
[1:04:54] the methodists say based on the word
[1:04:56] there is no water baptism sprinkling is
[1:04:58] not baptism
[1:04:59] and that sanctification is the baptism
[1:05:01] with the holy ghost
[1:05:02] the church of christ majors in
[1:05:03] regenerational baptism and in too many
[1:05:06] cases they go down dry sinus and come up
[1:05:08] wet ones
[1:05:08] yet they claim their doctrine is word
[1:05:10] based go right down the line and come to
[1:05:12] the pentecostals do they have the word
[1:05:14] give them the word test and see
[1:05:16] they will sell out the word for a
[1:05:17] sensation just about
[1:05:19] every time if you can produce a
[1:05:21] manifestation like oil and blood and
[1:05:23] tongues and other signs
[1:05:24] whether in the word or not or whether
[1:05:26] properly interpreted from the word
[1:05:28] the majority will fall for it but what
[1:05:31] has happened to the word the word has
[1:05:33] been put aside
[1:05:34] so god says i'm gonna i'm going i am
[1:05:37] going
[1:05:38] against you all i'll spew you out of my
[1:05:40] mouth this is the end
[1:05:42] for the seven out of seven ages i've
[1:05:44] seen nothing but men esteeming their own
[1:05:46] word above mine
[1:05:48] so at the end of this age i will spew
[1:05:50] thee out of my mouth it's all over i'm
[1:05:51] going to speak all right yes i am going
[1:05:53] to be here in the midst of the church
[1:05:55] the amen of god the faithful and true
[1:05:57] witness will reveal himself
[1:05:58] and it will be by my prophet oh yes it
[1:06:01] is so
[1:06:02] amen there it is he is sending a
[1:06:04] vindicated prophet he is sending a
[1:06:06] prophet after
[1:06:06] almost 2 000 years he is sending someone
[1:06:09] who will be so far from organization
[1:06:11] education in the
[1:06:12] world of religion that is john the
[1:06:14] baptist and elijah of old he will
[1:06:15] hear only from god and he will have thus
[1:06:17] saith the lord and will speak for god
[1:06:20] he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it
[1:06:22] is declared in malachi 4 and 6
[1:06:24] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:06:26] back to the fathers he will bring back
[1:06:28] the elect of the last day
[1:06:30] and they will hear a vindicated prophet
[1:06:32] give the exact truth as it was with paul
[1:06:34] he will restore the truth as they had it
[1:06:37] and those elect with him
[1:06:38] in that last day will be the ones who
[1:06:40] truly manifest the lord
[1:06:42] and be his body and be his voice and
[1:06:44] perform his works hallelujah
[1:06:46] amen do you see it hallelujah i believe
[1:06:50] i'm looking at the fulfillment of that
[1:06:52] hallelujah amen
[1:06:55] he would he would make a statement as
[1:06:57] well he says
[1:06:58] he says and the people in the land he
[1:07:00] says he says when the methodists fail
[1:07:02] god raised up others and so it has gone
[1:07:04] through the years until in this last day
[1:07:06] there is again another people in the
[1:07:08] land who under their messenger will be
[1:07:10] the final voice to the final age
[1:07:13] there will be a final mouthpiece upon
[1:07:15] the earth hallelujah and those people
[1:07:17] under their messenger will be the final
[1:07:19] voice
[1:07:20] to the final age they will be the final
[1:07:22] group of ambassadors upon the earth
[1:07:24] amen for a gentile bride hallelujah and
[1:07:28] we have received a messenger in this day
[1:07:30] i know this is very elementary but but
[1:07:32] we have received a messenger
[1:07:33] i mean that word that has been released
[1:07:35] has transformed us
[1:07:36] i mean it has made us new creatures in
[1:07:38] christ i remember all old things have
[1:07:40] become you know passed away everything's
[1:07:42] become new
[1:07:42] we have been transformed by the holy
[1:07:44] ghost i mean as the apostle paul would
[1:07:47] say
[1:07:47] he says the seal of my apostleship is
[1:07:49] that year in the lord
[1:07:51] that was the proof that he was a true
[1:07:52] ambassador is that the hearers of his
[1:07:54] word
[1:07:55] were in christ i mean they were in the
[1:07:57] lord they were sealed into the day of
[1:07:58] their redemption
[1:07:59] with the holy ghost and that's the seal
[1:08:01] even you say of the prophets you could
[1:08:03] say apostleship
[1:08:04] is that the bride is in the lord it's
[1:08:06] not in the church it's not in the world
[1:08:08] it's in the lord hallelujah
[1:08:11] amen that's that's first corinthians
[1:08:13] nine and uh two
[1:08:14] amen now yes sir the church is no longer
[1:08:18] the mouthpiece of god this is back in
[1:08:20] the church ages it's its own mouthpiece
[1:08:22] so god is turning on her he will
[1:08:24] confound her through the prophet
[1:08:26] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:08:29] be in her
[1:08:30] hallelujah not just a man's voice not
[1:08:33] just a messenger's voice
[1:08:35] if i can put it that way but god's voice
[1:08:37] yes and and
[1:08:38] and that's not just us quoting scripture
[1:08:40] and quoting quotes and pushing play
[1:08:42] that's god living that's that's the
[1:08:44] people who actually
[1:08:45] have come under the messenger are now
[1:08:47] the manifestation of that message
[1:08:50] right where the bible's no longer ink on
[1:08:52] paper it's now living in a people
[1:08:54] amen and that's a true ambassador for
[1:08:55] christ is when the word puts on flesh
[1:08:57] and you and i
[1:08:58] amen then we're an ambassador for christ
[1:09:00] amen hallelujah
[1:09:02] well how long does that take just
[1:09:04] surrender everything pour it out to him
[1:09:06] pull your whole life out you become an
[1:09:07] ambassador amen this is not a 12
[1:09:10] 12 year program phd program masters
[1:09:13] program
[1:09:14] that's not that i'm glad it's not that i
[1:09:16] don't want to go back to university
[1:09:19] hallelujah amen so
[1:09:23] so the voice of god will be in her yes
[1:09:25] it is for it says in the last chapter of
[1:09:26] revelation verse 17
[1:09:28] the spirit and the bride say come i mean
[1:09:30] so what the spirit saying what the bride
[1:09:32] is saying is the same thing
[1:09:34] and and that should be our hearts cry
[1:09:37] should we come during the waters of life
[1:09:40] come find rest for your weary soul you
[1:09:42] won't find any satisfaction out there
[1:09:44] come here
[1:09:45] you won't find it in religion come and
[1:09:47] come and drink of the lord jesus
[1:09:49] taste and see that the lord is good
[1:09:51] hallelujah
[1:09:52] it's more than understanding things it's
[1:09:54] more than doctrine more than explaining
[1:09:55] things it's a life
[1:09:56] it's a power of the holy ghost in our
[1:09:58] lives that's what it is hallelujah
[1:10:00] amen praise god
[1:10:03] i just say lord just pour in your holy
[1:10:05] spirit
[1:10:07] let's have more i want more of him amen
[1:10:10] there's more to have and he says once
[1:10:13] more
[1:10:14] will the church sorry once more will the
[1:10:17] word
[1:10:18] world sorry once more will the world
[1:10:21] hear directly from god as at pentecost
[1:10:25] but of course that word bride will be
[1:10:27] repudiated as it was in the first stage
[1:10:29] he says once more
[1:10:30] the world will head direct from god as
[1:10:32] it was at pentecost what happened at
[1:10:34] pentecost they were filled
[1:10:35] they were filled with the holy ghost and
[1:10:37] god was speaking when peter was
[1:10:39] preaching that first ever sermon that
[1:10:40] wasn't peter's mind
[1:10:42] that wasn't him studying something and
[1:10:43] putting it together god just came down
[1:10:45] and spoke through him
[1:10:46] and when they were brought before the
[1:10:47] sanhedrin and thou said what name
[1:10:49] by what name or what power have you done
[1:10:51] this it says and peter was filled with
[1:10:53] the holy ghost
[1:10:54] i mean god stepped into that courtroom
[1:10:56] and began to bring an indictment against
[1:10:58] that generation
[1:10:59] holly and it's the same thing with you
[1:11:00] and i let him speak through you
[1:11:02] let him anoint your life let him be the
[1:11:04] worker on the worksite let him be the
[1:11:06] student at school
[1:11:07] i mean let him be the mother let him be
[1:11:09] the dad let him be hella be the sibling
[1:11:12] in your life hallelujah
[1:11:15] hey if it could happen for peter it
[1:11:16] could happen for us oh but i'm not in
[1:11:19] some big persecution but there's a
[1:11:20] squeeze
[1:11:21] there's a pressure in this age
[1:11:23] hallelujah but god has given us power
[1:11:27] do you think the ambassador of the
[1:11:28] united states is really intimidated by
[1:11:30] other countries
[1:11:32] do you think he really is or she is you
[1:11:35] think that he would come down to a
[1:11:37] little place that doesn't be intimidated
[1:11:38] by us oh no
[1:11:41] he knows who he is he knows who's
[1:11:43] backing him up and he knows the
[1:11:45] capability of the military
[1:11:47] right he's not afraid he's not he's not
[1:11:49] wondering i wonder if these f-35
[1:11:51] fighters work
[1:11:52] i wonder if these cruise missiles if
[1:11:54] these atomic bombs work he knows they
[1:11:56] work
[1:11:57] he knows what their seals can do he
[1:11:58] knows what their military can do he's
[1:12:00] not afraid
[1:12:01] he's been given orders go say this
[1:12:04] and peter could stand there in front of
[1:12:06] a sanhedrin and he knew what
[1:12:09] his military can do he knows what his
[1:12:11] king does
[1:12:12] i mean he knows he just seen him do
[1:12:14] incredible things for three and a half
[1:12:16] years
[1:12:16] and then he saw him come down and fill
[1:12:18] him he saw him just raise the man from
[1:12:20] the gate beautiful he saw incredible
[1:12:21] things
[1:12:22] he knew what god could do so he wasn't
[1:12:25] intimidated
[1:12:26] hallelujah even when the apostle paul
[1:12:29] was brought before king agrippa
[1:12:31] and and he would relate the road on on
[1:12:34] on the damascus wrote the damascus
[1:12:36] experience and he says i was not
[1:12:37] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[1:12:40] and and then he even said to him i
[1:12:41] believe if i get mixed up with this
[1:12:43] forgive me but but he said i
[1:12:45] i wish you were as i was except for
[1:12:47] these bonds
[1:12:48] because in reality who was the one in
[1:12:50] chains it wasn't the apostle paul it was

[1:13:09] is set free is free indeed
[1:13:10] and we're being set free not to be

[1:14:15] that way
[1:14:16] he's he is he is the epitome of long
[1:14:18] suffering
[1:14:19] hallelujah hallelujah why because he
[1:14:22] can't lose a part of himself
[1:14:26] hallelujah amen
[1:14:29] so once more this world will hear direct
[1:14:32] from god as at pentecost
[1:14:34] oh when brother brown was here we need
[1:14:37] him to come back and then then
[1:14:39] then the world will head direct from god
[1:14:40] to the pentecost no no no no
[1:14:42] you can't look no this is not him
[1:14:44] returning sure he will return with the
[1:14:46] dead in christ
[1:14:47] but it's all over then and we're going
[1:14:48] to go with them to meet the lord in the
[1:14:50] air
[1:14:50] but we the prophet is not coming back to
[1:14:53] to to live a life and preacher
[1:14:55] preach a message that god will you know
[1:14:57] the world will hear from god again is at
[1:14:58] pentecost
[1:14:59] no the bride is here for it amen we are
[1:15:02] in the fulfillment of revelations 10 8
[1:15:04] to 11.
[1:15:05] take the book eat the book prophesy
[1:15:07] again
[1:15:09] this is where we are we're not sitting
[1:15:11] still we're not standing silent
[1:15:13] we're speaking of life amen we're
[1:15:15] speaking a word hallelujah
[1:15:16] you say but i'm not a preacher your life
[1:15:18] screams
[1:15:20] your life preaches your life preaches to
[1:15:22] this dying world
[1:15:24] you may just be going through pack and
[1:15:25] save your preaching you may be dropping
[1:15:27] the kids off at school you're preaching
[1:15:29] you may be at school you're preaching
[1:15:31] you may be on the work site you're
[1:15:32] preaching
[1:15:33] and you can be having a bad day and
[1:15:35] things can be going all wrong and you
[1:15:36] can be worried about all kinds of things
[1:15:38] but your life more than just these five
[1:15:41] senses more than how you're feeling but
[1:15:42] your life
[1:15:43] hallelujah because if we have the holy
[1:15:45] ghost there's an atmosphere of power
[1:15:47] around us
[1:15:47] whether we um really fathom that or not
[1:15:51] there's an atmosphere
[1:15:53] hallelujah who's ever stepped into a bad
[1:15:56] atmosphere
[1:15:58] yep you can feel it that's right but who
[1:16:00] stepped into a good atmosphere
[1:16:03] but the problem with the bad atmosphere
[1:16:04] is if you stay in it long enough you'll
[1:16:06] get used to it
[1:16:07] and it will become your new new normal
[1:16:09] well that's trending some others will
[1:16:11] say it'll become the new normal
[1:16:12] but when you step into the presence of
[1:16:14] god and you've never been in his
[1:16:16] presence before
[1:16:17] it's all this is what i've been looking
[1:16:19] for my entire life
[1:16:20] that becomes your new normal and we can
[1:16:23] even get used to what we have
[1:16:25] and what we enjoy hallelujah we should
[1:16:28] never take it for granted
[1:16:30] every time god comes down every time his
[1:16:32] word opens up every time he delivers and
[1:16:33] helps or guides
[1:16:35] we say lord i'm so thankful i'm so
[1:16:37] thankful you haven't left me here i'm
[1:16:38] not floundering around in the darkness
[1:16:40] but you are my light in the darkness
[1:16:43] hallelujah
[1:16:45] amen it's incredible what god will
[1:16:48] take us through to be his ambassador
[1:16:52] naomi was living a good life in israel
[1:16:56] she had two sons she had a husband but
[1:16:59] there's a famine there was trouble
[1:17:00] so they left and went to moab and she
[1:17:03] got to a spot in her life

[1:17:07] living witness
[1:17:10] and even know me and and and and i can't
[1:17:12] remember her husband's name off top of
[1:17:14] my head but but the two meanings of
[1:17:15] those
[1:17:16] names mean pleasant worship so now here
[1:17:19] pleasant worship was now coming into
[1:17:21] moab
[1:17:22] and it attracted two girls
[1:17:25] one was awful one was ruth but then as
[1:17:28] this pleasant worship was going on
[1:17:30] trouble came into the house sickness
[1:17:32] came death came
[1:17:34] and now naomi's life now this is the
[1:17:37] power of her testimony
[1:17:39] this is her testimony if she could stand
[1:17:41] here and testify to you she'd say well
[1:17:44] we had a house of pleasant worship
[1:17:47] we're in moab i lost my husband i lost
[1:17:50] my sons-in-law
[1:17:52] my life came to such a bitter point
[1:17:54] where i said don't call me know me
[1:17:56] anymore
[1:17:57] i'm not pleasant my life is bitter call
[1:17:59] me mara my life has become bitter
[1:18:02] you would think that was a failure of a
[1:18:04] life
[1:18:05] let's be honest now you think that'd be
[1:18:07] a failure of a life you think
[1:18:09] she fell she backslid left the lamb
[1:18:11] because of trouble
[1:18:12] now she's failed but she had no idea
[1:18:15] that her life would impact someone
[1:18:17] that wasn't just out there she was in
[1:18:20] her home
[1:18:21] you know our children see the best and
[1:18:22] the worst of us
[1:18:24] we can put on a church face and we can
[1:18:26] you know and we can say hallelujah
[1:18:28] everything can be fine but there's
[1:18:29] trouble and they see the best and the
[1:18:31] worst of us
[1:18:33] ruth saw the best and the worst of naomi
[1:18:36] and she saw her life fall apart and not
[1:18:39] just her life
[1:18:40] but her own life fell apart because her
[1:18:41] husband died but there was something
[1:18:44] in naomi's life where ruth had to make a
[1:18:46] decision
[1:18:47] she said let your god be my god
[1:18:51] your people will be my people where you
[1:18:53] die i'm going to die
[1:18:55] i'm not going to leave you hallelujah
[1:18:58] hallelujah that was the impact she was
[1:19:01] an ambassador
[1:19:03] hallelujah you know many times we think
[1:19:06] everything will be perfect you know
[1:19:07] i feel like i can be a witness today
[1:19:10] you're not tired you're feeling good
[1:19:12] you know mental space is fine having a
[1:19:15] good time
[1:19:16] i can be a witness oh no no no that's
[1:19:18] not always that way it goes beyond your
[1:19:20] five senses and how you're feeling
[1:19:22] hallelujah but her life impacted ruth
[1:19:26] that ruth said i'm going with you
[1:19:29] let your god be my god well how did god
[1:19:32] deal with her
[1:19:33] lost her husband lost her sons now she's
[1:19:36] a better woman my life has become bitter
[1:19:38] that was her testimony about herself but
[1:19:41] something impacted ruth so much as i'm
[1:19:43] going with you
[1:19:45] hallelujah so don't beat yourself up if
[1:19:47] you're going through a hard time
[1:19:49] amen she went through a hard time years
[1:19:51] of hard time
[1:19:53] but ruth someone had to go be an
[1:19:55] ambassador to ruth
[1:19:56] because ruth had to come into the
[1:19:58] lineage of jesus christ

[1:20:52] supernatural way in your life
[1:20:54] hallelujah brother brown was beyond the
[1:20:56] curtain of time before he realized he
[1:21:00] just heard a voice he was just thinking
[1:21:01] you know sing about his age and where he
[1:21:03] was and
[1:21:03] what she did more for the lord and when
[1:21:05] he says that i feel
[1:21:07] a pico millimeter big you know
[1:21:10] all seriousness you know but then he
[1:21:13] just hears a voice would you like to see
[1:21:14] pastor curtin of time
[1:21:16] he says it would help me so well and
[1:21:19] then he's taken there beyond here you
[1:21:20] know before he realizes he's there
[1:21:23] you know before we realize we'll be
[1:21:25] there in a moment a twinkling of an eye
[1:21:28] will be there oh am i gonna be ready for
[1:21:30] that moment if you've given you all and
[1:21:32] he's filled you
[1:21:33] you're ready hallelujah
[1:21:36] he was there before he realized he had
[1:21:38] been an ambassador on the earth
[1:21:40] and the place he had been an ambassador
[1:21:42] for he was taken to
[1:21:44] remember where your heart is that's
[1:21:45] where your treasures are so if your
[1:21:46] heart is in the world this is where your
[1:21:48] treasures are
[1:21:50] and this world has got an expiry date
[1:21:52] right it's already gone rotten it's
[1:21:54] falling apart
[1:21:55] i mean it has no it's got no
[1:21:57] satisfaction lasting that will ever give
[1:21:59] you
[1:22:00] i mean so if your heart is in the world
[1:22:01] this is that's the place you're an
[1:22:03] ambassador for
[1:22:04] but if your heart is in the lord if your
[1:22:06] heart is in heaven you're an ambassador
[1:22:08] for him
[1:22:10] hallelujah what are you doing laying up
[1:22:12] treasures in heaven
[1:22:14] how's your investment going real good
[1:22:17] aren't you afraid that this latest
[1:22:19] economic downturn will make you lose
[1:22:20] your investment i can't
[1:22:22] roth i mean i mean rusted moths and
[1:22:24] whatever can't can't can't touch it
[1:22:26] it can't devaluate it can't go down it
[1:22:29] can't be go negative
[1:22:30] it's good it's secure hallelujah
[1:22:34] amen so we want to be in bed and then he
[1:22:36] was there before he even realized
[1:22:38] it's amazing when when you think about
[1:22:40] when when brother brown was there and he
[1:22:42] was
[1:22:43] you know he was going through the great
[1:22:44] trial of his life and his and
[1:22:46] and and hope i think she just died or
[1:22:48] was dead and she went and spoke to
[1:22:50] he went and spoke to her and she came
[1:22:52] back to life for a bit you know a brief
[1:22:54] moment
[1:22:55] and she began to just relate a few
[1:22:57] things
[1:22:58] to him and she said it's such a
[1:23:01] wonderful place
[1:23:03] he said you know you preach so much
[1:23:05] about it but you know
[1:23:07] you know so little about it how great it
[1:23:09] really is
[1:23:11] this holy ghost just this heaven that
[1:23:13] you tell about
[1:23:16] and i think often if we could really
[1:23:18] just grasp
[1:23:19] and i pray the lord would just you know
[1:23:22] there's so many voices in this world
[1:23:24] and they can actually deafen you to the
[1:23:26] voice of god
[1:23:28] but if we could just lock in to the
[1:23:31] voice of god
[1:23:33] and realize that heaven is a far greater
[1:23:35] place than we can fathom
[1:23:37] it's a far greater place than we can
[1:23:40] ever imagine
[1:23:41] but yet we seem to know so little about
[1:23:43] it in a way sure the prophet can come
[1:23:45] back and
[1:23:46] and and he relates how it is and i
[1:23:48] believe he saw it i believe he was there
[1:23:49] i believe i'm going to
[1:23:52] but then he would when when when he
[1:23:53] would relate that
[1:23:55] uh in in one place he would sing that
[1:23:58] song you know let me look past the
[1:23:59] curtain of time and he says oh lord let
[1:24:03] them look
[1:24:04] past the curtain of time so he's not
[1:24:06] just relating now can i do it because he
[1:24:08] had been there but now he's relating
[1:24:10] lord
[1:24:11] may they look can they look past the
[1:24:13] curtain of time
[1:24:14] and i heard that and i think lord i want
[1:24:16] to look past the curtain of time
[1:24:18] i want to know what it's like over there
[1:24:21] not just mentally but just have such a
[1:24:22] taste
[1:24:24] and you know when you think about it
[1:24:26] when we gather like this
[1:24:27] and god begins to move and all the
[1:24:30] issues and the troubles of
[1:24:31] of the week have been slowly fritted
[1:24:33] away during the service now we're here
[1:24:34] to rejoice and
[1:24:36] you know and the holy spirit comes down
[1:24:38] and begins to speak to us
[1:24:39] what is that that's that future home
[1:24:44] that's heaven coming down actually
[1:24:46] giving you a look past the curtain of
[1:24:48] time
[1:24:48] maybe not with with your natural eyes
[1:24:51] right but he's moving on your heart
[1:24:53] to say there is a land beyond the river
[1:24:56] and this is you know
[1:24:58] hallelujah hallelujah you know you know
[1:25:01] when we when we cross that
[1:25:02] when we cross that chasm when this when
[1:25:06] this guy is no longer 35
[1:25:08] 18 to 21. hallelujah
[1:25:12] and we'll look kind of kind of close to
[1:25:14] how we were in that photo brothers in
[1:25:15] the back
[1:25:16] hallelujah do you know what we'll say it
[1:25:19] was worth it
[1:25:20] it was worth it it was worth it lord
[1:25:23] jesus it was worth it
[1:25:25] and then we'll see that little slave
[1:25:27] girl at neyman's house you'll say it was
[1:25:28] worth it
[1:25:29] amen and then and then naomi yeah no me
[1:25:32] will say it was worth it
[1:25:33] and ruth will say it was worth it it was
[1:25:36] worth it to leave my land and go to this
[1:25:38] place
[1:25:38] holy it was worth it hallelujah and
[1:25:40] we'll be gathered with the saints of the
[1:25:42] ages it was worth it
[1:25:44] hallelujah all christ ambassadors will
[1:25:48] feel the same way
[1:25:50] they'll never be regret i wish i could
[1:25:52] do this there was no no no no
[1:25:53] no no no worth it it was worth it
[1:25:57] hallelujah
[1:26:00] brother brown would say an adoption
[1:26:02] message 1960.
[1:26:04] he says now he says now preaching
[1:26:07] usually catches a sinner brings them
[1:26:08] under condemnation by the word but
[1:26:10] teaching places the man to do
[1:26:12] um positionally what he is what he is
[1:26:15] right amen and we can never rightly be
[1:26:19] able to have faith until positionally we
[1:26:20] know what we are
[1:26:22] now if the united states of this fair
[1:26:24] land here sent me over to russia as an
[1:26:26] ambassador
[1:26:27] of this nation to russia then if they
[1:26:29] have officially sent me to russia
[1:26:31] all the power that's in the united
[1:26:33] states has has is behind me
[1:26:36] my word is just same as the united
[1:26:38] states if i have been recognized
[1:26:40] as an ambassador and then if
[1:26:44] god has sent us to be his ambassadors
[1:26:46] all the power that's in heaven
[1:26:48] all that god is all of his angels and
[1:26:50] all of his power stands behind our words
[1:26:53] if we are correctly and ordained sent
[1:26:56] messengers
[1:26:56] to the people god has to honor his word
[1:26:59] for he has so solemnly written
[1:27:02] whatsoever you bind on earth will i bind
[1:27:04] in heaven
[1:27:05] whatsoever you loose on earth i'll
[1:27:06] loosen heaven and i'll give unto thee
[1:27:08] the keys to the kingdom
[1:27:10] oh such great promises he's given the
[1:27:12] church
[1:27:14] you mean little old me all all of all of
[1:27:16] heaven's behind you
[1:27:18] all of heaven all the angels all that
[1:27:20] god is
[1:27:21] invested into you hallelujah
[1:27:25] he would say in confirmation of the
[1:27:27] commission 1962 that's why i believe
[1:27:30] that all who come our way calling
[1:27:32] themselves christians ambassadors
[1:27:34] sent from heaven they should have a
[1:27:35] confirmation of their commission
[1:27:37] i believe there should be a confirmation
[1:27:39] of their commission
[1:27:40] now we realize that jesus said here in
[1:27:42] marks
[1:27:43] the 16th chapter that all that he sent
[1:27:47] out on commission will bear the
[1:27:49] confirmation
[1:27:50] these signs shall follow them that
[1:27:52] believe
[1:27:53] now he didn't say they may be they'll
[1:27:55] follow or they ought to follow
[1:27:57] they will follow hallelujah
[1:28:00] amen amen hallelujah
[1:28:06] the bride is the mouthpiece of god in
[1:28:07] this day
[1:28:10] amen well how could you say that
[1:28:13] god is in his word but if the words are
[1:28:15] new if the words are new not your
[1:28:17] opinion but if the words are new
[1:28:20] amen brother brown would say in the
[1:28:21] church age book and i was real tempted
[1:28:23] to put up pictures of dissected frogs
[1:28:25] and who's ever dissected anything
[1:28:29] i i kind of went around biology at
[1:28:31] school and i ended up doing biochemistry
[1:28:32] at uni but
[1:28:33] it was not from the biology anyway yeah
[1:28:35] i was going to put some you just googled
[1:28:36] maybe
[1:28:37] okay parents google dissection first but
[1:28:40] you know i was going to put something up
[1:28:41] i thought
[1:28:41] you know there's these frogs and their
[1:28:43] guts are out and their brains and you
[1:28:44] know because
[1:28:45] it's been pulled apart analyzed what's
[1:28:47] here this is the heart this is the liver
[1:28:48] there's the kidney and
[1:28:50] you know but but brother and says now he
[1:28:53] has cried out to this last age
[1:28:55] you have the word you have more bibles
[1:28:57] than ever but you are not doing anything
[1:28:59] about the word except dividing and
[1:29:02] hacking it
[1:29:02] into pieces that when i read that word
[1:29:04] dividing i thought dissecting
[1:29:06] and then when hacking it to pieces i
[1:29:08] remember when i was a about
[1:29:10] 10 who's 10 here 10 11 12. so
[1:29:13] all my friends farm up the east coast
[1:29:15] here in gisborne
[1:29:16] most beautiful place in the world in new
[1:29:18] zealand i'd say
[1:29:19] but otherwise you can say men back me up
[1:29:21] a little bit there we go
[1:29:22] i know the south island's nice too but
[1:29:24] you know you know we would we would get
[1:29:26] the
[1:29:26] get the meat for the farm dogs and there
[1:29:29] was a little stump
[1:29:30] and we had a little hatchet and we get
[1:29:32] these bits of meat and hack it to pieces
[1:29:34] and then divvy it out we don't want to
[1:29:37] why are you saying that
[1:29:38] we don't want to hack the word to pieces
[1:29:40] just chop it just haphazardly there's a
[1:29:42] nurse
[1:29:42] and then even even dissect it it's good
[1:29:45] to examine the word so i'm saying study
[1:29:47] the word
[1:29:47] but don't take pits bits you like in
[1:29:49] bits you don't like
[1:29:51] you know you can dissect things so
[1:29:52] finally you can take veins out and and
[1:29:54] capillaries and different things and
[1:29:56] you know you can dissect real fine
[1:29:58] things out of an animal
[1:29:59] we don't want to finally do that to the
[1:30:01] word of god
[1:30:03] amen taking what you want and leaving
[1:30:06] what you don't want
[1:30:07] he says you're not interested in living
[1:30:10] it but
[1:30:10] debating it what's a debate you get your
[1:30:13] facts and you present your facts this is
[1:30:15] my position
[1:30:16] i remember high school first high school
[1:30:18] i went to somehow i ended up on the
[1:30:20] debating team
[1:30:21] you know just i don't know why but there
[1:30:22] i was and yeah you find yourself in
[1:30:24] places how did i get here i don't know
[1:30:26] and i'm still asking that question today
[1:30:28] but anyway you know but but you know so
[1:30:30] so you'd have a for and against and this
[1:30:31] is the topic and it was just a debate
[1:30:34] but christianity is not a debate it's a
[1:30:36] life
[1:30:37] it's a life hallelujah it's not a debate
[1:30:39] he says odd sooner you were hot or cold
[1:30:41] if you were cold and rejected
[1:30:43] i could stand that if you were white hot
[1:30:46] as to know it's truth and live it
[1:30:48] who knows it's truth who lives it too
[1:30:51] lord live it in
[1:30:52] through me hallelujah i would praise you
[1:30:54] for it but when you simply take my word
[1:30:56] and don't honor it
[1:30:57] i in return must refuse to honor you
[1:30:59] i'll spew thee out of
[1:31:00] um spewing out for you nauseate me now
[1:31:03] that's from the church age book all that
[1:31:04] now to honor something means to hold it
[1:31:06] in high respect or great esteem
[1:31:10] it's the quality of knowing and doing
[1:31:12] what is morally right
[1:31:14] so to respect something or sorry to
[1:31:17] honor it you gotta
[1:31:18] hold it in high respect and great esteem
[1:31:22] who's got the pearl of great price who's
[1:31:25] got the pearl of great price
[1:31:27] who's actually realized this is a pearl
[1:31:29] of great price this word
[1:31:31] and you hold it up and you look and you
[1:31:33] sell all you give everything else
[1:31:35] all of your life whatever you used to do
[1:31:38] sell it
[1:31:39] take it to cash converters get rid of it
[1:31:42] because i've got the real pearl
[1:31:44] the pearl of great price if you really
[1:31:46] recognize that
[1:31:48] and and i believe i'm looking at people
[1:31:49] who do that
[1:31:51] then you will then you will honor it
[1:31:55] hallelujah i believe i'm looking at
[1:31:57] people that that
[1:31:58] love the lord more than their own lives
[1:32:01] amen hallelujah and we are interested in
[1:32:05] living it
[1:32:05] not debating it we're not interested in
[1:32:08] dividing and hacking it into pieces
[1:32:10] the word we want the whole thing we want
[1:32:13] all of the lord jesus
[1:32:14] i did not marry just his arm who's ever
[1:32:17] been to a wedding in the and
[1:32:18] and the bride marries an arm or a leg
[1:32:21] or the head or the nose or part of the
[1:32:24] groom
[1:32:25] no that's not a marriage that's weird
[1:32:29] right there's something real weird going
[1:32:30] on but unfortunately
[1:32:33] that's how christians do they will take
[1:32:35] part of the word they'll take the arm
[1:32:38] oh i'm saved by grace but they don't
[1:32:40] know what grace is
[1:32:41] and they just use an excuse look i've
[1:32:43] i'm married or they just take the
[1:32:44] finger or the toe or whatever they just
[1:32:46] take part of the word
[1:32:49] we want the whole word the whole lamb
[1:32:52] all the god is i want i have it tears
[1:32:56] bits off my back because you know i've
[1:32:58] got to go through deep things and god's
[1:32:59] gonna
[1:33:00] you know rearrange my life in a very you
[1:33:02] know
[1:33:03] big way so be it amen
[1:33:06] hallelujah but we want the whole world
[1:33:08] we don't want to just take part of the
[1:33:10] message
[1:33:10] take the whole thing amen
[1:33:15] we are his ambassadors
[1:33:18] all of heaven is behind us now if the
[1:33:21] voice
[1:33:22] of god is in the bride i'm just going to
[1:33:23] kind of
[1:33:26] there's something called time it keeps
[1:33:27] moving
[1:33:30] anyway jesus would say in john 14 and 12
[1:33:34] and brother brown would would
[1:33:35] relate this scripture all the way
[1:33:37] through his ministry he says verily
[1:33:39] verily i send you he that believeth on
[1:33:41] me
[1:33:41] the works that i do shall he do also and
[1:33:44] greater works than they shall he do
[1:33:46] because i go unto my father and he
[1:33:48] didn't just put that scripture on
[1:33:49] himself that was for the believer
[1:33:50] because jesus says he that believeth on
[1:33:52] me
[1:33:54] hallelujah amen so so he that believeth
[1:33:56] on me the works that i do he shall do
[1:33:58] also this is the sign that they are my
[1:34:00] ambassador
[1:34:02] hallelujah so let's examine very quickly
[1:34:06] what now did the church do
[1:34:09] they didn't just sit in the upper room
[1:34:12] they burst it out of that place
[1:34:14] they see jesus lives he's in me now they
[1:34:17] burst it out there
[1:34:18] and begin to tell the world we need
[1:34:20] wisdom to do it but
[1:34:21] you know there's a spirit in the world
[1:34:22] and don't be shocked by this statement i
[1:34:24] know you're all sitting down which is
[1:34:25] good
[1:34:25] but there's a spirit in the world that
[1:34:27] wants us to stop being a witness yes sir
[1:34:30] right that's why you sometimes yo
[1:34:33] sometimes you feel led not to say
[1:34:34] anything
[1:34:35] but sometimes it's just a pressure
[1:34:36] actually don't say anything
[1:34:39] so give us wisdom lord what's the worst
[1:34:42] thing that can happen
[1:34:45] hallelujah well actually the worst thing
[1:34:48] that could happen is you just go to
[1:34:49] heaven quicker than other people
[1:34:54] well that's what happened to the
[1:34:55] apostles do you think they regretted it
[1:34:58] do you think they would have done it all
[1:35:00] again do you think the apostle paul was
[1:35:01] saying i don't want to
[1:35:02] you know no i've run the race i fought
[1:35:05] the fight i've kept the faith
[1:35:07] now crown of life is laying up for me
[1:35:10] hallelujah
[1:35:13] you know when i when i was um learning
[1:35:16] how to sail a boat
[1:35:17] when i was who's ten again around there
[1:35:19] nine ten
[1:35:21] you know you come to a realisation
[1:35:24] the worst thing can happen is you just
[1:35:25] get wet hey the boat can do some
[1:35:28] assaults you could swim after it you
[1:35:29] know things can happen but
[1:35:30] the worst thing is you just get wet what
[1:35:32] is there to fear about it just get your
[1:35:34] sea legs and get in the thing
[1:35:36] and it can be the same thing being a
[1:35:37] witness yes
[1:35:39] lord lead us in doing so right but
[1:35:41] what's the worst thing oh
[1:35:43] the conversation's just shut down that's
[1:35:46] all right
[1:35:47] just move on you know maybe just put a
[1:35:49] little bit in next day
[1:35:50] not a little bit and maybe just leave it
[1:35:52] for a little bit and talk about
[1:35:53] something else
[1:35:54] oh lord help us i'm preaching to myself
[1:35:56] too
[1:35:58] amen so
[1:36:01] in the early church they cast the devil
[1:36:03] out
[1:36:04] they didn't put up with him they cast
[1:36:06] the devil out and my name thou shall
[1:36:08] cast out devils
[1:36:10] amen so a principle work of the church
[1:36:13] is casting out of satan
[1:36:15] right that is a principle work of the
[1:36:17] church it's not to put up with him
[1:36:19] are they just going through you know
[1:36:22] brother brown would talk about his
[1:36:23] daughter rebecca
[1:36:25] and and and and the trials she was going
[1:36:28] through she was living in pressure
[1:36:31] she was the prophet's daughter he wasn't
[1:36:33] well liked
[1:36:34] and she had to live with this kind of
[1:36:36] thing and but
[1:36:38] but yet go out to school and you know
[1:36:39] but there was this thing hanging over
[1:36:41] and she got so mad saying
[1:36:42] you just want me to be a wall flower all
[1:36:44] my life and dinner you know because you
[1:36:45] want to go play
[1:36:46] piano your rock and roll music on the
[1:36:48] piano and stuff and whatever more
[1:36:50] and probably because the reason she did
[1:36:51] that is because that teacher thought she
[1:36:53] was good
[1:36:55] so now oh there's a person that likes me
[1:36:57] there's no stigma here
[1:36:59] are you following amen but then but then
[1:37:02] so so she just blew up at her parents at
[1:37:04] her dad
[1:37:06] and then one hand brother brandon said
[1:37:07] well that's just her going through that
[1:37:09] time but then on the other hand she said
[1:37:10] well he said well that's actually the
[1:37:12] devil
[1:37:13] and it was just like a tantrum we have
[1:37:16] to be
[1:37:16] well then and then he said i felt like
[1:37:19] taking my belt off and running after her
[1:37:21] but then he realized no no no we're
[1:37:23] gonna be here we're gonna commit it to
[1:37:25] god
[1:37:26] hallelujah pray for her and be her buddy
[1:37:30] amen so we're going to look at
[1:37:34] you know the problem is the older
[1:37:36] someone gets the more refined their
[1:37:38] tantrum can be
[1:37:43] i know i've preached on the effects of
[1:37:45] tantrums and you know but but
[1:37:47] you know like a little kid oh boy you
[1:37:49] know they're having a tantrum
[1:37:51] but an adult maybe their eye just
[1:37:53] twitches a little bit and you know
[1:37:54] something's going on
[1:37:55] and they're planning something
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] uh that's not an experience by the way
[1:38:00] so you know but you know
[1:38:03] but you know it can be a very refined
[1:38:06] tantrum
[1:38:07] ultra him i'll show her oh boy
[1:38:12] lord jesus help us you know
[1:38:15] i like how the prophet says we are
[1:38:17] failures to begin with
[1:38:19] we are not perfect people and i'll i'll
[1:38:22] just say for myself i'm not a perfect
[1:38:23] we're we are work in progress
[1:38:25] how do you know construction is done
[1:38:27] when the body's changed
[1:38:30] hallelujah but even being under
[1:38:32] construction god sends us forth as an
[1:38:34] ambassador
[1:38:36] hallelujah well i've got to become
[1:38:38] perfect then i can become a witness
[1:38:39] well you're not going to be a witness
[1:38:43] we're perfect in christ we're sinlessly
[1:38:44] perfect right
[1:38:46] by his blood but uh maturity
[1:38:50] perfection we are ongoing
[1:38:55] amen now i don't know how i got into
[1:38:59] that but here i am
[1:39:01] so the principal work of the church or a
[1:39:03] principal work of the church is the cast
[1:39:05] out the devil
[1:39:06] lord give us wisdom how to do it don't
[1:39:08] put up with it
[1:39:10] get rid of it but god give us wisdom how
[1:39:12] to do it
[1:39:14] you know it's amazing brother brown
[1:39:15] would um he would uh
[1:39:18] you know a couple would no i think it's
[1:39:19] just a wife or a husband would yeah
[1:39:21] husband would would come to him brother
[1:39:23] bram
[1:39:24] help me my marriage is falling apart you
[1:39:27] know i believe this but my
[1:39:29] wife believes something else and you
[1:39:31] know she came in and i just cast the
[1:39:33] devil out of her in the name of jesus
[1:39:34] christ and began to pray and call on god
[1:39:37] and
[1:39:37] now the whole things just blow up and um
[1:39:41] yeah and he said no that's not how you
[1:39:42] cast a devil out
[1:39:44] what what a what a imagine that
[1:39:48] honey i'm home safe didn't get out of
[1:39:50] here the never jesus
[1:39:53] i'm not but that's what some people do
[1:39:55] i'm going to cast it
[1:39:57] no he says actually love cast the devil
[1:40:00] out
[1:40:00] and there's actually the vice versa
[1:40:02] where a woman comes to the comes to
[1:40:04] brother brown says my husband doesn't
[1:40:05] believe this and
[1:40:06] our family's falling apart and we're so
[1:40:08] separated and what should i do and i've
[1:40:09] tried to cast the devil out of him
[1:40:11] but but nothing's working he's just
[1:40:12] pushing him the other way and and and
[1:40:14] and then brother bam says well what's
[1:40:16] his favorite pie
[1:40:18] and she's probably thinking what why
[1:40:20] what what's this got to do with dessert
[1:40:22] this is serious
[1:40:23] and he's giving a serious answer what's
[1:40:25] his favorite pie well cherry or what
[1:40:27] know what it is but you know
[1:40:28] you all know the story i trust so make
[1:40:30] him the favorite pie
[1:40:32] give it to him when he comes home sit up
[1:40:34] on his lap and give him a big hug and a
[1:40:35] kiss
[1:40:36] and all these things and the devil was
[1:40:38] cast out
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:42] amen thank you lord jesus give us wisdom
[1:40:45] that's the prophet of the age giving
[1:40:47] marriage counseling
[1:40:49] love goes a long way it's not a well
[1:40:52] i'll do this you do this that's not love
[1:40:54] no love just goes a long way
[1:40:56] amen so the principle work of the church
[1:40:59] is to cast out the devil
[1:41:01] now i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of not be
[1:41:04] not be too much further with this
[1:41:07] amen so
[1:41:11] brother abraham says in the church age
[1:41:12] book he says let me show you another
[1:41:14] reason why satan hates this book of
[1:41:15] revelation of jesus christ in the church
[1:41:18] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[1:41:19] yesterday today and forever and he
[1:41:20] changes not the devil knows that
[1:41:22] amen he knows that a whole lot more than
[1:41:24] do 90 of the theologians
[1:41:26] he knows that since god is immutable in
[1:41:28] his nature
[1:41:29] then he's just as immutable in his way
[1:41:31] so he doesn't change
[1:41:33] his nature doesn't change what he was in
[1:41:35] moses day
[1:41:36] same what he was before the foundation
[1:41:38] of the world
[1:41:39] same today and his ways are the same
[1:41:43] thus satan knows assuredly that the
[1:41:46] original church of pentecost with the
[1:41:48] power of god mark 16 in action is the
[1:41:50] true church that jesus claims as his own
[1:41:52] all else is false it has to be but now
[1:41:56] remember this christ and the true
[1:41:57] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:41:59] acts but the book of revelation shows
[1:42:01] how the antichrist spirit would come
[1:42:03] into the church and defile it
[1:42:05] make it lukewarm formal and powerless it
[1:42:08] exposes satan
[1:42:09] revealing his works which are the
[1:42:11] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:42:13] and the discrediting of god's word right
[1:42:15] down to the time he's cast into the lake
[1:42:16] of fire
[1:42:17] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:42:19] knows if the people get the true
[1:42:20] revelation of the true church and what
[1:42:22] she is and what she stands for
[1:42:25] do we know who we are and what we stand
[1:42:26] for amen
[1:42:28] and that she can do the greater work she
[1:42:30] will be an invincible army
[1:42:32] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:42:34] spirits within the framework of the
[1:42:35] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:42:37] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:42:39] spirit satan will be powerless before
[1:42:41] her
[1:42:42] he'll be as definitely thraltered today
[1:42:44] as when christ withstood his every
[1:42:46] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:42:48] desert
[1:42:48] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[1:42:50] it with true revelation in our lives the
[1:42:53] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:42:55] but we will prevail over them
[1:42:59] hallelujah it's amazing brother makes a
[1:43:01] statement
[1:43:03] because people think i can't speak i'm
[1:43:05] not talented in any way
[1:43:07] i can't sing i can't dance i can't play
[1:43:10] an instrument
[1:43:11] i can't preach but brother and says
[1:43:13] there are paid preachers and paid
[1:43:15] assistants paid ministers of music and
[1:43:17] education paid choirs paid custodians
[1:43:19] programs and entertainment
[1:43:20] all grading all costing great sums
[1:43:24] but for all that the power is is
[1:43:27] decreasing speaking of the church
[1:43:29] yes the church is rich but the power is
[1:43:31] not there
[1:43:32] god moves by his spirit not by the
[1:43:35] amount of money or
[1:43:36] talent in the church he said i can't
[1:43:39] sing
[1:43:40] but you can sing in such a way that god
[1:43:42] can come down
[1:43:44] hallelujah i can't hold a tune don't
[1:43:46] matter
[1:43:48] amen i'm not qualified moses would give
[1:43:51] the same excuses
[1:43:53] and god just got annoyed at him you're
[1:43:56] my ambassador moses i can't speak
[1:44:01] so don't feel sorry for what you view as
[1:44:03] being in insignificant
[1:44:05] you know if we believed we had it all
[1:44:06] together god just wouldn't use us
[1:44:09] remember a sheep always needs a shepherd
[1:44:11] doesn't matter how old how young that
[1:44:13] sheep is how long it's been in the herd
[1:44:15] how big its horns are whatever
[1:44:16] it needs a shepherd we always need a
[1:44:18] shepherd to guide us
[1:44:20] hallelujah well i'm insufficient that's
[1:44:23] a good place to be
[1:44:24] brother braham says i think i um i think
[1:44:27] it's in um i can't remember what service
[1:44:28] but he says that we must conquer the
[1:44:30] thought of human ability
[1:44:33] we must actually conquer that thought
[1:44:34] that we are able to do it that's what
[1:44:36] he's saying
[1:44:37] that's him that does it amen
[1:44:40] now intercession i'm just going to go
[1:44:44] through
[1:44:44] listen this point and then
[1:44:48] we'll be done okay i'm about to close
[1:44:52] everyone wakes up intercession
[1:44:56] the bride has a power of intercession
[1:44:58] right our prayers can change the world
[1:45:01] oh
[1:45:02] you mean the whole globe maybe not the
[1:45:04] whole globe but one person
[1:45:06] one person amen it can change the
[1:45:08] economics of one country for one soul to
[1:45:10] come out
[1:45:12] hallelujah yeah it's amazing the devil
[1:45:14] puts up the iron curtain to stop the
[1:45:16] gospel going in and stopping the jews
[1:45:18] coming out he couldn't do it
[1:45:20] i mean the bamboo curtain went up trying
[1:45:22] to stop the gospel going in
[1:45:24] couldn't do it amen the message has gone
[1:45:26] in the bride's been called out
[1:45:29] hallelujah amen he puts up education he
[1:45:33] puts up all things to try and stop the
[1:45:34] bribe being called out of a place
[1:45:36] he came too late amen but we have
[1:45:39] remember god hears our prayer
[1:45:41] who believes god hears us when we pray
[1:45:43] who believes
[1:45:44] amen so if if we believe he hears us
[1:45:48] when we pray
[1:45:49] then our words have power with god amen
[1:45:52] hallelujah amen so we have power
[1:45:56] to to intercede even as jesus would say
[1:45:59] simon simon behold satan has desired to
[1:46:01] have you
[1:46:02] that he may sift you as wheat but i have
[1:46:04] prayed for thee that they
[1:46:06] that thy fail not and when thou art
[1:46:09] converted
[1:46:10] strengthen thy brethren so peter was in
[1:46:12] a dangerous position
[1:46:13] he was a believer but he hadn't received
[1:46:15] the holy ghost yet he hadn't been
[1:46:16] converted
[1:46:18] but jesus knew that the devil was trying
[1:46:20] to destroy him
[1:46:22] but he says i have prayed for you that
[1:46:23] you won't fail
[1:46:25] amen i believe we can do the same for
[1:46:27] one another it's important to lift one
[1:46:29] another in prayer
[1:46:30] you say well i don't know what to pray
[1:46:32] for here i am
[1:46:34] this is about three hours prayer right
[1:46:35] here
[1:46:37] i can't think of what to pray for pray
[1:46:38] for someone else or i need the lord to
[1:46:40] move in my life pray for someone else
[1:46:42] and then god will move on your behalf
[1:46:45] now aaron was an incredible man it's
[1:46:48] amazing what god can do with a person
[1:46:50] aaron would would would be uh moses
[1:46:54] god said that moses was a god to the
[1:46:56] people and aaron was his prophet
[1:46:59] he would raise the rod and he would do
[1:47:01] different things and miracles would
[1:47:02] happen
[1:47:03] but he came to a spot in his life that
[1:47:05] that he would make a golden car for the
[1:47:07] people
[1:47:07] they had been called out in an exodus
[1:47:09] they were there waiting for the word to
[1:47:10] come down the mountain
[1:47:11] but pressure got put on him by the
[1:47:13] people and he made that golden calf
[1:47:15] now did this change now now my question
[1:47:18] is did this change god's mind about
[1:47:20] aaron being the high priest
[1:47:22] so the same one that made this golden
[1:47:24] calf was the same one that would go into
[1:47:26] the holy of holies with the blood
[1:47:28] on behalf of the people and then even
[1:47:30] aaron would be told when
[1:47:32] you know this is a number 16 and moses
[1:47:35] said
[1:47:35] unto aaron because a plague had broken
[1:47:37] out upon the people
[1:47:38] he says take a censor and put fire there
[1:47:41] in from off the altar and put on incense
[1:47:43] and go quickly into the congregation and
[1:47:45] make an atonement for them
[1:47:47] for there is wrath going out from the
[1:47:49] lord the plague has begun
[1:47:50] and aaron took as moses commanded and
[1:47:53] ran into the midst of the congregation
[1:47:55] and behold the plague was begun upon the
[1:47:57] people and he put on incense and made an
[1:47:59] atonement for the people
[1:48:00] and he stood between the dead and the
[1:48:02] living and the plague
[1:48:04] was stayed well what's incense in the
[1:48:07] bible prayer
[1:48:09] but he was instructed take the censer
[1:48:12] take the incense run into the midst of
[1:48:14] the people stand between the living and
[1:48:16] the dead
[1:48:16] make an atonement for them hallelujah
[1:48:19] and if aaron didn't do it the plague
[1:48:21] would have continued on but because
[1:48:22] aaron did that as he is instructed by
[1:48:24] the word
[1:48:25] amen the plague was stayed what's that
[1:48:27] got to do with me there's a plague of
[1:48:29] unbelief striking this world
[1:48:31] it's far worse than covert 19 far worse
[1:48:33] than cancer far worse than the flu
[1:48:35] as that spirit of ladies here of
[1:48:37] unbelief that's gripped the world
[1:48:40] so the plague has begun but we can
[1:48:44] as moses did i mean as aaron did stand
[1:48:46] between the living and the dead
[1:48:49] and make and be and be an intercessory
[1:48:51] for
[1:48:52] for people amen that that plague doesn't
[1:48:55] strike them and if it struck them they
[1:48:57] get delivered of it
[1:48:59] amen hallelujah so we
[1:49:03] do you know who you are i'm just a
[1:49:06] message believer
[1:49:09] i'm the bride of christ i've been
[1:49:11] invested with authority
[1:49:14] just like a policeman he'd be you know
[1:49:15] he can be the smallest policeman
[1:49:17] in the whole world go out there in front
[1:49:20] of these big trucks he holds up his
[1:49:21] badge that truck's got to stop
[1:49:24] hallelujah why because all of the police
[1:49:26] forces behind that man
[1:49:28] and it's the same thing with us we can
[1:49:30] we can be the smallest believer in the
[1:49:31] world
[1:49:32] amen but we have the badge of believer
[1:49:34] hallelujah and all of
[1:49:36] all of heaven is is behind that badge
[1:49:39] hallelujah so aaron would run and he
[1:49:42] would make an atonement for the people
[1:49:44] and he would stand between the dead and
[1:49:45] the living
[1:49:47] hallelujah and we can do the same thing
[1:49:49] and it's actually part of our commission
[1:49:51] stand between the dead and the living
[1:49:52] make an atonement for them as and pray
[1:49:54] and deceit for them that god will work
[1:49:56] on their behalf
[1:49:59] and he was the one who made the golden
[1:50:00] calf
[1:50:02] i've done a lot of bad things in my life
[1:50:04] he made a golden calf
[1:50:07] didn't change god's mind about him
[1:50:11] amen so we have the right to intercede
[1:50:15] you know brother brown would would speak
[1:50:17] about the
[1:50:19] evidence of the holy ghost and we know
[1:50:22] he says as many things we know it's the
[1:50:23] fruit of the spirit we know it's
[1:50:24] receiving the word for your day
[1:50:26] but he would go to ezekiel 9 and he
[1:50:29] would relate to
[1:50:30] those that signed cry for the
[1:50:32] abominations done in the city
[1:50:34] and he would actually say now that's an
[1:50:36] evidence
[1:50:38] of the holy ghost now i know that's a
[1:50:40] pretty big thing to swallow sometimes
[1:50:42] because we get conditioned to live in
[1:50:44] this world
[1:50:45] we get used to living this way with
[1:50:48] the sin that's out there but he said how
[1:50:51] many people were actually sighing cry
[1:50:54] for the abominations down the city but
[1:50:55] yet be full of joy and rejoicing at the
[1:50:58] same time
[1:50:59] so i'm not saying we should be incumbent
[1:51:00] down the world so bad the world's so bad
[1:51:02] but we should have a burden amen that
[1:51:06] this
[1:51:07] there's so much evil on the streets
[1:51:08] today spirits running rampant
[1:51:12] shouldn't we be built in such a way to
[1:51:14] actually not be used to it
[1:51:17] we shouldn't be adjusted to living in
[1:51:19] this world
[1:51:21] now that doesn't mean we go be a monk in
[1:51:23] some monastery somewhere we have to live
[1:51:24] in this world
[1:51:25] but sin should actually bother us
[1:51:29] sin should bother us iniquity should
[1:51:31] bother us
[1:51:32] i mean help people it's not member you
[1:51:35] know there's a saying
[1:51:37] love the sinner but hate the sin
[1:51:39] absolutely but there has to be a time
[1:51:41] where we actually try and pluck them
[1:51:42] from the fire
[1:51:44] we should have a burden if we really
[1:51:46] love people and
[1:51:48] and i'm preaching very much to myself
[1:51:49] right now if we really love people we
[1:51:51] should have a burden for them
[1:51:53] lord save them help them open their eyes
[1:51:57] lord deliver them lord there's so much
[1:51:59] sin down in the city
[1:52:00] there's so much wickedness done your
[1:52:01] brother brown would say how many
[1:52:03] abortions were done in chicago last
[1:52:05] night
[1:52:06] or whatever more how many people were
[1:52:07] killed basically murder
[1:52:09] state sanctioned murder how many were
[1:52:11] done and and then and then he'd look
[1:52:13] about phoenix and so on he said
[1:52:15] is it better now or was it better when
[1:52:16] the indians first came through their
[1:52:18] score and
[1:52:18] squad whatever it was called you know
[1:52:20] they they just came through and the
[1:52:21] coyotes drunk out the river and
[1:52:22] was it better then or is it better now
[1:52:25] all the sin is being done
[1:52:28] but we we live in this world we need to
[1:52:30] be able to see the difference between
[1:52:31] right and wrong
[1:52:33] right we we must oh but people will
[1:52:37] think that that
[1:52:38] that i'm judging them i'll just say this
[1:52:41] they'll be judged one day
[1:52:44] whether you like it or not and how we
[1:52:47] approach people shouldn't be a whole
[1:52:48] bunch of condescending way
[1:52:50] they should actually want what we have
[1:52:52] amen
[1:52:53] and we should live in such a way that
[1:52:55] people should know that we are not
[1:52:56] afraid to talk about our lord
[1:52:59] amen help us lord jesus
[1:53:06] but we want to be his ambassadors he
[1:53:09] says those that sight and cry for the
[1:53:10] abomination abominations done in the
[1:53:12] city
[1:53:13] they were they had the seal of god in
[1:53:15] their foreheads
[1:53:16] they were sealed in their foreheads we
[1:53:18] should never be accustomed now i trust
[1:53:20] this is the right way sometimes i say
[1:53:22] things and i cringe for the next week i
[1:53:23] said i said that law like this
[1:53:25] but you know we shouldn't be adjusted to
[1:53:27] this world
[1:53:29] right sure it's evil
[1:53:33] it's meant to be an evil age but it's
[1:53:34] the greatest age as well at the same
[1:53:36] time
[1:53:36] but we should never say well that's just
[1:53:38] how people should be people shouldn't
[1:53:40] be as they are here
[1:53:43] you know people should be believers
[1:53:46] walking with god that's actually what
[1:53:47] we're made to do
[1:53:48] we're not made to be following sin and
[1:53:50] be chained by the devil we'll actually
[1:53:52] be made to walk free with the lord jesus
[1:53:54] that's how man is actually built to be
[1:53:56] you know imagine what it'd be like if
[1:53:58] everyone just be well be the millennium
[1:53:59] wouldn't it be incredible
[1:54:01] if every man woman and child become a
[1:54:02] believer god just
[1:54:04] you know but we should be
[1:54:08] you know i i pray you know don't be
[1:54:10] discouraged and well doing
[1:54:12] well i'm just plowing along and it
[1:54:14] doesn't seem like anything's happening
[1:54:16] ruth came in because of naomi i mean
[1:54:20] that little slave girl was in neyman's
[1:54:21] house just for that one bit
[1:54:23] and she was an ambassador she was a
[1:54:25] faithful and true witness
[1:54:26] amen who wants to be a faithful and true
[1:54:28] witness
