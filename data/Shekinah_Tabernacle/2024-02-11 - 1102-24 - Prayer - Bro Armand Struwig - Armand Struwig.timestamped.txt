[3:18] [Music]
[6:01] oh
[6:03] here it's my first
[6:05] [Music]
[6:09] time we had the um mechanics we just
[6:12] needed the Dynamics to make it all
[6:16] work and um in the film world when
[6:19] something's not
[6:21] working sometimes it's we we call it an
[6:23] ear
[6:25] Gap when you've got a you've got a this
[6:28] is silly thing to say but yes an air
[6:30] gate when you have a device that's not
[6:32] working and it's The Simple Solution is
[6:35] to plug it in because there's air
[6:36] between two
[6:38] chords so we had a slight ear Gap this
[6:41] morning praise the lord it's good to be
[6:44] here it's good to be in the house of
[6:46] God and to to be able to
[6:50] stand and worship and praise the Lord to
[6:53] be able to come into His presence and
[6:55] just give the Lord
[6:56] Praise You Know regardless of what what
[6:58] we might be going through or any sort of
[7:00] situation I I've been I I keep a lot of
[7:04] the stuff you know that I go through
[7:05] just to myself you just go through it
[7:07] and the Lord leads you through but you
[7:09] know I've had a a very hard challenging
[7:12] year and there's been a lot lot of
[7:14] things you know sometimes when you go
[7:16] through things the Lord sort of gives
[7:18] you an answer delivers you and you you
[7:21] can overcome whatever situation but this
[7:23] one's been a bit different all I've ever
[7:25] got anytime ever is just walk on some
[7:28] days you don't know which way to walk
[7:30] you're like which way there's no I don't
[7:31] even I can't see any sort of Direction I
[7:33] can't even figure out which where to put
[7:35] my foot in what sort of Direction you
[7:38] know but the Lord takes you through
[7:39] things for a reason and it's every time
[7:41] it's just walk on walk on there's never
[7:43] any answer as such as just just walk on
[7:46] you know and I as I recall the armor of
[7:48] God only has armor at the front cuz you
[7:50] just walk on you just walk on and um I
[7:55] was getting a b mopy myy to Shannon the
[7:57] other night you know having a a little
[8:00] wing I don't winge too often but now and
[8:02] then I
[8:03] do and um she sort of tells me off stop
[8:08] [Music]
[8:09] complaining and um I talked to this this
[8:14] guy I deal with him in film a lot he's a
[8:17] film lawyer and he and he and he said he
[8:19] said to me I want to send you this um a
[8:21] film a documentary this guy made and he
[8:23] made it for a certain amount I want to
[8:24] show you the effects on it and see see
[8:26] what you think about it he said it's in
[8:28] a it's in a USB form I'll I'll Courier
[8:30] it to you and I had him cier to the um
[8:35] Factory where we are and after I
[8:38] finished having a little mopy mopy I
[8:40] remembered that this little package was
[8:42] there that this guy had sent and it came
[8:47] in a nice little well I opened up the
[8:48] package and it came in a nice little tin
[8:50] it was like a very professional DV uh
[8:52] USB so you'd open up the tin and it
[8:54] would have it in there nice the US band
[8:56] it was could be played on different
[8:58] devices and that
[9:00] but I opened up the tin and I looked at
[9:02] the name of this thing and I read the
[9:04] tin I thought that's strange and it said
[9:05] march
[9:10] on that happened to be the name of of
[9:13] the documentary cuz it was about the uh
[9:15] soldiers at the military camp in
[9:17] featherston and it was called march
[9:19] on so it's not just walkon anymore it's
[9:22] march
[9:23] on so we' got a new command march on so
[9:27] let's stand this morning and let's
[9:29] regardless of what we might be going

[41:43] there to Brother TZ Brother
[41:45] TZ I love you bro God bless you what an
[41:48] awesome man of
[41:50] God you are enough so today if you just
[41:53] put that first oh no leave the slide for
[41:56] now let's go to Revelation 5 and and
[41:59] here in Revelation 5 what happens is the
[42:02] Lamb steps forth and he's going to take
[42:04] this book of redemption this book where
[42:06] our names are written on the one he paid
[42:08] was such a such a dear price his life
[42:12] blood marted you know everything he took
[42:15] he's coming forth he's going to take
[42:16] this book and we'll just we'll just read
[42:18] a bit there and it says and I saw in the
[42:20] right hand this is John of him that sat
[42:23] on the throne a book
[42:26] written within on the backside sealed
[42:28] with Seven Seals so he's now going to
[42:30] open this book but he has to first get
[42:32] this book the title deed and I saw a
[42:35] strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice
[42:37] who is worthy to open his book and to
[42:40] lose the seals
[42:42] thereof and no man in heaven or in the
[42:45] Earth or neither under the Earth was
[42:47] able to open this book neither to look
[42:49] there
[42:50] on and I WEP much because there was no
[42:53] man found worthy to open and to read the
[42:56] book book neither even to look in it so
[42:58] to look there on and one of the elders
[43:01] said to me he says this weip not behold
[43:05] the line of the tribe of Judah the root
[43:07] of David he prevailed to open that book
[43:11] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof
[43:13] hallelujah hallelujah so he's
[43:15] proclaiming this is this is done here is
[43:18] the Lamb stepping forth and I beheld low
[43:21] in the midst of the throne and the four
[43:24] beast and in the midst of the elders
[43:25] stood the lamb that has been slain
[43:28] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[43:30] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[43:33] unto all the Earth and he came and he
[43:36] took the book out of the right hand of
[43:38] him that sat upon the throne and when he
[43:41] had taken it now this is my verse when
[43:43] he had taken the book The Four Beast of
[43:45] four and 20 Elders fell down before the
[43:48] lamb having everyone them Harps and
[43:51] golden veils full of odors which are the
[43:55] prayers of the
[43:57] Saints so this glorious event just took
[44:01] place Jesus Christ steps forth he takes
[44:04] the book he's going to open these seals
[44:06] and the the biggest gift Heaven has to
[44:08] offer him is the praise of the Saints
[44:11] hallelujah amen you may be seated may
[44:14] the Lord just have a blessing upon this
[44:16] word I'm just going to pray again say
[44:18] Lord Jesus may you just step out of this
[44:20] book lord and may you step into each one
[44:22] of our home each one of our our personal
[44:25] space Lord deep into our heart Lord that
[44:27] that closet within the closet Lord that
[44:30] that place where we really need you to
[44:32] speak to us father may you just step
[44:34] forth now Lord and speak to anyone and
[44:36] everyone individually and Lord may you
[44:39] be exalted in our midst and may you just
[44:41] bless the reading of your word and what
[44:42] comes off in the name of our Lord Jesus
[44:45] Christ amen amen so let's put that first
[44:48] one on so my thought was
[44:52] prayer and and I've been thinking about
[44:54] prayer for a long time and and me and
[44:56] brother um Ed was stimulating a little
[44:59] bit about it but prayer is
[45:02] powerful amen prayer is so powerful I I
[45:06] I don't understand I think we we under
[45:08] we don't realize the power of what a
[45:11] Christian has that prayer sometimes it
[45:13] feels you you praying to a ceiling
[45:15] you're not getting anywhere but but just
[45:18] keep praying cuz because it's I'm not
[45:21] going to get ahead of myself but prayer
[45:23] is the anchor is the it's the f ship
[45:26] with God it's the it's the intimate part
[45:28] with God it is where we we we get a one
[45:32] in-one audience with the King it's
[45:34] prayer there's no one else there just
[45:37] you and God it's prayer and see what the
[45:40] devil has
[45:41] done is the devil has robbed your
[45:44] time he's made us busy he gave each one
[45:48] of us a device in our hand he gave us
[45:50] YouTube on the TV he gave us all the
[45:52] likes and flicks and clicks and whatever
[45:55] you may call it he's he's he's taking
[45:57] your
[45:59] time I want to ask a question and this
[46:02] might be a very weird question but I'm
[46:04] going to demonstrate something when last
[46:06] did you just do
[46:18] this when L did you just do
[46:20] this went on the park B somewhere away
[46:23] from everything no device
[46:27] nothing and just went and sat down and
[46:30] just
[46:33] went when
[46:36] loss when L if you just stayed there and
[46:39] just said I'm going to stay
[46:41] up when last did you clear your mind of
[46:44] everything around you I'm not talking
[46:46] meditation we need to meditate upon the
[46:48] word day and night but get the business
[46:50] out of you completely and just sit and
[46:53] just
[46:54] go
[46:57] when last have you seen how busy the
[47:00] devil is keeping us hey he's just
[47:04] keeping us running every day nonstop
[47:06] just run run run run run think think
[47:08] think think thought thought thought
[47:09] thought bubble bubble like like click
[47:10] click flick flick all that he just
[47:13] that's your mind have you ever stopped
[47:15] and and
[47:16] sisters have you ever stopped and not
[47:18] think and got into a nothing box oh
[47:22] boy they can't that's a good place they
[47:25] can't but it's a beautiful place all me
[47:27] knows this it's usually followed with a
[47:29] facial expression like
[47:32] this and your wife comes and goes what
[47:34] are you thinking about nothing
[47:37] what how can you don't cuz then I have
[47:41] to think just
[47:45] nothing so so they call it the man caves
[47:48] and the little places and and the world
[47:50] calls it all these type of things I'm
[47:52] calling when is it your alone time where
[47:55] you where TV is not there social media
[47:58] is not there sounds noise everything
[48:01] just nothing but you and God because
[48:05] remember God is all over us he's around
[48:08] us he's within you so no matter where
[48:10] you sit alone he's
[48:13] there he's always there it's just we get
[48:16] so busy we steep out of the atmosphere
[48:18] of God God is all over us all around us
[48:22] but we step out of that place and we we
[48:25] being LED out of that place and that's
[48:27] where he cuts every Christian's life is
[48:30] that at the prayer line at that prayer
[48:32] that family prayer that time with God
[48:35] because you know what I'm I'm tired I
[48:37] had a rough day and I I worked very hard
[48:40] I just want to sleep so I just quickly
[48:41] kneel there by my bed and I go say Lord
[48:45] thank you for this day you're so great
[48:46] and for all those things to pray for
[48:48] Brother Andy and for this one and that
[48:49] one this one click click click click and

[49:02] battles you know how's the battles are
[49:04] we standing or are we taking shots are
[49:07] we are we thrown to and fro or or
[49:09] actually do we have stepping out the
[49:11] next morning knowing that you all prayed
[49:13] up knowing that Lord whatever happens in
[49:15] this day you've got
[49:16] it cuz it's
[49:20] prayer oh dear it says now see what pray
[49:25] does prayer is not exactly bringing go
[49:28] God to man it's bringing man up to
[49:31] God see sometimes when we pray we want
[49:34] God to do our will say Lord your will be
[49:37] done your kingdom come you know but it's
[49:39] still hey can you please look after that
[49:40] one and can you do this and this and
[49:42] this and hey today I've got a meeting
[49:43] you need to be with me and then is that
[49:45] how we pray has it has it gone watery or
[49:50] do we actually sit in the morning and we
[49:51] go Lord on our knees saying what is your
[49:53] will for me where you going to say send
[49:55] me today how can I better serve you my
[49:59] king what is in here that is between me
[50:01] and you get it out of the way what is in
[50:04] here that's between me and you get it
[50:06] out of the way CU Lord today when I step
[50:08] out of here I want to know that I'm 100%
[50:11] in thy will not are you in my will you
[50:15] know sometimes you have a decision to
[50:16] make I'm going to keep to it but you've
[50:17] got a very big decision to make and it's
[50:20] a real decision and you need an answer
[50:22] but you need an answer
[50:24] now but but God goes nah you're going to
[50:29] wait because you want your answer and a
[50:32] lot of times we rush God and we get a
[50:35] answer but that's not his answer because
[50:39] we want to fit God into our busy
[50:41] lifestyle God has no time God has all
[50:45] eternity but the thing is his timing is
[50:48] so perfect and one brother T put on that
[50:51] that on his shared his status this
[50:53] morning about prayer I thought no matter
[50:56] how many times I prepared no matter how
[50:58] many lessons we would have had God just
[51:00] goes and says hey there you go please
[51:03] deliver the
[51:04] mail his timing is perfect but see we
[51:07] want to make it our timing that's not
[51:10] what we should do we should pray and say
[51:12] Lord bring me into your presence take me
[51:15] out of this place which is so busy and
[51:17] bring me into your presence that should
[51:19] be your first thing exalt him praise him
[51:21] you know Our Father who art in heaven
[51:23] Hallowed be thy name give him praise
[51:26] but then get quiet and say Lord now
[51:28] bring me into your presence and stay
[51:30] there and
[51:32] stay wonderful things will happen to you
[51:35] amen that's right if you had ever a
[51:37] question or ever a doubt those things
[51:39] will go away because you have to stay in
[51:41] that prayer amen first thing the devil
[51:45] did and I just put it there and so don't
[51:47] have to read it all but brother brandom
[51:49] is speaking here in the Samaran church
[51:51] as and he's and he's busy saying that
[51:53] the first thing the devil did is he took
[51:55] the Bible and the praying out of
[51:58] schools so he's teaching you young
[52:00] people when you go to class when last he
[52:03] you young
[52:04] people quick one do you pray when you
[52:08] get to
[52:10] school huh so when you walk into a new
[52:13] class especially maths cuz everybody
[52:15] needs prayer for maths like seriously
[52:17] maths is rough okay you need prayer okay
[52:20] you walk in there I don't see a teacher
[52:22] go first thing in the morning and say
[52:23] they go they call the Roll Roll those
[52:25] Called Up Yonder I'll be there and they
[52:26] go Reuben yes jono yes AB yes mo mo mo
[52:30] yep yep Mo yep
[52:33] Mo yep yep Mo yeah okay and they kick
[52:37] the Box off and then they go okay yes
[52:38] let's open your books and let's go you
[52:40] had homework there's no okay guys while
[52:42] we're here let's just bow our heads oh
[52:44] boy and we start this day right do you
[52:48] think any child in that class will talk
[52:50] back to a teacher if they open up in a
[52:52] word of
[52:53] prayer the atmosphere straight away in
[52:56] that class will
[52:57] change the teacher will be in their
[52:59] position and the kids will be in their
[53:01] position because God is now in his
[53:03] position so now all of a sudden the
[53:06] ranking in that little situation is
[53:08] perfect because God stepped in that
[53:11] place and now every child goes hey I'm
[53:13] actually here for a greater
[53:15] reason not just to get taught at and
[53:17] Shout at and taught and
[53:20] disrupt so he took it out of the schools
[53:23] it's gone don't worry I'm not going to
[53:25] be long today we're just talking about
[53:29] prayer I will definitely not be able to
[53:31] read that but don't worry I got to back
[53:36] up now brother
[53:39] Brenham who believes that brother
[53:42] brandham is the prophet of God Amen okay
[53:46] I just want to establish
[53:49] something he goes and he he visits it
[53:52] visits this
[53:54] um
[53:56] and I think is this he says yeah and
[53:57] remember my brother and sisters you reap
[54:00] what you seow so he says that's a law of
[54:03] God it's just it's like gravity
[54:05] beautiful you jump out of a tree you
[54:08] fall on your
[54:09] face I don't know whoever jumped out of
[54:12] a tree and landed just nowhere and just
[54:14] floated doesn't happen the law of
[54:17] gravity we will defy once we change our
[54:19] bodies but while we're in this body
[54:21] gravity loves your body and it will suck
[54:23] you down okay who ever on the
[54:26] skateboard wheels go you go you don't
[54:29] keep going on you you you face plant man
[54:32] you WIP out and there's no nice way of
[54:34] falling you fall okay so what what he's
[54:37] trying to tell you is there's laws of
[54:39] God and he says you reap what you s so
[54:42] what you what you give is what you get
[54:45] it's the third law of Newton who knows
[54:47] that one you take a tennis ball you
[54:48] throw it hard against the wall what's
[54:49] going to come back Abes you love
[54:52] throwing balls come on what's coming
[54:53] back and usually it's for your face hey
[54:56] yeah then it becomes dodgeball but but
[54:59] because you pick it up and you throw it
[55:00] with a force that same equal force hits
[55:03] that wall and comes straight back at
[55:06] you it's a
[55:08] law you sew you
[55:12] reap I love you I love you too darling
[55:16] you annoy me
[55:18] sorry you reap what you seow true well
[55:22] it's so in your prayer life you want God
[55:25] to step on the scene and come and
[55:27] interceder for you and help you in times
[55:29] but all you're sewing is a quick hey
[55:31] Lord how you doing thank you God bless
[55:32] you by you don't have a deep connection
[55:36] with God you don't spend time and pray
[55:38] and ask and pray and ask you just hey
[55:42] you know I'm just covering my basis cuz
[55:43] I'm a Christian and that's what we do we
[55:45] pray and oh brother Marion has got a
[55:46] prayer request here quickly going to
[55:48] pray for him Lord just pray for Marion
[55:49] and you know we okay yes okay yeah oh
[55:52] another one sister Louis says this for
[55:55] moving and all those things yep okay
[55:56] Lord help them to move I don't want to
[55:58] be that
[56:01] way but that's what we do because we as
[56:03] Christians know prayer is important but
[56:05] we forget the real importance of prayer
[56:07] prayer is interceding prayer is getting
[56:09] into that burden prayer means Marion is
[56:12] my brother here's my whole body the py
[56:15] has got a cut and it's
[56:17] bleeding it's real bad bleeding he's
[56:20] asking for prayer he's hurt the rest of
[56:23] the body when you cut your little pinky
[56:25] it knows about it yeah have you ever hit
[56:28] your shin on the back of a of a car's
[56:31] toeb bar the whole body knows about it
[56:35] your brain your ear loses yeah and this
[56:38] things everything you hit that thing and
[56:40] your whole body goes oh I just got that
[56:42] hurt and it's so sore and it fobs there
[56:46] so the Pain's there the rest of the body
[56:48] goes do not walk into that thing again
[56:50] so next time you walk around the you
[56:51] you're
[56:53] like because now the the body is so in
[56:55] tune to say you don't want that to
[56:57] happen again you want to find furniture
[56:59] in your house switch the lights off your
[57:00] shin will find it that's what it is but
[57:04] when the body hurts the whole body
[57:06] protects it so next time subconsciously
[57:08] you walk around the car and you see the
[57:10] toeo your eyes see it your mind
[57:12] automatically goes nope the rest of the
[57:14] body goes yep yep side step that one
[57:16] isn't that how the prayer in the church
[57:19] should be when one of the members says
[57:22] I'm going through a trial you actually
[57:24] say Lord I want to be that one to say
[57:27] don't don't intercede here brother
[57:30] Isaac's grandma that text come through
[57:33] I'm like Lord this man's got some stuff
[57:36] going on I just want to pray for my
[57:38] brother I don't care where I am I stop
[57:40] right there I don't care who's looking I
[57:44] don't I don't care about those things
[57:46] cuz that doesn't matter the one thing
[57:47] matters now is I read that text I got
[57:50] the time I'm going to pray for my
[57:51] brother whoever looks maybe they can
[57:54] come and pray with me me but brother
[57:56] Isaac is asking for prayer and even if
[57:58] he just say something it is such a part
[58:01] of our body that I want to pray for him
[58:03] I want to pray for his
[58:05] house that's prayer and we go on there
[58:08] and he says you reap what you seow so
[58:11] dear people here in sort so he's talking
[58:14] to a church very small so sorry about it
[58:16] well you can see there he
[58:19] says the best thing to do around you
[58:21] here at Life Tabernacle everywhere else
[58:23] is to keep that oldfashioned prayer
[58:25] meeting going and keep the unity of the
[58:28] spirit I underlined both of them because
[58:32] it's no point I pray for you brother
[58:33] Paul but inside I think oh man he's a
[58:37] muppet but think about it because then
[58:40] my prayer is not really I'm not really
[58:41] feeling you all I'm doing is I'm ticking
[58:43] the
[58:44] box but if I see brother Paul and I
[58:47] don't maybe understand brother Paul and
[58:48] I go yes brother Paul I'm still going to
[58:50] pray for you because you know what
[58:51] you're a redeemed Son of God and you
[58:53] have my prayers and and I will cover you
[58:55] and if there's a guy behind you with a
[58:56] sword that wants to stab you in the back
[58:58] guess what I'll be that guy that takes
[58:59] that spot and say n no not today I'll be
[59:02] that guy that is being in the in the
[59:05] unity of the spirit all in one Accord in
[59:08] one Accord that's when we pray amen he
[59:10] says keep all this worldliness out he
[59:13] says because um no matter how bad it
[59:18] hurts so sometimes children it hurts not
[59:22] to watch
[59:23] YouTube and your favorite
[59:26] Channel but it ain't helping
[59:30] you right I'm looking at you Young
[59:33] Guns I'm looking at your sisters the
[59:36] little
[59:38] ones it ain't helping you it's keeping
[59:40] you busy I'm not saying it's wrong don't
[59:43] get me wrong I'm not just hear me out it
[59:47] fills this
[59:49] space and it diminishes this
[59:52] space and that's all it's good
[59:56] for that's right so he says even if it
[1:00:00] hurts if you take that iPad and you just
[1:00:02] want to look at mom goes now and you go
[1:00:04] it hurts I just have to put it
[1:00:08] down just do it because you will benefit
[1:00:12] from it because you are now cutting that
[1:00:16] anointing on you off and you starting
[1:00:18] entering to a different realm and now
[1:00:20] you got time because the first thing my
[1:00:22] kids don't play games or look at
[1:00:24] anything on the TV they go I'm
[1:00:26] bored well all of a sudden now you have
[1:00:29] time but the the first place before it
[1:00:31] you didn't have time and now you got
[1:00:32] loads of time so then I want you to be
[1:00:35] bored because if you're bored then you
[1:00:37] might sit down and start talking to him
[1:00:41] amen that's good you will see your life
[1:00:44] change you will see the change instantly
[1:00:48] you won't get your anwers answers
[1:00:51] instantly cuz God isn't a a instant in

[1:00:55] answers God he's not that he makes you
[1:00:57] wait for it he makes you work for it he

[1:02:33] to Matthew 21 I've got it up here but
[1:02:35] open your Bibles so it sounds like you
[1:02:36] all got Bibles here
[1:02:38] come good just to see who's rattling the
[1:02:41] pages who knows where the Book of
[1:02:42] Matthew
[1:02:43] is hey
[1:02:46] Jonah let's go to Matthew
[1:02:49] 21 ran I've got your Bible today you can
[1:02:52] have it back now here you go
[1:02:57] I forgot my Bible at home
[1:03:00] so I took I took the wrong book I took
[1:03:03] sister bronn's book that she bought me
[1:03:05] the nice the the right yeah so I took

[1:03:16] enemies on your behalf as
[1:03:19] well
[1:03:21] amen so just get on behind the thought
[1:03:23] he says
[1:03:25] now we forget the power of prayer and
[1:03:28] and here's the story
[1:03:29] Jesus we we'll go just here from this
[1:03:32] side he says Jesus answered them saying
[1:03:34] very very I say unto you if you have
[1:03:35] faith and no doubt you shall do only um
[1:03:39] um not only do this which done to the
[1:03:41] Fig Tree but also if you shall say to
[1:03:44] this mountain be you removed and be cast
[1:03:46] into the sea it shall be done now a lot
[1:03:50] of Christians get criticized for this
[1:03:51] scripture but remember the Lord of Glory
[1:03:54] just came past and he went to a fig tree
[1:03:57] and there was no fruit on it yeah come
[1:03:59] on no fruit nice beautiful tree green
[1:04:03] leaves look the pot dress the pot act
[1:04:06] the PO he goes just give me a
[1:04:08] fruit it's all I want to see is give me
[1:04:10] some
[1:04:12] Joy huh on now give me some Joy oh no
[1:04:15] I'm a
[1:04:17] CH give me give me some love oh man I
[1:04:21] just cannot I can that guy is fine and
[1:04:23] that guy this Brother come on now give
[1:04:26] me the fruits of the spirit the
[1:04:28] meekness oh stepped on my toe
[1:04:33] Temperance see there's no fruits because
[1:04:35] we looked theart the tree looked like a
[1:04:37] fig tree and it was so that when the
[1:04:39] Lord walked to the feig tree he was
[1:04:41] expecting fruit on that
[1:04:44] tree and he has no fruit and he says
[1:04:47] well this fruit shall never bear fruit
[1:04:49] again walks away and the fruit just goes
[1:04:52] in front of everyone the tree just dies
[1:04:54] and the disciples walk and they go hey
[1:04:57] and I'm going to paraphrase cuz kids I
[1:04:58] want you to
[1:04:59] listen just look at that cool guy yes
[1:05:02] he's always at church always but but man
[1:05:04] he's just balling out that other
[1:05:07] guy huh when he turns around and goes oh
[1:05:11] yeah I just hate being at church but
[1:05:12] you're always at church you're always so
[1:05:13] nicely dressed that's
[1:05:15] boring well where's the fruits
[1:05:18] bro and then the boys get together cuz
[1:05:21] remember you think it's just a tree God
[1:05:22] is trying to teach you something is such
[1:05:24] a compound meaning in the word if you
[1:05:26] just spend time in
[1:05:28] it so I just don't want to be there they
[1:05:31] always have to make me be there but I
[1:05:33] dressed apart and when when they they
[1:05:35] ask me to tell me something they give me
[1:05:37] always the message
[1:05:39] answer man I've asked people how are you
[1:05:41] doing
[1:05:42] oh praise the Lord I'm doing so fine God
[1:05:45] is just so good to me okay let's cut
[1:05:48] through that how you doing actually I'm
[1:05:50] having a rough week at school isn't that
[1:05:53] better
[1:05:54] because what the message done and since
[1:05:56] I've been in the message is people think
[1:05:59] that if they give me a quote of brother
[1:06:00] brandom or they talk to me about some
[1:06:02] fancy Revelation they just got that I'm
[1:06:05] going to think they're
[1:06:07] saved it it's not me that's saving you
[1:06:11] it's not brother bit saving you your
[1:06:13] salvation has nothing to do with us we
[1:06:15] just come and say hey have you
[1:06:17] considered it's between you and God you
[1:06:20] cannot fool God you can be as pied as
[1:06:23] you want you can cannot fool God that's
[1:06:25] right every man can think you're a total
[1:06:27] believer you cannot fool God because
[1:06:29] when you get in your place alone with
[1:06:31] God you're either going to make him sick
[1:06:33] cuz you lukewarm and he'll spew you out
[1:06:36] of his mouth or he's going to come down
[1:06:38] and he's going to visit you and you're
[1:06:39] going to be in his presence and you're
[1:06:40] going to fill yourself up with the Holy
[1:06:42] Ghost hallelujah it's only those
[1:06:45] two see the thing is people we we are
[1:06:48] people Pleasers since we've been little
[1:06:50] kids we want to please Mom and Dad we
[1:06:52] want to come and Mommy I done that this
[1:06:54] and daddy I've done this and aren't you
[1:06:55] proud of me we want to please that's our
[1:06:57] nature but see with God it's not like
[1:07:00] that God wants a relationship he doesn't
[1:07:02] want you to please him he is pleased
[1:07:04] because you're there because he more
[1:07:07] than ever wants to spend time with you
[1:07:10] it's us cutting the time from
[1:07:12] him and so what God does is he does send
[1:07:15] us trials he gives us a little bit of
[1:07:17] things just to get our knees a bit
[1:07:19] polished up again and get back on our
[1:07:20] knees and go oh dear lord yeah okay
[1:07:23] really I I I messed up you know what's
[1:07:26] the weakest place to be is on your knees
[1:07:30] you know I spoke to to and this is such
[1:07:32] a cool thing it came in Fellowship we
[1:07:33] were always jumping out of the car me
[1:07:34] and Ed here's a samurai pulls this
[1:07:37] massive katana sword W I'm a samurai
[1:07:41] they go into battle and
[1:07:43] they and the one goes and he's bleeding
[1:07:47] and he's lost the battle and that
[1:07:49] Samurai goes in front of the other
[1:07:52] Samurai puts down his sword and he
[1:07:55] kneels and he goes you won and in the
[1:07:57] old days they would just s him up
[1:08:00] because that was thing but that was his
[1:08:03] weaked spot from because from here I
[1:08:05] can't do nothing I can't just jump up
[1:08:07] all of a sudden like in the movies and
[1:08:08] go I'm weak I'm surrendered now think if
[1:08:12] you approach God that way he says
[1:08:15] brother brandom say and I want to I want
[1:08:16] to give you a little bit of neology here
[1:08:19] and I had this here that's
[1:08:22] good just let me get it cuz now when it
[1:08:25] got yes man that is so cool we just
[1:08:28] don't we don't think about these things
[1:08:36] e just pray for
[1:08:42] me where is
[1:08:44] it I had this little book of prayer man
[1:08:46] it changed my
[1:08:48] life he says here the Christian doesn't
[1:08:51] realize what force he has when he his
[1:08:54] knees uh when he's on his knees before
[1:08:58] the almighty God In The Name of Jesus
[1:09:01] Christ he doesn't realize what power
[1:09:04] that
[1:09:05] is amen because that's where you say to
[1:09:09] God I'm fully surrendered I have
[1:09:12] nothing that's where you approach him to
[1:09:14] say you're everything zakus come out
[1:09:16] from that
[1:09:17] tree just come stand next to me that's
[1:09:20] where you know that he's Sovereign and
[1:09:22] you're not
[1:09:24] that's when when every mind battle stops
[1:09:28] battling it's when you just before him
[1:09:30] go I don't know what to do now
[1:09:33] Lord you know we should pray lift up
[1:09:35] holy hands standing and praying and all
[1:09:37] those things you know it's fine but when
[1:09:39] you really desperate get on your
[1:09:42] knees get on your knees it wasn't in my
[1:09:45] notes he says and all these things
[1:09:48] whatsoever you are so remember he just
[1:09:50] spoke about a mountain being moved into
[1:09:52] the sea guys you got that scripture you
[1:09:55] think you can speak to a mountain will
[1:09:56] just drop in the
[1:09:58] sea he says all things whatever you ask
[1:10:02] in
[1:10:04] prayer believing what did he
[1:10:07] say so there is something to it hey it's
[1:10:11] not just God you go save that that
[1:10:13] brother and then yeah well we just stop
[1:10:15] it there believe speak it Proclaim it
[1:10:18] confess it find him Lord believe there
[1:10:21] is a part for the believer to
[1:10:24] playing cuzz that's why they call us
[1:10:26] Believers God you have a promise in your
[1:10:29] Bible I will get healed
[1:10:31] believe you go I've been in this battle
[1:10:34] too long believe he didn't say believe
[1:10:37] and instantly I will come down and
[1:10:38] change all the scene he said
[1:10:40] believe he says I will visit you
[1:10:43] believe here we are but sometimes and
[1:10:47] this is where it cuts a bit Jesus went
[1:10:50] into the temple just before that before
[1:10:52] this and when he got to the temple and
[1:10:54] they were selling doves and birdies and
[1:10:57] everything for sacrifice and they were
[1:10:59] so concentrated on the sacrifice that
[1:11:02] when the sacrificial lamb came they
[1:11:05] couldn't see him because they were more
[1:11:06] worried about the birds and the goats
[1:11:08] and all the things that had to be
[1:11:10] sacrificed when the Lamb of God comes in
[1:11:13] there they don't have the focus on him
[1:11:15] but they have the focus on the trading
[1:11:17] and he gets
[1:11:19] angry and he walks up and he throws
[1:11:21] these tables and he throws everything
[1:11:23] out and he says you made this a den of
[1:11:25] Thieves don't you know that this house
[1:11:28] my house is a House of
[1:11:32] Prayer so sometimes it's the same for us
[1:11:34] if you could think about it applicable
[1:11:36] and it and it goes there you're God's
[1:11:41] Temple you are the temple of
[1:11:43] God he says Heaven is my what heaven is
[1:11:47] my Throne Earth is my foot stol or
[1:11:49] where's the place of my
[1:11:52] rest where can I put my Holy Spirit
[1:11:55] within where can I dwell in commune with
[1:11:59] man you're the temple
[1:12:02] y so it's good to come into these four
[1:12:05] walls it's fantastic what do you do when
[1:12:07] we go out of these four walls where's
[1:12:10] God's Temple
[1:12:15] going someday I want him to say Well
[1:12:18] done my good and faithful
[1:12:20] servant and he will confess his sins
[1:12:24] but if I regard iniquity out go to Psalm
[1:12:31] 66 let's go
[1:12:33] there I'm going to go there and go there
[1:12:36] to um I think it was verse
[1:12:42] 17 I just going to do there he says but
[1:12:46] if I regard iniquity in my heart then
[1:12:49] God will not hear my prayer said David
[1:12:52] what is Iniquity and I'll have to read
[1:12:54] it there iniquity is something that you
[1:12:57] know that you're doing that you ought
[1:13:00] not to do wow but you still won't
[1:13:05] repent so boys and girls you know you're
[1:13:08] being naughty brothers and sisters you
[1:13:10] know you're not in the will of God you
[1:13:13] know you're being carnal you know you're
[1:13:15] being arrogant you know you have a a
[1:13:18] spirit that's pushing back God's spirit
[1:13:20] you know it God's been dealing with that
[1:13:22] so long
[1:13:24] already but you just don't want to get
[1:13:26] rid of that thing that's iniquity God
[1:13:28] will not hear your
[1:13:31] prayer it's it's true this is the
[1:13:34] prophet of God saying he cannot David
[1:13:36] said in verse 17 read it he says I cry
[1:13:40] unto him with my mouth and he was
[1:13:42] extoled so he cries so much unto the
[1:13:44] Lord that he's lifting him
[1:13:46] up he's saying Lord you know notice me
[1:13:51] okay and he says and with my tongue I
[1:13:54] lifted him up with my tongue I praised
[1:13:56] him I worshiped him I cried I did
[1:13:57] everything he says but I regarded
[1:13:59] iniquity in my heart and the Lord will
[1:14:01] not hear
[1:14:02] me so that
[1:14:04] regarded if you look at
[1:14:07] it it means to see to perceive to have a
[1:14:11] vision of iniquity to look at to regard
[1:14:15] it says to appear the presence on
[1:14:18] oneself to be seen or to be
[1:14:22] visible
[1:14:23] so iniquity is a very bad thing it cuts
[1:14:27] God's power of prayer away from your
[1:14:30] life and sometimes we feel look I'm that
[1:14:33] guy okay so if you like me or not I'm
[1:14:35] just going to say it anyways I'm that
[1:14:36] guy that I don't sugarcoat nothing
[1:14:38] because I have just come through the
[1:14:40] same trial brother Isaac where I had to
[1:14:43] stop and go
[1:14:44] Lord what's going on
[1:14:47] here and he goes you're looking at
[1:14:50] me let's start within here and you get
[1:14:54] back on your knees and you start getting
[1:14:55] in here again you say Lord meet me here
[1:14:58] because this is not making sense this is
[1:15:01] not making sense meet me in here and
[1:15:04] change me from here so that I can see
[1:15:06] your way yeah amen and it's because I
[1:15:09] had
[1:15:10] iniquity everybody has it everybody here
[1:15:14] has sin it's covered by the blood but no
[1:15:17] one here if you take a stone and the
[1:15:19] woman is felt before Jesus and CAU her
[1:15:21] in adultery he said to them he without
[1:15:24] sin cast the first stone so don't be P
[1:15:26] don't be big don't be somebody we all
[1:15:28] make mistakes is are you willing to
[1:15:32] repent of
[1:15:33] it are you willing to let that go so
[1:15:36] that you can go further in your walk
[1:15:38] with God are you willing because
[1:15:40] remember he wants to meet you in that
[1:15:42] prayer
[1:15:43] closet he wants to meet you he wants to
[1:15:46] come and and his presence dropped down
[1:15:48] in the room and and you just say Lord
[1:15:50] you're here and whatever you say I'll do
[1:15:52] and if you don't don't say anything I
[1:15:53] just want to stay here it's awesome
[1:15:57] times but it feels like you're hitting a
[1:16:00] brick wall every time you pray like
[1:16:06] this he says now think
[1:16:09] Church a church being built on that let
[1:16:13] the world creep in why certainly it Rose
[1:16:17] the indignation of a real true servant
[1:16:19] of God sure it's wrong let's get the
[1:16:23] thing out of there get away from this
[1:16:25] old lukewarm halfway little prayer
[1:16:29] in the morning and prayer at night come
[1:16:32] on get rid of it and go to bed and get
[1:16:37] up the next morning no wonder they are
[1:16:38] getting so worldly no wonder the world
[1:16:41] is creeping into church because we don't
[1:16:44] stay in prayer yeah so that doesn't mean
[1:16:49] stay on your knees the whole day guys we
[1:16:50] need to
[1:16:51] work but everywhere you go you talk to
[1:16:55] God you ask him counsel you know guys
[1:16:59] that install flaw they are
[1:17:01] like like there is magicians and
[1:17:04] astrologist in the Bible but they like
[1:17:05] the magician part of it you get there
[1:17:07] and they get to the end and they have to
[1:17:09] now all of a sudden make everything fit
[1:17:11] there at the end do you not think they
[1:17:13] pray before they do that or they walk
[1:17:16] onto a floor because it is you walk on
[1:17:18] the floor and they doing all these steps
[1:17:20] and the first thing they go oh Lord help
[1:17:21] me and they really mean
[1:17:24] because it's horrible to do them okay
[1:17:26] but it's it's it's Boulders you know
[1:17:28] everything goes according to plan hey
[1:17:31] Ben you know this this engineer gives
[1:17:33] you a blueprint and go there you go
[1:17:35] sister Margie off you go and you're like
[1:17:37] yeah okay I'll just 100 Year 200 years
[1:17:39] it's going to fit you gock and he just
[1:17:41] like you're
[1:17:43] like
[1:17:45] but oh dear now you start talking to God
[1:17:49] because see prayer is being in communion
[1:17:51] with God the whole day
[1:17:53] he says there that he prays seven times
[1:17:56] a day you ought to
[1:17:58] pray I'll get
[1:18:01] there he says we don't stay in prayer
[1:18:04] there is no no more um agonizing there
[1:18:07] is more no more staying before God there
[1:18:09] is no more digging out cleaning
[1:18:12] up we need to we need an oldfashioned
[1:18:15] Revival
[1:18:17] amen so prayer is not to get God to do
[1:18:20] what you want to do prayer is to empty
[1:18:22] yourself out before God and say search
[1:18:24] me every day yes you know like are we
[1:18:28] that prophetic yes we
[1:18:29] are because the thing is you know it's
[1:18:32] not your ability you know it's not your
[1:18:34] wisdom it's all gifts from God it's who
[1:18:37] you're going to exalt when you use them
[1:18:39] which kingdom do you represent when you
[1:18:41] do anything amen which kingdom prayer
[1:18:45] helps you to realize which kingdom you
[1:18:48] you fight
[1:18:49] for so
[1:18:51] everything has to to work together all
[1:18:54] the church has to pray remember the shin
[1:18:59] okay uh all the church has to pray and
[1:19:02] all the Ley has to pray and all the
[1:19:04] deacons and trustees and pastors and all
[1:19:07] together will come into the presence of
[1:19:09] God like that one great unit so guess
[1:19:13] what I need you just as much to pray for
[1:19:16] me as you need me to pray for you amen
[1:19:20] you know I when I was still in the world
[1:19:22] uh I only never forget it my brother and
[1:19:25] his girlfriend they were they were at
[1:19:27] our house and we had a all fallout cuz
[1:19:30] remember I I come out of the world so I
[1:19:32] can tell you these things M if we had a
[1:19:35] Fallout we had a great Fallout all the
[1:19:37] neighbors the neighbors neighbors
[1:19:38] everybody down the street knew the STS
[1:19:40] were we were we were raising our voices
[1:19:43] the Mom and Dad sorry it's part of the
[1:19:46] testimony but I wouldn't talk to my
[1:19:48] brother normal I would shout at
[1:19:51] him I would get my point the
[1:19:54] cross and this day we were fighting and
[1:19:56] we were having a real bad fight and it
[1:19:59] went into from the brothers to the mom
[1:20:01] and dad and the mom and dad they fought
[1:20:03] very heavily word said things done and
[1:20:06] she seen this and she stopped and she
[1:20:07] said you're a bunch of crazy
[1:20:10] people but I'll pray for you and I
[1:20:13] thought it was the biggest insult she
[1:20:15] ever gave
[1:20:16] me but now I think it was the biggest
[1:20:19] compliment she could ever give me see
[1:20:22] the thing is when I was was in the world
[1:20:24] my mom and dad prayed for
[1:20:26] me believing that one day I will come to
[1:20:29] the Lord I didn't care about the Lord I
[1:20:32] didn't want to serve him I didn't
[1:20:34] understand him Samson was a story
[1:20:36] everything in the Bible was just too
[1:20:38] many reading I just want to fall asleep
[1:20:40] it's boring that's how my was and a lot
[1:20:43] of you young people thinking that you're
[1:20:45] sitting here I know what you're thinking
[1:20:47] cuz I've been your age I've just
[1:20:49] recently turned
[1:20:51] 13
[1:20:53] see the lovely thing that the lord gave
[1:20:55] me is I think like a
[1:20:57] child so when I'm with jonno I'm the
[1:20:59] same size as jono same speed not exactly
[1:21:03] the same strength but I got him okay
[1:21:06] when it's jonno ab and Reuben and mo
[1:21:08] then I'm in trouble okay so then I must
[1:21:09] just run faster than all of them but
[1:21:11] when I'm with children I think like
[1:21:13] children so when I come to church
[1:21:15] sometimes I see the boys and the girls
[1:21:17] and they're all squiggling and talking
[1:21:19] to each other leave them alone you you
[1:21:21] just commune with God because guess what
[1:21:23] you were also there and church was also
[1:21:27] boring because you didn't get the
[1:21:29] Revelation yet and you didn't understand
[1:21:31] all these things yet so sometimes it is
[1:21:33] boring but just keep entering in don't
[1:21:36] give up then amen something will come
[1:21:39] your way if you expect it to come your
[1:21:40] way hey Rebecca it's your birthday do
[1:21:43] you expect present on your birthday
[1:21:47] really so if it's about 10:00 at night
[1:21:49] nobody give you a present what do you
[1:21:51] start doing
[1:21:53] crying crying cuz I'm looking for a
[1:21:55] present and then she walks past the
[1:21:57] cupboard and under the door here and
[1:21:58] walk and everything cuz there's an
[1:22:00] expectation but if you come to church
[1:22:03] that way knowing that if you show up to
[1:22:04] church it's your birthday there's
[1:22:07] expectation for you something will come
[1:22:09] your way it could be one line that
[1:22:11] changes the
[1:22:13] whole walk one line yeah say remember to
[1:22:17] pray Apes but don't just
[1:22:21] go
[1:22:23] pray don't say a prayer brother brand
[1:22:25] said pray a prayer amen okay so here
[1:22:28] comes our story we're not when I'm
[1:22:29] watching the time so I'll just talk
[1:22:31] about Daniel we all still okay good so
[1:22:35] Daniel King Nebuchadnezzar he's got
[1:22:37] Babylon he comes and he's takes all the
[1:22:40] the fine young men to Babylon and the
[1:22:42] princes and we must know the story of
[1:22:43] Daniel so I'm not going to go into it
[1:22:46] but do King Nebuchadnezzar has a
[1:22:49] dream this dream bothers him very much
[1:22:53] okay and then he goes to his musicians
[1:22:56] and astr astrologist and the calans and
[1:22:59] all those guys
[1:23:02] gifts gifts they can prophesy you know
[1:23:06] there was there was uh Jeffers and Jus
[1:23:09] you know every time Moses did something
[1:23:10] they I don't know what you call them but
[1:23:12] they threw the snake down they could do
[1:23:14] everything that oh man I always get the
[1:23:15] names what's the
[1:23:17] names that's it okay so those two so
[1:23:21] everything Moses did they could copy but
[1:23:24] there was one thing missing with them
[1:23:26] God was not with them so everything they
[1:23:29] could copy they couldn't take away amen
[1:23:32] so yeah this this Nebuchadnezzar now he
[1:23:34] calls all these calans and the and the
[1:23:37] magicians astrologist Sorcerers and they
[1:23:39] all come before him and he goes you know
[1:23:41] what I know you guys you guys always
[1:23:44] interpret once I give you the dream you
[1:23:46] come and give me this wisdom I want the
[1:23:48] dream
[1:23:49] first so if you're so good and you have
[1:23:53] a special gift you'll give me the Dream
[1:23:55] I Dreamed and these guys go whoa King
[1:23:58] come on this is a hard saying man you
[1:24:00] know no we no other king is asking this
[1:24:02] he goes yeah but I am asking this and if
[1:24:04] you can't give it off with your
[1:24:07] head yeah man this king is angry but see
[1:24:10] the thing is this King knew this dream
[1:24:12] was bothering so much he needed that
[1:24:15] interpretation but he didn't want them
[1:24:17] to fake him because he wanted to know
[1:24:19] why is this dream bothering him so he
[1:24:21] got sincere
[1:24:23] he got serious with God but see he was
[1:24:26] looking to all his Pentecostal Brothers
[1:24:28] I I say that he was looking to all those
[1:24:30] other people outside which looks like
[1:24:33] Christians which are very devoted
[1:24:36] Christians but when it comes to the
[1:24:38] truth they don't have it yeah that's
[1:24:41] right and they cannot give it to you
[1:24:43] because God gives Revelation you send a
[1:24:45] prophet your way they cannot give you
[1:24:47] that truth they don't have it that's
[1:24:49] right it's withheld from them they live
[1:24:51] in a portion of Truth but they don't
[1:24:53] have the whole book open but you have it
[1:24:55] open amen that's why we had a prophet he
[1:24:59] came and opened the book and he said
[1:25:00] what God wants you walk on with God
[1:25:02] don't walk on with brother Brandon
[1:25:04] brother Brandon brought you into a a a a
[1:25:07] uniting with God and it's very important
[1:25:09] to feed off these things but he's
[1:25:12] actually telling you once you met the
[1:25:13] Lord Jesus Christ walk on with him cuz
[1:25:16] he went off the scene now it's you and
[1:25:19] God now you have the truth if you go and
[1:25:21] follow him in prayer So Daniel he's the
[1:25:24] only one that's got the
[1:25:26] truth if you could say he's the only
[1:25:28] message believer that knows where he's
[1:25:30] standing in
[1:25:32] Babylon do you know where you're
[1:25:34] standing in Babylon right now yes do you
[1:25:37] know that this age is engineered to be
[1:25:40] the final age there's a Rapture
[1:25:42] happening you're part of it do you
[1:25:45] actually know it because a lot of other
[1:25:47] people
[1:25:47] don't and they sincerely love God but
[1:25:51] they don't know where where they
[1:25:52] standing at this very present time and
[1:25:55] guess what they don't know where God is
[1:25:56] at this very present time they know the
[1:25:58] presence of God they know the gifts of
[1:26:00] God but they don't know God that's right
[1:26:03] and God ain't speaking to
[1:26:05] them he's not giving them Revelation
[1:26:07] he's not opening up all this Mysteries
[1:26:09] it's baptism fighting here and this
[1:26:11] fighting there and this dress coat and
[1:26:13] that this and they're all just fighting
[1:26:16] but there's no one that goes hey here is
[1:26:18] the truth you read it
[1:26:20] yourself that's what why we got the
[1:26:22] message guys it's to get you back on
[1:26:25] Solid Ground so you know where you're at
[1:26:27] so you can know where you're going if
[1:26:30] you don't know where you're going Marion

[1:29:51] can push through this thing so God can
[1:29:53] give us the answer he didn't go oh I
[1:29:55] great Daniel is just going to go hey God
[1:29:57] you know just give me the answer and
[1:29:58] I'll sleep tonight I'll have it tomorrow

[1:30:21] me
[1:30:23] what would happen if we all had that
[1:30:25] urgency towards each other am what will
[1:30:29] happen in this place CU we have to
[1:30:32] realize that sometimes you cannot pray
[1:30:34] through on your own you need your
[1:30:36] brothers and sisters to help you push
[1:30:38] through that thing yes amen but you have
[1:30:42] to become humble and get on your knees
[1:30:45] and be fully surrendered to admit defeat
[1:30:48] when you are being defeated y
[1:30:50] amen
[1:30:52] so he does they have oldfashioned prayer
[1:30:55] meeting next day Daniel walks in and he
[1:30:58] tells the God after Nebuchadnezzar he
[1:31:01] goes hey I got it there's your
[1:31:04] dream Nebuchadnezzar goes your God is
[1:31:07] the real God okay here comes
[1:31:10] Darius who knows King Darius he comes
[1:31:14] after Nebuchadnezzar now Nebuchadnezzar
[1:31:16] just got the revelation of who God is
[1:31:17] and true God and he's also he's tried um
[1:31:21] uh Cedric M and a Ben go in the in the
[1:31:24] the hot FY furnace and then he even go
[1:31:27] well your God is the real God as well
[1:31:28] because they're all the one living God
[1:31:31] but Darius comes in he doesn't know
[1:31:34] belar he doesn't know Daniel he has a
[1:31:37] dream and and and oh not he sorry he he
[1:31:40] goes and the guys don't like Daniel
[1:31:42] because Daniel is really cool at this
[1:31:44] work he's really good and now a new
[1:31:46] manager comes in I wonder if there's
[1:31:48] somebody here new manager comes in and
[1:31:50] all of a sudden this guy everything
[1:31:51] you've done for all your life is undone
[1:31:53] in a
[1:31:55] second and all of a sudden the people
[1:31:57] that used to be your friends is not your
[1:31:59] friends anymore see how the World Turns
[1:32:02] yes it's a Cutthroat world yeah that's
[1:32:04] right and all that Daniel has done
[1:32:06] always is now Under Fire and they go hey
[1:32:09] you he should pray to you King Darius

[1:36:01] fruits of my not labor
[1:36:05] right and you you get so busy I'll give
[1:36:08] you a bit of a testimony you get so busy
[1:36:10] that you're spinning you don't know
[1:36:11] what's left or right and you think
[1:36:13] you're in the will of God but you're not
[1:36:15] because you didn't ask the will of God
[1:36:17] first you're just doing what you think
[1:36:19] he's leading you into you never stop to
[1:36:22] ask now and he's actually saying we're
[1:36:24] going right and you're like Ed I got it
[1:36:29] right he goes arand we're going
[1:36:32] right because it is because you're not
[1:36:35] in communion with him you don't listen
[1:36:36] to that voice saying don't do this don't
[1:36:38] don't go there go this way and you
[1:36:40] really think you're in the will of God
[1:36:42] but your whole circumstances says you're
[1:36:45] not the whole Christian Life shouldn't
[1:36:48] be torture and turmoil it shouldn't be
[1:36:50] hard it shouldn't be difficult difficult
[1:36:51] there will be tries and stuff but there
[1:36:53] must be Joy there must be a mountain
[1:36:56] experience we grow in The Valleys but we
[1:36:58] do get to experience mountains and if
[1:37:00] you're in the valley the whole time
[1:37:02] you're not listening and praying to God
[1:37:04] cuz he doesn't want to leave you down
[1:37:06] there he wants to bring you up into his
[1:37:08] presence you just need to take the time
[1:37:11] amen I hope that encourages
[1:37:13] you you know there is something about
[1:37:16] getting alone yourself many people never
[1:37:18] pray until they come to church many
[1:37:21] people think that it's the only place to
[1:37:23] pray is

[1:39:56] times when we were praying for people
[1:39:57] man almost

[1:40:48] them it's the best thing you can do
[1:40:51] don't worry about their
[1:40:53] situation don't worry about their
[1:40:56] salvation don't worry about where they
[1:40:58] at just pray for
[1:41:01] them I'm a living testimony that prayer
[1:41:05] works it doesn't mean you have to be in
[1:41:08] the perfect place to pray for them it
[1:41:11] doesn't mean you have to be a Godly
[1:41:13] saint that never sins it says and does
[1:41:15] anything wrong it's not your performance
[1:41:16] it's your prayer no matter how deep you
[1:41:20] are in the muck and the my cray you pray
[1:41:22] for them if you know God and don't know
[1:41:24] God still pray for them pray pray pray
[1:41:28] if you have the same Faith to believe
[1:41:31] for your salvation pray for the
[1:41:33] Salvation of your children that's right
[1:41:35] don't stop
[1:41:36] praying I didn't know the Lord I came to
[1:41:38] the Lord 32 years old praise the Lord
[1:41:42] some was just very slow okay I was very
[1:41:45] slow how slow
[1:41:48] leer but my mom and dad never ceased
[1:41:51] praying for me ever were they in the
[1:41:55] message no they prayed a sincere and
[1:41:59] honest prayer of a fervent righteous
[1:42:02] man they prayed they prayed they prayed
[1:42:06] that they see the results straight away
[1:42:09] nope did they think they were ever going
[1:42:11] to see the results yes because they
[1:42:13] believed so when you mothers and sisters
[1:42:16] and daughters and and even Brothers pray
[1:42:19] pray believing
[1:42:21] and expected it might not come now it's
[1:42:25] coming amen I want you to realize it's
[1:42:29] coming yes you can train a child so much
[1:42:32] you can scorn them so much you can fight
[1:42:34] with them so much you can push them away
[1:42:35] with your mortal thinking and deeds and
[1:42:37] reactions so much until you give
[1:42:41] up and let God take over cuz there can't
[1:42:45] be any of you there you can train them
[1:42:49] but when the training stops it's them
[1:42:51] and God they cannot be you in that
[1:42:54] relationship that's right amen when they
[1:42:57] hit 13 age of accountability them and
[1:43:00] God yes it's not looking like God's
[1:43:02] talking don't worry you talk to God Amen
[1:43:06] it's not you is him and God because the
[1:43:09] moment you hand your child over to God
[1:43:12] the moment you place him in the hands of
[1:43:13] the Living God Sovereign God that cannot
[1:43:17] fail they're coming because now the
[1:43:21] great Creator stepped on the scene he's
[1:43:23] just saying Hey sister brother not your
[1:43:26] time Not Your Divine appointment my
[1:43:29] Divine appointment and guess what I
[1:43:33] ain't never late am and I've never lost
[1:43:35] a battle Hallelujah so believe and he
[1:43:39] says
[1:43:40] here but prayer cast evil devil away
[1:43:43] from a child that's right prayer does it
[1:43:46] if Little Martha starts stomping a
[1:43:47] little foot and running out and turning
[1:43:49] up her little nose and you can beat her
[1:43:52] until she has no clothes on it's very
[1:43:54] hard but he's meaning this you can be as
[1:43:57] angry as you want as a parent he says
[1:43:59] she'll do it
[1:44:01] anyhow Bo Fallen
[1:44:04] nature we still do it my dad says don't
[1:44:08] go there I'll go yep yep yep yep going
[1:44:11] there because it was still my choice
[1:44:14] it's still the child's choice you cannot
[1:44:17] make your you can't live your
[1:44:18] Christianity through your child yeah you
[1:44:21] have to give them to God he says here
[1:44:24] but you just lay before God and claim
[1:44:27] that child's soul for God just stay
[1:44:30] right with it I believe it's the best
[1:44:33] thing to know yes sir that is the remedy
[1:44:36] I know is prayer or the best remedy and
[1:44:39] then he says here if you can believe for
[1:44:42] yourself you can believe for your house
[1:44:44] also so your wife your husband your
[1:44:48] brother your sister your cousin twice
[1:44:51] removed four time
[1:44:53] reinstated
[1:44:54] anyone that is under your umbrella that
[1:44:57] you cover and prayer God's got
[1:45:00] you see we don't we don't realize and

[1:45:11] the work I'm talking about you covering
[1:45:13] them with prayer honest sincere prayer
[1:45:16] lifting up in the presence of God and
[1:45:19] see what God will do for you you cuz we
[1:45:22] forget that God cannot
[1:45:24] fail God cannot make a promise in the
[1:45:27] Bible here and not keep it he's not a
[1:45:30] liar amen 32 years man my mom prayed for
[1:45:34] me for 32 years she's still praying for
[1:45:37] me

[1:45:43] control but learn when to take the foot
[1:45:45] off the
[1:45:46] acceleration and sometimes to get out of
[1:45:49] the car so that they can experience
[1:45:51] driving as
[1:45:53] well you know I I I was the worst
[1:45:56] trainer of anybody in the car I tried to
[1:45:58] train someone one day to drive a car I
[1:46:00] just don't have enough patience almost
[1:46:02] end up crashing into another car cuz I
[1:46:04] just got too frustrated and I realized
[1:46:07] quickly I'm not that guy so if you ever
[1:46:09] want driving lessons Ruben sorry Mom has
[1:46:11] to teach you I
[1:46:15] can't but I realized what was my
[1:46:17] weakness I realized that when I got in
[1:46:20] the way of God's work I failed every
[1:46:23] time every
[1:46:27] time Prayer Changes Things prayer
[1:46:30] changes death to life prayer changes
[1:46:33] sickness to health he changes Sinners to
[1:46:36] Saints amen amen want to read you
[1:46:39] another
[1:46:42] one I believe that Prayer Changes Things
[1:46:45] I've seen death driven back by prayer
[1:46:49] and life takes its place
[1:46:51] go God gave us the authority with his
[1:46:54] name by being Christians the most
[1:46:56] powerful weapon in the world and that
[1:46:59] the world is ever known is
[1:47:02] prayer and what produces faith is
[1:47:06] prayer prayer of faith shall save the
[1:47:09] sick so if you don't have faith
[1:47:12] pray if you want to add to your faith
[1:47:15] pray amen if you don't think you're
[1:47:17] going to ever get ill pray don't stop
[1:47:20] praying

[1:47:26] hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer amen
[1:47:30] that's right there is no greater force
[1:47:33] upon this Earth man could ever
[1:47:35] make but prayer is there that's right
[1:47:39] prayer ain't giving you the
[1:47:41] answers prayer is putting you in his
[1:47:44] presence answers will come he said
[1:47:47] brother brandom said God has never not
[1:47:50] given me an answer and he's never not
[1:47:52] answered pray prayer it wasn't always
[1:47:55] the answer I was looking
[1:47:57] for he still answered it amen let us all
[1:48:01] just stand up there quickly
[1:48:04] amen you young couples that want to get
[1:48:07] married and all those things I'll give
[1:48:09] you a couple of ones while we at there a
[1:48:11] man nowadays get married you young

[1:48:24] woman on the same way course this time
[1:48:28] is so
[1:48:29] uncertain amen a man should think and
[1:48:32] pray before he chooses a wife and when
[1:48:35] he chooses your wife or your husband if
[1:48:38] we were study it over a man should pray
[1:48:41] earnestly for you could ruin your entire
[1:48:48] life remember the bow until death do us
[1:48:51] part if the woman takes a husband and
[1:48:54] knows that he's not fit to be a husband
[1:48:57] that's your own
[1:48:59] fault she didn't
[1:49:02] pray so you shouldn't do anything until
[1:49:05] you prayed it through thoroughly
[1:49:08] through talking to your young
[1:49:10] men young
[1:49:12] sisters we didn't cover that but I
[1:49:14] thought I just fa to to read a little
[1:49:16] bit of that ministers ministers ought to
[1:49:20] always be alone by himself even before
[1:49:22] he preaches even before he prays even
[1:49:25] before he does anything he needs to get
[1:49:27] alone with God
[1:49:30] first humble us Lord yes if you want to
[1:49:34] be a perfect mute where's that one
[1:49:36] microphone give me the
[1:49:38] microphone this microphone has no will
[1:49:40] of its own it's just a receiver for the
[1:49:44] mouthpiece of God you want to hear from
[1:49:46] God be a microphone ain't special
[1:49:49] nothing special about about this no
[1:49:50] matter how many effects we put on there
[1:49:53] just be surrendered and let God speak
[1:49:55] through you just think about a
[1:49:58] microphone it's not working cuz it's not
[1:50:01] switched on but boy when you get in the
[1:50:04] presence of Lord and we're having old
[1:50:06] fashioned prayer meeting and the Lord
[1:50:08] comes down you'll see tongues and
[1:50:10] interpretation you see God manifesting
[1:50:13] himself because he's looking for this a
[1:50:15] surrendered
[1:50:16] vessel Amen Let Us bow our heads if
[1:50:20] there's anybody that needs prayer
[1:50:21] tonight or

[1:57:07] Christian guy so I'm not going to say
[1:57:08] who it
[1:57:10] is cu the young fellow's research it
[1:57:12] then but he it seems like he was brought
[1:57:14] up a Christian then he wasn't and he
[1:57:16] he's kind of made his money by saying
[1:57:17] how he'd like to be good but he's not
[1:57:19] sort of thing like to be a Christian but
[1:57:21] he's not and um one of his songs that
[1:57:25] you know made him a lot of money was a
[1:57:26] song and it in the chorus is I only talk
[1:57:29] to God when I need a favor I only pray
[1:57:32] to God when I need a favor and it was
[1:57:35] funny because I ran out of cream this

[1:57:50] we don't want that to be our portion
[1:57:52] that we just when things go wrong he's
[1:57:53] saying when it all goes wrong then I
[1:57:54] just quickly pray to God cuz I'm in a
[1:57:56] situation but we don't want that you
