[37:35] I mean God bless you all it's great to
[37:38] have everyone here tonight I mean let's
[37:41] um let's go to Matthew chapter 11 and
[37:45] then we're gonna turn to the Book of
[37:46] Ruth as well so Matthew 11 and verses 25
[37:54] down to verse 30
[38:04] it says at that time jesus answered and
[38:08] said I thank the O Father Lord of Heaven
[38:11] and Earth because thou has hid these
[38:13] things from the wise and prudent and has
[38:15] revealed them unto babes even so father
[38:18] for so it seemeth good at my sight all
[38:22] things I delivered unto me of my father
[38:25] no man knoweth the Sun but the father
[38:27] neither knoweth any man the father saved
[38:30] the Sun and he to whomsoever the Sun
[38:33] will reveal him come unto me all ye
[38:36] that'll all ye that labor and are heavy
[38:38] laden and I will give you rest take my
[38:41] yoke upon you and learn of me for I am
[38:44] meek and lowly in heart and ye shall
[38:46] find rest unto your souls for my yoke is
[38:50] easy and my burden is light
[38:53] amen let's just turn to the Book of Ruth
[38:55] and we'll read a few scriptures from
[38:58] Luke Ruth chapter 3
[39:10] and we're just gonna read we're just
[39:14] gonna read verses 16 down to verse 18 of
[39:20] Ruth chapter 3 this is Ruth coming back
[39:25] to Noemi it says and when she came to
[39:28] her mother-in-law she said who art thou
[39:30] my daughter and she told her all that
[39:32] the man had done to her and she said
[39:36] these six measures of barley gave he
[39:37] mean four he said to me go not empty
[39:40] unto thy mother-in-law then said she
[39:43] sits still my daughter until they all
[39:46] know how the matter will fall for the
[39:49] man will not be in rest until he has
[39:51] finished the thing this day amen may the
[39:54] Lord blesses word you may have your
[39:55] seats I'd like to speak tonight about
[40:03] rest it's just a four-letter word but
[40:05] it's a very powerful word amen so for
[40:10] the Christian there is real rest as we
[40:12] read through in Matthew chapter 11 Jesus
[40:14] makes the call come unto me all ye that
[40:17] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[40:19] I'll give you rest for your souls amen
[40:23] there is a real risk for the believer I
[40:25] mean we know that there's this you know
[40:29] there's these struggles and there's
[40:30] hardship and life and these things we
[40:32] have to do in busyness of life and we
[40:33] labor and so on but for the believer
[40:35] that truly enters into Christ is a real
[40:38] rest I mean there's a real peace there's
[40:40] a there's a risk for your soul that as
[40:42] Jesus was was a calling men to come to
[40:46] this wrist and we understand that he is
[40:48] still calling this night that people
[40:50] would take his yoke his word upon them
[40:53] for his yoke is easy and light and he'll
[40:55] give you rest for your souls now we read
[40:58] here in the Book of Ruth now The Book of
[41:00] Ruth we know is more than a love story
[41:02] it's more than just a you know four
[41:04] chapters of a nice story that that they
[41:06] were just put into the Old Testament but
[41:08] the Book of Ruth speaks of you it speaks
[41:10] of our Lord Jesus that speaks of
[41:12] Redemption it speaks of redemption of
[41:14] the Jews and the Gentiles or the whole
[41:16] plan of redemption is in the Book of
[41:18] Ruth it's more than a story book now
[41:21] reading and
[41:22] and in Ruth chapter three you know maybe
[41:26] if you still got your Bibles handy we'll
[41:28] just read a few more scriptures from
[41:29] here because you know when you truly
[41:31] enter into rest there's a far great
[41:34] there's a big difference between someone
[41:36] who's really entered into the Shekinah
[41:38] presence of God and dwells in his
[41:41] presence continually to someone who's
[41:43] maybe outside or even in the inner court
[41:46] but those who are in the Holy of Holies
[41:47] have really entered into rest they say
[41:50] that that doesn't make too much sense
[41:52] but I trust as we go on you know at will
[41:55] now Ruth we understand she is a she is a
[41:58] Moabite she's not an Israelite she comes
[42:02] back you know just to maybe give a brief
[42:05] summary you know Naomi is a Israelite
[42:08] she goes with her husband and two sons
[42:10] in the and Ruth chapter one you know
[42:12] there's a famine in Israel they leave
[42:14] the Promised Land they go into Moab you
[42:16] know they they dwell there for sometime
[42:18] to Ruth's sorry
[42:21] Naomi's two sons married to my wife
[42:23] girls one is Ruth and then and then
[42:26] noemi's husband dies her two sons die
[42:30] and she's left with her two
[42:31] daughters-in-law and then she hears that
[42:33] now grain you know food your harvest has
[42:37] come back into Israel there's no more
[42:38] famine there anymore so she says I'm
[42:40] going to return back to my homeland and
[42:42] she says to her two daughters-in-law you
[42:45] know stay here I'm going back to my
[42:47] homeland and all for the other
[42:48] daughter-in-law she she returned back to
[42:50] her kinfolk but Ruth said where you go
[42:54] I'll go where you die I'll die your
[42:57] people will be my people and your God
[42:58] will be my god hallelujah that was her
[43:01] resolve and it's the same thing with the
[43:03] believer something has moved you
[43:06] situations in life just like there's a
[43:08] famine it caused them to leave Israel
[43:10] and gone to the you know gone to Moab
[43:12] situation life caused them to leave the
[43:14] promised land
[43:15] then another situation and life came
[43:17] where where the famine was ended and
[43:20] they could return back to Israel and the
[43:22] situation life was now Ruth's husband
[43:25] dies offers husband dies their
[43:27] father-in-law dies and so this whole
[43:30] thing God is orchestrating because he
[43:32] wants Ruth hallelujah
[43:34] he was his ma black girl I mean who's
[43:36] the winner with nothing I mean to return
[43:39] back into not even her inheritance but
[43:42] but by Union by marriage to Boaz the
[43:45] mighty man of wealth I mean she falls
[43:47] into everything that Boaz has and she's
[43:50] and she's United into the promise of God
[43:53] by marriage hallelujah
[43:56] and it's the same thing with you or not
[43:57] by by union with our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:00] because we are married to him
[44:02] have you taken as your lawful wedded
[44:04] husband I mean to me he is the head and
[44:07] you are the body you subject everything
[44:09] you are to him I mean he's the head of
[44:11] the house humbly and by and by coming
[44:13] the head of the house he takes
[44:15] responsibility Amen he's in control
[44:18] I mean he's in charge I mean if he's and
[44:21] really in charge in your life you can
[44:23] rest I mean you can sip not just what's
[44:26] the woke up by but you know he's going
[44:28] to rule in control you don't need to

[44:48] what he's doing but do you know he knows
[44:50] what he's doing
[44:51] I mean cuz if you don't know that he
[44:54] knows what he's doing then you try and

[44:58] take these top two inches and mankind
[45:02] has taken these top two inches and look
[45:03] we're in this we're about to have
[45:05] another world war because man is taking

[45:20] world I give them that but we're going

[45:25] and we miss even we missed it please
[45:27] everything it's going to go bad you got
[45:30] to step out onto faith and say god I

[45:36] a man cause me to understand what's
[45:39] going on so I can just walk with you and
[45:41] you may not even see the end
[45:43] Tunnel that's when you walk by faith
[45:45] that's when you really trust God but
[45:48] Graham says when he yeah he says you
[45:50] turn over every stone so you go so so
[45:52] when something strikes you turn over
[45:54] every stone in your life to see if
[45:56] there's something Anton unconfessed sin
[45:58] or something wrong and this is once
[46:00] you've done all that then just be
[46:02] certain to God he's in control I mean

[46:43] mean I'm going to put these people in
[46:44] this place and they're gonna express me
[46:46] I mean they're gonna be a surrendered
[46:48] vessel and gods and I'm gonna live
[46:50] through them I'm going to show my mercy
[46:52] in grace to the world I'm going to show
[46:54] my divine love hallelujah you're gonna
[46:56] say I find myself in that number I find
[47:00] myself in this category of persons I

[47:13] this is Ruth three and one my daughter
[47:16] shall I not seek rest for thee we're
[47:19] talking about rest that it may be well
[47:22] with thee and now is not Boaz our
[47:24] kindred with whose maidens thou wast
[47:26] behold he would have he winter with
[47:28] barley tonight in a threshing floor now
[47:31] before we go any further there's a law
[47:34] in the Bible the law of the kinsman
[47:35] redeemer where a near family man who's a
[47:38] kinsman can redeem someone who's who's
[47:41] had to sell themselves into slavery or
[47:42] has found themselves into slavery if
[47:44] someone is as part of the family and
[47:47] they have the money they can do it they
[47:49] can redeem their family members out of
[47:51] bondage hallelujah and that's why God
[47:54] became a man because we were
[47:56] in slavery we are born in slavery to sin
[47:58] I mean but he looked down at you and
[48:01] said I'll not leave my family in this
[48:03] street I'll not leave them with nothing
[48:04] I'll not leave them destitute upon this
[48:07] earth I'm in but I'm gonna pay a price

[48:43] things in the blood of Abel hallelujah
[48:46] amen and then when you heard it
[48:48] something and you said how lujah I mean
[48:51] he's my kinsman doesn't matter what
[48:54] state you know Ruth was in the state she
[48:56] was in a real bad state the Bible says
[48:59] that a MOBOT could not come into the
[49:00] congregation of Israel that's what the
[49:02] law says I mean but grace overshadows
[49:04] the law hallelujah and here we are we
[49:08] were enemies not even in the promise of
[49:10] God I mean we were enemies we were
[49:12] aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel
[49:13] and never by his blood I am in he
[49:16] Brooklyn that middle wall of partition
[49:18] he bridged that gulf hallelujah he
[49:21] bruises the Gulf in your life I trust he
[49:24] has he's not some you know well had he
[49:26] knows he bridged it well beforehand he's
[49:28] maybe a story or someone else's
[49:30] testimony some distant God someplace
[49:33] sometime oh yes he was there two
[49:35] thousand years ago and yes and we can a
[49:37] man of history a member that means
[49:40] there's a gulf hallelujah but when it
[49:43] becomes personal to you when it becomes
[49:45] a living reality to you I mean that's an
[49:47] bridging the chasm hallelujah and when
[49:50] he bridges the chasm there's no more
[49:51] chasm oh yes they both go hallelujah
[49:56] there's nothing between my soul and my
[49:58] Savior
[49:59] hallelujah so he is Ruth now he's
[50:01] instructed by her by her mother-in-law
[50:04] see it's gonna find where he lays he's
[50:07] asleep member the harvest yeah there's a
[50:09] Bali harvest going on and all these
[50:11] things happening
[50:11] the real harvest was Ruth hallelujah she
[50:14] was the one Boaz you know when Boaz his
[50:17] eyes fell upon this one I've heard
[50:19] you're a virtuous woman hallelujah he
[50:22] doesn't care about the barley hallelujah
[50:25] cares about what how was the crop this
[50:27] year I don't care just give me a number
[50:29] okay that's cool you know I'm not
[50:31] worried about that I want to marry this
[50:33] one I've fallen in love
[50:35] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[50:38] you and I amen it's a love story this is
[50:41] a love leader this is a love leader
[50:44] between you and God
[50:45] amen and if you're in a relationship you
[50:48] can read between the lines to see God's
[50:50] hardness in his word it doesn't take you
[50:53] out of his word but you can see what his
[50:55] heart says hello Lee just like if my
[50:57] wife wrote me a letter I mean you could
[50:59] read it could be nothing to you but I
[51:01] could say well this is how she's feeling
[51:02] this is how the children are this is how
[51:05] things are going because I'm in a
[51:06] relationship
[51:08] hallelujah I can see what she's really
[51:09] saying to me without even saying it
[51:12] that's the same thing with the Bible
[51:14] it's more than stories I trust it's more
[51:17] than stories to you
[51:19] amen it's a love letter you mean even
[51:22] the law yes even the law even Leviticus
[51:26] and Deuteronomy oh yes that's a love
[51:28] letter I remember first time I read it I
[51:30] was just plowing through I'm gonna get
[51:32] through this and get through this and
[51:33] then and then the Bible came up real
[51:36] yeah a different book it wasn't I was
[51:38] reading one of the epistles of Peter and
[51:40] it wasn't Peter to whoever was it was
[51:42] Peter to be annoying in 2007 it became
[51:45] personal I read it before became
[51:47] different book hallelujah same thing
[51:49] with the Old Testament wasn't just
[51:51] trudging through and I got to read a
[51:53] chapter and yeah it becomes alive
[51:56] hallelujah I trust you can say that's
[51:58] happened to me I mean brother BAM said
[52:01] when the seals come up in the Bible we
[52:02] came in new book it's got to be coming
[52:04] you book to you
[52:05] a personal love letter to you I mean so
[52:08] now Nomi instructs boys I mean sorry
[52:12] Ruth find where Boaz lays down
[52:15] he's at the threshing floor lay down at
[52:18] his feet and then he will say what he
[52:23] will do so she so she went down she lay
[52:27] down at his feet
[52:28] now brother Bram says you're gonna find
[52:30] where Jesus Christ laid down because in
[52:33] the story of Ruth Jesus Boaz is Jesus
[52:36] Christ
[52:37] Ruth is you I trust you can say Ruth
[52:39] that's me that's me right so the Prophet
[52:44] tells us find where he laid down and lay
[52:46] down at his feet and he says Jesus lay
[52:49] down at Calvary he laid down at Calvary
[52:51] and you got a lay at his feet I mean
[52:54] you're gonna die with your sacrifice you
[52:56] got to die out and be born again I mean
[52:59] you had a lady out of his feet and by
[53:01] laying down into the street Ruth is
[53:03] telling Boaz you're the head
[53:05] I mean I'll place my I would place
[53:07] myself next year I played myself beneath
[53:09] you hallelujah that's the same thing
[53:11] with us we're gonna be wind to lay
[53:13] ourselves down at his feet but remember
[53:15] he doesn't leave us down at his feet
[53:17] hallelujah amen he picks us up to make
[53:21] us joint is hallelujah we joint heirs
[53:23] with Jesus Christ amen so now and then
[53:27] there's an appeal let's go down to verse
[53:31] 9 of of Ruth 3 I will hopefully get to
[53:35] where I'm wanting to go but this is
[53:37] where we are
[53:37] Ruth 3 and 9 and he said who art thou so
[53:42] so it comes awake and it realizes what's
[53:45] going on who art thou and she answered I
[53:48] am Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore
[53:52] thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou
[53:55] art a near kinsman now this changes
[53:58] things I mean but God godness would you
[54:01] can't separate God in His Word God is
[54:03] his word so now she is she is invoking
[54:06] so it's actually her drug night of God
[54:08] and that causes Boaz to act on her
[54:11] behalf
[54:12] amen it's actually Ruth initiating her
[54:15] Redemption if I can put it that way
[54:17] now we know that God first draws us but
[54:20] we've got to respond amen and then so
[54:23] here she comes
[54:24] Kubby cover me with your skirt cuz I'm
[54:28] your I'm your there are a near kinsman
[54:32] so he is telling she is telling him
[54:35] cover my shame cover my life amen cover
[54:40] my old nature cover my Marwijk birth
[54:44] hallelujah that's not even part of the
[54:46] Covenant of Israel I mean because thou
[54:49] art a near kinsman and only you can
[54:51] change who I am because member in a
[54:54] marriage the wife loses her identity and
[54:57] takes the husband's identity I mean
[54:59] that's why in the West you know the
[55:01] woman traditionally takes the husband's
[55:02] last name because her old name Amen that
[55:06] has done away with and a name represents
[55:07] her life Amen you think of Moses you
[55:10] think of 10 commandments you think
[55:12] that's I know you think the Red Sea you
[55:14] think Jesus you think all the miracles
[55:15] he did and dying on the cross
[55:16] resurrecting the Apostle Paul you think
[55:19] of yo you think of a life right so a
[55:21] name represents a life so now when we so
[55:25] when when she is saying that a near
[55:28] kinsman
[55:28] she's calling on him only you can redeem
[55:33] me I need a near kinsman your loss is
[55:35] that you can redeem me hallelujah you
[55:38] can change me from being a widow with
[55:40] nothing because only marriage could do
[55:42] it only marriage cos could could change
[55:45] who she was only a union with Boaz could
[55:48] change who she was hallelujah
[55:51] and so now she's saying cover me cover
[55:53] my old life don't you want to be covered
[55:56] by the blood I mean don't you want to be
[55:58] covered by his righteousness and it
[56:00] covered in His mercy and grace only that
[56:03] everything you you you used to being
[56:05] used to thinking used to do it's covered
[56:07] hallelujah that now no one can see it
[56:10] anymore
[56:11] hallelujah and then now she says thou
[56:15] art a near kinsman and that's what
[56:18] happens when we really come to the Lord
[56:19] because he's a deep calling to the deep
[56:21] so there's something in here I trust
[56:25] that's drawing you you may not even know
[56:28] what you're looking for
[56:29] initially but there comes a time in life
[56:31] we say there's more to life than this
[56:34] it's more to life than just a job and a
[56:37] career and even a family and a house and
[56:39] a what and a holiday and what if it's
[56:42] more and and the begins to be alarming
[56:44] in here now that's called a deep and the
[56:47] Bible a deep and it says that they call
[56:50] us to the deep I mean so now God is the
[56:54] other part of the deep and in order for
[56:56] the earth to be in longing for more so
[56:58] in order for there to be something that
[57:00] I want to know who I am and where are
[57:02] from and what happens when I die
[57:05] that's a deep call that's a deep call
[57:07] and order for there to be a deep call
[57:09] there has to be a deep to respond and
[57:12] before there was any longing in here
[57:14] there's a God to meet that longing there
[57:16] is a creator to meet that longing
[57:18] hallelujah there was a God who made all
[57:20] things to meet that longing amen so now
[57:23] this is what happens when you come to
[57:24] him you're basically saying there's a
[57:26] deep and you answer my deep hallelujah
[57:30] and I'm being drawn to you and why is
[57:33] that now because I'm part of you
[57:35] you're a near kinsman you're a family
[57:38] member I'm in your blood relation not
[57:42] talking about natural natural blood you
[57:45] could be even if you could trace your
[57:46] lineage all the way back to Noah or
[57:49] whoever doesn't mean a thing I mean
[57:52] that's just natural lineage spiritual
[57:55] lineage is what I'm talking about
[57:56] spiritual blood hallelujah because he's
[57:59] a near kinsman so now he begins to act
[58:01] on her behalf and then now just the same
[58:05] time will not read the rest of the
[58:06] chapter but we read there in verse 18 be
[58:09] still my daughter until they'll know how
[58:11] the matter will fall for the man will
[58:13] not be in rest until he has finished the
[58:16] thing this day and then now there's a
[58:18] nearer kinsman he wasn't willing to to
[58:22] marry Ruth so he forfeited his right and
[58:26] then Ruth marries Boaz marries Ruth this
[58:30] is chapter 4 and then and one ceremony
[58:34] Ruth goes from a widow
[58:38] - mrs. Boaz of Bethlehem
[58:42] she goes from a widow one ceremony do
[58:47] you take this woman yes do you take this
[58:48] man yes I pronounce you husband and wife
[58:50] whatever they used to do in the you know
[58:52] in the Jewish waiting ceremony but she
[58:55] she went from an alien to part of the
[58:58] promise and one ceremony hallelujah it's
[59:02] the same thing with you and I we're from
[59:04] an alien I trusted and and you laid your
[59:07] life down and he changed you
[59:09] there's Holy Spirit came into your life
[59:11] I mean and then now you can truly rest
[59:14] hallelujah amen now let's just go to how
[59:21] we're doing this just go to Abraham very
[59:22] quickly that's what every day that's
[59:32] what I read as you're turning to Genesis
[59:34] 17 I want to read a quote from why
[59:38] people are so tossed about but there are
[59:40] pictures of sermon why people are so
[59:42] tossed about he says you find in two
[59:43] classes of Christians one that one
[59:46] that's just doesn't matter what comes
[59:48] there's strong and faith they just keep
[59:51] walking there's another class that's up
[59:53] and down and in and out and left and
[59:54] right and round all tossed about by
[59:56] everything he says now well why is this
[59:59] and he comes to the conclusion one is
[1:00:01] that one has intellectual faith and they
[1:00:04] tossed about by everything another one
[1:00:06] has a real revealed faith in their
[1:00:08] hearts and they can just walk on and he
[1:00:11] sees that the ones who are not tossed
[1:00:12] about if gone into the very presence of
[1:00:15] God and then living the prints of God
[1:00:16] continually Amen by the blood of Jesus
[1:00:19] Christ we can go within the veil into
[1:00:21] the presence of God I mean but the
[1:00:23] others haven't gone into that place yet
[1:00:25] I mean so I trust by the end of even why
[1:00:28] even now if you're the one that's tossed
[1:00:31] about you say Lord take me in take me
[1:00:33] into the Holy of Holies dad Abraham
[1:00:39] Abraham goes through many things it
[1:00:43] takes him 20-25 years from when he's
[1:00:46] first called out of what we call modern
[1:00:49] day Iraq he leaves there and eventually
[1:00:52] ends up in the and what we call Israel
[1:00:54] today
[1:00:55] and it takes them 25 years not only to
[1:00:58] get there but to receive the promised
[1:00:59] son Isaac and during the journey you
[1:01:03] know you go read you go read the times
[1:01:06] that God speaks to Abraham and it's
[1:01:08] about three minutes of just reading it
[1:01:10] but he's got a 25 year journey so maybe
[1:01:15] when God came down to visit um maybe as
[1:01:17] long with that but you just read it's
[1:01:18] about three minutes of God speaking I'm
[1:01:20] The Almighty God you know it comes down
[1:01:22] as now kids that can does all kinds of
[1:01:23] things 25 year journey no church to go
[1:01:27] to no Bible to read but God has spoken
[1:01:31] to him and he walks in that revelation
[1:01:33] that whole 25 years and then he comes in
[1:01:37] Genesis 17 it says and when when
[1:01:39] everyone was ninety years old and nine
[1:01:42] the Lord appeared to Abraham and said
[1:01:44] unto him I am the Almighty God walk
[1:01:47] before me and be thou perfect and I'll
[1:01:50] make my covenant between me and thee and
[1:01:51] will multiply the exceedingly now this
[1:01:56] when it says I'm the Almighty God so we
[1:02:00] just read this as Almighty God in the
[1:02:01] English but in the Hebrew it means El
[1:02:04] Shaddai ayah which if you which means
[1:02:08] which means the strength give of the
[1:02:11] life giver like a woman who breastfeeds
[1:02:13] a baby so God is telling Abraham just
[1:02:17] nurse off the promise come to me and
[1:02:19] nurse I mean that you can receive
[1:02:21] strength to fulfill the promise because
[1:02:24] you know there would come a time it's
[1:02:26] just like any believers life can God do
[1:02:28] it it's tarried will it be fulfilled
[1:02:32] well the word be fulfilled in my life
[1:02:34] who's had that kind of time
[1:02:36] I mean when you have a promise and you
[1:02:37] just walk and walk and walk and you
[1:02:39] wonder will it happen it's the same
[1:02:41] thing with Abraham he's 99 years old is
[1:02:44] he gonna have the promise son he
[1:02:45] believed he would but when it was going
[1:02:46] to happen I think God comes down and
[1:02:48] says I am I am I am the almighty god I
[1:02:52] am El Shaddai I the strength give her
[1:02:54] the life giver like a woman who
[1:02:56] breastfeeds a baby your nurse off the
[1:02:58] promise and you'll gain strength and
[1:03:00] that's what we need to do I mean if
[1:03:03] we're really in rest just rest and nurse
[1:03:05] off the promise amen
[1:03:08] I trust you know there should be a
[1:03:10] hallelujah or something I you say really

[1:04:22] strife so what he's saying is when when
[1:04:25] someone confirms an oath both this
[1:04:28] there's a ceasing of all strife of as he
[1:04:32] cannot keep his part of the bargain
[1:04:34] is he going to do it you know when the
[1:04:37] oath is confirmed when they actually
[1:04:39] follow through with what they've
[1:04:40] promised then the other party can rest
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:44] the other party can rest because there's
[1:04:47] now a ceasing from all strife now the
[1:04:49] strife we have as believers isn't isn't
[1:04:52] what happens you know during the week
[1:04:55] that's just that's just everyday life
[1:04:57] people who are not even believers have
[1:04:59] the same struggle as we do you know
[1:05:01] there's no temptation that comes upon us
[1:05:04] that's common to men we we face the same
[1:05:07] things but there's a rest and the soul
[1:05:10] of the believer because his confirmed
[1:05:13] his oath to you of his word hallelujah i

[1:06:10] strife now you can just rest and nurse
[1:06:13] off the promise hallelujah because you
[1:06:15] already know he's going to do it I mean
[1:06:18] it's more than someone else's promise
[1:06:21] more than someone else's covenant with
[1:06:23] God that God made with them it becomes
[1:06:25] personal to you it becomes real to you
[1:06:28] then you can just rest hallelujah amen
[1:06:33] I'm glad we can do that don't you
[1:06:36] now very quickly
[1:06:42] the book of Hebrews Paul speaks about
[1:06:46] that by the blood of Jesus Christ we can
[1:06:50] go into the very presence of God we're
[1:06:53] in the Old Testament with the Tabernacle
[1:06:56] in the wilderness only the high priest
[1:06:58] has gone once a year with the blood the
[1:07:00] normal worshiper who wasn't even a
[1:07:02] priest they couldn't go into that place
[1:07:03] they couldn't go into the inner Court
[1:07:05] where the menorah was in different
[1:07:07] things they could just gone to the outer
[1:07:09] court right they couldn't go into the
[1:07:12] into where God was but but by the blood
[1:07:17] of Jesus Christ there's a new and living
[1:07:19] way and that veil has been rent and -
[1:07:22] that's why when Jesus was hanging on
[1:07:25] Calvary and he any and he gave up the
[1:07:28] ghost that that curtain which was more
[1:07:31] than what yours more than one layer of
[1:07:32] curtain
[1:07:33] massive thing rent from top to bottom I
[1:07:36] meant to signify by the offering that
[1:07:38] was just given on Golgotha I mean the
[1:07:41] people could step into where God was and
[1:07:43] in the Old Testament it was death to go
[1:07:45] on there I mean unless you're the high
[1:07:47] priest once here with the blood and then
[1:07:49] dressed a certain way I mean with the
[1:07:51] high priest garments and placed in the
[1:07:53] office and the anointing oil and
[1:07:54] different things that was it was taste
[1:07:56] to go in there hallelujah but now it's
[1:07:58] taste not to go in there
[1:08:00] I mean it's dance not to step into his
[1:08:02] presence hallelujah now in the article
[1:08:05] there's no roof it's just it's just open
[1:08:08] so these storms come rains come day and
[1:08:12] night comes and the believer who's
[1:08:14] standing in the outer court are affected
[1:08:16] by all those things
[1:08:17] is it raining no it's sunny I'm having a
[1:08:20] good day
[1:08:21] oh it's raining now I'm having a bad day
[1:08:22] in my walk oh it's windy no you are
[1:08:25] things aren't going so well it's daytime
[1:08:27] hallelujah it's that time where am I
[1:08:29] going I can't see that someone is in the
[1:08:31] out of court they're affected by the
[1:08:33] elements of the world now someone it
[1:08:36] goes into the inner court
[1:08:37] there's a roof so they say the storms
[1:08:40] indifferent yo what's happening in the
[1:08:42] world doesn't affect them but but the
[1:08:46] thing is now in the outer court there's
[1:08:48] the natural light of the Sun now there's
[1:08:50] a manufactured light of a seven golden
[1:08:52] candlesticks that was young me light in
[1:08:54] that place but there was a man-made
[1:08:56] light you had to keep topping there to
[1:08:58] keep filling the oil oil Bowl and the
[1:09:02] oil fit up into the candlesticks so men
[1:09:04] had to physically keep doing something
[1:09:06] to to keep light in the place you follow
[1:09:09] me man still had to do something you've
[1:09:11] still got to do something to keep life
[1:09:13] but it's but it's just a natural life
[1:09:15] right it's just a natural life I mean
[1:09:18] those in the outer Court act the manner
[1:09:21] in the wilderness and everyone rejoiced
[1:09:23] but then the man who went old and stale
[1:09:25] right but then in the inner court now
[1:09:28] there is the shewbread and different
[1:09:29] things but it was a man-made light it
[1:09:32] was a man-made life but those who we
[1:09:34] were into the veil they went through
[1:09:37] that in a veil where they wear the mercy
[1:09:40] seat where the artist was in the mercy
[1:09:42] seat in the cherubims and the ship
[1:09:44] kind of glory the prince of god came
[1:09:46] over the mercy seat I mean it wasn't a
[1:09:49] natural light anymore
[1:09:50] those are supernatural life because
[1:09:52] eternal life was more than just the
[1:09:54] light as a person
[1:09:55] hallelujah is God Himself veiled in a
[1:09:58] pillar of fire hallelujah and there was
[1:10:01] a thing of mana there that never got old
[1:10:03] and never went sales and never ran out
[1:10:06] hallelujah and it's the same thing out
[1:10:09] in the article people can all rejoice
[1:10:11] wasn't that a glorious meeting wasn't
[1:10:13] that a wonderful convention hey have you
[1:10:15] heard that sermon it was so wonderful
[1:10:17] and you're eating the manner but in the
[1:10:19] manner goes away and people go from Kent
[1:10:21] - careful Sunday the Sunday a we say -
[1:10:23] whatever amen
[1:10:25] but then when someone goes into the
[1:10:27] inner court and a veil goes into the
[1:10:29] earth the man who never gets old
[1:10:31] hallelujah and never yo it doesn't have
[1:10:34] to be collected every morning or
[1:10:36] whatever it was
[1:10:37] there's a pot over there that never runs
[1:10:38] out hallelujah and you're not you're not
[1:10:42] affected by by the storms of the world I
[1:10:45] mean in the problems show these problems
[1:10:47] and storms I mean but you're sealed in I
[1:10:50] mean you're hidden away with Christ your
[1:10:53] life is hidden from the world
[1:10:54] hallelujah brother Graham sees with us
[1:10:56] you're the teeth ceiling makes it sound
[1:10:58] proof I mean you don't even hear what
[1:11:00] the world is saying and doing hallelujah
[1:11:03] because you're hidden away within our
[1:11:06] Lord Jesus Christ amen you've gone
[1:11:09] within the veil with the glories never
[1:11:11] failed
[1:11:12] hallelujah no longer Tufts about of you
[1:11:15] know all these that manner and I can't
[1:11:17] eat it now because I've ran out and off
[1:11:18] you know different things are going on I
[1:11:21] mean your life you're living a hidden
[1:11:23] life hallelujah I trust you can say I'm
[1:11:27] dwelling in that place I don't just go
[1:11:29] on once a year and then go out again
[1:11:32] this is my dwelling place I mean I've
[1:11:35] really found rest hallelujah I really
[1:11:38] found eternal rest for my soul amen
[1:11:40] because I mean I've been bitten coming
[1:11:43] mother you understand this is not your
[1:11:45] ability to get into that place I mean as
[1:11:48] a deed calling to the deep I mean is a
[1:11:51] deep call coming to my presence
[1:11:54] coming to where I am I mean that it's
[1:11:56] not affected by the sunshine and
[1:11:58] whatever more but you're heading away
[1:11:59] with me hallelujah amen
[1:12:03] if you're in that place friends you're
[1:12:05] not tossed about doesn't matter what
[1:12:07] people do what's going on you're in
[1:12:10] there with your king with your
[1:12:11] bridegroom hallelujah amen and you don't
[1:12:15] have to fill up the oil that the light
[1:12:16] keeps shining
[1:12:17] here's the oil here's the life
[1:12:19] hallelujah and it never goes out
[1:12:23] hallelujah
[1:12:24] I trust to ask the musicians to come I'm
[1:12:29] just gonna in but hey where are you
[1:12:33] living
[1:12:34] I just want to really put it on you
[1:12:35] we're at the end of all things where are
[1:12:37] you living
[1:12:39] well I go to church I'm a good person
[1:12:41] doesn't matter doesn't matter how good
[1:12:44] you think you are goodness doesn't give
[1:12:46] you anything with God there's a thief
[1:12:48] hanging on a cross and their scribes and
[1:12:51] Pharisees there who are the good of
[1:12:52] people amen naturally would think the
[1:12:55] scribes and Pharisees who way better
[1:12:57] more people than a thief on a cross
[1:12:59] maybe but here's a thief condemned to
[1:13:01] die Lord remember me when you come into
[1:13:03] your kingdom they cease today you'll be
[1:13:05] with me in paradise Oh hallelujah and
[1:13:08] the other one said if you're really the
[1:13:09] Son of God come off the cross will
[1:13:11] believe you and they condemn themselves
[1:13:12] with their own testimony it's not how
[1:13:15] good we are
[1:13:16] it's I've heard thy voice our Lord and I
[1:13:20] come I mean because you've called me
[1:13:23] I've received your invitation and Here I
[1:13:25] am
[1:13:28] hallelujah so where are you living today
[1:13:30] I mean I trust you've passed the ribbon
[1:13:33] veil where the Glory's never fail amen
[1:13:38] you say well that sounds all but
[1:13:41] far-fetched no Jesus Christ is here he's
[1:13:44] alive he's present he's not back 2,000
[1:13:48] years ago or with the Apostles or
[1:13:50] wherever you want to see him in church
[1:13:51] history he's present amen is that and
[1:13:54] there's a reality of a people that
[1:13:56] really walk into the earth and to the
[1:13:58] holy of holies well what does that mean
[1:14:00] you're sealed into the kingdom but with
[1:14:02] His Holy Spirit amen and your nature has
[1:14:05] changed your outlook on life has changed
[1:14:06] everything you are has changed
[1:14:08] because you become a new creature in
[1:14:10] home hallelujah and nothing they meant
[1:14:14] gee you can be like the Apostle Paul
[1:14:16] none of these things move me yes I'm
[1:14:19] sealed away you think the high priest
[1:14:22] was conscious of what was going on in
[1:14:23] the camp when he was in the Holy of
[1:14:25] Holies you think he said oh there's
[1:14:27] trouble in the tribe of Reuben and
[1:14:29] what's GAD doing and what's Asha doing
[1:14:31] and what's jutsu doing if he couldn't
[1:14:33] hear those things he couldn't hear the
[1:14:35] squabbling and and and the politics of
[1:14:37] what's going on out there
[1:14:38] he was shut in Alleluia and made you
[1:14:42] walk you into that place understand we
[1:14:46] may never see the pillar of fire visibly
[1:14:48] but we feel as a fix I mean when we feel
[1:14:51] this presence come down that's God
[1:14:53] coming into the room I remember to
[1:14:55] imagine stepping into that place now
[1:14:56] maybe in the inner court your baby have
[1:14:59] a look like this of menorah if you've
[1:15:00] never been in there before
[1:15:01] there's the menorah there's the you have
[1:15:06] a look around but then when you walk
[1:15:08] into thee into the Holy of Holies do you
[1:15:11] think you'd be looking at anything else
[1:15:12] is a supernatural being there's a god
[1:15:15] you see lifted be like mid there being
[1:15:17] Sun Moon and stars that's the God that
[1:15:19] dwells in the proper Moses and brought
[1:15:20] us out of this out of bondage into the
[1:15:22] promised land
[1:15:23] you'd be fixed on that would you know
[1:15:24] how lujah your whole life would be
[1:15:27] centered or Matt where are you living

[1:16:50] from and it doesn't get old it doesn't
[1:16:52] get stale Lord your word never gets old
[1:16:54] or stale it gets more glorious Oh father
[1:16:58] may you Lord I pray you'd bring each one
[1:17:00] and Lord that they would know that
