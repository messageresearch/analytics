around and installing floors and going to the cafe and picking up this and picking up that and general daily happenings a song tune and different things just kept on coming throughout the driving and stopping and unloading and that so I actually wrote this song in my mind just driving around and then um I think I got a chance maybe on a Thursday or Friday night to Thursday night to finish some and then Friday night to actually figure out the chords that it was and how it actually um how the song actually worked to see if I was singing it correctly or not um and and this was uh finished on the um Friday before um Annie's mother passed away which was the Saturday night Sunday morning Sunday Sunday night was it Sunday night okay so I finished on the the yeah yes I know it was the Friday night because she went to hospital on the Saturday that's right so it's a different song than what I usually write it's it's we um I don't usually write this sort of style but I was thinking of um when I found out that his mother was quite sick I don't know I guess I I made the song for her I suppose you could say because it was different for me than my usual style but I want to sing the song I've got

this Wednesday night at St Marks and pukaro Bay we're having communion foot washing at 7:30 um I'll have your donation receipts all ready for for next Sunday um Sergeant Lee Sunday school class is having a military exercise after church out here so everyone is uh everyone's welcome to watch the live fire exercise amen and um also the ladi's toilets is broken so please use the mens there's only one bathroom so sorry about that I think that's everything okay let's turn to the scripture shall we it's hard you come up here and your mind is all on on different things and you know um let's go to Psalms chapter 1 I mean Psalms 1 and one we'll read we'll read down to verse three blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate Day Day and Night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper and let's go to Joel chapter 2 and we're just going to read verses um 21 down to 26 and then we're going to have uh one more scripture reading from Luke 21 so Joel 221 it says fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things Be not Afraid ye Beasts of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth uh her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine doth yield their strength be glad then ye children of Zion and and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the flaw shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I'll restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dwelt dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never never be ashamed and let's go to Luke 21 just just one more uh reading there so Luke chap 21 and verse 29 and this is Jesus speaking and he spake to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is n at hand so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass you know that the kingdom of God is not at hand verely I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled amen amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats now I want to continue on my thought I I think it's about three or four Sundays ago I can't remember how far back but I was speaking about Messiah and how we have the Messiah we have found the Messiah amen amen we have found the Messiah the Messiah for every age is the manifested word for that age amen amen so we have a present day God Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but now I want to go into the effect of having the Messiah because many people claim to have the Messiah or to have Jesus he is the Messiah but what would he produce in the people that actually have him so I want to go down this this is where going because you got to really look at now we are living out I'm just going to throw it out there we read there in Joel 2 about the restoration that that that the Locust and the Palm worm the cankerworm and the caterpillar and you know those things ate away you know there was a promise of I will restore whatever's been lost and we understand that we are living in a time of restoration where everything that was lost is now being restored back to man we understand that man is you know man is being been redeemed we're been placed as Adam was before the fall having dominion over everything upon this Earth amen and all the powers in hell every Power that can be named we have been given dominion over it amen there's a time of restoration and we're living in that time of restoration so it's not a prophecy anymore but it's become manifested in the people this is where I'm going you got to look at you really got to look at yeah I know sister Vanessa put on a while ago a photo of of modern day woman and she said I wish I had a photo of what the messes produces I could just go like this just do a panning shot amen amen hallelujah you got to be able to put yourself in that picture because this message was called to restore a people back to their proper position in Christ am and so we read there about that a man shall be planted like a tree planted by the rivers plural of one water amen he shall be planted like a tree and we understand that Jesus we read there in Luke 1 it says behold the Fig Tree and all of the trees now he's not talking about a natural he's not talking about just a natural fig tree in all of all of the trees but we understand from reading the Bible you read in Jeremiah 24 that Jeremiah sees a vision of two baskets of figs and it's Israel you go read it the the interpretation is given in the in the you know with the vision and one part one basket of figs is that part of Israel that'll be they'll all be taken into captivity one part will be scattered to the Nations and will never return and the other part the other basket of figs will come back and dwell in the land and that's exactly what happened when Israel was taken into captivity some of them were scattered to the Four Winds of the Earth but another part came back into the land amen so the tree in the scripture speaks of a Nation or a people and so now there has to be so he's saying when you see the Fig Tree or when you see Israel become a nation again you know that summer is not even at the doors you know the Millennium is closed amen going through these things I want to show you the message is in the scripture brother Bram was a word Prophet so what he preached is in the Bible it's not outside the Bible it's not just his own thoughts of what he thought about it but you can find it in the scripture I mean that's why I'm trying I think maybe I don't know uh what I Endeavor to do is show what he preached and show it to you in the scripture that you have a confidence that he's a word Prophet am amen because the message is in here it reveals Christ in here amen but if you can't see it in here someone can come along with a phrase or an isolated statement and it can destabilize you but if you can see it in the scripture then it gives you a confidence that you know in whom you have believed because Jesus is the word amen so that's why I want to I I trust I do it all the time but that's always my heart's desire is that the people would see the message in the Bible amen that when people say oh you just following a man no we're not following a man we're following the reveal word of God this made plain yes amen and that's why we listen to the tapes is because it gives us understanding of what is written in this book amen it takes God always uses a Channel of a prophet to reveal his word yeah amen and so those who are under the effect of that ministry will produce what God promised for the age okay so if he produced if he promised a restoration then those that are walking truly walking with with God God it'll be manifested in their life amen I I I trust you don't think this is too pie in the sky or whatever phrase you want to put there but you've got to look at yourself you got to look at now this is all around the world this is not just in these four walls that's right but God has has done a restoration amen amen this this tree that that that David wrote about there in Psalms 1 you know you can see that it was planted on the day of Pentecost a fruit tree was planted a bride tree was planted there in the upper room but then what you see in the book of Acts you do not see in the dark ages why is that because the tree false you know the Antichrist came in and chewed away everything that that tree was till it was just a stump you can go see it in church history the Catholic Church the Lutheran Church you you know when God was working in those church is bringing a Reformation it wasn't it wasn't like Pentecost but it was growing back to become like the day of Pentecost amen so we we have been we have been restored not back to the move of Pentecost of zeusa street that many people think was was a final restoration but we' have been restored back to the same book of Acts church that you read about in the beginning because God had to give a quick demonstration to show this is how I work in a group of people amen you have you know they had Miracles they had healing they had Visions they had dreams they had prophecy they had prophecy for their local area agabus was a prophet he prophesied of the famine that was going to come that's why Paul went around and gathered up money to you know buy food for the church down in Jerusalem and those things so specific prophecies for there you know that that was what was happening in the church they were governed by the Holy Ghost amen amen but then what happened is you you don't get very far in the book of Acts I think it's acts 15 where there were there were people people were Jews and they came into the faith but they didn't have a real birth and they tried to make the church say oh you've got to keep the law you have to become a Jew then you be can become a Christian and it's always the light of a former age because that you know the Jewish law was was a former thing God did but then he fulfilled the law in Jesus Christ that it wasn't wasn't a bunch of ceremony trying to sanctify ourselves in a in a in a man-made way but then God came down into his people separated them unto himself and then dwelt in them amen hallelujah but then it was the former people who were Jews but didn't have a full conversion they came and said well you've really got to do these things because many things of the former age seem really good brother Braham says the Pentecostal move they were great legalists amen they're great legalists and you can see it that's right in other places where people come in it doesn't matter how many years they've been walking with the truth but but what they've came out of it hasn't come out of them and because it seems so holy and Sanctified I believe in Holiness living absolutely the word teaches it but then but then it can be so ingrained in them and that people are only satisfied if the for example of the brothers come in a certain TI of church amen now I'm not I'm not preaching either way because you kind and for say because what is this does this pertain to Salvation I'm uh this is of my notes but you know does am I a better Christian cuz I wear this that's right I wear this because I love the Lord and I come to respect him amen amen and I'm meeting the king that's just me but that's just me I wouldn't force that upon anyone but people get this idea from a former age oh they're in a certain tie they've made it that's right they've rarely made it but they can just be a wied wall that's right they can just be dead on the inside that's right amen amen that's right so but then so it's the former age that affects or tries to influence what God is doing because just like in the first church now there's a pattern the pattern is God placed manifested the church in the book of Acts the enemy came and chewed it down yes that's right then he became then it became nothing in in the days of the Dark Ages that's why it was the Dark Age CU God couldn't manifest himself like he did originally but then eventually there was a restoration until finally the bride tree the fruit tree that was planted there on the day of Pentecost is manifested again in this hour yes amen but then what happens now is there's a challenge because it's like in the natural you plant a tree you you know you make a garden there's always bugs that will try and eat the fruit there's always a bug or a caterpillar or whatever it is that'll come and try and eat the leaves or try and get get into the bark and diseases and things there's always those things that will try and come in it doesn't matter what season doesn't matter if the next day you're going to pick the fruit off the tree it doesn't matter if you've just planted it or everywhere between there's always a bug you know I think the only time I planted anything in the pots outside my house I just put a a it was a brass I think it was a a broccoli I just put this planted this broccoli and then here comes a white butterfly I just put it in and here comes this guy cuz they love them and that's the thing where where where the life is where the thing that because I want hey I want to eat broccoli there was something I want to eat that fruit you I want to eat what's produced so as soon as there's that desire and then the gardener plants it the enemy comes along that's right and tries to eat it up that's right amen it's the same thing now with God he's planted a tree amen he's taken he's taken bunch of dead sticks he's taking a bunch of dead people he's planted them in his righteousness amen because he saw and knew there was a seed that would bring forth God upon the Earth Hallelujah he saw that you were that part of that tree and so he planted you in his word amen he planted you in his word because he knows this is the hour where I'm going to produce what the Bible said would be produced and then but now here comes that little butterfly Here Comes The Devil around because he says oh that must taste pretty good I'm going to ruin that I'm going to kill that thing see the devil doesn't care how fundamental we are he doesn't care how much we know the Bible or how much we can quote brother brand the only thing he is against is the life of God manifested in a people we should know the Bible we should know the message absolutely I'm not I'm not supporting ignorance and just floating along but he if he can just stop that life coming forth that's all he wants to do and he'll do everything he can to stop the life of God and the people amen hallelujah but God has ordained amen God has purposed amen I'm G to have a I'm going to have a tree I'm gonna have a planting of the Lorden amen it see he says in Isaiah 60 and 21 thy people also shall be thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land forever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that I may be glorified Hallelujah this is what God has desired he wants a planting he wants a people to produce his life amen Isaiah 16:22 oh sorry this's the same sorry speaking in the same uh scripture here a little one shall become a thousand and a and a small one a strong Nation I the Lord will hasten it in his time this is what he said this is what the planting of the Lord will be like this you know never never degrade Who You Are amen never belittle what God has made you doesn't matter what's come against you what tries to wear you down never belittle what you are amen we should we should stand with our heads held high we should have pride in our God

jealous gardener he will not share his plants with any butterfly he won't share his plants with any caterpillar or slug or whatever it is amen do you think he wants the you know he doesn't just plant Us in his righteous and say now devil here chew them up right take away their Joy take away their peace take away their longsuffering amen he doesn't just have at it he's actually what he does is he he may allow it but he's like job to Satan look at this one he's my planting in his season look at him have you considered him devil and Satan says no I haven't actually cuz he doesn't look at you like God looks at you he doesn't value you like God values you his head's a perfect man it's only because everything's going well okay do what you want just don't take his life and I'm paraphrasing it but you know what I mean and then but God now job overcame by standing on the blood of the Lamb he didn't understand what was going on I know I've said these things before but I trust it just anchors down he didn't see a way out he couldn't call his children up from the grave that's right he cuz you know cattle and camels or whatever you can get those again you can't get your children again if they're dead they're dead he couldn't he couldn't restore that to himself but he just he just sold you do anyway then God said I will restore amen and he had more children in the in the end than he had in the beginning he had more in the end than he had in the beginning and he had those ones that already died they died under the blood of of the Lamb amen so they weren't lost that's right you with me amen but there was a restoration now Isaiah 61 and3 now I'm sorry I didn't give the scriptures but anyway to a point unto them that mourn in Zion so I'm just showing you how we are a fruit tree or we are a Vine okay I'm just not throwing things out I'm just wanting to show you this to appoint unto them that mourn and Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes now remember we are Zion we are in Zion the bride is Zion Amen to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen and then John 15 And1 I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth that he may bringeth forth more fruit praise God when he when he deals with us hallelujah praise God for a pruning season amen amen hallelujah hallelujah now you are clean through the W I have spoken unto you hallelujah hallelujah I'm just trying I'm just trying to behave but abide in me now just these things are incredible we read there we read our opening scripture about the former and latter rain shall run together in the first month that former Reign is the teaching rain there's been a teaching come across the Earth as messages been taught but the latter rain is a quickening rain amen mean so it's not just years of teaching and just planting and there there but now there's a rain there's a spir because the rain is the spirit that falls amen so there's a teaching but that but the quickening comes in behind it amen that's why it's such a rapid growth Hallelujah he said he would do it and he's doing it friends Hallelujah that's why such a you know come in just a few years is such a quick quick work amen all the works of the you know denomination and other beliefs they just get blown away amen hallelujah and it changes people's life Hallelujah we have seen this this is all over the world but you're living in this scripture do you know where you are hallelujah amen he promised it and he's doing it Hallelujah I am the True Vine I'm very excited about this Hallelujah because this is remember oh Trump who cares about Trump who cares about Putin who cares even about the Vatican and all their nonsense who cares about those people God is a planting I mean when you see the Fig Tree and all the trees bring forth hallelujah amen God is looking at you I've said it before here's Abraham 25 years upon the Earth in those 25 years monuments are built cities rise nations rise Nations fall there's battles there's developments and technology and all these different kinds of things where is it in here it's not in here why is that because God doesn't care about all God's focused on his son H you going to be the father of Nations mean you going be the father of the faith I'm going to walk with you from this Babylon into your inheritance HJ and his eyes are focused upon Him Hallelujah and if that's the father of the faith how much more the children hello children how are you doing today God's focused upon you amen people you know people get this thing in their mind God doesn't he's not interested in me he doesn't understand my situation that's a bunch of nonsense Hallelujah that's why Jesus God became flesh as a man is that he know what it would like to be a child you know and I've said it before but you think of a 12-year-old boy they go to Jerusalem the you know the capital of the nation he doesn't go look at all the you know where does he where does he stay behind he doesn't go look at all the maybe the big castle and all the cool stuff that that boys would like he goes into the temple he talks and he opens he doesn't just you know and then he and he actually opens the Bible and says what about this what about this discusses things with them he wasn't a normal kind of boy he wasn't a normal kind of boy he would have been made fun of in the village because for one he had the black name of oh your parents weren't even married when you were born you know he had a black name to begin with so he would have been made fun of he knew what it was like to be misunderstood you know he knew it was like to lose loved ones where's Joseph when he got old it's because Joseph died di no silent years he knows he you he knows what it's like to be rejected be made fun of be misunderstood he knows what you've what you carry that's right he understands cuz he's walked in your shoes hallelujah amen he knows what it's like to be mishandled mistreated yeah he was the Lamb of God he comes to the temple he's the one that can deliver the whole nation from their sins amen from their dead religion and they spit on his face rip out his bed if you're a prophet tell us who hit you then we'll believe you and those same ones that made that mockery came and it was Nicodemus before that says we know your a teacher comes from God because no man can do this unless God be with him he understands he's been in your shoes Hallelujah so never never let the devil light say he doesn't understand God doesn't care if he really care he deliver you he will yes amen amen but his love is elective love amen Jacob before they even born Jacob I have loved and Esa have I hated Hallelujah I've been accepted of the Beloved amen before either of them were born God said I've chosen this one I've rejected this one because he knew by four knowledge that's right amen now I am the True Vine and my father is a husbandman every branch in me that beareth not the fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me now I'm just going to stop there because he also said Jesus said I'm going to go back to this but Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done and in the age of the Reformation the man age they there many books written abiding in Christ and you've got to pray so much and you've got to read so much and that's abiding in him now you should pray and read there should be a I know we're busy but there should be on your heart Lord I just want to I want to spend time with you Lord I'm just driving but here I am I can talk to you you can talk to me alwayss on your heart should be him first and foremost but but people begin to teach that it's it's the amount of time you spend as you abiding in his words there's a qualifier of the amount of time you spend and therefore now you can ask what you will but the true abiding in Christ is not the amount of time that you spend but it is his word remember he is his word he is a living being so if you abide in me and my word abides I abide in you so if God himself comes and steps down into you that's you that's how you abide in Christ as when God dwells in you Hallelujah I'm abiding in Christ it says ask what you will and it shall be done am amen hallelujah that's how you abide in him if a man abide not not in me he cast he cast forth as a branch and it Werth I mean withth sorry and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you here we are you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here and is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples so to abide in Christ is I mean to be part of the vine is if the life ye are the Vine I just don't want to get this mixed up ye are the Vine wait I am the vine ye are the branches I always get things back to front Okay so he is the vine and the vine puts forth a branch and the branch produces the fruit so if the life of the vine is in you it will produce a life amen I know it's very Elementary but if the life the life of the vine has to be in you and if the life of the Vine and you will produce a life all right so we know now so we know the man so the fruit just like a natural tree or you take an orange tree there is a citrus life or there's an orange life in the tree and that is manifested in the oranges yeah or or any any fruit uh giving giving tree or a Vine but what fruit did the first church have okay now we know they cast out Devils they healed the sick they raised the dead there was prophecy among them as I as I said before agabus in Acts 11 prophesying of a drought that would come and the church was directed by the Holy Ghost himself but then it's also in Acts 246 it says and they continually daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved so there was Joy I mean there was gladness and there was signlessness of heart I mean they all just one big happy family this was the first church and so and then Jesus said by this you know by I mean I think it's uh first John by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you love one another all right so there's a manifestation of of a Divine love one between the other which is which is what the first church had okay so they didn't have clicks they didn't have a you know there was a singleness of heart am amen amen so it wasn't they didn't have none of them had a um had a desire I wish I'd see that person fall or I hope they fail in what they think God is telling them to do there's a singleness of heart saying you know we're all in this together doesn't matter if we're Jew Samaritan Greek Gentile you know whatever you know we're all in this together cuz we're all part of one body and you always see when Paul is writing he's contending against division in the church amen he is always contending against that and he's contending against like with the Galatians he was contending against the light of a former age the legalism of a former age coming in amongst the believer he was fighting these things and he told the people and in uh Galatians 5 and22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law so he's saying what is produced really the fruit of the spirits not the fruit of the flesh CU he because he lists all that but the Fruit of the Spirit and the believer should be love joy peace longsuffering yeah I'm just going to read again gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law so that should be that was manifested because remember Paul when he's talking about these things it wasn't just a theoretical idea it was a living reality cuz he could identify because remember he God used him to write most of the New Testament so they couldn't go back and say well let's read verse and verse and it says this here and here and here and this is how it should be they were living by inspiration cuz all they had was the Old Testament so but Paul could see because he knew it was God after searching the scriptures he knew it was God that he met on the road to Damascus and then he could begin to see the life that was being produced because that Spirit came and dwelt in the people and that's why he could write these things he said this is what it produces amen so it's not a oh that sounds nice or this is how it should be that's how it was amen so that's how it was but then I said now it went from that and then it went down into the dark CES it was just the stump of the tree because it says in Joel 1 and four it says that which the Palm worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left has the can worm eaten and that which the canor worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten now these bugs are all the same bug in different stages right so it is a even though I speak of natural things here here but God is really this is a prophecy now of this is what's going to happen in the seven Church ages from Pentecost down into the Dark Ages right and then we read in Chapter 2 but there would be a restoration of everything that was taken away is going to be restored Hallelujah and so now it was planted on the day of Pentecost this tree everyone was of one Accord of singleness of heart everyone had Joy love peace long suffering all those things amen they were one body walking in one Accord and then now but the enemy did not remember he hates the life he hates the life of God on display he wants to he wants us to all become grumpy bitter you know rigid dogmatic people with no love if he could that's right he would make us that way and brother Bram I think I'm jumping ahead of myself but if I can't find it it comes to M he speaks in the if I can find it he says oh yes so there an au tharan Church age he says I want to give a warning right here this is speaking of of of this age now but it's written in the thar and church age chapter in the church age book it says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold and the later see or last age selflove the love of material things will take place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit so he's actually talking about believers they have not recognize the effect of the spirit of the age because theyve become hard and and crusted and dogmatic in my way or the highway and this is how it should be and what's happening is now it's not the fruit tree growing anymore amen amen it's like you know brother Bram he you know he was out hunting and there was a burnover so so fire had gone through a forest and there's just these old big trunks there and it's blowing in the wind and it's just the wind would blow through the Trunks and it made a horrible sound it's like a morning sound the days of Miracles has passed and I may say and and the wind we know is the spirit and I don't I don't want to add to it but this is just me people say now there's a great Falling Away there's been a great falling away for 2,000 years amen amen there been a great falling away for 2,000 years and so people but then people make a mournful sound but what's happened the fires come through and all these are just these big old trees standing around but there's no it's just the wood yes that's right amen and a tree without leaves can't can't absorb sunlight right that's right amen you need the leaves you need the leaves to absorb the sunlight that the water that comes up through the roots now the plant can grow if you don't have leaves you're not going to get any s you you're not going to have any life in you that's right he with me but then he looked down and he saw these little seedlings growing up swaying in the breeze now we don't just we want to be fully mature Believers but I don't so in a way I don't want want to be green you know the saying oh that person's green they're inexperienced you know that saying so in a way I want to be green because green you're flexible but I want to be a a mature believer in Christ but I want to stay green Amen in that way because the more the bigger the tree the more leaves they have and the more leaves they have the more sunlight they can absorb Hallelujah I'm talking about ESO inl he with me this is what we want to absorb amen amen now so people Unfortunately they haven't realized the effect of the last day Spirit yes that's right amen and why why do people become that way it's because things come in and they pull the other way amen they pull the other way in in defense trying to hold something together and remember there's but with a road there's two ditches on either side amen so the challenge is always now when things happen to us that's right amen bad things can happen to us you know misunderstand yeah I mean among Believers bad things can happen brother so and so sister so and so can say so and so and you can do so and so you know but you can't let it have you pull the other way amen because what is stronger you say well you know there's been Winds of Doctrine come through through among the Believers over the years now the real trees I'll put no I don't know I I got to be careful before I say this don't misunderstand me but false things can come through where once was you you you take the book of Acts Church they all had sing of singleness of heart they loved each other you know the love of God was manifested among them but the enemy came in you got to be a Jew before you can become a Christian and the resurrection's passed already and all these false yeah Paul Paul writes about false doctrines and so so what would happen now things would be lost CU you know when a storm passes through the tree still there but it's maybe few lost a few branches amen and so things have been lost and then people if they've pulled the other way they can say well in the old days it wasn't this way but there's an hour of restoration friends amen if the devil's robbed us of anything we have a right to claim it back amen we have a right we can't just can't just be victims saying oh it was like this 30 years ago why can't we have it now just okay but it can be like oh we had it gloriously downstairs why can't we have it here you know what I mean like we can't just look through the rearview mirror if if the devil's taken something from us we have a right to get it back amen it's like the honeymoon feeling once upon a time we had it oh but we're just years down the road you have a right to get that back amen what's a sweetheart always a sweetheart Hallelujah that's how it should be that's right so the devil's taking it from you you have a right remember a full restoration I'm not just talking about I'm down on everyone's level now am how are we doing you have a right and you should be angry at Satan if he's robbed you of anything even the joy of your salvation amen that's right amen you have a right to lay claim amen you Hallelujah you have a right so don't just sit back and say well this is just uh those days are gone who says those days are gone hallelujah amen search for it and redeem it Hallelujah now he says now the first thing so this so this enemy came in in four stages and the first thing the enemy did because there's four stages of the same bug remember we read there's in restoration of the Bride tree you do well to go and listen to it the first thing the first fruit he took off was brotherly love so the fruits of the spirit read about in Galatians the first one is love joy peace long suffering all those things so the first thing the enemy came in and took off the tree was love amen and he says that's one of the things that kills the church right there it's when when Brotherly Love Goes it kills the church amen the next fruit so love is the first fruit on the tree love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness Faith patience that right in the Holy Ghost now nine spiritual gifts with the nine fruits of the tree and so forth all right now the first he got the eating of the fruit of the tree so he says now let's picture a big tree of God's tree it's bearing nine spiritual gifts they're Healing The Sick they're speaking in tongues they're casting out Devils they're doing great works and preaching the unadulterated word of God no denomination to tie them down they're free doing a great work so in came this little old devil set up with his two horns sitting out in front like a grasshopper you know and his little old greedy teeth that's the first the pal worm he come to eat off brotherly love he said you know so and so did so and so over it so and so's church I won't believe that bunch of people see there he that's the first thing next he wanted to eat the fruit of faith faith in the word amen now look how do you know that that is the word it's been translated so many times that's right amen and can people can say say well how do you know that he is a real prophet he said this here and he said this here and he said this here I'll say this the Revelation contained in in the message is perfect amen amen and there was a dispensational change brother Ram said when the seals opened the Bible became a new book to him amen so there's a because remember the message when we listen to it it unfolds to us but you got to remember it unfolded to the prophet because prophets don't know everything just like the shunamite woman you know her son was you know got Sun struggles hang in the the field and and and was dead and she said settle me settle me a mule I got to go to the prophet and then gazi sees the shunamite woman coming and says to the prophet I think it's Elisha here comes the shite woman he didn't know what was going on so the word unfolded to the prophet as much as it unfolds to you that's right amen amen and as the word progresses then all of the falsehood goes and the truth comes in amen but people will take isolated statements and say he said this here he said this here it's the V it's someone's voice you got to remember there's a man part and then there's the office amen if you took every word I said I wouldn't take every word I said cuz I stut around I say things back to front is this okay take it's like brother R said it's like a Dutchman or I can't remember what nationality says take what I say and not what I mean yeah amen he said about the you know you know you on the preaching of the seals and he said about the 700 uh 700 hadn't bowed their knee to bail you know in the days of of of Elijah of course it's 7,000 and people thinking that he's he's actually correcting the Bible or did you mean 700 7 he said of course I meant 7,000 that's it's just that you know his mind is on other things right but God protects those things you got to understand it but people take quotes and all the they don't they paint a picture that's wrong amen and the enemy uses that as well I hope that's okay but the Revelation contained in it is perfect and I would if you think well that's just his advice people came to John the Baptist and said what should I do soldiers what should I do do violence to no man be content with your wages said you so they just asked for his opinion what they consider but then they took it as now this is God's Prophet speaking I'll take it on board amen so whenever people just think well that's just brother bram's opinion well I would rather do what those people did to John the Baptist and actually took it I'm going to do what he said amen and you'll find what he said in the Bible anyway now Faith in the word that's that devil still eating the words been translated so many times this and that amen and he says what's another fruit I'm just going to read so I'm going to read a big portion of this but what's another fruit Joy of salvation the enemy comes and tries to eat away our joy of Salvation he says you people make too much noise someone asked brother Bram how can you a woman one time how can you preach with all this noise people are crying all these things he said if they didn't do that how could he preach he says it's like a skunk dog it's like a dog called fritz or whatever it's called you know you the worst thing you the dog was scared of a skunk but then all the owners did is have they sick him boy sick him and the dog will get right in and get him hallelujah it's like someone says amen he I mean sick him hey we got a devil to tree and once we tree him we're going to hang him Hallelujah so you know he's saying if people will quiet he said well there would be something wrong why CU there show there should be a joy you know brother Billy Paul brandham he gave the testimony in Bram Tabernacle of of his life you know with you know with brother Braham and everything he said there was a woman in the Tabernacle and she would have her purse and his brother was preaching she' begin to swing it around and around and she'd let it go across the church as he's preaching cuz she's so happy now there's no record that I've heard that she ever got rebuked for that but there was Joy of Salvation people were happy we should be happy all the time amen we have we're free hallah we're free indeed amen we're not bound by anything in this world Hallelujah if a bomb drop right now praise God hallelujah I'm free Hallelujah we have not been bound by Creeds opinions of man denom any such thing we're free people hallelujah that should produce a joy amen hallelujah glory amen it's the old Palm where you eats out the joy amen I tell you all this crying saying amen they're shouting that nonsense there's nothing to it see no there is something to it amen hallelujah when you see a life that's lived then you hear that come forth hallelujah hallelujah amen so but this old bug started eating on it he eat all the all the joy away next fruit on the tree is peace peace of mind knowing that you're saved they tell you well now if you recite our Creed you're saved if you join my church you're saved well now this one says you're not saved if you go there you have to join our church to be saved now I'm going to I'm going to bring it down home if people say oh you don't see what I see in the message you you don't have it you got to recite my Creed right cuz some people think you got to stand up and say I believe that Jesus died on the cross for me I believe Malachi 4 was fulfilled in the life and Ministry of William Bram I believe the seals are open I believe you know it's just a Creed it becomes a saying right he follow me we should believe all those things you understand but it but it become people just you know match oh is this person really in because if they see these things now I've come to a place remember Jesus spoke of the parable of a harvest speaking of like a corn or a wheat field now if you look at any crop growing there's a whole field some part of the field is golden some parts are still a little bit green some some parts are still growing but eventually they all come to the same maturity they all come to the same golden color Amen in in humility with their heads bowed bowing to the very Sun that gives them life amen hallelujah they all come to the same maturity and it's when they all you know the you're the Harvester if the farmer looks out says one part the field yeah I'm going to harvest that part's ready that's a silly farmer cuz he's wasting the rest of his crop Our God's not that way amen Our God says when everyone's ready then the Harvest will come than you Lord then the Rapture the body change will come because when the spirit of Truth has come he'll lead you and guide you into all truth so you have to have confidence that the god that's leading you will lead you and guide you into all truth amen but in his season he'll lead you as long as you're willing to be led thank you Lord hallelujah is that okay that should give confidence you should have confidence in the spirit that's leading you amen because if it's God he'll lead you into his word yes amen hallelujah but if people come say oh you don't see this you're out you know I've had conversations with people like that I say no I don't I'm not reciting your Creed amen it's more than just reciting an acknowledgement of a fact right amen you know it's more than just acknowledging oh the Seven Seals open it's more than just saying I believe it there should be a manifestation why do the seven seal do bring Christ to the Earth amen the Covenant angel coming down with an inheritance amen hallelujah that his life becomes manifested in the people like it was in the beginning amen hallelujah and so I don't I shouldn't even need to say I believe in it open you should see it in Meen Hallelujah my goodness amen hallelujah we are not we have gone past Christianity has never been just saying a word yo faith without works is dead so faith without a life is dead I mean without a life is dead amen you have to say how Mary you have to have your name on this book amen there goes the amen that's that's a sad state to be in right amen that takes all the that would take all the joy out but that's not God's tree amen now then now the next thing the Locust eats the leaves a locust takes takes onto the leaves what the Palmer worm left the pal worm eats the fruit all the fruit of and then the Locust comes in and he eats the he eats what the Palm worm left now what did he do what did this palmor worm do D I mean what did this Locust do destroyed the leaves what's the leaves for destroying Divine Fellowship amen the destroying Divine Fellowship so there's no place you get a big big tree and it's a hot summers's day you go rest under underneath it in the shade you cool off you enjoy it Hallelujah but if there's no if there's no leaves there there's no canopy to to produce the shade you might just be sitting out in the open Hallelujah and so it's the same thing it's the same thing we we we we spend time with each other amen we you know you know we have Fellowship one and and and it's so refreshing doesn't matter who you spend it with remember there's all around the world I'm not just saying in these four walls okay but you go with real Believers and you go spend time with them and there's just such a refreshing why is that cuz you've come under a shade tree Hallelujah there's Divine Fellowship yes that's right amen what's the leaves for I mean he he destroyed the leaves what's the leaves for he says he's destroying divine ship that's right now he's Presbyterian I'll have nothing to do with him he's nazarine he's Pentecostal he's this s or whatever I'll have nothing to do with him because he don't belong to our group now you come on home he sees it's open he sees it's closed this person's this way this person's this way persas of the message what I'll have nothing to do with him cuz he's not in our group there is no Camp right amen I got to bring this on home because as soon as he says Presbyterian whatever you think oh that's denominational troubles that can come right in here I I won't fellowship with this guy cuz he says this this this whatever more I don't agree with it that may be so but you don't cut them off amen that's amen amen amen there's one group and that's the body of Christ amen amen that's right amen amen what is fellowship what the leaves do make it cool when the birds fly under the leaves and cool off there's your tree again and he shall be like like a tree planted see all right where people can come and sit down under the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit cool off a little bit am mean you're all flustrated and don't know what's happening whether you'll die whether you're saved or not you don't know whether this church is right or that church right you comeing under the tree that's got some leaves on it and sit down there let the let the winds from Heaven go blowing like a Russian Mighty Wind Through the leaves you know and you begin to cool off a little but say say oh I'm going to go down and tell that bunch of Holy Rollers what I think just sit down a while and you'll cool off that's right you can't do it in yours cuz what's the matter the Locust have done eat it all off see eat off all the leaves might as well be sitting in the sun there ain't no cooling there all right but you know what we're supposed to do the Bible said the predestinated church the predestinated sons of God what would they do set in Heavenly places what is that coolness Comfort feel at home amen amen and he says now he also says in God's provide uh this is in God's providing healing for this generation in 1954 what's the matter with the church today the water supply is cut off because of our grumbling and doubting if you'll go into a desert you'll find that every Bush that you come up against still will perhaps have thorns and and stickers on it because it's raised in a dry land without water you take that same variety of bush and put it in a moisture land of moisture it'll be soft because it gets plenty of water and you take a church that's always fussing and stewing about this days of Miracles has passed just remember they're in a desert and out of the water and a church that's loving and humble and flexible and feels and goes with the word of God remember they're living by the fountain that never runs dry David said blessed is the man whose trust is in the Lord sth not in the seat of the scornful walketh not in the way of Sinners but his Delight is in the law of the Lord he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water see whatever he doeth it shall prosper his leaves shall will not fail he will bring forth his fruit in season amen amen so th this is what happens am I know it's a lot of negative but I trust you can see the positive amen amen as well so now there was and then he goes into the he says um and then also God identifying himself by his characterist characteristics in 64 so may the Lord water us tonight that we won't be stickers but we'll be fine leaves that waywood people might sit down under the tree of our shade and find rest to their souls I say Amen then he got into the bark which is the doctrine that's the next stage of The Bu and ate all the doctrine away and he substituted see the cankerworm got into the bark what did it do destroy the bark what did it do it made a natural church for a spiritual church amen so it made a instead of having a supernatural birth it just became a natural thing of of mentally agreeing to a list of that's right list of Doctrine that's that that is supplanting a spiritual for a natural amen the message has never really come to change your thinking only but it's come to change your heart amen that's what God has always wanted to do yes it took away the true and gave it a false now remember the leaf the fruit the Palm will eat the leaf the Locust eat now the bark covering the religion the doctrine the cankerworm got what what where did that first Doctrine come outside the Bible he says you historians know where it came from from Rome that's exactly where it started where they started accepting dogmas I mean that's how irus St Mar and polyup all them after John's death for translating the word of God he is out in the aisle of Patmos they burned him in Greece for 24 hours brought back and he still wrote the Bible God was determined that his Bible would be written amen and then the next and then the next stage is of course after you get into the bark you get into the sap line so you suck the life out of the tree amen now what's the caterpillar he's a sucker sucks the life the spirit the life that's what he does goes right down a hold of the pulk and goes to sucking caterpillar here he is who who are we going to call him denomination that's the guy's name right there why he's a destroyer sucks the life every time that God sends a move among his people every time and they denominate right there they die I want somebody that knows the history of the church that can condemn that show me one time that an organization ever organized that it didn't die right there that cankerworm got a hold of it took its religion away and then the sucker came along and sucked the life right out of the tree what kind of life was in it the Holy Spirit what did it do it couldn't hold the holy spirit in there and then still have dogmas the Holy Spirit wouldn't stand for it am mean so it take the take the life out of the tree and gives it Dogma makes a denomination we don't care what this says our denomination says this there you are remember after it denominates it always dies and never rises again amen but now there are four stages of the same bug that brought it down into the Dark Ages but there's also four messengers of life that were sent to restore back the tree okay so Luther started the restoration amen and it started to grow a bit more like Pentecost and then Wesley you know so Luther we know he brought that just shall live by faith that was his teaching and then Wesley received that because Wesley was actually he heard uh Luther's um Luther's writings on the book of Romans and it said he said he felt a warming in his heart he's actually birthed by the message of the former age it's in history amen and then Wesley brought sanctification and then of course Pentecost brought the restoration of the gifts but then the the word came the message came which is the final part of the restoration amen so it's four bugs because remember through Luther Wesley Pentecost and and the ministry of brother brandham it's the Holy Spirit doing all the same thing just like the four bugs that destroyed the tree it's all the same Antichrist Spirit just in different stages amen and this is the same as the fourth stage stes of ezekiel's dry bones all right and so the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones I'm going to I'm going to wrap this up soon so just just hold on now Ezekiel 37 it says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were uh very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I'll lay senu upon you and shall bring forth flesh upon you so sinu flesh and cover you with skin and put breath unto you through there four stages and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold it shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and then I heard though the senu and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them but there was no breath in them so there's no life in them right then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus say the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon the slaying and they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and they stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army amen so see it took it took the prophet to say you know to command the life to come into the people so the word that he released brought a life into them amen that's the say and then brother bam says he you know he goes to the scripture and the end of restoration of the bride bride tree he says I wish I had time and he and he mentions he says but prophesy son of man so what's happening now a prophet was upon the earth now this is this is not in the sky because you've got to look at your life and look at us as a body and it's around the world too I always want to emphasize that cuz we don't have anything special it's all around the world doesn't matter every Kindred nation and tongue God is dealing and it's not just here in this nation it's all over the nation you got to understand that too but you got to see now what is being produced amen there's there's there's love amen there's brotherly love there's the fruits of the spirit on display amen there's Divine Fellowship amen amen the truth of the word is being restored there's a holy spirit moving that's right Hallelujah do you not see these things happening Among Us amen amen and this is all because God placed a messenger in the age and he was commanded to speak the word that's right amen but Jesus said the words I speak to you they are spirit and they are life amen so there's a life that's connected with that word amen so when he when he when he's speaking it now there's a life of God followed those words and when they anchored into a heart of faith it produces what the word says it would produce Hallelujah so we're not just a bunch of dead corpses upon the Earth but we're a living people amen life Jesus Remember the last part of God's creation is when he actually made a body well well actually he created man as a spirit then he formed the body Out of the Dust of the earth then he breathed into him he became a living Soul Jesus comes to the end of his ministry and he breathes on them receed the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen and then our God has come down that was that was before Pentecost just before Pentecost is about to ascend then pour His Spirit out he comes down to the end of the ages are he following me he comes down to the end of the ages he puts a prophet upon the Earth amen he speak to the wind not talking about natural wind talking about the spirit of God he speaks a word that the spirit of God come and dwell in a people that's right Hallelujah some of you looking at me like what are you talking talking about you got to look at your life what is being produced what is the effect of having Messiah I mean what's the effect we're going to look at the effect Hallelujah and the effect is very simple what was there on Pentecost is back again amen the same life Hallelujah the same things being done the same fruit of the spirit being produced amen hallelujah hallelujah here we are hallelujah amen he said prophesy son of man and we just read that he said prophesy into the wind prophesy son of man he spoke the wind came into and he stood up as exceedingly great Army hello we are now we know Israel has a part to fulfill in that too but we are ezekiel's the church from from the Dark Ages to now amen that is ezekiel's dry bones amen hallelujah but we're not a bunch of dry bones drying lying in the valley anymore there's Life in The Believer and we stood up an exceedingly great Army amen God just little bitty old me yes you Hallelujah the believer is an ambassador for heaven hallelujah amen you like you take the Ambassador from the United States they walk in there like they own some countries they're not afraid I'm the ambassador to the United States whatever you know but they they don't go on their all timid cuz they know they've got a lot of weight that's right they got a lot of power behind them and the President says I give you this office and you can go execute what I say to do Hallelujah and here you are a bride of Christ God's given you an office amen he says now I I'll put my word in you you can execute what I say I want done hallelujah amen who have the musicians to come you got to no honestly I'll be pondering this who have the musicians come you got to you got to look this is what God is doing amen amen wear a brnch of fruit trees amen hallelujah the brid tree he preaches a sermon the restoration of the brid tree it's not just oh I'll find a you know a prophet when he declares things there's a reason he preaches things in a certain order amen he's not just thinking oh let's think of a cool sermon I can preach it will make the people happy he's declaring certain things amen and he says now is now the bride tree is restored Hallelujah and you happen to be manifesting I trust you are in your life you are living out you're living it out amen you could say we could say this day I trust I'm not too bold in saying it but this day this scripture is fulfilled amen amen because it says as you see Israel come forth and all the trees and many people they look at all there's there's National life people you you know they see the Fig Tree come forth Israel people's rights have come forth One World government's coming forth you know all these different things but they forget about the real tree that God is caring about amen because remember when when we come to opposite when the when the brid tree fully manifests and is taken off the Earth then the gospel's given to the Jews so it's just like brother brandham he's commissioned to take the two signs of healing to the world which would initiate the coming of Christ you know it would initiate the Rapture at the same time Israel says We're a nation we're an independent nation What's Happening Now Jews are coming to their position the trees is growing here comes a here comes a prophet messenger that knows the mind of God back parts of God's mind is I'm going to tell you what it is Christ The Mystery of God revealed and it's more than sermons a life is being released Hallelujah am to produce a people amen amen and here we are he says now it's harvest season he says the seed the grain is here amen amen he's talking about you he says because you know he said all the former moves of God they were moves of God but it's just the carrier of the life and then now it goes from a Carri now it comes to the very life that was planted amen he says you are the grain is here amen amen hallelujah and I trust you can look at yourself and say I'm grein Hallelujah I trust you can say God you've made me grain you can't be anything you you know a tear cannot make itself grain Hallelujah and a grain can't make itself a tear am Hallelujah it can't we can't make ourselves anything else I trust this mean something to you friends I mean you can look into the word say God you've made me this doesn't matter how I feel doesn't matter how happy I am am doesn't matter what is oppressing me or trying to depress me or destroy me I'm green hallelujah hallelujah here we are no we this is not proud if we brother BR said if the bride really knew what God really did she' be on her knees day night crying out saying thank you Jesus Hallelujah doesn't make you proud the devil doesn't want you to know who you are but God wants to know exactly who you are Hallelujah amen now brother Braham says he he he says it in a few places is totally off the side but he would people would come forward now in prayer you know for prayer and they'd give their lives and he says I present you as love gifts in the name of Jesus Christ and then he says I give you every one of them Father the trophies of the message their love gifts from God to his son now this is you this is you all right I give you every one of them Father trophies of the message their love gifts from God to his son Jesus Christ and no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come to me and I'll raise them up in the last days you promised it Christ I claim it for them I claim your word for them so he's saying that these people he says he says these are this is what this is how God looks at you and amen there's probably a whole other sermon but this is how God looks at you you're a love gift Hallelujah you're not just some shabby thing this is this is you know if I could put it we know there's only one God but you put it dramatizing here's the father what can I give my son I love my son he's the apple of my eye what can I give him give him a wife Hallelujah give him a part of himself that he'll love like I love him but even more so cuz they're part of each other hallah so searches the earth I mean he's looking for love gifts like you go you go to the shop you buy a gift for someone you're looking for something that they will really like Hallelujah so he searches the Earth doesn't matter what chop they're in where they're born what they look like H says down in them there's a love gift and he Broods over you lifts you up and says here you are here you are son Hallelujah I thought of you when I found them amen hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah that's what God thinks of you doesn't matter what any mortal man or whoever it is thinks of you that's what God says about you that's right Hallelujah that's why you've been drawn that's why you've been called am mean because no man can come to me unless my father draws him and there's been a pull Hallelujah more than just a religion God has been pulling why cuz he say I see a love gift I'm pulling my love gifts hallelujah hallelujah and that's who you are Hallelujah I'm very move friends but that's what that is what God is looking for he's not looking for a bunch of religious people some people that they can just have some kind of different life where's my love gifts I want those ones I love Hallelujah I want to embrace them lift them up into Glory bear their burdens with them walk with them hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen let's stand let's just give him praise can we amen I'm very aren't you thankful I mean we're not just a bunch of people hallelujah
