[2:36] um fill my way every day with
[2:39] love the Bible says be not overcome of
[2:43] evil but overcome evil with good amen a
[2:47] lot of times we get negative things
[2:48] happen to us and our natural man wants
[2:51] to react negatively back but that's not
[2:53] the way to do it you overcome evil with
[2:56] good you actually project love and
[2:59] project reject the opposite of what your
[3:00] natural man is telling you to do reject
[3:02] love in every situation and that defeats
[3:05] everything amen and if it doesn't the
[3:08] Lord sees it then he rewards you because
[3:10] that's what he said if you if you do
[3:12] good to those that don't do that he said
[3:13] you'll actually Heap coals of fire on
[3:14] their head and that there'll be a time
[3:16] when when they'll be accountable for
[3:17] that but our Our Calling is is to just
[3:20] project love amen on a daily basis to in
[3:22] every situation amen don't ever react
[3:25] negative towards anything okay let me

[19:57] morning amen amen praise the
[19:59] Lord um so uh as we all know um brother
[20:04] Aranda is our Sunday school
[20:06] superintendent so he's in he's in charge
[20:09] of of of all the Sunday school and I
[20:11] just thought I'd just make it official
[20:14] everyone knows what's going on you know
[20:17] um he really earned his stripes at the
[20:18] Youth Camp because we know it's more
[20:20] than just teaching kids it's really
[20:21] getting on their level and getting
[20:23] scratchy and you know becoming one of
[20:25] them and he did very well so yeah it was
[20:27] a real blessing see that so he did an
[20:28] excellent job so he's in charge just in
[20:31] case you're um just to go everything so
[20:34] so he's in charge of the entire Sunday
[20:35] school from the babies to the teenagers
[20:38] like the whole thing he's like the
[20:39] principal who's in charge of the entire
[20:41] school and so if any of the teachers
[20:43] can't make it I know we've already
[20:45] discussed this with the teachers but if
[20:46] any of the teachers can't make it uh
[20:48] he's it's it's his responsibility to to
[20:50] find a reliever so uh it's it's
[20:54] basically it's it's all his problem so
[20:56] so you know you y if you need if you
[20:59] need any material if you can't make it
[21:01] if you're sick contact brother arand
[21:03] he's a um he's in charge of that and
[21:06] it's also his responsibility to organize
[21:08] just say if s school takes a break over
[21:09] the school
[21:10] holidays it's it's it's his
[21:12] responsibility to to stop it and to
[21:14] start it again after the holidays and if
[21:17] any of the kids are acting up he's the
[21:20] he is the principal's office he's the
[21:21] mobile principal's office okay
[21:25] so yeah so so if any of the kids are
[21:28] acting up in class send them to arand
[21:31] and then and then if not then we get the
[21:33] parents involved then we bring in the
[21:35] big guns so remember it's all it's all
[21:37] his responsibility this is just a way
[21:39] that you know it's all on your shoulders
[21:42] and then if and then we have uh you know
[21:44] if we have any youth activities in the
[21:45] weekend or we're planning to go to any
[21:47] youth camps or anything of that it's
[21:48] brother aran's responsibility as well to
[21:51] to organize say days away or sleepovers
[21:54] or extra Bible STS or you know youth
[21:57] outings it's brother arman's
[21:58] responsibility so if you have any
[22:01] questions or comments or anything you'd
[22:02] like to raise about the Sunday School go
[22:05] see brother
[22:06] arand okay so don't um so this is the
[22:09] way that uh you know if there's any
[22:12] questions you have just see him you know
[22:14] because you see the principal in the
[22:15] school if you got questions so here's
[22:17] ours you know to to cover those things
[22:21] and then you said if any of the teachers
[22:23] you're wondering what direction to go
[22:25] for a
[22:26] topic see see brother arand as well so
[22:29] he's in control so that takes all the

[50:42] amen that was good wasn't it amen praise
[50:45] the Lord I you just thrilled me amen
[50:49] let's go to John chapter
[50:52] 1 and uh let's read we're just going to
[50:56] read
[50:57] from down to verse
[51:01] 14 in the
[51:04] beginning was the word and the Word was
[51:06] with God and the Word was God the same
[51:09] was in the beginning with God all things
[51:11] were made by him and without him was not
[51:14] anything made that was made in him was
[51:16] life and the life was the light of men
[51:19] and the light shineth in darkness and
[51:20] darkness comprehend it not there was a
[51:23] man sent from God whose name was John
[51:24] the same came for a witness to Bear a
[51:26] witness of the light that all men
[51:28] through him might believe he was not
[51:30] that light but was sent to Bear a
[51:31] witness of that light that was the True
[51:35] Light which lith every man that cometh
[51:37] into the world he was in the world and
[51:38] the world was made by him and the world
[51:41] knew him not he came unto his own his
[51:43] own received him not but as many as
[51:45] received him to them gave he power to
[51:47] become the sons of God even to them that
[51:49] believe on his name which are born not
[51:52] of blood nor the will of the flesh nor
[51:54] the will of man but of God and the Word
[51:57] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[52:00] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[52:02] only begotten of the father full of
[52:05] grace and truth amen may the Lord bless
[52:08] his word you may you may have your
[52:13] seats now I want to I want to continue
[52:17] from uh uh Easter Sunday there from
[52:20] Shadow to reality but I want to speak
[52:21] about the word becoming flesh now we
[52:24] understand that the Bible you know I
[52:26] just it's just so incredible you think
[52:27] about it the Bible uh you know this is
[52:31] this is God in print form this is God in
[52:34] print form but we understand that it it
[52:37] can't just stay in print form it has to
[52:38] put on flesh it to become a Living Word
[52:41] it has to become alive and and and we
[52:44] understand that God in his in his in his
[52:47] great being before there was anything he
[52:49] had attributes that he wanted to
[52:52] express and you know because it wasn't
[52:54] you know we we read in Revelations
[52:57] 13:8 it says and all that dwell upon the
[52:59] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[53:01] not written in the book of the life uh
[53:03] Book of Life of the Lamb slam from the
[53:06] foundation of the world so the lamb was
[53:08] slammed before the foundation of the
[53:09] world before there was any Mills
[53:11] anything the lamb was slaying but then
[53:13] you may you say well I just read that
[53:15] and I thought well why why wasn't it not
[53:18] just good enough to be slain before the
[53:20] foundation of world in God's mind before
[53:22] there's anything but it had to become
[53:23] flesh amen amen God has attributes I'm
[53:27] just going to read a few he's a Healer
[53:30] he's a redeemer he's a savior he's a
[53:34] Lord he's a king he's a priest he's a
[53:36] mediator he's a judge he's a husband
[53:38] he's a comforter he's a father he's a
[53:40] protector he's a Defender he's a
[53:42] provider he's a counselor and he's a
[53:44] sacrifice he and he's probably many more
[53:46] besides but he had all these attributes
[53:48] in him but he but he had to express them
[53:51] they had to become flesh his attributes
[53:53] had to become flesh in order to be be
[53:55] fully expressed it wasn't enough just to
[53:57] him to have all these things bottled up
[53:59] in him but he had to express them I mean
[54:02] it's just like a person like a great
[54:03] artist or something it's not enough for
[54:05] them just to have the gift in them they
[54:06] need to express that gift and it's like
[54:09] all of us whatever however God has made
[54:10] us it's not enough just to bottle it all
[54:12] up you got to express the gift that's in
[54:14] you amen it has to really put on flesh
[54:17] and so God we know God in the Old
[54:20] Testament you know you know like the
[54:22] brass serpent in the wilderness that was
[54:24] a divine that that that that God put
[54:27] there as brother John said the you know
[54:29] the the rock that was smitten and the
[54:31] water came out and the manner that fell
[54:33] from heaven all those things were
[54:34] displaying a part of God but that was
[54:36] just a Shad of it when the reality come
[54:38] was a very great was a much greater
[54:40] thing amen so those attributes had to
[54:44] put on flesh and you can even see where
[54:47] where Moses you know God because I'll
[54:50] just throw this out here and maybe
[54:51] forgive me if you think this is too far
[54:53] but you know you can understand all
[54:56] things but when you experience like like
[54:58] you can learn all about cars and you can
[55:01] know you can become an expert on on
[55:03] every the most intricate detail of a car
[55:05] but it's one thing to learn it or know
[55:08] it it's another thing to experience it
[55:10] so you can know all about driving cars
[55:12] and how they work and conditions and all
[55:13] these things but when you get behind the
[55:15] steering wheel and you and you put the
[55:17] key in and you turn it for the first
[55:19] time then you begin to experience what
[55:21] it's like to drive a car now God he
[55:24] knows all things he knows the end from
[55:25] the beginning he knew where you'd be
[55:27] sitting this morning he knew you'd be
[55:28] here he's not surprised you're here this
[55:30] morning and so God knows the end from
[55:32] the beginning but he had to experience
[55:35] what it was like to be a man in other
[55:37] words to to to fully understand us amen
[55:41] you you know you see in the Old
[55:43] Testament there's times where God got
[55:45] sick of his people you know you take you
[55:47] take when Moses is there with his you
[55:49] know with with Israel in the wilderness
[55:51] and God just tells Moses basically I'm
[55:53] sick of them I'm going to wipe them all
[55:54] off as start with you cuzz he cuz he
[55:57] hadn't he hadn't took on human
[55:59] infirmities yet and then Moses threw
[56:01] himself in the breach saying Lord blot
[56:03] me out of your book of life instead of
[56:06] them and we know that was Christ
[56:07] displaying himself in Moses but God God
[56:10] because he' never experienced what it
[56:11] was like to be a man he couldn't put
[56:13] himself in their shoes so he got sick of
[56:15] them amen but then now when he he he
[56:19] bore our infirmities he became one of us
[56:22] amen so he could fully understand what
[56:24] you got
[56:26] through he he understands what it's like
[56:28] to be rejected to be to be misunderstood
[56:31] you know he knows what it's like to be
[56:33] made fun of he knows what it's like to
[56:34] be misunderstood and and Cast Away and
[56:37] made fun of and rejected and you know he
[56:40] knows what it's like he knows what it's
[56:41] like to be hungry because he lived
[56:43] through it all he suffered every
[56:45] Temptation that we suffer amen he was
[56:48] tempted on all points but yet he didn't
[56:52] succumb to the Temptation he is yet
[56:53] without sin but but he didn't understand
[56:55] that being this great Supreme Being he
[56:57] had to come down and put on flesh so he
[56:59] could understand you so to be a to be a
[57:05] mediator Moses threw himself in the Gap
[57:07] in the Old Testament but now in the New
[57:09] Testament Jesus throws himself in the
[57:11] Gap that's right because he knows what
[57:13] it's like to be a
[57:14] man
[57:16] amen now so you know you know brother R
[57:20] makes a statement in Christ The Mystery
[57:21] of God revealed he says he says now
[57:27] uh the first thing God wanted to reveal
[57:29] himself to the people he couldn't do it
[57:32] as great Jehovah God who covered all
[57:34] space Time and Eternity he could not
[57:36] he's too great to ever be revealed to
[57:38] people because it would be too
[57:40] mysterious how could that great being
[57:43] that never did begin that after you went
[57:46] beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions
[57:49] and trillions and trillions of years of
[57:52] light space and go out into the infinite
[57:54] into to Eternity and a great creature
[57:57] that is all that and still is see how do
[58:00] you you can't even fathom that with a
[58:01] human mind how can you how can you
[58:04] understand eternity cuz we're in time
[58:06] things don't change you see the end from
[58:08] the beginning you know you're outside of
[58:09] this thing we're locked in called time
[58:11] this great big being no wonder he'd say
[58:13] it's too
[58:15] mysterious that's why you know so no no
[58:18] one could fully understand God in the
[58:21] Old Testament because he's still a
[58:23] mysterious being he was veiled with you
[58:26] know you know in the tabernac in the
[58:27] wilderness he was veiled in the prophets
[58:29] and all these different things and but
[58:31] yet people couldn't fully understand
[58:33] him but yet now but what he wanted to do
[58:38] he loved
[58:39] fatherhood for he was a father and the
[58:42] only way he could express it was to
[58:45] become a son of man that's the reason
[58:48] Jesus kept saying son of man see they
[58:51] didn't know what he was talking about
[58:53] many of them but now do you get it he
[58:55] wanted to express himself uh that was
[58:59] one of his three-fold purposes was to
[59:01] express himself identify himself with
[59:03] human beings to reveal himself in Christ
[59:06] and secondly to have preeminence in his
[59:08] body of Believers that is his bride that
[59:10] he might live in people so he wanted to
[59:13] express his fatherhood but he couldn't
[59:15] do it as this great big eternal spirit
[59:17] being he had to be he had to he had to
[59:20] that fatherhood had to put on flesh amen
[59:22] so he could fully understand what a real
[59:24] dad is like what a real Comfort it is
[59:26] like what a real Advocate a protector a
[59:29] Defender a provider all these things had
[59:31] to put on flesh all these attributes and
[59:33] now the word as I said the word had to
[59:37] has to be has to be veiled in flesh for
[59:39] it to live and we just read the
[59:41] scripture and the word that made all
[59:43] things that was God was with God and he
[59:44] was God made all things that word became
[59:47] flesh and dwelt Among Us amen and now I
[59:50] don't just want to put it back there on
[59:52] him because in reality the word has has
[59:54] to become flesh in you amen it's not
[59:57] just enough to quote the scripture know
[59:58] the scripture know the message and quote
[1:00:00] the message and it has to become flesh
[1:00:02] in you the scripture must live in people
[1:00:05] hallelujah amen but we understand that
[1:00:07] there's no you know there's no real
[1:00:10] battle you know the battle comes when
[1:00:13] the word becomes flesh amen yes and I'll
[1:00:17] just jump back you know there was a
[1:00:18] promise in the Old Testament one will
[1:00:20] chase a th000 two 10,000 that was a nice
[1:00:23] a nice posit POS scripture maybe someone
[1:00:25] would put up on Facebook but one day a
[1:00:28] man who had an ox go and he was sick of
[1:00:31] the Philistines taking his crops and his
[1:00:33] name was shamgar amen amen that that
[1:00:36] scripture became more than just a
[1:00:37] positive thing he posted on the internet
[1:00:39] it became a reality well he recognized
[1:00:42] why will chase a thousand and he
[1:00:43] recognized who he was amen and that word
[1:00:46] became flesh in him and he killed 600
[1:00:48] armed soldiers just with an ox go the
[1:00:50] word became flesh in him amen hallelujah
[1:00:53] Moses Moses not out for 400 years the
[1:00:55] promise that Abraham gave his
[1:00:57] descendants you're going to go into a
[1:00:59] Strange Land you're going to be in
[1:01:01] bondage and slavery for 400 years but
[1:01:03] I'm going to deliver you out with a
[1:01:04] mighty hand no doubt they would have sat
[1:01:06] round and they would have spoken about
[1:01:07] that scripture saying Al forbear Abraham
[1:01:10] promised us that we're going to go into
[1:01:12] the promised land even though we're
[1:01:13] slaves here but then when the season
[1:01:17] came where that was going to be put on
[1:01:19] flesh when the deliverer was going to
[1:01:21] come that's when a whole bunch of
[1:01:22] trouble begin to flare up started to
[1:01:24] kill the babies the Egyptians they
[1:01:26] started to do all kinds of things
[1:01:28] because that word was becoming flesh and
[1:01:30] a baby amen amen that deliverer was born
[1:01:32] it was more than just a nice idea it
[1:01:34] became a reality amen hallelujah amen
[1:01:37] and it's the same thing Jesus no you got
[1:01:40] to John the Baptist no doubt they you
[1:01:42] know they would have sat around in their
[1:01:44] synagogues and you know when Isaiah he
[1:01:47] Isaiah spoke things and it was about 800
[1:01:49] years later it became you know it became
[1:01:53] a reality he Pro prophesied a virgin
[1:01:55] shall conce amen amen he prophesied
[1:01:58] behold one crying in the wilderness to
[1:01:59] prepare the way of the Lord and no doubt
[1:02:01] they would have you know the rabbis and
[1:02:03] the chief priests they would have sat
[1:02:04] round and they would have discussed that
[1:02:06] scripture and they would have maybe put
[1:02:08] in their minds this is how it's going to
[1:02:09] work out maybe put it on a chart on the
[1:02:11] wall and you know maybe you know they
[1:02:13] would have discussed those things but
[1:02:15] before it became flesh there was no war
[1:02:19] there's no controversy there was no
[1:02:21] religious fight had broken out it was
[1:02:23] just all intellectual debate
[1:02:25] but then it became flesh amen and then
[1:02:28] and then things begin to be stirred up
[1:02:29] because the word must always the the
[1:02:32] battle is always when the word becomes
[1:02:34] flesh amen and so they would have no
[1:02:37] doubt read Malachi 3:1 behold I send my
[1:02:39] messenger before my face and he will
[1:02:41] prepare the way before me and whom you
[1:02:43] delight and even the angel of the
[1:02:44] Covenant shall suddenly come to his
[1:02:46] Temple they would have read that
[1:02:47] scripture they would have look forward
[1:02:49] it happening amen but then one day it
[1:02:51] happened amen and a man came out of the
[1:02:53] Wilderness saying repent for the kingdom
[1:02:55] of God was at hand and he didn't just do
[1:02:57] it out of just some good idea that
[1:02:59] scripture became a living reality to him
[1:03:02] we you you know we sung the song God
[1:03:04] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:03:06] pass God doesn't need no interpreter he
[1:03:08] just brings it to pass Hallelujah you
[1:03:09] see John the Baptist he didn't need to
[1:03:11] explain it he just preached amen he just
[1:03:13] did what he was called to do that
[1:03:15] scripture he lived out that word amen he
[1:03:17] lived out the portion of the word for
[1:03:19] his his life and then then there was a
[1:03:22] great big kafuffle going on
[1:03:25] then the religious War started to there
[1:03:27] was a battle going on Amen it went from
[1:03:30] a academic debate then it became a real
[1:03:33] battle and then this one you say well
[1:03:35] how how did it end up that way well you
[1:03:38] look what happened to John the Baptist a
[1:03:40] little girl dancing he got his head cut
[1:03:42] off he thrown into prison it sounds like
[1:03:45] there was a bit more than just an
[1:03:46] argument going on Amen but the word
[1:03:48] became flesh in him amen and then Jesus
[1:03:51] let's go to um you let's go to Luke chap
[1:03:54] CH
[1:03:55] 4 now I'm going to come to your address
[1:03:58] but I just I just trust you know this
[1:04:01] Bible if this isn't living in people am
[1:04:05] we're not here to just quote it and say
[1:04:07] isn't that lovely and isn't that
[1:04:09] wonderful this must put on flesh am amen
[1:04:12] and that's not being a fanatic that's a
[1:04:14] reality amen that's right it must put on
[1:04:17] flesh this word and the word became
[1:04:20] flesh and dwelt Among Us well if he is
[1:04:22] the word and he became flesh
[1:04:24] and we are we become one with him and
[1:04:27] and you read about in Ephesians great is
[1:04:28] the mystery concerning Christ in this
[1:04:30] church husband and wife becoming one if
[1:04:32] the bridegroom became the word became
[1:04:34] flesh then the then the bride will
[1:04:36] become flesh as well the word will
[1:04:38] become flesh in her am yes amen amen he
[1:04:41] following me hallelujah what am I saying
[1:04:43] Jesus must live in you amen he must
[1:04:46] become a living reality to you amen it's
[1:04:49] not enough just to quote it it must live
[1:04:53] now Luke chapter 4 and this is another
[1:04:56] prophecy of Isaiah and we'll go to we'll
[1:04:59] go to Luke
[1:05:01] 4:16 and now notice notice where the see
[1:05:04] see I'll show you here and he and he
[1:05:06] came to Nazareth speaking of Our Lord
[1:05:09] where he had been bought up and as his
[1:05:11] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[1:05:13] the Sabbath day and stood up forth to
[1:05:15] read so Jesus always went to church and
[1:05:17] there was delivered unto him the book of
[1:05:19] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[1:05:21] the book he found the place where it was
[1:05:23] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:05:25] me because he has a he has anointed me
[1:05:27] to preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:05:29] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:05:31] preach Deliverance of the captives and
[1:05:33] recovering of the sight of the blind to
[1:05:35] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:05:37] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:05:39] and if you go and read that in Isaiah he
[1:05:41] cuts that last scripture in half and he
[1:05:43] closed the book and he gave it again to
[1:05:45] the minister and sat down and the eyes
[1:05:47] of all them that were in the synagogue
[1:05:49] fasted on him and he be to say unto them
[1:05:51] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:05:54] your ears why it had become flesh and
[1:05:56] they all bear witness and wondered at
[1:05:58] the gracious Words which proceeded out
[1:06:00] of his mouth and they said is not this
[1:06:02] Joseph's son and he said unto them now
[1:06:06] notice where this goes they're sitting
[1:06:07] in church having a nice time and we're
[1:06:09] going to see where it goes and he said
[1:06:12] un him we will surely say unto me ye
[1:06:14] will surely say unto me this proverb
[1:06:16] phys physician heal thyself whatsoever
[1:06:20] we have heard that in capernium so also
[1:06:23] uh do also here in thy country he said
[1:06:25] verely I say unto you no Prophet is
[1:06:27] accepted in his own country but I tell
[1:06:29] you the truth many widows were in Israel
[1:06:31] in the days of Elias When Heaven Was
[1:06:33] Shut Up 3 years and 6 months when Great
[1:06:36] Famine was throughout all the land but
[1:06:39] unto none of them was Elias sent save
[1:06:42] unto uh uh s a city of sidon unto a
[1:06:47] woman that was a widow and many lepers
[1:06:49] were in Israel in the time of of of of
[1:06:53] Elias the prophet prophet and none of
[1:06:54] them was cleansed sorry that's Elisha
[1:06:56] the prophet none of them was cleansed
[1:06:58] save uh non the Syrian and all they in
[1:07:02] the synagogue when they heard these
[1:07:03] things were filled with what Joy
[1:07:08] wrath amen he following me and Rose up
[1:07:11] and thrust him out of the city and led
[1:07:13] him unto the brow of the Hill Ron their
[1:07:15] city was built that they might cast him
[1:07:17] down headlong but he passing through the
[1:07:20] midst of them went his way so you think
[1:07:24] he came to his own read the scripture
[1:07:26] his own received him not you would think
[1:07:28] he comes into the church and he begins
[1:07:29] to read the
[1:07:30] word you think they would have rejoiced
[1:07:33] the spirit of the Lord is upon me this
[1:07:35] day the scripture is fulfilled you think
[1:07:36] I said hallelujah our God's Vis is us
[1:07:40] you know he's visited us with a mighty
[1:07:42] visitation but where does it end up
[1:07:44] we're going to kill this
[1:07:46] man why that scripture had laid there
[1:07:49] 800 years it had laid there but now it
[1:07:51] finally put on flesh and when the word
[1:07:54] puts on flesh the religious world hates
[1:07:57] it who who who organized Jesus being it
[1:08:00] wasn't the Romans that crucified Jesus
[1:08:03] that was just a vehicle to get it done
[1:08:04] it was the churches in that day
[1:08:06] crucified him amen amen and it was the
[1:08:09] churches in that day who tried to kill
[1:08:12] him when he said this day the scriptures
[1:08:13] fulfilled you think they would have
[1:08:15] rejoiced we're going to be set free the
[1:08:19] Brokenhearted are going to be bound up
[1:08:20] you know you know those who are blind
[1:08:22] are going to be given their sight it's
[1:08:24] now the acceptable year of the
[1:08:26] Lord right but they are filled with
[1:08:29] wrath amen because now brother John said
[1:08:33] it history repeats itself speaking of
[1:08:36] Moses and then and then Christ history
[1:08:39] repeats
[1:08:40] itself and so we can't just look at this
[1:08:43] and say well that was that day and that
[1:08:44] was before the cross and now in the you
[1:08:46] know now we're this time of Grace and
[1:08:48] everything's different history repeats
[1:08:50] itself man man was that way there and
[1:08:54] he's still the same today yes you know
[1:08:57] both the devil and God take their people
[1:09:00] but they return the same spirit that was
[1:09:02] on them back am mean Jesus was taken
[1:09:05] Judas was
[1:09:07] taken Jesus sent his Spirit back upon
[1:09:10] the earth and the Antichrist spirit and
[1:09:12] Judas came back upon the Earth John said
[1:09:14] there's many Antichrist
[1:09:16] already amen so there's a there was a
[1:09:21] war I trust I trust this really you know
[1:09:24] you know sing it's when the word becomes
[1:09:27] flesh not when it's just talked about
[1:09:30] not when it's just well what do you
[1:09:31] think about that it's when it becomes
[1:09:33] flesh is when the battle really happens
[1:09:38] amen so it goes beyond just you know it
[1:09:40] goes beyond a debate you see it and then
[1:09:43] and then we can go maybe I'll just go
[1:09:45] through this very quickly but but then
[1:09:46] we go to Acts chapter to and then that
[1:09:49] same God who is in Jesus because he says
[1:09:53] it's not me that doeth the works as my
[1:09:55] father dwelleth in me doeth the works so
[1:09:58] he is saying I don't do this it's the
[1:10:00] father that dwells in me he does the
[1:10:02] works and then he says and then he says
[1:10:05] that same spirit will come and dwell in
[1:10:07] you so now then you have to I trust if
[1:10:10] God really dwells in you I trust you can
[1:10:12] say well it's actually him doing the
[1:10:14] works it's not me living it's him living
[1:10:18] amen where your natural man would
[1:10:20] probably in times past would have gone a
[1:10:22] certain way you begin to react a very
[1:10:24] different way to things and you I trust
[1:10:26] you can look and say that's him doing
[1:10:27] the works that's him
[1:10:29] living and so on the day of
[1:10:32] pente Peter you know they come out you
[1:10:34] know the spirit of God comes and dwells
[1:10:35] in them and everyone outside says they
[1:10:38] they're acting like a bunch of drunk
[1:10:39] people and then Peter stands up and says
[1:10:42] we're not drunk as you suppose it's just
[1:10:44] being the third hour of the day but this
[1:10:46] is that spoken by the prophet
[1:10:48] Joel and and so that prophecy in Joel
[1:10:52] I'm just going to basically repeat
[1:10:53] myself with different situations but
[1:10:55] it's all the same thing see the word
[1:10:57] became flesh in the upper room amen
[1:11:00] those 120 there that were you know they
[1:11:02] had walked with the Messiah they had
[1:11:04] seen him done many great things they
[1:11:06] knew he was the Christ but that wasn't
[1:11:08] enough Amen to recognize him in this day
[1:11:11] is not enough you must become one with
[1:11:13] him amen amen he must come and dwell in
[1:11:15] you so it wasn't just enough for them to
[1:11:17] walk with Jesus Jesus had to come and
[1:11:19] dwell in them yes and that he would live
[1:11:21] his same life would now live out of them
[1:11:23] so they were in the upper room and
[1:11:25] they're
[1:11:25] waiting then finally when the day of
[1:11:27] Pentecost had fully come he came and
[1:11:29] dwelt in them and then they begin to
[1:11:31] rejoice and then they begin to quote
[1:11:34] Peter said this is this day he could
[1:11:36] have stop and said this day Joel chapter
[1:11:38] 2 is fulfilled this day this scripture
[1:11:41] is fulfilled because he quotes it that
[1:11:43] I'll in the last days I'll pour my
[1:11:45] spirit out upon All Flesh he says what
[1:11:48] you have just witnessed here and what we
[1:11:50] are doing is that scripture being
[1:11:52] fulfilled
[1:11:54] amen now did did did did all the people
[1:11:59] Rejoice did the Sanhedrin Rejoice did
[1:12:02] the church
[1:12:03] Rejoice what' they do drag them before
[1:12:06] the Sanhedrin threaten them beat them
[1:12:09] killed them eventually some of them amen
[1:12:12] why is that because the word became
[1:12:14] flesh the word became flesh in this and
[1:12:17] that's and you know you read like like
[1:12:20] Luke
[1:12:21] 4 where were you know I might be getting
[1:12:24] it around the wrong way but there's
[1:12:25] there's many times where they wanted to
[1:12:27] kill Jesus and Luke for was one of them
[1:12:30] where were the
[1:12:31] disciples when this was all going on I
[1:12:34] would think they were with
[1:12:36] him but there's no record of them trying
[1:12:38] to kill the disciples at that time why
[1:12:41] is that because the word wasn't fleshing
[1:12:43] them yet that's right amen Satan doesn't
[1:12:46] care how much how religious you think
[1:12:48] you are he doesn't care how much of the
[1:12:50] Bible you think you know he doesn't care
[1:12:52] how much of the message you you think
[1:12:53] you know he's not afraid of that it
[1:12:56] doesn't he he doesn't care about that
[1:12:58] but it's when that life comes in amen
[1:13:01] when the one when the Eternal God comes
[1:13:04] and dwells in flesh that's when things
[1:13:06] begin to get Rocky hallelujah amen he
[1:13:09] doesn't care about people claiming the
[1:13:11] cross but when the power of the Cross
[1:13:13] comes into someone's life many people
[1:13:15] claim the blood but there's no power in
[1:13:17] their and their
[1:13:19] confession amen and now I'm not looking
[1:13:21] down on those people this is just a day
[1:13:23] and age we live in we can't just talk
[1:13:26] about Easter we can't just talk about
[1:13:29] Jesus dying you know you know I might
[1:13:31] get the story wrong but you know my you
[1:13:33] know Christine is is witnessing to one
[1:13:35] of the preschool teachers she's a
[1:13:38] seek and she said to she said to
[1:13:42] Christine that other Christians have
[1:13:44] just told her that Christianity is
[1:13:46] basically you do something wrong and
[1:13:47] then you confess it then you keep
[1:13:48] walking on and there's no change in the
[1:13:51] life you just keep living on that's not
[1:13:53] the gospel that's not the gospel the
[1:13:56] gospel is you repent you confess it and
[1:13:59] then the life that's in him comes into
[1:14:01] you and changes your nature that you
[1:14:03] don't do those things anymore it's a
[1:14:05] supernatural nature change by God he
[1:14:08] comes and lives in you that's
[1:14:10] Christianity isn't it amen because it
[1:14:13] says in in
[1:14:16] Hebrews
[1:14:18] now if I can find it he says in Hebrews
[1:14:22] that a worship
[1:14:24] ER he says for the law having a shadow
[1:14:27] of good things to come and not the very
[1:14:29] image of the things that can never uh
[1:14:31] can never with those sacrifices this is
[1:14:33] Hebrews 10:1 never with those sacrifices
[1:14:35] which they offered year by year
[1:14:37] continually make the comers their un too
[1:14:40] perfect so what does that mean whatever
[1:14:42] caused them to bring the lamb they left
[1:14:44] with that same desire because the blood
[1:14:47] of bulls and goats could not change the
[1:14:48] nature of the person that caused them to
[1:14:49] bring the sacrifice in the first place
[1:14:52] for then would they have not uh for then
[1:14:56] would they not have ceased to be offered
[1:14:59] because that the worshippers once purged
[1:15:01] should have had no more
[1:15:04] consciousness of sins so he's saying why
[1:15:08] were they offered every year continually
[1:15:09] because the very sacrifice couldn't
[1:15:12] change the people but that was in the
[1:15:14] Old Testament but under the under the
[1:15:16] blood of the New Covenant amen that
[1:15:19] blood that was shed can change you that
[1:15:21] life that's in in in him comes to you
[1:15:24] and changes you amen hallelujah that's
[1:15:27] right and so now they were so that life
[1:15:29] was in was the fullness of God had bodly
[1:15:32] dwelt in Jesus Christ and they hated him
[1:15:36] they hated him the devil hates the life
[1:15:39] that's right amen the devil doesn't care
[1:15:42] about anything else it's when the life
[1:15:43] comes in that's right that's when the
[1:15:46] devil really changes guns and that's why
[1:15:48] the disciples with Jesus they didn't try
[1:15:50] and kill him they didn't try and push
[1:15:51] him push push them off the cliff it was
[1:15:53] Jesus but then in the book of Acts what
[1:15:56] happens God comes into them they get
[1:15:58] beaten some of them get killed they get
[1:16:00] thrown into jail they get threatened
[1:16:02] don't ever preach in his name anymore
[1:16:04] why cuz the devil's trying to Snuff out
[1:16:06] the lifee yes amen and it's the same
[1:16:09] thing today all the devil wants to do is
[1:16:12] snuff out the life that the life of God
[1:16:14] is Not on display
[1:16:16] anymore or how thankful we are that God
[1:16:19] is alive amen amen and now
[1:16:23] let's go to John chapter
[1:16:26] 14 I want to read
[1:16:35] this John 14 and ver8 I think we read a
[1:16:38] bit of this before but just just notice
[1:16:41] this yeah the word interprets itself as
[1:16:44] I because you you may think well how can
[1:16:46] you say Jesus will come and dwell in
[1:16:48] them what about the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:16:50] Ghost and Jesus are the same the spirit
[1:16:53] of God is the Holy Ghost which is Jesus
[1:16:56] and spirit
[1:16:58] form because when Paul met the Lord on
[1:17:01] the road to Damascus what did the pillar
[1:17:03] of fire who did he say his name was
[1:17:05] Jesus I'm Jesus whom th persecutest amen
[1:17:08] amen Philip saith unto him Lord Charles
[1:17:10] the father and it suffices us Jesus
[1:17:13] saith unto him have I been so long with
[1:17:16] you and yet thou Hast not known me
[1:17:19] Phillip he that ha seen me has seen the
[1:17:22] father and th sayith then Charles the
[1:17:24] father believeth thou not that I am in
[1:17:26] the father and the father in me the
[1:17:29] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[1:17:31] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:17:34] in me he doeth The Works believe me that
[1:17:37] I am in the father and the father in me
[1:17:39] or else believe me for the very work
[1:17:43] sake verely verely I say unto you he
[1:17:45] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:17:47] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:17:50] the shall he do because I go unto my
[1:17:52] father and whatsoever you ask in my name
[1:17:56] that will I do that the father may be
[1:17:58] glorified in the son if ye shall ask
[1:18:01] anything in my name I'll do it if you
[1:18:04] love me keep my Commandments and I'll
[1:18:06] pray the father and he'll give you
[1:18:08] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:18:10] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[1:18:13] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:18:15] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[1:18:17] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[1:18:20] shall be in you I will not leave you
[1:18:23] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:18:25] little while the world seeth me no more
[1:18:27] but ye see me because I live ye shall
[1:18:30] live also and that day you shall know
[1:18:33] that I in my father and ye in me and I
[1:18:35] in you he that hath my Commandments and
[1:18:38] keepeth them he is it that loveth me and
[1:18:41] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:18:43] father and I'll love him and will
[1:18:45] manifest myself to him amen amen so he's
[1:18:49] saying I'm going to be in you I'm not
[1:18:51] just going to be with you I'm going to
[1:18:52] be in you amen the very works that I do
[1:18:54] you shall do also amen amen amen that's
[1:18:58] what he's promising
[1:19:01] now if God is in you I because I was
[1:19:04] maybe you know you maybe I spoke about
[1:19:06] this before but I was thinking last
[1:19:07] night what is it to say God is in
[1:19:10] me amen oh I have the Holy Ghost a lot
[1:19:14] of people say they have the Holy Ghost
[1:19:16] but what is it really mean to really
[1:19:17] have the Holy Ghost amen amen cuz the
[1:19:20] vast majority of Christians would say
[1:19:23] either that they have the Holy Ghost or
[1:19:25] the Holy Ghost Works in their life in
[1:19:26] some way yes amen but what is it really
[1:19:29] to have the real genuine Holy Ghost amen
[1:19:32] because if there was a promise if if if
[1:19:36] it has been promised to people then it's
[1:19:39] not just empty words that God's just put
[1:19:41] on paper to make us feel a bit better it
[1:19:42] has to be a reality amen amen amen it's
[1:19:45] either this is either true or it's not
[1:19:47] true if it's not true let's quit and do
[1:19:49] something else but if it is true we
[1:19:51] should give everything we have to it
[1:19:52] amen cuz it's Eternal things amen so if
[1:19:56] God is in you the very creator of
[1:19:58] heavens and earth is in you amen yes the
[1:20:02] very one who spoke the world into
[1:20:04] existence comes and dwells in
[1:20:06] you brother Braham says from the
[1:20:08] everpresent water from The Rock in 1961
[1:20:11] he says and the power that'll raise us
[1:20:13] up is right in us now we are now in
[1:20:17] Heavenly places we are now in the power
[1:20:20] of the
[1:20:21] Resurrection if there was wasn't a law
[1:20:23] to that remember his word is governed
[1:20:25] his power is governed by a law if there
[1:20:28] wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters
[1:20:31] of God would create in them a world I
[1:20:33] mean would create them a world out there
[1:20:36] and go live a private life on
[1:20:38] it you have power in you to do it who
[1:20:42] believes that if you have God in you you
[1:20:44] have the power to speak a world into
[1:20:46] existence and go and live on
[1:20:48] it amen oh no that's not true yeah it is
[1:20:52] is he all powerful that he make all
[1:20:55] things and he says I'll be with you even
[1:20:57] in you amen therefore you have power in
[1:21:00] you to create a world and go live on
[1:21:04] it you have the power in you to do it
[1:21:07] and he says if you've got a shadow of
[1:21:10] the power of God on you you've got power
[1:21:13] to do it if you've got a shadow I don't
[1:21:16] feel like I got a lot of faith I don't
[1:21:17] feel like you know I'm really maybe
[1:21:20] walking the way I should be walking if
[1:21:21] you've got a shadow
[1:21:23] remember it's not remember God is not
[1:21:25] you have to get onto this plane the
[1:21:27] spiritual plane you got to reach like a
[1:21:29] what they call a Buddhism like a Nana
[1:21:31] State and then you have visitations of
[1:21:33] angels then God comes down then he
[1:21:35] speaks you live to we it's not that way
[1:21:38] amen God comes to the meek and lowly God
[1:21:41] comes to the Wayward God comes to the
[1:21:43] Lost God comes to the confused amen God
[1:21:47] comes to the blind religiously blind
[1:21:48] people God comes to the indifferent he's
[1:21:52] that's the kind of people God comes to
[1:21:54] amen God comes to the failures God comes
[1:21:57] to the one hiped in sin God comes to the
[1:21:59] one that are in bondage and speaks to
[1:22:01] them and ministers to them hallelujah
[1:22:04] hallelujah that's how go because he says
[1:22:06] for sheep all gone astray Isaiah 53 he
[1:22:09] doesn't say we're all sheep perfectly
[1:22:10] walking in line and being a perfect
[1:22:12] sheep we've all gone
[1:22:15] astray how who does that Encompass all
[1:22:17] of
[1:22:18] humanity we've all gone astray you say
[1:22:21] but but I'm sheep I'm a Believer we've
[1:22:24] all gone
[1:22:25] astray but as long as you're a sheep as
[1:22:29] long as you're a sheep that's the
[1:22:30] difference yeah
[1:22:33] amen if you're a sheep God will go after
[1:22:36] you amen if you're a sheep God is going
[1:22:39] to get you amen it's like I think of you
[1:22:42] know maybe this is probably not a good
[1:22:43] joke but you know they say the Apache
[1:22:46] helicopter they say if you try and run
[1:22:49] from it if you're fighting against it
[1:22:50] you just die tired yeah cuz it'll just
[1:22:53] find you the missiles and stuff will
[1:22:54] find you same thing with God if you run
[1:22:57] you just die tired you might as well die
[1:22:59] not tired just just Just Surrender
[1:23:01] yourself but if you run you're going to
[1:23:03] die tired amen so what's the point of
[1:23:06] running that's right what's the point of
[1:23:09] running Hallelujah so God now we have
[1:23:13] the power you have the power now this is
[1:23:15] not the power of positive thinking it's
[1:23:16] a reality if if the very God of heavens
[1:23:19] and earth comes and dwells in you then
[1:23:21] you have the power in you to create a
[1:23:23] world and go live on it amen amen so
[1:23:26] there's because there's power there's
[1:23:28] life and death in the power of the
[1:23:29] tongue amen amen so whatever you are led
[1:23:33] to believe for believe it's yours amen
[1:23:37] don't limit God in what you think he can
[1:23:38] do you know it's nice you say you know
[1:23:41] you know you can look into the prophet's
[1:23:43] and you can say well it would be neat to
[1:23:44] speak squirrels into existence it' be
[1:23:47] neat to speak life back to a dead fish
[1:23:49] or it' be neat to speak life back to
[1:23:51] someone who's died in the you know you
[1:23:53] know died in the congregation or or a
[1:23:56] dead baby that's been brought to him or
[1:23:58] you be need to speak a storm out of
[1:23:59] existence or you know those things but
[1:24:02] we don't need squirrels to be created
[1:24:05] that's right amen we don't need those
[1:24:06] kind of things but we need life to be
[1:24:08] spoken amen we need life to be spoken
[1:24:12] amen but the thing is don't just put it
[1:24:13] off on well maybe someone else can do
[1:24:15] that what about you remember the word
[1:24:18] has to be put in flesh it's not enough
[1:24:19] for your mom and dad for God to dwell in
[1:24:21] them it's not enough for the word to
[1:24:23] become flesh and someone you know he's
[1:24:25] got to dwell in you he wants to use
[1:24:28] you amen he wants to use you for his
[1:24:32] work and so we shouldn't be afraid you
[1:24:36] know well how do I pray for something
[1:24:38] you get neutral you get neutral and then
[1:24:41] you pray because if you pray with your
[1:24:44] own Ambitions you know the scripture
[1:24:45] even says he'll give you the desires of
[1:24:47] your heart you got to be real careful
[1:24:50] balum the desire of balam's heart was
[1:24:52] wealth and God get yeah go I I already
[1:24:56] told you not to but he allowed him to go
[1:24:59] amen and many people they pray for
[1:25:01] things but it's out the desire of their
[1:25:03] heart they're not neutral and God says
[1:25:05] there you go there's a
[1:25:07] boundary amen and God will allow you to
[1:25:11] cross that boundary y amen and you may
[1:25:14] have to go down some big valleys and a
[1:25:16] lot of flames and deep water and things
[1:25:19] but he'll allow you to go that way amen
[1:25:23] that's why when you pray you got to be
[1:25:26] neutral in in in everything no matter
[1:25:29] how big or small amen and then he will
[1:25:33] come upon the scene and then it won't be
[1:25:35] you asking it'll be him in you speaking
[1:25:39] what you need amen hallelujah praise God
[1:25:45] now the scripture tells us in 2
[1:25:47] Corinthians 3 he says but we all with it
[1:25:51] sorry but we all with an open face
[1:25:53] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:25:56] Lord I changed into the same image from
[1:25:58] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[1:26:01] the Lord so we're beholding him now he's
[1:26:03] the word amen remember the word becoming
[1:26:06] flesh as we read there it wasn't just
[1:26:09] you know it wasn't just words on paper
[1:26:12] it's a living being living being became
[1:26:15] flesh that same one led the children of
[1:26:17] Israel into the promised land the same
[1:26:19] one came and spoke to Gideon and all the
[1:26:21] different ones down through through the
[1:26:22] same one Isaiah saw high and lifted up
[1:26:25] and said W is me amen he's a living
[1:26:28] being and then he became flesh and so
[1:26:31] that same one that same so so we are
[1:26:35] beholding a living I trust God is not an
[1:26:37] imagination to you but he's a living
[1:26:39] person that speaks to you you speak back
[1:26:41] to him he guides your steps he counsels
[1:26:44] you he shows you your things he likes
[1:26:46] things he doesn't like he convicts you
[1:26:48] of sin when you're wrong amen he says no
[1:26:51] to sometimes when you pray hey yes and
[1:26:53] or no I'm happy with no if my life was
[1:26:57] full of NOS I'd say thank you Lord cuz
[1:26:59] at least I'm getting an answer amen amen
[1:27:02] oh I want a yes no I just want an answer
[1:27:04] I don't care what it is not my will but
[1:27:07] thy will be done amen amen isn't that
[1:27:10] what Jesus said so we're beholding a
[1:27:13] living
[1:27:13] being and as we Behold Him we are we are
[1:27:17] changed into the same image from glory
[1:27:20] to glory so we become we become
[1:27:24] him amen amen what's an what's an image
[1:27:29] an image is made out of something amen
[1:27:32] so like you like madam what was it Madam
[1:27:35] tau's wa you you wax museum that's right
[1:27:38] that's a whole bunch of images made
[1:27:40] right you know of real
[1:27:42] people and so it says now that we are
[1:27:46] changed into the same image from glory
[1:27:49] to glory so we are changed and that word
[1:27:52] change is where we get the word
[1:27:53] metamorphosis from means to transform
[1:27:56] that we
[1:27:57] are we are transformed or we we are
[1:28:01] under a metamorphosis process like a
[1:28:03] caterpillar that turns into a butterfly
[1:28:06] they're undergoing a metamorphosis they
[1:28:08] are being transformed from one thing
[1:28:10] into another thing and it's the same
[1:28:13] thing with the believer you're right now
[1:28:15] being transformed amen I mean from from
[1:28:18] what you once were you're being
[1:28:20] transformed into the very image of the
[1:28:21] living God Amen now I don't think that's
[1:28:24] too strong I just read it in the
[1:28:26] scripture this is Paul taken up with him
[1:28:27] one day amen he says we're being
[1:28:31] transformed into that same
[1:28:34] image and so you have to look at
[1:28:37] now well what was he he was the word
[1:28:40] made flesh a living being the Eternal
[1:28:42] one put on
[1:28:44] flesh and so that has to happen in you
[1:28:47] it happened in the book of Acts Church
[1:28:49] you look at them they were you know the
[1:28:53] same Holy Ghost fell there Falls
[1:28:55] today I've experienced it so I know the
[1:28:58] same God he's he hasn't changed in 2,000
[1:29:01] years he's revealed himself he's put on
[1:29:03] flesh again he still fills people with
[1:29:05] the Holy Ghost like he did then amen how
[1:29:09] can he be the same yesterday today and
[1:29:11] forever if he changes and now it's just
[1:29:14] a social group there's not a social
[1:29:16] group it's it's people that God has
[1:29:18] filled and people that God has drawn to
[1:29:20] himself
[1:29:22] and then so
[1:29:23] now yes they
[1:29:27] didn't you
[1:29:28] know they didn't worry they didn't go
[1:29:32] live the same life that they did before
[1:29:35] the upper room they didn't go back they
[1:29:38] didn't go back they never went fishing
[1:29:40] again there's nothing wrong with fishing
[1:29:42] but they never went fishing again amen
[1:29:44] Peter James and John they never took up
[1:29:46] their Nets again the woman at the well
[1:29:48] never went back to her old life again
[1:29:50] those 120 they never went back to their
[1:29:52] old life they were different something
[1:29:54] had really happened to them that's right
[1:29:56] you know they never worried well I don't
[1:29:58] want to lose my social standing with the
[1:30:00] Joneses who cares about the Joneses if
[1:30:03] you really care about the Joneses you'll
[1:30:05] meet God and you want them to meet God
[1:30:07] if you really care about them yes amen
[1:30:10] we we youo we're not called to match oh
[1:30:14] I want to be in this bracket of society
[1:30:16] I'd rather be in God's bracket of
[1:30:17] society that doesn't mean you become a
[1:30:19] monk and live someplace on a hill you
[1:30:22] know we live everyday life but you don't
[1:30:24] want to be caught up in well what does
[1:30:26] this person think of me what does that
[1:30:27] person think of me amen amen amen that's
[1:30:31] all I'm worried about well they may kick
[1:30:33] me out he got kicked out he understands
[1:30:37] no one understands being rejected he
[1:30:39] sure understands what it's like to be
[1:30:41] rejected he was rejected far more than
[1:30:43] we could ever be rejected he was judged
[1:30:46] you know I found people I found
[1:30:48] Christian people now I don't have an ex
[1:30:50] to grind but this is just you know don't
[1:30:52] get me wrong but the only persecution
[1:30:54] I've ever received is from other
[1:30:56] Christians people who have no faith they
[1:30:58] just say that's great you go on you you
[1:31:00] know if you're happy that's fine but
[1:31:02] other Christians I say they got filled
[1:31:05] they get filled with wrath they get
[1:31:07] angry amen yep why is that God say the
[1:31:10] wood become flesh yes and there's a
[1:31:13] persecution going on right so
[1:31:17] now so the
[1:31:20] word is putting on flesh in the
[1:31:22] believer's
[1:31:24] life now but there so so the word has to
[1:31:27] be lived out as I said the lamb was
[1:31:29] slamed before the foundation of the
[1:31:30] world then that had to happen the lamb
[1:31:33] had to become flesh and
[1:31:35] die in order to redeem us back to where
[1:31:38] we you you know you know back to God he
[1:31:40] had to shed his blood physically in time
[1:31:43] in order in order for us to really know
[1:31:45] him as Redeemer it wasn't just enough
[1:31:47] for God to have it in his mind it had to
[1:31:49] put on flesh but there's parts of the
[1:31:51] the word that you would never want to
[1:31:53] live
[1:31:54] out
[1:31:56] amen you never want to be like pilate he
[1:32:00] says behold the man and tries to wash
[1:32:03] his hands of the blood of Jesus and and
[1:32:05] gives them to the Mob but you can't the
[1:32:07] only way you get the blood of Christ off
[1:32:08] your hands is get it in your heart you
[1:32:11] don't ever want to be the scribes or
[1:32:12] Pharisees hey they were they were
[1:32:14] playing out a role everyone in life is
[1:32:16] playing out some kind of role and so
[1:32:19] it's not always the Believers that that
[1:32:21] that the word becomes flesh and there's
[1:32:23] others that the word becomes flesh and
[1:32:25] are you following me you see you see
[1:32:27] balum you see the you know you know you
[1:32:29] see the king of Moab and you see Pharaoh
[1:32:31] they were playing out a role Egypt was
[1:32:34] playing out a role they didn't really
[1:32:35] fully understand what they're doing
[1:32:37] genes and jambre they playing out of
[1:32:39] role Cain was was was living out a role
[1:32:42] the word was becoming flesh in him but
[1:32:44] not I'm talking about God God wasn't
[1:32:46] becoming flesh him but part of the word
[1:32:48] was I mean because there's always the
[1:32:50] good and the bad
[1:32:52] Esau played out a
[1:32:54] role he didn't fully grasp what was
[1:32:56] going on but he knew he just needed food
[1:32:58] more than some Birthright that he
[1:32:59] couldn't
[1:33:00] understand
[1:33:02] amen so you never want to be like the
[1:33:04] scribes and Pharisees you say that was
[1:33:06] back 200 years ago we're modern now man
[1:33:09] is still the same amen I guarantee you
[1:33:12] the same attitude that they had then if
[1:33:14] they were transported into this day all
[1:33:16] they do is have websites and different
[1:33:18] kinds of other things and podcasts and
[1:33:20] YouTube channels and they'd be saying
[1:33:22] the same thing they said back
[1:33:24] there amen they'd be doing exactly
[1:33:26] because history repeats itself and what
[1:33:29] heaven back there happens again so we
[1:33:32] don't want to be the scribes and
[1:33:35] Pharisees because they so they are the
[1:33:38] denominations because scribes Pharisees
[1:33:40] they believe different things herodians
[1:33:42] believe different things amen one
[1:33:44] believed in angels in a re um um in a
[1:33:46] resurrection the others didn't I think
[1:33:48] the Sadducees didn't believe in a
[1:33:50] resurrection you read about the book of
[1:33:51] Acts they had their own list of beliefs
[1:33:53] what is that a
[1:33:55] denomination so they rejected the very
[1:33:57] God that they claiming to be worshiping
[1:33:59] you don't want to be Judas Judas was
[1:34:01] playing a role
[1:34:04] amen and then you never want to be the
[1:34:06] crowd saying crucify him cuz they're
[1:34:08] playing a role too amen we don't you say
[1:34:11] well that was then how do you you can't
[1:34:14] crucify a spirit you can crucify his
[1:34:17] word you can kill how do you what is
[1:34:20] murder murder is not just physically
[1:34:22] killing someone you can murder someone's
[1:34:24] influence and that's same as murdering
[1:34:27] them amen that is that is Premed people
[1:34:30] go out and try and murder someone's
[1:34:31] influence that is premeditated murder
[1:34:34] because they're murdering now that
[1:34:35] person has no influence anymore yes
[1:34:37] their their whole life is white you know
[1:34:39] tarnished now that reputation that's
[1:34:41] just been fabricated you shall not bear
[1:34:43] false Witnesses yes the law says does it
[1:34:47] not so you know people's lives are
[1:34:49] tarnished that reputation sticks on them
[1:34:52] even though it's not true and what
[1:34:54] happens that person has been murdered
[1:34:56] what do you think it happens with
[1:34:57] politicians they try and get some dirt
[1:34:59] on them then they blasted across the
[1:35:01] world that person has to resign or go to
[1:35:03] jail or whatever happens now if they do
[1:35:05] something wrong sure they got to pay for
[1:35:06] it but what's happened that person has
[1:35:08] found something that that person did and
[1:35:11] has actually murdered
[1:35:13] them now I'm not saying that that person
[1:35:16] was not wrong you understand but what's
[1:35:18] happened these people have actually gone
[1:35:19] out how can we destroy this person yes I
[1:35:21] can't go kill him cuz that's I'll I'll
[1:35:23] end up in jail but I can I can actually
[1:35:25] murder his influence murder his
[1:35:26] reputation that's just as good that's
[1:35:29] killing them so we never want to be that
[1:35:32] crowd you say well that was back then
[1:35:35] Peter said that scoffers would rise in
[1:35:37] the last day saying where's the promise
[1:35:39] of his coming someone has to live out
[1:35:41] that role you don't want to be part of
[1:35:43] that
[1:35:45] role Now history repeats itself now
[1:35:50] maybe I'm I'm just going to try and
[1:35:52] but there's but there's other things
[1:35:55] there's other parts that people had no
[1:35:56] idea really what they were
[1:35:58] doing there was a Joseph of
[1:36:01] arthea he built a tomb in a garden and
[1:36:06] no doubt he thought one day I'm going to
[1:36:08] be buried there and my children and
[1:36:10] things can come and come to my grave and
[1:36:12] put down flowers and all these things
[1:36:14] but when but when he was having that
[1:36:17] built he was actually fulfilling the
[1:36:19] word but he had no idea what he was
[1:36:21] really doing amen because it says in
[1:36:24] Isaiah 53 that he'll be buried with the
[1:36:26] rich and he was a rich man he was
[1:36:28] playing a role amen he was actually
[1:36:31] allowing the word to become flesh
[1:36:33] because that scripture had to be
[1:36:35] fulfilled and then so he built the tomb
[1:36:37] and then something in him because he was
[1:36:39] a secret believer it says in the Bible
[1:36:42] because of fear of the Jews you didn't
[1:36:43] you know openly say he believed in Jesus
[1:36:46] Christ and then so when Jesus was dead
[1:36:48] on the cross he went to pilate say can I
[1:36:50] please have the body of Jesus and then
[1:36:52] he found out he was dead he said yeah
[1:36:54] sure you can you know you can have him
[1:36:56] and then so he put He put Jesus in his
[1:36:59] own tomb that he had made Hallelujah he
[1:37:03] was he was fulfilling the word amen the
[1:37:06] word I'd say became flesh in him because
[1:37:09] he orchestrated that all to happen you
[1:37:11] say well I may not have you say I don't
[1:37:13] have a tomb but you've got a body amen
[1:37:16] amen you've got hands and feet you've
[1:37:18] got a mind and no doubt you thought well
[1:37:21] I'm going to use this hey Joseph R
[1:37:24] thought he's going to be buried there
[1:37:26] but Jesus didn't have to own it to him
[1:37:28] he just had to borrow a to cuz he wasn't
[1:37:31] going to stay there too long and it's
[1:37:33] the same thing with you and I you know
[1:37:35] we have these bodies we have this life
[1:37:37] and he wants to borrow your life he
[1:37:40] wants to borrow your body amen and maybe
[1:37:42] just for one instance or maybe six
[1:37:44] months like John the Baptist but as long
[1:37:46] as you're living out his part of the
[1:37:48] word that he wants you to do amen amen
[1:37:51] he wants you you
[1:37:53] say you say no that's that's just too
[1:37:56] arbitrary no it's not he wants to dwell
[1:37:59] in
[1:38:00] people I've heard this too much no don't
[1:38:02] don't don't diminish if God lives in you
[1:38:06] then you're not your own there's a
[1:38:09] definite difference between a
[1:38:10] Spirit-filled believer and a notp filled
[1:38:12] believer amen amen I'm not saying that
[1:38:15] the unfilled ones not sincere but
[1:38:18] there's a big difference if youve
[1:38:20] received the Holy ghost you can't think
[1:38:22] like you did before you met him amen
[1:38:25] amen there's something in you that just
[1:38:27] doesn't sit good if you even contemplate
[1:38:29] well maybe I should do this something in
[1:38:31] you just says no amen I do not want to
[1:38:34] and it's not and that's him that's him
[1:38:37] governing your life oh no you train
[1:38:40] people to be that way no you don't it's
[1:38:42] not a training it's a
[1:38:44] filling amen things things you once
[1:38:46] loved there's something in you that
[1:38:48] doesn't love them
[1:38:49] anymore am amen amen why what's happened
[1:38:53] the words become flesh the life of God
[1:38:56] has come into you and you're being
[1:39:00] transformed this is a reality amen the
[1:39:03] very God Of Heaven can come and dwell in
[1:39:05] you because of what he's done not
[1:39:08] because of what you think you can do
[1:39:09] it's because of what he's
[1:39:12] done
[1:39:14] hallelujah Joseph had a tomb you say
[1:39:18] well but the word became flesh in Jesus
[1:39:21] it has to become flesh in you amen where
[1:39:24] you can be a comforter amen you can be a
[1:39:28] guide you can bring
[1:39:30] healing healing healing comes in music
[1:39:33] it comes in you know it comes through
[1:39:36] prayer it comes through medicine it
[1:39:38] comes through sometimes someone just
[1:39:40] getting alongside you and merry heart
[1:39:42] doeth good like a medicine the scripture
[1:39:44] tells us and that's true depressed
[1:39:46] stressed people are more far more likely
[1:39:48] to get cancer than happy people why cuz
[1:39:51] because a merry heart doeth good like a
[1:39:53] medicine amen you can be you can be a
[1:39:58] protector or a Defender those things
[1:40:01] want to be those attributes must put on
[1:40:04] flesh Amen in you amen well I only you
[1:40:10] know I want to do my own thing no just
[1:40:12] borrow just let them borrow you and
[1:40:15] maybe for 10 years 10 minutes 60 years
[1:40:17] however long but he wants to borrow you
[1:40:21] wants to live through you amen
[1:40:24] amen we have
[1:40:27] to he wants to live in
[1:40:29] people amen now I'm just going to try
[1:40:32] and wrap this
[1:40:33] up there was never a battle I'll say
[1:40:37] this there was an never battle when
[1:40:40] people would go to Revelations chapter
[1:40:42] 10 and they would speak about a mighty
[1:40:44] angel coming down with an open book that
[1:40:47] never caused any
[1:40:48] controversy until a man would stand
[1:40:50] stand up and say I was there I had a
[1:40:53] vision of seven angels
[1:40:55] coming on a mountain and you know you
[1:40:58] know you know an Arizona Mount Sunset
[1:41:00] and then he said as it
[1:41:01] happened and there's the photograph of
[1:41:03] the cloud and all these things and then
[1:41:05] not only that but he goes back to his
[1:41:06] church and he preaches the true
[1:41:08] interpretation of the revelation of the
[1:41:10] Seven
[1:41:11] Seals and then and then now a big war
[1:41:14] breaks out because that scripture became
[1:41:16] flesh and then now there's never a there
[1:41:19] was never a big cont
[1:41:22] where where people would read Malachi
[1:41:24] and the churches used to look for an
[1:41:26] Elijah coming to restore the word as
[1:41:28] spoken of in scripture the Assemblies of
[1:41:30] God the Pentecostal churches say where
[1:41:32] is our Elijah they used to look for
[1:41:35] him and then now someone stands up and
[1:41:38] says if you can't believe me believe the
[1:41:40] works for they testify of me of the
[1:41:43] supernatural God there is no
[1:41:45] peer yeah the prophet of God he wasn't
[1:41:48] there was no equal you know speaking of
[1:41:50] his min Ministry things happen in you
[1:41:53] you know in that ministry didn't happen
[1:41:55] in any other totally different and the
[1:41:58] word became flesh that part of the word
[1:42:01] became flesh in him and that's when the
[1:42:03] big battle begin to fight is this okay
[1:42:07] you understand and then now people stand
[1:42:09] up and they receive the same God that he
[1:42:12] spoke about and you can hear about on
[1:42:14] tape comes and lives in them amen this
[1:42:18] this becomes a living reality to a
[1:42:19] people it becomes a Love Letter it's not
[1:42:22] stories it's not just a code of ethics
[1:42:24] it becomes a living reality and the god
[1:42:27] of the Bible becomes alive to them and
[1:42:30] then they begin to stand up and now they
[1:42:33] be they begin to recognize because
[1:42:35] there's prophecy there's word that has
[1:42:37] to be fulfilled where the scripture says
[1:42:39] and we'll go to let's go to Ephesians
[1:42:41] chapter
[1:42:44] 5 I just trust you'd go home and Ponder
[1:42:47] these things amen think upon these
[1:42:49] things
[1:42:56] now let's go to verse 30 Hebrews chapter
[1:42:59] 5 uh sorry Ephesians chapter
[1:43:01] 5 because the book of
[1:43:04] Ephesians Paul is prophesying of things
[1:43:07] as well we know Paul he was a prophet
[1:43:10] was he not he was an apostle but he was
[1:43:12] also a prophet because he prophesied a
[1:43:13] lot of things
[1:43:15] amen and then
[1:43:18] now let's just go to verse 28 so ought
[1:43:22] men to love their wives as their own
[1:43:24] bodies that he loveth his wife loveth
[1:43:27] himself for no man ever yet hateth his
[1:43:31] own flesh but nourishes and cherisheth
[1:43:33] it even as the Lord the
[1:43:36] church for we are members of his body of
[1:43:38] his flesh and of his bones for this
[1:43:40] cause shall a man leave his father and
[1:43:43] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[1:43:46] and the two shall be one flesh this is a
[1:43:48] great mystery but I speak concerning
[1:43:51] Christ and the
[1:43:52] church nevertheless let every one of you
[1:43:55] in particular so Lover's wife even of
[1:43:57] himself and the wife see that she
[1:43:59] reverence her husband so he's not just
[1:44:02] speaking about just marriage now but he
[1:44:04] said this is how it should be because if
[1:44:06] God is in you men and woman if God is in
[1:44:10] the husband what did Christ do he came
[1:44:13] to where we were and he lifted us up to
[1:44:17] make us joint ears with him isn't that
[1:44:19] what the scripture tells us then so if
[1:44:21] that has to be put on flesh in men amen
[1:44:25] amen it has to be put on flesh so if
[1:44:27] Christ is in you then that act of
[1:44:29] redemption that he did for us will be
[1:44:32] lived out of you and your whole being
[1:44:35] and now when I think of this I say help
[1:44:36] me Lord but your whole being will be to
[1:44:38] that one purpose and everything you do
[1:44:41] if it's going to work if it's going on
[1:44:44] holiday it's how your house is your
[1:44:46] whole being will be Redemption that I'll
[1:44:49] I'll create an atmosphere in my home
[1:44:51] I'll speak and treat my wife a certain
[1:44:52] way I'll treat my kids a certain way
[1:44:54] that they'll become joint ears amen
[1:44:57] hallelujah they'll become joiners with
[1:44:59] me in Christ amen that'll be that'll be
[1:45:02] a husband's that's a husband's Focus I
[1:45:04] trust it is that's not getting a new car
[1:45:06] or a bigger house all those things are
[1:45:08] good and well but the main thing should
[1:45:10] be I want them I don't want them to be
[1:45:13] down here somewhere I don't want my
[1:45:15] family to be downtrodden and walking on
[1:45:17] eggshells I want to lift them up HJ Amen
[1:45:21] to be a joint ear because that's what
[1:45:23] that's what Christ did for us we are
[1:45:25] joint ears with Christ the scripture
[1:45:26] tells us what does that mean equal level
[1:45:29] amen he is the head sure but we're not
[1:45:33] downtrodden we're joint ears amen amen
[1:45:37] that's if that's if Christ is in you and
[1:45:40] then if Christ is in the wives now what
[1:45:42] do we want to do we want to lift him up
[1:45:46] that he can express himself in our lives
[1:45:49] and have free course not because of
[1:45:51] rules but because we love him because
[1:45:53] we're in a love
[1:45:54] relationship amen and so the wives will
[1:45:57] do the same thing you
[1:46:00] see
[1:46:02] amen it'll just
[1:46:04] happen it's not necessar the things you
[1:46:06] say things you
[1:46:08] do amen but words are important too amen
[1:46:11] amen amen but I trust I trust that's
[1:46:14] your that should be your focus I want my
[1:46:17] kids see I want my girls to love the
[1:46:19] Lord like I do and to know him like I do
[1:46:21] am that's what I want for them amen amen
[1:46:24] I'll support them in anything that you
[1:46:25] know if they want a you know career and
[1:46:27] all these different things sure but I
[1:46:30] want that the main thing that is the
[1:46:32] main thing that they would love him and
[1:46:34] know him like I do and if they do that I
[1:46:38] can say I've done I've done my job and
[1:46:40] all is well no matter where they go on
[1:46:43] life as long as they fall in love with
[1:46:45] him and he becomes their all in all like
[1:46:48] he is me then then amen I can
[1:46:52] relax
[1:46:53] amen hallelujah but he's saying here
[1:46:57] this is a great mystery concerning
[1:46:59] Christ and the church so they become
[1:47:02] one amen so if he is the word then we
[1:47:07] become the
[1:47:09] word
[1:47:11] and so this is not a an arbitrary thing
[1:47:15] as I said if God dwelt in him and the
[1:47:17] fullness God B dwelt in him then he'll
[1:47:19] come and dwell in you
[1:47:20] and he will change your nature to be
[1:47:23] like his
[1:47:24] nature because Peter says that we're
[1:47:28] let's go to Peter
[1:47:30] actually I'm going to read
[1:47:32] this and then I don't know what time it
[1:47:34] really is but um you know early this
[1:47:38] morning I accidentally put our clock for
[1:47:40] it an hour and then Christine said no no
[1:47:42] no it's back but of course it wasn't my
[1:47:44] cell phone so it would have been fine
[1:47:45] but yeah
[1:47:48] anyway but there's a
[1:47:51] second Peter verse you chapter 1 it
[1:47:54] speaks of the Statue of a perfect man
[1:47:57] yeah it talks about the stature of a
[1:47:59] mature believer that we're growing up
[1:48:02] into yes yeah remember it's actually the
[1:48:06] spirit of God comes and dwells in you
[1:48:08] and then he matures those attributes
[1:48:10] into you amen but the foundation is
[1:48:13] always Faith you must
[1:48:15] believe but there's also so this
[1:48:18] scripture that Peter's talking about
[1:48:19] here of a statue a perfect man he is
[1:48:22] actually speaking he that's actually a
[1:48:24] prophecy he says people are going to
[1:48:25] become
[1:48:26] this it's not just a nice idea people
[1:48:29] are literally going to live this out
[1:48:32] where they have the faith and The Virtue
[1:48:33] and the knowledge and the temperance and
[1:48:35] the godliness and the brotherly kindness
[1:48:36] and the Divine love it'll actually be
[1:48:38] put in flesh into people I trust you can
[1:48:41] say Lord I'm going to be one of them
[1:48:43] because of what you're doing in my life
[1:48:45] amen amen but there's also in Proverbs
[1:48:49] and we'll just go read it
[1:48:50] there's actually the statue of the
[1:48:52] imperfect
[1:48:54] man okay so we go to Proverbs Chapter
[1:48:59] 6 and then with this all
[1:49:12] close Proverbs Chapter 6 and 16 to
[1:49:18] 19 and then we'll go to
[1:49:20] um Proverbs 26 to see what the headstone
[1:49:23] of this is so Proverbs 6 and
[1:49:27] 16-19 these six
[1:49:30] things do the Lord hate yay seven are an
[1:49:34] Abomination unto him a proud look a
[1:49:38] lying tongue and hands that shed
[1:49:40] innocent blood a heart that devises
[1:49:43] Wicked
[1:49:44] imaginations feet that be Swift and
[1:49:47] running to Mischief a false witness
[1:49:50] that speaketh lies and he that Seth
[1:49:54] Discord among
[1:49:56] Brethren okay and then we'll go to
[1:49:58] Proverbs chapter
[1:50:06] 26 and 24 to
[1:50:14] 28 he that hateth dissemble with his
[1:50:18] lips and layeth up de seat within him
[1:50:21] when he speaketh
[1:50:23] fear believe him not for there are seven
[1:50:27] Abominations in his heart we just read
[1:50:28] about them who so whose hatred is
[1:50:32] covered by deceit his wickedness shall
[1:50:35] be showed before the whole
[1:50:40] congregation who so dith a pit shall
[1:50:42] fall therein and he that roll a stone it
[1:50:44] will return upon him a lying tongue
[1:50:47] hateth those that are afflicted by it
[1:50:50] and a flatter a flattering mouth worketh
[1:50:53] ruin so you can actually parallel those
[1:50:55] two together and the Capstone of this
[1:50:57] one is actually hatred instead of divine
[1:51:00] love I'll say this it says before the
[1:51:03] whole congregation these are religious
[1:51:06] people y amen remember Judas he was
[1:51:10] among the
[1:51:11] people
[1:51:13] yeah we don't want this to be built up
[1:51:15] in
[1:51:16] US amen this word people you say well
[1:51:20] that's just Proverbs it's still the word
[1:51:22] of God you know all the word all
[1:51:26] scriptures inspired For What doctrine
[1:51:28] Repro correction edifying and all these
[1:51:30] different it's what so it's not well
[1:51:32] this is the Proverbs this is the law is
[1:51:33] just history and this is what Jesus said
[1:51:35] so we'll take it above the book of Acts
[1:51:36] and all these things it's all the word
[1:51:38] of God yes amen amen so there'll be a
[1:51:42] people and maybe if we have some
[1:51:43] musicians come there'll be a people that
[1:51:46] will actually put this will actually
[1:51:48] embody these virtues of
[1:51:51] hatred just as a just as there will be a
[1:51:54] people that will be built up into the
[1:51:56] statue of the perfect
[1:51:57] man
[1:51:59] amen you say
[1:52:02] well how do
[1:52:04] we your choice your choice dictates
[1:52:09] which one you're going to
[1:52:10] be amen because God is a gentleman and
[1:52:14] he doesn't Force anything upon you he
[1:52:17] gives you a
[1:52:18] choice y
[1:52:21] there Comes A Time in life with anything
[1:52:23] you can be faced with a great
[1:52:25] situation and there's actually a moment
[1:52:27] before you can actually get angry and
[1:52:28] lose it but then you can choose actually
[1:52:31] to lose your temper and get mad yeah
[1:52:34] it's your choice and so if you say and
[1:52:38] then so with these things what do you
[1:52:40] want to become now you can't do it in
[1:52:43] your own strength but what do you yield
[1:52:45] yourself
[1:52:46] to because man people upon this Earth
[1:52:49] they reflect either of Two
[1:52:52] Worlds you see people you know what do
[1:52:54] we near get hit by that guy in the car
[1:52:56] or something I know just crazy driver on
[1:52:58] the street but he you know you know you
[1:52:59] know his uh his car was all like lowered
[1:53:03] you know they look like some rappers off

[1:53:24] colleagues who's who's moved on to
[1:53:25] another job she says I read these things
[1:53:27] I just want to buy stuff why because
[1:53:29] there all these ads and you know because
[1:53:31] it's materialism being pushed and then
[1:53:33] people will read those things while they
[1:53:35] begin to gossip and talk about other
[1:53:36] people why because they're feeding off
[1:53:38] these things and they become what they
[1:53:41] read amen and it's the same with people
[1:53:43] who idolize some star or someone they
