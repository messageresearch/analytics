[41:10] up my love my fear one and come away FL
[41:13] the winter has passed the rain is over
[41:15] and gone the flowers appear on the earth
[41:17] the time of the singing of birds has
[41:19] come and the voice of the turtle which
[41:21] is the turtle dos heard in our land the
[41:23] Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs
[41:25] and the vines with The Grapes give a
[41:27] good smell Arise My Love my fear one and

[41:44] chapter
[41:45] 12 and um we're just going to
[41:47] read we're going to read from
[41:50] verse
[41:52] um we're going to read from verse 11
[41:56] and we're going to read down to verse uh
[42:04] 24 I'm just kind of jumping in through
[42:06] this thought of of the Lord chastening
[42:07] his children but it says now no
[42:09] chastening for the present seeth to be
[42:11] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[42:13] afterwards it yith the Peaceable fruit
[42:15] of righteousness unto them which are
[42:17] exercised thereby wherefore lift up the
[42:19] hands which hang down in the feeble
[42:21] knees uh and make and make straight
[42:24] paths for your feet least that which is
[42:27] lame be turned out of the way but let it
[42:29] rather be healed follow peace with all
[42:32] men in Holiness without which no man
[42:34] shall see the Lord looking diligently Le
[42:37] any man fail of the grace of God lest
[42:39] any root of business springing up
[42:40] trouble you and whereby many be defiled
[42:44] least there be any fornicator or profane
[42:46] person as Esau who for one morsel of
[42:48] meat sold his Birthright for ye know how
[42:52] that afterwards when he had inherited
[42:54] the blessing he was rejected for he
[42:55] found no peace uh place of repentance
[42:58] though he sought it carefully with tears
[43:01] for ye are not come
[43:02] unto uh the mount which might be touched
[43:05] that burned with fire nor unto Blackness
[43:07] and darkness and Tempest and the sound
[43:10] of a trumpet and the voice of Words
[43:12] which voice uh they that heard and
[43:14] treated that the word should not be
[43:16] spoken to them anymore for they could
[43:18] not endure that which was commanded so
[43:20] as so if as much as a beast touch the
[43:22] mountain it shall be stoned or thrust
[43:25] through with a dart and so terrible was
[43:27] the sight that Moses said I exceedingly
[43:28] fear and Quake but ye have come but ye
[43:32] have come unto Mount Zion unto the city
[43:34] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[43:36] and to an innumerable company of angels
[43:39] to the general assembly and Church of
[43:40] the firstborn which are written in
[43:42] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[43:44] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[43:47] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[43:49] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[43:51] that speaketh better things than that of
[43:53] Abel amen may the Lord bless his word
[43:55] you may be be
[43:59] seated now I want to um I want to
[44:02] continue I've been we've been looking
[44:03] into the Song of Solomon Chapter 2 for
[44:06] for uh quite a few weeks now and we you
[44:09] know just a just a recap very briefly
[44:11] you know we see that uh when when when
[44:14] the Beloved speaks to uh you know so so
[44:18] when the bridegroom speaks to the bride
[44:20] and he says Rise up my love my fair one
[44:22] come away we see that there's a season
[44:25] there's a change in the season when he
[44:27] actually says now rise up and come away
[44:29] and and this is you see the winter is
[44:32] passed and now Springtime the rain is
[44:34] and the rain is gone the flowers appear
[44:36] on the earth sorry can you turn me down
[44:38] a little bit the flowers appear on the
[44:40] earth the time of singing has come and
[44:41] the voice of the turtle is heard in our
[44:43] land and the Fig Tree putteth forth her
[44:45] green figs and the vine the tender
[44:47] grapes uh which give a good smell so we
[44:51] understand Jesus would would would be
[44:52] asked three questions by his disciples
[44:54] you know when shall the temple be
[44:56] destroyed when is these things going to
[44:57] happen and when is the end of the world
[44:59] and and and Jesus answered those three
[45:01] things in Matthew 24 and 25 and and he
[45:04] said when you see the viig Tre put forth
[45:06] her buds you know that summer is not
[45:07] even at the doors and that generation
[45:09] shall not pass to all things be
[45:11] fulfilled so he begin to say when you
[45:13] see this fig tree put forth then we
[45:15] understand that in Prophecy the Fig Tree
[45:17] or figs uh in Prophecy is Israel because
[45:20] you read Jeremiah 24 and Jeremiah sees
[45:23] two baskets of figs one good and one bad
[45:26] and and God gives the interpretation of
[45:29] those two baskets and it's one part of
[45:30] Israel I mean they'll both be taken into
[45:33] captivity but the good figs are those of
[45:35] Israel that will come back into the land
[45:37] but the bad figs will just be scattered
[45:39] and will never return so in the Bible
[45:41] that we know the figs uh speak of speak
[45:43] of Israel so he says when the so the Fig
[45:46] Tree put forth the green figs and the
[45:48] vines uh unto the tender grape and they
[45:51] give a good smell so he's saying now
[45:53] when you see the Fig Tree put forth that
[45:55] that is when I'm going to say Arise My
[45:57] Love My Fair one and come away and we're
[45:59] living in that day we've heard a voice
[46:02] we've heard the voice of the bridegroom
[46:03] in this hour that's actually said rise
[46:06] rise up my love my fair one and come
[46:08] away and and we can see that that God
[46:11] has raised up his children above the
[46:13] things of the world Amen Once Upon a
[46:16] Time you uh you thought that you this is
[46:18] where you're from and this is where you
[46:20] lived and your your culture governed how
[46:22] you thought and you know everything was
[46:24] now and then and dolls sense and what
[46:26] you see and but then God came your way
[46:29] one day and you begin to realize that
[46:31] you know there's more to this life than
[46:33] just this life you know some people you
[46:36] know some people think that we're just
[46:38] energy yeah and then and then everything
[46:40] is just energy and then when you die you
[46:42] know you just go back into what this
[46:44] energy is then you may come forth as a
[46:46] tree or a bug or whatever next time cuz
[46:48] you're Just Energy but that is but that
[46:51] is quite frankly that's quite ridiculous
[46:53] because if we were just energy why are
[46:55] we not like all the rest of the animals
[46:58] you know you see like the you know like
[47:00] the gorilla or the even the chimpanzee
[47:02] 99.9% the same DNA as you but yet they
[47:06] build their nests and then they have
[47:08] children and then their children build
[47:09] the same kind of nests and then their
[47:11] children have the same kind of N and you
[47:12] know but man you know we go back a
[47:15] hundred years we didn't have these kind
[47:16] of Technologies you man is always
[47:18] improving itself there's a very
[47:20] different you know we are a very
[47:22] different kind of being it's because we
[47:24] have a soul amen I mean the chimpanzee
[47:26] doesn't have a soul or you know whatever
[47:29] you know even even like a salmon you
[47:32] know I was I was I was looking to this
[47:34] and you know
[47:35] salmon they they they they spawn in a
[47:38] river they go out to seea and then they
[47:41] and they can spend about seven years in
[47:43] in the ocean but yet the vast majority
[47:46] of them will come back to the same river
[47:48] they will spawned in and then they and
[47:51] then they'll spawn then they'll die then
[47:53] the hatchlings are Hatch and they'll go
[47:54] out to sea 7 years later they come back
[47:57] again and the cycle just keeps repeating
[47:59] itself that's just animal life amen
[48:02] we're not energy friends there's more to
[48:05] this world and I'm sure that's why
[48:06] you're sitting here today cuz you've
[48:08] realized there's more to this world
[48:10] there's more to this life than just this
[48:11] life we're not just a vapor that just
[48:13] disappears that's right amen when we're
[48:16] done so we have risen God God has caused
[48:21] you to rise above the things of the
[48:22] world am mean you you and maybe your
[48:25] who's not even a believer or maybe even
[48:27] just a nominal Church person you may
[48:30] face the same situation but you will
[48:32] look at it very different to the other
[48:33] person I mean cuz you've recognized that
[48:36] God's in control and not only that God
[48:38] is in control but he's ordained your
[48:40] steps and he's trying to mold you in a
[48:42] certain way and show you a certain thing
[48:44] just like job was on the ash sheep and
[48:46] after job was off the as sheep he
[48:48] realized I know my redeemer lives amen
[48:51] amen the trials of Life are meant to
[48:53] drive you towards God not drive you away
[48:55] from God that's why job could just stand
[48:58] there he didn't understand it you know
[49:00] God didn't come down to job and say well
[49:02] job the reason this is all going is
[49:04] because I had a Satan came up before me
[49:06] and I pointed you out to Satan he didn't
[49:08] point you out I pointed you out and I
[49:10] said you're a perfect man and then he
[49:12] laid down the challenge and I'm not
[49:13] afraid of a challenge so I said
[49:15] challenge except the devil he never
[49:17] explained it to him amen but yet all job
[49:20] job could just stand flat footed in his
[49:22] trial he didn't understand it he wasn't
[49:24] really that happy about it
[49:26] but yet God allowed all that to happen
[49:28] that he would say now I know my redeemer
[49:31] lives and in this flesh I shall see God
[49:33] and I will stand him on that day upon
[49:35] the Earth he didn't know those things
[49:37] before but afterwards he knew exactly
[49:40] who God was he said I've heard of thee
[49:42] but now I see thee he used to sacrifice
[49:45] a lamb he was he he did what God God
[49:48] commanded him to do but yet he didn't
[49:49] know God hallelujah but then he met the
[49:52] one he was sacrificing to got to be more
[49:55] than stories friends this word is not a
[49:58] story book this message is not just a
[50:00] bunch of tapes it's a living God
[50:02] revealed and he's not back in 1965 he's
[50:05] right here in
[50:07] 2016 amen he's a present help him time
[50:09] of trouble that's what the scripture
[50:11] tells me Hallelujah so now we have risen
[50:15] above and as as the bride Rises Satan is
[50:18] cast down Hallelujah because we are
[50:21] ascending to our rightful position in
[50:24] Christ and now to the so now Paul in the
[50:27] book of Hebrews if you read the book of
[50:29] Hebrews you know he's writing obviously
[50:31] to Hebrews he's writing to Jewish
[50:32] Believers that have come out of Judaism
[50:35] but he is but they have they have come
[50:37] out of Judaism but he's now calling them
[50:40] he always he's always admonishing them
[50:42] let us go on to Perfection you know let
[50:44] us go on you know he's always calling
[50:46] drawing trying to call them to a higher
[50:48] walk with God and you would think that
[50:51] they would not really need to be
[50:52] admonished this way because what they
[50:55] even had then was greater with than what
[50:57] they had under the law but Paul was
[50:59] constantly trying to tell them what you
[51:01] have is greater amen what you have is
[51:04] more what you have is more powerful what
[51:06] you have is greater you know it wasn't
[51:08] blood every year by a high priest that
[51:10] was a man now you have a living high
[51:12] priest an eternal high priest Jesus
[51:14] Christ and by one offering he Sanctified
[51:17] them forever which are you know mean
[51:19] perfected them forever which are
[51:20] Sanctified so he was he was saying what
[51:22] you have is greater now you can go into
[51:24] the holy of H H before you could never
[51:26] go into the presence of God like that am
[51:29] me he was admonishing them what you have
[51:30] is greater what you have is more and he
[51:34] did this because he had to show them now
[51:36] this is because you know it's like the
[51:39] simple illustration if a dog has a bone
[51:42] and you've got a fresh bone you don't
[51:44] take away the the bone he's chewing on
[51:46] just give him the fresh one and then
[51:48] he'll forget the old bone then you can
[51:50] take it away so they had to show them
[51:52] you have more now you just have to step
[51:54] into what God has done for you amen so
[51:57] he was consciously telling them that it
[52:00] was better the law he says he was
[52:03] contrasting in Hebrews what they had
[52:05] under the blood of bulls and goats the
[52:08] the levitical priesthood the outward
[52:10] Conformity the to the law was not as
[52:13] good it was inferior to what they had
[52:16] under the blood of Jesus Christ under
[52:18] grace he contrast everything to show
[52:21] that they have greater than what they
[52:22] did and now
[52:25] this this you think is obvious back then
[52:28] but now but we've come to another time
[52:31] where we are not living under a
[52:33] denominational understanding anymore
[52:35] we're not living under denominational
[52:36] age anymore but now God has revealed
[52:39] because the message reveals Christ in
[52:41] the scripture amen so now God had to
[52:44] come and he has pointed us back to the
[52:46] true word of God and he's trying to tell
[52:49] us now in this end time that God has
[52:52] restored the truth and power of His word
[52:55] amen so that as church has advanced
[52:57] Beyond Believers just living the same
[53:00] old life and every time they do
[53:02] something wrong they just say forgive me
[53:04] Jesus because that's what unfortunately
[53:06] the denominational world has reduced to
[53:08] that people just accept some kind of
[53:10] mental idea they say a sin is prayer but
[53:13] there's no change in their life and they
[53:15] live the same all kind of life but then
[53:17] they just say prayer Lord forgive me and
[53:19] then they just walk on but that is not
[53:21] what the blood of Jesus Christ does to a
[53:23] Believer amen amen so there must be a
[53:26] contrast and there is a contrast we must
[53:29] understand that the blood of Jesus
[53:30] Christ is not just a nice idea amen it's
[53:34] just not just a nice you know oh well I
[53:36] wasn't that need he died for me but
[53:38] there's power in that blood that was
[53:39] released and that power is still as
[53:41] great today as it was back then and it
[53:44] can transform you as it transform many
[53:46] other people and that is not ping the
[53:49] sky it's a living reality Hallelujah if
[53:52] we could just recognize what we have and
[53:54] what God God has done for you Hallelujah
[53:57] then we'd really Rejoice
[54:00] amen so
[54:02] now it's not just joining a church and
[54:05] being religious and knowing Jesus died
[54:08] for you just mentally but he a and and
[54:12] that he is a distant God someplace and
[54:14] he's only a god of History it is a CH
[54:17] it's not that anymore our brother bam
[54:19] did this but the same God is alive today
[54:22] people make a tradition out of what he
[54:23] did and sure it's wonderful what God did
[54:25] through that man but it's back there the
[54:28] same word he preached the same life that
[54:30] was in him is now in the bride amen cuz
[54:32] it's a same Lord Jesus Christ if he is
[54:35] the same yesterday today and forever he
[54:37] may change the way he appears but the
[54:40] core being of himself is the same amen
[54:42] so if he's the same then exactly what he
[54:45] did back there he'll do
[54:46] today
[54:48] amen
[54:50] so so it is but it is now a God that can
[54:55] that that transforms his people by his
[54:57] word and that he comes and dwells in you
[54:59] and gives you the power to
[55:01] overcome amen it's not just talking
[55:04] about it but it's actually seeing God
[55:06] take
[55:07] Dominion
[55:09] hallelujah amen so
[55:12] now we so we have to you know we have to
[55:17] recognize that you know I was thinking
[55:19] this is Queen's birthday weekend and we
[55:21] know this is the day we celebrate the
[55:23] Queen's birthday but to me it's it's
[55:26] it's significant because there's been a
[55:28] birth of another queen Amen in this age
[55:31] not talking about one person I'm talking
[55:32] about a people all over the earth a
[55:34] queen has been born we know all the past
[55:37] ages they're part of that number as well
[55:39] but there's a queen upon the Earth that
[55:41] not just not just looks at becoming but
[55:44] they become amen amen that they Paul
[55:47] would say that you would know as you are
[55:49] knowing it says in Corinthians that you
[55:51] shall know as you are knowing so there
[55:53] must come a time time where you know
[55:56] exactly as God knows you not what you
[55:59] think you are or what you know about
[56:01] yourself because many times that is
[56:03] vastly different to what he knows about
[56:05] you amen so you got to know how does I
[56:09] must know as I am known and this is this
[56:11] is not your desire this is God's desire
[56:14] I want you to know who you are what I've
[56:17] done for you that I place the devil
[56:19] under your feet amen that Dominion's
[56:22] been given to the children of the king
[56:23] amen amen right now yes sir
[56:27] Hallelujah now I said last Sunday Satan
[56:30] has been has uh you know Satan has cast
[56:32] out as a de as as the bride begins her
[56:35] Ascension and we can even see this
[56:38] because you know if you've become a real
[56:40] believer the devil has already been cast
[56:42] out amen he was once governing the
[56:45] Throne of your life but then God came
[56:48] along and cast him out he was dethroned
[56:51] Hallelujah and God took his position
[56:53] upon your throne amen so already the
[56:56] devil's been dethroned in your life amen
[56:58] you used to you used to be governed by
[57:00] what he wanted you to do and it tells us
[57:03] in it tells us in Ephesians chapter 2 he
[57:06] says and you hath he quickened who were
[57:09] dead in trespasses and sins where in
[57:11] times past you walked according to the
[57:13] course of this world according to the
[57:15] prince of the power of the year the
[57:17] spirit that now worketh in the children
[57:19] of Disobedience among whom also you all
[57:22] had our we all had our conversation in
[57:25] times past I'm glad Paul puts himself in
[57:27] that verse as well we all had our
[57:29] conversation in times past and the lust
[57:31] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[57:34] the Flesh and of the mind and were're by
[57:35] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[57:38] others but God who is rich in Mercy for
[57:41] his great lover and he loved us even
[57:43] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[57:46] us together in Christ by Grace you are
[57:48] saved and has raised us up together and
[57:52] made us sit together in heavenly places
[57:55] in Christ Jesus this is God's doing amen
[57:58] you may be in the same kind of body but
[58:00] you're walking in a totally different
[58:02] realm Hallelujah so he has raised us up
[58:05] so Satan what is what is the purpose of
[58:07] the preaching of the word to cast out
[58:10] Satan amen that that that children are
[58:12] birthed into the kingdom and Satan is
[58:14] cast out because he must be cast out of
[58:17] every bride member amen because it's not
[58:20] just you know you know he must be
[58:23] dethroned Hallelujah and God must take
[58:25] the throne amen so it's so important now
[58:31] where God God would come to you and he
[58:34] and it doesn't matter you know you got
[58:36] to look at what you have been and what
[58:38] you are amen look at the effect of what
[58:41] has the word done for you and it may
[58:43] manifest in many different ways but
[58:44] what's the end result amen it's like a
[58:47] birth same woman can have just say three
[58:50] children for example and all the births
[58:52] could be very different some could be
[58:54] good some could be bad some could need
[58:56] medical intervention but a child's born
[58:59] what's the end result amen and so you
[59:01] going to see is is the life in me
[59:03] producing the life of Jesus Christ amen
[59:07] that's what you got to see that's the
[59:09] most important thing so now as I said uh
[59:13] you know as I read there in Hebrews
[59:14] chapter 12 Paul is saying you have not
[59:17] come to the mountain you know Mount Si
[59:20] with the law and God being distant from
[59:23] you you have not come to that place see
[59:25] he contrasting now you have not come to
[59:27] that place but you have come to Mount
[59:29] Zion amen the city am mean unto the city
[59:32] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[59:35] and to an innumerable company of angels
[59:39] now we understand that the so this is
[59:41] where this is where the bride has come
[59:43] to in this last
[59:45] day and we understand that that that
[59:48] Mount Zion God would say in Psalms 132:
[59:52] 13 he'd say for the Lord has chosen Zion
[59:55] and he hath desired it for his
[59:58] habitation this is my rest forever here
[1:00:01] will I dwell for I have desired it so
[1:00:05] it's God's desire to dwell in Zion and
[1:00:07] we understand that Zion is not a not
[1:00:10] just a place in Jerusalem but it speaks
[1:00:12] of the bride of Christ because because
[1:00:16] um I think it was you know it's one of
[1:00:18] the Apostles in Acts chapter 7 he begins
[1:00:21] to preach from Moses down he says but
[1:00:23] but Solomon built him a house house
[1:00:25] speaking of the Living God he says how
[1:00:27] be it the most high dwelleth not in
[1:00:29] temples made with hands as saith the
[1:00:31] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[1:00:33] my foot stol what house will ye build me
[1:00:36] sayth the Lord or what is the place of
[1:00:38] my rest hath not my hands made all
[1:00:41] things so he's saying that that that
[1:00:44] that that Earthly house was not the
[1:00:46] place of his rest he saying the the very
[1:00:48] soul of man is the dwelling place of God
[1:00:51] am mean that is the dwelling place so
[1:00:53] now when God says that I have chosen
[1:00:56] Zion and have desired it to be his
[1:00:59] habitation and saying this is my rest
[1:01:02] forever here will I dwell for I've
[1:01:04] desired it he's speaking that's his
[1:01:06] desire towards you amen that I have I
[1:01:09] have chosen Zion it's not it's not that
[1:01:11] the bride chooses him you know he
[1:01:14] chooses her amen him and his choosing
[1:01:17] chose you amen before the foundation of
[1:01:20] the world he chose you you know I was
[1:01:22] just thinking people say how do you know
[1:01:24] know my name is written in the Lamb's
[1:01:25] Book of Life slam you know you have the
[1:01:27] lamb slam before the foundation of the
[1:01:29] world one simple thing you don't worship
[1:01:31] the
[1:01:32] Beast the scripture is very clear thou
[1:01:35] all will worship Him whose names are not
[1:01:37] written in the Lamb's Book of Life how
[1:01:39] do you know I'm not one of them I don't
[1:01:41] worship the Beast I mean in my Deeds or
[1:01:43] my Doctrine or what I believe we've
[1:01:45] heard a voice in this day and we've been
[1:01:47] called out and it doesn't matter how how
[1:01:50] watered down they try and make
[1:01:52] Christianity to try and merge the whole
[1:01:53] thing together
[1:01:54] there's just something in me saying I
[1:01:56] don't want to go there because I've
[1:01:58] heard a voice that says come out of her
[1:02:00] and there's something in me that I just
[1:02:02] died and I yielded and I say yes Lord
[1:02:04] I'll come Hallelujah I trust I trust
[1:02:08] you've had the same experience amen so
[1:02:11] God has God has desired that Zion would
[1:02:13] be his habitation but we understand that
[1:02:16] there was another one who who has
[1:02:18] desired the same the same place because
[1:02:21] Satan wanted to get into the bride of
[1:02:23] Christ as well because Satan wants to be
[1:02:25] like the most high and to be like the
[1:02:28] most high now so so he wants to be
[1:02:30] worshiped and he is over the Earth but
[1:02:33] he wants to get place where he can go to
[1:02:35] the throne of God remember in the
[1:02:37] beginning he was the Cherub that covers
[1:02:39] so he was he was right there by God but
[1:02:42] then he was cast down and then and then
[1:02:45] he he he in Eden he wanted to get into
[1:02:48] the human race in order to get into
[1:02:51] Israel and they wanted to get into
[1:02:53] Israel in order to to get into the
[1:02:55] church and then he wanted to get into
[1:02:57] the church so he could get into the
[1:02:59] bride and he wanted to get into the
[1:03:01] bride because he knew the bride was
[1:03:02] going to the throne amen but so so he
[1:03:06] has he had a desire I'm going to dwell
[1:03:08] on her she shall not be yours but you
[1:03:11] shall be
[1:03:12] mine but God he's not afraid of a
[1:03:15] challenge he's not scared amen he
[1:03:19] doesn't shrink back and say oh Satan oh
[1:03:21] what am I going to do with this guy he
[1:03:23] created him as an instrument
[1:03:25] you got to understand Satan is an
[1:03:27] instrument in the hands of God he can do
[1:03:29] nothing until he gets permission from
[1:03:31] God he can do absolutely nothing he
[1:03:34] couldn't kill job am mean he couldn't
[1:03:37] the first time he goes up before God he
[1:03:39] couldn't even make him sick he couldn't
[1:03:41] even touch his body God gave strict
[1:03:43] parameters Satan you can only work
[1:03:45] within this and then he goes back and
[1:03:47] says look you know God says look he
[1:03:49] hasn't cursed you he said just because
[1:03:51] he's not sick yet then God gives him
[1:03:53] more parameters you can touch him but
[1:03:55] don't take his life amen and God it was
[1:03:58] actually Satan asking permission boss he
[1:04:00] would never call him boss but this is
[1:04:02] basically what I saying can I do this cu
[1:04:04] the boss is in
[1:04:05] charge amen he doesn't acknowledge it
[1:04:07] but that's basically what Satan does
[1:04:09] boss can I go do this and and he said
[1:04:13] yeah you can do this but not do this and
[1:04:16] we can see in the life of Job he could
[1:04:17] not overstep the boundaries that God
[1:04:19] gave him no matter how much he wants to
[1:04:22] no matter how much he would have tried
[1:04:24] that he just he literally cannot do it
[1:04:27] amen so God God allowed Satan to come
[1:04:31] against job amen and God knew he was
[1:04:34] going to do it and he wasn't getting a
[1:04:36] live stream as it was happening he
[1:04:38] already knew it was happening and it's
[1:04:40] the same thing with you why did this
[1:04:42] happen just rest in the fact God allowed
[1:04:45] it to happen to me God knew it happened
[1:04:47] remember God had confidence in job
[1:04:49] because job had confidence in the lamb
[1:04:51] that he offered and that's why he had
[1:04:53] confidence in job that's the same thing
[1:04:55] you you brother Bram says job didn't
[1:04:57] think he was righteous or thought he was
[1:04:59] perfect he had confidence in the lamb
[1:05:02] and if that could be a man who only just
[1:05:04] heard of God and had no idea who he was
[1:05:06] even though he is a wise man and he just
[1:05:08] had a had an animal to sacrifice how
[1:05:11] much more the bride of Christ how much
[1:05:14] more those who really know their maker
[1:05:17] they really know their father how much
[1:05:18] more
[1:05:19] them amen we can rest Hallelujah in the
[1:05:23] fact God is in control amen now so we
[1:05:26] have come we have come to the place
[1:05:29] where God dwells which is which is US
[1:05:32] unto the city of the Living God the
[1:05:34] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[1:05:37] company of angels now this is very
[1:05:39] interesting because in the Old Testament
[1:05:42] there especially the Hebrews you know
[1:05:45] they had they knew what Moses did you
[1:05:47] know they had a lot of God of history
[1:05:49] and it was always like in Moses day or
[1:05:51] the Old Testament day was God above them
[1:05:54] that Jesus was Emanuel god with them but
[1:05:56] he didn't just want to stay with them he
[1:05:57] wanted to be in them and when you know I
[1:06:01] was thinking about how you know Peter
[1:06:03] James and John they knew fishing you
[1:06:06] know they knew what fishing was they
[1:06:08] knew what reading the Bible was they
[1:06:10] knew what the synagogue was you know
[1:06:14] they they uh knew that there was a
[1:06:16] messiah coming and they knew that you
[1:06:19] know one day there was a heaven and a
[1:06:22] and and the grave and you know they just
[1:06:24] knew those things but they're out there
[1:06:25] somewhere and then Jesus came and then
[1:06:29] he opened a whole new Supernatural realm
[1:06:31] to them that was already there amen the
[1:06:34] devil was still always there God was
[1:06:36] there the Angels were there they had no
[1:06:39] idea amen and so God began to open up a
[1:06:43] realm that was Far different to fishing
[1:06:45] and synagogue and Priests and scribes
[1:06:47] and Pharisees you know they saw Lazarus
[1:06:50] come forth they never seen a man riding
[1:06:52] in the grave come forth alive Al healthy
[1:06:54] and well they never seen a man stand on
[1:06:57] the brow of the boat and say peace be
[1:06:58] still am mean they never seen you know
[1:07:01] lepers cleans like that and all manner
[1:07:03] of diseases come out and a woman Touch
[1:07:05] the Hem of His Garment and you know be
[1:07:07] made whole and they never heard a man
[1:07:09] say in My Father's House of many
[1:07:11] mansions I go to prepare a place for you
[1:07:14] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:07:16] I'll come again and receive you unto
[1:07:17] myself that where I am you shall be also
[1:07:20] they had an idea about all these things
[1:07:22] but then Jesus God came
[1:07:24] and a great purpose he had them with
[1:07:26] them as he wanted to show what you see
[1:07:28] is such a small bit of life amen this is
[1:07:31] this is just a vapor the scripture tells
[1:07:33] us and people invest so much into this
[1:07:36] world and all the physical things hey we
[1:07:39] need to work and we need to provide and
[1:07:40] we need to have a house and we need to
[1:07:42] do those things but don't let it become
[1:07:44] your all in all always look at it as a
[1:07:46] means to an end always look at it that
[1:07:49] way and so God begin to you know Jesus
[1:07:52] begin to show them now
[1:07:54] that even even even he said when when
[1:07:58] when when they came into the Garden of
[1:07:59] Gethsemane Peter takes out a sword I'm
[1:08:02] going to defend the Lord and he and he
[1:08:04] tries to kill the guy and he cuts off
[1:08:05] his ear because he's not a swordsman and
[1:08:08] then Jesus just says to him don't you
[1:08:09] know I can call and get a whole Legion
[1:08:12] of
[1:08:13] angels amen he didn't know about Legions
[1:08:15] of angels Jesus knew about Legions of
[1:08:18] angels but but Peter had no idea I mean
[1:08:21] he's trying to open their eyes of
[1:08:22] understanding the spiritual
[1:08:24] understanding that life is more than
[1:08:26] these dimensions and these things we see
[1:08:28] you know this this world even if you
[1:08:30] take the spectrum of know your your
[1:08:32] light spectrum you take the whole
[1:08:34] Spectrum from The High Frequency to very
[1:08:37] low frequency the visible range is very
[1:08:40] small and this is the realm we operate
[1:08:43] in amen and we get so caught up in you
[1:08:46] know you know you see something go wrong
[1:08:48] and oh what's going to happen it's just
[1:08:51] such a little bit don't look at the
[1:08:53] little little but look to the
[1:08:55] Unseen amen we're called to look to the
[1:08:57] Unseen in this day and hour and then so
[1:09:00] this this innumerable company of angels
[1:09:02] this word innumerable is exactly the
[1:09:05] same word as as we would read about in
[1:09:07] in in Revelations chapter 9 where a
[1:09:11] 100,000,000 uh demons were you know
[1:09:14] released from the rivie frates this word
[1:09:16] innumerable is the same as that word
[1:09:17] thousand thousand just
[1:09:19] means it means it means uh it means
[1:09:22] actually a 10,000 by extension a myriad
[1:09:26] or an indefinite number so such a such a
[1:09:29] high number they didn't really have
[1:09:31] enough zeros to you know a word to
[1:09:33] really put it into a bill that's why I
[1:09:35] said inumerable company of angels so you
[1:09:39] know we have come the bride has come to
[1:09:41] a a walk with God where we recognize the
[1:09:45] Unseen realm was a lot more real than
[1:09:47] what we see here amen and the bride
[1:09:49] operates in a realm that is not by sight
[1:09:53] amen we we never confess what we see we
[1:09:56] confess what we believe Hallelujah am
[1:09:58] mean oh that's just denying
[1:09:59] circumstances no it's not it's
[1:10:01] confessing it's confessing the word I
[1:10:04] mean you may be sick but say by Stripes
[1:10:06] I'm Healed things may be going wrong but
[1:10:09] you may say he's my heavenly father he's
[1:10:11] my bridegroom he's my counselor he he
[1:10:14] has all things in control amen you see
[1:10:18] you you may see the family go Wayward
[1:10:19] but you say but the scripture says them
[1:10:21] and their seed will be there
[1:10:24] amen that's what you should confess amen
[1:10:27] are there are there's not Harmony in the
[1:10:30] home the peace that I give you not as
[1:10:32] the world gives amen you confess that
[1:10:36] don't never look at the symptoms look at
[1:10:38] the cause of the
[1:10:39] symptoms amen and it should always be
[1:10:42] well what's the cause it's not my
[1:10:44] sibling or my spouse it's the
[1:10:47] enemy amen remember the enemy is never
[1:10:50] one
[1:10:51] another never one another oh that person
[1:10:54] said this this person did this no no no
[1:10:56] no no no no no no no you got it all
[1:10:58] wrong amen it's the
[1:11:01] devil amen than you Lord because people
[1:11:04] really what they know amen and then you
[1:11:08] know you know why do I why do I preach
[1:11:11] what I'm preaching today well it's
[1:11:12] because some I was reading some things
[1:11:14] and some thoughts came into my mind and
[1:11:16] on my heart and now I put them on paper
[1:11:18] why do people respond to you certain
[1:11:20] ways because thoughts come in their mind
[1:11:22] and then they speak what they think is
[1:11:23] actually
[1:11:25] correct amen that's why you've got to
[1:11:28] take your thoughts and and and make sure
[1:11:30] they're subject to the word because the
[1:11:32] devil will give you a whole bunch of
[1:11:33] misinformation but you should take that
[1:11:35] shred it burn it throw it away and then
[1:11:38] and then speak the real
[1:11:39] stuff amen so we have come to an
[1:11:43] innumerable company of angels and so we
[1:11:46] are not alone in this walk I trust you
[1:11:48] have come to that realization God is
[1:11:51] here amen yo if Jesus says I will be
[1:11:55] with you even in you I that's a person
[1:11:58] and it's not speaking of just a little
[1:12:00] bit of me or maybe I just you know like
[1:12:02] people you know you know there's
[1:12:03] tragedies happen in the world and people
[1:12:05] say my thoughts are with you and my you
[1:12:06] know that's that's that's so cheap but
[1:12:10] he says I'll be with you I the person so
[1:12:14] everything he was when he was here in
[1:12:15] the days of his flesh he says I that
[1:12:17] same person will be with you Amen to
[1:12:20] everything remember all he was a he was
[1:12:22] the fullness of the godhead bod was in a
[1:12:24] man amen so everything God was he was
[1:12:27] walking in flesh and he says I'll not
[1:12:30] leave you comfortless I'll come to you
[1:12:32] in a little while the world seeth me no
[1:12:33] more but ye shall see me and in that day
[1:12:36] you shall know I am in the father I in
[1:12:38] you and you and me amen you would
[1:12:41] recognize that God is with you so
[1:12:43] therefore I and he also said we're two
[1:12:45] or three gathered in my name and that's
[1:12:47] not just saying the name of Jesus Christ

[1:13:07] on his name amen and because we have the
[1:13:10] truth of his

[1:17:31] believer sister
[1:17:32] Bruce um how he says when you get sick
[1:17:36] you get weary who gets
[1:17:39] weary yeah you're a nervous type person
[1:17:43] who's a nervous type person nothing
[1:17:45] wrong with
[1:17:46] that and you get things on your mind who
[1:17:49] gets things on their mind everyone gets
[1:17:51] things on their mind okay little bitty
[1:17:54] things I'll just keep my hand up if you

[1:18:01] ways yeah yeah you'll get someone on
[1:18:05] your heart you want to pray for them get
[1:18:07] up and pray for them you can't rest till
[1:18:10] you get that person prayed for yeah
[1:18:13] that's you Hallelujah then take it on
[1:18:17] the other side Satan might present
[1:18:21] something that you
[1:18:23] see you know uh uh and not this way
[1:18:27] see so he's saying that Satan might
[1:18:30] present something to you and you just
[1:18:32] can't shake the thing and it you know so
[1:18:34] he's saying that you're a nervous type
[1:18:36] person and you get things on your mind
[1:18:37] little bitty things and they just build
[1:18:40] yeah but God uses that when a burden
[1:18:43] comes for prayer but then Satan uses
[1:18:46] that against to to things to build and
[1:18:48] build and build and build and she cuz
[1:18:50] she's a nervous type person and that
[1:18:52] uses her to get get weary and worn out
[1:18:55] see God God doesn't matter what nature
[1:18:57] you have God will use it Satan will use
[1:19:00] it against you but you got to recognize
[1:19:02] when it's Satan working against you and
[1:19:05] God working for
[1:19:07] you
[1:19:08] Hallelujah now you're a nature and God
[1:19:11] works and Satan Works remember brother
[1:19:14] Bram saying sister Bruce I believe
[1:19:16] you're real Born Again believer so this
[1:19:20] is someone who's got the Holy Ghost you
[1:19:23] understand this is someone who's got the
[1:19:24] Holy Ghost now and God works and Satan
[1:19:27] works then when Satan tries to make you
[1:19:30] believe that you're not see you keep
[1:19:33] building
[1:19:34] this yeah so Satan will come along oh
[1:19:37] you don't have the Holy Ghost or you're
[1:19:39] weary and this is why you're weary and
[1:19:41] this is how things are and it just
[1:19:42] builds builds builds builds
[1:19:44] builds Hallelujah that's me see maybe
[1:19:47] this is right but don't look at yourself
[1:19:50] sister
[1:19:51] Bruce remember
[1:19:53] I'm fixing to pray for you I'm not
[1:19:56] worthy of that I think what would I do
[1:19:59] if Jesus Christ was sitting here now and
[1:20:02] well what would he do if he was sitting
[1:20:05] here he would lay his hands upon you and
[1:20:08] with his great faith see you'd get well
[1:20:10] well now I think well I'm a sinner I'm
[1:20:12] not him but I come to represent him see
[1:20:16] must remember me being a sinner and
[1:20:18] before God I'm not a sinner neither are
[1:20:21] you we got a blood sacrifice laying
[1:20:24] there God don't even see us he hears our
[1:20:28] voice but he sees the blood of Christ
[1:20:30] that's it see he sees the blood of his
[1:20:33] own son it's our voice Christ blood and
[1:20:36] it's not Christ that's talking through
[1:20:39] to uh through us to God I mean I mean
[1:20:41] sorry and it's Christ that's talking
[1:20:43] through us to God so therefore we're not
[1:20:45] Sinners no more we are Christians I
[1:20:48] believe you to be a genuine Christian
[1:20:50] woman I remember the thing that's what
[1:20:52] why Christ had to die so that you with
[1:20:55] your mistakes wouldn't be alloted to you
[1:20:58] see he took your mistakes your desire is
[1:21:02] to serve him I'm just so glad he just
[1:21:04] goes to the a prophet just goes to the
[1:21:06] source your desire is to serve him all
[1:21:10] right that's what he died for so that
[1:21:12] you could serve him see your mistakes
[1:21:15] are not looked not a looted to you see
[1:21:18] he is your
[1:21:19] propitiation see remember if if we
[1:21:21] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:21:25] to forgive us the scripture tells us
[1:21:28] amen you're not a sinner see he is your
[1:21:30] sin offering your sins are not known
[1:21:33] you're not a sinner before God Christ
[1:21:36] took your sins became you because your
[1:21:39] desire is to serve him Hallelujah all
[1:21:43] right notice this ordinary human being
[1:21:45] is born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[1:21:47] to the world speaking lies that's the
[1:21:49] nature of a human being that was your
[1:21:52] nature natur it changed once but what
[1:21:55] changed it and she says you can hear on
[1:21:56] tape Christ and then he says there you
[1:21:59] are sister see that's it he that Hearth
[1:22:03] my words and believeth on that sent me
[1:22:05] eternal life and shall not come to the
[1:22:08] Judgment but is p ha past tense passed
[1:22:11] from Death To Life St John 5:24 Jesus
[1:22:14] speaking see you're not um you're a
[1:22:17] Christian sister Bruce I've watched your
[1:22:20] life I've watched you under Vision I
[1:22:22] know you're a Christian see not one spe
[1:22:26] amen he see he says I know you're a real
[1:22:28] believer but you see the enemy will work
[1:22:30] against you a certain way and God will
[1:22:33] work a certain way amen and you've got
[1:22:36] to you've got to look at
[1:22:39] now what is it
[1:22:41] producing what is your thought pattern
[1:22:44] producing does it produce peace does it
[1:22:48] produce greater love for God does it
[1:22:50] produce a closer relationship sh with
[1:22:52] your family does it create a better
[1:22:55] relationship with your brothers and
[1:22:57] sisters amen is that what your thought
[1:22:59] pattern produces does it you know does
[1:23:02] it produce a you know a closer walk to
[1:23:04] God or does it produce a separation from
[1:23:08] your family amen a
[1:23:11] selfishness amen a you know well you
[1:23:14] know a no real desire to serve the Lord
[1:23:18] anymore I mean what does it produce what
[1:23:21] is the root of bitterness a thought
[1:23:23] comes
[1:23:23] in amen and it and it begins to grow and
[1:23:27] what happens is that person becomes
[1:23:30] bitter I mean why because a thought is
[1:23:32] received and it begins to grow and so a
[1:23:35] person's thought pattern because of
[1:23:36] maybe what happened to them now causes
[1:23:39] them to become
[1:23:41] bitter amen he says do not let a root of
[1:23:44] bitterness grow in
[1:23:45] you because the devil will try and make
[1:23:48] you bitter about
[1:23:49] something amen but Jesus being our our
[1:23:53] example he just said father forgive them
[1:23:55] they don't know what they do I think I
[1:23:57] said maybe last Sunday Sunday before
[1:23:59] they knew what they were but if you look
[1:24:01] at what they're doing they planned what
[1:24:02] they
[1:24:03] did they it calculated it was planned
[1:24:07] and it was executed so we would actually
[1:24:10] think they knew what they were doing but
[1:24:13] Jesus recognized if they really knew
[1:24:15] that I was the Prince of Life they would
[1:24:16] never have crucified me like Paul said
[1:24:19] amen so you got to think about it
[1:24:22] someone something comes against you or
[1:24:24] you know maybe out or in the family
[1:24:27] whoever it is something comes against
[1:24:28] you there's a misunderstanding all kinds
[1:24:30] of things you've just got to really
[1:24:32] recognize you got to look Beyond and
[1:24:34] just say father forgive them they don't
[1:24:35] know what they're doing amen because if
[1:24:38] there's unforgiveness it only really
[1:24:40] affects you it doesn't affect the other
[1:24:42] person it's
[1:24:43] you
[1:24:45] amen I'll read this as
[1:24:49] well this is this is from the uniting
[1:24:52] time in
[1:24:53] sign is brother Brenham we're going down
[1:24:56] in um uh we're going down in Kentucky I
[1:25:00] just happened to come in that day that
[1:25:02] Mrs Weaver died and it just ride help
[1:25:06] brother Neville in that the funeral uh I
[1:25:08] do not try to say too much about it you
[1:25:11] know around people complaining around
[1:25:13] people complaining cuz I think one of
[1:25:15] the most horriblest things is to see a
[1:25:18] man or a woman that's constantly
[1:25:20] complaining I always thought God keep me
[1:25:23] from it see that weakens Faith all the
[1:25:27] time you
[1:25:28] know amen complain so he's saying
[1:25:31] complaining weakens your
[1:25:34] faith look at look at look at Israel
[1:25:37] going through the Wilderness they begin
[1:25:39] to murmur and complain and then when
[1:25:42] they came to Kadesh B they said we can't
[1:25:44] take the land why because it weakened
[1:25:46] the the the complaining of their
[1:25:48] situation weaken their faith oh if we
[1:25:51] could look beyond what we see amen
[1:25:54] that's why you don't you don't confess
[1:25:56] what you see don't even take it into
[1:25:58] account take his word into account amen
[1:26:01] and hold on to the word whatever
[1:26:03] situation you're in I always thought God
[1:26:06] keep me from it see that weakens Faith
[1:26:08] all the time you
[1:26:10] know um he says I know as you get older
[1:26:13] each people of us we're going to get
[1:26:16] something happened and something
[1:26:17] happened and I know those little things
[1:26:19] are going to keep accumulating
[1:26:22] that's as you get older they just got to
[1:26:26] but I think one of the most horrible
[1:26:28] things is for Satan to Crown some
[1:26:31] person's life as a crabbed old man or
[1:26:34] old woman you see this is what he wants
[1:26:37] to make you he wants to Crown your life
[1:26:39] as a crab dog man or he say one of the
[1:26:41] most horrible things and he says I hope
[1:26:44] I don't get to I I hope I don't get to
[1:26:47] that place I hope that I can bear it as
[1:26:50] my burdens and get to a spot where I
[1:26:54] want my life crowned with the glory of
[1:26:57] God his longsuffering gentleness peace
[1:27:00] meekness and filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:27:03] one of my main things that always hurt
[1:27:05] through my life has been a nervous
[1:27:07] condition I'm so glad the prophet was
[1:27:10] real amen that when I get so worn then I
[1:27:15] get real weary I get kind of feeling
[1:27:18] like nobody cares for you I'll just put
[1:27:22] both hands
[1:27:23] up you know and we're all we you have it
[1:27:28] too I just happen to real overdose of it
[1:27:31] you know and now it gets real bad
[1:27:35] sometime and I can't hardly it's tension
[1:27:39] and that's what does
[1:27:41] it and I get to a spot then that many
[1:27:44] times especially so many of those
[1:27:46] Visions you see it just gets me I look
[1:27:48] at a person I think this is a vision no
[1:27:50] no no yes is it or not not you see and
[1:27:53] you just don't realize what price goes
[1:27:55] with that so then you wonder then you
[1:27:59] get to thinking well you're then you get
[1:28:01] off your side and think well now what
[1:28:04] have I done here I'm 50 years old and
[1:28:07] I've done nothing for the Lord I'm
[1:28:08] getting old and oh my then you just get
[1:28:12] in what we call we used to call the
[1:28:15] blues some of you Brethren about my age
[1:28:18] remember what they used to call uh have
[1:28:21] the Blues
[1:28:22] pop used to talk about it and I wondered
[1:28:25] what he meant and I sure know now what
[1:28:28] he meant so then you get to feeling that
[1:28:30] way which is none of it true it's just
[1:28:34] you and you know it see you know it's
[1:28:37] you doing that why because it's your
[1:28:40] nature being used against
[1:28:42] you
[1:28:44] amen so you've got to you know don't let
[1:28:50] whatever you do remember we come to
[1:28:52] Mount Zion we've come to a unable
[1:28:54] company of angels amen we've come to the
[1:28:57] Living God so don't let don't let
[1:29:00] Natural Things of life you know don't
[1:29:03] let Natural Things of Life allow you to
[1:29:05] be crowned as a crabby old man or old
[1:29:09] woman amen because the way you go is the
[1:29:12] way you end up amen so things so you may
[1:29:16] begin to act a certain way but then when
[1:29:19] you get older it just gets greater
[1:29:21] whether you like it or not amen remember
[1:29:24] we have a
[1:29:26] promise that this this this guy has to
[1:29:30] be will be under subjection to the life
[1:29:33] that's within you amen amen that the
[1:29:35] Living God will take this flesh under
[1:29:38] subjection amen if you allow
[1:29:40] him we have that
[1:29:44] promise and so we have come to a place
[1:29:47] where the Eternal God Is With Us yeah
[1:29:50] that's what we read you have come to
[1:29:51] Mount Zion the living
[1:29:52] living wait let's you know into a
[1:29:55] numerable company of angels to the
[1:29:57] Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:29:59] amen and then and then as I said now
[1:30:03] that that word innumerable it means know
[1:30:05] it means a myriad a great
[1:30:08] number and so that is the same number as
[1:30:11] the 100,000,000 demons that are released
[1:30:13] out of the river Euphrates amen and we
[1:30:15] know that demon power has been released
[1:30:18] Amen in this end time as Revelations 9:1
[1:30:21] and and that star fell from heaven which
[1:30:24] was Satan himself he fell and as I said
[1:30:27] you know when someone Falls it's because
[1:30:29] they've been pushed you know so they
[1:30:31] don't have any say they've just been
[1:30:33] pushed amen so he fell and then now as
[1:30:37] you read that he you it says that that
[1:30:39] that you know those demons were released
[1:30:42] and it says one W was passed and two
[1:30:44] come Hereafter and in the Bible a war is
[1:30:47] a World
[1:30:48] War amen so after World War 4 One what
[1:30:52] happens is now the Pit's open all this
[1:30:55] demon power comes upon the Earth and you
[1:30:57] can see it
[1:30:59] manifested amen because there's always a
[1:31:01] oh you say society's changed why has
[1:31:04] Society
[1:31:05] changed amen what is influencing the
[1:31:07] world that is different to what it was
[1:31:11] amen it's because there's more demon
[1:31:13] power
[1:31:14] loosed amen but as I said before there's
[1:31:17] more for us than against us amen and and
[1:31:21] as Elish
[1:31:22] I think Elisha or Elijah I can't
[1:31:23] remember when the syrians came to come
[1:31:26] get him and then his servant went out
[1:31:28] and saw the Syrian Army there and he
[1:31:30] prayed Lord open the open the boy's eyes
[1:31:33] and his eyes became open and there all
[1:31:35] the Flaming chariots and angels of the
[1:31:37] Lord all around now that didn't cause
[1:31:40] the angels to suddenly turn up they were
[1:31:42] already there they were already there
[1:31:45] but his eyes had to come open for him to
[1:31:46] recognize I'm not alone in this battle
[1:31:49] actually there's heaps more for us and
[1:31:51] against us
[1:31:52] Hallelujah you got to recognize that am
[1:31:55] mean that's why it says you've come to
[1:31:57] an innumerable company of angels and
[1:31:59] remember one will chase a thousand oh
[1:32:02] that's physical no no no no no no no
[1:32:04] that's actually spiritual now it was a
[1:32:07] natural enemy in the Old Testament but
[1:32:09] now it's a spiritual enemy that's why
[1:32:11] Paul says we don't wrestle against flesh
[1:32:13] and blood we're against principalities
[1:32:15] powers and wickedness in high places it
[1:32:18] says one will chase a th two 10,000 I'd
[1:32:20] like someone to do the one
[1:32:22] time Hallelujah that's a lot amen
[1:32:26] someone do the math sometime please but
[1:32:28] you see there's more for us and against
[1:32:30] us friends oh the world is so dark no to
[1:32:32] me it's so bright it's never been a day
[1:32:35] like this day where God has descended in
[1:32:38] such a way and lifted us up into
[1:32:39] Heavenly places
[1:32:43] Hallelujah so
[1:32:45] now we are
[1:32:49] here we have come to the general
[1:32:52] assembly in the Church of the firstborn
[1:32:54] which are written in heaven amen and so
[1:32:58] this is speaking now that that these
[1:33:00] ones that have come to Zion that they
[1:33:02] are written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:33:04] written in heaven
[1:33:07] amen and and to God the judge of all and
[1:33:12] to the spirits of just being made
[1:33:14] perfect now many times we think of a
[1:33:17] judge as something
[1:33:18] negative but in reality a judge is a
[1:33:21] judgment is a positive thing because
[1:33:24] it's the same thing now when you know
[1:33:26] you know when that woman caught in
[1:33:28] adultery says she was caught in the very
[1:33:30] act you know the scribes and Pharisees
[1:33:32] dragged her before Jesus you know where
[1:33:34] was the man cuz the law said both had to
[1:33:37] come but they just brought the woman and
[1:33:39] then now here was the judge here was the
[1:33:41] Supreme judge standing upon the Earth
[1:33:44] the one who gave the law was standing in
[1:33:46] flesh and
[1:33:48] actually you know she uh you know he
[1:33:51] begin to ride in the
[1:33:53] sand because they were wanting to see
[1:33:55] what he would do he begins to ride in
[1:33:57] the sand he says let him that is without
[1:33:59] sin Let Him cast the first stone and
[1:34:02] they're all convicted of their own
[1:34:03] conscience they dropped their Stones
[1:34:04] they left and then now she said to her
[1:34:08] woman's
[1:34:09] accus and she says there's none Lord
[1:34:12] yeah read it called her he she called
[1:34:15] him Lord which wasn't just a sir she was
[1:34:19] saying God there's none Supreme capital
[1:34:22] l d That's the Supreme one amen she was
[1:34:26] dragged in front of the judge I you I
[1:34:29] trust you see what I'm saying she was
[1:34:30] dragged in front of the judge and that
[1:34:32] caused her to recognize this is more
[1:34:34] than a man amen this is more than a
[1:34:36] Prophet this is God in flesh amen and
[1:34:40] then so she was dragged in front of the
[1:34:42] Supreme judge and she and she was
[1:34:45] pardoned hallelujah amen so we think of
[1:34:48] a judge many times as just well there's
[1:34:50] a there's a sentence passed down the
[1:34:52] person's thrown in jail now there has to
[1:34:54] come a time where the bride is judged
[1:34:57] righteous amen where the you you brother
[1:35:00] tells a story that that that our judge
[1:35:03] became our attorney amen became our
[1:35:06] lawyer so the very judge the one that
[1:35:09] Wasing out case Hallelujah and the man
[1:35:11] Jesus Christ so here comes the judge but
[1:35:14] then comes our attorney and the case is
[1:35:16] thrown out Hallelujah you know really in
[1:35:19] reality can I just I'll just say it this
[1:35:21] way forgive me if this sounds wrong but
[1:35:24] God if you take it in a legal system he
[1:35:28] he he tampers with evidence he destroys
[1:35:30] evidence he's a crooked
[1:35:33] judge Hallelujah you know if you think
[1:35:35] about it because the devil says well I
[1:35:37] made them do this and I gave them this
[1:35:39] perverted birth and they had this Fallen
[1:35:41] nature and they did this and this and
[1:35:42] this with it out of their free will but
[1:35:44] then God says where is it show me where
[1:35:47] it is where did they do that oh but it
[1:35:50] was and and then the devil tries to find
[1:35:52] the file and the file's gone amen
[1:35:55] because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:57] When sin is confessed it falls into his
[1:35:59] blood amen falls into the bleach the
[1:36:01] prophet says and it and it's broken down
[1:36:04] but not only broken down because sin has
[1:36:06] to be destroyed so it goes on the head
[1:36:09] of the accuser amen and on that great
[1:36:12] day when he comes before the
[1:36:15] throne what you did in your flesh before
[1:36:18] you are forgiven he's actually held
[1:36:20] accountable because it was not actually
[1:36:22] your fault you were trapped into this
[1:36:24] body amen this Fallen body you didn't
[1:36:26] choose to come this way he made you come
[1:36:28] this way so he'll stand there you know
[1:36:31] just think Jesus Took the sins of the
[1:36:32] world up Calvary Hallelujah and then now
[1:36:36] here comes another being I'll say you
[1:36:38] know you this is just me just in
[1:36:41] Fellowship but you know to me now here
[1:36:43] comes another being with the sins of the
[1:36:44] world upon him and it's a
[1:36:47] judgment and it's on the and Satan can't
[1:36:50] get it off him
[1:36:53] hallelujah amen why you carrying all
[1:36:55] this Satan oh they did it no you did it
[1:36:58] amen why because the judge has judged
[1:37:01] you
[1:37:02] righteous Hallelujah the judge has
[1:37:04] actually said no you're
[1:37:06] pardoned
[1:37:08] Hallelujah am so now and to the spirits
[1:37:12] of just men made perfect now notice he
[1:37:14] doesn't say the bodies he says the
[1:37:17] spirits of just men he's not talking
[1:37:19] about this flesh now these bodies have
[1:37:21] to be changed but if there's a judgment
[1:37:23] now that you are righteous as God is
[1:37:25] righteous that means You' being made
[1:37:27] perfect Hallelujah there's a there's a
[1:37:30] sinless Perfection that not not that you
[1:37:33] have to achieve it you already have it
[1:37:36] hallelujah amen there's nothing holding
[1:37:38] me here oh but I feel weary and I feel
[1:37:41] down no no no no no no no don't bring
[1:37:44] that how you feel has nothing to do with
[1:37:46] your
[1:37:47] salvation faith and feelings are
[1:37:50] actually conflicting many many
[1:37:52] times amen and to Jesus the mediator of
[1:37:56] the New Covenant and to the blood of
[1:37:58] sprinkling which speaketh better things
[1:37:59] than that of Abel now the
[1:38:04] mediator this mediator also speaks like
[1:38:07] a like an attorney or someone who gives
[1:38:09] out a
[1:38:10] will yeah so now Jesus so Jesus is the
[1:38:15] media the New Covenant so what he is now
[1:38:17] is he is the one so so he died he died
[1:38:21] for a you know this is this is a
[1:38:25] inheritance yeah but but if but if the
[1:38:29] person who has the inheritance is alive
[1:38:31] then the inheritance can't be given out
[1:38:33] normally it never happens so the person
[1:38:36] has to
[1:38:37] die and then he dies and then the
[1:38:39] contents of the will is given out amen
[1:38:42] so Jesus died not for himself but for
[1:38:46] you but then he rose again to ensure
[1:38:49] what he died for was given out
[1:38:51] out amen so now he is the mediator of
[1:38:54] the New Covenant so now he is now
[1:38:56] enforcing now what he died for so so for
[1:39:00] example you take Natural person just say
[1:39:03] if one of my you know just say if I had
[1:39:05] someone who was on life support but in
[1:39:07] his will was on life support you know he
[1:39:11] had given me a house okay so he
[1:39:14] dies yeah and now I get the house but
[1:39:18] it's actually not the guy who dies that
[1:39:20] makes sure I get the house it's the
[1:39:21] lawyer someone who actually has the
[1:39:23] qualifications to do it yep but Jesus
[1:39:26] didn't just die he rose again and he had
[1:39:29] because he's our attorney he's our
[1:39:31] lawyer he makes sure what he died that
[1:39:34] you would receive you would receive it
[1:39:37] Hallelujah you understand so that's why
[1:39:39] one day you're bumbling along maybe you
[1:39:41] just grew up in church doesn't matter
[1:39:43] one day you're walking in darkness but
[1:39:46] he hadn't his will to brother Santo
[1:39:49] sister Santo I have given the
[1:39:51] Rapture I've given dominion over sin I
[1:39:55] have cleared the charges Hallelujah
[1:39:58] they're going to be like me made in my
[1:39:59] image Lord and the likeness that that
[1:40:02] they will know me in the power of my
[1:40:03] resurrection and the likeness of my
[1:40:04] sufferings they will know peace that
[1:40:06] passes all understanding they joy and
[1:40:09] speakable and full of Glory they will
[1:40:11] know me as I am and they shall know as
[1:40:13] they are known amen they will walk with
[1:40:15] me like very few have walked with me
[1:40:17] they will walk with the Apostles of trod
[1:40:19] they will know the power of blood and
[1:40:21] they will know that is cleansing power
[1:40:23] they will know that I'm the same
[1:40:24] yesterday today and forever they will
[1:40:26] know my very mind amen they will know
[1:40:29] the secrets that in the back part of my
[1:40:30] mind they will know amen they'll know
[1:40:32] that they came from me and went back to
[1:40:34] me Hallelujah they'll know that I've
[1:40:36] taken the book and open the seals and
[1:40:37] given them their Redemption amen and
[1:40:40] they will know that this that Satan is
[1:40:42] cast down and they are lifted up and
[1:40:44] whatever else is there and so he ensured
[1:40:47] and then that's why he comes your way
[1:40:49] amen and this word this message came
[1:40:51] across your path that you would
[1:40:53] recognize this is what he died for
[1:40:55] Hallelujah you know this is not just
[1:40:57] taking on some mental Doctrine it sounds
[1:40:59] good and it makes sense no this is not
[1:41:01] what this message is about this is about
[1:41:03] calling people whose names are in the
[1:41:05] book am mean that they would know their
[1:41:07] inheritance Hallelujah that why that is
[1:41:10] why we have this message because God God
[1:41:13] took a prophet a proven Prophet a
[1:41:16] validated Prophet put him upon the Earth
[1:41:18] and said tell them the contents of the
[1:41:20] Willen
[1:41:22] hallelujah amen and it actually it
[1:41:24] wasn't brother Braham doing it he says I
[1:41:25] wanted to be a Trapper I never wanted
[1:41:27] this but God had to use a channel to
[1:41:29] speak it
[1:41:31] Hallelujah so that's why now he's the
[1:41:33] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[1:41:36] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[1:41:38] things than that of Abel now Abel's
[1:41:40] blood all it could do was cry out for
[1:41:43] Revenge cry out for justice that's all
[1:41:45] it could do I mean here is a righteous
[1:41:47] man who has made you know he knew it was
[1:41:49] blood in the garden but his blood all it
[1:41:52] could do was cry out for you know cry
[1:41:54] out for justice but the blood of Jesus
[1:41:57] Christ speaks speaks far greater things
[1:42:00] than that because it doesn't just it
[1:42:02] doesn't speak out that way it speaks out
[1:42:04] of mercy and forgiveness and cleansing
[1:42:07] power amen and that's why had that there
[1:42:10] about sister Bruce because God doesn't
[1:42:12] see you amen that's why he told her it's
[1:42:15] he doesn't see you he sees his blood am
[1:42:18] mean he sees the atonement he doesn't
[1:42:20] see you
[1:42:21] and as I've said probably many times
[1:42:23] when you in the Old Testament here comes
[1:42:25] a man with a lamb and he's taking it as
[1:42:28] a sin offering as soon as that priest
[1:42:31] sees sees the man and the lamb he
[1:42:32] doesn't look at the man he says he says
[1:42:35] you go over there I need to inspect this
[1:42:38] and then he insects the lamb he doesn't
[1:42:39] expect the man he doesn't ask him some
[1:42:42] questions doesn't ask how he was and
[1:42:44] what he did and why he's here and what
[1:42:46] happened he looks at the lamb and then
[1:42:49] he looks at the lamb and then he
[1:42:50] thoroughly says once it's fine now I can
[1:42:52] offer the lamb Hallelujah God doesn't
[1:42:55] look at you the devil wants you to think
[1:42:57] that he looks at you he doesn't look at
[1:42:59] you he looks at the lamb that's why God
[1:43:02] said job was perfect because job offered
[1:43:05] the lamb and God accepted the lamb
[1:43:07] because God gave the lamb to be given
[1:43:10] amen that's why God doesn't look at you
[1:43:12] he looks at the lamb that you present
[1:43:14] which is Christ the word you understand
[1:43:16] amen and God doesn't look at you in your
[1:43:18] condition he looks at that lamb
[1:43:21] Hallelujah that's why Jesus when he
[1:43:22] arose he said to Mary don't touch me I
[1:43:24] haven't me I haven't ascended yet and he
[1:43:27] rose up and he was accepted he came back
[1:43:29] down and said Thomas they said handle me
[1:43:32] touch me put your hand in my side and
[1:43:34] feel the nail holes in my hands cuz he
[1:43:37] was
[1:43:38] accepted you understand it's not you
[1:43:41] being accepted because he has accepted
[1:43:44] you're accepted because he now you
[1:43:48] understand what I saying because he is
[1:43:50] is accepted you're accepted amen because
[1:43:54] he is not because oh I need to be you
[1:43:57] know it says we're accepted in the
[1:43:58] Beloved I think it says in Ephesians 1
[1:44:01] because you're accepted in him because
[1:44:04] you've received him amen oh what about
[1:44:09] me just get into him cuz he has been
[1:44:12] received you understand
[1:44:17] hallelujah
[1:44:18] amen now I'll just I'm just going to
[1:44:20] close with a
[1:44:27] quote he says this so I can find
[1:44:31] it if I can't find it Well that's
[1:44:39] fine actually I can't find this oh it's
[1:44:42] right but he says now he says the blood
[1:44:45] of
[1:44:46] Jesus it cries out forgiveness and it
[1:44:49] gives pardon amen so when you really
[1:44:52] accept Christ God only sees the
[1:44:57] sacrifice that's why that's why I
[1:44:59] remember when brother baram he went into
[1:45:00] that um you it wasn't a bar your your
[1:45:04] your whatever it was and there were
[1:45:06] there was this old woman there and she
[1:45:08] was gambling things with theeman and and
[1:45:12] and um you know and they were smoking
[1:45:15] and she you know she's an old
[1:45:16] grandmother but she's trying to dress
[1:45:17] like she's 20 and he in his heart
[1:45:20] condemned woman you know she should know
[1:45:22] better and blah blah blah blah but then
[1:45:24] but then brother Braham had a vision now
[1:45:26] of the earth and there's a there blood
[1:45:29] barrier over the Earth sin like a dark
[1:45:33] streak would come off the Earth and it
[1:45:35] and and Jesus was hanging on the cross
[1:45:37] and it and it and it struck struck Jesus
[1:45:40] so it couldn't actually get to the
[1:45:41] throne of God Amen and so he began to
[1:45:46] see now that even even his sins did that
[1:45:49] because he's our
[1:45:51] barrier amen he's the one who who who
[1:45:53] stands in the gap for us amen and so he
[1:45:57] began to realize now you know that that
[1:46:01] because that is there for him as well
[1:46:04] and then his whole attitude changed
[1:46:05] towards the woman and then she spoke to
[1:46:08] him her to Christ right there amen and I
[1:46:12] say that all because he recognized there
[1:46:15] is a barrier amen there is a there is a
[1:46:18] blood barrier it's not it's not chemical
[1:46:21] blood you understand but there's a
[1:46:22] barrier amen that when you speak to God
[1:46:25] he doesn't see you he sees the he sees
[1:46:28] the offering in your
[1:46:30] place Hallelujah CU this is where we've
[1:46:33] come this is where we've come you know
[1:46:36] brother BR says in the church age book
[1:46:38] it's not works and the blood am mean
[1:46:41] salvation is not works and and the blood
[1:46:45] It Is by it is by the offering only am
[1:46:48] you're saved by grace remember works are
[1:46:50] just what you do because you love him
[1:46:53] and if it's out of love it's not works
[1:46:55] you understand because you're motivated
[1:46:57] by
[1:46:58] love amen so if you're motivated by love
[1:47:01] you just do it amen you it's like
[1:47:04] husband and wife why do you do things
[1:47:05] for each other because you're motivated
[1:47:07] by love amen and it's not well I did now
