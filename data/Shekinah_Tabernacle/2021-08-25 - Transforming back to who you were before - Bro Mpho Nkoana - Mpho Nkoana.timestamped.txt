[49:52] philippians chapter 2
[49:55] does anyone have their their bible amen
[49:59] you know sometimes

[50:06] say hey brother you jump you jumped a
[50:08] vest
[50:09] [Laughter]

[50:51] other other routes but that's where the
[50:54] real thought is
[50:55] just to fulfill you my joy that he be
[50:58] like-minded
[51:00] like whose mind who who who should we be
[51:03] like like-minded to who
[51:05] amen like the lord jesus christ amen
[51:08] having the same love that jesus christ
[51:10] have can you see having the same love
[51:14] being in one accord
[51:17] amen
[51:18] and then of one mind
[51:21] which is the mind of christ amen can we
[51:23] say praise the lord
[51:26] verse 3 let nothing be done through
[51:28] strife and vainglory
[51:31] but in loneliness of mind let each
[51:34] esteem other better than themselves
[51:38] amen
[51:39] look not every man
[51:41] on his own things
[51:43] but every man
[51:45] also
[51:47] on the things of
[51:48] others
[51:50] and we continue in verse 5
[51:54] let this mind be in you which was also
[51:57] in christ jesus
[52:00] let this mind
[52:02] which mind is that one
[52:05] we have just read
[52:06] the previous verse that let not every
[52:09] man on his uh let not every man on his
[52:12] own things but every man also on the
[52:15] things of others
[52:16] surely in the mind of the world i cannot
[52:19] count my things to be yours or your
[52:21] things to be mine
[52:23] but in the mind of god that we are
[52:26] reading here in verse 5
[52:28] the bible says let this mind be in
[52:30] you
[52:32] that my things are your things
[52:35] your things are my things amen that is
[52:37] the mind of christ
[52:39] amen are we together
[52:42] listen to verse five who being in the
[52:44] form of god thought it not be thought it
[52:48] not a robbery to be equal with god you
[52:51] see that is how the mind of god works
[52:54] the mind of god he being god he comes
[52:57] down to come and share with you
[53:00] he thought he was not robbing himself
[53:03] that is how the mind of god works surely
[53:05] if maybe it would have been any of us
[53:08] being in that position would have said
[53:10] ah
[53:11] human beings backslid
[53:13] let them sort themselves out down there
[53:15] with the devil on earth
[53:17] he said no ways
[53:19] because they are mind he thought in a
[53:22] different mind
[53:23] let's continue with that verse verse 7
[53:26] but made himself of no reputation
[53:30] and took up him upon him the form of a
[53:34] servant
[53:35] it was made in the likeness of moon
[53:39] and and being found in fashion as a man
[53:43] he humbled
[53:44] himself and became obedient unto death
[53:48] even the death of the cross
[53:50] wherefore god also had exalted him and
[53:54] given him a name which is about every
[53:57] name
[53:58] amen let us pray together
[54:00] praise the lord jesus
[54:03] father any man can open the scripture
[54:06] any man can be eloquent
[54:09] any man father god can read and page the
[54:12] bible

[54:15] gadgets this bible

[54:57] them but lord let them look and expect
[55:00] from you for lord if you use a stone
[55:03] or a piece of wood or if you can use a
[55:06] donkey to express your weight my father
[55:09] how much more about the human by the
[55:12] whom we have put your spirit in i pray
[55:14] that you help us father may you father
[55:17] god transform our attitude may you

[55:25] them in their respective families may
[55:27] you protect them lord god as we come
[55:30] fellowshipping around your weight we
[55:32] just want to commit ourselves lord jesus
[55:34] christ and i say father that if there's
[55:36] anywhere where we have displeased you my
[55:39] father my god where we have disappointed
[55:41] you father where we have let you down
[55:44] with our thoughts
[55:46] may you forgive us father
[55:48] ask you for your forgiveness we say
[55:51] father may you wash us clean with the
[55:53] blood father god that atonement

[55:59] can be ready so that we can be suitable
[56:02] to stand and sit in the altar and eat
[56:05] from your table i ask these things
[56:07] father not because we deserve it lord
[56:09] not because we are worthy but because
[56:11] you took the form of men
[56:14] and lord you came unto us
[56:16] i pray father god asking these things in
[56:18] the name of our lord jesus christ in
[56:20] thanksgiving i pray and the church say
[56:23] amen amen
[56:25] amen i believe you can enjoy the comfort
[56:27] of your couches oh yeah
[56:30] and then uh
[56:33] i was expecting
[56:34] to see a full house
[56:36] because we are at home we don't have to
[56:38] drive
[56:39] we don't have to
[56:41] paw patrol
[56:42] we only all we need to do is to open the
[56:44] computer and just click a button
[56:47] there we are on the screen so but
[56:50] nonetheless the bible says the footsteps
[56:52] of the righteous are ordered of the lord
[56:54] isn't it
[56:55] so
[56:56] we are not here by mistake we are here
[56:59] uh for a purpose amen
[57:02] so
[57:03] we have read about the mind of jesus
[57:05] christ and we want to speak about
[57:08] the title that says transforming back to
[57:11] who you were before amen so what i'm
[57:15] telling you is that now which means now
[57:17] we are actually uh not in our real form
[57:21] which means we are not in our real form
[57:24] if we are transforming back to where
[57:27] hallelujah
[57:29] so now we
[57:30] we want to read let's read the book of
[57:33] uh
[57:34] romans chapter 2
[57:37] and just enjoy reading the scripture
[57:39] there no one is in a rush
[57:41] are we
[57:42] we are in agreement
[57:44] tonight
[57:46] who is in a rush no one is in a right so
[57:48] we can talk
[57:50] speak until it's time for us to go to
[57:53] bed though we just moved from what's up
[57:55] i mean we just moved from zoom straight
[57:56] into our beds amen
[57:59] so let's read
[58:00] roman chapter two i'll go quickly i'll
[58:03] go fast so that
[58:05] uh i shouldn't
[58:07] bore you amen but the word of god is
[58:09] never blossom amen isn't it
[58:13] so from this one i see you therefore
[58:16] brethren
[58:17] by the message of god that you present
[58:19] yours your body is a living sacrifice
[58:24] sorry we are reading romans 2.
[58:27] sorry my mistake romans 12
[58:30] my mistakes sorry thank you one bible
[58:33] reader has corrected me this side
[58:37] sorry i omitted a one
[58:39] let me give you a chance to go to romans
[58:41] 12.
[58:42] romans 12 1. sorry my mistake apologies
[58:47] i believe you
[58:49] therefore brethren
[58:50] by the message of god
[58:52] that ye present your bodies a living
[58:55] sacrifice
[58:56] holy
[58:58] acceptable unto god
[59:00] which is your
[59:02] reasonable service
[59:06] so paul is asking a favor not a favor
[59:09] he's asking us
[59:11] to perform a reasonable service
[59:14] to present our bodies
[59:18] living sacrifice wholly
[59:21] acceptable to god
[59:23] amen a reasonable service there's two
[59:26] and a b
[59:28] not conformed to this world
[59:31] but be he transformed
[59:34] right be he transformed by the renewing
[59:37] of your mind
[59:39] that he
[59:40] he may prove that
[59:42] what is
[59:44] sorry that he may prove what is that
[59:46] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[59:50] god
[59:51] so this verse is asking us not to be
[59:54] conformed not to be complacent not to be
[59:58] in alignment with the world
[1:00:02] why why is asking us that because jesus
[1:00:05] christ came to the world but he was not
[1:00:08] like the world
[1:00:10] so he was already transformed
[1:00:13] right so
[1:00:15] he was transformed and he was coming to
[1:00:17] the earth to transform who us
[1:00:21] because brothers and sisters the true
[1:00:23] fact of the matter is that we
[1:00:25] along the
[1:00:27] big chain of events the devil came in
[1:00:31] and deformed us
[1:00:34] you will see as we get along
[1:00:36] now he came to transform us now that is
[1:00:39] why he's asking us not to conform to
[1:00:42] this world but to be transformed by the
[1:00:46] renewing of our mind
[1:00:49] how do you know our mind because my mind
[1:00:52] is the impact my mind is that is other
[1:00:55] than my soul my mind is the center of my
[1:00:58] thinking and my intelligence and my
[1:01:00] thoughts how can i renew it
[1:01:02] which means
[1:01:04] it takes another mind
[1:01:06] to renew my mind hallelujah
[1:01:08] another mind to renew my mind so i my
[1:01:12] mind i can't really knew myself
[1:01:14] jesus christ the one that we spoke about
[1:01:17] we read about in the previous in
[1:01:18] philippians that we must be
[1:01:21] like his mind so our mind must be
[1:01:24] transformed and renewed
[1:01:27] which means it takes god's mind to do
[1:01:29] that hallelujah amen let's go forward
[1:01:32] for i say
[1:01:34] through the grace given unto me that
[1:01:37] every man that is among you
[1:01:40] not to think of himself now paul is
[1:01:42] repeating this he was telling philip
[1:01:45] and now he's telling the romans but hey
[1:01:48] do not look yourself in your own eyes
[1:01:51] yeah
[1:01:52] look yourself in the eyes of others look
[1:01:55] at yourself as yourself as a part of the
[1:01:58] bigger body
[1:01:59] because you are not alone amen
[1:02:02] so so the head will look at to the to
[1:02:05] the hand and look it doesn't look as
[1:02:08] itself as the whole body not just as the
[1:02:10] head in a little island it looks at that
[1:02:13] body so that is the that is what paul is
[1:02:15] trying to tell
[1:02:17] uh
[1:02:17] that the romans and he also told philly
[1:02:20] so i want us to go faster for i say
[1:02:21] through the grace given unto me
[1:02:24] to every man that is among you not to
[1:02:26] think of himself more highly than he
[1:02:29] ought to think
[1:02:30] that's a very challenging statement
[1:02:33] because
[1:02:34] the days that we are living in are the
[1:02:36] days of looking putting myself higher on
[1:02:38] a pedestal and putting everybody below
[1:02:41] these are the days and that's the spirit
[1:02:43] so now he says no no let not none of you
[1:02:48] esteem
[1:02:49] themselves higher than others more than
[1:02:52] how you are supposed to
[1:02:54] but
[1:02:56] overly you know when you think so badly
[1:02:58] we say when someone is drunk we say they
[1:03:00] are not sober now on the canal mind it
[1:03:03] is drunk you can't think so badly you
[1:03:05] can't think straight now if if you are
[1:03:09] sober you think straight you think you
[1:03:11] don't you don't you don't mix things
[1:03:14] things are not slow and you just see
[1:03:16] this computer moving that you say i know
[1:03:19] this person must be drunk because you're
[1:03:20] not sober so the bible says you must
[1:03:23] think so badly
[1:03:25] according as god has dealt to every man
[1:03:28] the measure of faith
[1:03:30] for for us we have many members in one
[1:03:33] body you see that's what i was talking
[1:03:35] about and all members have not the same
[1:03:37] office
[1:03:39] we have not the same office to take it
[1:03:41] further we can say we have not the same
[1:03:43] function
[1:03:44] each and every part of the body is
[1:03:47] important in its own right
[1:03:50] therefore it is important that a truth
[1:03:53] must look at the tongue and have respect
[1:03:56] for the tongue and so the tongue must do
[1:03:58] the same
[1:03:59] right and also the feet the hands
[1:04:03] everything must look at the body not
[1:04:06] just itself individually because we've
[1:04:08] got we don't have the same office we
[1:04:10] don't have the same function
[1:04:13] let's continue them so we being many
[1:04:18] are one body in christ and every member
[1:04:21] one of another which means we are joined
[1:04:24] up together right each and everyone is a
[1:04:26] part so you cannot look at me and say ah
[1:04:30] but this hand why is he doing this but
[1:04:32] this i no no i'm part of the body
[1:04:34] now
[1:04:35] i don't want to deviate now heaven there
[1:04:38] then gives differing according to the
[1:04:40] grace which means you've got different
[1:04:41] gifts different so all those things we
[1:04:43] know we have so but the point is this
[1:04:46] that according to the grace that is
[1:04:47] given unto us whether prophecy let us
[1:04:50] prophesy according to the proportion of
[1:04:52] faith or ministry let us wait on our
[1:04:56] ministering or he that teaches on
[1:04:59] teaching or he that exalted or our own
[1:05:03] exhortation he give it let him do with
[1:05:06] it with simplicity right not wanting to
[1:05:09] be seen not wanting to be placed just in
[1:05:12] simple in a simple way you know he that
[1:05:14] you left with diligence he that showed
[1:05:17] mercy with cheerfulness
[1:05:19] let love be without the simulation
[1:05:22] you see the way the simulation i was
[1:05:24] reading and i intrigued how i was soaked
[1:05:28] i was so and what's the word curious to
[1:05:32] to understand the way the simulation you
[1:05:33] see it means the simulation it means
[1:05:35] disguise
[1:05:37] you say let our love not be disguised
[1:05:40] well when i come with the simulation you
[1:05:42] what you see is not actually the reality
[1:05:45] that it is inside me but outside i i
[1:05:49] show something else
[1:05:50] let our love not be like them let our
[1:05:53] love be real love we are talking about
[1:05:56] spawning our minds we are talking about
[1:05:59] being transformed because originally
[1:06:03] like this
[1:06:04] are we together
[1:06:06] above that
[1:06:08] a point you know when you say something
[1:06:10] is
[1:06:12] is appalling
[1:06:13] i'm not saying about means apolly but
[1:06:15] when you say that that just reminded me
[1:06:17] of the word appalling above that which
[1:06:20] is evil cleave to that which is good be
[1:06:23] kindly affecting one to another
[1:06:26] with brotherly love
[1:06:28] in honor preferring one another
[1:06:32] no not slothfulness in business
[1:06:35] fervent in spirit saving the lord so the
[1:06:39] lord the bible is covering everything
[1:06:41] but hey when we say we work we work
[1:06:43] there's no one who's going to see there
[1:06:45] and not want to do work and only others
[1:06:47] are what kind of a body that will be we
[1:06:50] must not be slothful in business
[1:06:53] that you must also not be slaughterful
[1:06:55] in the spirit
[1:06:56] you know there is a critical
[1:06:58] slothfulness and there is a spiritual
[1:07:00] slaughterfulness
[1:07:03] that's what we are not supposed you're
[1:07:05] not supposed to be that way but that's
[1:07:07] not the subject for today
[1:07:08] now
[1:07:09] uh i'm not gonna read this one i'm gonna
[1:07:11] jump quickly
[1:07:13] to
[1:07:15] a first quote
[1:07:17] now brother
[1:07:19] in this quote
[1:07:20] says
[1:07:22] he says
[1:07:25] for the lord truly
[1:07:27] that's why we come on these hot days
[1:07:30] speak to us through daily the prophet is
[1:07:34] praying here right
[1:07:36] but the lord truly that's why we come on
[1:07:38] this hot day speak to us through thy
[1:07:40] living and let the living word dwell in
[1:07:43] us and abide in us
[1:07:45] that we might be shaped and
[1:07:49] formed
[1:07:50] not to the world but be transformed by
[1:07:54] the renewing of our spirit into the form
[1:07:57] of the son of god remember i told you
[1:07:59] that the son of god came here
[1:08:02] him he was not a sinner but he came to
[1:08:04] the sinners the purpose was to transform
[1:08:08] the cinnamon back to be the way he used
[1:08:11] to be
[1:08:13] are we together
[1:08:15] amen my friend now all our hearts
[1:08:19] tremble when we think and the joy of
[1:08:21] flats
[1:08:22] and the joy flies our soul to know that
[1:08:25] we can be called sons and daughters of
[1:08:27] god hallelujah amen he stands on the
[1:08:30] very brim of his second coming and all
[1:08:33] nations and kingdoms quivering under the
[1:08:35] feet all things of the world is
[1:08:38] vanishing but knowing that someday he
[1:08:40] will come and shake
[1:08:42] and take us to a kingdom where there
[1:08:46] shall never be an end or it will never
[1:08:49] be moved you see he's coming to
[1:08:51] transform us so that he can take us back
[1:08:54] to the kingdom
[1:08:57] while we must be transformed
[1:08:59] now i'll show you now
[1:09:01] that why
[1:09:03] i'll come back to code number two but i
[1:09:05] just want to say i'll i'll come back to
[1:09:08] this one let's let's just go through
[1:09:10] some of my comments here
[1:09:12] when we look in the book of genesis we
[1:09:14] find out that um
[1:09:16] from the beginning
[1:09:17] the bible teaches us that the word was
[1:09:19] without form
[1:09:20] you see the word was without form and
[1:09:23] that there was darkness was upon the
[1:09:25] face of the deep and the bible says but
[1:09:27] the spirit of god was upon it isn't it
[1:09:30] how many of you remember this hallelujah
[1:09:32] so now but god the spirit of god started
[1:09:36] the process of transforming
[1:09:38] right god started to transform it and
[1:09:42] the prophet says he transformed it with
[1:09:44] his faith with his word he he started to
[1:09:48] transform me by faith through revelation
[1:09:51] he transformed it because he had
[1:09:52] thoughts in his mind and he said oh i
[1:09:55] want to do something and then thoughts
[1:09:57] went in his mind and because god's
[1:09:59] thoughts are real you see god's thoughts
[1:10:02] are
[1:10:03] are not like uh our carnal thoughts when
[1:10:06] i
[1:10:07] my thought can be maybe a theory or it
[1:10:10] may not be real or it can just be an
[1:10:12] imagination but god's thought when he
[1:10:14] thinks that thought is as good is real
[1:10:17] is more real than this bottle right yeah
[1:10:20] a thought of god is very real that the
[1:10:23] moment he thinks that thought is eternal
[1:10:28] amen how many believe that so
[1:10:31] to transform the world the earth the
[1:10:34] cosmos you know this physical thing and
[1:10:37] then and then and then he he started to
[1:10:39] transform it and then he put the seeds
[1:10:42] he said let there be light and there was
[1:10:44] light and everything then the bible says
[1:10:46] he he put the seeds
[1:10:48] all the things that he put there those
[1:10:50] things were good and some of them were
[1:10:53] evil
[1:10:55] and those things were there because
[1:10:57] before the
[1:10:58] enemy called the devil
[1:11:00] he
[1:11:01] like slid he used to be called lucifer
[1:11:04] so that is where this all these evils
[1:11:07] came to be and now when gods are there
[1:11:09] to put everything together then all sins
[1:11:12] were put there and then god said let
[1:11:15] every seed bring his own kind
[1:11:18] right are we together
[1:11:20] so that it was from that point that now
[1:11:24] no no
[1:11:25] now every seed had to bring his own kind
[1:11:28] and then bring the fruits of his own
[1:11:30] kind hallelujah
[1:11:31] so now now god
[1:11:34] in the garden of eden
[1:11:36] maybe what i've just said now explain to
[1:11:38] you about the putting of the seeds and
[1:11:40] creation if you can just put what i'm
[1:11:42] about to say first now
[1:11:44] god and in the garden of eden god
[1:11:47] uh said to adam
[1:11:49] and and and and he put adam and eve in
[1:11:52] the garden let me read for you what the
[1:11:54] prophet says here
[1:11:59] now
[1:12:01] let's read this one first quote number
[1:12:02] two now this word transformed i looked
[1:12:05] up in the dictionary yesterday this is
[1:12:06] the prophet when i almost lost track
[1:12:10] of
[1:12:11] that i was to be up here
[1:12:13] when i was looking for a text and i
[1:12:15] found this word
[1:12:16] or this text
[1:12:18] rather scripture and in the dictionary
[1:12:20] it says that is something that's changed
[1:12:24] it it is to be changed transformed made
[1:12:27] different than what it was it's been is
[1:12:31] a character and everything has been
[1:12:33] changed in it to transform
[1:12:36] is to change you see now
[1:12:40] uh now now what i wanted to tell you was
[1:12:42] that now every every every part of our
[1:12:45] body every part of our our existence
[1:12:48] amen has to be transformed our body our
[1:12:51] spirit our mind our soul everything
[1:12:54] our flesh
[1:12:56] subject
[1:12:57] to what is inside this remember we said
[1:13:00] we spoke about the seed that god put
[1:13:02] inside so our our flesh is supposed to
[1:13:05] be subject to the inside seat and
[1:13:08] manifest or show the real seat who i was
[1:13:11] before
[1:13:12] are we together
[1:13:16] i understand that this flesh is not
[1:13:18] a believer
[1:13:20] this flesh is a sinner
[1:13:22] but it becomes subject to what is inside
[1:13:25] to the
[1:13:26] seat the real me inside are we together
[1:13:29] yeah now every part of our body has to
[1:13:32] be transformed that is why we don't do
[1:13:34] everything we are not like the world we
[1:13:36] are not conforming we don't eat what
[1:13:38] they eat we don't drink what they drink
[1:13:40] we don't talk the way they talk we don't
[1:13:42] walk the way they walk
[1:13:44] now because we are transformed and that
[1:13:47] shows in our spirit that shows in our
[1:13:49] flesh
[1:13:51] the moment we do the things that the
[1:13:54] world does
[1:13:56] which are not
[1:13:57] of god we are conforming to the world
[1:14:01] we are disappointing our savior but we
[1:14:04] cannot be conformed to the world amen
[1:14:09] and every seed after his kind god placed
[1:14:12] all the seeds through his weight right
[1:14:14] and all what is happening is
[1:14:16] every seed is bringing his kind
[1:14:19] let's just pause there
[1:14:20] i want to open here and say
[1:14:23] quote number three now god in six
[1:14:26] thousand years he planted all these
[1:14:28] wonderful seeds
[1:14:30] and
[1:14:32] his way
[1:14:33] it shall be this way this tree shall be
[1:14:37] this shall be everything was perfect
[1:14:40] it was good and he commanded each one of
[1:14:44] those seeds
[1:14:45] that they will be
[1:14:48] they will transform themselves
[1:14:51] into the plant we of which kind of life
[1:14:54] that the word of god is spoken in them
[1:14:57] now
[1:14:58] because god's power is able to transform
[1:15:01] god's word because
[1:15:04] that is a
[1:15:05] god planted and then there is a seed
[1:15:07] where that god put
[1:15:09] the life the seed gene of life he put in
[1:15:12] each and every seed of all those seeds
[1:15:14] that he planted now it those seeds are
[1:15:17] each and every seed was able to
[1:15:20] transform itself to show what was in the
[1:15:23] mind of god because the real seed of god
[1:15:26] is the real seed for god is his word
[1:15:29] are we together because the prophet
[1:15:31] taught us that the spoken word is the
[1:15:33] original seed so now the real seed is
[1:15:37] the word of god but now because the word
[1:15:39] of god is inside that seed
[1:15:41] that the physical seed or any seed
[1:15:44] whether of a tree whatever human being
[1:15:47] anything the weather the seed gene of
[1:15:49] god is inside there and god said it must
[1:15:51] come up so it transformed itself
[1:15:54] itself then it starts to grow then we
[1:15:57] start to see oh that's brought on person
[1:15:59] ah that's that's
[1:16:01] that's that's a grape tree it is called
[1:16:04] grape grapefruits oh that is salt and
[1:16:07] salt because now of the seed gene that
[1:16:09] was put inside right
[1:16:12] so now
[1:16:14] he commanded each one of those seeds
[1:16:16] that they will be transformed themselves
[1:16:17] into the plant which of which whatever
[1:16:19] kind amen
[1:16:21] now if it was not an oak tree if it was
[1:16:24] an oak tree it was to bring forth an oak
[1:16:27] if it was a pound it was to bring forth
[1:16:29] a pound the seed of god will transform
[1:16:32] itself according to what god saw it say
[1:16:35] and the word says the word seed was
[1:16:38] there before the word seed was there
[1:16:40] before the real seed was was was was
[1:16:43] was ever formed
[1:16:45] what i said was the word spoken where is
[1:16:48] the original seed so the real seed is
[1:16:50] the word of god so it was there and the
[1:16:52] word formed the seed see he made the
[1:16:54] world out of things that does not appear
[1:16:57] see he he made the world by his own word
[1:17:02] his own seed weight and then god spoke
[1:17:05] everything into existence
[1:17:07] now let's hear what let's hear let's
[1:17:09] hear what the prophet will say further
[1:17:11] here
[1:17:12] and and now that means that
[1:17:15] each and every seed must come to its own
[1:17:18] manifestation it is effective of what
[1:17:21] kind of acidities but the prophet says
[1:17:23] all of the seeds at the beginning were
[1:17:26] wonderful seeds everything was okay
[1:17:29] everything was good and perfect and the
[1:17:31] lord had it in his mind that is going to
[1:17:34] come the way that he saw it right and
[1:17:37] then put them under all he care he put
[1:17:39] them now
[1:17:41] under the care of somebody
[1:17:43] he created adam
[1:17:45] and then he put also under uh uh
[1:17:48] the care adam and his wife he put them
[1:17:50] in the garden of eden to look after
[1:17:52] these seas
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:55] and then he created a place called eden
[1:17:58] how many have heard of eden before then
[1:18:00] he made a garden called eden he said
[1:18:02] okay you guys are going to look at this
[1:18:04] you see here he he put them also under a
[1:18:07] cab of the same thing that that that he
[1:18:09] put his animals and so forth his way
[1:18:12] they must not
[1:18:14] never by no means break that weight amen
[1:18:17] so everything was supposed to work
[1:18:19] according to god's way according to plan
[1:18:22] and it was bound to to function like
[1:18:24] this because god's way does not fail
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:27] so he said don't ever take anything from
[1:18:30] it there must be a sorry where am i i'm
[1:18:33] here they must say stay there don't
[1:18:35] never take anything from it or eat
[1:18:38] anything from it you must live by his
[1:18:40] word
[1:18:41] now those are all the seas that that's
[1:18:43] how we were supposed to come about
[1:18:45] and
[1:18:46] i have put tasks in my son now now god
[1:18:49] talking i've put trust in my son and his
[1:18:52] wife
[1:18:52] that they will they will make head of
[1:18:55] it and that they will watch over it all
[1:18:58] and see that it will all is all right
[1:19:00] that everything will bring forth of his
[1:19:02] kind that was adam and eve right god had
[1:19:06] never changed that's the same today as
[1:19:09] he was then god is determined to do
[1:19:11] something he'll do it nothing is going
[1:19:13] to stop him right as he said
[1:19:16] right now the problem
[1:19:18] after all these things that has been
[1:19:20] made after all this creation after all
[1:19:23] the good things that were coming to
[1:19:24] bring the good seas and to show the
[1:19:26] lions will bring lions the palm tree
[1:19:29] will bring a palm tree the humans are
[1:19:31] supposed to bring human according to
[1:19:34] their kind
[1:19:35] now everything was set up it was
[1:19:37] beautiful the prophet in one area he
[1:19:39] says the headquarters of that whole
[1:19:41] creation was hidden
[1:19:43] and he put his son and his and his
[1:19:45] daughter there and his wife there to
[1:19:48] look after it
[1:19:49] now
[1:19:50] problem started when another guy
[1:19:53] called lucifer
[1:19:56] came on board
[1:19:58] that's where the problem started
[1:20:00] now that man he's not a transformer like
[1:20:03] god he's called a deformer
[1:20:07] he's a perverter you see so yeah
[1:20:11] i i put here the deformer using his
[1:20:13] power to deform
[1:20:15] specializes in twisting the weight or
[1:20:18] the seed of god a little bit
[1:20:21] huh
[1:20:22] it does not look like he's a little bit
[1:20:24] to me
[1:20:25] but the prophet says he twisted a little
[1:20:28] bit
[1:20:29] this comes to me it comes very close to
[1:20:31] us as christians as believers because
[1:20:34] if the devil twists the word of god so
[1:20:37] obvious and so clear man you will be
[1:20:40] able to see that
[1:20:42] the devil is lying so
[1:20:44] a little bit the bible says i mean the
[1:20:46] prophet says
[1:20:47] until it is fully perverted so he
[1:20:50] twisted a little bit
[1:20:53] uh
[1:20:54] and then
[1:20:55] you don't realize it then he tasted a
[1:20:57] little bit
[1:20:59] to be further
[1:21:00] further further further until it is
[1:21:04] miles and miles away
[1:21:07] from the original
[1:21:10] production of it what it was supposed to
[1:21:12] manifest can you see he does not taste
[1:21:15] it like
[1:21:17] twisted
[1:21:18] no he knows that it won't work
[1:21:20] in any case he will never be able to
[1:21:23] twist the seat of god completely
[1:21:26] and change the nature of god all he will
[1:21:29] see that he's doing he's hybridizing
[1:21:32] even on the canal side he's hybridizing
[1:21:35] and doing all sorts of things but he'll
[1:21:37] never be able to completely change an
[1:21:40] orange from becoming an orange to be
[1:21:42] something else
[1:21:44] as long as that orange is an original
[1:21:46] seed he can only mix it and hybrid it
[1:21:49] and do all sorts of things so the same
[1:21:51] thing goes to a believer a son and a
[1:21:54] daughter of god he will never be able to
[1:21:57] deform you completely
[1:21:59] because you are a seed of god
[1:22:02] because
[1:22:03] the word of god he can only try to
[1:22:06] deform you a little bit the prophet says
[1:22:10] and then you don't realize it he
[1:22:12] deformed a little bit just like he did
[1:22:14] to eve
[1:22:15] he came and said no no no no no no no no
[1:22:19] god does not mean it that way
[1:22:22] god just means that you cannot be wise
[1:22:26] really surely die
[1:22:28] let me show you
[1:22:30] um
[1:22:31] i know this thing i i i worked with god
[1:22:34] i i was very close and he told him
[1:22:37] just a little bit not too much
[1:22:41] then if agreed then he went further a
[1:22:44] little bit by the time he realizes that
[1:22:48] she is lost
[1:22:49] he was not where the devil started he
[1:22:52] was way far
[1:22:53] he was very far
[1:22:55] she was already pregnant with cain at
[1:22:57] that time
[1:22:58] by the time she realizes it but god said
[1:23:01] no don't even touch it
[1:23:04] but the devil twisted the weight a
[1:23:06] little bit
[1:23:07] a little bit a little bit
[1:23:10] and there was a deformed deformation
[1:23:14] now watch
[1:23:16] here
[1:23:18] okay let me go back check a little bit
[1:23:20] until it's fully perverted he comes in
[1:23:22] ways that you may not think is the devil
[1:23:25] he comes in very subtle way now watch
[1:23:28] him in in his message twist that word
[1:23:31] just a little bit saying if said for god
[1:23:34] said that if we do this uh that that day
[1:23:37] would we die if says no devil god says
[1:23:40] if we do this we will die he said oh
[1:23:42] surely you will not die
[1:23:45] you will not die see he he was a man you
[1:23:48] see and and you do this now
[1:23:51] now god
[1:23:54] gives his weight
[1:23:55] and god finds it exactly the way he put
[1:23:58] it i'm busy checking my time also so now
[1:24:02] all your cultures the prophet says all
[1:24:04] the cultures all the powers
[1:24:07] all the signs
[1:24:09] everything
[1:24:10] on this earth is part of the deformed
[1:24:14] earth of the devil but when he started
[1:24:17] he said he will surely die
[1:24:19] but now we die we kill one another now
[1:24:21] we get sick
[1:24:23] now we are away from god why why why did
[1:24:26] we go so far when he said no you're not
[1:24:28] that much not that
[1:24:30] wise you'll be clever you'll know better
[1:24:34] how far now all these cultures hello
[1:24:38] my culture every culture
[1:24:43] is of the devil because it came through
[1:24:46] knowledge it came through science
[1:24:49] orthodox science traditional science now
[1:24:52] we there's a culture that we are going
[1:24:55] back to that we are being transformed
[1:24:58] into
[1:24:59] we are currently almost done right now
[1:25:02] we are almost there amen he's getting
[1:25:05] transformed
[1:25:07] do not be left behind
[1:25:11] now that the former i know it seems it
[1:25:14] seems to be rather strange to speak uh
[1:25:16] or to speak it in this way
[1:25:18] to to deform but that's what he was he
[1:25:21] deformed he perverted pervert means to
[1:25:25] change to be changed over
[1:25:27] listen to this
[1:25:29] the prophet said
[1:25:31] formation i mean to transform is to
[1:25:34] change over
[1:25:35] now
[1:25:36] to pervert he says here is to be changed
[1:25:39] over is in other words you are looking
[1:25:42] this way
[1:25:43] then he makes it look that way
[1:25:46] change over same thing pervert
[1:25:49] and transform
[1:25:50] the results are the same
[1:25:54] but just that one is on to the bedside
[1:25:57] another one is on to the good side
[1:26:01] pervasion or to pervert or to deform is
[1:26:05] the opposite of transformed so god put
[1:26:08] his
[1:26:09] nature he puts everything there then the
[1:26:11] devil changes it he prevent it because
[1:26:14] he can create amen
[1:26:16] and before
[1:26:17] the same thing that's been brought over
[1:26:20] and deformed and made in another way
[1:26:23] just to be made in another way yet still
[1:26:26] the same seed
[1:26:27] is being deformed the point i'm trying
[1:26:30] to show is that he's not bringing a new
[1:26:32] seed he's not bringing any new theme of
[1:26:35] himself he's just taking the same human
[1:26:38] being the same son or daughter of god
[1:26:41] and perverse them and deform them are we
[1:26:43] together
[1:26:45] i'll show you something now
[1:26:48] i'll show you some pictures now and we
[1:26:51] we we we are all still in the image of
[1:26:53] god
[1:26:54] yeah the fact that
[1:26:56] some of our friends of people that we
[1:26:58] know or unbelievers are
[1:27:00] uh it does not mean that they are not in
[1:27:02] the image of god
[1:27:04] you see they are still in the image of
[1:27:06] god but some are so deformed a sons of
[1:27:10] god that contrary to his word and to the
[1:27:13] way that that he he helped us and
[1:27:16] provided for us to all
[1:27:18] you see
[1:27:19] there are still god's people he created
[1:27:22] them but they have been perverted
[1:27:25] they've been deformed and you'll see now
[1:27:27] that the reason they are
[1:27:30] some don't get transformed it is
[1:27:32] primarily because the seed that is in
[1:27:35] there
[1:27:36] has been temporary it's not the seed of
[1:27:39] god it is the devil has as
[1:27:42] i don't want to say a better way but he
[1:27:44] has already he has dynasty it's not the
[1:27:46] seat of god the true seat of god
[1:27:49] can be transformed back
[1:27:52] to the original where it was amen that
[1:27:55] is why you are where you are today
[1:28:00] are sitting where you are listening to a
[1:28:02] man talking about telling you about who
[1:28:04] you were before and you
[1:28:07] being in a process of metamorphosis you
[1:28:09] know metaphors being
[1:28:12] transformed is where you used to be
[1:28:16] with you now you are in a process of
[1:28:19] being transformed to who
[1:28:21] you were before
[1:28:24] but it's not safe that is going to be
[1:28:26] transformed some spirit will be
[1:28:28] transformed not into what god wants or
[1:28:31] into the the image of god some seeds
[1:28:33] will only transport to be transformed to
[1:28:36] like the evil the evil seed because
[1:28:39] there's a separation from the beginning
[1:28:40] isn't it right now
[1:28:43] i want to move on quickly with speed
[1:28:44] here and and show you this
[1:28:47] um
[1:28:50] here let me read this first searching
[1:28:52] something the world twists us out of the
[1:28:54] way pulls us close to it and away from
[1:28:58] that straight narrow strip that he
[1:29:00] planted us in to be sons and daughters
[1:29:02] of god sin has done this evil thing to
[1:29:05] the sons and the daughters of god
[1:29:07] he has done it the devil came and wanted
[1:29:09] to to deform the whole world if you look
[1:29:12] at this tomato
[1:29:14] you'll see that another another one is
[1:29:17] deformed
[1:29:19] and another one
[1:29:21] is transformed
[1:29:23] it is in its original state
[1:29:26] can you see
[1:29:28] but you can see that the one that is
[1:29:30] deformed you can see that that's a
[1:29:31] tomato
[1:29:33] you cannot see that's a tomato you can't
[1:29:35] say tomato but it is
[1:29:37] deformed but we need to be taken to the
[1:29:41] one on our right
[1:29:43] are we together amen
[1:29:45] in the original state
[1:29:48] now it does not take me
[1:29:51] it does not take you it does not take no
[1:29:53] one it takes the lord jesus himself
[1:29:56] because
[1:29:58] the first adam he failed
[1:30:01] but the second the second adam he's not
[1:30:03] going to fail
[1:30:11] cannot fail
[1:30:12] the ministry of the second eve is the
[1:30:15] second one cannot say he cannot fall for
[1:30:18] the lie of the devil this earth cannot
[1:30:20] fail this bread cannot fail that's what
[1:30:23] the adam did not fail so he's here to
[1:30:26] transform us to bring us back because
[1:30:30] the first adam failed
[1:30:32] amen look at this one
[1:30:36] can you see little ones
[1:30:38] even even our canal eyes when you when
[1:30:41] if i can ask you which one can you
[1:30:42] choose definitely
[1:30:44] you
[1:30:45] choose the one on the right if i can ask
[1:30:47] malakai then i say my friend which one
[1:30:49] would you like jonah
[1:30:51] then he will choose a beautiful corn
[1:30:53] there on our right he'll even take two
[1:30:56] because it is in its original state it
[1:30:59] is likable it is how it is supposed to
[1:31:02] be
[1:31:05] go back a little bit to the slide that i
[1:31:07] wanted to read for you
[1:31:09] uh of course number two was it code
[1:31:11] number two
[1:31:13] now
[1:31:15] oh no i've already read this one for you
[1:31:17] which one was it
[1:31:20] it's okay and
[1:31:22] now
[1:31:24] i'm copying my pasta now he said he also
[1:31:26] moves around a lot so
[1:31:31] now
[1:31:32] uh
[1:31:34] now
[1:31:35] after after all this this this
[1:31:38] deformation that the devil has done
[1:31:41] you know
[1:31:43] god created the garden of eden putin's
[1:31:45] son and his son failed because of the
[1:31:46] devil and now every seat now was
[1:31:49] deformed well i mean was affected by
[1:31:51] some form of a deformation and then now
[1:31:54] and he has caused a mess and he has
[1:31:56] taken he has taken six thousand years
[1:31:58] the prophet said to deform the whole
[1:32:00] world today he's got what we call his
[1:32:02] own eden what we are here now we are in
[1:32:05] satan's eating
[1:32:07] this is how the devil has deformed it so
[1:32:10] now
[1:32:10] now
[1:32:11] each and every one of those god took six
[1:32:13] thousand years or six thousand six six
[1:32:15] years six days the devil also took six
[1:32:18] days all of them
[1:32:19] six six so now
[1:32:22] god because his word can never fail he's
[1:32:26] got inside his way there's a power of
[1:32:28] transformation now he's a journey
[1:32:32] a journey of transformation because why
[1:32:36] it is impossible for god to fail
[1:32:39] it is it is impossible
[1:32:41] every seat must bring its own kind he
[1:32:43] said at the beginning that's what he
[1:32:45] said now he realized that the enemy the
[1:32:48] deformer has come and deformed this
[1:32:50] thing now there must be a plan there
[1:32:52] must be a way to bring that wisdom
[1:32:55] according to what god has said
[1:32:57] and then you come to what you call god's
[1:33:00] plan of redemption
[1:33:02] you see now god now start a journey to
[1:33:06] transform the seas that were there
[1:33:10] then he started he brings a plan of
[1:33:12] redemption
[1:33:13] as i said he comes down here to earth
[1:33:15] because it is impossible for his weight
[1:33:18] not to happen the way he said it is
[1:33:21] impossible for god's thoughts not to
[1:33:23] come to pass
[1:33:25] first transform
[1:33:26] will transform the earth into another
[1:33:29] eden
[1:33:30] now brother andy likes to say now we are
[1:33:33] now even so we are already
[1:33:35] in an idiotic condition
[1:33:38] we are already there in any condition we
[1:33:40] can almost almost see garden of eden
[1:33:44] opening we can almost see we can smell
[1:33:47] the fragrance of the flowers in the
[1:33:50] garden of eden because that's where we
[1:33:52] originally were
[1:33:54] transformed when when something is being
[1:33:56] transformed i don't know if you have
[1:33:57] ever seen a chicken
[1:33:59] hatching
[1:34:01] those who have experienced it you'll see
[1:34:03] the more that little peak is is hitting
[1:34:06] on the shell the more it's about to come
[1:34:08] out you know what the excitement gets
[1:34:10] higher and stronger
[1:34:13] you know so i guess it's push and kick
[1:34:16] the closer it gets to the to the
[1:34:17] breaking of the shell
[1:34:19] if we get to the rapture the harder we
[1:34:22] must kick
[1:34:25] that we are in now so now we must be
[1:34:28] like that little chicken that is almost
[1:34:30] transformed
[1:34:32] hitting me too late
[1:34:35] in the
[1:34:36] egg it's almost breaking
[1:34:39] the sun
[1:34:41] of righteousness is almost on the rise
[1:34:43] we can see
[1:34:45] the more it gets darker the more
[1:34:47] darkness into the world comes the more
[1:34:50] clearer and clearer we see because we
[1:34:53] are in a different realm
[1:34:54] we are in the different the darker the
[1:34:57] world gets it brings us happiness and
[1:34:59] excitement because hey we know we are
[1:35:02] almost there
[1:35:03] we are home
[1:35:05] now he is going to transform
[1:35:08] time
[1:35:10] into timeless
[1:35:13] i was preparing something on the table
[1:35:15] and my family jesus saw me laughing and
[1:35:18] and they were wondering what is
[1:35:20] happening with me because something said
[1:35:22] to me the time allocated to time is over
[1:35:26] time is allocated time is getting to end
[1:35:29] to an end
[1:35:31] but no more time brothers and sisters so
[1:35:34] we need to be ready to realize that
[1:35:37] we cannot depend on time for we don't
[1:35:40] can even time itself has got no more
[1:35:42] time
[1:35:44] hallelujah
[1:35:46] and full of sin
[1:35:48] will be transformed into transformed
[1:35:50] into a sinless world
[1:35:52] ah
[1:35:53] we are going to a new world
[1:35:55] where there's no more sin
[1:35:58] amen
[1:35:59] that ever since we were born
[1:36:02] our forefathers have to adam whom we
[1:36:05] have never seen without physical eyes
[1:36:07] everything is coming to an end to change
[1:36:10] to take us back where we used to be
[1:36:16] transformed into sinless minds
[1:36:19] that's where we are going in fact
[1:36:22] as we are there already because we are
[1:36:25] living already in the bright age we are
[1:36:28] living in this earth but we are not of
[1:36:30] this world
[1:36:32] we are living in this world but we are
[1:36:34] walking like kings
[1:36:36] and queens on this world
[1:36:39] amen
[1:36:41] like-minded believer who is continually
[1:36:44] in the spirit you see is a believer who
[1:36:47] is transforming the mind whose mind is
[1:36:50] getting transformed he is always christ
[1:36:53] like-minded he's always talking working
[1:36:57] thinking like christ
[1:37:00] you will never
[1:37:02] if it happens that's not for him he'll
[1:37:04] quickly fix it if there's anything wrong
[1:37:07] if there's anything that the devil can
[1:37:09] pass through you know you know when you
[1:37:11] you've got a tv and you want to put the
[1:37:12] channel some somehow sometimes another
[1:37:15] channel just come through and that's not
[1:37:16] the channel you want
[1:37:18] you say ah you just press the remote
[1:37:19] quickly and pass that channel because
[1:37:21] that's not what you want sometimes we go
[1:37:23] through dangerous areas we walk through
[1:37:27] the value of the shadow of them
[1:37:30] and the bible says we shall not fear
[1:37:33] amen
[1:37:34] for his lord and his staff
[1:37:37] hallelujah so sometimes even if a
[1:37:40] believer do a mistake or the wrong thing
[1:37:43] you must not look to that believer
[1:37:45] through that the eyes of that mistake
[1:37:47] because you shall behind
[1:37:50] you will be looking at somebody who
[1:37:52] makes a mistake and you are long left
[1:37:54] behind
[1:37:55] that brother is in the process of
[1:37:57] transformation
[1:37:59] he has passed already that sister do not
[1:38:02] be looking at you ah he did this and
[1:38:04] that no no no no you that is for god and
[1:38:07] for him to sort out the prophet says
[1:38:10] look to him in the eyes of jesus because
[1:38:13] jesus when he left heaven
[1:38:16] we were filthy and sinners
[1:38:19] come to those kinds of people because he
[1:38:22] did not look to us
[1:38:23] in the eyes of sin
[1:38:25] he saw us in our original form
[1:38:29] oh my they're not aware let me make them
[1:38:32] aware that they can be transformed that
[1:38:35] they can get back to where they are they
[1:38:37] are in a in a situation you know in
[1:38:40] english there's a word called
[1:38:43] so so some non-believe is it the right
[1:38:46] way
[1:38:47] you know when when when you are
[1:38:49] you are lost
[1:38:51] in nature
[1:38:53] huh when when when amnesia and amnesia
[1:38:56] is amnesia's another way you know you
[1:38:58] are in there in an amnesia state he came
[1:39:01] to reverse that because amnesia is part
[1:39:04] and parcel of the deformer tactics
[1:39:08] so if there's an amnesia he is coming to
[1:39:12] do the opposite of amnesia
[1:39:14] you see for me and for you to see and to
[1:39:16] know that ah
[1:39:18] and now we know even so all you're
[1:39:21] waiting for is to take your flight over
[1:39:26] the pilot is ready
[1:39:28] all of us our seat belts are tightened
[1:39:30] the fuel is full the flag is ready and
[1:39:33] serviced
[1:39:34] ready
[1:39:36] so you better get on board my brother my
[1:39:38] sister get on board
[1:39:41] it's not time it's time to put on your
[1:39:43] bed it's time to get transformed
[1:39:46] it's normal
[1:39:47] for a christ-like minded believer to
[1:39:50] allow things of the world to be in your
[1:39:52] mind about your brother and your sister
[1:39:55] to attaining an english talk
[1:40:00] i heard the pastor last week saying
[1:40:02] people
[1:40:03] assassinate each other's character
[1:40:07] minded believer
[1:40:08] that's not a mind christ-minded like
[1:40:11] christian
[1:40:13] not in
[1:40:15] the flesh not with another brother
[1:40:17] talking not in my mind alone
[1:40:20] not
[1:40:22] not alone in my mind or my heart not
[1:40:25] with another brother or sister those
[1:40:27] things cannot be heard
[1:40:30] you must
[1:40:31] take that level and take this place why
[1:40:34] would you do that because you are
[1:40:36] transformed
[1:40:37] you are transformed you you run and
[1:40:41] stay away from the evil world even the
[1:40:45] very appearance
[1:40:47] amen i'm almost finished and then
[1:40:51] the bible says
[1:40:52] i mean i'm sorry not the bible this is
[1:40:54] me i'm saying if you see someone who who
[1:40:58] who really fights and rejects this
[1:41:00] weight
[1:41:02] it's possible that that person is not
[1:41:03] deceit
[1:41:04] because every seed show is on bringing
[1:41:07] its own kind
[1:41:08] so everything must bring his kind now
[1:41:11] there's nothing wrong what you think
[1:41:13] about yourself
[1:41:14] what you think about yourself
[1:41:16] who do you think you are that's there's
[1:41:18] a statement in the world you know some
[1:41:20] people ask it but i'm asking in a
[1:41:22] friendly way who do you think you are
[1:41:25] who
[1:41:26] who do you think you are
[1:41:28] because the brother brother ben was
[1:41:30] asking one sunday the lord asked peter
[1:41:32] and them who do the people say i am
[1:41:38] and the disciples answered him and they
[1:41:40] answered him and eventually peter hit
[1:41:43] the court and he said you are christ the
[1:41:45] son of the living god and he said
[1:41:47] blessed are thou peter right we know
[1:41:49] that so now i want to ask you a question
[1:41:52] the lord asked a question well question
[1:41:54] tonight is who do you think you you are
[1:41:58] that's
[1:41:59] yourself who do you think you are
[1:42:02] not the weightless way of saying
[1:42:04] what do you think you can do or who do
[1:42:06] you think that one you know that the
[1:42:08] root one not that one the one i'm asking
[1:42:10] you is
[1:42:11] how do you perceive yourself
[1:42:14] who do you think you are
[1:42:17] who do you think these people around you
[1:42:20] who do you think they are
[1:42:25] who are
[1:42:26] they the answer is in your heart
[1:42:30] and the answer
[1:42:32] must be according to revelation
[1:42:34] it must be revealed answer it must be
[1:42:37] the one that jesus christ will say ah
[1:42:40] edward
[1:42:41] and blood have noticed without my son
[1:42:45] of the lord
[1:42:46] the response to your answer
[1:42:49] you see brother mario it must be the
[1:42:52] lord said oh marion johannes
[1:42:55] bless and blood have not revealed that
[1:42:57] unto you
[1:42:58] amen amen
[1:43:00] so
[1:43:01] you are
[1:43:03] the son
[1:43:05] and a daughter
[1:43:06] of the living god hey
[1:43:08] in the process of being transformed
[1:43:11] therefore
[1:43:12] a sea that is getting transformed
[1:43:16] does not get mixed up in the loose
[1:43:19] things of this world
[1:43:21] is shooting up to the sky it's going
[1:43:23] home time
[1:43:24] it does not time for those things amen
[1:43:27] the way you see yourself is very
[1:43:29] important
[1:43:30] it's very critical it is very important
[1:43:33] because and it depends on how you look
[1:43:36] at yourself
[1:43:39] or you're right
[1:43:41] obviously obviously you're either wrong
[1:43:43] or right
[1:43:44] you know someone one day they ask them
[1:43:46] oh do you know the gender of the baby
[1:43:48] the sisters expecting you know the
[1:43:51] gender and that person said
[1:43:53] oh no no no no
[1:43:55] yes yes yes we know this is either a boy
[1:43:57] or a kid
[1:44:00] now it's obviously is other boy or again
[1:44:03] i'm repeating the same thing i'm saying
[1:44:06] the way you look at yourself
[1:44:09] you're either wrong
[1:44:10] or you're right
[1:44:12] just depends on how you're looking at
[1:44:14] yourself why because the natural eyes
[1:44:18] are going to tell you and the mind
[1:44:20] that you are a sinner you are not the
[1:44:22] son of god that's why you make so many
[1:44:23] mistakes that's why you think like that
[1:44:26] yeah
[1:44:27] you cannot allow that the same gene
[1:44:29] inside you cannot allow that
[1:44:31] cannot answer them somewhere from deep
[1:44:34] within you something is going to say but
[1:44:36] i'm a son of god
[1:44:38] now that is no more the natural art
[1:44:41] you see
[1:44:42] you look to yourself not through your
[1:44:44] own eyes
[1:44:45] this is why you can say i am almond the
[1:44:48] son of the living god you see because
[1:44:50] you are not looking yourself through
[1:44:52] your own eyes through your mind no
[1:44:55] you are looking through the rock
[1:44:58] that
[1:44:59] the lord jesus said unto peter
[1:45:01] flesh and black you see it's not flesh
[1:45:04] and blood that will make you to say i am
[1:45:06] armand or i am paul the son of the
[1:45:08] living god you say no i am matthew
[1:45:12] the son of the living god the devil
[1:45:20] because he will be realizing that it's
[1:45:22] not flesh and blood saying that
[1:45:24] it is coming through the mouth but it's
[1:45:26] not flesh and blood it's through
[1:45:28] revelation from somewhere inside
[1:45:30] the transformation has taken place you
[1:45:32] see
[1:45:33] seeing yourself as the lord see you you
[1:45:36] see that's how we we must see ourselves
[1:45:39] we must see ourselves the way the lord
[1:45:41] saw us when he left heaven to come to us
[1:45:44] he saw
[1:45:45] the end product and he came
[1:45:48] he overlooked these things in between he
[1:45:50] says i will delete that you know a
[1:45:51] delete button on the computer he deleted
[1:45:54] it and he even removed it from the
[1:45:57] recycle bin he removed it
[1:46:02] when you talk about yourself you must
[1:46:05] you must catch the mind of god you must
[1:46:08] be talking about
[1:46:10] what is in the mind of god about you
[1:46:14] cannot say it from your own mind because
[1:46:16] you'll be wrong
[1:46:18] that's the mind of god the mind of god
[1:46:21] the revelation of god and his own faith
[1:46:24] then you know exactly who you are
[1:46:28] i call so much about brothers i didn't
[1:46:30] call the sisters names you see so
[1:46:32] revelation love and faith of god will be
[1:46:36] doing that through you sister and
[1:46:37] christian isn't it
[1:46:39] amen
[1:46:40] now think about moses this is a simple
[1:46:43] example in in in closing think about
[1:46:45] moses and pharaoh they were looking
[1:46:47] through to the same people
[1:46:50] but sing differently right
[1:46:52] then look at you
[1:46:54] you look at yourself jesus christ looks
[1:46:56] at you
[1:46:57] but you see different things they see
[1:47:00] different things pharaoh looked at the
[1:47:02] israelites
[1:47:04] moses looked to them both of them same
[1:47:06] people but they are they are seeing if
[1:47:09] one one sees slaves
[1:47:10] one sees the children the sons and
[1:47:12] daughters of the most high god
[1:47:15] christ looks at us he sees a bride
[1:47:19] of him the devil looks at us he sees
[1:47:21] someone that he must abuse
[1:47:26] that's what the devil does
[1:47:27] you see
[1:47:29] so in closing i won't read this
[1:47:31] scripture here
[1:47:32] but now
[1:47:34] this scripture
[1:47:35] is the one that i wanted to draw your
[1:47:37] attention
[1:47:38] to
[1:47:39] this uh
[1:47:41] i wanted to draw you just to repeat what
[1:47:43] brother ben said there about when the
[1:47:45] lord was asking peter
[1:47:47] who do the people say
[1:47:49] i am
[1:47:50] and we've already spoken about it
[1:47:53] now
[1:47:54] you can't say that through your lips
[1:47:56] revelation of god will speak through you
[1:48:00] that you are the son
[1:48:02] or a daughter
[1:48:03] of the living god
[1:48:05] are we together
[1:48:07] now
[1:48:07] let's just uh read this and then we pray
[1:48:11] then we are finished amen
[1:48:13] now
[1:48:14] it's hard to say this this is the
[1:48:16] prophet now you see because everything
[1:48:19] that is happening through this journey
[1:48:21] of transformation it comes through that
[1:48:23] plan of god
[1:48:25] a book that was stolen that is getting
[1:48:27] to be restored that has been restored in
[1:48:30] the rightful owners this it is along
[1:48:33] those lines that the prophet is saying
[1:48:34] this he says now
[1:48:36] it's hard to say this it is very hard
[1:48:38] because speaking to people who feel the
[1:48:41] same way i do and the way i have been
[1:48:44] for many years but since the old
[1:48:46] painting of those sea seven seals
[1:48:49] of them angels just behind the mountain
[1:48:52] yonder
[1:48:53] this has become a new boob
[1:48:56] if the things that has been hit
[1:48:59] is being revealed
[1:49:01] as god promised revelation in revelation
[1:49:04] 10. you are the seven seals you see you
[1:49:07] are the son because you you you did not
[1:49:09] know who you are before only through the
[1:49:12] preaching of this world you became to
[1:49:14] know that oh i'm part of the seventh
[1:49:17] season christ is the seventh everything
[1:49:19] revolves around that book
[1:49:22] and is now getting restored in the hands
[1:49:25] of the rightful owner
[1:49:27] it sounds like to me that the prophet
[1:49:29] says oh everything i've been preaching
[1:49:31] and everything but from the day the
[1:49:33] seven sales were revealed
[1:49:36] man
[1:49:37] it became a new book the prophet says
[1:49:40] that's what he says
[1:49:42] he will do it and we are the we are the
[1:49:45] privileged people that god has chosen
[1:49:48] and of the earth
[1:49:50] that we might see and understand these
[1:49:53] things
[1:49:54] which is not some mythical fleshly
[1:49:58] mind of a person
[1:50:00] trying to make it up
[1:50:02] is the word of god make manifest
[1:50:05] is the word of god made manifest
[1:50:08] revealing itself who it is manifest
[1:50:11] meaning meaning coming to reality
[1:50:14] showing of the actual theme of what it
[1:50:17] is that's what manifestation means the
[1:50:19] word of god made manifest proven that
[1:50:22] it's right proven not by science
[1:50:26] but by god that's
[1:50:28] that's right god as i have said before
[1:50:31] in the message in a message god doesn't
[1:50:33] need anyone to interpret his way
[1:50:36] he is his own interpreter amen
[1:50:40] you know he no one can interpret the
[1:50:43] word of god
[1:50:44] the word of god interpret itself when it
[1:50:46] happens that is the interpretation amen
[1:50:49] of god happens that is his own word
[1:50:51] being interpreted so everything you come
[1:50:55] into manifestation coming to reality the
[1:50:58] existence of the seed gene that you are
[1:51:00] becoming being transformed you are the
[1:51:02] word of god being manifested
[1:51:05] ah
[1:51:07] you are
[1:51:08] the devil can argue he's got no leg to
[1:51:10] stand on so on that note brothers and
[1:51:13] sisters it is a bit awkward to preach on
[1:51:15] zoom because i'm not used to it but on
[1:51:17] that note i pray that the lord will take
[1:51:21] this word that has been everywhere and
[1:51:23] just build something in your hearts and
[1:51:25] bless you and show you
[1:51:26] through the rock of revelation that you
[1:51:29] are the true seed gene of god
[1:51:32] and the transformation
[1:51:34] and one of these days
[1:51:36] it will take a flight
[1:51:38] history
[1:51:40] will be history
[1:51:43] amen may the lord bless you may you have
[1:51:45] a wonderful night
[1:51:47] and thank you very much for being an
[1:51:49] attentive audience i would have loved to
[1:51:51] hear you
[1:51:52] but the lord bless you
[1:51:54] i would like us to pray and then we can
[1:51:56] hand over to brother edward
[1:52:00] maybe
[1:52:00] you have a need in your heart
[1:52:02] somewhere if you search deep in your
[1:52:04] heart the holy spirit tells you that
[1:52:06] there is a desire for something
[1:52:08] and the lord wants to give it to you
[1:52:11] and now
[1:52:13] uh it is an opportunity for you to lift
[1:52:16] up your hand inside your heart
[1:52:19] don't just lift it physically only
[1:52:21] lift up your genuine hand in your heart
[1:52:24] because you are a true seed gene of god
[1:52:27] you are a true seed of god being
[1:52:31] transformed today
[1:52:33] and what you are asking for you must get
[1:52:36] especially the word of god as prophesied
[1:52:38] lift up your hand by faith
[1:52:40] defy the force of gravity let's be
[1:52:43] reverend
