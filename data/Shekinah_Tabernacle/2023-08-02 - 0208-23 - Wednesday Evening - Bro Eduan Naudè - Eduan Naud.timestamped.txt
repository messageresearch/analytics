[24:53] musicians thank you your
[24:55] have your seats
[24:57] um
[24:58] sorry yes I actually wanted to
[25:04] um
[25:04] just have Grace
[25:07] I just want to jump here to a
[25:11] I think it is one Peter one
[25:14] first 20
[25:16] um sorry it's one of the ironically one
[25:18] of the verses I I didn't write down
[25:21] um
[25:24] I'll just jump here to my trusty old
[25:27] device
[25:33] yes
[25:34] praise the Lord
[25:36] so we'll start there from verse 19
[25:39] um Tyler you can put that
[25:41] um
[25:42] scripture up I didn't put it in there
[25:45] um
[25:47] one Peter one verse 19
[25:51] and 20.
[25:54] actually let's start at verse 18 is so
[25:57] powerful for as much as we you know that
[25:59] you were not redeemed with corruptable
[26:02] things as Sovereign goes from your vain
[26:04] conversation received by tradition from
[26:07] your fathers but with the precious blood
[26:10] of Christ
[26:11] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[26:14] spot who really was foreordained before
[26:17] the foundation of the world but was
[26:19] manifest in these last times for you
[26:23] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[26:26] word and you may have your seats
[26:28] says before we go on I know we've got a
[26:31] couple of birthdays so I really want to
[26:33] start off with I don't know if he's
[26:35] watching I don't know if there's um
[26:37] what do they call that thing in South
[26:40] Africa where the all the power goes off
[26:42] load shedding
[26:44] happy birthday Reuben Hannah who am I
[26:49] missing who am I missing
[26:50] the sister Vanessa happy birthday God
[26:53] bless you what a day what a day
[26:56] what a day
[26:59] let me tell you what a day to be alive
[27:01] as well
[27:03] right so we'll get to the prophet Sid
[27:08] you can you can eat too much you can
[27:10] sleep too much but you can never
[27:13] tonight we have a bunch of prayer
[27:16] requests I really want to get through
[27:17] them
[27:19] why why is the prerequis getting along
[27:22] and long and longer is it because
[27:24] there's a bigger need maybe but because
[27:27] Lord the god answers prayer we come here
[27:31] and we testify and we give witness so
[27:34] tonight I've got a little little thought
[27:35] and I'll maybe try and explain quickly
[27:38] the background that we have my thought I
[27:43] maybe you won't believe this but I was
[27:45] washing dishes I was doing something at
[27:47] the at the Basin and and I think the
[27:49] kids were watching some sort of Bible
[27:51] story and but and and I still told today
[27:55] don't know something triggered something
[27:57] was said and it triggered and I said
[28:01] Disobedience Disobedience and I think I
[28:03] I said that to um brother being
[28:06] Disobedience as a as a learned behavior
[28:08] so and that's what I wanted to make my
[28:10] title but then I thought it's a bit
[28:12] strong is a bit hard to you know let's
[28:15] let's liven it up a bit or make it a bit
[28:17] positive what's the opposite of that
[28:19] and the Lord's my witness I was sitting
[28:22] today and I Was preparing through
[28:24] oh all my meetings and and I thought uh
[28:28] not me the Lord showed me it's inherited
[28:33] behavior so the opposite of this of this
[28:37] um learned behavior is inherited
[28:40] behavior so I'll I'll stay in that title
[28:43] and how that thought became I was like
[28:45] we've heard it so many times we're born
[28:47] and shaped in iniquity coming to the
[28:50] world speaking lies that's right but is
[28:53] that where we start to exist is that
[28:56] where we as beings not the flesh but our
[29:00] vessels internally and our souls fine
[29:03] God bless you hey good to see you
[29:05] um
[29:07] um
[29:08] is that is that where our journey start
[29:11] okay and that's this is where and and
[29:14] this this thing took a took a big uh a
[29:18] big Journey so
[29:20] um I hope you are who who here likes
[29:23] visual who who works with oh okay
[29:27] the majority voice what is minority and
[29:30] what's majority I I taught you hey yeah
[29:33] yeah so the majority likes visual so I I
[29:37] love visual I just it a big ship paints
[29:40] a thousand words it paints a picture
[29:42] paints a thousand words that one so it
[29:45] explains more than I can do with this
[29:48] with his uh crooked mouth of mine so
[29:51] please bear with me and I've got a lot
[29:53] of thoughts and I'll probably hammer on
[29:55] this one thing
[29:57] um
[29:59] inherited versus learned behavior okay
[30:03] so let's kick off let's kick off
[30:07] so my thought was
[30:10] um
[30:11] Lucifer
[30:12] so where where was Luther
[30:16] I'll get to him I'll get to Martin
[30:18] Luther Lucifer
[30:20] uh Sun of the morning
[30:22] right he was God's right-hand man as has
[30:26] been described he had Authority right he
[30:29] had a lot of power right and I thought
[30:32] well
[30:34] what went wrong so there he started off
[30:37] God's God's right hand man
[30:40] and where did the end we all know where
[30:43] is he going to end where it is where did
[30:45] he end he's quite low so he started off
[30:47] quite high he but he ended quite low
[30:50] and now from there I jumped to this
[30:53] third line so coming to the world
[30:56] speaking lies
[30:59] hanon where's the Bible hand on the
[31:01] Bible I I've I've not taught my kids to
[31:05] lie
[31:07] right right
[31:09] so who taught them where did this come
[31:12] from right so now I'm jumping back to
[31:15] Lucifer Sun of the morning and it was
[31:17] there and he had everything he had every
[31:19] he had everything and he's there
[31:23] oh but I want a bit more
[31:26] oh I've got this inheritance here I have
[31:29] I have it in my hands
[31:31] and I'm thinking but
[31:33] if only I do this so if only I go set to
[31:36] the north and I can build a kingdom
[31:38] there only if I can rise above these
[31:40] clouds of God this the stars of God just
[31:43] he wanted that and
[31:46] you know it was just incredible to to
[31:49] think he was that high
[31:52] and he fell that low
[31:54] of that thought that thought and that
[31:57] for me that's a learned thought this is
[31:59] something now with reason this is
[32:01] something that he hasn't inherited but
[32:04] now he's putting in a in in flesh a
[32:07] fleshly thought these two top two inches
[32:12] so foreign
[32:15] for thou has said in thine heart and
[32:18] this is now Lucifer
[32:19] Prophet saying I will Ascend into heaven
[32:22] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[32:25] of God I will sit also amount upon the
[32:29] Mount of the congregation in the size of
[32:31] the north I will Ascend above the
[32:33] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[32:36] most high
[32:37] God have mercy
[32:40] right so let's get into then what what
[32:42] to describe this learned behavior right
[32:46] and this is from Britannica we'll read
[32:49] there awesome in the early 1930s the
[32:52] distinction between learned and
[32:54] inherited behavior seemed very or
[32:56] clearer than it is today with all these
[32:59] um let's say gray areas that's now in
[33:02] population The View that any bit of
[33:04] behavior either was learned or simply
[33:06] developed without learning seemed
[33:08] straightforward
[33:09] studies based on these expectations LED
[33:12] investigators to conclude that in this
[33:15] case rat killing Behavior among cats is
[33:18] learned rather than instinctive so keep
[33:20] that in the back of your head in your
[33:22] mind that human fears are all acquired
[33:26] or that intelligence is completely the
[33:29] result of experience learning theorists
[33:32] were saying then then that most behavior
[33:36] is learned and that by biological
[33:38] factors are of little or no importance
[33:44] um that human fears are all acquired
[33:46] right
[33:49] and and cats learned rather than
[33:51] instinctively to kill right
[33:55] um very interesting
[33:58] jumping to theology now
[34:01] philosophically and and I had to
[34:04] keep my mouth keep my tongue because
[34:06] because when I started reading this I go
[34:08] I so want to do it in a proper English
[34:11] accent you know to sort of I was I was
[34:14] almost falling asleep halfway through
[34:16] reading that and I go what is that what
[34:18] are they on about you know theology now
[34:21] thinking about now spiritual jackets
[34:23] thinking about
[34:26] um
[34:26] learned behavior theology
[34:28] philosophically orientated discipline of
[34:31] religious speculation and apologetics
[34:34] that is traditionally restricted because
[34:36] of its Origins and format to
[34:38] Christianity but now gray matter here it
[34:41] comes again gray area but that might
[34:43] also Encompass because of its theme are
[34:46] the religions including especially Islam
[34:49] and Judaism the themes of theology
[34:51] include as of you know it's just one of
[34:54] those things maybe include God you know
[34:56] you know include God Humanity the world
[34:59] salvation and eschatology the study of
[35:02] last times
[35:04] um
[35:05] the book of symbols Revelations right
[35:09] so jumping back now to
[35:12] learn Behavior versus inherited behavior
[35:16] job 38.
[35:17] where was thou when I lay the foundation
[35:20] of the earth declare
[35:22] if there has understanding
[35:25] where were you job
[35:29] that's awesome eh
[35:31] so did he had learned behavior
[35:34] when when God came down and job that's a
[35:37] hard that's a few hard chapters if you
[35:39] go reads 36 37 38 God doesn't stop 39 40
[35:44] 41 go count how many question marks the
[35:47] Lord gives gives over here and he goes
[35:50] here and he says okay so where were you
[35:52] you know it struck me you know and and
[35:56] to be to be job and when job's shoes
[35:59] right there that would have been um
[36:02] he he tried to explain himself here in
[36:05] about Job 40 saying I will keep my mouth
[36:08] his God said I'm not done I'm I'm going
[36:11] to continue I'm going to tell you now
[36:12] and I'm gonna ask you this and you
[36:14] please
[36:15] um if if you jump to I think verse 3 and
[36:18] 2 gird up your loins stand up like a man
[36:22] you know now God's speaking like you
[36:24] know
[36:25] it was it's incredible
[36:27] so
[36:30] this is what I want to hint at here it's
[36:33] not learned behavior
[36:35] okay so I want to tell you and I want to
[36:37] give now a few crude examples okay well
[36:40] some of them include some of them are
[36:41] really relative uh relevant and I'll
[36:44] start off you know I'm a visual person
[36:46] so girls this time I didn't forget you
[36:49] I've got a picture for you okay
[36:52] oh my so here we go we go back to
[36:56] there's about 2003 my own experience
[36:58] right and I'm I'm engaged to Sister
[37:01] Lundy where's you
[37:04] okay
[37:06] she knew this was coming maybe I read my
[37:09] notes
[37:10] um so yeah there there I was and um
[37:13] it's now time to get married it's now
[37:15] time to you know get the ring you know
[37:17] and people that know me I like one of a
[37:20] kind I like custom I like you know
[37:23] uniqueness I thought I can't buy just
[37:25] any other ring no no no this is not
[37:27] going to work I'm gonna design her ring
[37:30] I thought okay you know months go by
[37:33] months go by and it sketches and it's
[37:36] and I got this this contact this friend
[37:38] of a a friend of a friend Joan I think
[37:41] his name is from nelspruit now nelspruit
[37:44] in Pretoria is probably about three four
[37:45] hours drive so some weekends we'll get
[37:48] together he'll bring me the precious
[37:50] stones you know the diamonds and
[37:52] sapphires and everything and a big
[37:54] little black bag and we meet up at a at
[37:58] a coffee shop and he put it on the table
[37:59] and say okay this one is that Clarity a
[38:02] v or something this one you know
[38:03] beautiful and take the shape and
[38:05] everything and we are and we look like
[38:07] diamond Smugglers you know it's a you
[38:09] know just looking around left and right
[38:11] but you know
[38:13] um
[38:13] didn't want to you know want to keep it
[38:15] a secret
[38:17] and one day one day so now
[38:20] we settled on the design we settled what
[38:23] we want to do on the stones everything
[38:25] the white gold the yellow gold what
[38:27] carrot what you know the list goes on
[38:29] and it's now being made right it's in
[38:32] the process and I'm in anticipation and
[38:34] one day we're walking through I think it
[38:36] was menlyn mall and as you do the boys
[38:38] walk at the back and the girls are
[38:40] chatty chatty there at the front and one
[38:42] bad habit of mine I my ears go
[38:44] everywhere so I listen to our
[38:46] conversation their conversation everyone
[38:48] walks past and she says I do not like
[38:52] sapphires
[38:55] and I'm like Lord
[38:58] and I thought I thought you know I've
[39:01] got this and I have
[39:02] you want to guess what ring I Made Girls
[39:06] there were sapphires in it
[39:10] because I couldn't ask her and I
[39:12] couldn't you know what do you like what
[39:14] don't you like this is actually a ring
[39:15] right so I took the picture today and I
[39:17] Photoshopped it a little bit and um
[39:21] so then
[39:22] I mean have you ever seen a six foot one
[39:25] 105 kilogram man not be able to breathe
[39:28] you know feeling like
[39:29] this came over me now all the
[39:33] what am I going to do you know what so
[39:36] this is now me and just crudely showing
[39:39] learned I haven't learned yet so I I
[39:42] thought I assumed I said this is this is
[39:45] that you know she would like this she
[39:46] would like this ring she would that blue
[39:49] is so deep and dark you know she would
[39:51] appreciate it brings out the diamond you
[39:53] know all this and I hear that
[39:56] and I go oh my what am I going to do is
[39:59] busy being made
[40:01] sorry I think a week goes by and I'm
[40:04] stressing and I thought okay I have to
[40:05] sit down I have to tell her or ask her
[40:08] and I said um
[40:11] you don't like sapphires
[40:14] as you see no no no no I said okay
[40:18] and I had to come clean I said Well the
[40:20] ring is being made and surprise the
[40:24] Sapphire's in there you know
[40:27] she said no no okay so let me give you
[40:29] context I do not like that as the as the
[40:32] main centerpiece I don't like so if
[40:35] there's a I said there's definitely a
[40:37] diamond okay okay a wasted and I said
[40:39] and I showed her you still got the
[40:41] pencil drawing from the first year so I
[40:44] said this is what as she said perfect
[40:46] and I go sure okay so as long it was not
[40:49] the centerpiece you know she so I
[40:52] thought okay praise the Lord I'm safe
[40:53] I'm safe right
[40:56] so crude little example other example
[40:59] that is not learned behavior in which
[41:01] which is very surprising you know we've
[41:04] got this little thing in the rugby
[41:06] between the All Blacks and the
[41:07] springboks and you know I grew up as a
[41:09] spring book you know and not never
[41:11] really got hold of this black Jersey and
[41:15] um
[41:16] we're sitting in watching some of the
[41:18] game and and I asked the boys to you
[41:20] know who are you rooting for and they
[41:21] all go to South Africa they all go
[41:23] springboks
[41:24] I said my but you you were born here you
[41:28] were raised here you know the guys on
[41:30] first name basis and and and and but you
[41:33] don't know one Springbok what's
[41:34] happening here you know I didn't teach
[41:36] them that I didn't you know where did
[41:38] that come from you know I thought well
[41:40] that must be you know born in you
[41:43] okay let's make it a bit more relevant
[41:47] one Samuel 16. then answered one of the
[41:49] servants and said behold I have seen a
[41:52] son of Jesse the bethlehemite that is
[41:54] cunning and playing and mighty Valiant
[41:56] man and man of war and prudent in
[41:59] matters and comely person and by the way
[42:02] the Lord is with him okay
[42:05] so
[42:07] I think you know where I'm going with
[42:08] this
[42:12] David a young man now I just want to
[42:14] point out that I only saw
[42:16] it I only clicked today or the penny
[42:19] dropped a mighty Valiant man a man of
[42:22] war zone talking about a man here a lot
[42:24] of people think okay was he 8 19 years
[42:26] old I'm thinking now more like he's 13.
[42:29] what I want to tell the boys here
[42:31] 13 years old you're a man
[42:34] okay Jews traditions and whatever we
[42:36] skip or they skip teenager teenager is
[42:40] not a it's not in the equation okay and
[42:43] I'm trying to teach that to the boys as
[42:45] well it's not an excuse to you know have
[42:47] a way out all right so you were a boy
[42:49] and you became a man there was a there
[42:51] was this distinct end so they're talking
[42:54] here about a man and it was definitely a
[42:56] very young man so I will give him the
[42:58] benefit of the doubt and I think he was
[43:00] about 13 years old right
[43:03] so here they're talking about
[43:06] uh
[43:07] uh to come play for soul you know it's
[43:10] all on the on the on the Hub right but
[43:12] then in in chapter 17 it goes into
[43:15] Goliath right
[43:18] now when he was there on the on the on
[43:20] the on the
[43:22] field on the with his brothers at the
[43:24] war
[43:25] he had to justify and say
[43:28] um if I'm the right man to take on
[43:29] Goliath and one of the things he did
[43:31] they said well I've killed the bear and
[43:33] I've killed the lion right
[43:35] and
[43:36] he
[43:38] he he didn't lie okay now one of the
[43:43] things if you who's not from South
[43:45] Africa
[43:46] okay on or any country that's got a lion
[43:50] in it okay or hasn't been
[43:53] close to a line in the wild
[43:55] a male line is about 250 kilograms okay
[43:59] slightly bigger than me okay with claws
[44:02] that long with teeth that long okay you
[44:06] do not pit it okay there's a few
[44:09] tourists that go there in the Kruger
[44:11] National Park and hang out the window
[44:12] you do not pit it you do not come close
[44:16] to it okay
[44:18] boy have you had a experience firsthand
[44:21] with a lion or a leopard or something
[44:24] you run the opposite way it is as simple
[44:27] as that okay
[44:28] now I want to show you
[44:31] here here's how the the white South
[44:33] African hunts a lion okay I'm totally
[44:36] against hunting lions
[44:38] so a grainy picture probably for a
[44:41] reason these two guns there so two
[44:43] people one closest to the camera is a
[44:46] professional Hunter okay and one of The
[44:49] Trackers so you need to be an
[44:51] exceptional Hunter an exceptional
[44:53] tracker for Lions this particular
[44:57] this particular scenario they were
[44:59] hunting a line and was probably a
[45:01] tourist and
[45:05] am I still on yep
[45:07] um when when they got to basically this
[45:10] point so they they checked this lion
[45:12] track this line then they started
[45:14] crossing the tracks again and they
[45:16] thought okay I started wandering and so
[45:18] the long and shoulders now they being
[45:21] hunted
[45:22] so the the line is not a dumb animal as
[45:24] well so 250 kg is that long this long
[45:27] that Annie's not dumb so now the hunter
[45:29] has become the hunted okay two
[45:32] individuals with guns here's little
[45:34] Lefty he's got a gun as well
[45:38] and here is two individuals with guns as
[45:41] well the one here on the left is uh is
[45:44] another professional answer so two
[45:45] professional answers I'll point to
[45:47] something here right here
[45:50] so have a look there
[45:53] that that is that individual's gun the
[45:56] rifle okay
[45:58] I don't know health and safety Armand
[46:01] does that work for you yeah people in
[46:04] front of a gun
[46:05] okay so this is now on fear and
[46:07] Desperation because this line has
[46:09] destroyed is coming through the bush
[46:10] they cannot see it in that shrub it's
[46:13] it's brown it's winter and and the
[46:15] Lion's Brown so I don't know why you
[46:17] wouldn't do that but anyway so they do
[46:19] not know where it's coming from
[46:21] um if ever have you heard a lion roar it
[46:25] is in 3D absolutely Amplified right so
[46:29] here you've got boys and girls did you
[46:31] count how many rifles
[46:33] uh
[46:35] oh wait
[46:36] okay five
[46:38] so these two there's one
[46:41] and here's the other two okay
[46:44] that's how they hunt a lion okay
[46:48] here's David just a representation
[46:51] here's David
[46:53] now maybe he had a sling maybe at a club
[46:55] maybe had a stick I don't know okay
[46:59] would you still would you go after a
[47:01] lion
[47:02] because one lost sheep I can tell you in
[47:04] the flesh what I would have done in
[47:06] their cheap cult if one of got lost said
[47:08] sorry Dad you know it's a lion he would
[47:11] have understood right
[47:13] he killed this line and he killed the
[47:15] bear
[47:17] now according to what I've done my
[47:20] research is before he even knew he's
[47:22] going to be anointed king
[47:24] before Samuel came to him
[47:26] so he had already something in him what
[47:30] taught him about this lion what taught
[47:32] him how to hunt and kill a lion in that
[47:36] age
[47:38] where does that come from that is for me
[47:40] that's inherited behavior it's not
[47:42] learned behavior right
[47:45] so let me just see if I'm following my
[47:47] notes correctly yes awesome
[47:49] thank you Lord
[47:50] the next one
[47:53] Eagle in the chicken coop
[47:55] okay Eagle in the chicken coop now what
[47:58] is interesting here is and maybe I'll
[48:01] use brother brother again as an example
[48:04] he's had chickens before so if you have
[48:06] chickens in the chicken coop what is one
[48:08] of the dangers you have in Africa with a
[48:12] chicken coop
[48:13] yep and what comes on the ground
[48:17] snakes right and and one of the snakes
[48:21] we used to call escarp sticker right I
[48:23] don't know what's that in English but
[48:25] it's scorp is is a is a sheep and a
[48:28] Scorpio is as it stings as it bites you
[48:32] know
[48:33] so
[48:37] this this Eagle is in the chicken coop
[48:39] he doesn't belong there okay
[48:41] and it it's not it's appetite it's not
[48:45] getting
[48:46] you know
[48:47] so now he's sitting there and he's just
[48:50] checking he's he's not the same they've
[48:53] done research and this one farmer took a
[48:55] eagle egg took a chicken egg swapped or
[48:58] two right it hatched
[49:00] chicken went on there was the the the
[49:03] eagle hatched eaglet it hatched she said
[49:07] oh it's okay you know you look a bit
[49:08] different but you carried on this this
[49:10] is true it's even YouTube you can go and
[49:13] Google that
[49:14] the eagle as soon as that thing hatched
[49:16] it kept it away from itself from its
[49:18] other Bibles and from itself didn't feed
[49:21] it fit its own
[49:22] there was immediately a distinction a a
[49:25] I am identifying you are not one of mine
[49:28] okay
[49:30] it's powerful because this is this is
[49:33] inherent this is not a learned behavior
[49:36] but now this this Eagle in the chicken
[49:38] coop now brother Paul if you had one of
[49:40] these Eagle in your chicken coop and
[49:42] there's a snake coming in would you be
[49:44] worried
[49:45] with one of those Eagles in there I'm
[49:48] telling you now the snake is six love
[49:51] he's lost he's lost that battle so just
[49:54] imagine Here Comes This sneaky little
[49:56] serpent into this chicken coop and he
[49:58] finds this oddly looking chicken
[50:02] and he goes
[50:04] the the ego goes and he asks him what
[50:06] are you doing here
[50:08] if immediately with his inherited
[50:10] behavior he said
[50:12] you die and I Stay Alive you come and
[50:16] threaten me you die you know it is not
[50:19] taught to him it is inside of him
[50:24] now
[50:28] three three men three men in the fire
[50:32] so three men in the fire
[50:35] and there's a fourth man I just want to
[50:37] say here a little Segway well the bean
[50:39] sister Margie we're thinking of you guys
[50:42] Three Men and there's a fourth man in
[50:44] the fire with you guys
[50:46] please believe that please believe that
[50:48] but I what I do love about the scripture
[50:52] and I'll put it up now sir Jack Meshach
[50:54] and Abednego answered and said to the
[50:56] king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not
[50:59] careful to answer thee in this matter if
[51:03] it be so our God whom we serve is able
[51:06] to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery
[51:07] furnace and he will Deliver Us from
[51:09] thine hand O King but if not be it known
[51:13] unto thee O King that we will not serve
[51:16] thy God nor worship any golden image as
[51:19] thou set up
[51:21] they were not careful with the answer
[51:23] brothers and sisters we cannot be
[51:25] careful with our answer we have to stand
[51:28] for something otherwise we'll fall for
[51:30] anything right and in this what we've
[51:33] received through Grace
[51:35] we're saying we've got an inheritance
[51:38] I've learned a lot of things I've
[51:40] learned a lot of theologies I've learned
[51:41] I've Church hopped so many times right
[51:44] and here I come and I've testified last
[51:47] last week again I walked into this into
[51:50] this place not this particular premises
[51:53] but I walked in and the Deacon was song
[51:56] leading and Sister Christine was on the
[51:58] piano and brother Ben was absolutely
[52:00] seeking crooked and could only walk on
[52:02] one leg
[52:03] the Lord told me they this is where you
[52:05] will worship
[52:07] so he took away everything that I
[52:09] thought okay this will get me closer to
[52:10] God the music the shows the the building
[52:14] you know everything he stripped it away
[52:16] and he said here's where you will
[52:18] worship me okay that's inheritance that
[52:21] is that is not a learned behavior he had
[52:23] to strip away my learned behavior
[52:26] to get to that place
[52:31] to to
[52:34] tie to that to add to that notice each
[52:36] time she indicated we're talking now
[52:38] about an eve about a church about an
[52:40] organized religion what she do what does
[52:44] she do each time this church like Eve
[52:47] did she forced her not this church not
[52:50] this church she forced her Adams to
[52:53] believe a new light her scheme and there
[52:56] died with it well we'll all our group
[53:00] will get together oh and we'll we'll
[53:02] have new blessings what we found and so
[53:04] forth right
[53:07] coming back to
[53:09] just a simple question and maybe I'll
[53:11] rephrase that I won't put it in a
[53:12] question I would have put a statement
[53:15] it is learned behavior if if someone
[53:18] comes to you and asks you why are you
[53:20] Christian and you answer I don't want to
[53:22] go to hell
[53:24] that's learned behavior for me okay why
[53:27] are you a Christian why are you redeemed
[53:29] Son of God why did you drive all this
[53:31] way through this cold on the other side
[53:34] of town I stopped here perfect timing
[53:36] and as Lundy went in with the boys I was
[53:39] sitting in the car and immediately
[53:40] started hailing you know it just came
[53:42] down
[53:43] I had every reason to stay at home you
[53:45] know if you look from a human
[53:47] perspective a human lens but because I'm
[53:51] saved by grace I have to stand in this
[53:54] day
[53:55] I I'm a Christian because I love him I'm
[53:58] a Christian because he's done so much to
[54:00] me still doing he hasn't left me I can
[54:03] see like Eagle Vision that eagle and
[54:05] chicken coop is no longer in the chicken
[54:07] coop praise the Lord for that I'm
[54:09] soaring now now the storms come and I as
[54:12] the eagle see the storm put up my wings
[54:14] and I could go just above the clouds
[54:16] above that storm it is as simple as that
[54:20] and that's why again coming back to our
[54:22] prayer request that's why that list is
[54:24] becoming big because there's a realness
[54:26] we're getting into each other's burdens
[54:28] and we see praise get answered
[54:30] praise the Lord for that
[54:34] you see the devil wants you to unknow
[54:37] God he wants you learning away from God
[54:40] God wants you to know his heart so that
[54:43] means you need to get closer to him to
[54:45] his heartbeat right
[54:48] I just want to
[54:50] throw this in here
[54:54] Jesus comes and tests our inheritance
[54:56] when and and and in how we answer okay
[54:59] John 21 so when uh when they had died
[55:02] Jesus asked Simon Peter Simon son of
[55:05] Jonas love us though me more than these
[55:09] he said unto them now imagine they're
[55:12] dining they're eating they're sitting
[55:13] he's fellowshipping and he's busy with a
[55:15] piece of chicken and he said yeah Lord
[55:17] thou knowest I love thee you know just
[55:20] he says she feed my sheep feed my Lambs
[55:24] I say up to him a second time son Simon
[55:26] now what I want to point out here is
[55:30] the answer hasn't changed he's giving
[55:33] the same answer
[55:35] but is that a Sunday school answer
[55:37] and and I'm saying this reverently is it
[55:40] is it something that you mean is it
[55:42] something coming from your inheritance
[55:44] right
[55:46] love us thou me answers yea Lord thou
[55:48] knowest I love thee feed my sheep he
[55:51] said okay he asked him a third time son
[55:54] now Peter was grieved because he asked
[55:57] him the third time lovers tell me and
[56:00] now he says and I can see the attitude
[56:03] changed and I can see the sincerity and
[56:05] reverence change he says Lord thou
[56:08] knowest all things
[56:10] so that's like search me Lord see my
[56:13] heart Creator me a clean heart see me
[56:16] thou knowest that I love thee Jesus said
[56:18] feed my sheep and that's not just for
[56:21] the ministers by the way
[56:25] okay
[56:26] yes
[56:30] before we read that I'll just say
[56:32] there was a nice little Point here uh
[56:35] brother Branham sees as Noah Moses David
[56:38] reflected the coming of the perfect
[56:40] bride groom
[56:42] so as Luther Wesley Pentecost reflected
[56:45] the coming of a Perfect Bride
[56:47] why am I saying that because each of
[56:51] those Messengers had to have
[56:54] inheritance in them
[56:56] one of those messages for example Martin
[56:59] Luther why what inside of him cried out
[57:03] and said this is not right what cried
[57:06] that that he had to do that 95 thesis
[57:10] it was not learned behavior at that
[57:12] point that made him pick up his pen even
[57:15] though he was a scholar in arts and
[57:17] theology but something in there said
[57:20] there's love in this truth and that
[57:22] needs to get to the people right
[57:25] so that's inheritance for me that's a
[57:28] messenger that inside something keeps
[57:31] holding me there's something pressing
[57:33] something you know just so
[57:37] after the truth you know and divine love
[57:42] okay
[57:46] yeah
[57:49] now I just want to make this
[57:52] quite personal with um
[57:54] with us in our church with our message
[57:57] that we believe this is Brother Brennan
[57:59] speaking now someone has been saying to
[58:03] me and theologians theologians
[58:06] brother brother if the Lord God said it
[58:10] with your experience that the Lord has
[58:12] given you for his people humbling saying
[58:14] this said you would be eligible to write
[58:17] write a Bible yourself your word if God
[58:21] has manifested I said it might be true
[58:24] so he's saying
[58:26] but look now what's happening he was
[58:28] trying to catch me see I see but you see
[58:30] I couldn't do that he said why couldn't
[58:32] you you have all the qualifications
[58:34] don't know what he's talking about in
[58:36] terms of qualifications I said what do
[58:38] you what you look but but look
[58:41] one word cannot be added or taken away
[58:44] see and he said well then them seven
[58:47] Thunders UC said even them seven
[58:51] Thunders blasting out won't that be a
[58:53] revelation be given to some man
[58:56] I said no sir it would be adding
[58:59] something to it or taking something from
[59:01] it
[59:02] it's all revealed in there in there in
[59:05] the Bible in the word it's there you see
[59:09] you can't get out of that word it won't
[59:12] leave the word and God's spirit will
[59:15] never leave that word it'll stay right
[59:17] with the word binding some or blinding
[59:20] some and opening the eyes of others
[59:22] that'll always do that
[59:24] that's at attitude that's that
[59:26] inheritance that's talking about here
[59:28] but thinking about brother Branham when
[59:31] he opened all those seven vials Seven
[59:33] Seals seven Thunders
[59:36] he could easily have gone
[59:38] from this what I've learned
[59:40] yes I can be a little bit higher I can
[59:43] be a bit better
[59:44] the laws revealed all this to me well
[59:47] what does he do he goes back to the word
[59:49] he said this has been revealed to me but
[59:51] it's all in here I will not add and I
[59:54] will not take away blessed be the name
[59:57] of the Lord
[59:59] and um
[1:00:02] let's finish on this thing eh
[1:00:07] where was thou
[1:00:09] when I lay the foundations of the earth
[1:00:11] declare if thou understanding Ephesians
[1:00:14] 1 sees according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:00:18] him before the foundation of the world
[1:00:20] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:00:24] before him in love
[1:00:26] we've been chosen before the foundation
[1:00:28] of the world we've come to this earth to
[1:00:31] yes to learn we've come to this earth to
[1:00:34] do a lot of things
[1:00:36] but your inherited behavior your
[1:00:39] attitude and what I loved about brother
[1:00:42] Ben uh Ben Bailey today was the praise
[1:00:46] God let's let's give God thanks because
[1:00:50] of the trials
[1:00:52] right so they're going through a big
[1:00:54] trial and we all are
[1:00:57] um
[1:00:58] but that's attitude of inheritance
[1:01:00] that's saying the Lord can change this
[1:01:02] the Lord has given this trial the lord
[1:01:04] giveth and taketh away blessed be the
[1:01:07] Holy Name
[1:01:08] so let us let us go sort of into
[1:01:11] um I think into maybe worship if we
[1:01:13] could sing a few songs um
[1:01:15] musicians if you want to come
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:20] you are
[1:01:22] you are his bride you are his
[1:01:24] inheritance

[1:01:28] and inside of you is is is stocked up
[1:01:31] everything that you need
