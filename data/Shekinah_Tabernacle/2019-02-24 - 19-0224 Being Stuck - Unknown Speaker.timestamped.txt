[8:59] Chantal I mean it's a big job it's a
[9:02] very important job let's go to second
[9:06] Samuel 16 and then we're going to go to
[9:07] proverbs 18 and second Samuel 16 first I
[9:14] mean so god bless you brother Andy we
[9:17] city behind you I mean you know Jesus
[9:21] said that this gospel must be preached
[9:22] into all nations in the in shall come
[9:24] we want the in to come we want to go
[9:25] home amen so so let's find that last one
[9:29] it could be in Vietnam somewhere Amen so
[9:33] second Samuel 16 verses 5 to 13 so I
[9:36] don't have a slideshow and when King
[9:41] David came to bury him behold thence
[9:45] came out a man of the family of the
[9:47] house of Saul whose name was Jimmy I the
[9:50] son of Gera he came forth and cursed
[9:52] still as he came and he cast stones at
[9:55] David and at all the servants of King
[9:58] David and all the people and all the
[10:01] mighty men were on his right hand and on
[10:03] his left
[10:04] look how bowl dispersed on us and I said
[10:06] show me I win he cursed come out come
[10:09] out their bloody man and thou man of
[10:12] Belial the LORD hath returned upon the
[10:15] all the blood of the house of Saul and
[10:17] who said thou has reigned and the LORD
[10:20] hath delivered the kingdom into the hand
[10:22] of epsilon by süd and behold thou art
[10:25] taken and I mischief because thou art a
[10:27] bloody man then said Ebor shy
[10:30] the son
[10:31] of Zuria unto the king why should this
[10:33] dead dog curse my lord the king let me
[10:36] go over I pray thee in take off his head
[10:38] and the king said what have I to do with
[10:41] thee sons of Zuria so let him curse
[10:44] because the Lord has said unto him curse
[10:47] David who shall then say wherefore hast
[10:51] thou done so now it's not recorded that
[10:54] the Lord actually told him to do it
[10:56] that's how David took it and David said
[10:59] to ever shy and to all the servants
[11:01] behold my son which came forth of my
[11:04] bowels seeketh my life how much more now
[11:08] may this Bend you might do it
[11:10] let him alone and let him curse for the
[11:12] LORD hath burden him and it may be that
[11:15] the Lord will look on my affliction and
[11:17] that the Lord will requite me good for
[11:21] this cursing the state and as David and
[11:24] his men went by the way show me I went
[11:27] along on the hillside over against him
[11:30] and cursed as he went and threw stones
[11:32] at him and cast dust and the pit and the
[11:35] king and all the people that were with
[11:36] him came weary and refreshed themselves
[11:39] there I mean let's go to proverbs 18 and
[11:42] 19 I mean quite a scene there isn't it
[11:46] Allu yeah it's amazing how people act
[11:49] when persecution comes really shows
[11:52] what's in us proverbs 18 and 19 Caesar
[11:57] see just a bit of a context
[12:08] see ya brother a fender that's harder to
[12:12] be won than a strong city and their
[12:15] contentions are like the bars of a
[12:17] castle I mean let's bow our heads in a
[12:20] word of Prayer gracious father we thank
[12:23] you we can gather one more time Lord
[12:26] it's such a privilege to be gathered in
[12:28] your presence Lord we thank you in your
[12:30] presence is the fullness of joy Lord
[12:32] everything we have need of us in you and
[12:34] father just asking as we take a little
[12:36] thought here I pray father you would
[12:38] anoint your word to every heart father
[12:40] may just be you speaking today Lord
[12:42] we're not interested to hear the mind my
[12:44] mind Lord
[12:45] what could a human thoughts Lord it
[12:47] takes your thoughts your word to come
[12:49] father and I pray you an anointing chart
[12:51] Lord anoint speaker and hear or one more
[12:53] time
[12:53] father we truly do pray for Vietnam Lord

[12:58] mighty wind you'd go forth through that
[13:00] place and gather your elected ones out
[13:02] Lord I pray you be preparing hearts even
[13:05] now and father we just ask that you'll
[13:07] receive all honor glory and praise in
[13:09] this service Lord be at those who are
[13:11] away today father as well we ask in
[13:14] Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless
[13:17] you friends you may have your seats this
[13:19] morning so I'd like to approach the
[13:23] subject about the contentions are as
[13:26] bars of a castle I wanna talk about
[13:28] being stuck now it's amazing where
[13:31] you're we see shimmy I you know he comes
[13:34] out and he any any curses David and and
[13:37] you see cuz shimmy I was was of the
[13:39] tribe of Benjamin he was he was part of
[13:41] Saul's tribe you know he you know he was
[13:44] obviously offended that that God
[13:46] actually removed Saul and he put David
[13:49] in his stead as king and he was offended
[13:51] that that had happened and and and so he
[13:53] was holding on to that offense and then
[13:56] when the time was right he released it
[13:58] upon David and his mighty men it's
[14:01] amazing that it wasn't just David
[14:02] walking there being rejected he was with
[14:04] his mighty men all the people and he
[14:06] comes shimmy a hose one hand cursing him
[14:08] and then spitting on him and throwing
[14:10] stones and you know because that's what
[14:13] contentions are like they are like the
[14:15] bars of a castle where it actually holds
[14:17] a people back from moving we're with
[14:19] goddess and you see that God had moved
[14:22] from soul and God was now establishing
[14:24] the kingdom under David and God had
[14:26] already promised David that his son
[14:29] would would reign under stead and and
[14:30] and you know the house of the Lord would
[14:32] be built so God was moving but shimmy I
[14:35] because of his contentions and his old
[14:37] fence he was stuck in the past now we
[14:40] don't want to come into that category of
[14:43] people I mean so now a contention from
[14:48] the Strong's Concordance as a brawling
[14:49] it's a contest or a quarrel it's a
[14:53] discord or a strife and the and the root
[14:56] word of all there's actually to rule by
[14:58] implication to judge so it's those who
[15:01] are so so if someone who's offended they
[15:03] are they are contentious they are
[15:06] actually fighting a battle that's
[15:07] actually in the past they're holding on
[15:09] to the past but they're living through
[15:11] that moment into the present and so we
[15:14] don't want to be that kind of way
[15:16] I'm thankful that we have the blood of
[15:18] Jesus Christ to actually release us of
[15:20] our past and of our contingents I mean
[15:23] so now we do so we're not called to be
[15:25] stuck in one place no brother Bern he
[15:27] says in a few places but I'll just take
[15:29] a couple of quotes he says now and so in
[15:32] this speaking of Israel coming from you
[15:34] know going from Egypt into the Promised
[15:36] Land so when it came time and the
[15:38] showdown and Israel stood there before
[15:40] the sea God's path lead across the sea
[15:42] so god looked down through the pillar of
[15:44] fire the sea got scared and moved back
[15:46] and Israel went across on dry land got
[15:49] God's parsley through it then he went
[15:51] right up to the wilderness into the
[15:53] springs of a spring of Marah bitter
[15:55] water isn't it strange that God would
[15:57] lead his children through bitter waters
[15:58] but them all goes along the road and
[16:01] when he was there the remedy for the
[16:03] bitter waters were standing on the bank
[16:04] Moses cut down a tree throw it in the
[16:06] water it turns sweet again some through
[16:08] the waters some through the floods some
[16:10] through deep trials but all through the
[16:12] blood I'm just continuing on I spoke a
[16:14] couple of Sundays about being detached
[16:16] because of pain I'm just continuing on
[16:18] because I don't I didn't tie it all up
[16:20] so I'm just continuing on you know that
[16:23] vein of thought if you're wondering you
[16:25] know if you think well maybe I'm
[16:26] repeating myself a bit but I'm doing it
[16:28] deliberately because I want to tie this
[16:29] together
[16:30] because you know God's Word is eternal
[16:32] you don't just put a full-stop under a
[16:33] subject and say that's all it just done
[16:35] for
[16:36] I've been so that's the way God leads
[16:38] his children his path God's provided way
[16:40] if the children of Israel would try to
[16:43] bypass go around go down this way they
[16:46] got in trouble they had to follow the
[16:48] cloud of they had to follow the pillar
[16:50] of fire that led them they followed that
[16:53] you know brother Baron he I don't have
[16:55] the quote on me but but he was coming he
[16:57] saw a trial coming up and the Lord
[17:00] actually asked him do you want to bypass
[17:01] this and he said no Lord I'll go through
[17:05] because you'll lead me you know we want
[17:07] to who wants the rugged hard way then I
[17:10] mean I mean I mean in our humanity and
[17:12] our humanity who wants the hungered
[17:14] runway yeah who wants the rugged hard
[17:16] way who wants the stress and the
[17:18] pressure and the you know who wants that
[17:21] no one but we need it I mean we need it
[17:25] hallelujah we need to go through things
[17:27] but we don't want to be eat caught in
[17:30] them in the past right jesus said of
[17:33] John the Baptist when when when he was
[17:35] imprisoned and and and Johnson has
[17:37] disciples to see Jesus and John asked
[17:39] the question are you him or should we
[17:41] look for another and then you know Jesus
[17:44] said to his disciples you know who sit
[17:45] down and see the meeting tell them that
[17:47] the blind see the dead erase the sicker
[17:49] healed the devils cast out he says
[17:52] blessed is he of whosoever is not
[17:55] offended in me so you're blessed if
[17:58] you're not offended by by whatever path
[18:00] you're going down because sometimes we
[18:02] get offended at the situation and we
[18:04] hold on to that we're not called to hold
[18:06] on to it I mean so that's the way so so
[18:11] and if the church and I will only follow
[18:13] the pillar of fire the Holy Spirit
[18:15] you'll make Canaan as sure as anything
[18:16] God has a way a provided way this two
[18:20] ways a man can go that's his way or
[18:22] God's Way and that's the right way or
[18:24] the wrong way your way is always the
[18:26] wrong way oh yeah hey when I read that I
[18:30] was like you say so true and God's Way
[18:33] is the right way God is always right Amy
[18:36] I'm sure we could just establish that
[18:38] God is always right as word as always
[18:40] right it's always correct and every
[18:42] circumstance every generation God's Word
[18:44] is right man
[18:46] way is always wrong that's why this
[18:49] world is heading to a tribulation cuz
[18:51] man's way is wrong because they rejected
[18:53] the Son of Man in this generation Jesus
[18:55] Christ and we're going into a chaos
[18:58] Alleluia but we're not but we're not
[19:00] call to stay here amen
[19:02] so you can't have your own way in God's
[19:04] Way at the same time so you've got to
[19:07] get out of your own way so God can have
[19:09] his way in you that's right
[19:10] God has a provided way a made he said
[19:14] that though there's from God's Way has
[19:16] been made for us in 52 now 1962 from
[19:18] that time but you see when you make an
[19:21] organization 19 percent of us when we
[19:24] make one we put down this is what we
[19:26] believe period if you would say this is
[19:29] what we believe comma plus as much as
[19:31] God will add to us that's all right then
[19:33] that's perfectly fine and that's exactly
[19:34] when the pillar of fire moved Israel
[19:37] moved with it and in the New Testament
[19:39] when it begin to move just exactly like
[19:41] it did in the Old Testament it moved the
[19:43] same way Israel had to follow that
[19:45] pillar of fire and set the tent up under
[19:48] it and when it began to move in this
[19:50] last the Reformation Martin Luther saw
[19:52] it and then as soon as Luther was over
[19:55] they built an organization around
[19:56] Luther's work God moves right out from
[19:59] under it
[19:59] Wesley saw it in a way he went after
[20:01] Wesley and Asbury many of the others and
[20:04] after that time then what happened they
[20:06] built an organization under it God moves
[20:08] right out from under us he went right on
[20:10] C and now we Pentecostals are doing the
[20:12] same thing
[20:13] you can't organize the holy spirit you
[20:16] can't do it we believe in organizations
[20:19] to keep Brotherhood and so forth it
[20:20] serves a good purpose but it always
[20:23] stretched the blanket out to to get the
[20:25] other brother see and hold your heart
[20:27] open to get what God is ready to send
[20:29] down upon us that's the way to do it
[20:32] that's the real Brotherhood and so I
[20:34] like that
[20:35] amen then he says and then he says and
[20:38] as your life worthy of the gospel 1963
[20:40] remember Israel walk day and night by
[20:42] the pillar of fire when that pillar of
[20:44] fire moved they moved with it and
[20:45] remember it was the fire at night the
[20:47] cloud of day so it might come day or
[20:49] night any time but wherever it was there
[20:52] was a propitiation made that they would
[20:54] not fail to see it it was a light at
[20:55] night a cloud in the daytime and they
[20:57] followed it yes sir the same thing
[20:59] Martin Luther sort what did he do he
[21:01] came out of Catholicism what did they do
[21:04] they built a little fence around here
[21:05] where Lutheran's that's it when Wesley
[21:07] saw it moving right there he went what
[21:10] they do build a little fence around and
[21:11] said this is it where'd the light go
[21:13] move right on again Peter coughs aw
[21:15] where'd they go moves right out of the
[21:18] Wesleyan and Nazarene and so forth what
[21:20] did they do they built a little fence
[21:21] around it they call whether oneness with
[21:24] a Trinity whether United all this what
[21:25] did he do God moves right out of it see
[21:28] you cannot do that you've got to follow
[21:31] every day every hour of the day every
[21:33] step of the way you've got to be led by
[21:35] the Lord Jesus Christ if you if we don't
[21:38] we take an organizational life and the
[21:41] life that doesn't follow Christ daily is
[21:44] not worthy
[21:45] now what as an organizational life
[21:48] because it's easy to throw that on the
[21:50] denominational system but the message is
[21:53] not you know this is not a pitch walking
[21:55] message this message justice has been
[21:58] sent to mold us and shape us into the
[21:59] image of the word how Lewis does not all
[22:02] that's for that person what about me
[22:04] amen
[22:05] and so what is an organizational life an
[22:07] organizational life is a life your
[22:10] arranged for yourself instead of letting
[22:13] God lead you you can organize your life
[22:16] yourself you can organize your Christian
[22:19] life yourself and you actually become an
[22:22] organization you following me hey this
[22:25] comes down home amen
[22:27] so we don't want to organize you say but
[22:30] I am following the revealed word of this
[22:32] day if it's not a heartfelt real
[22:35] revealed love for God then it becomes an
[22:38] organization we're not called to have a
[22:41] working relationship with our Lord Jesus
[22:44] Christ amen so how is it done you know
[22:47] to be organized well you say you've got
[22:49] all the doctrine sorted out how you
[22:51] should dress and and what you believe I
[22:54] believe it cannot do and can do
[22:56] that's all organize see if it's just if
[22:59] it's just well you have your document of
[23:01] faith this is how you should live and
[23:03] it's just a arrangement it's just like a
[23:05] job you're following me I'm gonna go
[23:08] babe a bit slow but we're going okay
[23:11] we're going so
[23:13] and just like a job this is your job
[23:15] description I mean this is your job
[23:18] description this is your conditions of
[23:20] work this is how you should dress it
[23:21] your worksite whatever more and you take
[23:24] that same thing and you bring it into
[23:26] the into the message it's the same thing
[23:28] if it's not a heartfelt relationship all
[23:33] it is then there's an organizational
[23:35] life Amen you say well you've painted a
[23:38] lot of people with a lot of brushes no
[23:40] that's that's how it is if it's not from
[23:42] here if it's if it's from here it's not
[23:45] gonna that's why people if it's only in
[23:47] their mind then what happens is they hit
[23:49] a bump in the road they come to a
[23:50] midlife crisis or some Junction in their
[23:52] life they always fall off the track
[23:54] because they're not tied to the absolute
[23:56] of God revealing himself in his word to
[23:58] them amen so we don't want to be that
[24:00] kind of way we want to be led by the
[24:02] pillar of fire personally I mean Moses
[24:05] knew the pillar of fire and that's why
[24:07] he was victorious and bringing Israel
[24:10] out of Egypt taking them up to your to
[24:13] Sinai all the way up to the border and
[24:15] then Joshua met that same God hallelujah
[24:18] Koren Nathan did not know them and
[24:21] that's why they rose up that's why
[24:23] they're people who who join themselves
[24:25] with with with Moab different ones they
[24:27] didn't know the pillar fire personally
[24:29] they had a working relationship we're
[24:33] not called to have a working
[24:34] relationship the Bible is a love letter
[24:37] not a rule book right but it will be a
[24:41] rule book to all those who are not the
[24:43] Bride of Christ amen you take you
[24:46] contrast the rich young ruler with the
[24:49] woman at the well the rich young ruler
[24:50] comes up good master what can I do what
[24:54] can I do that I may inherit eternal life
[24:57] there's no pricking in the heart like
[24:58] like x2 he's wanting what can I do well
[25:01] it's happening he's trying to change his
[25:03] job description right he wants to change
[25:06] his pay his wages he wants eternal life
[25:08] as the wages how can I change and then
[25:11] so and then so he says what can I do
[25:13] and then so Jesus approaches them as the
[25:16] return rule or approaches them you know
[25:19] the law do this do this do this he says
[25:21] I've been doing this in this in this one
[25:23] thing now lakor's you've got a by Potter
[25:26] takeaway yogurt
[25:27] they shall I sell all that you have give
[25:30] our your identity
[25:31] give it up what you think you are take
[25:34] up your cross and follow me and he
[25:36] couldn't do it because it didn't fit his
[25:39] preconceived idea but yet he was a good
[25:41] church member outstanding member of
[25:43] society he was a good message believer
[25:46] but he did he just had a working
[25:48] relationship the woman at the well very
[25:51] different
[25:52] she didn't begin to speak to him when
[25:54] when Jesus says bring me a drink and
[25:57] they began to talk about Wells and then
[25:59] he said woman if you knew the water I
[26:00] could give I mean that that your drink
[26:03] of this and never thirst again she
[26:06] didn't say no what do I need to do said
[26:08] give me a drink
[26:09] give me in this water hallelujah and
[26:13] then she said now we know where Messiah
[26:15] cometh he'll tell us these things and
[26:18] brother Bram said that the light
[26:19] quickened the seed and her salt holy and
[26:22] she God redeemed amen
[26:24] why is that because it was a because she
[26:26] was part of the bride it wasn't a rule
[26:29] book it was a love affair hallelujah and
[26:32] that's why the Bible I trust to you is a
[26:35] love letter Lori it's not a rule book
[26:40] it's a love letter but those who just
[26:43] have a working relationship
[26:44] it's a rule book amen and that's why the
[26:47] critics raised up they say are you just
[26:49] bunch of rules no no no to you it might
[26:52] be to me it's not close to me it's a
[26:54] love letter hallelujah when I came into
[26:57] this message where I met the Lord Jesus
[26:59] Christ I had no church to go to people
[27:01] didn't tell me where I needed to stop
[27:03] and do whatever more I just listened to
[27:05] the tapes I read my Bible and I said
[27:07] Lord cleanse me of everything this
[27:09] country to your word that you can come
[27:11] and dwell in me and he transformed my
[27:13] life hallelujah I don't need to say I
[27:16] need to give up this and what shall I do
[27:18] Lord
[27:19] change me Lord transform me hallelujah
[27:21] and that's what he did hallelujah and I
[27:25] follow living witness at works
[27:27] Amen that's why we don't want some
[27:30] organizational life we want the life of
[27:32] God
[27:33] lujah and that's what we have Laurine
[27:38] amen now it's very vital it's very very
[27:45] vital that we don't take and I think I
[27:48] don't know who said it but this has been
[27:49] on my heart for a couple of weeks but we
[27:52] don't want to let the word I think it
[27:54] was on Wednesday someone said it but
[27:55] anyway
[27:56] never let the word become common never
[28:00] ever Scofield and his notes now brother
[28:03] bear I'm said summer Scofield's notes a
[28:05] right and some are not right any
[28:06] preacher from a lot of them cuz barter
[28:09] melikhaya Falls ministry was to type the
[28:11] Lucien's right
[28:13] they all had partial truth down through
[28:14] the ages they weren't totally wrong
[28:16] right but then he said part of that
[28:18] ministry was to type the leucine so he
[28:20] did and he said so summer Scofield's
[28:22] notes are right some are not right but
[28:24] he would took when when Scofield was
[28:26] laying out the mysteries of the kingdom
[28:28] from and the Gospel of Matthew and he
[28:32] lays out what the mysteries of the
[28:33] kingdom of the brother room adds to it
[28:35] when he preaches services it's the time
[28:37] of the end but Scofield says about the
[28:39] mysteries of the kingdom a mystery in
[28:41] the scripture as a previously hidden
[28:43] truth now divinely revealed but in which
[28:47] a supernatural element still remains
[28:50] despite the revelation so what I'm so
[28:53] the reason but me I see that is that
[28:56] sure oh I know what the doctrine is but
[28:59] there's a supernatural element contained
[29:01] in that truth and that is the important
[29:05] thing
[29:05] amen that when God opens his truth
[29:07] there's a supernatural power is released
[29:09] but there's a supernatural element right
[29:12] and so now there is a supernatural power
[29:14] released as revelation breaks forth upon
[29:17] you amen and it may be well you've heard
[29:20] many many things to be very elementary
[29:22] but never let it become common because
[29:25] the reason that it may be ministered on
[29:26] is because there's a supernatural
[29:27] element which can contain within it
[29:29] needs to be released to us amen so so
[29:33] that's why it's so important when we
[29:36] come to worship the Lord we come to
[29:38] church who are we worshiping are we are
[29:42] we here based on who's around us amen
[29:46] yo contingents are like a bars of a
[29:48] castle and can be a massive thing or it
[29:51] can be a little thing they can still be
[29:54] bars right buzz buzz stop people coming
[29:58] in and out of a castle and offenses you
[30:00] think about offenses really only hurt
[30:03] the person who's offended amen
[30:06] as that's why it says Paul says in the
[30:08] book of Hebrews do not lead a root of
[30:10] bitterness grow within you
[30:11] whereby many are defiled so it may never
[30:14] be the person who caused the offense but
[30:16] it's those who get hurt and offended
[30:18] they're the ones that are actually still
[30:19] stuck right so it actually does you or
[30:23] does us more harm than good
[30:25] to hold on to things it doesn't do the
[30:27] other person they could be on they could
[30:29] have forgotten they could have moved on
[30:30] completely but now we're still carrying
[30:32] something and a slight bars of a castle
[30:34] we just stuck I want to walk on don't
[30:38] you hallelujah so now so when we come to
[30:41] church
[30:42] we're here to worship the Lord Jesus
[30:44] Christ
[30:45] so and and I'll come into this later but
[30:49] you know the main thing about walk our
[30:51] life should be what has impact upon us
[30:55] his influence right our whole life
[30:58] should be out of because he met us right
[31:01] our whole life so when we come to church
[31:05] now and we worship our worship should
[31:10] not be in a condition of who's around us
[31:13] right so we shouldn't be louder or
[31:15] quieter because of someone else that has
[31:19] nothing to do with it when I come and
[31:21] worship I don't worship because you're
[31:23] here I worship Him because he's here and
[31:26] because he saved me I can't speak for
[31:28] you but he saved me transform me he
[31:31] redeem me heal me
[31:32] he set me free amen he broke the power
[31:35] of sin and death off me
[31:36] that's why I worship Him because of what
[31:38] he has done to me hallelujah because
[31:41] he's opened his word to me amen
[31:43] so so our worship should never be based
[31:46] upon well there that person's here or
[31:47] this person's here so I better not maybe
[31:49] shout or scream because this person or I
[31:51] better be loud because this person's
[31:53] here why
[31:56] it's not you them and God it's you and
[32:00] God Shannon with God in the secret place
[32:04] hallelujah
[32:05] but now the problem is the devil comes
[32:07] along because there's power your the
[32:10] scripture says we believe and therefore
[32:12] speak right so if you believe you've got
[32:15] a you got to respond I'm into the wood
[32:18] you've got to respond to it you can't
[32:19] just sit back and shell up I mean you
[32:21] really want God to have a great effect
[32:23] in your life you've got to audibly say
[32:25] from your heart yeah god bless all the
[32:42] hard work amen so you know take the clip
[32:51] off too but you know we well you know
[32:59] the devil doesn't want us to respond
[33:01] turn me down a bit you know I went so
[33:07] there's a testimony and I've already
[33:09] shared it but when we had the Kemp went
[33:11] down to brother Greg's family camp in
[33:12] Christchurch last evening service I went
[33:15] up for prayer I said I want a revival
[33:17] for myself and and revolver for the
[33:20] church and a few other things and then
[33:22] after you pray for me he said go receive
[33:24] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:26] and my response was I receive it that's
[33:29] what I said back because I wasn't saying
[33:31] it to brother Craig I sang it to the
[33:33] Lord and the Spirit of God came down
[33:35] upon me Holly and I had a Jubilee I mean
[33:38] but the reason is because I responded
[33:40] saying yes I receive it that's why it's
[33:43] so important to say Amen I mean to
[33:47] respond you've got to actually break
[33:49] break that sound barrier the devil
[33:51] doesn't want us to shout and rejoice and
[33:53] be free I mean because we you know if
[33:56] someone's real teens
[34:05] okay if someone's really tense and you
[34:09] go to speaking to them about something
[34:11] very important how do you think that's
[34:13] going to go might be a very difficult
[34:16] conversation right but if the person's
[34:19] relaxed and they're happy and
[34:22] everything's fine
[34:23] you can go speak to them about the same
[34:25] thing and it can go way better and it
[34:28] will impact them a lot more why cuz
[34:30] they're free they're relaxed they're
[34:31] happy hallelujah it's the same thing
[34:33] when we come into church hallelujah
[34:37] I like to wonder I mean it's funny when
[34:44] you you know you see some people's face
[34:48] you can see some looks like it when I go
[34:50] like this like a little colorless some
[34:52] people go why what's gonna happen I
[34:56] don't know myself sometimes you start
[35:00] doing some things and you're a man you
[35:02] like I can't believe I just did that oh
[35:06] yeah hey we're gonna be free I mean
[35:09] that's why you know what we're coming to
[35:11] church don't worry
[35:12] don't worry about anyone else who cares
[35:15] about them oh you being selfish
[35:18] absolutely I want to meet my god I
[35:21] wouldn't wish my love for him I want to
[35:23] give them praise I want to say thank you
[35:26] Lord our Lord enjoys worship our Lord
[35:29] enjoys it when we come down we begin to
[35:31] praise Him he's a yeah his angels gather
[35:34] they begin to watch they can't sing and
[35:36] rejoice I can't join in they probably
[35:39] say they say I wonder what it's like
[35:41] they can't imagine it they don't know
[35:44] what it's like to be redeemed hallelujah
[35:46] they just servants they know they're a
[35:48] team once and then you know and then you
[35:51] know then the Lord comes down we begin
[35:53] to rejoice and he says I know Oh
[35:56] hallelujah I redeemed you I I took on
[36:00] your iniquity your sins are upon me I
[36:02] carried them up Calvary that day I was
[36:05] sick I know what it's like to be sick I
[36:06] know what it's like to me afflicted I
[36:08] know if I can be tempted on old voice I
[36:10] understand what you've been going
[36:12] through I know what it's like to
[36:13] overcome sorry joy say you're ever
[36:15] me hallelujah you know what it's like he
[36:18] goes through a great thing you come out
[36:20] the other side and you see someone come
[36:22] out the other side as well yyyyyes good
[36:24] you can do it oh yeah I know it can be
[36:26] done
[36:27] why should you cheering them on we want
[36:29] to cheer each other on hallelujah
[36:32] I been said now we don't want to but see
[36:35] the devil he wants us to be quiet
[36:38] there's no glue on these seats okay
[36:42] I just say that now oh really would be
[36:45] big Luke the devil puts glue the devil
[36:48] tries to put some tape over here
[36:50] be silent sit still no devil you sit
[36:53] still you shut up and sit down I'm going
[36:56] to worship God hallelujah
[36:59] because the thing is now when we really
[37:01] pull we really say Amen we're not a
[37:03] meaning the minister we're not a meeting
[37:06] the minister you you're a meaning you're
[37:08] agreeing with the word and when you
[37:11] agree with the word a metre releases
[37:13] power to you it releases the Holy Ghost
[37:16] to you I mean when you agree with the
[37:18] word so it's very important to say Amen
[37:21] it's very important to be locked in
[37:22] don't be distracted by anything don't be
[37:25] don't be sidetracked by all of this and
[37:27] this and this that's you know what that
[37:29] is it's called the fiery darts of the
[37:31] devil he has a bow any fires arrows but
[37:35] we have a shield of faith hallelujah
[37:38] I sealed her face and and we're hot and
[37:41] were called to hold it up withstand the
[37:43] fiery darts of the enemy and you know
[37:46] the greatest way to actually withstand
[37:48] the fiery darts what does he fire at you
[37:50] oh brother songs or the song soda and
[37:54] you know you know the best way to
[37:56] actually hold up that shield of faith
[37:58] how do you how do you deflect those
[37:59] always give them the benefit of the
[38:01] doubt it's really that simple
[38:05] are they wouldn't really say to em oh
[38:07] they would really they didn't really
[38:08] mean that hallelujah it goes a long way
[38:11] I mean but then if it turns the other
[38:14] way and you agree
[38:15] take that done pull into yourself we're
[38:17] gonna be a casualty on the battlefield
[38:19] the only casualty on this battlefield is
[38:21] Satan oh yeah
[38:24] only one Amen so the more and then also
[38:31] the more you Amy in him the Lord you
[38:35] will cause the minister to say things he
[38:36] never even thought he is saved he had
[38:39] come to your address the Lord will not
[38:40] the man right brother Ram said we are
[38:43] not feeding off the mind of them of a
[38:45] man but we're feeding of the body word
[38:46] of the son of man this is you're not
[38:48] feeding off my thoughts he's saying
[38:50] you're feeding off the body word the
[38:52] Lord Jesus Christ himself hallelujah
[38:55] amen so the more our faith pulls on the
[38:59] gift even even if someone singing a
[39:02] special you in Turin you say mean what
[39:05] happens then you're actually receiving
[39:06] because when people are singing it's
[39:08] this is not an entertainment david got
[39:12] us harp he played in Saul's palace and
[39:14] it brought God down the devil got cast
[39:17] out why do people sing specials amen
[39:20] that God would come down and the devil
[39:22] gets cast out hallelujah that's why you
[39:25] know Saul he had that spirit is all you
[39:27] know that evil spirit is all tormented
[39:29] in his mind what happens a spirit and
[39:31] you may not be possessed but you could
[39:33] be a priest all torn up in here amen and
[39:36] then and then someone who's anointed
[39:38] begins to sing a special and then
[39:40] afterward you like oh I enjoyed that
[39:41] that was nice what's happening that
[39:44] tormenting is gone away hallelujah now
[39:47] you're a peace or wasn't that a nice
[39:49] song I enjoyed it what's happened now
[39:50] you can relax the devil's been kicked
[39:53] out oh yeah I mean you know I'm just
[39:57] trying to say you know this is what
[39:59] happens sometimes we think of some you
[40:01] know but this is how it just really
[40:03] works how lujah amen okay so never let
[40:10] the would become common amen and we
[40:13] don't and figures you say well I can't
[40:17] say I mean I'm not in the right place
[40:19] well I'll say this we agree with the
[40:23] word not based upon what the devil is
[40:26] telling you you are right or what you
[40:29] think you are
[40:30] Amen we don't agree with the word
[40:33] because well I'm this person no I agree
[40:36] with it because it's what G
[40:38] sis I am a mink Caleb and Joshua they I
[40:42] know I've said it many times but they
[40:44] had the same whip marks and slave
[40:46] beatings that the rest of us are all had
[40:48] that were slaves in Egypt but something
[40:50] in them said we have a land and we're
[40:53] gonna go occupy that land we are not
[40:55] slaves no more amen
[40:58] so they weren't agreeing with the word
[40:59] that came through Moses because of what
[41:01] they felt they were they agreed with it
[41:03] because God said go take your land it
[41:05] belongs to you hallelujah it's the same
[41:07] thing with us I'm it's not well I'm this
[41:09] I'm this frail person whatever whatever
[41:11] would no no look at what God says you
[41:13] are and agree with that Amen hallelujah
[41:19] Amen now see then that's why mine
[41:22] battles come on it's cuz the devil is
[41:24] trying to rob us of our victory and
[41:26] distract us of what we have and for us
[41:30] to focus on his nonsense and not the
[41:31] Lord I mean this got a first job three I
[41:37] see time is running away let's catch up
[41:41] time through John first John I believe
[41:45] first John three and one behold what
[41:56] manner of love the father has bestowed
[41:58] upon us that we should be called the
[42:00] sons of God therefore the world knoweth
[42:03] us not because it knew him not beloved
[42:06] now we are the sons of God and it does
[42:08] not yet appear what we shall be but we
[42:11] know when he shall appear we shall be
[42:14] like him for we shall see him as he is
[42:17] we have living at the time of the
[42:20] appearing at the coming of the Lord amen
[42:22] brother Brahim see that there's the
[42:23] difference between the appearing in the
[42:24] coming right the coming you could say is
[42:26] the meeting in the year but he's already
[42:27] come in spirit form but he's appearing
[42:29] among us so when we shall see him we
[42:32] shall be like him we're seeing him now
[42:34] his word is manifesting I mean so when
[42:37] we see him and we and we do see him we
[42:39] shall be like him so he see him working
[42:41] among us this is round the world not
[42:43] just in these four walls I'm glad it's
[42:45] that case hallelujah the bride around
[42:47] the world is coming because they are she
[42:49] is see
[42:50] him and she is becoming like him I mean
[42:53] we're becoming more like his word
[42:54] because we see his word manifested
[42:57] hallelujah we shall see him for for we
[43:00] shall see him as he is and every man
[43:02] that has this hope in him purifies
[43:05] himself even as he is pure
[43:08] now the word hope we know in the Bible
[43:10] that means to anticipate usually with
[43:13] pleasure and expectation or a confidence
[43:16] so every man that has this expectation
[43:20] to to to be like him see him as he is
[43:24] right
[43:24] so everyone who has this expectation
[43:27] this confidence or anticipating this
[43:30] will you with pleasure
[43:32] purifies himself even as he is pure now
[43:35] when I'm talking about this now I'm
[43:37] talking about getting rid of offenses
[43:41] getting rid of you know we don't want
[43:44] those things we want to be pure of those
[43:46] things we want to be cleansed amen now
[43:50] whosoever committeth sin transgresseth
[43:51] also the law for the sin i so for sin is
[43:55] the transgression of the law and you
[43:57] know that he was manifested to take away
[43:59] our sins and in him is no sin whosoever
[44:02] abideth in him sinneth not whosoever
[44:04] sinneth hath not seen him neither
[44:06] knoweth him now we know that him that
[44:09] sinneth me to continue to practice but
[44:10] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[44:12] from all sin if we confess our sins he's
[44:14] faithful and just to forgive us amen
[44:17] never ever let the devil get you down
[44:19] with your failures amen let the Lord
[44:23] lift you up he focus on his work I meant
[44:26] now we know we're living at a time when
[44:30] in does the fullness of adoption comes
[44:32] we're waiting for the adoption to wit
[44:34] the redemption of our bodies now I want
[44:38] to I want to read this from from this
[44:43] from show us the father and it will
[44:45] satisfy us he says God lives forever
[44:48] God's eternal God can't die they killed
[44:51] the body Jesus but God raised it up
[44:53] again he's alive forevermore his spirit
[44:55] lives in the church today his spirit is
[44:57] here now has spirits among his people he
[44:59] proves herself not by something he could
[45:02] prove himself alive
[45:03] by this he could prove himself alive by
[45:05] the sunset he could prove herself alive
[45:07] by his word he could prove herself alive
[45:09] by a spirit that's in the building now
[45:11] by men and women who will commit
[45:13] themselves to him amen
[45:16] you can make yourself to him and say
[45:17] what happens brother branham when you
[45:19] see those visions it's nothing in the
[45:21] world but just having a gift to know how
[45:24] to relax myself get William Branham off
[45:27] to one side that's the biggest enemy I
[45:29] got as William Branham he's always in my
[45:32] way that's why we've got to relax push
[45:35] ourselves off to one side that's what a
[45:37] gift is getting yourself out of the way
[45:39] allowing God to use you I mean he's
[45:42] always in my way he's always in God's
[45:44] way I will say he always gets in God's
[45:46] way he gets too tired he don't want to
[45:48] do this he don't want to do that if I
[45:50] can just crucify that guy God can use it
[45:53] God can use this body use this
[45:54] microphone it's a mute till I speak in
[45:57] it or someone else speaks in it but it
[45:59] can't speak itself how can a man see a
[46:01] vision how could a man heal a sick
[46:03] person how could laying on of hands
[46:05] bring a dead baby to life and so forth
[46:07] how could it ever do it it's not the man
[46:09] it's God in that man just the same God
[46:11] as in the sunset God's everywhere
[46:14] hallelujah so you know I'm sure all of
[46:17] us have that expectation of that hope
[46:19] that when we when he appears we shall be
[46:22] like him fool see him as he is and we're
[46:24] living in that hour right so if we're
[46:26] living in that hour he's appearing among
[46:28] us then everything else you go off to
[46:30] one side right because ultimately what
[46:33] really matters in life you know we talk
[46:36] about issues and problems and they can
[46:38] be very real I'm not diminishing
[46:39] anything that's happened but at the end
[46:42] of the day you put them on one side and
[46:44] you put what God's election that I'm
[46:46] going to be that I'm the Bride of Christ
[46:48] he's appearing among me he's revealing
[46:50] himself to me I'm becoming more like
[46:52] like him every day he's fighting my
[46:54] battles he's leading me he's redeem me
[46:56] he's washed me he's transformed me well
[46:59] you take that on one side and you take
[47:01] that what the devil is trying to do to
[47:03] you what really should outweigh a man I
[47:07] think just tip that scale up because it
[47:09] doesn't matter and just let the Lord
[47:10] have his way I mean but as I believe I
[47:14] said in the beginning it's the thing
[47:16] that M
[47:17] access the most will be what we live
[47:20] through in life right so you just take
[47:24] it in the natural you know we someone
[47:28] who had a big massive trauma in their
[47:29] life like a car accident
[47:31] yeah I'm talk about physically now that
[47:34] will impact them the rest of their life
[47:36] how they can operate in their body right
[47:39] they could be crippled they could be in
[47:40] a wheelchair whatever more but then if
[47:42] but they never say the Lord came along
[47:44] or say in the natural realm Edison came
[47:46] along and totally restored their bodies
[47:48] that they had normal function again
[47:51] what's gonna have the biggest influence
[47:52] it won't be the car accident amore it'll
[47:55] be the healing right it'll be the
[47:58] healing that will impact the person not
[47:59] the character anymore and it's the same
[48:01] thing with the Lord you know what what
[48:05] what governs our lives I'm just trying
[48:07] to look for the right words but what
[48:08] governs our lives has the greatest
[48:10] influence in our lives I think it is
[48:13] easy to say well I'm a Christian but
[48:14] what is actually living through you
[48:16] what's the greatest influence you know
[48:20] Amen now brother brown spoke about the
[48:24] Apostle Paul he spoke about a few when
[48:28] he when he preached the sermon the
[48:29] absolute or the absolute his homework
[48:32] class go listen to the two to absolute
[48:36] amen now now how could so how we could
[48:41] go through the scriptures daniel has
[48:43] absolute Shadrach Meshach Abednego there
[48:45] absolute David has absolute they all
[48:48] absolute that absolute as the final say
[48:50] the final authority you know we all have
[48:53] to have an absolute and we all do have
[48:55] an absolute every person on this earth
[48:58] actually has an absolute whether they
[49:00] realize it or not everyone has an
[49:02] absolute now Paul had one too the one we
[49:06] are reading about he had a
[49:07] christ-centered life I mean so he had a
[49:10] christ-centered call and that was his
[49:13] absolute that's the reason he wasn't
[49:14] afraid of what
[49:15] Agrippa would say standing there Agrippa
[49:18] was a Jew as we know and so then when he
[49:21] is standing before these kings and
[49:23] things God had already told them he
[49:25] would stand there so he had an absolute
[49:27] so he told exactly the heavenly vision
[49:30] said I am NOT I wasn't just dishonorable
[49:33] - it did not misjudge it I didn't
[49:35] misbehave myself but he held to and was
[49:38] not disobedient it carried out to the
[49:41] minute for it wasn't absolute and any
[49:43] and any christ-centered life that's your
[49:47] absolute I mean when the when the god of
[49:50] the message when the God of the Bible
[49:51] meets you hallelujah that becomes your
[49:55] absolute I mean because you know now the
[49:57] word is an absolute I mean there's no
[50:00] there's no doubt in the scripture
[50:01] anymore you know it's God's Word
[50:03] hallelujah because you've met the author
[50:05] of the word amen and that's like the
[50:08] Apostle Paul you know many things he
[50:09] wrote he didn't he didn't a reference to
[50:11] the Old Testament he just said it I
[50:14] meant but because he meant the author of
[50:16] the Old Testament he could say you know
[50:19] there was no reference he had for the
[50:20] Lord himself shall to see him with a
[50:21] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[50:23] the Trump of God that did in Christ to
[50:25] be raised
[50:25] he didn't reference it with anything
[50:27] only he brought it out I'll show you a
[50:29] mystery not it you know he didn't say
[50:32] that write it down because everyone else
[50:34] was saying it no because God revealed it
[50:35] to him I mean but because he knew the
[50:38] God of the Old Testament he could say
[50:39] that and the only way you can actually
[50:41] believe in a 3-fold this tension of God
[50:43] in the river yo and the rapture the
[50:45] shout the voice in the trumpet was
[50:47] because you believed the Apostle Paul's
[50:48] writings amen and if he knew that God
[50:52] same God the Apostle Paul knew then you
[50:54] say Amen and then you could say to
[50:57] someone near what you know what we just
[50:59] heard at this meeting the Lord's gonna
[51:01] see him with a shout the voice and the
[51:02] Trump of God that didn't cross the race
[51:04] and someone asked you who told you that
[51:06] well the Apostle Paul did Paul of Tarsus
[51:09] yeah he did and some people say no I
[51:12] can't believe that but if you had a
[51:15] christ-centered life you'd know the same
[51:17] God that spoke through Moses spoke
[51:19] through Paul hallelujah same thing with
[51:23] brother Branham I mean just these things
[51:26] it's all in the scripture but people
[51:28] don't look they just take a snapshot of
[51:29] what the devil says and they take that
[51:31] swallow down and walk on and stead of
[51:33] waiting upon the Lord say Lord is a word
[51:35] prophet it'll be in here amen
[51:38] no so any Christ centered life that's
[51:42] your absolute the word becomes your apps
[51:44] amen now since meeting him face to face
[51:47] on the road to Damascus that was that
[51:49] meant so much to Paul now remember he
[51:52] was a scholar beforehand he was a mighty
[51:54] man in the scriptures but he didn't have
[51:56] any type post but the Sanhedrin would
[51:59] back him up in a diploma and a great
[52:01] teacher that that was his absolute
[52:03] that's what Vietnam needs it's not a
[52:05] it's not a church backing up but meeting
[52:07] God and themselves then he will become
[52:10] their absolute but that's all of us -
[52:12] amen that means he won't be tossed
[52:15] around by culture or criticism or
[52:17] questions or whatever more if we're
[52:19] anchored on the Word of God I mean then
[52:21] we will endure
[52:22] he was Amen the only thing he had his
[52:25] absolute was only as strong as his
[52:27] organization was that's all the stronger
[52:30] he could be and he was working faithful
[52:32] to that and he was taking Christians and
[52:34] binding them and making havoc of them
[52:36] and he even stone Stevens why cuz that
[52:40] was his absolute and now but he hadn't
[52:43] there was an organizational life we
[52:45] don't want to have an organizational
[52:47] life in the message we're not called to
[52:49] it that's not the reason we're believers
[52:51] we're believers because we met the Lord
[52:54] Jesus Christ who is his word amen
[52:58] now brother Brown speaks about a house
[53:00] being built I'm so I'm just throwing
[53:02] these things out there I trust we the
[53:04] Lord will put it all together I believe
[53:05] it isn't us same direction but he's
[53:07] speaking about a house being built and
[53:09] and and a brother here yo this is
[53:12] nothing early in his ministry he is
[53:13] having a debate with someone about the
[53:15] baptism and then that man had a dream
[53:17] that night about building a house and in
[53:20] the and in the so he has given the plans
[53:22] and he and he built this house but he
[53:23] rearranged it cuz he thought no it's not
[53:25] quite right but then the one who gave
[53:27] him the job to build the house looked at
[53:29] the plans looked at the houses said no
[53:30] this is not right
[53:31] tear it down and build it again like I
[53:33] said and when he woke up he realized the
[53:35] Lord is telling him no you have to be
[53:37] built according to the blueprint so he
[53:40] got rebaptised name our Lord Jesus
[53:41] Christ cuz that's the Bluenose Isle Lou
[53:44] you the blueprint if the house goes out
[53:46] country - the blueprint the contractor
[53:47] will tear it down and rebuild it but
[53:49] it's got to go to the blueprint no
[53:53] matter what your experience is then if
[53:54] something and you tells you that the
[53:56] Bible isn't true
[53:58] that power of God the apostles prophets
[53:59] teachers and pastors and the gifts of
[54:01] the Spirit just isn't the same as it was
[54:03] when it flow through the Apostles at
[54:06] Pentecost there are something wrong with
[54:08] your absolute it has to it has to tie to
[54:11] a denominational Creed a seat of gods
[54:13] Bible then he said both heavens and
[54:15] earth will pass away but my word shall
[54:17] never fail watch what your absolute is
[54:19] you might be absolutely sure that you're
[54:22] in a good fellowship with the pasta and
[54:23] might be absolutely sure that you're in
[54:26] fellowship with a district priests
[54:28] peretta and might be absolutely sure
[54:30] that you're in fellowship with the
[54:31] bishop or some other great man in your
[54:33] church but that then your absolute isn't
[54:37] Jesus Christ upon this rock I'll put my
[54:40] absolute and the gates of Hell shall not
[54:42] prevail against it spiritual revelation
[54:44] of who he is and knowing all right now
[54:47] when you become like Paul having the
[54:49] same absolute that he had a
[54:51] christ-centered life as a different life
[54:53] than what you once had and it might have
[54:56] been a very religious life that you
[54:58] lived amen if you can read in that
[55:02] Scripture something that Christ has
[55:04] ordained or commissioned us to do and
[55:05] because of some twisting around if
[55:07] someone could tell you that that was for
[55:10] the disciples or someone else and then
[55:12] you don't hold on to that then Christ is
[55:15] not your absolute that person who led
[55:17] you out of the way as you absolute but
[55:20] if that word Christ still holds seed and
[55:23] he's your absolute you mustn't let
[55:24] anything stir us out of the way the word
[55:27] see so whatever leads us out of the way
[55:30] becomes our absolute because it has the
[55:33] greatest influence upon our lives now I
[55:36] won't just say that's people but I can
[55:39] say that as events in our life can lead
[55:42] us out of the way I'm bringing it down
[55:44] that angle now right so whatever leads
[55:48] us becomes our absolute the person that
[55:53] leads us the person or the thing that
[55:57] leads us becomes our absolute now so you
[56:00] know as I said before the greatest the
[56:02] thing that impacts us the most or
[56:04] influences in our life is what will
[56:06] manifest amen
[56:08] you take you take someone
[56:11] who becomes a like a Buddhist if
[56:14] Buddhism becomes the greatest influence
[56:16] in that person's life they will manifest
[56:18] it amen
[56:20] many people they will you know become a
[56:22] Buddhist they'll go join a monastery
[56:24] change their whole life why because it
[56:26] becomes their absolute amen you read
[56:28] many accounts I'm sure of of young
[56:31] people when when Isis was coming into
[56:33] its strength in a Caliphate or whatever
[56:35] as was being proclaimed and many people
[56:37] from overseas went to join Isis young
[56:40] people and it's because they begin to
[56:43] sing their videos online and reading
[56:45] their teaching then they begin to
[56:47] manifest it amen
[56:50] and many fled overseas to Syria to join
[56:52] up why because the spirit behind it
[56:55] anointed them and it became their
[56:57] absolute everything they did them was a
[57:00] result of it as I say Beck can be the
[57:03] same thing with her well I haven't done
[57:04] that kind of thing but then they can be
[57:06] a bruisin in the spirit something could
[57:08] happen and wound us in our spirit then
[57:10] then there Bruce brother is like a
[57:12] cancer cells get bruised then a demon
[57:15] power enters into that cell and then
[57:17] begins to multiply itself what happens
[57:19] life comes into it because if something
[57:21] happens and then our life goes very
[57:24] differently
[57:26] he takes sickness some people allow it
[57:29] to rule them and they put a far greater
[57:32] restriction upon themselves because of
[57:35] the sickness as opposed to those who
[57:37] have exactly the same thing wrong with
[57:38] them and don't allow it to rule them
[57:41] yeah you understand what I mean some
[57:43] people get sick and they go extreme
[57:45] right some people get sick they take the
[57:47] medication of course their lives have to
[57:49] changed a little bit because they're
[57:50] sick but they don't let it rule them you
[57:52] understand what I'm saying right so what
[57:55] has the greatest impact now and it's the
[58:00] same thing you say well those can be
[58:03] little things or it can be extreme yeah
[58:05] but what about those things will we
[58:07] allow past hurts and pain to they become
[58:12] our contentions and they allow and we
[58:14] allow them to be like bars of a castle
[58:17] okay men I'm doing massive things or
[58:20] little things we should be free
[58:23] I mean we should be free to worship if
[58:25] we feel to be quiet we can be quiet of a
[58:27] filter be loud we can be loud I mean I'm
[58:30] not saying gods on a cookie cutter I'm
[58:32] expecting Yvonne to dance on chairs but
[58:34] if you if you feel lead to and God's
[58:36] anointing you to do it shouldn't you be
[58:38] feel feel free to do it if you feel free
[58:40] just to sit in your seat and pray
[58:42] quietly
[58:43] shouldn't you be feel free to do it amen
[58:47] now so we have to the Apostle Paul it's
[58:52] amazing really you know he lists
[58:54] everything he went through shipwrecks
[58:56] beatings you know hunger failure
[58:58] whatever he was he went through a lot of
[59:00] things he said none of these things move
[59:01] me because those things the Lord meeting
[59:05] him on the road to Damascus was a far
[59:07] greater expect upon him and all of those
[59:10] things none of those things moved them
[59:12] amen and that should be the same with us
[59:15] if we've really met the Lord nothing
[59:19] should move us hallelujah nothing should
[59:23] really sure yo you know we get burdens
[59:26] for one another you see things get
[59:27] burdens be you both always just pray for
[59:29] that person pray for that thing but
[59:32] don't let it wear you down because we
[59:34] should be able to have a burden at the
[59:36] same time rejoice hallelujah
[59:38] I mean don't need anything rob you of
[59:41] the joy of your salvation you know the
[59:43] art no so so the armchair sportsman as
[59:47] the biggest critic any athlete has the
[59:50] armchair sportsman he is the biggest
[59:53] critic an athlete has okay and some of
[59:57] them analyze the game and far more
[1:00:00] greater detail than it ever would and
[1:00:03] they look at the replays and say what'd
[1:00:05] he do this here and they had gone to
[1:00:07] great discussion who's had friends like
[1:00:09] that who's been thanked that may be but
[1:00:14] that's it but the problem is their
[1:00:17] persons not on the field you know what
[1:00:20] if what if there's a big stadium right
[1:00:22] and you're playing I just take the
[1:00:24] soccer world cup or some Olympics 100
[1:00:26] you know and you're about to run I don't
[1:00:29] know who the fastest doesn't matter that
[1:00:31] guy you're about to run and there's a
[1:00:33] bunch of critics in the stands like this
[1:00:35] but yet they're on the
[1:00:36] colors of the you know the same nation
[1:00:38] they mean to be on his site and they're
[1:00:41] criticizing him what if he just said
[1:00:42] okay hold on you come down and run then
[1:00:44] you can take my place and they're out
[1:00:47] like this you know do you think they'll
[1:00:51] get off there do you think they'll come
[1:00:52] around 100 in this place they can't do
[1:00:54] it they're not cool to do it you know
[1:00:58] but now criticize long until the night
[1:01:01] they'll say I'll bet about this and
[1:01:02] listen II put you
[1:01:03] although most know most my new things
[1:01:07] but they can't do what the athlete does
[1:01:09] now listen friends we're all on the
[1:01:11] field amen
[1:01:14] we are not in the grandstands we're all
[1:01:16] on the field and then we're all we're
[1:01:18] all in the game hallelujah so who cares
[1:01:21] about what the armchair critics saying
[1:01:23] who cares about them don't worry about
[1:01:26] what the devil tries to put a cold
[1:01:27] breeze through the church all and tries
[1:01:29] to divide and whatever more who cares
[1:01:31] about that
[1:01:32] hallelujah listen I played soccer inhale
[1:01:35] I played it on sunshine I played it in
[1:01:38] rain well the first games I played when
[1:01:39] I was five every other team game was
[1:01:43] cancelled on the field it was just us
[1:01:44] and the other team we were playing five
[1:01:46] hailing down holy you just got to run a
[1:01:49] bit more don't need the cold Bobby hey
[1:01:52] you you want to play you want to play
[1:01:54] the game we're gonna win what about the
[1:01:56] hail in your eyeballs who cares
[1:01:58] we're having fun hallelujah it's the
[1:02:01] same thing with the I know it's a very
[1:02:02] crude illustration but aren't we are we
[1:02:04] running
[1:02:05] are we running this race this race is
[1:02:08] set before us
[1:02:09] I mean are we in a race he said well the
[1:02:12] devil's doing all kinds of things run
[1:02:15] he's just distracting you
[1:02:18] although sore focus no okay I've never
[1:02:20] really seen it but you watch a I've
[1:02:23] never seen a sportsman who's focused you
[1:02:26] see a real top athlete they're not
[1:02:27] running maybe children are like this
[1:02:29] because they're running on and seeing if
[1:02:30] mum and dad are watching them yeah when
[1:02:32] they're little but you know they get to
[1:02:34] a certain age they just get in the zone
[1:02:36] hallelujah and and I've never been in
[1:02:38] like a big European football stand but
[1:02:40] apparently the noise is so all like
[1:02:42] South America they don't sit there like
[1:02:44] us
[1:02:46] you know that was nice let's go home no
[1:02:49] they're all singing imagine that a
[1:02:51] hundred thousand or 80,000 people see
[1:02:53] seeing the same song what an atmosphere
[1:02:56] that the devil creates and his
[1:02:58] cathedrals hallelujah but do you think
[1:03:01] that those sports were really focused on
[1:03:03] what their fans are doing no they're
[1:03:05] focused on on on their role on the field
[1:03:07] and they're zoned out hallelujah we
[1:03:11] should be zoned out to what the Devils
[1:03:12] doing so we're not ignorant to his
[1:03:14] devices but no way we're gonna score a
[1:03:17] goal how are we going to run this over
[1:03:20] the final finish line maybe we're gonna
[1:03:22] the dead in Christ they're gonna rain
[1:03:24] we're gonna win over a finish line with
[1:03:27] the beddin holy and this one we're gonna
[1:03:28] do don't worry about the crowd don't
[1:03:30] worry about what this thing or chanting
[1:03:32] you know we had you know boarding school
[1:03:35] yeah boarding school we're all in
[1:03:36] different houses

[1:04:41] carrying the ball we're here to support
[1:04:42] you hallelujah amen now brother BAM says
[1:04:48] and then Jesus came in 1957 I'm just
[1:04:51] gonna read the whole quote he says the
[1:04:52] world is ready for judgment we're going
[1:04:55] to receive it now you mark my word it
[1:04:57] won't be too long until there's going to
[1:04:59] be
[1:05:00] something take place when I seen this
[1:05:02] revival that swept in a moment that's
[1:05:04] when over standing there then that
[1:05:06] Morningstar hanging yonder on the river
[1:05:08] twenty-something years ago he said the
[1:05:10] message will sweep the world and there's
[1:05:13] been an old-fashioned Pentecostal
[1:05:14] outpouring of the Holy Ghost and revival
[1:05:16] fires the healing services have covered
[1:05:18] the globe they have made many mistakes
[1:05:21] the newspapers right up here not longer
[1:05:24] off of Mackrell or McCall's when that
[1:05:31] man set my meeting up here and
[1:05:33] Minneapolis some of them mr. Peterson
[1:05:36] and em came telling me that he was in
[1:05:38] the meeting I said no doubt at all but I
[1:05:41] never searched but you never searched
[1:05:43] your article right you said aaand wrote
[1:05:46] that book and Al and had nothing to do
[1:05:47] with it then if that was such a mistake
[1:05:50] I believe the rest of its a lot of
[1:05:53] mistakes I see truly the Brethren might
[1:05:56] deserve a lot of criticism they made
[1:05:59] many mistakes that's all right but
[1:06:01] brother I drop those RL Israel want to
[1:06:04] get to my brother I'd rather be found on
[1:06:06] the battlefield making mistakes then be
[1:06:09] a criticized of the man who's trying to
[1:06:11] get soul saved to God what are you doing
[1:06:15] about it
[1:06:16] blessed be the name of the Lord God the
[1:06:18] power of the Lord Jesus Christ is just
[1:06:20] as sufficient tonight I'll say this
[1:06:22] morning it's the only raucous the only
[1:06:24] hope it's the only faith and Christ has
[1:06:27] presented it to you we will make
[1:06:30] mistakes
[1:06:31] but I'd rather be on the battlefield
[1:06:34] trying to get soul saved he says what
[1:06:37] are you doing about it
[1:06:38] hallelujah now let's go to Ephesians
[1:06:41] chapter 3 you know I'll learn - yeah but
[1:06:47] you know oh you know God's what you're
[1:06:51] one of God's greatest complaints against

[1:07:45] you according to the riches of his glory
[1:07:47] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:07:50] and the inner man that Christ may dwell
[1:07:52] in your hearts by faith that ye being
[1:07:55] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[1:07:57] to comprehend with All Saints what is
[1:07:59] the breadth and length and depth and
[1:08:01] height amen and to know the love of God
[1:08:05] which passeth knowledge that ye might be
[1:08:07] filled with all the fullness of God now
[1:08:10] under him that is able to do exceedingly
[1:08:12] abundantly above all we ask or think
[1:08:14] according to the measure that I'm
[1:08:16] according to the power that worketh in
[1:08:18] US and to him be the be glory in the
[1:08:21] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:08:23] ages world without end amen now we keep
[1:08:28] reading because you don't just stop

[1:08:35] height breadth depth you're the fullness
[1:08:37] of Christ the love of God you know you
[1:08:39] you'd be filled with all the fullness of
[1:08:41] God this is a that this would happen I
[1:08:43] therefore so for that reason that that
[1:08:45] would happen to you either prisoner of
[1:08:48] the Lord beseech you that you walk
[1:08:50] worthy of the vocation when you are
[1:08:52] called with all lowness and meekness
[1:08:54] with long-suffering forbearing one
[1:08:56] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[1:08:58] unity the Spirit in the bond of peace
[1:09:00] there is one body one spirit so I am one
[1:09:04] spirit even as you're called in one hope
[1:09:06] of your calling one Lord one faith one
[1:09:08] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[1:09:11] above all through all and in you all but
[1:09:13] unto every one of us is given grace
[1:09:16] according to the gift measure of the
[1:09:18] gift of Christ see saying because of
[1:09:21] this this is how we should be we all
[1:09:25] want to be filled with the fullness of
[1:09:26] God
[1:09:27] we don't just want a part of the land
[1:09:29] the son of man we want to be in the
[1:09:30] fullness of it
[1:09:31] well Ouya so because of that and that we
[1:09:33] would know the love of God because of
[1:09:35] that for that reason I beseech you this
[1:09:38] is how you should walk not to be
[1:09:40] offended I mean not to hold on to
[1:09:42] grudges but to let it go hallelujah to
[1:09:46] be with all lowness and meekness and
[1:09:47] with long-suffering your long-suffering
[1:09:50] means you suffer long Amen I'm just
[1:09:54] trying to you know what a change the
[1:09:56] atmosphere a bit but to but to have
[1:09:59] long-suffering means you suffer long and
[1:10:01] Peter plea said well how long should I
[1:10:03] be with someone would Peter asked Jesus
[1:10:06] how many times should I forgive someone
[1:10:08] seven times a day no seventy times seven
[1:10:11] there's 490 times a day you should
[1:10:14] forgive someone I don't know how many
[1:10:17] things to forgive a minute but that's a
[1:10:19] lot or how many how many offenses are
[1:10:22] now that you need to forgive and that's
[1:10:24] not just giving lip service there's
[1:10:25] actually generally forgiving and when
[1:10:27] you forgive someone you surrender the
[1:10:29] right to hold it against them that's how
[1:10:32] you know you've actually forgiven
[1:10:33] someone as you don't hold it against
[1:10:34] them anymore it's been given over amen
[1:10:37] and then we drop down we're still in
[1:10:40] Ephesians 4 let's drop down to verse 27
[1:10:41] neither give place to the devil so don't
[1:10:45] give him room I mean don't give him real
[1:10:48] estate in your mind or in your life
[1:10:49] don't give him room because the only way
[1:10:52] he can come in as a few retreat I mean
[1:10:55] so when an offense comes and you take on
[1:10:57] that offense what's happening you're
[1:10:58] retreating
[1:10:58] I mean you've given place to the devil
[1:11:01] now he can come in and Tom it now he's
[1:11:03] got a door he can come through we're not
[1:11:05] called to have a door to the to the
[1:11:07] devil
[1:11:08] hallelujah let him that still let him
[1:11:12] that stole steal no more but rather let
[1:11:15] him labor working with us hands the
[1:11:17] thing which is good that he may give to
[1:11:19] him that needeth let no corrupt
[1:11:21] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:11:23] but that which is good to the use of
[1:11:25] edifying that it may Minister grace unto
[1:11:28] the hearers why's he stay sir why does
[1:11:31] he say rather let him that stole steal
[1:11:32] no more but let him labor he's saying do
[1:11:35] the opposite because if you're a robber
[1:11:37] you're a thief then that that
[1:11:40] lodges in your conscious what's
[1:11:41] happening you've given place to the
[1:11:43] devil to work so now he's saying you
[1:11:45] really want to overcome that do the
[1:11:46] opposite
[1:11:47] that's what brother Graham says if you
[1:11:49] got a complex do the opposite of the
[1:11:50] complex it will shall be broken
[1:11:52] hallelujah amen
[1:11:55] and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:11:57] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[1:11:59] redemption let all bitterness and wrath
[1:12:01] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[1:12:02] be put away from you with all malice and
[1:12:05] be kind one to another tender-hearted
[1:12:07] forgiving one another even as God for
[1:12:10] Christ's sake hath forgiven you this is
[1:12:13] this is how we should be I don't want to
[1:12:16] be living in a castle I've got a whole
[1:12:18] land a castles a limited space a lot of
[1:12:22] powerful fortresses are quite small I
[1:12:24] don't want it to be walking and you know
[1:12:26] what a fortress really becomes a prison
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:30] you may be the king of that prison but
[1:12:32] you're still in a prison or the Queen I
[1:12:34] don't want to live in a little prison I
[1:12:36] want to walk up and down the land let's
[1:12:38] go into the field of joy hallelujah
[1:12:40] let's got the mouth and of peace let's
[1:12:42] go by the rumors of cold water follow
[1:12:44] these guys are the glades of fellowship
[1:12:46] whatever you want to call let's walk
[1:12:48] hallelujah let's enjoy the whole word
[1:12:50] amen now let's go to Jobe we just got to
[1:12:54] finish with Jobe you say well let's go
[1:12:56] the last chapter of Jobe now the key the
[1:13:01] key of all these things we'll read here
[1:13:06] you say well I've been wounded we've all
[1:13:11] been wounded amen and Jesus where did he
[1:13:16] get his wounds in the house of his
[1:13:17] friends that's what he's gonna tell the
[1:13:19] Jews when he comes back to them so it's
[1:13:23] closest to us hurt us the most amen Joe
[1:13:27] Bloggs on the street well he's Joe
[1:13:28] Bloggs on the street but someone you've
[1:13:30] been Worth and you love them and you
[1:13:32] know them then they hurt you that's the
[1:13:33] pain now job job jobs friends came to
[1:13:39] him and for the whole book of Job when
[1:13:41] they're talking they're actually lying
[1:13:42] to him about who God is
[1:13:43] I mean trying to confess that he's
[1:13:46] something that he's not you're a secret
[1:13:48] center this is why this happened here
[1:13:50] they were giving him they were actually
[1:13:52] lying to him
[1:13:53] but now notice it's got a job 42 and 7
[1:13:57] and we're going to read down to verse 10
[1:13:59] and it was so that after the Lord had
[1:14:03] spoken these words unto Jobe the Lord
[1:14:05] said to to LFS the temanite my wrath is
[1:14:10] kindled against thee and against thy two
[1:14:12] friends for ye have not spoken of me the
[1:14:15] thing that is right as my servant job
[1:14:17] hath therefore take unto you now seven
[1:14:20] bullets and seven Rams and go to my
[1:14:22] servant job and offer up yourselves our
[1:14:25] burnt offering and my servant job shall
[1:14:28] pray for you for him will I accept least
[1:14:31] I deal with you after your folly and
[1:14:33] that ye have not spoken of me the thing
[1:14:35] which is right like my servant job what
[1:14:38] they were actually telling lies they
[1:14:40] they thought they were telling the truth
[1:14:42] but they're actually telling lies they
[1:14:44] weren't saying what was true about the
[1:14:45] Lord so L Affairs the temanite and
[1:14:47] bildad the shuhite and and therefore the
[1:14:51] nemah night went and did according as
[1:14:54] the LORD commanded them and the Lord
[1:14:55] also accepted Jobe and the Lord now
[1:14:59] notice this is this is the final part I
[1:15:00] know brother Billy Williams preached on
[1:15:02] this but and the Lord turned the
[1:15:04] captivity of job when he prayed for his
[1:15:07] friends also the Lord gave job twice as
[1:15:11] much as he had before so job's trial
[1:15:14] finished when he prayed for his friends
[1:15:17] when he actually forgave him and
[1:15:19] interceded on their behalf because God's
[1:15:22] wrath was kindled against them amen
[1:15:26] and we're to be like Jobe amen
[1:15:31] and that's how job's captivity with it
[1:15:34] we see because no cuz I'm sure the
[1:15:35] question as well I've got this in my
[1:15:37] life I don't want bars of a car I don't
[1:15:39] want a contention of some of the passing
[1:15:42] how do I get rid of it you have to be
[1:15:44] able to intercede his brother fruity
[1:15:46] Easter seed about you know rid their
[1:15:47] quark to stand shoulder to shoulder with
[1:15:49] that person and lift them into the
[1:15:51] presence of God not to stand shoulder to
[1:15:54] shoulder with have been condemned him as
[1:15:55] a God you deal with this person no stand
[1:15:57] shoulder show them that when you come
[1:15:59] into the prints of God you will
[1:16:00] intercede on their behalf
[1:16:02] amen and that's how job's captivity was
[1:16:05] turned it wasn't his
[1:16:07] friends captivity it was jobs captivity
[1:16:10] and Joe had a big trial in his life and
[1:16:13] he wasn't asking for it he didn't
[1:16:14] deserve it and we don't deserve things
[1:16:17] that happened to us
[1:16:18] right really we don't but it happens
[1:16:22] because God wants to prove his salvation
[1:16:24] amen and many times we don't even know
[1:16:26] the reason why it happens but yet we've
[1:16:30] got to come to a place where our Lord I
[1:16:34] whoever did this to me you have to pray
[1:16:37] in such a way now if you actually have a
[1:16:40] real of relationship with the Lord Jesus
[1:16:41] Christ you'll be able to do it amen that
[1:16:45] you can actually say Lord forgive them
[1:16:47] what did Jesus do Jesus wasn't hanging
[1:16:50] on the cross saying no I don't mean this
[1:16:51] is a joke but he didn't say now are you
[1:16:53] gonna ask me to forgive you yet they
[1:16:57] were killing him he didn't care about
[1:16:59] how they treated him he just said Father
[1:17:01] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:17:02] do amen
[1:17:05] so his cry as he interceded for those
[1:17:08] who are killing him
[1:17:08] he was into sitting for those who
[1:17:10] rejected him he interceded for those who
[1:17:13] hated him and it was in the house of his
[1:17:15] friends he received the wounding he said
[1:17:18] Father forgive them they don't know what
[1:17:19] they do it's not friends if that's how
[1:17:24] we meet to be if our Lord can do that
[1:17:26] and we're made in His image we can't do
[1:17:30] that do
[1:17:32] listen he isn't amazing how the Lord
[1:17:34] just brings us down to a showdown what
[1:17:37] are you gonna do are you gonna hold on
[1:17:40] are you gonna let go I'd let go I'd say
[1:17:44] Lord so many times not why you know we
[1:17:47] come into a place well quite often if
[1:17:49] you look at yourself and you get
[1:17:51] disappointed with yourself something
[1:17:53] happens it's like a button just gets
[1:17:54] pushed and you explode you know
[1:17:57] something happens and you think it's
[1:17:59] like Lord why am I like this sometimes
[1:18:03] it can be something from your past that
[1:18:05] now you're reacting because of something
[1:18:08] that happened to you and you may be it
[1:18:11] could be years ago but there's a button
[1:18:14] and you kept up to it we don't have to
[1:18:18] be captive to anything we're not called
[1:18:20] to be captive to
[1:18:21] anything I mean we are called to be a
[1:18:24] free people hallelujah so I'm just going
[1:18:28] to close with that they stand to our
[1:18:31] feet shall we we have the musicians come
[1:18:34] I'm glad we are no longer slaves to
