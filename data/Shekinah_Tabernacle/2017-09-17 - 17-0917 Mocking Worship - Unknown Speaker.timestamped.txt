[40:22] you can't
[40:26] [Laughter]
[40:29] [Applause]
[40:34] yeah
[40:37] can't touch it
[40:40] you can
[40:42] [Applause]
[40:47] [Music]
[40:49] hallelujah amen amen
[40:53] god bless you friends Thank You
[40:55] musicians amen you can't never be the
[40:58] same
[41:01] Amen god bless you all good to have
[41:03] everyone here in the house of the Lord
[41:05] let's just turn to first Corinthians
[41:07] chapter 11 and we're also going to go to
[41:12] mark chapter 15 so 1st Corinthians 11
[41:30] and we read verses 1 down to verse 16
[41:33] and then we're going to mark chapter 15
[41:35] you're going to read verses 15 to 20 it
[41:38] says now I praise you brethren that you
[41:40] remember me and all things and keep the
[41:42] ordinances as I deliver them to you but
[41:45] I would have you know that the head of
[41:47] every man is Christ and the head of
[41:49] every woman is the man and the head of
[41:50] Christ is God every man praying or
[41:53] prophesying with his head covered
[41:54] dishonest as head which is Christ but
[41:57] every woman that prayeth or prophesieth
[41:59] he'd uncovered this Arthur ahead for
[42:02] that is even all one as if she were
[42:04] shaven for if the woman be not covered
[42:06] let her be sure also be sure but it
[42:09] would be but if it be ashamed for a
[42:11] woman to be shorn or shaven let it be
[42:13] covered for a man indeed ought not to
[42:15] cover his head for as much as he is the
[42:17] image and glory of God but the woman is
[42:19] the glory of the man for the man is not
[42:21] of the woman but the woman of the man
[42:23] neither was the man created for the
[42:25] woman but the woman for the man for this
[42:27] course or the woman to have power on her
[42:29] head because of the angels nevertheless
[42:31] neither is the man without the woman
[42:33] neither the woman without the man in the
[42:35] Lord for as a woman is of the man even
[42:38] so is the man also by the woman by all
[42:41] things of God judging yourselves is it
[42:44] comely that a woman pray unto God
[42:46] uncovered does not even nature itself
[42:48] teach you that if a man have long hair
[42:51] it is a shame unto him but if a woman
[42:54] have long hair it is a glory to her for
[42:56] her here
[42:57] has given her for a covering but if any
[43:00] man seem contentious we have no such
[43:01] custom neither the Churches of God it's
[43:04] got a mark chapter 15 and we're going to
[43:07] read verses 15 to 20
[43:25] and so pilot willing to contend the
[43:28] people content to the people release
[43:31] Barabbas with unto them and delivered
[43:33] Jesus whom he which when he had scourged
[43:36] him to be crucified and the soldiers led
[43:40] him away into the Hall called Pretoria
[43:42] and they called together the whole band
[43:45] and they clothed him with purple and
[43:47] planted a crown of thorns and put it
[43:49] about his head and began to salute him
[43:52] saying hail King of the Jews and they
[43:55] smote him on the head with a reed and
[43:56] had spit upon him and bowing their niece
[43:59] worshipped him and when they had mocked
[44:03] him and took off the robe from him and
[44:05] put his own clothes on him and led him
[44:08] out to crucify him let's pray
[44:12] gracious father Oh Lord as we read these
[44:17] words father Lord how people would come
[44:21] and worship you yet mocking and
[44:24] crucifying you father I just pray you
[44:27] just take these words and lord I pray
[44:29] you're sinking into every heart this
[44:31] morning father may we be attentive today
[44:34] as has already been prayed father may we
[44:38] receive what you would have seen today
[44:39] Lord all of us including myself
[44:41] especially Lord we ask that you would be
[44:45] worth the fry whole family also in
[44:47] Arizona Lord and brother Kristin sister
[44:49] Cherith as they fear well Lord their son
[44:52] and brother Lord at noon today father
[44:56] may you be there at the memorial service
[44:57] father be a witness I pray use them as a
[45:01] witness Lord those who don't know you
[45:02] Lord draw them yes father Lord and draw
[45:05] them in Lord don't just draw them but
[45:07] Lord bring them all the way into you
[45:08] father may you grant it for your glory
[45:10] bring healing to the family as well well
[45:13] pour in your oil and wine Lord pour in
[45:15] your love Lord comfort them Lord you're
[45:18] more than a scripture Lord they need
[45:19] more than a nice scripture saying you're
[45:21] a comforter I need you in reality we
[45:24] thank you Lord that you have been very
[45:25] merciful and a strength to them at this
[45:27] time but Lord especially at this moment
[45:29] Lord father may you grant it for your
[45:31] glory bring them safely home to us as
[45:33] well father when they travel and father
[45:36] bless our time in your presence Lord and
[45:39] Christ's name we humbly ask amen I mean
[45:42] God bless you all you may have your
[45:43] seats this morning now we read we read
[45:48] two very different kind of scriptures
[45:51] there but I want to continue on my
[45:54] thought about divide and conquer but
[45:56] especially influence now both these
[45:59] scriptures who read seem quite different
[46:00] but they show the influence that
[46:02] leadership has upon our lives
[46:04] and we took a family structure there and
[46:06] if we would we could read Apostle Paul
[46:08] you know in the book of Ephesians how he
[46:10] goes from the you know the the husband
[46:13] is the head and the wife is underneath
[46:15] in the children underneath it but that's
[46:17] the structure of the family and it is
[46:19] the influence of those in leadership or
[46:21] the headship of the family or the church
[46:23] or the group whatever it is that
[46:25] influence manifests and the people below
[46:28] them you take an army for example you
[46:31] know the will of the king or the general
[46:33] is manifested in the troops efforts to
[46:35] invade this place or to beseech this
[46:37] place or burn this place down you know
[46:39] they just give the order in the troops
[46:41] go and do it I mean so it's the
[46:44] influence of the of the of the command
[46:46] is a very powerful thing
[46:49] now we read here about a a band of
[46:53] soldiers where they had a band in the
[46:58] Bible hear from me this is from Smith's
[47:00] Bible Dictionary a band is referred to
[47:04] as a tenth part of a legion that was
[47:07] called a cohort which numbered between
[47:09] 400 to 600 men so when it says and they
[47:13] called the whole band together it wasn't
[47:16] just one or two soldiers like you see
[47:18] maybe in a picture Bible it was between
[47:20] 400 and 600 men and they were gathering
[47:23] in a hall at a place for the praetorium
[47:26] which is where the soldiers lived in and
[47:29] there was a courtyard or Hall in the
[47:31] middle of it and they were gathering to
[47:33] do one thing they were gathering to
[47:35] worship they were gathering to have
[47:37] church they were gathering to have a
[47:39] have a service that's what they were
[47:41] doing it sees that they they worshiped
[47:43] him they brought the word they brought
[47:46] the word of their myths they invited him
[47:48] he came amen they didn't force him to go
[47:52] to
[47:52] every there's no man take my life I lay
[47:54] it down he allowed it to happen and when
[47:58] everyone someone invites God to come he
[48:00] comes
[48:01] but it's our response to him when he's
[48:04] present that makes the world of
[48:07] difference
[48:08] hallelujah here was four hundred men and
[48:10] the Centurion or whoever's in charge
[48:12] said now we're gonna have a service
[48:15] today boys he comes the lamb I so move
[48:19] with us same thing could be sings here
[48:22] they had a chance here was the lamb that

[52:05] earthly journey and they took him they
[52:08] made a mockery and they crucified him
[52:11] and they despised him and he was the
[52:14] lamb it says we he was bruised for our
[52:17] iniquities
[52:18] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[52:20] him and by His stripes we were healed

[55:27] tried to wash my hands you cannot wash
[55:29] your hands you can know what my hands of
[55:31] the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:33] you could not what'd he say you be
[55:37] governor you take that you take the
[55:40] throne but they knew who he was they
[55:44] were not crucified they would know
[55:46] crucified the Prince of life did you say
[55:52] well they had to do that what do you
[55:56] want to fulfil what part of the word do
[55:58] you wonder fulfill their scoffers that
[56:01] said that would rise in the last day
[56:02] saying where is the sign of thy coming
[56:04] the world has continued as it has is his
[56:07] presence a man he came down on the Ohio
[56:09] River as John the Baptist hit to forerun
[56:12] the first coming of Christ your message
[56:14] will foreigners shaken coming
[56:15] amen and the God that moves among us I

[56:22] you I mean it's not just some random
[56:24] thing that you wondered into I mean the
[56:27] God has ordained this I think God has
[56:29] been brooding over the earth
[56:31] only here he was the end of his earthly
[56:33] journey they could have you know they
[56:37] could have got messy how different it
[56:39] was to the woman with the alabaster box
[56:41] I'd never do it was to the woman with
[56:43] the alabaster box she wasn't invited to
[56:45] the feast but something pulled her
[56:47] telling pulled her she knew hey Jesus
[56:50] Jesus had a bad name he was not well
[56:53] thought of when he began to say I am he
[56:56] when he begin to reveal himself saying I
[56:58] am the I am the word these words they've
[57:01] made be made flesh this scripture is
[57:04] fulfilled in your ears you would think
[57:06] you would think how crazy it is when a
[57:09] man would come and stand in the church
[57:11] and he would open the scroll to Isaiah
[57:13] and you'd say the Spritle Lord is upon
[57:15] me Lord has anointed me I mean to preach
[57:19] preach preach the acceptable year of the
[57:22] Lord - to your scene at liberty them
[57:24] that are bruised and heal the
[57:27] brokenhearted
[57:27] you know a sea is this day the
[57:30] Scriptures fulfill and if they weren't
[57:32] proud in their religion they could have
[57:34] sent back and said well what's happened
[57:37] in his meetings that's exactly what's
[57:40] happening why did they not gather around
[57:42] well then I say here's the one here's
[57:45] the one who considers free amid this
[57:48] animals this that's the sacrifice we do
[57:51] what good does it do they don't think if
[57:53] they didn't think about it if they were
[57:55] like Gideon arrow said if God is with us
[57:57] we're in the miracle where's the one who
[57:59] was with Joshua where's the Wonder was
[58:01] with Moses where's the one of Mount
[58:03] Carmel with Elijah where is he they
[58:06] didn't think that they said no we're
[58:07] just going to plow on because they are
[58:09] too proud oh we're Abraham's seed we
[58:13] have the Torah where the traditions and
[58:16] Jesus said woe unto you scribes and
[58:18] Pharisees hypocrites and he pronounces
[58:21] seven woes upon them of Matthew 23 you
[58:24] say well that's not nice God is love
[58:30] brother bear him and the Misses Shalom
[58:32] he speaks about the condole priest cuz
[58:36] you got to look at back and do it you
[58:37] say there's nice people out there
[58:39] yeah there's nice people everywhere but
[58:42] being a nice person doesn't give you a
[58:43] ticket to heaven
[58:44] I mean brother Brown would speak in
[58:46] Shalom you'd say says there's a young
[58:48] fellow around here by the name of Jesus
[58:50] of Nazareth speaking now in the in the
[58:53] juice juice they have nothing to do with
[58:56] them
[58:56] now this is insanity this is insanity
[59:00] right here here's the very God that the
[59:03] scripture said would come even his
[59:05] forerunner said I'm the voice of one
[59:07] crying in the wilderness to prepare the
[59:10] way thought he quoted the scripture from
[59:12] Isaiah saying this is me and if they
[59:15] really sat down and said well if this is
[59:17] him that he's going to introduce the
[59:19] very Messiah we're looking for I'm going
[59:21] to hang around here you listen to what
[59:24] he says I'm gonna follow the man he
[59:26] points out hallelujah that's what they
[59:28] should have done but because of their
[59:30] religious pride because of a because
[59:33] they were not willing to humble
[59:34] themselves to the scripture they
[59:36] crucified the very Prince of life he
[59:41] says now who's first what does our Bible
[59:44] teach us God is love who was the first
[59:48] when you're born you're kind old priest
[59:51] that's right who come to you when you as
[59:54] a need didn't have no money loaned you
[59:56] some money
[59:56] you're kind old priest exactly who put
[1:00:00] his hand on your shoulder and mothers
[1:00:02] shoulder when you was about to separate
[1:00:05] and prayed you back to God your kind of
[1:00:06] priest who was it that who was it took
[1:00:10] sides with you when you and your
[1:00:12] neighbor wasn't wasn't fussing and
[1:00:14] brought you back together in fellowship
[1:00:16] your kind o priest that's right who is
[1:00:19] it who as the as gonna say the last
[1:00:22] words going to say over you at the day
[1:00:24] out yonder who is it they let you lay
[1:00:27] there and rock but your kind old priest
[1:00:29] comes and blesses you and since the Word
[1:00:31] of God along with you your kind or
[1:00:33] priest what about this guy called Jesus
[1:00:35] of Nazareth you see what school that he
[1:00:38] come from
[1:00:38] your kind old priest had to sacrifice
[1:00:41] all of his life his grandfather was a
[1:00:43] priest his great great great great great
[1:00:45] grandfather was a priest priest he put
[1:00:47] his whole time in the organization he
[1:00:50] has trained to the word he knows what
[1:00:52] he's talking about but you see now we're
[1:00:56] talking about the fruit of the Spirit
[1:00:57] kind Lovejoy
[1:00:59] peace understand long-suffering patience
[1:01:00] he fruit of the Spirit what about this
[1:01:02] Jesus where did he come from we dem got
[1:01:05] a word than he ever came ever came out
[1:01:07] of any school all he does have tried
[1:01:09] tear up the schools that were built not
[1:01:12] much fruit of the Spirit is there he
[1:01:15] sees and humanly you'd say you're right
[1:01:17] he's trying to break out traditions he's
[1:01:20] trying to do away with the daily
[1:01:21] sacrifice he's trying to break up our
[1:01:23] you know break up the synagogues and
[1:01:26] break up all these things but our kind
[1:01:27] I'll preached these kinds old priest
[1:01:31] today kind o priests in every
[1:01:33] denomination but which one would you
[1:01:37] rather take a man who's got an education
[1:01:39] who can speak multiple languages we're
[1:01:42] fine ropes or do you or what have you
[1:01:44] have taken John the Baptist a man who
[1:01:47] stomped down to the wilderness clothes
[1:01:49] and camel skin eating locusts and wild
[1:01:51] honey probably never took a bath in his
[1:01:53] life that we know of and he began to
[1:01:55] preach new generation if I I'm in the
[1:01:58] axes late to the root of the tree every
[1:02:01] tree that doesn't bring forth fruit is
[1:02:02] hewn down and cast into the fire make
[1:02:04] way for the coming of the Lord now which
[1:02:07] one would you take oh let's go look at
[1:02:11] what these guys say about this one on
[1:02:12] Facebook this renegade John the Baptist
[1:02:15] who is this guy he tears down our
[1:02:18] religion he always preaches against us
[1:02:20] he preached against you know Herod and
[1:02:23] Herodias and all these different ones
[1:02:25] he's always breaking up trying to break
[1:02:26] up all these things but we're about love
[1:02:28] and acceptance and community amen edit
[1:02:32] but this guy's a renegade which one was
[1:02:35] the word makes me because that
[1:02:38] ultimately you go look back you got to
[1:02:39] go beyond human psychology and human
[1:02:42] emotion and you say which one is the
[1:02:45] Word made flesh which one would you take
[1:02:48] sides with because the sake ones who
[1:02:52] were the kind old priests they crucified
[1:02:54] the very Bryn's of life
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:03:01] Pilate had twice the opportunity to be
[1:03:05] in the presence of the Lord
[1:03:06] he should have beg for mercy
[1:03:09] but he sold them to the dogs to try and
[1:03:12] keepers his standing in the community
[1:03:14] because he is worried well if I don't if
[1:03:16] I don't do anything with them then
[1:03:18] there'll be an uprising and then I'll
[1:03:20] get in trouble with the Emperor
[1:03:21] so because of social standing and
[1:03:23] worrying about what other people thought
[1:03:25] of him he tried to wash the blood of
[1:03:27] Jesus Christ off his hands he can't do
[1:03:30] it friends you know don't what is your
[1:03:33] what is your ultimate oh we're we're
[1:03:37] Christians we believe the Bible but what
[1:03:39] is influencing you the most because what
[1:03:42] influences either most is your absolute
[1:03:44] it actually is your God it is I mean
[1:03:49] what what you what you walk before look
[1:03:54] at your life just just look at yourself
[1:03:55] for a minute
[1:03:56] what is my what am I my how I conduct
[1:03:59] myself how I treat my spouse what I wear
[1:04:02] where I go the things I say the things I
[1:04:05] watch what are they you say but people
[1:04:10] will think I'm mad too
[1:04:12] I I'll just jump into this I'm not
[1:04:17] worried about these nuts but I had a
[1:04:19] dream a few months ago I was in a place
[1:04:22] I was in like Papua New Guinea which I'm
[1:04:24] going to in a couple of weeks and I was
[1:04:26] talking to a native man there and he was
[1:04:29] just here so he's a Christian of some
[1:04:30] sort near saying I just don't believe
[1:04:32] this serpent seed and water baptism and
[1:04:35] you know all these different things and
[1:04:36] I said I see if you only knew if you
[1:04:41] only knew the reality the reality behind
[1:04:44] it it's not doctrine it's more if you
[1:04:47] could only have the reality if you knew
[1:04:50] the reality behind and this word he
[1:04:53] begin to cry then I came back to this
[1:04:56] place came back to New Zealand and I saw
[1:04:59] three brothers walking around in shorts
[1:05:01] oh I mean to be believers I woke up so
[1:05:03] grieved o worker breathed I thought if
[1:05:07] they only why do people not get the
[1:05:09] reality it's not rules and regulations
[1:05:12] and a conformity there are spiritual
[1:05:16] principles behind these things when we
[1:05:18] have baptized the name of Lord Jesus
[1:05:19] Christ we are telling this world
[1:05:22] the unseen world I'm buried with him I'm
[1:05:25] uniting myself with him you are telling
[1:05:28] the unseen world this is my I've taken
[1:05:30] aside I mean and people everywhere I
[1:05:34] reflecting one of two sides it doesn't
[1:05:37] matter if they're prostitute on the
[1:05:38] street cover their and make up and
[1:05:40] ungodly clothes or their religious
[1:05:42] person crucified in the word I met
[1:05:45] someone with a lust spurt being in
[1:05:47] church China trying to be a Christian
[1:05:49] you're identifying yourself you're
[1:05:53] telling the unseen world this is my side
[1:05:59] it's true whose side are you on today
[1:06:05] whose side remember just because you
[1:06:07] come to this place doesn't mean you're
[1:06:09] going in a rapture that has nothing to
[1:06:12] do with it it is a personal walk between
[1:06:14] you and God
[1:06:15] the scripture says forsake not the
[1:06:17] assembling of yourselves together so
[1:06:19] much as you see that they approach and
[1:06:21] it could be right now it could be
[1:06:22] tomorrow
[1:06:23] I mean really you're my precious wife I
[1:06:26] said sister's call up you who don't live
[1:06:28] here and they just watch the streaming
[1:06:30] and they're crying
[1:06:31] but finally we could be in their
[1:06:33] presence and they as our need a hook and
[1:06:37] they don't know what to do and we take
[1:06:41] it for granted
[1:06:43] my goodness we do we are spoiled how god
[1:06:47] spoils us you have any idea how good he
[1:06:50] is I mean a pour himself out I mean he
[1:06:53] keep us humble and yield it oh my
[1:06:56] goodness they take this for granted do
[1:07:01] they did not take his presence for
[1:07:03] granted oh just go next week it may not
[1:07:06] happen next week and then he may never
[1:07:09] blow through this place again the wind
[1:07:11] blasts worthlessness you cannot tell
[1:07:13] where it comes from and where it goes
[1:07:14] save it is when the spirit of low blows
[1:07:16] through the place Jesus said the wind
[1:07:19] does not always blow amen that's
[1:07:23] according to the scripture we should not
[1:07:26] take we should not take it for granted
[1:07:28] what he does for us we should never just
[1:07:31] make it common I'm in the atmosphere and
[1:07:34] I know he's present today
[1:07:36] and use it last week I mean the
[1:07:38] atmosphere we have in our homes
[1:07:40] hallelujah the evidence that you carry
[1:07:42] wherever you go do not take it for
[1:07:44] granted do not just say well this is
[1:07:46] just me and I'm just stumbling along I
[1:07:48] mean when he is present hallelujah
[1:07:51] do not take it for granted Oh Muffy
[1:07:54] people will give their lives to be in a
[1:07:57] place like this they would be in their
[1:07:59] life it says a name or say to live and
[1:08:01] let's read a scripture I think we take
[1:08:05] it for granted I honestly do I don't
[1:08:07] think we cherish what he does for us we
[1:08:10] are so privileged and this is all over
[1:08:12] the world I'm not saying we're special
[1:08:14] or unique amen as long as we're people

[1:08:18] expression you think you're the only
[1:08:19] people on the beach well as long as I'm
[1:08:21] on the beach I'm happy
[1:08:22] hallelujah hurry but people Amos Aidan
[1:08:27] 11 we take this for granted friends it's
[1:08:34] a prophecy and a mosh a more Satan 11 it
[1:08:38] says behold the days come saith the Lord
[1:08:41] that I'll send a famine in the land not
[1:08:44] a famine of bread nor thirst for water
[1:08:47] but hearing the words of the Lord it
[1:08:51] says I'll send this famine and they
[1:08:53] shall wander from sea to sea and from
[1:08:55] North even to the east and shall run to
[1:08:58] and fro seeking the word of the Lord and
[1:09:00] shall not find it and that they shall
[1:09:04] the fear virgins and young men faith
[1:09:07] faint for thirst those are the ones that
[1:09:09] have this physical strength it says it's
[1:09:12] coming a famine we are living in this
[1:09:15] day this scripture is being looked down
[1:09:18] upon the earth people go on YouTube and
[1:09:20] I search church the church the church
[1:09:22] the church and I go to remind a
[1:09:23] bookstore they're trying to find and
[1:09:24] they're trying to find things they have
[1:09:26] a hunger and they try to find it and
[1:09:27] they can't find it they cannot find it
[1:09:30] it doesn't say a famine for Bibles or a
[1:09:32] famine for religion or a famine for
[1:09:34] churches but hearing the word of the law
[1:09:37] hallelujah it says they shall not find
[1:09:39] it and it value value
[1:09:43] you should we should be there are
[1:09:44] thankful people at all the way we
[1:09:49] should be so thankful and this time of
[1:09:51] famine he brought you in do not take it
[1:09:55] for granted do not take it for granted
[1:09:57] for a second
[1:09:59] brother Bram said if the bride really
[1:10:00] understood what he is that for her she'd
[1:10:03] be on her knees crying every day they
[1:10:12] take this place for granted do not take
[1:10:15] this message for grimy I mean you people
[1:10:17] would travel thousands of miles just to
[1:10:21] hear one service they would travel you
[1:10:24] go see he talks about people traveling
[1:10:25] from Georgia up to Indiana that's a long
[1:10:28] way in a car and they had worst cars and
[1:10:32] worse roads than we do and they would
[1:10:34] travel and they would sacrifice I mean
[1:10:37] the DAO family would follow him all
[1:10:39] around all around the country United
[1:10:41] States to hear and preach and they
[1:10:43] didn't fully grasp what he was saying
[1:10:45] but they knew the angel of God was there
[1:10:47] I'm in a newsie Messenger was there Oh
[1:10:50] God and we have it we have it available
[1:10:54] we have it available they take it for
[1:10:59] granted people and they would sit and
[1:11:03] far more uncomfortable conditions than
[1:11:04] this and they would sacrifice and their
[1:11:08] whole lives where I'm going to follow
[1:11:09] this I don't know where it will lead me
[1:11:11] but I know it'll lead me into heaven one
[1:11:12] day I'm gonna follow this worry and they
[1:11:15] sacrificed and gave of themselves what
[1:11:18] about you we are without excuse we are
[1:11:22] without excuse I mean it's in our
[1:11:24] languages I mean it's an over about six
[1:11:27] year old language of the earth I'm in
[1:11:29] its incurring and it's an English and
[1:11:31] Afrikaans and Spanish it's in every
[1:11:34] language we need and it's available and
[1:11:37] it's free there are times when people
[1:11:41] would get big reel-to-reel tapes and
[1:11:44] they would they would order one and so
[1:11:48] they have one in their house I'd listen
[1:11:50] to it that order for another one and
[1:11:52] then it had to basically exchange them
[1:11:53] all the time and wait for the next one
[1:11:55] to come
[1:11:56] and a loose tail mail and and the tapes
[1:12:00] are unfiltered - very hot you know some
[1:12:01] of the my handles do it was like that
[1:12:03] pretty much all of them and that's it
[1:12:05] there and they'd listen and not absorb
[1:12:08] it with that's great sacrifice then we
[1:12:12] have it here you say well there's a lot
[1:12:17] of other books that are good I'll tell
[1:12:19] you this these two anointings in this
[1:12:21] age it's two anointings you take Jesus's
[1:12:25] first coming
[1:12:26] there was Antichrist and there was him
[1:12:28] the Antichrist was religious it said
[1:12:32] good things it's the kind old priest
[1:12:34] yeah he said some good things some
[1:12:36] encouraging things but when it boiled
[1:12:39] down and it revealed what was in him he
[1:12:42] seat away with this man I'll not have
[1:12:44] this word roll over me I'll not have
[1:12:46] this word I will not have him crucified
[1:12:49] what season he hasn't done anything
[1:12:50] wrong
[1:12:51] crucify him I find no fault in this man
[1:12:54] crucify him
[1:12:56] who will you give us Barabbas or Jesus
[1:12:58] who should I release just my customer we
[1:13:01] want Barabbas we want a murderer
[1:13:03] later bracer murderer will welcome a
[1:13:05] murderer in trial Mets will have the
[1:13:07] prince of life yeah amen and that's
[1:13:10] exactly what people do today they say we
[1:13:12] will not fully surrender to this man and
[1:13:15] they say and they explain it away they
[1:13:17] explain Jesus ministry away that's right
[1:13:19] I mean Josephus year the other
[1:13:21] historians they see that Mary was
[1:13:23] impregnated by some soldier all these
[1:13:26] doc back names that we put over Jesus in
[1:13:28] and the disciples stole his body and
[1:13:30] they ate it and all these different
[1:13:31] things it's in history away with such a
[1:13:35] fellow
[1:13:35] thanks played them away that looks
[1:13:38] playing this away - brother I'm said if
[1:13:40] you're looking for saying to criticize
[1:13:41] the devil will give you plenty to
[1:13:43] criticize and there was the message
[1:13:45] remember the Jesus has hid in the common
[1:13:47] people heard him gladly he didn't speak
[1:13:49] in great big high Hebrew words he spoke
[1:13:52] like the common people and he comes a
[1:13:54] messenger of this day good evening
[1:13:57] friends and fetch and tote and carry and
[1:13:59] straw tick and sassafras experience and
[1:14:01] you know all these things you say who
[1:14:03] taught this guide of written and
[1:14:05] speak but it was God let's go through a
[1:14:08] man I mean and God makes himself so
[1:14:11] humble he makes himself so little
[1:14:14] because he's really what I see with your
[1:14:17] pride it better be dead cuz you're gonna
[1:14:20] become more humble than that you're
[1:14:23] gonna you got to humble yourself under
[1:14:24] him under the word amen we got it and so
[1:14:35] we're living in this time of famine and
[1:14:38] yet we have a band all feast do we do we
[1:14:43] really appreciate what we have what do
[1:14:46] you take it for granted now as I said
[1:14:53] about if we could really understand when
[1:14:58] we do anything we are signifying to the
[1:15:00] unseen world whose side you're on
[1:15:02] and brother BAM he was shot when he was
[1:15:05] 14 and he fell down to the regions of
[1:15:07] the lost and he saw those woman with the
[1:15:10] painted up eyes the cat cat eye makeup
[1:15:12] and groaning when he was 14 and then
[1:15:16] it's years later he's sitting there on
[1:15:18] the street escalator coming out of JC
[1:15:21] Penney store and he and he thinks he's
[1:15:23] back there again because it's now what
[1:15:25] he saw there as being manifested here
[1:15:28] upon the earth now you say that's pretty
[1:15:31] far-fetched that's just his idea I'll
[1:15:33] say what's his vision that was his
[1:15:36] vision that fascism and communism would
[1:15:39] rise Nazism you know all of us even made
[1:15:42] divisions that they all come to pass did
[1:15:45] Mussolini rise to power
[1:15:46] did he Theo P or whatever was fullest if
[1:15:48] we came to a shameful end and he's
[1:15:50] hanging up there in Italy by his feet
[1:15:53] him and his mistress and his people are
[1:15:55] spitting at him and mocking him he came
[1:15:56] to a shamefully I mean that Adolf Hitler
[1:15:59] rise in power amen in and in but then
[1:16:02] even he came to a mysterious in I don't
[1:16:04] know what happened to him
[1:16:05] you know some say that he'd killed
[1:16:06] himself in the bunker and the Russians
[1:16:08] burned his body or whatever more you
[1:16:10] know has has technology advanced do we
[1:16:13] have driverless cars I mean do we have
[1:16:16] the Catholic Church isn't power in
[1:16:17] America
[1:16:18] it is the supreme judge that the supreme
[1:16:22] court they're they don't they don't get
[1:16:25] reelected they're there for life
[1:16:26] that's Jews and Catholics there's no
[1:16:29] Protestant judges anymore I mean both
[1:16:31] both vice-president nominations in this
[1:16:33] last lecture were Catholic the whole
[1:16:36] place is riddled with it did he say it
[1:16:38] would come and it's here that he said
[1:16:42] he'll be great moral decay and we live
[1:16:44] in it did he say America would be smoke
[1:16:47] bombs and craters and it will be and it
[1:16:51] will be if those things are true those
[1:16:53] visions were true the vision he had of
[1:16:55] being an JC Penney store or the outside
[1:16:57] of it and being back in the region of
[1:16:59] the last that was true amen when he had
[1:17:02] the vision of the preview of the bride
[1:17:04] Oh onward Christian soldiers and he saw
[1:17:09] the first age go up then he saw every
[1:17:12] every nation come up then he saw this
[1:17:14] modern modern America or modern modern
[1:17:18] Christianity come up dancing to a
[1:17:21] leading buyer which to the beat of rock
[1:17:24] and roll basically naked and they go to
[1:17:27] a place and they go down and he stands
[1:17:30] he's saying is this Lourdes is full of
[1:17:33] gifts because you're worthy
[1:17:36] then he heard of the Christian soldier
[1:17:39] match against to the Bride of Christ and
[1:17:43] full array walking matching to the beat
[1:17:47] of the world but the end of the last the
[1:17:50] last few of them are going to get their
[1:17:52] eyes off without going and now looking
[1:17:54] at the worldly church and even getting
[1:17:57] to screen they're getting out of line
[1:17:58] hey screech stay alive get back at line
[1:18:01] cuz he saw me that ways was going and he
[1:18:05] came to himself I believe that vision is
[1:18:07] true I believe that as I say the Lord I
[1:18:09] believe God was showing us the vision
[1:18:12] and sight and it was the ones that thing
[1:18:14] in which you were getting off they were
[1:18:16] looking at the wrong thing stay alive
[1:18:19] who cares about what the world is doing
[1:18:21] in their religion and they sir you know
[1:18:23] the songs they sing producers the people
[1:18:27] that are in their congregation and I'm
[1:18:29] not condemning them but by your fruits
[1:18:31] you shall know them
[1:18:32] said judge righteous judgment she you
[1:18:34] should Melda discern between right and
[1:18:36] wrong daughters that yours it not
[1:18:38] because there's no great devil hides in
[1:18:40] great but there's no great it's not
[1:18:42] part-time Christian part-time serving
[1:18:45] the devil it's either full time and full
[1:18:47] time you got to look at what what is
[1:18:52] being produced well it's just a bunch of
[1:18:56] lust spurts their people expose their
[1:18:58] flesh men and women and it's a big
[1:19:01] performance and people are caught up in
[1:19:03] an atmosphere course is an atmosphere do
[1:19:06] you think there's not an atmosphere in
[1:19:07] devil worship
[1:19:08] well that's strong no we know if we went
[1:19:10] to a real voodoo priest a real genuine
[1:19:14] one and we sat in the service there
[1:19:16] would be an atmosphere there would be a
[1:19:18] real atmosphere it's not a put off there
[1:19:21] anointed by devils and they do their
[1:19:23] voodoo enchantments so you go to a place
[1:19:26] big massive what why does it have to be
[1:19:29] in black well has have to be black and
[1:19:32] smoke and light so you know at different
[1:19:35] things going on why does it have to be
[1:19:36] like that the gospel glows with the
[1:19:40] glory and purity of God
[1:19:42] Hollywood glitters we can't compete with
[1:19:45] them we don't want to go on their
[1:19:46] grounds why what are we wanting to
[1:19:49] produce do you want to produce a people
[1:19:52] that stay in line and go up you want to
[1:19:54] go up do you want to go down make your
[1:19:56] choice because you're like there's no

[1:23:39] at the end of his life his friends had
[1:23:42] forsaken him he had no earthly friend he
[1:23:46] had no earthly backing and he didn't
[1:23:49] understand why are you doing this to me
[1:23:51] I just want to fix let's go back to the
[1:23:54] original and they burned him as a
[1:23:57] heretic he had no earthly friends and he
[1:24:01] was living in the dark ages hundred
[1:24:03] years after the Reformation started here
[1:24:06] he was what about you what about you and

[1:26:26] oh you'll you'll cool down after a while
[1:26:29] and I think that may be your testimony
[1:26:32] but I don't want what you have
[1:26:33] I don't want what you have I want to be
[1:26:36] and I believe it's been ten years ten
[1:26:39] years ago I met them and I think I'm
[1:26:46] more what they would say crazy and
[1:26:47] fanatical now I was back then hallelujah
[1:26:51] and I pray God burn on and online

[1:27:49] hallelujah

[1:27:58] pride
[1:27:58] it's your glory I'm gonna read so I can
[1:28:04] find it see it's a spiritual thing I can
[1:28:09] find this this is this is my darling
[1:28:13] wife's testimony the first part of it it
[1:28:18] was early in 2007 when I became very
[1:28:21] tempted to cut my hair although I knew
[1:28:22] it was wrong this is her words and
[1:28:25] theirs on our website if you want to go
[1:28:27] read it and I've been taught that log
[1:28:28] here and the Bible means uncut here
[1:28:30] which it does that would long me select
[1:28:32] wrote at that time in my life I was
[1:28:34] struggling with a few worldly things in
[1:28:36] several sisters I knew had begun to trim
[1:28:38] they're here and I heard every excuse as
[1:28:41] why it was okay so eventually I decided
[1:28:45] I trim I hear but when I went to do it I
[1:28:47] felt so convicted that I decided I'd
[1:28:50] first asked God to clearly show me if I
[1:28:53] shouldn't cut it at all and if he didn't
[1:28:55] answer me I would cut my hair the
[1:28:56] following week this is God's tremendous
[1:28:59] grace I think it was two days later I
[1:29:01] had a dream where a man was chasing me
[1:29:03] with a knife and had me cornered and
[1:29:05] tried to stab me but I was unable to
[1:29:07] touch me
[1:29:08] with it though even though he's stabbing
[1:29:10] wildly towards me then a voice said to
[1:29:12] me he can't touch you because of my own
[1:29:14] cut here the next night I had another
[1:29:16] dream now this is the significance I had
[1:29:18] another dream I saw myself holding
[1:29:20] scissors about to cut my hair and all
[1:29:23] around angels were crying and pleading
[1:29:26] for me not to cut it saying they only
[1:29:29] have authority to protect me
[1:29:31] if my hair is uncut and suddenly
[1:29:35] realized though I can't write it in
[1:29:36] words what it would mean in the unseen
[1:29:39] spiritual world if I cut my hair and I
[1:29:42] started screaming my self don't cut it
[1:29:45] please don't cut it needless to say I
[1:29:46] didn't cut it
[1:29:47] so the unseen world we have our see
[1:29:51] before this angels around the angel of
[1:29:54] the Lord which is God himself and kemp's
[1:29:57] about those who fear him and delivers
[1:29:59] them amen
[1:30:01] so the believe of that is fully
[1:30:03] separated to him hello I trust I trust
[1:30:06] you could say that is me
[1:30:07] I've sold out everything I've strained
[1:30:10] and I know I've surrendered and I want
[1:30:12] it all my hardest hello
[1:30:15] if you're fully surrendered to him he's
[1:30:18] like now you have now you go bodyguards
[1:30:21] now you've got protection we just see we
[1:30:25] just see on the street the influence of
[1:30:27] the demonic power and they put it out
[1:30:30] especially beautiful woman and it's lust
[1:30:33] it's not real beauty and if we could see
[1:30:36] if we could see the spirit that is
[1:30:39] actually anointing that person we would
[1:30:42] run a million miles I think it was I may
[1:30:45] get the brothers there or there's some
[1:30:46] brothers in Australia and they went out
[1:30:48] to a restaurant and the waitress comes
[1:30:52] up and well so I started eating and a
[1:30:55] waitress comes up and then this brother
[1:30:57] looked up and he actually saw the lust
[1:30:59] diamond on this on this waitress and he
[1:31:02] instantly threw up in his food and they
[1:31:04] just left if we could actually see and
[1:31:08] because they say oh that's beauty no
[1:31:09] it's not beauty it's lust and the world
[1:31:13] has exchanged lustful love amen and when
[1:31:17] people say well the spark is gone it's
[1:31:19] actually maybe the lust is gone and you
[1:31:22] actually need to say well let's go back
[1:31:23] to when we really loved each other for
[1:31:25] who we are amen
[1:31:28] you got to go back to that place you can
[1:31:30] go back to that place it's if we really
[1:31:34] understood and then so now so in the
[1:31:37] unseen world angels are sent to protect
[1:31:39] those who are separated to God
[1:31:41] hallelujah so we are we have we have the
[1:31:44] best secure
[1:31:45] in the world amen we are looked after in
[1:31:49] a tremendous way and then and then the
[1:31:52] rest of the story as we know is he's
[1:31:54] after about three or four weeks after
[1:31:55] this it was strangely quiet at work and
[1:31:58] I work on my family business to the
[1:32:00] knife shop selling knives about 4:00
[1:32:01] p.m. there wasn't a person in sight when
[1:32:03] a drunk crazed man staggered in swearing
[1:32:05] and shouting and that he was going to
[1:32:07] stab me and kill me he was very worked
[1:32:09] up and angry and use extreme foul
[1:32:10] language I looked at him and suddenly
[1:32:12] realized that this was the same man who
[1:32:15] had unsuccessfully tried to stab me in
[1:32:17] my dream
[1:32:17] glory to God I mean and I felt such a
[1:32:20] peace and just looked straight at him
[1:32:22] knowing he could do absolutely nothing
[1:32:23] to hurt me he suddenly went all nervous
[1:32:25] and ran out and a few seconds later he
[1:32:27] walked back and said sorry about that
[1:32:29] lady then left now if you've been to
[1:32:31] that shop there was no way she could
[1:32:33] have run there's no way she could have
[1:32:36] run the counter and there's the back
[1:32:37] wall and the only way to get around the
[1:32:39] counter is over there and they're only
[1:32:40] doors as where he was standing there's
[1:32:43] nowhere to hide there's nowhere to hide
[1:32:46] but God was showing that to say I'll
[1:32:48] look after you if you're separated to me
[1:32:50] yeah Amen hallelujah so and then there
[1:32:57] was the time just before we got married
[1:32:58] all we got engaged she's walking through
[1:33:00] the park and there's an ambush said it
[1:33:03] sickly for her there's a man with a dog
[1:33:05] she walks up to them anew and then two
[1:33:07] or three other men jump out the bushes
[1:33:08] and they think now we've got her then
[1:33:12] she felt that same power come down that
[1:33:15] they'd surrounded it which is the dog
[1:33:16] out of the way and keeps walking on and
[1:33:18] they do nothing what is there because in
[1:33:22] the unseen world identified with you
[1:33:25] Lord Jesus or Lord Jesus I'm identified
[1:33:28] with you remember he's our husband he's
[1:33:30] our protector
[1:33:31] he's our provider I mean he's our shield
[1:33:35] he's our fortress I mean he's our
[1:33:37] strength he's our captain Harley he's
[1:33:40] our protector
[1:33:41] he's a jealous God I mean he will he
[1:33:43] hate the devil tries to get a hold of
[1:33:46] one of his children he will fight the
[1:33:48] battle
[1:33:49] hallelujah all because of protection
[1:33:53] because she was walking down there hello
[1:33:58] fire was there hallelujah
[1:34:01] my friends those what would they have
[1:34:03] done well she played she might have been
[1:34:05] killed in the knife shop and if she
[1:34:07] survived that within she maybe could
[1:34:09] have been brutally raped in the park but
[1:34:13] she had protection but yet the world
[1:34:16] would say that's crazy for letting your
[1:34:17] head like this well I'll tell you what
[1:34:21] if you are here and then there was that
[1:34:24] lady member head that worshipped oh my
[1:34:25] poor brother endings there was that lady
[1:34:27] there and anyway when I'm at work I get
[1:34:32] this text or this phone call Christine
[1:34:34] says that lady at the worship pump she
[1:34:37] came over to the house and so she came
[1:34:39] to English she just started attacking
[1:34:41] and are you just a bunch of bramma night
[1:34:44] brand of mites and there's nothing real
[1:34:47] there's just all rules and stuff and
[1:34:48] then and starts wearing it all these
[1:34:50] things Christine just starts to testify
[1:34:52] about these things God comes down the
[1:34:55] woman runs out of the house and and Tara
[1:34:57] leaving even her handbag there amen
[1:35:01] oh that's just for her do not let that
[1:35:03] unbelievable get him to here well that's
[1:35:06] just her and her walk that is just
[1:35:08] unbelief because it's for everyone who
[1:35:11] serve a will they become richer
[1:35:13] whosoever will never just say well
[1:35:15] that's that person that's just the devil
[1:35:17] actually saying I don't want you to have
[1:35:18] it because because if he knows if you
[1:35:21] actually if you could only see the
[1:35:23] reality of this living word amen if we
[1:35:26] just grasp the reality of it you would
[1:35:29] say Lord Rock of Ages cleft for me
[1:35:31] myself have a shelf in me if we could
[1:35:35] really see the power behind it amen and
[1:35:38] one of the Chiefs hallelujah hey you say
[1:35:44] well there's nothing I can do this wrong
[1:35:48] it's all the perfect will of God
[1:35:51] don't lean too much or man
[1:35:54] in first Chronicles David decides to
[1:35:57] bring the ark into the city and here's a
[1:36:00] man who's anointed remember I just maybe
[1:36:04] you know
[1:36:05] don't walk just just plowing on ahead
[1:36:09] Paul says that least I become he says he
[1:36:12] says I want to walk in such a way not
[1:36:15] not with uncertainty I mean I want a
[1:36:20] therefore so Rand Paul says not as
[1:36:23] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[1:36:25] beateth the air but I keep my body and
[1:36:27] bring it into subjection least there by
[1:36:30] any means when i have preached to others
[1:36:31] i myself should be a castaway he knew
[1:36:35] that that could possibly happen to him
[1:36:37] so he walked in such a way he says I
[1:36:40] don't want that to happen I so run
[1:36:42] remember we are not presuming there's
[1:36:46] nothing there is nothing in this when it
[1:36:49] comes to what God likes and what God
[1:36:52] doesn't like and our relationship with
[1:36:54] him there's nothing that we're guessing
[1:36:55] it there is nothing he is laid out
[1:36:59] everything how the family should be how
[1:37:01] the husband should treat their wives
[1:37:03] wives husbands how would you treat the
[1:37:04] children and forgive me I'm not getting
[1:37:06] gonna get into that today maybe next
[1:37:07] time you know all those things and all
[1:37:10] those things are in the message and the
[1:37:13] earlier messages he talks about
[1:37:14] influence and and and dealing with
[1:37:17] children and how you treat your wife and
[1:37:19] the atmosphere you have in your home and
[1:37:21] all those things all the family I need I
[1:37:24] need you know people go get marriage
[1:37:26] counseling books those things may be
[1:37:28] okay but it's all in the work it's all
[1:37:29] in the message you just got to dig you
[1:37:33] just got to dig it and look we have such
[1:37:35] programs people never used to have such
[1:37:37] programs they would they would listen
[1:37:39] and most of the books are not even
[1:37:41] printed anyway they would listen that
[1:37:43] write things down and that in that and
[1:37:46] they'd form like quote books about
[1:37:47] certain things so don't have to fool
[1:37:48] them they just have a search program
[1:37:51] what do you want to find out about
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:59] you should look into these things this
[1:38:02] is not a Catholic this is not you know
[1:38:05] we can't just rely on ministry to dig
[1:38:09] into things and look into things for us
[1:38:10] this is not a Catholic institution where
[1:38:13] the priest will tell me I'll let the
[1:38:16] priest find out for me
[1:38:17] no you dig into it yourself you dig dig
[1:38:21] this this up yes there is untapped
[1:38:24] resources in the Word of God I'm tapped
[1:38:26] what does that mean no one has ever dug
[1:38:28] into it no one has ever looked into it
[1:38:30] no one has ever refined it I mean no one
[1:38:34] has it so we got to dig in and look
[1:38:36] ourselves you say well I only have 24
[1:38:39] hours in the day what eternal value a
[1:38:43] lot of things we do have no eternal
[1:38:44] value a lot of things a vain things yeah
[1:38:48] a lot of things we do you know oh but I
[1:38:52] I just need some me time
[1:38:53] why don't you make it God time brother
[1:38:56] mcgi he always went hunting nothing
[1:38:58] wrong with hunting but he went they'd
[1:39:00] have communion with God yes that was his
[1:39:03] main that was his main objective of
[1:39:05] going hunting and fishing is to spend
[1:39:06] time with God
[1:39:09] there's your hobby and what you do does
[1:39:11] it bring you closer to God what is it
[1:39:14] what does it produce can you do it can
[1:39:17] you take Jesus to the places you go
[1:39:20] there's some places he says I don't want
[1:39:22] to go there oh but I'm going there well
[1:39:25] maybe you shouldn't go there consider
[1:39:29] think on your ways children and Sir
[1:39:32] David and first Chronicles now he wants
[1:39:35] to bring the arkin and he consulted the
[1:39:37] captains of thousands of hundreds and
[1:39:39] every leader and then all the people
[1:39:41] said yep let's do it let's get the arkad
[1:39:43] in but some people think I can do
[1:39:45] nothing wrong and then so they have a
[1:39:47] great they they you know so they put the
[1:39:49] ark on a new cart and they begin to
[1:39:52] bring it into the city and they shout
[1:39:54] and they sing and they dance with all
[1:39:56] their might and they're excited about
[1:39:58] what they're doing but it's not that
[1:40:00] David was presuming that's how you bring
[1:40:02] the ark into the city he was presuming
[1:40:05] Oh God God will overlook my mistakes
[1:40:08] God does not overlook our mistakes God
[1:40:12] is not a doting grandfather
[1:40:13] it just is off I don't see you doing
[1:40:15] that yes you love me I know he sees
[1:40:18] everything we do we can't just take for
[1:40:21] granted oh nothing you know it's it's
[1:40:24] God's grace and mercy it is God's grace
[1:40:26] and mercy but God's grace and mercy is
[1:40:28] not him putting blinkers on and ignoring
[1:40:31] what you're doing the same god of the
[1:40:35] Old Testament you know we're seeing
[1:40:37] there's no God like Jehovah
[1:40:38] well Jehovah became Jesus so the same
[1:40:42] God in the Old Testament it's the same
[1:40:43] God in the New Testament what he hated
[1:40:45] in the Old Testament he hates in the New
[1:40:48] Testament and people will go on about
[1:40:50] gay marriage and how it's you know all
[1:40:52] those things it's an abomination in the
[1:40:53] Old Testament and God doesn't change and
[1:40:56] you God see it's an abomination for a
[1:40:58] woman to wear a man's garment and if
[1:41:00] it's abomination to him there it's the
[1:41:01] same here whether he liked it or not
[1:41:04] well that's that's that's old-fashioned
[1:41:07] thinking I say it's eternal thinking and
[1:41:09] I'd rather have eternal thinking let
[1:41:12] this mind that was in Christ be in you
[1:41:15] so they begin to play they begin to
[1:41:18] shout they begin to dance it was a big
[1:41:21] time and they were excited and they were
[1:41:24] sincere but the ark was coming the wrong
[1:41:28] way the ark was he presumed this is how
[1:41:31] we should do it why did he do it that
[1:41:34] way because it came out of the
[1:41:36] Philistine land on an ark I mean on a
[1:41:38] cat what they do they put it on a cart
[1:41:41] put on gave their offerings of gold and
[1:41:44] things and they sent it on its way and
[1:41:46] the oxen just walked into Israel to a
[1:41:48] certain place I thought this is how
[1:41:50] we'll do it but it wasn't according to
[1:41:52] the scripture he was just presuming even
[1:41:55] his sincerity he was wrong he was trying
[1:41:59] to do God a service without it being his
[1:42:01] will and you know there is a story is
[1:42:05] the man who tries to stand in the Yaak
[1:42:07] because he doesn't want it any harm I'm
[1:42:09] gonna protect this word I'm gonna keep
[1:42:11] it work and he died it's a David's
[1:42:14] actions cause one good man to die even
[1:42:17] in his sincerity we should just plow on
[1:42:21] friends don't just presume
[1:42:25] there's a question mark don't do it it
[1:42:29] may be right but you've got to have you
[1:42:31] got a search and say God is this right
[1:42:33] so don't do it if there's a question
[1:42:36] mark
[1:42:37] you say well that means I won't be able
[1:42:40] to do anything in life no God will lead
[1:42:41] you God will take he'll guide you don't
[1:42:45] just presume I'm under the blood
[1:42:47] everything's fine
[1:42:48] David was anointed king and he was king
[1:42:51] at that time he was adopted
[1:42:53] he was adopted into the body right and
[1:42:57] of course there's one man to die and
[1:43:00] here we are today don't presume anything
[1:43:06] if you haven't listened to the sermon
[1:43:08] trying to God a service vows will you go
[1:43:11] listen to it and you got to put it on on
[1:43:13] your lap yeah cuz it's no good saying
[1:43:16] yeah they're wrong what about here who
[1:43:21] cares about them we're not under their
[1:43:23] covenant and there'll be some of them
[1:43:25] that go to that that go to the Great
[1:43:27] Tribulation and give their lives to
[1:43:29] Jesus and they get no salvation of the
[1:43:32] white throne judgment but that's not
[1:43:33] what we call - this word is not calling
[1:43:36] people to go into a tribulation this
[1:43:38] message was sent to take a people up
[1:43:40] into a rapture to do a means of don't
[1:43:46] worry don't worry about them if they
[1:43:48] turn it down you say God bless you go on
[1:43:51] don't deed Christianize them you know
[1:43:54] sure some of them they'll take the mark
[1:43:56] of the beast they'll hold on to your
[1:43:57] religion like think that it is first
[1:43:59] coming and whatever more but what is it
[1:44:02] to thee i thinkin about myself this is
[1:44:05] my life this is my eternal destination I
[1:44:09] don't want to just take this casual and
[1:44:12] I want to just know it's just this just
[1:44:13] walk on Oh everything oh she'll be right

[1:44:19] presume anything Amy do not presume
[1:44:21] anything wish the PISA sister come you
[1:44:28] don't presume anything that's why we
[1:44:31] take it back today
[1:44:33] what are you doing with this Jesus
[1:44:36] called Christ what are you doing with
[1:44:38] this revealed word if you listened to
[1:44:41] the indictment sermon brother fights he
[1:44:45] actually proves that they have crucified
[1:44:47] the word again today to their
[1:44:49] congregations and that's the same as the
[1:44:52] soldiers they crucified and they say
[1:44:55] today by holding on to their creeds and
[1:44:57] dogmas and the traditions well I was
[1:44:59] taught this way this is how it's always
[1:45:01] been
[1:45:02] listen who says it's right that's why
[1:45:05] it's so much easier for someone who has
[1:45:08] no religion whatsoever to come in and
[1:45:10] just embrace the truth because there's
[1:45:11] not all this religious falsehood that
[1:45:13] they're going to be purged of oh but
[1:45:16] those people are good people in that
[1:45:18] church yeah they might be good people
[1:45:19] I'm not condemning them but what are you
[1:45:22] called to do what are you called to be
[1:45:25] amen don't let your life become a
[1:45:27] mockery of him whatever you do when you
[1:45:34] see those soldiers I pray your life is
[1:45:36] not producing that same kind of how King
[1:45:39] of the Jews they beat him and they spit
[1:45:41] on them and they mock them put a crown
[1:45:43] of thorns on his head don't join that
[1:45:46] number well how do I do that no that's
[1:45:51] not true I'm not gonna do that I don't
[1:45:54] accept that let's say you killed the
[1:45:57] effect of the word and parents do it -
[1:46:01] children children do and assess what the
[1:46:04] parents do in moderation
[1:46:05] Amen brother BAM told yo it says about
[1:46:09] Elisha he's there and and 42 children
[1:46:12] come out of the village and they say go
[1:46:14] up bald head go up all did they make fun
[1:46:16] of him because Elisha had been raptured
[1:46:19] before this and and anger came upon the
[1:46:23] Prophet and two she bears came out of
[1:46:25] the woods and killed the children now
[1:46:28] you say well that's a gift use Rob sure
[1:46:30] it is but what influence caused the
[1:46:33] children to go say that it was the
[1:46:35] parents talking about the Prophet and
[1:46:37] their harm and the influence came upon
[1:46:39] the children and the children died oh

[1:46:43] what are you talking about it hurt
[1:46:46] what-what-what-what influence you
