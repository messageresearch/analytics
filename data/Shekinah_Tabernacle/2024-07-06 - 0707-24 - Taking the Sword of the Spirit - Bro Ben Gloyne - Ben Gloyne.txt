we can blame sin for the cold I think Before the Flood The Temper the climate was slightly different I think there was a nice firmament and it was like a glass house you know like like a glass house is always a nice temperature there wasn't rain and there wasn't this this cold wind it was a nice uh environment for the human body to dwell in you know then after that all sort of change then we get all these funny Seasons where it's like hot and then it's cold and then it's windy and it's this and that and then we our frail human bodies get thrown around but I'm glad that there's a place where it's not going to be like that we're going to have a nice Eden again where the conditions for the human body are going to be nice but while we're here we press on whether it's cold or whether it's hot whether it's sunny whether it's blind a gale we press on because that's what a Believer does and that's what that's what we you know that's the that's the the journey that we have to walk here but

of what brother um Jimmy was preaching on and um we're just going to pick up from here and and for a context we're going to go to uh Judges 3 and 31 so Ephesians 6 uh 10 to uh 18 there's as we know there's a few of us who are unwell amen so I remember them in prayer amen if you're streaming God bless you amen um trust you feel a part of the service amen wherever you are amen let's go to Ephesians 6:10 it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand in the evil day and now this is the evil day and having done all done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye are able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen amen you don't need to turn to it just just one one verse in Judges 3 and 31 and after him was shamgar the son of anth which sow the Philistines 600 men with an oout and he also delivered Israel amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen let's commit Our Lives to the Lord let's pray gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful we can truly say you do Miracles so great you're the miracle work God you're the Jehovah of Miracles my God and we want to thank you that you are the same yesterday today and forever and father as we have read your great Eternal Word Lord as always we say Lord you come take over now dear God father we surrender all of our beings all that we are Lord Jesus our soul spirit and body into your hands father may you be glorified Lord Jesus in all of our Lives those who are streaming as well father you see the prayer requests have come through Lord Jesus of people who are unwell and sick and body father they can't make it that they want to be here Lord I pray you'd be their abundant portion today Father may you be so present with them Father wherever they are now dear God no matter how they're feeling and body Lord may just Quicken their souls and pour your inspiration into their lives dear God and Father may he touch their bodies and make them well for your glory and we just want to commit Our Lives into

The Lord Jesus Christ Grant it father heav your way Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh the uh this morning so I want to I want to talk about picking up the sword of the spirit today amen and and it's very and really where this ties in is is is attitudes we're going to make a segue through halfway through the service about attitude but this is where we're going to go but you see now as as um as the Apostle Paul would say is to be able to stand in the evil day now this is verse uh 13 the prophet tells us this is the evil day this is the day when no one can pretend to be a Christian anymore am mean you can you're either filled with the Holy Ghost or you're not and you need to get filled amen but no one can just float along and no see see the enemy is so great in this day and he's manifesting himself so much in this day but we know he is just a copy and a counterfeit because God is pouring out a spirit more and more but I just want to emphasize you cannot just be part of the group and overcome you must know him and the 's Resurrection every every brother even says one one place says God hasten the day that everyone will be who they are on their heart I say God hasten that day that if you're a Believer be a believer if you're not a Believer become a Believer if you're make believer become a real believer amen but what you really are you know just just don't don't pretend be a genuine Christian and I believe we are genuine Christians but but don't just you know but you see we're standing in this evil day now we we must take the sword of the spirit amen amen we must fight in this battle we got to realize that we're in a battle amen we're not in a picnic you say I didn't I didn't sign up for a fight well you signed up for a fight amen whether you like it or not every human being is in a battle amen whether they realize there's a devil and they realize there's a God or they don't they're still in a battle amen people label all kind uh label the enemy in his works all kind of different things but we got to recognize he's more than a thought amen he he's a being he wants to take you out amen but we're anointed to take him out Amen to to destroy our enemy now well we've got to realize that our weapon is the most powerful weapon that this sword of the spirit does not break it does not get blunt amen but as powerful as ever been now even the weakest of Christians has the right to wield this weapon that's it brother BR would say that see see Jesus when he was standing there in his great Temptation in the wilderness he would he defeated Satan with Satan's great attacks on him he defeated with it is written proving that even the weakest of Christians can stand and they can quote that word in faith and they can defeat this the devil any place any time see no matter who he is what form he comes and where he's at it will defeat Satan am mean so if it comes in the form of depression it'll defeat that if it comes in the form of self-importance it'll defeat that it'll come in the form of lust it'll defeat that it'll come in a form of insecurity it'll defeat that amen feeling that you don't belong it'll defeat that it'll defeat every form he comes in the word of God will defeat him amen and it's been proven Through the Ages and it's been proven in this day amen that the word of God see we cannot be like those Buffalo standing watching one of our own be eaten me we cannot be disabled and let the enemy think well we can't do anything about it and we cannot let fear rule Our Lives sinking that if we stand on the battlefield he's going to take us out no let's just let's just kill that thing right now let's just kill that thing right now okay amen now we've got to realize that God did not make you and I just to see if he could make you and I he made us for a purpose therefore there is a purpose for all of us being here who's the all that includes all of us right there's a purpose for us being here we're not just to be here to be another human being you're here because God made you for some purpose you're not here just to eat the food that God grow you're not here just to live in the house that man made or wear the clothing that someone fashioned you're here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are or how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose now is everyone on board this morning we're here for a purpose you're not here to fill in time you're not just another bunch of jeans walking around your DNA walking around in the human body no you're here for a purpose right and we're here to fulfill God's purpose right not just your own purpose or anything else's purpose God's purpose now just as my finger is here for a purpose my on my fingers for a purpose my eye and every part of our bodies to serve a purpose it was not just here to not just put here to just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was here put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and if we are put here for a purpose then there is nothing everyone say nothing nothing can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled I mean so nothing can destroy you till God's purpose is fulfilled in your life nothing Nutter zip nothing zil nothing can take you out until God's purpose is fulfilled so if that be the case why are we afraid to take the sword of the word and chop the enemy's head off see people get worried they think well if I step forward onto the battlefield then I'm going to see a lot of trouble sure you might see a lot of trouble but nothing can take you amen until God's purpose is fulfilled in your life Lord amen and we just got to think about it how great it is to go from this world to the next World you say well has anyone had that kind of experience as I said a few weeks ago Christine had a death near death experience in Switzerland am in where she had an anaphylactic reaction from traod she's dying she actually left her body in the hospital she watched her auntie weeping over her body she's being lifted up into the most glorious place and she wanted all she wanted to do was tell her auntie how marvelous it was I mean to the place she was going amen it was the opposite to the rich man in Lazarus the rich man wanted someone to go back and testify how terrible this place was but Christin want to tell everyone how great it is to go up into Glory right so I've already had someone who's had an experience sitting in our midst how great it is to die but her purpose wasn't finished I mean she's still here upon the Earth for a specific reason and nothing can take you out till God's purpose is fulfilled so if she can have a testimony saying it's actually a glorious thing why should we be afraid oh the devil could kill me well that means my purpose is done God's done with me he's just taking me home he's just I'm just graduating up into Glory Hallelujah so why should we be afraid of the enemy trying to see we're going to realize he can't touch a ha on our head until he's first asked our heavenly father permission to do so am mean before he could touch job he had to ask his father permission and God said go for it amen I've Got Confidence in job am mean because God CU job had confidence in the shed blood amen so nothing could happen to job without the devil first getting permission and the devil could only do what he is permitted to do amen amen so if that be the case friends why should we be worried why should we be afraid see to do nothing is to be defeated to do nothing is to be defeated but to stand and say God said so it's right I Take God at his word I'm not putting up with the Enemy anymore that's Victory amen amen but you see we need courage to stand on the battlefield amen we are not weaklings we're not cowards amen the devil may try and make you think you're a coward you're not a coward you're a rugged Christian filled with the Holy Ghost more than a conqueror amen you can stand shoulder to- shoulder with the Apostle Paul where he says I'm more than a conqueror through Christ you said amen Apostle Paul I know what that's like amen cuz I've overcome in my age just like you overcame in your age amen don't doubt these things friends we are not we will not be taken out amen until God has ordained its time Hallelujah nothing can harm us until that purpose that God has put us here for has been made manifest praise the Lord no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches or Sorrows we go through all of these for reasons there's a reason for it hallelujah hallelujah I think we can Rejoice this morning amen nothing can take us until our purpose is fulfilled amen the Bride of Jesus see see God the devil cannot he can't get anything over God right so why would we be afraid to take the word take God at his word and kill that enemy that's so wrestling against us why why would we sit still and be know there's a time to speak this is a time to speak this is a time to take remember that sword that landed in the prophet's hand in Sabino Canyon where is that sword now it was preached where is it it's a new but it's got to come out and speak against the enemy amen so see friends we have been placed in a place amen Christ has made us join his with himself right amen so so we are as powerful as he is amen we're as sinless as he is because he became sin for us who knew no sin that we'd be made the very righteousness of God God in Christ right I mean because we're joint ear with him where he is in power and position we are in power and position this is how powerful our weapon is amen cuz we joint ears with him he did not seat us on a lower seat than himself no we're on equal terms with him cuz he elevated us to that position I trust that's not too strong just chew it for a bit and swallow it'll be fine amen but don't be you because because the devil wants us to think we're just another bunch of human beings you're not because of God Grace you're not I mean because of God's mercy you're not amen right without it we are the same as everyone else but God has done a work in our lives now God wants to use that work and shake the devil's Kingdom amen wants to take the devil's head off he wants to give you Victory now we are seated brother Bram Cesar in God of this evil age now just as your natural life and traits is handed down from natural breeding of your of your father so is the spirit of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world and when the entire world word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we're seated with him with power and authority over every devil now let's just go back people stumble at that God made me pay for my sins in him there he paid for my sins amen right it's just like just say Chris you know just say I work I get a paycheck she spends it right by product by product but you see so what I earn she spends okay me earning it because we're one is the same as her earning it because we're one amen right that's it more of the brothers should have said amen there some do but you see because we're one what I do she gets and what she does I get cuz we're one right and because Christ and his bride are one remember we're one before the foundation of the world right we came into a body at time with spiritual Amnesia he had to redeem us back to himself bring us back to that Oneness again that we had before the found remember the devil can't change in time what God has ordained in eternity amen so if you were with him with the Lord before the foundation of the world he wrote your name on his Lamb's Book before the foundation of the world the devil can't there's not enough rubbing compound no twink nothing that can erase your name off that Lamb's Book of Life the devil can invent amen so that's why you know it says he made me pay you know people stumble at those things but you got to realize no we're one amen and I don't read that statement say look how great I am I said know look how great he is and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given am me see but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you're seated there you'll use it for you're ordained to do what you do amen so if you're seated there you will take the sword of the spirit and you will kill every devil that comes against you am mean because you're seated in a power of position and authority over him you got to realize he must obey your voice the devil must obey the believer's voice amen he has to move he's got to mind the voice of God in you amen amen if that's okay I think that's right see see you will use it for your ordained to do what you do you say well am I seated there am I not just take the sword of the spirit take God at his word and you'll see where you're seated amen amen are we all together this morning I feel happy I hope you're happy with me amen see the Lord just like when when you're after Deborah and barck the son of um uh abini or however you say in that day this is after they won the great victory over the enemy they say praise the the Lord for avenging of Israel when the people willingly offered themselves amen so when the people willingly offered themselves that's when the enemy was that's when the Lord Avenged Israel that's when that's when the Lord fought for Israel and won a great Victory when the people were willing to step into the battle amen are you willing to step into the battle are you youo we're not here just to dig trenches we don't live in a world or one kind of mentality dig a trench fortified bunkers sandbags machine guns artillery and suicide charges no we're not made to do that kind of thing we're here to have total Victory amen where it's a moving Warfare where where where the kingdom of God is gr growing in our lives the word is becoming more real in our lives amen we're not here to have a stagnant kind of a life we're not a stagnant pool hallu no we're a Fountain of Living Water amen that flows overflowing amen but you see it's when the people are willing to willingly offer themselves to go beyond just the status quo there was a man called Arnold Von winkl of Switzerland I love the story I just love it Hallelujah I thought he is willingly that said there's a painting of it but you know they were fighting the ostran the austrians had come and invaded Switzerland they're just a bunch of farmers they didn't have many weapons those they're outnumbered but Arnold Von winad said today I'll give my life for Switzerland and he said and and then all of his men said what are you going to do he said just just follow me and he screamed out Make Way for Liberty the The Story Goes and he grabbed those big Pikes those big Spears and thrust them into his own bosom made a made a gap in the um Austrian formation the Swiss PED in there and and they won a great Victory and Switzerland was free cuz someone willingly offered themselves now this is just a natural Warfare it's an incredible thing what about now a supernatural Warfare you got to realize the Lord conquered because he offered himself that our lord Jesus did not did not know just you know no he gladly went to Calvary cuz he said Lord not my will but thy will be done so what he was ordained to do what the scripture prophesied he would do he gladly did he surrendered to it and we got to realize we're here to fulfill the scripture too I mean we're here that the Lord would fully prove the power of the blood in our lives amen so they won a great victory that day it's when the people willingly offer themselves amen and it must be the same thing today see great victories come because of great sacrifice but do you want the victory amen amenl as as brother man says and God talked to Moses oh look at here there's a promise out yonder we're going to get to um Shamar by the way we're going to get to him there's a promise made out yonder of Divine Healing there's a promise of the baptism of the holy spirit before you ever get to the baptism of the Holy Spirit you may have to cut through the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian the Christian Science and everything else all those spirits that hold you back you have to cut through it you got to take the word of God above your culture above your religion above your ideas above your nationality above all those things you've got above your family Spirit your family lineage you to take the word of God and cut through that yeah amen amen praise God I'm strong to find where I am no yes but if you're ready to go get it it's it's out there for you God promised it and sent it to you amen look I'll give it to you the land's over there but before you get there you've got to fight that's what the matter with people today they're afraid to stand and fight what we need is I must fight if I should rign increase my courage Lord must I be carried to heaven on uh home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease when others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas no I must fight if I must rain that's right and where so wishy washy boneless helpless spineless as worms I think of old buddy Robertson he got down to the cornfield he said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back to earth you'll find you're going to find a pile of bones laying here you start fighting when you really mean it right it's not just lip service it's not just nice to day when your heart says yes Lord I must have this amen but we must must we be carried to home to heaven on a flowery bed of East we're not going to have that flowery bed of East that flower bed of East when others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody sea no we'll be able to stand there with the rest of the ages admire what they did but not shring back and say Lord how did you let me get through like this no it will be his Supreme Grace in our lives will be the reason we're on the other side and it's his Supreme Grace in our lives that will give us every Victory but we've got to surrender to that Grace and say Lord you want to give it to me I want to receive it amen hallelujah now this word as it says take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God now that word take means to receive it you've got to receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit now that word of God there uh where we get the word it's from from the word Rema which is something that's been uttered by a living voice a thing that's spoken I like it scoffield puts it as the inspiration of God so he says take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the inspiration of God I mean when we when we receive the word and the inspiration that's given in when it becomes a quickened living reality amen that changes everything that's what really cuts through the enemy you see we started with Shamar Shamar was afraid to fight yeah brother Bram dramatizes it we know the story very well but let's put ourselves in those shoes once again where Shamar Harvest time after harvest time the enemy the Philistines would come in and take his crop so he would just get through the winter time he would just get through you know the different seasons where he didn't have much food and his family was getting smaller and smaller thinner and thinner you know their clothes were getting more ragged so you know and a part of them would have been well at least we're still alive but they were being defeated by the enemy now remember Shamar shanga was a circumcised Israelite living in his Promised Land he wasn't a gentile he was even if he was a gentile yeah but but he had a God made a covenant with him right and to me that's the biggest thing God has made a Covenant with you and I amen just like you know the rainbow I was driving home the other day and I saw a rainbow I was thinking about it how you know it says in Genesis God said when I see the rainbow in the sky I will remember my Covenant right that I won't flood the Earth again many times we think of it as when we see the rainbow we remember God's covenant no when we see the rainbow we should remember God remembers his Covenant amen it's a very different thing God is putting a symbol in the sky say saying I remember my promise amen and God remembers all of his promises amen he doesn't leave one on the side one doesn't collect dust one doesn't become old and stagnant one there's not one in the two hard basket God remembers his Covenant with his people am mean and we're a covenant people this morning God made a covenant with you am mean sure you made a covenant with them Lord I'll serve you I'll give you my life Here I Am Lord but he made the Covenant with you long before you ever said your side of the deal and he knew you could not keep it remember this this Covenant we have with our God is an unconditional Covenant am me as brother R would tell in the Old Testament there would always be a you know agreement between two people that would have a sacrifice between them because they would say if we cannot keep our side of the bargain may we be like the sacrifice and God knew we couldn't keep it that's why he died on Calvary amen he knew we couldn't keep it he knew the Frailty and failure of a human being so he said well I will become the sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah amen so we're a covenant people you see shamgar was a covenant believer in the Lord he is a message believer of the of the hour in those days but he was standing there defeated afraid he had the sword of the spirit but he had to pick it up he had to receive it he had to take it amen he had to start using it amen but he would no doubt reason well at least we're still alive at least we're still a family together I say the enemy he was like one of those Buffalo watching the Lions chew up one of them he was like one of to those people you see but there came something what struck him the inspiration of the word am mean came inspired him when he heard that certain season where you know the Harvest was in everything was done and then he heard those same boots marching down the road the Philistines am mean 600 of them it's amazing how how how the enemy knew more about shamgar than Shamar knew about himself the enemy knew the potential of Shamar why else would he send 600 soldiers against one farmer two or even one would have done it but the enemy saw the potential in Shamar he says boys we're got to go a lot of us he doesn't know who he is what a fool but there come a season Hallelujah there always comes a season hallelujah amen you may be downtrod you may be beaten you may be oppressed but there comes a season amen when the inspiration of the word strikes you CU you got to realize this whole armor of God Amen it will come into manifestation there's not one of us will leave unarmed there's not one of us will leave defeated no we're going to go out packing the victory Hallelujah so there so those so those boots amen coming down the road that he heard that struck him yeah hallelujah it's amazing the enemy does something that causes inspiration to hit God's children amen it's like the you know Samson was bound and he heard the shouts of the Philistines and the anointing of God came on and broke the bands and he killed them all Hallelujah why he took the he took the sword of the spirit amen amen so Shamari heard the boot stomping down the road he saw the state of his family and he realized I'm not going to be one of these silent Buffalo I'm going to use these horns God's given me I'm going to I'm going to kill everyone amen why he received the inspiration of the word he knew in his head one will chase a thousand but when it was inspired to him see he just took what he had amen and killed every single one of them and he wasn't satisfied till they were all dead hallelujah hallelujah why because he picked up the inspiration of the word amen the spiration was given it was the inspiration he received it and and it manifested that inspiration in his life amen you look at you look at Mo Moses amen he didn't have the sword of the spirit when he killed one Egyptian he didn't have the sword of the spirit but at the burning bush God said I'm going to armor you Moses I mean you tried with your armor of intellectual understanding and your upbringing and where you're from and all these things sure you're the promised son but you're not dressed right see you're not dressed right amen so he received the full armor of God at the burning bush because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the full armor of God that's right you don't receive the Holy Ghost then get the full armor no they're one and the same our armor on the inside Hallelujah so so he received the full armor of God and he had the staff in his hand it was just a dead staff but when it was inspired see I mean when it became the inspiration of God throw it down became a serpent did everything with that stuff brought all the plagues everything why cuz it was the sword of the spirit in his handu amen and what do God placed in our hand the name name of Jesus Christ has been placed as a rod of Deliverance in your hand am me to bring Deliverance to bring Salvation to bring joy to bring the Holy Ghost to bring Revival I mean to bring the defeat of the every enemy amen it's been placed in your hand not just the prophet's hand it's been placed in your hand amen God wants the same inspiration that brought the word to come into your life and to manifest the word amen so he went down to Egypt says let my people go and he cut through the threatenings he cut through the trouble he cut through fear in his great palace bunch of nonsense bunch of dead bunch of royalty didn't mean nothing to God Amen and he said I'm not leaving one hoof behind so he cut through compromise he cut through agreements he cut through all this nonsense he no we're all going am mean because the word of God has to be fulfilled I mean because God promised our forbear Abraham we're going to go out with a great substance Hallelujah so he kept cutting until it was done and he walked out exactly as the prophecy was promised it was fulfilled hallah why because he had he had the sword of the spirit I mean Micah would be invited to a meeting there was two kings Ahab and Jehoshaphat were the Kings and you know they were they had uh Ahab had 400 Israelite prophets and they were inspired you know you know jeh Jehoshaphat said you know let's inquire of the Lord you know if we should go retake ramoth Gilead and so you know Ahab says yeah I got I got 400 trained preachers they're real good prophets and they got up and they just started preaching they they had a real great what they thought was a revival time we're going to get the land they got so enthus there was an anointing Came Upon them and the leader of the organization made two horns and said by these you'll push the syrians out of the country and then so now but you see they didn't have the sword of the spirit yeah they had an intellectual understanding they had an emotion they had a nice idea and even scripturally ramoth gillad did belong to Israel but you see now prophecy there was a prophecy had to be fulfilled of RA of Ahab dying in battle and then so je Jehoshaphat heard the preaching saw the music saw the church service he says this is all fine but do you have one more imagine the look on ahab's face thought what are you one more this is 400 man what more do you need but do you have one more and Ahab says yeah I got one but I I hate him he always speaking evil against me this man's got the sword of the spirit I don't like him too well and Jehoshaphat said uh just go get him so now here comes here comes the ministerial delegation to Mah says listen Mah you've been out of Fellowship a long time you want to come back I'll tell you what's been happening in the meeting you've be watching the live stream we've been having a big time if you want to be accepted cuz we like you m you're a real good guy you're just straight down the road and we appreciate that we need the dogmatic type around here but you've got to say what we say now you can't say that to someone who's got the sword of the spirit you cannot say that to someone who's got the inspiration of the word you can not say compromise just to be part of the group no he took that s the spirit and he cut through he cut through peer pressure he cut through intimidation he cut through the you're not welcome here anymore he cut through all those things because why he knew the Prophecies of Elijah and he realized the Prophecies of Elijah are going to happen in this season they will be fulfilled and that was the sword of the spirit amen he received the inspiration of those prophecies so he said well I'll only say what God puts in my mouth that's it so he went prayed took it before the Lord and he used the inspiration of the word struck him he picked up that sword cuz he saw the Prophecies of Elijah and said no what they say is not matching this see he used it to cut through the nearly right and found it was completely wrong can we do that today can we cut through popular opinion hallelujah what everyone else is doing and and he came before Ahab he said I said go on up the Lord's with you he must said it real sarcastically cuz Ahab said to to Jehoshaphat don't you see he was prophesies against me and Maki said I see Israel scattered like sheep without a Shepherd then Ahab said if take him and feed him the water of a bread of sorrow and give him the water of Sorrow put him in the inner prison Mah said if you ever return God didn't speak to me but he had the sword of the spirit see and that sword of the spirit caused him to match his inspiration with with the word he cut through he cut through there's you know brother B says that we are the Mah of this day yeah you know that the Elijah was gone when Micaiah was preaching amen there's all kind of things going on in the church but Mah stood because he stood with the prophecy of Elijah amen I trust we can stand with the prophecy of Elijah in this day amen hallu amen we got to realize that the end time message meets end time conditions amen every time there's an end time the end time message meets the conditions it me it in Noah's day did it not there was an end time for Israel being in in Egypt the message of Moses brought them out did it meet the conditions amen amen what what about in this end time of end times see we cannot think that our our weapon is just equivalent to the Devil's weapon seeing greatest battle ever fought see his attack watch listen close disclosing his attack is what disbelieve God's word that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle battle was ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God and what is Satan's weapon against you does to try and get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you let's listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is uh get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you our weapon is far stronger amen amen our weapon's far stronger it's like there's a saying don't take a don't take a knife to a gunfight or people who take a knife to a gunfight they're going to get wiped out we've got more than a you know this weapon we have is even far dis um disqual or whatever the word is between a gun and a knife our weapons greater than the atomic weapons of all the world Amen our weapon is far greater than anything that's been devised by human humankind or anything that's that hell is devised amen amen you see this see if it gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough trying to find my slides they're gone he say listen if he can get you to believe your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you oh brother Neville I hope we never believe that and I put that in yellow although that's such a powerful thing because if you believe your weapon is not strong enough you're believing something but it's wrong so he says I hope we never believe that brother Neville I hope we always believe that God's word is more than able it cuts to The Killing Place amen it'll cut through anything doesn't matter the unbelief the trouble the fog that's in front of you it'll cut right through that thing amen the inspiration he's put us for a purpose now I'll just try to find where we are now see the people that know their God can we can we go down what's happened here go down to Daniel 11:32 sorry um T I think I might need to use you here here we go is it working now okay but the people see and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall corrupt shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that know their God shall be strong and do exploits amen so if you know you're God you're strong that's why he say let the weak say I'm strong amen and they shall do exploits what exploits standing out to the battlefield anyone can hide in a trench anyone can camp behind a tree and just wait it out but the hero really goes out to the front amen see if you receive the inspiration of the word amen you realize the victory is already won but you've got to step and possess that Victory amen like Caleb and Joshua those ones they didn't just sit on the other side of the Jordan say well God clear the place out you've given it to us clear it out no they went and possessed they had to go fight every battle but they had the Revelation the whole Land is Our hallelujah amen and when the enemy came in they didn't quit they just attacked they charged see our armor does not have any armor on the back we have a breastplate which covers the front The Shield is for the front amen the helmet right but there's nothing on the back why cuz we're not here to retreat we're here to stand we're here to March forward we're here to charge amen that if you're in a battle say Lord give me the inspiration of your word for this battle Inspire to me Lord what you would have me do in this battle amen you see you see David David had the inspiration of the word he had the sword of the spirit that when he fought Goliath he says he says God's given me a bear and a lion you're an uncircumcised Philistine I have a covenant with God see he just asks a question he doesn't even when he's talking to Israel he doesn't talk about how big Goliath is he says this guy has no Covenant with God why are you worried about this guy who has no Covenant with God our God made heavens and earth Our God spoke to Abraham Our God spoke to Moses Our God spoke to Joshua our God is still God he speaks to Samuel he still anoints I've received it amen I've had the experience I have a covenant with God why are you putting up with this guy he has no promise with God he's got nothing he's just got his own human ability what a failure that turned out to be am mean because a small little Ruddy boy was just a shepherd with a sling amen had the sword of the spirit and cut through that thing and rallied all of Israel they won a great Victory amen and then every time David went to battle he didn't just say well I'll do the same thing again that was I think the last time he used a sling he picked up a sword that's it and then one time he just went and attacked the Philistines other time he was waiting by the mulbury bushes praying asking God what should we do he says when you hear the sound of a going rise up and slay your enemy amen so what he had the sword of the spirit that he could he could step into the battle at the right time Hallelujah does that mean he put up with the devil when he was there no he saw his enemy we can't just go like this we don't have ostrich Faith oh he'll go away he won't go away oh he'll just move on he'll get bored no he won't get bored God needs you to stand up amen and take the word for yourself the Lord and slay the enemy amen you say well my god is so big and mighty but you see he needs human beings to work through God works through men yes God works through his body when I say men I mean men and woman okay God works through people and he needs people who are willing to give themselves on the day of battle see that's what makes Satan mad that's what shakes them when the Church of Jesus Christ only knew who they were brother I'm now you say I know there's nothing impossible with God he said there's nothing impossible to you cu the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe amen right so it's and that's what makes the devil mad when you realize there is nothing impossible with me cuz I'm a Believer God can do whatever he wants through me amen God can live however he wants whatever he wants to do when he wants to do it he can do it through me amen amen you see amen that changes the subject doesn't it you say well there's nothing impossible to God he said there's nothing impossible with you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it amen you see we have a full word today amen God has fully unveiled himself in this day like he did when he came here the first time in a body of Flesh right he took a redeemed son he took a sinner saved by grace brother Braham manifested himself through it to prove the power of the Cross right and remember the angel of the Lord told him if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer and brother brah was was the one who said not even cancer because it was the big enemy of the day still is a big enemy but now to me that same commission is still on you and I we're going to realize oh we need the prophet to come back he will come back but our body will be changed to meet with him to meet the Lord in the air he ain't coming back to preach he ain't coming back to fulfill the word of God no the Bride of Jesus Christ is upon the Earth to fulfill God's Plan of Redemption amen so God needs people to work through now to me now that changes or I'll come to it soon that should change our attitude because it's really the attitude that dictates if you pick up the sword of the spirit or not that's want I just quit no we're here is it no he see those prophets had such things till they it was hard thing to do they didn't want to go out and be scorned at they wanted to have fellowship and go in with the rest of them go along with the Brethren but you see I believe I forget what prophet it was actually Jeremiah said I don't know this in other words but my whole heart will catch fire God has spoken I must deliver it whether they liked it whether they crucified whether they stoned him whatever they did God has spoken his heart and he must say it not to be different but to be obedient obedience is better than sacrifice hearkening to the fat of Ramsey it was in his heart he must do it it was his life he couldn't hold it there was something a pulsation that pushed him what was that that's the inspiration of the word amen uh they couldn't bless or curse it God had so much complete control of them till he was their voice their action Hallelujah he says give me a church that so completely Anointed with God till their every action and moves thus sayith the Lord walk in that shik of Glory I'll show you a messiah anointed one of God standing upon the Earth that's a powerful statement I mean some a people that so completely Anointed with God so it's not them living anymore it's God living am amen their every action and move is thus sayith the Lord what does that mean it's the word of God manifested and me they walk in that Shak kind of Glory I'll show you a messiah upon the Earth amen it's not Pie in the Sky friends this is what people should see when they come in Among Us they should see Messiah upon the Earth Christ and his people I mean more than just another group they should see God and his people once again I mean they should see an anointed one upon the Earth as a body Hallelujah but you see now someone like shamar's attitude had to change his attitude beforehand would have been app me woes me when will God do something about it right now attitudes create an atmosphere and environment amen and it's all about our attitude as determines what we'll get from the Lord or not see a Roman put a rag around his eyes hit him on the head with a stick said prophesier tell us who hit you prophesy now prophesier God don't clown for nobody he never opened his mouth no he never said a word he didn't feel any virtue but a woman that approached him right and touched His Garment she got virtue she got her desire this other guy was condemned he went to hell for it no doubt what's the difference it's your attitude amen what kind of an environment you create around you by your belief or unbelief see Shamar had a had a had an environment around him that was bad and it wasn't the fact that the enemy was taking his grain and and and and they were hungry and all those things it wasn't that that was creating his environment it was his attitude because there he was a circumcised son of Abraham living in the promise Promised Land but his attitude was wrong see his attitude towards the word was wrong I mean it's sure he maybe said yes I believe Jehovah God was there with Moses but where is he today see that's the wrong attitude his attitude should have been he's the same yesterday today and forever he's Jehovah of Miracles today don't let sickness build a complex in your life amen lingering problems can build complexes don't let them build complexes in your life let God live amen doesn't matter how long it may T God will come on the scene amen Abraham waited 25 years his attitude had to be adjusted Sarah's attitude had to be adjusted how was it adjusted by a vis itation of God himself changed their attitudes amen that when Paul would write Sarah's obituary and The Heroes of Faith of Hebrews 11 it says Sarah judged him faithful who had promised why her attitude was changed I judge him faithful Abraham I judge our God Faithful he's no longer just your God he's my God he's our God I judge him faithful I tell you that would have changed the environment in the home am mean where before that would have been fussing and fighting and trouble and strife and maybe a separation maybe Abraham didn't testify as much as he would to Sarah yeah because of the the lingering of the promise seemed just just seemed to linger on seemed to be many years and nothing was happening and the frustration that that can build and the complexes that can build but her attitude was changed by a visitation of Elohim hallelujah amen and so it change to the environment that that that that they had now was one of belief carnality fasting and fighting Strife insecurity troubles that's not an environment of faith if you feel insecure you need to get your attitude changed right if you feel I don't fit and where I am in the family and my upbringing was like this and poor me Let Your Attitude Change I mean because it's not our upbringing that defines us it may mold us a certain way but God knows how to break that mold bust it open and start building us the right way I mean that's why we are the clay and he is the Potter sometimes there's got to be some radical changes go on but praise God for the radical changes I mean sometimes our whole shape our out look our attitude everything's going to completely change but God wants to change it that we are a vessel in his hand fit for his use amen so don't let your your environment be negative and fussing and fighting and drama we don't need drama we don't need drama here we don't I'm not a drama person I don't like drama why use our mental ability and our emotions on negative things why not build it on positive things of faith and love and security and peace and joy and the reality of God Amen why not build our lives on that why not have an environment of faith in our homes I mean where it doesn't matter what's going on there can be trouble sickness sorrow pain but there's an environment of God's more than able I serve the Jehovah of Miracles I know he's the same yesterday today and forever I know he'll pull through like he pulled through last time doesn't matter what we're facing amen shamgar killed a 600 Philistines Samson killed a thousand amen David how many he killed the Mighty Men whatever they killed why cuz the environment around them was Faith amen so we can't have a thing where we think we're better than another family that's a wrong kind of environment I mean where it's a fussing and fighting and I'm better friends with these people and these people that's a wrong kind of environment our attitude should never be negative towards one another I'm going to blast us through until it hits somewhere I mean because our attitude's got to change I'm talking about me as well I me we're going have the right kind of attitude because the right mental attitude towards any promise will bring it to pass amen and don't sit there saying well I don't know how that can work say God change me see this is not us fixing ourselves no no we aren't here to operate on ourselves the only person I've ever heard of actually doing an operation on their own selves was a Russian scientist a doctor in the in the arctic circle cut off by sea ice and had his appendix rupture and he and he fixed it himself to me that's crazy but he had to cuz he had no other way of getting medical help we're not that in that kind of condition cuz our God can can send his holy spirit ambulance send the operating theater send the specialist himself right to your door we don't have to go to a medical center here is the medical center amen he is the triage ward he is the Emer he's the operating Center we don't have to get we can't say no he can't do it no our attitude is Here I Am Lord operate on me fix me I can't fix me Lord fix me I can't fix me Lord change me I can't change me Lord when you really mean when your attitude is Lord I am your clay mold me Lord then he begins to mold and shape and change but our attitude's got to be God you can change me amen you can give me peace in my own skin amen you can make me happy with how I am Amen in terms of my upbringing my past all these things I come to peace with everything amen God you never waste a trial you never waste a past amen you want to use it For Your Glory Hallelujah we can say thank you for the scars Caleb could have said thank you for the scars Lord thank you for the beatings I received Lord because I can feel those wounds I can say I'm not a slave no more and I ain't going back to slavery no more and and sing his children children we ain't going back to slavery no more we're not going back to Egypt no more you don't want nothing of Egypt's children we're in the promised land we're living in our own Freedom doesn't matter what you think how great Egypt is it's dead there's death it's slavery Affliction pain and crying and sighing but this is a land of joy and peace and love and thankfulness amen contentment and Hallelujah and the glories of God flowing amen amen so that's why I say thank you for the skies that's why when things people's past when people are stepping into that those things that people come out of those people get really mad cuzz they realize the destruction that they were pulled out of and some people think well you're just being judgmental no we going to pluck you out of the fire pluck you out of those things it's not worth it amen sleeping with the world and committing a sin and sex and all this trouble and all nonsense it just Mars people don't touch alcohol don't touch those things there's nothing in it that's of any value and if your friends are pulling you that way I'd say find some new friends I mean find people that will actually love you and care for you my best drinking buddies at University they left me when I became a Christian they didn't care nothing I didn't even talk anything to them they left oh what kind of friends are those friends people that could get something out of you you know like you know there was um where was Paul there was somewhere there was the woman that had the had the um evil spirit would follow them you know Paul and and say here comes the people that's going to teach us the ways of the most high God and it was a woman that people used her in that condition to make money cuz she's like a fortune teller when she got liberated her the men that had her they weren't rejoicing they weren't saying I'm so thankful she's free of the spirit no they got mad they got angry they caused a riot because they wanted just to use her for their own ends and sadly a lot of friendships are people just using people for their own ends that's how you know if the friendship's wrong if if if your friend makes a step closer to God hallelujah we should not let peer pressure even in a church and young people hold each other back from serving God we should be encouraging one another God's real we can have an upper room experience we can see the pillar of fire we can have visitations of angels we can see God fulfill his word in our lives not just someone else's lives our lives God Can Transform us right now change our lives we should be encouraging one another our God is mighty our God is able our God is present Our God loves us Our God cares about us our God wants to see his word fulfilled in our lives our God saved us that's that's why we should be thrusting that's why we should be just should be the whole thing of Our Lives hallelujah amen hallelujah what kind of environment would that create where we come to an attitude and say God you can call out my sin if I come to church yes Lord I want everything under the blood what kind of attitude will that generate coming to church that's it Lord you can you can call out my whole life if you wanted to but if it's under the blood God don't see it amen like like brother Tim PR tells a testimony of a a wife of a deacon in his church she was just a young you know you know she was in the meetings here with brother Braham she was just a young teenager at the time she was smoking you know hiding it from her parents and she is in the prayer line she didn't know smoking was bad she was just you know and then and then a couple of people in front of her was standing before the prophet and the angel of the Lord was there and discerned you're a smoker if you get rid of those cigarettes saying you know you'll become a real Christian you'll get the Holy Ghost and she's there a few a few steps behind this man and her parents are in the audience and she's now stressing out because she's thinking within herself when I stand before that Prophet God's going to call out I'm smoking and not telling my parents I'm going to get in big trouble so what did what did she do she started repenting right there in her heart saying Lord forgive me take this from me Lord I'm sorry Lord I didn't know it was was evil and when she got her turn in front of the Prophet the angel of God said nothing about the cigarettes why cuz it was under the blood God can't see what he's covered or actually I could say God can't see what you have covered under the blood what you have confessed hallelujah hallelujah amen what kind of what kind of attitude would we have when we really realize the significance my sins are gone I'm I'm clean there's no there's nothing held against me am me all of my guilt my shame my pain my past is washed away God can't see it h I walk undefiled in his presence amen made in his goodness hallelujah what kind of attitude should that generate hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen is the Lord good hallelujah oh my I think it be just build atmosphere of Faith say God you can do anything in this moment Lord you can change us Lord you can touch the violence darkest centner amen amen you can change me oh God hallelujah hallelujah that the sword of the spirit can really get chopping Hallelujah see when you go into the shikina presence of God it changes all that you are can we go down to why are people so tossed about this is just not talking but it's going to start talking can you go down to um I don't know what number the slide is sorry yes here we go but has it come here if it is then your whole makeup is Christ your attitude notice how we lists attitude first your attitude your desires your appetite your everything is Christ yielded resting everything perfect no matter how dull it looks or how black it looks still it's the same Christ is in you he speaks to The Sinner and the voice that he would speak to the sinner in he speaks to the prostitute in the voice he would speak to them in he thinks through your mind the very thoughts that he speaks through your heart the very way that he would if he was here on Earth yeah who wants that kind of life amen that he thinks his thoughts in your mind how you speak as if he was speaking to the sinner to The Prostitute to anyone like that am me brother R would tell a story where he was at a meeting or between meetings and he went into this Diner and it's I think it's in the middle of the day and there's there's this old woman with blue hair and stuff and she drinking with these cops and different ones standing around a a was it a jukebox you know a music machine whatever um I'm sure you can find in a museum somewhere you know but old school music player right and in his heart he starts condemning this woman saying what kind how low down and how terrible he's just got this righteous what he thinks is righteous indignation and then the Lord then starts and and so he's condemning this woman then he begins to see a vision of the earth and then around the Earth is a circle of blood and then there's the Lord Jesus hanging on the cross and then and then and then he begins to see black streaks coming up from the earth and and then and then the Lord is a barrier because because above the Lord is the holy Throne of God where judgment comes and the Lord Jesus is being a barrier that all the sin of the earth is actually striking him that doesn't hit the throne and and and the angel tells him in the vision that's your sin coming up that's not just even other people said that's your sin that's coming up but my but the blood of the Lord is a barrier that it can't get here because if it gets up where God is then the judgment will come upon you and brother Bram said that changed his attitude then he went and talked to the woman said look can I do you mind if I talked to you a bit and he actually relays the vision what what he was thinking towards her in her in his heart and the vision he just saw and then she begins to tell her her life story to him and how she was once a Christian trouble came in now she's like this and you know and they have a prayer meeting in that Dino and the prophet leads her back to the Lord I think the men that were with her why because his attitude changed that's how God see God can't work through a bad attitude God can't work through a condescending judgmental attitude he can't work through a poor me attitude he can't work through those things he's got to work through his attitude in you amen hallelujah amen it can't be our human atude and his attitude at the same time it's got to be one or the other so I say Lord may it just be your attitude amen that we see that we see everyone in amen see so that's if you're in the Shak of Glory this is how you are he say I take it myself you I hope you don't mind these quotes and we're going to wrap up I take it myself I'm actually about to close I take it myself before God as my judge I put it in the gospel work Yonder as I know that on the day that I'll have to give an account for my stewardship it's given correctly that's exactly right cuz I realize I treat the people I'm treating God cuz some people say well I've got a good attitude towards God but do you love your brother do you love your sister cuz John said if you don't love them you don't love him you're living in a delusion right so as I treat the people I'm treating God just my attitude towards you is my attitude towards Christ so what's your attitude just do a mental check now what's your attitude towards everyone amen that's your attitude towards your lord and your attitude towards me is the same thing that's right towards Christ I hope our attitude's good I hope our attitude towards one another is the same attitude Christ has towards you and I amen amen see it's we we must have the right attitude if you want to use the sword of the spirit you got to have the right attitude if you want to receive that inspiration of God and cutting you got to have the right attitude am mean people who get caught up and say we should run people out of church we should run people out of the city can can we go down just to down towards um uh the next slide early spiritual experiences next one down thank you amen see brother Bram was having this you uh this was when he was referring to when he um when when um the pillar of fire photograph was taken in Houston Texas and there was the man who uh I think it was Dr best a Baptist he wanted to run brother Bram out of the out of the city and um but then notice this he brother B says this here he says now he says about you know brother Bosworth wanted to debate him and brother R said well as long as you don't fussed him just debate he said fine we'll have a debate and brother R said okay you can go do that and he said the second day he came out this is I think Dr best he says said I ought to said said brother Braham which is the ey there ought to be run out of the city he ought to be the guy to do it well that now just to me if you'll excuse the expression that showed me the man hadn't been to Calvary yet you can never you never take a Christian a Christian don't take that attitude when you're born again you love your brother that's right so if you have the right see if your attitude is that person's a pain in the neck I'm so annoyed of that person that family d d that's the wrong attitude that attitude is not you haven't been to Calvary yet I say like the prophet said when you've been to Calvary then mercy can be extended then God's attitude can be on display in your life then you can view one another as he views you Hallelujah right because those who have never been to Calvary have a judgmental condescending attitude right it's a self-ability attitude the they they want to be the big shot I tell you what the Holy Ghost takes the big shot out of you I me it takes that critical nature out of you you cannot have a critical nature and have the Holy Ghost living in your life that's the nature of a wolf is a critical attitude amen but the nature of a dove is a loving kind thoughtful attitude amen that puts others before themselves that actually views the other as Christ views them I mean well how does Christ view them well he had a joy set before him when he went to Calvary that was that person that was that person you may think rubbish of someone that was that person he went for that he didn't just go for you he went for them amen that was his attitude my joy is that person on the other side made in my image and Eternity with me forever and ever and ever and ever and ever that that was his attitude that's why he went what's our attitude this morning you never cut through any demon power with a bad attitude Hallelujah God our lord Jesus cut through everything that could be cut through yeah he was that sword amen it's our attitude or approach it's all what it's about now the right attitude is everything because the right attitude ties him with faith I'm now I am actually really closing the SOP phenician woman had a lot of hindrances but her attitude was if I just get to Jesus and he speaks my daughter's going to be free that was her attitude that was her sold out madeup attitude her attitude wasn't well I'll see what happens or I'll see how I'm accepted or surely I will be accepted because my case is so bad that was not her attitude her attitude was I must get to this man he must speak he must speak to my situation this is what I need and it was according to the word of God so that her attitude was right and and and and and the disciples tried to discour her Jesus himself tried to discourage her but he knew the faith that was within her amen right he knew the faith within her was yielding the sword of the spirit if I put it that way it cut through all of the obstacles that she was going through all the hindrances were being cut through because Faith doesn't know hindrances right if you've got the right kind of Faith I'll say you've got the right kind of attitude amen and it doesn't see she had a lot of hindrances but her faith didn't have any faith knows only one thing it's goal that's all amen amen that's what faith knows so she got what she needed because her attitude was right and and and the right kind of attitude is Lord I must get to you I must get the answer to this question I must lord I can't just go through the motions and just sit here question no Lord I must get there amen now I got this photo don't laugh at it too much oh can we go down to the three there we are I want to find David's three Mighty Men they had an attitude if our King wants a drink it's a commandment to us they did not put up with well we just we we can't get through these Philistines I'm not going to endanger myself no I say they picked up the sword of the spirit because the word said I want a fresh drink I want a fresh worship I don't want a stagnant pull here I I want to I want to drink from where I was when I was young there a David I want The Well of Bethlehem and so what did they do they took their swords these three I don't know if youve seen the film and make a plug for it it's very good cuz it's three men living everyday kind of lives trouble comes in and they don't put up with it they pull the sword of the spirit what they have prayer until they break through then they go get what they have need of Amen are we okay today let's not sit still we're not dumb sheep we may be but we're not dumb sheep we're not dumb Buffalo amen we're here to kill every enemy and get every promise that's ours amen so they cut through brother R said that they cut through 15 miles of Flesh of Philistines and they got their King a cool drink of water from the well he long for and he brought it and they cut through again another 15 miles cuz it was a return trip and they brought that water back to David and David said oh you know you my men have jeopardized this I'm not worthy to drink it pours it out as a drink offering before the Lord but you see there's going to be a people they're gonna cut through every problem I mean that they're gonna get their King a fresh drink of Pentecostal worship they're gonna get their King a fresh drink of worship of Praise of God Amen that the enem is trying to what wall up every promise but there will be a people that will stand up on the battlefield and say Lord put that sword in my hand Hallelujah my attitude Lord is the Lord the sword of your word works and I'm not stopping till every enemy is dead amen Hallelujah God is going to have a people that will drink from that well amen hallelujah you might think I'm crazy maybe I am then I'm crazy about Jesus Christ and his word if I'm going to be called a fool let me be called a fool for his word I've never been against men in them organizations I'm against that system that's bearing the word of God out let's cut Warriors stand by us let's go into that well he's our Bethlehem amen so let's go and get a fresh drink of water amen indifference is coming against you it's a Philistine lukewarmness has coming against you it's a Philistine I mean Pain's come against you it's a Philistine discouragements come against you it's a Philistine what are you going to do about them are you going to stand there and say well I guess I'm older I'm more mature I just you this is just how things are or you going to say no I remember the beginning I remember the beginning where God moved in power and he was alive and he proved his word to me and everything was amazing and I want to go back to that Lord that's why David said I want to go back to when I was young I want to drink that same well when I was young and God says I want you to go back to a Pentecost back to a book of Acts experience back to the reality of when I had preeminence in your life am me go back to that we say yes Lord we're going back to that and that's what the message brings us back to where God is moving in power and reality that our attitude is Lord you can do anything anytime any place anywhere with me cuz I am available my attitude is your attitude Lord do what you want to do in my life amen hallelujah I trust you feel that way this morning Hallelujah
