in the presence of the Lord musicians thank you your have your seats um sorry yes I actually wanted to um just have Grace I just want to jump here to a I think it is one Peter one first 20 um sorry it's one of the ironically one of the verses I I didn't write down um I'll just jump here to my trusty old device yes praise the Lord so we'll start there from verse 19 um Tyler you can put that um scripture up I didn't put it in there um one Peter one verse 19 and 20. actually let's start at verse 18 is so powerful for as much as we you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as Sovereign goes from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who really was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you may the Lord bless the reading of his word and you may have your seats says before we go on I know we've got a couple of birthdays so I really want to start off with I don't know if he's watching I don't know if there's um what do they call that thing in South Africa where the all the power goes off load shedding happy birthday Reuben Hannah who am I missing who am I missing the sister Vanessa happy birthday God bless you what a day what a day what a day let me tell you what a day to be alive as well right so we'll get to the prophet Sid you can you can eat too much you can sleep too much but you can never tonight we have a bunch of prayer requests I really want to get through them why why is the prerequis getting along and long and longer is it because there's a bigger need maybe but because Lord the god answers prayer we come here and we testify and we give witness so tonight I've got a little little thought and I'll maybe try and explain quickly the background that we have my thought I maybe you won't believe this but I was washing dishes I was doing something at the at the Basin and and I think the kids were watching some sort of Bible story and but and and I still told today don't know something triggered something was said and it triggered and I said Disobedience Disobedience and I think I I said that to um brother being Disobedience as a as a learned behavior so and that's what I wanted to make my title but then I thought it's a bit strong is a bit hard to you know let's let's liven it up a bit or make it a bit positive what's the opposite of that and the Lord's my witness I was sitting today and I Was preparing through oh all my meetings and and I thought uh not me the Lord showed me it's inherited behavior so the opposite of this of this um learned behavior is inherited behavior so I'll I'll stay in that title and how that thought became I was like we've heard it so many times we're born and shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies that's right but is that where we start to exist is that where we as beings not the flesh but our vessels internally and our souls fine God bless you hey good to see you um um is that is that where our journey start okay and that's this is where and and this this thing took a took a big uh a big Journey so um I hope you are who who here likes visual who who works with oh okay the majority voice what is minority and what's majority I I taught you hey yeah yeah so the majority likes visual so I I love visual I just it a big ship paints a thousand words it paints a picture paints a thousand words that one so it explains more than I can do with this with his uh crooked mouth of mine so please bear with me and I've got a lot of thoughts and I'll probably hammer on this one thing um inherited versus learned behavior okay so let's kick off let's kick off so my thought was um Lucifer so where where was Luther I'll get to him I'll get to Martin Luther Lucifer uh Sun of the morning right he was God's right-hand man as has been described he had Authority right he had a lot of power right and I thought well what went wrong so there he started off God's God's right hand man and where did the end we all know where is he going to end where it is where did he end he's quite low so he started off quite high he but he ended quite low and now from there I jumped to this third line so coming to the world speaking lies hanon where's the Bible hand on the Bible I I've I've not taught my kids to lie right right so who taught them where did this come from right so now I'm jumping back to Lucifer Sun of the morning and it was there and he had everything he had every he had everything and he's there oh but I want a bit more oh I've got this inheritance here I have I have it in my hands and I'm thinking but if only I do this so if only I go set to the north and I can build a kingdom there only if I can rise above these clouds of God this the stars of God just he wanted that and you know it was just incredible to to think he was that high and he fell that low of that thought that thought and that for me that's a learned thought this is something now with reason this is something that he hasn't inherited but now he's putting in a in in flesh a fleshly thought these two top two inches so foreign for thou has said in thine heart and this is now Lucifer Prophet saying I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also amount upon the Mount of the congregation in the size of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high God have mercy right so let's get into then what what to describe this learned behavior right and this is from Britannica we'll read there awesome in the early 1930s the distinction between learned and inherited behavior seemed very or clearer than it is today with all these um let's say gray areas that's now in population The View that any bit of behavior either was learned or simply developed without learning seemed straightforward studies based on these expectations LED investigators to conclude that in this case rat killing Behavior among cats is learned rather than instinctive so keep that in the back of your head in your mind that human fears are all acquired or that intelligence is completely the result of experience learning theorists were saying then then that most behavior is learned and that by biological factors are of little or no importance um that human fears are all acquired right and and cats learned rather than instinctively to kill right um very interesting jumping to theology now philosophically and and I had to keep my mouth keep my tongue because because when I started reading this I go I so want to do it in a proper English accent you know to sort of I was I was almost falling asleep halfway through reading that and I go what is that what are they on about you know theology now thinking about now spiritual jackets thinking about um learned behavior theology philosophically orientated discipline of religious speculation and apologetics that is traditionally restricted because of its Origins and format to Christianity but now gray matter here it comes again gray area but that might also Encompass because of its theme are the religions including especially Islam and Judaism the themes of theology include as of you know it's just one of those things maybe include God you know you know include God Humanity the world salvation and eschatology the study of last times um the book of symbols Revelations right so jumping back now to learn Behavior versus inherited behavior job 38. where was thou when I lay the foundation of the earth declare if there has understanding where were you job that's awesome eh so did he had learned behavior when when God came down and job that's a hard that's a few hard chapters if you go reads 36 37 38 God doesn't stop 39 40 41 go count how many question marks the Lord gives gives over here and he goes here and he says okay so where were you you know it struck me you know and and to be to be job and when job's shoes right there that would have been um he he tried to explain himself here in about Job 40 saying I will keep my mouth his God said I'm not done I'm I'm going to continue I'm going to tell you now and I'm gonna ask you this and you please um if if you jump to I think verse 3 and 2 gird up your loins stand up like a man you know now God's speaking like you know it was it's incredible so this is what I want to hint at here it's not learned behavior okay so I want to tell you and I want to give now a few crude examples okay well some of them include some of them are really relative uh relevant and I'll start off you know I'm a visual person so girls this time I didn't forget you I've got a picture for you okay oh my so here we go we go back to there's about 2003 my own experience right and I'm I'm engaged to Sister Lundy where's you okay she knew this was coming maybe I read my notes um so yeah there there I was and um it's now time to get married it's now time to you know get the ring you know and people that know me I like one of a kind I like custom I like you know uniqueness I thought I can't buy just any other ring no no no this is not going to work I'm gonna design her ring I thought okay you know months go by months go by and it sketches and it's and I got this this contact this friend of a a friend of a friend Joan I think his name is from nelspruit now nelspruit in Pretoria is probably about three four hours drive so some weekends we'll get together he'll bring me the precious stones you know the diamonds and sapphires and everything and a big little black bag and we meet up at a at a coffee shop and he put it on the table and say okay this one is that Clarity a v or something this one you know beautiful and take the shape and everything and we are and we look like diamond Smugglers you know it's a you know just looking around left and right but you know um didn't want to you know want to keep it a secret and one day one day so now we settled on the design we settled what we want to do on the stones everything the white gold the yellow gold what carrot what you know the list goes on and it's now being made right it's in the process and I'm in anticipation and one day we're walking through I think it was menlyn mall and as you do the boys walk at the back and the girls are chatty chatty there at the front and one bad habit of mine I my ears go everywhere so I listen to our conversation their conversation everyone walks past and she says I do not like sapphires and I'm like Lord and I thought I thought you know I've got this and I have you want to guess what ring I Made Girls there were sapphires in it because I couldn't ask her and I couldn't you know what do you like what don't you like this is actually a ring right so I took the picture today and I Photoshopped it a little bit and um so then I mean have you ever seen a six foot one 105 kilogram man not be able to breathe you know feeling like this came over me now all the what am I going to do you know what so this is now me and just crudely showing learned I haven't learned yet so I I thought I assumed I said this is this is that you know she would like this she would like this ring she would that blue is so deep and dark you know she would appreciate it brings out the diamond you know all this and I hear that and I go oh my what am I going to do is busy being made sorry I think a week goes by and I'm stressing and I thought okay I have to sit down I have to tell her or ask her and I said um you don't like sapphires as you see no no no no I said okay and I had to come clean I said Well the ring is being made and surprise the Sapphire's in there you know she said no no okay so let me give you context I do not like that as the as the main centerpiece I don't like so if there's a I said there's definitely a diamond okay okay a wasted and I said and I showed her you still got the pencil drawing from the first year so I said this is what as she said perfect and I go sure okay so as long it was not the centerpiece you know she so I thought okay praise the Lord I'm safe I'm safe right so crude little example other example that is not learned behavior in which which is very surprising you know we've got this little thing in the rugby between the All Blacks and the springboks and you know I grew up as a spring book you know and not never really got hold of this black Jersey and um we're sitting in watching some of the game and and I asked the boys to you know who are you rooting for and they all go to South Africa they all go springboks I said my but you you were born here you were raised here you know the guys on first name basis and and and and but you don't know one Springbok what's happening here you know I didn't teach them that I didn't you know where did that come from you know I thought well that must be you know born in you okay let's make it a bit more relevant one Samuel 16. then answered one of the servants and said behold I have seen a son of Jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning and playing and mighty Valiant man and man of war and prudent in matters and comely person and by the way the Lord is with him okay so I think you know where I'm going with this David a young man now I just want to point out that I only saw it I only clicked today or the penny dropped a mighty Valiant man a man of war zone talking about a man here a lot of people think okay was he 8 19 years old I'm thinking now more like he's 13. what I want to tell the boys here 13 years old you're a man okay Jews traditions and whatever we skip or they skip teenager teenager is not a it's not in the equation okay and I'm trying to teach that to the boys as well it's not an excuse to you know have a way out all right so you were a boy and you became a man there was a there was this distinct end so they're talking here about a man and it was definitely a very young man so I will give him the benefit of the doubt and I think he was about 13 years old right so here they're talking about uh uh to come play for soul you know it's all on the on the on the Hub right but then in in chapter 17 it goes into Goliath right now when he was there on the on the on the on the field on the with his brothers at the war he had to justify and say um if I'm the right man to take on Goliath and one of the things he did they said well I've killed the bear and I've killed the lion right and he he he didn't lie okay now one of the things if you who's not from South Africa okay on or any country that's got a lion in it okay or hasn't been close to a line in the wild a male line is about 250 kilograms okay slightly bigger than me okay with claws that long with teeth that long okay you do not pit it okay there's a few tourists that go there in the Kruger National Park and hang out the window you do not pit it you do not come close to it okay boy have you had a experience firsthand with a lion or a leopard or something you run the opposite way it is as simple as that okay now I want to show you here here's how the the white South African hunts a lion okay I'm totally against hunting lions so a grainy picture probably for a reason these two guns there so two people one closest to the camera is a professional Hunter okay and one of The Trackers so you need to be an exceptional Hunter an exceptional tracker for Lions this particular this particular scenario they were hunting a line and was probably a tourist and am I still on yep um when when they got to basically this point so they they checked this lion track this line then they started crossing the tracks again and they thought okay I started wandering and so the long and shoulders now they being hunted so the the line is not a dumb animal as well so 250 kg is that long this long that Annie's not dumb so now the hunter has become the hunted okay two individuals with guns here's little Lefty he's got a gun as well and here is two individuals with guns as well the one here on the left is uh is another professional answer so two professional answers I'll point to something here right here so have a look there that that is that individual's gun the rifle okay I don't know health and safety Armand does that work for you yeah people in front of a gun okay so this is now on fear and Desperation because this line has destroyed is coming through the bush they cannot see it in that shrub it's it's brown it's winter and and the Lion's Brown so I don't know why you wouldn't do that but anyway so they do not know where it's coming from um if ever have you heard a lion roar it is in 3D absolutely Amplified right so here you've got boys and girls did you count how many rifles uh oh wait okay five so these two there's one and here's the other two okay that's how they hunt a lion okay here's David just a representation here's David now maybe he had a sling maybe at a club maybe had a stick I don't know okay would you still would you go after a lion because one lost sheep I can tell you in the flesh what I would have done in their cheap cult if one of got lost said sorry Dad you know it's a lion he would have understood right he killed this line and he killed the bear now according to what I've done my research is before he even knew he's going to be anointed king before Samuel came to him so he had already something in him what taught him about this lion what taught him how to hunt and kill a lion in that age where does that come from that is for me that's inherited behavior it's not learned behavior right so let me just see if I'm following my notes correctly yes awesome thank you Lord the next one Eagle in the chicken coop okay Eagle in the chicken coop now what is interesting here is and maybe I'll use brother brother again as an example he's had chickens before so if you have chickens in the chicken coop what is one of the dangers you have in Africa with a chicken coop yep and what comes on the ground snakes right and and one of the snakes we used to call escarp sticker right I don't know what's that in English but it's scorp is is a is a sheep and a Scorpio is as it stings as it bites you know so this this Eagle is in the chicken coop he doesn't belong there okay and it it's not it's appetite it's not getting you know so now he's sitting there and he's just checking he's he's not the same they've done research and this one farmer took a eagle egg took a chicken egg swapped or two right it hatched chicken went on there was the the the eagle hatched eaglet it hatched she said oh it's okay you know you look a bit different but you carried on this this is true it's even YouTube you can go and Google that the eagle as soon as that thing hatched it kept it away from itself from its other Bibles and from itself didn't feed it fit its own there was immediately a distinction a a I am identifying you are not one of mine okay it's powerful because this is this is inherent this is not a learned behavior but now this this Eagle in the chicken coop now brother Paul if you had one of these Eagle in your chicken coop and there's a snake coming in would you be worried with one of those Eagles in there I'm telling you now the snake is six love he's lost he's lost that battle so just imagine Here Comes This sneaky little serpent into this chicken coop and he finds this oddly looking chicken and he goes the the ego goes and he asks him what are you doing here if immediately with his inherited behavior he said you die and I Stay Alive you come and threaten me you die you know it is not taught to him it is inside of him now three three men three men in the fire so three men in the fire and there's a fourth man I just want to say here a little Segway well the bean sister Margie we're thinking of you guys Three Men and there's a fourth man in the fire with you guys please believe that please believe that but I what I do love about the scripture and I'll put it up now sir Jack Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will Deliver Us from thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy God nor worship any golden image as thou set up they were not careful with the answer brothers and sisters we cannot be careful with our answer we have to stand for something otherwise we'll fall for anything right and in this what we've received through Grace we're saying we've got an inheritance I've learned a lot of things I've learned a lot of theologies I've learned I've Church hopped so many times right and here I come and I've testified last last week again I walked into this into this place not this particular premises but I walked in and the Deacon was song leading and Sister Christine was on the piano and brother Ben was absolutely seeking crooked and could only walk on one leg the Lord told me they this is where you will worship so he took away everything that I thought okay this will get me closer to God the music the shows the the building you know everything he stripped it away and he said here's where you will worship me okay that's inheritance that is that is not a learned behavior he had to strip away my learned behavior to get to that place to to tie to that to add to that notice each time she indicated we're talking now about an eve about a church about an organized religion what she do what does she do each time this church like Eve did she forced her not this church not this church she forced her Adams to believe a new light her scheme and there died with it well we'll all our group will get together oh and we'll we'll have new blessings what we found and so forth right coming back to just a simple question and maybe I'll rephrase that I won't put it in a question I would have put a statement it is learned behavior if if someone comes to you and asks you why are you Christian and you answer I don't want to go to hell that's learned behavior for me okay why are you a Christian why are you redeemed Son of God why did you drive all this way through this cold on the other side of town I stopped here perfect timing and as Lundy went in with the boys I was sitting in the car and immediately started hailing you know it just came down I had every reason to stay at home you know if you look from a human perspective a human lens but because I'm saved by grace I have to stand in this day I I'm a Christian because I love him I'm a Christian because he's done so much to me still doing he hasn't left me I can see like Eagle Vision that eagle and chicken coop is no longer in the chicken coop praise the Lord for that I'm soaring now now the storms come and I as the eagle see the storm put up my wings and I could go just above the clouds above that storm it is as simple as that and that's why again coming back to our prayer request that's why that list is becoming big because there's a realness we're getting into each other's burdens and we see praise get answered praise the Lord for that you see the devil wants you to unknow God he wants you learning away from God God wants you to know his heart so that means you need to get closer to him to his heartbeat right I just want to throw this in here Jesus comes and tests our inheritance when and and and in how we answer okay John 21 so when uh when they had died Jesus asked Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas love us though me more than these he said unto them now imagine they're dining they're eating they're sitting he's fellowshipping and he's busy with a piece of chicken and he said yeah Lord thou knowest I love thee you know just he says she feed my sheep feed my Lambs I say up to him a second time son Simon now what I want to point out here is the answer hasn't changed he's giving the same answer but is that a Sunday school answer and and I'm saying this reverently is it is it something that you mean is it something coming from your inheritance right love us thou me answers yea Lord thou knowest I love thee feed my sheep he said okay he asked him a third time son now Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time lovers tell me and now he says and I can see the attitude changed and I can see the sincerity and reverence change he says Lord thou knowest all things so that's like search me Lord see my heart Creator me a clean heart see me thou knowest that I love thee Jesus said feed my sheep and that's not just for the ministers by the way okay yes before we read that I'll just say there was a nice little Point here uh brother Branham sees as Noah Moses David reflected the coming of the perfect bride groom so as Luther Wesley Pentecost reflected the coming of a Perfect Bride why am I saying that because each of those Messengers had to have inheritance in them one of those messages for example Martin Luther why what inside of him cried out and said this is not right what cried that that he had to do that 95 thesis it was not learned behavior at that point that made him pick up his pen even though he was a scholar in arts and theology but something in there said there's love in this truth and that needs to get to the people right so that's inheritance for me that's a messenger that inside something keeps holding me there's something pressing something you know just so after the truth you know and divine love okay yeah now I just want to make this quite personal with um with us in our church with our message that we believe this is Brother Brennan speaking now someone has been saying to me and theologians theologians brother brother if the Lord God said it with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbling saying this said you would be eligible to write write a Bible yourself your word if God has manifested I said it might be true so he's saying but look now what's happening he was trying to catch me see I see but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications don't know what he's talking about in terms of qualifications I said what do you what you look but but look one word cannot be added or taken away see and he said well then them seven Thunders UC said even them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there in there in the Bible in the word it's there you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word binding some or blinding some and opening the eyes of others that'll always do that that's at attitude that's that inheritance that's talking about here but thinking about brother Branham when he opened all those seven vials Seven Seals seven Thunders he could easily have gone from this what I've learned yes I can be a little bit higher I can be a bit better the laws revealed all this to me well what does he do he goes back to the word he said this has been revealed to me but it's all in here I will not add and I will not take away blessed be the name of the Lord and um let's finish on this thing eh where was thou when I lay the foundations of the earth declare if thou understanding Ephesians 1 sees according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love we've been chosen before the foundation of the world we've come to this earth to yes to learn we've come to this earth to do a lot of things but your inherited behavior your attitude and what I loved about brother Ben uh Ben Bailey today was the praise God let's let's give God thanks because of the trials right so they're going through a big trial and we all are um but that's attitude of inheritance that's saying the Lord can change this the Lord has given this trial the lord giveth and taketh away blessed be the Holy Name so let us let us go sort of into um I think into maybe worship if we could sing a few songs um musicians if you want to come [Music] you are you are his bride you are his inheritance you've received and inside of you is is is stocked up everything that you need believe that I think before we I'll read out the um the prayer requests that I have and then we'll go to the congregation for that how do we have a song no no um can we could kill you on drums can we I want to I'm a taster as a profession I want to taste something I'm gonna start singing and I'll see your response is [Music] [Music] thank you we are the children we are the children of God we come from God [Music] we come from Jerusalem [Music] Hallelujah [Music] who lose [Music] Hallelujah [Music] where are you coming from we are the children of God we come from God we're going back we are the children of God [Music] [Music] [Applause]
