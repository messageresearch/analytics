to have you back I mean brother Marty sister know me well god bless you great to have you amen hallelujah if you got your Bibles handy let's go to Colossians chapter 1 you're gonna read a few scriptures that just a family we're gonna just speak a bit before we go into the communion I mean it what a wonderful time to be a Christian when I read from verse 12 of Colossians chapter one sees here giving thanks unto the father who has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints and light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins it was the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church which is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things and earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by work by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled and we're just gonna read the next verse a lot and the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh prover ball in his sight hallelujah may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats add this evening I mean I'd like to what do we know her brother Branham took this portion of Scripture and he preached there the mystery of God revealed and I'd like to take just a small thought out of that message where you know it's so tremendous when you see the power of the power of the blood that takes a people that were that were and in the devil's pawn shoppers brother Brown says you know we were we were slaves to him we were under his mastery where he where it says in Ephesians chapter two that we once walked according to the Prince of the power of the year but he but we but our Lord has quickened us made us alive I remember once we were slaves to the enemy we're a slaves to our sin nature amen when we could not help ourselves we could not it no man can improve himself can change his nature you know there's that you're the bookstores are full of self-help books but you cannot change the nature of man by your own ability we were all in a prison we were all lost and undone but God Richard mercy he knew where his people were he knew the H they would be manifested in he knew the the country they were from in you the appearance he knew their culture they'd be raised him he knew what the enemy would try and put down their throats and what kind of complexes and and things that they wouldn't hear it from their forebears he knew all about that but yet in spite of all those things that didn't bother him one but hallelujah he didn't needn't worry how much the enemy thought he had is hold on someone God didn't get all panicky and worried how am I going to deliver this one I mean because he knew holy that has his blood his word his bleeding word was more than enough to take her people and wash them and transform them hallelujah and give them his nature hallelujah our God was not you know he's not worried what situation we found ourselves in I mean whatever our first birth produced in our lives he wasn't too worried about it because he knew his transforming power ami could take that person and make them into a new creature we are not a patched up people and then we're not just a this is not a Reformation this is a transformation holy we're not a reformed people were being transformed I mean by this endtime message hallelujah we are a new creation in Christ I mean just like he would take he would speak to Abraham now now Abraham was was Evren before God changed his name and and that and that H you know he put in Abraham's name if you go into the Hebrew that's like the breath of God and he breathed into them and he bred Sarah as well he put the Acer huh in the in their names that's God's breath coming into them making them a new creation holy just like Adam the pinnacle of pinnacle of um you know God's creation was now a man in a body and when when God formed that body and he put the spirit man into that body it says he breathes into him and he became a living soul hallelujah it's a God breathed on Adam and him he came alive in this flesh body and and he breathed on him because he because he wanted him to become God over the earth I mean so a breeze on his people is God's Spirit goes into them hallelujah for them to manifest a portion of his word holy just like Abraham I mean he was he was mmm and he did a lot of things in his flesh he had Ishmael he did a lot of different things but then when his name was changed after God breathed on him I mean it you know it's a type of the Holy Ghost coming into a person I mean and now when God is speaking now to Abraham he says take thy son thine only son Isaac take him up the mountain now we would look in our carnal minds and say what about us well he was his son as well but that was the creature Abraham's son that was not Abraham son you understand so so everything that Abraham did was not attributed to Abraham I mean because he was a new creature in Christ hallelujah as a type hallelujah though yiddishe momme was walking upon the earth and doing all different kinds of things when God looked down at Abraham he was a need and bringing to Abraham's life and he it wasn't allotted to him hallelujah Edison was same with the Bride of Christ we may have done a lot of things under our first birth I mean we made that a lot of things we're not pleased with the proud over even remotely and may man your might even make shudder to think we used to do those things but when God looks at you after than your birth I mean those things are attributed to you I mean you're a new creature you're a new creature in Christ Jesus hallelujah I mean this is what Easter means to me hallelujah I did a lot of bad things for 20-odd years minute most of it pretty much all what I'm not proud of I mean one day God came this message came my way and Jesus Christ became a living reality hallelujah made me a new creature hallelujah that's why you're the devil as I said he's not a good historian because they only come so far the only tells you of the bad part of your past but he never tells you at the time that he was he was cast out of you I mean when Jesus Christ took the throne of your heart I mean in Satan was despised and he was cast out and he was defeated holily and then when he came back he was defeated again hallelujah this devil does not remind you of those things because he does not like that kind of history but he remembers those days hallelujah amen so now our Lord Jesus is the head of the body the church hallelujah now he's speaking of a multi a mini membered body that have come out of every kindred nation and tongue hallelujah this is his body now so but in order to take this body he has to pay a price to redeem this body hallelujah so now he goes to Calvary he pays a price because he has in his mind I've got a people I've got a wife I need to redeem and I'm not and I'm not happy at all that she is under the bonds of Satan I do not want her I mean being caught between me and him I want to break that I want to break that chain I mean completely that these people aren't and under heavily under his influence and under my influence I don't want that kind of a bride I want a bride that loves me I want to bribe that all her hardest to serve me hallelujah that she's not interested in the devil and anything that he can try and wave in front of her face I'm in bitter hardest completely turned to my word I mean that loves me above all things hallelujah this is the kind of body that he wants that a a body that is completely longing a hundred percent to him hallelujah remember remember our Lord Jesus when he purchased your Redemption he didn't have to pay interest off I mean there wasn't more repayments that he had to pay hallelujah you're not mortgaged out whoever it is he paid the price in full he wants a full Redemption he will not rest until there is a full redemption of his bride hallelujah that is his purpose I mean that is the reason that that he would have preeminence over a people as that they would love him with everything that they are Amen that they are hers as this Bible says in another place we are the purchased possession hallelujah now if something fully belongs to you you don't have to pay someone else a bit more to get it I mean it's like those who maybe have bought a house you're still paying off your mortgage that is not completely yours I mean situations could change the bank and come and take your house away because not fully yours but the Lord Jesus did didn't do that Amen if there's a mortgage he's still paying off the filing will become as purchased possession that is not as purpose when he hung there between heavens and earth and said it is finished I mean he was declaring I painted and full I mean I paid the full price of redemption hallelujah now for the next two thousand years he's been enforcing that Redemption Amen down on through that he would take her people through seven Church ages Amen and he would manifest himself to those people and they they would manifest the word for their age hallelujah like Luther manifested the word for his age Wesley manifested the word for his age Pentecost their age but now that now it's a bright age holy the Prophet tells us we're living in a bright age Amen where there's a people he speaks about the bride coming of Jesus Christ and I trust you don't choke on that because even the Bible says that any spirit that says Jesus Christ has not is not in flesh as Antichrist not not has come past it but it's coming flesh you go read the scripture anyone that says that Jesus has not come in the flesh as Antichrist so that's not saying oh yeah because many people say yes he came 2,000 years ago he was there he's our lamb he's our Redeemer he was there manifested the man of God olia now he yo he died for our sins and he rose again forevermore I guess he was there but then when you say Jesus and me feels they hold up what do you mean a a bride coming well there was a bride coming on the day of Pentecost when the bride 120 members of the bride were in the upper room and the same Jesus Christ in a different form came in 12th and his bride hallelujah there was a bride coming there so it's not a there's nothing new it's been happening down through 7 Church ages but now we're manifesting the fullness of the word and then we're Pentecost had a part Luther had a part Wesley had a part now the entire you know scripture has come open then we're not men if we're not manifesting part of Jesus but all of him amen and that's why brother I said now we're in a bride age because our Lord Jesus he's in Revelations 3 he's been kicked out of the church world so he's got to find a place to manifest so he calls a bride out hallelujah he comes and dwells and those people he manifests were through those people I mean what a tremendous thing where we are not we are not shackled up to any organized organization of man and then we have no headquarters upon this earth how headquarters is in heaven hallelujah we'd have to report to some man upon this earth we report to this man Christ Jesus in heaven hallelujah and he's here to take control amen of his people hallelujah so we don't belong to the devil we do not belong to this world I mean I'm not accountable to the devil I'm not accountable to this world I mean to this world I'm accountable to Jesus Christ the word hallelujah I mean there's nothing holding me here I'm a free I'm a free man I mean I'm not a slave I'm a free man hallelujah recognize yourself free are you following me Jesus comes he breaks every chain he breaks every hold the devil has he may be in a little toe hole that a whole kinds of things Jesus comes and cuts it all he says this belongs to me I'll take all the hooks out of them I mean they have no claim I meant how glad it is we had a man our Lord Jesus many prophets have done incredible things but he's the only one who see it I lay my life down I'll pick it back up again I lay my life down I'll put him back up again and he picked us life back up again hallelujah he came out of the tomb and then but then they came now 2,000 years but now now came a time and maybe I'm jumping here to myself but he but he becomes a time in the book of Revelation when he's a sealed title deed to the earth the book of redemption in the right hand of the original creator and there's a and the strong angel says hurts worthy to take the book and John was weeping because he saw no man was found to be worthy Allu you and he wept much because in you unless a man was found they could take this title deed to the earth I mean all of creation was lost hallelujah and then he wept much and and and John was the one that laid on Jesus bosom he was the Beloved Disciple and he was weeping because he couldn't see Jesus and then one of the elders here's weep not John it's okay there's a man holy is a man that's been found worthy is the man that's been found worthy to step on your behalf when you could not be redeemed there was one who could redeem you and then he saw the Lamb coming forth out of eternity hallelujah and he was found worthy he took the book hallelujah said this is now my possession hallelujah because you're part of that book I mean you plant your names are in the book hallelujah and he looses the seals and now he says I'm going to tell you what your inheritance says hallelujah amen if there was not a man worthy found not a man worthy to take that book of title I mean we would still be stuck and time would continue to go on but there was a man hallelujah his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he was found worthy it's covered in his own blood he had wrestled he prevailed hallelujah amen and he's doing all this doing all this because he wants his body hallelujah I mean it's like you see the cloud on Sunset Mountain that's the hedgy you know Jesus told brother Brent in the picture to the right it's the hoffmans head of Christ right there it's the head that's looking for the body he following me it's the head chippers here the Prophet says headship is here more than a cloud Christ himself hallelujah we're not a headless body I mean we're not a headless body a ministry is coming this in time to unite Christ and the people together I mean just like John the Baptist he pointed out the Lamb of God to the people hallelujah that was his ministry I'm going to introduce you people to the lamb and then he comes as seeking cuz enough to the flesh he says behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and he introduced Jesus Christ to the people I mean he says I must decrease he must increase Kolia cuz he was it introduced a many said I'm the friend of the bridegroom hallelujah I'm here to conduct the wedding hallelujah amen you know you know if a man and a woman are married legally Amen you could say they're each other's property amen it's just like my wife no other man has claims on her and no other woman has claims on me by cerveza she belongs to me I belong to her hallelujah amen legally letter so hallelujah and you just times that by 10 billion billions and that's how our Lord Jesus is I mean my my bride is mine and I am hers and and nothing else is allowed to touch her I mean give her a run belief to file her anyway because legally I've purchased her redemption I mean I'm going to force that redemption Holly that where I am she is all sorry hallelujah we have a lot to be thankful for I mean I don't belong to the devil I trust you've come to that realization to I'm not the devil's property I'm the Lord Jesus amen I'm his and he is mine hallelujah hallelujah he sees this Christ says from Christ a mystery God reveals he sees but she the bride is identified by him has he identified you as yet supernaturally identified you I mean because it's one thing I want to be identified with him just like we're going to take the communion here this is us giving a public testimony I've become one with my lamb I meant but it's one thing to identify yourself with him but when he comes identifies himself with you that's what counts when he receives your faith hallelujah that's the main thing hallelujah amen I'd be rejoicing I mean if he's received your faith if he's identified if he looks at you and says I'm proud to be identified with these people I'm proud to say I'm one of them colorful ouya I mean our Lord is not ashamed of us he's proud this is my bride hallelujah he actually shows you off there's like joke Satan comes up before God and of course God knows where he is but God always comes down to everyone's level and so God says to Satan where have you been he says I've been walking to and fro and now God send me a say I want to show off one of my children have you considered my servant job he's perfect man he's a perfect man there's no one like him at all the earth and and no doubt Satan's kind of scratching his head because he probably seen joke he thought well there's nothing too special about him he's like anyone else but that's got that Satan looking I mean but when God looks down when he when he looked down at Jobe a man under the blood of bulls and goats he's a perfect man there is none like him see he's showing showing off job to the devil this man's incredible holier he loves me I mean in spite of everything amen and then and then you know the devil say I'm God does the same thing with you have you considered my little bride there was no one like her Amen in all ages there's never been a people like this people will all be in heaven you understand me but this is the darkest age this is the most deceptive age this is the most religious age I mean there's millions of voices upon the earth you could spend million I don't know how many lifetimes on YouTube trying to find the truth and good luck trying to go through all that myriad of opinion it's the most deceptive age but yet God put you in this age and he's telling Satan look here's my bride here's my elected ones that I've been waiting for to manifest me and my fullness hallelujah we're a a people that we made in my image hallelujah he tells he tell Satan about you hallelujah oh because he as God is proud of you we may not think too much about ourselves we're gonna change our thinking Lord what do you think of me what do you think about me what is your word say not God doesn't have an opinion here's his word because opinions can change based on circumstance but God has his word and he declares his word and that's it that's his full thought and it's not a partial thought that changes is his full thought so he sees you that you'll fully manifest as were in the sour that you will be his body and here's your head holy if that's how he thought of you that's how it's going to be hallelujah amen is identified by him she's independent from all others keep thee only unto her as long as you both shall live I'm sorry I'm back to this quote here keep the only to him the word no no adultery no sign of denomination no sign of creed no sign of adultery at all the word and him alone I'm Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds of Sinking Sands said Eddie I'm said any opponent that's at Christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone his property alone he has redeemed by she sorry is redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone that's right then what the devil's howling about is that it's being revealed the devil hates it when he is exposed and when a people's eyes come open and they begin to realize I don't have to be under this bondage of sin I don't have to be maybe I'll obtain and I'll get beaten back down again I mean that I'll try and maybe read you know people as I said the beginning people try and reform themselves and change their behavior to try and overcome but then God sends this message opens your eyes and he gives you a faith in your soul weak and stand up I mean you can take God at His Word hallelujah gives you over in power and it's him doing it hallelujah Amen Oh trust I can speak myself spending of many a time trying to overcome something in my own flesh holier but then I met the master how did I met the Lord Jesus Christ and I didn't have to try and overcome it anymore he did it for me hallelujah I know this gospel works friends this message produces Jesus Christ and a people I know because I've experienced it Alleluia amen identified oh the devil's howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word and her alone they don't have the answer then Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees he said if you cast out Devils by the finger of God who do you cast them out by sea he stood alone and his church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body during the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days he's talking about me now remember you say well I could never obtain to that kind of way and think hey you're looking at yourself if the mirror is turned to you you will be disappointed but if you turn the mirror and keep it focused on here and you look at him remember this word should never you know this word is not a textbook this is a love leader and when we read is not Lord I want to learn it it's Lord changed my character as I read it that I become like you that's how we should read the Bible that's how we should listen to the message as Lord changed my character by your spirit there when it's all said and done I'll be made in your image I'm glad I'm his workmanship on you I'm glad he's the master sculptor hallelujah he knows how to do a good job hallelujah amen no she is his body the manifested truth of the promised word for the last days she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil's howling these great organizations to set up something too hurry up don't ever do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power the vindicated promise word to her amen she won't be closed up she'll be taken up that's why I say we don't need to be worried about all the churches going to be closed and all these things that we haven't we're gonna be taken up over this just blasted force then be taken home prayerfully of course you understand you know you don't just go machine gun everyone but you go by prayer say Lord I want to find the last one they may be in Stokes Valley I mean there may be an Auckland they may be wherever that you know you they may be in Machu Acre you never know they may be your next-door neighbor who knows but prayerfully saying Lord find them he wants to find the more than you do hallelujah do you think he is satisfied being separated from part of himself amen do you think he's happy that part of himself has bribed the one he loves he's actually separate he knows where they are he knows when they're going to come in but he's not a robot that's just in heaven and no emotion and no desire and no longing and you know it's not just a robot this emotionless he has a burden he has a longing you think we want to go into rapture he wants to take us interruption more than we want to go I mean you think we want the plan of redemption to be sealed up and done what do you think he's been like for thousands of years even even before time began to give this great plan as thoughts of redemption everything he's going to express to her people in his mind and he's waiting and he slowly it's unfolding through time he's excited I mean you think we'll be excited that day I think he's going to be excited here's the ones I'm not separated amen sure he's with us he's in us and with us to the end of the world we understand it but they still did it's not quite you know because we're in these bodies you understand so he's waiting he's going to be excited when these bodies have changed and then and then when he says that you know in the book of Revelation it says it has finished or it is done hallelujah I believe he's looking forward to those words to be manifested I mean where it's no longer a prophecy but it's manifested

wrap this up but you look at the you you look at the disciples during the first resurrection none of them were saying hallelujah none of them were screaming and shouting saying there goes my lamb up Calvary none of them were rejoicing they didn't know he told them what was going to happen I'm gonna be giving it to the hands of wicked men and I'm gonna be killed three days he'll be raised again

going to be washed away hallelujah they win rejoicing they were broken they were broken to turn the way to Emmaus they weren't skipping isn't it a wonderful day to be a believer hallelujah I'm so glad I can say I'm one of him they weren't singing those things they were the whole world had fallen apart they had to forsake all there was pressure in Israel he couldn't just leave the synagogue and follow this Jesus of Nazareth I mean ecumenical council put out a put out a declaration if any man goes to his meetings I'll be kicked out of the synagogue that's what the Sanhedrin said there was a real reproach for following this man of you know this man of Galilee and these people who suck all they're willing to bear their approach to follow this one and they followed him and they saw him cast out Devils speak to the storm and obeyed him death gave up her dead Lazarus was for four days in the grave begin to decay but corruption UITs master when when a man that wasn't - you know maybe too big in stature said Lazarus come forth and the prophet said that if he didn't say Lazarus it would have been a general resurrection cutler because i am the resurrection the life he says and the man is buddy who was big into the cake he came back to life again he came there but he came out of the tomb they'd never seen such things but now the Romans had taken him and he was now hanging on a cross and his body was now in a tomb they weren't rejoicing they weren't happy about it their whole life their whole world adjust for where can they go now where can they go they've been made outcasts by their own choosing to follow this one that they love and now he was dead the the disciples had sealed them up in a place and the treasurer you know Judas had had committed suicide so they weren't and they're walking on the way to Emmaus the whole world how do you think they felt how are you today Cleopas sin and your friend are you rejoicing how can I be rejoicing have you seen what's been going on don't you know what's happening and Jesus comes walks with them in another form he withholds who he is and he's been six hours opening the word to them then find they go into the house he breaks the bread their eyes come over and I see it's him now before that they were broken brother brand preacher Suman maunder beans made clear by the prophecy and he reached the - on the way to Emmaus and he says these modern events are made clear that's a prophecy Luke 24 is the prophecy and these modern events here and make clear by that prophecy how will the believers back then they were broken that didn't make them miss the resurrection that's what I'm trying to say it doesn't matter what state you find yourself in if you're on cloud nine or if you're down in the deepest pit you've been in your entire life that doesn't matter I mean out down in a pit they were broken but Jesus himself walked with them to make sure that they knew you're part of this resurrection partly because they had to be in the upper room I mean they had to be part of this resurrection hallelujah so Jesus went with them he didn't find the disciples that were happy or maybe you know the disciples that would think well if he's going to walk with me and and walk like that he's going to choose me because I'm the best and I perform the best and look at I've got I've got the best spiritual like he didn't go to those phones he went to the broken ones there's a say irrespective of where you find yourself that's irrelevant I mean he is here to ensure why this message come your way why did it come your way because he wanted you to know your polish resurrection I mean you're part of that redeemed group how are you part of my body that's why this message can you away amen this is not to make another Church to have a group of people different kind of doctor no it's a resurrection cold hallelujah brother says the bridegroom Court will come right through this it is the end of the man end of his ministry said the move is on for the bride is thus saith the Lord he says and this message is gone around the world I mean to find that bride redeem that bride cut all ties of Satan off that bride lift that bride up in the heavenly places hallelujah that's wonderful isn't it he say well I'm going through some bad things don't worry about what you're going through what's he quicken to your soul a man you say well how could I manifest the word from my out have you received it has it changed you Amen have it's changed if you've received it as change you you're manifesting it Amen we don't I'm not interested in my my own stats of my performance that doesn't mean you just watch the world go by and sit back but it's not my performance that matters it's being faithful to what he's revealed right amen and each revealed the whole counsel of God in these last days now the bride manifests the fullness of his word in this hour now we're gonna turn turn the service a bit now because this is incredible our to be alive I don't belong to the devil that simple thought makes me shout hallelujah I don't belong to nothing but him here's my head I'm his body hallelujah I'm free I'm free in Christ holy o my Lord Jesus redeemed me hallelujah Amen that gives me cause to shout because when he I mean when when the dead in Christ rise and uh and we which are alive and remain amen are you remaining in this message and this truth hallelujah amen you can't stop but your body will be changed with this I mean and then when that happens he'll make sure I know it's going on I've received a shout already the first part of it hallelujah and that chat is manifested now in me hallelujah sigh don't need to worry I mean he'll make me know I mean Here I am and there's nothing holding me I mean we're when we're caught up together to meet them to meet him in the air with them I have to go this there's no hooks I have no anchor types of my homeland is no weights I have to go hallelujah amen they should give us an to be happy about Alleluia now such a glorious time but now when we come to thee come to the communion jesus says let's go to John chapter six real quick [Music] I know this is familiar but I always this is special he's a lord sent and we'll read it ladies do this in remembrance of me we're remembering the Lord the Lord did incredible things for us incredible things it wasn't the you know just the physical beatings in the and the crown of thorns and the and marred beyond any man that's incredible but by carrying the weight of the sin of the world you remember when your sin weight became real do you remember that day and it felt like such a burdensome thing how could I be free hallelujah he didn't just take y'all I mean your own he took all of humanity that there ever will be he took all of us said no there's about 7 billion people on the earth now and I don't know how many have been before that's a lot of sin and he packed all that on his shoulders and he carried it as a man I've come over here that day that's amazing yeah so he says in John 6 and and 53 this is then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the flesh of the Son of man drink his blood you have no life in you who saw it whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and I did that he that eateth of this bread shall live forever now we understand he's not literally saying eating my physical body and drink my physical blood there's not really saying be saying if you become one with me just like in the Old Testament with the Passover their lamb that was slain to save the firstborn from the Death Angel they had to become one with that lamb I mean there was a time when there was the lamb and there was the people then that slam the blood was prone the door and lintel and they roasted the whole lamb with bitter herbs and they had to become one with their sacrifice I mean they had to become one with that lamb and this is what Jesus saying you must become one with me amen and we know by be to become one with him as when you he comes and dwells in you the Holy Ghost comes and dwells in the believer they become one amen so now this as the Catholics would say they say a prayer and it literally turns into his body and literally into his blood that is not true but that's what they believe this is just symbols of his body and his blood it's just symbolic right it doesn't literally turn into us into his flesh and his blood like they believe it's merely symbolic but by coming up and partaking of the Lord's table you are giving a public testimony that he is your head I mean and here's the word right not just part of him his whole word is now your headship amen and you are his body because you become one with him this is what you are making a declaration of right so this is why it's a joyous thing because I'm free just you are too but then it's also and we'll read it soon but it's also a very serious thing a sacred moment because you're you're actually declaring Lord all of your work all you workers Jesus is his word right in order for Jesus to be your head his whole word you have to subject yourself to him I meant not to your opinion not to man's ideas but to his word and as whole word as we manifested in the self that's why we're not living by opinion and a whole bunch of Bible School PhDs ll these DEA DS that they've got on walls amen and it edits everyone opinion to say well this is what it means no God came and said this is what my Bible says I am the author of my word I'm going to tell you what it says and he's told us what his word says hallelujah so we don't have to guess about anything in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mystery of God would be finished it's been finished it's been revealed right so now when we come and partake of the Lord's table now we are saying he is my head I am his body by his sacrifice we've become one because he now dwells in me he's identified himself with me Amen they stirred the first Corinthians chapter 11 I'm gonna read from verse 23 he says for I have received of the Lord there which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me before as oft as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come members coming finishes when we meet him in the air ok wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself let him examine himself Lord are you my head am I your body this is the examination do I have to make something right with someone amen this is something I need to put right this is the examining and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world isn't it glorious isn't it wonderful when the Lord puts a finger on a part of your life so you've got to get this right he's not just telling you you know to make you feel bad he's showing you that you can be free of that thing I mean it's a glorious thing when the Lord puts something puts a finger on your life Amen that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you may come together under condemnation and the rest I will sit in order when I come so we've come to do this and remembrance of him so I said he's done a lot for us but now we're going to just change the order of service and ask brother could been to come forward going to help me to to minister the bread and the wine but I just before you come talk to the Lord search your heart say Lord we're instructed to examine ourselves I don't want to drink the wine or take the bread and worthily I meant and he said Lord I want you to be my head amen brother Brown had a person had a teenage girl she was back in the prayer alone and she started smoking cigarettes this is how quickly it takes to put things right and then about four people in front of her and the prayer line was a man that was smoking and the Spirit of God through the Prophet discerned that he was a smoker and and other things about his life and then sir the girl the teenage girl who's four people behind him in the prayer line didn't realize smoking was wrong and she prayed in her heart Lord forgive me I never want to smoke again please forgive me of doing it and then when she came up before the prophet of the Lord that wasn't even called out crews from there to here she put it under the blood it doesn't take a long time sincerely from the heart Lord forgive me changed me amen that's how easy it is we try and complicate things but you got to examine yourself and say Lord is there anything and he'll tell you if you're really sincere he will actually tell you you don't need to guess he's not the author of confusion right so now
