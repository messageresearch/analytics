good friend of mine we've been in the North karikari in the Pacific Asia Convention and where Andy - we've been together in Israel in Jerusalem on a tour for like two weeks so I love the family of God and it's good to see you all again you may be seated for a while and for those who don't know me I'm brother on my label from the Philippines so I came from I come from Manila I have four children two daughters and two boys and eldest is married and I've got a grandson who's eight years old I'm 56 years old and I've been fostering for 25 years since 1994 I came to the message in 1987 I was a Catholic before and the Lord was merciful and he wrote my name in the Lamb's Book of Life and came to look for me amen so it's not us coming to God it's because Jesus said to the Apostles you have not chosen me but I have chosen you so the bride is one in a million I believe you're one of them a man and you're so blessed you know that God will you know hide the truth from the wise and the prudent if you need it from the parros's and Sadducees and reveal it a very few as it was in the days of Jesus so shall it be in the Sun in the coming of the Son of Man second time so we're so happy to see you again and I've been in Christchurch the last eight days we had an outreach we had seminars I conducted a mystery Bible Expo seminars for some Filipinos my you know countrymen in there working in the farm where they milk the cow and you know get the wool from the Sheep so it's been a blessed time with brother pastor Greg Alford of you know kaya boy so he's been in the Philippines - four twice already I've invited him to our camp meeting and spoke there so tonight we will go to the word because I believe that important thing is the word amen because heaven and earth shall pass away but his word will never pass away but before I do that probably I'll I'll do a special song for you I've been in the band before playing I play the drums I play electric guitar too and I was in the world before playing for you know foreign for the people in the nightclub but you know by God's grace that God called me out from smoking from you know wine and everything and I've been born again and that's by God's grace amen we have done nothing it's all by the grace of God so maybe I'll borrow one of the acoustics and uh can you flash brother the song he brought me out from the miry clay I just want to sing that song because I believe it's the story of my life yeah peace you flash the screen on the screen the lyric [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my heart was distressed Nietzsche robots red brown and low in the beat were my scenes drag me down I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay who tenderly brought me out to God then day he brought me the miry Flay he's at

to say but satsang in my soul today a song of praise hallelujah [Applause] [Music] god bless you praise the Lord Amen so thank you brother so probably I'll invite you to stand for the reading of the word amen we will be reading from I believe it's Peter is the Lord and you put it by Randy okay thank you very much we'll read 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 10 and it says here we're for the rather bredrin give diligence to make your calling and election sure or if you do these things ye shall never fall amen this one verse let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come to you tonight knowing Lord that without you we can do nothing Lord we invite you once again in the power of your Holy Spirit to reveal these words to us Lord God that we may be able to walk Lord God worthy of your calling in the last days to make our election sure Lord God because if we don't know who we are where we came from where we're going Lord we're walking blindly Lord God but thanks be to God Lord thanks for the messenger of the last age father that you brought out the Elijah of Malachi 4 Lord to rebuild to us to bring to us the light the mysteries hidden in the Bible Lord God that we may be able Lord God to see ourselves before the foundation of the world where we came from Lord and that our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life and Lord the prophets said you are obligated to find us because you redeem us we were we were your properties Lord God and it's not because of about works what we've done but because of your mercy Lord so we thank you tonight father that you have assembled your Saints once again under the blood of Jesus Christ that we may receive from You Lord healing we may receive Lord God's salvation and deliverance we may receive a blessing as sure salvation Lord God encouragement and strenght Lord in our journey on this earth Thank You Lord bless your people forgive us of our sins in iniquity and may you bless this church bless the pastor our being and his son congregation Lord God and all praises be until you get the glory for yourself tonight Lord this we pray in Jesus name and the bride says amen and amen you may be seated god bless you so we want to call this subject tonight as how to become a successful Christian amen so anybody cans can claim that he's a Christian you know you can bring your Bible you can say you can probably memorize scriptures in verses but how truly are we successful in you know bringing the light of the world because the Bible says you are the salt of the earth that's the fruit of the Spirit follow you see in this code bertram said remember now remember that each one of you from tonight on remember you are God's billboards see he said in you're God's advertising agent the world will look at you to see what Christ is so we've got to attract the world to Christ and the Bible said we represent him we are ambassadors of Jesus Christ we are the Word made flesh again the bride you know we are we are flesh of his flesh we are bone of his bone in the absence of the Sun the moon will shine and the moon symbolizes the church because we don't have our own light we just reflect the light of Jesus Christ and Jesus said in John 14:12 the works that I do you shall do also an even greater work you shall do because I go to my father let's continue with a call he said we are Christ's billboard and Christ is our sponsor oh praise God the Lord of Heaven and Earth is your sponsor see all the power and authority is behind you amen jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you shall cast out devil in my name you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so thus these things follow us today it should because that's God's promise he said for this sponsorship is by Christ were not sponsored by the Baptist or Methodist or by the Catholic Jesus Christ is your sponsor the Lord of Heaven coming down in flesh dying at the cross of Calvary who she to shed his blood to save us because remember the father could not save you he's a spirit you cannot crucify a spirit he has to share the blood his own blood because in Hebrews 9:22 it says for without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin so Jesus has to come and die and he said it is expedient that I go away because if I don't go away the comforter will not come to you and then he told the disciples story in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so power is not wealth is not money isn't a popularity power is when the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you become the manifestation of Jesus Christ in our day hey man so for this sponsorship it says is by Christ and he is giving us our life to sponsor him also so lob should be two-way right love must be mused mute well and Jesus said if you love me obey my Commandments Amen we cannot question his love he will really prove his love to us by dying at the cross so how can we prove our love to him the Prophet said by you know by thanking him by showing him our appreciation she we do good works not to to be safer already saved but we do good works in appreciation for the love that he has shown us glory to God let's move on with the quotation here see it says he gives us salvation he gives us our healing remember in the Bible said that in Psalms I believe he the Lord said I am the Lord heal it all die this and I am the lord that forgiveth all thine iniquities so it's not the doctors nor medicines that heal you it's God Himself who can reproduce cells tissues organs of the body medicine is only an aid no doctor will say that he can heal you a may they only assist nature but only God can heal you the Bible said by His stripes you were healed amen he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes we are healed we are saved the Prophet said he gives us our health and strength see our health where do you get your strength where do you get your food something has to die in order for you to to be alive you know the chicken dies the beep the cow dies you know the vegetable dyes the rice dies no so but there's one of the Cross who died amen for your soul salvation amen the soul is more important than the body because the body will go back to ashes but you have an eternal soul that soul has to thirst the Bible said blessed are they that thirst it and hunger it for they shall be filled Haman David said Lord as the deer panted after the water group so does my soul thirst after the O God we must have a thirst for God because he gives us food he gives us our homes see it says we are sponsored by Christ and Pentecostals Pentecostal people we believe in Pentecost you know Pentecost it's not a denomination real Pentecost is an experience being born again and he said Pentecostal people who's filled with the Holy Ghost is sponsors of Jesus Christ they have been sponsored by Jesus Christ and given the Holy Ghost to be an example to the people so that's the way we Christians ought to be remember the Bible said in acts 2:38 the prescription that that Peter gave us repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ every one of you pour what for the remission of sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Jesus said we must be baptized in water and in spirit except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so that's all we be we should be baptized because you cannot even witness without the Holy Ghost remember jesus said when the Holy Spirit come upon you you shall be my witnesses and to Jerusalem and to Judea and to all the world so burn burn I'm said here the world is hungry today to see love demonstrated you know the capstone is love see we must have the capstone which is divine love he said they don't want so to see so much action so much clapping hands then things are all right now I'm not discrediting them I'm just trying to put them in their places they don't want to hear you speak in tongues to prove you've got the Holy Ghost or interpret to get it the Holy Spirit they want to see what the love that you've got to display see Christians are love slaves to Jesus Christ remember Paul what did Paul say I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ see so that's what the world is one thing is love so if you don't have love even if you claim to be a Christian even if you speak in tongues see in 1st Corinthians chapter 13 didn't Paul said even if I can have the faith to move mountains though I can speak with men in anger angel though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice but you know if I don't have blood I am nothing we're tinkling cymbals so that's what the world wants and Jesus we know God is love and we must display these things to the world let's continue with some or prerequisites in order to be a successful Christian we must have two things first see one of them is vision the second one is passion a man and vision is defined by the dictionary as a long-term commitment or a calling or two a calling or goal so being a Christian will not stop when you you you don't want to serve him anymore you know the Bible said if you put your your your hand on the plow you have not to turn back again amen when you start to serve Jesus this has been you know through eternity amen we must not be hampered or hindered by any situations in life amen because the Bible said without a vision for were there is no vision the people perish that's in Proverbs 29:18 but he that keepeth the law hapc see vision CS the determination and the will to never give up amen in the Bible it says lay aside every weight Amen anything that hinders you and the scene you know unbelief which that so easily beset us and let us run that just walk but run this race with patience amen looking unto who looking unto Jesus Amen don't look at the pastor's mistake don't look at your brother's witnesses look only unto Jesus the author and finisher of your faith in him in him there's no no weakness amen no imperfection so every one of us is under the blood trying to work nobody's perfect yet but when the body changed the rapture comes we will have an immortal body amen a body an incorruptible body never to get sick never to feel pain never to die amen to a young body just like Jesus own body when he resurrected so we need vision amen so that's hebrews 12:1 and 2 and then passion you need passion passion is the powerful compelling desire to serve the Lord you must have that desire Amen because God doesn't want to force people to serve him no see we don't force people to serve God it has to be a voluntary you know a service you know that comes from the heart not as a duty or obligation just to come to church on Wednesday it has to be you him and if there's nobody come I will come because it's a personal revelation a personal affair individual calling Amen the rapture will you know will not be a group rupture the Bible said two in the bed one will be taken one will be left to in the field one will be taken one will be left probably husband and wife and one is an unbeliever the other is a believer so we must be ready anytime because the Lord will come like a thief in the night and take us home amen one of these days hallelujah so we're reading Colossians 3:23 and whatsoever you do do it heartily even not intellectually hard to live as to the Lord and not unto men so when you serve your boss do it unto the Lord not unto them unto man whatever you do in word or in deed do it for the glory of God amen so passion is also perseverance persistence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling that's the real Christian amen you know Bertram said to love God is not a duty it's a it's a lab that serves Christ it's strange you it constrains you until every pulsation of you heart beat with him a man that's Juanes that's unity a man with Jesus whatever he likes you also like whatever he doesn't like you also dislike Amen do God's will Amen so here we see in mark 12 what does it say verse 30 31 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all not just part with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength that is the first commandment and the second is thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself your only third verse is God the second is your neighbor and you're the third one so that's how we must love one another know the Bible said praise the Lord Amen for ver one another forgiving one another praise the Lord so here here are four marks of a committed person if you're a really committed Christian T you will not have excuses remember in the Bible the Lord invited people for the wedding supper OB son and they have excuses see one said oh I just got married and I have my honeymoon see the other one said I bought some property he I bought some land and I wanted I bought some cows so you know God won't accept excuses he never made excuses and said oh I won't I won't be at that cross you know you know that would hurt my hand in my feet he never made excuses for us Priska he moved on because it was you in his mind it was not the nails that held him at the cross it was you because we were on his mind your salvation amen committed people refused all destruction see if you have a job like on a Sunday morning and it in tells you to go so find another job praise the Lord so put him first and God will bless you committed people have passion and dedication and committed people are all they always find a way serve god no matter what the weather is amen no matter if you're you have no money to pay the boss or whatever you have to save you know make away you know for God to serve Him amen show him that you're interested hey man so sometimes in the age of blood is here everything is you know it's easy everything in our age is just push-button and still people you know get lazy to come to church when in the old days they would ride you know mountains they will cross the sea to attend church on a Sunday so that's why God hates low this year he said you said you you're rich and have need of nothing but I say your blood naked miserable poor wretched and don't know it oh my that's a race but thank me to God we were taken out of blood this year the bride out of laude sia hot prevail amen glory to God Birmingham said it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance can we say whether it's hot cold indifferent whether the people are fussing growling whatever they're doing it's still a joy to hear the word of the Lord then you're in love with Christ you love to go to church hey man we did that come here for anyone you did not come here for brother beam you came here for Christ amen the pastor is just a a a a servant of God you know the pattern is Paul said I planted Apollo's watered but it's God that giveth the increase amen so the real believer don't hear nothing but the word that's in the message three kinds of believers see that's all he watches the word he ain't looking for loopholes he ain't looking for no gimmicks he believes God and that settles it and he just keeps going on going on there's the real believer amen you must have the same attitude in character see rich guy let's read some more in Matthew 10:37 t God ought to be more important than your mother and father and son and daughter jesus said this is the words of Jesus he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross this is another littler cross you know it's your trials the sufferings that God allow he you must take your cross and follow after him if you don't you are not worthy of me Jesus said and then in another scripture Luke 14 27 and 33 whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple we have a cross to carry you know each one of us we have problems in life we have trials Christianity is not a bed of roses you know every all that we live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution suffering is part of a Christian if our Lord suffered and he learned obedience through suffering Thomas More are we he says so likewise whosoever he be o buted forsake it not all that he had he cannot be my disciple that's the criteria he must be first love God more than your wife husband children you let nothing hinder you new trials your feelings remember those children of Israel never crossed the promised land they crossed the Red Sea they were given a prophet they ate from the manna from heaven they eat from the water that came from the rock but they murmured they complain against Moses so they all perish in the wilderness only two went into the Promised Land that's Joseph Wayne Khalid two in a million two million came out and only two went in from the original because the new generation that were born in the wilderness went with Jose Wayne Colin and they they even you know circumcised them before crossing so see we see a lot of young people and in some churches there are a few old people why because the new generation you know is picking up this message you know they're they're catching up with the older generation so I just believe for us that we will be all there no T because each one of us is responsible we are answerable for our own amen so let's let's press on and fight a good fight of faith here let's look at some quotations from the message possessing the enemy God brings tensions into the church for every son that cometh to God must be tried proven and tested listen he let's sickness strikes you he lets diseases come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will remember job job was a believer but he got sick he got you know all those boils in his body but it was not because he was a sinner it was a trial just to show Satan that my my son job no matter what you do to him he will never forsake me see sometimes God wants Satan to see that also in you that's why he allows some sickness diseases look at some of the codes here it says he permits disasters probably accidents earthquakes you know things like that typhoons see he permits the friends to turn against you amen he he and and permits the devil lose to tempt you and he will do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church even against you and he can do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it we are taught that God is that that it's more our fate is more precious than gold so Satan is just following God you know Satan God uses Satan sometimes to perfect us brother even said how I think Satan because if there's no trial in no suffering I could not you know overcome see Satan has to get permission from God he can never touch you dislike job just like the Hebrew children he just like Daniel in the lion's den so we can go all trees these trials but if your predestinated see everything will work out for the good of them that love God is for your good that he does it okay let's continue the Bible said that Jesus himself who is the author and finisher of our faith for the joy that was set before him endured the cross he despised the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God amen and you can see that in Philippians 2:6 teachers who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal to God but made himself of no reputation see he took upon him the form of a servant made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so it entail obedience the Bible said sacrifice or obedience is better than sacrifice he that's what God wants to find amongst Christians see Jesus persevered here in the Bible he was abused MA Club slaps beatings cords he chose the nails he chose to die for our sins see he was when he was in the cross on the cross he was you and I were on his mind remember that Jesus he doesn't have to do it see but it was a very important job he did not send an angel for a prophet to he came down himself that just goes to show that your soul the Prophet said one soul is worth ten thousand words see and only Jesus got himself becoming man can redeem us from the curse of the law so we thank God for that what we must do is return the favor amen he Paul said you did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth now let me read this code from here you him where Birnam said christians are not cowards see they believe God they stand on what he says you've got to be brave and stand right up to be believe him take and trust in his word God don't want cowards God wants men that's brave he cannot use a coward and are afraid to testify of your healing afraid to tell your neighbor your boss what God has done to you or give praise to Christ a shame to speak up in the hour when the trial comes and you're afraid to say that you're a Christian God cannot use you God cannot use cowards when you believe God you've got to believe him with all that is in you aim and believe God and trust in him because I believe that he promised that he will never leave you nor forsake you until the end of time he promised to supply all your need according to his riches in glory that's the kind of God we serve he told Moses be still and know that I am God praise God he could open the Red Sea he could raise up the dead he knows what you're thinking right now he knows what you're going on he knows your problems t so all you have to do is surrender to Him the Bible said it says a god carrot cast your cares upon him for he carried for you that's what the Bible said so now let's read some more Satan will try to stop you of course Satan you know his his spirit he can use your mind he can bring fear he can bring doubt he can bring hatred you know just about anything to stumble you amen to to bring you away from Christ but you know if you have been knocked out and have currently been stumbled your goal is you must rise up again see don't be out of focus see we need to you know stand up again and fight a good fight of faith the Bible said if we confess our sins he is just and faithful to forgive you of your sins just like the prodigal son you know the father was always there waiting for him while he was in sin but the father had prepared a banquet he prepared a ring he prepared hey you know what we call a form of a you know clothing suited for a prince that's why his elder brother and Oh got jealous praise God so God is always waiting for us whenever we fall he's there to help you don't ever think that God hates you because he loves you he gave his life for you it's just Satan that's telling you because of sin sin separate us from God amen now the Bible said we must be zealous to repent see revive your first love in the in the church age of Ephesus God is one complaint you have left your first love and your first love is not your right brother Ben Jesus is our first love is that right a man not your boyfriend or your girlfriend T so it's an individual walk with God and Joseph ah even told the Israelites choose you this day whom you will serve the gods of the AMA writes you know the Hittites the malachite but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen that's the right declare declaration that's the statement of a Christian no matter what happens I will serve the Lord amen so set your priorities right because God will bless you the Bible said seek ye first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things material financial blessing spiritual whatever it is they shall be added unto you amen do we believe amen so in John 15:7 jesus said if you abide in me that if is a conditional word if it's a condition if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then what ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so but if you're not abiding in Christ you cannot expect that your prayers will be answered because that's the condition you must live according to the world see acknowledge God in all your ways and he will direct thy paths the Bible said see brother Branham said a man this born of the Spirit of God loves to go to church better than he loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry is the truth is that true see God first before dinner amen the spiritual man on the inside has got to be fed if that man isn't fed he will die the outward man isn't fed he will die and so will the inward man it's got to be fed on TV people usually eat five times a day three times but how about your soul see so you must give more importance to that soul of yours because this body will die but the soul will never die in either's go to the souls in prison the speak dimension or you go you're pure theophany on the sixth dimension and when the rapture takes place that here funny will come down to pick up the redeemed body and meet the Lord up in the air and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds that's our hope that's the greatest event that we're looking for it's not a soccer football or boxing game that were the greatest event that coming of the Lord physically corporally he will come he has already appeared 1963 in that headship the cloud but you know in Acts chapter 1 verse 8 I believe verse 9 see Jesus he has ended up and there was a cloud you know that the you know that that met him and we saw that cloud now and soon the real body will come to pick us up in the air amen so you need a home church here's the code discernment he said every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithe and somewhere you help support the cause P and we're given a free choice see the next word is take your choice e but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group see discern his spirit if he's got the same spirit in heart then you got fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of price I think that is absolutely true so we cannot just stay home you know on Sunday have a home church brother branham said because even an evangelist has had to have a home church an apostle a teacher has to have a pass or even rather ran on the Prophet he subjected himself to brother Neville he said burnable our pastor see we have to have church order amen don't stay alone and claim to be you know a minister without a home church amen we must have a pastor because a pastor is the head of the local assembly amen so that's what the Bible tells us in in I believe in Timothy so but you cannot have vision and passion without revelation see revelation is the one that will quicken you so with the revelation the wine stimulation of the revelation the why we call is hurt not the oil and the wine see without that see we will just be nominal Christians see that's why the denominations today they have entertainment they have strobe lights near the pulpit and dancing and you know people are you know cracking jokes on the pulpit because people they have no revelation and even the pastor they don't have the relation they just preach from a past message of you know Luther Wesley but we have a fresh matter for our age amen where the carcass is there the Eagles will gather in a Bible and the Eagles eat fresh meat amen you know in the for creatures only the Eagle eat fresh meat the lion the ox the man they drink milk when they are little but the eagle eats the meat immediately after birth and that's what we are we heard the voice of our Jehovah eagle amen and we have been taken out of the denominational barnyard of the chickens you know the story hallelujah and that's why you know Peter you know Jesus asked the disciples who do men say that I am in John chapters 13 I believe he said uh although they call you probably your Jeremiah or you were one of the prophets or you're John the Baptist that rose again t but who do you say that I am Jesus had asked a personal question and Peter volunteered Lord thou art the Christ though art the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed are you Peter Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood no man no seminary has rebuilt easel to you but my heavenly father has revealed it unto you and upon this rock of Revelation the rock of Revelation that my other has given you I will build my church and the gates of Hell can never prevail against you so we must have that rock of Revelation you must know your messenger for the age that you're living Burnham said the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to receive the message in the day in which you're living in so and then be born again through that message and be filled with the Holy Spirit and bring forth the food fruits of the Holy Spirit in Galatians 5:22 you will have love joy peace long-suffering gentleness meekness it will flow through her a true Christian in our age amen praise God so now let's read a coach he said here it must be a divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you that just came out of the heart the intellectual faith is not enough even if you read a Bible daily memorized Scriptures the Bible says the letter killeth but it's the spirit that giveth life we need a revelation of the Spirit and he said the Holy Spirit is a personal experience of the bird the new bird regeneration making a new creature in Christ he will know the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth not just partial truth because denominations they have partial truth they have father son Holy Ghost in baptism they thought there are three persons in the Trinity or in the Godhead see they still believe that it was an apple that caused man to fall the fall you know so there's no revelation in there but blessed be your eyes because God has given us the ice sound you know that we can see there are the true revelation for our aids amen so the new birth is a revelation we'll be closing the new birth he said is a revelation God has revealed this to you to you this great mystery and that is the new bird P it's Christ the revelation when Christ is revealed to you that's the new birth because the new birth is composed of three stages justification sanctification and the same of the holy ghost that right you have to complete all three because the natural birth is composed of water blood and then live spirit same thing in the in the spiritual you have to be you know baptized in water justified by faith believing and then you have to be sanctified by the blood of Jesus and then the Holy Spirit the fire of God has to burn that sin out of you and you become the temple of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit comes unto you seals you until the day of your Redemption a man Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of the redemption permanence ed when you are sealed it means three things a seal means security and seal means completion a seal means ownership your own by God you are sealed you are secured Satan has no more power over you and the work of salvation has been completed this is like a mineral water probably if you have a bottle if it's got no seal meaning to say it hasn't passed the standards yet or it could be you know it has could be poison in it so you know something that's not sealed is dangerous so if you're not sealed as a Christian by the Holy Spirit you can still you know turn back to the world anytime you can backslide you can you know you can deny the Lord like Peter Peter denied Jesus Christ three times because he was not yet filled by the Holy Spirit when was Peters filled on the day of Pentecost they have to eat tarry ten days to get the holy spirit so that's how you know a true Christian how they you know they serve the Lord you don't have to pat their back a brother called him on the phone why were you not here that Sunday please come no no they'll come on their own amen because it's God living in them image the Holy Spirit leading them when they say a man is not you a meaning brother that's the Holy Spirit in you a meaning to his word Amen that's my word praise the Lord so it says here it's Christ expressing himself in the individual that's the real Christian whether he's intellectual or whether he don't know his ABC you know Peter never know how to sign his own name he he don't know how to sign but he was given the key to the kingdom whatever you Luke you you whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you lose shall be loosed in heaven top of the Apostles didn't know them that's right but they know Christ to know him his life he didn't say to know the Catechism or to know the novena to know the Apostles Creed to know him Jesus Christ personally reveal to you that will make you a real effective Christian and God will be pleased with your life amen so now I believe I'll have a few more slides ago another quotation in Christ the mystery of God revealed he said upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall will never shake down never prevail against it see a revelation of Jesus Christ look he said Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation price life in you make him the center of Revelation price in the Bible makes the Bible a complete revelation of Christ and then Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see praise the Lord if you read a whole book you will find three three three fold the plan that God wanted to do Berman said the first was he wanted God wanted to reveal himself through Christ the second is he wanted Christ to be revealed among his bride and the third he would want he want to restore the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve were supposed to have a honeymoon but now the second Adam Jesus Christ and his men remember bride will be having the honeymoon we will have a glorified body we will rule and reign this world with a rod of iron in the Millennium for 1000 years we will be priests and kings with him after the rapture there will be three and a half years of tribulation see earthquakes there will be not one stone thrown down see all the the incurable diseases volcanic eruption the missiles will fly and there will be a third world war a magadhan will burn her heart and then Israel will fight against you know Gog and Magog Russia Iran will attack Israel but Jesus in Revelation 19 will come down with his Saints on white horses to fight for Israel and when he wins the battle we will the right you shall walk upon the ashes of the wicked and we will rule this earth for 1000 years no no no no man has ever lived 1,000 years Methuselah was about 969 something but we will leave a thousand years and then no more death no more pain we will be in a glorified body we will be young like sisters eighteen years old in your body brothers probably 2021 you know Jesus they didn't recognize him and he walked with the two disciples in emails because he turned back to a young man and then he just they recognized him when he broke the bread oh that was our Lord and then he disappeared and reappeared in Jerusalem among the disciple so when we have that body we can pass through walls we can drop it like a thought we can appear and disappear see that kind of body we will see angels because right now the angels are on a faster dimension the Devils are here the angels are here but one day we will see them all when we get that that new glorified body jeez Paul said in a twinkling one ah I show you a mystery behold we will not all sleep but we shall all be changed from mortality to immortality to corruption or rather corruption to incorruption we're waiting for the day and how close are we to the coming of the Lord we see all the signs we see Israel becoming a nation Israel turned 70 years last year 19 or rather they started 1948 to 2018 t so brother Branham is gone of the scene C but we still have the message because the bride under her messenger will be the final voice to the final age so we're now eating the book you know the book in Revelation 10 verse 8 to 11 John ate it and it was sweet in his stomach but bitter or rather sweet in the mouth but bitter in the stomach it's sweet to share you know to to to talk about but it's bitter it's full of you know this message will be full of persecution but it's all right amen that's that's nothing because we know that every Christian will be persecuted but the Bible said there in Revelation 10 11 it says thou must prophesy again we are declaring again this message amongst nation tongues races and colors that's our part today amen so final admonition the Bible said if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his so we ought to be filled with the Holy Spirit brother Branham said you eat ought to be the most important thing in our life to be sealed by the oil because the foolish virgin didn't get the oil only the wise virgin got the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the oil and they were left behind see so the final admonition here is just to repeat to you the eternal prescription of God that if anyone here has not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it's high time now who received the Lord which is repent turn back be baptized in the name not in the titles anymore because the revelation of the name is Lord is the name of the other Jesus is the name of the Sun and Christ Thea is the name of the Holy Spirit Lord Jesus Christ no other name is given a nerd whereby we must be saved and we must be baptized in the name of the Crucified all Christians were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul did Peter did James John and so after being baptized with the Holy Ghost that is your bonus the remission of sins and then being baptized receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost it's like that like you have a debt you have blown like a million dollars in the bank and you were not able to pay for it Jesus paid for it you're supposed to be imprisoned Jesus taking you out and then open a bank account and put another million for you you know remission of sins and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah that's the benefit of a Christian amen your Labor's will never be in vain in the Lord that's why we love him and we treasure him amen let's stand to our feet and worship Him
