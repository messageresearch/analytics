[21:47] special from brother Isaac.
[22:00] Okay. Um, God bless you all this
[22:01] morning. God bless you, brother.
[22:04] Good to see you, man.
[22:07] Um, the this is a song that it's been
[22:11] I've been working on for quite a while
[22:12] and it's kind of came together last
[22:15] week. It's not really a congregational
[22:18] song, so I thought I'd just do it like
[22:20] this rather than a congregation, but I
[22:22] have given the musicians the chords to
[22:25] it this morning. They haven't heard it
[22:26] before, but maybe they can play
[22:29] along. It's um it's called um shalom
[22:35] and it's about in your Christian walk
[22:39] sometimes you well actually quite often
[22:42] you get to a place where you actually
[22:45] run out of strength to do something that
[22:46] you that you feel you want to do or
[22:48] whatever. you just run out of strength.
[22:50] And you know, sometimes in those times
[22:52] you think, "Oh, well that's me. I
[22:53] failed." But actually, that's where God
[22:56] starts. You know, when we realize that
[22:58] we when we get to that point where we
[23:00] can't, that's when he can. Amen.
[23:02] Um
[23:04] and I the the shalom doesn't shalom
[23:07] means peace. And we we went on holiday
[23:11] maybe a few weeks ago. And
[23:14] um I had a silly phone call came through
[23:17] and it was just about some really dumb
[23:18] things that I've been dealing with for a
[23:21] long time and they kind of read their
[23:22] ugly head again and it was just I was
[23:24] kind of a wee bit over it. And I
[23:26] finished the phone
[23:28] call and I look, my wife and I, we were
[23:31] were all in the car and and we looked
[23:33] ahead of us and there was a um a camper
[23:36] van driving really slowly on the desert
[23:38] road in front of us. And on the back of
[23:40] it, it had the word
[23:42] shalom.
[23:43] So I took that as being from the Lord. I
[23:46] haven't really been stuck behind a
[23:47] camper van with the word shalom written
[23:49] on the back of it before. So I hung up
[23:51] the phone and the van was there. So, um
[23:54] I'll just quickly read these words out
[23:56] because it was
[23:57] um Brother Arman. It's it's in there. I
[24:00] think Brother Ben put it in this
[24:01] morning. I just like to do this just so
[24:04] you get an idea of what the song's
[24:06] about. It's a wee bit personal, but it's
[24:08] it relates to each one of us in our walk
[24:10] with the Lord. I think Amen. It was
[24:12] early morning night was long and the
[24:14] fight was heavy. His foes, they kept on
[24:17] coming. Sorry. Oh, kept coming on and
[24:19] on. Towards the evening, hope was
[24:22] fading. Foes are sailing, and all his
[24:24] strength was gone, and he could not go
[24:25] on. And this is the Lord speaking. You
[24:27] legions of angels, all ye heavenly host,
[24:30] g up your armor, make you ready now for
[24:32] war. My word is now void of all human
[24:35] strength. And this is where my strength
[24:36] starts. Shalom. I am your victory and
[24:39] peace. And when all your strength is
[24:42] gone, you can't carry on. Victory seems
[24:44] impossible. My word will stand secure.
[24:47] No weapon formed against you will
[24:48] prosper in those that's those tears that
[24:51] you have sown and you will reap in joy
[24:53] and you will doubtless come again
[24:54] rejoicing. You will doubtless come again
[24:56] rejoicing. This is where my strength
[24:58] starts. That's actually it. It's a short
[25:01] song.
[25:03] [Music]
[25:20] It was early
[25:22] morning. The night was long and the
[25:25] fight was heavy. His foes, they just
[25:28] kept

[25:35] Towards the
[25:37] evening, hope was fading,
[25:40] foamed, and all his strength was
[25:44] gone. And he could not go
[25:47] on. Ye legions of
[25:51] angels, and all ye heavenly
[25:55] host, g up your
[25:59] armor, make you ready now for war. My
[26:03] word is now void of all human
[26:10] strength. This is when my strength
[26:13] starts.
[26:17] Shalom.
[26:20] Shalom.
[26:23] Shalom. I am your victory and peace.
[26:28] When all your strength is gone and you
[26:33] can't carry on,
[26:36] victory seems
[26:38] impossible. My word will stand secure
[26:41] and no weapon
[26:44] formed against you will
[26:48] prosper. In those tears you have
[26:53] sown, you will reap in joy. And you will
[26:58] doubtless come. Again
[27:02] rejoicing. You will
[27:05] doubtless come. Again
[27:11] rejoicing. This is when my strength
[27:14] starts.
[27:28] Back to the
[27:31] top. It was early
[27:34] morning. The night was long and the
[27:37] fight was here. foes. They just kept
[27:41] coming on and
[27:45] on towards the

[27:52] saying, all his strength was
[27:55] gone. And he could not go home.
[28:00] Legions of
[28:02] angels and all ye heavenly
[28:07] host up your
[28:10] armor. Make you ready now. For my word
[28:15] is now void of all human

[28:59] prosper. And in those tears you have

[46:13] glad we can know you. We can be still
[46:16] and know you are God. And Father, we
[46:19] thank you, Lord, that is true to us,
[46:21] Lord. It's not just a nice phrase. It's
[46:23] a reality. Father, God of the I. Lord,
[46:26] you are the I am. You're the everpresent
[46:28] God. your present help in time of
[46:30] trouble, Lord. And Father, we want to

[46:34] more time. Amen. Father, we can lift you
[46:36] up into the highest place. And Lord, you
[46:39] Lord, you always come where you're
[46:41] invited. Amen. Lord, as your prophet
[46:43] said, you always come where you're
[46:44] invited. One day you're invited to a
[46:46] feast, but you weren't made welcome.
[46:48] Lord, they they they invite you there to
[46:50] make fun of you. But Lord, that was all
[46:51] arranged that a that a little prostitute
[46:54] woman would would sneak in and anoint
[46:56] your feet with a breaker alabaster box
[46:58] over your feet and anoint you. And
[47:00] Father, that was all done for her, Lord.
[47:02] And dear Lord, we have invited you here
[47:05] not to make fun of you, but you'd take
[47:06] the highest place. Father, you you'd
[47:09] have the best place in the feast, Lord
[47:10] Jesus, that you, Lord, we want to make
[47:12] you welcome. Father, may you be welcome
[47:15] in every heart today. And Father, may
[47:17] your anointing come forth upon us, Lord.
[47:20] May your word come forth, Lord. Come
[47:22] forth. And Father, speak to every life
[47:24] here, oh God. Lord, we face a real
[47:26] enemy. And we know we need you to defeat
[47:29] that enemy, Lord. May you do that this
[47:31] morning in every life, oh God. Father,
[47:33] may we take courage to press the battle.
[47:36] And Lord, we want to tell you that we
[47:37] love you to all our hearts, Lord, with

[47:41] you be glorified, Lord. We just want to
[47:44] lift, Lord, Sister Andre's mom into your
[47:47] presence by prayer. Lord, I pray, oh

[47:51] her eye. Father, you'd supply her needs,
[47:53] Lord. Father, be her strength and her
[47:56] portion. Lord, I pray. Father, may you

[48:19] commit the service into your hands.
[48:21] Father, take control, oh God. In Jesus
[48:24] Christ's name, we yield ourselves to you
[48:26] for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name
[48:28] we ask, Lord. Amen.
[48:32] Amen. Amen. God bless the musicians.
[48:34] Thank you. Amen. Appreciate it. Amen.
[48:37] Good to have everyone out this morning.
[48:40] Amen. God bless you all. Bless you,
[48:42] brother.
[48:44] Amen. Let's just go to uh Genesis
[48:46] chapter
[48:52] 22.
[48:59] Amen. I'm just going to read verses 15
[49:01] to
[49:03] 17. Amen.
[49:13] This is just
[49:15] after Abraham is uh going to off just uh
[49:19] was about to offer his son Isaac. We're
[49:21] just going to go to the end of this uh
[49:23] story here. So verse so so Genesis 22:15
[49:26] to1 17. And the angel of the Lord called
[49:29] unto Abraham out of heaven the second
[49:32] time and said, "By myself have I sworn,
[49:35] sayeth the Lord, for because thou hast
[49:37] done this thing, and hast not how
[49:39] withheld thy son, thine only son, that
[49:41] in blessing I will bless thee, and in
[49:43] multiplying I'll multiply thy seed as
[49:45] the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
[49:47] which is upon the seashore, and thy seed
[49:50] shall possess the gates of his enemy."
[49:53] Amen. May the Lord bless his word. You
[49:55] may be seated. Amen. And thy seed shall
[49:58] possess the gates of his enemy. Amen.
[50:00] Now, Brother Brandham, he he says in a a
[50:02] sermon called harvest time, and he's and
[50:04] he's in prayer, and he says, "Now, let
[50:06] us pray." And while we're praying with
[50:08] our heads bowed towards the dust from
[50:10] which God took us, is there someone that
[50:13] would like to be remembered in prayer,
[50:14] just raise your hand. He knows right
[50:16] what's in your heart beneath the hand.
[50:19] Dear heavenly father, we so we are
[50:21] solemnly approaching thee with our heads
[50:23] turned to the dust from where you have
[50:25] took us. And then in our minds, we're
[50:28] thinking that you told Abraham one
[50:30] night, "Could he number the sands that
[50:33] was upon the seashores?" And then you
[50:35] told him to look towards the stars. And
[50:38] could he number them? Of course, it was
[50:40] impossible. And you told him that his
[50:42] seed would be as innumerable as the
[50:45] stars, I mean, as the sands on the
[50:47] seashores. and on the stars that light
[50:50] the heavens. Now in our minds, our
[50:52] thoughts and our minds rather as we bow
[50:54] our heads towards the sand where we come
[50:58] from. Then our hearts look towards
[51:01] heaven where we are going from sand to
[51:05] stars. Being Abraham's seed, dead in
[51:08] Christ, we are Abraham's seed and is
[51:11] with him according to the promise.
[51:14] So he's saying now there's a he links
[51:18] these two together and he's saying that
[51:21] that that we came from this dust of the
[51:23] earth, the sand, but we go to the stars.
[51:26] Now I want to just recap on on Wednesday
[51:28] for those who didn't hear. Now now don't
[51:30] just glaze over. Okay? Don't glaze over.
[51:33] You just listen. Amen. Okay? Whatever
[51:35] you do, you know, the devil comes into
[51:38] church with you. Amen. And he makes your
[51:40] mind fire and all kinds of different
[51:41] things. And the first thing he says is
[51:43] you don't you don't understand what that
[51:45] man is saying. And then you just go off.
[51:47] And then you know half the time you see
[51:49] people they you know turn around and
[51:52] look at the clock and they say when can
[51:54] I get out of here and the devil says
[51:55] just sit there and just wait. It'll all
[51:57] be over soon. And you've just been
[51:59] robbed of the greatest thing you could
[52:00] ever receive. Amen. Amen. It's just
[52:03] like, you know, uh, uh, Abnner was a
[52:06] general in Saul's host and then Saul
[52:10] died and Abnner was fighting, you know,
[52:12] for for Saul's family against David. And
[52:14] then after the fighting finished, Abnner
[52:16] went into a city of refuge. And then
[52:18] what happened is is is Abnner killed
[52:21] someone's brother. And then so the
[52:23] brother says, "I'm going to revenge my
[52:25] brother that Abnner killed." And he goes
[52:26] to that city of refuge. And Abnner comes
[52:29] out of the gate. Remember in the city of
[52:31] refuge they could not be killed. He
[52:34] walks out of the gate of the city of
[52:35] refuge and this guy kills him. And David
[52:38] laments Abnner's death. He is he died
[52:41] like a fool died. Amen. That's what it
[52:44] says in the scripture. He laments
[52:45] because he died like a fool died. And
[52:48] friends, don't die like a fool died.
[52:50] Amen. Amen. Because the city of refuge
[52:53] today is Christ. Amen. And you'll die
[52:55] like a fool if you if you don't go in
[52:57] the gate and stay in the gate. Amen.
[53:00] Amen. This is not on my notes. Just how
[53:01] I feel. Don't die like a fool will die.
[53:04] Amen. This is real talk, friends. This
[53:07] is not playing games or some religion.
[53:09] So don't just sit there and say, "Well,
[53:10] in in an hour I'm going to be out of
[53:12] here. Then I can do what I want because
[53:14] what? There'll be a last time." And I'm
[53:17] not trying to put some pressure on you.
[53:18] I just want you to realize this is life
[53:20] and death. There's one life to live. And
[53:23] the whole world if I had my cell phone,
[53:25] you know, you see this Pokémon Go, all
[53:27] this this insanity coming upon the earth
[53:30] and people are being their whole life is
[53:32] this little thing and they have to live
[53:34] through their device. That's right. And
[53:36] that's the only way they can be happy is
[53:38] my cell phone. Oh, isn't it wonderful?
[53:40] And they go and they take all their
[53:41] selfies and you know, their whole life
[53:43] is through this thing. It's not through
[53:45] here talking to someone having a real
[53:46] relationship. It's I love my cell phone
[53:49] and you're just an accessory to this
[53:51] thing. Amen. That's how pathetic. That's
[53:53] how blind this world has become. And the
[53:56] winds of war are blowing upon the earth.
[53:58] Amen. A tribulation setting in. And I've
[54:00] got to catch this this this Pikachu
[54:02] here.
[54:04] And there's a way of escape upon the
[54:06] earth. Oh, that's so ridiculous. But
[54:08] that's how people are. And there's a
[54:10] there's an arc of safety being set
[54:12] before all mankind. Amen. And that ark
[54:15] is Christ. But I've got to catch this.
[54:18] Got to put a lure here. And I need to do
[54:19] this. And you know, people they spend
[54:21] they people have died, I think, playing
[54:24] that game. And they've been in car
[54:26] wrecks. All kinds of things. I've got to
[54:28] catch a Pikachu. My Bulbasaurus. I need
[54:31] to level them up.
[54:37] What is it? Brother Bram said, "This
[54:39] world will go insane."
[54:41] And we're living in the insane time.
[54:43] Amen. I say we're here. Amen. Thank God
[54:46] we have something to give us a pure
[54:47] mind, a sound mind. Amen. Hallelujah.
[54:50] Amen. Now, it's true. This world is mad.
[54:54] This world is insane. This world is
[54:56] falling apart and people are going to go
[54:58] laughing all the way to hell. Amen.
[55:00] That's what people, they're just on this
[55:02] world is just a slide and people are
[55:04] thinking they're having the greatest
[55:05] time. Amen.
[55:08] Don't go down that way. Amen. This
[55:12] serpent, the devil that we fight
[55:13] against, he is biting people every day.
[55:17] You know, it says it says in the book of
[55:18] Proverbs, it says someone who becomes a
[55:21] drunkard and it, you know, and then they
[55:23] and then they wake up and they said they
[55:25] hit me and I felt it not and all these
[55:26] things, you know, and he says I'll go
[55:28] seek it again. Amen. Because they become
[55:30] intoxicated and this world is drunk on
[55:33] many things. Yeah. Not just alcohol, but
[55:36] many things. Pleasure, sport,
[55:38] pornography, whatever, lust, whatever it
[55:40] may be, you know, just work even. This
[55:42] world is drunk. I said, "Oh, you know,
[55:45] but I remember waking up hung over many
[55:47] times. I never felt very good." But yet,
[55:50] something in me says, "I'll go seek it
[55:51] again." But then one day, Jesus came.
[55:54] Amen. Hallelujah. And that's just not
[55:55] alcohol. It's a whole bunch of things.
[55:57] Then Jesus came and broke that thing.
[55:59] And he's present here to break that
[56:00] thing. Amen. If there's something
[56:02] holding you back, you don't have to
[56:04] carry it out these doors. You don't have
[56:06] to live with it anymore. Get the monkey
[56:08] off your back. That's right. Hallelujah.
[56:10] There's a power here to get the monkey
[56:11] off your back if you want to be free.
[56:14] Remember, repentance is not because you
[56:16] were caught. You don't repent because
[56:18] you're caught. You repent because you
[56:20] hate the thing that made you do it.
[56:22] Amen. Saying, "I'm sorry cuz you're
[56:24] caught." That's just because you got
[56:25] busted. But if that thing is not out of
[56:27] you, you'll do it again. It may be years
[56:30] down the road that thing will sit. You
[56:32] got to get rid of that thing.
[56:35] Amen. Because if someone truly repents,
[56:38] they're different. Yes, that's right.
[56:41] Amen. How long does it take? 5 seconds.
[56:44] Amen. Amen. 5 seconds to become a
[56:46] believer. I told the story. I heard it
[56:48] again. There's a there's a in in brother
[56:51] Tim Puit's church, the wife of the
[56:53] deacon. She was a young girl. She was in
[56:55] the service of the wings of Snow White
[56:57] Dove. A few I think four people in front
[56:59] of her was a woman that was called out
[57:01] in the prayer line cuz she smoked. This
[57:04] little girl just started smoking. And
[57:06] when that was called out, she she prayed
[57:09] in her heart. She said, "Lord, forgive
[57:10] me. I didn't know it was wrong." And
[57:13] then when she stood in front of the
[57:14] prophet, remember in front of that
[57:16] presence, everyone's naked and exposed.
[57:18] And when she came in front of the
[57:20] prophet, God didn't call that thing out
[57:23] because it had been dealt with just a
[57:25] few people before that. That's how easy
[57:27] it is to be free. Hallelujah. Amen.
[57:30] Amen. Just like brother Brown. You You
[57:32] see, you see, you can hear it on tape.
[57:33] He's in Grand Prairie. He's up there in
[57:35] British Columbia and they're singing at
[57:37] the end of the service and they're
[57:38] singing, "Well, uh, oh, I love him or
[57:40] you know, cuz he first love me
[57:41] something." And you hear brother cry
[57:43] out, "You won't commit suicide, soldier
[57:45] boy. That's the devil talking to you."
[57:47] He says, "Deny him and you'll be a real
[57:49] gentleman." Amen. Now, there was a power
[57:52] present to break that if he denied it.
[57:54] Amen. Amen. And there was a power
[57:56] present. But God in his grace because
[57:58] obviously the soldier boy didn't didn't
[58:00] deny him because God in his grace
[58:02] hundreds of miles north in the
[58:04] wilderness in this little place a man
[58:06] took that soldier boy and they came into
[58:08] where brother Bam and then we're having
[58:10] lunch and that guy who who brought the
[58:12] soldier boy said I believe we'd find you
[58:13] today. Amen. And if you go look at the
[58:16] map it's the most ridiculous you know
[58:18] percentage of even finding anyone there.
[58:21] Amen. And then and then they went they
[58:23] had their lunch. You go, you go listen
[58:25] to it again. Go watch it again. They go
[58:28] outside. They go and pray. Brother, uh,
[58:31] yo, brother Bon, the soldier boy. They
[58:33] pray. They turn around. He said, the
[58:35] soldier boy's face was totally
[58:36] different. Says, "I'm free. I'm free.
[58:39] I'm free." Hallelujah. He said, "That
[58:41] man told me that only something me and
[58:43] my wife knows in this whole earth." And
[58:45] when he said that, I was free.
[58:46] Hallelujah. Amen. God's grace. He could
[58:48] have denied it in the meeting. Amen. But
[58:50] yet God's grace said that man must be
[58:52] free. Yes. Hallelujah. And that same son
[58:55] of man, Jesus Christ, is present.
[58:58] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Now,
[58:59] friends, I want to recap Wednesday, but
[59:02] don't, you know, stop being bitten by
[59:04] the serpent. Have you been just just
[59:07] just just don't entertain him anymore.
[59:09] That's right. That's right. Amen.
[59:11] Hallelujah. Whatever you do,
[59:14] now God created man in his own image in
[59:17] in in in Genesis chapter 1. And the
[59:20] image of God created he him. male and
[59:22] female created he them. And we
[59:24] understand that God is a spirit. Now, in
[59:26] Genesis 2:7, it says, "The Lord God
[59:29] formed man out of the dust of the earth
[59:31] and breathed into his ne uh nostrils the
[59:33] breath of life and man became a living
[59:36] soul." Now man, so so man was a spirit
[59:39] man and then God made a body out of the
[59:41] dusty earth put the spirit man in a body
[59:44] and then now but then what happened is
[59:47] is is after the
[59:49] fall remember Adam if you read Genesis
[59:52] 5:1 it says this is the generation this
[59:55] is the book of the generations of
[59:59] Adam and that day God created man in the
[1:00:03] likeness of God made he him so he made
[1:00:06] So, Adam was made in God's image, but
[1:00:08] then there was a fall. And then it says
[1:00:10] in the second verse, male and female
[1:00:12] created them and blessed them and called
[1:00:14] their name Adam in the day that they had
[1:00:16] created. And Adam lived 130 years and
[1:00:19] begat a son in his own likeness after
[1:00:22] his image and called his name Seth. So,
[1:00:24] he wasn't Seth wasn't made in the image
[1:00:27] of God. He was made in the image of
[1:00:29] Adam, the fallen man. Yep.
[1:00:32] And Adam, the name Adam is derived from
[1:00:35] a Hebrew noun meaning the ground or the
[1:00:38] earth. So, he was a son of the earth.
[1:00:41] Amen. He's the son of
[1:00:43] dust. And we understand dust just like
[1:00:46] sand. You know, I was looking just just
[1:00:48] what I found on the on the internet. The
[1:00:51] only difference between dust, rock dust,
[1:00:54] and sand is the particle size. When it
[1:00:56] comes to a definition, it's not
[1:00:58] necessarily the the geological content
[1:01:00] of the minerals in it. It's the particle
[1:01:02] size between rock, dust, and sand. This
[1:01:04] is just what I found very briefly. So,
[1:01:07] dust and sand have same kind of uh
[1:01:11] properties. They blow with the wind.
[1:01:14] Amen. They don't stay fixed. Just you go
[1:01:17] and it just blows. And God was showing
[1:01:21] this is what man will be without me.
[1:01:23] Amen. They'll be dust. They will move
[1:01:26] what whatever forces come upon them,
[1:01:28] they'll move with it.
[1:01:30] Amen. And you can see it today. Well, in
[1:01:33] every generation, right? Popular culture
[1:01:36] moves the sand. Amen. It moves people.
[1:01:39] People's attitudes and how they view
[1:01:41] things in life are all moved because
[1:01:44] they are we are dust.
[1:01:47] Amen. But when you add water to rock
[1:01:50] dust, you get clay. And then you can
[1:01:53] make a you can make something out of
[1:01:55] that clay. And you can put that clay jar
[1:01:58] there and you can put the dust there
[1:02:01] and the clay jar stays right there.
[1:02:04] But the water is the vital ingredient.
[1:02:07] Without the water that blow like the
[1:02:09] rest of the dust. And it's the same
[1:02:11] thing with the believer. Amen. If you've
[1:02:13] got the spirit of God in you, the
[1:02:15] culture will blow. Society will blow.
[1:02:18] You won't move. There's something in you
[1:02:21] said, "I'm not going with the rest of
[1:02:22] the crowd." Amen. I may be a sheep, but
[1:02:24] I'm not one of those sheep. Amen. I'm
[1:02:26] one of God's sheep. And I've heard his
[1:02:28] voice, and I will not follow a stranger.
[1:02:31] Amen. Hallelujah. So now God God allowed
[1:02:34] man to fall this way. And so now the
[1:02:38] entire human race was fallen and he be
[1:02:41] to have sons of dust. Amen. And now, but
[1:02:46] I just want to retain this in the
[1:02:47] cruelty of sin. It says, "I can see Adam
[1:02:50] and Eve." Because remember we read in
[1:02:51] the beginning, just just to go back, he
[1:02:54] said in that prayer, "From the sand to
[1:02:56] the
[1:02:57] stars." So we're we're like dust, but
[1:03:00] then we become like the stars because
[1:03:03] not a shooting star. We're not fly by
[1:03:05] nights. That's right. Amen. But but the
[1:03:08] stars are in a fixed orbit. Amen.
[1:03:10] They're in their position. Nothing can
[1:03:13] move them from their position. Amen.
[1:03:14] Amen. They're all rotating around the
[1:03:16] stars and everything that you know, you
[1:03:18] know, in the galaxies, everything. And
[1:03:19] they're all declaring the glory of the
[1:03:21] Lord. Amen. In their position. Amen. So,
[1:03:24] we go from something that's just blowing
[1:03:25] with the like the wind into something
[1:03:27] that's immovable. Amen. Far above the
[1:03:30] storms of life. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[1:03:33] what we've been made. I'm so glad for
[1:03:36] that. Thank you, Lord. And I can see
[1:03:38] Adam and
[1:03:39] Eve pull these bloody flapping skins
[1:03:43] around them. Could you imagine the
[1:03:45] lovely, beautiful bodies of those
[1:03:46] perfect two perfect human beings now
[1:03:49] wrapped in bloody sheep skin? I can see
[1:03:51] them stand out there. God said, "Adam,
[1:03:54] because you listened to your wife
[1:03:56] instead of me. Then I took you out of
[1:03:58] the dust and dust your return." And Eve,
[1:04:01] because you listened to the serpent
[1:04:02] instead of me, you brought life, took
[1:04:04] life out of the world. You'll have to
[1:04:07] bring life into the world. I'll multiply
[1:04:08] your sorrows and your and your desire
[1:04:11] shall be to your husband and so forth.
[1:04:13] Then he said, "Serpent, because you did
[1:04:15] this, walked up." He wasn't a reptile.
[1:04:18] He was a beast. Walked up more subtle
[1:04:20] than all the beasts of the field. Bear
[1:04:22] me record. That's scripture. Absolutely.
[1:04:24] Walked up like a man. And he had
[1:04:26] deceived her and said, "Because you did
[1:04:28] this, off comes your legs and on your
[1:04:30] belly you'll go all the days of your
[1:04:32] life and dust shall be your
[1:04:34] meat." And right there they was
[1:04:37] judgment. God had to keep his judgment
[1:04:40] because that he spoke it and he's God.
[1:04:42] He can't back up on it. He's got to
[1:04:45] stay. In order to be God, he has to keep
[1:04:47] his word. That's right. So there, I can
[1:04:50] imagine seeing that poor little Eve when
[1:04:53] she looked at Adam, her long blonde hair
[1:04:55] hanging down her back, those big bright
[1:04:56] blue eyes that look like the skies where
[1:04:59] God had made them. Tears pouring down,
[1:05:02] mixing with the blood on the garments
[1:05:04] and flapping around her legs. Eve, Adam
[1:05:06] with his strong body caught her and
[1:05:08] leaned her over on his bosom. And there
[1:05:11] the tears mingling, falling as it was
[1:05:14] run through the sheep skins, blood
[1:05:15] dripping down, blood all the way. There
[1:05:18] now he says, "You have to depart out of
[1:05:20] my presence." I can see Adam and Eve
[1:05:23] with their arms around one another
[1:05:25] going, moving out like this, them old
[1:05:27] sheep skins flopping against their leg,
[1:05:30] bloody beating on their leg. Then I can
[1:05:32] see, then I can see all that space which
[1:05:35] was God. God had no beginning of days,
[1:05:38] ending of years. He's forever and
[1:05:40] forever. I can see all that great space
[1:05:43] begin to move together like this. Coming
[1:05:45] down in a funnel shape like that. And it
[1:05:48] moved right down as he began to eye that
[1:05:51] little couple going down through the
[1:05:53] garden. Bloody skins flopping against
[1:05:55] their leg. He couldn't stand it. And it
[1:05:58] moved down. Oh, moved down to the very
[1:06:00] heart of God spelled Lov. God so loved.
[1:06:03] He couldn't just see them go. He called
[1:06:05] them back. said, "I'm going to put
[1:06:07] emnity between your seed and Satan's
[1:06:09] seed." Then when that was done was at
[1:06:12] Calvary when God himself came down
[1:06:14] through a woman born of a virgin. How
[1:06:17] I'd like to deal there just a little bit
[1:06:19] needed. Notice when they were driven out
[1:06:21] from the garden because of
[1:06:22] transgression. All the blessings cut off
[1:06:25] because of transgression. And I think
[1:06:27] tonight that's what the matters with the
[1:06:29] church. All the blessings being cut off
[1:06:31] because of transgression. There you are
[1:06:34] driven from the Garden of Eden. So he
[1:06:37] says, "So I just so God, remember Adam
[1:06:40] and Eve, they lived in a realm very
[1:06:42] different to the one we're born into.
[1:06:45] Adam, Adam was God over the earth. He
[1:06:48] could speak to nature. Nature obeyed
[1:06:49] him. I mean, he had he had total
[1:06:51] dominion over everything in creation.
[1:06:54] But then after the fall, he fell from
[1:06:57] that realm that he operated from." Yeah.
[1:06:59] Amen. And he was alienated. They became
[1:07:02] alienated from God, separated from
[1:07:06] God. But I want you to
[1:07:08] notice, brother Araham said about God,
[1:07:10] he couldn't stand it. He couldn't stand
[1:07:13] to see his creation in that fallen
[1:07:14] state. And that's why he gave them the
[1:07:17] promise. When he looked at his enemies,
[1:07:19] he said, "The seed of the woman's going
[1:07:20] to, you know, bruise the head of the
[1:07:23] seed of the serpent." He promised
[1:07:25] Calvary right then and there. Amen. And
[1:07:27] he gave them he covered them in
[1:07:28] sheepkins as as a down payment saying
[1:07:31] I'm going to undo this. Amen. The lamb
[1:07:33] is going to come and not just cover your
[1:07:35] sins but annihilate your sins. Amen.
[1:07:37] Amen. That you don't have to carry them
[1:07:39] anymore. And so he said because of
[1:07:41] transgression all the blessings were cut
[1:07:43] off. Amen. But I want to say if that was
[1:07:46] so now then by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:49] all the blessings are back. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:51] We have access to to a realm that they
[1:07:53] came out of. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:56] Amen. Once upon a time, man was
[1:07:58] alienated from from God. But not
[1:08:00] anymore. Yum. Who has he reconciled by
[1:08:03] the blood of Jesus Christ? Amen.
[1:08:05] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:08] Now, God God in these end days is doing
[1:08:12] a total restoration. Amen. Bring us back
[1:08:15] to our original position. That's right.
[1:08:17] And you're living in the middle of it,
[1:08:18] friends.
[1:08:20] Amen. You say, I've heard these things
[1:08:21] many times. You're living in the middle
[1:08:23] of it. Amen. So God is doing a total
[1:08:26] restoration. So everything Adam and Eve
[1:08:28] fell from, we're being restored, too.
[1:08:30] And don't wait for a body change to go
[1:08:32] back into that place. God is putting us
[1:08:34] back in that place now. Even in fallen
[1:08:37] bodies of dust. Amen. God is restoring a
[1:08:40] people. Amen. That they have the same
[1:08:42] power. Amen. They walk with God like
[1:08:44] Adam and Eve walk. Amen. God speaks to
[1:08:46] them. He speaks to us. That's right.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah. Amen. So God is doing a
[1:08:51] total
[1:08:53] restoration. Now when Adam and Eve when
[1:08:56] Adam and Eve fell, Satan took their
[1:08:58] position as God over the world because
[1:09:00] he's called the prince of the power of
[1:09:02] the air, the god of this evil age, you
[1:09:04] know, the god of this world as the
[1:09:06] scripture says. So he he be to have
[1:09:08] dominion over this world. And that's why
[1:09:10] there's the evil. That's why there's the
[1:09:12] storms. That's why there's the sickness
[1:09:14] because man fell. Amen. From his
[1:09:16] position and Satan took his place. There
[1:09:19] was a coup.
[1:09:20] Amen. There was a coup. And but because
[1:09:23] of love, that's why Adam Adam was not
[1:09:25] deceived. The scripture says Eve was
[1:09:27] deceived. But because Adam loved his
[1:09:29] wife, he went eyes open, parttook of the
[1:09:32] same, fell with her to try and redeem
[1:09:34] her. Oh, if that isn't love, I don't
[1:09:36] know what is. It's like Jesus. He went
[1:09:38] with his eyes open to the cross. He knew
[1:09:40] what he was doing. Amen. And and the
[1:09:43] purpose of it was, I'm going to take a
[1:09:46] just blown around. Hallelujah. Amen. a
[1:09:48] people of dust. I'm going to elevate
[1:09:50] them back into their rightful position
[1:09:52] in me. Hallelujah.
[1:09:55] Hallelujah. So now it
[1:09:58] says, it says in the book of Ephesians,
[1:10:01] maybe let's just turn there. I want to
[1:10:03] show you a few things.
[1:10:15] For the record, when I was young, I
[1:10:18] played Pokémon for
[1:10:19] hours. So, I'm not being some silly old
[1:10:22] crank. I played computer games till I
[1:10:25] couldn't see no more. Then I got up
[1:10:27] again. I played until I couldn't see no
[1:10:28] more. I know what it's like. I've been
[1:10:30] there. Amen.
[1:10:33] But then when you meet him, he changes
[1:10:35] your desires. And you see it for what it
[1:10:38] is. Amen. That's right. Amen. So, I
[1:10:40] haven't been living in some commune
[1:10:42] someplace far away, not knowing what
[1:10:44] things are. I've been in the world, but
[1:10:46] I'm not in the world anymore. Praise the
[1:10:47] Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Yeah. If
[1:10:51] you saw me, you'd say, "There's no hope
[1:10:53] for that guy."
[1:10:56] That's right. You would never have
[1:10:57] picked me. That's right. You would never
[1:10:58] have picked you, but God picked you
[1:11:00] before the foundation of the world.
[1:11:02] Hallelujah. And that's the main thing.
[1:11:04] Glory to God. Amen. Yes. Glory.
[1:11:06] Absolutely. Hallelujah. Amen. Hey, we
[1:11:09] have something to shout about. We have
[1:11:10] something to rejoice about. Amen. You
[1:11:12] don't just get saved and cool off and
[1:11:14] die. Amen. It just gets richer and
[1:11:16] better every day. You don't have to pump
[1:11:18] it up. It pumps you up. He's not getting
[1:11:21] yourself excited. He excites you.
[1:11:24] Anything out of motion, you bury it,
[1:11:25] it's dead. Amen. And what does the devil
[1:11:28] do? He blows his cold wind in. Tries to
[1:11:31] make you cold and indifferent.
[1:11:34] Don't go down that way. No way. If he
[1:11:37] can, he'll just make you formal and just
[1:11:39] powerless.
[1:11:40] Amen. We face a real We don't face some
[1:11:44] imagination. That's right. If I told you
[1:11:46] the story, the first house, I'm just
[1:11:47] going to tell it. The first house we
[1:11:49] lived in here, Freickleton Grove there
[1:11:50] in
[1:11:51] Wateroo. We move in and there was such
[1:11:54] an oppression in that place. I'd go to
[1:11:57] work or lift. Soon as you drive around
[1:11:59] the corner, see it again, this
[1:12:00] oppression would just come upon you. And
[1:12:02] we started fighting. We never fight. We
[1:12:04] just started fighting and Christine
[1:12:07] would say she'd just see like this black
[1:12:09] streak in the
[1:12:10] place. Hey, you saw it in there. And
[1:12:13] then so we prayed one night. We're
[1:12:15] praying there in the lounge and this
[1:12:16] fear just came upon us. I just said,
[1:12:19] "Satan, you have no right to put your
[1:12:20] fear upon us." Amen. And then but then
[1:12:23] we knew it was still there, but we knew
[1:12:25] it was there. See, don't be blind. I'm
[1:12:27] just having a bad day. Who says it's a
[1:12:29] bad day? Oh, this is just I'm just going
[1:12:31] through a night time. Who says it's a
[1:12:33] night time? Amen.
[1:12:34] Amen. Are we just going through a bad
[1:12:36] patch in our marriage? Who said it is a
[1:12:37] bad patch in your marriage? It's Satan.
[1:12:40] Amen. He'll break us all up if he could.
[1:12:43] Mash uses with a bunch of scars and
[1:12:44] throw us out into the world. That's what
[1:12:46] he could do. Oh, something's come
[1:12:48] between us. It's the devil. You got to
[1:12:51] identify it for what it is. You know,
[1:12:53] the Christian world even today wants to
[1:12:55] put tags and this is what this is. It's
[1:12:58] it's Satan. You got to go. Don't give it
[1:13:01] some human name. It's the devil. That's
[1:13:03] right. Amen. That's not too Oh, that's
[1:13:05] just you just that's just oldfashioned.
[1:13:08] No, it's not. What happened when Jesus
[1:13:10] cast out devils? Their sickness was cast
[1:13:13] out. Amen. Cancer was healed. Amen.
[1:13:15] Amen. All manner of diseases. What
[1:13:16] happened? Because the life was taken out
[1:13:18] that thing. And whenever when I see a
[1:13:20] virus come in, I say, God, take the life
[1:13:22] out of it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:24] Amen. Amen. And so anyway, there was
[1:13:27] this thing. And then, but we knew it had
[1:13:31] to go. We knew it was still there. And
[1:13:33] then one time we were there and we
[1:13:36] didn't even do anything. But then God
[1:13:39] just came down and we started to praise
[1:13:41] the Lord. And then I was there next to
[1:13:43] my wife and she's looking at the door
[1:13:45] and she had this like this scared look
[1:13:47] like started look on her face and she
[1:13:50] saw the thing and then she and it was
[1:13:53] never in the house again. It left. God
[1:13:55] came down and drove it out and there was
[1:13:58] such peace in that place. Christine
[1:14:00] brought a workmate from the from the
[1:14:02] hospital. Total unbeliever. She steps
[1:14:04] into our house. It's so peaceful in
[1:14:06] here.
[1:14:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:10] And then so we the day we are leaving
[1:14:12] that house, the neighbor says, you know,
[1:14:15] there was a woman in that place and she
[1:14:17] was using it as a brothel.
[1:14:20] Amen. So where did that evil spirit come
[1:14:23] from? What they were doing.
[1:14:25] Amen. This is a true story. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:29] Amen. So, we're not That's why I say
[1:14:31] we're not fighting against some figment
[1:14:32] of our imagination or some moral just a
[1:14:35] moral thing. We have a real enemy.
[1:14:37] That's right. We have a real enemy.
[1:14:39] That's right. Amen. But we have a real
[1:14:41] God. Amen. Amen. We have a real God.
[1:14:45] Yes, sir. And he is not wanting us to be
[1:14:48] Satan's whipping boy anymore. Amen.
[1:14:51] Amen. What is someone that that that
[1:14:53] that lives their whole life through a
[1:14:55] device? They are Satan's whipping boy.
[1:14:58] Amen. They just they just get beaten
[1:15:00] around all the time. Amen. It is what it
[1:15:03] is. Uh just take it for what it is.
[1:15:07] Amen. Amen. We don't have to live that
[1:15:08] way anymore. Amen. You don't have to be
[1:15:10] beaten around by your job. Dictated to
[1:15:13] by society. We're not here. We are not
[1:15:17] here. This society is here for our
[1:15:19] benefit. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes. You
[1:15:22] understand? Everything in life is for
[1:15:24] our benefit. Amen. We should never serve
[1:15:27] it. It's meant to serve us. That that
[1:15:29] doesn't mean you go around arrogant
[1:15:30] saying, "Hey boys, I own this place."
[1:15:34] The meek shall inherit the earth. Amen.
[1:15:37] And if God's in you, you don't have to
[1:15:39] try and be meek. It's in you to be meek.
[1:15:41] You can't help it. Amen. But we're not
[1:15:44] here to jump on the hamster wheel of
[1:15:46] life, the rat race. What race is in a
[1:15:49] rat race? Rats. We're not rats. That's
[1:15:52] right. Amen.
[1:15:54] You may think he just called me a rat.
[1:15:56] Well, if you think you are a rat,
[1:15:57] there's a power here to change you from
[1:15:59] a rat to a lamb.
[1:16:01] Amen.
[1:16:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, Ephesians
[1:16:05] 4:17,
[1:16:10] we've seen Satan work. We've seen God
[1:16:12] work.
[1:16:14] Amen. If all you get out of the service
[1:16:16] that Satan is real, good. Because then
[1:16:18] you'll say, "Will there be a God?" Amen.
[1:16:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:23] Now, so I said now, so Ephesians
[1:16:27] 4:17, this I say therefore and testify
[1:16:30] in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not
[1:16:32] as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:16:34] their mind, having the understanding
[1:16:36] darkened, being alienated from the life
[1:16:38] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:16:40] them, because of the blindness of their
[1:16:42] hearts, who being past feeling, who
[1:16:46] being past feeling, have given
[1:16:47] themselves over unto the shiviousness to
[1:16:50] walk in all uncleanness, with
[1:16:53] greediestness. greediness. So he says,
[1:16:55] "Don't walk as they do." Amen. We're
[1:16:59] different people. You just think God has
[1:17:02] given you grace that he's opened your
[1:17:04] eyes. Amen. Amen. And this is not all a
[1:17:07] whole bunch of conspiracy theories and
[1:17:09] stuff. Those guys are a million miles
[1:17:10] off. I wouldn't give myself to those
[1:17:12] things. I'd give myself to this. Because
[1:17:15] you know, we can get so caught up all
[1:17:17] the news and this is happening, this is
[1:17:18] happening. It's all interesting. But
[1:17:20] don't look at that. You should be able
[1:17:21] to look into yourself and say this is
[1:17:23] happening and this is happening. This is
[1:17:25] happening because when the bride is
[1:17:26] ready, she leaves. You are the main news
[1:17:29] event in the day. Amen. Not not what
[1:17:32] ISIS is doing. Not what all those not
[1:17:34] what the TPPA or the trade stuff and the
[1:17:38] Illuminati and whatever. Who cares?
[1:17:40] You're the main news event because when
[1:17:43] you're ready, the whole world is waiting
[1:17:45] for the manifestation or the revealing
[1:17:48] of the sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[1:17:50] The creation is waiting for you to be
[1:17:52] revealed. Amen. Amen. Remember you
[1:17:54] already are because you are a son. He
[1:17:56] sends for your sends forth the spirit
[1:17:58] where you cry aba father or my father
[1:18:00] because it's not because you become
[1:18:02] because you are. Amen. Because you are.
[1:18:05] But once upon a time we were alienated
[1:18:08] in our minds from God. But then God and
[1:18:11] his grace came your way. Amen. So don't
[1:18:14] sit there and say, "Well, I don't feel
[1:18:15] too much." It's probably because you're
[1:18:17] just alienated. That's right. But you
[1:18:19] say, "Lord,
[1:18:22] you know, reconcile me."
[1:18:24] Amen. Amen. Don't just, you know, don't
[1:18:26] just take it, well, I must not be one of
[1:18:28] them. No, because once upon a time, I
[1:18:30] was blind in the world. That's right.
[1:18:32] But then God in his grace revealed his
[1:18:35] son in me. Amen. Hallelujah. We are the
[1:18:39] sons. The scripture says, "Now we are
[1:18:41] the sons and daughters of God."
[1:18:43] Remember, a son is a position. Amen. It
[1:18:46] is a position. It's not, oh, someone's
[1:18:48] just born to family. It's someone that's
[1:18:50] been placed in their position. Amen.
[1:18:52] Yeah. So, it says, now the whole
[1:18:54] creation, Romans, I think 8, is waiting
[1:18:57] for the manifestation or the revealing
[1:19:00] of the sons of God. So, this whole
[1:19:03] world, remember, this world is going
[1:19:06] through birth pains. Amen. You know,
[1:19:09] when brother preaches sermons, he
[1:19:10] doesn't just think, "Oh, this would be
[1:19:11] cool. Maybe I'll just, oh, this sounds,
[1:19:13] oh, that's a cool scripture." No, it's a
[1:19:16] prophet announcing things. Amen. He
[1:19:18] says, he says the first world war was a
[1:19:20] first birth pain. The second world war
[1:19:22] was a second birth pain. And now with
[1:19:24] all the atomic and all those bombs they
[1:19:26] have, it'll it'll make, you know, it'll
[1:19:28] it'll birth the world. It it'll come
[1:19:30] forth in a new creation.
[1:19:33] Amen. So, the world is primed and ready
[1:19:36] to go. Yeah. But the one thing it's
[1:19:39] waiting for is you coming to your
[1:19:41] position in Christ. Because once you
[1:19:44] come to your position in Christ, then
[1:19:45] the rapture will go and then the thing
[1:19:47] will be burned over again. Amen. So the
[1:19:50] world you are, you are the news event.
[1:19:55] What God is doing personally to you is
[1:19:57] the is the news. Amen. It is actually
[1:19:59] the headline news. All this other stuff
[1:20:01] is just filling.
[1:20:03] Amen.
[1:20:05] God is waiting for you. Remember, it is
[1:20:07] God that places you. Amen. You just have
[1:20:10] to be yielded and surrendered for him to
[1:20:14] place you in your position in Christ.
[1:20:16] Amen. So it's not something you elevate
[1:20:18] your to and or try and squeeze your way
[1:20:20] into. Just give yourself to him.
[1:20:23] Amen. And if there's something holding
[1:20:25] you back, you need prayer for that thing
[1:20:27] to be broken. Amen. Amen. Because do you
[1:20:31] think the devil
[1:20:32] wants once upon a time the devil made it
[1:20:36] says in Ephesians 2 where in times past
[1:20:38] you walked according to the prince of
[1:20:39] the power of the air. So that's why we
[1:20:42] blew with the wind because we were being
[1:20:44] governed. We're under a slave master.
[1:20:47] But we thought it was our desires were
[1:20:50] causing us to go down that way. No, it
[1:20:52] was our slave master, the devil. So do
[1:20:55] you think do you think a slave master
[1:20:56] wants his slaves to go free?
[1:21:00] Oh, that's a great idea. I'll free them
[1:21:02] all. Where's he going to get his revenue
[1:21:04] from? Where's he going to get people to
[1:21:06] work his fields and do what he wants?
[1:21:08] Amen. And so when the gospel trumpet
[1:21:12] comes came your way, and you realize
[1:21:14] it's more than just denomination and
[1:21:16] Sunday and you walk out church, you
[1:21:18] forget about God and come back the next
[1:21:19] day, next Sunday. It's how it is. But
[1:21:21] when you recognize that God has called
[1:21:24] you, Amen. And that you're not meant to
[1:21:26] be a devil's slave, but you're meant to
[1:21:28] be a son or daughter of God. The devil
[1:21:30] doesn't just, oh, I'll just quit. I
[1:21:34] can't hold them. Remember when Abraham
[1:21:36] was promised, God promised Abraham, your
[1:21:39] seed is going to be in a strange land
[1:21:41] 400 years, speaking of Egypt, but I'm
[1:21:43] going to deliver them out with a mighty
[1:21:44] hand. They're going to come back to the
[1:21:46] promised land. Satan was there. He had
[1:21:49] his he had his voice memo going on his
[1:21:52] phone because he wanted to make sure he
[1:21:53] knew what what the prophecy was, right?
[1:21:56] And then he's now then he and then he
[1:21:57] goes on the WhatsApp chat to all the
[1:21:59] kings of that land. Boys, we got to
[1:22:01] prepare. Hallelujah. 400 years. We got
[1:22:04] 400 years, right? And those nations were
[1:22:07] anointed. When you read the descriptions
[1:22:09] of the promised land, it speaks about
[1:22:11] their strength of their cities and their
[1:22:13] walls and their defenses. What was
[1:22:15] happening? The devil was building
[1:22:17] bunkers, putting a gun in place for an
[1:22:19] invasion. For 400 years, he was doing
[1:22:22] that. Amen. But God had said, "Your seed
[1:22:25] is going to go on that land."
[1:22:26] Hallelujah. And it's the same thing with
[1:22:28] you where our our our promised land is
[1:22:31] our position in Christ is in heavenly
[1:22:34] places, which we'll get to. But Satan is
[1:22:36] squatting in that in our promised land.
[1:22:39] Amen. So it's so it's your job. Yes.
[1:22:41] Amen. with the sword in your mouth. To
[1:22:44] cast him down and take your position.
[1:22:47] Amen. That's what we're called to do.
[1:22:49] Hallelujah. But do you think he's just
[1:22:50] going to quit? When because he sees he,
[1:22:54] you know, because he knows your emotion.
[1:22:55] He knows you when when you begin to
[1:22:57] respond. Do you think he just throws his
[1:22:59] white
[1:23:01] flag? Oh, I give up here. God wins. No
[1:23:06] way. No way. So don't think it's strange
[1:23:11] when the devil comes, he trains his guns
[1:23:12] down. And remember in the garden, that
[1:23:15] was his best shot. He wasn't just, oh,
[1:23:18] just I'll just see just throw out a
[1:23:20] little scouting party, you know, just
[1:23:21] see what you can. No, no, no. That was
[1:23:22] his main offensive
[1:23:25] against against mankind. And then when
[1:23:27] he comes against you, just trains his
[1:23:29] guns down because you're beginning to
[1:23:30] rise up and he just lets go. He doesn't
[1:23:34] care about his guns overheating.
[1:23:37] Amen. Our enemies are vicious.
[1:23:40] He's not a gentleman. He would never
[1:23:43] even think of signing the Geneva
[1:23:44] Convention.
[1:23:46] Amen. Which is how you deal with
[1:23:48] prisoners of war. And you know there,
[1:23:50] you know, the Japanese didn't sign it.
[1:23:52] Look what they did. What was anointing
[1:23:54] them? What was anointing, you know, the
[1:23:58] Nazis to kill all the Jews?
[1:24:00] There was a there was a devil.
[1:24:03] They weren't, you
[1:24:04] know, and they, you know, you know, and
[1:24:06] the Japanese over and over again said,
[1:24:07] "We never signed the Geneva Convention
[1:24:10] in World War II." Remember, it wasn't
[1:24:11] the nation, it was the spirit on the
[1:24:13] nation. Yeah. And that was just
[1:24:15] reflecting now, this is what I'm going
[1:24:17] to do. So, in the natural, that was
[1:24:19] actually just a reflection of what the
[1:24:21] devil wants to do in the spiritual,
[1:24:23] work you to death, feed you with
[1:24:25] nothing. That's why there's a famine in
[1:24:28] the land. That's right. That's why
[1:24:30] people are trying to find scraps. That's
[1:24:32] right. You know, if you have ever read
[1:24:33] the accounts of the prisoners of war
[1:24:35] under the Japanese, the brutality they
[1:24:38] had to endure. Have you ever have you
[1:24:40] ever read about that? They try and just,
[1:24:43] you know, they have like, you know, the
[1:24:44] Japanese would have potatoes. They peel
[1:24:45] all the potatoes and they just try and
[1:24:47] somehow steal the skins because they
[1:24:50] weren't fed anything. They weren't and
[1:24:52] they just try and get the skins and try
[1:24:53] and somehow cook them up and eat them
[1:24:55] just trying to survive. Yeah. All kinds
[1:24:58] of harsh things. And they would just
[1:24:59] they would just march till they died.
[1:25:02] Yeah, you should go see it. And what
[1:25:05] does the devil do? He comes into
[1:25:07] denomination.
[1:25:10] And he just gives he gives things. Now,
[1:25:12] this is this day and he gives people
[1:25:15] spiritual things. Yeah. Which don't feed
[1:25:17] their soul. That's right. And but he
[1:25:20] gives them a nice or this is a nice
[1:25:22] children's program and this is the young
[1:25:24] adults program and this is our music
[1:25:26] program and they do all the you know and
[1:25:28] it and it just becomes a society.
[1:25:31] Now, I'm not condemning the people in
[1:25:32] there. The word says, "Come out of her,
[1:25:34] my people." You're responsible to call
[1:25:37] them out. That's right. So, God give us
[1:25:39] grace and God give us godly love and
[1:25:42] concern that we can somehow live a life
[1:25:44] that they'll want what we have. Amen.
[1:25:47] Amen. It's not going there saying this
[1:25:48] is wrong and this is wrong and this is
[1:25:50] wrong. Lord, pull them out some way. May
[1:25:53] they see a difference. Amen. Amen. May
[1:25:55] they just thirst, hunger and thirst for
[1:25:57] righteousness.
[1:25:59] Amen. But that's how that's the natural
[1:26:01] in World War II. The spiritual now
[1:26:03] people are
[1:26:04] emaciated because it said there'd be a
[1:26:06] famine in the land. Not for bread or
[1:26:09] water, but by the hearing the word of
[1:26:11] the Lord.
[1:26:12] Amen.
[1:26:14] But that's why we are living in a feast.
[1:26:16] Because in a time of famine, Elijah,
[1:26:18] remember there's a drought. Elijah went
[1:26:21] to the brook Cherith and the ravens fed
[1:26:23] him and he drank. Amen. He had he had he
[1:26:26] had food. He was sustained in the
[1:26:28] drought. And we are living out that
[1:26:31] scripture.
[1:26:32] Amen. Where it even says in Amos 8 there
[1:26:36] that young men and young women will will
[1:26:38] will go to and fro and they'll actually
[1:26:40] not find what they need and they'll die.
[1:26:44] Amen. Because the young would be the
[1:26:45] ones you think that can travel. They're
[1:26:47] the strong ones. They said there'll be
[1:26:49] such a famine they won't even get what
[1:26:51] they need. But then I just read that I
[1:26:53] say thank you Lord. Amen. I didn't find
[1:26:56] the oasis. The oasis found me. Amen.
[1:27:00] The, you know, the food, the hidden food
[1:27:02] found me. Hallelujah. That's why we have
[1:27:05] a seven course meal. Amen. That's why
[1:27:08] we're filter overflowing. Thank you,
[1:27:10] Jesus.
[1:27:11] But the reason that is also
[1:27:13] because now let's go to second
[1:27:15] Corinthians 10. Sorry, I just I just
[1:27:18] jump ahead of myself.
[1:27:26] 2 Corinthians 10 and verse three. I'm in
[1:27:30] 1 Corinthians. It doesn't
[1:27:40] help. He says this
[1:27:43] here familiar scripture to us all. For
[1:27:46] though we walk in the
[1:27:48] flesh, we do not war after the flesh.
[1:27:51] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:27:53] carnal, but mighty through God to the
[1:27:57] pulling down of strongholds, casting
[1:27:59] down imaginations, and every high thing
[1:28:02] that exaltth itself against the
[1:28:04] knowledge of God, bringing into
[1:28:06] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:28:10] of Christ. Amen. So our weapon So that's
[1:28:14] why this is a spiritual war. Amen. And
[1:28:17] we are called now not to fight. That's
[1:28:19] why that's why if things go wrong in the
[1:28:22] family or against brother and sister,
[1:28:24] it's not that person. It's never that
[1:28:27] person. It's never your children or your
[1:28:30] spouse or brother so and so, sister so
[1:28:32] and so. It's never them. It's the enemy.
[1:28:36] Amen. And you have to recognize it that
[1:28:38] way.
[1:28:40] Amen. So, we are
[1:28:43] called to pull down strongholds. Amen.
[1:28:46] We are called to cast down imaginations.
[1:28:49] Amen. And every high thing that exalts
[1:28:51] itself against the knowledge of God,
[1:28:53] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:28:55] the obedience of Christ. So if this
[1:28:57] thing starts running,
[1:28:59] and it's not according to this, you have
[1:29:02] to make that captive. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:05] Brother Brown was asked, "How do I know
[1:29:07] I'm thinking God's thoughts?" Well,
[1:29:08] God's thoughts are his word. Amen. Are
[1:29:10] you thinking this? Now, that doesn't
[1:29:12] mean you have to remember chapter and
[1:29:13] verse and all the punctuation,
[1:29:15] everything. That's right. But you got to
[1:29:16] think, is this does your thoughts in
[1:29:19] here make you scared? Does it make you
[1:29:22] terrified?
[1:29:24] Does it make you stressed? Does it make
[1:29:26] you anxious?
[1:29:28] Does it make you worry?
[1:29:31] If they do,
[1:29:33] not this.
[1:29:35] Amen. If it does, not this. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:39] Well, what if this? But I'm facing this
[1:29:41] thing and I don't know what's going to
[1:29:43] happen. Just put your commit your soul
[1:29:46] to the Lord and then whatever happens is
[1:29:50] is actually God's will for your life.
[1:29:53] Amen. It can be you're like you just you
[1:29:56] just take Joseph.
[1:29:58] Joseph he had dreams and in these dreams
[1:30:02] he had two dreams and basically the sum
[1:30:05] of the dreams was his family he'll
[1:30:06] become the head of his family. They'll
[1:30:07] all bow down and worship him and he's
[1:30:10] spiritual. God speaking to him in
[1:30:12] dreams. And so in his heart now he knows
[1:30:15] this is going to happen.
[1:30:17] But where does he find himself? He finds
[1:30:20] himself sold by his own brothers who are
[1:30:22] meant to bow down and worship him. And
[1:30:24] he's been taken down to Egypt as a
[1:30:26] slave. He is in his mind going the
[1:30:28] opposite direction to what he thinks he
[1:30:31] should be going. That's right. Amen. But
[1:30:34] that was God's perfect will for his
[1:30:36] life. Amen. Think about it. That was
[1:30:38] God's perfect will for his life. And
[1:30:40] then he and then he's bought by
[1:30:41] Potterer, which is the captain of the
[1:30:44] guard. He's over Piper's house. He's
[1:30:46] thinking now must be getting close.
[1:30:48] There we go. Because he never forgot
[1:30:50] about it. But then he finds himself.
[1:30:52] Part of his wife wants to commit
[1:30:54] adultery with him. He of course denies
[1:30:56] her. And then part of his wife tells a
[1:30:59] lie. He's thrown into prison. Now he's
[1:31:02] in a worse estate, right? And he
[1:31:04] languishes there. And then now the
[1:31:07] butler and the baker come in. They have
[1:31:09] dreams and the Lord that same that gift
[1:31:13] is in Joseph and that same gift now
[1:31:15] works in their lives. He tells them
[1:31:18] exactly what's going to happen. And it
[1:31:20] happened exactly that way. And then
[1:31:22] Joseph says to the butler, when you go
[1:31:24] back to your position as the butler for
[1:31:27] Pharaoh, tell Pharaoh, remember me in
[1:31:29] prison cuz I'm here under false
[1:31:33] charges. What happens? The butler
[1:31:35] forgets
[1:31:37] because now he would think, "I'm gonna
[1:31:38] get out of here. This is all going to
[1:31:40] work out." Now's the time. He's gonna go
[1:31:43] because he's so excited because I told
[1:31:45] him what the dream was. He's going to
[1:31:46] tell Pharaoh and then probably tomorrow,
[1:31:48] tomorrow morning, I'm going to be out of
[1:31:50] here. And tomorrow morning comes and
[1:31:53] he's still there. Two years later, I
[1:31:56] think it's about that. You go read the
[1:31:57] story. It's a long time. About two years
[1:31:59] later, Pharaoh has a dream. And then the
[1:32:02] butler remembers
[1:32:05] Why did why did Joseph have to go
[1:32:07] through these great valleys of life?
[1:32:09] Because he had to be ready. He had to
[1:32:12] have the character.
[1:32:14] Amen. That when his brothers were there.
[1:32:18] Amen. He didn't get revenge on him. I
[1:32:21] mean I mean upon them. Because you see
[1:32:23] some you see you see like children, you
[1:32:26] know, sibling wrongs one and that other
[1:32:29] sibling I'm going to but they did this
[1:32:32] to me and and they want the full
[1:32:34] strength of the law. Daddy throw the
[1:32:37] book at them pretty much sometimes, you
[1:32:40] know. But the but Joseph had the
[1:32:42] character he could actually see. That's
[1:32:44] right. I was a slave and I was in
[1:32:47] prison. All this that your lives would
[1:32:51] be saved. Amen. Amen. But he had to go,
[1:32:55] remember he was dust,
[1:32:58] but then he had to come to his position,
[1:32:59] his right hand of Pharaoh.
[1:33:02] You see? And God used that road.
[1:33:06] Amen. For him to come to his position.
[1:33:10] You following me? And it's the same
[1:33:12] thing with us.
[1:33:14] Why Why is my life going sideways? I
[1:33:17] I've committed it to the Lord. God
[1:33:19] wanted you to go down that way. That's
[1:33:21] right. Amen. God ordained your steps.
[1:33:25] And it doesn't really at the end of the
[1:33:27] day, it doesn't matter where your steps
[1:33:28] go.
[1:33:30] If he's taken you by the hand and says,
[1:33:31] "Now we're going." He doesn't let you
[1:33:34] go. Amen. Amen. But you have to be
[1:33:37] willing to trust him as he takes you
[1:33:40] because it's not just a straight
[1:33:42] highway,
[1:33:44] 100 miles heaven, right? Straight. No
[1:33:48] offramps.
[1:33:50] It's a rugged way.
[1:33:53] Amen. And it's a walk of faith. You
[1:33:56] know, if we knew if I knew what was
[1:33:58] going to happen to me in the next
[1:33:59] however long we had till the rapture. Do
[1:34:02] you think Do you think you'd want to
[1:34:03] know?
[1:34:05] You'd be scared. You mean I got to face
[1:34:07] that? I've got to do then this has and
[1:34:09] I've got to do this. Some of us like I
[1:34:11] want to know. But you know if we sat
[1:34:14] Joseph down now Joseph you've had these
[1:34:17] dreams in a month's time you're going to
[1:34:19] be a slave in Egypt. Before that your
[1:34:22] brothers are going to want to kill you
[1:34:23] but one of them intercedes for you and
[1:34:25] they sell you. Then this is going to
[1:34:27] happen. They're going to be in prison
[1:34:28] and this and you think he'd want to know
[1:34:31] that. Do you think if you sat Brother
[1:34:33] Barham down? Now the angel of the Lord
[1:34:36] is called you know you know I know how
[1:34:38] how young before he starts out maybe 15
[1:34:40] because you know what am I going to do
[1:34:41] when I grow up okay this is what's going
[1:34:43] to happen William Brandon uh so you're
[1:34:46] going to you the Lord's going to call
[1:34:48] you but you're going to turn down the
[1:34:50] call to go on the you know field and
[1:34:54] your wife which is that girl over there
[1:34:57] by the way and your daughter Sharon Rose
[1:34:59] is going to die and then this is going
[1:35:01] to happen and there's going to be a
[1:35:02] flood and you're going to lose your
[1:35:03] brother and and your father and all
[1:35:05] these things and you're going to go to
[1:35:06] South Africa and you're going to you
[1:35:07] know all this hardship and you're going
[1:35:08] to get a neighbors and you're going to
[1:35:09] die and what you know I mean and all
[1:35:11] these things going to happen you think
[1:35:12] he'd want to know that and you think oh
[1:35:15] do I have to go through those things he
[1:35:18] had
[1:35:19] to yeah and then if your life was laid
[1:35:21] out in front of you think I don't want
[1:35:23] to do this you know brother saw it's
[1:35:26] it's so this is not in word for word but
[1:35:28] he said he said you know he could see a
[1:35:29] trial coming up and the Lord said you
[1:35:31] want to bypass it he said no lord
[1:35:34] He just surrendered himself to the will
[1:35:35] of God.
[1:35:37] Because you know, God doesn't just sit
[1:35:40] there and say, "I'm sick of you lot. I'm
[1:35:43] going to I'm going to deal with you."
[1:35:45] That's right. See how you like it. He
[1:35:48] doesn't. That That's not how he works.
[1:35:50] He doesn't work that way. He has your
[1:35:52] best interest in mind.
[1:35:54] Amen. He has your soul in mind. Amen.
[1:35:57] It's just like last Sunday I said about
[1:35:59] why the shepherd breaks the sheep's leg
[1:36:01] to get its attention. And then brother
[1:36:04] brother um brother Steven Havvey you
[1:36:08] know he's a farmer sheep farmer and he
[1:36:10] says well we don't really understand
[1:36:11] that in this country but over in the
[1:36:13] Middle East there were lions and bears
[1:36:17] and wolves and there's jackals and all
[1:36:18] kinds of things. If that sheep just
[1:36:20] strays off it's lunch.
[1:36:24] Amen. That's why you think well it's
[1:36:26] pretty drastic but the life of the sheep
[1:36:29] is preserved.
[1:36:31] Amen. Amen. And Lord, if if things have
[1:36:33] to get drastic, I don't want to be dead
[1:36:36] eternally. That's right. Amen. Amen. Or
[1:36:40] it's drastic. What's heaven or hell?
[1:36:42] That's right. And God wants you in
[1:36:45] heaven. Amen. And it's not his opinion.
[1:36:47] Oh, yes, they'll get there. Maybe they
[1:36:48] won't get there. He won't lose one. He
[1:36:51] won't lose part of himself. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:54] He can't. Why didn't Adam say to God,
[1:36:57] "Well, Eve, I mean, you like say to Eve,
[1:37:00] "Sorry, it didn't work out. How dare
[1:37:02] you? You cheated on me. How dare you,
[1:37:05] God? Get rid of it. I want a new one."
[1:37:07] He couldn't do it. Not because he wasn't
[1:37:10] another woman upon the earth. Because he
[1:37:12] had no more feminine part of himself.
[1:37:15] Remember, because that, remember, Adam
[1:37:16] was male and female spirit put in a man.
[1:37:20] And then when Eve was made out of a rib,
[1:37:23] that feminine part of the spirit was put
[1:37:24] in the woman. So he didn't have another
[1:37:27] woman part.
[1:37:30] Amen. So he and he
[1:37:32] knew, you know, you know, he says here
[1:37:35] in Genesis, you are bone of my bone,
[1:37:37] flesh of my flesh. You shall be called
[1:37:38] woman because you came out of me.
[1:37:42] Amen.
[1:37:43] And so he couldn't lose part of himself.
[1:37:47] Amen. Amen. Multiply that by 10 billion
[1:37:50] billion infinities. God can't lose part
[1:37:53] of himself. Amen. You understand? God
[1:37:56] can't lose you.
[1:37:58] He can't. That is one thing God cannot
[1:38:00] do. He cannot lose one of his own. Amen.
[1:38:03] And he will not lose one of his own.
[1:38:07] Amen. But now you just have to have a
[1:38:09] revelation when you see someone you're
[1:38:12] praying for. Amen.
[1:38:14] Remember, I don't want to just pray for
[1:38:17] people that they become foolish virgins
[1:38:19] or maybe a friend of the bride. I want
[1:38:21] people to go on a rapture.
[1:38:23] Now, God puts people God's grace and
[1:38:26] mercy is greater than just in and out.
[1:38:29] Amen. There'll be a lot of people there
[1:38:32] that you'll think, why is that guy
[1:38:33] there? But then, you know, if someone's
[1:38:35] done, you know, God's grace is so
[1:38:37] amazing. You think you're, you know, I
[1:38:41] think so. My grandparents, now this is
[1:38:43] just me. My, my, my mom's parents lived
[1:38:45] next door to us growing up in Gisbet.
[1:38:47] They were Catholic. She was Catholic. My
[1:38:49] my my grandma's Catholic. Granddad, I
[1:38:52] think he was just didn't care about
[1:38:54] religion. And my great uncles or his
[1:38:56] brother lived with them as well. He
[1:38:57] never married. But they they looked
[1:38:59] after us when we could not look after
[1:39:02] ourselves.
[1:39:04] You understand?
[1:39:06] So we are the word. We are the word made
[1:39:09] flesh. Yeah. The bride is the word.
[1:39:11] Amen. Yeah.
[1:39:13] So I could say this when just say this
[1:39:16] is me as a baby. When I could not look
[1:39:18] after myself, they looked after me.
[1:39:22] Yeah. They protected me when I could not
[1:39:24] protect myself.
[1:39:27] Now I I believe this is me. I believe
[1:39:29] God will attribute that as righteousness
[1:39:31] for them because they looked after
[1:39:35] They didn't understand what they had,
[1:39:38] but they loved me and looked after me
[1:39:40] when I could not look after myself. God
[1:39:42] is not an unjust judge.
[1:39:45] Amen. And people lived in former ages,
[1:39:48] God will be God will hold them
[1:39:50] accountable for what they knew.
[1:39:53] Amen. Because do you think it's going to
[1:39:54] be people come to white throne
[1:39:56] judgment and uh and then God says, "I
[1:40:00] sent Malachi 4. He was alive when you
[1:40:02] were alive."
[1:40:04] what did you do about it? And then the
[1:40:06] people say, I never heard about it. They
[1:40:09] say, I don't care. Go to outer darkness.
[1:40:11] He's not going to do that.
[1:40:14] No sensible judge would do that. You
[1:40:17] understand?
[1:40:18] God will judge those people for what
[1:40:21] they are faithful to. Yes. Amen. You
[1:40:24] understand? Amen. Yeah. Because you
[1:40:26] think because go if God is just, he
[1:40:29] won't he won't hold it against them.
[1:40:32] Amen. But I never heard it, Lord. Too
[1:40:35] bad. He's not going to say too bad.
[1:40:39] Amen. You understand? Amen. So
[1:40:43] now, we do not wrestle. So, I'm going to
[1:40:45] go back. So, I don't know how I went
[1:40:46] down that rabbit hole, but here we are.
[1:40:48] We're going down the other end. But you
[1:40:50] understand God is just. And whatever's
[1:40:53] happened, like I can't you can't pray,
[1:40:56] Lord, take my uh lost loved ones and
[1:41:00] make them saved.
[1:41:02] Now, you can't do that. They've gone out
[1:41:04] of your hands. You can't change the
[1:41:07] past. You just have to rest and walk on
[1:41:09] with God. That's right. Amen. Don't
[1:41:12] worry about them. And if you really do
[1:41:14] worry about them, you say, "Lord, make
[1:41:16] me one of your bride."
[1:41:19] Because the bride stands with the groom
[1:41:20] in judgment.
[1:41:22] Amen. You want to help them. You
[1:41:25] understand? Now, forgive me if I'm
[1:41:27] leaning too far one way, but if you want
[1:41:28] to help them, you become you say, "Lord,
[1:41:31] make me in your image. Make me one with
[1:41:33] you." Amen. Is that okay? Because you
[1:41:37] can't change the past. Some people say,
[1:41:38] "It's not fair. Why did this person hear
[1:41:40] this? And why did this person?" You
[1:41:42] can't change the past. And Joseph could
[1:41:44] have gone, "Why did I go to prison? Why
[1:41:46] was I a slave? Why did this happen?" He
[1:41:48] couldn't change the past. You got to
[1:41:50] make peace with your past. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:54] Legion, you know, Legion, he ended up
[1:41:57] with thousand odd devils in him. Yeah.
[1:42:01] But it just started with a little semi-
[1:42:03] innocent looking thing.
[1:42:05] Amen. And many times because you see
[1:42:09] demon possession, sometimes they're
[1:42:10] normal, sometimes they're not normal
[1:42:13] because the enemy just comes in, gets a
[1:42:15] hold and then lets go. Gets a hold
[1:42:17] because it's just they're a whipping
[1:42:19] boy. You understand? So sometimes he
[1:42:21] came to himself. Remember, God gave him
[1:42:24] grace for him to come to himself when
[1:42:26] Jesus stepped there. And they came
[1:42:28] running to the one that could deliver
[1:42:30] him.
[1:42:31] Amen. And the Lord cast them out. Amen.
[1:42:34] But you see, it would have started with
[1:42:36] such a seemingly innocent thing. Amen.
[1:42:39] Amen. But
[1:42:41] Legion, you know, sometimes we look at
[1:42:43] the negative so much. Why did I have to
[1:42:46] do this? Why did I go down this way? Why
[1:42:48] did this happen?
[1:42:50] Just just don't look at that. Look at
[1:42:53] Thank you, Lord. I'm free.
[1:42:55] Amen. You know, if we were all slaves,
[1:42:59] you know, living in America, whatever
[1:43:00] more, and then we heard the proclamation
[1:43:02] of emancipation, now you're free. You
[1:43:05] just say, "Rejoice. Thank you. I'm
[1:43:06] free." And you walk out. And you just
[1:43:08] enjoy your freedom. Let's just enjoy our
[1:43:11] freedom. Amen. Let's just enjoy our
[1:43:13] liberty in Christ. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:43:15] Amen. Amen. Is that so bad? Oh, but why
[1:43:18] did I have to do that? God, the
[1:43:20] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:43:24] of the Lord.
[1:43:27] Amen. And God in his great thinking, you
[1:43:30] always were what? Were righteous.
[1:43:32] Remember they that he called, he's also
[1:43:35] justified. They that he's justified,
[1:43:37] he's also glorified already. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:41] You just had to come to realization when
[1:43:44] the word came your way that he opened up
[1:43:47] your eyes of understanding. Then you
[1:43:48] called out to him, but it's already a
[1:43:50] finished work. It's already a finished
[1:43:52] work. It's not Lord, he's already saved
[1:43:55] you. He's already redeemed you. He's
[1:43:58] already done it. When he said those
[1:44:00] words, it is finished. He wasn't talking
[1:44:03] about his earthly life. He said, I've
[1:44:05] paid the price in full. Now, I'm just
[1:44:07] going to enjoy 2,000 years of of casting
[1:44:12] the devil out of every believer's life,
[1:44:14] and I'm just going to see my victory
[1:44:16] lived out. Amen. And here we are seeing
[1:44:18] the victory lived out. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:44:21] Amen. And so
[1:44:23] now, the weapons of our warfare are not.
[1:44:25] Okay. So, just just just just anchor it.
[1:44:28] Now, the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:44:31] ordered of the Lord. What's it mean to
[1:44:32] be ordered? Well, now you're going to
[1:44:34] walk here. Then you go here and then
[1:44:36] you're going to go here and then you go
[1:44:37] here. Your whole walk is arranged. The
[1:44:40] path you take is all arranged by God.
[1:44:42] It's ordered.
[1:44:44] Amen. But you just have to have peace in
[1:44:46] your heart that God has ordained you to
[1:44:49] walk this way.
[1:44:52] Amen. And you could be like Joseph. You
[1:44:54] could be a slave. You could be like
[1:44:56] David. You could be on the run in your
[1:44:58] own kingdom. Amen. You could be like
[1:45:00] Moses, a runaway prophet on the back
[1:45:02] side of the desert. You know, you could
[1:45:05] be like Esther. She's an orphan in a
[1:45:08] foreign country. And she could think,
[1:45:10] "Why? Why am I Why am I this way? Why
[1:45:14] did I not go back?" You know, she was in
[1:45:17] Morai's
[1:45:18] house. The Jews had already gone back to
[1:45:21] rebuild the
[1:45:22] temple. Yep. They had already gone back,
[1:45:24] but they stayed in Babylon. And she
[1:45:27] could think, "Well, why am I here? Why
[1:45:29] did my parents have to die? Why did our
[1:45:32] forebears have to fall into idolatry and
[1:45:34] then God scattered them like he
[1:45:35] promised? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I'll
[1:45:38] tell you why. Because during a time of
[1:45:41] restoration, when the temple was being
[1:45:43] rebuilt and Jerusalem was being rebuilt,
[1:45:46] there had to be a little girl.
[1:45:49] Amen. Amen. Amen. A little girl and she
[1:45:53] had to be there in the capital of of of
[1:45:55] the kingdom. And there be had to be
[1:45:57] another queen who refused to listen to
[1:45:59] the king. and she was kicked out. But
[1:46:02] there had to be someone there
[1:46:05] that listened that that not only heard
[1:46:07] the proclamation, the king's looking for
[1:46:08] a new wife, but she had to step into
[1:46:11] that. Amen. And she listened to um was
[1:46:14] it Haggi or whatever his name was? The
[1:46:16] chamberlman.
[1:46:18] She had to have something in her that
[1:46:20] was willing to take what authority said.
[1:46:24] You following me? She had to be there.
[1:46:27] She had to have that kind of nature. And
[1:46:29] she had all those things because she was
[1:46:30] an orphan. Yeah. Amen. She had all those
[1:46:33] things because her parents died however
[1:46:35] way. So she could say, "Why me? Why me?
[1:46:38] Why me?" But then she came to a place
[1:46:40] she said, "Why not me? Why not?" Now,
[1:46:43] amen. You understand? She wasn't just,
[1:46:46] you know, we have to just her past was
[1:46:49] her footsteps were ordered.
[1:46:52] Yeah. Your footsteps are ordered. I'm
[1:46:54] laboring this because I feel it really
[1:46:56] needs to sink in a little bit for a few
[1:46:58] of us. Our footsteps are ordered. Thank
[1:47:00] you, Lord. Okay. Why did I have to come
[1:47:02] from South Africa to New Zealand? Your
[1:47:05] footsteps have been ordered. Amen. Why
[1:47:08] did my dad have to go to London to to to
[1:47:10] to find my mom and she's from New
[1:47:12] Zealand? I moved back down here and here
[1:47:14] I am. My footsteps have been ordered.
[1:47:16] Lord, Amen. Why did I have to go down to
[1:47:19] Christ Church and study and whatever
[1:47:20] more? My footsteps were ordered. Amen.
[1:47:23] Why are we in this little place called
[1:47:24] Wellington? Our footsteps are ordered.
[1:47:27] Amen. Amen. It is what it is. You got to
[1:47:31] just accept it for what it is. God's
[1:47:32] ordained it. Amen.
[1:47:35] Amen. But
[1:47:36] now, so we fight against not flesh and
[1:47:39] blood. Now, it says in in in Ephesians
[1:47:43] chapter
[1:47:44] 1, I just want to I want to show you
[1:47:46] this now just to go back to our heavenly
[1:47:48] places and then maybe I'll just close
[1:47:50] with this because I want to show you
[1:47:51] that the bride is taking her position
[1:47:54] now. God is placing you. Remember, I was
[1:47:57] I was so I was so blessed last night
[1:47:59] just thinking the world was without form
[1:48:01] and void. Darkness covered the face of
[1:48:04] the deep. The spirit of God moved upon
[1:48:06] the face of the waters and he said, "Let
[1:48:08] there be light." Hallelujah. And then
[1:48:10] when he had finished speaking, there was
[1:48:12] the man and the woman. God's over the
[1:48:14] earth, perfect creation. All because God
[1:48:17] was speaking. Hallelujah. And God spoken
[1:48:19] and made this. And amen. And God has
[1:48:22] spoken in this end time. He's moved over
[1:48:24] this chaos of the world. He said, "Let
[1:48:26] there be light." And God has spoken his
[1:48:28] word upon the earth. And he's taken you
[1:48:30] a bunch of dust. Amen. And elevated you
[1:48:33] to be the stars of God in your position.
[1:48:36] You got to look at what has this message
[1:48:38] done. Yes. I'm not a slave to sin
[1:48:40] anymore. I'm not a slave to darkness.
[1:48:42] But now it's under my feet. Amen. The
[1:48:45] devil, I'm not the devil's whipping boy.
[1:48:47] He's a trophy on my wall. Amen. And
[1:48:50] every other enemy that comes against me.
[1:48:51] I'm just I just need a bigger trophy
[1:48:53] room.
[1:48:55] Thank you, Lord. Honey, we got to
[1:48:56] renovate. Why is that? I killed this
[1:48:58] thing. Got killed the other day. Amen,
[1:49:00] Lord. Hallelujah. It's a big one. Look.
[1:49:01] Oh, that's big. Hallelujah.
[1:49:05] Amen. to God. We have trophy walls,
[1:49:08] friends. Do not be ashamed. People say,
[1:49:11] "Oh, you shouldn't glorify the past."
[1:49:14] Sure, don't glorify it, but say, "This
[1:49:16] is the way I walked. God set me free of
[1:49:19] this. Remember the same spirits that are
[1:49:22] the same evil spirits that fought
[1:49:24] against Adam and Eve, that fought
[1:49:27] against Israel, that fought against the
[1:49:29] early church, is fighting you." Amen.
[1:49:33] the same. You know, I remember being 18,
[1:49:36] 18, 19. I just thought, "My parents
[1:49:39] don't understand me." They were in
[1:49:41] America and some I was in New Zealand.
[1:49:42] They don't know what I'm going through.
[1:49:44] They don't understand. But the same
[1:49:46] spirits of rock and roll and drinking
[1:49:48] and all these different things that that
[1:49:51] I was fighting, they had fought. That's
[1:49:54] right. It just had been rebranded.
[1:49:56] That's right. You know how you know how
[1:49:58] companies they go through a rebranding?
[1:50:00] Oh, because we're changing our image. So
[1:50:03] it went from the Beatles to whatever
[1:50:06] more, you know, Rolling Stones. It just
[1:50:07] it just got rebranded.
[1:50:10] Amen. Just like that same spirit that's
[1:50:12] that was on Madonna went on Britney
[1:50:14] Spears and different artists and now is
[1:50:16] on whatever the latest That's right.
[1:50:18] Poor soul is that sold themselves for
[1:50:20] that thing, you know, and that's why,
[1:50:23] you know, people say, "Oh, what was a
[1:50:24] better winger? Is it John Kerwin or
[1:50:28] whoever?" You can't compare former
[1:50:31] sports stars to nowadays ones because
[1:50:35] the ability of the new ones is greater
[1:50:37] than the ones that was back there
[1:50:39] because but what happens is you see
[1:50:42] people see something and they want to
[1:50:44] become it and the anointing that was on
[1:50:45] them come upon them.
[1:50:50] You take, you know how, okay, praise God
[1:50:54] if you have no idea what I'm talking
[1:50:55] about, but there was a team called
[1:50:57] Leicester City in the Premier League in
[1:50:59] England. Yeah, right.
[1:51:01] Yeah, they won it this year, I think it
[1:51:04] was. Or they won some great big title.
[1:51:06] It was the longest
[1:51:07] shot from the beginning of the season to
[1:51:10] the end. They should never have won. It
[1:51:12] was the longest shot in history. And
[1:51:14] people are just amazed by it. Do you
[1:51:16] know why they won?
[1:51:18] Because at the start of the season, they
[1:51:20] go to a Buddhist
[1:51:22] temple and they get prayed for and the
[1:51:26] spirit in that religion goes upon them
[1:51:28] and me. That's why they won. It's not a
[1:51:31] flesh and blood thing.
[1:51:34] It's documented. I can I'll find the
[1:51:36] link. I'll send it to you. These
[1:51:38] Buddhist monks, they you prayed. What
[1:51:40] what would happen? An anointing came
[1:51:41] upon those people and they won the
[1:51:43] premiership.
[1:51:45] Oh, that's farfetched. No, it's not. Why
[1:51:47] do you think when people went to war,
[1:51:49] they'd make a sacrifice to their god and
[1:51:52] they would and they would pray and the
[1:51:54] priest or whoever it was or the shaman,
[1:51:56] whatever, they'd pray for the people
[1:51:57] before they went into war is because
[1:51:59] they're calling upon the spirit of their
[1:52:00] nation to anoint their warriors. Amen.
[1:52:03] That they do superhuman things in
[1:52:04] battle. Yeah. Many times they did. Yeah.
[1:52:09] Right. It's true. But you cannot compare
[1:52:14] John Alamu with whoever the winger is
[1:52:15] now or John Kerwin with you see John
[1:52:18] Kwin he had the fend John Lomu he had
[1:52:20] the fend the same f amen. Why? Because
[1:52:24] that same anointing that was upon him
[1:52:26] went upon John Lomu he was just a bigger
[1:52:28] stature. That's why he could do it
[1:52:29] greater. Yeah. That's right. Oh no.
[1:52:33] Yeah. It's exactly how it is.
[1:52:36] But because but the anointing has got
[1:52:38] greater. Yeah. You take the Beatles,
[1:52:40] these four men in suits.
[1:52:43] Amen. The anointing they released and
[1:52:46] look at where it's gone. You take
[1:52:49] Disney, the Mickey Mouse Club.
[1:52:54] What's her name? Christina Aguilera,
[1:52:56] Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears,
[1:53:00] Miley Cyrus, whatever she was in. Oh,
[1:53:03] it's Disney. Look at what they've
[1:53:05] become.
[1:53:08] Look at what they they all were in the
[1:53:10] Mickey well Miley Cyrus was Hannah
[1:53:13] Montana but all the others were in the
[1:53:15] Mickey Mouse club. Look at what they are
[1:53:18] now and I feel sorry for them because
[1:53:20] they're slaves. I'm not condemning them.
[1:53:23] They're slaves just like we were once
[1:53:25] slaves too. You see, but the anoint you
[1:53:29] see and the and the artists have gone
[1:53:32] worse and worse and worse. That's right.
[1:53:34] Why? Because the anointing's got greater
[1:53:36] and greater and greater. Amen. Amen. And
[1:53:38] so has the church. Amen. We are friends.
[1:53:43] The devil is defeated. Period. That's
[1:53:46] right. Amen. He is a bluff. And you've
[1:53:50] got to look at him as a bluff. Amen.
[1:53:52] Okay. He's a bluff. He's defeated.
[1:53:54] That's right. Amen. So when the enemy
[1:53:56] comes in like a flood, I'll raise up a
[1:53:58] standard. That's his promise. And what
[1:54:00] does he does? He anoints his children.
[1:54:02] Amen. to overcome the challenge of the
[1:54:04] age. Amen. So, we have what we need. We
[1:54:07] have the goods. Amen. I was driving
[1:54:08] home, was it last last night? Night
[1:54:10] before I said, "Thank you, Lord. The
[1:54:11] bride has the goods." Amen. Amen. We're
[1:54:13] not looking for a better weapon. We have
[1:54:15] the weapon. We're not looking for, you
[1:54:17] know, some, "Oh, I need a better armor
[1:54:19] and whatever more." You've got it.
[1:54:21] Hallelujah.
[1:54:23] I'm sorry, time's slipping away, but now
[1:54:25] he says in Ephesians
[1:54:27] 1, and we'll read verses 1 to three.
[1:54:33] Wait. Yes. I will keep reading down. Now
[1:54:35] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:54:37] will of God to the saints which at
[1:54:39] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:54:41] Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from
[1:54:43] God our father, pardon me, and from the
[1:54:45] Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God
[1:54:48] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:54:50] has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:54:53] blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[1:54:56] Amen. Now this heavenly places is the
[1:55:00] believer's position in Christ. But then
[1:55:03] if we go to it is the same
[1:55:06] word. It is the same word that's used in
[1:55:09] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse um let's
[1:55:12] just
[1:55:12] read verses 10 to
[1:55:15] 12. Remember the whole armor of God I'm
[1:55:18] not going to read it but the whole armor
[1:55:19] of God is combinated in prayer.
[1:55:23] It's not six things. It's seven. Yeah.
[1:55:25] It's prayer is the last part of the
[1:55:27] armor.
[1:55:29] Okay. And that is often the one that's
[1:55:31] most neglected.
[1:55:34] Okay. But he says, "Finally, my
[1:55:36] brethren, be strong in the Lord and the
[1:55:39] power of his might." Amen. Just be
[1:55:41] strong in the Lord and the power of his
[1:55:42] might. Put on the whole armor of God
[1:55:44] that ye may be able to stand against the
[1:55:46] ws of the devil. For we wrestle not
[1:55:48] against flesh and blood, but against
[1:55:51] principalities, against powers, against
[1:55:53] the rulers of the darkness of this
[1:55:55] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:55:58] high places. And that high places is the
[1:56:01] same word as heavenly places, which is a
[1:56:04] realm or an atmosphere, amen, that the
[1:56:06] believer lives in. So I said once upon a
[1:56:09] time, Adam and Eve, they operated out of
[1:56:11] this realm, but then sin came and
[1:56:13] they're alienated from it. And the devil
[1:56:16] because it was a coup basically. He took
[1:56:18] that position. That's why there's the
[1:56:20] storms. You know, that's why that's why
[1:56:22] we have the typhoons and all the storms
[1:56:24] and all these things that we have
[1:56:26] because once upon a time Adam said,
[1:56:28] "Peace be still." The second Adam did
[1:56:30] it. He's demonstrating what the first
[1:56:31] Adam did. He was God over nature. Amen.
[1:56:34] And on the on the storm that day on the
[1:56:37] sea, there was a clash of sea. Who
[1:56:39] really nature belongs to? Was it 10,000
[1:56:42] devils that swore they had drowned Jesus
[1:56:44] in the boat or or was it the second
[1:56:47] Adam? And so there was a clash and
[1:56:50] they're both fighting. And what did
[1:56:51] Jesus do? He just said, "Peace be
[1:56:53] still." Amen. Amen. And nature had to
[1:56:56] obey him because he was the creator.
[1:56:59] That's right. Do you understand? And
[1:57:01] it's the same thing with us. That same
[1:57:03] power. Oh man. That same God is in you.
[1:57:09] Amen. So, so now Jesus operated out of
[1:57:12] that realm, heavenly places. Amen. And,
[1:57:15] and he had dominion over everything and
[1:57:17] not just everything in this world, but
[1:57:18] in the next world. And then now there's
[1:57:22] a people upon the earth that he has to
[1:57:24] lift up into that same realm. Are you
[1:57:27] following me? So, once upon a time, we
[1:57:29] were dust. Amen. Yeah. Once upon a time,
[1:57:31] we're children of dust. But then God
[1:57:33] comes upon the scene and now our
[1:57:36] position in Christ, we have to take our
[1:57:38] position. But there squatters in the
[1:57:40] land. Amen. You understand? Just like
[1:57:42] the promised land. As I said a while
[1:57:44] ago, there were enemy nations in the
[1:57:46] land that had no right to be in that
[1:57:48] promised land. And they had to be driven
[1:57:50] out. Amen. So that's why you got to cast
[1:57:52] down Satan. Amen. Amen. We are the
[1:57:55] people that cast down Satan. You
[1:57:57] following me? Amen. We are because you
[1:58:00] have to drive out the inhabitants of
[1:58:01] your inheritance and you have to take
[1:58:04] your position. Amen. And we're living in
[1:58:07] an age, friends, where we're not like in
[1:58:09] the book of Judges where they couldn't
[1:58:10] take the whole land. That is not our
[1:58:13] time. Our time when David comes upon the
[1:58:17] throne, they take the full expanse of
[1:58:19] the promised land. They take what Moses
[1:58:22] said they would inherit. When David
[1:58:24] comes upon the throne, amen,
[1:58:27] he is Jesus is our king, is he not? He's
[1:58:31] the king of saints. Amen. Amen. And he
[1:58:34] is here present to see that each and
[1:58:37] every one of us take the full promised
[1:58:39] land. Amen. Amen. So
[1:58:43] now it is the believer's position in
[1:58:47] Christ. So
[1:58:49] now this word high places, heavenly
[1:58:52] places. I'll be done soon. I'm about to
[1:58:54] close. It is it is it means the sky or
[1:58:59] by expansion heaven as the abode of God
[1:59:01] or by by implication happiness power
[1:59:04] eternity or specifically the gospel.
[1:59:08] Amen. So we're called to take our
[1:59:11] position.
[1:59:13] But the devil, you have to cast the
[1:59:15] devil down. Amen. Because he's a
[1:59:17] squatter. Remember, he's defeated, but
[1:59:20] he's a squatter. What is a squatter? A
[1:59:22] squatter is someone who lives in a place
[1:59:24] they have no legal right to be. Amen. So
[1:59:28] if an enemy, if the devil comes into
[1:59:30] your house, Amen. If the devil comes
[1:59:33] into your house, maybe through your
[1:59:35] children or through something else, you
[1:59:37] got to look that thing in the eyes and
[1:59:38] say, "Devil, you have no right in my
[1:59:41] house."
[1:59:42] Amen. And let perfect love cast it out.
[1:59:44] But don't live with it. You don't have
[1:59:46] to live with it. Amen. Amen. Don't make
[1:59:49] it welcome. And that doesn't mean you
[1:59:51] read them the right act. Now look here,
[1:59:53] boy. I'm going to deal with you and you
[1:59:55] know you listen to me. No. But you have
[1:59:58] no right to live with it. Perfect love
[2:00:00] casts out Satan.
[2:00:02] Amen. Love has to be projected. But that
[2:00:05] doesn't mean in prayer you just, you
[2:00:06] know, you just you fight for every inch
[2:00:09] of ground. Amen. Amen. And just take off
[2:00:12] Satan's head. Don't play nice with them.
[2:00:15] Push the button. Push the nuclear
[2:00:17] button. Amen. Don't go don't fire a pot
[2:00:19] shot. Just go nuclear on them. You
[2:00:22] understand? Yeah. Amen. You have to
[2:00:24] pray. You have the power to loosen the
[2:00:27] power to bind. Yes, sir. You have the
[2:00:29] power to loosen the power of the bind.
[2:00:31] But it's up to you to use that power.
[2:00:32] Amen. Don't just sit there. Oh, God,
[2:00:34] help me. Help me. Help me. As I said on
[2:00:37] Wednesday, Moses Moses prophesied, you
[2:00:40] see these Egyptians, they're by the Red
[2:00:41] Sea. He says, you see these Egyptians,
[2:00:44] you'll no lot. You will not see them
[2:00:45] anymore after this day. He prophesied
[2:00:48] it. And then God says to him, "Why? Why
[2:00:50] are you crying? Speak and move forward."
[2:00:53] So here he was out of his lips was now,
[2:00:55] "You see these guys, you won't see them
[2:00:56] now forever." He's prophesying their
[2:00:59] doom. And then he But then he's crying
[2:01:01] to God, "Help us." And God says to him,
[2:01:03] "Why are you crying? Speak." Amen. Move
[2:01:06] forward. Amen. Amen. I've ordained you
[2:01:08] to come down to this place by the Red
[2:01:09] Sea. Amen. You I told you to come here
[2:01:11] and you're here. Not only that, but the
[2:01:14] pillar of fire and everything was was
[2:01:15] between the enemy and them.
[2:01:18] Amen. But he got worried. Oh, what are
[2:01:21] we going to do?
[2:01:23] Speak and move forward.
[2:01:25] So, but it's up to you. Remember, the
[2:01:27] sword is in your hand. The sword is in
[2:01:30] your mouth. Yo, you have the sword. You
[2:01:33] have the faith to yield that sword.
[2:01:36] Remember, the devil doesn't have a
[2:01:38] weapon. Have you realized this? This is
[2:01:40] not some sword jewel where he has a
[2:01:43] weapon, you have a weapon.
[2:01:45] You actually have to recognize he's
[2:01:47] disarmed. Amen. Amen. Brother Bam said
[2:01:50] on Calvary, God broke the back of Satan.
[2:01:54] Have you ever seen an animal with a
[2:01:55] broken back? Can they run? Can they
[2:01:58] jump? Can they say, "I'm going to do all
[2:01:59] these things? They're squirming on the
[2:02:02] ground in
[2:02:03] pain, thrashing
[2:02:06] about." Yeah, that is Satan.
[2:02:10] Amen. Our opponent is defeated. You have
[2:02:13] to cast them down. God wants you to take
[2:02:15] the sword. Remember, it's not just him
[2:02:18] to do the battle. God is saying to
[2:02:20] Satan, you see the You see the sons and
[2:02:23] daughters of the dust. I'm going to step
[2:02:25] into them. I'm going to speak my word
[2:02:28] out of them. Even in these fallen
[2:02:31] bodies, they'll be victorious over you.
[2:02:34] Over everything, they're going to be
[2:02:36] victorious. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And
[2:02:39] then, and has he not done it? Amen. Have
[2:02:42] you not seen Have you not seen victory
[2:02:44] over Satan? Who's seen victory over
[2:02:46] Satan? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[2:02:51] why he wants you. Don't listen to your
[2:02:54] discouragement.
[2:02:56] Don't listen to what you see. That's
[2:02:57] right. Don't listen to what you think is
[2:02:59] going on. Amen. You look at this. Amen.
[2:03:02] Oh, but I feel so weak in faith. Forget
[2:03:05] your feelings.
[2:03:07] Hallelujah. Brother Brand says, if you
[2:03:09] have a shadow of the power of God in
[2:03:11] you,
[2:03:12] You can basically do all things. A
[2:03:14] shadow of the power of God. I don't know
[2:03:16] how you put that on a scale, but that's
[2:03:18] pretty low. Who's got a shadow? I say,
[2:03:20] "Praise God. I've got a shadow of the
[2:03:22] power of God. I can do all things
[2:03:24] through Christ." Oh, your faith is weak.
[2:03:26] But I've got faith. Amen. Amen. It's
[2:03:30] been revealed to me what I am. Amen. Son
[2:03:32] and daughter of the King. Amen. Not a
[2:03:34] slave anymore. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:37] Amen. You are what you are. Amen. You
[2:03:39] can't Don't be all bashful. Well, no, I
[2:03:41] don't feel that way. You know, just
[2:03:44] like, well, they never said it. But
[2:03:45] imagine Anelise wakes up one morning.
[2:03:47] She says, "Daddy, I don't feel like I'm
[2:03:49] your daughter
[2:03:50] anymore." Say, "Okay, let's go take a
[2:03:52] blood test. You don't understand DNA,
[2:03:54] but we're going to prove that you're my
[2:03:55] daughter." Amen. You know, and then we
[2:03:57] Oh, they match. What does that mean?
[2:04:00] You're I'm your dad. Yeah. Amen. But I
[2:04:03] don't feel I don't feel like I'm But you
[2:04:05] are. Doesn't matter what you feel like,
[2:04:07] honey. You're my daughter. Amen.
[2:04:10] Amen.
[2:04:12] I don't feel like I'm a son of
[2:04:15] Get rid of that. Amen.
[2:04:18] Satan, because Satan wants to take
[2:04:20] dominion over you again. Amen. And if he
[2:04:22] can, he will. That's right. Remember I
[2:04:25] said in the beginning, he doesn't just
[2:04:26] throw up a white flag and quit. You've
[2:04:28] got a battle. You say, "Well, there's so
[2:04:30] many enemies to fight." I just think of
[2:04:32] this, you know, like uh Brother Isaac's
[2:04:34] Hezekiah song. You just think about it.
[2:04:37] The more enemies there are means you
[2:04:39] cannot miss one when you swing your
[2:04:41] weapon. You got to hit something. That's
[2:04:43] right. It's just easier to do. Goliath
[2:04:45] was so big. David couldn't miss.
[2:04:48] Amen. Some people, oh, he's such a
[2:04:50] giant. David just says, I can't miss
[2:04:52] that guy. I'm glad he's not some little
[2:04:54] coyote or something. I can't miss him.
[2:04:55] His head's too fat. Hallelujah. It just
[2:04:59] But it's how you look at the enemy. How
[2:05:01] do you look at him? I think he's just
[2:05:03] too big to miss. There's so many of
[2:05:04] them. Well, I'm going to hit something
[2:05:05] when I swing. I just need to swing.
[2:05:08] Amen.
[2:05:11] I'm going to read one thing that I'm
[2:05:12] going to close.
[2:05:15] Possessing. I didn't even get into
[2:05:16] really I wanted to get into No, actually
[2:05:19] I want to read this. No, I got to get
[2:05:22] this through. Now we Now our opening No,
[2:05:24] no. Our opening scripture was thy seed
[2:05:27] shall possess the gates of thy enemy.
[2:05:29] Yep. And then now when Rebecca has made
[2:05:32] her decision that she's going to go to
[2:05:34] Isaac, they give her this blessing. They
[2:05:37] said that in
[2:05:39] blessing.
[2:05:42] Wait
[2:05:45] three. Galatians 22:17 I think it
[2:05:49] is. Yes. That in blessing I'll bless
[2:05:53] thee and in multip No, that's the wrong
[2:05:56] scripture. Let's just go to the book of
[2:05:58] Genesis.
[2:06:03] Genesis
[2:06:06] 24:60. And they blessed Rebecca. Now
[2:06:09] listen to this. And they blessed
[2:06:11] Rebecca, and said unto her, Thou art our
[2:06:16] sister. Be thou the mother of thousands
[2:06:18] of millions, and let thy seed possess
[2:06:21] the gates of those which hate them, the
[2:06:24] enemy. Now notice there they do not know
[2:06:27] God has given that blessing to Abraham.
[2:06:30] Remember because Isaac is the son of
[2:06:32] Abraham by default that blessing rests
[2:06:34] upon him. Amen. But because Rebecca is
[2:06:38] part of him then by inspiration they
[2:06:42] blessed her with the same blessing Isaac
[2:06:43] has.
[2:06:45] You following me? The same blessing.
[2:06:47] They remember they did not know Abraham
[2:06:50] was blessed that way. They're under
[2:06:52] inspiration sending off their daughter.
[2:06:54] Let thy seed uh possess the gates of
[2:06:57] those that hate them. Possess the gates
[2:06:58] of the enemy. Amen. And it's because
[2:07:03] now it's because Rebecca was part of
[2:07:06] Isaac. And when you bless I was just
[2:07:08] thinking like a baby dedication.
[2:07:10] Normally when you think of names, you
[2:07:12] look at the meaning of the name and you
[2:07:14] name the child with that kind of name
[2:07:15] because you want the qualities of that
[2:07:18] name to be lived in the child. Yeah.
[2:07:21] It's the same thing with the blessing.
[2:07:22] You're actually asking, "Lord, may what
[2:07:24] I'm asking be in the child." You
[2:07:27] following me? So now when they were
[2:07:29] blessing Rebecca, they were believing
[2:07:31] that that ability that her seed will
[2:07:34] possess the gates of the enemy was
[2:07:36] already in her. You see, because I have
[2:07:41] characteristics. The only way my
[2:07:43] children can receive those
[2:07:44] characteristics is if they receive them
[2:07:46] from me when it comes to my nature.
[2:07:48] Because our nature is built in. That's
[2:07:49] right. Amen. is like I am a product of
[2:07:53] my parents. I can't help it. I can't
[2:07:56] change it without the new birth.
[2:07:59] Hallelujah.
[2:08:00] Amen. But but they're built in these
[2:08:03] things. And so when when when they are
[2:08:05] blessing Rebecca, they are actually
[2:08:08] asking or seeing that that ability to
[2:08:10] possess the gates of the enemy is in her
[2:08:13] because how could it be in her seed if
[2:08:15] it's not in her? Are you following me?
[2:08:17] And so if that is the if that is the
[2:08:20] shadow, how much more the reality?
[2:08:23] Because remember Isaac is Christ and
[2:08:24] Rebecca is you. Amen. So when God looks
[2:08:28] at you, he's saying that there's a
[2:08:29] there's an ability in you to possess the
[2:08:31] gates of the enemy.
[2:08:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Because we are
[2:08:36] the seed of Abraham according to faith.
[2:08:39] Amen. You understand? So you got
[2:08:41] something in you to possess the gates.
[2:08:43] Oh, I need help, Lord. He says, I've
[2:08:46] already given. You've been born with it.
[2:08:48] Yeah. Amen. Amen. You don't need to try
[2:08:51] and work it out. You're born with it. If
[2:08:54] you've been born again, it's come to
[2:08:56] life.
[2:08:58] That means you can possess the gates of
[2:08:59] anything.
[2:09:01] Hallelujah. Now, I'll just read this
[2:09:03] quickly. He says this is in thy seed
[2:09:06] shall pos um shall possess the gates of
[2:09:08] his enemy. In 59, you shall possess the
[2:09:11] gate of every enemy. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:14] shall not maybe shall. Amen. What does
[2:09:17] that mean? You you take your position in
[2:09:19] heavenly places and everything is under
[2:09:21] your feet.
[2:09:23] Though it's been 2,000 years ago, God
[2:09:26] fulfilled his
[2:09:31] promise. No, sorry. Oh, yes. Though it's
[2:09:36] been 2,000 years ago, God fulfilled his
[2:09:37] promise what Jesus said would take
[2:09:39] place. There's a modern Sodom. There's
[2:09:42] evangelists throughout the country.
[2:09:43] There's a church formal. There's a
[2:09:45] church spiritual. Watch those gifts
[2:09:46] working and the groups they're working
[2:09:48] in. God keeps his word. When the little
[2:09:51] fellow was born, God gave Abraham a
[2:09:54] double trial to prove that Abraham's
[2:09:56] seed is faithful. Told him to offer a
[2:09:58] son up. And you know the story when he
[2:10:01] went to kill him, there was a lamb
[2:10:02] bleeded in the wilderness behind him.
[2:10:04] And he offered the ram. It was a ram. It
[2:10:07] wasn't a vision. Blood don't run out of
[2:10:09] it. the blood don't run from a vision.
[2:10:11] He killed the ram for the ram spoke of
[2:10:14] Christ coming. Then when God seen that
[2:10:16] he had a man that he could put
[2:10:18] confidence in, he said, "I swore by
[2:10:20] myself. For a man always takes an oath
[2:10:23] to someone greater than he and no one
[2:10:27] was greater than God." So he swore by
[2:10:29] himself that the seed of Abraham would
[2:10:32] possess the gates of the enemy. Oh my,
[2:10:34] he swore it. God by himself swore that
[2:10:37] Abraham's seed would possess the gates
[2:10:38] of the enemy. Watch how he proved it.
[2:10:41] Rebecca going to be part of Isaac, which
[2:10:44] is a part of the seed also by the woman.
[2:10:46] And when her father and her brothers and
[2:10:48] her and her mother and her loved ones
[2:10:50] kindred believing in God um she um and
[2:10:55] and and she was put to a trial and when
[2:10:57] it come to the trial, they asked, "Will
[2:11:00] you go with this stranger or stay with
[2:11:01] us?" Her decision was quickly made
[2:11:03] clear-cut. That's the way God makes it
[2:11:05] fast and quick. I'll go, she said, not
[2:11:08] knowing where she was going, but by
[2:11:10] faith she went. And there was something
[2:11:13] within her begin to move. And she knew
[2:11:15] that God was in it. And when they set
[2:11:18] her up on the camel, they blessed her.
[2:11:20] Said, "Let thy seed be thousands of
[2:11:22] millions." Thousands of millions. God
[2:11:25] told Abraham, "Let the stars like like
[2:11:28] the stars of the heaven or the sand by
[2:11:30] the seashore." That's bringing in the
[2:11:32] Gentiles. That's the way the seed of
[2:11:34] Abraham would be. They also said, "Let
[2:11:37] thy seed possess the gates of its
[2:11:38] enemy." God promising through her,
[2:11:41] through Abraham, that the seed would
[2:11:43] possess the gate. And it will. As long
[2:11:45] as there is remaining seed of Abraham,
[2:11:48] that's speaking of you now. It'll
[2:11:50] possess the gate with the promise of God
[2:11:53] like Abraham did. It'll do it. When I
[2:11:56] when Israel was on the march and came to
[2:11:58] a land of Moab, there was a gate and
[2:12:00] they said, "You will not pass through."
[2:12:02] and they brought out their prophet to
[2:12:03] curse the people. Instead of cursing, he
[2:12:05] blessed. They tried to show him all the
[2:12:08] bad things that this people had done.
[2:12:10] But God showed him the good things about
[2:12:12] it. For he'd seen that smitten rock and
[2:12:15] that brass serpent going before making
[2:12:17] atonement for them. And instead of
[2:12:19] cursing, he blessed the seed, and they
[2:12:21] possessed the land because they were on
[2:12:24] their road keeping a promise of Jehovah.
[2:12:27] Nothing could stop them, for they were
[2:12:29] Abraham's seed with a promise that
[2:12:31] they'd possess the gate of every enemy.
[2:12:33] And they took it. Daniel, the seed of
[2:12:35] Abraham, was thrown into a fiery
[2:12:37] furnace, or I mean, sorry, or to a
[2:12:39] lion's den, pardon me. Daniel was thrown
[2:12:41] into a lion's den to be killed by a
[2:12:43] lion. And the angel of the Lord came
[2:12:45] that night and stopped the lion. No
[2:12:47] doubt it was that great pillar of fire
[2:12:49] that followed the children of Israel, an
[2:12:51] animal scared of a light. And when that
[2:12:54] big light stood there, the lion laid
[2:12:56] down. And Daniel possessed the gate of
[2:12:58] his enemy, closed the mouth of the lion,
[2:13:00] because he had God's promise, and he was
[2:13:02] Abraham's seed. The Hebrew children,
[2:13:04] when they was thrown into a fiery
[2:13:06] furnace, they possessed the gates of the
[2:13:08] furnace. And the son of God came down
[2:13:11] and took the fire off of them, and they
[2:13:14] possessed the gates of their enemy,
[2:13:16] Elijah. He was also a seed of Abraham.
[2:13:19] when the whole nation turned against
[2:13:21] him, the king, the queen, and everyone.
[2:13:23] Yet, he stood there on Mount Carmel on
[2:13:25] the promise of God and possessed the
[2:13:26] gates, the international gates of that
[2:13:28] country, he did it because he was
[2:13:30] Abraham's seed with Abra with God's
[2:13:32] promise. Amen. When Moses, the seed of
[2:13:35] Abraham, had went on went on a
[2:13:37] commission of God, keeping God's word,
[2:13:39] went down into Egypt, brought forth the
[2:13:42] people to take them to the promised
[2:13:44] land. The devil drawed a gate across
[2:13:46] them. There he was, surrounded by
[2:13:48] Pharaoh's army, backed into the Red Sea.
[2:13:50] But God caused a strong wind to start
[2:13:52] blowing. And they possessed the gate of
[2:13:55] the enemy because he blowed a dry streak
[2:13:57] across the sea. And they went on towards
[2:14:00] the promise walking on dry land because
[2:14:02] they was the seed of Abraham with a
[2:14:04] sworn promise. Thy seed shall possess
[2:14:07] the gate of the enemy. when they came
[2:14:09] out of the wilderness
[2:14:11] uh to go into Jordan, when God spoke to
[2:14:14] the famous Joshua and told Joshua to
[2:14:16] cross over to make the people ready, it
[2:14:19] was the month of April, a month of
[2:14:20] floods. The whole Jordan valleys were
[2:14:23] spread across. Looked like it was a poor
[2:14:26] strategy of God to bring them to that
[2:14:27] place. That old muddy Jordan, the worst
[2:14:30] time in the world when the river was at
[2:14:32] its highest. Usually God, listen,
[2:14:35] usually God gets you to the last end of
[2:14:37] the road, the last mile of the way, then
[2:14:40] he steps in. If you're a seed of
[2:14:42] Abraham, believe God and hold his
[2:14:45] promise for healing, for salvation, for
[2:14:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, whatever
[2:14:50] it is, whatever whatever enemy is, God
[2:14:54] lets you get some time right to the end
[2:14:56] of the road, and it looks worse than it
[2:14:59] ever did. The doctor said, "You you
[2:15:01] don't have a chance, but you're the seed
[2:15:04] of Abraham with a promise that you shall
[2:15:06] possess the gates of every enemy."
[2:15:09] Joshua didn't think how wide the Jordan
[2:15:11] was or how muddy it was. Said, "Gather
[2:15:13] yourselves together, sanctify yourself,
[2:15:16] and take the ark of God and go forward."
[2:15:18] And he possessed the gates of the enemy.
[2:15:19] Why? Because he was taking a promised
[2:15:22] people to a promised land by a promise
[2:15:25] of God and was the children of Abraham.
[2:15:28] He says that makes a Baptist feel like
[2:15:30] shouting. Abraham's seed shall pos shall
[2:15:32] possess the gates of the enemy. Yes, he
[2:15:35] crossed over the Jordan
[2:15:37] because they were the seed of Abraham.
[2:15:41] Amen. And we are the seed of Abraham
[2:15:43] according to faith. So therefore he see
[2:15:46] look brother linked it in. Now can we
[2:15:48] have some musicians to come because
[2:15:50] otherwise I'll
[2:15:52] I won't stop. But you see
[2:15:55] you see because they were the seed of
[2:15:56] Abraham. That's why they possess the
[2:15:58] gate of the enemy. You understand? And
[2:16:01] because we are the bride of Christ,
[2:16:04] which is the seed of Abraham according
[2:16:05] to the faith. Amen. We shall possess the
[2:16:09] gate of every enemy. Amen. Amen. We
[2:16:13] shall
[2:16:15] Amen.
[2:16:18] So it's not you do not do not do not
[2:16:22] entrust yourself in your humanity.
[2:16:25] Amen. This is not the seed of Abraham.
[2:16:29] It's it's this in here that's the seed
[2:16:30] of Abraham. And this is the thing you
[2:16:33] need to put confidence in. Amen. Amen.
[2:16:36] Because if it's in here, how do you know
[2:16:38] it's in here? You heard the word in your
[2:16:40] day. Amen. And it spoke to you like
[2:16:42] nothing else has. Amen. Amen. There's a
[2:16:45] deep calling to a deep or vice versa,
[2:16:48] whichever way. But you understand. And
[2:16:50] it's because of that, that's how you
[2:16:52] know you're a seed of Abraham. Amen. And
[2:16:55] then brother Bam says, "You know what
[2:16:56] conviction is? Sometimes just a funny
[2:16:57] feeling comes over you." That's how
[2:16:59] simple it can be. Just a real twinge
[2:17:01] that you know you're wrong. What's that?
[2:17:04] That's that seed of Abraham calling.
[2:17:06] Amen. Amen. I tell you, the day I just
[2:17:09] let go, I've never looked back. Amen.
[2:17:13] Amen. Amen. And I'll never regret it for
[2:17:15] a second. Amen.
[2:17:18] Hallelujah.
[2:17:20] Amen.
[2:17:22] We shall possess the gates of the enemy.
[2:17:24] That's right. That's why I say when the
[2:17:26] enemy comes into your home.
[2:17:28] Don't put up with them. Don't make him
[2:17:31] welcome. No. Amen. He tries to afflict
[2:17:34] you in here. Don't make him welcome.
[2:17:37] Don't entertain him. Don't give him a
[2:17:39] chair and a and a and a drink and
[2:17:40] something to eat. Amen. You take your
[2:17:43] gun.
[2:17:44] Oh, remember he's so big. He's You can't
[2:17:47] miss
[2:17:48] him. Even when you say car name aim,
[2:17:50] it's a
[2:17:51] shotgun. Just just fire in his general
[2:17:54] direction. Fire it in his general
[2:17:56] direction. It'll hit its target every
[2:17:58] time. Amen. This is a record of people
[2:18:03] taking God at his word and being
[2:18:04] victorious.
[2:18:06] Amen. You go from Calvary all the way
[2:18:08] down to now, there's been a record of
[2:18:09] people taking God at his word and being
[2:18:11] victorious. If it worked for them and
[2:18:13] they are the seed of Abraham, it has to
[2:18:15] work for us. Amen. Alba, I've been
[2:18:18] fighting this battle for a long time.
[2:18:20] Don't worry about how long you've been
[2:18:21] fighting. Remember, at the end of the
[2:18:23] day, there's like VE day and and victory
[2:18:25] over Japan day, all those things. You
[2:18:27] know, some people think, look at the
[2:18:29] great sacrifice. But when when when the
[2:18:31] announcement was
[2:18:32] sounded that that the enemy had had
[2:18:35] formally
[2:18:36] surrendered, they were just shouting and
[2:18:38] crying and rejoicing. We won the battle.
[2:18:42] Amen. Then sure, you can bring into
[2:18:44] account all the sacrifice and everything
[2:18:45] people gave. But when but when the
[2:18:47] announcement was sound, we've won.
[2:18:49] Hallelujah. We've won. Amen. They just
[2:18:52] rejoice because they won. Amen. Amen.
[2:18:55] It's the same thing. Oh, this battle's
[2:18:56] been going on for a long time, but
[2:18:58] you're on the winning side. Amen. Amen.
[2:19:01] You shall have the victory over it.
[2:19:03] Don't bear. It's been decades. So,
[2:19:08] Moses was was four decades in the
[2:19:10] wilderness. A long time. Some of us have
[2:19:13] not even been alive that long. That's
[2:19:15] right. He was he was four decades in the
[2:19:17] wilderness. But then one day, God came.
[2:19:19] Amen. Because he couldn't hide there
[2:19:22] forever.
[2:19:24] Amen. God found him there and he was
[2:19:26] ready to be used. Amen. Amen. And he
[2:19:29] never went back to that old life
[2:19:30] anymore.
[2:19:32] Do you understand?
[2:19:33] And so it's the same thing with
[2:19:35] us. Just look at the victory. I'm in a
[2:19:40] battle. Swing this. I mean, speak it.
[2:19:44] speak the word, but it's not doing
[2:19:46] anything. Are you sure? Yeah, that's
[2:19:48] right. You take you take natural war
[2:19:50] like in the, you know, the Middle East,
[2:19:53] how they fight as they as they gain
[2:19:55] ground, then they gain ground and
[2:19:57] they're slowly encroaching on the enemy
[2:19:59] slowly, slowly, slowly, then they make
[2:20:00] their assault and they take it. That's
[2:20:02] what they do in in in real battle. If
[2:20:04] they're not sure if they have the
[2:20:05] strength just to do an all-out assault
[2:20:07] because you lose men, they they they
[2:20:09] encroach, encroach, and they cut off
[2:20:10] their supplies. They slowly strangle
[2:20:12] them, then they do their assault. That's
[2:20:14] how ISIS wins their battles most of the
[2:20:16] time. Amen. Or or the government taking
[2:20:18] it back. So you say, "Well, I'm in a
[2:20:21] battle." But you're making advances, are
[2:20:24] you not? And the stronger, remember, you
[2:20:26] just got to take this and say, "Boo,
[2:20:27] devil." Amen. Amen. You take this, call
[2:20:30] him a bluff. You get stronger, he gets
[2:20:32] weaker. Amen. That's right. Amen. Amen.
[2:20:37] Hallelujah. We've got the power in the
[2:20:40] name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. Let can we
[2:20:42] sing that song? Who'd you'd like to
[2:20:43] stand with me? Amen.
[2:20:47] Do we have that song?
[2:20:53] I read the end of the book. You know, I
[2:20:55] always used to read books this way. I'd
[2:20:56] read the last chapter. Yeah. And then
[2:20:58] I'd read the rest of the book.
[2:21:01] Once upon a time, I was scared of the
[2:21:02] book of Revelation because I didn't
[2:21:03] understand it. But then I met him. I
[2:21:06] still don't understand it, but I
[2:21:07] recognize there's a new Jerusalem and
[2:21:09] I'm in the new Jerusalem and there's a
[2:21:11] devil and he's in a lake of fire. The
[2:21:13] end. And we lived happily ever after.
[2:21:16] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. That's the end
[2:21:18] of the book.
[2:21:20] You can't change it for the life of you.
[2:21:23] He can't change it for the life of him.
[2:21:25] That's why we're here and we're
[2:21:26] rejoicing.
[2:21:28] In spite of it all. Amen. You may be
[2:21:31] going through a terrible time of life.
[2:21:32] In spite of it all, we can say, "Thank
[2:21:34] you, Lord." Amen. You're in control.
[2:21:36] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Do we have the
[2:21:40] verses? We just got the Okay, it's all
[2:21:41] right. We got the chorus. Amen. Okay.
[2:21:43] So, we're going to sing We've Got the
[2:21:45] Power and then then we'll sing I've got
[2:21:48] the power cuz you got to make it
[2:21:50] personal to you. Amen. Amen. We've got

[2:35:49] amazed that you love me.
[2:35:54] I'm
[2:35:57] amazed how you
[2:36:01] care. Through your
[2:36:04] preious blood, I found
[2:36:09] pardon. And my
[2:36:12] sins are
[2:36:14] washed. They're all washed away.
[2:36:18] All my
[2:36:20] sins are
[2:36:22] washed
[2:36:25] away. No one knew how alone I was
[2:36:33] feeling. And the emptiness I tried so
[2:36:38] hard to hide.
[2:36:42] Oh, I laughed and said my life was fine
[2:36:47] without
[2:36:49] you. I was covering up the secret tears.
[2:36:54] I
[2:36:57] cried. Then one day, someone told me of
[2:37:02] your
[2:37:03] [Music]
[2:37:05] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[2:37:09] called Calvary.
[2:37:14] There
[2:37:16] you purchased my
[2:37:21] redemption. When you broke sin's power
[2:37:24] and set my spirit
[2:37:29] free, I'm
[2:37:32] amazed. Hallelujah. That you love me.
[2:37:38] I'm
[2:37:41] amazed how you
[2:37:45] care. Through your
[2:37:48] preious blood, I found
[2:37:53] pardoned and my
[2:37:56] sins are
[2:37:58] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[2:38:04] sins are
[2:38:06] washed
[2:38:09] away. Yes, it's true. There have been
[2:38:13] days when I failed
[2:38:17] you. Lord, you know the many times I've
[2:38:22] gone astray.
[2:38:26] But I've learned that love's stronger
[2:38:30] than my
[2:38:33] weakness. And your ear is open every
[2:38:38] time I
[2:38:41] pray. No one else has ever cared for me
[2:38:47] like you,
[2:38:49] Lord. Other friends could never be as
[2:38:54] close to me.
[2:38:58] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[2:39:05] tomorrow. Knowing you are everything
[2:39:10] I'll ever
[2:39:11] [Music]
[2:39:13] need. I'm
[2:39:17] amazed that you love me.
[2:39:22] I'm
[2:39:25] amazed how you
[2:39:29] care. Through your
[2:39:32] preious blood I found
[2:39:36] pardon. Oh yes, Lord. And my
[2:39:40] sins are
[2:39:42] washed. They're all washed away.
[2:39:46] All my
[2:39:48] sins are
[2:39:50] washed away. I'm amazed. Oh yes, Lord.
[2:39:54] I'm
[2:39:57] amazed that you love
[2:40:01] me. I'm
[2:40:05] amazed how you
[2:40:09] care. Through your
[2:40:12] preious blood. I found
[2:40:17] pardon and my
[2:40:20] sins are
[2:40:22] washed. They're all washed
[2:40:25] away. All my
[2:40:27] sins are
[2:40:30] washed
[2:40:33] away. I
[2:40:37] believe that you love me.
[2:40:42] I
[2:40:45] believe that you
[2:40:48] care through your
[2:40:51] preious blood I found
[2:40:56] pardoned and my
[2:40:59] sins are
[2:41:01] washed. They're all washed away.
[2:41:05] All my
[2:41:07] sins are
[2:41:09] washed
[2:41:11] away. Hallelujah.
[2:41:15] Glory. Amen. God bless you, friends.
[2:41:17] You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:41:19] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
