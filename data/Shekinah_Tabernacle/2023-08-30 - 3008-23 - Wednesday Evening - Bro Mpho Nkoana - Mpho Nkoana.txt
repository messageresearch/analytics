and that's the whole idea why we have song service amen God bless you so much musicians is to prepare our hearts for the service so um once more I greet you in the honorable and wonderful and Noble name of our Lord Jesus Christ the name above all names amen the name that is not comparable to no other name that's the name I'm greeting you on tonight amen can you say Amen so we we you are stuck with me once again this evening I was supposed to come last week for some reason the odds changed and I asked the pastor to to take my place amen so I'm I'm here again and thank you so much for the privilege and for the opportunity brother Ben we don't impose ourselves to come here brothers and sisters uh for your information and we just get asked to help the pastor and somehow it happens so it's not me that you are here to listen tonight is the Lord Jesus that you are here to listen I'm just but a brother I'm just but an ordinary human being and who can never be able to give you nothing Eternal me myself I need something eternal so God just uses us you know to bless each other amen so let's focus on him tonight and and look at him look come to the feet of Jesus Amen and then he shall be able to answer his prayer meeting tonight so I'll try to be as short as possible and thank you for your prayers and thank you for all the wonderful things that you do for the people of God Amen so we'll be reading the prayer request at the end of the service and then I believe um brother Armand and brother Ed are ready for me at the back and then we can just go straight into the reading of the word in John chapter 11. amen if you don't mind we can stand again Hallelujah praise the Lord who is excited to be in the presence of God I am happy because there's no better place to be this evening and we we we understand that the word of God was spoken from the beginning and when it was spoken it came out of God it was meant to to create everything and it was meant to bring everything that was in the mind of God to to manifestation amen and so I am looking at what was in the mind of God today before the foundation of the world Amen that was what was in the mind of God what I'm what you are looking at tonight amen let's read John chapter 11 then we can sit down verse 21. um sorry let me just um we find the story of of Jesus when he went to raise a Lazarus we know the story right and then we know that he went over there after Lazarus has died but in his map in his view in Jesus Christ's World Lazarus was not dead amen so we're reading the it says from verse 21 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou hasn't been here my brother had not died what Mata is trying to say is that because you were absent because you were not present my brother died but if you were present if you were present my brother wouldn't have died and then let's hear what Jesus says okay mother continues but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee amen right Jesus said unto him thy brother shall rise again I just like that kind of statements where there's no maybe where there's no perhaps it's a clear-cut statement I was going to be shocked if I was I was Mother but it sounds like mother knew told Jesus that but I know that whatever you ask God you'll give you let's hear verse 24. Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day I think Martha here has just missed the point it is not incorrect for what she's saying it is true however it's not the whole truth what Mata is saying there is not what Jesus was talking about Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever okay let's let's go I'll talk about Martha just now Jesus said unto him I am Resurrection I am the resurrection in the life he that believeth in me though he were dead he shall yet he shall he live amen I mustn't pass up to where I'm supposedly and then verse 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us doubt this Believers doubt this mother that's Jesus asking him believe us doubt this what I'm telling you now in other words in Me There Is No Death in me there is no uh oh no yesterday it happened today it can't there's no such a thing um she said unto him yeah Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world would you just join me in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we lift up our hearts and our hands before you we understand Lord as we read the way that father you made it very clear that you are the resurrection you are the life and father tonight we stand in your presence father by the power of that Resurrection Lord God by the power Lord God that Rose you from the dead that ever present power Lord Jesus we stand in your presence Lord and we come with all our hearts Lord we have spent a day father doing our own businesses we have spent a day father maybe contemplating on doing something but father now the even in time of Wednesday has come and now Lord it has chosen and allocated that we come to Worship You Lord and we are happy and excited to be in your presence we pray heavenly father that you forgive us our wrongs Lord that you forgive our weaknesses father we are only but human father born and shaped in sin born in iniquity speaking lies but father your amazing blood that was shared at the cross of Calvary my father my God has father God watched us clean and Lord you have accepted us into your kingdom and father you have taken us out of the Mad peat and brought us father God on the table of the king and that is why tonight Heavenly Father we come with our hearts pouring with Joy saying father Blessed Be Your Holy Name Heavenly Father we thank you for this message we thank you for the preaching and the revelation of this message that Lord you predestinated father that we will receive it in the end time Lord had it not been you sending this message where will we be tonight and I thank you Father that you send a messenger to come for the God and open our hearts and reveal father God the understanding of the word of God I pray heavenly father that you bless your children the very ones Lord that you have appointed at the end time that they should be here at this minute to hear your word when the world's history is about to be closed father bless each one my father bless one is we listen to you speak and father God we commit the service and the rest of the activities in your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen amen Hallelujah please enjoy the Comforts of your seats and I don't know if I can use just my computer I mean phone or I can use this one can I use this one yep I think I can see something there so this evening I would like us to speak about being present in the presence of the Lord who wants to be present in the presence of God Amen you know there are times when you you are you are there but you are not present ah you are physically there I would say your mind is there but you are not there right that's an awful thing isn't it to be there but not there Jesus Christ was not there but he was there because he if he was there physically he would have intervened in Lazarus would have maybe not died he would have just prayed for him but he went and he delayed on purpose when they told him that your friend is sick he knew right because he knows that his presence it changes things he knew that if I can be there ah my presence is a problem to the devil my presence is the problem that is why he never I don't know did you ever hear that Jesus attended the funeral someone said Jesus never attended the funeral but that's not the dog thing I want to preach here I'm just trying to say that his presence his presence is so important to me and to you and that's what we want to talk about this evening for a little bit and then to understand just to realize how crucial and important it is for us to be present and by the way I am happy to see my two daughters home this evening I heard on Sunday the pastor saying Esther Esther oh Esther is here and I was excited who's not happy when his daughter comes home so Esther and Liz we're happy to see you tonight and and each one of you by the way you are very special I'm not you know that talk that says lip service I'm not giving you lip service I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart that you are very very special sometimes maybe you don't realize that you are very special and you are very important that is why you are here tonight this is the chair that was allocated for you to be but let's go back to the story of Jesus Martha and the sister and Lazarus had had he been here even Martha says Lord if you were here my brother wouldn't have died I'm sure Jesus was saying it was good that I was not here but Martha was taken from a different angle to for Lazarus to be healed physically but Jesus was looking Beyond what Martha was trying to ask Jesus was looking at Lazarus whose Resurrection is going to affect the lives of many maybe it wouldn't have been even in the Bible if Jesus went there and he healed because there's other things I believe that were not necessarily written in the Bible that were not necessary for the Holy Spirit to bring to our attention in the form of the Bible what we have is enough maybe during the been here but let's hear that I want to read for you again a scripture look chapter one 19-20 and the angel answering said unto him this is now the angel of the Lord speaking to a man called a Zechariah yeah and the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God Gabrielle stand in the presence of God so that means Zechariah the presence of God is with him at the time Zachariah he's talking to Gabriel and telling him Gabriel that I Gabriel I'm the one and I'm the one who stand in the presence of God now listen and am sent to speak unto thee what a privilege someone sent from the present of presence of God to come and talk to you which means that person is bringing the presence of God to you this and show the these sled tidings verse 20. and behold thou shall be dumped because Zachariah did not believe Zachariah doubted the angel Thou shalt be dumped and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou has Believers not my ways which shall be fulfilled in their season it is very very very very dangerous brothers and sisters to doubt what the angel or the spirit of God is telling you because you are in the presence of God it is it is better to believe everything that has been said when the presence of the Lord is there Hallelujah so we don't want to be damp to our mouth to be close our understanding to be shut because we doubted the presence of the Lord psalm 46. God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble a very present help in trouble meaning okay let me know Jump Ahead let's read verse 2 therefore will not therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the Mist Of The Sea the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Salah be still be still and know that I am God in other words be sober be be present be focused on on me be still don't don't be if don't be haphazard and know that I am God because to know that he is God to know him is life eternal Hallelujah I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth this is God talking to you and to me in the mouth of on the mouth of David now the question that I want to bring to you tonight brothers and sisters is am I present am I present or are you present are you ask yourself that question am I present but not present when the word is being taught you know you know if you hear the pastor saying are you with me yeah everyone is anyone following me tonight or is anyone I had him even on Sunday is somebody with me I asked myself many questions Lord bring me here make me present Lord I don't want the pastor to ask me that question I want to be present when God has descended let me be there because to to ignore and play around with the presence of God is to go down is to be shut be present rather rather not come let us stay home because come to the presence of the Lord you want his presence you want His blessings and he's sure giving them to you for Mahala Mahala means for free he's giving it to me and to you so to come in the presence of the Lord is so important but in the form of preaching when by the way we understand and we know that God is Omni present who knows that word omnipresent you know talking about his his ever present we will see and understand that okay so if God is ever present then then that means it is everywhere right at any time he's omniscient his omnipotent talking about his power he's all power he's all ever present he is now he is omniscient he knows everything he can be everywhere I would like to say he can be everywhere at any time a friend of mine who was not it's not a Believer but he believes in God he trusts God he used to say to me Mr you know we trust in God we trust in God because God can hear the prayers of billions and billions and billions of people at the same time he can listen to each one attempt and I said that's exactly true my brother it's because he is omniscient he knows everything everywhere right now if he is omnipresent right so this means the question is it is for me to get into his presence because I can be out of the presence of God but then because he's present he won't be with me he won't be in me right but the issue is for me because he's to access his presence are we together we need to come to a point in our lives where the presence of the Lord is not leaving us because he promised us there is an enemy whose main job is to drift you away from the presence of God that enemy that we said he's working he's a full-time enemy he's looking for believers and Christians who are part-time Christians he's looking for those ones those ones he's looking for them so that he can manage to take a certain percentage of their lives daily hourly from the presence of God because he knows that if he removes you from the presence of God he's gonna finish up he's got you a lion when it wants to destroy an animal and the animal is in a group of lions it knows that this is a fortress I cannot access these buffaloes even the zebras I cannot access them so it wants to separate you from the presence of the Fortress so that it can catch that's how the devil fights you know the Bible is saying he's going around us like a roaring lion that's exactly how he fights he's looking just to separate you yeah and then you can be there physically but you're not there love your God with all your mind your spirit and your soul 24 7. Hallelujah but now let's let's just understand the way to come in the presence of the king I always give this example about the royal family because you are the royal family I can't help it you are from the royal priesthood you are children of the king so how do we let's think about a worldly royalty because they place it so high so high but it's good for them to do that because it shows us how our royal family came how we should go imagine you know when you go to the presence of the president or the royal family person or whoever there is a process huh there is a process that which you you you go through you know they don't just take you and you go there no even if I'm wearing nice they check me and recheck my credentials everything I can't just go and meet the king there is a process even when I'm there there is a way to greet the queen and the princess I don't know what men do or what what ladies do with their dresses yeah they do that there is a process there is a way when you eat you on the table with the queen and the King you don't just grab your fork and throw the soup there no you there's a way you don't just grab the bowl of salad before leaving the queen candy there is a process there's a way in which you conduct yourself how you chew your food on the table where the queen and the King are you don't just chew anyhow Danny there is no way right so imagine if a wealthy King has got such an order your king eternal life Giver and he's so big he's so big then he realized that you know what the way I'm so big let me make myself simple he said let me simplify myself until he come in Simplicity for us to be able to access his greatness he became simple it's not a human beings are complex but God he's so complex until he's so simple you get it he's so great your mind my mind will never fathom or understand his greatness he then made himself simple simple he became a simple man until they missed him because we are we are too complex as we are complex we are born complex and we don't even understand our complexity ourselves so God became simple so that today we can sit here and talk about how simple he was he was so simple until he didn't have a place of his own if he was in Stokes Valley maybe you'd be sleeping by by the at least Force this weekend next weekend he's sleeping by the moodless the other weekend is by down by the clients or the other month by his friends and then he goes by his sister sister Maggie then the next thing he's going back to her Upper Hutt he goes to then he goes to taita to to Sister Hannah so and then the next thing we hear he's in kapiti he did not have his own place yeah that's how simple he was simple and if you want to be simple these days you are out of fashion you're out of tune you are not moving with the times when I try to be simple my boy says are dead sorry boys so so what I'm trying to say is that there's a process to enter the Royal Family to go to the king that's a process right and as long as you will remain also in the presence of the king and you're going to be in company of the king at all times which means you're going to permanently be that way you are not going to you there's a way we wake up in the morning you there's a protocol even when you stand you say all protocol observed then you can talk huh so there's a way think about those guys who live every day with the king and the Queen they know the process how to greet what the king is what irritates him and everything what he loves and they do what the king loves eventually they behave like they kill themselves they become like the king The King The Queen Is this if the queen says no no blueberries are no good for us for you then then they don't eat blueberries any longer because that's what the queen says so so if you are a king you are in the king's Inner Circle and you are a relative or you are a son or you are a daughter there is a way in which you conduct yourself when you are a member of the Royal Family when you are the son of the king it was only the prodigal son who did what he did being a son of a rich man and he found himself in the picture he forgot he lost his side but one day God restored him so that today you and me can read about it and remember that oh I was like that guy but he has always been a son of the king one day God restored his mind and revealed who he was and he realized that ah let I'll settle for being a servant because even sevens in My Father's House live better than this right so he came back to his senses now talk of General conduct yourself otherwise you bring the king's name into this repute if you don't conduct yourself in a certain way I'm talking about the ethnic King brother Hindi I I'm talking about the Earthly King you can extrapolate it and think about the heavenly father how you need to be engaging talking being in his presence how important how Paramount importance it is to you I'm giving you a perspective of the worldly King imagine how amazing have a specific suit to be to meet the Pope hey a wealthy man who's born like me how much more about the king can you don't you realize that we then which means we are actually we who are called Believers and Christians we are underrating this King every day because now if I can just take you here to Chris's house the Prime Minister I don't know if he lives in apart over but I know it's an Upper Hutt if I can take you to his house now let me go first home and change my my suit if your brother Andy our brother we are just meeting Chris no no is the prime minister say yes I can't go like this because he's a respectable man yeah he's the prime minister of a country you're going to meet him unless if he told you no no Andy let's meet at the gulf then you'll also go buy new golf shoes and a new t-shirt that can meet the prime minister right how much more about the king of kings how do we address him how do we interact with him because that is the thing that determines and explains his presence in your life every day being in the presence of the Lord talk about being in fellowship with him being being in his presence it means that you have to be in full fellowship with him it's a continuous Fellowship that keeps you in the presence of the king all the time when when what your thoughts your ideas your jokes your your seriousness your business your work your everything you everything you want to link it to your spirit to any to a spiritual life you want to think oh I wonder what does my father think about this idea imagine I mean even even on the physical side Emma when you do decisions you think I wonder what Mom will say don't you I wonder what Dad will say even Gaby she thinks oh I don't think my dad will like this hey buddy you consider your your heavenly I mean your elderly father and mother and acquaintances you consider their views right but why is it why is it so easy not to consider the view of our father we only tell him afterwards oh thank you Lord for helping me to get that job but you didn't tell me even before I don't I I just saw you going for an interview I said oh my son one time you realize that I'm right here with him I want to talk to him amen now his absence is what makes us very very bad his absence his absence lead to trouble you can see he was not there then Lazarus died but if he was there Lazarus wouldn't have died didn't you hear Martha Say if if God is not ever present in your life you are heading for trouble here says and and he says where am I um and then his PR his ministry got so popular that he went and he went away and home and then um at any time when he goes away from home then trouble sets in and you just remember these friends these friends you Christians anytime that Jesus leaves your home look out for trouble is on his road to your house he must never leave your house and the only thing that is going to keep him in your house is your fellowship with him it's your talk with is that we let's not complicate our relationship with God God wants you to come to him talk to him someone a friend of mine used to pray and say papa God Papa you know Papa God this this this this Papa you know you're addressing him a person to person level not all heavenly father who who is and synonyms talk to him and say Lord you know me like the way friends talk you know if you listen to maybe uh Esther and Tiana talk as friends you'll hear that these are friends listen to how they talk to each other because when you talk to your friend when you talk to your dad Dad it's your dad you pour your heart you say everything when you talk to your friend what is called your confidante it's called a confident you tell them because you have got trust in them you've got you've got you you respect their opinion you want their view you know you engage sometimes you just tell them your wife your husband sometimes you just tell them just for them to hear so what must I do lovey no I'm just telling you you are just telling me yes because you are my husband I believe for God I'm telling you for the sake of just telling you I'm fellowshipping with you okay then the husband catches it so what I'm trying to say is that he is not to be allowed to leave your house including even this house this house I'm talking about as well this house it must be the ever present dwelling of the Lord halleluia you know in the presence of the Lord things happen yes when when when when when he's present listen uh during the time of brother Branham he used to say I'm I'm waiting for him waiting for the angel of the Lord to come and the angel of the Lord will come from his right hand right and he'll say he is here now if you don't pick up what he's saying there you're going to miss your healing you're going to miss what is trying to say he is here meaning the presence of the Lord is here for me to access now that's why some people got healed sitting there some had to come to the front to be told more for their faith to be uplifted right now we realize that how little we are sorry then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and how close we come or in sorry and how close we come in for coming to his presence somehow or another is always throwed a great effect upon people to come into the presence of God I asked a question one time I said if we are sitting in the service like this and then he just come in his physical body the Lord with his gown and you can see that oh I'm not dreaming and you see all of us and he comes and sits maybe you sit there at the back next or he comes straight to the front and sit next to David because I think the lord loves to sit in the front nothing about sitting at the Backpage so he come and then he sit here right here next door Brother David what what do your first reaction be and you think you are dreaming and he and you check that you are not dreaming what do you think the MC will say Joshua maybe we'll say Lord Jesus is that you and then all of us will what if you look at Joshua anymore everyone will want to come and sit in the front next to him I think I'll want to sit next to you I'll come and sit here yeah yeah right here and just a lot that man can stop with choruses because his presence is so important so important but he said I'm Gonna Be With You I'm gonna be with you even in you until the end of the world but sometimes we find that we lose his presence we we lose his acquaintance because of other things that come to disturb us and we don't flick back flip back you know flip back you know those people who do wrestling they push you down and then you just that one flies back again until we lose his presence we are still his children we are still saved we are still filled with the Holy Spirit but there's an insomnia of some kind there's no contact with the wire you are still a fool full full-blooded son and daughter of God but his presence is oblivious blurry it's blurry we don't want to be like that right because his active presence things happen in his presence let's read here and hear what the prophet says I I've seen time in my Ministry when you would see the presence of God come in into such a place that it will bring a person up and just reveal the life to them and call out their sins of all kinds of immoral acts and bring such a holy hush amongst the people till they drop out of the prayer line before they were before they ever come up to be prayed for and run to the Altar and and get right with God before they come up for his presence see there's something about coming into the presence of God it costs things to happen I've seen people laying in cars and stretches and that changes so that's what the presence of God does the presence of God things things from under the cover and it's so wonderful for the things to come and the Holy Ghost to bring things from under the cover because the devil wants to hide them the devil puts things in a bag you do something he takes and put in the bag he's following you he takes and put in the bag you do another one he takes and put in the bag and works with you one day you get in the presence of the Lord you want to save God and you speak about everything that is here that is here that is maybe here in Your Vision in the Lord welcomes you and forgives you and say my daughter and fill you up with the presence and the devil just just pull up another one from the back and say what about this one that's what he does he keep files for you but the moment you come in the true presence of God no sin can dwell in his presence everything just that the Lord just call at this even grab that back from the Devil and and have you ever emptied their back and everything just evaporate in the presence of the Lord the devil now has now has a bag that he can hold for you and then you live like like you believe up now everything that happens you you've got a sensitivity of the spirit that you you quickly pick up that ah the way I spoke to that sister Maggie I didn't speak to you right the Holy Spirit condemns me I'm sorry my sister she says what I have soy so right you see because now sensitive to the spirit you are now always in the presence of the Lord ah brother Ben forgive me my brother you know I was thinking about this and I didn't think right about you would you forgive me God want us to be like that God wants us to to expose any evil thing that wants to take occupants in our lives he wants us to be so sensitive to the spirit but we can only be like that if we remain ever in his presence are we together I'm I'm closing because today is a prayer meeting um you become humble when you're in the presence of God you become obedient you become a Nila you know people that are called the nilas you kneel too much you kneel until your knees are so you kneel a lot you are in the business of Neurology when you are in the presence of God you pray a lot now I want to read at the bottom of that paragraph there but when God moved in in his presence the patriarch fell on his face because he couldn't stand in the presence of God when you get in the presence of God everything about you your ego your integrity your status in the society falls off that's why you even fall on you the the mighty Prophet fall on his face Daniel on his Facebook because that's that's what must happen when Jesus come I'm fled out is him it's now him in me right that is why these people fell on their face because they couldn't stand Moses the man who was highly educated when he came in the presence of the Lord At The Burning Bush experience I mean you know to be told to take off your shoes is something I only see dear in New Zealand and I hear that it's because it will make the house muddy because maybe it's always raining and it's a culture I understand but to take off the shoes has got a meaning a meaning you know is you take off your shoes and stand here in my presence because the place that you are standing Moses is a Holy Ground well taking off shoes could have many different meanings for different people but what I'm saying is that taking off your shoes Moses because the place an educated man I can imagine that there was some grass some Stony things that you couldn't even you could even walk like this and then and to Bow before God bow even the pope bows he will bow diseases every time will confess brother Brian then South Africa he sings a song he says before him you know Krishna even even Muhammad bows before him even the devil but even covet bows before everything will bow we need everything that can come in the presence of God must bow but you see the devil came in the presence of God and he was he went there as a clown you know a clown he didn't really access the presence of God he was there as an opportunist and God knew so don't come to the presence of God like the devil where he comes to scout you know what is to fish yeah so who are you permitting today and God talked to him and say hey where have you been God know that in this thing's mind is this and this and this so he talks to God Taking Chances and of course okay you know you go do it God and gay that's not coming in the presence of God I'm talking about the way the Devil Comes no he will come the way Daniel and Abraham and Moses come the devil didn't come respectfully but God still tolerated him because he's a tool in the hands of God God wanted to use him he says yes what do you want boy today our job okay why then he because you're shielding him blah blah you know the story okay go get you but don't do one two three but we when we come in the presence armor we come with all understanding that we are coming before God who is so big but so simple to dwell in my little heart in my room me and him shutting inside that room and telling the Lord everything from your heart my girl isn't it I like talking to people when I preach I'm so sorry and here he talks about Moses which I already spoke to you about then I'll jump to this one I mean in the presence of God how you will you eventually come to the full knowledge to know him not just to know that his sister Debbie I know her and then you know when we say you know someone yes you you know you just met them and then you just know them that's not knowing them but when you know someone you can even tell that no I know brother Mario that's not him he cannot do that I know him and I know that suit you're buying him he won't lie this brother just just buy some things I wanna give this to Mario because he knows him that he will like this so that's the knowing I'm talking about to know him right so you've got to be able to be in contact in contact continuous Fellowship in the presence of someone to know them are we together you have because otherwise you are not going to know me you are just going to think that you know me but you don't know brother because you haven't been in full fellowship with me just three months and you say ah I know this South African guy no you don't because you haven't you haven't experienced me enough the Lord wants us to be with him to be in fellowship with him until we know how the Lord operates every day because to know him is life life eternal just to know him in the power of of his resurrection so to know him as your personal savior as the one who has filled you with his presence I saw this quotation on a sister and was it sister Landis status you know these statuses are good I saw it on the sister status I said man I'm gonna put this on my slide I just liked it he says but to know him his life to know him as your personal savior as the one who had filled you with his presence you were there when he it happened there's nobody can take it away from you there's no one can explain it away from you when when when when that experience happens to you you'll know who he is to me he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever until sister Belinda got an inspiration and wrote a song and and she said when when the battle is Raging and the pressure is on when all hell is against us and we fell and we fell we and we fell we are not strong we feel we are not strong sorry I'm not English and we feel we are not strong we need to take time with Jesus we need to worship Him for he won the battle back at Calvary and as she went ahead and says take time therefore take time with Jesus it is the best thing to do to think of his good to think of his goodness yeah the way he sees us through to serve with him at his table to have a sweet Fellowship take time with Jesus it is the best thing to do that's what the inspiration of the sister got is just fell in line with what I wanted to talk about I hope that what I'm trying to convey to you it's not just passing above your heads you're getting the point and the Holy Spirit will continue to go and minister to you the importance of being in the presence of the Lord being present Not absent but present at school they used to call a register when they call your name you say present present present present and they call your name you are there quietness Samson then another friend says present and you see you are present but not present be present actively present in the presence of the Lord amen I'm gonna jump this slide so that we can pray and then we have to recognize the presence of the Lord today so these ones I can share on the brothers group then you can read them yourselves but I'll close with this one I often said the greatest enemy I got is William Brenham he's the one that go that gets in in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do some things about it and when he does that shows shows God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy that guy called pong one when I get to a place that he is out of the way then God come over and do things that William Brenham knows nothing about Hallelujah the last one is this one of being led by the spirit and now one of the most wonderful things of God and the Christian the connection of the fellowship between God and the Christian is that they are I can't see that word there are so soled of God no no I don't know what it is that it's not visible on my side but uh of God are led by the spirit is that they are that they they are the sons of God are led by the spirit yes I think that's what he says there sorry about my bed I should have made smaller to be visible but the greatest thing I found in a Christian Life Christian Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you and his work is marvelous how many is here it's ever been led by the spirit let's see your hands oh my that's wonderful let by the spirit of God to be in his presence to have a sweet fellowship with him that's what I wanted to convey and to speak to you tonight about it might have not come the way that I wanted but it's not up to me is the Lord maybe somebody picked up that ah this presence of God Is So crucial and so important for me I must keep the fire burning all the time when I think when I do things let me be thinking of your presence Lord
