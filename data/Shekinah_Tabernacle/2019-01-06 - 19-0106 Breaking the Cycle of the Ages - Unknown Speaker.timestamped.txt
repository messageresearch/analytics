[48:07] your Bibles handy let's go to the Book
[48:09] of
[48:15] Judges and we're going to go to Judges
[48:21] 13 I'm going to read verses 1 to
[48:24] 5 and then we're going to go to uh 1
[48:28] Corinthians
[48:31] 15 so Joshua Judges
[48:40] Ruth judges 5 and sorry Judges 13 veres
[48:52] 1:5 says here and the children of Israel
[48:54] did Evil again in the sight of the Lord
[48:56] and the Lord delivered them into the
[48:57] hand of the Philistines 40 years and
[49:00] there was a certain man of of zor of the
[49:04] family of the of the danites whose name
[49:07] was manoah and his wife is Baron and be
[49:10] not and the children and the angel of
[49:12] the Lord appeared unto the woman and
[49:14] said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren
[49:17] and bearest not but Thou shalt conceive
[49:19] and bear a son now therefore beware I
[49:22] pray thee and drink not uh wine nor
[49:25] strong drink and eat not any unclean
[49:27] thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and
[49:29] bear a son and no razor shall come upon
[49:32] his head for the child shall be a
[49:35] Nazarite unto God from the womb and he
[49:37] shall begin to deliver Israel out of the
[49:40] hand of the
[49:41] Philistines amen let's go to 1
[49:43] Corinthians chapter
[49:51] 15 and we're going to read from verse 50
[50:05] it says here now I say and this I now
[50:09] sorry forgive me now this I say Brethren
[50:11] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[50:13] kingdom of God neither doth corruption
[50:16] inherit
[50:17] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[50:20] ye shall not all sleep but ye shall all
[50:23] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[50:25] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[50:28] trumpet shall sound and the dead and
[50:30] dead shall be raised Incorruptible and
[50:32] they and we shall be changed for this
[50:35] corruptible must put on in put on
[50:37] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[50:40] immortality so when this corruptible
[50:43] shall have put on incorruption and this
[50:46] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[50:48] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[50:50] that is written death is swallowed up in
[50:52] Victory oh death where is thy sting oh
[50:55] grave where is thy victory
[50:57] The Sting of death is sin and the
[50:59] strength of sin is the law but thanks be
[51:01] to God which has given us the victory
[51:03] through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore
[51:07] my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast
[51:09] unmovable always abounding in the work
[51:12] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[51:15] your labor is not in vain in the Lord am
[51:19] amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[51:21] his word you may have your seats this
[51:23] morning and i' like to I'd like to
[51:25] approach a subject about breaking the
[51:27] cycle of the ages where we're living in
[51:30] a season we know we're you know we're in
[51:33] summer now and and and you know
[51:35] everything in life has a cycle you know
[51:37] if we're here for another year we'll
[51:39] come back to Summer again you know
[51:41] there'll be Autumn then winter then
[51:42] spring then summer then it'll just
[51:44] continue on and and we know that life
[51:46] itself is a cycle where where we're born
[51:49] and then we get you know we're children
[51:50] then we become teenagers adults and
[51:52] eventually we become middleaged and
[51:54] elderly then we die and then you know
[51:56] dur that time you know you have children
[51:58] and they go through the same cycle and
[52:01] you know but we understand that there
[52:03] must come a time where the cycle is
[52:06] broken where where we read about in 1
[52:08] Corinthians 15 that at the last Trump
[52:12] amen where
[52:13] mortality would be swallowed up in
[52:16] Victory death is swallowed up in Victory
[52:18] there has to come a time where the cycle
[52:20] is broken and I believe we are living in
[52:23] that season where we are living in the
[52:25] season where the Apostle Paul would say
[52:28] in the book of Ephesians where God would
[52:30] gather all in Christ in heaven and in
[52:32] Earth in Christ right so there would be
[52:34] the fullness of the dispensation of
[52:36] times he says where there's an end of
[52:38] all things it comes to its fullness it
[52:40] comes to its completion and I believe
[52:42] we're living in that season you know I
[52:44] do not believe that we are you know sure
[52:47] we prepare for the future so that's why
[52:49] I praise God when young people are
[52:50] raising to their position they are the
[52:52] Church of today not tomorrow you've got
[52:54] to realize you're not the Church of
[52:55] tomorrow you're the Church of today
[52:57] right but we understand that should time
[52:59] would T I'll be in the grave you all of
[53:01] us older ones will be in the grave and
[53:03] then you know others will be standing
[53:05] here but I believe that you know though
[53:07] we do prepare for the future I believe
[53:09] that we are now is the season where the
[53:12] cycle of death will be broken right that
[53:14] it won't just be people that are dead in
[53:16] Christ and they go to the grave but
[53:18] there's a people that are alive and
[53:20] remain and they shall be caught up
[53:21] together with the dead in Christ to meet
[53:23] the Lord on the air and I believe this
[53:25] is the promise of the day right so now I
[53:28] want to start there with with with um
[53:31] Samson Samson's parents because when you
[53:34] read the Book of Judges you can see as
[53:37] as and and we know we can preach from
[53:39] the Old Testament because the Apostle
[53:41] Paul would take would take the Journey
[53:43] of Israel from Egypt into the promised
[53:45] land he'd take different stories and use
[53:47] them as allegories or types and shadows
[53:49] and so we can see what happened in the
[53:51] Old Testament repeats in the new that's
[53:53] right right so now so we can look at the
[53:55] Book of Judges and we can see that is a
[53:57] cycle of Revival and death right and I
[54:00] know it you know many times I'm sure
[54:02] you've read the book and you've you know
[54:03] begin to scratch your head and you could
[54:05] say why would Israel go from revival you
[54:08] know they went into land under the
[54:09] ministry of Joshua they took the land
[54:11] they had great Victory you know they
[54:13] didn't even lose a man when they Walking
[54:15] with God and you know incompleteness and
[54:17] God fought their battles but yet then
[54:19] but when that generation that walked
[54:21] with Joshua died then they turned to
[54:22] worship the gods of the heathens around
[54:24] them and then it was just a cycle of
[54:27] Revival and death where God would raise
[54:29] up a deliverer and then they would be
[54:31] delivered but then they would turn and
[54:32] worship the idols of their neighbors
[54:35] again and then the cycle would continue
[54:37] so you know and it shows that God has no
[54:40] grandchildren right God only has
[54:41] firstborn he only has children he is not
[54:44] a grandfather he's a father right so
[54:47] every generation brother Braham says has
[54:49] a chance at the word has a chance at
[54:51] their own Revival right so I believe
[54:54] that we have a you know we do not sit
[54:56] here and look and point to 1965 and God
[54:58] lived back there but we can say in 2019
[55:01] he's alive he's the same God he was back
[55:04] there as he's the present one right so
[55:06] we don't just we're not historians only
[55:09] though that builds our faith but we know
[55:11] he is the same yesterday today and
[55:13] forever right and that was brother Bam's
[55:15] main Battle Cry was Jesus Christ the
[55:17] same Hebrews 138 is the same yester
[55:20] today today and forever so as there is a
[55:23] season of you know there is a cycle in
[55:25] Seasons there's a cycle of life there's
[55:27] a cycle of Revival and death so Israel
[55:29] was in this constant cycle of falling in
[55:32] idolatry which led them to be ruled by
[55:34] another Nation then they cried out to
[55:37] God God raised up someone who delivered
[55:39] them there was Deliverance they had
[55:41] Revival but then after that judge died
[55:43] they fell into idolatry again and the
[55:46] cycle continued and you can take that
[55:48] same cycle and you can look into church
[55:50] history you see Luther came out of the
[55:52] Dark Ages with the just shall live by
[55:54] faith it was Revival the people begin to
[55:56] be free but then that generation
[55:58] cabbaged down on on putting uh you know
[56:00] putting God in a box they wrote up their
[56:02] list of beliefs put a period behind the
[56:04] end of the last one instead of a comma
[56:06] and that was it and they died and then
[56:08] God had to raise up someone else and
[56:09] there was Revival God opened more of his
[56:11] word to the people but then they put a
[56:13] period behind their beliefs again and
[56:15] they cabage down and died and God raised
[56:17] up another right and so that's why you
[56:19] never put a period behind what you
[56:21] believe always put a comma what God can
[56:24] add or take awayz God is always making
[56:27] this more alive I trust he is to you
[56:30] right you didn't just read the Bible
[56:31] once and say I understand the whole
[56:33] thing no you read it again it becomes
[56:35] more alive it becomes more Crystal Clear
[56:38] thank you Lord right so this cycle has
[56:40] continued down all the way down through
[56:42] the church ages as well but there has to
[56:44] come a time when the cycle
[56:46] ends Hallelujah am now we begin to see
[56:50] here that you know the reason that
[56:52] people you know the reason that Israel
[56:54] fell into idolatry is because they
[56:56] forgot who they really were they forgot
[56:59] the true value of being separated unto
[57:01] the Lord you know many times people
[57:04] would look at us and say you're in a
[57:05] prison but this is not a prison this is
[57:09] a strong tower this is a fortress this
[57:12] is a refuge I mean the word of God is
[57:15] not a prison it's a City of Refuge it's
[57:18] a Haven right it's a it's a fortress
[57:20] it's a strong tower hallelujah it's a
[57:22] place of Defense amen so it's not a
[57:25] prison I'm not in a present I've been
[57:27] more free the last 11 years than I was
[57:29] the first however many years before I
[57:31] met the Lord I'm way more free I do what
[57:33] I want amen hallelujah I'm totally free
[57:37] amen hallelujah glory to God I'm not
[57:39] bound by nothing I'm not sucking on the
[57:41] end of a be ble to be happy Hallelujah
[57:44] I'm not listening to a bunch of
[57:46] music to try and be happy bunch of
[57:48] Lights giving me epilepsy to try and be
[57:50] happy in some Club some place I'm free
[57:53] of those things Hallelujah I don't need
[57:56] worry about those things I'm free glory
[57:59] to God thank you Lord amen but the
[58:01] problem is that Israel begin to forget
[58:04] who they were and they lost their Vision
[58:07] instead of looking at the word that God
[58:09] gave Moses they begin to look at their
[58:11] neighbors that's right and then they
[58:13] begin to worship you know it's crazy
[58:14] you'd really think when they really you
[58:16] know they should have sat down someone
[58:18] brings the idol of Baal or whoever it
[58:19] was into the place and they you know you
[58:22] think they' sit down what good has this
[58:24] thing done to our forbears yeah
[58:26] well uh well let's go read the family
[58:29] history yeah great Granddad worshiped
[58:32] this and he became oppressed by the
[58:33] midianites maybe he'll get better the
[58:35] Next Generation no the Philistines what
[58:38] about Uncle Joe the Philistines carried
[58:41] him away yeah that's what about Crazy
[58:44] Aunt Bethy she always said the god of
[58:47] Jehovah is the real God what happened to
[58:48] her she got delivered amen what about
[58:51] Gideon we thought he was a fanatic
[58:52] burning down his father's Idol and
[58:54] things he delivered the people
[58:56] and they should have weighed up okay I
[58:58] think the god of Jehovah I mean the god
[59:00] of Israel the Lord God Jehovah is the
[59:03] one we should worship and they should
[59:04] have crushed that thing right but they
[59:06] begin to look at the wrong thing and
[59:08] that's why you should always look what
[59:09] do the gods of this world do for people
[59:12] what does it do does it give them
[59:13] happiness no it gives them Brokenness it
[59:16] gives them destruction right it gives
[59:18] them sin maybe yeah may be pleasurable
[59:21] for a season when the season comes to an
[59:23] end but with God the season never ends
[59:26] it just gets better he just gets greater
[59:28] he gets more wonderful Hallelujah isn't
[59:30] he good amen so now we you you should
[59:33] really think about that when the devil
[59:34] offers you his best you say his best is
[59:38] better than God's worst and God doesn't
[59:40] have a worst you understand his always
[59:42] good right so you should always wait up
[59:44] say now what will this give me death
[59:46] pain and misery it may feel good while
[59:48] I'm being Sor and half but I'd rather
[59:51] not be S on half you understand what I'm
[59:53] saying you know because all sin does is
[59:56] give you pain that's right right that's
[59:58] what I mean by being sorn in half oh may
[1:00:00] feel good but you just being destroyed
[1:00:03] slowly but God doesn't do
[1:00:05] that amen so now we see that the angel
[1:00:08] came to came to uh Samson's parents and
[1:00:12] they were told she was instructed to
[1:00:15] remain
[1:00:16] separated right that she would bring
[1:00:18] forth a deliverer amen am mean so there
[1:00:20] was a purpose you know God doesn't give
[1:00:22] us word just to uh restrict our
[1:00:25] lifestyle
[1:00:26] but there's spiritual principles behind
[1:00:28] it right there's spiritual principles
[1:00:30] behind it there's there's there's
[1:00:32] there's a protection of angels just like
[1:00:34] it says in 1 Corinthians 11 that the
[1:00:36] glory of the woman amen is her hair
[1:00:38] uncut hair let it grow and for this
[1:00:41] cause you so the angels have give you
[1:00:43] god- given protection right so spiritual
[1:00:46] principles behind it it's not just to
[1:00:48] look you know that's right I believe
[1:00:50] let's just let's just settle this we'll
[1:00:52] always look funny to the world Amen
[1:00:56] always always look funny fashion has
[1:00:59] gone crazy we're here they've gone I
[1:01:01] don't know where they've gone right and
[1:01:04] I think the devil just dresses people up
[1:01:05] to make them look ridiculous but if
[1:01:08] everyone's doing it it's cool cuz
[1:01:10] everyone's doing it right but not but
[1:01:12] that everyone doesn't include me right
[1:01:15] because my father is the Lord Jesus
[1:01:17] Christ I want to live for him right so
[1:01:20] we will always look funny Jesus looked
[1:01:23] funny to the scribes and Pharisees the
[1:01:25] apostles look funny right we'll always
[1:01:29] look
[1:01:30] funny yeah we just need to come to terms
[1:01:32] with this we'll always be funny so we
[1:01:34] might as well be an oddball brother
[1:01:36] preach about oddballs let's be an
[1:01:38] oddball Hallelujah glory to God so now
[1:01:41] he was so she was
[1:01:44] instructed uh that she had to had to not
[1:01:48] drink any wine have strong drink touch
[1:01:52] not an unclean thing that she would
[1:01:55] bring forth a
[1:01:56] deliverer right and this is showing now
[1:01:59] we know in the scripture that a woman in
[1:02:02] the Bible represents the church and so
[1:02:04] the church was now instructed be
[1:02:07] separated from these things do not touch
[1:02:10] the unclean thing and the reason was
[1:02:12] that a deliverer would come forth right
[1:02:15] Hallelujah and so now it is the same
[1:02:18] thing with us we must remain separated
[1:02:21] unto the Lord It's a joy to be
[1:02:24] his right many people take the oh
[1:02:26] separated to God that's a negative thing
[1:02:28] no it's a positive thing that's a
[1:02:30] glorious thing right so
[1:02:33] so she was told to live this way that a
[1:02:38] deliverer would come Hallelujah and is a
[1:02:41] same thing with you and I friends that a
[1:02:44] group of people can be separated to the
[1:02:46] word of the Lord right that the
[1:02:47] deliverer can be birth the deliverer can
[1:02:50] there can be a word can come forth that
[1:02:52] people can be delivered that shackles
[1:02:55] can be broken people can become free
[1:02:58] Hallelujah that instead of being
[1:03:00] oppressed by the enemy the enemy is
[1:03:01] driven out the enemy is cast out
[1:03:04] hallelujah amen as the Apostle Paul
[1:03:06] would say in second 2 Corinthians 6 he
[1:03:10] says and what agreement ha the temple of
[1:03:12] God with Idols for ye are the Temple of
[1:03:15] the Living God as God has said I will
[1:03:16] dwell in them and walk in them and I'll
[1:03:18] be their God and they shall be my people
[1:03:21] wherefore come out come out from among
[1:03:22] them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord
[1:03:24] and touch ye not the unclean thing and I
[1:03:27] will receive you see it's one thing to
[1:03:29] receive God but God's got to receive you
[1:03:32] God's got to receive our faith
[1:03:35] Hallelujah right and will and and will
[1:03:39] be a father unto you and you shall be my
[1:03:40] sons and daughters sayith the Lord
[1:03:43] Almighty he also says in James 4 he says
[1:03:46] submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:03:48] resist the devil and heal flee from you
[1:03:50] draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you
[1:03:53] cleanse ye Hearts ye Sinners and purify
[1:03:55] your hearts ye doubl minded amen so you
[1:03:58] got to take the double mindedness away
[1:04:00] and say God is a rewarder you got to
[1:04:02] believe that he is who believes that he
[1:04:04] is and he's a rewarder of them that
[1:04:06] diligently seek him so don't be doubl
[1:04:08] minded will he answer me will he not no
[1:04:10] he will you got to be determined he will
[1:04:13] answer me if I seek him with all my
[1:04:15] heart he promised if you seek me with
[1:04:18] all your heart ye shall find me not you
[1:04:21] might find me you're going to find me
[1:04:23] but you're got to seek him with all your
[1:04:24] heart Hallelujah you got to cleanse you
[1:04:27] Hearts you double minded do not be
[1:04:28] double minded can he do it can he not do
[1:04:31] it he can do it he's more than able can
[1:04:33] he deliver he delivers can he save the
[1:04:36] most impossible case absolutely he works
[1:04:39] in the impossible I mean that's the
[1:04:41] realm he works in is in the impossible
[1:04:43] case where it seems impossible that's
[1:04:45] where he steps in hallah that's where he
[1:04:48] comes down look at Joshua around Jericho
[1:04:51] it was impossible for them to take
[1:04:52] Jericho they had no battering ram had no
[1:04:56] Siege equipment they had no catapults
[1:04:59] but they're going to take the city hall
[1:05:01] it's impossible they had no boats across
[1:05:04] the
[1:05:05] Jordan they came to the Jordan in
[1:05:07] harvest
[1:05:08] season the rivers flooded I'm slowing
[1:05:11] down a bit here I just want you to you
[1:05:14] know the rivers flooded why didn't God
[1:05:17] bring them when when the river Jordan's
[1:05:19] very
[1:05:20] shallow because God is wanting to show
[1:05:22] them that it's not their ability
[1:05:26] it's his ability hallah that's where we
[1:05:28] should really come to a place where we
[1:05:30] glory in our infirmities right where we
[1:05:33] glory Lord I cannot do it you must do it
[1:05:36] I have no way of doing it you must come
[1:05:38] and do it you must change me you must
[1:05:40] mold me you must help me cuz I cannot
[1:05:42] help myself right Hallelujah so they
[1:05:46] come to the Jordan and they cannot cross
[1:05:48] because it's flooded and God says just
[1:05:50] send the priests in with the ark send
[1:05:52] the word the word will create an opening
[1:05:54] Hallelujah and they walk in became dry
[1:05:56] ground Israel marched over and then
[1:05:58] there's Jericho how are we going to do
[1:06:00] it God says God tells Joshua exactly how
[1:06:03] to do it Hallelujah and the thing is
[1:06:05] they followed the instructions of the
[1:06:07] word and they took
[1:06:09] Jericho amen you follow the word as it's
[1:06:13] written you shall receive what it said
[1:06:15] it will give just like how how the
[1:06:17] Apostle Peter said repent and be
[1:06:20] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:06:22] the remission of soon this is the first
[1:06:24] instruction how to come into the kingdom
[1:06:26] and When God Says something he doesn't
[1:06:28] change it right so repent be baptized
[1:06:31] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:06:32] Christ for the remiss and and you shall
[1:06:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:06:36] it promises unto you to your children
[1:06:39] those are a far off as many as the Lord
[1:06:41] Our God shall call I mean as long as God
[1:06:43] is calling it's promise it doesn't
[1:06:45] change so I think we've got to come to a
[1:06:47] place where we just take God exactly it
[1:06:49] his
[1:06:50] word amen nothing is is anything too
[1:06:53] hard for the Lord and our answer should
[1:06:55] be no nothing is too hard hallelujah
[1:06:58] amen hallelujah why do you think uh God
[1:07:01] sent David to kill Goliath I'm going to
[1:07:04] show you the impossible what man calls
[1:07:06] impossible God says it's more than it's
[1:07:08] easy
[1:07:11] Hallelujah now Hallelujah I wanted so so
[1:07:14] so brother Braham says this in the
[1:07:15] resurrection of Jesus in 1956 he says
[1:07:18] now he says now tomorrow night the Lord
[1:07:20] willing or one night before I leave I'd
[1:07:22] like to speak on the infallibility of
[1:07:24] the word of God
[1:07:26] and if people can ever get their faith
[1:07:29] centered not upon present
[1:07:31] situations but upon what God has said
[1:07:34] about it if you can remember that no
[1:07:36] matter what comes or goes and how
[1:07:38] impossible it it seems to be yet God's
[1:07:41] word will take its place every time see
[1:07:45] in the face of every difficult nothing
[1:07:48] nothing can take its place it has
[1:07:49] preeminence because it's none other than
[1:07:52] God himself in the spoken word and it
[1:07:55] has to come to pass right so our faith
[1:07:58] should not be as he said that if we if
[1:08:00] our faith could be centered not upon
[1:08:02] present situation it's not upon the
[1:08:04] world economics not upon what our
[1:08:06] country is doing or not doing not you
[1:08:09] know not upon what the World Council
[1:08:11] church is doing or the Vatican or
[1:08:12] whatever that's not centered upon those
[1:08:14] things or what's happening in our family
[1:08:16] what our children are doing or our
[1:08:18] parents or whatever or our job situation
[1:08:21] but about or our health right or
[1:08:23] anything if our our faith is not Cent on
[1:08:25] that present situation but our faith is
[1:08:28] solely based upon what God said about it
[1:08:31] right then we can be victorious that's
[1:08:33] why we got to get rid of the
[1:08:35] double-mindedness you say well it's been
[1:08:37] a very long time Abraham waited 25 years
[1:08:39] he got the
[1:08:41] promise right so time is time is really
[1:08:44] nothing to God he's in no
[1:08:46] hurry it's us to get stressed about it
[1:08:50] but if our faith can be based upon what
[1:08:52] God has said in his word then we'll be
[1:08:55] victorious
[1:08:55] in every
[1:08:57] situation
[1:08:58] Hallelujah so now as as Gideon I mean
[1:09:02] sorry as Samson's parents were told to
[1:09:05] be separate that a deliverer would come
[1:09:08] it was because they had to come to a
[1:09:10] realization that the reason they are in
[1:09:12] the land is that they would possess the
[1:09:13] land that every generation would live in
[1:09:16] victory in the land that they would not
[1:09:18] be oppressed by by any foreign Invaders
[1:09:21] and that's why uh God you know the
[1:09:24] Angel's message was sent to them that
[1:09:26] they would that that a deliverer would
[1:09:28] come forth Hallelujah that's why the
[1:09:30] word of the Lord Has Come to Us in this
[1:09:31] generation that Christ himself he's the
[1:09:34] deliverer right no one else is the
[1:09:36] deliverer he's the deliverer that he
[1:09:38] would be birthed amen as as the Apostle
[1:09:42] Paul would say what what do you mean
[1:09:44] about Christ being born he is born in a
[1:09:45] manger but the Apostle Paul says in
[1:09:48] Galatians 4 1819 he said but it is good
[1:09:51] to be zealously affected always in a
[1:09:54] good thing and not only when I am
[1:09:56] present with you my little children of
[1:09:58] whom I travail in birth again until
[1:10:00] Christ be formed in new so he was
[1:10:02] travailing and birth until Christ would
[1:10:04] be formed will be birthed would be
[1:10:06] manifested in them amen hallelujah now
[1:10:11] the as I said we're living in a time
[1:10:13] where the where the cycle of the ages is
[1:10:16] has come to be broken but the but the
[1:10:20] main thing of what God has done in this
[1:10:22] day is that the that the bride of Christ
[1:10:25] would come to a place where she would
[1:10:26] judge him faithful in that which he has
[1:10:29] promised that's because that's the big
[1:10:31] thing God has spoken it right just like
[1:10:34] he said let there be sun moon and stars
[1:10:35] and there's sun moon and stars let there
[1:10:37] be light there's light Let There Be
[1:10:39] mountains there's mountains Let There Be
[1:10:41] oceans and fishes and trees they're here
[1:10:44] right and God doesn't change he doesn't
[1:10:47] speak forth and it happens and he speaks
[1:10:48] forth and it doesn't happen it happens
[1:10:51] right cuz the same one is speaking so if
[1:10:54] we believe that world was made by the
[1:10:56] word of God right then we can believe
[1:10:59] that by Stripes were healed then we can
[1:11:01] believe for the Salvation of our house
[1:11:03] then we can believe in a body change
[1:11:05] then we can believe in a Rapture right
[1:11:06] then we can believe that God will break
[1:11:08] generational Cycles you know we believe
[1:11:10] that God can change us change our
[1:11:12] Spirits change our makeup to match his
[1:11:14] word can we not Hallelujah we can have
[1:11:17] confidence Lord I am your workmanship
[1:11:20] I'm glad I'm on his wheel aren't you
[1:11:22] glad I'm glad I'm glad it's not me
[1:11:24] reforming myself and seven steps to
[1:11:26] become an overcomer he comes and does it
[1:11:29] he's the one who makes us the Overcomer
[1:11:31] you got to judge his word faithful
[1:11:34] Hallelujah I'm glad I'm his workmanship
[1:11:36] work on me oh Lord work on me
[1:11:39] hallelujah amen because at the end of
[1:11:41] the day you'll be able to look back at
[1:11:42] yourself and say in spite of me he
[1:11:44] changed me in spite of me he molded me
[1:11:49] Hallelujah now the church through seven
[1:11:52] Church ages has been waiting for the
[1:11:54] promised son
[1:11:56] as the Apostle Paul would would write to
[1:11:58] the Thessalonians in first Thessalonians
[1:12:00] 4 that we which are alive and remain
[1:12:03] right speaking of the coming of the Lord
[1:12:05] and and I believe when the Thessalonians
[1:12:07] received that letter they when they read
[1:12:09] the wi they would have said that's us
[1:12:11] we're going to be alive and remain and
[1:12:13] then the dead in Christ are going to
[1:12:14] rise we're going to be caught up as the
[1:12:16] living to meet the Lord in the air but
[1:12:19] they did not you know but they did not
[1:12:21] understand or know that would be 2,000
[1:12:22] years it would be seven Church ages amen
[1:12:25] until until the we which are alive and
[1:12:27] remain would actually be here right
[1:12:29] because every generation that die in
[1:12:31] Christ they'll come forth right so we
[1:12:33] don't need to worry about them because
[1:12:34] they'll come forth sure as the bride
[1:12:36] will come forth in this day right so we
[1:12:38] can just rest at what you know whatever
[1:12:40] light they received and they walked in
[1:12:42] amen God will bring them forth
[1:12:45] hallelujah we're living in a harvest
[1:12:47] Sunshine we're not living in the winter
[1:12:49] light we're living in a harvest light
[1:12:51] the fullness of the word has come open
[1:12:52] in this day right so the sun is very
[1:12:54] much shining hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:12:57] now so there's been a so so the church
[1:13:00] has been waiting for the promise son to
[1:13:02] come and it's been like Sarah and
[1:13:05] Abraham where the promises seem to T
[1:13:08] seem to have carried but but God has
[1:13:11] never late amen right God is always on
[1:13:13] time God knows exactly he has his
[1:13:17] schedule and he always keeps it he
[1:13:19] always keeps his appointments he always
[1:13:21] keeps his schedule so though though the
[1:13:23] you say it says I think uh you know one
[1:13:25] of the Minor Prophets say though the
[1:13:27] though the vision May delay may it ter
[1:13:29] yet it will happen right so now they had
[1:13:33] to wait 25 years for the promise and
[1:13:35] it's like the church has been waiting
[1:13:36] 2,000 years for the return of the
[1:13:39] promised son or the coming of the
[1:13:41] promised son and so now but there has to
[1:13:44] come to a place where the church begins
[1:13:46] to not doubt the promise anymore but
[1:13:49] they believe the promise amen that the
[1:13:51] sun will come and it's like you know no
[1:13:54] doubt sah because we know that all of us
[1:13:57] Abraham had his visitation they were in
[1:14:00] the ear you of the chales and God spoke
[1:14:03] to him get out of this country go to
[1:14:05] another country and then God said I'm
[1:14:07] going to give you a ear you're going to
[1:14:08] have a son out of your own flesh you and
[1:14:10] S are going to have the son so he had
[1:14:12] the visitation he believed right and he
[1:14:14] was strong rejoicing knowing that it's
[1:14:16] going to happen right but sah did not
[1:14:19] have that visitation she had to have her
[1:14:21] own visitation that her doubt would turn
[1:14:24] to Faith amen because no doubt you know
[1:14:26] because when the promise isn't real to
[1:14:27] you of the scripture and someone begins
[1:14:29] to rejoice and talk to you about all the
[1:14:31] time you may be caught up in excitement
[1:14:33] initially but eventually it'll get
[1:14:35] annoying why are these people talking
[1:14:37] about a Rapture why are they talking
[1:14:38] about a body change why are they talking
[1:14:40] about Jesus Christ in flesh again you
[1:14:42] know you know and and and it gets a bit
[1:14:44] annoying eventually because like why are
[1:14:46] you so happy about this settle down we
[1:14:49] can't SLE down Abraham couldn't settle
[1:14:52] down he knew every day every day he got
[1:14:54] old the more impossible it seemed in his
[1:14:56] flesh but the more possible it was with
[1:14:58] God right so he be he kept rejoicing and
[1:15:01] every month Sarah how are you
[1:15:03] feeling nothing month number two I'm not
[1:15:07] going to do it to month number I don't
[1:15:08] know how many but you know month two how
[1:15:10] you feeling Sarah the same and
[1:15:13] eventually she get angry I still feel
[1:15:14] the same she get frustrated because
[1:15:16] anyone who tries to bring forth the
[1:15:18] promise of the word and their own
[1:15:19] strength gets frustrated they get
[1:15:22] annoyed they get angry because they know
[1:15:24] it's not man fting and someone's there
[1:15:26] rejoicing and God is changing them it's
[1:15:28] because those who are trying to do in
[1:15:30] their own strength are trying to keep it
[1:15:32] with their will doing it but you've got
[1:15:34] to give your will over and when you give
[1:15:36] your will over then God can work but
[1:15:38] unless you do you if you keep your will
[1:15:41] to yourself God can't work as he should
[1:15:43] oh Lord Jesus Hallelujah that's why you
[1:15:45] say Lord not my will but thy will be
[1:15:49] done hallelujah so she began to get a
[1:15:52] bit
[1:15:53] annoyed and finally there came a season
[1:15:56] where God came down in flesh hallelujah
[1:15:59] hallelujah where where Abraham was he
[1:16:01] was waiting for the coming of the
[1:16:03] promised son and then God came down in
[1:16:06] human flesh in Genesis Chapter 18 it
[1:16:08] says and the Lord appeared unto him in
[1:16:10] the plains of memory and he sat in the
[1:16:12] tent dooring the heat of the day and he
[1:16:14] lifted up his eyes and looked and lo
[1:16:16] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:16:18] them he ran to meet them from the T door
[1:16:20] and bowed himself down toward the ground
[1:16:22] he said my Lord if now I found favor in
[1:16:25] thy sight pass not away I pray thee from
[1:16:27] thy servant and I won't read the whole
[1:16:30] thing but you see the god becomes flesh
[1:16:33] he comes and speaks to Abraham God saw
[1:16:36] God knew one of them was the Lord
[1:16:37] because he'd met him before as MDC right
[1:16:40] so so so he recognized it was God in
[1:16:42] flesh and then now they're sitting there
[1:16:44] they're having a meal Abraham and and
[1:16:47] and um you know he gets Sarah to prepare
[1:16:48] some of the meal and so God is eating
[1:16:50] food talking to Abraham and God says to
[1:16:54] Abra where is Sarah thy wife this is
[1:16:57] Sarah's visitation but Abraham's looking
[1:16:59] for it Hallelujah that's the same thing
[1:17:01] with you and I sometimes our neighbor
[1:17:03] next to us is not looking for the
[1:17:04] visitation but if we keep a spiritual
[1:17:06] atmosphere around us then God will come
[1:17:08] down and meet them right brother Abraham
[1:17:11] said that it was hot on the backside the
[1:17:12] desert The Plains of memory and and
[1:17:14] Sarah was a little bit fussy but Abraham
[1:17:17] kept a spiritual atmosphere around him
[1:17:19] because he was under expectation for God
[1:17:21] to come and meet Sarah that they'd have
[1:17:23] the promised son hallah and and I say
[1:17:26] especially God help us amen that we do
[1:17:29] not you know enter into their fussiness
[1:17:32] or we bring the fussiness right but we
[1:17:34] keep a spiritual atmosphere around us
[1:17:36] that we're not looking at current
[1:17:38] situation but looking at his promised
[1:17:40] word right so now here comes
[1:17:42] Abraham God God speaks to him where is
[1:17:45] Sarah thy wife and Abraham says she's in
[1:17:47] the tent behind you and God says to
[1:17:49] Sarah I mean God says to Abraham
[1:17:51] according to the time of life I will
[1:17:53] visit you now time of life always speaks
[1:17:56] about a woman this is Sarah's visitation
[1:17:59] and you will have the promised son now
[1:18:01] Sarah's in the tent behind behind them
[1:18:03] this is Genesis 18 and she laughs within
[1:18:06] her heart saying how can how can I have
[1:18:09] pleasure with my Lord you know we're old
[1:18:11] and stricken in age you know how can we
[1:18:13] how can we do this Abraham was what 99
[1:18:16] Sarah was not much younger than that and
[1:18:19] so it was physically impossible for them
[1:18:22] to have the promised son
[1:18:24] but then but then God when he's speaking
[1:18:27] to Abraham he says why did Sarah laugh
[1:18:30] because God knows the thoughts of the
[1:18:31] people right and then Sarah comes out
[1:18:33] says no I no I didn't but God says yes
[1:18:36] you did but you're going to have the
[1:18:38] promised son right so this
[1:18:41] visitation caused a um Sarah to go from
[1:18:45] from doubt in the promise to Faith
[1:18:48] Hallelujah and that's why when you come
[1:18:50] down to this age where there's a prophet
[1:18:53] comes upon the Earth and he goes to
[1:18:55] Genesis 18 and he says the world's in a
[1:18:57] Sodom condition again right and people
[1:19:00] like all Roberts and and Billy Graham
[1:19:02] and he and and he actually mentions the
[1:19:04] collects of ministers they've gone down
[1:19:06] into the world to try and call lot out
[1:19:09] right but he says the preaching of the
[1:19:10] Gospel just blinds a lot of people right
[1:19:14] and then so but then he says but there
[1:19:15] was one what about Abraham's visitation
[1:19:18] what about the elect group waiting for
[1:19:20] the promised son what kind of visitation
[1:19:22] did they receive amen and then he said
[1:19:25] and he says now I'll turn my back he
[1:19:27] says now I'm just your brother I'm I'm
[1:19:30] helpless as helpless can be right I'm
[1:19:32] just your brother I'm waiting for him to
[1:19:33] come he says now the angel of Lord is
[1:19:36] here and people knew he didn't need to
[1:19:39] say it people knew the presence of God
[1:19:41] came down there are people even from New
[1:19:43] Zealand that were in those meetings one
[1:19:45] of them started the New Life Church here
[1:19:47] and he and he tried to hide behind his
[1:19:49] Pew when the angel of the Lord came down
[1:19:50] such a holy atmosphere coming to the
[1:19:52] room everyone knew the Lord was
[1:19:55] there and he says now I'll turn my back
[1:19:57] to show you where we are in the
[1:19:59] scripture history repeats itself friends
[1:20:01] history repeats before the burning of
[1:20:03] Sodom this happened before the burning
[1:20:05] of a gentile world this happened right
[1:20:07] so he says now I'll turn my back and
[1:20:09] he's trying to he's not doing he's not
[1:20:10] trying to perform but he's trying to get
[1:20:12] the people to see now this is where we
[1:20:15] are brother bradam wasn't God he's just
[1:20:18] a he's just a man we don't worship him
[1:20:20] we worship Jesus Christ The Living Word
[1:20:23] right he's our God will Bram is not our
[1:20:25] God he's just a prophet do you worship
[1:20:28] Paul no you worship Jesus Christ right
[1:20:30] when you read Paul's writings you don't
[1:20:31] worship Paul is in that wonderful Paul
[1:20:33] wrote that no we worship God but God
[1:20:36] used Paul right just like Moses do you
[1:20:39] worship Moses when you read the first
[1:20:41] five books of the Bible oh Moses how
[1:20:43] wonderful you are telling us about
[1:20:44] creation no you say Thank You Lord you
[1:20:46] you you had this written down to me or
[1:20:49] James or John the Book of Revelation do
[1:20:51] you worship John no you Worship the Lord
[1:20:53] Jesus Christ right so so people come up
[1:20:55] and the prayer line says now I'll turn
[1:20:57] my back and then and he says exactly
[1:20:59] tells exactly what happens this is where
[1:21:02] you know why you're here this is your
[1:21:04] need this is where you're from sometimes
[1:21:07] about nearly you know 15 different
[1:21:10] things about one person and they're all
[1:21:11] always right amen what's he trying to do
[1:21:14] he's trying to get the people to say now
[1:21:16] this we're back in Genesis 18 where the
[1:21:19] church has come and it's been waiting
[1:21:22] for a visitation that they can receive
[1:21:24] the promised son Hallelujah now Sarah
[1:21:28] had to be changed to actually give birth
[1:21:30] to that promised son right to actually
[1:21:33] receive that promised son we're going to
[1:21:34] meet him in the air you're following me
[1:21:37] he physically is not going to touch the
[1:21:38] Earth We're going to meet him in the air
[1:21:40] right at that coming he comes like a
[1:21:42] thief in the night we'll meet him in the
[1:21:44] air that's what first Thessalonians
[1:21:45] tells us when he puts his feet upon this
[1:21:47] Earth that's when he comes for the juice
[1:21:49] but we're in the wedding supper already
[1:21:52] right so now so here he is
[1:21:55] the L you so so we have to be changed to
[1:21:57] receive the promised son in the air
[1:21:59] right so now Sarah was changed she
[1:22:01] became a young woman again and you can
[1:22:03] see this when they go down to Guero or
[1:22:05] or the place of the Philistines and the
[1:22:07] King wanted to marry Sarah and here
[1:22:09] comes old
[1:22:11] grma coming down on her walker or
[1:22:14] whatever that that were I guess a camels
[1:22:15] a Mobility Scooter I guess I don't know
[1:22:17] but you know and yet the king looks at
[1:22:20] her he could have any woman he wants in
[1:22:22] the Kingdom but he wants Sarah and SAR
[1:22:24] is well up in
[1:22:25] age why is that because she had been
[1:22:28] changed young again she received a body
[1:22:31] change right to receive the promised son
[1:22:34] and that's what the visitation of God
[1:22:36] did to her changed her body young again
[1:22:39] that she could have Isaac right and
[1:22:41] that's what this message does now right
[1:22:43] that's why brother said now I'll turn my
[1:22:45] back to show you that that same God that
[1:22:47] changed Sarah's body is here to change
[1:22:49] your body that you receive Jesus Christ
[1:22:51] in the air Hallelujah right that's why
[1:22:54] that's why it's so significant it's not
[1:22:56] just to tickle our you know give us a
[1:22:59] religious itch but we God wants us to
[1:23:01] know where we are in time right this is
[1:23:03] a road map right but unless you know
[1:23:05] where you are you don't know how far
[1:23:07] your destination is right you can look
[1:23:09] at the map just like any place and say
[1:23:11] well I need to get there but if you
[1:23:13] don't know where you are to get there
[1:23:14] how you going to get there right and so
[1:23:17] but it takes the Lord to come and say
[1:23:19] this is where you are in scripture see
[1:23:21] you know how far you need to travel amen
[1:23:24] and that's why I thank God that we have
[1:23:26] he has come down opened his word to us
[1:23:28] that through this message that we know
[1:23:30] exactly where we are and where we're
[1:23:32] going Hallelujah so now Sarah so this
[1:23:36] visitation turned Sarah from doubt to
[1:23:40] Faith right that she came to a position
[1:23:43] as it says in Hebrews 11 And1 says
[1:23:46] through faith also Sarah herself
[1:23:49] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:23:52] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:23:54] part past
[1:23:55] age because she judged him faithful who
[1:23:59] had
[1:24:00] promised hallelujah amen and we have to
[1:24:02] come to that same place that we judge
[1:24:06] him faithful that which is promised and
[1:24:09] now that's not just the body change we
[1:24:12] have to judge him faithful every day
[1:24:15] that his word will keep us his word will
[1:24:17] guide us he will preserve our path right
[1:24:20] that when we don't know which way to go
[1:24:22] we must judge him Faithfully if he's our
[1:24:24] Shepherd he will guide us through right
[1:24:27] he won't just leave us but he will guide
[1:24:29] us through the trial he'll guide us
[1:24:31] through the hardship because he is our
[1:24:34] Shepherd amen I trust that you know him
[1:24:36] personally the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:24:39] shall not want Hallelujah that so you
[1:24:42] must judge him
[1:24:44] faithful Hallelujah hasn't he proved
[1:24:46] himself faithful over and over and over
[1:24:48] and over again why would he stop doing
[1:24:52] that just think about why would he stop
[1:24:54] doing that no he continues CU that's
[1:24:57] just how he works
[1:24:59] now brother Bram says in the rising of
[1:25:02] the sun he says now when you get the
[1:25:04] Dynamics you have been quickened from
[1:25:06] Mortal to immortality sir it makes the
[1:25:10] whole body come subject to the word
[1:25:13] it'll make you act different look
[1:25:15] different live different it just makes
[1:25:16] you different now the Dynamics is the
[1:25:18] Holy Ghost we understand you who were
[1:25:21] once dead in sins and trespasses in
[1:25:23] darkness hath he quii
[1:25:25] what by his spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:25:28] on Easter morning from the dead and if
[1:25:30] it dwells in your mortal bodies now
[1:25:32] watch it also quickens brings to life
[1:25:34] makes it subject to the word now how can
[1:25:36] you claim to have that spirit and throw
[1:25:38] yourself away from the word you'll
[1:25:40] Quicken by something else for if it
[1:25:42] quickened your mortal body to the word
[1:25:44] sure it will so now the holy ghost that
[1:25:47] you know that's why it's so important we
[1:25:50] cannot be Christians in our own mental
[1:25:52] ability you cannot be believer just in
[1:25:55] your own mental ability doesn't matter
[1:25:57] how well you can paint the picture you
[1:25:58] can start from 1947 to 1965 Genesis to
[1:26:02] Revelation have it perfect and man's
[1:26:04] mind can put it together because it's
[1:26:06] made plain in this day but without the
[1:26:08] spirit of the Lord you will not that
[1:26:11] word will never be alive in you right
[1:26:13] though it may sound good though it may
[1:26:15] it look good but without the life of
[1:26:16] Jesus Christ in you it won't live it
[1:26:19] will never actually bring it to full it
[1:26:21] will never bring it to life and we want
[1:26:24] word to live in us now Lord now in order
[1:26:28] to be now to be quick to the word Now
[1:26:31] does not just mean to live right act
[1:26:34] right and speak right right and to dress
[1:26:37] right that's part of it that's been
[1:26:38] Quicken to the word right but then it
[1:26:40] also to be Quicken to the word means to
[1:26:43] be Quicken to the promise of the day
[1:26:45] amen and so the promise of the day we
[1:26:47] know is the body change right that with
[1:26:50] God would become the fullness of God
[1:26:53] that we'd be filled with the fullness of
[1:26:55] God right all Jesus all God was he
[1:26:58] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[1:27:00] is he poured into the church right so
[1:27:03] now the fullness of the word becomes
[1:27:04] manifested in a people amen and after
[1:27:08] that now then there's the change in the
[1:27:10] B says the Rapture but the quickening to
[1:27:13] the word means we're quickened to a body
[1:27:15] change amen you following me that's why
[1:27:17] you know I want to Anchor it into your
[1:27:19] souls if God has transformed your life
[1:27:21] and he lives in you you can look back
[1:27:23] and the person I once was I'm no longer
[1:27:26] that person because he got a hold of my
[1:27:29] life I'm a different person then if God
[1:27:31] has done that for you he doesn't leave
[1:27:33] you there you were quickened by this
[1:27:36] word because you've got a body change
[1:27:38] right you have a Rapture to go in
[1:27:41] Hallelujah that's exactly why you've
[1:27:43] been made alive in this hour is to
[1:27:45] fulfill the promise of the hour amen
[1:27:48] just like Mary Mary was there and the
[1:27:50] promise of her hours Emanuel would be
[1:27:52] born the Messiah would be Bor and she
[1:27:55] was quickened by an angel's message to
[1:27:57] manifest the promise of her day
[1:28:00] hallelujah amen King David it came a
[1:28:03] season where a king would come to the
[1:28:04] throne amen you know you know Moses
[1:28:07] spoke about kings in the book of
[1:28:08] Deuteronomy yeah God knew that they'd
[1:28:10] have Kings right but it came to the time
[1:28:13] where the promise that because even in
[1:28:15] Genesis is a scepter shall not depart
[1:28:17] out of Juda until shoh come so there
[1:28:20] would be a promise of a kingship coming
[1:28:22] through Judah there he was a little
[1:28:24] Shepherd boy anointed by a Vindicated
[1:28:26] prophet Samuel there he was and then he
[1:28:29] became the king because he was quick
[1:28:32] because the promise of that hour was a
[1:28:33] king would come and the fullness of the
[1:28:35] land would be would be possessed so he
[1:28:38] was anointed to manifest the word for
[1:28:40] his
[1:28:41] day Hallelujah that's why it's so
[1:28:44] glorious you say well how can I do that
[1:28:47] if he's in you you will live it right if
[1:28:49] the Lord is in you if his word is in you
[1:28:51] you can't help it but it'll live amen
[1:28:54] amen so now so he's not going to take us
[1:28:56] a little bit just to just to get you
[1:28:59] know just to stay here we haven't been
[1:29:01] we haven't become
[1:29:02] alive just to be just to you know I
[1:29:05] don't believe we're foolish virgin amen
[1:29:08] right I trust you look at yourself said
[1:29:10] no I have oil in my lamp and I'm burning
[1:29:13] I have oil in my lamp thank you Lord H I
[1:29:16] got the holy ghost in my vessel and a
[1:29:19] light is shining
[1:29:21] Hallelujah now I'm going to just going
[1:29:24] to segue a little bit then come back to
[1:29:26] what I just said about manifesting the
[1:29:28] promise of the day now we understand
[1:29:30] that if you know and you know if we are
[1:29:33] here to break the cycle break the cycle
[1:29:36] of the ages then God has to have a God
[1:29:40] has to have Bible families
[1:29:42] again Bible husbands Bible Wives Bible
[1:29:45] children amen that what that the unity
[1:29:48] that Adam and Eve had before the fall
[1:29:50] would be restored even in this evil
[1:29:52] World among husbands and wives amen amen
[1:29:55] I believe it if you the scripture says
[1:29:57] that husband and wives will become one
[1:29:59] flesh I believe we're one flesh amen and
[1:30:02] this is how it should be now in order
[1:30:05] for this to be now I just want to read
[1:30:08] uh let's go
[1:30:09] to um let's go to Ephesians
[1:30:17] 5 and we're going to read a little bit
[1:30:21] here and then we're going to jump around
[1:30:24] a bit but I just so Ephesians 5 and
[1:30:27] we're going to read from verse
[1:30:33] 14 he says so Ephesians 5:14 say Amen
[1:30:37] when say Amen when you are there I go um
[1:30:41] it says wherefore he
[1:30:43] saith awake thou that sleepeth and arise
[1:30:46] from the dead and Christ shall give thee
[1:30:48] light see then that you work uh you walk
[1:30:52] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[1:30:55] Redeeming the time because the days are
[1:30:58] evil wherefore be not unwise but
[1:31:02] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:31:03] is and be not drunk with wine wherein is
[1:31:06] excess but be ye filled with the spirit
[1:31:09] now I just want to just focus on verse
[1:31:11] 17 here be ye not unwise now this speaks
[1:31:14] to everyone here be not unwise now this
[1:31:17] word
[1:31:19] unwise it means to be
[1:31:21] mindless this is just from the strong
[1:31:24] concordance so so it means to be
[1:31:25] mindless I.E in other words stupid by
[1:31:29] implication ignorant especially
[1:31:33] egotistic practically rash or morally
[1:31:36] unbelieving foolish to be unwise now to
[1:31:40] be egotistic I mean ego uh yeah to be
[1:31:44] egotistic or
[1:31:46] egotistical it means excessively
[1:31:48] conceited or absorbed in oneself to be
[1:31:52] self-centered
[1:31:54] he's selfish
[1:31:55] egotistical and arrogant that's a and
[1:31:58] it's it's synonymous with centered
[1:32:00] selfish self-interest self-seeking
[1:32:03] self-regarding self-absorbed
[1:32:05] self-obsessed self-loving vain proud
[1:32:09] self-important that that's part of what
[1:32:11] means to be unwise when you're focused
[1:32:14] on yourself now a Christian cannot be
[1:32:18] this way right God the reason that we're
[1:32:22] a body is not for
[1:32:24] ourselves right we are here the gift
[1:32:27] everyone has a gift in this place even
[1:32:30] faith is itself is a gift right F Faith
[1:32:34] itself is is the most precious gift
[1:32:37] revelation of the word for your day amen
[1:32:40] god-given Faith as the Apostle Paul said
[1:32:42] the life I now live I live by the faith
[1:32:44] of the Son of God so it's not his own
[1:32:46] faith it's Jesus Christ faith in him
[1:32:49] amen so everyone has a gift and that
[1:32:52] gift is not for you that gift is for
[1:32:54] others huj right and so now we are here
[1:32:57] for each other so we cannot be
[1:32:59] egotistical or self-centered and and be
[1:33:02] a Christian you cannot that means you're
[1:33:06] unwise because you do not actually know
[1:33:08] the true value of what you have right
[1:33:10] but if you are wise then you will use
[1:33:13] what you have for
[1:33:14] others and you even as brother Bram said
[1:33:17] living for others is your your eternal
[1:33:19] life is living for others now so if we
[1:33:22] are not unwise as as husbands I mean if
[1:33:27] we are unwise as husbands then we then
[1:33:30] we do not look at our spouses as our
[1:33:34] Glory because it says in 1 Corinthians
[1:33:37] 11 that the woman is the glory of the
[1:33:39] man right so a husband that truly knows
[1:33:43] has a revelation of one who he is in
[1:33:45] Christ and two who is wife is she he
[1:33:49] will not push down his wife amen right
[1:33:52] but he will lift her up amen right and
[1:33:55] so anyone who speaks that you know
[1:33:58] that's why it should be youo this is
[1:34:00] relationship 101 never run down your
[1:34:03] spouse to someone else never ever ever
[1:34:06] run down your spouse husband wife wife
[1:34:09] husband to anyone else never ever do
[1:34:13] that because if you do that you actually
[1:34:15] do not actually know that she is part of
[1:34:18] you as it says in Ephesians 5 no man
[1:34:21] hateth his own flesh right but if you're
[1:34:24] pushing down your wife then you're
[1:34:26] actually actually hating yourself and
[1:34:28] you do not actually have a revelation
[1:34:29] I'm using the word actually a lot
[1:34:31] because I want you think about it for as
[1:34:33] as as Liam would say for real life for
[1:34:36] real life you actually do not know that
[1:34:37] your wife is part of you or you could
[1:34:40] take it the other way around that the
[1:34:42] husband is part of you wife right if you
[1:34:45] uh you know so do not run down do not
[1:34:49] run down your
[1:34:51] spouse and the reason that people run
[1:34:53] down their spouses one they do not know
[1:34:55] who they are in the Lord you know what
[1:34:57] happens you know you see it in the
[1:35:00] playground there's the king of the
[1:35:02] playground he's got it all sorted but
[1:35:05] then a new kid comes in they feel
[1:35:07] challenged they're not comfortable in
[1:35:09] their if they're really comfortable in
[1:35:11] their position in the playground they'll
[1:35:12] just keep playing as they always have
[1:35:14] but if they see this other kid come in
[1:35:16] and maybe Tommy's a bit better with the
[1:35:17] soccer ball or whatever more and they
[1:35:19] feel uncomfortable they they feel
[1:35:21] threaten because they're not com they
[1:35:22] don't know who they are in the play
[1:35:23] ground they'll do two things they'll
[1:35:26] either rally around Tommy or they'll try
[1:35:28] and beat up Tommy cuz he's the new kid
[1:35:31] push him down you understand they'll try
[1:35:34] to push him down so it's the same thing
[1:35:36] you know if our wives are our Glory men
[1:35:40] don't you want to show her off in the
[1:35:41] right way don't you want to be proud of
[1:35:43] her you understand you know this is my
[1:35:46] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah am amen this
[1:35:48] is not something that's hidden in the
[1:35:50] cupboard that you're ashamed of no she's
[1:35:52] glorious look how wonderful she is amen
[1:35:54] hallelujah hallelujah because she's your
[1:35:57] glory right that's right amen and I'll
[1:36:00] just jump to this now you look at the
[1:36:01] Lord Jesus look how he pointed out job
[1:36:05] you know God's not ashamed of us our
[1:36:07] lord Jesus is not ashamed of you he's
[1:36:10] actually proud of you he's very proud
[1:36:13] hallelujah look at look at Job Satan
[1:36:17] comes up before God and and and God
[1:36:20] asked uh Satan where have you been I've
[1:36:22] been walking around upon the earth going
[1:36:24] to and fro and then God says to Satan
[1:36:26] have you considered my servant job
[1:36:29] Hallelujah and obviously Satan didn't
[1:36:31] and God tell you God tells Satan God
[1:36:34] testifies of job there is none like him
[1:36:37] in the earth he's a perfect man
[1:36:40] Hallelujah why because he was God's
[1:36:41] glory upon the Earth at that time
[1:36:44] Hallelujah so God was showing off his
[1:36:45] glory to Satan this man is
[1:36:48] perfect but I just want you to think
[1:36:50] about it job was under the blood of
[1:36:52] bulls and goats yeah so there was still
[1:36:54] a gulf a partition or a Chasm between
[1:36:57] God and job right and God said to Satan
[1:37:01] that job was my servant now friends
[1:37:04] we're not servants amen we're not God's
[1:37:07] servants we're his bride we're his wife
[1:37:10] that's why he died on Calvary to break
[1:37:12] that middle wall of partition Bridge the
[1:37:14] chasm and mean the blood puts us back on
[1:37:16] speaking terms with God again to lift us
[1:37:19] up from servanthood to sunship right
[1:37:21] that we're join Earth with Christ God
[1:37:24] can say that about a servant under the
[1:37:25] blood of bulls and goats how much more
[1:37:27] are people under the blood of his son
[1:37:29] Jesus Christ am mean that are not
[1:37:31] servants but there is bride they've been
[1:37:33] washed they've been cleansed they've
[1:37:34] been Sanctified they've been glorified
[1:37:36] Hallelujah there's no charge laid
[1:37:38] against them how much more those people
[1:37:40] he say hallelujah I trust when I said
[1:37:42] that you say does my Lord really think
[1:37:44] about me that way he does hallelujah
[1:37:48] hallelujah amen God thinks very highly
[1:37:51] of you
[1:37:53] Hallelujah but now we need that same
[1:37:57] understanding when we look at our
[1:38:01] families what's the best you know you
[1:38:04] look you you take children what's the
[1:38:06] best way to motivate them is it is it to
[1:38:10] say you're useless you're nothing you're
[1:38:11] worthless you're pathetic you know you
[1:38:13] can never do anything right is that
[1:38:14] going to bring out the best in them no
[1:38:16] they'll just put up a shield and they'll
[1:38:18] just try and survive through life but if
[1:38:20] you say you're so wonderful you know
[1:38:23] you're the best singer you do that so
[1:38:25] well thank you for helping me you know
[1:38:28] and they're like oh Mommy and Daddy
[1:38:30] think I'm cool mommy and daddy think I
[1:38:32] can do it what does that do then they're
[1:38:33] the first ones there I'll help you I'll
[1:38:35] do this you know because you're bringing
[1:38:37] out the best right and the Lord Jesus he
[1:38:39] never says you're worthless you're
[1:38:41] useless you never amount to nothing
[1:38:43] that's the devil telling you those
[1:38:44] things God says you're more than a
[1:38:46] conqueror through me I mean I've made
[1:38:48] you join ears with me I've washed away
[1:38:50] your past your sins are no longer around
[1:38:52] H they put in the of my forgetfulness
[1:38:54] under my blood and there's no fishing in
[1:38:56] that sea Hallelujah and you are the
[1:38:58] jewel in my
[1:38:59] crown
[1:39:01] Hallelujah I'm glad well that's how the
[1:39:04] Lord you if the Lord can look at us like
[1:39:07] that and we know ourselves who you know
[1:39:11] I'm looking forward to this thing being
[1:39:12] changed I don't know about you but you
[1:39:15] know there um but yet in spite of this
[1:39:19] thing and our Humanity he doesn't look
[1:39:21] at us any less Hallelujah he looked
[1:39:25] beyond my
[1:39:26] fault and saw my
[1:39:28] need amen so
[1:39:31] now so a husband that runs down his
[1:39:35] wife there is actually as I said about
[1:39:38] the analogy of the kids in the
[1:39:40] playground they're not comfortable in
[1:39:41] their position and they do not see a far
[1:39:44] off in terms of what his family needs
[1:39:48] because remember if we have received
[1:39:50] Redemption you know any believer you
[1:39:52] take a husband's especially if you've
[1:39:54] been redeemed you've been brought back
[1:39:56] to the position you should be originally
[1:39:58] right if that is in you then that will
[1:40:00] spread to your family you can't help it
[1:40:03] cuz you've been redeemed you want to see
[1:40:04] others come to be joint ears with Christ
[1:40:07] right but if you're still under the law
[1:40:09] then you'll push your family down right
[1:40:12] to do to you know in order to control it
[1:40:16] that they will do what you want to do
[1:40:19] and essentially that's actually
[1:40:21] egotistical cuz you're controlling your
[1:40:23] family you're actually self-centered you
[1:40:24] actually want to know I want to do it my
[1:40:26] way but it should be know Lord I want to
[1:40:28] do it your way amen that I would embody
[1:40:31] that your Redemption to your bride would
[1:40:33] be manifested in me to my family that
[1:40:35] they would be lifted up Hallelujah to be
[1:40:38] joint ears with Christ as you have done
[1:40:40] that for me amen so
[1:40:44] now amen so that's how we should be we
[1:40:47] should not you know and then also you've
[1:40:50] got to be careful because if you you
[1:40:52] know if we run each other down in front
[1:40:54] of others you actually kill the
[1:40:57] influence that your spouse has upon
[1:40:59] others true amen you actually you
[1:41:02] actually murder their influence that's
[1:41:04] right you know if you are running down
[1:41:06] you your if a if a husband runs down a
[1:41:09] wife in front of others then the person
[1:41:11] he is speaking to about her her
[1:41:13] influence is no longer effective because
[1:41:15] they now look at her through that right
[1:41:19] we can't be like that who wants your
[1:41:22] spouse or your family brothers sisters
[1:41:24] you want them to be effective to others
[1:41:26] right you want their testimony to be an
[1:41:28] influence am that's why you know there's
[1:41:31] the old saying if you can't think of
[1:41:33] anything good to say don't say anything
[1:41:34] at
[1:41:35] all
[1:41:37] amen so
[1:41:39] now our Lord does not run us down he
[1:41:42] testified he testified to the devil
[1:41:44] about job he testifies to the devil
[1:41:46] about you
[1:41:49] hallelujah amen so
[1:41:52] now we have come to a place where but
[1:41:55] you see the thing is now this is part of
[1:41:57] the breaking of the cycle of the ages
[1:41:59] because family has been broken for many
[1:42:01] years this is not a new thing it's been
[1:42:04] a problem you I think Brother Andy
[1:42:06] preached on it ages ago about the effect
[1:42:08] of World War 1 and two in this country
[1:42:10] how how men came back Shell Shocked you
[1:42:13] know holding you know terrifying
[1:42:16] memories in themselves and they just
[1:42:17] became you know like bits of stone
[1:42:20] wouldn't talk about it didn't know how
[1:42:22] to deal with it didn't know how to get
[1:42:24] healed from it and it broke the H uh the
[1:42:27] the father son relationships down
[1:42:29] through the down through the country and
[1:42:32] we're still affected by those
[1:42:34] things that's why we have to parent as
[1:42:37] God wants us to parent amen that's why
[1:42:39] we need relationships as God wants us to
[1:42:41] have relationships not according to
[1:42:43] culture there's always good things in
[1:42:45] culture but there's bad things in
[1:42:46] culture right so we need to take the
[1:42:48] good and then take the good from all of
[1:42:49] it which is Heavenly culture and just
[1:42:51] let that manifest itself right said now
[1:42:53] so you
[1:42:55] know we need to and and so we but we're
[1:42:58] living in a season where God is breaking
[1:43:01] Cycles Hallelujah if he broke the cycle
[1:43:03] of sin off your life he doesn't just
[1:43:05] stop there now I'm going to break the
[1:43:06] cycle of how you saw your parents parent
[1:43:08] I'm going to take all the negative out
[1:43:10] and you'll just do the positive he
[1:43:11] breaks a cycle of that right he breaks a
[1:43:13] cycle of you know father's not speaking
[1:43:15] to sons and Son's not speaking to
[1:43:17] mothers and mothers not speaking to
[1:43:18] husbands and you know he breaks all
[1:43:19] those things he say but you know you
[1:43:23] know I well you know you say well I have
[1:43:25] this kind of lineage of this Heritage my
[1:43:27] father was like this my grandfather was
[1:43:29] like this my great great great
[1:43:30] grandfather was like this it has to stop
[1:43:33] somewhere right just because they were
[1:43:35] like that does that mean you have to be
[1:43:37] like that Hallelujah but you see that's
[1:43:39] the thing if we just say well this is
[1:43:41] just how I'm going to be and that's it
[1:43:43] well no you can't look at it like that
[1:43:45] amen you say Lord I want to
[1:43:48] be I want to be like
[1:43:51] you I want to be like you to be like
[1:43:53] your word that it's not me living but
[1:43:55] it's you living Hallelujah that's why he
[1:43:58] died on Calvary to make himself in
[1:44:00] people am me that God would dwell not
[1:44:02] just in one man but in a people
[1:44:05] hallelujah
[1:44:07] amen hallelujah so
[1:44:09] now we are living at an hour all the
[1:44:13] Cycles are broken I believe we're not an
[1:44:16] unwise
[1:44:18] people I believe that we're a wise
[1:44:20] people because we have the mind of
[1:44:21] Christ amen
[1:44:24] amen now as I said that there's a
[1:44:28] promise the promise of the ages now I'm
[1:44:30] just going to finish with this the
[1:44:32] promise of the ages is the body
[1:44:34] change and the reason just like when
[1:44:37] Jesus came the first
[1:44:39] time the religious World they knew about
[1:44:42] a God that was so you know they had
[1:44:45] Traditions they knew heaven was
[1:44:47] someplace you know they knew God was
[1:44:50] real the devil was real but it was it
[1:44:53] was a mystery to them but then the Lord
[1:44:56] came he and Heaven came down into Earth
[1:44:59] and it became a living reality so it was
[1:45:02] no longer a mysterious thing like when
[1:45:04] they were wondering about you know what
[1:45:06] happens to people when they die Peter
[1:45:08] James and John got Mount Transfiguration
[1:45:10] they see Moses who died and Elijah who
[1:45:13] was raptured and they could recognize
[1:45:15] them and they were in bodies now
[1:45:17] speaking to the Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:45:19] saw that people have a dwelling place
[1:45:20] they go to amen amen and so
[1:45:24] now the reason that and then now through
[1:45:27] the church ages it was uh you know you
[1:45:29] read the book of Acts these visitations
[1:45:31] of angels many times it was not a rare
[1:45:34] thing for an angel to appear to somebody
[1:45:37] right visitations of Angels the angel of
[1:45:39] the Lord was leading his church amen you
[1:45:42] know there was the Apostle Paul and you
[1:45:44] know you know he's on the ship in the
[1:45:45] storm he comes out and he says men be of
[1:45:48] good cheer the angel of the Lord of whom
[1:45:50] I am and whom I am serve told me this
[1:45:53] night that we will not lose any life but
[1:45:55] the ship is going to get wrecked that's
[1:45:57] right so the angel Lord that was Jesus
[1:45:59] Christ in Angelic form came to him and
[1:46:01] spoke so it was nothing strange for
[1:46:03] angels to visit people but then you go
[1:46:06] from there and you go to the dark angel
[1:46:08] your Dark Ages it's a mysterious thing
[1:46:11] right and then you come into the modern
[1:46:12] era and then it's still you know are
[1:46:15] they still angels are they are they are
[1:46:16] they woman with wings or little baby
[1:46:18] cherubs with wings with bows and arrows
[1:46:20] and you know it's a wonder but then
[1:46:22] there comes down down to this age where
[1:46:24] God sends the spirit of Elijah upon the
[1:46:25] Earth and a prophet and there's
[1:46:27] visitations of angels heaven comes open
[1:46:29] again it's not a mystery anymore but it
[1:46:31] becomes a living
[1:46:33] reality amen and then is and then he
[1:46:36] goes down now I trust this should make
[1:46:38] you feel
[1:46:39] Invincible amen the reason and and we'll
[1:46:42] read it in the scripture but the reason
[1:46:44] that the Lord has quickened his word to
[1:46:46] you is because you have an eternal
[1:46:48] Dwelling Place in the heavens right we
[1:46:51] are not Believers because of a haphazard
[1:46:53] thing right to be called what you saved
[1:46:56] one day lost tomorrow or you know maybe
[1:46:58] just survive and how's it going to
[1:46:59] happen no the reason the word has
[1:47:02] anchored in your souls is because you
[1:47:04] have an eternal place in the heavens
[1:47:06] waiting for you right and that's the
[1:47:08] reason now that's the reason why the
[1:47:10] word I mean cuz cuz God sends his word
[1:47:12] to find parts of himself right all that
[1:47:15] the father has given me will come and
[1:47:18] all that come be no wayse cast out so
[1:47:20] God knows the number that's going to be
[1:47:22] there I believe in predestination I mean
[1:47:25] cuz if there's no predestination I'm not
[1:47:27] going to make it right if there's no
[1:47:29] election I'm not going to make it but if
[1:47:31] God has ordained that I will be there
[1:47:33] I've been predestinated to make it amen
[1:47:36] I'm going to make it he's going to get
[1:47:38] me there Hallelujah cuz he doesn't just
[1:47:41] because remember God God has never had a
[1:47:43] new
[1:47:44] thought right hallu he thought of you
[1:47:47] before the foundation of the world you
[1:47:48] the Bible says the lamb was slain before
[1:47:50] the foundation of the world he had a
[1:47:52] thought thoughts he doesn't change his
[1:47:54] mind he has his thoughts and then those
[1:47:57] thoughts becomes words and they're
[1:47:58] expressed upon the Earth they're spoken
[1:48:01] right so now if God thought of you
[1:48:03] that's why he said to Job where were you
[1:48:06] when the sons of God shouted for joy in
[1:48:08] the morning Stars he's trying to get job
[1:48:10] to see you're more than just on an ash
[1:48:12] Heap this is more than you're current
[1:48:14] you got to look Beyond current
[1:48:15] circumstance and look at what the word
[1:48:17] of God says about it am mean he's trying
[1:48:20] to get job to see you are with me before
[1:48:22] the foundation of the world I saw you
[1:48:25] job in my mind shouting rejoicing about
[1:48:28] Redemption Hallelujah and he's trying to
[1:48:31] get job to see it's more than this
[1:48:32] present world but he showed him and then
[1:48:34] job could say now I know my redeemer
[1:48:37] liveth and I will stand with him upon
[1:48:39] the Earth in the last days hallelujah
[1:48:42] though the skin worms destroy my flesh
[1:48:44] yet with my eyes I shall see God it
[1:48:47] became a living
[1:48:49] reality hallelujah hallelujah and and
[1:48:52] why has this why has this message come
[1:48:55] this Bible has become from a story book
[1:48:57] to a living reality that's why we can go
[1:49:00] to Genesis when go to judges go all the
[1:49:02] way down through and God shows you this
[1:49:03] is where you are this is what's going on
[1:49:06] and comes down to detail Hallelujah not
[1:49:09] just a stab in the dark find something
[1:49:11] it's there right cuz this Bible became a
[1:49:13] new book and I and it and it becomes new
[1:49:16] because you enter into a true love
[1:49:18] relationship with the author amen you
[1:49:20] can read someone else's love notes it
[1:49:22] won't mean too much to you Hallelujah
[1:49:24] right but when you fall in love with a
[1:49:26] person writing the notes then you can
[1:49:28] see what they're saying without them
[1:49:29] saying it straight out because you're in
[1:49:33] relationship Hallelujah you with me it's
[1:49:35] the same thing with the Bible you can
[1:49:36] read and say well that's nice but I
[1:49:38] don't know then you fall in love with
[1:49:40] Jesus Christ it means a whole much more
[1:49:42] cuz you see the heart of God come out
[1:49:45] hallelujah it's the same with the
[1:49:46] message when you meet the Lord Jesus
[1:49:48] it's not a Kentucky and screaming I mean
[1:49:50] it's God speaking and it's love mercy
[1:49:52] and Grace coming forth hallelujah
[1:49:55] hallelujah glory to God so now he says
[1:49:59] here the Apostle Paul says for we know
[1:50:03] that if our Earthly House of this
[1:50:05] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:50:07] building of God a house made not made
[1:50:09] with hands Eternal in the heavens for in
[1:50:13] this we Gran I'm I'm just going to read
[1:50:15] that again for we know that if our
[1:50:18] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[1:50:20] dissolved that we have a building of God
[1:50:23] a house not made with hands Eternal in
[1:50:26] the heavens now that goes from just a
[1:50:28] nice idea to a reality when God meets
[1:50:31] you right because his word be you are
[1:50:34] Quicken to his word because he wants you
[1:50:37] to have a revelation you have a house
[1:50:39] Eternal in the heavens I mean you have a
[1:50:42] place if this thing stops living you got
[1:50:44] a place to go into I mean it's not
[1:50:46] trying to get there you have one waiting
[1:50:49] Hallelujah that's why we can actually be
[1:50:51] invincible am doesn't matter what the
[1:50:54] devil does to this thing we've got a
[1:50:56] place that we're going to Hallelujah we
[1:50:58] have an eternal house
[1:51:00] waiting amen
[1:51:03] hallelujah for in this we Gran earnestly
[1:51:06] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:51:08] house which is from Heaven that's why we
[1:51:10] have a yearning I believe we don't have
[1:51:12] a burden for the Rapture because the
[1:51:14] world is getting worse I believe we have
[1:51:16] a burden for the Rapture cuz we want to
[1:51:17] see him don't you want to see him who
[1:51:20] died for you I mean there's more than
[1:51:22] just we feel the sweep of His Holy
[1:51:24] Spirit come down we feel his presence
[1:51:26] Among Us you you can be in the car and
[1:51:27] God comes down into the car amen you got
[1:51:30] to try and stay in the right lane as
[1:51:31] you're shouting and rejoicing or crying
[1:51:33] Hallelujah but that's just a foraste and
[1:51:36] he's and he's wanting you to he's
[1:51:37] wanting you to realize child my bride
[1:51:41] that I love Hallelujah you've got a
[1:51:43] place waiting amen amen you got a place
[1:51:46] waiting that's why we groan who
[1:51:49] groans who says Lord I want to I want to
[1:51:51] take that body change I want to see you
[1:51:54] crowned even if I'm in the back seat in
[1:51:55] the back corner I see that Crown be
[1:51:57] placed on your head I want to worship
[1:51:59] you I want to be part of that redeemed
[1:52:01] song You Hallelujah saying Worthy is the
[1:52:04] Lamb Hallelujah if so be that being
[1:52:07] clothed we shall not be found naked for
[1:52:10] we that in this Tabernacle do groan
[1:52:12] being burdened not for that we would be
[1:52:14] unclosed but clothed upon that mortality
[1:52:18] might be swallowed up of life now he
[1:52:21] that has wrought us for the self same
[1:52:23] thing as God who also hath given unto us
[1:52:26] the earnest of the spirit therefore we
[1:52:28] are always confident knowing that whilst
[1:52:31] we are home in the body we are absent
[1:52:34] from the Lord for we walk by faith not
[1:52:37] by sight amen amen so because we have a
[1:52:42] house waiting we've received the earnest
[1:52:44] is a down payment of the spirit he's giv
[1:52:46] you a deposit of himself telling you
[1:52:49] hallelujah amen that you have a body
[1:52:50] waiting in the heavens amen
[1:52:53] Hallelujah now the reason this is so is
[1:52:56] because you know there's actually Time
[1:52:58] and Eternity of blending together in
[1:53:00] this day right time is actually running
[1:53:03] out amen because soon there's going to
[1:53:06] be a Rapture then there's going to be
[1:53:08] three and a half years of Great
[1:53:10] Tribulation then there's a thousand
[1:53:11] years of Millennium then time is there's
[1:53:14] actually it goes into eternity so we're
[1:53:16] running out of time this is a good thing
[1:53:19] normally we get stressed we're running
[1:53:21] out of time Hallelujah Running Out of
[1:53:23] Time hallelujah amen so now we walk by
[1:53:27] faith and not by sight am now but the
[1:53:29] reason that God is moving and you take
[1:53:31] this around the world we're in a
[1:53:33] different season amen we're in a
[1:53:35] different season and this season is that
[1:53:37] God is wanting us to come to a place
[1:53:40] where we judge him faithful he's going
[1:53:42] to take us amen we're going to go we're
[1:53:46] going to this body is going to be
[1:53:47] changed the dead in Christ are going to
[1:53:49] bump into you one day hallelujah amen
[1:53:52] and you may not recognize them but
[1:53:54] they'll sure make you recognize them
[1:53:56] Hallelujah and you'll come to
[1:53:58] realization the Rapture is on am mean
[1:54:01] this quickening presence we felt among
[1:54:02] us is going to be fully manifested in a
[1:54:05] body change Hallelujah and you've got to
[1:54:08] recognize you say well how do I obtain
[1:54:10] to this if you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:54:11] have what you need to go right this is
[1:54:14] why it's like we're laughing all the way
[1:54:16] to the bank am Hallelujah because we
[1:54:18] have all the money right let's see what
[1:54:21] we can you know you you know what I mean
[1:54:24] amen glory amen you know this is just
[1:54:28] this is just a victory
[1:54:29] LP hallelujah we're just doing a Victory
[1:54:31] lap around the you know the bride is
[1:54:34] just doing a Victory lap around the
[1:54:35] earth Hallelujah you know if we have the
[1:54:39] down payment who has the Holy Ghost who
[1:54:42] believes they have him I would say yes I
[1:54:45] do I believe it amen well then you have
[1:54:48] what you need to get there and it's as
[1:54:50] good as if you're there already right
[1:54:52] because you don't need to get something
[1:54:54] to get there you have what you need
[1:54:56] hallelujah amen so I think we should
[1:54:59] just Rejoice don't you think
[1:55:02] now brother Braham when he speaks of
[1:55:04] this Eternal Body waiting in the heavens
[1:55:06] he uses the the uh the term
[1:55:09] theophany which is uh you know which is
[1:55:12] uh yeah so he uses the term
[1:55:19] theophonic and he begins to speak about
[1:55:22] you you he says she said well jump now
[1:55:24] speaking about the mama Eagle calling
[1:55:26] the baby in the barnyard and so she's
[1:55:28] flying over and she says well jump
[1:55:31] you're an you're an eagle to begin with
[1:55:33] you're not a chicken so he made his
[1:55:35] first jump and flopped his wings didn't
[1:55:38] do too good but he got off the ground
[1:55:40] hall hallelujah am that's the way we do
[1:55:43] we accept God by Faith by the written
[1:55:44] word there is something in there it's
[1:55:47] that eternal life you are predestinated
[1:55:49] to it his Grandpa Grandma were Eagles he
[1:55:52] was an eagle all the way back Eagle
[1:55:54] don't mix with other things he's not a
[1:55:55] hybrid he's an eagle then after you
[1:55:58] recognize the very word of God was Eagle
[1:56:00] food then you left the other thing you
[1:56:03] have you have then been formed into the
[1:56:06] living image of the Living God you heard
[1:56:09] from your theophonic
[1:56:22] so you begin to real and I trust I trust
[1:56:24] it means something to you where you
[1:56:26] actually begin to realize I didn't just
[1:56:27] stumble into this thing for no reason I
[1:56:30] didn't just stumble into this thing
[1:56:31] haphazardly and oh it was just like a
[1:56:33] throw of the dice and I got you know 12
[1:56:36] or you know you know you know I struck
[1:56:37] the big time because of luck like lot no
[1:56:39] you're predestinated to walk into this
[1:56:41] you are predestinated to hear us call in
[1:56:43] this hour you had to hear the call
[1:56:45] you're made for it just like the mother
[1:56:47] Eagle says honey you're you're an eagle
[1:56:49] to begin with just begin to flop your
[1:56:51] wings Hallelujah you're never a chicken
[1:56:54] you're an eagle to begin with amen and
[1:56:56] that begins to tell you now that you've
[1:56:58] heard from your Eternal home hallelujah
[1:57:02] amen you've heard a word from another
[1:57:05] land hallelujah amen he says if this
[1:57:09] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:57:12] one waiting you say is that right
[1:57:14] brother B all right let's take a couple
[1:57:15] of eagles and look at them for a few
[1:57:16] minutes there was a man named Moses
[1:57:18] everyone know that a prophet is called
[1:57:20] you know he's liken to an eagle in the
[1:57:22] Bible there's a prophet named Moses and
[1:57:23] one day God called him and wouldn't let
[1:57:25] him go over the land he died on a rock
[1:57:27] the Angels took him away and buried him
[1:57:29] there was another man an eagle didn't
[1:57:30] have to die he just walked across Jordan
[1:57:33] God sent down a chariot down his robe of
[1:57:35] Flesh he dropped and Rose and caught the
[1:57:36] Everlasting prize 800 years later about
[1:57:39] on Mount Transfiguration there stood the
[1:57:41] two men moses' body had been rotten for
[1:57:44] hundreds of years but here he was in a
[1:57:46] form till even even Peter James and John
[1:57:49] recognized him amen if this Earthly
[1:57:52] Tabernacle be dissolved if you're an
[1:57:54] attribute of God expressed here on the
[1:57:56] earth you've got a body waiting after
[1:57:58] you leave this world there they was
[1:58:01] standing on Mount Transfiguration in
[1:58:03] their theophany for they were prophets
[1:58:05] to whom the word came too and I'll say
[1:58:08] the word has come to you also amen right
[1:58:11] the word has come to you also and the
[1:58:13] reason the word had come to you is
[1:58:15] because you that you would know you have
[1:58:16] a body waiting in the
[1:58:20] heavens amen hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:58:24] and that's the
[1:58:25] reason we have been made alive in this
[1:58:28] day not religious this is not a religion
[1:58:30] this is a a relationship with Jesus
[1:58:32] Christ This Is A Love Affair between him
[1:58:35] and his bride and he wants you to know
[1:58:37] your part of it and that should take
[1:58:39] away all the fear of life and what the
[1:58:43] may
[1:58:44] happen we don't need to worry about the
[1:58:46] what may happen and the ne you know the
[1:58:49] devil loves to just pour on the negative
[1:58:52] look at the negative look at the
[1:58:53] negative look at the negative you say no
[1:58:55] I'm not looking at that I'm going to
[1:58:56] look at the positive I'm look at what
[1:58:58] God's word said about me and about the
[1:59:00] situation well this may happen and this
[1:59:02] may happen brother R says that worry has
[1:59:05] no
[1:59:06] virtue he says well but what about faith
[1:59:09] well Faith May deliver you it may I'd
[1:59:12] rather believe than
[1:59:14] worry as worrying it you as I said about
[1:59:17] people worship you know Israel
[1:59:18] worshiping Idols did the idols do
[1:59:20] anything good thing for their
[1:59:21] grandparents and parents has worry done
[1:59:23] any good good for
[1:59:25] anyone then why do we worry why do we
[1:59:28] sit in that little dark room in our
[1:59:30] minds and you know worry about stuff
[1:59:32] kick it out kick it out replace it with
[1:59:35] what the word says about you oh but this
[1:59:38] may happen this may happen no and it may
[1:59:40] not happen and if it does happen God
[1:59:43] allowed it amen the devil has to get
[1:59:46] God's permission first before he does
[1:59:49] anything to you any anything so we don't
[1:59:52] need to worry we don't need to stress we
[1:59:55] God has it all in control and we can
[1:59:58] just rest in the fact I've heard from
[2:00:00] heaven I'm heard from my eternal home
[2:00:03] Hallelujah and soon and very soon this
[2:00:06] body is going to be changed right and
[2:00:08] we're going to go see the Lord in the
[2:00:11] air Hallelujah can we have the musicians

[2:00:39] well I don't believe it's going to
[2:00:40] happen you know the devil does not
[2:00:42] believe the word of God he doesn't
[2:00:44] believe it can happen and God's just
[2:00:46] proved him wrong over and over again I
[2:00:49] don't you know he said in the days of
[2:00:50] Moses I don't believe that you know
[2:00:52] Israel's going to go into the promised
[2:00:54] land god proved them wrong right you
[2:00:56] know I don't believe Jesus is going to
[2:00:58] come he came I don't believe that God is

[2:01:02] they
[2:01:03] are yeah the devil just gets proven
