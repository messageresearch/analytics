========================================
[Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] amen god bless you saints welcome to the house of the lord seeds filled up quickly i was looking down and it was just a couple and now you're all here welcome to the house of the lord i always get so nervous standing here it's i understand how brother branham always would tell stories to to just get of it relaxed before he he speaks to the people and those stories are pretty cool because um usually it has something to do with his life where the lord has helped him either to overcome or to help someone else overcome so those stories are are actually like little testimonies you throw in there for us to go wow you know he was also he was human yet god could use that vessel so mightily and you can't take that away from him i listened to some testimonies on the internet today and they like little breadcrumbs you open one and you listen to it and then another one opens you listen to it and you just keep going and then at the end of the day you're like i'm supposed to be doing other stuff i'll get back to that now but hey it's things that's eternal it's things that's eternal i think if we're gonna gonna have a great relationship we'll have it here with him so when we're there we're not foreign we're not that one that came through the window hey we're the one that he said welcome into the joys of heaven let us all just stand up and shake off the it's not so cold yet but the rain and uh let's open up in a word of prayer and just welcome him in amen wait for brother phil god bless you brother

want to welcome you in because you are the word lord and we want to say lord come and have preeminence in the service lord come and have your way lord because that's why we come lord if there's anybody that came for a different reason i asked tonight that you'll be gracious lord and be merciful and and lord reach out to them and lord if someone came to draw strength lord would you strengthen the feeble lord if someone wanted to come lord with a prayer request for a loved one lord we know you hear prayers lord jesus and we know that as much as we would like to change things lord you are the divine author you are the the potter lord and we just in your hand lord and we ask that you would just bend us and shape us a little bit more tonight to look more into your image lord because lord you will only take your wife that looks like you that talks like you that prays like you that forgives like you that is just loving like you lord and have all this fruit of the spirit like you lord jesus when you were here on earth and even now lord when you're here with the holy ghost lord just leading us every day that's the one that will go with you lord you will take no other so i ask that

you for it lord and we ask that you'll just keep on leading us in the name of our lord jesus christ and the church says amen amen amen so just before we start got a little thing i just felt late to read i don't really do it this way but it was something that stood out when i read it today and it says it's the resurrection of lazarus in 1951 he says i can see him he wasn't very much to look at the bible said he was no beauty we should desire him he wasn't a great big six footer he was a little frail fellow he straightened his little frame up and stood up his shoulders and he said he was gray in his beard before he even was 30 years old stooped his shoulders up like this and said thy brothers shall rise again he's talking about lazarus he says oh my she said yes lord i know that he will rise again in the last day the jews believed the general resurrection sid i know he will rise again in the last day lazarus was a good boy and good god will raise him up again in the last day he says but i can see jesus say but i am the resurrection and the life i am not i will be not i was but i present things am the resurrection the life he that believeth on me shall never die and then he spoke these words and said and when he thus spoken he cried out with a light voice saying lazarus come forth the same he did with all of us when he called us because we were in a tomb and he said brother come forth brother ben come forth and he and he woke us up out of that sleep which was our first birth amen and this is why easter is such a wonderful occasion because we get to relive it all again amen amen and hopefully it might be the last time we never know hey amen let's begin with um because it started there at the cross who knows the song i love this song oh at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of my heart he rolled away oh it was there by faith i received my sight and now i am happy all day [Music] would he where i first saw the and now i am happy all the days was it for crimes that i have done he grown upon the tree glory amazing where i first and now i am happy all the day glory well my son in darkness and does his glory when sing the mighty maker died for man the creature crushed at the cross at the cross and now i am while calvaries glory be thankful amen and now i am [Applause] is where i first [Applause] let's sing oh it was there but faith i received my sight and now i am happy all the day amen and now you ask me why i'm happy because of that song so let's sing it you ask me why i'm happy and i will tell you why because the cross my sins are gone no way to be found amen who asked me where they are and i say where's your sense oh where is [Music] that's good enough for me praise god my sins are gone all gone and the devil he departs send him amen my sins are gone where are they there underneath the blood of the cross of calvary [Music] forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are gone when satan when satan comes to take what do we do amen i say they're gone in the name of jesus christ amen you got me into trouble but jesus came out oh lord thank you my sins are gone and they're underneath the blood of the cross of calvary it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness it's good enough for me and all my sins now let's look for jesus every day living now for jesus i'm happy night and day because my sins are gone my soul is filled with music with all my heart i say amen i know my sins are gone without the musicians there underneath the block on the cross of calvary as far as moved as darkness is from dawn it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are gone hallelujah amen who listened to the message of this week what did he say he says there's only one person that can forget and that's god because only he has access to that sea of forgetfulness and he can put all your sins there so so when the devil comes to you and he says but wait there's more you go this no more there's no more because though he can accuse and he can remember and he can remind you only god knows where those sins are gone no matter what the devil says to you once you've repented once it's left once you've put it down he has no right to go get it out of the blood that's why we had to go through this time so that we have the blood and can go back to satan and say hey but it's underneath the blood of the king of kings hallelujah amen so let's slow it a bit down because it is a wednesday we're going to worship our lord with everything that we have because he is worthy of all our praise amen i get real happy when i think about him he just makes me happy no though you might be in a trial and situations might be tough you're still happy okay face might not overshow it but the soul says i am happy amen amen so if you want to sing with close your eyes when we worship try to make it so personal between you and god sing this song not for the congregation but hear the words sing the words because that is between you and your savior he did die for all of us but he died for you and if you could accept that and you can make it a part of your life your relationship with him will change so much that every song you sing you can see the words you can feel the words and as you walk you see it live out in front of you that is a personal god that's who he is amen so forget about everyone now let's just see for our lord jesus christ amen [Music] above all powers above all kings [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you were there before it all began above all [Music] this world has ever known [Applause] [Music] there's no way [Music] you [Applause] [Music] [Music] rejected [Music] crucified amen behind us [Applause] [Music] trampled on the ground [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] me lord crucified for me lord for my sin lord jesus you hung up on a cross lord suffered the most horrible death any man could suffer endured every stripe on your back for me lord jesus oh lord so that i can now claim those stripes lord for my healing when you were carrying the cross you thought of me lord when your legs gave in and you fell lord and the pain that you felt was for me lord lord the joy that was set before you was for all of us lord you saw us there lord no matter what this world says no matter how much they want to argue you away lord you were a man that lived upon this earth that was god that was the only way to get back to you lord on speaking terms with god and lord even when you went through all of that you said father forgive them they know not what they do lay it not to their church oh lord because lord now we can accept that and we say thank you lord and lord as we go into this easter time check our hearts lord may we get back to that place lord and think about this event not as in the history lord but it's the same that unfolded when malachi 4 was here again lord that same event happened again lord oh lord may our eyes be open and our hearts be willing to receive in this time in jesus christ's name amen amen let's let's go to the last song old rocket cross hallelujah [Music]

same one for tonight and i was so blessed if it amen the songs that we were singing and i i i realized that we don't have many messages we may have many 1200 booklets or sermons but we've got one message this evening we've got one message if you read the message and you listen to it with a heavenly ear you will hear that this message is one how many agrees with me so this evening sorry excuse my voice i'm running tonight i'm running with two bars you know two bars i need to be recharged that the lord can recharge my voice so that i must not be voiceless but i'm going to take it quite easy so that it must not disappear amen and the lord will take care of the rest amen i would like us to talk about a little topic called the inside fellowship it's actually not even a small topic it is a powerful a big someone that i am not qualified even to to talk about it because it is so deep that it talks about you and god together the two of you did you know that tonight you if you and me can be ready now this evening we can rapture and go home did you know that did you know that you sitting here this evening you can create the heaven and the earth the new ones yes i want to challenge you did you know that that you tonight what's the day today 31st of march right now the time is 8 07 pm on the 31st of march 2021 do you know that you say your name you can create the heaven and the earth and right now if each one of us can come to that realization to that reality we can go home this evening not tomorrow tonight we can leave what are you thinking about you don't worry about what you may leave don't worry about the bengal count don't worry about the house the job don't worry about the problems that you still need to solve the lord has already solved them i'm saying to you tonight we can go home if you so wish and you've got the ability the faith god has given you already we can go home i just thought i must i thought i should just cough that out first before we before tonight we can go home and if you so wish and you are ready and i am ready the prophet said if the bride can realize who they are the rapture will take place and we know that the rapture is already in process amen i don't know what percentage you are you know when you charge a battery and you fill up a gasoline you see that it's going going and you see the rapture is a process and we are in a process of changing we are in a process of going home amen we might not be at the same level but we are getting there to 100 percent where we must go home but we want to talk about the inside fellowship and the scripture where we read the prophets i mean the bible says heaven therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holy years by the blood of jesus amen then let's read another scripture first john chapter one first join chapter one you can all hear me properly it's now two years so you should not have problems with my accent it's over two years now every event you can hear me well hey so everyone can understand me accent when i say robust you understand that i mean robust robust what do you say inquilin sister devi if i want to say robust what do you say here in new zealand robust did you hear that so when i say robust you understand i mean robust first john chapter one first john chapter one verse seven um i i'll write i'll read it here because okay i'm i'm there first john chapter one but if we walk in the light as he is in the light am i there we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin now i would like brother caleb just to display if possible my precious brother that first um slide sorry too yeah but i can do it to you can kelly business you are my friend so how many of us know that that picture over there the children do you understand do you know that picture my little sunday school teachers i mean sunday school uh eagles do you know that picture that picture is the picture of the tabernacle of moses the tabernacle of moses you know we've got shakarna tabernacle and we've got the tabernacle of moses is that one right chicana tavern ago is this one right we've got brother whatever knuckle is this one ah this is my tabernacle brother ben stephen that is his tabernacle sister analyst that's analysis tabernacle and that one is the tabernacle of moses just as much as we have got to have shakina tavern as a bodhi amen shakkaina tribal not this building us as a body so let's let's look at that one not much to talk about it but it's a symbol as a symbol that i want to refer you somewhere let's just look at it we can see that is the outer court right this is the outer court of the tabernacle of moses a lot of things that that are put in place there they go the brazen altar the gate is there on the gate there's a there's a there's a barrier you know a veil sort of and then we've got the the the liver there liver we've got everything then we go into the holy place are we together and you've got the altar of incense there you've got the golden lamp stands there everything is arranged in order and then you've got the holy of holies the inside there and this evening that is what we are going to talk about but we are going to speak about from a different perspective if we may how do i go forward right we are going to talk about you from this perspective because as i told you i am a tabernacle you are a tabernacle are we together and this is the tabernacle remember this tabernacle had three areas one two three right and this tabernacle also have got one sorry have got one two three we all know that are we together i just want to the purpose of the teaching of the preachings every wednesday and every sunday is not to teach you what you don't know is to remind you is to refresh you is to encourage you is to confirm that hey you are a son of god and you are made in the image of god that's the purpose of coming here that is why you need to make sure that when the lord is dishing i've never seen a child who when the mother dishes they say no no no me give me a little i've never seen a child like that every child want to get the maximum production from mama's dish unless mommy does not cook nice but everyone everyone wants to get the best full plate and that's what me and you are supposed to do tonight to to pull from the lord put the minister put the brother aside listen to the word of god pull from the lord let the lord speak things that brother never thought about you can pull where are you going to pull from inside that's where you're going to be pulling from right because jesus christ is the center of this tabernacle he is the one right so that's that's what i want us to look at it from that perspective this inside fellowship because there are many fellowships even the fellowship of the holy spirit can take place here in the in the middle court the holy spirit can anoint you the prophecies in that court there and you do wonderful things you become a wonderful person but that's not what we need what we want tonight is the holy ghost anointing there that's what we want isn't it people can go and do things the holy ghost can anoint them but where is the holy ghost unwinding them i'm running ahead of myself this pastor's computer is again i must put it on sorry i i need to keep on touching it oh there it's coming right so i've just tried to draw it over there again for you to see forgive me amen right so now i've put the same picture again just to to bring this one and this one together right to say that is the holy of holies that's where the altar is that's where moses road was put that's where the mana golden pot of manna was put are we together because and that's where the outer court is and that's the flesh so i want us to go into fellowship inside inside fellowship with that in mind i want us to go with that in mind there's not much presentation that's all the slides i have this evening the rest of it i'll be talking from here and then you pulling me pushing amen [Laughter] now and we need to understand that usually the things that are outside they don't really last the things that happen outside they don't last they can happen they can be successful but they don't really last they don't really get successful the way you want but the things that happen inside they really become good even as a thief for them for a thief to steal properly there must be an inside job you know an inside job we have never been exposed to to thieves brother cuban will tell you and other people who lived in south africa where a big cash processing company will people will come and steal millions with high security security of more than three levels more than even the way we me and you are built ten levels now i've used to a guinea company where sorry wife she used to work in a company where you know there's two buildings one building and another one on top of that one to protect what cash the money right so how come the thieves can steal so much money from such high security because of an inside job things that happen from inside they succeed things that happen from inside they normally succeed better than the things that happen from the outside when you do things from outside you don't know the corners and you get arrested when you do things from outside the holy ghost anoints you you become so anointed speak in tongues and do everything come monday you are flat again you're back to square one why because there's no inside job the inside fellowship is what we need to talk about are we together so the prophet says love produces fellowship you know love produces fellowship who agrees with me and you will because why i'm saying that if god is if god is love and god wanted to have a fellowship with us right his love produces fellowship of adam and eve for him at the garden he wanted to fellowship with them that is why god wanted what god wanted to do and that's what god wants to do today between me and you he does not want the fellowship of the outside he wants the fellowship in because the fellowship inside it lasts it stays permanently and eternally amen so fellowship in jesus christ and the is the only place where the rich and the poor where the young and the older where the middle class and the top and the lower lower class can fellowship they have tried fellowships they have tried them with education they've tried them with money they've tied them with golf they've tied them with sports you can name it but those fellowships don't last why because the only true fellowship is the fellowship with jesus christ and happening not only in jesus christ but inside your heart amen in the in the holy of holies amen that's what happens amen fellowship with god can only happen in his weight now the lord made the heavens and the earth he created it by his weight and he formed adam he did everything and every evening the bible says he was coming in the cool of the evening to talk to them to fellowship with them because they were feeding from his word they were depending on what he said every day that is why the angels this day they worship god they say holy holy the one wait just one word brothers and sisters it's enough for you to live eternally fellowshipping on one word from god every day every night there won't even be day and night because eternally means there's no day and night you are just living eternally one way from god so god wanted that fellowship so now when he came in the evening to fellowship with them and to talk to them and they depend on him there was a problem one day that fellowship was broken it was broken right and after it was broken now god wanted to restore that fellowship are we together he wanted to restore that divine perfect fellowship amen so god introduced the blood arrangement god introduced what the black arrangement immediately god slaughtered a lamb and he put clothes for them there was a lamb that died god introduced blood because there is no any other fellowship in the true word of god without the blood amen so the true fellowship in the word of god must happen through the blood and a god introduced the blood i don't want to go fast i want the little ones to catch me also and to try to be as simple as possible and so that they can understand me in the time of job job and the prophet taught us that job was the first it was the oldest book it was even written before genesis i mean so job was was aware of what can happen and he was praying and sacrificing slaughtering animals there was blood there so that adventure or or or his children have sinned before god blood can be an atonement are we together and the same thing we find that it happened during the time of moses throughout the time of moses blood was introduced that's why even that tabernacle of moses came where everything will be made and there will be the waters of separation amen that will be sprangled amen and then so that when you when a sinner come he can be clean to stand on the blood atonement for him to be clean and washed are we together now when the thing is that with this fellowship is that aaron the high priest when he goes inside there the holy of holies you know you know that they were given manner right the way okay let me not go there i'll come back but i wanted to tell you that blood was the theme around the fellowship there is no salvation without the blood and that blood is of the weight the blood of the word jesus christ amen who was crucified can you see that from the beginning all the way until today blood is features is the main thing even the bible i'll read for you let's read let's read one just to show you let's read uh where did i lose that scripture but i think it's first john also chapter five if i'm not mistaken i just forgot the verse it says there's only three witnesses who knows the scripture who is my bible reader amen john 5 6 amen it says thank you thank you thank you my brother he says this is he that sorry why am i reading first john chapter five this is he that came by water and blood and even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is in the spirit that beareth witnesses because the spirit is true verse seven for there are three that bear record in heaven three father and the word and the holy ghost and these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood so blood is very important towards our tournament and there's no fellowship outside of what is happening what has happened on friday 2000 years ago there was nothing like that there was no way in which we were going to come and be saved heard the lamb of god not died who is excited for easter amen so the prophet says here there's only one place of genuine fellowship and that's under the shed blood of the innocent the innocent jesus christ even that lamb remember that lamb that that was brought a sinner will bring that lamp and the bible says it must be a red heifer sorry not the red heifer the the lamb that was going to be slaughtered or sacrificed on your behalf you are supposed to check it it was supposed to be innocent clean the moment the people who check at the gate find something you must take it back and bring a clean one because it must come sinless and that's how jesus christ came but that sinless lamb come to die for who for me and for you that is what was happening at the beginning so there's no way in which and a lamb that is not innocent will come and die and be sacrificed for me and for you no no otherwise there will be no perfect divine fellowship amen the only place i'm reading now what i've read earlier on about the blood of the innocent was from fellowship 6205.90 the only place the only place common ground that god made with the people was the tabernacle under the shed blood this is now hidden alive with christ 560213 amen let's read let's read let's read romans romans chapter six brother caleb this is the last scripture i believe from there we are just going to be uh romans chapter six we're reading that one once we finish reading this one we are now we'll just be cruising brother kelly see we're just taking off now and now the air has settled we'll just be cruising i don't know at what altitude but we'll be cruising amen what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound that's the question that paul is asking the romans as paul is asking these romans today these christians paul is asking what shall we say because we say we have not come by the law we have come by grace shall now we continue in sin because grace may abound because there is grace and there is mercy from god let me just sin willfully because there's too much grace the lord will forgive me let me sin my parents will forgive me my father is full of mercy my father said i must forgive so many times so i must wrong you brother ben because the bible says you must forgive me that's the wrong attitude that's not the way to do it no no the answer to paul is no we must not sin because grace abound but indeed grace about but we cannot just sin because there is enough grace to forgive us that's the answer to that's how i will answer him today if he was going to ask me brother paul must we just continue to sin because there's enough grace should we just continue to hate your brother and to sin willfully because grace abounds just so that you can come and say i'm sorry no that's the wrong attitude that's the one that the prophet was not referring to when he said the right attitude will bring every promise of god to pass that's not the attitude the right attitude is a no lord i don't want to wrong my brother help me so that i cannot willfully sin against you that's where grace abounds that's where grace abounds amen verse two god forbid i cannot edit in the bible but i think paul they would paul maybe would have wanted to say i'm not editing i'm just saying no god forbid no how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer there in it is because we are not i'm no longer a slave to fear i'm no longer a slave to sin i ca it's not possible for me to sin willfully that's the answer there so god forbid how shall we that are dead in sin live any longer there in that means a believer cannot sin a believer cannot purposefully do something against the word of god that's a believer that's a believer who has found a true divine perfect inside fellowship with the lord amen no he knows that so many of us are so many of us as we are baptized into jesus christ where baptized into his death this is my favorite my one of my favorite chapters i can read it the whole month we were baptized into his death you see when we got baptized children be attentive now this is a sunday school lesson all of you who were baptized you were baptized into the death of jesus christ meaning that when jesus christ died huh and you today you get baptized you are baptized into the death of jesus christ you are like you are dying and when we raise you out of the water you rise being a new man or a new woman not the water is it's not the water that is saving you no it's the action that is happening in them that when you raise them out you rise up a new man because when he raised he raised a new man jesus christ let's read further therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death i like the way he puts the scriptures where paul puts it he says therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that is very clear i mean this does not need a degree in psychology we are buried with him into baptism by into death that's what paul says like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life i am working in the newness of life i'm no longer a slave don't you sing that song so we we we are now coming in the newness of life the things that we used to do we do them no more are we together i want us to read up to verse six there's something that i want to show you knowing that verse six sorry verse five for if we have been planted together in the likeness of death we shall also shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection you see the same way that christ died the same way that christ got buried the same way that christ rose we also come like that same process why why are you coming through that process because you are part of christ in the actual fact when christ died at the cross you were there that is why all you are doing now you are just repeating what has happened on the physical that you were there with him you died with him you were buried with him you rose with him are we together so today you're just confirming you're just in english they say it's just a verification process of what happened 2000 years ago you are just verifying that oh no i was there that is why i can do and and come up with a newness of life because i was there so calvary what is happening on friday what we are celebrating what we are making a lot of noise about is what we went through with him amen now for he that is dead is freed from sin did i jump the verse that's six yes i did knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin clear right for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ if we be dead in christ which we are we believe that we shall also live with him what is this thing of living with christ what is it what is this thing of living with christ we are daily on a daily basis living with christ fellowshipping in him every day the big part of our lives involves talking to him it involves us we associate everything about our life to him because us and him are one we are no more two we are one so everything have you ever seen a woman or who does not think of her husband huh even during the day when the poor man is at work hello i was just checking on you because she is thinking about him everything about her life is about him amen and when he's there he's also thinking about hey that is what i'm talking about that is the fellowship those two are no more two but they are one christ and us are one that is what here the paul is trying to say how if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him we live with him our life our our our doings our everything is with him we act like him we talk like him we we sleep like him you know and to a point where you you you know you know those that are long married they'll tell you that when they look at their wife they even think they look like them their wives [Laughter] hey man brother andy you when you only get your wife you think ah it's like i was with her before before i go it's like there was you were together somewhere me i don't know about you brothers but it happens to me when i look at my wife i think it's like i lived with her sometimes some somewhere before i knew her no it's not it is because he is part of me amen it's because me and her are one there's no more twin there are one and that is what what is happening between you and christ between you and christ that's what the fellowship i'm talking about and that is why uh in this picture that i showed you that in the inner the holy of holies the inner chamber some call it the king's chamber that is inside where things are happening that is where the bride and the bridegroom are isn't it inside because things don't happen outside many of the of the things that we do that we act started inside job an inside job until god said brother branham tell them that their thoughts are louder in heaven than their ways because something that happens inside is more powerful out of the heart the mouth speakers the heart is deceitful the bible says so it is the heart it is what is happening in the heart that matters in actual thing not what happens outside i can smile with you but if i'm not smiling from inside no effect i can say amen from outside i'm not saying don't say amen but it must come from their heart i can jump i can preach i can hear and pray for the people they get healed but if that is not happening from the inner chamber what does it benefit me that's the challenge for me and for you right that is the reality that we are talking about it must happen from the inside the where the fellowship takes place at the headquarters in the that is where the decisions get made amen that is what is happening so we read that romans let me leave it but i'll read i'll leave it with verse 15 and 16. what then shall we sin because we are not under the law no no no we can't do that but under grace god forbid no he not that to whom he yield yourself settles to obey his servants he are to whom he obey did you hear that let me repeat it for you now he note that to whom he yield yourself servants to obey you understand it up to there his servants you are everything that you do and you obey and you you give your everything you are the servant of that thing that's what the bible says in simple terms amen whom you obey whether of sin and unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so in zulu they say musketeer you choose for yourself amen but you have already chosen now the prophet says here in the message the way to have fellowship now this is this will be short we can talk to you just short on this but how that every person desires to fellowship amen every person deserves a fellowship i've never heard about someone that they say ah this one does not want to fellowship even that one who wants to be a loner he will walk there and go in the bush and talk to the insects he's fellowshipping because a human being was made to fellowship a human being there's no way a human being can fellowship if you are alone you're probably fellowshipping with the lord and that's what me and you must do we must find time to fellowship with the lord two of us amen now i have never seen anyone yet who did not desire fellowship no i've never that's what the prophet says here you see in red that's what he says so that he didn't put it there but it's in that same one the way of it oh the way to have fellowship but that is what that is was it's all right mentally balanced now you might you might want to pick your fellowship course that's true for every one of us that's the reason tonight that all these fine people have packed out here in this building you amen to a place where they are standing is because that they like this type of fellowship they like christian fellowship and that's why we come tonight the prophet says to fellowship around the world that's why we are here amen we didn't come here to see bradampo oh he makes me laugh let's go in here no we didn't come for that oh no when he preaches i don't sleep no we didn't come here for that it's not even about him he's not even a point zero zero zero zero nine or the preacher or any minister and the past it is the lord you've come to fellowship with the lord that when you come here you go back home you've got something that the lord has given you something has renewed you something has refreshed you something has given you the new orders when you go to the front line you're going afresh you're going with your ak-47 ready to shoot the devil because the devil must know where he belongs not tomorrow no no no no today the devil needs to know that you are a son of god and he is a devil we need statement here that the prophet said previously we said let's allow god to be god it this on the same note let's allow the data to be the devil let's not make the devil go please the developers may be upset that you can't pray every day no think about you brothers that you can't pray every day you must be upset about that type of an arrangement that you can't read your bible every single day even if the prophet has told you that for you to keep in the fellowship you must read your bible every day and pray every day a believer who finished the whole week brother michael the whole week not you my boy the whole week not all of you we don't do it i'm preaching to the converted we are just refreshing one another reminding one another that hey be careful if that trend starts to emerge the trend of not reading the weight the whole week who's your husband that's it the whole way you never thought about him and send him a text and say lord i'm thinking of you my dear the whole week a week is even long we need to be constantly in the presence of the lord even there at work when someone talks to you wrong you say lord help me look brother armand was saying forgive them they don't know what they are doing and you mean it because if they knew they would do it differently give me patience lord give me the strength to to start one day these people can see that this is a true believer that they can see you in that they can see that i have a special husband then one day they'll come to me and say who is your husband and i'll tell them amen amen amen he says here the prophet uh i'm gonna shock you now can i show you yes are you ready he said the prophet i would rather the heavy church listen just a moment i'll rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just being so in love with each other and with christ i'd rather have that that that sorry i would rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church wow this is powerful eh that means fellowship is powerful more powerful than gifts that the prophet says he rather have a church that so much love each other i'm not talking about faith sorry for that reading i'm talking about true love for one another the love where you forgive your brother before he even ask you the love where you truly love him or your sister that even when you are alone before god you pray and cry for him that's the love i'm talking about not the love that says all together okay i'll pray for brother ben everybody's listening no no no that is good but when you are alone before the lord in your closet praying and crying for me that oh lord help her but i love him so much i want to be with him in in heaven help sister sister davey um i forgot your name sister debbie help sister debbie health analyst i pray for them enter into their needs talk to god about them because we sing a song here that they can talk about me but i'll talk about them on mine that's what we sing isn't it so let's practice what we preach that we we love each other so much that that the devil finds no ground to stand he just found that he's fighting a losing battle that's the kind of fellowship that i'm talking about amen now that might sound hard in a pentecostal group but i'd rather have it that church she's talking about i'd rather have that church where there's his gifts they they fail the kids they fail why are these gifts they'll bring confusion i'm not discouraging the gifts i'm just trying to show you what the prophet is trying to illustrate him that he says he'll rather have the love of god in fellowship around the word of god than to have all the gifts that can turn this building around upside down hey man that can lift up this pulpit on the air those gifts are there and it's the holy spirit using them but what if they happen around in this in the in the middle chamber not in the inner chamber will it help us they shall cease one day they'll stop one day the enemy can fake them we know that but when we have that true genuine love and they happen from that point those things that's the exact thing that we are after are we together amen and he says and if you have perfect love you had you had you will have perfect gifts you see if you have if you have got perfect love gifts will come perfect ones so it only starts with the gifts it only starts with their gifts and other things no they are there but you start with this perfect love of fellowship the perfect one then the perfect gives will they will follow that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts hallelujah amen in the message the way of the fellowship now in the beginning man had fellowship first we realized if we can have fellowship with god then don't worry god will take care of the rest that's what god will do the reason we like fellowship is because i've already mentioned it's because god himself loves fellowship and we god himself loves fellowship and that's the reason we love fellowship who can tell me why because you are his offspring that is why you are like him that is why you love to fellowship with god that is why you love to fellowship with brothers and sisters truly so why because you are a son and a daughter of god and if that is not happening watch out be careful restore your position to have a fellowship with the brothers and sisters of like precious faith amen because that that brings god down and that shows that ah this one is a son of god god being himself he's pleased because that's what he wanted in the first place in the garden of eden somebody must show me the watch quarter tonight i'll finish now it is because god himself loves fellowship and you and me are his offspring isn't it have you never had where a boy does something they say ah he's like his father he's doing that because his father did this it is in his dna we sing a song that we are the children of abraham our blood the royal blood of abraham the royal seat that's what we sing those songs that we think they must come to reality they must come to happen we should not just dream them and seeing them huh they must come from some way hallelujah while we fellowship with one another is grand and the grandest and perfect fellowship is the one man between men and god what i'm saying here is that it also it is very important to make sure that our fellowship all the time must bring god on the scene we mustn't fellowship more about how much money we can make about brother tell where do they make them and we spend hours talking about themselves hey brother come and tell me do you still have those ties yes we must ask our brother to bless us again but that's not to be our center of fellowship the whole three hours talking about suits huh oh money no we should bring christ down because remember he wanted fellowship with us from the beginning that is how it needs to be this is that we should spend more time thinking oh my i wonder i wonder on that morning how it was have you ever said and i thought about how it was not through the video and movie just for you thinking lord i wonder i wonder lord what you went through on that morning he is 10 o'clock now i wonder what was happening in jerusalem on that morning you are thinking about it you are saying lord i really personally i thank you i mean but then think he's closer to you than his door his door is your heart and he's so close tonight he's closer to you than your right arm is he's part of you and if we can only realize that he's here and how he wants to have fellowship with us his heart is greater for fellowship than ours and the reason he makes us that way because we are his offspring we are offspring of his that's what makes us to long for fellowship right i went ahead of myself but that's what the prophet says in this message amen that's that's what makes the mother who will die for her baby why that's what makes the father who give who will give his life for his wife i don't know pastor if there's husbands in this church who can die for their wives that's what the prophet says he says i wonder he is even there's even a question mark here i'm not lying to you that's why that's what makes the mother will die for her baby why that's what makes a father will give his life for his wife [Music] because why there was a husband who died for his wife and his name is jesus christ and the physical types there a man so i wonder a husband a true husband a husband a true husband will give his life for his wife die for him why because christ gave his life for the for the church his wife that's what that's what the men of god taught us i mean the prophet of god the one who of revelation 10 7 who came to reveal everything that's what he said amen how many believe that i believe it amen that's what the prophet says amen now in the message didn't live with christ we are going to read from there but before we read faith cometh by hearing the word who believes that faith comes by here and as we say faith or doubt we found in the soul in the holy of holies that's the place for a believer to fellowship with god faith gets concretized today it gets stabilized it gets solidified but it can't move anymore amen that nothing no demon no chief demon of a country of any spirit of anything will move me and that time you are cruising that time you are cruising my brother i'm not lying to you you are no more worried about little demons you want big ones you say bring them on devil because you know that you have lost even before you start ah that's where we need to get we need to get a point of cruising a point where our attitude is so high we can't even see down there we are cruising and the pilot just put his feet there on there he's just cruising the devil that's not even here he on can only hear our sound we are miles ahead he's only hearing the sound of that he says where are they we are gone ah that's what the devil should the devil should not find us and say i've got him let me let me shoot him no no no no when you get there to school and the spirits are so sick in the school environment and you come there you know do you know a thing called jelly how many knows jelly when when is when you just see much you stick you find scenes like those in schools so think that you can go to you know and but you can't see them with your naked eye so thick are the spirits in their schools and universities and our work environments and this earth so stick but you are here and you are in the spirit how come because you are inside fellowship you are working with a sword you know that sort of the king is so sharp not even jelly can stand when it cuts jelly just go like this it's so sharp that jelly and that thought is the word of god amen and that word of god is christ whom me and you are fellowshipping with in the inner chamber i need to rush and finish tonight i don't want to run you to be in your in your wrong books i'll finish on time now the only place i've already read that one but it's in a different message maybe it would be nice to repeat it because it's in a different message called fellowship 650519 now the only place therefore believing his way the only place therefore believing his way the only place under the shed block is the place for fellowship where everybody can rally around and feel the same product a simple man everybody to feel the same doesn't happen but it happens somewhere some other places it happens i observe it why we don't feel we are not the same you know when brother comes everybody can see that nobody has arrived what is that that's the spirit of christ when bradampur leaves when he goes home or he leaves the fellowship yeah we can hear that he has left now that guy because there's such is bringing his own presence not the presence of the lord when brother phil comes to say i am the man of god yeah you know no no no we want to be all the same amen the brother brandon was simple like that and he was the first wave chief in our age did you hear about the wave shift who made how many had about the way if she on sunday therefore now the only place therefore believing his way the only place under the shed blood is the place for fellowship where everybody can rally around and they feel the same because it's under one place of the shared blood now to pla to place your faith upon anything else besides the word of god is sinking sand that's what the prophet says here amen i'll jump some other things and i can share these notes with you you can enjoy then in there they have seen golden candlesticks remember that's the image that i've shown you of the golden candlesticks in the inner in the inner chamber in the holy place did you see them seven pronged lamp rather but in in the inside behind the veil there was an ark and in the ark there was the tablets the ten commandments as we call them amen and and and that represented human hearts in the holy of holies the ten of commandments they were in there the prophet says they represent a human heart right because they were written those ten commandments were written and they represent your heart that is what the bible says i will write my law upon there upon their hearts that's what the prophet says amen that god how that how god promised in the days gone by that in this day that he will write his yes he will write his laws not upon the tables of stone but upon the hearts he will place the law in the heart also ezekiel's product spoke about it and i feel that the day that we are living that there's a great need among christian people that they seem to be wanting something that they are not able to get because we are made to fellowship so we are always making to strive to strive to start to find something that we can't seem to get no what we need is the fellowship with jesus christ in the inner chamber that's what we need that's what we require tonight it depends on you where your faith is amen i'm just jumping around now sorry if you are not following a certain pattern of thought the thought is the inside fellowship amen you know when mama has this table of food there you you you you you take worse and you and you take that salat huh and you take that one but the whole table is for you ah you just take your time oh you oh he's giving me a snack that i like that brother you take it you fill up in your in your pouch hey you you just take taking from the lord's table eating right amen and the check bones also put wounds aside it depends on where your faith stands brothers and sisters your salvation is good as long as your confession is good the prophet raises something so powerful he says you know our confession is leaking he says it's so disappointing nowadays to find that even people we cannot even confess christ even at our workplace we can't tell the people about christ our husband come on even me every time i preach you hear me say my wife that my wife there it's not like i want to praise her i'm just i just love her that the next example i just use here i also had brother ben says no no i'm christina's fan i like it don't you like that i like to be my wife's friend so i had brother so it's because that resembles christ that's how the lord talks about you about you that hey that wife of mine he's coming soon to be with me here physically we are together but we are just ripping up he's coming let me prepare and finalize this place for her the palace already the seat i can imagine the seats i can imagine your seat how is it going to be if a human being can make such a wedding on earth if sister president can decorate for us so nuts and our seas man you just feel like this city's like heaven man how much more about the one for heaven how is it going to look like mr president huh how is it when you get there and you see no one is going to tell you you're just going to know that one is my chest on the long table of the lord when we get there when we all get there i'm telling you we are not excited enough when we all get there we are going to realize that we have arrived and they will tell you that welcome home my son welcome home my daughter they will tell you that hey your life has just begun brother isaac taught to someone one time he said you know and i was fantastic thinking about that imagining things as is busy preaching that oh man this is so great which means the real real life is not this one the real life we we we just somehow things got mixed up this flesh you know like if the lord can tell things we are going to understand it better by end but if the reality when you get them they tell you that welcome home your life has just started so what are you doing now is this not life no this is not life what we're experiencing now is not life it's just some some negative it's just some negative remember i showed you a negative here the reality is coming the real reality we are living one shadow amen so the real life when they tell you that hey welcome home you said you don't even want to think about what happened all you want to do is to live the life in front of you that time and they tell you that this is the place that the lord prepared for you he said my lord i never thought it would be like this and you say you say no lord i never thought he says yes i told you didn't i tell you that your ears and your heart and your mind has not even thought about it and your your eyes have not seen and the ears have not had we can only imagine with our weak minds and we can't even make a perfect picture of what we are going there to be or to have amen let me let me wrap up here the problem with our churches and people is that we start to copy you see let's watch that out we start to copy copy my friend to copy my another church huh we start to copy and that's what's wrong with our country today is that our churches one trying to copy the other after the other and they said with their head in television and things and they try to impersonate and copy after some filthy thing they seen on television huh let's wash out those spirits because they operate from the fourth dimension not only television nowadays that brother my mother is a friend of mine he was preaching that not the youth don't even want television anymore nowadays no no that's the second hand for them television is nothing there's other catches that are coming from that dimension that are so dangerous huh let's be watchful of those spirits let's check them let's ask the lord to give us a spirit of discernment to say hey this spirit to pick it up on time amen and one is trying to copy the other and they said and then and the churches and head televisions and things and try to impersonate and copy some other filthy things into and bring it into the church that's the problem you see why why doesn't it end up there no because it's a spirit it must end up coming to the church we go and take things from gomorrah and sodom deliberately or not and we bring them no no this is how we need to do it if i can happen to pick up a wrong spirit out there the lord must give me a proper discernment to pick it up and destroy it i mustn't bring it here no we must be watchful we must be wise that because listen to it we are not immune from being attacked by the devil no but what we are what the devil must know is that we will pick him up first time and the lord will give us that discernment the spirit of picking up something that's not right we will be attacked but the counter attack with the devil will be like a bazooka in a bazooka who knows the bazooka amen may the lord help us in closing there was mana in that inner holy of holies you know there was a scepter there was a scepter of moses the stick maybe the prophet says maybe it was an almond stick he says maybe it was an almond stick that was dry that old moses was using it you know going to pharaoh there and telling pharaoh he says it was in there also yeah and and there was a port of mana mana was flowing falling every morning and they were picking up and eating it huh but if they leave it for how many hours for 24 hours 48 it goes off you can't eat it anymore there's worms on it but the one that was in the inner holy of holies it was not getting off huh it was fresh all the time it was better than your your your samsung free sorry samsung you know you know there's something pretty that you just said click pretty it tells you that one can't keep your mana fresh the holy of holies will keep your mana as fresh now that one the manna was not getting off in the golden part and the scepter for moses the prophet said hell that stepped up overnight started to germinate overnight there were some almonds fruits there was some elmo's fruit that that were already on there why because when things happen from inside when things happen from the inside when there is an inside job there is a success where there is an inside job you can take anything that is dead huh tell me about the master seat how can a master sit and bring such a massive tree hey why why can you put a small little seed there and it comes and grows something is happening inside the seed there is a life there inside job is it must be an inside job there is a fellowship in there that is happening that the light of the sun and the environment strike the seat and it was in the good grounds and started to bring things not from outside from inside you can have the wonderful grounds you can have the sunlight you can have all those things but if there's nothing happening in there what will come out that manner was not getting off the holy ghost can occupy an outside position that's what i was warning you before that let's just be careful that our holy spirit that we operate from inside that we are sealed and we ask the lord we become desperate before the lord that our spirit our point of operation our our camp you know our base is in the soul where the opera the holy spirit operates because he can also operate from the outside not outside then a scene like he can operate from outside but that's not what we ideally need that's not what will take us home what will take us home is when you went inside and the kitchen behind us drops and we are in the ass and the lord amen in closing let me jump here so the the most important thing is that when the when the word of the lord come it finds you in the position you know that you can't wait for a train here in silver stream station or or here at the water station here behind us here in taita or in the other station you can't wait for for it saying somewhere when the chain passes there you must wait at the station ready with your ticket to get on board amen that's where our position should be it is the place you are abiding at is where you are at amen you remember that many times on the campground these blessings run out you are eating manna correct manna but you haven't you have not concentrated your your life yet that's what we need to watch out to make sure that we concentrate our life you know when they give you a drink that is concentrated man is strong it means you must dilute it when they give you a drink that is concentrated so that's how our life should be our life should be concentrated in the lord in the inner chamber in the holy of holies amen right and went into the place like around behind the holy of holies when he was in there nothing did he didn't hear nothing the world no more so i'm reading from what the prophet he says if you just hear some chop with him and it's because the prophet will jump to another thought and say something amen and when men and women need today what men and women need today after you have been brought into the kingdom of god is a hidden life men and women who will get with christ and the curtains dropped behind them you are you don't care what the world says you don't care what the people say you are living in with christ where the manner you are eating from the golden pot of manna every day day and night all the time amen living on the mountain underneath the cloudless sky that's what the prophet says he was becoming poetic amen so may the lord help us may the lord bless each and every one of you that that that that we can be those christians that are concentrated that are pursuing if there's anything that you can do for yourself tonight is to cry to god to pull you inside the inner chamber this flesh one day is gonna thank you brother ben says it will say thank you man because because you would have saved it it would have changed huh it would have changed it wouldn't have taken you to hell it would have changed and you get a new body and you get into heaven this flesh would thank you one day let me read justice one last thing what the prophet says most of the things that i've already went ahead of myself i've spoken about the road of moses that it blossomed and yielded the fruits amen overnight that's what i like so much that that road when it's in the presence of god it brought the fruits overnight what made the road so too bad go be in the presence of the lord and you get refreshed that's what made the road to bat overnight naturally what makes the trees to get refreshed is the cool of the night and the morning comes when all the nature gets quiet and the jew comes and refreshes the tree then it gets buddy when the presence of the lord comes when all the world shuts off in other words when you switch off from everything of the world when you are so attentive to the spirit amen and the presence of the world come and you start to bite who wants to bat and have the almonds or the fruits in the morning already ripe ready to be saved may the lord help us do you ever did you ever go out of the morning after the night and pass early of the morning also it blossoms it gives fragrance and did you ever go early of the morning to the define of the fragrance you find out that early of the morning when you get out the jew is hanging low the trees are burning the blossoms are coming up and the perfume is go along the road and smell the honey circles into the rose garden early of the morning that's why it's been quiet nature nature has through the night it's got quiet and god bathed it with refreshing amen we are so amen we are also nature ourselves we are nature we are living in this nature here called flesh when we get quiet before the lord before the presence of the lord his freshness will come when we get quiet in the presence of the lord and we take time and get quiet in the lord and listen to the lord quietly his presence come and then he will brood over us that's when the biting comes that's why the manna would not go off that when the manna will never get finished amen christians not wanting to testify i spoke about that amen we are going to testify are we going to testify we are going to testify and tell people that's that little word that you can mention to someone i was talking to someone arguing he was telling me he's busy driving with me taking me home he says to me oh no no no the problem with you christians you want to impose to us i say no we don't want to impose god has given you a free moral agency for you to choose but he wants you and he's a wonderful man he says i can only come if you preach you met him from dear friend of mine simon so he pray for him when you pray that god because i like him and he loves me and he just wants to be around me so i pray that the lord can help him that the lord can touch him because his wife is a christian but him no so i must not even give him this sleep because you'll hear that i was talking about him amen may god help us and may god bless us lastly i just want to emphasize you see i'm closing my bible i just want to emphasize the blood atonement that so and so when let me read for you and so when when sin comes in it separate men from fellowship sin notice what god did to bring men back to fellowship i just want to emphasize it he introduced the world a blood redemption god killed animals he pulled for this for their skill and put for their skin showing a blood redemption god laid out the welcome met back home by the shading of the blood and that was then and he be has been and will always be god provided preparation for fellowship with him is through the shed blood of the lord jesus christ and that was that is what we are going into this easter and i pray that the lord will take these words and just bless them in your hearts and just encourage you as we go back home that we can go and say lord you know we have been given everything if you find that you cannot have something ask god and if you find that you cannot have something and you are unable to ask god for that something what should you do you should ask god to give you the ability to ask because he said we must ask anything i'm sitting here i'm struggling to pray but i've got a god who said i must ask anything i must ask god and say lord help me to be able to pray because when i pray i want to talk up to you about this and this anything the devil likes to hide the magnitude of what we can ask there is everything we can ask including the things that we think we can't and the devil don't want us to think that we are not able to ask for that he said he's a mental guy so let's approach him by the spirit that lord open everything remind me the things i must ask you then the lord will remind you then you can ask him then he can give you that's how god operates you ask he gives you from the heart may god bless you tonight let's step hands for the lord 30
