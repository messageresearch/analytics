[31:23] and well
[31:24] um
[31:25] amen so we're just going to listen to a
[31:27] portion if you we'll just read the
[31:29] scripture then um
[31:31] we're going to um so we're going to go
[31:32] to revelation 6 and we're going to read
[31:36] from verse 12 down to verse 17 so we're
[31:39] just going through the seven seals and
[31:41] um i actually found it quite difficult
[31:43] to find a portion
[31:45] of this message to
[31:48] you know
[31:49] say this is this is the whole
[31:50] message within the message because it's
[31:52] so much in the six seals message to um
[31:55] yeah so um
[31:57] so anyway let's just read here so
[31:58] revelation 6 and verse 12. so we read as
[32:01] we went through the fifth seal last time
[32:04] it says here and i beheld when he had
[32:07] opened the sixth seal and though there
[32:08] was a great earthquake
[32:10] and the sun became black as sackcloth of
[32:12] here and the moon became his blood and
[32:14] the stars of heaven fell onto the earth
[32:16] even as a fig tree casteth her untimely
[32:18] figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind
[32:21] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[32:24] it was rolled together and every
[32:25] mountain and ireland were moved out of
[32:27] their places and the kings of the earth
[32:30] and the great men and the rich men and
[32:31] the chief captains and the mighty men
[32:33] every bond man every free man hid
[32:35] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[32:38] of the mountains
[32:39] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[32:41] on us and hide us from the face of him
[32:43] that sitteth on the throne and from the
[32:46] wrath of the lamb
[32:47] for the great day of his wrath has come
[32:50] and who shall be able to stand amen
[32:53] sisters bow heads and word of prayer
[32:55] gracious heavenly father
[32:57] i'm just very thankful that what we're
[32:59] about to hear tonight
[33:01] we don't have to be in
[33:03] lord jesus because we know this is
[33:05] during jacob's trouble or the great
[33:07] tribulation time but you promised
[33:09] there'd be a bride on the earth that
[33:11] would not taste death but would walk
[33:12] with you and would be not
[33:14] lord because you'll take her away lord
[33:16] jesus you will keep her from this great
[33:18] wrath that you're going to pour out upon
[33:19] the earth so that's why i can say thank
[33:21] you lord i don't i don't have to go
[33:23] there lord because you've made a way
[33:25] lord jesus for us to escape that wrath
[33:27] to come and go to be with you for
[33:29] eternity
[33:31] but dear god i still ask dear lord may
[33:33] you anoint this father to our hearts
[33:36] may it live in our lives lord jesus lord
[33:39] may it stir us up
[33:40] father knowing that soon and very soon
[33:43] lord these scriptures will be fulfilled
[33:45] lord they may have been sitting in
[33:47] prophecy for hundreds and hundreds of
[33:49] years but now has come the time soon
[33:51] will be that it will be fulfilled so i
[33:53] pray give us real heart for this world
[33:55] and everyone we come in contact with oh
[33:58] god that
[33:59] lord through much prayer we can seek and
[34:01] seek after those whose names are written
[34:03] in the land's book of life and whosoever
[34:05] will lord jesus that they would come and
[34:07] drink of the waters of life freely
[34:09] father and meet you so may you granted i
[34:11] pray we thank you for this evening lord
[34:13] also ask for the prayer time we're about
[34:15] to have after this as well lord may not
[34:16] be us praying but mate you'll be praying
[34:18] through us lord there's many needs oh
[34:20] god this world is reeling under heavy
[34:22] things but i pray to god that you would
[34:25] take our voices and our lips and our
[34:27] tongues and just pray what you would
[34:28] have prayed granted for your glory lord
[34:30] in jesus christ's name amen
[34:33] means you may have your seats i just
[34:34] thought very briefly to um
[34:37] kind of overlap from last because it's
[34:38] been a while since we went through the
[34:40] fifth seal because we had locked down
[34:41] and now here we are and
[34:43] um so the fifth seal we know are the
[34:45] souls under the altar which are the jews
[34:47] which they receive eternal life because
[34:49] they stood for the word of god and the
[34:51] testimony that they held it's not
[34:53] christians
[34:55] because they're crying as souls under
[34:56] the altar saying how long until god you
[34:58] avenge your blood you know so they're
[35:00] calling out for vengeance and we know
[35:01] christians cannot call out for revenge
[35:03] but they call out for mercy
[35:05] amen
[35:06] that man is a bit of a you know don't
[35:09] just look at me yeah that's how we
[35:10] should be remember jesus jesus when he
[35:12] was dying on the cross he'd father
[35:13] forgive them they don't know what they
[35:14] do stephen was being stoned he said lord
[35:17] do not lay this to their charge so
[35:18] that's how we should be so the souls
[35:20] under the altar and the fifth seal they
[35:22] are jews and it ties into where um it
[35:26] says in matthew 24 when the lord we know
[35:28] he's asked three questions when will be
[35:30] the destruction of the temple the sign
[35:32] of his coming in the end of the world
[35:33] and through matthew 24 25 he answers
[35:36] those questions but but he says here in
[35:38] matthew 24 and 29 says immediately after
[35:41] the tribulation of those days
[35:43] shall the sun be darkened and the moon
[35:44] shall not give her light and the stars
[35:46] shall fall from heaven and the powers of
[35:48] the heavens shall be shaken
[35:50] and then shall appear the
[35:52] sign of the son of man in heaven and
[35:54] then shall all the tribes the earth
[35:55] mourn they shall see the son of man
[35:57] coming in the clouds of heaven with
[35:59] power and great glory so this here so it
[36:02] says after the tribulation of those days
[36:04] now this is not the great tribulation
[36:05] this is the tribula the amateur
[36:07] tribulation brother brahm calls it that
[36:09] happened during world war ii that was an
[36:11] amateur tribulation
[36:13] and if you've ever looked at or looked
[36:15] at documentaries or studied world war ii
[36:18] if that's an amateur tribulation i don't
[36:20] want to be when it's the if i can say
[36:22] not saying it as a joke but the full
[36:23] real life tribulation
[36:25] because that was incredibly what i know
[36:28] how many million tens of millions of
[36:29] people lost their lives in that carnage
[36:32] and so
[36:34] this tribulation of those days is that
[36:36] and this is where the um the souls under
[36:39] the altar part of that portion of them
[36:40] were killed under brotherhood says under
[36:42] the eichmann and you know you know
[36:44] hitler in different ones how they wanted
[36:45] to exterminate the jews so
[36:47] um but then they had to rest a while
[36:49] till their fellow servants are also
[36:51] killed as well which we understand i
[36:53] believe is 144 000 in the great
[36:56] tribulation period but in the great
[36:57] tribulation period there are 144 000
[37:00] jews are called because the dispensation
[37:03] of grace has already ended to the
[37:04] gentiles that's winding up right now i'm
[37:07] thank god we're in if you're in praise
[37:08] the lord you want to be the most help
[37:10] happy person in all the world that you
[37:12] got in before the door shut
[37:14] hallelujah but remember the reason you
[37:16] gotten is because god called you and you
[37:17] responded to that call but don't don't
[37:20] be called and not respond pick up the
[37:22] phone
[37:23] swipe to answer say here i am lord
[37:25] i don't mean that as a joke but you know
[37:27] if he's calling respond
[37:29] amen
[37:31] more than anything else you want to get
[37:32] in and then just thank god you're in and
[37:34] then have a burden for everyone else on
[37:36] the outside but just thank god you're in
[37:38] um
[37:39] and so
[37:41] uh yeah so the dispensation so in the
[37:44] great tribulation time there's no
[37:46] there's no salvation for the gentiles
[37:48] because god has turned back to the jews
[37:50] and that's why israel is a nation again
[37:52] because there will be 144 000 jews in
[37:54] the promised land amen that will receive
[37:56] the same lord jesus christ we have
[37:59] glory
[38:00] amen and we know that uh just this sixth
[38:03] seal here is also the time of jacob's
[38:06] trouble as it's called in the old
[38:07] testament or the great tribulation where
[38:09] there's a great interruption of nature
[38:11] that's what we just read and the two
[38:14] prophets that actually you could say
[38:15] open the seal brother brown says is the
[38:17] two witnesses of revelations 11 which is
[38:20] the ministry of moses and elijah that
[38:21] return back to the jews because a real
[38:24] jew will only accept a prophet
[38:26] so so when we're in the wedding supper
[38:28] in the sky then god sends these prophets
[38:31] or anoints their ministry or you know
[38:33] because i believe they're possibly
[38:34] already on the earth right now
[38:36] right they must be there you know
[38:37] brother brown at the age of 37 even
[38:39] though god was dealing with him through
[38:41] the you know through his life at the age
[38:42] of 37 he met the lord in the cave and
[38:45] god commissioned him to take the two
[38:46] gifts of healing you know in his hand
[38:48] and discernment to take the gift of
[38:50] healing to the world and it sparked a
[38:51] revival so he was walking around for 37
[38:54] years wondering about his life and you
[38:56] know all these supernatural things
[38:57] happening and then finally at the right
[38:58] time because remember at the same time
[39:00] brother brown was called in
[39:02] 1946 47.
[39:05] someone
[39:06] helped me
[39:07] yep
[39:08] 47. yep israel became a nation in 1948
[39:13] right and the world council of churches
[39:14] really formed at that time as well so
[39:17] here was a prophet seen to call the
[39:18] bride for the lord jesus israel became a
[39:21] nation in the homeland and then the
[39:23] world council of churches the tears were
[39:25] beginning to be bound
[39:27] everything being orchestrated by the
[39:28] scripture everything everything coming
[39:30] together as the same thing in the great
[39:32] tribulation there will be the wrath of
[39:33] the lamb is pulled out poured out upon
[39:36] the world but in israel the 144 thousand
[39:39] being sealed by the holy ghost i mean
[39:41] under the ministry of moses and elijah
[39:43] and at that same time we're in the
[39:44] wedding sap in the sky rejoicing so the
[39:46] sixth seal just to condense it before we
[39:48] listen to this because i thought i
[39:49] better kind of give a real brief
[39:51] overview because it's hard i found it as
[39:53] i said hard to find a snippet within the
[39:54] message that it you know this is the
[39:57] whole like a whole thought condensed
[39:58] into a bit um so it's a great
[40:01] interruption of nature brother braham
[40:02] says that the ones that really open the
[40:04] seal are the two prophets because you
[40:06] know both the
[40:08] ministry of moses and elijah were an
[40:10] interruption of nature
[40:11] moses yeah i mean i mean yeah moses
[40:14] darkness upon egypt
[40:16] turn turn the nile into blood you know
[40:17] all those you know hail came down great
[40:19] you know interruption of nature elijah
[40:21] said not one bit of jewel rain will fall
[40:23] till i call for it interruption of
[40:24] nature and that's what these ones will
[40:26] do they'll just plague the whole earth
[40:28] fire it says comes out of their mouth
[40:30] and consumes their enemy all these
[40:31] things happen and but then it says that
[40:33] they are killed
[40:35] and they lay on the in in jerusalem it
[40:38] says for i think three three days and
[40:40] the whole world sees it
[40:42] now can you ask ever was a time when the
[40:44] whole world can watch an event live
[40:50] i wonder what's happening with those two
[40:51] dead bodies
[40:52] and you know and you can just watch it
[40:54] the whole world can watch it even in the
[40:56] back blocks of new guinea they can live
[40:58] stream things
[40:59] you know so it's the whole world
[41:02] and but then they see then they're
[41:03] resurrected and they get taken up into
[41:05] heaven but this is the season because
[41:06] the technology
[41:08] technology is here for the whole world
[41:09] to see it but thank god we're not here
[41:12] i'm so glad
[41:13] that the lord found us to say you don't
[41:15] have to go through this i took your
[41:17] great tribulation i took that judgment
[41:20] on the cross for you that you don't have
[41:22] to suffer and go through amen because
[41:24] remember he took our judgment on calvary
[41:26] the wrath of god was put out upon him
[41:28] that we should have received
[41:31] hallelujah because god's law must uh you
[41:34] know what's the law without a punishment
[41:36] so so the law said they either of they
[41:38] you shall die i mean to the lord jesus
[41:40] our lord jesus took that punishment upon
[41:42] himself that we don't have to die as a
[41:44] sinner we don't have to go to hell he
[41:46] took that for us that we can go to
[41:47] heaven
[41:48] so thanks be to god for this great hour
[41:51] amen so without further ado
[41:54] god bless you but yeah i encourage you
[41:55] go listen to the whole
[41:57] whole tape
[41:59] if you haven't already

[42:46] [Music]
[42:48] lord
[42:49] we are again
[42:52] gathering it for the service
[42:56] and we think of the time in the early
[42:58] days when they all come up to shiloh
[43:02] for the blessings of the lord and now
[43:04] tonight we have assembled here
[43:07] to hear your word
[43:09] and as we have been studying in this
[43:11] certain portion of the scripture
[43:14] that the lamb was the only one that
[43:16] could open the seals or to loose them
[43:30] but we find out
[43:32] now that israel in that time of trouble
[43:35] when he was jacob he wrestled with the
[43:38] got a hold of something that was real
[43:41] there was a man come down jacob got his
[43:44] arms around him

[43:48] the thought said i must be going that's
[43:49] coming daylight oh that breaking of the
[43:51] day

[43:59] right with you
[44:01] i won't things change here
[44:04] that's that 144 000 that money scheming
[44:08] bunch and things like that when they see
[44:10] the true genuine thing to get a hold of
[44:12] their stands moses and their sins elijah

[44:19] 144 000 of the tribes of israel are
[44:22] called out right now

[46:06] forth on hand towards heaven that
[46:09] there may be darkness over the land of
[46:12] egypt even darkness which may be felt
[46:16] and moses stretched forth his hand
[46:19] towards heaven and there came a thick
[46:21] darkness in all the land of egypt three
[46:25] days
[46:27] now they saw not one another
[46:30] neither rose
[46:32] any from his place
[46:34] or three days but the children of israel
[46:37] had lied in their dwellings
[46:39] notice
[46:41] zach come over here and the sun became
[46:43] as black as sacral the
[46:46] same thing these happenings of nature
[46:49] what was it
[46:50] what when that nature happens like this
[46:52] has been
[46:55] god calling
[46:57] israel
[46:59] see
[47:00] god's calling out israel
[47:03] now son is black is hair
[47:06] now
[47:07] god
[47:08] was about to deliver israel there
[47:12] all right bring them out of their
[47:15] enemy's hand which was egypt at that
[47:17] time now here he is
[47:20] bringing them out of the
[47:22] roman hand
[47:24] where they made their covenant same
[47:26] thing happens that's the plagues that
[47:29] the time in this plague will call it'll
[47:32] plague this
[47:33] uh group of gentiles
[47:36] if we had time i could show what's going
[47:37] to happen to that gentile church the
[47:39] bible said that the
[47:42] the dragon satan
[47:44] was rough that's
[47:46] angry
[47:48] with the woman the jew
[47:50] israel
[47:51] and he spreading water from his mouth
[47:53] thickness and multitudes of people that
[47:56] went to make war with the remnant of the
[48:00] woman's seed
[48:02] revelations 13 9 see there we have that
[48:05] and
[48:06] that's when
[48:07] israel sends her i mean rome sends her
[48:10] army after the remnant the remnant of
[48:13] the woman's seat now watch
[48:16] the first time there are enemies hands
[48:19] when he's delivered about his son turn
[48:20] to sac the black is cycle
[48:23] now this is the second time the end of
[48:25] the tribulation period now
[48:27] in daniel 12
[48:30] if we had time we could read it and
[48:32] daniel the 12th the 12th verse
[48:36] 12th chapter other daniel said every one
[48:40] that was found written in the book
[48:43] would be delivered i remember daniel is
[48:46] now speaking of this period
[48:48] when this this thing is supposed to
[48:49] happen
[48:50] when
[48:51] israel is to be delivered when the the
[48:54] end of their 70th week
[48:56] and
[48:57] that's when they're supposed to be
[48:59] delivered now look unless we get to
[49:01] daniel 12 here just a minute
[49:03] and at that time
[49:05] michael shall stand up the great prince
[49:08] which stood for the children
[49:09] for
[49:10] or the children of thy people
[49:14] see that's jews
[49:18] and there shall be a trouble such never
[49:20] was since there was a nation even to
[49:22] that same time now compare that exactly
[49:25] what jesus said matthew 24.
[49:27] there shall be a time of trouble has
[49:29] never been since there was a nation look
[49:31] at this sixth seal
[49:33] see the same thing a time of trouble
[49:36] notice
[49:37] since there wasn't even to the same time
[49:40] and at that time thy people now in this
[49:43] seven last part of the seventh year thy
[49:46] people shall be delivered every one that
[49:48] shall be found
[49:51] written
[49:52] in the book
[49:54] the predestinated you see it's written
[49:56] in the lamb's book of life shall be
[49:58] delivered at that time
[50:01] and many of those that sleep in the dust
[50:03] the earth shall await
[50:05] and some to everlasting life and someday
[50:08] everlasting shame and contentment now
[50:10] and then shall the wise shine as a
[50:13] brightness of the firmaments and and
[50:16] they that turn many to righteous shall
[50:17] disguise the stars forever and ever
[50:20] that the way he had told daniel shut up
[50:22] the book where he'd be resting in his
[50:24] lot for that time now see don't make it
[50:26] everywhere you live or die you come
[50:28] forth anyhow
[50:29] he don't
[50:30] dying isn't nothing to a christian he
[50:32] don't die anyhow
[50:34] now
[50:35] daniel 12 said that everyone that was
[50:37] found written in the book would be
[50:40] delivered
[50:43] here god is about to deliver his second
[50:46] son israel
[50:48] after the tribulation see the second
[50:50] time israel is israel is his son you
[50:52] know that israel is god's son so he's
[50:56] going to deliver him here in the
[50:58] tribulation period just exactly the way
[51:01] he did down in egypt now let's stop here
[51:03] again and get something else so before
[51:06] we bring it into home now watch your
[51:08] these two prophets look what they're

[51:23] hundred and three score days clothed in
[51:25] sackcloth

[51:29] was reveal the temple and the two
[51:31] candlesticks that stand before the god

[51:39] sword
[51:40] word thereby their enemies and if any
[51:42] man shall hurt them he must in this
[51:45] manner be killed now we know the fire in

[58:17] now look
[58:19] the yeah god is about to deliver his son
[58:23] israel after the same manner of the
[58:26] tribulation that he did down there he
[58:29] sent moses down there and delivered
[58:32] israel is that right and he done these
[58:34] very same things he sent elijah to ahab
[58:38] seven thousand come out that right
[58:41] he sends him right back over here again
[58:42] at the time of the tribulation and calls
[58:45] out the hundred and forty four thousand
[58:48] i see you notice between revelation
[58:51] between the sixth chapter of the sixth
[58:53] flag
[58:54] seal party the sixth seal and the
[58:56] seventh seal the seventh chapter of
[58:58] revelation mathematically set together
[59:01] right
[59:03] just like america is number 13 13 states
[59:07] is started with 13 stars in the flag 13
[59:10] colonies 13 stripes everything's 13 13
[59:13] and it appears right here in the 13th
[59:14] chapter of revelations
[59:17] that's right she's 13 and a woman
[59:21] now
[59:22] when he
[59:24] was about to deliver his only begotten
[59:26] son
[59:27] which was his only begotten jacob is his
[59:30] son but this is the only begotten son
[59:32] matthew 27 let's see what he did there
[59:37] matthew the 27th chapter
[59:40] now remember
[59:42] his son had been beaten
[59:44] and had been troubled
[59:46] and they had made fun of him
[59:48] and he was now
[59:50] hanging on the cross at three o'clock
[59:53] on good friday afternoon
[59:56] just about to take place matthew 27
[59:59] chapter of matthew and the
[1:00:02] the 45th
[1:00:05] verse i believe it is
[1:00:07] now from the sixth hour
[1:00:09] there was darkness over all the land
[1:00:12] until the ninth hour
[1:00:15] now
[1:00:16] notice just exactly what he did back
[1:00:18] here now in this sea and i beheld when
[1:00:20] he had opened the sixth seal low there
[1:00:22] was a great earthquake and the sun
[1:00:24] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[1:00:26] the moon
[1:00:27] and the moon
[1:00:29] became his blood
[1:00:31] blackness darkness egypt blackness
[1:00:34] darkness
[1:00:35] god delivering
[1:00:37] jesus at the cross this before he
[1:00:39] brought him up to the resurrection first
[1:00:41] darkness
[1:00:43] sun went out in the middle of the day
[1:00:45] stars wouldn't shine
[1:00:48] two days samantha's gonna raise him up
[1:00:50] with a mighty triumph
[1:00:52] at the sun and moon and stars and
[1:00:54] everything in egypt all these taking
[1:00:56] place he delivered israel to the
[1:00:58] promised land here isn't a tribulation
[1:01:00] spirit here stands them
[1:01:02] prophets to who has the control of the
[1:01:04] word that god gives them they can only
[1:01:06] speak as god gives them the word amen
[1:01:09] now they're not gods they're temporarily
[1:01:11] uh amateurly they are because jesus said
[1:01:14] they were
[1:01:15] said you call them gods who the word of
[1:01:17] god came but look that's the one that
[1:01:19] god brings the word to and when he
[1:01:21] speaks it it happens amen that's all and
[1:01:24] here he is with the commission from god
[1:01:27] to smite the earth whatever he wants to
[1:01:30] oh
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:32] stop the heavens
[1:01:34] and he does what's the matter he's
[1:01:36] fixing to take the 144 thousand out for
[1:01:40] redemption out of the book of redemption
[1:01:42] and that's under the seal of redemption
[1:01:45] and the sixth seal that's it my dear
[1:01:47] friend
