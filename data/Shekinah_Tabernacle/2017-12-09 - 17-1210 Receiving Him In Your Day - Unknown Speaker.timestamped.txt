[32:36] sorry oh here we go
[32:42] so I brother our man down oh here we go
[32:44] I'm gonna have to hit me yeah it's me
[32:51] okay
[32:51] as long as you're up this was still
[32:52] alive yeah let's go to st. John 13 and
[32:55] verse 20 it's got a few um and then
[33:07] we're gonna go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 so
[33:10] st. John 13 of verse 20
[33:17] so see it's here Jesus speaking velly
[33:22] velly which means absolutely absolutely
[33:24] I say unto you he that receiveth
[33:26] whomsoever I send receiveth me and he
[33:31] that receiveth me receiveth him that
[33:34] sent me so you've got to receive who God
[33:38] sends and if you receive her God sends
[33:41] you receive him they meant and let's go
[33:44] to 1st Peter chapter 1 I mean sorry 2nd
[33:48] Peter chapter 1 so she can Peter 1 and
[33:59] verses 10 to 12 and this is sort of a
[34:06] context here but he says here wherefore
[34:09] the rather brethren give diligence to
[34:12] make your calling and election sure for
[34:15] if you do these things you shall never
[34:18] fall for an for so an entrance shall be
[34:22] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[34:23] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[34:25] Savior Jesus Christ
[34:27] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[34:30] you always in remembrance of these
[34:32] things though you know them and be
[34:35] established in the present truth can
[34:38] everyone say present truth not past
[34:42] truth not future truth present you've
[34:45] got to be established won't be able
[34:46] establish and present truth amen may the
[34:49] Lord blesses word you may have your
[34:51] seats this morning I want to take a a
[34:54] bit of a Bible study this morning and I
[34:58] want to show you through the scripture
[35:00] that in every generation God sent a word
[35:03] to that generation and the people had to
[35:05] receive that word and if the people
[35:07] received that word they were redeemed if
[35:09] they rejected it they were not redeemed
[35:11] and we're gonna go from Genesis all the
[35:13] way into today and I want to take that
[35:15] as a principle we read there and in John
[35:18] 13 if you he that receiveth whomsoever I
[35:23] see and receiveth me so he want to
[35:25] receive whoever God scenes and he that
[35:28] receiveth me
[35:29] see with him that sent me this is this
[35:30] is a Bible principle and we're going to
[35:34] read from first John if you still got
[35:36] your Bibles handy if you can read it on
[35:37] this screen here first John and we're
[35:42] going to read most of chapter 1
[35:58] actually we're gonna read the entire
[35:59] thing I believe now it says here that
[36:02] which was from the beginning I remember
[36:04] John as the disciple a call of love he's
[36:07] going to bring out some scriptural
[36:09] principles here he said that which was
[36:11] from the beginning which we have heard
[36:12] which we have seen with our eyes which
[36:15] we have looked upon and our hands have
[36:17] handled of the word of life for the life
[36:19] was manifested and we have seen it and
[36:21] bear witness and show unto you that
[36:23] eternal life which was with the father
[36:26] and was manifested unto us that which we
[36:29] have seen and heard declare we unto you
[36:31] that ye also may have fellowship with us
[36:34] and truly our Fellowship is with the
[36:37] father and with the son Jesus Christ and
[36:40] these things right we unto you that your
[36:43] joy may be full as he is here this then
[36:47] is the message which we have heard of
[36:49] him so this is the message I mean it's a
[36:51] message that this is still the message
[36:53] this is the message of the hour I mean
[36:55] this then is the message which we heard
[36:57] of him and declare unto you that God is
[36:59] light and in him is no darkness at all
[37:02] if we say that we have fellowship with
[37:04] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[37:07] not the truth I mean see here comes now
[37:10] a bit of a demarcation you've got a you
[37:12] can't if you're walking in darkness now
[37:14] I'll just throw it out there right now
[37:15] this world is in religious darkness and
[37:17] there's religion everywhere doesn't
[37:20] matter what what denomination doesn't
[37:22] matter what Buddhists or Islam or
[37:24] whatever it may be this world is groping
[37:26] in religious darkness but we don't want
[37:29] to be in that so if we now but if we
[37:32] walk so he says if we say we have
[37:34] fellowship I'm going to read verse 6
[37:35] again if we say we have fellowship with
[37:37] him and walk and walk and darkness we
[37:40] lie and do not the truth but now notice
[37:43] where it says but if we walk in the
[37:44] light as he is in the light we have
[37:47] fellowship one with another that's us in
[37:49] God and the blood of Jesus Christ His
[37:51] Son cleanses us from all sin so he's
[37:55] laying out a principle if you walk in
[37:57] the light as he is in the light then
[38:00] your fellowship you and God if you walk
[38:02] in that light and then the blood of
[38:04] Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin
[38:06] but over a billion people upon the earth
[38:08] claim the cross but
[38:10] walking in the light of their hour
[38:12] that's from the scripture I'm going to
[38:15] show you this all the way through the
[38:16] Bible is not just some funny idea that's
[38:18] been cooked up someplace this is all the
[38:20] way through the scripture the people
[38:22] received who God sent they received that
[38:24] word and they were redeemed under that
[38:26] word and those who rejected the word
[38:28] they didn't receive Redemption and we
[38:30] all want to be redeemed do we not we
[38:32] want to be restored back to what we were
[38:33] meant to be in the beginning do we not I
[38:35] mean so we must walk in the light as he
[38:37] is in the life and then we have
[38:39] fellowship one with another us and God
[38:42] who wants fellowship with God today and
[38:44] not just today but every day their life
[38:46] Lord I want to walk with you I want to
[38:48] hear your voice I want you to accompany
[38:50] me through life's journey that is not me
[38:53] leading myself it's you amen but if you
[38:56] reject the light you're in darkness and
[38:58] you're not walking with him I mean but
[39:00] if you receive the light hallelujah then
[39:03] you're walking with him and then the
[39:05] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all
[39:07] Al Elson Amen now I want to let's go I
[39:17] want to continue so this this is the
[39:20] first job we're just still reading down
[39:22] he says if we save them we have no sin
[39:24] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[39:26] not in us if we confess our sins he's
[39:28] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[39:30] and to cleanse us from all
[39:31] unrighteousness if we say we have not
[39:34] sinned we make him a liar and his word
[39:37] is not in us amen now let's go to
[39:41] Genesis chapter 4 we're gonna I'm gonna
[39:45] take this all the way through Genesis
[39:48] chapter 4 as the first record we know
[39:52] Adam and Eve worship God in the garden
[39:54] but this is the first record of
[39:58] believers bringing a sacrifice to to
[40:01] worship God now let's just read the
[40:04] scripture there more then we'll go and
[40:05] he says now and Adam knew his wife and
[40:08] she conceived and bare Cain and said
[40:11] I've gotten a man from the Lord and we
[40:13] know all life comes from God and she
[40:15] again bare his brother Abel and Abel was
[40:18] a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a
[40:19] tiller of the ground and in the process
[40:21] of time it came to pass that Cain
[40:24] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[40:26] offering unto the Lord and Abel he also
[40:28] brought of the firstlings of his flock
[40:30] and the fat thereof and the Lord had
[40:33] respect unto Abel and to his offering
[40:35] but unto Cain and to his offering he had
[40:38] not respect and Cain was very wroth and
[40:41] his countenance fell that means he got
[40:43] angry he got angry at God that God did
[40:47] not receive his worship he was angry
[40:49] that God did not accept his sacrifice
[40:51] and in Hebrews 11 it says Abel offered a
[40:54] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[40:56] Cain
[40:57] so Cain offered an excellent sacrifice
[40:59] he wasn't coming hard
[41:01] I'm half-heartedly he wasn't coming full
[41:03] of doubt in his mind he was a believer
[41:05] he was a believer and he knew that that
[41:08] that his parents fell from from eternity
[41:11] from an eternal state and are now in
[41:14] time and centered come into the world
[41:16] and he is trying to offer something that
[41:18] could give him access back into this
[41:19] eternal world that's why that's why they
[41:22] offered because I want to access heaven
[41:24] they want to speak to God God I want to
[41:26] talk to you I would have worship I want
[41:28] to worship you I want to give you an
[41:30] offering I mean I want to be forgiven of
[41:32] my sins my fallen state I wanted to be
[41:34] covered over I wanted to be done away
[41:36] with but he brought his this is the best
[41:39] I have I mean he brought something and
[41:42] it was an excellent sacrifice but it's
[41:45] not what God required Abel knew it was
[41:47] blood in the garden and Adam and Eve
[41:50] were covered in an animal skins when
[41:52] they left the garden and he knew it was
[41:54] they had to be a a life for a life
[41:56] hallelujah and so he knew he knew it
[42:00] wasn't it wasn't vegetables
[42:02] it wasn't an apple it wasn't an apricot
[42:05] that their Eve ate amen
[42:08] but there's a blood sin in the garden
[42:10] and blood was required to restore
[42:12] fellowship again and God received Abel's
[42:16] sacrifice and I don't have it in my
[42:18] notes but you keep reading down and God
[42:21] goes to Cain and God says to Cain just
[42:23] through like your brother did and you'll
[42:25] be accepted why don't you just do like
[42:27] he did you don't need to understand the
[42:29] fullness of what's going on you don't
[42:31] need to comprehend what's going on you
[42:33] don't even need a revelation just do
[42:35] like your brother did
[42:37] you'll be received I mean anise and that
[42:40] same spirit that was there as prison in
[42:42] the South I mean brother Bram says and
[42:44] god of this evil H he tells us that the
[42:47] same spirits able worship by revelation
[42:49] and Cain worship by intellectual
[42:52] understanding they see it those same
[42:54] spirits he said I standing here in this
[42:56] tabernacle this morning I mean they were
[42:58] standing there when the messenger was
[43:00] delivering the word and I'll say that
[43:02] same spirit is here first spirits are
[43:04] here in this place I mean you've got to
[43:06] think about it now are you worshiping
[43:08] God because of intellectual
[43:10] understanding and I understand this and
[43:12] I agree with this and this makes sense
[43:13] here or is it a divine revelation that
[43:16] God has revealed himself to you and
[43:18] that's why you worship hallelujah it's
[43:20] like this this Bible because of
[43:22] tradition we believe this is the Word of
[43:25] God by tradition in by fair we believe
[43:27] this is the Word of God but it has to go
[43:29] beyond that God has to reveal this is me
[43:32] in print form this is me in print form
[43:35] hallelujah
[43:36] it's going to be a revelation this is
[43:37] God's Word and God has protected us word
[43:40] all the way down through the ages we
[43:42] don't need a multiple bunch of
[43:44] translations and to know the original
[43:46] language you've got to know the author
[43:48] of his work and go pre Texas word and
[43:50] God will guide you into his word
[43:53] hallelujah so those same spirits are
[43:55] here
[43:56] I trust you worsening by revelation he
[43:59] died for me on Calvary and it's more
[44:01] than a story more than a tradition more
[44:03] than because mommy and daddy told it to
[44:05] me when I was little but something
[44:07] became he became a living reality amen
[44:11] now this is this is brother Branham and
[44:15] so I don't have the message title he
[44:17] sees he wants to be religious as his
[44:20] main he wants to be religious though but
[44:23] he wants it in his own way and he's so
[44:26] much like Cain Cain wanted to be
[44:29] religious so he went and made his own
[44:31] religion and when he did he brought up
[44:33] before God with something like this
[44:35] here's the best I got this is all I can
[44:38] do about it now take it or leave it
[44:40] that's about the way man does today I
[44:44] helped build the church I've seen my
[44:46] children to the church there I put my
[44:48] money in every year now that's the best
[44:51] can do take it or leave it Oh see he
[44:54] wants his own way man wants his own way
[44:56] you know sin didn't start on the earth
[44:58] that started in heaven and it started in
[45:01] the heart of a being called Lucifer and
[45:03] it started when he said I will I will
[45:06] ascend I will be like the Most High
[45:09] amen that's where sin started when he
[45:11] said I will become this I will be
[45:13] worshipped
[45:14] I'll have up my own way and that same
[45:16] full of nature is now because the
[45:18] original sin has come into humanity and
[45:20] humans say I will I'll do it my way
[45:23] I'll do it how I feel this is more
[45:25] convenient for me this makes more seats
[45:27] this is more inline with the popular
[45:29] opinion of the day who cares about those
[45:31] things I mean Jesus was our example he
[45:34] said not my will but thy will be done
[45:37] hallelujah he gave his example he showed
[45:40] you this is how you should be as a
[45:42] believer I don't want my will I don't
[45:44] want my opinion
[45:45] I don't want how I feel about it I want
[45:47] his will and as well as his word God's
[45:50] will is his word people say I'm seeking
[45:52] the will of God and here it is in print
[45:55] form
[45:55] I mean we're gonna live in a hundred
[45:57] types of God's message being sent and
[45:59] the will of God is recorded in that
[46:00] spoken word and people say I need the
[46:03] will of God for my life spend some time
[46:05] on your knees and prayer reading the
[46:06] word and you'll find the will of God
[46:09] hallelujah because every situation life
[46:12] is in this word hallelujah how I raise
[46:15] my children it's in the message how I
[46:18] should treat my wife it's in the message
[46:19] how does it treat my husband it's in the
[46:21] message everything is in there you got a
[46:24] search program go look
[46:26] Amen would be foolish not to hallelujah
[46:31] now that's the best I can do take it or
[46:34] leave it
[46:34] Oh see he wants his own way that's the
[46:37] way Cain did but God still loved them
[46:40] and he still went after him what did God
[46:43] tell Cain you'll do well if you'll just
[46:45] worship like your brother Abel Abel came
[46:48] God's Way but Cain wanted his way and
[46:51] God said now Cain I've got nothing
[46:53] against you but if you just come over
[46:55] and go the way that Abel goes you'll do
[46:57] well but he hated Abel he thought Abel
[47:00] was a Holy Roller he hasn't changed his
[47:02] opinion he thought
[47:04] was a religious fanatic and he still
[47:06] believes that that's his formal ideas in
[47:09] his culture of his own brain it's better
[47:11] than that of the baptism of the Holy
[47:12] Ghost amen
[47:16] I don't want to fulfill that category of
[47:19] person myself
[47:23] now we're gonna go here this is a
[47:29] foundation of the scripture in Matthew
[47:31] 16 when Jesus comes and he speaks to his
[47:35] disciples he wants to know what's being
[47:37] revealed to them and he says when Jesus
[47:40] came into the coasts of Caesarea
[47:41] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[47:44] whom do men say that I the Son of Man
[47:46] end and they said some say thou art John
[47:49] the Baptist some Elias or Jeremias or
[47:51] one of the prophets he saith unto them
[47:53] but whom whom say ye that I am and Simon
[47:58] Peter answered and said thou art the
[48:00] Christ the Son of the Living God now I
[48:02] know I've probably gone through this
[48:03] many times but Jesus wants to know he
[48:06] wasn't really interested about the
[48:07] people thought of him he wanted to know
[48:09] what do what do these disciples that
[48:11] I've gathered what do they think of me
[48:13] who what has been revealed to them that
[48:15] I am hallelujah and Peter had the
[48:18] revelation thou art the Christ now art
[48:22] the Messiah you're more than a prophet
[48:24] you're more than a religious man your
[48:26] God became flesh I mean that was
[48:28] revealed to him hallelujah and he says
[48:32] jesus said in jesus answered and said
[48:33] unto Him bless it up now Simon bar Jonah
[48:35] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[48:38] unto thee but my father which is in
[48:40] heaven and I say also unto thee that
[48:43] thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll
[48:45] build my church and the gates of Hell
[48:48] shall not prevail against it now notice
[48:50] the Catholics say that the church is
[48:52] built upon Peter the partisan say many
[48:54] that the church is built upon Jesus but
[48:56] you see from this chapter this scripture
[48:59] here the whole conversation is about
[49:01] Revelation what has been revealed to the
[49:04] people are your son prophet what's been
[49:06] revealed to you are your the Christ it
[49:08] is blessed art thou simon barjona
[49:10] because flesh and blood has not revealed
[49:12] thus you at see the whole conversations
[49:15] about revelation my father in heaven
[49:17] has revealed us to you and upon this
[49:19] rock the spiritual revelation of Who I
[49:24] am
[49:25] the spiritual when God reveals it to you
[49:29] this is the Christ the Son of the Living
[49:32] God amen that means you're built upon
[49:35] the rock the rock of Revelation and the
[49:38] Prophet tells us I mean we need to pray
[49:40] for Revelation and of his word
[49:42] we need it's more important than you
[49:45] even understand I mean to have the
[49:47] revelation of who Jesus Christ is it's
[49:50] incredibly important because if you know
[49:52] who he is then you know who you are and
[49:54] nothing that happens in this world can
[49:56] move you doesn't matter what your family
[49:58] does what your country does what your
[50:01] neighborhood does your standing upon a
[50:03] rock and you shall not be moved
[50:05] amen now this question who do you say
[50:10] who do you say I am this question is not
[50:15] just back to the disciples it's easy for
[50:18] us to read the scripture says yes Jesus
[50:20] is the Christ he's the Messiah he came
[50:22] from God to die you know he came out of
[50:25] God came out of God's bosom was
[50:26] manifested in the flesh
[50:28] ami took our sins upon himself went to
[50:30] Calvary hallelujah went down to hell
[50:32] took the keys off Satan ascended
[50:35] hallelujah came out of the tomb released
[50:38] his spirit on the day of Pentecost week
[50:39] it's easier to say it because it's
[50:41] history it's recorded even historians
[50:44] that didn't believe in Jesus being the
[50:46] Messiah I mean they still recorded he
[50:48] was alive
[50:49] I mean Josephus was a historian back in
[50:51] that day and he was saying that the
[50:53] disciples they stole his body and ate it
[50:55] it's recorded in history
[50:57] he's a historical figure but I tell you
[51:00] friends that's not enough it's not
[51:02] enough just a point back in history and
[51:03] say yeah that was Jesus back there that
[51:05] same question who do you say I am now
[51:08] Jesus is his word Jesus is his word John
[51:13] st. John 1 and 1 in the beginning was
[51:15] the word and the Word was with God and
[51:17] the Word was God
[51:19] drop down to verse 14 and that word
[51:21] became flesh and dwelt among us he is
[51:23] his word he is his word I mean so it's
[51:27] more than just saying yes that man of
[51:28] Kelly was the Christ I mean but what
[51:31] about in your day in our who do you say
[51:33] I'll say who do you say the Ministry of
[51:36] William Branham is it's not a man from
[51:38] Kentucky I mean it's not just a
[51:40] prophet's ministry it's God revealing
[51:42] himself through a redeemed son the son
[51:45] of man Jesus Christ revealing himself
[51:47] through a son of man as the scripture
[51:49] said it would happen so who do you say
[51:52] this oh that's just his opinion that's
[51:54] just he's molded boys upbringing a
[51:56] certain way and the culture of the day
[51:57] and that's why he preaches the way he
[51:59] does no you gotta go beyond that that's
[52:01] just human understanding but it's got it
[52:04] you've got to hear the voice behind the
[52:05] voice I mean you got a something's got
[52:08] anchor in your soul this is more than a
[52:09] man never a man spake like this man a
[52:12] man it's more than a man speaking this
[52:14] is God speaking this is God speaking
[52:17] hallelujah and if and if you can
[52:19] understand that that word is the Christ
[52:21] amen your life will be a whole bunch
[52:23] different you built upon the revelation
[52:27] of the word amen now we see an um we see
[52:37] in the Ministry of sorry win Cain and
[52:39] Abel were here Cain rejected God's
[52:42] provided way both religious both
[52:45] worshiping but Cain rejected the way and
[52:48] then now he comes Noah so you got to
[52:52] identify the life you currently live you
[52:55] will be identified with someone in the
[52:57] Bible not just believer make believer
[52:59] unbeliever the spirit that's on you now
[53:02] will identify with someone in the Bible
[53:05] doesn't whether you like it or not
[53:07] you're fulfilling something and it
[53:09] doesn't matter what even you say you are
[53:11] it's what you are it's your life proves
[53:13] what you are because Jesus is by their
[53:16] fruit you shall know them not by the not
[53:19] by the tag that's in front of the tree
[53:20] saying this is a cherry tree or this is
[53:22] an oak tree or this is whatever tree
[53:24] it's you don't look at the plaque in
[53:26] front of the tree someone might move the
[53:27] plaque you look at the fruit that's on
[53:29] the tree
[53:30] and that's how you know what it is
[53:31] that's the same thing with a Christian
[53:33] Amen you know they say we people say too
[53:36] much sometimes but it's not it's not
[53:38] your words that prove what you are to
[53:40] your life it's what comes out of you
[53:42] that proves if you're a believer or not
[53:44] hallelujah coz by their fruit you shall
[53:46] know them now he comes Noah let's go
[53:50] back to Noah's day it had never rained
[53:52] in there but the atmosphere and
[53:53] everything was different it never rained
[53:55] and the Bible says it even trade like it
[53:57] does now and here comes a man it just
[53:59] says Jew felt every night that's how the
[54:01] place was watered the earth and so he is
[54:04] he comes a man it's gonna rain God is
[54:08] going to cover this entire world with
[54:10] water I'm gonna build an ark he's
[54:13] showing me Oh heavy has anyone else know
[54:17] about this no it's just this one man I'm
[54:19] gonna build this up anyone who gets into
[54:21] the sack it's gonna be safe from the
[54:23] flood one man he didn't have a whole
[54:26] church backing him up he didn't have
[54:28] some great big movement backing him up
[54:30] one man stood there this is the gods
[54:34] provided way of escape at this endtime
[54:36] because the need was coming upon the
[54:39] earth at that yo of that way of life and
[54:41] so he comes Noah get in the suck no dick
[54:45] no doubt there would having people and
[54:47] they would have said I don't have to get
[54:49] into the sock my for beer Abel offered a
[54:53] lamb coming out of Egypt I mean coming
[54:55] out of Eden and he was accepted I'm just
[54:58] going to offer another lamb I'm just
[55:00] going to offer another land because
[55:02] there's always been blood sacrifice all
[55:03] the way down through I don't need to
[55:05] listen to this man I'm just going to do
[55:06] what Abel didn't know from the past what
[55:09] happened to those ones they died they
[55:12] became souls that are in prison because
[55:13] they rejected God's provided way amen
[55:18] now that's and that's in the beginning
[55:20] of the Bible everyone who didn't get
[55:23] into that Ark perished they could have
[55:26] offered all the lambs they could have
[55:27] they could have been more sincere even
[55:29] maybe that Abel was they all died they
[55:32] all died you say well that's awful rough
[55:37] that's this is a Bible principle if you
[55:39] walk in the light as he is in the light
[55:41] I mean those walk in the light that Noah
[55:44] preach they got in the ark that was the
[55:46] proof that they were actually walking in
[55:48] the light in that day now I've got some
[55:52] titles the Ministry of Moses he comes
[55:55] Moses down they are slaves the people of
[56:00] God are slaves in Egypt and it comes a
[56:04] time now where God has come to fulfill
[56:06] his word God sends Moses down now by
[56:10] this time Abraham Abraham has already
[56:13] come and gone 400 years before this and
[56:15] they were circumcised all the male
[56:17] Hebrews were were circumcised Jews and
[56:20] now he comes he comes Moses and it comes
[56:23] to win the death angels going to strike
[56:24] Egypt and he begins to make an
[56:26] announcement take a lamb for the house
[56:28] keep it about 14 days and take its blood
[56:31] put it on the door and lintel and then
[56:33] roast that lamb you know with bitter
[56:35] herbs and fire and eat the whole thing
[56:37] and if you do this and also push the
[56:40] living out before you do this and he
[56:42] says if you do this then the Death Angel
[56:44] will not not strike they will it will
[56:47] not strike your house now the Hebrews
[56:50] were not immune they were not immune to
[56:52] the to the death angel coming and
[56:54] striking the house amen it was only
[56:56] those who applied the blood only those
[56:59] that applied the blood and they had to
[57:02] they had to eat the entire lamb and if
[57:04] anyone's left over had to be burned with
[57:06] fire go read in Exodus so it wasn't just
[57:08] the nice parts of the word that they had
[57:10] to become one with and wasn't if some
[57:12] knife cuts in the ribs and whatever in
[57:14] the rack and whatever things amen that
[57:16] they did they had to be identified with
[57:18] they did it all doesn't matter what
[57:21] their opinion was I'm not gonna eat that
[57:23] kidney I'm going to eat that liver why
[57:24] don't they eat that yeah it's not it's
[57:26] not your their opinion that mattered God
[57:28] God gave a commandment you've got to
[57:31] become one with the sacrifice you've got
[57:33] to eat the sacrifice hallelujah and if
[57:36] you do this then the death angel will
[57:38] not strike now they could have stood
[57:40] there all the Hebrews they could have
[57:42] said did you hear what Moses said the
[57:44] other day yeah we've got to we've got to
[57:47] kill a lamb and put that blood on the
[57:49] door and lintel of our house and we've
[57:51] got to rush that lamb with bitter herbs
[57:53] and we're going to eat it and and they
[57:55] could say no I'm not doing
[57:57] I don't know about this Moses fellow
[58:00] he's gone a bit funny in his doctrine
[58:02] he's gonna bid off you know in his in
[58:05] his ministry but I know that our father
[58:08] Abraham was circumcised and that's good
[58:11] enough for me because it wasn't a
[58:14] revelation see to someone who said that
[58:17] kind of thing
[58:18] I just accept what God did in history
[58:20] and it's good enough for me
[58:21] now what would have happened to that
[58:23] house I guarantee you the first one
[58:26] would have been dead before the Sun came
[58:28] up death would have struck that house
[58:30] and friends it's not physical death that
[58:33] that we're to be covered from in this
[58:35] day an hour it's spiritual death I mean
[58:37] we're spiritual death can strike a
[58:39] family because the head of that family
[58:41] does not stand for this word does not
[58:43] really stand on the principles of the
[58:45] scripture and saying me and my house are
[58:47] going to serve the Lord and purge out
[58:49] the leaven and apply the blood amen
[58:51] those those houses death strikes I know
[58:54] it's awful strong but it's true it's
[58:56] awful it's true amen spiritual death
[59:00] will strike a family that the people do
[59:02] not have a revelation and they do not
[59:04] even will they say I don't have a
[59:06] revelation Cain God didn't tell Cain
[59:08] you've got to have a revelation I'll
[59:09] wait till you have a revelation came
[59:11] then do it he said just do like your
[59:12] brother did they're like your brother
[59:14] did and you'll be received I want to be
[59:16] received
[59:17] I trust you want to be received as well
[59:19] I mean what's the point of this life if
[59:21] we come to the end of it
[59:23] amen or if we're still alive in the
[59:25] rapture guys and we're stuck here what's
[59:27] the point what's the point of this life
[59:29] it's all in vain amen this whole life is
[59:31] a preparation to go to the next world
[59:33] and it doesn't matter if you're an
[59:35] atheist or whatever it is there comes a
[59:37] point where every man will die and what
[59:40] then oh I don't believe I'll tell you
[59:43] what the first second on that other side
[59:45] everyone becomes a believer that first
[59:48] second everyone becomes a believer like
[59:50] the rich man that Jesus tells the
[59:52] parable of the rich man and Lazarus and
[59:53] the rich man I mean he went to health
[59:56] and he and the poor man died and went up
[59:58] to Abraham's bosom there's a gulf
[1:00:00] between them and the rich man is being
[1:00:02] tormented in the flame and he any calls
[1:00:05] Abraham send Lazarus with a bit of water
[1:00:07] on the end of his tongue I mean end of
[1:00:09] his finger
[1:00:10] and he can put it on my tango be you
[1:00:12] know a little bit satisfied and he says
[1:00:15] no is a gulf between you and I he can't
[1:00:18] come to me I can't cut he can yo you
[1:00:20] can't come here he can't go there
[1:00:22] amen and then he says he says can I go
[1:00:25] back and tell tell my brothers see now
[1:00:28] he wants to become a preacher now he
[1:00:30] wants to evangelize no now he's got a
[1:00:33] burden for his family you know now
[1:00:35] because now he's a believer beforehand
[1:00:38] he wasn't a believer because his life
[1:00:39] proved he didn't really care he had all
[1:00:41] the riches you know I mean finally he
[1:00:42] has all these riches he's he's now
[1:00:44] risked my soul he's trying to find a way
[1:00:46] to find rest for a soul and riches won't
[1:00:48] give it to you religion won't give it to
[1:00:50] you Jesus Christ is the only one that
[1:00:52] can give it to you amen so now here he
[1:00:54] is and he wants to go and convince
[1:00:57] preach to us brothers they said no even
[1:01:01] if you rose from the dead they won't
[1:01:02] believe they have the word and the word
[1:01:05] is enough amen so we don't want to do
[1:01:09] friends we don't want to end up like him
[1:01:12] just take it from ground you know we
[1:01:14] sung that song it so grips me do not
[1:01:17] pass me by he walks through a place just
[1:01:20] like Jericho is telling my girls about
[1:01:23] about Zacchaeus and the tree that was a
[1:01:26] kiyose is only opportunity to see Jesus
[1:01:28] because in a few days from there he was
[1:01:30] going from Jericho to Jerusalem to
[1:01:33] Calvary that's where he is going and it
[1:01:36] was blind bartimaeus by the gate as well
[1:01:38] and that was the last time Jesus in his
[1:01:41] physical form in that way was going to
[1:01:42] walk through Jericho that's the only
[1:01:44] chance he had but at least he went and
[1:01:46] looked we need to see him not to
[1:01:48] criticize I'm gonna see this one I want
[1:01:51] to behold this one hallelujah and I and
[1:01:54] I told them you know because Zacchaeus
[1:01:55] went up in the tree to yo to see Jesus
[1:01:58] and Jesus is walking along and Zacchaeus
[1:02:01] is hidden in the branches of the
[1:02:02] sycamore tree and he knows Jesus knows
[1:02:05] he's there and he knows his name
[1:02:06] he stops that he'd never met Zacchaeus
[1:02:09] before and he looks up sees Zacchaeus
[1:02:11] come down I want to have supper with you
[1:02:12] and then God moves on his heart and he
[1:02:14] says Lord if I I'm going to give half my
[1:02:16] goods to the poor and if I've rubbed
[1:02:18] anyone cheated anyone I'm going to give
[1:02:20] them
[1:02:20] you know I'm gonna repay them was it
[1:02:22] fourfold and Jesus is now salvation has
[1:02:24] come to this house and I'll told them if
[1:02:27] Zacchaeus did not climb that tree
[1:02:29] salvation would not have come to his
[1:02:31] house that day and that was his last
[1:02:33] that was his only opportunity as the son
[1:02:37] of man was finishing his earthly
[1:02:38] ministry and here we are today these son
[1:02:41] of man Jesus Christ is walking among us
[1:02:43] he's walking upon this earth he's
[1:02:46] fulfilling his word amen and we don't
[1:02:48] just want to watch it pass us by and
[1:02:50] have some indifferent opinion about it I
[1:02:53] mean but we I trusted something in you
[1:02:55] says Lord I want to touch the hem of
[1:02:56] your garment and me because this is my
[1:02:58] opportunity I have a need that that the
[1:03:01] world can can't solve I have this blood
[1:03:04] us you have this problem of this for
[1:03:06] setting sin that I can't overcome and
[1:03:08] you know I've come from a broken home I
[1:03:10] may be in an orphan or something and I
[1:03:13] don't know who I really am just touches
[1:03:15] him touch the hem of his garment and in
[1:03:17] by faith and you'll find yourself
[1:03:19] turning a different person there's only
[1:03:22] he can't and it's simple faith don't try
[1:03:24] to work something up just take him at
[1:03:26] his word then Lord you would promise
[1:03:28] this I mean I receive your word
[1:03:30] hallelujah don't let the devil lie to
[1:03:34] you say well you could just live this
[1:03:36] kind of way he's a liar that's an
[1:03:41] enticing spirit and we'll go on to that
[1:03:43] soon now he sees here Peter Peter said
[1:03:47] this is from the token message in
[1:03:49] Bakersfield I believe it is
[1:03:51] he says you mean of Israel Jesus Nezzer
[1:03:53] some man made known by God by signs and
[1:03:56] wonders you took with wicked hands and
[1:03:58] crucified Him who we're witnesses of his
[1:04:01] resurrection when the Holy Ghost had
[1:04:02] been poured out upon them now we find
[1:04:04] out that this and this great thing that
[1:04:07] God was identifying himself with Israel
[1:04:09] back there requiring that identification
[1:04:11] this is the blood on the door and lintel
[1:04:13] he says many Jews want to say he was a
[1:04:17] Jew speaking of Jesus many of us want to
[1:04:19] say he was a Jew he was neither Jew nor
[1:04:21] Gentile he was God and he was a created
[1:04:24] being by the hand of Almighty God he
[1:04:27] created a tabernacle he lived in which
[1:04:29] we know is the Son of God that's right
[1:04:31] the deity the supreme deity of Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ because God dwelt in him now we
[1:04:38] find out here the Jews could say well
[1:04:40] wait wait just a minute I'm a Jew I'm in
[1:04:43] the Covenant of Abraham I'm circumcised
[1:04:46] the Covenant it was annulled if the
[1:04:49] token wasn't displayed it didn't even
[1:04:53] wasn't even considered if that blood
[1:04:56] wasn't on the door and lintel the
[1:04:58] circumcision did no good absolutely no
[1:05:02] good I mean I'm talking of a token of
[1:05:06] this day if that blood wasn't displayed
[1:05:09] that token I don't care how much you
[1:05:11] could show you was a Jew it's the same
[1:05:13] thing with how much you could say you
[1:05:16] believed you might have been a rabbi
[1:05:18] priest or anything but that token had to
[1:05:20] be applied no ins or outs yes or no
[1:05:23] until he saw the blood he would pass
[1:05:27] over doesn't matter who they weren't God
[1:05:30] is without respect of persons God is
[1:05:33] without respect of persons if you come
[1:05:36] according to his word you will receive
[1:05:38] mercy if you do not you will not receive
[1:05:40] mercy doesn't matter how religious we
[1:05:43] are it doesn't matter how much we know
[1:05:44] the Bible doesn't matter how much we can
[1:05:46] quote even the messenger how devout we
[1:05:49] may be amen unless you come God's
[1:05:51] provided way unless he reveals his word
[1:05:54] to you are you following me
[1:05:57] amen you're in trouble and if you come a
[1:06:01] court try and come according to this and
[1:06:03] try and work out everything amen that's
[1:06:06] not how you come you come by revelation
[1:06:10] they had to they had to receive Moses
[1:06:14] ministry they had to receive it doesn't
[1:06:17] matter how much of a devout Jew they
[1:06:19] were even down in Egypt they had to
[1:06:21] receive it and they had to live out what
[1:06:24] he commanded them to do amen and then it
[1:06:27] came to a point where where Moses he
[1:06:31] sent 12 spies into the land and 10 of
[1:06:34] those spy said we can't take it and two
[1:06:36] said they could you know you know what
[1:06:38] was anointing those 10 spies they were
[1:06:41] enticing spirits they were spirits demon
[1:06:44] power
[1:06:45] to them to to give them unbelief against
[1:06:49] the Word of God and they believed an
[1:06:51] enticing spirit greater than what God
[1:06:54] said the promise for them was and I'll
[1:06:56] just say do you know why people could
[1:06:58] not reach up and receive the promise you
[1:07:00] know why people maybe just get wounded
[1:07:02] by the word they don't die on the altar
[1:07:04] it's because they listen to an enticing
[1:07:06] spirit I mean above the Word of God
[1:07:08] friends after the devil can anoint your
[1:07:11] emotion he can anoint your memory he can
[1:07:14] anoint your reasoning and it can all say
[1:07:16] I'm very good I'm in but if it's against
[1:07:18] the Word of God you got to forsake it
[1:07:20] but the other yo you're the Bible says
[1:07:23] casting down reasoning what do you mean
[1:07:26] by this is casting down I'll cast it
[1:07:27] down I'll have no part of it you got to
[1:07:34] cast down reasoning I mean but what will
[1:07:36] my friends think what will society think
[1:07:38] whoa what will my peers at work thing
[1:07:41] well my buddies that I do whatever we
[1:07:43] think what will God think who is your
[1:07:47] God because if you yield to someone
[1:07:50] else's influence above God's influence
[1:07:52] they your God and not Jesus Christ the
[1:07:55] word and enticing spirits came upon them
[1:07:59] and see if we can't take the land and
[1:08:00] this was the reason they came out of
[1:08:01] Egypt to take the land but to were not
[1:08:04] anointed by those lying Devils they said
[1:08:07] God's giving it to us let's go and they
[1:08:10] received the promise now they came a
[1:08:13] time
[1:08:14] this isn't seeking Chronicles 18 we
[1:08:16] won't read it but here's a head and this
[1:08:20] story here King Ahab is joined with the
[1:08:23] king of Israel and they're going to go
[1:08:25] take ramoth-gilead which used to belong
[1:08:28] to Israel but the Syrians had had taken
[1:08:30] it over
[1:08:31] and so Ahab goes to the other King
[1:08:34] Jehoshaphat or some what I may have that
[1:08:36] wrong but just go read the story and he
[1:08:39] says Remus Gilead as how's this go take
[1:08:41] it and they join themselves together and
[1:08:42] a half now Jehoshaphat is more of a
[1:08:45] godly King they see his let's pray
[1:08:47] inquire of the Lord to see if this is
[1:08:49] the Lord's will and I have says I've got
[1:08:51] four hundred prophets Hebrew prophets I
[1:08:53] got four hundred believers four hundred
[1:08:56] preachers here's my ministers
[1:08:58] right here and we'll let them have a
[1:09:00] prayer meeting and we'll see because
[1:09:02] they they hear from God and so if they
[1:09:04] pray an affair one mind to one Accord
[1:09:06] that yes this is the will of God then
[1:09:08] we'll go take ramoth-gilead and so these
[1:09:10] 400 Hebrew prophets they begin to pray
[1:09:13] they begin to sing and they begin to
[1:09:15] have a church service and a spirit comes
[1:09:18] among them and they begin to rejoice and
[1:09:20] the head the head of this whole four
[1:09:22] hundred he made two horns of iron he got
[1:09:24] it and he got inspired he got excited
[1:09:27] and he said buy these hogs I mean you'll
[1:09:30] push the Syrians out of the country and
[1:09:32] you'll take the land now it sounded
[1:09:34] awful good it sounded awful good and
[1:09:36] would have been it would have sounded
[1:09:38] really quite convincing because the
[1:09:41] Bible said RAM of Gilead belonged to
[1:09:43] Israel Ramnath Gilead belong to Israel
[1:09:45] but something had happened in the
[1:09:48] between time where there was there was a
[1:09:50] prophet called Elijah and he prophesied
[1:09:53] that the dogs will eat Jezebel a Habs
[1:09:58] wife and now look the dogs will lick a
[1:10:00] Habs blood this was the prophecy this
[1:10:03] was the word for their hour this was the
[1:10:05] prophecy that had to be fulfilled in
[1:10:07] their day an hour and there was another
[1:10:09] prophet called macaé and he wasn't part
[1:10:11] of these four hundred because you have
[1:10:13] Jehoshaphat see don't you have another
[1:10:15] one doesn't there one more and and I
[1:10:18] have sinking it's four hundred four
[1:10:20] hundred prophets right here why do you
[1:10:21] need one more isn't he just one more
[1:10:23] yeah there's this McCoy but I hate him
[1:10:25] but anyway you know go call from then a
[1:10:27] man goes and calls for this this this
[1:10:29] McCoy and he tells him as they're
[1:10:31] walking now you know what the head of
[1:10:33] the organization did he made some horns
[1:10:35] we had a pre-meeting
[1:10:37] God came down it was an incredible time
[1:10:39] and this is what the Lord spoke through
[1:10:41] us that we're gonna take ramoth-gilead
[1:10:43] and buy these horns we're gonna push the
[1:10:45] Syrians out of the country and now you
[1:10:47] haven't been in fellowship for a long
[1:10:48] time if you want to come back in because
[1:10:50] we still love you because God loved and
[1:10:52] you know we love everyone and now you
[1:10:53] just come and let's have fellowship
[1:10:54] again and then but but they Makai said
[1:10:57] I'll pray and I'm gonna see what God
[1:11:01] sees he didn't let the influence of
[1:11:03] these 400 influence what he would say
[1:11:05] and then so here was a man and he went
[1:11:09] and prayed
[1:11:11] and he knew this from returning Jubilees
[1:11:15] he certainly they hated him he was a
[1:11:16] real prophet he said he's Emily the son
[1:11:19] of of Micah the organization put him out
[1:11:22] long time ago don't have any fellowship
[1:11:24] with him he said let's hear him I always
[1:11:26] said I hate him a herb said he hated
[1:11:28] this man let the King not say so but
[1:11:30] let's hear what he's got to say then
[1:11:32] some of the priests Peter's run over
[1:11:34] told him said all the bishops and
[1:11:36] everybody said this and that you must
[1:11:39] say the same thing he said I'll just say
[1:11:41] what God puts in my mouth I think that's
[1:11:44] a good attitude dude I'll just say what
[1:11:46] God puts in my mouth amen how we ought
[1:11:48] to have brother zip here now to sing a
[1:11:51] main chorus for us yes sir say what God
[1:11:54] puts in your mouth he'll never say
[1:11:55] nothing but his word but his word we
[1:11:58] must have an absolute in this day we
[1:12:01] must have an absolute and we've got to
[1:12:03] have something we're going to have a
[1:12:05] true interpretation of the scripture and
[1:12:07] this multitude of denominations and
[1:12:09] schools of thought and they all argue
[1:12:11] upon one another it's got to go beyond
[1:12:14] intellectual understanding and
[1:12:15] collecting what scholars say and just
[1:12:17] try and find a consensus that's not how
[1:12:19] you find the true interpretation yo God
[1:12:22] says I'll do nothing till I tell to
[1:12:24] reveal to my servants the prophets first
[1:12:25] there's a scriptural foundation and the
[1:12:28] Old Testament and the new amen the
[1:12:31] Apostle Paul he may be an apostle but he
[1:12:34] is also a prophet
[1:12:35] many of the Apostles they prophesied
[1:12:37] things
[1:12:38] the Apostle Paul most of his writings a
[1:12:39] prophecy he says I'll do nothing till I
[1:12:42] reveal to my servants the prophets first
[1:12:44] it means that's all their New Testament
[1:12:47] and it's got to be the same thing today
[1:12:49] well how do we know what truth is that's
[1:12:51] what God seemed to Elijah and thus our
[1:12:54] to show us what the Bible actually says
[1:12:57] amen it's not it's not just a
[1:12:59] supernatural ministry in some opinion I
[1:13:01] know I've probably gone to the end of
[1:13:02] most end of my sermon but I'll maybe
[1:13:04] come back to there again but it's got to
[1:13:06] be it's not our human opinion and then
[1:13:09] we take someone else's what we think is
[1:13:11] opinion and say let's try and marry it
[1:13:13] up and win it and when ours differs from
[1:13:16] hers well let's just leave that a little
[1:13:18] bit no you got to understand that's God
[1:13:20] speaking through that vessel
[1:13:22] and and it's a voice that came from this
[1:13:24] word it points us back into the
[1:13:26] scripture a meant later but anyway he
[1:13:31] says now a prophet a prophet is a teller
[1:13:35] forth the same as 1/4 dollar true he
[1:13:37] said I'll say what God says then he
[1:13:39] checked his vision then he checked his
[1:13:42] vision let me have tonight and see what
[1:13:45] the Lord says the next morning he came
[1:13:46] out and had thus saith the Lord why he
[1:13:49] checked it he knowed that that real
[1:13:51] prophet before him which was Elijah who
[1:13:54] the word of the Lord came to had to be
[1:13:57] right I mean he cursed they have told
[1:14:01] him the dogs would look his blood and
[1:14:02] Jezebel would be strode over the fields
[1:14:04] and so forth he knowed nothing good
[1:14:07] could come out of that thing with a
[1:14:09] hypocrite
[1:14:10] and I tell you friends that same spirit
[1:14:13] there that was on Ahab and Jezebel is
[1:14:16] here present I mean John saw it in the
[1:14:18] book of Revelation that woman Jezebel
[1:14:20] who suffers to teach a man which is the
[1:14:23] Catholic Church and all her daughters I
[1:14:24] know it's strong but it's in the
[1:14:25] scripture amen and that's a spiritus
[1:14:28] here upon the earth and you know there's
[1:14:29] only two just well I mean do you know
[1:14:31] there's only two spirits there's only
[1:14:34] two spirits upon the earth working
[1:14:36] doesn't matter how they appear there's
[1:14:38] God in his word and in the devil in a
[1:14:41] myriad of different ways there's only
[1:14:44] the two so where is your inspiration the
[1:14:47] music you listen to the sermons you
[1:14:50] listen to I mean the things that
[1:14:53] influence your life in a spiritual way
[1:14:54] where is that influence coming from
[1:14:57] where is it coming from
[1:14:59] it's either coming from - and doesn't
[1:15:01] matter how good one may be to you is it
[1:15:04] God or not you got to think about that
[1:15:12] he says I'll tell you that God will
[1:15:14] never bless the church as long as she
[1:15:16] organized herself and sets herself to
[1:15:18] one side which God has proved down
[1:15:20] through the ages as he's cursed
[1:15:22] show me one group of people where God
[1:15:24] raised up a revival down through the
[1:15:25] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther
[1:15:27] cama light whatever it may be when he
[1:15:29] raised up a group of people and started
[1:15:31] a revival when they organized they died
[1:15:33] and they never came back how can God
[1:15:35] bless
[1:15:36] what he's cursed I return Louisiana this
[1:15:38] is returning Jubilee I return Louisiana
[1:15:41] the year of Jubilee is on and it's the
[1:15:44] same thing here don't just put God in a
[1:15:46] box and say now I've got them all sorted
[1:15:48] out
[1:15:49] you don't put God in a box that means
[1:15:51] you've organized a meeting when you
[1:15:54] organize you die you can't put God in a
[1:15:56] box now work them out he goes beyond the
[1:15:58] box
[1:15:58] he will not be bound the Spirit of God
[1:16:01] will not be bound by your understanding
[1:16:03] by an organizational understanding he
[1:16:06] will not be bound neither will the Bride
[1:16:08] of Christ be bound hallelujah so don't
[1:16:11] put him in a box and say now I've worked
[1:16:12] them out amen he goes beyond it this is
[1:16:16] what the devil wants you to know just to
[1:16:17] put a full stop now I understand it all
[1:16:20] this is just how does put a full-stop
[1:16:21] that's all he wants you to do and he's
[1:16:23] got you if you do that I mean with God
[1:16:26] as always unfolding himself in his word
[1:16:28] to you hallelujah
[1:16:30] I'm so glad that's the case I mean we
[1:16:32] have just plateaued and then bouncing
[1:16:34] around and some some ideas God's
[1:16:36] revealing himself more and more in the
[1:16:38] scripture I trusted he's revealed
[1:16:40] himself more to you than he did when he
[1:16:42] first met you hallelujah should be that
[1:16:45] way if it hasn't if he's not there's
[1:16:47] something wrong amen now certainly
[1:16:53] notice then he went up on the hill the
[1:16:57] year of Jubilee son returned to your own
[1:16:58] returned your inheritance notice
[1:17:00] certainly noticed and then he went up
[1:17:02] there on the hill and lost his life
[1:17:03] that's a habit died in that battle just
[1:17:06] exactly because notice that Micaiah saw
[1:17:08] his prophecy and know that his prophecy
[1:17:11] compared exactly with the word of the
[1:17:13] Lord certainly what was to be done to us
[1:17:15] done the same thing we took the
[1:17:17] multitude of counsel for safety there
[1:17:19] goes in another place of scripture so
[1:17:23] they had to there was the challenge now
[1:17:24] if they received Elijah's ministry amen
[1:17:29] they would not have had this catastrophe
[1:17:32] but Elijah's prophecy had to be
[1:17:35] fulfilled
[1:17:36] that's why Makaha could stand there and
[1:17:39] say no you will not be successful he
[1:17:41] says I see Israel scattered like sheep
[1:17:43] with no Shepherd and then that and then
[1:17:46] that he'd
[1:17:49] Minister with who who made the horns he
[1:17:51] slept them in the mouth and he said now
[1:17:54] when did the Spirit of God leave me and
[1:17:56] coming to you he's basically I don't
[1:17:58] believe it and then makai said I saw I
[1:18:01] saw a scene in heaven and God is upon
[1:18:04] his throne and he's having a meeting
[1:18:06] he's saying now what can we do to make a
[1:18:10] have come to this battle and to fulfill
[1:18:12] Elijah's prophecy and that a lying
[1:18:14] spirit came out of hell and said I'll
[1:18:18] make him come all the night those
[1:18:19] ministers they don't know the word Vegas
[1:18:22] no excitement and and and being excited
[1:18:24] that and I think that's a vindication
[1:18:26] that the word is manifesting and and so
[1:18:28] God said now go and it was a lying
[1:18:30] spirit anointing those four hundred and
[1:18:32] they were enthused and they are excited
[1:18:35] and now having a wonderful time I
[1:18:36] thought but it was actually demon as a
[1:18:39] demon worship going on think about it if
[1:18:43] they only went back to Elijah's prophecy
[1:18:45] and said he prophesied a hams gonna be
[1:18:49] killed
[1:18:49] Jesus Belle's gonna be killed this is
[1:18:52] gonna happen they they just said O king
[1:18:55] live forever don't go you will not be
[1:18:58] successful because Elijah said this is
[1:19:00] what's going to happen but they took
[1:19:02] what God did in the past above what God
[1:19:05] was doing in their day now he says now
[1:19:13] no to differentiate what is right and
[1:19:16] wrong
[1:19:16] there's enticing spirits in 55 macaé
[1:19:19] knew good and well that it wasn't the
[1:19:21] Lord that was with them preachers but
[1:19:23] what was the matter with those preachers
[1:19:24] notice what they did they had a dress
[1:19:27] the best they had been fed the best they
[1:19:30] had come together and their parties and
[1:19:32] so forth and their alliances until the
[1:19:34] place had gotten so where they only knew
[1:19:37] their own theology and the Bible says
[1:19:39] the Makai when he looked at the vision
[1:19:40] he said God said who can we get to go
[1:19:43] down there and deceive a have this all
[1:19:45] in second second chronicles 18 or it's
[1:19:47] in first Kings as well and a lying
[1:19:49] spirit said I'll go down there and I say
[1:19:51] help through those preachers because
[1:19:52] they had to go out there in order to
[1:19:54] bring the Word of God to pass now today
[1:19:56] so many people are listening he says now
[1:19:58] Sunday school now Sunday school I love
[1:20:01] it look so many P
[1:20:02] listening to enticing spirits and
[1:20:04] instead of taking the Word of God and we
[1:20:08] are not immune to such things
[1:20:10] amen what do you want to take who do you
[1:20:13] want to take who do you want to take you
[1:20:16] by the hand
[1:20:17] choosie this day I want Jesus Christ the
[1:20:21] word the Living Word to take me by the
[1:20:23] hand I do not want an enticing spirit to
[1:20:26] take me by the hand because that will
[1:20:27] lead me to destruction but he will lead
[1:20:29] me to glory hallelujah now it's very
[1:20:37] easy it's very easy to look in the look
[1:20:42] in history and say yeah they should have
[1:20:45] received the prophets that came to them
[1:20:46] why didn't they receive them if I was
[1:20:48] staying there in that day I would have
[1:20:50] received it glory to God I would have
[1:20:51] been with the Apostles that I would yeah
[1:20:53] but it's very easy to point back into
[1:20:55] history to see the same see those heroes
[1:20:57] what about today what about today
[1:21:01] Jesus's main opposition was from
[1:21:03] religious people it was not fraud it was
[1:21:06] from the church world who crucified Him
[1:21:08] we say the Romans crucified Him but who
[1:21:10] orchestrated the whole thing
[1:21:11] the church will pilot didn't want to
[1:21:13] crucify him Pilate he said I find no
[1:21:16] fault in this man I find no fault in
[1:21:19] this man
[1:21:19] it was the church world that found fault
[1:21:21] because they were trying to catch him
[1:21:22] you read the Gospels they try and catch
[1:21:24] him they were trying to catch him in his
[1:21:26] words that's why they asked him hard
[1:21:29] questions they thought in different
[1:21:30] things they're trying to catch him in
[1:21:32] his words and it's the same thing today
[1:21:34] if you come here to try and catch me in
[1:21:36] my words amen you'll probably find
[1:21:38] something because I'm just a man I mean
[1:21:40] just like they try and take the message
[1:21:41] and dissect it and try and find fault
[1:21:43] with them when it's God revealing
[1:21:45] himself amen
[1:21:47] but they try and find fault and I said
[1:21:49] but then they said we are Moses
[1:21:51] disciples we know what Moses did it was
[1:21:54] easy to believe what Moses did because
[1:21:56] if Moses was thousands of years or a
[1:21:58] thousand years whatever before this and
[1:21:59] it was historical it was it was received
[1:22:03] or considered in their culture as a fact
[1:22:05] their culture said it was a fact if you
[1:22:09] went from Israel and then you went to
[1:22:10] China and he said you know Moses came
[1:22:12] and took us out of Egypt that's a we
[1:22:15] know
[1:22:16] about this because it wasn't considered
[1:22:18] a cultural fact in China and that day
[1:22:21] but it was in Israel so because of
[1:22:23] tradition and history they could receive
[1:22:26] it as a fact but when the truth when the
[1:22:30] one that Moses spoke of became
[1:22:32] manifested in their day an hour they
[1:22:34] rejected him and Jesus says here do not
[1:22:39] think that I will accuse you to the
[1:22:41] Father
[1:22:42] there is one that accused with you even
[1:22:44] Moses and whom you trust for had ye
[1:22:48] believed Moses had you believed Moses
[1:22:52] you would have believed me for he wrote
[1:22:55] of me now hold on here was people that
[1:22:59] had given their life you just think
[1:23:01] about standing there in the crowd and
[1:23:02] you're one of the Pharisees and here's a
[1:23:04] little man
[1:23:05] who doesn't look like anything great but
[1:23:08] yet he has a presence around him like no
[1:23:10] other and he and he speaks things that
[1:23:11] no other man has spoken before and hears
[1:23:13] us the Pharisees and we say we have
[1:23:18] Moses we are Moses disciples oh how we
[1:23:21] love the words of Moses and we love the
[1:23:24] prophets and how great thee how great
[1:23:26] the word that God has given us is and
[1:23:28] how we love the feasts and all they gave
[1:23:31] their lives
[1:23:31] these people were devout they would
[1:23:34] devout people they couldn't just be well
[1:23:37] it would have been a Saturday June you
[1:23:40] know we talked about just being a Sunday
[1:23:41] Christian you know they just want to
[1:23:42] assemble Jew there were every day a Jew
[1:23:45] this is our identity this is who we
[1:23:47] really are but then Jesus but then
[1:23:50] here's this man called Jesus Nazareth
[1:23:52] and he's saying if you really have
[1:23:54] believed Moses you would have believed
[1:23:55] me and that's the only saying of course
[1:23:58] we believe Moses we've given our lives
[1:24:00] to follow Moses teachings we study Moses
[1:24:03] teachings we read about it we we debate
[1:24:06] it we yeah we have Bible teachers that
[1:24:08] have given all their energy and all of
[1:24:10] their life I mean to study Moses
[1:24:12] teachings and this man says we don't
[1:24:14] even believe him but they didn't they
[1:24:18] didn't actually believe him what Bible
[1:24:21] character are you are you becoming I
[1:24:23] trust it's not one of the scribes and
[1:24:25] Pharisees but he says now if you
[1:24:28] we believed Moses you would have
[1:24:29] believed me because he wrote about me
[1:24:32] but if you believe not his writings how
[1:24:35] shall you believe my words amen
[1:24:39] how could they believed the words of the
[1:24:42] Son of Man in that day if they didn't
[1:24:44] believe the Bible they only received the
[1:24:47] Bible out of tradition it wasn't a
[1:24:49] revelation to them now I trust that and
[1:24:52] it's the same thing today we can take
[1:24:55] this and also who believes this is the
[1:24:57] word of God and but also Amen I trust
[1:25:01] you would absolutely I believe this I'm
[1:25:05] a Bible believing Christian but then how
[1:25:07] about when God sends a voice in this day
[1:25:09] how about when God sends a voice in this
[1:25:12] day and he said but if you believe not
[1:25:15] has he said no you don't actually
[1:25:17] believe the writings of Moses because
[1:25:20] you don't believe me
[1:25:21] the proof of the pudding is if you
[1:25:23] really believe the Bible if you believe
[1:25:25] in Him who he has sent and the words of
[1:25:27] whom he has sent
[1:25:29] amen this remember history repeats
[1:25:32] itself this is not just clutching your
[1:25:35] straws this has happened all the way
[1:25:36] down through the ages people don't
[1:25:39] change they meant the devil hasn't
[1:25:42] changed either and God hasn't changed
[1:25:44] God takes his man or the devil takes his
[1:25:47] man off the scene but a spirit is still
[1:25:49] here and the same spirit that was
[1:25:50] anointing them back there as anointing
[1:25:52] people in this day and hour and don't
[1:25:54] put it whatever you do beyond the four
[1:25:56] walls and don't start pitch for King and
[1:25:58] other I hope this person receives that
[1:26:00] hope this person you got to lay the
[1:26:02] pitchfork aside you got to say Lord Here
[1:26:05] I am at your table it may taste bitter
[1:26:08] it may taste sweet it may taste
[1:26:10] everything in between but I know you're
[1:26:12] serving me the right kind of food
[1:26:13] because you have my best interest in
[1:26:15] mind
[1:26:16] amen so I trust see this is what they
[1:26:19] said about Jesus now John I know time is
[1:26:26] running away but the people in Jesus's
[1:26:29] day I'm sure you'd all agree they had to
[1:26:30] receive the Ministry of John the Baptist
[1:26:32] because the minister John the Baptist
[1:26:34] was to be a voice of one crying in the
[1:26:36] wilderness to prepared the way of the
[1:26:37] Lord today so the people had to receive
[1:26:40] of course they had to and then they had
[1:26:42] to receive the Ministry of Jesus of
[1:26:44] course they had to receive the Ministry
[1:26:46] of Jesus how could you not receive the
[1:26:48] Ministry of the Messiah but then I want
[1:26:52] to just read this because I want you to
[1:26:55] understand many times we sit here and we
[1:26:59] say we have to work out what's going on
[1:27:01] and if I can mentally understand how
[1:27:05] everything fits together then I'll
[1:27:06] believe it but revelation goes beyond
[1:27:09] this revelation is not any a mental
[1:27:12] understanding that's when God speaks
[1:27:14] down here and God reveals it down here
[1:27:16] now here's here's the disciples Jesus is
[1:27:20] just spoken about unless you drink my
[1:27:23] blood and eat my flesh you have no life
[1:27:25] in you now if you go back into the woods
[1:27:27] of Moses he said you shall not eat the
[1:27:30] flesh with the blood in it he says it
[1:27:32] more than once so if you just
[1:27:34] fundamental in your mind you'd say this
[1:27:36] man cannot be the Messiah because he's
[1:27:39] just contradicted the words of Moses but
[1:27:41] they didn't have and the thing is he
[1:27:43] didn't explain it you go read John 6 he
[1:27:46] never explained unless you eat my flesh
[1:27:48] and drink my blood you have no life in
[1:27:49] you he just says it he's going to see
[1:27:52] now what's holding the people what's
[1:27:55] really holding them why have they
[1:27:56] gathered and then he says so he started
[1:28:00] with 5,000 people in one church service
[1:28:04] everyone leaves them apart from the
[1:28:06] disciples there was the people there are
[1:28:08] 70 ministers that did supernatural
[1:28:10] supernatural things he sent them forth
[1:28:12] two by two to God heal the sick and do
[1:28:15] different things they left them and then
[1:28:19] he says this here and he said therefore
[1:28:21] I say unto you that no man can come unto
[1:28:24] me except to be given unto him by my
[1:28:26] father from that time many of his
[1:28:29] disciples went back and walked with him
[1:28:32] no more then said Jesus unto the twelve
[1:28:35] will you also go away then Simon Peter
[1:28:38] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[1:28:40] thou has the words of eternal life and
[1:28:43] we believe in assure that thou art that
[1:28:45] Christ the Son of the Living God now no
[1:28:49] doubt you could have you could have
[1:28:52] asked Peter and the disciples
[1:28:54] did you understand what he just said
[1:28:56] about eating flesh and drinking blood
[1:28:58] his own flesh and they would have said
[1:29:00] no we don't understand this but we know
[1:29:03] that this is the Messiah we can't work
[1:29:06] it out up in here I know you're very
[1:29:09] quiet by thinking about what I'm saying
[1:29:10] I trust you are don't worry about
[1:29:12] tomorrow tomorrow take care of itself
[1:29:14] now worry about next week it will take
[1:29:17] care of itself
[1:29:17] there are about Christmas it'll happen
[1:29:20] we'll go we'll move on we'll have New
[1:29:21] Year's Lord willing whatever it'll take
[1:29:24] care of itself but they could they
[1:29:27] didn't understand what he was but they
[1:29:30] deal with something in them this is why
[1:29:31] revelation goes beyond mental
[1:29:33] understanding the devil always place to
[1:29:35] here but you got to rely on on God
[1:29:38] revealing his word to you because they
[1:29:40] didn't understand what he was saying but
[1:29:42] and they see it this is God in flesh
[1:29:44] this is God in flesh and because they
[1:29:47] knew was God in flesh they they stayed
[1:29:49] with him they walked with him they join
[1:29:52] themselves to him because this was the
[1:29:54] Messiah manifested upon the earth
[1:29:57] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:29:59] the woman at the well she didn't
[1:30:01] understand yeah he's a man who looks
[1:30:03] like a Jew sitting by the well that she
[1:30:05] always came to at that hour of the day
[1:30:08] and he just says bring me a drink and
[1:30:10] she says well how how can oh you've got
[1:30:13] nothing to draw with and then he just
[1:30:15] changes the conversation a little bit
[1:30:17] he said if you knew the water I had you
[1:30:20] drink it never thirst again and then
[1:30:23] they begin to talk about different
[1:30:24] things and then finally it hangs down to
[1:30:26] we know when Messiah cometh because he
[1:30:30] just sits there and the Prophet says he
[1:30:32] is just contacting your spirit and and
[1:30:34] Jesus says go get your husband and then
[1:30:37] the woman says I have known and Jesus
[1:30:39] says that's right the way you've had
[1:30:41] five and the one you're worth is not
[1:30:43] yours hallelujah and then something
[1:30:46] energy said we know when Messiah cometh
[1:30:49] he will do these things
[1:30:51] she didn't say now tell me all your
[1:30:54] doctrine and then I'll reconcile it with
[1:30:56] what I believe
[1:30:57] amen what church what church do you
[1:31:00] preach at where's your website what are
[1:31:02] the things you believe that she just
[1:31:04] said we know when Messiah cometh
[1:31:07] he'll do these things and he just said
[1:31:09] he that speaks of them he hallelujah and
[1:31:12] she dropped her water pot she dropped
[1:31:14] her old life hallelujah okay for
[1:31:16] overcoming power Amy by her receiving
[1:31:19] the word
[1:31:20] I didn't redeem her hallelujah that she
[1:31:23] wasn't she didn't go back to her man
[1:31:24] trouble anymore she was looking for love
[1:31:26] in the wrong places and she could not
[1:31:28] overcome that in her life
[1:31:30] I mean but then when Jesus came and he
[1:31:33] wente just came her way she said this is
[1:31:35] the Messiah hallelujah and she left that
[1:31:38] old life and that's why it's such a
[1:31:40] powerful thing if you can hear the voice
[1:31:42] behind the voice of the messenger and if
[1:31:45] you can hear that voice behind your
[1:31:46] voice we know when Messiah cometh he'll
[1:31:48] do these signals and that word that
[1:31:50] message is Messiah speaking hallelujah
[1:31:53] if you can recognize that your life will
[1:31:55] be different I guarantee you that month
[1:31:57] you're at the workout how it all works
[1:31:59] out he'll lead you and guide you into
[1:32:00] all truth amen he will lead you and
[1:32:03] guide you into all truth what does that
[1:32:05] mean he says now come here I'll show you
[1:32:06] this and we may not understand all
[1:32:33] things you got to know it's him you got
[1:32:36] to know it's him because when the devil
[1:32:38] comes in with his reason John Hastie
[1:32:55] writes when he's writing then writing
[1:32:57] the gospel he was put into the temple
[1:33:05] people's reasoning if you're looking for
[1:33:08] an out is plenty about but if you're
[1:33:11] looking for them these and then and what
[1:33:13] do you want you want eternal life
[1:33:20] see Noah's sons received the word that
[1:33:24] Moses had Noah preached to them sons
[1:33:27] it's gonna rain
[1:33:28] don't reveal to me we're going to build
[1:33:30] the Sun you see this farce we're gonna
[1:33:31] cut it down we do this favor see and his
[1:33:34] daddy did daddy's preacher hmm and they
[1:33:37] believed it
[1:33:37] and they got into the ark and they were
[1:33:39] reading Caleb and Joshua received the
[1:33:42] preaching of Moses they received it they
[1:33:45] didn't just receive the signs and
[1:33:46] wonders they received that word that was
[1:33:48] coming on that problems pal and they
[1:33:50] recognize this is God to us this has got
[1:33:53] to us and then they were redeemed they
[1:33:55] came out Oh see it's not just to come
[1:33:57] out of the world well stay in the
[1:33:59] wilderness you to go with every tension
[1:34:02] you're gonna come out and go in and so a
[1:34:06] mini came out under the supernatural
[1:34:08] onca supernatural ministry isn't this
[1:34:10] wonderful the Red Sea I could look at
[1:34:12] the plagues wasn't that incredible we've
[1:34:15] got to go beyond me
[1:34:16] that's a vindication that's a
[1:34:18] vindication that that the ministry is
[1:34:20] true are you gonna go beyond that it's
[1:34:22] the words that's the word that is spoken
[1:34:24] it's going to grip your soul it's got a
[1:34:26] grip you hallelujah
[1:34:28] and so Caleb and Joshua they received
[1:34:30] that ministry he said we're gonna
[1:34:33] receive an inheritance Barnea with all
[1:34:45] the rest of the spies and everyone else
[1:34:48] turned against us but I stood with you
[1:34:50] Joshua now give me my here's what he
[1:34:55] wanted
[1:34:56] I mean it's the same thing with us
[1:34:57] friends I trusted something in you what
[1:35:21] do you see I mean faith is even greater
[1:35:23] than your own down you got to cast down
[1:35:24] your doubts I mean this is a very
[1:35:26] different kind of a service maybe but
[1:35:28] God has seen to word upon the earth in
[1:35:30] the same time goddess in a word that
[1:35:32] came from his Bible hallelujah and he
[1:35:35] sent it to prepare a bride I mean to
[1:35:37] take her in a rapture hallelujah the
[1:35:41] woman the well couldn't understand all
[1:35:43] things
[1:35:43] what is this doctrine on on election
[1:35:47] what is this doctrine on the Godhead
[1:35:49] what does he believe about everything
[1:35:50] she said I don't know but it's the
[1:35:51] Messiah come and see a man that told me
[1:35:54] everything I ever did hallelujah
[1:35:57] now I mean the people now let's go to X
[1:36:03] 18 I don't sorry I don't have it on the
[1:36:09] overheat I thought I did it's got X 18
[1:36:18] actually sorry first you may think what
[1:36:25] is this got to do with walking in the
[1:36:26] light let's go quickly let's go to John
[1:36:30] 5 and verse 33
[1:36:32] I'll show you very quickly light in the
[1:36:35] bible is the word manifested that is
[1:36:38] what light is
[1:36:39] it's not a natural light all there's a
[1:36:42] glow no it's when the word has made
[1:36:44] manifested that is light so here in John
[1:36:47] 5 and 33 now so I don't have this in the
[1:36:54] John 5 and 33 mother our amanda's
[1:36:58] working Alleluia he says ye sent unto
[1:37:05] John and here bear witness of the truth
[1:37:07] now if we go Nick's next verse but I
[1:37:11] received not testimony from man but
[1:37:13] these things I say that ye might be
[1:37:15] saved as being of John the Baptist next
[1:37:18] one he was a burning and a shining light
[1:37:20] and you're willing for a season to
[1:37:23] rejoice in his lights and let's go to
[1:37:26] the next verse but I have greater
[1:37:28] witness than that of John for the works
[1:37:30] which the father had given to me to
[1:37:32] finish the same works that I do bear
[1:37:34] witness of me that the father hath sent
[1:37:38] me thank you thank you brother Amanda
[1:37:40] you see he says John was a bright he was
[1:37:44] a bright and shining light what was he
[1:37:47] he was the prophecy the voice of one
[1:37:50] crying in the wilderness he was that
[1:37:52] prophecy manifested upon the earth he
[1:37:54] says you're willing to receive him to
[1:37:55] walk in that life but when Jesus was
[1:37:57] standing there speaking to the disciples
[1:37:59] John had already probably been put into
[1:38:02] prison his head had been cut off I mean
[1:38:05] his ministry had finished but the people
[1:38:07] couldn't stay back in history they had
[1:38:09] to walk if you walk in the light as he
[1:38:11] is in the light they had to they had to
[1:38:13] follow John John introduced him to Jesus
[1:38:15] then they had to walk with Jesus I mean
[1:38:18] they couldn't stay with John they had to
[1:38:20] walk on because where John was that time
[1:38:22] was now darkness and it had been
[1:38:23] fulfilled it was still true but it
[1:38:26] wasn't the present truth anymore is now
[1:38:28] past he following me I mean so let's go
[1:38:31] to X 8
[1:38:32] take No
[1:38:42] now read from verse 24 now we're going
[1:38:46] we're jumping from when we get to X 18
[1:38:50] it's now AD 54 so it's been 20 20 years
[1:38:56] since Jesus had died you know this death
[1:38:58] be a resurrection as 20 years on now and
[1:39:01] here's a group of men that are preaching
[1:39:04] that Jesus was the Christ but they only
[1:39:08] knew the baptism of John so the light
[1:39:11] had moved on but they were there
[1:39:14] actually in the past you following me he
[1:39:17] sees and there was a certain Jew named
[1:39:19] Apollo's yes there we are
[1:39:21] Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in
[1:39:24] the scriptures came to Ephesus
[1:39:25] this man was instructed in the way of
[1:39:27] the Lord and being fervent in the spirit
[1:39:30] he spake and taught diligently the
[1:39:32] things of the Lord knowing only the
[1:39:33] baptism of John so he so he had he admit
[1:39:36] the forerunner he had mr. must you know
[1:39:39] here I'm against the priest that Jesus
[1:39:41] was the Christ but he had mr. de vino'
[1:39:43] cough and he began to speak boldly in
[1:39:46] the synagogue whom when Aquila and
[1:39:48] Priscilla had heard they took him unto
[1:39:51] them and expanded unto him the way of
[1:39:52] God more perfectly and when he was
[1:39:55] disposed to pass into acacia the
[1:39:57] Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples
[1:39:59] to receive him who when he was come
[1:40:02] helped them much which had believed
[1:40:04] through grace for he might flee
[1:40:06] convinced the Jews and that publicly
[1:40:09] showing by the scriptures that Jesus was
[1:40:11] Christ he was a believer he was a
[1:40:14] believer but let's go to the next
[1:40:17] chapter chapter 19 and 1 and it came to
[1:40:20] pass that while Apollo's was at Corinth
[1:40:22] Paul having passed through the upper
[1:40:24] coast came to Ephesus and finding
[1:40:26] certain disciples he said unto them he
[1:40:30] said unto them have you received the
[1:40:32] Holy Ghost since you believed and they
[1:40:34] said unto Him we have not so as much as
[1:40:36] heard whether there be any Holy Ghost
[1:40:38] and he said unto them unto what then
[1:40:40] were you baptized and they said unto
[1:40:42] John's baptism then said paul john
[1:40:45] verily baptized with the baptism of
[1:40:47] repentance saying unto the people that
[1:40:50] they should believe on him who should
[1:40:52] come after him that is on christ jesus
[1:40:54] and when they
[1:40:54] thus they were baptized in the name of
[1:40:56] the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid
[1:40:59] his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came
[1:41:01] on them and they spake with tongues and
[1:41:03] prophesied and all the men were about
[1:41:05] twelve so here were people we're
[1:41:08] actually living in the past the light
[1:41:10] had moved on so now here was Apollo's
[1:41:13] here was the challenge laid to Apollo's
[1:41:15] he could have reason like Cain but I've
[1:41:17] done this I've preached the gospel I've
[1:41:19] convinced the Jews from the Old
[1:41:21] Testament that Jesus was the Christ I've
[1:41:23] I've forsaken all and I'm following this
[1:41:26] Jesus but it was a Jesus of history I
[1:41:28] mean he had to receive what Paul told
[1:41:33] him he had to receive the light think
[1:41:37] about it you say but he's already
[1:41:40] received it in the past but there was
[1:41:41] the past he had to come into the present
[1:41:44] truth he had to come to the present
[1:41:46] truth and so here was this challenge
[1:41:48] would he receive it and stay in darkness
[1:41:49] or would he I mean so I reject it and
[1:41:52] gone to darkness or receive it and
[1:41:54] continue walk in the light and you see
[1:41:57] he received it there's many a policies
[1:42:00] in this day many many devout Christian
[1:42:04] people good people but you've got to
[1:42:07] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:42:09] you must walk in it not be next to it
[1:42:12] not just say yes that's light you've got
[1:42:14] to walk in it you got to walk in the
[1:42:16] word I mean you got to receive the word
[1:42:18] for what it is Alleluia and now here we
[1:42:23] are you say well but now we're in the
[1:42:25] New Testament this is in the book of
[1:42:27] Revelation that Jesus has seven stars in
[1:42:29] his right hand and though the angels to
[1:42:31] the churches and we know an angel
[1:42:34] doesn't preach the gospel and a heavenly
[1:42:37] angel doesn't preach the gospel and
[1:42:38] angel means a messenger God uses man to
[1:42:42] preachers gospel he doesn't use heavenly
[1:42:43] angels he uses an earthly messenger
[1:42:46] right so those seven stars are the seven
[1:42:49] angels or messages to the churches and
[1:42:51] there's been there's been seven Church
[1:42:53] ages down through and the believers in
[1:42:56] those ages had to come under the light
[1:42:57] of that of that star and if they came
[1:43:01] under the light of that star they will
[1:43:03] walk in the light for their day
[1:43:06] amen and now we've come down to this
[1:43:09] hour and there's a star has come and the
[1:43:13] light has been shown and we're called to
[1:43:16] walk in that light if you don't walk in
[1:43:18] that light you're in darkness you say
[1:43:21] that's awful awful strong but it's true
[1:43:24] do you want to be like Moses I mean
[1:43:27] gonna be like the scribes and Pharisees
[1:43:28] but we have Moses you know oh we believe
[1:43:31] Paul's writings we believe the New
[1:43:33] Testament well if you believed if you
[1:43:35] believed those writings you'd believe
[1:43:38] his voice in this day because the voice
[1:43:40] in his day just speaks of those writings
[1:43:42] doesn't take you off into something else
[1:43:44] it's like back to the baptisms being
[1:43:46] restored and you read the scripture we
[1:43:48] don't need a revelation on baptism you
[1:43:49] just read all the scriptures about it
[1:43:51] it's not being baptized in the name of
[1:43:53] the Father and of the Son and the Holy
[1:43:54] Ghost what is that name
[1:43:56] the name is the Lord Jesus Christ I mean
[1:43:59] people say well I'll take the words of
[1:44:01] Jesus above the words of Paul or Peter
[1:44:03] on your next to I'll say well who was
[1:44:07] speaking this is this is if you're a
[1:44:08] Trinitarian God is one he's not three
[1:44:10] people but they say he's three persons
[1:44:13] in one purpose well if they are then
[1:44:15] they'll be saying the same thing will
[1:44:18] they not but but people say I'll take
[1:44:20] the words of Jesus the Sun above the
[1:44:22] words of the Holy Ghost through Peter
[1:44:24] and acts 2
[1:44:24] well that means they're contradicting if
[1:44:26] you take one word above the other what
[1:44:29] Peter said be be baptized name of Lord
[1:44:31] Jesus Christ a remission assert that is
[1:44:34] the name of the father and of the son of
[1:44:35] the Holy Ghost that's the same thing
[1:44:38] being said amen
[1:44:40] and then we come down to this day now
[1:44:42] that in which we live where God said
[1:44:44] when you see the days as it was a days
[1:44:46] of lot and as it was the days of Noah so
[1:44:50] shall it be when the Son of Man is
[1:44:51] revealed again when I am Jesus Christ is
[1:44:54] revealed again and we live in the days
[1:44:56] of Noah do we not go read the days of no
[1:44:59] it's his man began to multiply upon the
[1:45:01] face of the earth Google will world
[1:45:03] population it goes from just a couple of
[1:45:06] billion up to seven billion ramps up
[1:45:08] like this we're living in that day man's
[1:45:11] mind is filled with evil continually
[1:45:13] we're living in that day amen all these
[1:45:16] things are happening
[1:45:19] a lot what happened in the days of lot
[1:45:21] Sodom and Gomorrah were here the whole
[1:45:24] world is filled with it
[1:45:25] amen and there's a whole group of
[1:45:28] Christendom who's a lot and they're in
[1:45:30] Sodom and they're vexed by it and they
[1:45:32] want to try and fix it and let's try to
[1:45:34] make America great again let's try and
[1:45:36] Christian dies the world and all these
[1:45:38] things and they're Vic's boat but they
[1:45:39] can't do anything about it even though
[1:45:41] they try but there's another group
[1:45:43] there's another group that's not in
[1:45:45] Sodom that have been called out of Sodom
[1:45:47] amen and they're being separated Abraham
[1:45:50] wasn't inside of his on the plains of
[1:45:52] Mamre I mean he's waiting for the coming
[1:45:54] of the promised son hallelujah
[1:45:57] and then now God God makes a body and he
[1:46:01] makes - boy he makes he makes a body for
[1:46:04] two bodies one one for two angels I mean
[1:46:08] you know one each there's three of them
[1:46:09] is God back the body for himself he
[1:46:10] makes two bodies for two angels I said
[1:46:13] let's go down visit Abraham because now
[1:46:15] is the season now is the season where
[1:46:17] these bodies are going to be changed
[1:46:18] that they can receive the promised son
[1:46:19] and so it walks down there and Abraham
[1:46:23] now this is repeated again today what
[1:46:26] Bible character you identified with and
[1:46:29] then now he comes God down and a body of
[1:46:32] flesh and Abraham sees him it's three
[1:46:35] men walking but he says Lord come and
[1:46:38] have a meal with me and then after they
[1:46:40] have the conversation which I've gone to
[1:46:42] two of them walk down into Sodom but he
[1:46:44] says the Lord stays of Abraham and then
[1:46:46] so here comes here comes God and flesh
[1:46:48] and they have a meal and then Sarah
[1:46:51] Abraham's wife is in the tent behind
[1:46:53] them and God says where is Sarah thy
[1:46:55] wife she's your she's in the tent behind
[1:46:57] you and God says to Abraham according to
[1:47:00] time of life you shall have the promised
[1:47:02] son Allu and she's in the tent behind
[1:47:05] them laughs and she laughs in her heart
[1:47:07] how can I am nearly a hundred how can I
[1:47:09] please you with my lord gourry Genesis
[1:47:11] 18 that's where I'm quoting from how can
[1:47:15] I please with my lord
[1:47:16] since we're past age we can't have
[1:47:18] children and then God says to Abraham
[1:47:20] why did Sarah laugh and she comes out
[1:47:22] said no I didn't laugh said yes you did
[1:47:24] but you'll have the promised son and so
[1:47:27] so what was happening the thoughts of
[1:47:30] Sarah were being made known by God and
[1:47:32] flee
[1:47:33] and then Jesus we read about the woman
[1:47:35] at the well the same thing happened with
[1:47:37] her cuz that same God that visited
[1:47:39] Abraham became Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:47:42] so the same ministry was repeated and
[1:47:45] then God said now in the end time when
[1:47:47] you see the world in this condition I
[1:47:49] will come back again and I'll be
[1:47:51] revealed now here comes some light you
[1:47:54] got to walk in this light friends and so
[1:47:56] now God sends a prophet upon the earth
[1:47:58] as he said he would well know these
[1:48:00] things but you've got to be established
[1:48:02] and present truth because remember in
[1:48:03] this in time there's a blinding coming
[1:48:05] upon the Gentiles there's a blinding
[1:48:07] because the Jewish eyes are coming open
[1:48:09] just as it was that the opposite
[1:48:11] happened when the gospel first came so
[1:48:13] you got to be established in these
[1:48:14] things that the blinding doesn't come
[1:48:16] upon you
[1:48:17] amen so they're here so here is here's a
[1:48:20] here is a prophet here's a man from
[1:48:22] Kentucky yay tall and and it happens
[1:48:25] multitude at times now this is just like
[1:48:28] us yeah this is justice just like Jesus
[1:48:31] and the woman at the well and he begins
[1:48:34] to tell her this is what's wrong with
[1:48:35] you this is your name and then you begin
[1:48:38] to be seized I'm waiting for someone to
[1:48:40] come that's right that's the angel of
[1:48:41] the Lord and now he's here go watch it
[1:48:44] on the deep Gulf to the deep yeah go
[1:48:47] watch that it's on YouTube go watch it
[1:48:49] even it even just the last 15 minutes if
[1:48:51] you can't take an hour of it just the
[1:48:53] last fifty multi standing there
[1:48:54] thousands of people packed auditorium

[1:48:59] something I'm waiting on him
[1:49:01] cuz I'm just your brother I'm waiting
[1:49:02] for him to come he says now he's here
[1:49:04] I take every spirit under my control and
[1:49:08] these people come in front of him and
[1:49:09] you see a woman there won't hurt you
[1:49:19] that's just him his son Billy Paul said
[1:49:23] you didn't need we didn't need to wait
[1:49:26] for daddy to say the angel laws there he
[1:49:28] felt his presence come in the room if I
[1:49:31] knew he was there and a holy hush came
[1:49:32] over the whole place and then he began
[1:49:34] to tell the people as the Ministry of
[1:49:36] Jesus is repeated again it's not just a
[1:49:40] supernatural thing God is trying to get
[1:49:41] our attention this is me speaking this
[1:49:44] is me speaking
[1:49:46] this is redemption coming to you I mean
[1:49:48] if you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:49:50] light then the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:49:52] cleanses us from all sin al Elson and
[1:49:56] this is light coming to this is very
[1:49:58] important friends and so now here he is
[1:50:00] and he tells them what's wrong with them
[1:50:02] and their address and who they're
[1:50:03] praying for and then the Spirit of God
[1:50:05] moves out upon the audience and he
[1:50:07] points people out he doesn't say someone
[1:50:09] has a backache someone has a tummy ache
[1:50:10] someone's got a sore knee over here he
[1:50:12] says you you and that dress you there in
[1:50:16] that shirt this is what yeah and this is
[1:50:18] why you're praying for him this is all
[1:50:19] wrong eating him sometimes I you know I
[1:50:21] count we're now well into the
[1:50:24] discernment sometimes gonna be about a
[1:50:25] dozen things one person you couldn't
[1:50:28] even guess that this is what's wrong and
[1:50:31] this is where it is and this is your
[1:50:32] name this is your address and you're
[1:50:33] praying for this person as well and this
[1:50:35] and this and this as just details all
[1:50:38] the way down through what is that that's
[1:50:40] God speaking and God is doing that to
[1:50:43] tell you to show you what this man just
[1:50:46] preached is the truth he says if I be a
[1:50:50] true servant of God let him come now and
[1:50:52] prove that it's true that's quite a
[1:50:54] challenge he's challenging God now if
[1:50:56] I've said the truth you have to come
[1:50:57] vindicated then God comes into the place
[1:50:59] and there's sometimes he just goes down
[1:51:01] a road and you and the person next years
[1:51:03] got this person if she's got this person
[1:51:05] X you got us down down down what he's
[1:51:07] showing God as God is proving now this
[1:51:10] is me speaking this is Messiah speaking
[1:51:14] amen
[1:51:15] if you receive him that I send you
[1:51:17] receive me hallelujah and as many's
[1:51:21] believe there were baptized the name of
[1:51:22] Lord Jesus Christ amen you receive the
[1:51:26] word you get Redemption if you do not
[1:51:29] you're not redeemed it's flat but it's
[1:51:33] out as it is what it is we have some
[1:51:36] musicians to come please that's what I'm
[1:51:40] so thankful I was like the woman at the
[1:51:43] well I was like blind bartimaeus he was
[1:51:49] there the woman at the well just going
[1:51:52] through life but then one day he came to
[1:51:54] me he's got him he's got to meet you we
[1:51:58] get caught up and so many do
[1:51:59] and things that's like marry one of my
[1:52:01] favorite I think I've seen it before one
[1:52:03] of my favorite parts of the Scriptures
[1:52:05] the resurrection and the tomb is open
[1:52:09] Jesus's body's not there the disciples
[1:52:12] go to the tomb the woman come to the
[1:52:14] tomb first and he's not there and he's
[1:52:16] married and she's burdened she was
[1:52:19] bringing spices to to anoint his body
[1:52:23] and then he's a little I don't know how
[1:52:26] big she would have been but you know she
[1:52:29] she turns around she hears a voice
[1:52:30] behind her she thinks it's a gardener
[1:52:33] many times we wait what's going on and
[1:52:37] she sees if you know we're taking them
[1:52:41] tell me where is not a church this is
[1:53:14] not some religion that's not some
[1:53:15] different way of life this is God coming
[1:53:17] through his word claiming his bride
[1:53:20] taking it to himself
[1:53:22] to carry her away hallelujah and that's
[1:53:25] why I'm sorry thankful I didn't know a
[1:53:26] whole bunch of things but when I heard
[1:53:28] that prophets voice I was sitting in my
[1:53:30] room with headphones on and I was scared
[1:53:33] my flatmates would come in and bust me
[1:53:35] listening to sermons they didn't know I
[1:53:36] had any kind of desire for God they were
[1:53:39] the Christians at all
[1:53:40] but when I heard that voice and he spoke
[1:53:42] about being sealed into the kingdom by
[1:53:43] the Holy Ghost and being to be redeemed
[1:53:46] and completeness and enjoy something
[1:53:48] moved upon me I said lord I know I don't
[1:53:50] know you but meet me that I can change
[1:53:53] my heart take everything out of my life
[1:53:55] that's country to your word that I can
[1:53:57] know you and he did may take in a walk
[1:54:00] as I had to surrender to him I had to be
[1:54:03] willing to let go of my friends and what
[1:54:05] people think of me
[1:54:06] lay my life down I tell you I've never
[1:54:08] regretted it it's been over ten years
[1:54:11] ago all kinds of all my friends left me
[1:54:13] everyone left me I wasn't worried
[1:54:16] I didn't even gives us why then I may
[1:54:19] have told this before but how repeat
[1:54:20] myself one of my best friends first year
[1:54:23] of uni we were drinking buddies
[1:54:25] tell you what we could do a lot of
[1:54:28] things he doesn't live with me
[1:54:32] he's living somewhere else couple he
[1:54:34] yeah and we're not studying the same
[1:54:35] thing and then here he comes I meet the
[1:54:38] Lord I see him in the supermarket I
[1:54:40] haven't told him anything and we have a
[1:54:43] brief conversation and he looks at me as
[1:54:46] if I don't want to spend another time in
[1:54:49] your presence I think that was one of
[1:54:51] the last times I ever saw him again I
[1:54:52] didn't tell them that I'm a Christian
[1:54:54] now and how glorious it is or what
[1:54:56] happened to me I don't know how wood
[1:54:59] gets out hallelujah but he just and I
[1:55:04] don't know where is God now that's how
[1:55:06] it was and you got to think yourself
[1:55:09] sometimes does that friendship you have
[1:55:12] does that association you have even I
[1:55:16] could say that family pulled that you
[1:55:17] have does it really debt worth it in the
[1:55:20] long run is it really that worth it if
[1:55:22] it's holding you back
[1:55:24] you'd say Lord set me free set me free
[1:55:27] because if your friends are not pulling
[1:55:29] you towards the Lord Jesus Christ I say
[1:55:31] they're not your friends they are not
[1:55:33] really your friends they don't have your
[1:55:34] best interest in mind
[1:55:35] they just have their best interest in
[1:55:37] mind I want you around me to have a good
[1:55:39] time that's all they want they just want
[1:55:42] to have their own good time but what
[1:55:44] about you do they really care about you
[1:55:46] they don't really care about you I'll
[1:55:52] just walk with God
[1:55:53] we have receive friends I'm so glad in
[1:55:56] this dark world everyone's opinion is
[1:55:58] upon social media everyone's opinions on
[1:56:01] the internet well I think listen that
[1:56:02] God can come and find you he says you
[1:56:05] shall know the truth you shall not you
[1:56:08] might or one day if you're good enough
[1:56:10] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[1:56:13] shall set you free shall make you free
[1:56:15] amen they that seek me with all their
[1:56:18] heart shall
[1:56:20] find me they shell if you really seek
[1:56:23] him with all your heart you shall find
[1:56:25] him
[1:56:25] nada not a substitute not a religion
[1:56:29] you'll find him and that's that's why we
[1:56:33] gather that's why we believe what we
[1:56:34] believe because we were found I'd rather
[1:56:37] he found us I trust if he hasn't found
[1:56:41] you don't reason out well I've done this
[1:56:42] and I come to church and I do doesn't
[1:56:44] this has he found you
[1:56:45] has he found you has he changed you has
[1:56:49] he redeemed you I trust if it's a no you
[1:56:52] want to pray say Lord deal with my life
[1:56:55] I'm sick of being you know we get enough
[1:56:58] religion sometimes to make ourselves
[1:56:59] miserable I was there for years I was
[1:57:02] listening to this message and I was in
[1:57:04] the world and I couldn't break free of
[1:57:06] this as a tug of war but then God knows
[1:57:09] how to change situations that you
[1:57:11] finally get can you say I'm sick of this
[1:57:12] if you're sick of it just say Lord just
[1:57:15] take my life I don't have to work out
[1:57:17] what I had to give up I didn't have to
[1:57:20] work out now well I guess I've got to
[1:57:22] stop you know I know I've got to stop
[1:57:23] drinking
[1:57:24] I've got to stop playing computer games
[1:57:26] gonna stop listening to this you know
[1:57:28] music and watching movies and dressing
[1:57:30] an ungodly way with shorts and different
[1:57:32] things and I didn't have to work out I
[1:57:34] didn't think about those things I just
[1:57:36] said Lord take my life put me on your
[1:57:39] wheels mold me take everything that's
[1:57:41] country to your life out of me they even
[1:57:43] come and dwell in me that's I'd never
[1:57:46] Church to deal with me I didn't have
[1:57:48] anyone to guide me he guided me and
[1:57:50] that's how it should be I'm in easy a
[1:57:52] guide you you have to work out we'll
[1:57:54] have to give up this drive to keep this
[1:57:56] no just just receive home receivers work
[1:57:59] and then he'll take care of everything
[1:58:01] else
[1:58:02] hallelujah he's in the business of
[1:58:04] transforming people I mean you say well
[1:58:07] I can't do it of course you can't do it
[1:58:09] man's are fairly to begin with even our
[1:58:11] educated society and all our psychology
[1:58:14] doesn't do us any good I mean there's
[1:58:16] more people in this country that are
[1:58:17] depressed and on drugs and suicide and
[1:58:20] all different kinds of things this has
[1:58:22] been to be the first world this is me to
[1:58:24] be civilization
[1:58:27] made people empty and broken why because
[1:58:31] there's no God in this place I mean but
[1:58:34] if you have him you have everything holy
[1:58:37] you have everything if you have him and
[1:58:38] personally I'd rather have him because
[1:58:43] one day this thing will stop beating and
[1:58:46] what then I want to have no trouble at
[1:58:49] the river I don't want any trouble down
[1:58:52] there and I know if I surrender to his
[1:58:54] word here and everything even if I don't
[1:58:56] understand just do like your brother did
[1:58:58] he calling me a cane I'll tell you this
[1:59:01] cane could not be born again under the
[1:59:04] blood of bulls and goats his nature
[1:59:05] could not be changed but under the blood
[1:59:08] of Jesus Christ I believe anyone who
[1:59:10] truly wants it can be can be changed
[1:59:13] from a cane to enable I mean there's a
[1:59:16] power in this room right now they can
[1:59:18] change you from a cane to an able and
[1:59:20] from a Judas to Jesus whatever it is I
[1:59:23] mean II thought or Jacob whatever
[1:59:25] character you want to put in there's a
[1:59:27] power here they can change you amen
