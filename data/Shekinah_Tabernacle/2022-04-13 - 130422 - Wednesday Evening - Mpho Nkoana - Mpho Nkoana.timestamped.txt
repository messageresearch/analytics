[38:58] i would like you to have it to i would
[39:00] like us to read first
[39:03] in respect of the word of god amen
[39:06] let's read john chapter one and my
[39:08] brother
[39:09] i was trying to think to look at the
[39:11] screen they're hoping that i can see
[39:13] because tonight i'm a bit disorganized
[39:17] i'm a bit disorganized in the sense that
[39:20] i didn't send my
[39:23] my document to a powerpoint because it's
[39:26] usually bigger
[39:27] so i was i'm going to rely on the
[39:30] weight document that i've put but
[39:33] i'm hoping that um i will see
[39:36] amen
[39:37] i hope that i'm going to see but you
[39:39] don't need to panic so i'd like us to
[39:41] read the book of john chapter one
[39:44] john chapter one
[39:47] and we'll read it and then we will see
[39:49] down
[39:50] amen
[39:52] that's our subject on the board there
[39:54] tonight
[39:55] and
[39:56] the title
[39:57] is upon thy confession
[39:59] that is the title upon thy
[40:02] confession whose confession your one
[40:05] my confession upon my confession
[40:08] and our subject line is that the power
[40:11] of a heartily confession
[40:13] that's the line of thought that i would
[40:14] like us to
[40:16] to follow that's the line of thought
[40:18] that i would like the thought that i
[40:20] want us to
[40:21] just to flow you know when the river
[40:23] flows you know and it flows and and you
[40:26] can see it when you on your in the
[40:27] aeroplane you can see a river going you
[40:29] know like it's following a line of
[40:31] thought of god
[40:32] so that's the line of thought i want us
[40:35] to think
[40:36] the power there is power in your
[40:38] confession
[40:39] so that's what we are going to speak
[40:41] about after reading this scripture
[40:43] right
[40:44] it says the bible here in the beginning
[40:47] was the word
[40:49] and the word
[40:50] was with god and the word
[40:53] was god
[40:55] amen
[40:57] verse two
[40:58] am i
[41:00] oh yeah sorry i made a mistake so i want
[41:02] us
[41:03] that will read john chapter one is down
[41:04] the line but that's genesis it's because
[41:06] i couldn't see
[41:08] i'm sorry i apologize
[41:10] apologize uh on the on the video line
[41:13] with the video length and some something
[41:14] said to me
[41:16] john reminds me of genesis the lord was
[41:19] trying to tell me no no no no no go read
[41:21] genesis
[41:23] so if you can magnify it a little bit
[41:25] further then
[41:27] then i'll see
[41:28] unless if you don't mind i'm gonna read
[41:30] here
[41:32] that's much better a little more one
[41:34] more
[41:35] thank you
[41:36] i can see much better now it's because
[41:38] i'm not young anymore
[41:41] now
[41:43] genesis 1 john chapter 1 is also our
[41:45] main scripture
[41:47] but i want us to start with genesis it
[41:49] says the bible
[41:51] in the beginning god created the heaven
[41:54] and the earth
[41:55] right
[41:56] where in the beginning
[41:58] and the earth was without form and void
[42:02] and darkness was upon the face of the
[42:04] deep
[42:05] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[42:07] face of the
[42:09] waters
[42:10] now
[42:11] there's
[42:12] verse three
[42:14] that's what i want you to look at and
[42:16] god said listen listen to this god said
[42:18] god he speaks
[42:20] god is starting to confess i want you to
[42:22] follow the thought god starts to confess
[42:25] now
[42:26] uh and he
[42:28] and god said let there be
[42:31] light
[42:33] you see that's what god said
[42:35] and then it says end there was
[42:38] light
[42:39] you see
[42:40] god
[42:42] confessed
[42:44] and then
[42:45] something happened what god confessed it
[42:47] happened
[42:49] amen let's just buy our hearts and pray
[42:52] our heavenly father
[42:53] lord jesus
[42:55] i know
[42:56] there's nothing that i can say
[42:59] that can save anyone
[43:01] but my father your weight is eternal
[43:04] life
[43:05] your weight is so powerful
[43:07] that father right now each one of us can
[43:10] take it and confess it lord
[43:12] and we can receive
[43:14] what we're asking
[43:16] make us to believe your weight lord
[43:19] take our our coming here and make it
[43:22] beneficial
[43:23] for us to ask coming here make make it
[43:27] make it further beneficial to that one
[43:29] who press that streaming and is busy
[43:33] following the service with us
[43:35] that one sitting in their little place
[43:37] alone somewhere father
[43:40] joining in the service with your
[43:42] children bless them father we just want
[43:45] to commit your weight into your hands
[43:46] lord
[43:47] all those that could not make it as well
[43:49] bless them father be be their portion as
[43:52] well lord jesus christ we just want to
[43:54] ask these things humbling ourselves in
[43:57] your presence in the name of our lord
[43:59] jesus christ amen
[44:01] you may enjoy the comfort of your seed
[44:03] of your seeds
[44:05] now verse 3 is it i want you to think
[44:08] about vestry along our title
[44:11] god said you see
[44:13] to to let's just go down a little bit
[44:15] brother ben
[44:17] and then we have already read john i
[44:19] wouldn't mind to read it again it's such
[44:20] a wonderful piece of scripture
[44:23] in the beginning was the word you see
[44:26] and then we can see because god in
[44:29] genesis chapter one
[44:30] he said
[44:32] when you say something you speak a word
[44:34] isn't it even brother daniel when you
[44:36] speak you speak a word that is why john
[44:39] there says in the beginning was the wait
[44:41] because it was that that's what that is
[44:44] what was there at the beginning
[44:46] god the word spoke
[44:49] right that's what happened in the
[44:50] beginning was that wait
[44:53] and the word was with god and the word
[44:55] was god so the word spoke at the
[44:57] beginning the word spoke you know to
[45:00] confess is to is to to speak
[45:04] to profess we'll see as we go along is
[45:07] to profess i would like you to follow me
[45:09] i'm going to give you a quick one then
[45:11] we are done
[45:12] but i would like you not to lose me
[45:14] along the way is to profess is to speak
[45:17] now many times when we say speak we are
[45:20] only thinking about
[45:22] verbalizing it you know with our
[45:25] mouth
[45:27] you see but but you see there's so many
[45:29] things that communicate in us around us
[45:33] there's so many things that we do and
[45:35] communicate and and actually speak in
[45:38] them without even verbalizing them
[45:40] in our hearts
[45:42] in our minds
[45:44] with our actions
[45:46] so there's so much that we are
[45:48] confessing
[45:51] sometimes away
[45:52] sometimes and away yeah are we together
[45:55] so so that is the thinking that i would
[45:58] like us to follow but at the beginning
[45:59] was the way let's read romans
[46:01] romans chapter 10
[46:04] hallelujah
[46:05] you can see today
[46:07] um
[46:08] i'm
[46:09] i'm a little bit relaxed so i said to my
[46:11] i said
[46:13] take it easy
[46:15] so that's what i'm going to try to do to
[46:16] allow the lord
[46:18] you know to speak the way he wants to
[46:20] speak romans chapter 10
[46:22] let's read from verse 8.
[46:24] i just want to see if i can tie these
[46:26] three scriptures just to link them up
[46:27] with thought
[46:29] now it says here from verse eight
[46:32] but
[46:34] what sayeth eat
[46:36] what sayeth it
[46:38] the word is naidi
[46:41] you know who knows the meaning of the
[46:42] weight nigh
[46:44] it's nearer isn't it it's close
[46:47] right
[46:49] the weight
[46:51] the weight
[46:52] which weight
[46:54] huh
[46:55] his weight
[46:57] right that the weight
[46:59] there's no difference from the way that
[47:01] the lord spoke at the beginning when he
[47:03] said let there be
[47:04] there's no difference between the word
[47:06] that is spoken by john when he says in
[47:08] the beginning
[47:10] was the word and there's no difference
[47:12] between this word that paul is saying to
[47:14] the romans here and me and you that
[47:18] the word
[47:19] is nigh thee even in thy mouth now
[47:22] listen
[47:24] and in thy heart i like that this is
[47:26] what i was just trying to tell you now
[47:28] and in the heart that is the word of
[47:32] faith
[47:32] which we preach
[47:35] you see that way which we preach which
[47:37] is the weight of faith ah did god use
[47:40] faith at the beginning
[47:41] yeah ah can you see now so
[47:44] that word is naidi
[47:47] even hindi
[47:50] and in thai
[47:52] are we together
[47:54] now that is the word which we preach
[47:56] it is the word of faith
[48:00] verse 9 that if thou shalt confess man
[48:05] i like this if thou shalt confess
[48:07] you see now now that if thou shalt
[48:10] confess
[48:11] with thy mouth
[48:13] the lord jesus shall be
[48:17] and shall believe in thine heart that
[48:20] god had raised him from the dead thou
[48:23] shalt be saved
[48:25] let's just pause
[48:26] you know when you're traveling on a
[48:28] journey
[48:30] like like the clowns went to
[48:32] taopo
[48:36] there comes a point in your journey when
[48:38] you pause
[48:40] and you say okay let's put petrol and
[48:42] then we buy some mcdonald's we are
[48:44] passing you see but there's one thing
[48:47] that you are also doing
[48:50] and
[48:51] when you are on that journey and you
[48:52] pause like we are posting now on this
[48:54] verse
[48:55] you are not thinking about where you are
[48:57] coming from yeah huh i've never it's
[49:01] very rare that when you are traveling on
[49:03] a journey you are your discussions in
[49:06] the car are about where you are coming
[49:09] from of course there may be discussions
[49:11] about where we are coming from maybe we
[49:13] forgot something
[49:14] but the primary discussion of the or the
[49:17] primary communication
[49:20] is about where we are going
[49:22] i can hear brother ben asking sister
[49:24] christine lavi when we left there did
[49:27] when we left home on friday
[49:30] did you end the close for the kids for
[49:31] school tomorrow
[49:33] i can hear him
[49:35] i can i can i can hear them andy and ron
[49:37] when travelling maybe to live in in the
[49:39] morning saying oh yesterday i wonder if
[49:42] i lock those doors
[49:43] and they think today
[49:45] they are not saying uh no no the very
[49:47] little of the discussion can talk about
[49:49] did you make the bed when you left home
[49:51] they are talking about where they are
[49:53] going because there is a day ahead of
[49:55] them
[49:56] you see now when you wake up in the
[49:58] morning and you are on a journey of your
[50:00] daily journey you are thinking of your
[50:02] day ahead
[50:04] very little
[50:05] if if not nothing you are going to say
[50:08] oh let me just think about yesterday now
[50:10] okay
[50:11] what happened yesterday how is that
[50:13] going to benefit you
[50:15] you are thinking of the
[50:17] destination
[50:18] where you are going
[50:20] and that's how
[50:22] and what we are doing right now on this
[50:24] journey what brings me to that point
[50:27] what brings me to that point is that now
[50:29] and i don't know what brought me to that
[50:31] point
[50:32] but because i love this verse so much is
[50:34] that
[50:35] that if thou shalt confess
[50:37] with your mouth
[50:39] the lord jesus and
[50:41] sorry with thy mouth the lord jesus
[50:44] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[50:46] mouth the lord jesus you confess him
[50:48] with your mouth
[50:50] and shall believe in thine heart
[50:54] that god had raised him from the dead
[50:56] thou shalt be saved
[50:59] so
[51:00] what if i don't confess
[51:04] where will my salvation be
[51:08] if i don't confess will i be saved
[51:12] we shall see
[51:14] verse 10 for with the heart
[51:17] men believe unto righteousness and with
[51:20] the mouth confession is made unto
[51:26] did you hear that
[51:28] now your salvation my salvation is not
[51:31] just a
[51:32] an automatic
[51:34] incident
[51:35] it's a process
[51:36] in this process of doing a number of
[51:39] things of coming to a level of maturity
[51:42] of doing so many things in this process
[51:44] confession is one of those
[51:47] are we together
[51:50] because if you can't confess
[51:54] okay i'll ask you a question
[51:56] if god at the beginning
[51:59] he just thought about these things
[52:01] that are in his mind and he knows he's a
[52:03] heel he wants to be a healer and then
[52:06] everything about himself he knows right
[52:08] and then he never confessed he never
[52:10] spoke
[52:11] do you think that would have been
[52:12] creation
[52:13] right
[52:16] now god had to speak
[52:18] it doesn't mean he doesn't believe in
[52:20] his word no no god had to speak
[52:24] because confessing is part and parcel of
[52:26] salvation
[52:28] right so god had to do that
[52:31] now now we can just go down again
[52:35] brother man and see and just read the
[52:38] last one
[52:40] hebrews chapter 3 yes
[52:42] thank you
[52:44] and read hebrews chapter three
[52:49] are we going to hebrews chapter three
[52:51] are you or are you depending on my
[52:52] document
[52:55] god bless you that's still all right
[52:57] hebrews chapter three
[53:01] thank you
[53:02] and let's read one
[53:04] because you see the bible says here
[53:08] wherefore holy brethren
[53:10] am i among the scriptures yes wherefore
[53:13] brethren
[53:14] holy brethren partakers of the heavenly
[53:17] calling consider the apostle and high
[53:20] consider the apostle and the high priest
[53:24] of our profession
[53:26] jesus christ christ jesus you see the
[53:30] prophet taught us that profession is is
[53:33] translated in confession
[53:36] you see when you hear
[53:38] let's not talk about but
[53:41] when when when you pro when you profess
[53:43] when you con you're confessing something
[53:46] right profess is translated in
[53:48] confession right and i want us to go
[53:51] down a little bit again sorry my
[53:53] brothers today i'm gonna give you
[53:54] full-time work
[53:58] i thought i could just fold my
[54:00] hands here like like brother ben
[54:05] no you know there's people who
[54:08] who who copied one of the brand name you
[54:10] know when he works like this they also
[54:12] so
[54:13] so i i'm sure i won't get i'm working on
[54:16] the right footsteps every other bit
[54:17] now if i fold that
[54:19] now
[54:21] let's just unpack that with confession
[54:23] they say
[54:24] from the greek
[54:26] is an original word that came from the
[54:28] greek and the word confess it is this
[54:31] they say they say a homologio
[54:36] homologio if you can just
[54:38] a little bit more one more just extend
[54:39] it zoom zoom it up sorry
[54:42] and homologio homo homologio sorry
[54:45] homologio
[54:47] meaning
[54:48] to say the same thing
[54:52] to say the same thing and then agree
[54:55] admit
[54:56] acknowledge all right
[54:58] that is the meaning of the word
[55:00] homologio i'm not talking about hormonal
[55:02] lady
[55:03] who knows hormonal lady
[55:09] i'm talking about homologio
[55:12] it means to say the same thing
[55:17] then
[55:18] agree admit acknowledge
[55:22] they say the emphatic the emphatic
[55:24] meaning of the word you know otherwise
[55:26] the more emphasized and more stronger
[55:29] meaning of the word homologio is
[55:31] exomological
[55:37] [Laughter]
[55:43] yeah that's in greek that's the emphatic
[55:45] meaning of the word
[55:47] homologio so they say is it means to
[55:50] promise to consent
[55:52] to admit
[55:54] confess or acknowledge
[55:56] huh
[55:57] from this praise
[55:59] right to this to to praise
[56:02] right
[56:03] so homologio that is now the bottom one
[56:06] homologio
[56:08] uh from a comp of the base in in three
[56:13] three six seven four and and all those
[56:15] years and then there is like a covenant
[56:18] to acknowledge to confess to profess
[56:21] see the prophet said it the prophet it's
[56:23] not the prophet here this is the this is
[56:24] the greeks and the dictionary and dr
[56:27] google but the prophet also already said
[56:29] it that to profess
[56:31] confession made give thanks promise
[56:34] now if we unpack this weight you see
[56:36] there's a lot loaded in this weight
[56:39] with that in mind that means to confess
[56:43] has got so much to do with our
[56:45] day-to-day living
[56:47] [Music]
[56:48] confession has got a lot to do with our
[56:51] day-to-day living because if i'm going
[56:53] to admit to agree to acknowledge to say
[56:56] the same thing how many times do we do
[56:59] that on a daily basis
[57:00] even now me and you are busy agreeing
[57:04] admitting acknowledging or not
[57:05] technology
[57:07] right now she's sitting there confession
[57:09] is busy taking place
[57:12] are we together let's go down brother
[57:14] ben now it just depends you see
[57:17] confession has got the upside of it
[57:20] and the downside
[57:22] upstream low stream
[57:24] i'm still talking about the upstream
[57:27] there is the downstream of it where the
[57:30] devil comes to eve and confess things
[57:35] you see that's the downstream that's the
[57:37] bad part of confession
[57:41] now what makes confession alive and
[57:43] successful in the life of a believer or
[57:46] what makes confession successful in
[57:48] anyone's life in any person think of
[57:52] good good confessions bad confessions
[57:54] but what makes it really successful what
[57:57] brings it to pass
[57:59] is when you believe
[58:01] in it
[58:03] think about this
[58:05] do you think
[58:06] uh
[58:10] i wanted to bring
[58:13] but the example that i wanted to give
[58:15] you it was not so appropriate but the
[58:17] point is this that if you believe in
[58:19] something
[58:21] and you confess it
[58:23] it comes to pass
[58:24] in other words your confession right
[58:27] your confession is activated by the
[58:29] amount of faith that you put in
[58:33] no use to confess something
[58:35] and if you don't believe in it
[58:37] because it will never come to pass
[58:39] you understand it won't come to pass
[58:41] because you don't believe it that means
[58:43] confession starts actually from the
[58:45] inside
[58:46] confession in other words is not just a
[58:48] verbal mouth thing
[58:50] isn't it the bible says out of their
[58:52] hearts yes
[58:55] doesn't the bible says god does not look
[58:57] at what much not much what i say on the
[58:59] lips
[59:00] no
[59:01] god looks at the confession from inside
[59:05] you'll see now as we go along
[59:08] now
[59:09] what makes confession successful is when
[59:11] you believe in it or you put to put it
[59:14] differently when you believe that what
[59:17] you confess
[59:18] that's what makes confession
[59:20] to be successful
[59:23] are we together
[59:25] yes are we believing together
[59:27] don't doesn't matter
[59:29] much from your mouth
[59:31] as compared to your heart
[59:33] it is important what you say from your
[59:35] mouth
[59:36] i agree
[59:37] but it is not believed it is not
[59:40] supported by this operational man called
[59:43] faith
[59:45] how is it going to pass
[59:47] it is just vapor
[59:50] right it's just excitement
[59:52] ah it's just feelings right huh it's
[59:55] just to pass time
[59:57] huh
[59:58] so you don't want to live a life where
[1:00:00] you are just passing time you want to to
[1:00:03] believe in what you are confessing
[1:00:05] if you say
[1:00:06] i believe in jesus christ believe in it
[1:00:10] don't just say it believe in what you
[1:00:12] say
[1:00:13] believe it because it must be coming
[1:00:15] from the heart
[1:00:16] otherwise
[1:00:17] that's what the prophet isaiah said oh
[1:00:19] this my people that they're out of out
[1:00:22] they just talk to me about their from
[1:00:25] their lips
[1:00:26] but from their hearts they are not they
[1:00:28] are far away from me i'm going to read
[1:00:30] for you as we go along so as we go along
[1:00:33] our nation is very short tonight
[1:00:36] but i want us to go down
[1:00:37] just to somewhere
[1:00:40] right and pause there the prophet
[1:00:42] someone says but the lord said unto
[1:00:44] someone look not on his countenance this
[1:00:47] is the story of choosing the king
[1:00:50] of israel you know the story right
[1:00:53] now he was saying the lord saying to
[1:00:55] someone no
[1:00:57] remember someone was the prophet
[1:00:59] but he was also a human being god tells
[1:01:01] him don't look at the outside
[1:01:04] don't look at the countenance
[1:01:07] or on the height of his teacher but i
[1:01:10] have refused him
[1:01:13] for the lord seeth not as a man see it
[1:01:16] for men look at on the outward
[1:01:19] appearance but the lord looked on the
[1:01:22] heart you see god does not does not
[1:01:26] worry much about the outside appearance
[1:01:29] which we spend so much time
[1:01:32] decorating
[1:01:34] oh yes brother i must just talk to you
[1:01:36] properly even when the brothers come
[1:01:38] here to the pulpit they change the work
[1:01:42] when the brothers go when they go for a
[1:01:44] communion everyone is humble
[1:01:47] just hug your wife
[1:01:49] the children are together
[1:01:51] oh lord this is holiness
[1:01:54] but god does not actually look at god
[1:01:59] that is important
[1:02:00] as long as it comes from there
[1:02:03] is
[1:02:04] that confession you know when i hold my
[1:02:07] whole family and
[1:02:09] many times we just want to make sure
[1:02:11] that the pastor
[1:02:13] my friends and the family and we can say
[1:02:15] oh that's your humble brother look how
[1:02:17] he's holding his wife oh look how he's
[1:02:20] greeting that brother oh god bless you
[1:02:22] my father
[1:02:24] which is good
[1:02:25] but it must come from there
[1:02:28] otherwise god is not looking at it
[1:02:30] doesn't shake god it doesn't move god
[1:02:33] you are just performing
[1:02:35] now
[1:02:37] performance must be supported by
[1:02:41] all right
[1:02:45] are we together brothers and sisters
[1:02:47] when i say i love you
[1:02:48] my brother
[1:02:50] i must mean it yes and i must believe in
[1:02:52] it
[1:02:53] i'm confessing love unto thee right when
[1:02:56] i say i love you oh god bless you my
[1:02:59] brother i must be meaning it otherwise
[1:03:02] i'm wasting your time
[1:03:04] otherwise i'm wasting whose time my own
[1:03:06] time
[1:03:07] otherwise that is just vapor otherwise
[1:03:09] i'm a hippo
[1:03:11] finish it up
[1:03:13] right
[1:03:14] now and a god that's not like a
[1:03:16] pretending heart yeah
[1:03:18] god does not like your pretending heart
[1:03:21] no
[1:03:22] god hates it
[1:03:24] a proud heart a pretending heart a
[1:03:26] hypocritical heart god hates it it's
[1:03:29] better to say i don't believe you hey
[1:03:32] brother i don't like you
[1:03:34] because of this this this this let's
[1:03:36] talk it please
[1:03:38] then we talk yeah then it's done then i
[1:03:40] realized i get a new revelation i get
[1:03:42] the real revelation that actually i love
[1:03:44] you
[1:03:46] so it is better
[1:03:48] that way
[1:03:50] but many times we just want to polish it
[1:03:52] up you know
[1:03:53] oh yeah oh god bless you man of god
[1:03:56] oh yeah you know just polish but that's
[1:03:59] okay
[1:04:00] but it must come from the heart
[1:04:02] otherwise that confession is meaningless
[1:04:06] you are putting effort on the wrong
[1:04:07] thing
[1:04:08] the efforts should be on your true
[1:04:11] confession
[1:04:12] because you are about to take over you
[1:04:15] are preparing for your destination if
[1:04:17] you are preparing for your destination
[1:04:19] why you want to talk about things that
[1:04:21] are not real
[1:04:22] why are you telling me about uh in the
[1:04:25] cargo when i'm going to vanguard
[1:04:28] right
[1:04:31] why
[1:04:32] if i'm going to wangaray tell me about
[1:04:35] phangare
[1:04:36] tell me about the rules there tell me
[1:04:38] about the science don't tell me about
[1:04:40] don't waste my time telling me about in
[1:04:41] vicar i'm not going there
[1:04:44] i'm going to
[1:04:45] hungary
[1:04:47] when the time comes for me to go to
[1:04:48] indicator
[1:04:50] we'll talk about invokage
[1:04:53] the two thing must be what i'm saying
[1:04:55] from my heart
[1:04:57] and i want to emphasize on this why
[1:05:00] because god does not value what you are
[1:05:02] saying on the outside god does not care
[1:05:04] much
[1:05:05] about the countenance
[1:05:07] about
[1:05:08] the race
[1:05:09] about your your your how you station
[1:05:12] that you look
[1:05:13] i can go and lift and pump those things
[1:05:16] at the gym
[1:05:18] god doesn't look at those
[1:05:21] i can leave myself to be hopeless and
[1:05:24] just be
[1:05:25] unfit
[1:05:27] which is bad
[1:05:29] but still god does not look at that
[1:05:33] i'm not saying don't go to the gym or go
[1:05:34] to the gym i'm just saying
[1:05:37] god does not look at pastors at the
[1:05:39] countenance should we then rather just
[1:05:42] live anyhow no
[1:05:44] you should live according to the word of
[1:05:45] god because the word of god is the one
[1:05:46] that is going to guide you how oh
[1:05:49] it will say okay go to the gym
[1:05:51] god god will guide you whether you go to
[1:05:53] the gym or not
[1:05:55] he'll get you whether your weight is
[1:05:57] okay
[1:05:58] the way it is oh no it's okay you don't
[1:06:00] have to lose my sister you're okay
[1:06:03] he will tell you
[1:06:05] are we together god is able to do that
[1:06:08] he was the first person to confess all
[1:06:10] right let's go down my brothers
[1:06:13] he's worried he's concerned about what
[1:06:14] is in the heart
[1:06:16] they a strong link between the heart and
[1:06:18] the mouth
[1:06:20] the heart and mouth link
[1:06:22] there's a problem
[1:06:24] when you say something
[1:06:26] from your mouth
[1:06:27] but your heart is not saying the same
[1:06:29] thing
[1:06:30] ah then there's a problem that that that
[1:06:33] the mouth says something and the heart
[1:06:35] says something or the heart says
[1:06:36] something the mouth what
[1:06:38] this is that's the contradiction you see
[1:06:41] we don't like we don't want to live a
[1:06:42] life of contradiction we want that
[1:06:45] because
[1:06:46] because matthew
[1:06:48] says that
[1:06:50] these people draw it nigh unto me with
[1:06:52] their mouth
[1:06:54] and
[1:06:55] honored me with their lips
[1:06:57] but their heart is far from me that's a
[1:07:00] problem there must be an alignment
[1:07:04] there must be a collaboration between
[1:07:07] what is being said on the heart
[1:07:09] and what is being said in there
[1:07:12] will you be all right if you just plant
[1:07:14] a tree
[1:07:15] an apple tree
[1:07:17] and then when you are supposed to
[1:07:19] harvest your harvesting oranges
[1:07:22] will you be alright with that
[1:07:24] it cannot be it's against all the rules
[1:07:27] i don't want to say the rules of nature
[1:07:28] but it's against the nature of god
[1:07:31] what you see god
[1:07:33] what he says is what he means
[1:07:36] and the god hasn't got the time to say
[1:07:38] no no no i was just joking
[1:07:41] no god hasn't everything that god does
[1:07:43] is serious
[1:07:45] i'm not saying god he's a shrewd man who
[1:07:48] says hey i'm sick no no
[1:07:50] god he's a wonderful handsome
[1:07:53] and a wonderful man but
[1:07:55] what whatever he says
[1:07:58] if he looks at you with a smile and he
[1:08:00] says i love you he's serious about that
[1:08:02] he means it
[1:08:03] and that is what the reality that's the
[1:08:05] confession he is saying upon you
[1:08:08] right because there's a strong link
[1:08:09] between the mouth and the
[1:08:12] heart
[1:08:12] and if they start not to say the same
[1:08:14] thing there is a problem
[1:08:16] something is in between there that needs
[1:08:18] to be removed
[1:08:19] are we are we together god bless you ben
[1:08:21] and maggie welcome
[1:08:23] now
[1:08:24] now
[1:08:25] let's go on with it and verse 10 it says
[1:08:29] oh yeah let me finish verse eight verse
[1:08:31] nine but in vain they do worship me
[1:08:34] touching for a teaching for doctrines
[1:08:36] and the commandments of men
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:41] and he called he called the multitude
[1:08:43] and said unto them hear and understand
[1:08:47] not that which goes into the mouth
[1:08:49] divided a mouth
[1:08:50] but that was coming out of their mouth
[1:08:53] you followed a man sorry
[1:08:56] it's not it's not much
[1:08:58] that goes into the mouth that divided a
[1:09:00] man but that wish it comes out
[1:09:06] uh we understand that verse but what i
[1:09:09] want to to think about
[1:09:11] is that
[1:09:12] the confession that i make
[1:09:15] can be
[1:09:16] can give life
[1:09:18] or it can destroy
[1:09:21] and that's that's that's why it's
[1:09:23] important that there's a link strong
[1:09:25] positive link between the heart and the
[1:09:28] mouth
[1:09:29] the confession
[1:09:31] because both
[1:09:32] the heart confess
[1:09:33] and the mouth speaketh it out
[1:09:35] or my actions or whatever i do speaking
[1:09:37] so there must be that link a strong one
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:42] let's go to isaiah 29 brother ben
[1:09:44] sorry i'm preaching with my back
[1:09:47] today
[1:09:48] wherefore
[1:09:50] the lord said first for as much as these
[1:09:52] people draw near near me with their
[1:09:55] mouth
[1:09:56] drawing near to god with your mouth
[1:09:59] i don't want that lord
[1:10:01] please my father
[1:10:02] and i with their lips do honor me
[1:10:06] but have removed their heart far but
[1:10:09] have removed their heart far from me
[1:10:12] and their feet and and their fear toward
[1:10:15] me is taught by the percept of men by
[1:10:18] the precept
[1:10:21] that's a bad condition brother andy
[1:10:24] that's how powerful
[1:10:26] confession is
[1:10:28] confession can come out
[1:10:31] and it's not from the heart
[1:10:34] i don't know if
[1:10:36] there can be
[1:10:37] a wrong confession
[1:10:39] in the heart
[1:10:41] or can be a good con there can be a good
[1:10:43] confession from the heart and a wrong
[1:10:45] confession coming out
[1:10:47] or a good confession
[1:10:49] or what's the opposite of it
[1:10:52] bad confession from the heart and a good
[1:10:54] one coming out
[1:10:56] or
[1:10:57] a good and a bad
[1:10:59] that's possible i don't know if that's
[1:11:00] possible
[1:11:01] it's possible
[1:11:03] but now that's that's that's the warning
[1:11:05] that god was as i was telling this these
[1:11:08] people of israel and that was said also
[1:11:11] in matthew
[1:11:13] that ah you are worshipping me just with
[1:11:15] your lips
[1:11:16] your heart is not there why is that
[1:11:18] important for confession because out of
[1:11:20] the heart the mouth speaketh should
[1:11:23] speak ideally right let's just go down a
[1:11:26] little bit brother ben
[1:11:28] now you see if we pause there on that
[1:11:31] paragraph i wrote the title there that
[1:11:33] 95 percent truth five percent lie
[1:11:37] the prophet taught us he said
[1:11:39] the la the lie that came that satan told
[1:11:42] eve was 90 90 oh i said he said 90 i put
[1:11:46] five i i did it
[1:11:49] i wanted to write 90
[1:11:53] ninety percent tooth
[1:11:55] eh
[1:11:57] the devil confessed truth
[1:11:59] ninety percent of it
[1:12:01] because he knows
[1:12:02] that he you know
[1:12:05] your heart can confess ninety percent
[1:12:07] truth
[1:12:08] and a five percent
[1:12:09] lie
[1:12:10] we must be able to confess hundred
[1:12:13] percent truth and be the one that comes
[1:12:16] out
[1:12:17] i used to write chickens
[1:12:19] in my previous life in south africa
[1:12:22] and they applaud there at the lord what
[1:12:24] do you call here what did they call it
[1:12:26] live life
[1:12:27] lifestyle lifestyle blog i used to have
[1:12:30] chickens at one point we had 250
[1:12:32] chickens
[1:12:33] just for eating just for fun so
[1:12:36] now
[1:12:37] if a chicken was laying eggs
[1:12:40] and
[1:12:41] it brews over them
[1:12:44] 20x imagine you find this ambitious with
[1:12:47] a lot of eggs it lays them and then just
[1:12:50] two chicks hedges
[1:12:53] just two chicks and it was sitting on
[1:12:56] them for 21 days
[1:12:58] that chicken must go to the pot
[1:13:02] it must go directly to that pot
[1:13:05] because
[1:13:07] firstly
[1:13:08] we should have eaten those eggs given
[1:13:10] the believers at church to eat
[1:13:13] or
[1:13:14] it would have increased the chickens in
[1:13:16] the farm but now it wastes time
[1:13:20] it sits on those eggs
[1:13:22] and and they never they never hatch and
[1:13:24] why in the first place they did had to
[1:13:26] lay so many eggs if it can't cover them
[1:13:29] that chicken goes to the pot a heart
[1:13:32] must must confess
[1:13:35] hundred percent truth
[1:13:37] and the mouth bring same hundred percent
[1:13:41] not a percentage half person no no
[1:13:43] hundred percent
[1:13:44] now that's what the prophet says that
[1:13:46] what the otherwise we become like the
[1:13:48] devil
[1:13:50] otherwise we come and tell 90 percent
[1:13:53] truth
[1:13:55] and god never told 90 percent truth god
[1:13:57] always told hundred percent the moment
[1:13:59] you find yourself
[1:14:01] did you hear the pastor preaching about
[1:14:03] lies
[1:14:05] the moment you find yourself saying ah
[1:14:07] no no i i didn't mean all right you
[1:14:10] might need to watch out you need to be
[1:14:12] careful mama chanted isn't it i need to
[1:14:14] be careful
[1:14:15] that what i'm confessing is hundred
[1:14:18] percent otherwise i must shut up
[1:14:20] otherwise i must keep quiet because i
[1:14:21] don't i don't mean 100 i mean 90. you
[1:14:25] see so i must go back to my heart before
[1:14:28] i even tell you that i'm sorry when i'm
[1:14:30] not sorry i must go back to my heart and
[1:14:32] say am i sorry
[1:14:36] i'm not saying sorry meaningfully 100
[1:14:38] when i say sorry to you i must mean
[1:14:41] sorry not sorry but
[1:14:45] but what
[1:14:46] but what
[1:14:48] there's nobody in god
[1:14:50] hundred percent or nothing
[1:14:52] the devil is the only one
[1:14:54] who says who reasons he reasons he when
[1:14:58] you go to university they say they
[1:14:59] analyze they tell you to take the
[1:15:02] statement you know they just tell you
[1:15:04] okay analyze this mic
[1:15:07] meaning they say reason reason with this
[1:15:09] mic this mic is good and it was made in
[1:15:13] japan and it can do this and can do that
[1:15:17] but it's not so good
[1:15:20] because you see you're listening that's
[1:15:22] university that's the devil that's king
[1:15:26] are we together
[1:15:28] god says this mic is good period
[1:15:30] oh this mic is bad period he's got no
[1:15:34] time for analysis critically evaluated
[1:15:36] no
[1:15:37] he's got that time for those things the
[1:15:39] devil has got time for
[1:15:41] compare and contrast
[1:15:43] ah that's the university language
[1:15:46] please apply your mind on this
[1:15:49] apply my what
[1:15:50] in the word of god apply my mind i
[1:15:53] believe it
[1:15:54] and say it
[1:15:57] and uh
[1:15:59] and the lie that you can tell how i've
[1:16:01] heard men bypass pieces of the scripture
[1:16:04] just to keep from it has their theology
[1:16:08] you see
[1:16:09] see but if if if this part is right that
[1:16:13] part's right let's put it together and
[1:16:15] make it fit through the whole bible now
[1:16:18] in the beginning when god you see then
[1:16:20] he continues
[1:16:22] to point where a minister ministering in
[1:16:24] front of the believers when he finds
[1:16:26] that oh that basis he's him
[1:16:28] oh i just i just i just
[1:16:31] passed there quickly
[1:16:34] because the bible is saying to me hey
[1:16:36] pratham paul here
[1:16:38] speak it loud then i say okay let's rush
[1:16:41] you need to finish now
[1:16:43] huh
[1:16:44] because it's not fitting with my with
[1:16:45] what i don't want to take correction
[1:16:47] from the lord
[1:16:48] that's the problem let's go down again
[1:16:52] i'll read for you some more golden
[1:16:53] nuggets
[1:16:55] from god in his people now the gift
[1:16:58] doesn't heal no one all right
[1:17:00] the gift doesn't heal no one a gift
[1:17:03] the gift is not for healing
[1:17:06] the gift is not for healing no more than
[1:17:09] a gospel preacher is sent for saving
[1:17:12] he can't save anyone he can preach under
[1:17:15] the power to bring people to a knowledge
[1:17:17] of the way of the of the word of god and
[1:17:20] come to their and and
[1:17:22] the word of god
[1:17:23] and come do
[1:17:25] their confessing and god does the saving
[1:17:29] is that right
[1:17:31] that's the same thing isn't it
[1:17:33] he he's got a sign
[1:17:36] god is the only one i preach the gospel
[1:17:38] people come to the point of confession
[1:17:40] yeah
[1:17:41] i can't save you i can't heal you
[1:17:45] the gift is there but what is the
[1:17:47] purpose of a gift if you never come to a
[1:17:50] point of confessing your healing right
[1:17:53] happy you need to confirm isn't it
[1:17:55] you need to confess and say ah what you
[1:17:57] are saying is true
[1:17:59] right yes the
[1:18:01] problem when he was asking the people
[1:18:03] when he was praying for them he was
[1:18:05] praying for them and he says
[1:18:07] this this this about your life is it
[1:18:09] true sister do you believe the lord
[1:18:11] jesus christ you need to to be part of
[1:18:14] the confession
[1:18:15] you must confirm and say yes i believe
[1:18:18] yes it's true
[1:18:20] because words of confession when they
[1:18:22] are said from the hand are powerful they
[1:18:24] make miracles they make they activate
[1:18:27] the sign they activate the gift
[1:18:30] the gift can't work alone
[1:18:32] are we together
[1:18:34] let's go down a little bit we just we
[1:18:35] just relax isn't it
[1:18:38] and they have done pretty near
[1:18:41] but they can't that's that's as far as
[1:18:44] they can go but now you come to the lord
[1:18:47] jesus to heal you but come confessing
[1:18:50] your faith in him
[1:18:52] come confessing my brother come but come
[1:18:56] confess it come confessing to the lord
[1:18:59] because the minister whoever can do
[1:19:01] nothing even us we can pray pray pray
[1:19:06] for my brother of course we must pray
[1:19:08] but all we are doing i i if you for the
[1:19:11] revelation i can even pray for you
[1:19:14] when i'm praying that god help my sister
[1:19:16] or my brother to confess
[1:19:18] your weight
[1:19:19] help her to confess lord that's what you
[1:19:22] know the bible says we must be wise
[1:19:25] to be wise
[1:19:27] is to be it's not to be clever
[1:19:29] you know to be clever that they say this
[1:19:31] is a clever child it's good to beat
[1:19:33] level ribbon isn't it but we must also
[1:19:35] be wise
[1:19:37] the bible says you must be wise
[1:19:39] and
[1:19:41] a wise person it's not the person who
[1:19:44] always wants to win
[1:19:45] all right no no is there a person who is
[1:19:48] oriented towards the solution
[1:19:50] right now you see that there's a
[1:19:53] situation here
[1:19:55] that you are struggling with
[1:19:57] and then this situation you can't seem
[1:19:59] to overcome it
[1:20:01] right
[1:20:02] but now
[1:20:03] uh at the same time you don't you don't
[1:20:05] seem to to be praying for that situation
[1:20:09] and you're not investigating and asking
[1:20:11] the lord why am i not coming to a point
[1:20:14] of praying for this situation i mean why
[1:20:16] do i not come to the point of praying
[1:20:18] for this problem that i have so that my
[1:20:21] situation can go and the devil can make
[1:20:23] a long list of you without you realizing
[1:20:26] that
[1:20:28] wait
[1:20:29] i am i've got a situation i'm not
[1:20:32] praying about it and i don't know why
[1:20:34] i'm not praying about it but i'm not
[1:20:36] praying about why i'm not praying about
[1:20:38] it
[1:20:40] huh
[1:20:41] you need to be wise
[1:20:43] if there's a the lord said ask anything
[1:20:46] yeah if you've got a situation and you
[1:20:49] can't overcome it and you find that ah
[1:20:52] but
[1:20:52] it's a problem for me but i'm not
[1:20:54] praying about it
[1:20:55] okay why can't you pray for this not
[1:20:57] praying about it
[1:20:59] pray for this not praying about it to go
[1:21:01] so that you can pray for this situation
[1:21:04] to go
[1:21:05] isn't it so the devil wants to to to to
[1:21:07] entangle you in some misunderstanding
[1:21:10] and you find that you just say i don't
[1:21:12] know what's the pro you know yes
[1:21:14] you know that the problem is that this
[1:21:16] situation won
[1:21:18] and you are not giving enough time to
[1:21:20] pray for it
[1:21:22] why are you not giving enough problems i
[1:21:24] mean time to pray for this what you need
[1:21:26] to be doing you do is to ask lord help
[1:21:29] me to be able to come to my knees
[1:21:32] because i am not coming to my knees and
[1:21:34] that disturbs me
[1:21:36] getting rid of that situation because
[1:21:38] how can god help you if you don't
[1:21:39] confess
[1:21:44] let's move on a bit
[1:21:45] pray for the problem of the problem
[1:21:48] and the problem of the problems problem
[1:21:50] so that can all go right if you are not
[1:21:53] being able to play
[1:21:56] surely
[1:21:58] one of your concerns
[1:21:59] should be why am i not praying what is
[1:22:02] causing me not to pray
[1:22:06] and you pray for that thing
[1:22:08] to go
[1:22:09] and there might be an ape and
[1:22:11] what do you call an enabler to that
[1:22:13] thing that is causing you not to play
[1:22:15] you you know when you kill an amalekite
[1:22:18] is it an
[1:22:19] amalekite
[1:22:20] you don't kill just the elders yes
[1:22:24] the whole
[1:22:25] you need to cut
[1:22:27] and
[1:22:29] that's the problem of aiken
[1:22:30] that's what he did
[1:22:32] he didn't have bad revelation that
[1:22:34] a problem of a problem can become a
[1:22:36] problem
[1:22:38] and another that doesn't make it that
[1:22:40] this problem linked to this one it
[1:22:42] actually affects the whole picture like
[1:22:44] brother andy says we must always know
[1:22:46] the bigger picture
[1:22:47] what is the bigger picture
[1:22:50] and what is causing the bigger picture
[1:22:51] not to work there are some so many
[1:22:53] things that are linked to many things
[1:22:54] too many things and the devil made you
[1:22:56] get lost in those single them out yes
[1:23:00] out out out
[1:23:02] they must all die their children and
[1:23:05] their grandchildren and their
[1:23:07] great-grandchildren and their relatives
[1:23:09] and and
[1:23:10] their friends if possible
[1:23:13] they must all die
[1:23:15] of the lord
[1:23:16] there was no amount of sympathy
[1:23:20] that the prophet of god was going to say
[1:23:22] don't kill them
[1:23:24] who was that man
[1:23:26] who said akin who was who was the pro
[1:23:27] the man of god at that time bible reader
[1:23:30] joshua
[1:23:31] there was no amount of sympathy that was
[1:23:34] going to be given to aiken and his
[1:23:37] family no
[1:23:39] because this is life and death
[1:23:42] the problem of a problem must be
[1:23:44] identified
[1:23:46] and i say okay this is my problem
[1:23:48] i've got temper
[1:23:51] all right all right
[1:23:53] that's the problem clear one amalekite
[1:23:58] okay can i get rid of this timber no it
[1:24:01] has been bothering me for three four
[1:24:02] years
[1:24:04] that's the problem he doesn't want to
[1:24:05] die what is causing this chamber not to
[1:24:07] die
[1:24:08] oh i find that oh lord i i like being
[1:24:11] upset and temperament
[1:24:13] nah that's another
[1:24:16] i love it
[1:24:18] one side
[1:24:20] you're going to kill them one by one
[1:24:22] lord before we even talk talk of temper
[1:24:25] i found that i like it a lot sure
[1:24:29] okay why do you like it
[1:24:33] you see the grandchild is coming
[1:24:35] now
[1:24:37] everything from them must die
[1:24:41] the grandchildren everything otherwise
[1:24:44] we become bacons
[1:24:46] pray for the problem of the problems
[1:24:48] problem in their older cousins
[1:24:51] let's go down my brother
[1:24:56] sarah you see
[1:24:59] sarah
[1:25:00] made a confession in her heart yeah
[1:25:03] by laughing
[1:25:06] and out of bed she created another
[1:25:08] amalekite by saying i did not laugh
[1:25:12] you see you see how confession how
[1:25:15] confession becomes
[1:25:18] uh we say oh sister you laugh why are
[1:25:21] you laughing
[1:25:22] he said no no i did not
[1:25:27] okay let's say sarah maybe did not know
[1:25:30] didn't have the revelation that that's
[1:25:31] that's malik he said visiting abraham
[1:25:34] but why why
[1:25:36] if our sarah maybe i would have said ah
[1:25:39] i don't know i was i was just amazed
[1:25:42] and that could also be a lie
[1:25:45] because i laughed so sarah loved and
[1:25:48] when and the lord says
[1:25:50] why why why did you say you know what
[1:25:53] always amazes me is the lord brother
[1:25:54] daniel
[1:25:55] did not ask him
[1:25:59] the bible says and he turned to abraham
[1:26:01] and said why did sarah laugh
[1:26:03] i always i asked myself why why didn't
[1:26:06] the lord say sarah why are you laughing
[1:26:08] the lord instead said to abraham why is
[1:26:10] sarah lovey
[1:26:11] i wonder what abraham said
[1:26:14] and sarah
[1:26:16] he's the one who said no i didn't love
[1:26:18] okay let's read the story therefore
[1:26:19] sarah loved within herself within
[1:26:21] herself
[1:26:23] from there
[1:26:25] she laughed
[1:26:26] after
[1:26:27] i am worked old shall i have a pleasure
[1:26:30] my lord being oh she knew that's not
[1:26:32] that that's not the law
[1:26:34] being
[1:26:35] all
[1:26:36] old also and the lord said unto abraham
[1:26:39] wherefore this sarah
[1:26:41] saying shall i do shall i of a surely
[1:26:44] bear a child which i'm old
[1:26:47] is anything too hard for the lord is
[1:26:50] there anything to have for the lord
[1:26:52] bring them all amen all of them
[1:26:56] identify them one day
[1:26:59] the pastor gave us a task i don't know
[1:27:01] who is still doing it
[1:27:04] he said do you have a paper
[1:27:07] and a pen
[1:27:09] and write
[1:27:10] write them your knees
[1:27:13] because the devil
[1:27:15] you see the devil is like this you know
[1:27:17] the parable of a sower
[1:27:20] about this is where the soil went out
[1:27:22] and so
[1:27:23] some fell
[1:27:25] on the good ground sun fell
[1:27:27] on the background on the
[1:27:29] wheaty ground they fell everywhere some
[1:27:32] of the wisdom the devils some of them
[1:27:34] they fell on the good ground but the
[1:27:36] base came and picked them up that the
[1:27:38] devil is that dead
[1:27:40] when the word of god goes out he's got a
[1:27:42] thing of wanting to pick it up while
[1:27:44] he's still fresh
[1:27:46] and you find that you can't even tell us
[1:27:48] what was the pastor preaching about two
[1:27:50] weeks ago
[1:27:52] why
[1:27:53] he first removed the affection brother
[1:27:55] andy the interest he removed that thing
[1:27:57] and he said if you find that you've got
[1:27:59] no interest
[1:28:01] you've got no affection to the word of
[1:28:03] god but you've got affection to mr
[1:28:05] youtube
[1:28:08] then that's that's another item for you
[1:28:10] to be praying for
[1:28:12] isn't it pray for your fingers not to
[1:28:15] touch there don't come now
[1:28:18] preach it because it's an amalek height
[1:28:21] if i find that her
[1:28:24] if we just analyze everybody and then we
[1:28:26] come sunday morning brother ben we we
[1:28:28] put the screen there
[1:28:30] we are now connecting connects that we
[1:28:32] start with the pasta we connect we
[1:28:33] analyze you now
[1:28:35] we see the amount of time you spend on
[1:28:37] the word
[1:28:39] now we are going to see things
[1:28:41] on the screen there yeah that's the
[1:28:43] analysis the word of god is doing you
[1:28:45] don't have to plug anyone on the screen
[1:28:47] the word of god just displays it in your
[1:28:48] heart allow the screen of the lord to
[1:28:51] show
[1:28:51] allow it don't plug it
[1:28:54] allow the screen analysis of the lord to
[1:28:57] show that yes lord but don't don't be
[1:29:00] careful
[1:29:01] be with the lord yes right because the
[1:29:04] daniel has got the tendency of lynching
[1:29:06] in there when you and the lord are
[1:29:08] communing the devil can do so that's why
[1:29:10] when we pray
[1:29:11] we invite the lord
[1:29:13] we don't just start off by praying and
[1:29:15] just shoot
[1:29:17] this in order yes that the spirit puts
[1:29:21] for you to pray
[1:29:22] you see
[1:29:23] to a point where the lord said to them
[1:29:25] when you pray dude say you say they say
[1:29:27] you said when you pray the lord put the
[1:29:30] lord's prayer
[1:29:31] not necessarily our father who had in
[1:29:33] heaven
[1:29:34] no no the lord's prayer of your of you
[1:29:36] for that day the lord puts it and the
[1:29:38] spirit prays through you
[1:29:40] that's when you are able to know that
[1:29:42] you praise the lord and tell him how big
[1:29:44] he is and praise him and worship him and
[1:29:46] never forget to say lord forgive me and
[1:29:49] never forget to say lord as i'm starting
[1:29:51] to pray come now
[1:29:53] because i by myself i can't talk that's
[1:29:55] right
[1:29:56] that's the order isn't it
[1:29:57] now you just start by saying oh lord and
[1:29:59] i want them to say this lord like
[1:30:00] brother andy
[1:30:03] i never even told the lord how big he is
[1:30:05] but i already won the message
[1:30:08] i never told the lord that i am sorry
[1:30:11] lord during the day i shouted at my
[1:30:13] daughter
[1:30:14] i never said that
[1:30:16] i never went to my daughter to say you
[1:30:18] know what please before i go to pray
[1:30:21] can you forgive me i didn't speak to you
[1:30:23] well i never even went there but i
[1:30:25] already said lord i want to pay rise
[1:30:28] please father you are my god
[1:30:31] i want pay rise
[1:30:32] for my work is that how to ask the lord
[1:30:37] god wants to be recognized
[1:30:39] that he is god because he is god glory
[1:30:42] right yeah i may be deviating let's go
[1:30:45] down here a little bit sarah laughed
[1:30:47] that was part of her confession
[1:30:49] and she did not want to to agree yeah
[1:30:52] you see
[1:30:54] god the bible says and i'm finishing god
[1:30:58] at the beginning
[1:31:00] think about john john 1 huh think about
[1:31:02] john 1 that we read
[1:31:04] god at the beginning
[1:31:06] was his weight
[1:31:09] he confessed himself
[1:31:11] right
[1:31:12] and then things came to pass now you
[1:31:15] and your confession are one
[1:31:18] you become your confession
[1:31:20] what do you say
[1:31:22] what you breathe what do you water what
[1:31:25] you put menu on every day
[1:31:28] you become thing
[1:31:32] what you say
[1:31:33] water from your mouth meaningfully not
[1:31:36] meaningfully
[1:31:38] from your heart meaningfully not
[1:31:40] meaningfully but you are busy watering
[1:31:42] it
[1:31:43] every day lord make me aware when people
[1:31:46] are motoring the wrong thing lord make
[1:31:48] me aware my father that i'm watering a
[1:31:50] wrong thing i'm not aware lord the devil
[1:31:52] wants to take advantage of me watering
[1:31:55] something wrong and away lord expose it
[1:31:59] so that lord it can go away i can water
[1:32:01] the right thing every day
[1:32:04] what am i confessing every day right
[1:32:07] because you and your confession becomes
[1:32:10] one you are your weight god was his
[1:32:12] weight the bible says in the beginning
[1:32:15] was the word and the word was god was
[1:32:17] with god and the word was
[1:32:20] there was no contradiction what was in
[1:32:22] his mind he spoke it out and it happened
[1:32:24] exactly that way right
[1:32:27] now
[1:32:28] but they mean
[1:32:30] oh sorry i wrote here that you see some
[1:32:32] some people
[1:32:33] some of us
[1:32:35] the devil put this a weak point where
[1:32:38] what we say is not
[1:32:40] what we mean
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:43] you know
[1:32:44] you know politicians
[1:32:46] i'll speak low
[1:32:48] but they mustn't hear us
[1:32:51] that's a good example
[1:32:55] of
[1:32:56] wrong confessions
[1:32:58] that's why they never they never
[1:33:00] they say something else but they do
[1:33:02] something else or they say something
[1:33:04] else meaning something else
[1:33:07] that's the nature of politics that's why
[1:33:09] the prophet said he said it is rotten
[1:33:13] politics i don't advise you to be a
[1:33:14] counselor or or go to beehive no no
[1:33:16] don't do that
[1:33:18] i don't advise you to get a career in
[1:33:19] there because the prophet that it is
[1:33:21] rotten politics
[1:33:23] it's written children don't want to
[1:33:25] become a politician
[1:33:28] no it's a wrong
[1:33:29] trend
[1:33:31] not wrong in the sense that it does not
[1:33:33] help us but the moment you land in there
[1:33:37] how is the holy ghost going to operate
[1:33:40] if if you are operating on a rotten
[1:33:41] thing
[1:33:42] the prophet said is rotten so as
[1:33:44] believers we don't encourage our
[1:33:46] children to go and be i want my child to
[1:33:48] be a minister a behind
[1:33:51] a minister
[1:33:53] happen to be a minister
[1:33:55] you must first join a political party
[1:33:57] to be a political party you must buy and
[1:34:00] confess into their philosophy
[1:34:03] and confess and buy in into their
[1:34:05] printer principles which you don't know
[1:34:07] where they come from who started them
[1:34:08] when you've got your own principles here
[1:34:10] when you you have already confessed in
[1:34:13] these principles and these principles
[1:34:15] are contradicting to those principles no
[1:34:18] no don't be ministers
[1:34:20] be ministers of the way
[1:34:23] we want them to be ministers of the way
[1:34:25] let them be engineers still better
[1:34:28] pilots let them be
[1:34:30] those are approved
[1:34:33] let them go and feed the tires and they
[1:34:35] do and let them be rather but
[1:34:38] don't i wouldn't advise children
[1:34:42] to be politicians
[1:34:44] even you adults
[1:34:46] don't walk where they are at
[1:34:50] run away
[1:34:52] in other ways
[1:34:53] don't get the spirit of politics
[1:34:55] yeah
[1:34:56] yeah it comes in different forms and
[1:34:58] shapes
[1:35:01] this thing is the one that makes me to
[1:35:03] speak about politicians
[1:35:05] of saying something that you don't mean
[1:35:08] so we need to be conscious
[1:35:10] to your confession
[1:35:12] be alert led
[1:35:13] be aware
[1:35:16] look at it and be aware what are you
[1:35:18] saying the bible says be sober
[1:35:22] right
[1:35:24] now let's go down a bit
[1:35:27] now perhaps
[1:35:28] eighty percent or ninety percent of the
[1:35:30] audience tonight will be christians well
[1:35:33] then if you got in your mind that you
[1:35:35] wasn't a christian any longer and you
[1:35:37] will quit confessing that
[1:35:39] that's what was
[1:35:41] that you you was a christian you got
[1:35:44] dropped out
[1:35:45] out of the picture
[1:35:47] because that's what you're confessing
[1:35:48] you keep on you believe it you confess
[1:35:51] it that you are not and you will be not
[1:35:55] is your right
[1:35:57] hebrews 3 1
[1:35:58] he is the high priest of your confession
[1:36:02] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:36:04] he's interceding for us in other words
[1:36:07] he's making intercessions upon our
[1:36:09] confession
[1:36:10] i like it when
[1:36:11] when the prophet says what we are
[1:36:13] confessing that he is that that's what
[1:36:16] he's confessing that we are
[1:36:19] you see
[1:36:20] when we confess
[1:36:22] things
[1:36:22] about him he is confessing through the
[1:36:25] intercession that we are
[1:36:27] he's an intercessor
[1:36:29] he's well you're confessing the truthful
[1:36:32] thing his word he is also confessing
[1:36:35] before the father about you
[1:36:37] so it closes the whole loop the lord is
[1:36:40] not quite the intercession it means that
[1:36:42] you say lord forgive me father i love
[1:36:45] you lord before the father says father
[1:36:47] he loves you
[1:36:49] oh lord forgive him i don't even see
[1:36:51] take his sin i i died for him he's my
[1:36:53] daughter he's my son what you are
[1:36:55] confessing
[1:36:57] not not not not not wrong things
[1:37:00] confessing them from your heart
[1:37:04] not about your sister or your brother or
[1:37:06] about the situation
[1:37:08] complaining and murmuring about it
[1:37:10] god said
[1:37:12] these guys they must die
[1:37:14] they are murmuring and i don't like a
[1:37:16] murmuring heart
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:20] he wants me and you to confess the
[1:37:22] weight
[1:37:24] the more we confess the word he is
[1:37:26] confessing the word upon us through his
[1:37:28] intercession then we become
[1:37:30] we can sweat we become his weight right
[1:37:35] making intercept making intercession on
[1:37:38] our behalf i'm sure the prophet wanted
[1:37:39] to say that let's go down and finish up
[1:37:41] with that one brother ben
[1:37:44] now now notice oh yeah we found read
[1:37:47] that one eh but that's from a different
[1:37:48] meaning i mean
[1:37:50] it's just an addition it's just you know
[1:37:52] you know you know
[1:37:54] when you put bread and butter
[1:37:56] you put bread in butter then you just
[1:37:57] put peanut butter on top that's the
[1:37:59] peanut
[1:38:02] so
[1:38:03] that's that's the topic man
[1:38:05] he is the high priest of your confession
[1:38:08] you get what i mean
[1:38:10] do you get it he is
[1:38:12] amen therefore what i'm confessing you
[1:38:15] must know what you must ask yourself
[1:38:17] what is the lord going to be confessing
[1:38:20] before the father about me
[1:38:22] therefore is very critical
[1:38:24] that what i confess
[1:38:26] should be in line with the way
[1:38:27] what i'm saying what i'm asking because
[1:38:29] here on the other side the intercessor
[1:38:32] the high priest of our confession
[1:38:34] standing before the father to intercede
[1:38:36] for me and for you
[1:38:38] he's saying things
[1:38:39] what must he say
[1:38:43] what must he say
[1:38:45] because you are saying if you are saying
[1:38:46] a wrong confession don't say wrong
[1:38:48] confession
[1:38:49] from your heart
[1:38:51] from your mind from your mouth say the
[1:38:53] right one yes
[1:38:54] say the right ways eh likes to hit you
[1:38:56] right
[1:38:58] any man will never leave anybody okay
[1:39:01] what am i saying here you get what i
[1:39:03] mean what you confess you are that's
[1:39:06] what you are
[1:39:08] i didn't put it in bold brothers and
[1:39:10] sisters any man will never live any
[1:39:12] further or any higher than what he
[1:39:15] believes he is living
[1:39:20] if you want to live too shallow you
[1:39:22] become shallow yeah
[1:39:24] if you want to live in christ jesus in
[1:39:26] heavenly places you become
[1:39:28] you don't worry about the noise of the
[1:39:30] squirrels here and this and that no
[1:39:34] that's
[1:39:35] wrong confession
[1:39:36] heavenly places
[1:39:38] yes the sister do this to you you draw a
[1:39:42] big circle she cuts you out of the
[1:39:45] second you draw a bigger one
[1:39:48] love her more
[1:39:49] love your brother and your sister more
[1:39:52] unconditional
[1:39:54] that's the confession of a believer when
[1:39:56] you confess that
[1:39:58] that's how that's why confession is so
[1:40:00] important
[1:40:01] let's go down my brother and finish off
[1:40:03] here i'm gonna just give you a little
[1:40:05] exercise you know i love teaching i
[1:40:08] should have been a teacher
[1:40:09] here i'll give you a little exercise
[1:40:11] i've got given you example then you're
[1:40:13] going to say other examples you see
[1:40:15] confession must be supported by action
[1:40:20] you'll see now i'm gonna read for you
[1:40:22] supported i mean supported by an action
[1:40:24] i cannot confess that oh my lord my
[1:40:27] savior you healed you healed me
[1:40:29] and then i says oh
[1:40:31] yeah you hit me lord
[1:40:33] i must stand up hey man you know what
[1:40:35] the prophet did one time
[1:40:37] he ate that food he tried to come up he
[1:40:40] pushed it back
[1:40:41] glory
[1:40:42] that's how faith works that's how action
[1:40:45] of your confession works
[1:40:47] that's right
[1:40:48] don't wait for the angels to come
[1:40:50] they're coming
[1:40:52] you act
[1:40:53] on your confession you found the right
[1:40:55] part of the lord you are you you find
[1:40:57] everything is in place all your dogs are
[1:40:59] in a row
[1:41:00] now it's time for you to act upon your
[1:41:02] confession
[1:41:04] david actions you know them
[1:41:07] he went and picked up the stones he
[1:41:09] actually confessed first he said you i'm
[1:41:11] going to cut your head you today
[1:41:15] right now
[1:41:17] they said what is this boy
[1:41:20] he says
[1:41:24] you can translate
[1:41:25] [Laughter]
[1:41:27] david he made a confession and then he
[1:41:30] made an action
[1:41:32] abraham
[1:41:34] who in their right mind
[1:41:36] you see the confession our confession
[1:41:38] according to the word of god is not in
[1:41:40] the right mind according to the world
[1:41:42] it's in our right heavenly
[1:41:44] mind because you know that the bible
[1:41:48] says brother ben that god's mind
[1:41:51] is completely opposite from this earthly
[1:41:54] mind just like the east is from the west
[1:41:57] hebrew the baby that's what the bible
[1:41:59] says
[1:42:00] so we work according to the mind of
[1:42:04] amen
[1:42:05] that is why we can believe that this man
[1:42:08] and this woman can have a child at 90
[1:42:11] years old another
[1:42:12] 100. moses
[1:42:15] he confessed and that happened
[1:42:18] the egyptians that you see you shall see
[1:42:20] them no more amen
[1:42:23] there was a point where moses made a
[1:42:25] little mistake and instead of speaking
[1:42:28] confessing he cried yeah
[1:42:30] god said why you cry
[1:42:33] confess
[1:42:36] don't cry
[1:42:38] fast speak
[1:42:41] and you must believe it amen
[1:42:43] remember it goes with you you mustn't
[1:42:45] just say it i want you to get this it's
[1:42:48] not just about confessing it only
[1:42:50] no no it must be believed
[1:42:52] i must say from here believing it and i
[1:42:55] confess it
[1:42:56] speak to the sea
[1:42:58] don't cry i mean to the rock what was he
[1:43:01] crying for
[1:43:03] moses he was crying god said no moses
[1:43:06] until the prophet made it a title of
[1:43:08] samuel why cry speak
[1:43:12] but some of us it looks like sometimes
[1:43:13] we say why speak cry
[1:43:16] you mustn't do that no no no no no we
[1:43:18] must not cry speak
[1:43:22] wisdom
[1:43:24] this man confessed he said never give up
[1:43:27] never give up no you see
[1:43:29] but what kind of mentalities bring the
[1:43:31] mentality of victory
[1:43:34] if you never give up it means even if
[1:43:35] your your food get chopped never give up
[1:43:40] there's a song that we sing big in
[1:43:41] africa
[1:43:42] we say please never
[1:43:45] never give up
[1:43:48] amen oh please never
[1:43:50] never give we'll sing it after here i'll
[1:43:53] sing it for you
[1:43:55] winston churchill said that that was a
[1:43:57] word of confession
[1:44:00] he didn't see himself defeated
[1:44:03] he said never give up never give up
[1:44:05] never give up if you never give up what
[1:44:07] do you do
[1:44:08] you never give up
[1:44:09] you go forward you win
[1:44:11] no no no cut my head if possible i'm not
[1:44:14] gonna give up amen
[1:44:18] one day another lady i used to work with
[1:44:20] is a bad example
[1:44:22] she said
[1:44:23] you know
[1:44:24] me if my husband catches me doing
[1:44:26] something wrong
[1:44:27] even if he saw me i'll until the night
[1:44:30] can you hear this person believes in
[1:44:32] what they say they say they what they
[1:44:35] say they mean it i'll still refuse
[1:44:37] all right
[1:44:39] so what prevents us from being from
[1:44:41] being believers to say to the devil
[1:44:42] never the devil i told you one time that
[1:44:44] even if the devil tells you the truth
[1:44:46] tell him you are still alive
[1:44:48] never believe the truth from the devil
[1:44:50] never
[1:44:51] tell him you are still a liar otherwise
[1:44:53] you make him god all right
[1:44:55] you make the devil a true speaker if the
[1:44:58] devil says you are beautiful say you're
[1:45:00] lying
[1:45:01] only god can tell me i'm beautiful
[1:45:05] if he says you you are beautiful
[1:45:08] you say devil
[1:45:09] get thee behind me
[1:45:11] yes
[1:45:12] it is written only here only my god not
[1:45:14] you
[1:45:15] i don't even entertain that statement oh
[1:45:17] you're hi what's your name oh you're
[1:45:19] beautiful
[1:45:20] i'm what come now
[1:45:23] i'm coaching the angels now
[1:45:27] don't take it rebecca
[1:45:29] i'm not beautiful in your approach
[1:45:32] my dad my mom
[1:45:34] my god will tell me i'm pretty don't
[1:45:36] tell me i'm pretty
[1:45:38] amen come down that's true
[1:45:41] if you're a sister and you go to work
[1:45:42] and then another man says oh today you
[1:45:45] are beautiful say no no my husband
[1:45:46] already told me amen
[1:45:49] thank you
[1:45:50] my husband already
[1:45:51] [Laughter]
[1:45:54] and smile
[1:45:54] [Laughter]
[1:45:56] oh you're handsome you're handsome as a
[1:45:58] brother and you take compliments like
[1:45:59] that
[1:46:00] confessions from from jester bells
[1:46:03] oh brother oh
[1:46:04] today
[1:46:05] today what
[1:46:08] my wife already told me
[1:46:15] let's close up with this one
[1:46:19] am i finished
[1:46:22] i can't believe that
[1:46:24] why is confession so important and i
[1:46:26] think that's our closing paragraph
[1:46:29] you see
[1:46:31] confession is so important because we
[1:46:33] see the outcomes
[1:46:35] of confession
[1:46:36] when we see the outcomes of confession
[1:46:38] that's when we realized that oh it's so
[1:46:40] important either the good ones or the
[1:46:42] bad ones
[1:46:43] you see
[1:46:46] when i grew up
[1:46:48] with unbelievers in a rural village they
[1:46:51] they used to tell us that you know if
[1:46:53] you say something to someone one
[1:46:54] millennial in other words you are what
[1:46:58] can you help me laugh
[1:47:00] you know what when you say oh brother
[1:47:02] man you know
[1:47:04] you just say something wrong to brother
[1:47:06] all the time like not in a bad way but
[1:47:08] yourself
[1:47:09] negative big negative perception and i
[1:47:11] keep on reiterating to you i'm actually
[1:47:13] predicting nothing upon you
[1:47:16] and it will happen because i'm making
[1:47:18] you to believe that
[1:47:20] and i keep on saying that and i keep on
[1:47:22] saying that you must shut me and say no
[1:47:24] brother correct me
[1:47:26] cut that thing off because it's a wrong
[1:47:28] confession
[1:47:29] any people who say that until your child
[1:47:32] believes in that until they become like
[1:47:34] that
[1:47:35] you keep on confessing them that they
[1:47:37] are useless when they are not
[1:47:40] tell them they are useful when they do a
[1:47:42] stupid thing say you are clever
[1:47:44] and give them a weeping while you are
[1:47:46] telling them that
[1:47:48] level that one don't ever preserve it
[1:47:51] the bible said so
[1:47:53] the pastor can vouch for me
[1:47:55] if you don't want to whip your children
[1:47:58] with love you are not fulfilling the
[1:48:00] scripture
[1:48:02] with love you see with an attitude that
[1:48:04] is godly
[1:48:06] you can't confess anger on your children
[1:48:08] no confess love my boy how does it feel
[1:48:13] i won't do it again if you
[1:48:15] don't do it okay
[1:48:17] come touch your toes
[1:48:18] you see but you must do it with love
[1:48:23] right
[1:48:24] you become what you confess
[1:48:26] you and your testimony becomes one i'm
[1:48:28] just summarizing i wanted to give you a
[1:48:30] task but the time is finished i wanted
[1:48:32] you to tell me the examples of the
[1:48:34] actions that were given as a result of
[1:48:36] the testimony you know they they they
[1:48:39] they're there you've got plenty of them
[1:48:40] they're supposed to be on our on the
[1:48:42] tips of our tongue the previous part
[1:48:44] that we're looking at i gave you for
[1:48:46] example and i was i was about to say
[1:48:48] another action
[1:48:50] can you give me an action that joshua
[1:48:51] who made and who confessed with an
[1:48:54] action in the bible
[1:48:56] anyone just was still thinking brother
[1:48:58] daniel who
[1:49:11] joshua
[1:49:12] who else brother production
[1:49:17] aiken he can confess a wrong thing but
[1:49:20] what he did came to pass because they
[1:49:22] told him that they killed them good
[1:49:25] example you see that's why when the word
[1:49:27] preaches we don't only show you the good
[1:49:29] side we saw the dangerous part of wrong
[1:49:31] confession
[1:49:36] noah
[1:49:43] sorry i'm just putting everyone on the
[1:49:44] spot but
[1:49:46] you know
[1:49:47] those we've got a cloud of witnesses
[1:49:51] who confessed
[1:49:52] and it came to pass
[1:49:54] right
[1:49:55] let's go down so we'll do that exercise
[1:49:57] next time when we say you you you you
[1:50:00] they just come out right let's go down
[1:50:03] further i think this is the last stanza
[1:50:06] your wealth becomes a living
[1:50:08] high priest is to make intercession upon
[1:50:10] we already pass professions and
[1:50:12] confessions is the same translation
[1:50:14] that's what i was trying to tell at the
[1:50:15] beginning that's what the prophet and
[1:50:17] there is there he is sitting at the
[1:50:19] right hand of the father making
[1:50:21] intercessions upon our confessions
[1:50:25] he's not just making intercessions he's
[1:50:27] making intercessions upon what we
[1:50:29] confess
[1:50:30] how can the lord be making intercessions
[1:50:32] on what we are not saying right
[1:50:35] we are not praying we are not asking we
[1:50:37] are not doing anything
[1:50:39] but we want the lord to intercede
[1:50:40] because the lord must intercede what we
[1:50:41] are saying
[1:50:43] our lives that we are giving the lord is
[1:50:44] interesting saying no lord they are
[1:50:46] justified they are just can you hear
[1:50:48] them lord
[1:50:48] you see
[1:50:50] now he cannot heal you he cannot save
[1:50:53] you and do it and do one thing for you
[1:50:56] until first you accept it and believe it
[1:50:59] and confess it
[1:51:03] that's the truth my brother
[1:51:05] you need to come to a point where
[1:51:07] it's not just confessing accepting it
[1:51:10] believing it confessing it the least
[1:51:12] goes on and on
[1:51:15] but confession is what we are focusing
[1:51:16] on tonight because there's power in
[1:51:18] there that's right you've got to confess
[1:51:22] it
[1:51:23] no not you got to feel it
[1:51:26] you you got to confess it
[1:51:28] he's not the high priest of your
[1:51:30] feelings
[1:51:31] he's not the high priest of your he's
[1:51:33] the high priest of your confession
[1:51:35] that's right
[1:51:36] what you confess
[1:51:39] you can finish up the missing way what
[1:51:41] you confess
[1:51:43] you can finish you know that when it's
[1:51:44] primary school they say feel in the
[1:51:46] missing way there
[1:51:49] i become what i confess anyone can say
[1:51:52] anything there
[1:51:53] right
[1:51:54] i want us to stop there tonight but i
[1:51:56] wanted i wanted to go a bit slow
[1:51:58] so that it can sink in about this aspect
[1:52:02] this teaching of the power of your
[1:52:05] confession
[1:52:07] right and understanding that confession
[1:52:10] it means
[1:52:12] that's what i'll become
[1:52:14] that's what i'll get that's what the
[1:52:16] lord says about me before the throne of
[1:52:18] god so many things around the world the
[1:52:21] confession part right and we saw at the
[1:52:23] meaning of confession
[1:52:25] it's got a lot to do with what you say
[1:52:30] you know if you want some some
[1:52:32] connection we can take each one to the
[1:52:34] doctor to have a pipe directly from the
[1:52:36] heart to the mouth
[1:52:38] so that what you know
[1:52:40] a direct connection from the heart
[1:52:45] and the lord is doing the same
[1:52:46] confessing about me and about you what
[1:52:49] we are confessing to him
[1:52:51] that's what their relationship is all
[1:52:52] about we confess things to one another
[1:52:56] i never had a man and a woman who always
[1:52:58] confess things that way but they're
[1:53:00] still together stuck together you see
[1:53:01] mike and men they're confessing to each
[1:53:03] other sorry to use you
[1:53:06] isn't it beautiful
[1:53:07] they confess things to one another which
[1:53:09] we may not even understand
[1:53:11] you see because there's love there's a
[1:53:13] relationship there oh you know what no
[1:53:16] no your room is going to be that way
[1:53:18] oh no this this you see they confess
[1:53:20] things to one another that's what us and
[1:53:22] a lord jesus christ
[1:53:24] do it's about us and christ everything
[1:53:28] that you see here on earth is about us
[1:53:30] and
[1:53:31] christ therefore you play a very pivotal
[1:53:35] pivotal part
[1:53:37] not even in the economy of this world in
[1:53:39] the economy of heaven
[1:53:41] bigger scheme of things
[1:53:44] are we together brethren
[1:53:46] can we clap hands for the
[1:53:48] [Applause]
