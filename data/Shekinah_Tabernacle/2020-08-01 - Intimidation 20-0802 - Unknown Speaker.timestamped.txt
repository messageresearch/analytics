[32:27] god bless you everybody it's awesome to
[32:30] be here
[32:32] um i like that you know how the lord has
[32:35] done so much for us i've been over the
[32:36] last
[32:37] two weeks spending um every day with
[32:40] a girl that's the same age as rebecca
[32:42] and andy was good friends with her
[32:44] husband
[32:44] um glenn and we prayed for them at their
[32:47] pre-meeting two weeks ago glenn emily
[32:48] and maya
[32:50] and um emily and i have spoken about the
[32:52] lord every day pretty much for the last
[32:53] two weeks
[32:54] and she has she was buddhist and
[32:57] she has come to belord and she's yeah
[33:00] she's just having so many questions and
[33:02] so excited
[33:03] about the reality of what's happening in
[33:05] her life over the last little while
[33:08] and it's just really awesome because
[33:10] when you share your testimony like
[33:11] and you just didn't actually testimonies
[33:13] you share testimonies of people and you
[33:15] realize
[33:16] what the lord's really done for you how
[33:18] much has
[33:20] changed you from what you were changing
[33:22] you know all the things
[33:23] baptism and just everything that's
[33:24] happened you realize
[33:26] wow the lord is so good
[33:29] so good how could we do this life
[33:31] without him you know but it's such a joy
[33:33] that um i was thinking of a song
[33:37] and google knew nothing about it i
[33:39] couldn't find it anyway and then i just
[33:41] realized this morning it's because it
[33:42] was written here in the fellowship
[33:45] so um i don't know do you know savior's
[33:47] grace
[33:48] maybe isaac would you be able to help
[33:50] with the guitar is it all right if
[33:52] everybody that knows it sings it with me
[33:54] i think it's such a beautiful song and
[33:56] yeah google i couldn't find it anywhere
[33:58] so i'd love it if we all sing it
[34:04] i don't know if we sing it very often
[34:05] maybe we haven't sung it for a couple of
[34:06] years
[34:09] um just
[34:12] it was just um when i was thinking about
[34:13] my testimony and i thought well that's
[34:15] really been my testimony and then
[34:17] just looking forward to him taking us
[34:18] one day to be with him by his throne
[34:21] that's awesome but yeah if everyone
[34:24] could sing that'd be awesome

[39:14] i just don't like the weather and i just
[39:16] don't like the place
[39:17] and well here we are um
[39:22] so you know the lord's timing is always
[39:25] perfect
[39:26] you know we may not always understand
[39:28] what he does but we just have to always
[39:30] just trust his will
[39:32] um when we decided to move down here it
[39:36] was
[39:36] at a time where nobody really thought of
[39:39] moving it was during the
[39:41] recovered and we thought
[39:44] okay we should move down to wellington
[39:47] and um
[39:48] and when we decided and we started
[39:50] praying about it
[39:52] um it was just absolutely incredible to
[39:55] me
[39:55] how the lord opened every single
[39:58] door um it was just a matter of
[40:02] weeks and we were down here
[40:05] um someone asked me when did you guys
[40:08] decided to move and when i said
[40:10] just a couple of weeks ago it was it was
[40:13] actually so funny but
[40:14] um i just want to give give god all the
[40:17] glory
[40:18] um and a special thanks to everyone here
[40:22] in the fellowship for welcoming us and

[50:19] my um i
[50:20] didn't wake up in time to to get to work
[50:22] when i wanted to
[50:24] and um on the way to work i was a bit
[50:26] disappointed because i've been listening
[50:28] to a message it was about an hour's trip
[50:30] and i prayed to god my phone would turn
[50:31] on it turned on i was like that's real
[50:33] strange and it
[50:34] said zero percent like it was dead it
[50:36] had turned on i had turned off and it
[50:38] wouldn't turn back on because i already
[50:39] tried
[50:40] and then for 10 minutes i was listening
[50:41] to a william branham assuming saying
[50:48] how if you're sick or you need healing
[50:52] there's a way and the elders of the
[50:53] church will pray for you and you'll get
[50:55] better
[50:56] and then my phone died like pretty much
[50:58] right after that it just died and i was
[50:59] like man it's so strange and then i came
[51:00] to church that night and then
[51:02] brother and paul said you know the owls
[51:03] are here to be prayed for
[51:05] i just want to thank god you know he's
[51:06] so present in our lives he hung on the
[51:08] cross and took the 40 lashes
[51:10] for our healing and like everything we
[51:13] ask for
[51:14] is ours we just have to believe in faith
[51:16] i just want to thank god for
[51:18] healing me and for taking us out of this
[51:20] world
[51:22] [Music]
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:24] [Music]
[51:33] as you all know i've started a new job a
[51:36] few weeks ago
[51:38] so the last week was my first week where
[51:42] i worked two days from home
[51:43] and three days in the office so monday
[51:46] and tuesday i was working from home
[51:49] wednesday morning when i'm supposed to
[51:50] wake up to go to work
[51:53] i couldn't get up i was very sick i
[51:56] couldn't walk
[51:58] and then i'm thinking you've just
[52:00] started a new job
[52:03] it's your first week doing at two days
[52:06] work from home
[52:08] and the day you're supposed to go into
[52:09] the office you're going to call in
[52:12] off sick it's not going to happen i got
[52:15] off the bed i tried walking around i
[52:17] realized it's not going to work
[52:19] i said to my husband i'm very sick
[52:22] i need you to pray i didn't even think
[52:26] that painkillers exist
[52:27] at that point in time then
[52:31] he prayed for me and i started preparing
[52:34] myself
[52:35] i still could not but i just started
[52:36] thanking the lord for healing me
[52:39] then towards the end of my preparation
[52:41] i'm thinking
[52:44] i was sick i couldn't walk i even forgot
[52:48] that there was pain and
[52:52] i got to the train i was still fine
[52:54] during the day my husband is even asking
[52:55] me
[52:56] i know you said you're fine how are you
[52:58] i'm like
[52:59] there is nothing not a trace of pain
[53:01] nothing
[53:02] then i was just so encouraged that the
[53:04] lord will honor your prayer
[53:07] just pray and give him thanks and then
[53:09] he'll do the rest
[53:12] god
[53:21] i also thought i must just give god all
[53:24] the glory and the honor
[53:26] for he has been so he has done so much
[53:30] for me amen
[53:32] for me
[53:35] i would like to say that everything that
[53:36] happens in our lives
[53:38] has got spiritual implications amen
[53:42] so whether it's about food on the table
[53:46] whether it's about the clothes you're
[53:48] wearing for a child of god
[53:51] it must have a spiritual meaning if you
[53:54] can't find it
[53:55] it means you must give glory and honor
[53:56] to the lord that's for me what it means
[53:59] amen
[54:00] so i just want to thank god for about
[54:05] just over
[54:08] what one and a half years now that we
[54:10] came here
[54:12] and i realized today that for me it was
[54:15] not about immigration or
[54:18] coming to study or anything like that it
[54:21] was that the lord wanted us to be here
[54:22] at this point in time
[54:26] and i just want to thank him thank you
[54:28] for your prayers and for your love
[54:30] i i passed my course that i was doing
[54:36] and
[54:39] so uh on wednesday or was it tuesday
[54:43] um i was sitting down with brother phil
[54:45] and
[54:46] and my family and just my wife just
[54:49] checked the email and i found the
[54:50] results for the last course
[54:52] for my on my research paper that was
[54:54] remaining
[54:56] so on thursday so i just want to thank
[54:58] god for for that and also for me
[55:01] that is goddess must have some spiritual
[55:03] implication
[55:04] it must bring glory and honor to the
[55:06] lord otherwise why must i have it
[55:08] why must i have it if you can bring
[55:10] glory and honor to god
[55:11] otherwise i don't want it so if it can
[55:15] bring glory and honor to god i want it
[55:17] so and i just want to thank you for your
[55:19] love and for your prayers
[55:21] and let's continue to soldier on then if
[55:24] you have time brother indy we can sing
[55:26] that song if you have time
[55:32] amen
[55:35] so i just want to thank the lord because
[55:37] i was afraid
[55:38] like last week i wasn't feeling very
[55:41] good like
[55:42] i had like i was i had a bad cold
[55:45] and i went up for prayer and brother ben
[55:47] prayed for me with oil
[55:49] and now i'm fine
[55:53] [Applause]
[55:58] we serve a supernatural god amen
[56:04] god bless you since i just wanted to say
[56:06] thank you to the lord
[56:07] today for adding 16 and a half years
[56:10] more to my life i remember
[56:12] laying there in a hospital bleeding
[56:16] lots of just finding my life ebbing away
[56:20] with rebecca and today i think about it
[56:23] and just want to give all praise and
[56:25] glory and honor to god
[56:26] and also just thanking him that those 16
[56:29] and a half years were better than the
[56:30] former years
[56:31] and i just want to praise god
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:42] [Music]
[56:43] um i'm i'm thanking the lord for
[56:47] i know you guys over the years have um
[56:49] often prayed for my middle daughter
[56:52] and i've you know her and i have had a
[56:55] rocky relationship
[56:56] in the last over 10 years i guess and
[57:01] she's going through a process now and i
[57:03] know that god's working on her life
[57:04] and she's she's told me she loves me
[57:09] and she's stopped blaming she's
[57:14] she stopped blaming me for everything
[57:17] and she's
[57:19] she she wants to talk to me now and
[57:23] so we're going down next week we're
[57:25] going to be in the
[57:27] south island we're going to be with her
[57:28] for about 10 days so
[57:30] it'll be really nice to be able to um

[57:37] to her as well
[57:40] and i'm thank you all for praying so
[57:43] much for
[57:52] her
[57:54] [Music]
[58:07] this water on my finger and um it really
[58:09] annoyed me that's
[58:10] um annoyed me at school but then um
[58:14] when we kept on praying for it but then
[58:17] um
[58:18] one day we were at someone's house and
[58:20] then a little bit
[58:21] fell off and then um i i'm put in the
[58:23] rubbish but then
[58:25] um when we're at church cleaning um that
[58:27] day um the same day it fell off more of
[58:30] it
[58:30] and um now it's off and you can't even
[58:33] see a mark of it on my
[58:37] [Applause]
[58:43] hey man i get to stand in the back a
[58:46] terrible week just just a busy week it's
[58:49] like
[58:50] the closer we get to to going home the
[58:52] more the devil wants to throw upon us
[58:55] you know just to keep us more busier
[58:57] and i found myself focusing at the wrong
[59:00] things
[59:01] but see so many people said it today
[59:04] it's a simple prayer to go lord and
[59:06] sincere to say
[59:08] re-calibrate me so that i can see you
[59:11] and everything
[59:12] because you start losing the focus you
[59:14] start not seeing god and everything you
[59:16] just see
[59:18] situations and problems and things
[59:20] happening but you don't see god in it
[59:22] and it was an honest prayer i was
[59:24] driving home and i just had enough i
[59:25] said lord just please recalibrate me to
[59:28] see you everywhere
[59:30] and it's like a flick of a switch and i
[59:31] can see him in everything
[59:33] i can every type is there natural type
[59:35] of spiritual we were working in the
[59:37] garden yesterday and it just keep coming
[59:39] up and
[59:39] the moment you get out there in god's
[59:41] nature you can see him everywhere
[59:44] so i encourage you if you can't see him
[59:46] right now ask him
[59:48] that you want to see him everywhere and
[59:50] he'll show you
[59:51] exactly where he is because he's in
[59:53] everything he's
[59:54] everywhere so praise the lord i'm glad
[59:56] that he
[59:57] re recalibrated me amen
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:08] i also want to add them to my dad's one
[1:00:10] yesterday
[1:00:11] and my dad set a fire because he um we
[1:00:14] had this
[1:00:15] we have this wood just lying next to the
[1:00:17] shed um
[1:00:18] so he wanted to make a fire and burn it
[1:00:20] in this um
[1:00:22] big uh bad light little barrel and then
[1:00:25] um we're doing the flex so we pulled it
[1:00:28] out
[1:00:28] and um satan's like the flex if
[1:00:32] he keeps on trying to fight um the fire
[1:00:35] but the fire keeps on burning him
[1:00:37] and then he just can't get um to burn
[1:00:40] he just can't get the fire and then if
[1:00:42] um the fire's going
[1:00:44] um did like air blows on it then it just
[1:00:46] goes
[1:00:47] and burns the fire and then burns the
[1:00:49] flax away and it's gone
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:02] i don't i don't know um i don't know
[1:01:05] what the lord's doing but
[1:01:07] there's just something inside me that's
[1:01:08] just bubbling
[1:01:10] and and i and i sat here thinking but
[1:01:13] lord i've already given my testimony
[1:01:15] but the lord wants me to say these words
[1:01:17] and i don't know whether it's for me or
[1:01:19] whether it's for someone else here
[1:01:21] but i kept putting it down and putting
[1:01:22] it down and then i the lord brought my
[1:01:24] remembrance to what brother alman said
[1:01:26] the other night and then the next thing
[1:01:28] he gave his testimony and i thought lord
[1:01:30] he didn't listen that night but i'm
[1:01:32] going to he said to us the other night
[1:01:34] that
[1:01:35] he was in church and and christine was
[1:01:37] giving a testimony and the lord put it
[1:01:38] on his heart to say something and he
[1:01:40] didn't say it
[1:01:42] and the lord made me remember this and
[1:01:44] the lord said to me now but i want you
[1:01:46] to say these words and i said no but
[1:01:48] i've already given my testimonies
[1:01:49] reminded me again
[1:01:51] do it so i'm going to do it okay i don't
[1:01:53] know whether this is for me or this for
[1:01:55] someone here but the lord wants
[1:01:57] me to say these words this is what i
[1:01:59] have prayed for
[1:02:01] so i don't know whether it's what i've
[1:02:03] prayed for
[1:02:04] being here today whether it's for
[1:02:06] someone else to hear it but he wants me
[1:02:08] to say those words
[1:02:09] this is what i have prayed for and i
[1:02:12] just want to
[1:02:13] just give him that
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:36] god bless you brothers and sisters um
[1:02:39] you know me i'm not a talker and um
[1:02:45] i really don't did not want to sit here
[1:02:47] and be talking in front of you all
[1:02:49] but i also have something to say
[1:02:54] um and this is just a little word of
[1:02:58] encouragement
[1:02:59] to you my brothers and sisters
[1:03:02] lately i've been going through
[1:03:06] you know spiritually a really really
[1:03:08] rough time
[1:03:09] you know when you just you wake up and
[1:03:11] you feel like you're not a christian
[1:03:12] anymore
[1:03:14] or you just don't feel like serving the
[1:03:15] lord
[1:03:17] and you're in a spot where you feel
[1:03:20] obligated to but
[1:03:22] the love is gone
[1:03:25] that is that it's one depressing spot to
[1:03:27] be in
[1:03:29] when you don't you you know when the
[1:03:31] enemy tells you that you don't want to
[1:03:33] do it
[1:03:35] but you know i was listening to brother
[1:03:37] bam the other day and there was one
[1:03:39] thing he said he said
[1:03:41] um you must die to yourself
[1:03:45] and he said he said when you
[1:03:48] when you die to yourself right it's not
[1:03:51] about you fighting
[1:03:52] it's hard to die but just die
[1:03:58] like that chore it's like that chore
[1:03:59] your parents give you
[1:04:02] and you don't feel like doing it but the
[1:04:04] best way to get it done is to do it
[1:04:08] so i just want to say when you don't
[1:04:11] feel like taking that next step when you
[1:04:14] don't
[1:04:15] feel like doing anything the best remedy
[1:04:17] for that you know
[1:04:18] is to do precisely that because that is
[1:04:21] when the enemy
[1:04:22] is that's when he's fighting he knows
[1:04:25] you're about to
[1:04:26] make that move he knows the next thing
[1:04:28] you're gonna do
[1:04:31] is gonna be detrimental to his kingdom
[1:04:33] so when you don't feel like doing it
[1:04:36] that's the time to do it
[1:04:39] that's all i wanted to say thank you
[1:04:41] very much
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:05:06] testimony i feel like at the same
[1:05:09] i looks like i'm a christian but some on
[1:05:12] the other hand i feel like
[1:05:17] i'm not good enough i just beat myself
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:26] god is so good i mean he encouraged me
[1:05:29] to get up early in the morning
[1:05:31] a little bit family altar like that
[1:05:37] i feel
[1:05:41] something inside of my heart
[1:05:45] i'm not good enough
[1:05:48] i feel this courage i feel
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:58] i can go further
[1:06:02] with the work and family and this life
[1:06:09] but this morning when i
[1:06:12] opened the bible
[1:06:17] romance chapter 12
[1:06:21] he said and be not conformed
[1:06:24] to this word
[1:06:29] but be transformed about
[1:06:39] acceptable and perfect
[1:06:43] and we don't care
[1:06:47] god knows everything but i'm concerned
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:55] if god never leaves me forcing me
[1:06:58] i
[1:07:04] that time i just keep going
[1:07:08] no matter what i'm going through praise
[1:07:11] all thank you
[1:07:15] [Applause]
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] god bless you all um a few weeks ago
[1:07:30] i was sitting doing my work at school
[1:07:32] and my friend asked me
[1:07:34] um because he was talking with this
[1:07:36] other dyslexic kid
[1:07:38] and they asked me if you're not a
[1:07:40] christian you can steal right and i said
[1:07:44] no because in the ten commandments it
[1:07:45] says thou shalt not steal
[1:07:48] it doesn't say if you're not a christian
[1:07:50] then you can steal whatever
[1:07:52] you can't steal it's it that's period
[1:07:55] and then i start
[1:07:56] and then he started asking questions
[1:07:58] about the bible and then i
[1:08:00] then we ended up talking about um
[1:08:04] father son and holy ghost and i said
[1:08:08] your father is jesus so
[1:08:11] all three of them is one your father is
[1:08:13] jesus
[1:08:14] the son of god is jesus the holy ghost
[1:08:18] is jesus they're all the same things and
[1:08:20] he started
[1:08:22] and it like it looked as if he had it
[1:08:25] was a
[1:08:26] answer to something he's been a question
[1:08:29] he's been
[1:08:30] had on his heart the whole time so um
[1:08:33] i praise god for that
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:48] i wish you all bye
[1:08:52] you know sometimes i just been sharing
[1:08:54] with the import about irritations
[1:08:57] and transforming irritations for
[1:08:59] perfection
[1:09:01] and brother brandon was talking about
[1:09:03] that pearl
[1:09:05] and um brought to my remembrance
[1:09:08] about 30 years ago i was a pearl diver
[1:09:10] up in west australia
[1:09:12] and how is the pearl formed it's formed
[1:09:15] by an irritation
[1:09:17] but when the pearl is formed
[1:09:20] there's beauty in that pearl and today
[1:09:23] i've just heard a lot of beautiful
[1:09:25] pearls come
[1:09:26] forth from the congregation
[1:09:29] and my added to this is in the
[1:09:35] cockpit 19 we were ready to fly up to
[1:09:38] uh northland we were standing for the
[1:09:40] andy and sister
[1:09:42] and we had to cancel that until another
[1:09:46] time
[1:09:46] and then we canceled again and then they
[1:09:49] says
[1:09:50] everything can go into credit so we had
[1:09:52] this
[1:09:53] almost six hundred dollars in credit on
[1:09:54] the flight
[1:09:56] and we decided that we'll go up since
[1:09:59] around about
[1:10:00] october october before october september
[1:10:04] august we kept looking at the flights my
[1:10:06] wife spent a good
[1:10:08] three or four hours looking around and
[1:10:11] then eventually we prayed about it and
[1:10:12] it all fell into place
[1:10:15] and we had to look at flights getting to
[1:10:18] the airport
[1:10:20] getting up to caretaker or offering to
[1:10:22] territory
[1:10:23] where we're going to stay what's going
[1:10:25] to happen and what is the objective and
[1:10:27] what was the purpose of us going up
[1:10:28] there
[1:10:29] god's always got in this program he's
[1:10:32] got that sorted for us
[1:10:34] i mean so then after a while
[1:10:38] we managed to get all the flights we got
[1:10:40] our credit rating back
[1:10:43] we got extra put back on it instead of
[1:10:45] costing 400 and something dollars to go
[1:10:47] to cherokee
[1:10:49] and back it only cost us 300 and
[1:10:51] something
[1:10:52] but you know you had to go persistently
[1:10:55] you had to be
[1:10:56] persistent about the things that you
[1:10:58] want to do if you have
[1:11:00] and god says you have a vision and we
[1:11:03] all have a vision we know what it is
[1:11:05] it's about saving souls amen
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:09] so in all this time now it came down to
[1:11:12] the timing of the flights the
[1:11:15] accommodation
[1:11:17] and the time accommodation and now we
[1:11:19] just needed a vehicle
[1:11:21] so we looked at vehicles and they closed
[1:11:24] it down in september the high companies
[1:11:26] for vehicles
[1:11:28] so here our prices were starting to rise
[1:11:30] up again
[1:11:31] and then i remembered a brother up there
[1:11:34] in christ
[1:11:35] not in the message but someone i met
[1:11:38] he used to fly planes and teaches planes
[1:11:42] and all that and i met him in
[1:11:43] uncircumstances they were not good
[1:11:46] favorable for him but he ended up coming
[1:11:47] to church
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:50] and from there he's
[1:11:53] been out in the world so he's now been
[1:11:56] touched by the
[1:11:57] amount of fellowship we've had over the
[1:11:59] last 15 years
[1:12:01] with this gentleman and his wife
[1:12:04] and eventually he told me that he used
[1:12:06] to preach when he was young
[1:12:08] on a soapbox in the streets of auckland
[1:12:11] and now he's in his 50 pluses
[1:12:15] and i'm looking at this gentleman and
[1:12:16] i'm saying
[1:12:18] you preached yes and he could rattle off
[1:12:20] what he was saying so he doesn't give
[1:12:22] much
[1:12:23] now he's he's he's a big tall maori
[1:12:26] fellow as well
[1:12:27] and he owns his own plane and so he's
[1:12:29] got everything comfortable
[1:12:30] he owns all his houses in auckland so
[1:12:34] what he was doing was a bit like paul
[1:12:38] he wanted to operate under his own
[1:12:40] esteem
[1:12:41] as a pharisee of pharisees and this is
[1:12:44] still the same spirit to today
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:47] but what got under his skin was
[1:12:49] irritation that we didn't preach to him
[1:12:51] around my wife
[1:12:52] we invited him to our home we took care
[1:12:55] of him
[1:12:56] we never ever preached him just
[1:13:00] last time we're up we went to get our
[1:13:02] all our stuff to move down here
[1:13:04] and you're right sister wellington of
[1:13:06] all places
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:09] but we got down here we got up there
[1:13:11] sorry
[1:13:12] and we invited him for dinner before we
[1:13:14] left
[1:13:15] and we told him we were moving down here
[1:13:17] by faith
[1:13:18] and like unto moses moving out of ur we
[1:13:21] continue to move on
[1:13:22] until we ourselves can separate and drop
[1:13:25] our own lots
[1:13:26] so we have lots to drop he then said to
[1:13:30] me
[1:13:30] he could see christ in us and then
[1:13:34] he was wanting to even further do
[1:13:36] something more about it like
[1:13:38] what's your bank account number so
[1:13:42] because we rely on the lord for these
[1:13:44] things
[1:13:45] but anyway whilst this is coming on now
[1:13:47] i contacted him
[1:13:49] and he was saying i just prayed for you
[1:13:52] guys this morning
[1:13:54] now the substance is why are you praying
[1:13:57] for us
[1:13:58] and he says because we're on the road
[1:14:00] we're in a podium
[1:14:01] now paddy key is where we were a couple
[1:14:03] of weeks ago from my sister's funeral
[1:14:06] so then we spoke about it and he's
[1:14:08] coming on the way down to auckland
[1:14:11] and from oakland is coming all the way
[1:14:13] down to wellington
[1:14:14] so now this is this is where it's the
[1:14:17] oddball is
[1:14:19] i said to him listen when are you back
[1:14:21] up in northland
[1:14:22] he says around about this time i said we
[1:14:24] will be there
[1:14:25] because he said to us you promised that
[1:14:27] you'll come up it says now that you've
[1:14:29] come
[1:14:29] down we promise we'll come up so we
[1:14:32] booked our tickets
[1:14:34] but we need a vehicle i said even a push
[1:14:36] bike will do
[1:14:38] and my wife says how about a horse
[1:14:41] so he says how about i give you a horse
[1:14:43] and a buggy
[1:14:44] so therefore our vehicle has been
[1:14:47] supplied
[1:14:49] so the lord knows what's upon our heart
[1:14:51] he may go around a long way
[1:14:54] right but he knows what's upon our heart
[1:14:57] and he knows that there's healing
[1:14:58] in the wings of the dove so that was
[1:15:02] what's happening so he's coming down
[1:15:04] here they are actually moving around now
[1:15:07] this is amazing what god does this
[1:15:10] gentleman
[1:15:12] decided that he would get his own camper
[1:15:15] van
[1:15:16] he'll travel out throughout new zealand
[1:15:18] he'll book himself into motels
[1:15:21] he'll pay his own way and he'll come and
[1:15:23] preach the gospel
[1:15:24] on the soapbox again so the stirring up
[1:15:29] of this was when we're up there and i
[1:15:31] says to him
[1:15:32] that we're about to leave and come down
[1:15:34] and i said about brother branham
[1:15:36] he said oh yeah i've read brother so
[1:15:39] 15 years and he didn't talk about
[1:15:42] brother branham
[1:15:44] and now he says he's read brother
[1:15:45] branham so he's now
[1:15:47] starting to get more conversation about
[1:15:50] the lord
[1:15:51] this conversation so he's coming down
[1:15:53] here
[1:15:56] with that one party political
[1:16:00] the one party which is the christian
[1:16:02] movement they're starting up again
[1:16:05] but god supplied him with a campervan
[1:16:07] with all the food
[1:16:08] all the money with all the accommodation
[1:16:10] and he's saying
[1:16:12] this is him so he'll be down here
[1:16:14] sometime soon
[1:16:16] in a couple of weeks so what they're
[1:16:18] doing as the group
[1:16:20] is going out and talking about christ to
[1:16:22] the people
[1:16:23] so i thought well if i go and see your
[1:16:26] party you can come and see our party
[1:16:29] so i just pray that he'll be able to
[1:16:31] come here and
[1:16:32] bring the group of them here and get a
[1:16:35] real
[1:16:35] party happening so that's my prayer
[1:16:39] god bless you all
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:52] god bless you just very quickly for just
[1:16:55] to say sister henna
[1:16:56] i had the same scripture this morning
[1:16:58] romans 12
[1:17:00] and i think it's the lord just
[1:17:02] confirming his word about the gifts as
[1:17:04] well
[1:17:05] that we've been hearing about and not to
[1:17:08] be conformed to this world
[1:17:10] but to be renewed in him you know by the
[1:17:13] renewing of
[1:17:14] of of our minds and the holy spirit does
[1:17:17] these things
[1:17:18] he leads us to perfection and fills us
[1:17:21] with his word and
[1:17:22] yeah i always think about the gifts we
[1:17:24] don't have to fear about it the lord
[1:17:26] leads us all the way on he gives us what
[1:17:28] we need
[1:17:30] and i just want to thank him for that
[1:17:33] for the revelation that he's given us
[1:17:35] each and every one of us
[1:17:37] praise the lord
[1:17:48] good morning saints i've been sitting at
[1:17:50] the back wondering should i shouldn't i
[1:17:52] should i
[1:17:54] and testimonies kept on going so
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:58] i've had lately it's been it's been
[1:18:01] quite a struggle in myself
[1:18:05] there's so many things that's that's
[1:18:07] going on so many things
[1:18:10] i want to do but the lord just kept on
[1:18:13] telling me and and and the one thing
[1:18:16] that came to me is
[1:18:17] is the lord given me
[1:18:22] is of a story about mary and martha
[1:18:27] and where martha
[1:18:31] was so worried
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:36] but martha was cumbered about much
[1:18:39] serving and came to him and said lord
[1:18:41] dost thou not care that my sister left
[1:18:43] me to serve alone
[1:18:45] but her therefore that she helped me and
[1:18:48] jesus answered and said unto her mother
[1:18:50] martha thou art careful and troubled
[1:18:52] about many things
[1:18:54] but one thing is needful and mary hath
[1:18:57] chosen that good part which shall not be
[1:18:59] taken
[1:19:00] away from her and that is something that
[1:19:02] la rora has given me as well as
[1:19:05] search first my kingdom make sure that
[1:19:09] you and me are right and everything else
[1:19:12] will
[1:19:13] will be added onto it everything else
[1:19:15] will fall apart everything that you try
[1:19:16] to do
[1:19:17] everything will come to naught if you
[1:19:19] try it in your own way
[1:19:21] but if you make sure that you and the
[1:19:24] lord are
[1:19:26] he's your bridegroom and that is
[1:19:28] something that just to sit
[1:19:30] and be at his feet and not to worry
[1:19:32] about and run around and and wanting to
[1:19:34] do
[1:19:35] so many things but to sit at his feet
[1:19:37] and make sure that
[1:19:39] that is right then everything else will
[1:19:41] will be added onto it so praise the lord
[1:19:43] for that
[1:19:48] amen
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:20:01] um also i've had all this time i've had
[1:20:05] bad dreams
[1:20:06] on the nights and i keep on jumping on
[1:20:08] my mum and dad's bed
[1:20:10] and i'll be constant like every night
[1:20:13] and i'll jump in my dad's bed like every
[1:20:16] night
[1:20:16] and now it's been like it's been better
[1:20:19] because
[1:20:20] um i haven't had so much dreams and if i
[1:20:22] do wake up i kind of
[1:20:23] can't go to sleep but literally
[1:20:25] sometimes like
[1:20:27] only sometimes and i'm really thankful
[1:20:30] for
[1:20:31] um not giving me bad dreams i've prayed
[1:20:33] for a lot
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:56] so i think it was two or three weeks ago
[1:21:01] um i was sleeping and i had a really bad
[1:21:04] dream
[1:21:05] and i couldn't wake up and so in my
[1:21:08] dream
[1:21:08] i just sat down because like
[1:21:12] we were trapped in this house and there
[1:21:14] was demons all around and we could not
[1:21:16] get out
[1:21:17] so i just sat down and realized this is
[1:21:19] a dream
[1:21:20] and the devil is trying to trap me in
[1:21:22] this dream so i can be scared
[1:21:24] of him and just said satan you
[1:21:28] are not my boss you are not my lord
[1:21:32] the lord is the ruler over me i just
[1:21:34] prayed in that dream and cast the devil
[1:21:36] out
[1:21:37] and a few seconds after that i woke up
[1:21:39] and it was time to go to school
[1:21:44] amen resist the devil when you're awake
[1:21:49] and resist them when you're asleep
[1:21:50] amen hallelujah
[1:21:54] amen praise the lord i've got one
[1:21:56] testimony just short
[1:21:58] and i thought it might that affects us
[1:22:00] all you know amen and
[1:22:01] i really um you know uh have a burden
[1:22:05] for everybody and every
[1:22:06] you know and you know you you when
[1:22:09] you're close to people you have a burden
[1:22:10] for people
[1:22:11] right and we were praying and we as we
[1:22:14] do and
[1:22:15] we were having a prayer meeting at home
[1:22:16] one night at about 10 45
[1:22:18] p.m and really praying through
[1:22:22] and pray through some real you know some
[1:22:24] gritty things
[1:22:25] and really just the lord just
[1:22:28] came into the room and shook the whole
[1:22:31] house
[1:22:32] literally the house went
[1:22:36] and we were i felt like i jumped out of
[1:22:38] myself
[1:22:39] like wow it was such a fright such a
[1:22:41] powerful thing
[1:22:44] and then we can we kept praying though
[1:22:46] we just kept praying
[1:22:48] we prayed and then brahman prayed and
[1:22:50] then after the prayer brahman
[1:22:52] she said that was not a coincidence
[1:22:55] there was something there's something
[1:22:57] spiritual about this earthquake
[1:22:59] so we went on to the earthquake geonet
[1:23:03] and the epicenter of the earthquake was
[1:23:05] on our hill
[1:23:07] and it went and we were praying for the
[1:23:10] whole
[1:23:10] church and we're praying for the vision
[1:23:13] and everything you know and
[1:23:14] and you know the lord just came and
[1:23:17] shook the earth

[1:30:11] now this is the the assyrians
[1:30:14] trying to make israel break hezekiah
[1:30:16] break here
[1:30:18] then uh rabbish rabb
[1:30:21] sheka stood and cried with a loud voice
[1:30:24] in the
[1:30:24] jews language this is upon jerusalem and
[1:30:27] said hear ye the words of the great king
[1:30:29] the king of assyria
[1:30:30] thus saith the king let not hezekiah
[1:30:33] deceive you
[1:30:34] for he shall not be able to deliver you
[1:30:37] neither let hezekiah make you trust in
[1:30:39] the lord
[1:30:40] saying the lord will surely deliver us
[1:30:43] this city
[1:30:44] shall not be delivered into the um not
[1:30:47] be
[1:30:47] delivered to the hands of the king of
[1:30:49] assyria
[1:30:51] hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith
[1:30:54] the king of assyria make an agreement
[1:30:56] with
[1:30:56] me by present and come out to me and eat
[1:30:59] ye
[1:31:00] every one of his vine and every one of
[1:31:02] his victory
[1:31:03] and drink ye uh every one of the waters
[1:31:06] of his own cistern
[1:31:07] until i come and take you away to a land
[1:31:09] like your own land
[1:31:11] a land of corn and wine and a land of
[1:31:13] bread and vineyards beware
[1:31:16] lest hezekiah persuade you saying the
[1:31:18] lord will deliver us
[1:31:20] hath any of the gods of the nations
[1:31:22] delivered his land
[1:31:24] out of the hand of the king of assyria
[1:31:27] were where are the gods of hamath
[1:31:31] and uh arfad uh where are the gods
[1:31:34] of uh sip havian and have they
[1:31:38] delivered samaria out of my hand who
[1:31:41] are they among all the gods of these
[1:31:43] lands that have delivered their land out
[1:31:45] of my hand that the lord
[1:31:47] should deliver jerusalem out of my hand
[1:31:50] but they held their peace and answered
[1:31:52] him not a word for the king's
[1:31:54] commandment was saying
[1:31:56] answer him not then came elekim
[1:32:00] the son of hilkiah that was over the
[1:32:03] household and
[1:32:04] um shebna the scribe and joa uh the son
[1:32:08] of of asif the recorder to hezekiah with
[1:32:11] their clothes rent and they told him
[1:32:14] the words of rap sheker
[1:32:17] however you pronounce that and we go
[1:32:19] down to uh verse 37
[1:32:21] uh i mean chapter 37 verse one and it
[1:32:23] came to pass when
[1:32:24] king hezekiah heard it that he rent his
[1:32:26] clothes
[1:32:27] and covered himself with sackcloth and
[1:32:29] went into the house of the lord see he
[1:32:31] knew where his strength came from
[1:32:33] and he sent elekim who was over the
[1:32:35] household and
[1:32:36] shebna the scribe and the elders of the
[1:32:38] priests covered with
[1:32:40] sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the
[1:32:42] son
[1:32:43] of amos and they said unto him
[1:32:47] thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of
[1:32:49] trouble
[1:32:50] and of rebuke and a blasphemy for the
[1:32:53] children
[1:32:54] i come to the birth and there is not
[1:32:56] strength to bring forth
[1:32:58] it may be that the lord thy god will
[1:33:00] hear the words of raphaekya
[1:33:02] whom the king of assyria his master has
[1:33:04] sent to reproach the living god
[1:33:07] and will reproach the words which the
[1:33:09] lord thy god hath heard
[1:33:11] wherefore lift up thy prayer for the
[1:33:13] remnant that is left
[1:33:15] so the servants of king hezekiah came to
[1:33:18] isaiah
[1:33:19] and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye
[1:33:21] say unto your master thus saith the lord
[1:33:24] be not afraid of the words that thou has
[1:33:26] heard
[1:33:27] wherewith the servants of the king of
[1:33:29] assyria have blasphemed
[1:33:30] me behold i'll send a blast upon him and
[1:33:33] he shall
[1:33:34] hear a rumor and return to his own land
[1:33:37] and i
[1:33:37] will cause him to fall by the sword in
[1:33:41] his own land amen let's just bow he's in
[1:33:44] a word of prayer if you ever need you

[1:35:10] standing too long i want to go to acts
[1:35:12] chapter 3 and just just read
[1:35:15] a portion of scripture here then we'll
[1:35:16] go into what i'd like to speak about
[1:35:19] this morning so
[1:35:20] now peter and john went up together into
[1:35:23] the temple
[1:35:24] at the hour of prayer being the ninth
[1:35:26] hour now i i just
[1:35:28] trust this ties together and a certain
[1:35:30] lame man from his mother's womb was
[1:35:32] carried whom they laid daily at the gate
[1:35:34] of the temple
[1:35:35] which was called beautiful to ask arms
[1:35:37] of them that entered into the temple
[1:35:39] who's seeing peter and john about to go
[1:35:41] into the temple asked
[1:35:42] and and arms and peter fastened his eyes
[1:35:45] upon him with john
[1:35:47] and said look on us and he gave heed
[1:35:51] unto them expecting to receive
[1:35:52] something of them then peter said silver
[1:35:55] and gold have i known but such as i have
[1:35:57] give i thee
[1:35:58] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:36:00] rise up and walk and he took him by the
[1:36:02] right hand and lifted him up
[1:36:03] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:36:05] received strength
[1:36:07] and he leaping stood up and walking and
[1:36:10] entered with them into the temple
[1:36:11] walking and leaping
[1:36:12] and praising god and it came to pass
[1:36:16] on the morrow that they're rulers sorry
[1:36:18] we're just jumping
[1:36:19] so i'm just jumping down to to chapter
[1:36:21] four here
[1:36:22] so this guy's been there for a long time
[1:36:25] and not everyone's happy about it and
[1:36:28] now here comes the devil
[1:36:30] and they have you know you know you know
[1:36:31] they you know they're all rejoicing and
[1:36:33] there's a great stir going on in the
[1:36:35] temple and you know the chief priests
[1:36:36] and things send the send their soldiers
[1:36:38] and
[1:36:38] what more to basically go arrest them
[1:36:40] and now and now we've kind of skipped
[1:36:42] the night and here we are
[1:36:43] the next day in front of their council
[1:36:45] and it came to pass on the murder that
[1:36:47] they're rulers and elders and scribes
[1:36:49] and anias the high priest and caiaphas
[1:36:51] and john
[1:36:52] and alexander and as many as were of the
[1:36:54] kindred of the high priest were gathered
[1:36:56] together at jerusalem
[1:36:57] and when they had set them in the midst
[1:36:59] who was that
[1:37:00] the man who was healed and the and the
[1:37:02] disciples they asked by what power or by
[1:37:04] what name have you done this
[1:37:06] amen and then peter filled with the holy
[1:37:10] ghost said unto them ye rulers of the
[1:37:11] people and elders of jerusalem
[1:37:13] if we this day be examined of the good
[1:37:15] deed done to the impotent man
[1:37:17] by what means he is made whole be it not
[1:37:20] be it known unto you
[1:37:21] all and to all the people of israel that
[1:37:24] by the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:37:26] whom you crucified whom god raised from
[1:37:28] the dead even by him does this man stand
[1:37:31] before you
[1:37:32] whole this is the stone
[1:37:36] this is the stone which was set at
[1:37:37] naught of you builders
[1:37:39] which has become the head of the corner
[1:37:41] neither is there salvation in any other
[1:37:43] for there is none other name under
[1:37:45] heaven given among men whereby
[1:37:47] we must be saved now when they saw the
[1:37:49] boldness of peter and john they
[1:37:51] perceived that they were unlearned
[1:37:52] and ignorant men they marveled and they
[1:37:56] took knowledge of them that they had
[1:37:58] been with jesus i pray lord may this be
[1:38:00] my testimony and beholding the man which
[1:38:03] was healed standing with them they could
[1:38:04] say nothing against it
[1:38:06] but when they had commanded them to go
[1:38:08] aside out of
[1:38:09] i'm out of the council they conferred
[1:38:11] among themselves saying
[1:38:12] what shall we do to these men
[1:38:15] for that indeed a notable miracle has
[1:38:18] been done by them to is manifest to all
[1:38:20] them that dwell in jerusalem and we
[1:38:21] cannot deny it
[1:38:23] so when and so we're just we're just
[1:38:25] jumping down to verse 21 here
[1:38:27] so when they had further threatened them
[1:38:29] they let them go
[1:38:30] finding nothing that they might punish
[1:38:32] them because of the people and all men
[1:38:35] glorified god which was done
[1:38:37] for the man was above 40 years old on
[1:38:40] whom this miracle of healing
[1:38:42] was shown now i want to speak this
[1:38:45] morning about intimidation
[1:38:47] we live in a day of great intimidation
[1:38:50] it may come in very uh you know you know
[1:38:52] in some countries it's very out and open
[1:38:55] but in other countries like this it's
[1:38:57] very discreet but yet it's just as
[1:38:58] powerful
[1:38:59] it's just as real it's just as
[1:39:01] threatening but i want to tell you this
[1:39:03] morning that our god is present
[1:39:05] i mean we don't need to fear nothing
[1:39:07] hallelujah but there is a power in the
[1:39:09] church right now
[1:39:10] amen that that is god is sent already
[1:39:13] into the bride
[1:39:14] i mean to overcome all intimidation now
[1:39:17] i just want to just kind of dramatize a
[1:39:19] bit this man that was crippled and he
[1:39:21] and he laid there by the gate you know
[1:39:23] for him maybe that's morning it you know
[1:39:25] it must have been like any other day
[1:39:27] you know i'm not sure what day the week
[1:39:28] it was you know that that man was
[1:39:30] dropped at the gate that day i i didn't
[1:39:32] quite catch that when i was reading it
[1:39:33] but
[1:39:34] you know we read there that he was above
[1:39:36] he was above was it 50
[1:39:38] oh no no no he was above 40 years old
[1:39:40] and and whoever it was would daily drop
[1:39:42] him by the gate
[1:39:44] so you know maybe just say you know if
[1:39:47] he was dropped there daily by the gate
[1:39:48] and maybe he sat there for just 20 years
[1:39:50] of his life
[1:39:51] that would be 3 000 i mean i mean 7 300
[1:39:55] times he was dropped at the gate
[1:39:56] so you could probably agree he knew his
[1:39:58] commute really well
[1:40:00] he knew what it was like you know to to
[1:40:02] to be picked up or however he was
[1:40:03] carried we do not know but
[1:40:05] you know for you know for just that
[1:40:07] space of time he knew it probably where
[1:40:08] every cobblestone was he knew the turn
[1:40:10] in the road he knew
[1:40:11] who would be standing there at that day
[1:40:13] and he'd be there at that day and he
[1:40:14] knew where he'd be sitting every day
[1:40:16] i mean so so he knew what it was like
[1:40:18] but this day was going to be a different
[1:40:19] kind of day
[1:40:20] this day was a very different kind of
[1:40:22] day amen when
[1:40:24] when but but his expectation was it's
[1:40:26] going to be like any other day
[1:40:28] but i just want to announce you maybe
[1:40:29] this day will be different for you
[1:40:31] oh yeah this could be a different kind
[1:40:32] of day i mean then every other time
[1:40:34] you've come into church
[1:40:36] hallelujah so here they were and you
[1:40:38] know you know the morning started for
[1:40:39] him like any other morning but
[1:40:41] you know there came a time where two men
[1:40:42] walked past him and he would say
[1:40:44] do you have any arms for the poor for
[1:40:46] the you know be merciful you
[1:40:47] know upon this
[1:40:48] crippled man and and and and these two
[1:40:51] maybe looked at him
[1:40:52] you know the same kind of way that maybe
[1:40:54] others did but but they had a different
[1:40:55] kind of look in their eyes
[1:40:57] because they had what this man really
[1:40:58] needed i mean he didn't need money he
[1:41:00] needed a healing
[1:41:02] he needed a touch from god almighty
[1:41:03] himself and so so peter and john they
[1:41:06] looked at him and you know they said
[1:41:07] look on us and he expected something
[1:41:09] from them and
[1:41:10] you know how people they get in a mode
[1:41:11] of thinking well i just need money to
[1:41:13] get by i need something
[1:41:15] we need more than just money to get by i
[1:41:17] mean we serve a supernatural god
[1:41:19] and it's going to take a supernatural
[1:41:20] rapture to take us out of this
[1:41:22] out of this world but i just want to say
[1:41:24] this morning
[1:41:25] god has sent a word into the earth this
[1:41:27] message to rapture a bride
[1:41:29] hallelujah so we don't need to worry
[1:41:32] about nothing
[1:41:33] but it depends where you try and draw
[1:41:35] your source of strength from
[1:41:38] so they would so so so he would he would
[1:41:40] look into their eyes and maybe hoping he
[1:41:42] was hoping we read that they
[1:41:43] you know he would get something from
[1:41:44] them but they said silver and gold have
[1:41:46] we known and maybe his heart sunk a
[1:41:48] little bit
[1:41:49] but he said such as we have if we did in
[1:41:51] the name of jesus christ
[1:41:52] nazareth rise up and walk and they took
[1:41:54] him by the hand and lifted it up and his
[1:41:56] ankle binds everything began to come
[1:41:57] normal
[1:41:58] and he went walking and leaping
[1:41:59] hallelujah into the temple rejoicing
[1:42:02] and it says that the people wondered
[1:42:04] what was going on
[1:42:06] now here he was he started the day as he
[1:42:08] thought every other day would be
[1:42:10] but this day was turning out very
[1:42:11] different and then he found himself
[1:42:13] dragged i mean so so
[1:42:15] it's amazing when god does something not
[1:42:17] everyone's happy about it
[1:42:18] you know no doubt when the people came
[1:42:20] in wondering they would have been
[1:42:22] amazement on their faces and some of
[1:42:23] them would have been so happy for this
[1:42:25] man because no doubt
[1:42:26] many that walked past him would have
[1:42:27] felt sorry he's been crippled from his
[1:42:30] mother's womb
[1:42:31] he's above 40 years old there's nothing
[1:42:33] that can be done for him i feel so sorry
[1:42:35] you know so some of them would have had
[1:42:37] such a happy look on their faces
[1:42:39] but then he saw a bunch of people with
[1:42:41] swords and slaves coming that didn't
[1:42:42] look too happy
[1:42:44] and sometimes you know when you know
[1:42:45] when god begins to do something in our
[1:42:46] lives
[1:42:47] not everyone's happy about it and the
[1:42:49] devil's sure not happy about it
[1:42:50] i mean so now an intimidation is going
[1:42:52] to come into his life that he never
[1:42:54] experienced before
[1:42:55] he experienced sympathy he experienced
[1:42:57] people feeling sorry for him
[1:42:58] but now here came an intimidation and he
[1:43:01] found himself dragged now here he was
[1:43:03] he was dragged in front of caiaphasis
[1:43:04] and you know anis and you know the high
[1:43:06] priest and all those ones
[1:43:08] with the disciples that morning he was
[1:43:10] sitting where you always sat but now he
[1:43:12] was standing where he never stood before
[1:43:14] amen and he was standing with a bunch of
[1:43:16] people that just looked like anyone else
[1:43:17] just like him
[1:43:18] and and and and the threats were coming
[1:43:22] by what power by what authority and what
[1:43:24] name do you do these things
[1:43:25] and they tried to intimidate them don't
[1:43:27] you preach in the name of jesus anymore
[1:43:29] and here's this man standing here and
[1:43:31] he's probably maybe wondering to himself
[1:43:32] hey he'd
[1:43:33] he'd still be rejoicing i'm walking
[1:43:36] he didn't need to be carried into that
[1:43:38] trial he walked do you need help no no
[1:43:40] i'm good
[1:43:41] you've seen me leap before i've never
[1:43:42] done that but i'll do it again oh do you
[1:43:44] want to see
[1:43:44] hallelujah so you know he was having a
[1:43:46] good time but then he maybe begin to
[1:43:47] take in the scene
[1:43:50] maybe he had seen the high priest and
[1:43:51] things from afar off
[1:43:53] that's the great holy reverend high
[1:43:55] priest you know and different things and
[1:43:57] their great cloaks and whatever more
[1:43:59] and maybe he never seen him in this kind
[1:44:01] of way but now now he was angry
[1:44:03] and they're trying to threaten the
[1:44:04] disciples and maybe he was wondering in
[1:44:06] his heart
[1:44:07] what are these guys going to say
[1:44:09] hallelujah they said something to him
[1:44:11] that no one had said to him before
[1:44:13] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:44:15] rise up and walk no doubt many people
[1:44:16] would have said to him sorry
[1:44:17] i have no money because it's here silver
[1:44:20] and gold have we known so so he heard
[1:44:21] that bit many times
[1:44:22] but he heard a different bit and that
[1:44:24] different bit changed his life right
[1:44:26] hallelujah so now here he was saying i
[1:44:28] wonder what these ones are going to say
[1:44:30] and they stood there and i know i've
[1:44:33] probably said this many times but
[1:44:35] we'll say it again who should we serve
[1:44:37] you or god should we please god or
[1:44:39] please man
[1:44:40] which one tell us the one you builders
[1:44:43] the stone that the builder you builders
[1:44:44] rejected
[1:44:45] has made the head of the corner of this
[1:44:47] jesus of nazareth this word this living
[1:44:49] worth is manifested in your midst
[1:44:50] that you builders rejected that you
[1:44:52] should have brought into your churches
[1:44:54] and let god live in your church and
[1:44:55] change the people
[1:44:56] you rejected it hallelujah amen
[1:45:00] and here's my thinking i've never heard
[1:45:02] that before
[1:45:03] now let's just go back a bit before this
[1:45:05] trial he's thrown into jail with them
[1:45:08] i doubt very much he expected today i'm
[1:45:09] gonna end up in prison
[1:45:11] you know but there he was sometimes life
[1:45:14] takes us through very unexpected turns
[1:45:16] i mean but we should never god is not
[1:45:18] unexpected you know he's not he's not
[1:45:20] you know he sees your week ahead of you
[1:45:23] he's not surprised at any of it
[1:45:25] we have our plans he has his plans
[1:45:27] hallelujah
[1:45:28] you know sometimes we think man this is
[1:45:30] going pear-shaped and god's saying no
[1:45:31] it's going real well
[1:45:33] it's right on schedule it's under budget
[1:45:35] hallelujah it's going well
[1:45:36] hezekiah was in that kind of place and
[1:45:38] i'll come back to him later but you know
[1:45:40] he had he had turned the turn the people
[1:45:42] back to god
[1:45:43] he took away the hype um high places the
[1:45:46] idols the groves he cut that all down
[1:45:48] and he
[1:45:48] and he and he you know reconsecrated the
[1:45:50] temple and brought the people back to
[1:45:51] god and maybe in his mind you think
[1:45:53] now we're just gonna we're just gonna
[1:45:54] push out and take the land and
[1:45:56] but he found the enemy coming in and
[1:45:58] coming in and slowly
[1:46:00] all the wall cities of the of the
[1:46:01] country were taken
[1:46:03] and there he was in a spot many times we
[1:46:06] think everything's just going to go fine
[1:46:08] i
[1:46:08] i gave my life to the lord everything's
[1:46:09] going to go fine no no the battle begins
[1:46:12] the battle begins and now your faith is
[1:46:13] going to be put to the test
[1:46:15] and god isn't going to try and say you
[1:46:16] know there used to be um
[1:46:19] anyone who works in construction i did
[1:46:21] my stint
[1:46:22] and you know but it was actually just
[1:46:24] testing every time they would pour
[1:46:26] concrete
[1:46:27] they would they they would take two
[1:46:29] cylinders of of the concrete
[1:46:31] and they'd do a strength test at day
[1:46:34] three and day something else to see
[1:46:35] and if it failed the strength test was i
[1:46:37] had to rip out the concrete and report
[1:46:39] now god doesn't put us through that kind
[1:46:41] of test to see when are they going to
[1:46:42] break when are they going to break when
[1:46:43] they're going to break
[1:46:44] no when i say he he's going to prove
[1:46:46] your faith to you
[1:46:48] he's not looking for your breaking point
[1:46:50] say well i didn't think they could take
[1:46:51] it because this machine was going
[1:46:52] should just break the thing that's not
[1:46:54] what god does god wants to prove to you
[1:46:57] your faith works your faith holds
[1:47:00] your faith has power with him that's
[1:47:02] what he wants to prove with you amen
[1:47:04] he's not trying to find your breaking
[1:47:06] point well i thought that would break no
[1:47:07] no he wants to prove to you
[1:47:09] the salvation he has given you works it
[1:47:12] holds
[1:47:12] it'll keep you you'll be able to go
[1:47:14] through every trial no matter how big
[1:47:16] how small how terrible it may be
[1:47:18] god is wanting to prove your faith to
[1:47:20] you i mean i just want to let's just you
[1:47:22] know slides are a
[1:47:23] dangerous thing for me because i'm never
[1:47:26] oh there we go
[1:47:27] brother brown says this after the seals
[1:47:29] and he's and he's speaking about the
[1:47:30] woman
[1:47:31] you know you know who came in the
[1:47:32] prostitute woman that came into the
[1:47:34] simon the pharisees house where jesus
[1:47:36] was sitting with unwashed feet and
[1:47:38] uninvited and
[1:47:39] you know he was you know she she
[1:47:41] couldn't stand and being like that and
[1:47:43] she snuck in and you know you know the
[1:47:44] story
[1:47:46] and then when and but then it's amazing
[1:47:47] i just love these words when jesus spoke
[1:47:49] back to the pharisee
[1:47:51] he justified her by her works because he
[1:47:54] said simon i've got somewhat to say to
[1:47:55] thee
[1:47:56] simon says say on you know i came in
[1:47:59] you didn't wash my feet didn't kiss me
[1:48:01] welcome didn't anoint me or whatever
[1:48:03] but this woman ever since she came in
[1:48:04] here broke her alabaster box on my feet
[1:48:06] wiped her feet with my tears
[1:48:08] wash it hello use it her yo her
[1:48:10] god-given towels her glory on her head
[1:48:12] to wash my feet
[1:48:14] he says but when so so he justified her
[1:48:16] by her works but when he justified her
[1:48:18] to herself
[1:48:20] he justified her by her faith see god
[1:48:24] wants to justify us to our self
[1:48:28] right he wants to see there's always a
[1:48:30] battle going on
[1:48:32] the devil says you're not a believer but
[1:48:34] god says
[1:48:35] you're a believer hallelujah he wants to
[1:48:38] justify
[1:48:39] you to yourself because many times we
[1:48:42] have a battle
[1:48:43] am i a believer am i not and it's
[1:48:45] because the devil wants to say you're
[1:48:47] not going to make it
[1:48:48] you you know the blood didn't work for
[1:48:50] you you're just doing this thing because
[1:48:51] everyone else is doing this thing
[1:48:53] but god wants to come around and say no
[1:48:55] hold on where were you where i
[1:48:57] where were you when i found you where
[1:49:00] were you when i found you
[1:49:02] hallelujah you were lost and undone
[1:49:04] wandering down
[1:49:05] life's into darkness you know maybe in
[1:49:07] very dark places like legion was
[1:49:09] but i called you out of there i called
[1:49:12] you out for a purpose hallelujah i
[1:49:14] saved you for a reason amen not just to
[1:49:16] make you a
[1:49:17] message believer but i would come and
[1:49:19] live in your life my word would manifest
[1:49:21] hallelujah through your life
[1:49:23] hallelujah that's the reason there's a
[1:49:26] purpose
[1:49:26] we're here right
[1:49:30] but the devil tries to stop us living
[1:49:32] out our purpose
[1:49:34] so here he was we're just gonna as i say
[1:49:37] it's dangerous
[1:49:38] there we go we're gonna go back to the
[1:49:40] man
[1:49:42] before this trial he's thrown into
[1:49:44] prison
[1:49:46] and you know prison um maybe maybe let's
[1:49:49] just say he was thrown into a different
[1:49:51] cell than the disciples
[1:49:53] and his cellmate would say what are you
[1:49:55] in for
[1:49:57] what are you in for and maybe he'll just
[1:49:59] say no no you know and
[1:50:01] then maybe his selma would say did you
[1:50:02] hear about all this tumult in the temple
[1:50:04] and you know these
[1:50:05] these these religious fanatics saying
[1:50:07] about the name of jesus but this man was
[1:50:09] healed and you know all this stuff going
[1:50:10] on because you know it spreads people
[1:50:11] talk
[1:50:12] people talk and then and then he'd ask
[1:50:14] him what are you in for
[1:50:16] he'd say no no i'm not in for anything
[1:50:19] well then why are you here i'm just the
[1:50:20] evidence
[1:50:22] what do you mean you're just the
[1:50:24] evidence well i'm just the living
[1:50:26] evidence that jesus heals
[1:50:28] i mean jesus fixes broken places jesus
[1:50:31] takes complexes and things that
[1:50:32] up our walk
[1:50:33] i'm just the evidence hallelujah that
[1:50:36] his name has power
[1:50:37] amen that he has deliverance in his name
[1:50:40] hallelujah
[1:50:41] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:50:45] so but he found himself
[1:50:48] hello evidence how are you you know you
[1:50:51] don't
[1:50:52] put people in an evidence drawer you
[1:50:54] know
[1:50:55] anyway you know what i mean anyway
[1:50:56] praise the lord so so he but he found
[1:50:58] himself
[1:51:00] in the great clash of the ages
[1:51:03] he thought he was just a crippled man
[1:51:05] sitting by a gate every day
[1:51:07] but god had a greater purpose in his
[1:51:08] life hallelujah but he found himself
[1:51:11] caught up in the great clash of the ages
[1:51:13] on one side
[1:51:14] the holy ghost was present amen dwelling
[1:51:18] in his redeemed people
[1:51:19] and looking for more of his redeemed
[1:51:21] people hallelujah
[1:51:23] searching out for every name written in
[1:51:25] the book amen
[1:51:26] as i will i think i left um uh
[1:51:30] i finished last sunday from daniel 12
[1:51:32] where he says in that day there'll be a
[1:51:33] time of great trouble
[1:51:35] as which has never been upon the earth
[1:51:36] but michael the great prince will stand
[1:51:38] up for the children of thy people
[1:51:39] amen and everyone whose name is in the
[1:51:41] book will be redeemed so we must realize
[1:51:43] we're living in a time of great trouble
[1:51:45] right this this world is you know
[1:51:48] shaking like it's never shook before
[1:51:50] you may say well we've had pestilence
[1:51:52] before and we have
[1:51:54] we've had plagues before and we have but
[1:51:56] this is different
[1:51:58] why is it different because america is
[1:52:00] speaking like a dragon
[1:52:01] right prophecy is being fulfilled and
[1:52:04] their enemies are waiting for them to
[1:52:06] finally show because the cracks are
[1:52:07] showing in that great country
[1:52:09] right it's falling apart you know
[1:52:11] brother brahm said you could have an
[1:52:12] abraham lincoln and a george washington
[1:52:14] in every county in the nation
[1:52:16] and it wouldn't fix it amen so it's
[1:52:19] falling apart
[1:52:20] but you see an enemy waits for the one
[1:52:22] that's in power
[1:52:23] for a time to strike they know they
[1:52:25] couldn't strike them when they're in
[1:52:27] their power and they're unified
[1:52:28] but wait for them to become divided and
[1:52:31] that's from page news right now
[1:52:33] so this is a different kind of season
[1:52:35] but in this kind of season this is when
[1:52:37] god is going to come down and take his
[1:52:38] bride away
[1:52:40] this is the hour of the resurrection i
[1:52:41] believe we're living in it amen
[1:52:43] hallelujah so you know
[1:52:47] so this is a different hour i say well
[1:52:49] 2021
[1:52:50] or 2022 then i'll be able to fly around
[1:52:52] the world we may not get there
[1:52:54] jesus might take us home before then i
[1:52:57] think that'd be amen i hope so too
[1:52:59] brother ben hallelujah
[1:53:01] you know but so we should be looking now
[1:53:03] what are we looking to
[1:53:05] fulfill in this hour the last promise of
[1:53:09] the church in this house is a change in
[1:53:10] the body
[1:53:11] right that's the that's the promise
[1:53:13] we're living under
[1:53:15] and that is the that is the one thing
[1:53:18] amen we must be looking for
[1:53:20] sure we should plan for the future
[1:53:21] naturally but don't get caught up in all
[1:53:23] of that
[1:53:24] have your eyes upon the word in this day
[1:53:27] amen
[1:53:28] so he found himself in the great clash
[1:53:30] of the ages one side the holy ghost was
[1:53:32] working redeeming his people
[1:53:33] and on the other side was the antichrist
[1:53:37] amen and the antichrist was standing
[1:53:39] there trying to stop
[1:53:40] the word of god being fulfilled amen so
[1:53:44] and and and this is where i got my title
[1:53:46] from about intimidation
[1:53:49] now intimidation the cambridge
[1:53:50] dictionary tells me
[1:53:52] it means to frighten or to threaten
[1:53:54] someone
[1:53:55] usually in order to prosp to persuade
[1:53:58] them
[1:53:59] to do something you want them to do
[1:54:03] that's what intimidation is so it's to
[1:54:06] try and frighten or to threaten someone
[1:54:08] in order to get them to do what you want
[1:54:10] to do
[1:54:11] we're living in an hour of great
[1:54:12] intimidation even in this country you
[1:54:15] say well we're in a bubble in the bottom
[1:54:16] of the pacific and no
[1:54:18] this this country there's a very subtle
[1:54:21] intimidation in this country
[1:54:23] you've got to talk like the majority you
[1:54:25] can't disagree with nobody
[1:54:26] and if you do you're in trouble right as
[1:54:29] as
[1:54:30] as brother isaac would say you know this
[1:54:32] is the place where the
[1:54:33] where the haters are hated or everyone
[1:54:35] hates the haters or everyone's label are
[1:54:36] you just a bigot or you have whatever
[1:54:38] more
[1:54:38] people can't even in this world you
[1:54:40] can't even have a difference of opinion
[1:54:42] right why what's happening is because
[1:54:44] there's a forcing now
[1:54:46] everyone must agree conform to the same
[1:54:48] mind
[1:54:49] but we but the bride is the mind of
[1:54:50] christ i mean we have a different kind
[1:54:52] of thinking a different kind of outlook
[1:54:54] to the
[1:54:55] to the rest of the world you know we
[1:54:57] know everyone
[1:54:58] everyone has to fulfill a role in this
[1:55:00] day do you know this whole world is a
[1:55:02] stage
[1:55:04] do you know everyone is playing a role
[1:55:06] everyone upon the earth is playing a
[1:55:07] role
[1:55:08] not just trump not just putin not just
[1:55:10] whoever's up there in the
[1:55:12] in the government everyone is playing a
[1:55:14] role
[1:55:15] you actually haven't have a script you
[1:55:18] have a role to play
[1:55:20] but it's actually your your free moral
[1:55:22] agency which will dictate
[1:55:24] who you're going to play in the script
[1:55:25] because jesus said whomsoever will let
[1:55:27] him come
[1:55:28] and drink the waters of life freely we
[1:55:30] know this predestination i believe in it
[1:55:33] but it's but god doesn't force us
[1:55:35] through a pipe and just make us the
[1:55:36] bride of christ we've got to surrender
[1:55:38] we've got to die we've got to really die
[1:55:40] we're going to
[1:55:41] our will has to die and his will come in
[1:55:45] see everyone has a script everyone's got
[1:55:47] a role
[1:55:49] hallelujah what part do you want to play
[1:55:50] this hour
[1:55:52] sure we love to see where the bride
[1:55:54] walks on streets of gold and you know
[1:55:55] how we how how the devil's cast into the
[1:55:57] lake of fire we rejoice in those things
[1:56:00] i mean but it's not just that part of
[1:56:02] the role that's being played right now
[1:56:05] there's a walk there's a race we've got
[1:56:07] to run
[1:56:08] it's a it's a race of self-denial right
[1:56:11] take up your cross
[1:56:12] deny yourself take up your cross and
[1:56:13] follow me
[1:56:15] sure there's a lot of intimidation in
[1:56:17] this hour but we've got to overcome it
[1:56:19] and the lord has given us the power now
[1:56:21] to overcome all intimidation
[1:56:23] amen hallelujah
[1:56:27] amen so this world
[1:56:30] even even that you know that's the power
[1:56:32] of social media in this day people make
[1:56:34] something that's disagreeable
[1:56:37] they get cancelled this is a world of
[1:56:39] cancel they call it cancel culture
[1:56:43] amen cancel culture
[1:56:48] so if you do anything say anything
[1:56:49] that's contrary
[1:56:51] i mean to what the world is saying you
[1:56:53] just get tired and feathered publicly
[1:56:56] everyone know what tara and feather
[1:56:57] means publicly get
[1:56:59] dipped in a bunch of tar get covered in
[1:57:01] feathers now you just look like the full
[1:57:03] and this is what this world wants to
[1:57:04] make us try and look like the devil
[1:57:06] because he wants to make us to
[1:57:07] intimidate us to do what he wants to do
[1:57:11] but his brother moore said who's the
[1:57:13] boss amen who's my boss
[1:57:15] you're not my boss devil god's my boss
[1:57:18] hallelujah so you know
[1:57:19] we need to just stand you know god gives
[1:57:21] us power
[1:57:23] i just want to just say we're not left
[1:57:24] here alone maybe hezekiah was wondering
[1:57:27] how are we ever going to get through
[1:57:28] this
[1:57:29] here came the enemy you know saying your
[1:57:32] god won't help you
[1:57:33] your god is just like all the other gods
[1:57:35] we conquered them we'll conquer the same
[1:57:37] one
[1:57:37] i remember but he came to the wrong city
[1:57:39] he came to the wrong believer
[1:57:41] in the sao hala he came to the wrong
[1:57:43] person amen if you know the lord he came
[1:57:45] to the wrong city
[1:57:47] hallelujah and though though hezekiah
[1:57:49] was intimidated though he knew that that
[1:57:51] assyria could take the
[1:57:52] could could could take the city i mean
[1:57:55] he went to his source of strength
[1:57:58] now it's amazing with intimidation
[1:58:00] they'll get you to try and think a
[1:58:01] certain way
[1:58:02] and your and your thought pattern will
[1:58:04] be reduced down to
[1:58:06] certain things and that's what they were
[1:58:08] trying to do
[1:58:09] with the disciples stop preaching in
[1:58:12] this name otherwise you're in trouble
[1:58:14] so now what were they going to live
[1:58:16] under the promise of the hour
[1:58:18] or their threats oh we better conform we
[1:58:22] better just yeah i just want to get
[1:58:23] through life and i want to
[1:58:24] you know i just don't want to cause any
[1:58:27] trouble rock any boats
[1:58:29] if you're a believer the boat's already
[1:58:30] been rocked the devil's boat's already
[1:58:33] been rocked
[1:58:34] you can't help it remember but to i
[1:58:36] think i think brother ron spencer said
[1:58:38] it and forgive me if i'm jumping around
[1:58:39] a lot but you know
[1:58:40] he said in order to haul in the hang of
[1:58:43] fame
[1:58:43] you got to go through a hall of critics
[1:58:46] right you have to go through a hall
[1:58:48] of critics i mean so if you're doing
[1:58:49] anything for god you'll be criticized
[1:58:52] right you'll be made fun of you'll be
[1:58:53] ridiculed why because it's the devil
[1:58:55] trying to intimidate you
[1:58:57] to sit down and shut up but the holy
[1:59:00] ghost is here
[1:59:02] i mean to anoint the gift in our lives i
[1:59:05] mean that god can work through his body
[1:59:07] what was the hype what was the
[1:59:08] antichrist spirit trying to do through
[1:59:10] the high priest and things
[1:59:11] trying to stop the apostles actually
[1:59:14] operating in their office as apostles
[1:59:16] that's what he's trying to do he's
[1:59:17] trying to get them to sit down and shut
[1:59:19] up that god couldn't flow through their
[1:59:20] lives
[1:59:21] because they were ordained as apostles
[1:59:23] it wasn't them trying to be apostles god
[1:59:25] put them in that place
[1:59:26] i mean god it's not us trying to be the
[1:59:28] bride of christ god made us the bride of
[1:59:30] christ
[1:59:30] god made us his beloved we are the apple
[1:59:33] of his eye not because of what we could
[1:59:34] do because he chose us
[1:59:36] hallelujah remember brother braham says
[1:59:38] in the bible says it
[1:59:39] you know god's love is shown by election
[1:59:47] how do you know that god loves us i'm
[1:59:49] just paraphrasing
[1:59:51] because he says jacob have i loved but
[1:59:53] esau have i hated before they
[1:59:54] even born and the apostle paul picks it
[1:59:56] up and brother mcc
[1:59:58] it shows god's love is shown in election
[2:00:01] it's not like parental care love like
[2:00:04] hello parents here
[2:00:05] our love for our children is i want to
[2:00:07] keep them from all harm
[2:00:10] because you know what parent here loves
[2:00:13] to see their
[2:00:14] their their kids go through a grinder
[2:00:15] and get mashed up hurt scarred
[2:00:17] sick none of us do we want to keep them
[2:00:20] from everything
[2:00:22] but that's just parental care love
[2:00:23] that's not god's love god's love has
[2:00:25] shown an election
[2:00:26] right before that those two were ever
[2:00:29] born
[2:00:30] jacob have i loved east or have i hated
[2:00:32] before they even born god's love was
[2:00:34] shown in election because he knew what
[2:00:35] they would do
[2:00:37] amen so so well what has that got to do
[2:00:39] with me
[2:00:40] god's called you who's been called
[2:00:44] who's been called why they call you
[2:00:47] because he's justified you
[2:00:50] so if i'm justified i said devil shut up
[2:00:53] you have no right to say i'm not a
[2:00:54] believer i'm not going to make it i'm
[2:00:56] not an overcomer
[2:00:57] no that you're just talking about
[2:00:59] yourself and trying to share your
[2:01:00] experience with me
[2:01:03] i'm not here to join the pity party of
[2:01:04] the devil he's not a believer he's a
[2:01:07] make-believer
[2:01:08] he he'll never be washed there's no
[2:01:10] blood for him he's never going to
[2:01:11] make it he's going to burn right but the
[2:01:14] bride is going to walk victorious out of
[2:01:15] the earth
[2:01:17] how did you get to the wedding sup a
[2:01:18] little bright because jesus
[2:01:20] wanted me here hallelujah
[2:01:24] and if he wants me there i'm going to
[2:01:25] get there i can go kicking i can go
[2:01:27] screaming or i can go
[2:01:28] victorious i don't want to be a deathbed
[2:01:31] confession kind of believer
[2:01:33] i want to i want to walk with god every
[2:01:35] day i don't know how many more days upon
[2:01:37] the earth we have but let's give our god
[2:01:39] our all
[2:01:40] right hallelujah how we how we treat
[2:01:42] each other how we treat our families
[2:01:43] maybe to the glory of god
[2:01:45] how we treat our associates at work let
[2:01:47] it be to the glory of god
[2:01:48] how we treat the lost ones on the street
[2:01:50] let it be to the glory of god
[2:01:52] may they see something that they want
[2:01:55] let's be salty shall we children
[2:01:58] hallelujah
[2:01:59] amen so i'd rather just walk you know
[2:02:01] you know what the devil hates
[2:02:03] are consecrated brother braham says this
[2:02:05] is the thunder that shakes the devil
[2:02:07] a consecrated lived voice
[2:02:10] i mean a lived voice it's not someone
[2:02:13] that just says about
[2:02:14] quotes of scripture in the bible but it
[2:02:15] lives in them that's who wants to shake
[2:02:18] the devil
[2:02:19] live that kind of life and you'll shake
[2:02:20] the devil hallelujah
[2:02:23] oh can it be done that's why jesus died
[2:02:25] so it can be done
[2:02:27] hallelujah amen amen so he's trying to
[2:02:30] get us to think a certain
[2:02:32] way that all we can live through is what
[2:02:35] he's trying to get upon us
[2:02:37] and that's what they were trying to do
[2:02:38] to hezekiah
[2:02:40] we've taken all of the walled cities of
[2:02:42] judah or israel whichever king he was
[2:02:44] over
[2:02:45] we've taken all these other nations
[2:02:48] their gods didn't help them
[2:02:50] your god won't help you your god is like
[2:02:52] all the other gods
[2:02:54] this is going to be the end result
[2:02:57] and and when the spokesman for the king
[2:02:59] of assyria said all those things
[2:03:01] he was speaking in the hebrew tongue
[2:03:02] they even asked him i just i'm skipped
[2:03:04] over but you gotta read the account
[2:03:06] they said please don't speak in the
[2:03:07] syrian tongue we understand it
[2:03:09] don't speak in hebrew but the enemy
[2:03:11] doesn't do that
[2:03:13] he said no i'm going to speak in a
[2:03:14] language that everyone understands
[2:03:18] what does he do then you're not going in
[2:03:20] a rapture
[2:03:22] you're not going to make it these other
[2:03:24] christians have been swallowed up by the
[2:03:25] beast
[2:03:27] right he'll do the same with you you
[2:03:29] think you're really going to escape the
[2:03:30] wrath that's going to come upon the
[2:03:31] earth
[2:03:32] that's not going to happen the the
[2:03:35] promise has been lingering too long
[2:03:39] doesn't he say that
[2:03:42] though it may tarry it's going to happen
[2:03:46] why why is it towering because these
[2:03:48] people got to come in
[2:03:50] there's a re we're not just occupying
[2:03:53] time
[2:03:54] we're here for a purpose i mean there's
[2:03:56] people whose names are on the book they
[2:03:58] must come in
[2:03:59] i mean they're on the lamb's book of
[2:04:00] life i remember they have to come and
[2:04:02] they're going to come under the blood
[2:04:04] i mean they would become one with the
[2:04:05] lord jesus christ amen and they're out
[2:04:07] there somewhere
[2:04:09] hallelujah we should not be caught up in
[2:04:11] the political arena of this day
[2:04:14] jesus said to pilate if my kingdom was
[2:04:17] of this world then my subjects would
[2:04:19] fight
[2:04:19] but my kingdom is not of this world i
[2:04:22] mean so i'm
[2:04:23] to live a life that proves which kingdom
[2:04:24] i belong to
[2:04:26] i'm not going to get caught up in what's
[2:04:27] going on in the world are we caught up
[2:04:29] in his kingdom
[2:04:30] and his brother phil said what's his
[2:04:31] kingdom interested in souls
[2:04:34] one soul is worth more than ten thousand
[2:04:36] worlds
[2:04:38] that's how valuable one soul is doesn't
[2:04:40] matter about the packaging on the
[2:04:42] outside
[2:04:43] hallelujah sometimes they're not wrapped
[2:04:45] up too well we think
[2:04:46] but god knows where his seat is that's
[2:04:48] what we should be focused upon lord
[2:04:51] we we cannot go home until that last one
[2:04:54] comes in
[2:04:56] we're actually and and that's what the
[2:04:57] devil wants to keep us actually pinned
[2:04:59] upon the earth
[2:05:00] because he knows that god can't lose one
[2:05:03] but he fights with all he can that god
[2:05:05] may lose one because if god loses one
[2:05:07] the devil's won
[2:05:10] right so he tries to get us caught up in
[2:05:13] all different kind of things
[2:05:14] but we must be about our father's
[2:05:16] business
[2:05:18] amen which is what finding that last one
[2:05:21] that we can go home
[2:05:22] that's why i pray god maybe we just have
[2:05:24] such an atmosphere
[2:05:26] i mean that it will affect our work will
[2:05:28] affect the people on the street
[2:05:30] even as we go through pack and save
[2:05:31] getting the groceries may be such an
[2:05:32] atmosphere
[2:05:34] harley you're lord that there'll be
[2:05:35] people that see us and it's more than
[2:05:36] long faces long hair long dress
[2:05:38] i mean maybe a jaw in our hearts that
[2:05:40] we're rejoicing
[2:05:42] i'm glad i'm i'm glad that sunken yeah
[2:05:45] it's like brother tim brooks says if you
[2:05:46] don't get it today you'll get it
[2:05:47] tomorrow
[2:05:48] you know but you know but but you know
[2:05:50] this should be such a joy
[2:05:51] i'm going home there's nothing holding
[2:05:53] me here jesus paid it all
[2:05:56] doesn't matter what the mind battles say
[2:05:58] remember here was hezekiah think about
[2:06:00] it
[2:06:01] the devil's telling him you're toast
[2:06:05] you turned the nation to god it didn't
[2:06:07] help you none
[2:06:08] what good did you try to line up with
[2:06:10] the word do we've taken your land we've
[2:06:12] taken every wall city
[2:06:14] this is not doing you any good look your
[2:06:16] children are gone these ones are gone
[2:06:18] these ones have gone sideways what good
[2:06:19] is your life done
[2:06:21] where he was trying to get him to you
[2:06:22] know this way
[2:06:24] but hezekiah he had a source of strength
[2:06:28] and he knew that the final page of the
[2:06:31] book wasn't turned over yet
[2:06:33] and he went to a source of strength and
[2:06:36] he told the
[2:06:37] he told the lord what the enemy was
[2:06:39] threatening him worth
[2:06:41] hallelujah but he was hezekiah he wasn't
[2:06:44] like the other nations
[2:06:45] he was a circumcised son of abraham
[2:06:49] amen living in the promised land and his
[2:06:52] heart was set lord i want to serve you
[2:06:55] this is where we're standing he was
[2:06:56] standing in his inheritance
[2:06:58] he was a godly king and here comes the
[2:07:01] devil coming along to him saying
[2:07:03] i'm going to get you boy
[2:07:06] what about you and i i believe i'm
[2:07:08] looking at a people whose hearts are
[2:07:09] lord i want to serve you i love you
[2:07:12] i'll serve thee because i love thee amen
[2:07:15] hello lord you're more than life to me
[2:07:18] your your love is all i long for i want
[2:07:21] you lord
[2:07:21] amen it doesn't matter about remember
[2:07:23] it's not him that falls at him that gets
[2:07:25] back
[2:07:25] up maybe you've bitten too much you know
[2:07:28] maybe you've eaten too much
[2:07:29] dirt because the devil's kicked you down
[2:07:30] one too many heaps
[2:07:32] just get back up get back up amen
[2:07:35] hallelujah so here he was a circumcised
[2:07:38] son of abraham standing as
[2:07:40] a godly king living in his inheritance i
[2:07:43] could say he is adopted son of god
[2:07:46] living in his position and here the
[2:07:48] devil comes along
[2:07:49] trying to make him think you're just
[2:07:51] like everybody else
[2:07:53] you're a king like these just these
[2:07:54] other kings you are the same
[2:07:56] i'll say we may be people but we're not
[2:07:58] the same
[2:07:59] amen because we have a living god a
[2:08:02] living god amen that
[2:08:03] and the god that gave the promise is the
[2:08:05] same god that will fulfill his promise
[2:08:07] amen don't you think he can't keep his
[2:08:09] word amen it's impossible for him to
[2:08:12] fail that's the one thing he cannot do
[2:08:13] is fail
[2:08:14] i mean so if he gave you the promise
[2:08:17] he'll keep the promise he'll fulfill the
[2:08:19] promise
[2:08:19] because he promised it and he cannot
[2:08:22] fail
[2:08:23] hallelujah he kept the promised abraham
[2:08:27] hallelujah and it says in the book of
[2:08:29] hebrew um hebrews i don't have it on me
[2:08:31] right now but he says when when an oath
[2:08:33] is confirmed
[2:08:34] then you cease from all strife so when
[2:08:38] god confirms his promise then you can
[2:08:40] rest
[2:08:41] and remember if you've even just been
[2:08:43] saved
[2:08:45] the whole promise of all every promise
[2:08:46] of god belongs to you
[2:08:48] the holy ghost belongs to you healing
[2:08:50] belongs remember if he healed you once
[2:08:51] he can heal you again
[2:08:52] and because by one offering he's healed
[2:08:55] you
[2:08:56] by one offering he saved you by one
[2:08:58] offering he redeemed you and your
[2:08:59] children
[2:09:00] amen every single promise of god is
[2:09:02] yours
[2:09:04] hallelujah when he just confirms one
[2:09:07] because the same god that gave the first
[2:09:09] promise gave every other promise
[2:09:10] so now if he's confirmed his oath to you
[2:09:13] amen you can rest
[2:09:16] don't need to worry the devil tried to
[2:09:18] make us worry he tried to get hezekiah
[2:09:20] to worry
[2:09:21] but here's a kite and try here's a kite
[2:09:23] and go to his men of war saying how
[2:09:25] we're going to do this boys
[2:09:27] do we have enough supplies do we have
[2:09:29] enough arrows and weapons and
[2:09:30] you know other other gates barred and
[2:09:33] you know do we have
[2:09:34] no sure before the enemy came he you
[2:09:37] know made the springs
[2:09:38] go you know you know divert them into
[2:09:40] the city and all those things but when
[2:09:41] the enemy finally came
[2:09:44] so he made preparations so don't get me
[2:09:45] wrong in times of peace
[2:09:47] prepare for war right that's what we
[2:09:50] should do
[2:09:50] i'm just having a glorious jubilee on
[2:09:53] the mountaintop prepare for war
[2:09:55] prepare for war don't slack don't just
[2:09:57] sit back and say no no prepare for war
[2:09:59] how do you prepare for how do you
[2:10:01] prepare for war pray
[2:10:03] seek him in his word lord i want to
[2:10:05] receive strength
[2:10:07] hallelujah it's like you know you know
[2:10:08] it's like soldiers they go through
[2:10:10] um training before they go into the
[2:10:12] battlefield
[2:10:13] and they've got to carry big packs on
[2:10:15] their back and they've got a you know
[2:10:16] you know um
[2:10:17] do like commando crawl under barbed wire
[2:10:19] and there's and these machine guns
[2:10:21] brother and says like live machine gun
[2:10:22] rounds firing
[2:10:23] but the machine gun can only fire a
[2:10:25] certain height and they've got to go
[2:10:26] under that and there they have simulated
[2:10:28] combat and all these things
[2:10:29] and maybe you know they would think why
[2:10:32] do we have to go through all this
[2:10:34] and the drill sergeants screaming in
[2:10:36] their ears every hour night of the day
[2:10:37] and they've got to get up and run and do
[2:10:39] all these things and
[2:10:40] why i have to carry this pack and this
[2:10:42] and this shovel and this hand grenade
[2:10:43] and why i'd have to do this
[2:10:44] but then when when they finally go into
[2:10:47] combat
[2:10:48] every time that the drill sergeant
[2:10:50] screamed at them they
[2:10:52] they loved the man every time they said
[2:10:54] why do i have to carry this hand grenade
[2:10:55] then they use it they say i'm so glad i
[2:10:57] carried that hand grenade
[2:10:58] or why do i have to take the shovel when
[2:11:00] they're digging their foxhole they say
[2:11:02] thank god i carry this thing
[2:11:04] one time when it's training it's a pain
[2:11:08] on the battlefield it saves their lives
[2:11:11] and it's the same thing with us why do i
[2:11:12] have to read this word why do i have to
[2:11:14] listen to the message
[2:11:15] you may never know when it'll come in
[2:11:16] handy i mean when the enemy comes
[2:11:18] against you
[2:11:19] i mean then then the word comes forth
[2:11:21] into your mind amen defeats those
[2:11:23] thoughts you'll say
[2:11:24] thank god i heard that sermon thank god
[2:11:26] i read the word thank god i'm in
[2:11:28] communion with my lord
[2:11:29] hallelujah and this drill sergeant that
[2:11:31] screams at you maybe every sunday say
[2:11:33] thank god for that guy
[2:11:35] hallelujah hallelujah it'll be worth it
[2:11:40] amen amen hallelujah
[2:11:43] but you see now hezekiah
[2:11:47] got caught up
[2:11:50] he actually because remember we can't
[2:11:52] stop the devil putting thoughts in our
[2:11:54] mind
[2:11:55] we are not immune you say i'm in the
[2:11:57] bright age i'm the
[2:11:58] in the bride the bride is in a bright
[2:12:00] age we've been called adelaide this year
[2:12:01] ladies here's still going on
[2:12:03] right but we're not immune from ladies
[2:12:05] here affecting us
[2:12:07] god doesn't just put us in a big bunch
[2:12:09] of bubble wrap and you know
[2:12:11] roll us down the hill and we're all fine
[2:12:13] there'll be battles we know
[2:12:15] there'll be mind battles we're not
[2:12:17] immune from spirits but we have a power
[2:12:19] within us to overcome
[2:12:21] every single one hallelujah so the devil
[2:12:24] will try and bring his depression
[2:12:26] trump bring some lust or pride or
[2:12:28] whatever feeling sorry for ourselves or
[2:12:30] it may be he'll bring all those things
[2:12:32] but there's a power within us to
[2:12:34] overcome
[2:12:35] every spirit i mean let's just wait
[2:12:39] this comes to mind i just need to read
[2:12:40] this
[2:12:42] as i say men's slides are

[2:13:04] strength
[2:13:06] yes hallelujah amen
[2:13:11] and jesus said this is in wisdom versus
[2:13:13] faith your name is in the palm of my
[2:13:15] hand
[2:13:16] so how is it ever going to be forgotten
[2:13:18] can't be

[2:13:21] hands it's not he didn't write them on
[2:13:23] byro you know you're with byron on her
[2:13:25] hand it gets washed off after a while
[2:13:26] they're engraved
[2:13:28] they're part of him then if jesus
[2:13:31] defeated satan upon faith knowing who he
[2:13:33] was
[2:13:34] he was a predestinated creature are you
[2:13:36] ready
[2:13:37] amen are you ready congregation says

[2:13:53] that god promised to put in the church

[2:14:05] it's here the word is here the lord has
[2:14:08] opened his word his fullness amen we're
[2:14:09] not just living under justification like
[2:14:11] luther we have the whole thing
[2:14:12] we're not just living under
[2:14:13] sanctification like weasley we have the
[2:14:15] whole thing
[2:14:16] we're not just living under the gifts we
[2:14:17] have the gifts and everything we have
[2:14:19] the giver
[2:14:20] hallelujah so everything is set in order
[2:14:22] as i said everyone's gonna fulfill a
[2:14:24] role
[2:14:25] and the bride of christ is standing to
[2:14:27] her attention
[2:14:29] we're standing to our attention sister
[2:14:30] hannah harley god's called us
[2:14:32] we accepted the part because we're made
[2:14:34] to be you know some actors are just made
[2:14:36] to
[2:14:36] play a part how they're built how they
[2:14:39] speak how they conduct themselves
[2:14:41] this man was made to build you know
[2:14:43] played this part of this woman
[2:14:45] this woman's made to play a role it's
[2:14:48] not foolish virgin role
[2:14:50] it's wise virgin role as bride of
[2:14:52] christ's role
[2:14:54] hallelujah why because it's just
[2:14:56] something it's like the woman at the
[2:14:57] well
[2:14:58] she heard a lot of sermons she was
[2:15:00] religious
[2:15:01] there's a man here from who's a jew they
[2:15:04] begin to speak we have no dealings
[2:15:05] because he just asked her for a drink
[2:15:08] and you know then then they begin to
[2:15:10] talk about worship and who dug what well
[2:15:12] and
[2:15:12] how this church was founded how this
[2:15:14] church was founded man-made digging
[2:15:16] wells and
[2:15:16] whatever more but then finally it came
[2:15:19] down to
[2:15:20] jesus said go get the husband
[2:15:24] and you know they begin to talk and she
[2:15:26] says we know where messiah cometh
[2:15:29] he'll do these things she heard a lot of
[2:15:31] preaching
[2:15:33] but something in his voice went beyond
[2:15:35] her ear
[2:15:36] and cinder is like hand and glove in her
[2:15:38] heart
[2:15:39] hallelujah remember the scrubs and
[2:15:41] pharisees heard the same kind of voice
[2:15:43] and they said this man's beelzebub but
[2:15:45] something in her said
[2:15:46] we know where messiah cometh he'll do
[2:15:48] these things
[2:15:53] he'll do these things and and he didn't
[2:15:56] explain the ministry he just said
[2:15:58] well i'm he hello
[2:16:01] why because the word that she heard
[2:16:03] something just anchored into her heart
[2:16:05] this is really you don't know what
[2:16:07] you've been looking for but this is what
[2:16:08] you've been looking for and it's found
[2:16:09] you
[2:16:10] hallelujah what was happening god was
[2:16:13] calling his bride in that first age
[2:16:15] and she just found herself she just fits
[2:16:17] the role
[2:16:18] why because she had an ear to hear
[2:16:22] right all through the church age it's
[2:16:23] been him that had an air let him hear
[2:16:24] what the spirit says to the church
[2:16:26] amen and that is the condition i mean
[2:16:28] that's what you should look at do i have
[2:16:30] an ear
[2:16:31] to hear and something in me just says
[2:16:33] well for some reason i do
[2:16:35] that's god-given that's not you given
[2:16:38] it's not because you've got perfect
[2:16:39] hearing it's got nothing to do with that
[2:16:41] it's the condition of there's a seed in
[2:16:43] your soul i mean that's been
[2:16:45] laying there and i believe has now come
[2:16:46] to life why because you heard a voice
[2:16:48] you heard the voice of the resurrection
[2:16:51] amen bringing you to life
[2:16:54] hallelujah so she just found herself
[2:16:57] i fit this role real well
[2:17:01] you can go through peter james and john
[2:17:02] they they saw a lot of rabbis their
[2:17:04] whole life was built around worship
[2:17:06] the jewish life it wasn't just a casual
[2:17:10] thing you know
[2:17:10] oh we're a secular country and no no
[2:17:15] it was their whole life was based around
[2:17:17] the feasts and different things and
[2:17:19] so they saw a lot of rabbis that they
[2:17:21] they would have heard a lot of preaching
[2:17:23] but then when one one man walked past
[2:17:25] their boat one day
[2:17:26] come follow me hand in glove
[2:17:30] i heard a voice
[2:17:33] my jesus is good amen so now we just
[2:17:36] find ourselves standing to attention
[2:17:39] hallelujah the holy spirit has been
[2:17:41] given the seed has been sowed the
[2:17:42] evening lights has been shining
[2:17:44] the sign of sodom that jesus promised is
[2:17:46] here
[2:17:48] right is here and malachi 4 was malachi
[2:17:51] 4
[2:17:52] who turned the hearts of the children
[2:17:53] back to the original faith i mean that's
[2:17:55] why we've gone back to a book of acts
[2:17:56] pentecost
[2:17:57] not on azusa street by god dwelling in
[2:17:59] his people
[2:18:00] and we've gone back before the church
[2:18:02] ages began god dwelling in his people
[2:18:04] living his word out hallelujah
[2:18:07] amen a predestinated church
[2:18:13] he says oh devil church of the living

[2:18:34] and i believe with you know this morning
[2:18:36] we're going to our source of strength
[2:18:37] the word of god we're going to our lord
[2:18:39] jesus
[2:18:39] hello and he's here to tell you do you

[2:19:07] brother brahm had someone come in the
[2:19:09] prayer line
[2:19:10] for sickness or something he says
[2:19:12] actually you have a greater need
[2:19:15] you don't know jesus do you want to
[2:19:17] become a christian before we pray
[2:19:19] they say a simple prayer says god bless
[2:19:22] you and he prays for the person
[2:19:23] it's about eight seconds it's not hard
[2:19:28] amen do you know that you you were
[2:19:31] called of god
[2:19:32] that the holy ghost reigns in your heart
[2:19:34] and every word of god is real to you

[2:19:39] of souls
[2:19:41] complexes derail them and they fail i
[2:19:43] don't believe we're built for that
[2:19:45] and even saul ended up in paradise
[2:19:49] i believe i'm looking at some davids
[2:19:51] sure david did way worse of things than
[2:19:53] saul but but god just said he's a man
[2:19:55] after my own heart
[2:19:56] there's something about david that god
[2:19:57] loved hallelujah and
[2:19:59] in spite of david's failures and his
[2:20:01] successes and his
[2:20:02] humiliation amen god didn't change his
[2:20:05] mind about david

[2:20:23] word of god is real to you
[2:20:26] oh brother how is satan going to stand
[2:20:29] against that

[2:22:21] an angel of god the holy spirit coming
[2:22:23] down moving performing signs that he did
[2:22:25] then
[2:22:26] and he's still doing that today malachi
[2:22:28] 4 promised he would send it in the last
[2:22:30] days
[2:22:30] what he promised and we see all of that
[2:22:33] right here
[2:22:34] where where he says amen i mean i mean i
[2:22:37] mean amen do you love him amen
[2:22:39] sure right here in the last days a
[2:22:41] predestinated church
[2:22:42] knowing where they're standing sowed
[2:22:44] with the seed the holy spirit
[2:22:46] in the church satan be careful
[2:22:49] hallelujah
[2:22:50] remember assyria came against many other
[2:22:52] nations but they came against the wrong
[2:22:53] one
[2:22:55] they came against the wrong people
[2:22:58] because these people had more than an
[2:23:00] idol of stoner of water of gold or some
[2:23:02] tradition passed down
[2:23:04] or some system of church they had the
[2:23:06] true and living god
[2:23:07] they had god's chosen place of worship
[2:23:09] hallelujah they had the ark of the
[2:23:11] covenant they had god there on the scene
[2:23:13] holy they're the prophet i meant to to
[2:23:15] to speak through
[2:23:17] and you know what i love brother brahm
[2:23:18] says this here and if i can
[2:23:20] just find it maybe i'll just say it
[2:23:22] buddy but it's good if you you know if i
[2:23:24] put it up but he says that the prophet
[2:23:26] of the age
[2:23:27] is the holy ghost amen
[2:23:35] you see the holy ghost here's the
[2:23:36] prophet of the day what does that mean
[2:23:38] we throw away the prophet
[2:23:39] brother braham no no that's
[2:23:42] like the same you don't throw away the
[2:23:43] bible that's the word of god
[2:23:46] right but the prophet of the day is the
[2:23:47] holy ghost
[2:23:49] amy what does he do comes down into his
[2:23:51] church
[2:23:53] discerning the thoughts intents of the
[2:23:54] heart manifests himself through a body
[2:23:57] of people
[2:23:58] remember the son of man ministry wasn't
[2:23:59] just in the prophet it's in the bride
[2:24:02] hallelujah it's a continuation of the
[2:24:03] book of acts
[2:24:05] amen just as it was all in jesus one man
[2:24:08] then it went into a body of people
[2:24:10] and we've come back around the cycle
[2:24:12] again amen let the holy spirit search
[2:24:15] your conscience
[2:24:16] this is an invisible union after the
[2:24:18] seals and when brother brown was a
[2:24:20] prophet he said this
[2:24:21] i mean search your conscience and you'll
[2:24:22] agree with daniel 5 12
[2:24:24] where the queen came in before belshazza
[2:24:26] and said she found out there was a
[2:24:28] prophet daniel who
[2:24:29] was among them and he was a dissolver of
[2:24:32] doubts
[2:24:33] you let the holy spirit hear the prophet
[2:24:35] of the day let him come into your heart
[2:24:36] right now and examine
[2:24:38] uh with the word of god and the doubts
[2:24:40] about the message will be
[2:24:42] all dissolved he dissolves all doubts
[2:24:45] you find out it's exactly on the word
[2:24:48] for this day what does it do
[2:24:51] make this puts this in its place as
[2:24:53] preeminence over the people
[2:24:55] that's what the message does hallelujah
[2:24:57] so here's the prophet of the day
[2:24:59] let the holy ghost come he'll dissolve
[2:25:00] all doubts am i gonna make it
[2:25:03] am i gonna you know there's a great fear
[2:25:04] in this day am i gonna keep my job
[2:25:07] you know there's meant to be like a w
[2:25:08] shaped recession that we're in or i
[2:25:10] don't know where we are in the first
[2:25:11] part of the w
[2:25:12] don't get me to draw it because i can't
[2:25:14] write very well but you know
[2:25:15] you know a double dipper you know
[2:25:17] recession so it puts a fear on people it
[2:25:19] puts an intimidation
[2:25:21] am i going to keep my job takes all
[2:25:23] security away
[2:25:24] and then people wonder if we're going to
[2:25:27] recession are they going to do like they
[2:25:28] did before
[2:25:29] where they use an excuse just to cut
[2:25:30] people yeah
[2:25:33] this is where we live right and so it
[2:25:36] puts a fear in people and then so now
[2:25:37] they're gonna
[2:25:38] oh i better just you know put up with
[2:25:40] you know because sometimes we have
[2:25:41] bosses that are real bad
[2:25:43] sometimes we just get put through unfair
[2:25:45] things sometimes we have great bosses i
[2:25:47] have a great boss
[2:25:49] and i've got the great boss too he's my
[2:25:51] boss
[2:25:52] but you know but but it puts a fear what
[2:25:55] what comes with intimidation
[2:25:57] fear fear of the uncertainty
[2:26:02] where the devil tries to paint a picture
[2:26:04] and this and this is the problem
[2:26:05] when when people project things like
[2:26:07] that sure it may happen but it puts a
[2:26:08] fear in people's minds
[2:26:10] most of us will be unemployed
[2:26:14] right recession brings unemployment well
[2:26:16] then what does that got
[2:26:18] then then how am i going to provide for
[2:26:20] my family
[2:26:21] what about my visa status how's this all
[2:26:23] going to happen
[2:26:25] it puts a fear but we are in a different
[2:26:29] economy
[2:26:31] the bride is in his economy
[2:26:34] he's in god's economy right david would
[2:26:37] say
[2:26:38] i've never seen the righteous forsaken
[2:26:41] nor his seed begging bread right
[2:26:45] and that was after many different he
[2:26:47] went through a lot of ups and downs ins
[2:26:48] and outs and finally he said that
[2:26:50] because he could look back at his life
[2:26:51] and said i've never seen i've never been
[2:26:52] forsaken
[2:26:54] amen so it depends how do you want your
[2:26:57] thinking to go
[2:26:58] because there's intimate there's a
[2:26:59] spirit of intimidation upon the people
[2:27:01] and fear
[2:27:02] right you have to think this kind of way
[2:27:05] but then god's here this morning saying
[2:27:07] no no no no think by the word
[2:27:10] amen think as the holy ghost thinks
[2:27:11] because we've got the mind of christ
[2:27:13] right amen
[2:27:14] hallelujah so here's hezekiah
[2:27:21] he doesn't know how this is going to go
[2:27:24] he goes to a source of strength
[2:27:27] he goes to the lord and he begins to
[2:27:29] tell
[2:27:30] tell the lord this is what's going on
[2:27:35] and then he sends his men to to to
[2:27:38] isaiah the prophet that's why i say we
[2:27:40] have a prophet today which is the holy
[2:27:41] ghost
[2:27:42] you got to go to the one that can speak
[2:27:43] to you and show you what to do
[2:27:46] and then now god speaks through isaiah
[2:27:48] the prophet speaks through the word
[2:27:50] and says he'll he he won't take the city
[2:27:53] he won't build any embankment or
[2:27:54] whatever
[2:27:55] he's going to return to his land because
[2:27:56] of a rumor and he'll die there
[2:27:59] and then the lord even seemed to blast
[2:28:00] through the host of the assyrians and
[2:28:02] killed i know what multitude of them
[2:28:04] and i and hezekiah did nothing to fight
[2:28:07] the battle
[2:28:08] physically but he fought it the right
[2:28:10] way he went to his source of strength
[2:28:12] and god
[2:28:13] came down see the problem is we try and
[2:28:15] fix it
[2:28:17] what a yo yo as i said a while ago what
[2:28:19] if he's a car consulted with his men of
[2:28:21] war
[2:28:22] they would afford a battle and they
[2:28:24] would have lost
[2:28:26] but he fought see we tried how can we
[2:28:28] fix this how can we keep it together how
[2:28:30] can we do this and this and this
[2:28:31] what's happening you're living under an
[2:28:32] intimidation
[2:28:34] because you're looking at physical
[2:28:35] circumstances but if you go to your
[2:28:37] source of strength he'll show you what
[2:28:39] to do
[2:28:40] and he won't only show you what to do he
[2:28:42] will fight your battle
[2:28:43] you know there's so many times we're in
[2:28:44] the ring with the devil fighting
[2:28:46] and the lord's on the ropes in your
[2:28:48] corner saying tag take me in
[2:28:50] tag me in i can take him tag me in
[2:28:54] and he and he's waiting he's waiting
[2:28:56] just tag
[2:28:57] but i know i've got this i can do this
[2:28:58] no no you're just like the disciples on
[2:29:00] the boat
[2:29:01] they were sailors they weren't a bunch
[2:29:03] of landlubbers happened to be on a boat
[2:29:05] going across the sea of galilee they
[2:29:06] they had done that from little
[2:29:08] boys and the wind begins to blow
[2:29:11] and the seas begin to go up and water
[2:29:13] begins to come into their boat
[2:29:16] and the reason that it got to such a
[2:29:17] death desperate state is because they
[2:29:19] believe
[2:29:19] they've got it because they're qualified
[2:29:24] but they came to the point but
[2:29:25] thankfully jesus was in the boat
[2:29:28] and brother bram even says even though
[2:29:30] you may not bring him with he's on the
[2:29:31] ramparts of glory looking down over you
[2:29:34] hallelujah so they finally got to a
[2:29:36] place because they realized because
[2:29:37] there comes a point
[2:29:39] you know there comes a point where you
[2:29:40] realize like i used to sail when i was
[2:29:42] young
[2:29:43] and there's times with there's a very
[2:29:45] thin line
[2:29:46] between flipping over and
[2:29:49] and keeping above the water stable
[2:29:51] sailing along and it comes like a split
[2:29:53] second now this is going to go bad
[2:29:55] but before that you realize no we're
[2:29:56] sweet and no doubt they came to that
[2:29:59] point
[2:30:00] and then they they stopped bailing out
[2:30:02] water they stop doing whatever they're
[2:30:03] trying to
[2:30:04] and they go wake the master he says
[2:30:06] don't you care that we perish
[2:30:09] and he's just asleep why didn't they
[2:30:11] wake him up when the first gus came
[2:30:12] across their bowel
[2:30:14] right why didn't they do that no because
[2:30:16] they thought we can handle this
[2:30:18] but they woke up the right one they
[2:30:21] didn't say okay how we're going to
[2:30:22] abandon ship boys another they woke up
[2:30:23] the master
[2:30:24] and that's what we're going to do many
[2:30:25] times wake up jesus wake up the word in
[2:30:28] your life amen don't let him slumber
[2:30:30] don't let him sleep
[2:30:31] mean wake him up say lord i'm in a
[2:30:33] desperate situation i need you to help
[2:30:35] me in this moment
[2:30:36] hallelujah and then he comes on the
[2:30:38] scene hallelujah
[2:30:41] amen the same one that said peace be
[2:30:43] still to the winds and the waves obey
[2:30:45] don't you think that he can speak to
[2:30:46] whatever's going on in your life do you
[2:30:48] think he can take control of your
[2:30:49] situation
[2:30:50] hallelujah because remember we don't
[2:30:52] have to put up with things oh god just
[2:30:54] letting character be formed
[2:30:55] sometimes it's just the devil trying to
[2:30:57] destroy us
[2:30:59] i mean sometimes just the devil trying
[2:31:01] to wipe us out hallelujah
[2:31:02] oh you just got to ride through this
[2:31:04] thing who said
[2:31:06] who said you know i like david
[2:31:10] his son with bathsheba was was was sick
[2:31:14] dying he prayed earnestly who knows the
[2:31:17] story
[2:31:19] so he didn't just he didn't he went to
[2:31:21] his source of strength
[2:31:23] right he went to a source of strength he
[2:31:24] didn't just sit there and say well i
[2:31:26] guess
[2:31:27] we just got to ride this out he
[2:31:28] interceded on behalf of his son
[2:31:30] right but even though the lord took the
[2:31:32] life of the child what did he do he
[2:31:34] washed himself
[2:31:35] went into the temple and worshiped god
[2:31:37] he didn't live in a pity party by
[2:31:39] himself amen he just worshipped the lord
[2:31:41] because he realized whatever happened to
[2:31:43] that child that was god's will
[2:31:46] and it may be a big thing to say but
[2:31:48] that's true
[2:31:49] everything that happens in our lives if
[2:31:52] we believe we're the predestinator bride
[2:31:53] of christ do you not think that monday's
[2:31:55] predestinated
[2:31:57] tuesday's predestinated i had a prang on
[2:31:59] my car predestinated
[2:32:02] i'm not feeling too well predestinated
[2:32:04] amen every
[2:32:05] part of your life is ordered our
[2:32:07] footsteps are ordered of the lord
[2:32:10] amen so he went to a source of strength
[2:32:12] i mean then god said
[2:32:14] all right let's just go to his um notice
[2:32:17] what he would say this is isaiah 37 3
[2:32:19] i'll see if i can throw that up here
[2:32:23] 37-3 isaiah would say
[2:32:28] unto him the south hezekiah
[2:32:31] this is a day of trouble
[2:32:34] and of rebuke and a blasphemy
[2:32:39] and we are living now so he's under the
[2:32:42] effect of this intimidation
[2:32:43] but he goes to a source of strength as i
[2:32:45] say we're not immune from being
[2:32:46] intimidated by a demon power
[2:32:48] but he goes to a source of strength and
[2:32:50] this is how he's thinking now now notice
[2:32:52] this next part as well
[2:32:54] for the children i come to the birth
[2:32:57] and there is no and there is not
[2:32:59] strength to bring forth so now he's
[2:33:00] saying it's like now we're in a
[2:33:01] stalemate lord
[2:33:03] the enemy's around i see no way out it's
[2:33:05] like we've come to this climax of this
[2:33:07] situation
[2:33:08] but there's no strength just to do the
[2:33:10] final push and so this is what the devil
[2:33:12] tries to get us to think there's no way
[2:33:14] out of this
[2:33:15] we're stuck in this situation but notice
[2:33:19] he says that this
[2:33:20] is a day of trouble now
[2:33:23] david would say in in in psalms 27
[2:33:26] in the time of trouble thou shalt hide
[2:33:28] me in the secret of thy pavilion
[2:33:30] and brother braham took psalm 27 and
[2:33:32] said this is the condition the world
[2:33:34] will be in
[2:33:35] and the bride will be in at the time of
[2:33:37] the rapture
[2:33:38] so we have to live in a time of trouble
[2:33:40] we have to live in
[2:33:42] in perilous times as we heard about on
[2:33:43] wednesday and you know we have to live
[2:33:45] in these
[2:33:46] because this is the condition the world
[2:33:47] will be in when we are translated
[2:33:50] shouldn't shouldn't that make us excited
[2:33:53] hallelujah but i don't want to be happy
[2:33:57] at trouble but this is just showing we
[2:33:58] would live in a day of trouble
[2:34:00] and of rebuke a rebuke is an expression
[2:34:04] of sharp disapproval or criticism
[2:34:07] and you don't have to go to someone's
[2:34:08] face to rebuke them now you just post
[2:34:10] something online
[2:34:12] right so we're living in a day of rebuke
[2:34:15] and a blasphemy
[2:34:17] what is the blasphemy of the assyrians
[2:34:19] that they would speak against hezekiah
[2:34:21] your god is like any other god
[2:34:24] you know what do they say about us today
[2:34:26] you're following a man
[2:34:29] let's just think about that for a second
[2:34:31] if people were actually honest
[2:34:33] they would acknowledge they are
[2:34:34] following somebody
[2:34:37] right the roman catholics today over a
[2:34:40] billion souls
[2:34:41] they follow a man called pope francis
[2:34:44] they're following a man right the
[2:34:47] different orthodox denominations
[2:34:49] they follow a patriarch of some
[2:34:51] description
[2:34:52] they're following a man the anglican
[2:34:55] church has the archbishop of canterbury
[2:34:57] they say he's the first among
[2:34:59] equals like the patriarchs are many
[2:35:00] orthodox denominations but he's still
[2:35:02] the head
[2:35:03] they're following a man if they were
[2:35:05] honest they would
[2:35:06] you know you're an honest anglican would
[2:35:09] say i follow the archbishop of
[2:35:10] canterbury because he's the head of
[2:35:12] their church
[2:35:15] oh no we're following jesus but you pay
[2:35:16] heed to what that man says you're
[2:35:17] following him
[2:35:20] the different branches of islam they
[2:35:23] have their great
[2:35:24] grand muftis and and ayatollahs you know
[2:35:27] which have
[2:35:28] various degrees of superiority and
[2:35:30] they're also following a man they say we
[2:35:32] follow the prophet muhammad
[2:35:34] the buddhists have the dalai lama two
[2:35:36] two two varying degrees
[2:35:38] i've just spoke about the vast majority
[2:35:40] of the seven billion souls upon the
[2:35:42] earth
[2:35:43] the atheists they follow darwin although
[2:35:45] follow richard dawkins or one of the
[2:35:47] great intellectual thinkers of the day
[2:35:49] why because they lit there because they
[2:35:52] let the teachings of those men
[2:35:54] be the greatest influence in their lives
[2:35:57] right it's it's it's the one that
[2:35:59] influences you the most
[2:36:01] is the one that you're being led by amen
[2:36:05] so some people unfortunately only follow
[2:36:07] william branham
[2:36:09] and they and and and and they get under
[2:36:11] a delusion
[2:36:13] where brother graham's told up in heaven
[2:36:14] all that ever loved you
[2:36:16] and your love will be there so they say
[2:36:18] oh i love the prophet therefore i'm
[2:36:20] going to heaven that
[2:36:21] that ain't going to cut it friends we go
[2:36:23] to heaven because we're under the blood
[2:36:24] filled with the holy ghost
[2:36:26] well it's not because we love a man that
[2:36:27] lived 50 60 years ago though we love the
[2:36:29] prophet right
[2:36:30] but but eliezer did not get rebecca to
[2:36:33] fall in love with him
[2:36:34] eliezer's job was to get rebecca to fall
[2:36:36] in love with isaac
[2:36:37] right and that's what the prophet's
[2:36:38] message came to do when you receive it
[2:36:40] in the right spirit
[2:36:42] you won't be caught up in the man you'll
[2:36:43] be caught up in the lord jesus christ
[2:36:46] the one that the man pointed you to
[2:36:50] amen but if people say oh you're
[2:36:52] following a man well i'll okay then
[2:36:54] this is written by how many authors
[2:36:55] about 16
[2:36:57] right so so if if i'm a new testament
[2:37:00] christian
[2:37:02] i'm following the apostle paul i'm
[2:37:05] following peter james and john
[2:37:07] i'm following timothy i'm whoever wrote
[2:37:10] a book i'm following moses because i
[2:37:12] believe moses words
[2:37:13] right i believe all the all the writers
[2:37:16] so i'm following them yeah if i'm honest
[2:37:19] so why is it crazy to say i follow i
[2:37:22] believe a prophet's message
[2:37:24] oh you're following a man well everyone
[2:37:26] else's
[2:37:27] i'd rather i'd rather follow a
[2:37:29] vindicated prophet
[2:37:30] that people said they saw jesus in him
[2:37:33] you know i heard um someone speaking
[2:37:35] about
[2:37:36] you know when brother brown was about to
[2:37:37] go to israel
[2:37:39] because um because israel believes their
[2:37:41] prophets
[2:37:43] and and i think it was louis petras i
[2:37:45] think it was who was a
[2:37:46] great leader of you know the pentecostal
[2:37:48] movement in in europe
[2:37:50] he had a million bibles printed in i
[2:37:52] think in hebrew and sent there
[2:37:54] before brother brown was going now you
[2:37:56] think about it this is at the height of
[2:37:57] the healing revival why did they not get
[2:38:00] someone else to go
[2:38:02] to show them jesus christ why they pick
[2:38:04] out him
[2:38:06] because they saw the sign of the messiah
[2:38:08] they saw more than a healing gift
[2:38:10] they saw jesus christ living in a man so
[2:38:14] i think i'll take him
[2:38:16] above someone's opinion or or some
[2:38:18] critics idea
[2:38:20] hey man that's just me so you know they
[2:38:23] say you're just following a man like
[2:38:25] anyone else
[2:38:26] you know and i didn't cover the mormons
[2:38:27] or but you know i'm pretty sure you can
[2:38:29] agree i've covered most of the seven
[2:38:31] billion souls on the earth
[2:38:32] they follow someone
[2:38:36] amen
[2:38:40] so you see the intimidation there is a
[2:38:43] subtle intimidation today
[2:38:46] which is actually quite real it's either
[2:38:49] agree with the majority
[2:38:51] or you'll be boycotted you'll be
[2:38:52] cancelled and brother brown said i don't
[2:38:55] have the quotes on me but he says he'll
[2:38:56] come a boycott which is the marking of
[2:38:58] the beast
[2:38:58] you can't buy or sell and here we are
[2:39:01] yes
[2:39:02] we're living in this hour
[2:39:05] amen but we need to be like the
[2:39:06] disciples amen
[2:39:10] after their great threatenings now here
[2:39:12] was here we are back with the
[2:39:13] formerly crippled lame man who's now
[2:39:16] a piece of evidence in a court trial his
[2:39:19] life has been changed forever
[2:39:21] and then they and then they now now this
[2:39:24] is just me
[2:39:26] but after this where they're told that
[2:39:28] you know they must never preach in his
[2:39:29] name again
[2:39:30] because the man who's over 40 was there
[2:39:33] i believe he went with him into a prayer
[2:39:34] meeting
[2:39:36] remember he found himself caught up in
[2:39:39] this great clash
[2:39:41] remember when we first meet the lord
[2:39:43] everything is wonderful
[2:39:45] the sky is bluer the grass is greener
[2:39:47] the flowers are more flowerier you know
[2:39:48] everything's lovely
[2:39:49] you know because you just get saved he
[2:39:52] becomes real
[2:39:54] your sins are all washed away everyone's
[2:39:56] awesome
[2:39:57] everything is awesome this is how he was
[2:40:00] i was sitting here
[2:40:01] you know it's amazing he got carried to
[2:40:02] that spot no doubt he walked past that
[2:40:04] spot
[2:40:04] imagine that feeling he yeah he got
[2:40:07] carried to the gate beautiful
[2:40:08] he runs through the gate and maybe he
[2:40:10] walks back through the gate
[2:40:13] and then every time he'd walk past that
[2:40:14] he say i used to sit here
[2:40:17] i sat here that was my seat you see how
[2:40:19] those stones are slightly
[2:40:20] there's an indentation i made that
[2:40:22] indentation that was me
[2:40:24] you see that drinking problem i used to
[2:40:26] have that drinking problem you see that
[2:40:27] last problem i had that
[2:40:29] you see this this is where i used to sit
[2:40:31] i mean this this pride
[2:40:32] is where i used to sit i used to think i
[2:40:34] was the bee's knees is where i used to
[2:40:35] sit
[2:40:36] but then one day one day the lord came
[2:40:39] my way
[2:40:40] i said silver and gold have a number
[2:40:41] such as i have give i unto thee in the
[2:40:43] name of jesus christ
[2:40:44] raise up and walk and i went walking and
[2:40:46] leaping and praising god
[2:40:48] hallelujah glory and so here he was
[2:40:51] everything's awesome and he's brought
[2:40:53] into this court trial
[2:40:55] any any and then no doubt humanly say
[2:40:57] i'm part of this
[2:40:59] i'm not a spectator i'm actually the the
[2:41:01] evidence
[2:41:02] i'm the reason these guys are mad he's
[2:41:05] not just watching i'm the reason these
[2:41:06] guys are mad
[2:41:07] why does the devil get mad because god
[2:41:09] works in your life
[2:41:11] hallelujah we are living evidence and
[2:41:13] i'll try and wrap up with this
[2:41:14] you know so here he is and then now he's
[2:41:17] got a
[2:41:17] but now this is pressure come on what
[2:41:20] are we going to do
[2:41:22] and they said we're just going to serve
[2:41:23] god then they went to their source of
[2:41:26] strength
[2:41:27] and they began to pray they told the
[2:41:29] disciples they told the church this is
[2:41:31] just what happened to us
[2:41:32] oh praise the lord that man's walking
[2:41:34] here he is and he began to meet people
[2:41:36] he'd never seen before maybe
[2:41:38] and he finds now they begin to pray and
[2:41:41] call on god and say why do the heathen
[2:41:43] rage and you know
[2:41:44] people imagine a vain thing and all
[2:41:45] those things and as the people praying
[2:41:47] one heart one mind one accord the holy
[2:41:49] ghost came back down
[2:41:51] and refilled them and now this man that
[2:41:54] was just crippled and he felt the power
[2:41:55] of god strengthen his legs
[2:41:57] now that power that healed him now came
[2:41:59] and lived on the inside of him
[2:42:01] hallelujah now now this is just me
[2:42:02] hallelujah so now now he's there in this
[2:42:04] prayer meeting and the intimidation he
[2:42:06] was feeling in the trial
[2:42:08] vanished why because because they just
[2:42:12] god just proved
[2:42:13] i'm in this i'm in this i meant what
[2:42:16] you're doing
[2:42:17] you're actually a witness of me
[2:42:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:42:21] and that's why we need to go to our
[2:42:22] source of our strength
[2:42:24] holly and go to god say god i have
[2:42:26] trouble he's a car said this is a time
[2:42:28] of trouble a day of trouble
