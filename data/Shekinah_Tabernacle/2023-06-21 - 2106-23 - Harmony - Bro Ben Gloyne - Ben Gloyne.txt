glad you're happy to be a Christian tonight amen let's um let's go to the word let's open our scriptures and read from Exodus 17 we're going to read verse 11 to 13. and um it means we're just going to I want to speak on Harmony tonight this may seem a bit of an odd text to open with uh but I just kind of I was walking along the riverbank a couple of days ago and uh this just you know it's good when the Lord kind of talks to you as you look up walk along the way I enjoy those moments I mean so um Exodus 17 and 11 and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed this is of course Israel fighting the amalekites but Israel but Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and Moses and Hurst stayed up his hands uh the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down to the Sun and Joshua discomforted amalek and his people with the edge of the sword amen let's um let's go to prayer tonight after we've read the word if you've got a need you just want to raise your hands to the Lord amen we've got a couple of prayer requests come through got brother Joel last season you know he's got his court case tomorrow so I want to remember him in prayer um we've got uh from brother matu so the lane family this is a Nelson remember them in prayer brother Ross and sister Kay and also brother Andrew wise who's the pastor down there to keep him in prayer as well so I'm so thankful God is a prayer answering God Amen and there's not many two needs we can't over overwhelm him with our needs uh and you're thankful amen I feel one and a half needs overwhelm me but a million and two will never overwhelm our god so amens let's just go before the throne of grace tonight in prayer amen gracious Heavenly Father we want to thank you so much that we can approach your throne Lord not by anything we could ever do Lord but it's your blood Lord Jesus that gives us access so we're so thankful and as your word is has has encouraged us to boldly become before your throne so we come boldly before your throne tonight Lord we just want to ask

to them please Lord Jesus touch their hearts like only you can we commit Our Lives into your hands we're so thankful we can bow our heads in your presence Lord and surrender Our Lives into your hands oh God so have your way Lord For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen hey man God bless you friends you might have your seats tonight so they're saying I want to talk about Harmony now now there was a Harmony between between what was going on on the mountain and what was going on on the battlefield and as I've said uh you know um a few Services ago that you know this this represents victory amen where where Moses hands were lifted up and when his hands were raised Israel was winning the battle when his hands went down Israel was losing the battle so it wasn't the victory wasn't based on the quality of the soldier it wasn't how how well Israel was trained it wasn't how good their weapons were you know no that had nothing to do with it the reason they were winning is when Moses hands were raised and we know that Samson's hands were raised between two pillars and dagon's Temple one day and he won a great Victory because he was willing to surrender and say let me die with my enemy and he and he killed more in his death than he did in his life as the same thing with you and I friends that we when we really die out to ourselves and let God take over you'll see more victories than you ever had in your entire life and we know that the greatest victory was won that down Calvary where now messiah's hands were raised like this and we know it wasn't the Roman's hands that you know it wasn't the Roman nails that held his hands there it was his love for you and I amen but he didn't just conquer a natural enemy he conquered whole death in the grave amen but you see there's a Harmony between what was going on in the battlefield and what was going on on the mountain top and and that should that that is how it should be between us and our Lord that there should be such a Harmony between us and God that his great victory that he won amen should be manifested in our lives but the only way that that can happen is when we are fully surrendered to his word so so who wants Harmony amen who wants Harmony between you and God Amen you know that Harmony will now come down into your life into your family amen so the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 that for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father or my father my father the spirit itself beareth witness the with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ears ears of God join ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with them we may also be glorified together now the reason his Spirit Beth witness with ours is because we agree with his word I mean it's it's it's such a Paramount thing that the holy ghost that wrote the Bible through maybe many different authors over many big space of time was the same God writing the same word amen but through different vessels but I was still the same author writing it so now if if the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible and the Holy Ghost is within us we cannot disagree with his word I mean we cannot we cannot fuss against his word we cannot say it's not true because if the spirit in US is the spirit that wrote the Bible there'll be the spirit answer will say Amen to every word of God and that's how we have harmony with God as when this Holy Spirit comes within us then everything in our life will say Amen to that word the word may expose us and say hey you've got to surrender you've got this besetting sin in your life it may test um strips off your back spiritually but you'll say Amen to it amen hallelujah so it's so Paramount that we always have a spirit that bears witness with the word of God amen because it's very eerie fair to say well my spirit his Spirit Bears witness with me but how does that come down to manifestation it's when the spirit in you says Amen to the word doesn't say Amen to culture doesn't say Amen says to someone else says or some tradition or something we learn but it's Amen to the word of God now I see this 365 of the fear knots or don't be afraid in the Bible's here's one this is something that I didn't get to on Sunday but I thought just to put it in my notes it says here and when we and when I saw him this is John the Revelator when he's in the character the spirit on the Lord's Day he sees the glorified Christ he says I fell down at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death so here's the mighty conqueror amen revealed you know he was John he lay on Jesus bosom he ate with him you know he he was in the ship with him he slept with them he he journeyed with him all these things he didn't fall down as dead in that Ministry but then when he saw him he was glorified form he fell down as a dead man because he was such an awesome yo his presence was so awesome but then you see his right hand Christ's right hand of power came upon him said fear not I'm the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of Helen of death see women walk in harmony with God this is what God wants us to know in great trials don't fear I'm just going to continue a bit from Sunday we're just going to merge all the surface into one right you know don't fear Amen in great times of trouble fear not God has not called us to be fearful amen you know sir because this is what the mighty conqueror wants us to know because remember when we have fully full confidence in God I believe will stand harmony with him because we have full confidence in our ship but he'll guide us through good times Hard Times confusing times he'll guide us through every every time amen but if we don't have confidence in him then Harmony will be broken why because we'll try and take the situation back into our own hands I mean but if we have full confidence in him we'll commit it all fully to him and he'll lead us through Amen brother Bram says this now no human being could stand the full effect of that Vision his strength utterly Gone John fell at his feet as though dead by the hand of the Lord and love touched him and the voice of the blessing said fear not don't be afraid I'm the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more what is there to fear the Judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus I think we should go happy shouldn't we hallelujah amen why because remember he took your judgment that's why we don't have to go to through a Great Tribulation the bride doesn't go through the Great Tribulation she goes in the Rapture before that time why because the Judgment that the world receives he received it for us on Calvary amen and because we take the fullness of his atonement his word amen we don't go to that place we go on a rapture glory to God I mean so the Wrath that was put out upon him that we should have received I mean it was put out upon Him aren't you glad he went he died as a sinner in your place he went to hell so you don't have to go praise God Amen he died lost so you don't have to die lost hallelujah amen I'm so thankful he died forsaken that we'll never die forsaken I'm so what a good exchange eh what a good deal Hallelujah there's no there's no sub Clauses and this is just all good praise the Lord amen now see for a surety our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge as judge the case is settle that is finished now there is therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us we can just stop there and just think about that for a second what promises he not has he what promise has he ever failed to manifest here in our lives amen he's he's healed the sick he's given the Holy Ghost amen he's cast out demons he's brought prodigals home amen he's brought peace amen he's brought Joy amen he's manifest every promise in his word the only thing we haven't seen is the physical resurrection of the Dead I believe he can do it don't you I mean but what promises he failed to manifest in our midst Hallelujah praise God as true as isn't he a god of his word he is the amen amen and he amends his word he has the final say Amen means so be it Hallelujah he's not afraid of any promise that he's given amen why should it why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome amen now here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered Both Worlds of the scene and unseen not like Alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and you no other way to turn for further Conquest so he died a victim of sin and righteous living not like Napoleon who conquered all of Europe but finally Was Defeated at Waterloo and banished to Alba only to find himself conquered but nothing could conquer Christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell in the grave and as and has the keys thereof what he loses is loose and what he binds is bound there's no changing for it there is no conqueror before him and there is none beside him he alone is the savior the Redeemer he's the only God in the Lord Jesus Christ is his name don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are here too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all powers given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word that I will and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail Hallelujah praise our God Amen and you know you read mark 16. Jesus gives the Great Commission to the church and that last verse of that says and and and the Lord went with them manifesting the word right see so what is he doing there he's he's performing that which he promised amen that you speak the word in our performance that is my Covenant and it can never fail so he's not he's not set us up for failure this is not a setup for failure I mean this Christian walk no he has not come to give us fear and failure but love courage and ability Hallelujah he's given us ability in every situation he's given us courage to withstand amen his love is far above the love of human being amen so he's given us all these things that we would overcome every situation amen but the but the thing is we need to trust him in every situation see he is the unfailing one right we fail many times but he's the unveiling one I mean so if we just keep our confidence in him therefore I believe if we do that we can stay in harmony with him see it's not God never God never loses his position he never gets himself out of the way it's man who who wanders off the path it's man who actually forgets their position so it's God always remains faithful even when we are not that's what the Bible says let's see is if we can just stay in harmony just love the Lord I mean was he giving us love to do love him in every circumstance amen Praise Him in the storm give him glory when things are good give him glory when things are bad Hallelujah this is what he wants us to do and you thankful we can do that amen what do you do abilities to stand in every situation like Shadrach me and the baby go they're given the ability to stand they had no vision they had nothing apart from the word of God and they said we are going to stay in harmony with this word that says you're not bow yourself to any Graven image Hallelujah to me the greatest Victory really yo we say about the Fourth Man In The Fire that's incredible but even if they got burnt up it was still been an incredible story because they didn't bow to any of the pressure of the age amen remember it wasn't just something done in a back alley that they were coming under the influence of it was the king trying to make them bow it was quite a procession it was quite an occasion but they had already made up their minds we're standing with this word so they were in harmony with the word and then God backed up the word Hallelujah see we want to be in harmony being in harmony is something the devil knows nothing about hell is full of fighting one devil can't get along with another they may be fighting for the same team but really it's just like Parliament during question time you know and really all the parliamentarians they say well I'm National I'm labor I'm greens I'm whatever they're all really they're ready to stick the knife in each other's back they won the top job that's just kind of like hell I'm sorry you know we pray for our Parliament do we not we pray for our leader the Bible says we should do so right but it's all fussing and fighting and you know it's a bunch of 12 year olds and you know actually that's an insult of 12 year olds you know I'm sure they can get along better than that but you know they're all they're all fragmented and it's because the enemy doesn't know anything about what Harmony really is because Fallen man doesn't know what Harmony really is sure we can agree maybe in principle of some things but there's no true Harmony it may be just Harmony and the same kind of thinking even the spirit but it takes God to unify Body Soul and Spirit together as one amen and when and when a people are in harmony that's actually that's actually Eden restored in a family this is what we want to have amen any man in his family a good Noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right that family is broken somewhere they should all be one father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture who wants to see that kind of picture sure we can you know brother bam says it's like him and his siblings they used to fight in the backyard you can have disagreements you can have these things but when someone came against the Brandon family they were unified in the front yard I mean so it can be the same kind of thing we can have trouble you know disagreements and mama she did this and they did this and he said but but then when when someone comes against the family we're shoulder to shoulder amen you may have a black eye from your sibling in the back lawn just a moment ago but if someone comes against the family hey we're together on this one and it should be the same thing with the children of God Hallelujah sure we'll have disagreements we've had disagreements we'll have more in the future I'm glad no interrupted an appraisal Logistics but you see we're family I mean we can look beyond the natural amen we can look beyond the Flesh and identify we are all part of the same Jesus Christ amen I trust you can see that when you see your brother your sister look beyond what you see with the five senses should be able to discern they are part of the same body I am part of amen and if we can look Beyond then we can see a family that's United something that the devil knows nothing about and cannot manifest but if we're in harmony with God we'll be in harmony with one another I believe amen see that's God's purpose and his purpose was father Supreme as one as to be one with his family Earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way they could ever be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them them with each other and God they all they became all one isn't that a beautiful picture God and his family father over all Supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never a sick never a heartache just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one amen why because God's nature was in them so walking in harmony with God now we know how people leave God as God as as people leave his word it's really quite simple it doesn't matter what they profess if you leave God's word you've left him because he is his word he doesn't compromise for nothing because his word is who he is so if we want to stay in harmony with God we're going to we need to stay harmony with his word amen and we know that that is not a lining up of rules and Ticking boxes because people can do that and just be totally dead on the inside right but if that same nature of God the Holy Ghost is within you and there's something within you that will want to line up with his word because you love him amen your motivation is love it's not fair or fail or anything but because you love him you want to live his word amen and that's how we stay in harmony with God now brother Brown would um yo was it Jack Moore one of the brothers he knew very well he said one of the most outstanding messages that he ever preached at Shreveport he preached there A lot of times was the lamb and the dove and brother Bram after he preached that he said one of the most outstanding anointings that ever came upon a service when he preached that service and to me it's one of the most fundamental principles of Christianity I'm going to come to the quote soon but you know one of the most fundamental principles of Christianity is the same nature that's in God is in us and that's the only way we can be in harmony with his word if the nature of the word is in you and I that's why Jesus when he went to the river John to be baptized by John John look beyond what Jesus looked like he looked like any other man but John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he identified prophetically that he was a man with the nature of a lamb Hallelujah and then when Jesus was baptized John saw the spirit of God descend upon him like a dove now we know the nature of a dove and a lamb of the same nature it wasn't it wasn't a raven coming down God never rippers out as a as a raven he was a he was a dove and he was a lamb very Meek Natures if Jesus had the nature of a wolf a dove would never come and descend upon a wolf nature because they're contrary Natures but because they were the same kind of nature the spirit of God could come down and dwell in him that's what we want isn't it that's what we want amen tonight amen is to have a lamb lamb nature not a wolf nature we're all born with a wolf nature fussing and fighting in life you don't need to teach a child to lie you don't need to teach them to steal that's just built within them why it's a wolf nature or a fallen nature you don't need to teach them those things right and Fallen man the older they get the more crafty they get in stealing cheating lying defrauding doing all those things but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes into a soul of a person it changes their nature from Wolf to lamb I mean where it's God's nature takes over and then the spirit of God can descend upon that person and dwell on them I'm so thankful that there is a power in this room that can change the nature of a person amen from a wolf to a lamb amen from a fallen nature of man to God's divine nature Hallelujah aren't you glad for that amen that's what Calvary was done to achieve Amen to take our sins away that God can dwell in us once again that was the purpose of the Messiah giving his life for you and I Hallelujah so we need to have we need to have a nature of a lamb amen for the dove of the Holy Ghost to come back Upon Us amen see he's the son same way someone that came the same one that came down on the day of Pentecost and led the church is the same holy spirit that came down upon uh that came down upon the first lamb at Jordan it's the same one that leads today amen and he will never lead you out of his word he will always lead you within this word this Bible amen he'll never take you outside of the pages of it amen when someone says that they're a Christian and says we don't need the Bible no more I wouldn't trust that person amen if someone says the Bible's not their absolute I'll be wary of those people brother Brown said the Bible was as absolute therefore the Bible is my absolute as well we know the message reveals Christ in the Bible we understand those things but you know we have an absolute word we don't have Creeds of dogmas I mean we have the word of God Amen Hallelujah and you see we have the word of God there and because we have the word of God and the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the word will manifest itself in our lives Hallelujah only glad for that praise the Lord amen I'm just trying to go and 12th gear you know so just keep up with me amen jump on board it's a free ride I remember you say it's very important that we have a lamb nature who knows what it's like to be carnal you know when you're carnal and you know when you're not carnal right never try and justify yourself when you carnal you're on a hiding to nowhere that's when because remember this thing needs changing right when the body change happens I think the older ones will be the happiest ones not because necessarily because this thing is getting wore out and you've got to drag it up and you pull muscles just getting out of bed in the morning but you know but because you've been wrestling with this human nature and you've seen God come on the scene time and time again but then you go into a carnal State and you hate yourself and then you repent and then you go back into Walking with God again and you know there's a wrestle right but thanks be to God the Holy Ghost changes our nature and gives us overcoming power over this thing but it depends who we yield our members to is that the one who will lead us amen so do we want a wolf or do we want a lamb lamb I like lamb I don't like wolf you know you take like husky dogs you know they can be pulling the same sled but something can go wrong they'll turn on each other and kill each other if they can hunting dogs different ones it's in the nature just to devour each other so I can scare one they'll attack the one or the owner or whatever more see we don't want to be like that but that's how humans can be something goes wrong they start the blame game blame shifting and they start tearing each other apart but the lamb nature can't do that it's not in its nature see amen so if that Nature's within us we just can't do it yeah well turn the other cheek amen we'll have a soft answer that turns away Wrath Hallelujah we will go pray for the those that despitefully use us we will love the unlovable amen I'm glad we can be like that not by our own ability but by his ability hallelujah amen so we need the Holy Ghost to lead us now I mean when we get in harmony now with now don't just just I hope I don't sound like I'm saying you get the Holy Ghost in you get in Harmony when you get the Holy Ghost you're in harmony okay so don't put it way off in the future I don't like that kind of preaching it's now it's here the Bible says today is the day of salvation today he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so yeah don't don't just get that out of your thinking if if you think I'm talking about two things here it's the same thing okay so and the church has to do the same thing get out of that group of rejecters come into the promise before Messiah can never be manifested before them you see it the life of the Messiah manifested making a church ready a bride a woman can marry a man and disagreeing with him it would be some kind of a fuss continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend his espoused when they are in Perfect Harmony like one Soul one mind because they're going to be one flesh then when the church can get in such a harmony with God until the manifestation of the bridegroomers manifesting the bride because they're going to be one oh what a great lesson he said see and this is this is where we're at friends this is where we're at amen we've been we've been here for a while actually don't don't put this off in the future well one day when I'm good enough for long enough and I'll be in harmony no no we've graduated you've thrown your cap in the air your significance in your hand you've walked long shaken the guy's hand and you've gone on run Hallelujah we've Grant if if you've given your life to the Lord like really giving you I've and he's filled you with the Holy Ghost you've graduated sure you have a you know you'll be maturing and growing from that day on but remember all power of Heaven and Earth is actually by the Holy Ghost is in you the rapture's in you already amen all overcoming Powers within you already if you really have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and the ability to be in harmony with God that he can manifest himself through you is in you because he's in you remember the Holy Ghost is not a part of the godhead he is the god here they're not three they're one right the fullness of God here bodily dwelt in Jesus Christ we know that amen so and the same one that came into Jesus in The River Jordan the fullness of God here bodily came down in the upper room and filled the disciples and he spread within his church and he's the same one today amen not a different God the same one amen you see there's a great promise many times people get in their minds the devil twisted their minds that you know if you really give your life to the Lord you know life will be no fun no really life really starts when you meet him amen a whole world opens up that you've never even seen before fed them before amen and it's a glorious walk it's not an easy walk all the time but life's not easy anyway you ask Elon Musk if you ever get a chance has it been easy he'll say no he's basically 24 7 or 27 hours a day he's played crams that many into his you know he's working he's trying he's putting effort in he's losing money making money upsetting a whole bunch of people we're not ordained to upset a whole bunch of people but just walk with God but you know but but he'd say no this took effort this this just wasn't handed to me and it's not all glamorous but people think man he's really he's going to Mars I'm going to heaven holy I trust you've got your ticket too people want to go to Mars they want to go in the sub-orbital flight I just want to take a flight that I go from this Dimension to the next amen like brother Braham said people are trying to get people on the moon this is back in the 50s and 60s saying this we've got to met we've had National in heaven for 2 000 years hallelujah amen so I've got a better ride than him coming up I trust he joins me it'll be good but you know people think that you know there's there there's no excitement really compared to the world we have no excitement we actually have a far greater excitement you know a spirit of entertainment will just really drag you down it will never it'll never leave you satisfied maybe for a season it will but there'll come in emptiness and you'll seek after something else and you'll seek after something else and you'll seek after that other thing and the other thing won't satisfy you like the first 12. I'm listening to this band now and then another one I'm watching this platform this one this one this one trying to fill a void that cannot be filled by that kind of stuff it doesn't satisfy is the world Happy this is the most entertained age that the world has ever been in is it happy no it's the most unhappy world that's ever been anyway you see better walk with God is far more better than being entertained by an evil spirit amen it's far more satisfying it's far more rewarding all this in Heaven Too Hallelujah praise God Amen but you see now to be separated to the Lord people think well you there's a lot of things you can't do in life actually there's a lot of things I can do in life I can actually do anything I want but God changed my nature there's a lot of things I just won't go near because it's like a little kid that just doesn't like broccoli they just don't like it it's not in them to like it I remember I was that age I remember sitting at the table and seeing food for the first time and saying I don't like it and then and then the earth goes around the Sun a few years and here I am on the other end of that saying Eat Your Greens eat this food and you see this little face saying I don't want it I know where they got that but you see when a nature changes Hallelujah when a nature changes then hey give me the greens I need it you know I know it's good for me hallelujah amen you know why because there's been a change in the nature the same thing with the things of God Colonel nature says I don't want it there's nothing to it but let God get a hold of you once and you say Lord I love your presence I love knowing you Lord amen hallelujah so what agreement has the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as he has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I'll be their God and they shall be my people amen wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord that's not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I'll be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and my daughter saith the Lord Almighty amen so this is a great benefit from to being separated to God that God can walk in us he can live through us he can talk through us and if he does that then Harmony comes in or rather that is perfect harmony amen and then that Harmony now can come into the family it's not the father with his own selfish little Hobbies pulling this way you know and then the mother pulling this way trying to do what she wants to do and then trying to use the trying to convince the children that they're the better one parents would not mean to be politicians trying to get our children's vote vote for me I'm way more fun than that guy or votes me and wait mom she's boring I'm way more cooler vote for me but but saying it and doing it in such a way that they don't like this other spouse that's actually demonic we shouldn't be like that at all we should be saying to our children like I tell I tell my girls they can vouch for this I say you got the greatest mom in the world there's no one like her she's the best I say in all the lands and there's a lot of lands that's what I say and I mean it why because they need to appreciate it appreciate her and they need to realize I love worth everything within me and I appreciate it right and that's how we should be it's like with you and the Lord isn't it he's the greatest one ever we should all be his biggest fan Hallelujah amen that that's how we should feel and about one another we say they're the greatest bunch of people sure there's people like us all around the world we're not the only ones thank God but this should be something in us and I should feel and I feel everyone should feel this about their home church it's the best one not that we compare right but they should be something to say I love this family of God sure I love to travel see other families of God around the world and through the country but this one there's no place like home Hallelujah amen you see now there should be something within us that punctuates every word with an amen it's so vital that there's that we do not fight against the word of God if we want Harmony see it's easy to say we've got Harmony praise God but what about when it comes down to the nitty-gritty and even simple things like water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ that the prophet says you don't even need Revelation for you just read Matthew 28 19. it says baptize in the name of the father son Holy Ghost and then you go to Acts chapter 2 and Peter says what that name is because I'm a father I'm a son I'm a brother I'm an uncle I'm a nephew I'm all kinds of things but that's not my name my name is Benjamin John Glenn so when Jesus said baptized in the name of the father son Holy Ghost one name Peter came the same Jesus that was speaking in Matthew 28 came and dwelt in his church and he said repent to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for a mission of sin there's no contradiction the same Jesus in Matthew is the same Jesus and acts remember the book of Acts is the acts of the Holy Ghost and the apostles it's not the acts the apostles like people say they didn't do those things they were cowards hidden in the upper room but then the other day of Pentecost they went out with boldness Hallelujah so now there should be something within us that punctuates that word and says amen and we can go through hundreds of those those kind of things we're just going to leave it with that one but there should be something within us that doesn't fight against the word of God if the spirit in US fights against the word we need to get rid of that Spirit when he realized that spirit is our enemy it's not our friend amen because any spirit that stops you fulfilling the word of God is not the Holy Ghost it's really that simple like um Christine's dead Albert he was baptized in the titles came among believers he saw people should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he was wrestling in himself about it then he thought to himself what is trying to stop me fulfilling the word so he got baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ yes that's not rocket science we need to think about these things what what stops US what stops us because we've got to realize that God this harmony actually God hates disharmony we could go through you know there's a statue of the perfect man in the Bible there's also the statue of the imperfect man right you go on Proverbs and things there's actually the statue of the imperfect man we don't have time to go through it tonight but part of that is actually breaking up Brotherhood lies malice all those things and so God hates the spirit of this Unity he hates factions and fussing and fighting and building walls and well I won't talk to this group I won't talk to these people no we should never have that kind of a kind of an attitude you say well they don't believe the same way as you and I if you've got a revelation you can go anywhere you shouldn't be afraid amen I'll talk to him later you see this should be such a Harmony between believers birds of a feather flock together Steve says hi I can't decline this okay we'll leave that alone hopefully but there should be such a Unity Among Us we should love everybody doesn't matter what they've done you can still love them you've done a lot of bad things yourself but Jesus look Beyond those and loved you anyhow amen but you see Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft see and your and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry this is what the Lord says about these things so many times we think of witches stirring a big cauldron with a big pointed hat but really actually a lot of Witchcraft can just be people who look like message people who are actually stubborn and rebellious against the word of God because they've got a spirit that doesn't bear witness with the Holy Ghost we don't want to be in that kind of group we say Lord I want my spirit to say Amen to your word if I'm wrong I'm wrong Lord but you're here to make me right and I want to be right Hallelujah this is how we want to be now I'm going to kind of wrap up soon with this I know I've been going a bit quick but brother Brown was was inspired and he wrote what he called the word to the church and this is just a part of it he says from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride she'll be Verge she is a version of his word she's virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas and buying through the members of the Bride will be manifested all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin the words of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word was the promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9 and 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of her because she accepted his word to her the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will be his potentials as he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our own heads see to raise this hand I don't need to say hand raised now then my hand thinks about it and decides I should do it it just doesn't right I step here it just happens there's not a there's not a committee meeting and all the nerves in my hand to say well should we really do this one I'm tired I don't feel like you know no it just happens right it's the same thing with the bride of Jesus Christ if we're in harmony with him whatever his word says do we do if we've gotta forgive someone this is something in us that can't hold it anymore we've got to if we're gonna go make something right we just need to go do it amen we may be looking at something on our phone something that displeases him and so I'm going to say is we should stop watching that we put it down amen we get a bit stubborn we get we think we've made it and we get full of Pride and all these things something gonna says I don't like that anymore you shouldn't be that way praise God Amen all power belongs and they are subject to him as the members of our body are subject to our heads notice the harmony between the father and the son Jesus never did now this is really where my thought came from Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5 19. this harmony is now to exist before the groom and his bride John 5 19 as the son can do nothing till he sees a father do it and that what the father does the son does likewise right so he was led Jesus because remember Jesus though he was the god man we understand that right he wasn't a Jew he wasn't a gentile it was God made flesh right it was more than just a Jew we're not saved by Jewish blood we're not saved by Gentile blood we're saved by the blood of God amen and so now but you see he had to conform himself to be a human to be like us to be our Kinsmen Redeemer see at the limit as understanding limit himself exactly as we are limited we don't know the future Jesus said it's not given to me to know only the Father in heaven right he was led by Vision amen amen you know you can see that in the gospels right but you see now as he was led by the and he said it's not me that do it the works of the father dwelt in me he do he does the works right so now Jesus was led by the spirit of God within him and so what he was led to do he did it that's why he went to the pool of Bethesda there were multitudes of sickler but he's led to one man why because he is led by a vision to that one man when he went to the well by Samaria where the woman came the woman at the well we call her he was led there he says I need to go by the way of Samaria he saw it by Vision he went there and saw the vision fulfilled praise God you say well I don't see Visions but you do have the Holy Ghost we're not all called to see visions right but we do all should have the Holy Ghost leading us amen we have his word that guides us so this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride was in uh has the mind of Christ if she knows what he wants done with the word now that may sound a bit cryptic but we know what he was done with his word in other words we know he's not three he's one we know how to baptize right we know how to dress a way that pleases him we know how to treat each other the right way that's that's us knowing what he wants done with his word we know how to treat the people to treat everyone in the Earth with love and consideration yeah right right we know not the whole grudges we know not to fuss and fight and and and and spread gospel and Malice amen that's all part of his word we know those things don't we if you've got the mind of Christ then you know what he wants and then what is also what he does once done with his word he wants his word to have preeminence over us that's not our Humanity that leads us it's his word that leads us right that's exactly what he does uh once done amen he doesn't be because what's happened is man has taken his word put it to one side and taken Creed and dogmas and traditions and made that be the head of the body but we don't want that to be our head we want the word of God to be our head because Jesus is his word amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us amen she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord what do we have we have the Vindicated truth of the word we don't have man's opinion we don't have a good idea we don't have hashtag trending gospel we have the word of God right not based on culture not based on anything like that it's based our walk is based solely on the word of God Amen she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride will do only his will none can make them do otherwise they have thus said the Lord all they keep still so for example if we've got scripture on it we do it that's why we lay hands on the sick that's why anoint the sick with oil according to the scripture amen everything we do the Bible says everything in word or deed do in the name of Jesus Christ right so everything we do that's a lot of things now I'm not just talking about church now I'm talking about your whole life right can you do it in the name of Jesus Christ things you watch places you go your conversations you know you there's some things that we say to one another we can't really say we can't say it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or about people everything we should say should be we should be able to say this in the name of Jesus Christ help us Lord help us Lord amen they know what uh it has they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word we know it's him right I trust you know that it's he's the Christian in your life not your own ability amen he did not complete all his work while he was in his Earthly Ministry so he now works in and through the bride he never came to New Zealand he never went to South Africa amen he never went to Europe he was never in America he was only there in Palestine but he says as the father has said me so I send to you yeah amen the father sent him went in him right and the same one went in his church and he still does today praise the Lord amen that's why Redemption has always actually been tied into mankind maybe we'll go through that another time but you see he works his ministry he now works in and through his bride now we know that doesn't mean we purchase anyone's salvation he did that on Calvary right but God uses his body to gather his elect to himself remember like Peter was P Peter you know or we'll go to Cornelius Cornelius had a visitation of an angel said you're a devout man Cornelius your arms and prayers are coming before God now the angel didn't say now this is the way of Salvation he said go get Peter and Joppa right and then and then Peter had the vision of the um your unclean animals coming down the sheet three times and those things then Peter went to cornelius's house because Cornelius sent servants to find him and then he preaches the word and cornelius's house the Holy Ghost Falls right the people receive eternal life and he says shall we forbid water as they have received the Holy Ghost like we did and they'll baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but he said the angel could have said here's the Holy Ghost but he said no go get Peter why because God works through his body hallelujah amen amen amen praise the Lord she knows that for us not yet time for him to do certain things he must that he must do now but he will now fulfill through his bride the work which he left for this specific time Hallelujah amen and praise the Lord now I'm just going to kind of close with this now what a confirmation to see a lamb and Dove come together Heaven and Earth United God and man united and one of the sins of the world was kissed away all roughness and all Death and All sorrow and all sickness was kissed away when the lamb and the dove became United together and it'll do the same thing to you when it unites with you when the Dove and lamb comes together their Natures are the same I mean saw the roughness all the fussing and fighting of the world all trying to be better than your friends and trying to be the one who's the big shot you know God will take that all out of you we're really all you'll really worry about it's not what your Social Circle thinks of you it's what the Lord thinks of you that's the thing that will matter Above All Things why because the Dove and the lamb come together your nature becomes a lamb nature or a dove nature amen you see if you just you know firing lots of barbs with your tongue you got to realize Lord that that's not your nature speaking out of me that's my Fallen nature Lord take this out of me help me to brighten my tongue Lord you take over lord Jesus might not feel any order yo you say well I'm tired I just had a bad day don't worry about those things we all have bad days we'll have hard times but that doesn't give us license people say well I'm grumpy they're gonna let grumpy rule you right honestly you know I'm grumpy this is just I just rolled out the wrong side of the bed we have ability by the Holy Ghost see nowadays people say however you feel you just become that way right Feel Like a Woman become a woman feel like a man become a man do this do that you know but no God gives us the ability to buy his holy spirit to take grumpy and say grumpy go away I might feel this way I'm not living this way I might feel grumpy I may have a bee in my Bonnet well I'm just going to open the Bonnet let the bee go away right that's how we should be why because God has given us if we stay surrendered to him we stand harmony with him we can't help maybe feeling grumpy if I have I don't have afternoon sleeps if I do I wake up grumpy I feel like I'm jet lagged and my face is a little mushed and it's not good it's not good for anyone so we don't do that stuff you know but see the thing is you may wake up grumpy don't let grumpy rule you you may be frustrated don't leave frustration rule you you may feel resentment don't let it rule you you don't need to it's not your portion you've got a greater ability Yo God is greater than grumpy God is greater than flusterations fussing with it frustration God's greater if you're frustrated take it to God if you're feeling grumpy take it to God those things really should just harness you and put you into prayer say Lord I'm not meant to feel this way and we shouldn't be governed by feelings anyway you know what are we which is going to finish with us now what do we do then the mind let the mind that was in Christ what is that what the Bible said the mind that was in Christ be with you now this is actually my last slide and and that's for real life what kind of a mind did he have stay with the word that's right stay with the word the father's word and defeated the enemy every time now when the enemy attacks and tries to say you've got to do this and God to do that what are you going to do stay with the word that's right what do you want to do then take the word what is the word the Bible said here we just read it for the spirit and of the word and of God is the word see look here and take the helmet of salvation and and The Sword and the sword of the spirit the sword of the spirit what the spirit that come in through your mind and enters into you and the sword that of that spirit is the word of God what does that Spirit fight with what does the Holy Ghost fight with Sensations feelings the word I'm in heart few Glory what does it fight with feelings word word just stay with it words see word of God is what the spirit fights with and because Jesus showed in the desert that he conquered Satan after 40 years 40 years 40 days amen no food hungry say it because Satan always comes at our weak points he never comes when you're full of Vitality you're having a good day maybe you're a morning person you're feeling really good in the morning the devil don't turn up then maybe you're a night person he doesn't turn up in the night time when you're feeling 100 he comes when you're feeling down you're feeling wore out you've had a hard day hard week hardly you know that's when he comes against you because he knows you're in a weakened State isn't the devil a coward isn't he a cow that guy but he'll come against you when you're in that kind of state but you re but you see Jesus after 40 days in the in the desert he proved it doesn't take his great power to conquer Satan it just takes the word of God will defeat him any place any time anywhere how do you think Jesus felt after a 40-day fast he wasn't running laps he wasn't feeling good he was starving he was hungry he would you know he wasn't feeling the best but he's showing that the word is greater than the feeling you don't have to feel good to be an overcomer it's not feelings that overcome it's the word of God Amen and if you walk in harmony with the word not your opinion but the word of God you're walking in Harmony Just quote the word no matter how you feel you may feel like a total waste of space quote that word you might feel like there's no way that you're going to take a Rapture quote that word don't get caught up in how you feel remember it's not my feelings are you saved it's not by feelings are you healed it's not by feelings you take a Rapture it's not you it's not going to be this euphoric feeling that's going to wash over us and then we're going to take and then we're Rapture Ready no it's when the Holy Ghost comes into you and he lives through you he seals you into the kingdom to the day of your Redemption your Rapture Ready some of us probably be feeling not so good the day of the Rapture these bodies will still be changed some of us will be feeling great these bodies will be changed some of us will be asleep maybe even having a bad night's sleep because it says in the Bible there'll be two work in the field one will be taken when I be left turn the bed one will be taken one of we left the Rapture is a universal Rapture around the world so whenever it starts there'll be people asleep and maybe they've just hurt their back just rolling over in their bed I know it's I'm not trying to sound like a joke but yeah there'll be some people in that condition but they'll be taken away because the Holy Ghost has sealed them into the kingdom and they're ready to go if you're awake or you're asleep you're ready praise God amen so let us be Lambs today let us be doves to say Lord I want to walk with you I want to be in harmony with you Lord I want nothing in my heart that is any ought I don't want any ill feeling I don't want any unforgiveness anything in me that would separate me from you search your Hustler tonight amen let's have the musicians tonight
