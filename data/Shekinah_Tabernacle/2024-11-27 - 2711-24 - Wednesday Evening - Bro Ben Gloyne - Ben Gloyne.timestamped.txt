[28:51] he leadth me beside the Still Waters he
[28:54] restoreth my soul he leadth me in the
[28:56] paths of righteousness for his name's
[28:58] sake y though I walk through the valley
[29:00] of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil

[29:23] gracious father thank you Lord for your
[29:25] word it's alive it's Rich Lord It's you
[29:27] we praise you Lord this night we can
[29:29] gather we can we can uh read your word
[29:31] we can worship we can pray and dear God
[29:33] we just invite you once again to come
[29:35] into our midst Lord may you walk and
[29:37] touch every life and meet every need
[29:39] Lord those who couldn't be here tonight
[29:40] Lord be their portion too father have
[29:42] your way we love you so much father we
[29:44] commit Our Lives we commit the service
[29:46] into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[29:48] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[29:51] friends you can have your seats I just
[29:52] want to speak on just three little words
[29:54] he leadth me what a beautiful statement
[29:58] you know how how David could could could
[30:00] write this and it was more than a uh
[30:03] sure it was an inspiration of the Lord
[30:05] but you know he could say as a testimony
[30:07] he leadth me and uh we know that the
[30:10] scripture says in Romans chapter 8 that
[30:12] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[30:14] God so there's a leadership that we can
[30:17] enjoy and we do enjoy amen I'm looking
[30:19] at people where you could all say he
[30:21] leadth me amen he leadth me present
[30:23] tense he leadth me not just he has and
[30:26] he or he will he leadth me right now
[30:29] amen so you know it's amazing when you
[30:31] think about these just just that
[30:32] statement is a phenomenal statement
[30:34] because everyone will be Leed by
[30:36] something and it's leading you somewhere
[30:38] every every form of leadership and you
[30:40] think about David he was King he wasn't
[30:42] just uh some little guy in Israel you
[30:44] know he was the he was the top dog he
[30:46] was the he was the leader he was he had
[30:48] the final say but yet he said God leadth
[30:51] me amen so uh he he he he wanted uh you
[30:55] know the Lord was his leader now
[30:58] we all have to be led by something we
[31:00] know that's nothing foreign to us but
[31:02] you know we got to think about whoever's
[31:03] leading us will will lead us to a
[31:05] certain place as uh you know the Lord
[31:08] would say in Jeremiah he says for I know
[31:10] the thoughts I think toward you sayith
[31:12] the Lord thoughts of peace and not evil
[31:14] to give you an expected end now this if
[31:17] you think about it his thoughts towards
[31:19] us are before the foundation of the
[31:21] world he saw you rejoicing and shouting
[31:23] in eternity with him you know as he
[31:25] asked job where were you when I laid the
[31:27] foundation ations of the world and the
[31:29] morning stars and the sons of God
[31:30] shouted for Joy you know God was wanting
[31:32] job to say you were there you weren't on
[31:34] the ash sheep in my mind you were there
[31:36] and and you know that's why God sees us
[31:38] as well he sees us rejoicing around the
[31:40] throne so that's his thoughts towards us
[31:41] those are good thoughts he and we know
[31:43] God can't change his thoughts towards
[31:45] his CH he can't change his thoughts at
[31:46] all his mind is made up amen it's a good
[31:51] it's good amen so and and so what does
[31:53] this expected in for us Well to Well
[31:55] what he thought of us we will end up as
[31:57] that thought now expressed so we have a
[31:59] very good exped uh expected end
[32:02] now how do we know he's leading because
[32:05] you think about it because if he's a
[32:06] certain type of leader he's going to C
[32:08] he's going to lead us to certain places
[32:09] right so let's just go off the negative
[32:12] um I mean let's just go to the places
[32:13] he'll never lead us right because if
[32:15] you'll lead us one place he won't lead
[32:17] us to another place and if he doesn't
[32:18] lead us yeah so you know what I mean so
[32:20] he will never lead us to a place
[32:22] contrary to his word which is himself he
[32:24] cannot lead him to a lead us to a place
[32:26] or that is not him right he has to lead
[32:29] us according to his word God does not
[32:32] lead us in a way that frustrates his own
[32:34] purpose he doesn't lead us that way he
[32:37] will never lead you to become a bitter
[32:39] grumpy unthankful person he doesn't lead
[32:41] us that way you see the state that now
[32:43] when I talk about the state I don't talk
[32:45] about the trial or the situation you
[32:47] find yourself in because we got to
[32:49] realize we're Christians everywhere
[32:51] Jesus was Jesus in the synagogue on the
[32:55] sea in the tombs with the you know with
[32:58] Legion he was Jesus in Pilot's judgment
[33:01] Hall he was Jesus on the cross he was
[33:03] Jesus in Hell he was the same guy right
[33:06] he didn't change who he was he was the
[33:07] same kind of person everywhere right and
[33:09] that's what we to be we to be Christians
[33:10] wherever we are we're a Christian right
[33:13] on the job at school at home in church
[33:15] on the street whatever we should be the
[33:18] same person amen right so so so when I'm
[33:22] talking about the state you find
[33:23] yourself in I'm not talking about a
[33:24] trial you may be in I'm talking about
[33:25] the state of your heart right he'll
[33:28] never lead us into a state where we
[33:29] become bitter grumpy or unthankful he
[33:32] doesn't lead us that kind of way right
[33:34] he will never lead us to resent
[33:36] anyone amen he'll never lead us to hate
[33:39] anybody or group or
[33:41] race doesn't matter what color of the
[33:44] rainbow doesn't matter what state
[33:46] they're in he will never lead us to hate
[33:48] that person remember here's the Fountain
[33:50] of God's love here's the love of God
[33:52] expressed so what should the bride of
[33:54] Christ be the love of God expressed
[33:56] right so we should never have a
[33:58] condemnation even a thought of
[33:59] condemnation towards
[34:01] anybody we shouldn't we should love
[34:03] everybody hey if God loved you he can
[34:05] love them that's why I think if God
[34:07] could love me enough to save me he can
[34:08] love them right cuz the same love he
[34:10] poured out on for me he's poured out for
[34:13] them right amen he will never lead us to
[34:16] have a judgmental attitude he never
[34:18] leads us there no he can't that's not
[34:21] him you see he's not he's not uh
[34:23] resentful he's not grumpy he's not
[34:25] bitter he's not unthankful see he will
[34:28] never lead us there cuz that's not him
[34:30] right that's all contrary to his word
[34:32] he'll never lead us to hate
[34:34] anybody amen he does not lead to those
[34:36] places he will never lead us to be a
[34:38] carnal legalistic person that's not him
[34:42] I'm just going through the negative
[34:43] things let's go to we're going to go
[34:44] positive but let's just think about
[34:45] these things because you got to think
[34:46] about what's your current attitude amen
[34:50] right because because in order to be
[34:52] lead by him you've got to be United with
[34:54] him so what his heart is your heart
[34:56] should be now we know we're in this
[34:57] flesh it's not redeemed it's going to be
[34:59] changed all those things but we got to
[35:01] realize if we're walking according to
[35:02] the flesh we should know it right we
[35:04] should we should be well aware I am in
[35:06] the flesh very much right now and and
[35:08] that's not an excuse right but you
[35:10] should realize Lord soften my heart that
[35:12] I'm walking after your spirit right cuz
[35:14] where his spirit is there's tenderness
[35:16] there's love there's a peace there's a
[35:18] thankfulness there's a
[35:20] joy amen where he is right amen so he so
[35:24] he will not lead us to a carnal
[35:26] legalistic uh EXP erience he cannot lead
[35:28] us that way he will lead us to Green
[35:31] Pastures now you think about it you know
[35:33] there's a big difference you know I was
[35:34] born and raised in gbon so they have
[35:36] drought you know they have it gets dry
[35:38] there's always a worry about do we have
[35:40] enough water you know we had uh rain
[35:42] water that's what we lived off we had a
[35:43] b hole in case things get bad but you
[35:45] know in the summer time we'd have real
[35:47] summer up there real summer things would
[35:49] get dry it would be hot it'd be summer
[35:53] you know we thought it was cold when it
[35:54] was like 15° in the winter time man we
[35:56] thought man this is freezing
[35:59] anyway but you see there's a big
[36:02] difference when you're walking on grass
[36:03] that's dry it's baked like the Earth is
[36:06] hard it's rock because there's no
[36:08] there's no moisture there's no you know
[36:11] there's no Spirit flowing there hardness
[36:13] everything's dead and withered up
[36:14] there's no it appears to be no life so
[36:17] there's one thing to walk on that you
[36:18] hear the crunch there's no movement in
[36:19] the leaves there's no you know it's just
[36:21] everyone knows what I'm talking about
[36:22] right everyone knows what I'm talking
[36:23] about you know even the dust blows and
[36:25] all these things but then when you walk
[36:27] on green grass am mean that's well
[36:31] watered the the soil is soft under your
[36:33] feet you know it's just a it's just a
[36:34] nice experience to walk on that kind of
[36:36] a grass it's such a difference between a
[36:38] a withered dry kind of experience to a
[36:40] nice Lush experience am me so he doesn't
[36:44] lead us now I got to maybe I'll just put
[36:46] this here right now he will lead us
[36:49] through Dry times he will lead us
[36:52] through bitter experiences right through
[36:54] them not to them through them right he
[36:57] may he may lead us through hard he will
[36:59] lead us through hard times but he
[37:01] doesn't he doesn't take us to that and
[37:03] that's your end result right he's got
[37:04] thoughts towards us of Peace will come
[37:06] to an expected end what will be made in
[37:08] His image around the throne as he
[37:09] thought of us before the foundation of
[37:11] the world right so he will lead us
[37:13] through Dry places bitter experiences
[37:15] times of hardship through great trials
[37:17] you know as as David would say though I
[37:19] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[37:21] death I will fear no evil now remember
[37:23] if there's a shadow there's a light
[37:24] shining somewhere right that's why like
[37:27] like there's Shadows down in this room
[37:28] because there's a light shining right
[37:30] not just these artificial lights but the
[37:31] sun is going down it casts Shadow upon
[37:33] the Earth so if there's a so if you
[37:35] walking through the valley of the shadow
[37:36] of death there's a light shining
[37:38] somewhere right and that light isn't the
[37:40] devil amen it's the Lord himself giving
[37:43] you enough light you may go through a
[37:44] dark time not sure but you say he leadth
[37:46] me amen he leadth me through those
[37:49] difficult times hallelujah amen so he
[37:51] leads us to to to Green Pastures that
[37:55] gives life there's life in it who's ever
[37:57] you know you just kind of kick over a
[37:59] clot of dirt there's all these
[38:00] earthworms kind of spring out of
[38:01] everywhere who's experienced that kind
[38:03] of thing why there's life in the soil
[38:05] because there's enough moisture there
[38:06] and you take a you take a a Christian
[38:09] that's really been in the spirit of God
[38:11] they're not dry they're not all cracked
[38:13] and hard and you know their hearts are
[38:15] soft and tender and you know you know
[38:17] it's just it's just cuz there's water
[38:18] flowing you know there's there's life
[38:20] it's Lush times you know why cuz the
[38:22] Lord has led us remember we were all
[38:24] dead we're all a Barren Wasteland of a
[38:27] desert
[38:28] but the Lord but then he leadth me am
[38:30] mean because his thought towards me
[38:31] wasn't a Barren dead desert amen it was
[38:33] a lush green Paradise am mean where
[38:35] people could come and sit down and be
[38:37] refreshed and why because remember
[38:39] whatever God gives us we give out
[38:41] remember Abraham received Isaac and he
[38:43] had to offer him back to God Amen so
[38:45] whatever moisture comes in will be given
[38:47] out right amen so now so so we don't you
[38:50] know he doesn't lead us to stay in some
[38:53] hard kind of experience you got to
[38:54] realize now you know if you're in a dry
[38:57] dry place you got to realize you're
[38:59] going through a dry place going through
[39:01] I'm going through a dry season you won't
[39:03] always be in that season don't even say
[39:05] well God's lead me here to stay here no
[39:07] I'm going through I'm going through this
[39:09] time cuz he leadth me right he leadth me
[39:12] beside the Still Waters now those Still
[39:14] Waters are peaceful places of rest amen
[39:17] it's not a place of torment and trouble
[39:19] and anxiety and worry and all those
[39:21] things no it's a place of Peace God
[39:22] wants us to have peace in our minds to
[39:26] to to have a peaceful mind
[39:27] to have a peaceful existence you know
[39:29] not that you know sure the devil will
[39:31] come and try and cause all kind of
[39:32] trouble in our lives but he wants us to
[39:34] be beside Still Waters God does right
[39:37] not beside some empty you know uh you
[39:39] know empty lake or you know Bracken kind
[39:42] of dead stagnant water that's not what
[39:44] it means it means still peaceful amen so
[39:47] there's a there's a place he leads us to
[39:49] now David would say restore unto me the
[39:52] joy of my salvation so David could say
[39:54] he leadth me back to the joy of my
[39:55] salvation and mean because remember he
[39:58] you know his carnal desire led him away
[40:00] from the leading of the great Shepherd
[40:02] but he realized he was far from his
[40:03] Shepherd so he said Lord take me back
[40:05] restore that to me see he never lost it
[40:08] but he lost the joy of his salvation and
[40:10] you see that's what the devil wants us
[40:11] to do is to lose the joy of being a
[40:14] Believer lose the joy of reading the
[40:17] word lose the joy of seeing one another
[40:21] be you become unth thankful become you
[40:22] know that kind of thing no but the Lord
[40:24] leads us to be what thankful full of

[46:33] he leadth us into all things in
[46:37] Christ amen you say
[46:41] well some sometimes well these bodies
[46:44] are so
[46:45] limiting you know if we really had if we
[46:47] could really see the Unseen World in our
[46:50] lives every day we'd just be walking
[46:52] we'd realize we're walking around in a
[46:54] bubble in an atmosphere of of Heaven
[46:57] doesn't matter where you are remember
[46:58] God remember we don't have to we don't
[47:00] have to be still in terms of nothing
[47:03] wrong no trouble and God comes in you in
[47:07] certain
[47:08] circumstances God's with you
[47:10] always God was with Moses at the burning
[47:13] bush God was with Moses in Pharaoh's
[47:16] Court God was with Moses on the Red Sea
[47:19] everyone's troubled and everyone's
[47:20] saying what are you going to do and
[47:21] you've led us out here to die God was in
[47:23] that turmoil and said speak and go
[47:25] forward you see it's just like with
[47:26] David on the back you your you in the
[47:29] back of the farm playing his heart God
[47:31] was there God was with David against
[47:33] Goliath and running from Saul and all
[47:35] the things he went through he leadth me
[47:37] see he had a revelation God you've led
[47:38] me every step of the way and you know it
[47:41] says in the Old Testament I've carried
[47:43] you like a father carries us young he's
[47:46] born us up he's carried us as I said on
[47:49] Sunday we'll come to a point we realize
[47:50] he was there the whole
[47:52] time brother Braham said do you are you
[47:54] conscious of the presence of God is with
[47:56] you everywhere you go we should be
[47:58] conscious of that see he'll never lead
[48:00] us to a place where we think God doesn't
[48:01] exist that's not God's leadership God's
[48:04] leadership is I want to reveal myself I
[48:06] want you to know I'm alive that I'm a
[48:08] God of my word for you not just anyone
[48:11] not just everyone but for you not the
[48:13] not your neighbor next to you to you cuz
[48:15] he
[48:16] leadth
[48:19] amen and so as I was saying these these
[48:22] bodies can be so limiting but I pray we
[48:24] could be more aware God leadth presently
[48:29] every day in our
[48:31] lives amen what are we going to do just
[48:33] stay surrender to him love him be
[48:36] thankful thank you Lord you found me
[48:39] thank you Lord you saved me thank you
[48:40] Lord my expected end is Glory thank you
[48:43] Lord I don't have to go through a Great
[48:44] Tribulation thank you Lord that my sins
[48:46] are all washed away thank you Lord you
[48:48] dealt with the sin question of my life
[48:49] you took care of that for me thank you
[48:51] Lord thank you Lord you've saved me to
[48:54] keep me he leadth me who's ever been in
[48:57] turmoil I'm sure we're can all say yes
[48:59] and I and and you didn't know the way
[49:00] out and somehow the Lord just you maybe
[49:02] you opened his word heard a message some
[49:04] just came into your heart do this do
[49:07] that and you look back and say he leadth
[49:09] me Hallelujah when your flesh wanted to
[49:12] go one way but God wanted you go the
[49:13] other way and you chose to go God's way
[49:15] he leadth me and even though sometimes
[49:17] we may go astray he he goes after you
[49:20] he's like no no no you're going off the
[49:21] path I want to bring you home I want to
[49:22] bring you back I want to lead you in my
[49:24] word come back into my word and walk
[49:26] with me in my word amen but you see how
[49:29] as I said our flesh can be so uh I pray
[49:31] that we would look beyond our five
[49:33] senses and we would realize God is he
[49:35] leadth
[49:36] us amen and and S brother Bram uh in the
[49:40] message Mother's day you should go if
[49:42] you want to read a quick short sharp
[49:43] powerful thing read Mother's Day there's

[50:00] he'll be more of a relative to us than
[50:02] he is now we'll understand him better
[50:04] because we're so far away in the Mortal
[50:06] bodies then we'll have a body like his
[50:08] glorious body we'll know how to worship
[50:10] Him and when we see what the presence of
[50:13] his being has done to us changed us the
[50:16] old back young all the deform strain out
[50:18] oh we'll understand then why has power
[50:21] healed us the question has been in our
[50:24] minds how can he do it how uh what would
