[50:06] that and that that phrase just jumped
[50:07] only God has to write a song and so when
[50:09] I talk about God wanting to write a song
[50:12] I'm not necessarily talking about a
[50:13] songwriter otherwise brother Isaac's
[50:15] just got the Lion's Share and you know
[50:16] but it's more than all you know you know
[50:18] answer your sister Esther or Christine's
[50:20] written some songs and Andy and yes you
[50:22] have it they're good don't look at me
[50:23] like that amen that's funny
[50:26] my life amen but you know God God wants
[50:28] to write a song in our life praise the
[50:30] Lord and so I'm not now saying you're
[50:32] going to write a song with with verses
[50:33] and and bridges and choruses but God
[50:36] wants to use a testimony and he wants it
[50:38] to to to to turn into a worship amen
[50:41] that's what that's the whole point of
[50:42] testimony is it would turn into a
[50:44] worship it wouldn't be a wouldn't be
[50:45] well I did this and this what happened
[50:47] no it's it's a testament what God has
[50:49] done in our lives so God has to write a
[50:51] song so he wants to write a song in your
[50:53] life amen so now we know that God but
[50:56] you know you know in him is the fullness
[50:58] you know he is the fullness of God here
[50:59] by thee all that the word is he is
[51:01] because he is the word right but now the
[51:03] word has to go from just a thought that
[51:05] he thought that it's spoken but it has
[51:07] to become material has to materialize
[51:10] like John would say in John 1 and 1 in
[51:12] the beginning was the word and the Word
[51:14] was with God and the Word was God and
[51:16] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[51:18] us this is verse 14 and we beheld his
[51:20] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[51:22] of the father full of grace and truth so
[51:25] the word as it went from in the
[51:27] beginning God created heavens and the
[51:28] Earth all the way down through the Old
[51:29] Testament there's a condescension of the
[51:31] word till it became flesh in Jesus
[51:33] Christ now when he talks about the word
[51:35] it's not ink on paper he's talking about
[51:37] the being the pillar of fire God himself
[51:39] he would come down and become material
[51:42] he would become flesh now God has songs
[51:45] in him God has testimonies in him God
[51:48] before the foundation of the world knew
[51:50] every testimony you would have and every
[51:52] Victory you would win and how our God
[51:53] would fight your battles and you know
[51:55] every every circumstance of them how
[51:57] close the devil got but when he when he
[51:59] got right in your face like Samson with
[52:01] the lion got right in Samson's face but
[52:03] the anointing Came Upon Samson and he
[52:05] tore her in two you know those kind of
[52:06] testimonies when you feel the breath of
[52:08] the enemy right you but God steps on the
[52:10] scene and intervenes God knew those
[52:12] testimonies he'd give you and he knew
[52:14] exactly what they would consist of and
[52:16] the worship that would come out of them
[52:18] praise the Lord but we do not worship
[52:20] God because we're robots we worship God
[52:22] out of free will we love him because we
[52:24] love him because we've chose to love him
[52:26] because he first loved us now I'm so
[52:28] thankful God gives us testimonies where
[52:30] we don't just talk about what brother
[52:31] Branham did or someone else did but God
[52:34] is alive today and he's the same God
[52:36] back there as the same God today and I'm
[52:38] so thankful that a book of Acts is being
[52:40] written in our midst amen of the acts of
[52:42] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives praise the
[52:45] Lord so I'm so thankful we serve a
[52:46] living God today he's not dead he's not
[52:48] an idea he's not an argument he's not a
[52:50] church building or organization he's a
[52:53] he he's a true and living God the word
[52:55] himself made flesh
[52:57] praise the Lord in US amen so I believe
[53:00] God has to write a song
[53:02] amen he has a burden he wants to write a
[53:04] song now it's incredible when you think
[53:06] about the great journey that songwriters
[53:08] go through when they write amazing songs
[53:09] you know it's not just uh you know sure
[53:12] there's a lot of people they're very
[53:13] gifted they'll sit in a room and they'll
[53:14] just because of commercial ways they
[53:16] know how to write songs and know how to
[53:18] make money out of different lyrics and
[53:19] things but those songs are all very good
[53:21] but but a real song comes from a
[53:23] testimony normally it's me times of
[53:26] great hardship and trial and and and and
[53:28] distress and worry that's when God wants
[53:31] to express himself as I said a few
[53:32] Sundays ago about David you know the
[53:34] reason we got the book of Psalms is
[53:36] because of the anguish and hardship and
[53:38] and trouble David went through that
[53:40] Christ will be expressed out of his life
[53:42] and it's the same thing with you and I
[53:44] you know you know this is a ragged walk
[53:46] this is not a Sunday school picnic kind
[53:49] of walk this is a battlefield I mean
[53:50] we've got trenches we've got armor we've
[53:52] got weapons but there's an enemy we're
[53:54] going to take his land we're going to
[53:55] drive him off our land hey man we're
[53:57] gonna We're not gonna take any prisoners
[53:59] we're going to show No Quarter we're
[54:01] going to destroy every devil I mean that
[54:03] comes against us by our God right but
[54:04] but we're in a battle
[54:06] praise the Lord but God wants to have
[54:07] testimonies through that battle I trust
[54:09] you're all with me today I'm you know
[54:10] I'm going somewhere with this because
[54:12] you know because because worship isn't
[54:14] just pointing back to it's it's it's
[54:15] it's it's prophesying
[54:18] I'll show you this here so now so so it
[54:20] has to you know great great songs come
[54:23] through great anguish
[54:25] you know there was you know we all know
[54:27] the song of uh uh Amazing Grace how
[54:29] sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like
[54:31] Me that was written by a man named John
[54:33] Newton John Newton was involved in the
[54:36] slave trade and even though he said he
[54:38] became somewhat of a Christian during a
[54:40] storm when he was a captain on a slave
[54:42] ship he says he did not really become a
[54:45] full believer until many years after he
[54:47] left the slave train now no doubt no
[54:50] doubt the memories of what he did to
[54:52] those poor people there selling them as
[54:54] slaves taking them across the sea would
[54:56] have haunted him every every minute of
[54:58] the rest of his life of what he did to
[55:00] human life there and the great trouble
[55:02] that you know you you know a great you
[55:04] know evil that he did but you know he
[55:07] knew what it was like to sing Amazing
[55:09] Grace because he knew what it was like
[55:10] to be on a slave ship himself it wasn't
[55:13] a physical slavery he was in but he was
[55:15] a he was under he was in a slavery you
[55:17] know ship of sin and and he was bound
[55:20] for Destruction he knew it was only
[55:21] chained in darkness where there's no
[55:23] hope nothing at all you know trying to
[55:25] just drink his life away and just trying
[55:27] to live life whatever more but he knew
[55:29] what it's like to be on a slave ship but
[55:30] he knew what it was like for the for the
[55:32] government to give a decree from heaven
[55:34] there's come a time where slavery has
[55:36] come to an end I'm talking about I'm not
[55:38] just talking about natural slavery I'm
[55:39] talking about spiritual slavery so he
[55:41] knew what it was like for his slave
[55:43] change to be broken by the blood of
[55:44] Jesus Christ and he was like to go free
[55:47] Hallelujah and and to me that's why he
[55:49] could pen such a such a such a song that
[55:52] we still sing today amen because it came
[55:55] through testimony it came through great
[55:56] trials and hardship and but mainly it
[55:59] came through the saving grace of God
[56:00] Amen that he could truly sing Amazing
[56:03] Grace how sweet the sound that saved a
[56:05] Wretch like Me I once was lost but now
[56:07] I'm found I was blind but now I sing and
[56:09] I believe every True Believer could not
[56:11] sing that song and not be affected by
[56:12] its words it's still as powerful as that
[56:14] was first pinned down because God has to
[56:16] write a song Amen and he wanted that
[56:18] song written for That season but not
[56:20] just for that season but for this season
[56:22] I remember that we could stand under the
[56:24] open Word and see the full extent of our
[56:26] Redemption amen a wicked sing that song
[56:29] Hallelujah with great joy in
[56:30] Thanksgiving
[56:32] Hallelujah amen now now Moses you think
[56:36] about the journey that Moses and the
[56:37] children of Israel had to go through for
[56:39] the song of Moses to Be Sung it wasn't
[56:42] just a moment of hardship or even a
[56:43] lifetime it was generations of slavery
[56:45] they had just walked out of they had
[56:48] been in Egypt for 400 years and that
[56:50] moment right there marked that end of
[56:52] when they were in Egypt do you think
[56:54] about this 400 years living under a
[56:56] promise that they were going to be
[56:57] delivered and they were going to go back
[56:59] to the promised land they were going to
[57:00] dwell in that land they were living with
[57:02] that testimony that prophecy they were
[57:04] living under that prophecy and not only
[57:06] that they had the bones of Joseph that
[57:08] no doubt they could have a terrible day
[57:09] being whipped and beaten but I remember
[57:11] Joseph God God used Joseph and we came
[57:15] down here because God used them to to
[57:16] save our forebears but Joseph made his
[57:19] descendants promise don't bury me here
[57:21] he could have had one of the greatest
[57:22] tombs in Egypt he could have had the
[57:25] greatest one because he saved the whole
[57:26] nation not the whole nation but the
[57:27] whole world at that time amen but he
[57:30] said no don't bury me down here bury me
[57:32] up in the promised land and because
[57:34] because Joseph being a prophet just like
[57:37] his his father before him he was
[57:39] spiritually knew that they promised land
[57:40] was Northern land of flowing with milk
[57:42] and honey it was more than just a good
[57:44] land and we don't have slaves and oh or
[57:47] rather be slaves no more it was more
[57:49] than that it was more than just a place
[57:51] we can raise our families and have our
[57:53] inheritance but in that land was the
[57:54] resurrection it's the same thing with
[57:56] the word of God you know sure it makes
[57:58] good families it makes good churches
[58:00] makes great singers makes good preachers
[58:02] musicians whatever well makes great
[58:04] young people different things but it's
[58:05] more than that right it's a place of
[58:07] Resurrection bury me in Christ amen no
[58:10] matter what right so Joseph being
[58:12] spiritual says don't leave my bones here
[58:14] because sure Egypt was fine the tombs
[58:16] were good all those things but the
[58:18] resurrection was going to come forth out
[58:19] of the promised land amen so he said
[58:21] bury me so bury me up there so he had
[58:24] this so he gave them their commission
[58:25] when you leave because you will take my
[58:27] bones with you
[58:30] so the journey that they would they
[58:32] would they would go through for Moses to
[58:34] write this song was an incredible
[58:35] journey they would have the anguish of
[58:37] their of their boy babies being fed to
[58:39] the crocodiles they would have the
[58:41] anguish of being beaten and and killed
[58:43] and you know back-breaking toil and
[58:45] strife and hunger and murder and
[58:47] distress and you know their lives in
[58:49] Jeopardy every day because they were
[58:50] even less and Pharaoh's eyes in his
[58:52] horses or as men
[58:54] but there came a moment where this came
[58:56] to an end and and and here was the end
[58:59] of this because you think about it this
[59:01] wasn't just a them physically leaving
[59:03] Egypt that made them to Rejoice but now
[59:06] you think about it the greatest army
[59:08] that was ever in existence at that time
[59:10] had come to get them
[59:11] but but and that Army tried to follow
[59:14] them through the Red Sea but that Army
[59:15] drowned God killed that Army I mean
[59:18] because they needed to know that there
[59:20] was nothing upon the earth that could
[59:21] take them back into slavery I mean they
[59:24] needed to be very aware see it was one
[59:25] thing for them to leave Egypt then they
[59:27] could have been haunted by the thought
[59:29] Egypt could come get us
[59:31] they're the superpower of the world they
[59:33] could send their armies they could bring
[59:34] every every Soldier and they could take
[59:36] the promised land they could take us
[59:37] back so God wanted them to realize that
[59:40] they would not have to live under that
[59:41] fear anymore there was no worry God had
[59:44] to take out of their mind of them ever
[59:45] going back there amen and it's the same
[59:48] thing with you and I God destroys our
[59:50] enemies in the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:52] amen that we yo he takes away all fear
[59:55] and worry that we'd ever go back to the
[59:57] world being slaves Hallelujah there was
[1:00:00] nothing could make them return back into
[1:00:02] Egypt and the same thing with you and I
[1:00:04] you think about it you know generations
[1:00:06] of pain
[1:00:08] was was destroyed that day amen those
[1:00:11] spirits that yeah because you think
[1:00:12] about those slave masters no doubt the
[1:00:15] great Granddad was a slave master
[1:00:16] because normally the son learns the
[1:00:18] trade of the father right so you know so
[1:00:20] it's generations of slave masters going
[1:00:22] down you know if it was if the Egyptians
[1:00:24] had our English kind of style of last
[1:00:26] names that'd be called slave master
[1:00:28] their last name you like Bakers uh
[1:00:30] you're a Baker's Baker because someone
[1:00:31] was a baker or a Smith or you know
[1:00:33] whatever more so it would have been
[1:00:34] slave master Egyptian right so that
[1:00:36] would have been passed down that
[1:00:37] anointing would have been passed down
[1:00:39] but it came to an end where that
[1:00:40] anointing was eradicated
[1:00:43] Hallelujah says the same thing so
[1:00:45] nothing on the earth could make them
[1:00:46] return and it's the same thing when we
[1:00:48] walk through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:49] amen the same spirits that maybe have
[1:00:52] beaten down generations of our forebears
[1:00:54] of lust or lying or stealing or murder
[1:00:57] or hatred or anger or Temple whatever it
[1:00:59] is that thing gets eradicated in the
[1:01:01] blood of Jesus Christ when you walk
[1:01:03] through amen when you accept Jesus
[1:01:05] Christ really as your savior and you
[1:01:07] believe what he did for you that down
[1:01:08] Calvary repented and baptized in the
[1:01:10] name of Jesus Christ that's like a
[1:01:12] person crossing the Red Sea and the
[1:01:14] devil can't follow you through then just
[1:01:16] like the Egyptian armies could not
[1:01:18] follow amen could not follow the
[1:01:20] Egyptians there they got drowned so
[1:01:22] every enemy amen is destroyed in the
[1:01:24] blood of Jesus Christ and the only thing
[1:01:26] that we can be tormented by is a memory
[1:01:28] right but the thing is the memory only
[1:01:30] goes so far when the devil gives it to
[1:01:32] you because he'll never remind you of
[1:01:33] the day where he was destroyed where he
[1:01:35] was cast out of your life where Faith
[1:01:37] Rose in your heart and he's now under
[1:01:38] your feet amen he never remind you that
[1:01:41] far he'll only remind you of what he did
[1:01:43] did
[1:01:44] until he gets cast out that's why you've
[1:01:46] always got to update him hold on that's

[1:02:39] made and whipped them and beat their
[1:02:41] backs into stripes and pulled them over

[1:03:12] years old right so she wasn't a young
[1:03:14] person getting enthused with a
[1:03:15] tambourine she was one of the old
[1:03:17] sisters in the church and she picked up

[1:03:21] she realized her taskmasters were dead
[1:03:23] amen she she got enough joy in her I I

[1:03:47] beating this tambourine and the
[1:03:49] daughters of Israel followed her dancing
[1:03:51] singing and beating the tambourine Moses
[1:03:53] raised up his hands and got so caught
[1:03:55] away in the Holy Ghost till he sung in
[1:03:56] the spirit Hallelujah that's right

[1:04:17] don't you get happy when you think Jesus
[1:04:19] died on Calvary for you when it becomes
[1:04:21] more than a story and a reality when he

[1:04:25] up calvary's mountain and you bear them

[1:05:19] know no this is eternal I mean we're
[1:05:22] gonna be dancing on the streets of gold
[1:05:23] we're gonna see him as he is we're gonna
[1:05:26] Embrace him we're gonna we're gonna see
[1:05:28] our Lord hallelujah that makes me happy
[1:05:31] and it's not some pipe dream pie in the
[1:05:33] sky it's a reality I mean that and and
[1:05:36] and the evidence of it the Holy Ghost
[1:05:37] sweeps through the building
[1:05:38] amen touches you may be reading
[1:05:40] listening to a message praying you come
[1:05:42] and come to church and God sweep after
[1:05:44] sweep of the Holy Ghost God's telling
[1:05:45] you there's a land beyond the river amen
[1:05:47] and you've got a reservation in that
[1:05:49] land amen and soon as very soon we're
[1:05:52] going to see him we're going to be like
[1:05:53] him we're going to see him as he is and
[1:05:55] be changed Hallelujah
[1:05:57] amen so Moses no wonder he got you know
[1:06:01] he got in the spirit began to sing
[1:06:03] because you think about it he saw
[1:06:06] fulfilled prophecy
[1:06:07] he was looking at prophecy being
[1:06:09] fulfilled it was no longer a promise of
[1:06:12] the future of when when when God would
[1:06:14] speak to Abraham so Abraham your seeds
[1:06:16] going to serve you in a Strange Land 400
[1:06:18] years but I'm going to bring them out
[1:06:19] with a mighty hand that was prophecy
[1:06:21] but when prophecy is fulfilled it
[1:06:24] creates a song and God has to write a
[1:06:26] song right so he wants to write a song
[1:06:28] through those when they see prophecy
[1:06:30] being fulfilled so you think it's always
[1:06:32] more than just the their Enemy being
[1:06:34] drowned Moses got in the spirit because
[1:06:36] he realized now what was prophecy was
[1:06:39] now happening and it was now going to be
[1:06:41] future so he was living in the
[1:06:44] Fulfillment of the scripture he was
[1:06:45] living in Bible days he wasn't standing
[1:06:48] there saying well one day it'll happen
[1:06:49] and yes well thousands of years ago this
[1:06:51] had no yeah we know about him and
[1:06:52] Abraham yeah but what about today he was
[1:06:54] living in the pages of the Bible and he
[1:06:56] knew what side he was on hallelujah amen
[1:07:00] he was he was the part of the word
[1:07:01] because you think about it see the word
[1:07:03] became flesh and dwelt Among Us right
[1:07:05] now we always say well that's the Lord
[1:07:06] Jesus and absolutely it is but you know
[1:07:09] the word didn't just put on flesh and
[1:07:10] him it put on flesh in the Believers
[1:07:12] rights are in the upper room the word
[1:07:14] put on flesh in the 120 and as the Holy
[1:07:17] Ghost spread through the ages so the
[1:07:19] word put on flesh and then so now we
[1:07:21] come back into to this last day where
[1:07:22] God said I will restore and what is that
[1:07:25] full restoration when the word puts on
[1:07:26] flesh again in you and I Hallelujah so
[1:07:30] now it's no longer prophecy it's
[1:07:31] happening
[1:07:32] amen we're living in the season of
[1:07:35] fulfilled prophecy
[1:07:37] praise the Lord
[1:07:38] Hallelujah and to me that's very
[1:07:40] exciting because we're not wandering
[1:07:42] around in the darkness just all
[1:07:43] panicking about Russia and whatever no
[1:07:46] that's just a backdrop God's focus is on
[1:07:49] you God hasn't forgotten none none of
[1:07:51] his children we may feel forgotten but
[1:07:53] God hasn't forgotten about you and I he
[1:07:55] doesn't have the idea about them no he's
[1:07:59] he's mindful of his children every
[1:08:01] moment of every day when you're sleeping
[1:08:03] is mindful of you when you're awake he's
[1:08:04] mindful whatever you're going through he
[1:08:06] is mindful of you and he has not
[1:08:07] forgotten one
[1:08:09] amen see even you know yo you think
[1:08:12] about you know God even says in the Old
[1:08:13] Testament he says can a can a can a
[1:08:15] mother forget her suckling child
[1:08:18] and he actually says yes they can now to
[1:08:20] me I don't know how that is possible
[1:08:22] because a birth is a birth you know you
[1:08:24] don't just fall asleep and wake up and
[1:08:25] there's a baby even a Caesarean is is a
[1:08:27] big ordeal what six weeks of recovery
[1:08:30] and now you've got a baby your whole
[1:08:31] life has changed you know you can't live
[1:08:33] to yourself you can look after this baby
[1:08:35] but you know God even says a mother can
[1:08:37] forget her suckling child they says but
[1:08:39] I will not forget I cannot forget my
[1:08:42] children
[1:08:42] I mean it's a powerful thing when you
[1:08:44] think about how God cannot forget us now
[1:08:46] they were they were panicking coming up
[1:08:48] to the Red Sea because they thought they
[1:08:50] had been led to a death trap but
[1:08:51] actually no God had to write a song and
[1:08:53] he wanted to write a song of Deliverance
[1:08:55] so so he made them walk a certain way
[1:08:57] come to a certain Beach come to a
[1:08:58] certain place where there's nowhere else
[1:08:59] to go but across the sea amen for for
[1:09:02] this testimony to come forth now Moses
[1:09:04] got in the spirit as I said because he
[1:09:06] saw the Fulfillment of Prophecy in his
[1:09:08] day
[1:09:10] Hallelujah now it's such a vital key we
[1:09:12] get in the spirit of the Lord the Holy
[1:09:14] Ghost before we do anything
[1:09:16] before you go through any religious act
[1:09:18] you've got to get in the spirit it's so
[1:09:21] important that we get in the spirit
[1:09:22] before we do anything as John John said
[1:09:25] in Revelations I was on the spirit in
[1:09:26] the Lord's day so he is in the spirit he
[1:09:29] has transported forward in time on the
[1:09:30] Lord's Day right but he got in the
[1:09:32] spirit before he saw anything and it's
[1:09:34] the same thing with you and I we've got
[1:09:36] to get in the spirit now
[1:09:39] how did Moses get in the spirit
[1:09:42] Moses did so so see we do like Moses did
[1:09:46] we look and believe what the Lord has
[1:09:48] already done that's how you get in the
[1:09:50] spirit he saw his enemy did
[1:09:52] he saw the soldiers that no doubt would
[1:09:54] have given evil looks or whatever when
[1:09:56] he walked into Pharaoh's Palace and walk
[1:09:58] out he saw them face down dead in the
[1:10:00] you know in the Red Sea he saw the ones
[1:10:02] were beating on his family beating on
[1:10:03] his loved ones beating on his people
[1:10:05] they were all dead amen and it made him
[1:10:08] get in the spirit Hallelujah and then so
[1:10:10] so that's how you get in the spirit of
[1:10:12] God remember what God has done for you
[1:10:13] already amen If he if he saved your soul
[1:10:16] that's an eternity of Praise right there
[1:10:18] amen if he's redeemed you by his blood
[1:10:21] that's an eternity of Praise Hallelujah
[1:10:23] and when you begin to get in the spirit
[1:10:25] amen remember faith is not a Feeling
[1:10:27] the love of God is even not a feeling
[1:10:29] it's far above human love see man Jesus
[1:10:32] when Jesus asked people if they were
[1:10:34] sick and they came to him and needs he
[1:10:36] says do you believe he did not say do
[1:10:38] you feel anything
[1:10:39] he asked do you believe see even without
[1:10:41] feeling see faith is not a Feeling
[1:10:44] faith is a I believe it it's a
[1:10:46] revelation in the heart see even if we
[1:10:48] don't feel anything you don't go by
[1:10:49] feelings if I went by feelings I
[1:10:51] wouldn't be standing here right now
[1:10:53] I wouldn't be here a lot of church
[1:10:55] services I wouldn't be here I'll be
[1:10:57] honest because I don't feel like it but
[1:10:59] here I am because faith is not a Feeling
[1:11:01] see the devil wants to drive you by your
[1:11:03] five senses or even the inward senses of
[1:11:05] your spirit but God wants to drive you
[1:11:07] by Faith by Revelation and the Soul amen
[1:11:09] and that's what the enemy he wants to
[1:11:11] make you feel a certain way to do a
[1:11:13] certain thing but God wants to reveal
[1:11:15] himself to you a certain way that you'll
[1:11:16] have victory
[1:11:18] amen amen Hallelujah see it's what we
[1:11:21] believe so I believe amen he's done
[1:11:23] incredible things for me
[1:11:27] amen well I need proof well we could
[1:11:29] have testimony sir for sure but he's
[1:11:31] done incredible things for me before I
[1:11:32] even touch my life I believe he died on
[1:11:34] Calvary for me
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:37] Psalms 40 and 1 to the chief musician
[1:11:40] Assam of David I waited patiently for
[1:11:42] the Lord and he and he inclined unto me
[1:11:44] and heard My Cry you think about the you
[1:11:47] know we just read that and think yep and
[1:11:49] he heard My Cry David was in great
[1:11:50] distress but God had to write a song
[1:11:53] amen and and he allowed him to go
[1:11:55] through a lot of things that we would
[1:11:56] get the book of Psalms he brought me up
[1:11:58] also out of a horrible pit out of the
[1:11:59] Maori clay he set my feet upon the rock
[1:12:02] and established my Goings praise Lord he
[1:12:04] had put a new song in my mouth even
[1:12:06] praising to our god many shall see it in
[1:12:09] fear and shall trust in the Lord blessed
[1:12:11] is that man that maketh the Lord his
[1:12:13] trust and respecteth not the proud nor
[1:12:16] such as turn aside to lies many O Lord
[1:12:19] my God are thy wonderful Works which
[1:12:21] thou has done and thy thoughts which are
[1:12:23] to us Lord they cannot be reckoned
[1:12:26] record up in order unto thee if I would
[1:12:28] declare and speak of them they are more
[1:12:31] than can be numbered amens you just
[1:12:34] think about the wonderful Works which he
[1:12:35] has done and his thoughts to you
[1:12:37] amen basically saying there's just too
[1:12:39] many I would just run out of fingers and
[1:12:41] toes and everyone else's fingers are
[1:12:43] toes I'd run out of counting ability
[1:12:44] Hallelujah why because they're just so
[1:12:46] many of them and you begin to think
[1:12:48] about the Lord you say this is very
[1:12:50] Elementary now this is very powerful
[1:12:52] because if you really think about God
[1:12:53] has done God wants us to be happy he
[1:12:56] wants us to be rejoicing he wants to be
[1:12:57] at rest have us at peace he doesn't want
[1:12:59] us troubled and stressed and be full of
[1:13:02] anxiety anxieties of devil anxieties of
[1:13:05] the devil we don't have to put up with
[1:13:06] anxiety it's not our portion peace is
[1:13:08] our portion love is our portion Joys our
[1:13:11] portion rest in the Holy Ghost is our
[1:13:13] portion amen so we're gonna just take
[1:13:15] the word of God and say no devil anxiety
[1:13:18] is not mine depression is not mine
[1:13:21] that's your lot you go enjoy it
[1:13:22] somewhere else far away and don't tell
[1:13:24] me how it goes you just go over there
[1:13:26] get out of here amen so now Moses you
[1:13:29] talk about a Pentecostal meeting you
[1:13:30] know a Pentecostal meeting is nothing
[1:13:31] new
[1:13:33] amen we just read about the first one
[1:13:35] really uh you know upon the Earth that
[1:13:37] was thousands of years ago they got in
[1:13:39] the spirit begin to Rejoice because of
[1:13:40] Revelation because of what the enemy had
[1:13:43] been drowned and they were rejoicing and
[1:13:45] then even job was asked by God where
[1:13:47] were you when this morning star shouted
[1:13:49] for joy Hallelujah that's before there
[1:13:51] was anything in God's mind he saw job
[1:13:53] rejoicing and shouting and I think God's
[1:13:55] going to remind us where were you before
[1:13:58] there was an Adam moon or star or
[1:13:59] anything where were you with me and my
[1:14:01] thinking but now he's got to write a
[1:14:03] song so he's got to make someone
[1:14:04] material to write that song through so
[1:14:07] he thought of you he spoke because a
[1:14:09] word as a thought expressed so he
[1:14:11] thought of you and then he spoke you
[1:14:12] expressed you upon the Earth that
[1:14:14] because he wants to write a song
[1:14:15] Hallelujah
[1:14:17] I was judged today well we're all
[1:14:19] songwriters that's what I got done God
[1:14:21] wants to write a song through your life
[1:14:23] he wants to use every moment moment of
[1:14:25] your life for his glory Hallelujah hey
[1:14:29] the devil's got nothing on us the
[1:14:30] devil's got nothing on us he has no
[1:14:32] Victory he's got no claim he's got
[1:14:34] nothing you got to remember that
[1:14:36] Hallelujah see when you get in the
[1:14:38] spirit you begin to see things that's
[1:14:40] why it's so important to get in the
[1:14:42] spirit amen see Moses when he got in the
[1:14:46] spirit he began to see things see his
[1:14:48] song Turn from a rejoicing Praise of a
[1:14:51] testimony to a prophecy now let's go I
[1:14:54] said to keep uh Exodus 15 I believe yeah
[1:14:57] here we are let's just re you know I've
[1:14:59] either had to find a place to start and
[1:15:01] stop and I'm not just reading this to
[1:15:02] Phil time but you know this is awesome
[1:15:05] so you know I find hard Exodus 15 and 2
[1:15:09] because we read um uh verse 1 8 yet when
[1:15:12] we open now so two the Lord is my
[1:15:14] strength in the song man this is the
[1:15:15] song of Moses the Lord is my strength
[1:15:18] and my song and he has become my
[1:15:20] salvation he is my God and I'll prepare
[1:15:22] him and habitation my father's God I
[1:15:25] will exalt him the Lord is a man of war
[1:15:27] the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots
[1:15:30] and his hosts have they cast into the
[1:15:31] sea has chosen captains also a drowned
[1:15:33] in the Red Sea The Depths have covered
[1:15:36] them they sank into the bottom as a
[1:15:37] stone thy right hand O Lord has become
[1:15:40] glorious in power thy right hand O Lord
[1:15:42] hath dashed in pieces the enemy and in
[1:15:45] the greatness of thine Excellency thou
[1:15:47] has overthrown them that rose up against
[1:15:48] thee thou sendeth forth thy wrath which
[1:15:51] consume them as stubble
[1:15:53] and with the blast of our nostrils the
[1:15:55] waters were gathered together the flood
[1:15:57] stood upright as in Heap and the depths
[1:15:59] were congealed in the heart of the sea
[1:16:01] the enemy said I'll pursue I'll overtake
[1:16:03] I'll divide the spoil my lust shall be
[1:16:05] satisfied upon them I'll draw my sword
[1:16:07] my hand shall destroy them this is the
[1:16:09] devil's
[1:16:10] this is what he says he's going to do
[1:16:12] about you
[1:16:14] thou didst bloweth thy womb the sea
[1:16:16] covered them they sankers LED in the
[1:16:17] mighty Waters who was like under the O
[1:16:19] Lord among the gods who was like the
[1:16:21] Glorious and Holiness fearful and
[1:16:23] Praises doing wonders thou stretch forth
[1:16:26] thy right hand the the Earth swallowed
[1:16:28] them thou and thy mercy has led the
[1:16:30] people which thou has redeemed thou has
[1:16:32] guided them in thy strength unto thy
[1:16:34] holy habitation now we just keep going
[1:16:36] here verse 14. now see now notice how it
[1:16:39] switches now into prophecy the people
[1:16:42] shall hear him be afraid sorrow shall
[1:16:44] take hold of the inhabitants of
[1:16:46] palestinia then the Dukes of Edom shall
[1:16:48] be amazed in the Mighty Men of Moab
[1:16:50] trembling shall take hold upon them all
[1:16:52] the inhabitants of Canaan shall Melt
[1:16:54] Away fear and dread shall fall upon them
[1:16:57] by the greatness of thine arm they shall
[1:16:59] be as still as a stone till thy people
[1:17:01] pass over O Lord till the people pass
[1:17:04] over which thou has purchased so he's
[1:17:06] not just rejoicing about what's happened
[1:17:08] he's in the spirits who begins to see
[1:17:10] what's going to happen in the future
[1:17:11] that's why it's so important to get into
[1:17:13] the spirit you can see what God's about
[1:17:15] to do next amen where it doesn't give
[1:17:17] you a trim that gives you an expectation
[1:17:20] it gives you rejoice it gives you a you
[1:17:23] know a real peace amen a real excitement
[1:17:25] amen so so he's saying that the people's
[1:17:27] hearts are gonna melt and this is
[1:17:29] exactly what what rahab's testimony was
[1:17:32] when she hid the two spies in Jericho it
[1:17:35] should say and and Joshua two and nine
[1:17:38] you should say and and she said unto the
[1:17:41] men I know that the Lord has given you
[1:17:42] the land and that your Terror has fallen
[1:17:44] upon us and all the inhabitants of the
[1:17:46] earth faint because of you
[1:17:48] so so what Moses prophesied she was now
[1:17:52] living in
[1:17:53] hallelujah amen I was going to keep
[1:17:55] reading this for we have heard how the
[1:17:56] Lord dried up the Waters of the Red Sea
[1:17:58] for you when you came out of Egypt so
[1:18:00] what the people shall hear and be afraid
[1:18:03] amen and what ye did unto the two kings
[1:18:06] the amorites that were on the other side
[1:18:07] of Jordan seahon and OG whom ye utterly
[1:18:10] destroyed and as soon as we we had heard
[1:18:13] these things our hearts did melt neither
[1:18:14] did there remain any more courage in any
[1:18:16] man because of you for the Lord your God
[1:18:19] he is God in heaven above and Earth
[1:18:21] beneath now notice that phrase uses
[1:18:24] twice is because of you well isn't it
[1:18:27] because of God well God was among them I
[1:18:30] remember as they were walking man
[1:18:31] because footsteps of possession so they
[1:18:33] were lame and claim on the promised land
[1:18:34] and everywhere they went the enemy the
[1:18:37] the fear of God fell upon them so they
[1:18:39] were terrified because of them
[1:18:41] Hallelujah now you think about it you
[1:18:43] roll out of bed in the morning
[1:18:44] you get all the stuff out of your eyes
[1:18:48] click your back
[1:18:49] think oh boy yo you pull a hamstring
[1:18:51] just getting out of bed yeah you think
[1:18:53] man how am I ever going to survive this
[1:18:55] day in an unseen realm there's a panic
[1:18:58] button goes off in hell
[1:19:00] I think how and and they begin to think
[1:19:02] how are we going to get through this day
[1:19:03] they're awake they're awake you know why
[1:19:07] because the courage of the devil is gone
[1:19:09] he's nothing but a bluff he has no more
[1:19:12] courage he his Hearts have melted why
[1:19:14] because of you because you are the
[1:19:16] Lord's redeemed ones and if he puts a
[1:19:19] hand against you he's got Jesus Christ
[1:19:20] on his hands amens I wouldn't you know
[1:19:23] if I was the devil I wouldn't touch any
[1:19:25] of God's children I would put no trouble
[1:19:26] upon them I put no but he just he's a
[1:19:29] creature of Heaven he can't help himself
[1:19:30] but also God allows it because God has
[1:19:33] to write a song
[1:19:34] Hallelujah and so he allows the devil to
[1:19:36] come against you because God has to
[1:19:38] write a song hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:19:41] why because he wants worship
[1:19:43] amen
[1:19:45] Hallelujah so so their hearts melted
[1:19:48] because of them
[1:19:50] amen now
[1:19:52] they would they would speak Moses would
[1:19:55] speak of well if I can just find this
[1:19:57] last here
[1:20:01] he would speak of the you know how the
[1:20:03] people had been purchased or redeemed
[1:20:06] which thou my Mercy has led the people
[1:20:09] which thou Hast redeemed thou has got
[1:20:11] them in thy strength unto thy holy
[1:20:12] habitation now if we jump forward I'm
[1:20:15] just going to jump forward way ahead
[1:20:17] it's you know it's very interesting when
[1:20:18] you when you search in the Bible you
[1:20:20] know the phrase new song or a new song
[1:20:23] it's in the Psalms it's here and it's
[1:20:26] here and um yeah it's in the Old
[1:20:28] Testament but but it's only twice in the
[1:20:30] Book of Revelation and to me this is uh
[1:20:32] quite astounding because you know a new
[1:20:35] song
[1:20:36] as a as a time when a new song is sung
[1:20:40] when God does something
[1:20:42] now this word new and you know we're
[1:20:44] going to come to Revelations 5 if we
[1:20:46] have I think we have time here because I
[1:20:48] want to go two ways but we'll just go
[1:20:49] one way maybe
[1:20:51] maybe let's just jump quickly first one
[1:20:53] way you know
[1:20:56] there is songwriters okay we'll come
[1:20:58] there I'll just touch this very quickly
[1:21:02] great songs are written in times of
[1:21:04] great hardship
[1:21:05] now as I said about John Newton
[1:21:08] different ones you know but it's amazing
[1:21:10] how the devil can put us in very hard
[1:21:13] situations but if God wants to write a
[1:21:15] song nothing can stop him writing that
[1:21:17] song now the Apostle Paul was an
[1:21:19] incredible man I was actually thanking
[1:21:21] God for him his life today as I was
[1:21:23] driving saying amen this man's
[1:21:26] incredible
[1:21:27] he did not sit in an ivory Tower when he
[1:21:30] wrote most of the New Testament he would
[1:21:33] write 52 of the New Testament I just
[1:21:35] Googled how much he wrote that's how
[1:21:36] much he wrote 14 books of the 27 books
[1:21:38] of the New Testament most of his
[1:21:40] writings were done in prison
[1:21:42] remember nothing can stop the music if
[1:21:44] God wants to write a song we're going to
[1:21:46] realize nothing can hinder if God wants
[1:21:48] to write a testimony in your life amen
[1:21:51] don't it don't let anything of the enemy
[1:21:53] or your external and you know I mean
[1:21:56] internal external hinder that
[1:21:58] Harry would be in prison he'd be
[1:22:01] Shipwrecked he'd be beaten he'd be
[1:22:03] stoned a few times he went through great
[1:22:05] trouble he had to run for his life more
[1:22:07] than once
[1:22:08] and he would he would write some of his
[1:22:10] greatest Epistles and it wasn't him
[1:22:12] writing it was God through him so he'd
[1:22:14] he'd received such powerful Revelation
[1:22:16] in the hardest of circumstances
[1:22:20] he would rock Colossians filamon
[1:22:22] Ephesians Philippians and second Timothy
[1:22:24] in prison in his play and he probably
[1:22:25] written other ones now when he wrote
[1:22:27] these things he was under house arrest
[1:22:29] by the Roman government
[1:22:31] and when he was under this house arrest
[1:22:32] he was chained to a soldier all day
[1:22:35] every day
[1:22:36] so here he was here he was a a a pagan
[1:22:40] unbelieving Soldier has chained to him
[1:22:43] and and maybe the devil thought this is
[1:22:46] going to stop him getting any kind of
[1:22:47] Revelation I'm going to stop his
[1:22:48] apostleship he ain't going to spread the
[1:22:50] gospel no more I've got him and that's
[1:22:52] how the devil tries to do you and I gets
[1:22:54] an ailment in our body we get trouble in
[1:22:56] our mind trouble in the home whatever
[1:22:57] more you know and it's all about
[1:23:01] it's all about how you look at it
[1:23:04] it's all about perspective
[1:23:05] right so so it could either hinder you
[1:23:07] or it can enable you
[1:23:10] can either drive you to God or it can
[1:23:12] drive you away from God but it's your
[1:23:13] decision how it does it amen to the
[1:23:15] Apostle Paul will be chained to a
[1:23:17] chained to a soldier no I don't think he
[1:23:20] changed his way of doing anything before
[1:23:21] or after that Soldier maybe you pray out
[1:23:24] loud shout and praise God and give him
[1:23:26] glory he was a man who was dead in
[1:23:28] religion up to his eyeballs and
[1:23:30] formalism it is learning in the Pharisee
[1:23:32] of the Pharisees but he met the god of
[1:23:34] the Bible and he set a soul of flame and
[1:23:36] it was never the same and he counted all
[1:23:38] but done that he'll win Christ that's
[1:23:40] incredible you think he was dead he
[1:23:42] thought he was serving God he thought I
[1:23:44] don't need a savior I don't need
[1:23:45] salvation I'm holy I keep all the laws
[1:23:48] the Commandments the Washings all the
[1:23:49] ordinances I'm fine
[1:23:51] but he found out he was he was actually
[1:23:54] working against the very God he was
[1:23:55] claiming to serve actively trying to
[1:23:57] destroy his work upon the Earth
[1:23:59] so there he was he met God hallelujah
[1:24:02] God wanted to write a song
[1:24:04] some of our songs are longer than the
[1:24:05] others but God will still write a song
[1:24:07] amen so so a song began to be written
[1:24:10] out of out of out of you know out of the
[1:24:12] Apostle Paul's life now you'd think so
[1:24:14] I'm just kind of maybe I feel like I'm
[1:24:16] going forward and backwards all the time
[1:24:17] but you think if God wanted to write a
[1:24:19] song Give a testimony here just here
[1:24:20] just type it out
[1:24:22] send a copy of the music how it sung and
[1:24:25] just send it to the Earth that's not how
[1:24:27] God works God puts us through great
[1:24:29] trials and tests for a song to Be Sung
[1:24:32] amidst the Apostle Paul was chained to a
[1:24:34] Roman soldier I believe he would have
[1:24:36] kept praying he would have kept doing
[1:24:38] exactly the same before and after his
[1:24:40] imprisonment
[1:24:41] so that Soldier was there he praised God
[1:24:43] see remember this Soldier you think
[1:24:45] about you're stuck to a person you don't
[1:24:47] even know who's working for a government
[1:24:48] that wants to kill you ultimately he's
[1:24:50] not your friend he's not your buddy he's
[1:24:52] not a prayer partner he's not even a
[1:24:54] believer and maybe he'll change every
[1:24:55] certain day I don't know how it worked
[1:24:57] but your chain to the sky
[1:24:59] but yet here you are the church age
[1:25:01] messenger
[1:25:02] and God wants to pour out a song through
[1:25:04] your life see God just I love
[1:25:06] testimonies of Believers you think man
[1:25:09] Lord if you can do that for the Apostle
[1:25:11] Paul he would receive the book of
[1:25:12] Ephesians
[1:25:13] when he's chained to a Roman soldier he
[1:25:16] would receive Philippians film on
[1:25:18] Colossians yeah I've got in my notes get
[1:25:20] powerful scriptures from his writings
[1:25:22] just read all those books you read about
[1:25:24] the book of Ephesians the incredible
[1:25:25] power
[1:25:26] even just in a phrase of that amen you
[1:25:30] know I don't have one on me but you know
[1:25:32] it's an incredible incredible he
[1:25:34] received all this Revelation chained to
[1:25:36] a soldier in prison
[1:25:38] and it goes to show he was still the
[1:25:41] Apostle he still was an apostle he still
[1:25:43] ministered to people he prayed he
[1:25:46] received Revelation he gave it out you
[1:25:48] know all while in this condition and he
[1:25:51] was singing his song to its fullness
[1:25:54] Hallelujah he was living exactly what
[1:25:56] God wanted him to be even in that
[1:25:58] hardship amen I think Lord if if he can
[1:26:02] do that
[1:26:04] you know we think man I yo I just can't
[1:26:06] talk to the Lord right now he can't talk
[1:26:08] to me because of XYZ in my life the
[1:26:10] Apostle Paul had a lot of XYZ
[1:26:12] it didn't stop him receiving that
[1:26:14] Revelation to give to the church amen
[1:26:16] and so so anything in life should not
[1:26:19] stop us receiving that same Revelation
[1:26:21] to our hearts and it living in our lives
[1:26:23] Hallelujah
[1:26:25] see the Apostle Paul did not wait to be
[1:26:27] free from his chain in order to continue
[1:26:29] to walk with the Lord to pray to him to
[1:26:31] receive Revelation or to do the working
[1:26:32] of apostle he just continued on
[1:26:35] Hallelujah to me that's very powerful
[1:26:37] amen you take you take Brothers like
[1:26:39] brother Ron Spencer stage four cancer
[1:26:41] nearly three years ago Hegel was given
[1:26:44] one month to live nearly three years ago
[1:26:46] he keeps preaching he keeps traveling he
[1:26:49] keeps God said if you if you trust me
[1:26:52] I'll use you like never before before
[1:26:53] that first struck him stage four cancer
[1:26:55] and he said that's not just for him but
[1:26:57] that's for everyone if you can trust me
[1:26:59] I'll use you like never before and he
[1:27:01] just continued on even with he had a lot
[1:27:04] of troubles you can hear him you know
[1:27:05] before he starts preaching somebody's
[1:27:07] got to steady himself on the pulp and
[1:27:08] he's going to fall over just dizziness
[1:27:09] all kinds of trouble sickness whatever
[1:27:11] more because of the he's on the highest
[1:27:13] dose of chemo there is he's been on that
[1:27:15] for years
[1:27:16] but he still powers on why because God
[1:27:18] has to write a song God has to write a
[1:27:21] song and to me that that gives me great
[1:27:23] courage if I can
[1:27:26] I think I think compared to that you
[1:27:28] know hey we're all good you know there's
[1:27:29] nothing wrong but you know if he can
[1:27:32] stand and you know he can continue to
[1:27:34] minister wood and be a Christian be a
[1:27:36] believer in spite of that I think that
[1:27:38] can give us great courage we can rally
[1:27:39] and do the same thing
[1:27:41] Hallelujah so God has to write a song
[1:27:44] now testimony I mean sorry prophecy has
[1:27:47] to become reality it can't just sit as
[1:27:50] prophecy it has to become manifested now
[1:27:53] as I was saying before I went down that
[1:27:55] uh Segway very quickly and we'll come
[1:27:57] back to this now
[1:28:00] the term a new song is only written
[1:28:02] twice in the New Testament both in the
[1:28:04] Book of Revelation it's in the Old
[1:28:05] Testament a few times but it's in the
[1:28:07] new uh twice and that word new is
[1:28:11] different to the one in the old whether
[1:28:13] one in the old just means a fresh song
[1:28:15] but the one in you it has many different
[1:28:18] meanings but says one that's recently
[1:28:20] made it's fresh it's recent it's unused
[1:28:24] it's it's of a new kind it's
[1:28:27] unprecedented it's novel it's uncommon
[1:28:30] it's unheard of so if we take that
[1:28:33] language back into Moses day it was
[1:28:35] unprecedented that our army had been
[1:28:37] drowned it had been unprecedented a
[1:28:39] pillow guide as a pillow fire came down
[1:28:41] to bring in Exodus it was it was unheard
[1:28:44] of for a people Millions strong have
[1:28:47] them all with their cattle and all that
[1:28:48] they were to walk through a sea that was
[1:28:50] parted on dry ground that was unheard of
[1:28:53] so the song he was singing singing was
[1:28:55] unique amen your other nations around
[1:28:58] saying well that's not our our worship
[1:29:00] band doesn't sing that song that means
[1:29:02] nothing to us I mean a lot to him it
[1:29:04] mean a lot to Israel I mean why because
[1:29:07] I was singing a new song about of what
[1:29:09] God was doing in their midst amen now we
[1:29:11] live in the Third Exodus we understand
[1:29:13] that don't we the first one was was was
[1:29:15] Egypt Israel from Egypt to the promised
[1:29:17] land the second excess was under the
[1:29:19] Lord Jesus from a from a formal cold
[1:29:21] religion into the living way of of the
[1:29:24] Holy Ghost now the Third Exodus is from
[1:29:26] being filled with the Holy Ghost here to
[1:29:28] going into heaven it's a Rapture Exodus
[1:29:31] right being transported from this world
[1:29:32] to the next world Amen to know so we're
[1:29:35] living in unprecedented times I'm sure
[1:29:37] you've heard that phrase a few times
[1:29:38] this is unprecedented at times this is
[1:29:40] all you know the buzzwords with covert
[1:29:42] and stuff sure it is unprecedented at
[1:29:44] times we're living in a resurrection
[1:29:46] hour
[1:29:46] this is unprecedented this is this has
[1:29:49] never happened before where a whole mess
[1:29:51] of people have come out of the Grave the
[1:29:53] dead in Christ have resurrected the only
[1:29:55] time this ever happened when when Jesus
[1:29:57] gave up the ghost
[1:29:58] amen you know cried out with a loud
[1:30:00] voice it says in Matthew he says that
[1:30:01] many of the Saints arose and were seen
[1:30:04] of many and went up with him in the
[1:30:05] Ascension Hallelujah so it's really
[1:30:08] unprecedented it's really unprecedented
[1:30:10] that that a people would walk with God a
[1:30:12] whole mess of people around the Earth
[1:30:14] and I would walk with God like Enoch did
[1:30:17] and walk with them and be not because
[1:30:19] God takes them amen that's a that's
[1:30:22] really an unprecedented sure for one or
[1:30:23] two see Enoch was one Elijah was one but
[1:30:26] now a whole group of people not just men
[1:30:28] but women not just men or women but
[1:30:30] children boys and girls young and old I
[1:30:32] mean before we realize our bodies will
[1:30:34] be changed will be made young or old
[1:30:36] again you know instead of William going
[1:30:38] daddy will be Daddy
[1:30:40] he'll pick me up and say I've got your
[1:30:42] attention now Hallelujah
[1:30:44] I'm expecting it the girls will be this
[1:30:46] big and young Hallelujah fully grown
[1:30:49] before we realize
[1:30:50] sweep will come over will be changed
[1:30:52] amen hallelujah are you believing for it
[1:30:55] are you believing for it because we're
[1:30:57] living in the season of it amen and this
[1:30:59] is not some enthusiasm of a man this is
[1:31:01] God's doing I think God said in the end
[1:31:04] time as you see the world as the Sodom
[1:31:05] and Gomorrah age and light just like
[1:31:07] Noah David Noah we're living in that
[1:31:09] time this is when it will happen he'll
[1:31:11] come like a thief in the night but a
[1:31:13] thief comes to get what he wants and
[1:31:15] then he leaves
[1:31:17] he I'm what he's he's gonna get come get
[1:31:19] me he's gonna come get me oh look I
[1:31:22] trust he's put in your heart when he
[1:31:24] comes to take his bride away I'm part of
[1:31:26] that number
[1:31:27] holy I can't be left behind
[1:31:30] hello I trust you do you have that kind
[1:31:32] of faith not a sure it brings a feeling
[1:31:34] command yeah does it excite you because
[1:31:36] remember the the Rapture is universal
[1:31:38] around the world by the way you know
[1:31:41] Jesus said they'll be two in the bed
[1:31:42] we'll be taking one will be left that's
[1:31:44] night time two in the field won't be
[1:31:45] taking one bit if that's daytime so
[1:31:47] around the world see we don't have to
[1:31:48] get up and say okay I'm ready I'm ready
[1:31:51] I can't go to sleep now because I'm
[1:31:52] ready and if I'm asleep well I won't be
[1:31:55] ready no you'll be ready you'll be ready
[1:31:57] if you've got the Holy Ghost you're
[1:31:58] ready that means you can be asleep
[1:32:00] you'll be having the greatest dream and
[1:32:02] then you wake up and say hallelujah it's
[1:32:04] not a dream
[1:32:05] Hallelujah sorry I get happy you know
[1:32:08] but it's gonna be it should be such an
[1:32:10] assurance in our hearts
[1:32:12] when this Holy Ghost leaves the Earth
[1:32:14] we're going with them
[1:32:16] because we're part of him part of the
[1:32:18] word amen unprecedented things now John
[1:32:21] would be John would be taken he was on
[1:32:23] the spirit of the Lord's day now who's
[1:32:25] transported in time we can see this even
[1:32:27] in chapter one where where we heard a
[1:32:29] voice like a trumpet behind him and he
[1:32:31] turned to see seven golden candlesticks
[1:32:34] one like the son of man walking among
[1:32:35] them now that's the seven Church ages so
[1:32:37] where he is in time he's already gone
[1:32:38] past the seven Church ages and he's in
[1:32:40] eternity that's where he's taken on the
[1:32:42] Lord's day today is not the day of the
[1:32:43] Lord It's the day of man that's why man
[1:32:45] has his governments has his ways that's
[1:32:47] why the world is in this condition
[1:32:48] because it's the day of man but there'll
[1:32:50] come a day where's the day of the Lord
[1:32:51] so so he's already been transported past
[1:32:54] these ages and in his in eternity and we
[1:32:56] and he hears the voice behind him so so
[1:32:58] he turns around now and God is going to
[1:33:00] show him what's been going on in these
[1:33:02] seven Church ages amen because we
[1:33:04] understand the Book of Revelations a
[1:33:06] book of Prophecy it's also a book of
[1:33:07] symbols what do you see right in a book
[1:33:09] and send to the seven churches those
[1:33:11] seven churches are not just to those
[1:33:13] churches in Asia Minor but it speaks of
[1:33:15] a condition of certain periods of time
[1:33:16] from Calvary to now we know we're living
[1:33:18] in the lady of sin Church age Rich
[1:33:20] increased with Goods have need of
[1:33:21] nothing
[1:33:22] all around the world that way I was
[1:33:24] shocked when I was in Papua New Guinea
[1:33:25] this is a few years ago and and I was in
[1:33:27] a Pentecostal Church here at a Bible
[1:33:29] study and they said look we're rich
[1:33:30] increased with Goods and this it's a
[1:33:32] developing country very poor people have
[1:33:34] generators not a lot of power you know
[1:33:36] the village Christian I went to the
[1:33:38] where the church became Believers there
[1:33:40] they had no power at that time they have
[1:33:42] to go down to the creek even now to get
[1:33:43] water when it's a drought you know very
[1:33:45] but they think they're rich to increase
[1:33:46] with Goods because relatively they are
[1:33:49] from where they were a few maybe half a
[1:33:51] century ago to where they are now
[1:33:52] they've got it all
[1:33:54] so it it applies all around the world
[1:33:58] amen so we're so so we're living in that
[1:34:00] last stage now John would be taking CeCe
[1:34:03] after after the scenes of the church
[1:34:05] ages now he sees a door up in heaven
[1:34:07] open and that same voice has come up
[1:34:09] hither so that shows now because John
[1:34:11] himself is a symbol in the book yes
[1:34:13] right one person in a vision represents
[1:34:15] a whole body of people and so John has
[1:34:17] transported up into
[1:34:18] eternity there into the throne room of
[1:34:20] God and when he comes to that scene in
[1:34:22] Revelations five we won't we won't touch
[1:34:24] Revelations 4 but it's a continuation
[1:34:25] five is a continuation of four he sees
[1:34:28] now the book
[1:34:30] and the right hand of the one on the
[1:34:32] throne
[1:34:33] and he and he weeps much because he
[1:34:36] finds that no one he looks around and
[1:34:38] finds no one is worthy to take the book
[1:34:41] and he went much there was a strong
[1:34:43] Angel crying out who's worthy to take
[1:34:45] the book and he went much because he's
[1:34:46] looking around because he realizes that
[1:34:48] book is a symbol remember that book is a
[1:34:50] symbol of you
[1:34:51] it's a symbol of this redeemed Earth
[1:34:53] everything Adam lost is actually that
[1:34:54] title D that's in the right hand of God
[1:34:56] and so he's weeping because he realized
[1:34:58] unless a man is found worthy to take
[1:35:00] that book all of the plan of redemptions
[1:35:03] and Jeopardy because remember Redemption
[1:35:04] is two parts it's a purchase than a
[1:35:07] claim right Jesus purchased our
[1:35:09] Salvation on Calvary but then he has to
[1:35:12] come claim what he bought right because
[1:35:13] remember his blood poured upon the Earth
[1:35:16] so he purchased the Earth but the devil
[1:35:18] still runs this world right so so his
[1:35:21] blood purchased the Earth but also
[1:35:22] purchase you and I amen so now so now
[1:35:25] the Lord that's why when the new Heavens
[1:35:27] a new new Earth come into being there's
[1:35:29] a holy fire that burns the whole world
[1:35:31] off and burns all the Devils off it
[1:35:33] takes all the Devils away all the
[1:35:35] trouble all the strife and sorrow and
[1:35:37] pain why because the Lord isn't going to
[1:35:39] live in a haunted house
[1:35:41] just like you and I God doesn't live in
[1:35:43] a haunted house
[1:35:44] you know of a Believer that's full of
[1:35:46] unbelief and sin no God lives in a
[1:35:48] purified vessel right so so God's not
[1:35:50] going to come back to the Earth and it's
[1:35:52] going to be a haunted place and the
[1:35:53] shingles have fallen off the roof
[1:35:54] graffiti is everywhere it's just a like
[1:35:56] a squatter Camp no he's going to chase
[1:35:58] all the squatters away and by that I
[1:36:00] mean he's going to chase all the devil
[1:36:02] where he's going to throw them in a lake
[1:36:03] of fire praise God I'm going to be happy
[1:36:05] they're not there aren't you amen I look
[1:36:07] forward to that day when when the
[1:36:09] devil's absent and I'm not going to go
[1:36:11] looking for him
[1:36:12] praise the Lord we'll see him throw him
[1:36:14] to like a fire with your shout
[1:36:15] hallelujah and then we'll just move on
[1:36:16] praise God Amen so but he's weeping much
[1:36:20] now because he sees it no man is found
[1:36:22] worthy sure the angels will work would
[1:36:23] have been worthy but but it had to be a
[1:36:25] man had to be a kinsman redeemer who had
[1:36:27] come and purchased that book had to be
[1:36:28] one of Adam's race
[1:36:30] and that's why the Lord Jesus he didn't
[1:36:32] come as an angel to purchase our
[1:36:34] Salvation you can turn me down a bit
[1:36:35] something's gone a bit funny up here
[1:36:36] maybe my ears just unblocked I don't
[1:36:38] know but you know um you know he didn't
[1:36:40] come as an angel had to become as a man
[1:36:42] that's why he was created in the womb of
[1:36:43] Mary he became our kinsman redeemer
[1:36:45] praise God and then now and then so now
[1:36:48] now he's weeping much but then one of
[1:36:50] the one of the elders said weep not John
[1:36:52] for the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:36:54] prevailed Amen to to to to take the book
[1:36:57] and lose the seals thereof so now he
[1:36:59] couldn't see where the Lord is remember
[1:37:01] John is the Beloved disciple he loud in
[1:37:03] his bosom he was loved by the Lord he
[1:37:06] was with them everything he did but now
[1:37:07] he's looking he he couldn't see him
[1:37:09] there remember now this scene in
[1:37:10] Revelations 5 is all the redeemed of the
[1:37:13] ages of it symbolized in this thing so
[1:37:16] you and I are symbolized in the scene
[1:37:18] amen praise the Lord and then so he
[1:37:20] can't but then the Lord comes forth out
[1:37:22] of eternities because he's been the
[1:37:24] mediator upon the upon the throne and he
[1:37:26] still have mediator today but he steps
[1:37:29] forth now he's going to do something
[1:37:30] unprecedented
[1:37:32] it's unheard of it hasn't been you see
[1:37:34] the song has not been used yet because
[1:37:37] God has songs but in Seasons they come
[1:37:39] out that's why you see revivals down
[1:37:41] Through the Ages the hymnology changes
[1:37:44] because God is restoring different parts
[1:37:46] of his word praise God and then so now
[1:37:48] here he comes he steps forth and
[1:37:50] brothers the most Sublime act in
[1:37:52] scripture is the Lamb taking the book
[1:37:53] because here is a man without sin
[1:37:56] faultless perfect we're stood every test
[1:37:59] every trial he was tempted on All Points
[1:38:02] like we are but yet without sin he was
[1:38:04] he was tempted sexually with popularity
[1:38:07] everything kept it kept it on every hand
[1:38:10] but yet he did not follow that tint he
[1:38:12] stood the test
[1:38:13] Hallelujah and then when he came to
[1:38:15] Gethsemane he says not my will but thy
[1:38:17] will be done he surrendered his own own
[1:38:19] flesh to the to the word he had to
[1:38:21] fulfill and he went up there Victorious
[1:38:23] conquered hell death in the grave amen
[1:38:26] here he was Amen brother Brown says if
[1:38:28] we just lay aside our sinful thoughts
[1:38:30] long enough he'll Advance all the way to
[1:38:31] glory to you to you and I then so he
[1:38:34] takes the book
[1:38:36] and he loses the seals
[1:38:38] praise the Lord
[1:38:40] and it says in Revelations 5 and 7 and
[1:38:42] when he came and took the book out of
[1:38:43] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:38:44] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:38:46] The Four beasts and Four and Twenty
[1:38:48] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:38:50] every one of them Harps and golden
[1:38:51] valves full of odors which are the
[1:38:52] prayers of saints and now comes the
[1:38:54] unprecedented season where all the
[1:38:56] prayers of the ages can now be released
[1:38:58] before God some some prayers could only
[1:39:00] be answered now
[1:39:02] like the Believers you know all the way
[1:39:04] through the ages Lord when is the
[1:39:06] rapture going to happen
[1:39:07] I want to see the resurrection Lord I
[1:39:09] want to be upon the Earth with you and
[1:39:11] they would pray that but it wasn't the
[1:39:13] season for that prayer to be answered
[1:39:14] right are we okay there
[1:39:16] amen
[1:39:18] and they sung a new song
[1:39:21] this is an unprecedented song this has
[1:39:23] been an unheard of song
[1:39:25] praise the Lord they sung a new song
[1:39:27] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:39:29] to open the seals they're off for thou
[1:39:30] was slaying and has redeemed us to God
[1:39:32] by thy blood out of every Kindred and
[1:39:35] tongue and people and Nation see you're
[1:39:38] you're in that verse
[1:39:40] you're on that verse can you see
[1:39:42] yourself in the Bible people say I can't
[1:39:44] see myself in the Bible you're there
[1:39:45] that's you because every every Kindred
[1:39:48] Nation tongue and people praise the Lord
[1:39:50] so there we are
[1:39:51] amen so now remember it has to go from a
[1:39:54] book of Prophecy to a reality
[1:39:57] amen so now when John sorry sorry we're
[1:40:00] just gonna we're just gonna go to
[1:40:03] um where are we verse 5 and 10 where's
[1:40:05] five oh yeah and it's made us Kings and
[1:40:07] Priests
[1:40:10] so so now notice this they are like
[1:40:12] Moses they're praising God for what he's
[1:40:14] done but their worship begins becomes a
[1:40:17] prophecy speaking of future events right
[1:40:20] because why when you get in the spirit
[1:40:21] you begin to see things
[1:40:23] I mean so they saw him take the book now
[1:40:25] now this this has happened in this day
[1:40:28] right by the revelation of it has to
[1:40:30] come and strike our hearts that the Lord
[1:40:32] is in the process now of winding up his
[1:40:33] Plan of Redemption that's why it's
[1:40:35] called you by his word to himself why
[1:40:37] because he's got to call his bride
[1:40:38] before he can make the new Heavens A New
[1:40:40] Earth and different things right praise
[1:40:42] the Lord amen so he says now and so thou
[1:40:45] has made us Kings and Priests this is
[1:40:47] verse 10. so just like Moses the new
[1:40:49] song declares What the Lord Has Done but
[1:40:51] also prophesies of where the redeemed
[1:40:53] are going and we shall reign upon the
[1:40:55] Earth
[1:40:56] amen amen so so what's that looking
[1:40:59] forward to when are we going to rain
[1:41:02] well there's two parts of it send the
[1:41:04] millennium
[1:41:04] we are going to see this look forward to
[1:41:07] the Millennium so when the seals come
[1:41:09] off the book there's a revelation
[1:41:10] strikes the Earth we know where we're
[1:41:12] going see we shall reign upon the Earth
[1:41:14] so in other words we're going to go
[1:41:15] through a Rapture cycle we're going to
[1:41:17] be taking up to the wedding supper then
[1:41:18] we're going to come back to the Earth
[1:41:20] and reign in the Millennium with the
[1:41:21] Lord
[1:41:22] praise the Lord so this is what happens
[1:41:23] when the when when prophecy becomes
[1:41:25] reality Hallelujah you know where you're
[1:41:28] going it's not well how am I going to be
[1:41:29] part of it well those redeemed us back
[1:41:30] to God by thy blood and this is where
[1:41:32] we're going to go praise the Lord
[1:41:34] hallelujah amen now I believe we also
[1:41:37] have dominion now
[1:41:38] we have been given dominion over the
[1:41:40] flesh I mean over sin and over the devil
[1:41:43] amen we have dominion over self amen
[1:41:45] with us own flesh man can be subjected
[1:41:48] to the word of God I believe with all my
[1:41:49] heart Hallelujah and then now John CC
[1:41:53] John begins to get excited too he says
[1:41:55] now and and and and I behold and heard
[1:41:57] the voice of many angels round about The
[1:41:59] Throne of beasts and the elders a number
[1:42:00] of them were Ten Thousand Times Ten
[1:42:02] Thousand and thousands of thousands sang
[1:42:04] with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb
[1:42:06] that was slain to receive power and
[1:42:07] riches and wisdom and strength and glory
[1:42:09] and honor and glory and blessing and
[1:42:12] every creature which is in heaven and on
[1:42:13] the earth and under the Earth and such
[1:42:15] are under the sea and all in them heard
[1:42:17] I saying so now John is not just
[1:42:20] watching he's part of the great event so
[1:42:22] heard I saying blessing and honor and
[1:42:24] glory and power be unto him that sitteth
[1:42:25] upon the throne and unto the lamb
[1:42:27] forever and ever so John got a little
[1:42:30] bit excited when Revelation Struck it
[1:42:32] made a worship work has gone God wanted
[1:42:35] to write a song he has to write a song
[1:42:37] remember John is one one man as a symbol
[1:42:40] represents a whole body of people so
[1:42:41] when you when it's revealed to you see
[1:42:43] you can hear Brother Brown preaching
[1:42:44] about the lamb taking the book He's
[1:42:45] opened the seals it can just be in here
[1:42:47] right but when it goes from symbols to
[1:42:49] the lamb stepping forth finishing his
[1:42:51] work of redemption see when I first
[1:42:53] heard the seals I saw horse riders I saw
[1:42:55] tribulation I saw the 144 000 but then
[1:42:58] when I heard it again I just saw him
[1:42:59] step forth take the book and Redeem Me
[1:43:02] Hallelujah becomes a personal thing it's
[1:43:04] more than just symbols in a book it
[1:43:06] becomes reality
[1:43:08] praise the Lord amen said John
[1:43:10] everything and under the Earth
[1:43:12] Hallelujah in the sea every creature in
[1:43:14] heaven on the earth under the Earth and
[1:43:16] in the sea heard him
[1:43:18] his CCC his song began to cry out why
[1:43:21] because there's a revelation to him amen
[1:43:23] I see John got happy enough Hallelujah
[1:43:26] old John have been standing there crying
[1:43:27] so he went from crying to praising why
[1:43:30] and what changes cry to a praise is the
[1:43:32] Lord the lamb himself amen that's the
[1:43:34] same thing same thing with you and I we
[1:43:36] can have a cry but it'll turn into a
[1:43:38] praise when he comes upon the scene it
[1:43:40] goes from a cry to a praise Amen to
[1:43:42] remember you may be crying but it'll
[1:43:43] turn to a praise amen your current state
[1:43:46] of how you feel is not how you'll end up
[1:43:48] I mean when the lamb intersects that
[1:43:50] problem it'll turn into a praise holy
[1:43:53] just like Moses the you know God asked
[1:43:55] him why are you crying unto me speak and
[1:43:57] go forward so it went from a cry to a
[1:43:59] praise Hallelujah and old John have been
[1:44:02] staying there our brother crying why
[1:44:03] everything in heaven everything in Earth
[1:44:05] everything in the sea heard it heard me
[1:44:07] holler amen amen blessings and honor and
[1:44:09] might and power be to him that liveth
[1:44:11] forever and ever talk about a happy time
[1:44:13] when them seals broke John must have
[1:44:15] looked in and seen past the curtain of
[1:44:17] time and said there's John hi Leah so
[1:44:19] when the seals come open you look past
[1:44:21] the curtain of time and see yourself
[1:44:22] already in glory glorified
[1:44:26] Hallelujah talk about a happy time I may
[1:44:28] talk about a happy time when that
[1:44:30] Revelation came of our lamb the Redeemer
[1:44:32] our Kinsmen had come back from the
[1:44:34] Throne of mitatory and walked out there
[1:44:35] to take his possession Hallelujah
[1:44:39] amen see that's immensely powerful to me
[1:44:42] why because God wants an unprecedented
[1:44:44] unheard-off song in this hour
[1:44:47] that's why we can sing worthy as the
[1:44:49] lamb that will slain why because we've
[1:44:51] seen him step forth in this day that's
[1:44:53] why brother bam when he's preaching the
[1:44:54] bridge he says he says let that strong
[1:44:56] Angel cried out who's worthy to take the
[1:44:57] book he says maybe I'm just feeling this
[1:44:59] way but let him come and open the word
[1:45:01] it's an event that's unfolded in this
[1:45:03] hour amen and we can look into the word
[1:45:04] and we can see our part in the book
[1:45:06] Hallelujah talk about her getting in the
[1:45:09] spirit amen we can look into the book
[1:45:11] and say it's not a book of symbols it's
[1:45:13] a reality we see our position in the
[1:45:15] book and our position the book takes us
[1:45:17] amen from seeing the Lamb step forth all
[1:45:20] the way into a new heavens and new earth
[1:45:21] and we don't get cars into a lake of
[1:45:23] fire no we continue on when the devil is
[1:45:26] no more we still shall be that's why we
[1:45:28] can Rejoice amen this comes a time of an
[1:45:31] End Amen where the devil has been
[1:45:33] defeated Hallelujah just like Moses
[1:45:35] Moses in Israel they could realize it's
[1:45:37] an end of Egypt right there in the Red
[1:45:40] Sea and we can rejoice as the end of the
[1:45:42] devil beating us down I mean causing
[1:45:45] trouble in our lives why because we've
[1:45:47] gone through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:45:48] if you truly go through his blood the
[1:45:50] enemy is dead and all he can be haunted
[1:45:52] by is a memory but you've got to take
[1:45:54] the devil back there and say devil the
[1:45:56] last time I saw you the last time this
[1:45:59] thought was in my mind that was
[1:46:00] troubling me I saw it face down and the
[1:46:03] blood of Jesus Christ and there it
[1:46:05] remained so you get back to where you
[1:46:07] belong faced out in the blood of Jesus
[1:46:09] Christ drowned Hallelujah
[1:46:12] I mean talk about a happy time
[1:46:15] maybe we could get in the spirit you
[1:46:17] think about what God has done and he'll
[1:46:19] show you things to come
[1:46:20] Hallelujah for you and I amen let's
[1:46:22] stand this morning shall we Worthy is a
[1:46:25] lamb that was slain
[1:46:27] Hallelujah

[2:11:57] Jesus died and rose again
[2:12:03] just as I'm
[2:12:05] the music's playing I just thought he
[2:12:08] remembered a testimony when brother Ben
[2:12:10] was um reading Exodus 14.
[2:12:13] and um
[2:12:15] brother Adam knows this one running news
[2:12:18] um I just wanted to share it because you
[2:12:21] know God is good all the time
[2:12:23] amen and um you know we if you know our
[2:12:26] story back six years ago maybe
[2:12:30] Brother Andy and I we were in business
[2:12:31] we still owe and we were in a spot of
[2:12:33] bother
[2:12:34] we we were being we we it just was a it
[2:12:39] just ended up in a situation where we
[2:12:40] had to pay maybe four hundred thousand
[2:12:42] dollars tax and all the stuff we would
[2:12:44] we were done for all money you know and
[2:12:46] um it was over for us our financial life
[2:12:49] was over but you know I felt the Lord
[2:12:51] said just right after a few years of
[2:12:53] battling this it looked like it was the
[2:12:54] end of the road and they were gonna we
[2:12:56] were gonna close up shot but the Lord
[2:12:59] said no write a letter and write these
[2:13:01] things and I just had a bunch of these
[2:13:02] things to
[2:13:04] point out to them and and kind of when
[2:13:06] you do a letter or a
[2:13:09] application you call like you call these
[2:13:12] things exhibitions you know so ex and
[2:13:14] exhibition so I was writing a letter and
[2:13:16] I'd got a bunch of these out and I
[2:13:18] realized there were 14 of them so I
[2:13:20] thought that I so as I was writing it I
[2:13:22] wrote e x dot one you know exhibition
[2:13:24] one exhibition two and I compiled all of
[2:13:27] these different things as to why the
[2:13:30] situation has been there and all that
[2:13:31] sort of thing but when I got to 14
[2:13:33] I I thought where's my 14th exhibition I
[2:13:37] had 14. it was ex 14 and I thought I'm
[2:13:40] sure I counted 14 before I started this
[2:13:42] project because it was quite a big
[2:13:43] project
[2:13:44] but there were only 13 blood miscounted
[2:13:46] and 14 and um and I think brother Arman
[2:13:50] came in that day and he said uh it's
[2:13:52] because it looks like Exodus 14 he said
[2:13:54] uh no you're in Exodus 14 14 that's your
[2:13:57] 14th exhibition and Exodus 14 14 said
[2:14:01] the Lord shall fight for you and you
[2:14:04] shall hold your peace
[2:14:07] and you know the Lord defeated that
[2:14:09] enemy Was Defeated overnight we one day
[2:14:11] we had it all all the debt the next day
[2:14:13] was completely gone overnight but that's
[2:14:17] the god that we serve amen let this
