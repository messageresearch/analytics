were unworthy lord who were good for nothing but you made us to be worthy lord jesus and we are so thankful tonight that father we can stand lord on the altar this evening just to lift up our hearts and our hands and our lives lord so that you can brood over us as you promised in your word thank you for your choosing your full knowledge for these people thank you for each one of them master we praise your name we worship you [Music] in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you i greet you tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ i greet you all in the name of our lord jesus christ this evening hallelujah that's much much better hey i'm so glad to see each one of you welcome to all our visitors i don't see any unfamiliar face my sister over here did i see you on the road yeah yeah yes man i felt so guilty when i passed you and you passed me again you were talking to me but i was on the phone so i thought this this sister looks familiar so we came from the same bus i think so the lord bless you amen so if it was possible i was going to be commending on each and every one of you individually you know just to show you that you are so special before the lord amen i was going to start from brother isaac and and say welcome and each one of you but we haven't got much time to do that so we need to redeem the time while we have the little bit we have amen how many how many are happy to be in the service tonight let's just put everything aside anything that can come in your mind in your eyes in your memory anything put it aside just for now just pause it let's focus on the lord amen i'm happy to be here it's a wonderful privilege brother isaac thank you so much for the songs tonight may god bless you i think you can take the comfort of your seats you and the crew god bless you richly for bringing us in thank you boys god bless you and now you're leaving me here alone and exposed but i believe you're leaving me with the lord jesus amen i believe as the word of god says where two or three i get that in my name i will be in your midst amen and that is a promise of the word of god uh the lord is so happy to have you here this evening so that he can fulfill his weight and then uh oh yes yes before i go far happy birthday to our dear friend brother jonathan you can see tonight he's even wearing a tie amen happy birthday my boy god bless you and uh i would like to just make just just set up the time if you don't mind last time i preached very long and and and i felt wrong i felt condemned afterwards because though you know at home when we eat every home the mother dishes the food and some bring big plates some bring small plates so the one who brought the big plate get a lot and the one who bring a small plate also go get according to the plate so but sometimes the mother just feel a bit you know that i don't want to give him too much so some once more someone's a little bit someone's but we must just try to accommodate everyone but there's one person that we have to accommodate this evening and that is the lord jesus christ because he he opened everything and accommodated us so i believe tonight you have not come to see me and you have not come to to see one another we have come to meet the lord jesus christ because if you have come to see me i'm afraid you're going to go back home disappointed because for me i've got nothing to give you nothing absolutely zero only the lord jesus he's the one who can give you something here tonight even if we just speak for five minutes the lord jesus christ can give you just one way that is so powerful to turn your life around that is so powerful to give you a a long lasting testimony he is able to do that so before we go any far any further let me just get this brother ben i watch just to to guide me amen i've already greeted you let's read the bible and then we can can sit down so um yeah um i would like us to i wonder how many how many can tell me what are we talking about today what is our title today how many knows nobody knows [Laughter] my girls in the front what did i say last time that we were talking about overcoming power part one remember how many remembers okay i forgive you but at any rate last time we spoke about the overcoming power and we said not by might not by power but my spirit says the lord you recall now does it click so that's what we spoke about and then today we are speaking about the overcoming power part two we want to focus on what really it takes what does it take to get that overcoming power what does it take let's read john 1st john chapter 5. first john chapter five and oh yeah thank you what yes now i'm in control now thank you first john chapter five and we'll read the verse 4 and verse 5. if you are there just say amen now the bible says for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the way the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god let's just pray heavenly father once again dear lord um we feel insignificant we feel unworthy to read this word lord but we know master that you are the only one who can even interpret it into our hearts you are the only one lord who can speak the spirit of the way of the lord in this word that we have read anyone can open the bible and read but master it takes your inspiration it takes your anointing father lord it does not even take what i can do or read or anything it takes you lord jesus to come tonight and anoint your weight to the hearts of your children so we prayed here father that you come at this moment even according to your promise because lord you said you will be with us you said where two or three i gathered in my name and here's your people lord we are gathered under no other name but the name of our lord jesus christ and lord we have believed in your weight and we know that your weight will never go out and come back to you empty and i pray dear lord that you bless it to the lives of your children to their hearts in the name of our lord jesus christ master we also pray we don't want to forget lord to say father forgive us forgive our wrongs lord our mistakes our trespasses understanding that we are still wearing this flesh that is so weak that is so susceptible to so many errors and mistakes that is so weak and we pray dear lord that you forgive us where we have wronged you where we have where we have mistaken you lord where we have let you down and disappointed you so that father we can be free and ready to eat from your table tonight lord even as we forgive anyone who has wronged us we forgive them unconditionally father that's the attitude you gave us in the lord's prayer we ask that you help us tonight as we commit the saviors and your children in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray and the church all say amen you can enjoy the comfort of your seats and as i've said that we we're going to speak about that title overcoming power and you know the prophet teaches us that when we come with the right attitude before god when we come with a and you know the right attitude is a positive one are we together today i'm not going to be jumping around i'm hoping there will be no muscle pulls there will be no cramps today hallelujah how many confess is that today there will be no claims of the devil and he teaches us that you know when you come i'm hearing some echo but i'm hearing myself speaking after myself he says when we come with the right mental attitude you know we can get every promise of god fulfilled in our lives if we come with a right mental attitude so the right mental attitude i want to believe that is a positive one the right mental attitude the right attitude is not the attitude when you come with a preconceived idea how many how many knows what is their preconceived idea you know a preconceived idea brother john is when i come to you to talk to you but i already have a conclusion preconceived idea is the one when i come to speak to you i already have a perception towards you i already have a a view no we come viewless tonight the only view we are going to hear is the view of the lord because because we want him to pour all of him in us we don't want him to pour himself in us and find out ah there's still a little bit of in there how will he fill that cup when there's still a bit of me in there no preconceived idea only positive arty my girls god bless you so we we we we we we want to look at what we want finish this is such a big salmon this is the word of god is a mountain of bread we'll never finish it we will eat it and the more we eat you know it's like it's increasing because it's so massive you can't finish it so we are just going to bite a little bit that we can buy to fill our bellies for tonight and we go home when we come back another minister will preach here and we fail again we want more and more and more of god every time as long as every time we come we come with an expected heart so the bible we read there in the book of john it says for whatsoever is born of god overcoming the world whoever is born of god overcome ever well we'll talk of a few things that are going to be showing us what is it what it takes to overcome what what what happens what what should you actually be doing for you to get this overcoming power that's what we're going to talk about just a few and then we'll go home when i mean few i mean few few slides just you see those you see that that outline that outline has got only seven points and you know seven is a powerful number are we together so each one of those topics there or sub heading has got only two slides maximum two not not more than two but mario two slides on average or one per topic then we go home isn't that lovely i think we will be full at that time those who want more they can stay then i'll continue so we'll we'll just look at what do we fight for what exactly are we fighting for it's not just victory we are fighting for life we are fighting for a kingdom we are fighting we are we are fighting who can tell me what we are fighting you know there's so much that is on our plate that is at stake that we are fighting for tonight i just put victory there but there's so much amen but when you're fighting for victory when you're fighting for faith when you're fighting for healing when you're fighting for answer when you're fighting for understanding for revelation for anything you go by the rules of the game that's the next aspect that we look at because if you don't go by the rules of the game you're going to fail you're going to be disqualified you'll be kicked out of the game because you are not following the rules of them so god also has got the rules of the game those rules of the game they are built in in his weight right we'll look at that then we look at uh how to keep on eating or drinking the weight because you cannot get this overcoming power if you are not eating it when i give the child food i expect him to eat in order to grow if he does not the opposite happens are we together you understand children i want the little ones also to follow me tonight i don't want you to sleep i don't want you if i see you warning two times i'll call your name amen okay then we'll look at number four a purpose-driven life the prophet teaches us that you know we we must have a purpose yes you know in life physical life the life here on earth we've got the purpose you know we've got a vision but now here in in this economy of god you must also have a purpose we'll talk about that we'll talk about uh the purpose for the things of god you know like saving testifying living the life in such a way you know having a purpose waking up every day with a peoples amen then we look at when do you get when do you get your overcoming your overcoming i meant to put an are there when do you get your overcoming when actually when do you start to get your overcoming power and i said that when you start to take your impossibilities head on the impossibilities i mean those things that that according to the flesh they are not possible when you start taking those things sister jenny you need to get healed when you start taking them head on because it doesn't matter if we take them head on or not the fact of the matter is that one of the tumors happen win or lose if we don't take them head on as the lord has told us then we lose but if we take them head on regardless of our circumstances you'll find that we win because the prophet said confess and confess and confess it until another songwriter said no matter what the circumstances or what i see or feel the word is working mightily in me that's the word of god so it doesn't matter what the face value is what the outside what the doctor what the work doesn't matter whether it's winter or summer the way it was spoken and it has to come to pass so my job is to confess it is to is to speak it as if it's already there so we'll talk we'll talk about that then we also talk about letting the pilot to do his work and that pilot he we must let him pilot this aeroplane we cannot go in the cockpit and try to help him you'll see because if you try to start to interfere with the that's why if you go in the airplane they lock that door to the cockpit it's locked so that i must not disturb i must have full confidence in the pilot to pilot this aeroplane then lastly we'll talk about the power to enforce what god spoke it needs to be enforced we'll talk about it so let's just start off the all these slides i've just typed what the prophet said i'm not gonna say much of my words but we'll just be reiterating knowing very well that you read and you listen to them but just to refresh us just to remind ourselves are we together as you know i'm not that much of a an international preacher i'm just a simple local brother so now here the prophet says so so many people today i find when they join a church here especially in america especially in new zealand they just become drifters do you know what is a drifter last time we spoke about a dead wood that looks so nice and big in the but but surprisingly it's just floating in this in this hard river and when you go to it you you check oh this is hollow inside yeah we mustn't be like those people we mustn't be like those people who are just drifters they are just well praise god i met brother branham and i've got say and i got saved and i put my name in the book and that's all all i've done just drifting we don't want to do that we don't want to do that no it's better if we don't get in the river in the first place it is better to do that because it's not helping you to float and not be part of the river you need to have some substance in the word of god amen you never got saved just to be a member of a church just to be a member no we are not looking for members are you brother ben we are we are not looking for any members brother andy yeah i believe for the cuban even if here we can just be seven huh i'm talking to the elders now brother brother phil even if we can just be seven of us we'll be sufficient isn't it i'm not saying go away i'm saying we are not looking for members god last time we said he does not look for count as according to numbers he weighs us so it's not help therefore just to be a member just to come to church i'm talking also to you young people just that's to say no no mom and papa are going my man dada okay uh where do you fellowship stokes really where what um what is your church you see when you grant those into stocks very no no no tell the person what you believe tell them that jesus christ that i serve he's done this and this and this and this and if you come to my church you'll find that kind of a life and my church by the way believes we believe i believe that god has sent a message today because the kingdom of god is is upon us he said what yes brother this world is about to finish we were told many many years ago why are you not told no just know that you are very lucky that i'm meeting you the world is coming to an end that was told to us secretly but it was revealed and told to me i want to tell you now it's coming to an end this world huh but have you been baptized dude what do you believe then you start to get the inroads but the more we don't tell then the people won't know what we believe find a way that god will express it through you i'm not prescribing how but i'm just saying just be open with what god has done for you in your life say what you believe you will never send anybody away by telling them what you believe if they go away and they don't accept it it was not meant to be but you have done the part you have done you have fulfilled the commission hallelujah so where was i you you got you got saved to work that's what we got saved to do not just to come and fill up the seas and fill up the numbers we got saved to work in this economy of god that's what we don't dress an army up just to lay around on the corner and fled with the girls huh with pretty uniforms on can you just imagine about it that's the prophet is not me i never read those let me just have a disclaimer at the end the prophet priesthood we we just we don't dress the soldiers in an army and spend you know the budget for the military is always the highest it's a huge military budget in every country why because they mean business we have to fight when there's a need when there's a time to fight we fight so we don't dress them and put spend so much just for them to be working in town and we say look at our army that's our army no they are supposed to fight and you and me what were we safe to do because the lord jesus showed us why he came here on earth and we are supposed to follow on his footsteps he was crucified we're supposed to be crucified he was ah was the weight he was ridiculed we must be ridiculed he suffered we must suffer so he lived a life we must live a life he was a simple man we must be simple men and women so everything that the lord jesus christ went through we must go through even more than that he said right so i'm gonna move with speed this is the only slide for that for that title so that's can you see my promise was true now we train our army to fight and we are not at a picnic beautiful country we live in with lots of parks and where we can have picnics but spiritually we are not in a picnic we know the day we fight every day we are on a battleground we are right here facing the enemy of our lord jesus and the enemy of our souls let us be up and doing with the heart of any for any strife that's what the prophet said that was taken from that message there what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith will be quoting from that a tape if we're changing the tape i'll tell you which one right so we need to be able to to come to a point where we fight for our victory and we must understand that this is a war and a war is not something where in the morning one day you wake up and say ah today i don't feel like fighting no it's a permanent situation until one of the sites say i surrender i'm defeated peace and raise a white flag that is going it's our lifetime and that's what we signed up for we signed up for that and now and and the lord promised to be with us and help us right let's move on what are the rules of the game you know today i didn't make a powerpoint so i'll be looking here and there if i can't see there i'll look here you don't mind it i know you're very nice people you don't mind for me to look here and give you my my back but i'll turn around and talk to you if i can't see there now and that's what that's the way we have to do the race of life that we are running now it has to be played according to god's qualifications and we will lose when we get there we will lose when we get there whether we are the president whether we are the governor or the minister or what church we belong to and what denomination the rules of the game has to be kept what are the rules of the game can tell me what are the rules of the game can somebody just take a try the word of god thank you brother who said that brother ben did you say that sister lita oh sister naomi thank you my sister the word of god is actually our rules we often here say oh you know we we are not a what do they call it liberal or oligar legalistic you know church we are not legalistic or liberal that's fine that's all good or we are liberal or we are not that is not the issue the issue is god has got rules but you see god's rules are not like the rules of the world the rules of the world are the do's and don'ts you know it do and don't thou shall not and thou shalt no the rules of of god are his word and because we signed up willingly by repentance to this we took god's word and it operates in our lives it's not something that we see as a burden as a load no no that's the rules that's how we operate the bible somewhere says you know god's mind is so strange it's different from our our physical mind god does not operate i like that message that brother isaac preached one day it blessed me so much it was like he took me back to before he came here on earth and i was imagining i was dramatizing seeing myself saying oh actually oh that's how it happened and i was like that and we now we are here i seem to have forgotten what happened then because there was a life before here and we came here and we've come in in this situation and we seem to we don't remember but the word of god is here to remind us now the rules these rules that we are talking about is that we must run it fair and we must play it by the rules we must preach the word we must do it willingly i've never heard about a woman who they say she got married okay it happens in some other cultures but that's not a legit marriage where she just get involved in a relationship unwillingly we are not that bright we got in willingly sister k isn't it we got in willingly and that is why we can't cannot come in willingly and then start to drift and we are going to operate according to the word of god which is the rules of the game otherwise we will be like that man who came in through the window and when when the man of the wedding saw him he said how did you come in here because he did not have a rope and he said to the messengers they must take him out and they kick him out so we don't want to be disqualified like that we come according to the rules and those rules are the word of god right we must preach it so and tonight as born again christian as believers here at the end time i believe we are in the end time now we've got to play the game according to the rules we've got to run with patience the race that is set before us looking to the author and finisher of our faith which is christ jesus and and he's the rule setter he does not set the rules that he can do himself no he's a very fair god he's a very fair empire or captain or whatever you can name him right he has not set the rules and say hey you will carry this thing there today but he doesn't carry it himself he's not like that he's a very fair employer i made a statement last time the other time i said you know we are not employed our satellites are not paid by our current employers if you know promotion it does not come from our our current employers brother brother brother cooper no our promotion our bonus our pay slips are paid from heaven not from our even our jobs i told my former boss many times ago many years ago i said you know if you don't want to hire me and a god wants me to be hired there's nothing you can do about it is i said yes that's the god i said if he wants me there and you don't want you can do nothing i'll be there he was amazed and i said to him if you don't if you want me there if you want me there and my god does not want me there there's nothing you can do to bring me there because my god does not want me there so that's how we operate those are the rules of god we hear from our head office our head office it's not here we've got a head office so in that whole head office i've got rules the rules that are not according to the rules of this earth and that's the word of god amen we are going back as brother andy says it to an idiotic condition how things were in eden in eden the rules were different and that's why we are go we are just almost there we are almost there we can feel eating almost we can feel it the rules of eden are already in operation here in our lives today we are just about to finish the last slap and we are in and it will be that will be fully there now this flesh will be out so those rules we are not going to start to practice them today they start here those rules is not rules like no you must hold your arms no it's not like that it's the rules that you must be free in the spirit ah my sister analysis i'm sorry to pick on you because he was falling arms but those rules are very different we cannot even think how those rules are because those rules are the word of god and is there given all we do to live by the rules we just leave the word of god on a daily basis are we together we'll jump to the next point keep on drinking and eating the weight i cannot over emphasize this point this is said over and over on this pulpit and we need to really remind ourselves that it cannot just be taught and preached taught and preached and then we don't do it john said we must be doers and not only hear us right so we must be able to come to a point where we eat until we get to be like enoch what is to eat the word of god you know you just that just by listening just by listening listening to the word of god and hearing it right and and consuming it with your spirit right in other words internalizing it okay i pray the lord will help me to express it the way that that that that i want to express it you know sometimes you i talked about the marion or i talked to brother phil andersen but you can hear that this person is not hearing you he say brother do you hear me why why do you say that when the man is looking at you because you can hear he's hearing you but he's not hearing you so we must when we eat the word of god we must really eat it eat it fully consuming it through getting through your system how can i put it through your spirit down into your soul we cannot eat it selectively like when other children don't want hey i don't want this vegetable i want no no no no we eat everything the whole lot sweet and bitter we eat it and we we eat it and swallow it so that it can benefit us that is why here the prophet says oh then what do you have to do is to drink drink and keep on are we there we have to drink and drink from this fountain and keep on drinking because that is where our growth that is where our rapture lies don't don't just stop when you join a church and baptize and then you just keep on just keep on drinking you have faith that for this and faith for that and faith for this and push out until all the manifestations of the holy spirit is living in a church that's what will happen if we keep on drinking and drinking and drinking by drinking i don't mean you don't listen to the tapes i don't mean you don't eat your weight but consume it i'm licking the vocabulary to express it to eat the word of god is not just to just to listen absentmindedly or listening it because the pastor sent someone for us to listen there's no compliance you know compliance [Laughter] those who work in the auditing and fine finance you know every month we must submit the financials or every year the auditors must come and they take the boxes oh no we've complied with that you know all those who are in safety builders they know when we put those talents that vanille you know it must be according to the rules we must comply so some people when they do the jobs we just do it for compliance if the inspector come and open whoa underneath there like but the end was saying it's just vanilla on top at the bottom you don't want to see there so we are not doing compliance whether i'm with someone whether the pastor sent a tape in fact we must remind the pastor hey pastor you have not sent the tape i'm ready to consume huh we must be ready last time we spoke about hunger so we must be ready thirsty and hungry to consume and to drink from the inside from the very inside not selectively i i i you know when i grew up and don't love it i say when i grew up we used to eat meat brother queen you know those who grew up poor when we eat meat because it was only coming once in a while we eat that bone of a chicken and and it is smooth if possible you you break even that bone and eat it you see so i don't believe it i must eat if there's a bone you must throw it away no that bone must not have a piece of meat on it it must be clean if you see that you are eating and you throw some other bones with meat i'm sorry if you do that and you throw in the bin some bones still have meat you're actually wasting you are wasting why did we give you meat for you to throw away no it has got bones with bones in the bone if you care [Laughter] make sure that that bone has got no piece of meat otherwise why is papa going to work every morning for you to eat so make sure you eat limbo spirit on the spiritual side that's what i'm talking about we need to make sure that we drink we eat because that is what is going to bring the manifestation of the spirit in the to the living i mean to the living church of god amen that is what because and tonight we understand that if you plant a tree and you irrigate it it it to drink and it draws its strength from the water on earth until it pushes out and bears fruits and that's what we want that's what we want that a child must eat and grow and start to push and help branches and start to have their fruits and bear fruits because if my mother is a farmer if she plants a tree she's got like green green hands they say green hands she can plant anything if she plans and it does not start to do what she wants she takes it out if he does not grow properly and he can this one is going to waste my water and my soil food it must go out she plucks it out gets the right tree that will bear fruits one day she even planted a he planted a an orange tree and it grew nicely and bare fruits oranges but when we ate those oranges they were not sweet ah she she looked at these cheese what can i do i she didn't plug it out because it was bearing fruits she went and bite and bought 12.5 kilogram of sugar the next season she put it she put it there on the tree that's sugar now strangely enough that sugar was processed by the soil it was processed when the oranges came they were so nice [Laughter] [Applause] so so so we must not do that that's what my mother did but we must bear fruits that are even sweet not just the fruits that people use ah i don't it's already so we must bear fruits that are sweet and that can only happen if we drink and we eat the word of god right and we bear those fruit it draws more than its portion more than here in the gospel we work according to different rules in the gospel in the message in the word of god when a child is too much like brother brother a brother the failure was listening yesterday to their service he said we are we are latinas you know we we we don't we don't we don't reprimand children for eating too much according to the rules of the world they must eat until they can't eat anymore but in the world they say no no no don't eat you'll be obese in the word we want you to be obese can you see different rules there it's not there is different rules of the game in the world we want you to so so that we can expand the door through there so that if you can't fit we expand it for you and the lord will make a big door double door for you to come because you'll be strong in the way you will be able to create another f that's that's what that power of the word will give you you'll be there i want another planet there because you'll be so strong you'll be so big and it's so simple because ah that one he was that one johnny i know no that one is the one who go to him to pray for you go to john to pray for you he said john from taranaki yes that one you mean then he said yes go to him he'll pray for you if you go according to the rules you're going to go brother john the lord said i must come to you to pray for me not how i know you not how i hate about you not how i see you no the lord said i must come to you to pray for me didn't he say that king must go to abraham but abraham just lied yes and he said go to abraham to the men who lied yes why because he's the son of god he's full of the fruits of god if you go to him if you go to brother branham yes with his mistakes go to him he's your prophet that one who no no no no did you see did you he he can't yes that one that one you're saying you can't dedicate himself that's for you but you go to him to pray for you those people in sakana tabernacle is there pastor benny those ones yes those ones those are yours that's brother adrian said at the last camp he said you know we've got we've been given the authority we are the only access to eternal life not in a proud and boastful way but we are the access to eternal life for people of the world and the sooner we realize this the better are you in agreement elizabeth you and me have been given the power access to give people to teach them eternal life for you eternal life eternal life eternal life and you can't say no yeah i can't give you no eternal life you give them because we have been given access to give them and you are going to do it with love the way the lord jesus did it amen let's move on now a purpose-driven life this is a very passionate topic even in the world because the world says it from the time from from the approach and perspective of being you know successful of being you know you know being you know properly oriented about what you want to achieve but you see to be a purpose to have a purpose-driven life is have a mission an intended goal to achieve that's merit that's me who wrote there that's not the prophet that statement right for example to save souls now now each and every young person we expect you to have a purpose fathers and mothers i used to tell people that you know families a family of us have its own mission statement what do we want to achieve as a family and the end of the year there's a an annual meeting that brother isaac holds with his family and he changed that meeting he's okay guys jesse come what did we achieve this year what what was our mistakes and we checked that and we we then we we re-strategize now we have to have a purpose-driven life with christ and the christ have already given us the peoples amen the church today has got a bigger building than it ever had better churches better dress people better living people than ever ahead but oh brother there's not the thing that's not the thing those things will perish we've got the big we've got the victory we've got to fight we've got to do something for the kingdom of god that's where our people's lives our purpose should be about that's supposed to be our purpose i understand everything else of the flesh that's well and good in any case it's only coping from the spiritual so it's the spiritual side it's our spiritual life first then our purpose in life physically will be lined up so we need to have a purpose me this year my new year resolution there's nothing wrong with a new year resolution no my new year resolution can be this year my new year resolution lord with your permission with your will i'm going to testify to two people a day just to tell them about you two minutes five minutes that's my mission so that by the end of the 365 days i would have testified to twice that number 365 times 2 how much is it 7 30 is it 78 yes right so if you have a young person who's got such a purpose and he is driven by that every day and oh you you have time to look at things of god and say oh you know what you know because because let's make no mistake we sit down and spend a lot of time planning and thinking of how our life should be what we want to achieve what what you want to work hard towards every day even before you sleep and talking to honey say honey oh you know if we can do this that's good but what about for god what are we discussing about god yes what are we discussing and talking with honey about the things of the kingdom of god what is our purpose if you don't talk to her i know what your loved one or anyone or your children you as an individual what you want to achieve for god this year or today well that's just about the way the people gets in we've got to have something that we've got a purpose for we've got to purpose in our hearts we've got to do something now you say oh we are having a revival yeah we are over in the eisenhower school auditorium that's where they were during this message don't let that be you just floater and a drifter you can't you can never amount to anything like that let's get up to do something about it let's put our shoulder on the wheel let's see that our chest prospers let's get the kingdom prospering the economy of heaven that's what we need to do and never underestimate that is too small i can't do it are we together how many agrees with the prophet now purpose driven life is still continuing we've got to pay for something we've got something to do with it something to do for the purpose that's why john said don't let's not just be do us i mean hear us but do us do us it goes even beyond how i live my life it means to go around giving people what i was freely given until people can say ah he's here the pastor they call you pastor when you are a lady i don't know what they will call you you know some of us are giving names whenever we arrive and you don't know who told them they just already know that oh no no you know samsung that was that that picture guy so they must give you names and if you know that now i'm doing a great job for god i'm giving names which means i'm doing some work for god and we'll go to the next slide because i'm checking my time carefully find your ambition have a purpose that you are going to be healed for the glory of god you see that's where the key is everything that we ambition everything that we prop we propose it has to be for the glory of god if we come with that approach we will find that we are successful because we don't want to bring praise unto ourselves we are doing it for the glory of god right if i want to come and stand here and brother ben says preacher say yes so that i can be praised wrong so that they can say hello oh brother oh brother no no wrong it must be for the glory of god or else sit down right it must be for the glory of god otherwise who am i who am i it must be for the glory of god for the economy of our father for our kingdom i'm going to receive it and you'll get it yesterday you will get it if you come with attitude that i will get the healing i will i will do this for the lord i'm determined the lord is willing he has given his word for me to do this he will do it and he will achieve it by his help amen right when do you get your overcoming now this is very interesting because there are certain things that when the world look at them they are impossible there are certain things that our flesh does not agree with us to do there are certain things that when when we start to think of them even our our mind go against that but the moment we start taking those things the moment we start heading taking them head on the impossibilities according to the world impossibles that's when we start to overcome that's when we start to get the power the moment we start to to you'll see now in the last slide when we talk about enforcing the moment we start taking mountains there's a song that i wanted to sing for you that you know that have you got rivers that are uncrossable do you have them have you got mountains that that that that you cannot climb you've got a god who can tunnel who can tunnel them through god can take you through the rivers that are uncrossable he can do that but the moment we we go according to our mind and say oh no no no let us start to take our impossibilities because those things before god they are possible all things are possible the only thing that is not possible is that he cannot fail so we don't even have to talk about it because that one is not even a discussion with god all things are possible the only thing is that he cannot fail everything that he says will come to pass so my job is to just keep on doing it keep on believing it amen look at these guys and er not these guys sorry i don't like the way guys unless i'm talking to guys but if i hear my daughter saying guys i said ah you're saying to me and your mom guys you know the young people nowadays they say okay good night guys guys [Music] so but that's where we are brother isaac they say to us good night mom and dad instead of that it's a good night guys see you tomorrow guys so these are not the guys these are the clouds of witnesses something happened in the office when i was preparing there i'm preparing and finalizing then this slide is number nine if i'm not mistaken and when i come to talk about these people these brothers brothers and sisters here i didn't put sisters here or that but i didn't put them but then i found that that slide was number nine even in the previous semon was number nine when i talk about these people it came on the same slide i said how did this happen i want to talk about these people and they are there these people here noah they took the impossibilities because in the days of noah it was not possible what no wanted to do what noah was preaching was not possible but noah did not look at that noah looked at what god said not what his possible mind reasoning was saying that's what noah did he he was a fool in the language of that day he was a stupid how can you say you are building an act to put people in how how can you say that we must believe you that's gonna go up in the rapture what what are you talking about that's how they'll ask you today same with abraham i mean sister bronwyn she's a nurse isn't it you know that a woman when she passed a certain stage of life he cannot bear children anymore now how can you tell us that you are going to have a child when you are already this age and your wife let's just think about that that is impossible but abraham took that impossibility head on because why he did not look at what is possible according to the worldly language what is possible and what's not possible he just looked at what god said and if we come like that today i do not talk about only abraham i want to say today if you've got a situation or you're in your life or something that is a problem what's wrong in coming in the same attitude yeah what's wrong what's wrong in just standing and just just becoming a fool for christ and say me i'm gonna stand here i'm not moving i'm going to stand here and that's what god said in his word and i'm going to believe it and confess it let me be like abraham and see if my eyes cannot come i'm going i'm not going to move even if i die i'm going to stand here because god said he will save my family and i'm gonna stand here why can't we enforce that because we we are too quick to speak about abraham we are too weak to say moses took his wife and children and went to egypt it's easy for me to say that but we want the moses today to say ah my father is sick my father is healed i'm standing there i'm refusing that my father can be healed that must be our attitude isn't it joshua you can think about them sangha do you is it is it reasonable that one man can can beat a whole legion of philistines one man and they killed 600 is it sometimes the thing that the bible says that's why it's unbelievable it's unbelievable now the opposite of unbelievable is believable now we are on that side of believer bull we believe it we believe in unbelievables so that's what we need to do we must take it as it happened i mean let's not go too far in the days of brother branham when he was here on earth he prayed for the people right and they got healed and he made a statement and said it is not me it is your faith so today we need to we're not going very far we're not going back to abraham we are just going to here in 1962 1662 in the message uh restoration of the bride tree he was praying to the people telling them that you are mrs robertson you are missing sorry so you come from alabama huh why can't why can't that happen among us today are we the bride we are the bride that's one number one and the point number two we that must be our daily purpose lord bring us to the days of brother branham bring us to the days of abraham enough we shouldn't be struggling about ah ah is that sister is that one who spoke no no those things of who's speaking about who about what are not even supposed to be ahead among us the fast and skews and problems of here are delaying us we are supposed we have been called with an expensive calling a high calling that's our calling and at the moment we realize oh i have been underprivileging myself i'm supposed not to be there to say yes tell me brother i knew he hates me tell me what did what did she say about me sister no noelle i've always seen her that she doesn't no no come on adults come on now those things are not even supposed to be ahead among us in this today today earning initiation and sleeping we are not even supposed to be preaching about those things right now we are supposed to be hey standing up saying hey we want more we want the pastor to go and dig brother and all the ministers to go and dig deeper to bring to us the food that's why our focus and our purpose every day is supposed to be that is how enoch did it yes that's why eventually he just walked with god no no no no we're not supposed to be fast we look at that check check your pastor if you want to see the position of the church check him i look at him maybe he's not aware but i check him i look at him carefully how he works when he walks like this then i also walk like this you see that's what you must do that's what you must do when when when when he's crying before the lord cry before the lord because because he is our sharepoint we are not uplifting him as a man the spirit that god to put in the church and on him so that's how we need to do this thing of saying we are too independent we are too much on laodicea we are we are taught that we are now in bright age bright age is no more about interested about what did brother phil say about you sisters and brothers brothers no no no let's not understand ourselves let us not sell ourselves too cheap the bible says we have been called with i'm talking about situations where even if you're not talking to someone but you're thinking about it in your mind you say yeah you're entertaining that thought about that sister negatively why why why must i be saying no yes no i'm supposed to rebuke satan the moment he comes to my thought about mr melissa i'm supposed to go and say my sister forgive me last night the devil gave me a wrong thought about you but i stood up and i prayed for you yes that's how it must be to expose the devil that's how it must be we are not supposed to be shallow we said last time in conclusion our impossibilities must mirror of those ones our impossibilities must mirror the ones of brother branham we must come to that point we we must come to the point where even us because otherwise we are waiting for god to force us because one thing for sure is that we are god's children you are the bride and i do you want god to come and force you huh the king david said lord lord no no i cannot wait for that let me save you all my heart with everything that i have i'm better with you lord i'm better saving you amen what what happened to them their task was to face them by faith those impossibilities because it was up to god to fulfill them it's not up to me whether and how my dad is going to be healed or how whatever problem whatever situation whatever the problem is that many times we want to solve our own problems we take god's job when he said to me believe me and if that's the problem then we must pray against it and cast it away so that we can have freedom to pray without any obstacles so that we can believe god without no questions that's why we need to come it's up to god what can we do we can't even heal ourselves not even a tooth pain yeah we cannot even what i don't want to demean you i don't want to make you small i i i'm trying to help you to show that you are small only him he's big and he can do everything for us ours is to surrender and just follow and believe his word fully yeah let's allow the pilot to pilot i've never heard of anyone who goes in the airplane and start to ask the pilot how is it is he going to do it the prophet says he dramatizes well now when i go when i go overseas and i go and and i go here as big sheep sitting there a big airship seven times around and i flew this thing around i don't say say i don't go say hey hey pilot and before i go onto the ship you will tell me how much scope them how much you scope them each one of those props have give a has give me all the mechanics of how this plane will operate do you do that and tell me how high can you climb all the mechanics i don't ask all those things i know the ship went across the someone else if the ship went across with someone else it will it will go across me with me so i'll just climb aboard and get on my seat and sit down and it's up to the pilot to see that it gets there right even the doctor we just go there he says open your mouth you open close you close ah say that assistant another she'll tell you they tell them open white you open it wide close close huh wait and he take that little stick and he checked on the side you don't you don't say wha why why are you doing that no no you just open why because you believe in him huh he says raise up your head he said oh no sorry i forgot i mean your feet you raised because you believe in him that he's going to help you so god said read your way pray every day and believe in me so what is the problem why can't we do that right you don't go and say now when i go and drive my family home no one is going to ask me okay hold on hold on hold on how is this team going to function are you going to how i want to read it no they just put their seat belts and i drive them yeah and we get home and they say thank you and i said thank okay thanks to you for the company that's all there's no arguments with my wife of how what speed are you going to do and how i want to turn there on that corner i want you to do speed and then i want to understand this thing no no no no i i just drive isn't it isaac that's what happened you know you don't ask isaac those you just let him drive you through akatarawa through the akkas and you get home safely you say thanks isaac then you give him dinner finish there's no arguments of saying i was like how am i gonna turn on that one no no no no isaac i want to know because you've got confidence and faith in what he's doing and that's how we should be on christ that is how how solid and faithful we are supposed to be on anything that we want the same applies to when you go to the doctor that's what i was trying to tell you now when you he give you a pill you don't analyze and ask him the chemical analysis of the tablet that is giving you or the pills you believe that don't you don't you brethren just accept it on the basis that god said so and let god be god again brother ben we does not have to accept it we must not be preoccupied about our ideas and wanting to help god no we cannot succeed like that we just have to accept it that god said so and that's how we will overcome that's how we'll get our overcoming power and that's the same thing about taking this gospel i like that you know when i saw that i said i must put that in red so that everyone can see a gospel tablet we must swallow it and drink it bitter or not bitter the better the better i can tell you all about that about it but i know it works it works right now lastly the power to enforce amen there come a time in the life of every believer where you must enforce the word of god now here i say the seal of god is the weight right of god now that seal of god you know i still still is something in the olden days you know like a stamp if you see that brother ben signed here and put you know that you can do it brother isaac that oh the pastor said we the testis can go and buy this this is his still yes we are not going to ask the church first and say brothers what do you think no the pastor put his seal huh there we go when i was working for brother andy i remember marion said no brother we just buy brother andy gave you still you just take the receipt to their sisters they will refund you and that happened and i was amazed it happened i've got the fun day isn't it mario so when they say seal the word of god is the seal of god it gives you got all the approvals you need in here all the promises the promises and all everything that you need has been given to you with the seal of god approved promise healing everything happiness what what you can name it right the solution is here so now now now the word was broken and sealed it has been fulfilled as it was spoken it is impossible for god's word to go out and and not be fulfilled it's impossible it is not possible for god's word to be spoken and not be fulfilled that is not even something we must worry about if he said it it will happen right now that seal of god is called uh two things judgment and promise but both of them have to be enforced as the word is being preached to an unbeliever it is judgment is being enforced but to a believer is a promise fulfilled you receive that which you ask for two things right so now those things are being enforced by the presence by the spirit of god right he says here the prophet enforced then we are there we have the privilege to enforce to satan to tell him that satan will rebuke you in the name of our lord jesus christ get out by the authority given to me in the word of god we will compel you to get out it's not us that's what god said to enforce have you ever had the police officer saying uh i'm thinking that you're uh you must come over here i was just asking if you can put your hands like this so that i can arrest you because i you're going through the speed limit and the red robots traffic lights and i was just saying if it's okay with you can you just bring your head no no the traffic officer don't do that he's going to enforce the law if you don't he's gonna pull you with your belt huh that's how we must do to the devil and handcuff him and tell him you go in that cell okay he says yes you say yes okay we shouldn't be next in the devil and and not enforcing the word of god because we are making god a failure if we don't do that we are supposed to fearlessly do it be deaf we must be happy when he says i'll kill you say yes go on if you kill me you're actually been helping me you see the devil is the biggest loser if he kills you he's a loser if he leaves you he's a loser so what is it for me and you to fear why are we letting the world to toast us around as if we are not the bride of god we are called by such a name do you know a bright a bright stability can you remember the day you were wearing that dress every eye was on you my sister every eye of course because the christ his eyes cannot be looking at no no he's looking at his bride the focus of the lord now is on us it's not what he said about satan and the word he doesn't focus much on that his focus that's why we are called the apple of his eye or you say april here the april of his eye is you his main focus is you that's what the brother phil says right you are busy putting on your waiting garment white pure white have you ever seen anything whiter than the snow snow is the whitest thing that we know here on earth but our wedding gown the weight everywhere the weight ah that's what we are putting on now and if you are even finished right that's where the focus of the bridegroom is everything else we leave it in his hands we leave it in his hands in prayer i'm finishing now my time is done oops sorry my time is finished but uh just gone over one hour now so therefore oh sorry i want to read this portion for you it's a very nice piece that's like a dessert god has a law and his word is a law and a god is the god in this word made certain claims to check to the church therefore we have a right to force these flames upon satan a light and say give it back yes i've never i'd say i don't know you know give it back that's for the children when they play no give it back it's my no it's my noise no no you're not arguing like that give it back and he's gonna feel it when you punch him he's gonna feel that hey that was a punch man give it back you're not playing with him you're punching it with that statement give it back if he doesn't listen to you say in jesus name he just ran and he has to do it because we can take god's agent the holy spirit go right down on our knees and say it is that said the lord he's got to give it up that's all cause the holy spirit is there to make him to do it amen so there's no laws with us we are playing a game where we don't lose whether we've got the injuries whether some of our players are out whether the enemies call them massive numbers we don't know our part is not going to lose we are playing a winning game that's where we are and we leave we we move from that point of departure brother ben we are winning okay now come let's play we won come let's play but remember i won just don't forget that i won you want to play come on you're for anyone yes i'm for anyone and i'm going to beat you that's our rules of this game because our our husband has already won it the devil even got perplexed he said ah let me make some chick they stole him from the grave no they didn't steal him he knew that he rose it's the biggest propaganda machine the devil a biggest liar the law of the land is to enforce the policeman enforce the law when you see brother kubin says sit there don't sit there obey does his job as the policeman of the church don't take your personally no no no no no okay let me leave it there but the law of the spirit of god is to force satan to give up that which he unrightfully deceitfully taken from god souls of man he took from god souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people now where god made them in his image to be like him and the church is given rightful legal rights by the bible to take the holy spirit and force it upon him that is in this seminar you can go read this one it does not preach long time ago this is in the same one where he said to me you are mrs robertson in that same one this morning i was busy dressing up i'm putting i was listening to the message last night no the message is busy playing i just see this i never put it it just come on the screen restoration of the bread who put it the angel of the lord is always with you my daughter my boy the angel of the lord is with you one day you are going to hear people at school telling you hey who's that one that you awake that we're working with to say which one so no we saw yesterday walking to school with a man a tall man said no no i never they saw the angel of the lord one day we are going to know that we are the bride and the sooner we are purposeful to see that they will ask you nami who are you driving with we saw you you know i was alone sister naomi we yesterday when you came to work through the gate we saw there was someone in the front with just tell them you saw the angel of the lord you see because they asked the prophet the same thing right so i am done i just wanted to remind us that uh the power to enforce that that's what we need we've got to do some fighting to get right fully what is yours what is mine right but with the power of god with your testimony that's how you overcome by the blood of the lamb and and your testimony tell the devil he's got no strings tied to you even if he can show you another string tell him you've got no strings on me [Music] there's no strings now you've got to put this disease on me but jesus christ delivered me from it you promised it to me he promised it to me that's from the greatest warrior joshua that's the man who did the impossibles also just by going around the world and the whole the walls fail just imagine me walking on the street of willington all over the show the arrow everywhere and
