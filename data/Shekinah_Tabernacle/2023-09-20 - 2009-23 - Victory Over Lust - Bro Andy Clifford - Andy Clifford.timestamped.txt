[14:38] shorter counts with God don't save it
[14:40] for special occasions tonight is a
[14:43] special occasion
[14:44] not because of any of us but because he
[14:46] is here and wherever two or three gather
[14:49] he's in our midst amen hallelujah I want
[14:52] to speak tonight on a subject called
[14:54] victory over lust with a sub title of
[14:58] the healing of our breach amen I'll
[15:01] explain that soon
[15:02] amen Lord willing so if you can turn in
[15:04] your Bibles to Isaiah chapter
[15:07] 30.
[15:14] verse 26
[15:16] and we will hit this context about
[15:19] halfway through exactly what we're going
[15:21] to be talking about in with the repair
[15:23] of the bridge who believes Jesus Christ
[15:26] is the repairer of the breach
[15:28] amen hallelujah
[15:31] amen
[15:32] says here in verse 26 moreover the light
[15:34] of the moon shall be as the light of the
[15:36] sun and the light of the sun shall be
[15:39] Sevenfold as the light of seven days
[15:43] hallelujah in the day so in that in the
[15:46] day that the Lord binds up the breach of
[15:48] his people and heals The Stroke of their
[15:50] wound you may be seated
[15:52] Hallelujah
[15:54] amen and we all know we've heard lots of
[15:56] preaching on this scripture that this is
[15:59] the day we're living in amen that at the
[16:02] end time God would gather the light of
[16:04] every age and the message of all the
[16:06] prophets and everything and Consolidated
[16:08] it into one message and reveal the Seven
[16:11] Seals that was sealing the book for all
[16:14] this time and he would reveal everything
[16:16] and give the title deed back to humanity
[16:19] who believes that so therefore light of
[16:23] every age has been Consolidated shining
[16:25] on the moon hello moon
[16:28] the Moon is now reflecting the sunlight
[16:30] so it's in that day that he would bind
[16:32] up the bridge of his people it hasn't
[16:35] happened through the church ages the
[16:36] breach has always been there and I tell
[16:38] you what I'll go into it very soon
[16:40] there's a bridge there's a Chasm there's
[16:42] a there's a divider there's a thing in
[16:43] in lives that keep us natural to affect
[16:46] us by the Flesh and affect us by lust
[16:49] and affect us by fear and and all these
[16:51] different tormenting devils and things
[16:53] through the heritages and through the
[16:55] generations that have plagued us but
[16:58] there has to come a day where those
[16:59] things are canceled there has to come a
[17:02] time when those things are eradicated so
[17:04] that you don't have to put up with them
[17:05] anymore and so that you can walk with
[17:07] God like Enoch and one day you will walk
[17:10] home Hallelujah I'm really excited about
[17:13] this Hallelujah because I believe that
[17:16] we're in an age and I just if this is
[17:18] the burden that that you'll just have a
[17:20] greater understanding and experience of
[17:23] what Jesus is wanting to do in this hour
[17:25] it's not just we go to church and we
[17:27] just learn all the stuff and and it's
[17:30] better than any age because he's
[17:31] revealing moral there it's more than
[17:33] that there's a transformation taking
[17:35] place there's a metamorphosis taking
[17:37] place and it's happening in your p in US
[17:41] amen hallelujah
[17:43] and uh I'm just gonna I'm not gonna get
[17:45] too far ahead because I just want to
[17:48] be very controlled here Genesis 3 1 to 4
[17:51] well actually just actually Genesis 3 1.
[17:54] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[17:56] beast of the field which the Lord God
[17:58] had made and he said unto the woman yay
[18:02] has God said You shall not eat of every
[18:05] tree of the garden
[18:07] so you can see now from the Garden of
[18:09] Eden lust was introduced and I'm not
[18:11] going to go into the details for now
[18:13] now there's a scripture in Psalm 119
[18:16] verse 133 and it says here Order My
[18:20] Steps in thy word and let not any
[18:23] everyone say any
[18:25] let not any iniquity have dominion over
[18:27] me amen and I'm sure that we've had we
[18:31] always go through this you see this guy
[18:33] here that's us and there's a there's a
[18:36] devil that's trying to give you bad
[18:37] influences trying to tell you to do
[18:39] things and there's there's your good old
[18:41] your new nature right there's a white
[18:43] dog and a black dog inside every one of
[18:45] us and is trying to get Dominion but the
[18:48] word and the Lord has bringing us to a
[18:51] place where we can have dominion over
[18:53] the enemy and have dominion over our old
[18:56] nature amen
[18:57] Hallelujah so Romans 6 12 says let not
[19:01] sin therefore rain
[19:02] in your mortal body
[19:04] that's now
[19:06] that you should obey it in the lusts
[19:09] thereof so there's this lust that is
[19:11] inside the human being that is coming
[19:14] through all sorts of generational issues
[19:16] and curses and troubles and influences
[19:18] and everything that's going on in this
[19:20] world and in the world that was in your
[19:22] forefathers right okay so it's there and
[19:25] pride in the family and all these other
[19:26] things but we're just going to use lust
[19:28] is going to be the subject matter today
[19:30] because I can tell you now there is lots
[19:33] of lust hiding in the church hiding in
[19:36] people hiding you can sit there and be
[19:39] an angel thing yeah it doesn't affect me
[19:40] but I can guarantee you that the devil
[19:43] will tempt you on lust and it will
[19:45] affect you and something and I'm not
[19:47] just talking about lust when a man sees
[19:50] a female and you know and has a lust no
[19:52] I'm talking about covetousness I'm
[19:54] talking about wanting things and just
[19:56] constantly Desiring things I'm talking
[19:58] about being discontented and always
[20:00] looking for something else the only
[20:03] something else that you need to look
[20:04] forward to is something more from Jesus
[20:06] amen Hallelujah so I'm just asking you
[20:10] tonight to draw a line in the sand
[20:13] tonight
[20:14] put a Line in the Sand between you and
[20:17] lust
[20:18] you and pride you and fear
[20:22] okay just put a Line in the Sand because
[20:24] tonight
[20:25] as well
[20:29] I'll tell you what and I know that we've
[20:31] all got testimonies and the Lord's dealt
[20:32] with us in many ways see in my own
[20:34] experience I was definitely um raised in
[20:39] a way that I was exposed to all sorts of
[20:43] different things very lustful things as
[20:46] a child and you know just sore stuff and
[20:49] material and all that sort of stuff that
[20:50] I shouldn't have seen and no humans
[20:52] should see and as a result in My Flesh
[20:56] and by my natural birth because my
[20:58] father also struggled with these things
[21:00] and as most men do right because it's
[21:02] the world we live in and so they
[21:04] struggle with with lust and so then I
[21:07] was raised under this umbrella and also
[21:09] was exposed to a neighborhood of all
[21:11] these types of things and so as a result
[21:13] it became a very hard issue in my life
[21:18] okay now I'm gonna get into some things
[21:20] to alleviate these things and to
[21:23] eradicate the lust and and this body so
[21:26] that you can walk in Victory but if you
[21:29] don't and you begin to walk in the flesh
[21:31] you're gonna have struggles
[21:34] you are going to have struggles with
[21:36] lust you're going to have struggles with
[21:37] the old nature and all those things when
[21:39] you walk in the flesh because to Walk In
[21:42] the Flesh and to be carnally minded is
[21:44] enmity against God you're basically
[21:46] saying God you go over there and I'm
[21:48] gonna do this
[21:49] that's what's happening you're pushing
[21:51] God out there oh where are you you're in
[21:53] no man's land and then the devil's just
[21:55] going to come in and he's going to tease
[21:56] you and he's going to torment you and
[21:58] he's going to tempt you and try and
[21:59] bring you and pull you away from God
[22:03] and the natural and the carnal nature so
[22:06] anyway in my own life you know that
[22:08] happens to me you know and it happened
[22:10] it gets better and better as we get
[22:12] older and get more mature in the Lord
[22:14] you know the Lord gives us tools and he
[22:17] gives us Revelation and we get built up
[22:19] in the Most Holy Faith you know it says
[22:22] that we should add virtue to our
[22:24] character and all those things and it
[22:25] says to make your calling an election
[22:27] sure and if you do these things
[22:29] diligently that you shall never fall and
[22:32] the word says that right so if the word
[22:34] says it I believe it that settles it and
[22:37] then it's come with an open book in our
[22:38] generation to give it all back
[22:40] so that there's nothing withheld from
[22:42] you there's nothing withheld from me
[22:44] right
[22:45] nothing is withheld
[22:47] God withholders no good thing from his
[22:50] children from those that believe right
[22:52] amen we can establish that easily so in
[22:56] my own life
[22:59] we when I first got together with Isaac
[23:01] and started the business you know and we
[23:03] were just busy busy
[23:05] and us being very entrepreneurial and
[23:09] energetic we started to really
[23:12] Branch out too much too busy got carnal
[23:16] started struggling with lust again but
[23:19] held it all didn't say anything and then
[23:22] all of a sudden you know I didn't go
[23:24] into anything but I just struggled with
[23:26] it right and it was becoming harder and
[23:27] harder and harder and I was being
[23:28] affected by it it was it was bubbling in
[23:30] my body
[23:32] because if I never felt that bubbling
[23:35] a man sees a undressed female or
[23:37] something like that on the streets and
[23:40] something starts bubbling what is that
[23:42] it's your old maker lustful nature and
[23:46] if you're carnal you will not be able to
[23:48] not look a second time you'll be looking
[23:49] and then you'll look again and you'll
[23:51] look again and you'll struggle
[23:53] why because the barriers are down and
[23:57] the Lord's far off somewhere else and
[23:58] you've been too busy and this is what
[24:00] was happening in my life and my family
[24:01] started falling apart
[24:03] now this was all kind of nuancedly
[24:06] falling apart and I wasn't gone but
[24:08] there was children were very naughty and
[24:10] you know children could be naughty even
[24:12] when you're in a good place so don't
[24:14] think that just if children are naughty
[24:16] you're in a bad place because they just
[24:18] killed him right but they were there was
[24:20] just a real disjointedness and a and a
[24:22] real kind of uh a breach I'm gonna call
[24:25] it a breach because that's what we're
[24:26] talking about so anyway so there's this
[24:28] breach in Bromance that's to have these
[24:30] kind of lustful dreams too and she was
[24:33] telling me about and I'm thinking man
[24:34] I'm struggling with lust she's having
[24:36] lustful dreams she never has those sort
[24:38] of dreams right but it's like something
[24:39] is happening in the subconscious and and
[24:41] I and and so now I'm out of my position
[24:44] and I'm struggling with these things and
[24:46] getting carnal and all this sort of
[24:47] stuff and I I came in and laid on my bed
[24:50] one night
[24:51] and I've probably told the spirit
[24:52] testimony some of you have heard it
[24:54] already so I laid out on my bed and I
[24:56] usually now at this stage of my life I
[24:58] was so Under Pressure I had to learn how
[25:00] to do cooking shows so instead of
[25:01] reading my Bible when I got down and
[25:03] laid on the bed which is what you should
[25:05] do you know at least fellowship with the
[25:07] Lord is what you know it's a very good
[25:09] thing so anyway instead of fellowship
[25:11] with the Lord I begin to fellowship with
[25:13] Jamie Oliver you know so I'm watching
[25:15] Jamie Oliver and I go to put this thing
[25:18] on and I'm about to watch and then Rock
[25:20] Roman rolls over in the middle of the
[25:21] night it's like three o'clock in the
[25:22] morning because I was working like 18
[25:24] hours a day and she rolls over and she
[25:26] says God has been gracious to you and I
[25:29] was like whoa mate that was real like
[25:31] boom anyway and then I felt like this
[25:34] being just came and sat down on my bed
[25:36] and I was like whoa so I was like okay
[25:40] I was like you know I felt like I was at
[25:42] this Crossroads now because now thoughts
[25:43] are starting to come and spiritual
[25:44] thinking starts to open up so I'm at
[25:46] this Crossroads now and I I I knew that
[25:49] I had to make a decision now
[25:51] and this decision I had to make was do I
[25:54] carry on like this and just withhold all
[25:56] the the heart because my husband and
[25:59] wife should communicate you guys should
[26:00] know what each other's going through you
[26:02] should not be ashamed to tell your wife
[26:04] everything
[26:05] hey or husbands wives you should not be
[26:08] ashamed to tell your husband everything
[26:09] it should be an open relationship
[26:11] totally
[26:13] open
[26:14] you can share the burden together with
[26:15] we're humans right we struggle with
[26:17] things we go through stuff we should
[26:18] share it I wasn't and I think it's
[26:20] probably pride and many of us probably
[26:22] don't right we just get too proud we
[26:24] don't want to see come across as weak or
[26:26] we just don't want to upset our I don't
[26:28] know what it may be but there's lots of
[26:29] reasons right human beings and our
[26:31] thoughts and mind can be very
[26:32] complicated but I'm like now oh Lord you
[26:36] know and I I just opened my Bible I
[26:38] thought I better read the Bible you know
[26:39] I've been a dust this thing off
[26:41] so I got the Bible out and it was this
[26:43] actually and but let's just say it was
[26:45] the paper Bible and I opened it and
[26:47] something said psalm 39.
[26:49] so I read Psalm 39 and it just spoke to
[26:52] my life it undid everything that I was
[26:55] going through and I thought man I'm done
[26:58] and then I thought I'm just going to
[26:59] read some Hebrew text here to see if it
[27:01] really is speaking those things because
[27:02] it was getting revealed to me you know
[27:04] there was someone sitting in the room
[27:06] Hallelujah who was sitting in the room
[27:08] it was him hallelujah hallelujah aren't
[27:11] you so glad that he would come to you
[27:13] and you're so glad that he won't leave
[27:15] you like that that he would come into
[27:17] your room he came into my room
[27:20] Hallelujah and he began to tell me
[27:22] things that I needed to know to break me
[27:24] out of a cycle of carnality
[27:27] and I believe that God can come to you
[27:28] tonight and break you out of a cycle of
[27:30] carnality or a cycle of lust or a cycle
[27:34] of fear or a cycle of of covetousness or
[27:38] a cycle of Pride you know there's lots
[27:40] of Cycles we can get ourselves into the
[27:42] only one we really want to get into is
[27:44] that great Eternal one that great
[27:46] Eternal one that never began and will
[27:49] never end if the cycle you're in began
[27:52] then you should get out of it right now
[27:54] Hallelujah
[27:56] Oh Glory
[27:58] so I'm like sitting on my bed and I read
[28:00] something and I know get into the Hebrew
[28:02] now to see if it really means what he's
[28:03] revealing to my heart and it was and it
[28:05] got worse and it got worse and then the
[28:07] flesh was burning because now I have to
[28:09] tell Brahman everything
[28:10] oh boy now mate now we've had to tell
[28:14] hard things to our wives or we've had to
[28:16] ask hard questions to people right and
[28:18] so this maybe is not the hugest thing
[28:21] but still it was hard because now as a
[28:24] man you've got to fess up you've got to
[28:26] be real
[28:27] you gotta say it and so I faced up or I
[28:30] went out there and or the next day and
[28:31] want to wake her up at three o'clock in
[28:33] the morning and just pour it all out you
[28:35] know so next day at night I wait till we
[28:38] had to finish the day and then I came
[28:41] and I thought and I just prayed and I
[28:43] said Lord help me and I just said to
[28:45] everything and me and bromham we prayed
[28:46] and went through and she was like Wow
[28:48] and that so but from that day everything
[28:51] changed
[28:52] and I was restored back to that Eternal
[28:54] cycle and and and and our children came
[28:57] back into Harmony and Brahman stop
[28:59] having those dreams and you know the
[29:00] Lord could bless the home
[29:02] amen
[29:04] I'm running out of power up here will I
[29:06] have a pointer or something
[29:08] or is there another pad or amen so
[29:13] I'll move on from the testimony
[29:15] Hallelujah now I want you to make this
[29:17] personal this is Paul speaking this over
[29:20] a church but you can also individualize
[29:22] this
[29:23] and I want you to individualize this
[29:26] because lust is like yeast
[29:28] it's like 11. yeah
[29:30] and it can affect you you know if it's a
[29:33] warm day and you live in the bread man
[29:35] that thing can grow big
[29:37] the right atmosphere
[29:39] and so you can get a lust Spirit or you
[29:42] can get an effect by something lust or
[29:43] you can be watching
[29:45] um you know anything you could just be
[29:47] searching for I'm always searching for
[29:49] things for work and that but these
[29:51] thinking Google ads come up and they've
[29:53] got the as probably because I've got a
[29:55] wife and so the advertising woman's
[29:56] underwear and all sort of stuff and it's
[29:58] like ah stupid things and I just clicked
[30:00] at X you know but it's enough to get
[30:02] into your mind and it affects you and I
[30:04] can feel it like a just a just like a
[30:07] 11. and I'm like Lord help me
[30:11] cast that thing out of here you know
[30:12] it's but it's just a devil and he's just
[30:14] coming and what people would think is
[30:16] innocent they're not even trying to do
[30:18] anything wrong to you they're just
[30:19] trying to help you right help you AI
[30:21] ai's trying to help you to make
[30:23] convenient shopping for you all those
[30:25] things right so anyway let's read this
[30:28] I'm going to be I have to just go a bit
[30:30] faster I've got a few slides to get
[30:32] through tonight so it is reported
[30:33] commonly that there is fornication among
[30:36] you such fornication as is not so much
[30:38] as named among the Gentiles that one
[30:40] should have his father's wife
[30:42] so this was a serious offense that was
[30:44] going on in the church but remember that
[30:46] if you internalize this there can be
[30:49] serious offenses going on in your spirit
[30:51] there can be serious offenses going on
[30:54] in your house in this house that no one
[30:58] may know about it but God knows
[31:00] God knows
[31:02] and he says here to the church and you
[31:04] are puffed up what are you are you
[31:05] leavened you're this this thing is just
[31:07] blowing through so that spirit that was
[31:09] on those people to cause them to do that
[31:11] begin to affect the body and last
[31:14] Spirits would have been rampant around
[31:15] the church and this one would have
[31:17] started struggling with books this one
[31:18] would have started struggling with
[31:19] looking at that one and that sister and
[31:21] brother all those things right because
[31:23] it's starting to spread through but what
[31:24] about inside you
[31:27] come on
[31:29] because this is what we're talking about
[31:31] tonight
[31:32] that's a personal thing
[31:34] Hallelujah
[31:36] we got it on there have we brother
[31:39] beautiful I'm glad I got my glasses
[31:49] I'm going to skip down to verse six he
[31:51] says your glowing is not good
[31:52] no you're not that a little Levin
[31:56] Levin's the whole lump
[31:58] I learned this when I started making
[32:00] bread
[32:01] and I didn't realize what he was talking
[32:03] about until I started making bread you
[32:05] you think oh you know you can do um 20
[32:08] Gobles and use 10 grams of yeast you can
[32:12] use a hundred doubles and use 10 grams
[32:14] of yeast because the yeast goes into the
[32:16] flour and becomes yeast everything's
[32:18] yeast it changes the theory makeup of
[32:21] that bread that's what Levin does that's
[32:24] what lust does
[32:25] when you start looking at those things
[32:28] and then you get down and you get
[32:29] condemned and you're like oh
[32:31] man what do I do I might as well just go
[32:33] ahead and do more right no no don't
[32:35] don't do that
[32:37] you just come out of it straight away
[32:39] the moment you repent the moment you you
[32:42] come out of that thing the moment that
[32:44] you make it right with God and whoever's
[32:46] involved the leaven is killed by the
[32:49] fire of God there's three things that
[32:51] kills leaven
[32:52] needing the living giving it a good
[32:54] beating
[32:55] Hallelujah God knows how to do that amen
[32:59] amen so just be careful and so there's
[33:02] another thing salt did you know that
[33:04] salt kills leaven so we just need to be
[33:07] seasoned with salt always with Grace
[33:10] so where are you going you're salty if
[33:13] someone's struggling with living they
[33:14] just become unleavened because the
[33:16] presence of God starts to unleaven you
[33:18] you know
[33:19] so it's very important that you actually
[33:22] God begins to use you to unleaven people
[33:25] you know just the atmosphere and you you
[33:27] just go for dinner or you go for
[33:28] Fellowship you bring your family and
[33:29] then all of a sudden they feel like this
[33:31] nice presence what are you doing you're
[33:33] being salty what's happening the level
[33:36] is getting dispersed the other thing is
[33:38] fire you cook that bread it kills all
[33:40] the leaven amen you cook it so you need
[33:43] fire and that sometimes what exactly
[33:45] what we need amen is fire to kill the
[33:48] leaven that goes on in the spirit
[33:51] Hallelujah does this I'm gonna do this
[33:54] no that's not going to work does that
[33:55] work
[33:56] oh it's off
[34:00] I'll just use this
[34:03] Galatians 5 17 says for the flesh
[34:05] lusteth against the spirit and the
[34:07] spirit against the flesh
[34:09] and these are contrary the one to the
[34:12] other that you cannot do the things that
[34:14] you would
[34:15] there's a battle going on Saints there's
[34:17] a pivotal Warfare going on inside your
[34:19] life
[34:21] as we know I know I'm preaching to the
[34:22] choir but I just want I'm just building
[34:24] a platform Galatians 5 18 but if you
[34:28] I love this God always gives Solutions
[34:31] he always has a way for you to be in
[34:33] Victory there is no excuse that you were
[34:36] just born all this way because if I as
[34:39] Paul could boast on how religious he was
[34:41] I can boast on how evil I was but I'm
[34:43] not going to do that because I shouldn't
[34:45] boast in those things right just like
[34:46] Paul shouldn't boast in those things but
[34:50] if God can deliver me and make me pure
[34:53] and holy he can do it to anybody amen
[34:56] amen buddy
[34:58] Hallelujah but if you've been LED off
[35:01] the spirit Glory this is not a hard
[35:03] thing right all you need to do is just
[35:05] worship all you need to do children is
[35:08] worship God
[35:09] praise God you know just give him praise
[35:13] give him glory he might speak to you
[35:16] I tell my children all the time just
[35:18] Praise Him let's give them worship not
[35:20] just when we're having our family altars
[35:22] and but in your room
[35:23] yeah you just open up and praise God
[35:25] young and old
[35:27] don't just be religious now worship God
[35:29] because he might just come down in your
[35:31] room and start telling you things and
[35:33] start speaking to you and start leading
[35:36] you
[35:37] we must be lit of the spirit then you
[35:40] are not under that law that is
[35:41] condemning you because you live above
[35:44] that because the spirit of God gives you
[35:46] power to multiply the Deeds of the flesh
[35:49] mortify means to kill I'm just going
[35:51] through Paul's conundrum here and your
[35:53] conundrum my conundrum right for I
[35:55] Delight in the law of God after the
[35:57] inward man I love righteousness I love
[36:00] doing right but I see another law in my
[36:03] body
[36:04] this old nature warring against the law
[36:06] of my mind and my inward man that wants
[36:09] to do right and bringing me
[36:11] into captivity to the law of sin that
[36:13] says you shouldn't do that and you
[36:15] shouldn't do that and if you do this
[36:16] you're condemned
[36:17] this is on a natural level now right
[36:20] then you get in a bad place
[36:22] and this is a struggle that Paul is
[36:25] speaking about he says captivity to the
[36:27] law of sin which is in my body and then
[36:30] he just declares this a Wretched Man
[36:32] that I am
[36:35] Hallelujah
[36:37] and I want to ask you who
[36:40] who is it that can deliver you
[36:42] that's Jesus Hallelujah
[36:44] Hallelujah who came to my room that
[36:47] night
[36:47] who came down on and sat on my bed who
[36:50] was that that came to your room who was
[36:52] that that came and delivered you in that
[36:54] service who was that that came to you at
[36:56] camp and changed your life
[36:58] who was that that came and spoke to you
[37:00] and changed you and changed your family
[37:03] and brought light that was him he shall
[37:06] deliver me from the body of this death
[37:08] thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[37:11] amen no excuse
[37:14] Hallelujah when I was first saved
[37:18] and I'd run away from the law for about
[37:19] nine months
[37:21] and then the Lord
[37:22] call me back
[37:24] and I remember going into my room this I
[37:28] still get involved with stuff and still
[37:30] you know having the odd drink and
[37:32] smoking weed and all that sort of stuff
[37:34] so but I was reasoning you know like oh
[37:36] slowly do that because and then and I
[37:40] hadn't really
[37:41] and and I I just hadn't really fully
[37:43] surrendered but I was wanting to you
[37:45] know
[37:47] and so
[37:48] I I came into my room
[37:51] and I picked the Bible out
[37:53] of my bedside table and it was Dusty and
[37:55] I blew the dust off and I opened it
[37:58] straight up to Second Corinthians 5 17
[38:01] and it said and God spoke to me that day
[38:04] and said touch not the unclean things
[38:06] that I will receive you and he made that
[38:10] promise personal to me that if I let go
[38:12] of those things and surrender those
[38:14] things
[38:15] that he would receive me and the Very
[38:17] notion the very idea that God would
[38:20] speak to me and he would promise me such
[38:22] a great thing those things fell away I
[38:25] surrendered my life I gave everything
[38:27] over and I said Lord take the world out
[38:29] of my life take all of the desire for
[38:31] the world out of my life I surrender all
[38:33] I want to serve you with all my heart
[38:35] and the Holy Spirit came down and
[38:37] changed everything
[38:39] Hallelujah that's how God can work it
[38:42] that's how he can do it Hallelujah
[38:45] amen Romans 8 13 shows us how to beat
[38:49] the adversary within that old nature for
[38:51] if you live after the flesh you shall
[38:54] die but if ye through the spirit do
[38:58] amen I like that's a doing word everyone
[39:00] say Doom
[39:02] mortify the Deeds of the body you shall
[39:05] live amen this is being led of the
[39:07] spirit this is walking in the spirit
[39:09] with the Lord this is her surrendering
[39:11] your life to God and doing his will
[39:14] finding out God's plan for your life and
[39:17] beginning to be led by him and beginning
[39:18] to fellowship with him what is he doing
[39:21] he's beginning to multiply the Deeds of
[39:23] this body amen and I believe that the
[39:26] Lord is going to continue to mortify the
[39:28] Deeds of this body right up until we
[39:31] come to the very end in the Redemption
[39:33] of our body amen but I believe and
[39:36] tonight I believe that the Lord is going
[39:38] to show us a very great thing about what
[39:41] he's going to do Hallelujah and the
[39:44] season that we're in to purify us and to
[39:46] deal with our enemy once and for all
[39:48] Hallelujah
[39:51] this is a picture that I kind of made up
[39:53] but this is what he's actually doing in
[39:55] our heart because every human being is
[39:58] born in their natural birth with a
[40:01] Babylonian image you are born with a
[40:04] Babylonian nature you have come from a
[40:06] Babylonian Heritage because this is just
[40:09] the natural man the natural man has got
[40:11] to curse all over him it's all cursed
[40:13] through the generations and all the sin
[40:15] and the evil that goes on and so there's
[40:18] an image in the heart but what happens
[40:20] in the end time what Jesus Christ has
[40:23] spoken to do in this last day is to come
[40:27] and smite that image and he will Smite
[40:30] that image not only on the age don't
[40:33] worry about what's happening out there
[40:34] but what is he doing in you
[40:36] what is being smitten inside you what is
[40:40] changing in you what is he doing he's
[40:41] putting a rock inside you a revelation
[40:44] of who he is to break the influence so
[40:47] that that influence comes down to the
[40:49] ten toes
[40:50] tell those ten toes right there at the
[40:52] bottom of that image the foundation of
[40:54] the devil's to hold over your life the
[40:57] strongholds that hold you down and make
[40:58] you act the way you don't want to act
[41:00] like Paul said Paul was like oh this
[41:02] Richard man all these things that I do
[41:05] and I shouldn't do and I can't help it
[41:07] but it just happens
[41:11] that there is something that happens in
[41:13] the end time
[41:14] this is something that happens right at
[41:17] the end to break the church free but it
[41:20] happens in the heart of the Bride
[41:23] I'm going to put this thing down I keep
[41:25] pressing that button
[41:29] this is actually that image and it's
[41:30] inside your heart this is what happens
[41:32] within you
[41:36] can you see that
[41:40] lust defined as a sinful longing it's a
[41:43] Desiring that which is forbidden and
[41:45] this is actually how
[41:47] um the serpent got Eve was through
[41:49] concupiscence
[41:50] strong powerful desire for things you
[41:52] deeply crave or are addicted to an
[41:56] obsessive desire
[41:57] an erratic possessive desire
[42:01] a selfish inconsiderate desire for
[42:04] Central pleasure
[42:05] a desire about relational commitment or
[42:08] intention
[42:11] lust is an insatiable never quenching
[42:14] self-centered satanic destructive path
[42:17] into complete darkness and separation
[42:19] from God's presence
[42:21] what are you entertaining
[42:23] what are you allowing into your mind
[42:26] when you lust
[42:28] if you could only see that demon you
[42:30] would scream cry and run
[42:32] but God is so merciful he doesn't show
[42:34] you but when you entertain that and it
[42:36] feels good in the flesh
[42:38] it's a different story but when you
[42:40] realize the evil
[42:42] and it's the very thing that was used
[42:44] against the woman to bring the fall of
[42:46] Man
[42:48] and so this is a force that's been in
[42:50] the human race from the beginning of the
[42:52] Fall
[42:53] and it's been manifesting and leavening
[42:55] and leavening and leavening and
[42:56] leavening and here we are in the darkest
[42:58] age covered in our whole inheritance in
[43:01] everything that we're born under
[43:03] Naturally Speaking is plaguing you
[43:06] and plaguing me
[43:07] everything this is the epitome this is
[43:09] the crescendo of the devil
[43:11] and the crescendo of God
[43:17] I'm going to go through a few things
[43:18] just we'll get there trust me
[43:21] we'll get there trust home actually
[43:23] emotional unfulfillment is a very key
[43:26] thing because now I'm just going to
[43:27] cover off a few things of how in your
[43:30] natural interactions and relationships
[43:32] and Communications and all those things
[43:33] to help you but also to give you an
[43:36] awareness of how you can become weak and
[43:39] different things that God has given you
[43:41] naturally speaking spiritually as well
[43:43] of tools and also practice and practical
[43:48] things to have in your life and to do so
[43:51] every even you young children I want you
[43:53] to pay good attention to this especially
[43:55] the teenagers pay good attention to this
[43:58] Genesis 2 18 says and the Lord God said
[44:00] it is not good that the man should be
[44:02] alone amen do you believe that it is not
[44:05] good and I've got a few pictures here
[44:07] are we connecting on our family level
[44:10] are our children actually connecting
[44:13] with us is our family home connected are
[44:16] our children getting the connection they
[44:18] need are they getting the Friendship
[44:19] they need from us
[44:21] children are you getting that connection
[44:23] that you need from your parents
[44:27] I asked that question because this is a
[44:30] very common thing that happens and I'm
[44:31] not just and that can doesn't
[44:33] necessarily mean that they're having a
[44:35] big debate or an argument in the
[44:36] background but I'm just just in general
[44:38] we can be so busy we can have so much
[44:41] going on in our home and so many things
[44:43] and responsibilities what is our
[44:45] children doing are we giving them the
[44:47] grace of a connection
[44:49] are they growing up with friends from
[44:52] their parents are they growing up
[44:53] connected on the level of family which
[44:55] is given to them
[44:57] you children are given parents to
[44:59] connect with
[45:00] if you don't connect with your parents
[45:03] then you'll look for other things to
[45:05] connect to and that will bring lust into
[45:07] your life
[45:08] it will because you'll go out in the
[45:10] world for connection or somewhere else
[45:12] and you will end up lusting after a
[45:15] connection you'll end up pursuing a
[45:18] connection because let me take this and
[45:21] I want you to listen really carefully
[45:22] the moment you're not connected you
[45:24] begin to pursue
[45:26] you begin a pursuit of connection
[45:28] and it's a there is a natural pursuit in
[45:31] marriage where a man pursues a woman
[45:33] and that's a Godly thing
[45:36] but it can come out of place when you're
[45:38] not fulfilled
[45:41] like this are we connecting or is this
[45:44] your bedroom at night when you hop in
[45:46] bed as their two phones out on the
[45:49] screens and you're all smiling and happy
[45:50] with your friends but not even talking
[45:53] there's no connection or there's little
[45:55] connection
[45:56] but I'm talking about a friendship is
[45:59] there a friendship in your marriage is
[46:01] there a fulfillment in your relationship
[46:03] and I'm not just talking physical things
[46:05] I'm talking friendship and social and
[46:07] fellowship
[46:08] is there a connection because if you're
[46:11] not connected to your spouse then you're
[46:13] going to start pursuing and lust the
[46:15] devil will know that you're not
[46:16] connected and he will send lust Spirits
[46:18] he will send people with anointings on
[46:21] them to try and woo you that way because
[46:24] and if you're not fulfilled emotionally
[46:26] in your marriage or in your parenting or
[46:28] in your family in your home if there is
[46:31] a if there is if you're more connected
[46:33] out there to a false relationship to all
[46:37] these other people and things and you
[46:38] just want to get the likes or the the
[46:40] attention on Instagram with your great
[46:43] pictures or the attention on Tick Tock
[46:45] with your little cool videos or you
[46:47] watching all this other stuff but really
[46:49] God gave you a spouse
[46:52] and if you're connected to that spouse
[46:54] you will be fulfilled emotionally
[46:57] we must be connected
[46:59] check your relationship
[47:01] the good thing is children parents
[47:04] married couples single or old the good
[47:07] thing is if there is a problem be real
[47:10] if there's a problem go and talk about
[47:12] it
[47:13] if you're not feeling the real
[47:14] connection pray together
[47:17] sit down together
[47:20] there's Grace
[47:23] for those of you that don't have
[47:25] husbands or don't have wives and you and
[47:28] you can't God has a special Grace for
[47:30] you
[47:31] so don't feel left out because the Lord
[47:34] is not a robot he knows our situation he
[47:37] knows what we intend he knows what we
[47:38] mean he knows what we need this one
[47:41] here's a big one
[47:43] are you connecting to your church family
[47:47] we're in this Fellowship
[47:49] is that you
[47:51] sitting there in the corner on the left
[47:52] is that left
[47:54] is that you can't really connect feel
[47:57] like you're rejected feel left out you
[47:58] just but or can you naturally just get
[48:00] involved are you being fulfilled
[48:03] in the friendship you see many people
[48:07] have had to leave family
[48:09] leave father mother
[48:12] and and go to to serve the Lord and
[48:15] they've had to leave all that behind to
[48:17] become a Christian and God promised
[48:19] he'll give you mothers fathers brothers
[48:21] sisters so that you can have that
[48:23] relationship fulfilled
[48:25] so that as you're single and maybe
[48:28] you're not married and you're seeking or
[48:30] you you are looking for that Fellowship
[48:32] then you can actually still be connected
[48:34] to your church family your church family
[48:37] is here for friendship our church is
[48:39] here for Fellowship for camaraderie
[48:42] we're together we're in this together
[48:43] we're fighting together we're in the war
[48:45] together right hallelujah we're here for
[48:48] each other let us be honest let us be
[48:50] sincere and true let us utilize the
[48:52] family and friendship that we have amen
[48:56] Hallelujah don't you get caught on me
[48:58] Hallelujah
[49:00] and the Lord God said it's not good that
[49:02] man should be alone so just check your
[49:04] relationships check your friendships
[49:06] check your marriage just check that you
[49:09] are being connected check that your
[49:10] relationship and your need for
[49:12] connection is being fulfilled
[49:15] if you're in a family and and you're
[49:17] feeling estranged then it's just prayer
[49:19] that's needed it's just the devil the
[49:21] devil wants to put fear on you he wants
[49:22] to a stranger he wants to make you feel
[49:24] like that no one understands you
[49:26] they understand you it's just a little
[49:28] imagination and I remember being
[49:30] preaching on it ages ago about how an
[49:32] imagination can become a reality
[49:34] your reality it's a false reality but
[49:37] it's so real that you can experience the
[49:39] emotions and even believe the
[49:41] imagination as if it's true and it's not
[49:43] true so be careful what you imagine
[49:46] Hallelujah but if you are connected to
[49:49] the Lord if you're connected to your
[49:50] family if you're connected to your
[49:52] spouse and your children are connected
[49:54] to your parents and if they're not and
[49:56] you prayed and you make it right
[49:59] you're not alone
[50:01] amen we have needs
[50:04] and I'm I I just say these things as a
[50:07] foundation because when you don't
[50:09] connect and when you aren't connected
[50:11] that's when that Pursuit kicks in and
[50:13] you begin to seek and you begin to get
[50:15] Temptation and then you struggle and
[50:18] then you might watch the wrong thing or
[50:20] you might see the wrong thing and you
[50:22] might hear the wrong thing and all of a
[50:23] sudden the leaven begins to bubble
[50:25] inside you and you can walk you can find
[50:27] yourself in the world
[50:29] just like that or find yourself falling
[50:31] from Grace
[50:33] but God has made a profession for you to
[50:35] be connected
[50:38] husbands
[50:40] when you get married
[50:42] Don't Stop The Pursuit to your wife
[50:44] you pursued her
[50:46] you loved her you were on cloud nine
[50:49] don't stop pursuing
[50:51] don't stop being that one that wants to
[50:53] please her and keep seeking and to keep
[50:56] doing nice things to just make you feel
[50:58] happy it doesn't stop when you get
[51:01] married and have children you should
[51:02] always pursue there should always be a
[51:04] harder pursuit in your wife
[51:06] for your wife to please her to woo her
[51:09] to win her to keep her one to please her
[51:14] because if you don't you will that
[51:16] something inside you will begin to look
[51:18] it'll begin to pursue again and you'll
[51:20] struggle with lust you'll struggle with
[51:22] looking around and when you see someone
[51:24] that looks nice or to the eye the lust
[51:28] of the eye will kick in and you'll
[51:29] struggle because there's a Pursuit
[51:31] inside you that needs to be
[51:33] quenched in your wife
[51:35] so when I when we before we got married
[51:37] the Lord spoke this and he gave Brahman
[51:40] nanaya scripture but it's not actually a
[51:43] scripture in the Bible but it's our own
[51:44] scripture Hallelujah I'm sure that any
[51:47] some of you have probably got your own
[51:48] little scriptures that the Lord has
[51:49] spoken to you right even our church
[51:51] we've got church Shekinah Tabernacle
[51:53] scriptures
[51:54] amen if you remain humble I will draw my
[51:56] people into my rest is that a Shekinah
[51:58] Tabernacle scripture I would take that
[52:00] as the word of God that's the word of
[52:02] God to us right so he spoke that over us
[52:05] and said if you keep me Central you will
[52:06] always be connected
[52:09] and I want to just tell you that when
[52:11] God is Central in your life your
[52:12] connections are prime you've got premium
[52:15] connections Hallelujah
[52:21] sorry this text is small but 1 John 2 15
[52:24] to 16 says love not the world neither
[52:26] the things that are in the world if any
[52:29] man love the world the love of the
[52:31] father is not in him for all that is in
[52:34] the world the lust of the Flesh and the
[52:36] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[52:38] is not of the father but of the world
[52:47] do you know it's very important
[52:49] true contentment because we are we wire
[52:53] ourselves and our mind gets wired into a
[52:55] certain format that if we're constantly
[52:58] thinking about what we can have and how
[53:00] nice it would be to have that car how
[53:02] nice it would be to have that house how
[53:04] nice it would be what you're doing is
[53:05] you're wiring your brain for
[53:07] discontentment and you are beginning to
[53:09] Crave things and long for things and you
[53:11] begin to actually not be able to enjoy
[53:14] what's going on in your life in the
[53:16] present moment so I wrote this when we
[53:18] are truly contented in our lives we can
[53:20] begin to enjoy the I am he's the present
[53:22] God but if you're always looking forward
[53:24] to what he's going to do then you're
[53:25] missing what he's doing right we can
[53:27] properly connect with our family and
[53:29] Brethren when we are enjoying them now
[53:31] and I know sometimes you children at the
[53:33] end at like 11 30 a.m 12 p.m on the
[53:37] Sunday morning you're hungry and you're
[53:39] looking forward to lunch amen I know and
[53:41] sometimes I get hungry too and but yet
[53:43] you have to just let that thing go down
[53:46] and say Lord I'm still here Lord I just
[53:48] want to hear from you because I can
[53:50] receive something from you tonight I can
[53:52] receive something from you Hallelujah so
[53:55] to contentment is meaning that you can
[53:57] rejoice in the present moment that you
[54:00] are not constantly pining after what you
[54:02] could have or or looking back and seeing
[54:05] the the things of the past because if
[54:07] you constantly look at the past you will
[54:09] be depressed if it's bad or you'll just
[54:11] be resenting things that are happening
[54:13] now because you think it was so much
[54:14] better back then don't do that stop
[54:17] looking out of the present and start
[54:20] enjoying the moment you're in
[54:22] stop looking forward to going to sleep
[54:23] tonight and get in the spirit right now
[54:26] Hallelujah
[54:28] this is serious stuff
[54:30] serious stuff that if we continue to
[54:33] look into the future and look into the
[54:34] path you'll be affected by those things
[54:36] but it might not be helpful to you but
[54:38] God is speaking to you and he's got
[54:40] something for you and he wants you to
[54:42] walk in the moment I know it's hard
[54:45] sometimes we always and there's nothing
[54:46] wrong now get me here there's nothing
[54:48] wrong with looking forward to something
[54:49] I'm looking forward to Camp I'm really
[54:52] looking forward to Camp I'm looking
[54:53] forward to things but I'm not going to
[54:55] live in the future
[54:56] Hallelujah when we go to heaven we're
[54:58] going to only ever be in the now
[55:00] amen so you must just get used to the
[55:02] now
[55:03] Hallelujah
[55:05] I'm speaking all these things from lots
[55:08] of experience now
[55:10] um because of the way I was wired
[55:12] and the Lord had to do a lot of
[55:14] Deliverance healing in me to a for me to
[55:17] be able to be content
[55:18] to be able to be happy
[55:27] now the Lord is wanting to filter our
[55:30] life and God has a filter that's his
[55:33] word it's a separator for it's the
[55:35] Waters of separation for sin now that's
[55:38] the thinking man or the holy man's taste
[55:43] when a thinking man comes through God's
[55:45] filter it gives him
[55:48] a holy man's taste I tell you the Lord
[55:52] is going to just show us some good
[55:54] things now that's right when you come
[55:57] through God's filter then your taste as
[55:59] a holy man's taste it makes
[56:01] a righteous man's taste this is the
[56:04] filter of God's word right so when you
[56:07] come through God's filter there's a
[56:09] power in that word to change your taste
[56:14] it's going to get better
[56:15] you're you young woman you old woman
[56:18] before you go out on the street with
[56:20] your clothes so tight pushed out in the
[56:23] back and front
[56:24] I'm not critical I'm your brother I
[56:26] stand between the living and the dead
[56:29] and realize what I'm saying before you
[56:31] interrupt and know that your body is a
[56:35] sacred order
[56:36] a sacred cast
[56:40] that God has given you before you into
[56:43] the street
[56:44] dressed like that pass your mind through
[56:48] a thinking woman's filter
[56:51] and let it remember that
[56:54] whosoever looks upon you to lust after
[56:58] you you have committed adultery with him
[57:01] already
[57:02] remember that sister and brother before
[57:06] you turn your head to look at her on the
[57:08] Second Glance
[57:11] oh God help us
[57:14] pass your mind through a thinking man's
[57:16] filter
[57:18] you'll come out I want you to say this
[57:20] oh come out
[57:22] with a holy man's taste
[57:25] amen of doing what's right
[57:28] this here when the Lord revealed this to
[57:31] me about seven years ago because I used
[57:33] to struggle
[57:34] when he revealed that to me it gave me
[57:36] hope
[57:37] that if if I can put myself through this
[57:39] thinking man's filter this I'll I'll
[57:41] there will be a change in me that my
[57:44] taste would change and I would stop
[57:46] struggling with these things I would put
[57:49] off the old man and put on Jesus Christ
[57:52] and they would be grace for me
[57:55] and in the times of struggle there would
[57:58] be grace for me to keep walking with God
[58:00] in the times of failure there was Grace
[58:03] for me to come through
[58:06] and I didn't have to live in
[58:07] condemnation and neither do I yet have
[58:10] to live in under a condemnation of
[58:13] failure but I see failure as an
[58:15] opportunity for war
[58:17] not an opportunity to just get down and
[58:19] depressed and then get back up and start
[58:21] again but failure is an opportunity for
[58:24] war
[58:25] it's an opportunity to overcome
[58:28] it's actually the grace of God exposing
[58:32] the devil in your life
[58:33] exposing a nature that he wants to heal
[58:36] you from
[58:37] exposing a breach in your Hull
[58:41] that will make you sink
[58:44] if it's not dealt with
[58:46] and you may be able to hide that from
[58:47] the people but you can't hide it from
[58:49] God and it will eventually bring you
[58:51] down
[58:52] and I preached on that with the Titanic
[58:55] I've actually got a slide from there and
[58:57] there later on so
[58:58] we'll get there
[59:01] respond oh this is an old one oh dear
[59:05] have you got the newest one Ed
[59:08] this is actually not the right slideshow
[59:11] I need the um newer one
[59:14] you must have downloaded it straight
[59:16] away eh
[59:18] positively correct
[59:22] see if you can download the next one
[59:23] I'll just preach on this for now but if
[59:25] you could change that over
[59:27] but you should be able to just download
[59:28] the nut from the same link
[59:30] see responsibility
[59:32] there is responsibility for our actions
[59:35] right
[59:36] we we make a choice now I divided this
[59:40] into three parts there's a demonic
[59:42] enticement within your old nature it's
[59:44] not you it's sin that dwelleth in you
[59:47] and it's something that you don't want
[59:49] right you're not responsible for that
[59:51] it's not you it's an old nature it's a
[59:54] it's a luciferian nature that is trying
[59:58] to pull you down that's against you
[59:59] that's against God that's why the Bible
[1:00:01] says it's enmity against God it's your
[1:00:03] old nature and from your old nature it
[1:00:07] begins to war against you and and what
[1:00:09] it does is it's it's magnetic towards
[1:00:12] sinful things
[1:00:13] you know so you can go down the street
[1:00:15] and you'll see something that's not
[1:00:17] right and you'll be and there's a
[1:00:18] magnetism and it's because of that old
[1:00:21] nature now there's the second one is a
[1:00:23] demonic atmosphere on the subject so
[1:00:26] there are a woman out there and men out
[1:00:28] there that have a legion of lust spirits
[1:00:31] on them Legions of lust on them and
[1:00:34] they're out there womanizing manizing
[1:00:36] whatever I think
[1:00:37] and when you see that you react and you
[1:00:40] think oh my goodness I'm so sinful right
[1:00:42] and you're not Discerning the spirit
[1:00:45] because that's a spirit on that person
[1:00:46] and then you feel condemned because you
[1:00:48] feel a certain way when you see that
[1:00:51] but it's actually a spirit
[1:00:53] that's not you don't be condemned by
[1:00:55] that the only thing that will condemn
[1:00:57] you is your reaction decision and
[1:01:00] entertainment of the Demonic influence
[1:01:03] that's what will condemn you that's what
[1:01:05] will separate you from God that's what
[1:01:07] will put lust in your life now it's not
[1:01:09] a sinful to get it's not actually a sin
[1:01:12] and you're not condemned for getting
[1:01:13] into a condition just by looking at
[1:01:15] something and being affected by it but
[1:01:17] what's sin is when you remain that way
[1:01:20] when there is a abundance of Grace to
[1:01:23] change you where there is Grace to set
[1:01:26] you free where you don't have to remain
[1:01:29] in sin you don't have to remain in a
[1:01:31] living condition where you're all puffed
[1:01:33] up you don't have to remain like that
[1:01:35] when you saw something you shouldn't
[1:01:36] have seen and maybe you were on
[1:01:38] something you shouldn't have been on or
[1:01:40] you're in a place where you shouldn't
[1:01:41] have been
[1:01:43] but then when you're affected by those
[1:01:45] things and you make it right with the
[1:01:46] Lord
[1:01:47] there's Grace to separate us from those
[1:01:50] things to change us so that we can come
[1:01:52] back and be in the Commonwealth of God
[1:01:54] where we can be connected to God where
[1:01:56] the Holy Spirit begins to lead us again
[1:01:59] now one thing I really felt when that
[1:02:01] slide came up was to make sure that we
[1:02:04] deal with this one thing and that is
[1:02:06] when you make a mistake don't stay in
[1:02:09] that mistake don't Pine in your own
[1:02:12] failure and you know the devil will tell
[1:02:15] you when you go into a failure or when
[1:02:17] you see something and you do something
[1:02:18] oh you might as well just do it all you
[1:02:20] might as well just let it all out you
[1:02:21] might as well just go for gold that's
[1:02:23] what he'll say right ah you just failed
[1:02:25] now you must have just have a party
[1:02:27] while you failed right and whatever
[1:02:29] medium and whatever it is but don't
[1:02:33] don't let the leaven fester in you don't
[1:02:37] let it Fester
[1:02:40] use that as an advantage
[1:02:43] for you to get serious with God
[1:02:46] in that moment where
[1:02:49] you you've failed and you might be on
[1:02:51] your knees you might be on the ground
[1:02:52] and there might be all sorts of troubles
[1:02:54] happening and you might be just that's
[1:02:56] the moment where you can stand up and
[1:02:58] put the Line in the Sand and your enemy
[1:03:01] that's you've struggled with is at the
[1:03:03] surface he's not hiding down deep in
[1:03:06] your heart now he's at the surface and
[1:03:08] he's ready to be dealt with he's asking
[1:03:10] for it
[1:03:11] do you know the devil asks for it he's
[1:03:14] so proud so arrogant and so hateful he
[1:03:17] can't help it
[1:03:18] he just opens himself up he shows us
[1:03:21] cards and every card he has cannot help
[1:03:24] hurt you at all it's a bluff a complete
[1:03:27] Bluff
[1:03:28] everything you go through
[1:03:31] Hallelujah
[1:03:42] I'm going back to the conventional is it
[1:03:44] all right back there brother Ed
[1:04:08] oh
[1:04:09] here we are
[1:04:10] thank you brother
[1:04:24] starting it's going to get positive I
[1:04:25] can be promising
[1:04:28] you can hear a pin drop in here
[1:04:32] it's like when people read my testimony
[1:04:34] and I meet them and they've only read
[1:04:35] half
[1:04:37] and I think man what do you think of me
[1:04:39] I'm mate oh boy
[1:04:43] Galatians 5 1.
[1:04:46] just remember this
[1:04:48] you will be targeted for a
[1:04:50] re-entanglement
[1:04:52] you know God sets us free man I remember
[1:04:54] when I first got saved I was safe so
[1:04:56] good oh nothing could affect me and I
[1:04:58] was on cloud nine me and the Lord we
[1:05:00] were just having a jubilee
[1:05:02] you know I thought man I'm never going
[1:05:03] to struggle with anything ever again ah
[1:05:06] my goodness oh
[1:05:08] I don't know if any of you felt like
[1:05:09] that I mean I was just so high all the
[1:05:11] time and I I've actually I've seen being
[1:05:13] a quote the other day that brother
[1:05:15] Brandon said I've been I've been drunk
[1:05:16] every day for 23 years I thought mate If
[1:05:20] he if I I just take it start drinking
[1:05:23] the Holy Ghost the wine of Revelation
[1:05:25] you could be drunk every day and be
[1:05:27] rejoicing anyway I thought I was like
[1:05:29] that you know and then all of a sudden
[1:05:31] you know start things just start to
[1:05:32] change and you start to get go through
[1:05:34] life and but you see the Lord allowed us
[1:05:37] to be in that condition there's nothing
[1:05:39] wrong with that but he's he knows what's
[1:05:41] inside you still he knows the joys the
[1:05:44] victories The Valleys the mountains he's
[1:05:46] got a whole plan
[1:05:47] and in that plan as victory over victory
[1:05:50] over Victory so as he said to Israel I'm
[1:05:52] going to leave some inhabitants in the
[1:05:54] land for you to conquer because you need
[1:05:55] to mature you need to grow you need to
[1:05:57] learn you need to go through some stuff
[1:05:59] meditable is just all easy and there was
[1:06:01] no failure oh my but listen here stand
[1:06:04] fast or in the Liberty wherewith Christ
[1:06:06] has made us free and be not entangled
[1:06:08] again with the yoga bondage
[1:06:10] Hallelujah this is the devil's
[1:06:12] zentangling strategy and there's
[1:06:13] probably more but dreams I'm just trying
[1:06:16] to just expose some stuff here the
[1:06:18] devil's sowing the seed until you know
[1:06:21] in your mind you might have a dream and
[1:06:22] it might be about someone that is in the
[1:06:24] church
[1:06:25] I'm just going to put it out there and
[1:06:27] it might be a bad dream or a dirty dream
[1:06:29] or whatever it may be what the devil is
[1:06:32] trying to do is one he saw that you
[1:06:34] didn't pray before you went to sleep and
[1:06:35] asked the law for protection so he
[1:06:37] managed to weasel his way through into
[1:06:38] your subconscious somehow somehow that
[1:06:40] slimy snake got into your house but
[1:06:42] however he did sometimes when you've got
[1:06:44] people staying he comes in that way
[1:06:46] whatever
[1:06:47] somehow he gets in sometimes and you
[1:06:49] have these dreams right and what he's
[1:06:51] doing is he's putting a seed in your
[1:06:53] subconscious and what is he trying to do
[1:06:55] he's trying to put some leaven in your
[1:06:57] spirit he might not be able to get you
[1:06:59] to do it in the flesh so he'll do it in
[1:07:01] your dreams if you're not covered like
[1:07:03] that in your sleep or whatever sometimes
[1:07:05] I I just I'm just speaking from
[1:07:06] experience until a full spiritual
[1:07:08] takeover has manifested in your spirit
[1:07:10] then in your flesh and you can wake up
[1:07:13] in the morning and you've dreamed about
[1:07:14] somebody and it's caused a lust in your
[1:07:17] flesh for that person and then when you
[1:07:18] get affected by that you need to repent
[1:07:20] of those things you need to make that
[1:07:22] thing right don't just think because you
[1:07:24] dreamed it that you're you're off
[1:07:26] scot-free no that still happened in your
[1:07:28] spirit Realm that's still something that
[1:07:31] needs to be dealt with and delivered and
[1:07:32] you need to deal with that enemy that
[1:07:34] did that to you and then you need to
[1:07:35] repent of that thing and I know that
[1:07:37] sounds crazy right some of you are
[1:07:39] probably thinking man Andy's just like
[1:07:40] way up there somewhere like over the top
[1:07:43] but anyway I'm telling you things so
[1:07:45] that you can actually not have a lust in
[1:07:47] your flesh and in your spirit realm so
[1:07:50] just because it's a dream it doesn't
[1:07:52] mean you can get away with doing lustful
[1:07:53] things I'm telling you now that if your
[1:07:56] dream becomes Lucid who knows what a
[1:07:57] lucid dream is a lucid dream is where
[1:08:00] you know you're dreaming and then you do
[1:08:01] something dirty in that dream now if you
[1:08:04] do that that means there's a dirty
[1:08:05] Spirit In You
[1:08:07] because you're still dirty your
[1:08:08] subconscious is still filthy
[1:08:10] and God wants to clean you he wants to
[1:08:13] sanctify you not just out here and what
[1:08:15] people see but he wants to heal that
[1:08:17] bridge that's under the water of your
[1:08:19] ship where no one can see
[1:08:22] he doesn't want you to fist
[1:08:24] he doesn't want to have a festering lust
[1:08:26] inside your life that just keeps you
[1:08:29] natural and you wonder why all you've
[1:08:31] done is warm a pew
[1:08:34] and he's living in a lustful state but
[1:08:36] God wants to take you and do things that
[1:08:38] you couldn't even dream of
[1:08:40] but first he's got to give you some
[1:08:42] tools give you some tips give you some
[1:08:45] Direction so that you can fight this
[1:08:47] enemy with an understanding that's why
[1:08:50] Gabriel had to come to Daniel to give
[1:08:52] him wisdom and understanding
[1:08:54] of the visions that he saw right
[1:08:57] Hallelujah God comes to you to give you
[1:09:00] wisdom to give you understanding that's
[1:09:02] why in the Proverbs it talks all about
[1:09:04] these things
[1:09:05] thoroughly who reads the proverbs it's
[1:09:08] very good for you it's not Old Testament
[1:09:10] it's Old Testament man that's good we
[1:09:14] always you know think our Old Testament
[1:09:15] now we just got then you'd know there's
[1:09:17] so much in there
[1:09:18] so much
[1:09:20] I think I've dealt with that enough you
[1:09:22] guys can contemplate and and meditate on
[1:09:25] those things visuals Google ads movies
[1:09:27] marketing psychology it's all designed
[1:09:29] to give you lust
[1:09:30] I'm telling you and I'm a marketer and I
[1:09:33] understand
[1:09:34] it's all designed to create a
[1:09:36] covetousness in you
[1:09:39] it's designed that way to trigger the
[1:09:41] lust
[1:09:43] even and now children's cartoons
[1:09:46] are does they trigger the lust channel
[1:09:48] in children so that they love the
[1:09:50] cartoon and want to watch more Disney
[1:09:53] common knowledge they even admit it and
[1:09:55] now they're even putting homosexual lust
[1:09:57] in there so that people will children
[1:10:00] will be more accepting in their schools
[1:10:01] of homosexuals and all sorts of
[1:10:03] identifications so it's all in there and
[1:10:06] it's triggering through lust so lust is
[1:10:09] actually bringing the battle of
[1:10:11] Armageddon
[1:10:13] lust is actually bringing the whole
[1:10:16] world to the battle of Armageddon
[1:10:18] through evil sensual unfulfilled desire
[1:10:21] that can never be quenched
[1:10:24] and it can never be satisfied it's
[1:10:26] insatiable it's like a fire and that
[1:10:29] fire the only way to stop it from
[1:10:31] spreading is to put it out with water
[1:10:35] and thoughts the fiery does atmosphere's
[1:10:37] imaginations and memories and you know
[1:10:40] these things here is the entanglement
[1:10:42] strategy of the enemy I'm sorry I don't
[1:10:45] have time to go right into every little
[1:10:46] detail but you guys study these things
[1:10:49] out and I would if I was I'd be praying
[1:10:50] Lord reveal these things to me yeah show
[1:10:53] me what these things are I want to have
[1:10:56] wisdom and understanding in this battle
[1:10:59] this I say then this is the pivotal
[1:11:01] battle for every believer
[1:11:04] Galatians 5 16 says this I say then walk
[1:11:07] in the spirit Hallelujah and you shall
[1:11:11] not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:11:15] this is the Holy Grail of my whole
[1:11:17] sermon right here
[1:11:19] is that am I is that wrong to say that I
[1:11:21] don't even know
[1:11:22] that there is the very and that's the
[1:11:24] pivotal point this is what actually
[1:11:26] inspired me for this whole thought was
[1:11:29] this because this showed me that there
[1:11:31] is a very simple solution to the problem
[1:11:34] of lust In the Flesh to to Paul's
[1:11:37] problem of Romans 7 and then his
[1:11:40] solution comes through Romans 8 and so
[1:11:42] the full manifestation of the sons of
[1:11:43] God
[1:11:44] and here it is he says walk in the
[1:11:47] spirit
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:51] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:11:54] the flesh so there's lust of the flesh
[1:11:57] right
[1:11:58] if you walk in the spirit you shall not
[1:12:01] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:12:03] that's all
[1:12:05] so what does that mean to walk in the
[1:12:07] spirit
[1:12:08] Glory help me Jesus help me father
[1:12:11] oh God
[1:12:17] To Tread all around
[1:12:19] to walk at Large
[1:12:21] you know what that means
[1:12:23] that means to be a future of
[1:12:25] let me just step out
[1:12:27] that means to take a daring step
[1:12:30] to walk with God and to be walking as a
[1:12:34] companion it means to be a companion to
[1:12:37] deport oneself what is that that means
[1:12:39] to go beyond the camp
[1:12:41] Deport yourself from your own lustful
[1:12:43] ways to point yourself separate yourself
[1:12:45] from Sinners separate yourself from sin
[1:12:49] hallelujah hallelujah Deport yourself
[1:12:51] from the way that you thought and the
[1:12:53] way your parents were so that you can
[1:12:55] walk in the way that Jesus is
[1:12:56] and follow as a companion to make one's
[1:12:59] way to progress to make due use of
[1:13:03] opportunities and tonight is an
[1:13:05] opportunity for you
[1:13:07] tonight is an opportunity for you
[1:13:10] to be changed
[1:13:11] tonight is an opportunity for you to
[1:13:13] deal with lust tonight is an opportunity
[1:13:16] and I believe the Lord is giving this
[1:13:17] opportunity
[1:13:19] not just by a bad preaching and whatever
[1:13:21] I do me you know it's just me but God I
[1:13:24] believe he inspired this thought he gave
[1:13:26] this thought and it's up to you what you
[1:13:28] do with it it's up to you if you leave
[1:13:30] the same
[1:13:31] it's up to you if you continue on
[1:13:33] struggling with lust struggling with
[1:13:35] pride struggling with fear struggling
[1:13:37] with the flesh
[1:13:39] but there's a way for you to deport
[1:13:41] yourself out of it so that you can walk
[1:13:43] in the spirit that you can tread all
[1:13:45] around in the spirit so that you can
[1:13:47] walk at large as a fugitive from sin in
[1:13:50] the spirit so that you can sing in the
[1:13:52] spirit so that you can make music in the
[1:13:54] spirit so that you can rejoice in the
[1:13:56] spirit so that you can be delivered in
[1:13:58] the spirit so that you can be a dead in
[1:14:00] the spirit you can be a mum in the
[1:14:02] spirit you can be a pastor in the spirit
[1:14:04] you can be a preacher in the spirit amen
[1:14:06] hallelujah hallelujah you can walk at
[1:14:09] lunch and that means to prove ability
[1:14:13] in the spirit not in your flesh your
[1:14:16] flesh ain't gonna prove nothing but if
[1:14:18] you can walk at large to God prove
[1:14:22] himself
[1:14:22] in you
[1:14:24] to make due use of the opportunity
[1:14:26] Hallelujah Jacob made use of the
[1:14:28] opportunity you know he got desperate
[1:14:30] one day and he needed change and Jacob
[1:14:32] was left alone and there Wrestled a man
[1:14:34] with him until the breaking of the day
[1:14:37] and sometimes that's what you need to do
[1:14:39] is that you need to get desperate you
[1:14:42] need to get a hold of something real
[1:14:43] amen don't just sit like a Wallflower
[1:14:46] but get something real in your life get
[1:14:48] some fire in your bones
[1:14:51] Hallelujah don't be afraid of the devil
[1:14:55] don't be afraid
[1:14:57] the devil can't hurt you
[1:14:59] you just give God all the glory and
[1:15:01] praise who cares what people say who
[1:15:03] cares what people think
[1:15:05] it doesn't matter what people think it
[1:15:07] doesn't matter what criticisms come walk
[1:15:09] unconscious of criticism
[1:15:11] walk in the spirit
[1:15:13] Hallelujah Jacob was so desperate he was
[1:15:16] coming up against the head his whole
[1:15:17] life was coming to her head he had to be
[1:15:19] changed and this is what happens in our
[1:15:21] life this is bringing us to a place
[1:15:24] where we must be changed and there is a
[1:15:27] bridge that he is healing and I'm going
[1:15:30] to be quick here
[1:15:31] I had to work hard to get this
[1:15:34] so that it was easy to express in the
[1:15:37] short time that we have
[1:15:39] the prophet says this for the people get
[1:15:41] the true revelation of the true church
[1:15:43] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:15:45] that she can do the Greater Works and
[1:15:48] she will be an invincible Army
[1:15:53] so here is the people that the breach
[1:15:54] has healed
[1:15:55] here's a people that the devil cannot
[1:15:57] affect anymore
[1:15:59] this is a prophet that stood in this
[1:16:01] generation with an open book and said
[1:16:04] that there will come a people that the
[1:16:06] devil cannot touch
[1:16:08] hey man and I've constantly in my life
[1:16:11] gone bring the church to this
[1:16:14] and about two weeks ago the Lord said
[1:16:15] don't you try and bring the church to
[1:16:17] this you come to this
[1:16:20] you need to ask for it personally
[1:16:23] and so I've been screaming crying out to
[1:16:25] the Lord you can ask Bob
[1:16:29] not the breach of my life heal the
[1:16:32] stroke of my wounds oh Lord I want to be
[1:16:35] an invincible Army in my own life
[1:16:38] because I was so busy trying to pray for
[1:16:41] the whole people but as an individual
[1:16:43] walk
[1:16:43] it's not something you can just blanket
[1:16:45] over the people but if you cry out to
[1:16:47] God for what he's prophesied and
[1:16:49] promised you I'm not speaking Pie in the
[1:16:51] Sky here I'm speaking direct promises
[1:16:54] for you for this end time
[1:16:57] to get a true revelation of the two
[1:16:59] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:17:01] church Christian church and by God's
[1:17:03] spirit discern and withstand the
[1:17:04] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:17:08] powerless powerless before her
[1:17:12] Satan will be powerless before me
[1:17:15] that no influence of my old nature no
[1:17:18] variable of the flesh no more lust no
[1:17:21] more fear no more rejection no more of
[1:17:24] these horrible old nature things would
[1:17:25] even affect me in any way because
[1:17:28] Invincible means totally
[1:17:31] free of effect
[1:17:33] and anyway
[1:17:35] an invincible Army through the power of
[1:17:37] the spirit and discernment but then here
[1:17:40] listen to this I said remember Satan's
[1:17:43] got a Punch coming at you this is the
[1:17:45] spot this breach that you've got to
[1:17:46] cover right now don't care who you are
[1:17:49] God he's got a right uh who you are he's
[1:17:53] got a right for that one punch which had
[1:17:56] you rather be that punch be blind or be
[1:17:59] arthritical sitting in a chair or be
[1:18:01] nervous see he's got somewhere he can
[1:18:03] punch you he's got a right to that open
[1:18:06] place now that's the spot you've got to
[1:18:08] keep covered all the time so there is
[1:18:11] breaches in the hull right that you're
[1:18:13] born with and things that are affecting
[1:18:15] you and something that you struggle with
[1:18:17] and the devil knows it and he begins to
[1:18:19] torment you with it right but I believe
[1:18:21] there's coming a time where you'll be
[1:18:22] invincible Hallelujah I believe that
[1:18:25] we're in the hour where you can begin to
[1:18:27] pray for these things where you can hold
[1:18:29] God at his word like Jacob did and don't
[1:18:32] let him go until He blesses you don't
[1:18:35] let him go until you receive that
[1:18:37] complete binding of the bridge in your
[1:18:39] life so that you won't sink when it
[1:18:42] comes to Temptation day
[1:18:44] Hallelujah the prophet says your weakest
[1:18:46] link in your chain is the strongest
[1:18:48] place
[1:18:52] he's talking about your flesh right
[1:18:54] that's why I put that picture there
[1:18:56] because it's us it's our flesh trying to
[1:18:58] hold it together
[1:18:59] that tells the chain no matter how
[1:19:02] strong other things are that week one
[1:19:04] point there's where you want to keep
[1:19:07] covered
[1:19:09] sometimes that's what your chain feels
[1:19:11] like right
[1:19:12] and you just
[1:19:15] oh boy too busy whatever cardinal state
[1:19:17] you got in and the slightest little
[1:19:19] thing and you've fizzled over and you've
[1:19:21] got mad and you've had a big rage
[1:19:24] oh boy but there was but there has been
[1:19:28] promised that that won't affect you
[1:19:29] anymore it's been promised that there
[1:19:31] won't be one cable tie on your chain
[1:19:33] anymore it's been promised that it won't
[1:19:35] be you holding that chain anymore and
[1:19:37] that little breach in your Hull that the
[1:19:39] devil just comes and tickles every now
[1:19:40] and again but there's been promise that
[1:19:42] you will be impervious it's been
[1:19:43] promised that you will be changed it's
[1:19:45] been promised that you will come into a
[1:19:47] condition where he cannot affect you
[1:19:49] anymore
[1:19:50] so that you can walk with God and and be
[1:19:52] not
[1:19:55] such a small unseen breach can lead to
[1:19:58] separation from God and you remember
[1:20:00] when we preached on this and how below
[1:20:02] the water line this great proud ship and
[1:20:05] all its engineering and yet there was a
[1:20:08] tiny little gouge that caused the sink
[1:20:10] in the death of 1500 people and it's
[1:20:12] these hidden un things unseen things
[1:20:15] like lust that you can hide from the
[1:20:18] people but you can't hide from God and
[1:20:19] you can't hide from yourself and you're
[1:20:21] certainly not hiding it from the devil
[1:20:22] and so what is he doing he what you
[1:20:25] might just start flying
[1:20:27] start taking off and having a good time
[1:20:28] with the Lord and you begin to see
[1:20:30] things and your identity gets revealed
[1:20:31] and then all of a sudden you're back on
[1:20:33] the ground again all of a sudden you're
[1:20:36] struggling again and you're up and down
[1:20:38] and roller coaster because of a gouge
[1:20:40] that God can heal right now while you're
[1:20:42] sitting
[1:20:46] spiritual healing
[1:20:50] this is that flesh Hull that Hull see
[1:20:53] that hole of that Titanic this is the
[1:20:54] reason it was so weak was the rivets
[1:20:57] were actually
[1:20:59] impure
[1:21:00] the whole makeup wasn't pure
[1:21:03] but you see
[1:21:04] I can't read that
[1:21:06] we must be covered with Revelation and
[1:21:09] led by the spirit of total Deliverance
[1:21:12] into total deliverance and stature in
[1:21:15] him
[1:21:16] Romans 7 15.
[1:21:19] now this is what I wanted to get to just
[1:21:22] to show you I want you to know
[1:21:25] that this is our day this is our hour
[1:21:27] this is what's promised you so that you
[1:21:29] can you know you can pray for things and
[1:21:31] you've heard a preacher preach right and
[1:21:33] he's just preached the stuff and he's
[1:21:34] got given no backing but I'm giving you
[1:21:37] some backing
[1:21:38] so that you can pray specifically for
[1:21:40] God to totally heal your breach totally
[1:21:43] take that weak spot away from you who
[1:21:45] wants that weak spot who says we have to
[1:21:48] have that weak spot till the end of the
[1:21:49] Rapture right no Prophet didn't say that
[1:21:51] that's just what some preachers are
[1:21:53] saying
[1:21:54] the prophet never said that that would
[1:21:56] be there till the end
[1:21:57] he never said that but he said everyone
[1:21:58] has one
[1:22:00] but he didn't say God can't take it away
[1:22:01] and especially when the Capstone comes
[1:22:04] down on the church at the end time
[1:22:06] listen to this and you remember the
[1:22:09] opening scripture I read how when the
[1:22:11] day where the sun would shine as the
[1:22:12] moon and the moon and all of that and
[1:22:14] and how in the day that he binds up the
[1:22:16] breach of his people
[1:22:18] do you know what he says before that he
[1:22:20] says the day after the tower was full
[1:22:22] and I've always thought that that was
[1:22:24] the Twin Towers because in
[1:22:27] 2001 from that time on the whole message
[1:22:31] changed
[1:22:32] and there was a great Revival and a
[1:22:34] great Unity that opened up in the
[1:22:35] message it wasn't the time of Judges
[1:22:36] anymore there was it wasn't just
[1:22:38] politics and fighting
[1:22:39] with a tiny remnant of True Believers
[1:22:41] but it's actually people Awakening into
[1:22:43] a love condition
[1:22:45] and this was all tying into what I'm
[1:22:47] about to say that that we're coming into
[1:22:49] a great time of prophetic fulfillment
[1:22:51] and I'm about to give you some
[1:22:53] background so please just bear with me
[1:22:55] therefore thus saith the Lord God
[1:22:58] behold I lay in Zion a foundation stone
[1:23:01] a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a
[1:23:04] sure Foundation he that believes shall
[1:23:07] not make haste or should I say he that
[1:23:09] believes shall not be unstable
[1:23:11] not just running to and fro finding
[1:23:13] Solutions all that but you're stable
[1:23:15] strengthened settled
[1:23:18] established in the truth in the present
[1:23:20] truth that's the purpose of the Capstone
[1:23:23] coming down
[1:23:24] to break Babylon out of your life to set
[1:23:27] you free to show you who you are to give
[1:23:29] you wisdom skill and understanding in
[1:23:31] the word to bring you to a place where
[1:23:33] you're not sleepy in church anymore
[1:23:36] you can turn and it doesn't matter how
[1:23:38] good a preacher or better preacher may
[1:23:40] be you can receive the word judgment
[1:23:42] also will I lay to the line and
[1:23:45] righteousness to the plummet and the
[1:23:47] hail shall sweep away the Refuge of Lies
[1:23:51] how many people are stuck in in these
[1:23:53] lies seeking refuge in your life there's
[1:23:56] lies just over and over and spinning
[1:23:59] around in your head
[1:24:01] and you're constantly just underlies and
[1:24:04] lies and all these things and it's
[1:24:05] affecting you but God says that no in
[1:24:08] the end time I'm going to sweep those
[1:24:10] things away and I'm going to clear the
[1:24:13] air I'm going to remove the elephant in
[1:24:15] the room as it were I'm going to remove
[1:24:18] those things that are confusing you
[1:24:20] and it's going to be clear and all the
[1:24:22] lies are going to be exposed and the
[1:24:23] devil's going to have no hand because
[1:24:25] that's all he's ever had a bow with no
[1:24:27] arrows and the water shall overflow The
[1:24:30] Hiding Place amen this is what is
[1:24:34] happening the Capstone is coming to Zion
[1:24:36] Zion is the bride every lie and
[1:24:39] everything that the devil has told on
[1:24:40] you is being obliterated even to the
[1:24:43] point where true justification has been
[1:24:45] revealed to you and everything that the
[1:24:48] devil's done and he's and even the
[1:24:50] things that he's got you to do now you
[1:24:52] realize that they're on his head
[1:24:56] and Isaiah 28 verses 18 He says and your
[1:24:59] Covenant with Death Shall be disannulled
[1:25:01] and your agreement with hell shall not
[1:25:04] stand
[1:25:08] this is the Lord's doing for the Lord
[1:25:10] shall rise up as in Mount perazim and he
[1:25:13] shall be wrath as in the valley of
[1:25:15] gibeon that he may do his work his
[1:25:18] strange work and bring to pass his act
[1:25:20] his strange act do you know what that is
[1:25:23] that is and this is where I was saying
[1:25:25] how
[1:25:26] um after 2001 and the after the towers
[1:25:29] have fallen and the light of this
[1:25:31] message and everything has come if
[1:25:33] there's a Unity amongst the bride what
[1:25:35] is happening is the tribesmen the the
[1:25:37] the pastors the the ministry and the
[1:25:41] people as a result are coming together
[1:25:43] to bring David into kingship Jesus is
[1:25:47] becoming the king of this message the
[1:25:49] one that actually gave it is finally
[1:25:51] being exalted
[1:25:52] because of unity because of love because
[1:25:55] of an atmosphere in the fellowship and
[1:25:57] in the churches where he can come it's
[1:25:59] not just some legal tourist environment
[1:26:00] or some religious formal education
[1:26:04] system but there's a dynamic of the Holy
[1:26:07] Spirit and David the people have come
[1:26:09] together to anoint David King and Israel
[1:26:11] when they anointed David King this
[1:26:13] battle of perazim was the battle that
[1:26:16] they fought
[1:26:19] so God is saying that in the end time
[1:26:22] when I put my Capstone in the church I'm
[1:26:24] actually going to break the Covenant of
[1:26:26] hell I'm going to totally break hell off
[1:26:29] my bride I'm going to break hell off the
[1:26:31] people I'm going to break all their
[1:26:32] covenants with death and all their
[1:26:34] covenants with all their false
[1:26:35] generations and everything that's
[1:26:36] hindered the bride everything that's
[1:26:38] held her on the ground because she's
[1:26:40] going to fly she's going to have a body
[1:26:42] change she's going to come into perfect
[1:26:43] Faith she's going to have victory in
[1:26:46] every single every area of her life
[1:26:49] that's enough to give God praise that's
[1:26:52] enough to Shout to the Lord or the Earth
[1:26:55] this is what he's doing in this hour and
[1:26:58] what is he doing and and then all of a
[1:27:00] sudden right in our time we're anointing
[1:27:02] David King not because we're anything
[1:27:03] better than anyone else it's the season
[1:27:06] it's the time it's the prophecy being
[1:27:09] fulfilled and all you need to do is just
[1:27:11] Worship the Lord remain humble the
[1:27:13] prophet said that in the seventh seal
[1:27:14] don't try and figure it out be mystical
[1:27:16] be some mysterious teacher but just be
[1:27:20] humble and worship God and walk in his
[1:27:22] word he will fulfill his word by
[1:27:24] bringing it to her
[1:27:26] and so what are we in now we're in this
[1:27:28] time and he says now the Lord shall rise
[1:27:30] up as in Mount perazim which is the
[1:27:33] bridge so now what happened was then
[1:27:35] David took his men after he was anointed
[1:27:38] king and the Philistines now you wonder
[1:27:40] why you're in war you wonder why you're
[1:27:42] having hard times because when David was
[1:27:44] anointed king the Philistines heard of
[1:27:46] it and they began to fight against
[1:27:48] Israel they they came to them the the
[1:27:51] war ground as soon as they saw that
[1:27:53] David was king of all Israel that
[1:27:55] something in them was like oh we've got
[1:27:57] to go fight I thought man you guys are
[1:27:58] crazy you guys been beaten by this guy
[1:28:01] for like hundreds of years like 50 odd
[1:28:04] years or whatever 30 years and you've
[1:28:06] been beaten all the time and now you're
[1:28:08] just this is the devil
[1:28:10] so you might be going through battles
[1:28:12] because David has been anointed king and
[1:28:14] the Philistines gathered to David and
[1:28:17] David smote them he said to the Lord
[1:28:19] um Lord shall Garden the Lord says
[1:28:21] doubtless I will deliver
[1:28:23] without doubt
[1:28:25] I will deliver
[1:28:27] them into your hands it's specific how
[1:28:29] the Lord said it and so then what does
[1:28:31] he do they went and fought them and he
[1:28:33] delivered them into his hands and a lot
[1:28:34] of them ran away so it wasn't a total
[1:28:36] Deliverance at the start and so what
[1:28:39] happened was they came back the grace of
[1:28:41] God now the battles was God's grace to
[1:28:44] you he doesn't want no Philistines
[1:28:46] lurking in your life
[1:28:48] he doesn't want those things that make
[1:28:49] you feel strange make you feel
[1:28:51] discontented make you feel lustful make
[1:28:54] you feel fearful he doesn't want those
[1:28:55] so he's going to allow the Philistines
[1:28:57] to put themselves an array against you
[1:28:59] so don't be condemned
[1:29:01] don't fret be strict and established and
[1:29:05] settled in the battle because you've
[1:29:07] anointed David King who's anointed David
[1:29:09] King
[1:29:10] who's exalted him in their life
[1:29:12] hallelujah what does that mean it means
[1:29:15] war it's not been a good easy time for
[1:29:17] you it means a war because it's the Last
[1:29:19] Frontier it's the last battles right
[1:29:21] before everything's conquered Hallelujah
[1:29:24] so this is all time together for this
[1:29:26] moment and then he says and then the
[1:29:28] belly of gibeon what is gibeon gibeon is
[1:29:30] where the the Philistines said came up
[1:29:33] again and the Lord said David said shall
[1:29:36] I go up and the Lord said yes but fetch
[1:29:39] a compass go around the back by the
[1:29:41] mulberry bushes and when you hear the
[1:29:43] sound of a going then hidden and fight
[1:29:47] because the Lord will deliver the whole
[1:29:49] host now so you see the last time the
[1:29:52] day David took them from the front and
[1:29:54] they escaped back but the second time he
[1:29:58] was a total deliverance and and God see
[1:30:02] if you just follow the lord if you trust
[1:30:04] the Lord in this battle don't try and
[1:30:07] figure it out yourself that's you
[1:30:08] holding that chain together don't do
[1:30:11] that let the captain come and I'll cover
[1:30:13] that chain for you let him come and hold
[1:30:16] your family together let him come and
[1:30:18] bring that Deliverance because he gave a
[1:30:20] specific instruction he said go around
[1:30:22] the back well they're not going to
[1:30:24] escape this time and the Lord said and I
[1:30:25] give you the whole host
[1:30:27] the whole host
[1:30:28] but he says this that he may do his work
[1:30:31] his strange work and bring to pass his
[1:30:33] act his strange act and I thought my
[1:30:35] goodness what is this strange act and
[1:30:38] and and and so I'll just keep reading
[1:30:41] so it says here is not this just give me
[1:30:44] five minutes please it's not this the
[1:30:46] fast that I have chosen now but we want
[1:30:48] to get our perspective right in this
[1:30:49] hour right we don't just want to be
[1:30:51] going off on a tangent or we want to be
[1:30:55] focused and we want to be led by the
[1:30:56] captain and we want to make sure that
[1:30:58] we're at the mulberry bushes right we
[1:31:00] want to make sure we're at the
[1:31:01] Battlefront we're right where the Lord
[1:31:03] speaks us don't go and fight your
[1:31:05] crosshairs over there and certainly
[1:31:06] don't put your crosshairs on each other
[1:31:08] it's not your brother it's not your
[1:31:10] sister
[1:31:11] it's the devil
[1:31:13] and your old nature which is what we're
[1:31:16] dealing with right now is this not the
[1:31:18] fast that I have chosen to loose the
[1:31:20] bands of wickedness
[1:31:22] to undo the heavy burden and to let the
[1:31:24] oppressed go free
[1:31:26] that you break every yoke every yoke not
[1:31:30] just some this is a time of every yoke
[1:31:32] this is a time of total Deliverance
[1:31:35] Isaiah now we skip down to verse 12. and
[1:31:37] it says and they shall be of be and they
[1:31:40] that shall be of thee shall build the
[1:31:42] old waste places
[1:31:43] Thou shalt raise up the foundations of
[1:31:46] many generations
[1:31:48] I'll be speaking about that and thou
[1:31:50] shalt be called the repairer of the
[1:31:52] bridge
[1:31:53] the restorer of paths to dwell in so you
[1:31:57] see now what is God telling you
[1:31:59] this is something very precious but he's
[1:32:01] actually saying that I want to be born
[1:32:03] in you so that I can use you to repair
[1:32:06] breaches
[1:32:07] so that I can use you to build lives
[1:32:10] so that I can use your ministry so I can
[1:32:12] use your calling so that I can use your
[1:32:14] giftings this is why you fast so that
[1:32:17] these things can happen that I can break
[1:32:19] the burdens I can break yolks I can set
[1:32:21] people free I can provide for people I
[1:32:24] can heal the breach in people's lives
[1:32:26] but I'm looking for people that will get
[1:32:28] into the spirit looking for people that
[1:32:31] will walk looking for people that have
[1:32:33] courage looking for people that are on
[1:32:35] fire
[1:32:37] amen not religious
[1:32:40] not just intellectual
[1:32:41] but he's looking for a people that are
[1:32:43] willing to sacrifice their life
[1:32:46] see God use them to repair preachers to
[1:32:51] raise up the foundation of many
[1:32:54] generations what is he doing he wants to
[1:32:58] repair all of the Brokenness in your
[1:33:00] family all those things that you have
[1:33:02] inherited those things that are pulling
[1:33:04] you down those things that were broken
[1:33:06] down your forefathers he wants to raise
[1:33:08] up and heal
[1:33:10] he wants to give you Victory he wants to
[1:33:12] search your life see the prophet when he
[1:33:15] was here that glory and that anointing
[1:33:18] was healing the body
[1:33:19] you notice that he was always caught
[1:33:22] people coming out of cots stretches
[1:33:24] coming out of uh the dead was being
[1:33:27] physical
[1:33:29] it was very little on the spiritual
[1:33:30] right he wasn't really dealing in the
[1:33:32] spiritual very rare there was a few
[1:33:34] sermons that really dealt with the mind
[1:33:36] but it was mainly and his ministry was
[1:33:38] Healing The Sick and the Word was locked
[1:33:40] up in Prophecy and then released even to
[1:33:43] this day of the healing of the Mind the
[1:33:46] healing of the spirit but in his
[1:33:48] ministry when he was physically here it
[1:33:50] was focused mainly on cots and stretches
[1:33:52] right so he the law was anointing him to
[1:33:54] heal the body but now there's an
[1:33:56] anointing to heal the spirit there's an
[1:33:59] anointing to heal the mind there's an
[1:34:01] anointing to repair the breach
[1:34:03] Hallelujah said the glory so when you
[1:34:05] see in a vision when there was the tent
[1:34:08] vision and and the angel of law was
[1:34:10] standing with brother Branham showing
[1:34:11] him the third pull and showing him what
[1:34:13] was going to take place in the ministry
[1:34:15] and he said there was people that walked
[1:34:17] in crippled
[1:34:18] and they walked up to this box and they
[1:34:21] went in there and when they came out
[1:34:22] they were well
[1:34:24] and then many times he says no you
[1:34:26] forsake your cops and stretches forsake
[1:34:29] that cancer it is of the devil now rise
[1:34:32] up in the name of Jesus Christ and focus
[1:34:35] on a physical healing in many cases not
[1:34:38] subject to whatever the Lord wanted to
[1:34:39] do but many the very thrust was a
[1:34:43] physical healing of the people and so
[1:34:46] raised up the people but now the same
[1:34:49] God is here to heal the mind to heal and
[1:34:54] raise up the broken generations and the
[1:34:57] foundation of many generations and you
[1:35:01] you
[1:35:02] you
[1:35:04] all of you
[1:35:05] shall be called
[1:35:07] the repairer of the breach
[1:35:10] there were breaches in the walls of
[1:35:12] Jerusalem
[1:35:15] God used people
[1:35:21] you see
[1:35:24] the first appearing of the repairer now
[1:35:27] it's not you
[1:35:29] before I speak on this it's not you
[1:35:33] that does the repairing
[1:35:35] it's the impregnated word inside you
[1:35:39] you are nothing absolutely all you are
[1:35:42] is a vessel just like Mary
[1:35:44] you see Mary
[1:35:46] she an angel a mighty angel came down
[1:35:49] of a message
[1:35:51] to Herald the first appearing of the
[1:35:54] repairer of the breach and he paid for
[1:35:57] the sin of the whole world but first if
[1:36:00] you take Mary and personalize Mary here
[1:36:02] she is receiving the May Angel's message
[1:36:04] she receives the word for her day and
[1:36:07] she takes it in and that word conceived
[1:36:09] in her heart but because of what is
[1:36:11] needed the Lord produced a physical
[1:36:14] manifestation in her life
[1:36:16] the physical manifestation in your life
[1:36:19] is the life change is the separation
[1:36:21] from sin is the healing of the mind is
[1:36:23] the healing of the spirit is the change
[1:36:25] of your nature and you and your clothes
[1:36:29] change women start wearing woman's
[1:36:31] clothes Men start wearing men's clothes
[1:36:32] and modesty and all those things right
[1:36:34] that's a physical manifestation of a
[1:36:36] spiritual thing that happened but in
[1:36:38] that hour that world needed a savior the
[1:36:41] world needed a lamb so God produced a
[1:36:44] physical life
[1:36:46] inside the believing bride
[1:36:50] and the first appearing of the repairer
[1:36:53] now Mary this is how much the work of
[1:36:57] the repairing I'm giving you this so you
[1:36:59] realize what Jesus wants to do through
[1:37:01] you to you and through you
[1:37:03] first to you and then through you right
[1:37:06] that's why he doesn't want you to be
[1:37:07] troubled with lust doesn't want you to
[1:37:09] be troubled with all these little pity
[1:37:10] things
[1:37:12] doesn't want that stuff he wants you to
[1:37:15] be well he wants you to be pure he wants
[1:37:17] all your channels to be clear he wants
[1:37:19] all your wires to be connected so that
[1:37:22] the lightning of his holy spirit can
[1:37:23] work through you and when people come to
[1:37:25] your house and they say I've got a
[1:37:27] headache and you say no you don't it's
[1:37:29] gone
[1:37:30] why because you're a son why because
[1:37:33] you're a daughter
[1:37:34] you try that now you say that it won't
[1:37:36] go
[1:37:37] guarantee you won't go unless God's
[1:37:40] Sovereign Grace works but if you if that
[1:37:42] breach is gone you can speak and it will
[1:37:44] happen
[1:37:45] to speak it'll happen
[1:37:47] there's got to be a certain level of
[1:37:49] maturity for that to take place right
[1:37:50] it's all time locked but let's not make
[1:37:52] excuses for our lack of faith and
[1:37:53] unbelief don't make excuses there's a
[1:37:56] reason why it's because there's breaches
[1:37:58] in your hole and it's under the water
[1:38:00] and you're hiding it from people and
[1:38:01] it's under there and no one can see it
[1:38:03] but God wants to hear
[1:38:05] it but anyway this is how separated this
[1:38:07] work of the repairer through you is Mary
[1:38:11] was only responsible for believing
[1:38:14] and when she believed that's what
[1:38:16] happened to her her life changed her
[1:38:18] clothing changed her attitude changed
[1:38:20] her hunger changed her food changed the
[1:38:23] life inside her was calling for a
[1:38:25] certain food
[1:38:26] the life inside her was calling for a
[1:38:28] bit of this and a bit of that and Joseph
[1:38:29] would have to go get it right just like
[1:38:31] when your wife was pregnant and whatnot
[1:38:33] and there was different Cravings because
[1:38:34] there was a life calling for it but
[1:38:36] there was a life inside of her but the
[1:38:38] lamb needed to be born so he came forth
[1:38:40] and he was born and then he began to do
[1:38:42] the works and he began to change lives
[1:38:44] and he began to preach the gospel and
[1:38:46] Glad Tidings and he was anointed with
[1:38:48] the spirit and he raised the dead and he
[1:38:50] and he and he and he preached the word
[1:38:52] to everybody and and then he paid for
[1:38:54] the sins of the whole world now you
[1:38:57] can't ascribe that to Mary
[1:38:58] right because he came forth from Mary
[1:39:01] but now at the second appearing of the
[1:39:04] repairer after the devil you know
[1:39:06] because you see he came forth he bridged
[1:39:08] the way he bound the breach of the
[1:39:10] people sin was broken and now there was
[1:39:13] a connection between God and man right
[1:39:15] great connection was formed the chasm
[1:39:17] was formed but what did the devil do he
[1:39:20] got it closed closed off and began to
[1:39:23] trouble the people and and put lies and
[1:39:26] he got sealed over
[1:39:28] just like they sealed over the tomb and
[1:39:30] held the Life of Christ in the Tomb with
[1:39:32] a Roman seal so that same Roman Spirit
[1:39:35] came over the church and sealed that
[1:39:37] life back in the Tomb
[1:39:39] until it was only a very small remnant
[1:39:41] of people that was true believers
[1:39:42] throughout the ages and even in the Dark
[1:39:44] Age it was almost canceled
[1:39:46] but that had to happen right but then
[1:39:48] Here Comes God restoring it back and
[1:39:51] then in 1963 yes in 1963 here comes a
[1:39:55] mighty Angel down to a woman again to
[1:39:59] reveal the message right now this
[1:40:02] message
[1:40:04] I just felt like grabbing this out of
[1:40:07] Ben's office but this message
[1:40:10] and it came down with an open book
[1:40:14] and it came to a bride and he gave it to
[1:40:17] the seventh angel and the seventh angel
[1:40:19] began to preach
[1:40:21] the heralding of the second coming of
[1:40:22] the Lord
[1:40:24] and a woman just here we are
[1:40:28] receives the word of this Mighty Angel
[1:40:30] that's come down right and now a prophet
[1:40:33] says yes and that seed of the word
[1:40:34] enters your spirit enters your mind and
[1:40:36] you agree with it right and then that
[1:40:38] seed comes down into your body and you
[1:40:41] begin to manifest the word and the word
[1:40:43] starts to manifest in your life but
[1:40:46] there's no need for a lamb there's
[1:40:48] already a lamb the lamb has been
[1:40:50] revealed my salvation has been sealed
[1:40:52] it's been settled but inside you he
[1:40:55] stays inside you so yes he was born and
[1:40:57] Mary at a certain point but in you he
[1:41:00] continues to develop
[1:41:07] are you with me
[1:41:10] I have to just squeeze all this in
[1:41:11] because if I don't it won't tie the
[1:41:13] whole thing together and we'll just be
[1:41:15] stopping in the middle of the thought
[1:41:18] someday there would be a just one who
[1:41:20] would come made comfortable to this
[1:41:23] world conformable to this world and in
[1:41:25] the form of God's image made after the
[1:41:27] fashion of man would take upon him the
[1:41:30] form of sinful flesh otherwise would
[1:41:32] stand in the breach
[1:41:34] between an Angry God a holy God and a
[1:41:37] sinful man and would put his hands on
[1:41:39] both of them and Bridge the way you see
[1:41:42] that's what he did when he came and he
[1:41:44] revealed himself and he did all these
[1:41:45] works so he came forth from Mary but he
[1:41:48] knew what he's doing in you because you
[1:41:50] believe the word of the mighty angel in
[1:41:51] the end time to Herald the second coming
[1:41:53] he's manifested in your life so that he
[1:41:55] can use you to do the same things that
[1:41:58] he did when he was walking the streets
[1:42:00] of Galilee
[1:42:01] but he needs you to be healed he needs
[1:42:04] your breaches to be bound up this is
[1:42:06] what he wants to do in our hour
[1:42:07] Hallelujah do you believe that amen and
[1:42:10] would stand in the breach
[1:42:13] Isaiah 31-32 for through the voice of
[1:42:18] the Lord the Assyrian will be broken and
[1:42:20] the Lord's Rod will be lifted up against
[1:42:22] him and every blow of the rod of his
[1:42:25] punishment which the Lord will send on
[1:42:27] him will be with the sound of music and
[1:42:30] with the waving of his sword the Lord
[1:42:32] will make war against him and you're so
[1:42:35] glad that the Lord would give us music
[1:42:39] speaking of Music can I have the
[1:42:41] musicians please
[1:42:44] hmm
[1:42:45] The Voice
[1:42:47] why would God say these things
[1:42:49] he's trying to identify that in the hour
[1:42:51] and the days of the voice of the Lord
[1:42:52] he's going to break the power of Satan
[1:42:55] out of your life and his Rod will be
[1:42:57] lifted up against him and every blow of
[1:42:59] the rod of his punishment which the Lord
[1:43:01] will send on him will be with the sound
[1:43:03] of
[1:43:04] music and with the waving of a sword
[1:43:07] Hallelujah the Lord will make war
[1:43:09] against them
[1:43:11] this is what God is doing in this hour
[1:43:16] who's ready
[1:43:18] stand up
[1:43:21] this is interactive now the sermon
[1:43:23] hasn't finished but can you play I know

[1:43:31] this is we're not finished
[1:43:35] I've gone through all this
[1:43:37] and it's been laborious
[1:43:39] for this this is a moment now I want you
[1:43:42] to be very serious
[1:43:45] this is wartime
[1:43:47] and you're going to speak to the enemy

[1:43:50] going to speak to the the the out you're
[1:43:54] just going to voice this we're gonna
[1:43:55] it's battle time
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:43:59] the hatred of sin
[1:44:03] has lust's ultimatum
[1:44:06] it's time for you to stop bearing with
[1:44:08] the sin in your life it's time for you
[1:44:10] to take those ones that you've placed in
[1:44:12] tribute
[1:44:14] those little Natures that are inside you
[1:44:16] that you're struggling with that you're
[1:44:17] just like I'll live with it don't live
[1:44:19] with it any longer no more don't leave
[1:44:21] here
[1:44:22] tonight without dealing with that
[1:44:25] I know it's late I know you're probably
[1:44:28] tired you want to go to work tomorrow
[1:44:29] but what's work going to get you money
[1:44:32] who cares it's just money let's not be
[1:44:35] too regimented
[1:44:37] where we have to finish at a certain
[1:44:38] time all the time
[1:44:40] when there is an opportunity now like
[1:44:44] Jacob took his opportunity
[1:44:46] to walk in the spirit is to take that
[1:44:49] Jew opportunity that you have
[1:44:51] listen to this hate the evil and love
[1:44:54] the good and establish judgment in the
[1:44:56] gate it may be that the Lord will be
[1:44:58] gracious unto the remnant of Joseph
[1:45:02] fear the lord is to hate evil the fear
[1:45:06] of the Lord is to hate evil pride and
[1:45:08] arrogancy in the evil way in the throat
[1:45:10] mouth do I hate
[1:45:12] listen here
[1:45:17] you know that's what ought to happen to
[1:45:21] you here on these cots and stretches
[1:45:23] this afternoon
[1:45:24] just get a little mad at the Devil
[1:45:28] say you old lying Rascal you're a liar
[1:45:31] Christ made me free I don't have to sit
[1:45:33] like this no more
[1:45:35] and I don't want you we may not have
[1:45:37] cots and stretches tonight but there's
[1:45:39] things that can your life very
[1:45:41] easily
[1:45:42] there's things that I'm talking to
[1:45:44] myself here too
[1:45:46] that we bear with
[1:45:48] but there is a Capstone in our life
[1:45:50] there's there's this Grace tonight
[1:45:54] that we can warn our the Lord is here to
[1:45:57] make war against that Assyrian
[1:45:59] and he says with the sound of music and
[1:46:01] the waving of the sword that's why I had
[1:46:04] the burden on my heart
[1:46:06] to wave the sword at you so that you can
[1:46:09] take the sword in your own hands tonight
[1:46:11] and you can wage war on the enemy with
[1:46:13] me
[1:46:14] because I believe together we can come
[1:46:17] together we can stop thinking about how
[1:46:19] long I'm preaching we can stop thinking
[1:46:20] about going home and we can wait some
[1:46:22] more on that stupid devil that slimy
[1:46:24] snake that's ruined our families has
[1:46:26] ruined and caused prodigal sons and
[1:46:28] daughters out in the world taking drugs
[1:46:29] having sex and all those things with
[1:46:31] people that's the Satan that we need to
[1:46:34] fight today and I believe that the Lord
[1:46:36] wants to wage war on him but he's
[1:46:38] looking for a people that are willing
[1:46:40] he's looking for a people they're going
[1:46:42] to toe the line as the prophet says he
[1:46:44] says this you he says to them you're
[1:46:46] lying Rascal I don't have to sit like
[1:46:47] this no more I'm not going to be
[1:46:49] crippled anymore he says to the devil
[1:46:51] get out of here
[1:46:52] tow the line with him brother toe the
[1:46:55] love with him sister
[1:46:56] he hasn't got a bit of authority Jesus
[1:46:58] stripped him of every legal right he had
[1:47:00] when he died at Calvary the whole
[1:47:02] question of Salvation and healing was
[1:47:04] settled at Calvary
