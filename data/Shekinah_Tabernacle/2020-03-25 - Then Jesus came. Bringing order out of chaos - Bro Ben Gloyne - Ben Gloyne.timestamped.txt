[6:58] yes good to see everyone and I trust you
[7:00] feel the spirit of Lord with you
[7:01] wherever you are and I'm you let's just
[7:03] turn to the scripture - I want to go to
[7:06] Genesis chapter 1 and in verse 2 if
[7:11] you've got your Bibles with you I mean
[7:17] if you want to unmute yourself so I can
[7:20] yes we're gonna hear one another it's
[7:22] perfectly fine they just say Amen when
[7:29] you're there
[7:32] and I want to read I want to read a
[7:35] Genesis chapter 1 and verses 1 & 2 so to
[7:40] my left is my as as the other five of
[7:44] the family yes oh god bless you and yeah
[7:51] it's yeah I'm just so happy we can still
[7:54] meet even though we can't physically be
[7:56] in the same building we can do it either
[7:59] doesn't Samsung team you know somebody
[8:06] it's not that out here
[8:10] okay so let's just go to Genesis 1 and
[8:13] and verses 1 & 2 in the beginning God
[8:18] created the heaven and the earth and the
[8:20] earth was without form and void and
[8:23] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[8:25] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[8:29] face of the waters and let's just go - I
[8:32] just want to take a context from from
[8:34] John chapter 11 just which I trust as a
[8:40] well familiar story to us the story of
[8:42] Lazarus Lazarus being raised from the
[8:45] dead I mean and then I just want to take
[8:52] the first part of of John chapter 11 and
[8:55] verse 17 just as a bit of a context here
[8:58] on it so it says here then when Jesus
[9:05] came amen
[9:08] then when Jesus came and if I could take
[9:12] a take a thought or a subject tonight I
[9:14] want to speak about taking getting order
[9:16] out of chaos and so let's just bow our
[9:20] heads for a word of Prayer and let's
[9:22] just seek the Lord Lord Jesus we're so
[9:24] thankful that we can truly as we have
[9:26] sung tonight Here I am to worship Here I
[9:29] am to bow down Here I am to say that
[9:32] you're my god you are all together
[9:34] lovely you're all together worthy Lord
[9:36] you're altogether wonderful to me now I
[9:38] want to thank you Lord that in this day
[9:40] Lord the world is falling apart Lord
[9:44] there's great turmoil turmoil
[9:46] the land but Lord in the hut out of your
[9:48] bride Lord this peace nothing assurance
[9:50] this stability law because your word is
[9:52] on the inside of the inside of us Lord
[9:54] and I just pray father as we open that
[9:56] Lord as we've opened the pages of your
[9:58] word and lord I just pray father that
[10:01] you would Lord we know anyone who can
[10:02] read can open the book but Lord takes
[10:04] you to come the divine author and make
[10:06] it live in our hearts oh but I pray
[10:08] you'd manifest your word Lord father may
[10:10] your presence be very real wherever
[10:12] we're seated right now Lord we're so
[10:14] thankful you said in your word where two
[10:16] or three gathered in my name dear you
[10:17] are in the midst Lord so Lord we have
[10:20] full assurance you're with each and
[10:22] every one of us now O God and you also
[10:24] said you'd never leave us nor forsake us
[10:26] so you'd be with the individual as well
[10:27] I got so pray father we'd have a very
[10:29] blessed time Lord in your word and Lord
[10:32] our hearts burn within us as you speak
[10:33] to us along the way Lord may you grant
[10:35] it in Jesus Christ and we ask amen I
[10:39] mean so I'd like to speak if I could
[10:41] take a thought I want to speak about
[10:43] taking taking order out of chaos now we
[10:48] we we read there in Genesis chapter 1
[10:51] where where the it says in the beginning
[10:54] that God created heavens and earth and
[10:56] there's a period and and brother Bram
[10:58] tells us we do not know the time between
[11:00] the end of verse 1 and the start of
[11:02] verse 2 we do know not the length of
[11:04] days or the years or whatever it may be
[11:06] but they came a time when the Spirit of
[11:09] God began to brood brood over the earth
[11:11] and God when he came to the earth he
[11:13] found it in a chaos you know was was
[11:16] without form and void darkness cover the
[11:19] face of the deep there's no even though
[11:21] there was seed there was life buried in
[11:23] the earth you know it was covered in
[11:25] darkness it was just a chaos there's no
[11:27] order there there's no arrangement of
[11:29] nature there was no there was no you
[11:32] know there was no what he call it you
[11:33] know you know different parts of nature
[11:36] of you know botany life and animal life
[11:38] and it was just a chaos and and whenever
[11:41] God we find when when God comes to the
[11:43] earth and and and very important
[11:45] junctions of time and he finds a chaos
[11:47] but he brings it into an order and so we
[11:50] see here when we read from you know you
[11:52] read through Genesis 1 and you and then
[11:54] you keep reading down through and and as
[11:56] the Spirit of God brooded you know you
[11:58] know
[11:59] came upon the face of the yo-yo the
[12:03] Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[12:04] waters and then he began to speak he
[12:06] said let there be life and light
[12:08] appeared and you know and he and he kept
[12:10] speaking the more as he spoke to the
[12:12] earth
[12:12] you know creation came forth and the and
[12:15] you're the water you're receded dry land
[12:18] came forth a minute it said God said let
[12:21] all the seed you know bring forth after
[12:23] its kind and and we understand from
[12:25] reading the scripture and and in the
[12:27] proper telling us that the seeds of the
[12:29] Botany life were already in the earth so
[12:31] their seed already in the earth God
[12:33] didn't say he created it it was already
[12:34] there but he caused the darkness to move
[12:36] back he caused the water to move back I
[12:38] mean for the for the seeds that were
[12:40] buried under the soil to come to a
[12:42] certain light would fall upon it the
[12:45] soil will come to a certain temperature
[12:46] that it could come to life the seat and
[12:48] in the life and those seeds started you
[12:51] know started growing and it's exactly
[12:54] the same thing with you and I friends
[12:55] your darkness covered us we were born in
[12:57] darkness we were born in chaos I'm in an
[13:00] age of chaos and but yet God knew that
[13:03] there was a life on the inside of the
[13:04] inside of us and he was he was
[13:06] determined to brood over us until the
[13:08] life that he saw before the foundation
[13:10] of the world would become manifested in
[13:13] our lives it's like when he brooded over
[13:15] the earth there in Genesis 1 and 2 I
[13:17] mean he wasn't hoping that life would be
[13:19] formed on the earth he knew life would
[13:21] be formed on the earth I mean that's why
[13:23] he had a purpose of a spirit moving upon
[13:25] the you know you know upon the earth
[13:27] because he wanted the life that was in
[13:29] his mind to be manifested and it's the
[13:31] same thing with you and I that's why the
[13:33] Spirit of God found you that's why this
[13:35] message found you is because you know he
[13:37] saw there was a scene see gene of God
[13:39] inside you I mean and he was determined
[13:42] to brood over you until that seed came
[13:44] to life hallelujah but you know it's an
[13:48] incredible thing we were born in chaos I
[13:50] mean we were children of Wrath even as
[13:52] others that season Jim Ephesians chapter
[13:54] 2 but God Richard mercy Alleluia I mean
[13:58] let's see it's such a tremendous piece
[14:01] of Scripture let's go to Ephesians in
[14:03] chapter 2 there's one of my favorite
[14:07] favorite scriptures right here men I
[14:10] mean can can can everyone hear me okay
[14:12] yeah
[14:13] Hey am I too loud okay sorry Ephesians
[14:19] two and one and you have he quickens he
[14:22] once did who were dead in trespasses and
[14:25] sins where and in times past you walked
[14:27] according to the course of this world
[14:29] according to the Prince of the power of
[14:31] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[14:34] the children of disobedience this is
[14:36] what we once were among whom also ye all
[14:39] had our conversation in times past and
[14:42] the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[14:44] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[14:47] we're by nature the children of Wrath
[14:49] even as others other sisters how we once
[14:52] were but God who's rich and mercy and
[14:54] he's still rich in mercy tonight for his
[14:56] great lover and he loved us even when we
[14:59] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[15:01] together with Christ by grace ye are
[15:03] saved and hath raised us up together and
[15:06] made us sit together in heavenly places
[15:08] in Christ Jesus and that ages to come he
[15:11] might show the exceeding riches of His
[15:13] grace and his kindness towards us
[15:15] through Christ Jesus for by grace you're
[15:18] saved through faith and that is not of
[15:20] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[15:22] works lest any man should boast
[15:24] for we are his workmanship I'm glad
[15:26] we're his workmanship created in Christ
[15:28] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[15:31] before ordained that we should walk in
[15:33] them hallelujah so so God found God
[15:38] found the world and a chaos and he
[15:41] brooded over the earth and he brought
[15:43] out an Eden that was that was in his
[15:45] mind and not just those but then his
[15:46] children became manifested upon the
[15:48] earth so sorry took a chaos and he
[15:51] brought it into an order and then now
[15:53] you find in Noah's day the world was
[15:56] falling apart but yet even out of that
[15:58] chaos an order came as well God came
[16:00] came to a man called Noah he said I'm
[16:02] going to destroy the world because it's
[16:04] fallen into a chaos but then through
[16:06] Noah order came in and and Noah came
[16:09] under the Word of God he became one with
[16:11] the word for his day he built the ark
[16:13] amen and the people were saved
[16:15] hallelujah and then we can say I'm just
[16:17] gonna jump through the scripture quickly
[16:19] show every time God comes I mean you see
[16:21] the angel Lord coming to someone is to
[16:24] bring us to bring chaos into
[16:27] or rather to bring order out of chaos so
[16:29] you see in Moses day and Moses day the
[16:33] children of Israel were the children of
[16:35] God but they were living in a chaos they
[16:37] were they were in slavery you know they
[16:39] weren't in their rightful position they
[16:41] were slaves under the Egyptians so so it
[16:44] was just a chaos they weren't in their
[16:46] right order they weren't in their right
[16:48] place as God saw them and you know
[16:50] brother Bram tells us that when that
[16:52] when Pharaoh and Moses they both looked
[16:55] at the same people they both looked at
[16:56] the children of Israel and Pharaoh just
[16:58] saw slaves but Moses saw God's children
[17:01] right because he was looking through
[17:03] different eyes than what Pharaoh was and
[17:05] so now God came to Moses because he was
[17:08] going to bring he was going to bring the
[17:10] children of Israel out of a chaos of
[17:12] slavery and into an order he was going
[17:14] to place them in the promised land where
[17:15] they were ordained to be so so through
[17:18] through the Ministry of Moses God took
[17:20] the children of Israel out of a chaos
[17:22] and put them into an order hallelujah
[17:25] amen amen he can see the same thing when
[17:27] when Gideon was there there in the
[17:29] promised land but there was a chaos in
[17:30] the land because because the children of
[17:32] Israel weren't living in their right to
[17:34] be condition the Midianites were they're
[17:36] the children of the east were there but
[17:38] in the ancient Lord came down to Gideon
[17:40] because he was gonna take that chaos and
[17:42] bring an order amen you see there we see
[17:45] the cycle keeps repeating you know where
[17:47] there's a chaos God comes and brings
[17:49] order out of their chaos and he brings
[17:50] the people who are in that chaos and
[17:52] brings them into order with God's Word
[17:55] they become one with God's Word for
[17:56] their day amen so then you can see the
[17:59] same thing with Elijah
[18:00] you know Elijah on Mount Carmel there he
[18:02] was he was standing there and and he'd
[18:05] already made the challenge to the
[18:06] prophets of bale and he and but there
[18:08] was a chaos in the arrangement of the
[18:10] worship of God the other altar of God
[18:12] was was was fallen down it it had it had
[18:15] it had come into disrepair and he had to
[18:18] rebuild the altar of God the right
[18:21] approach to God so there was a chaos the
[18:23] altar was a chaos but the ministry of of
[18:26] elijah brought order out of that chaos
[18:29] he read says he rebuilt the altar of the
[18:31] Lord and then once he did that according
[18:33] to the vision he put there he put the
[18:35] wood on in the in the sacrifice and told
[18:37] him to pour the water out upon the you
[18:40] know sacrifice
[18:41] he says Lord I've done all this
[18:42] according to your word amen that and you
[18:45] know he prayed Lord I've done all this
[18:47] according to your word and that you know
[18:49] and that the people of children of
[18:50] Israel would know that thou has turned
[18:52] their hearts back again and in the fire
[18:53] fell and it's when the when the when the
[18:56] altar was rebuilt in the right order
[18:58] then the sacrifice was put at all put
[19:00] upon it and in the fire fell it's the
[19:03] same thing with you and I you know how
[19:05] our walk with God before this message
[19:07] came was a chaos you know many of us
[19:10] believed in three guards maybe not even
[19:12] there wasn't a God you know different
[19:14] ways of baptism different you know all
[19:15] different kind of chaos of religion but
[19:18] then but in this but then the Ministry
[19:20] of Elijah came through through the
[19:22] Prophet and he rebuilt the altar of the
[19:24] Lord now lives you know those stones
[19:26] represent Revelation where where where
[19:29] the altar wasn't disorder but in the
[19:31] word put those revelations in order and
[19:33] then we fell upon that altar right we
[19:36] gave our lives Lord Jesus Christ in the
[19:38] fire fell I mean so he came in to order
[19:40] we're in chaos but then we came in to
[19:43] order now I'm sure we can agree that you
[19:46] know when when Jesus came the first time
[19:48] the world was falling apart rather M
[19:50] says that the world was falling apart in
[19:52] his day but if we looked at his day
[19:54] would say well there seems to be quite a
[19:56] lot of water in his day you know they
[19:57] had they had government you know it
[19:59] wasn't a bunch of barbarians we would we
[20:02] would think back in that day the Romans
[20:03] you know had their great empire they had
[20:05] you know even in the promised land they
[20:07] had their temples they had their
[20:09] traditions they had their hierarchy you
[20:11] know in society they had the high
[20:13] priests and the chief priests and the
[20:14] you know and you know the rulers over
[20:16] the people you know they they had a
[20:18] hierarchy in society they had a you know
[20:20] a form of law and judgment and they had
[20:23] commerce they had religion and but the
[20:25] world was falling apart because the
[20:28] people had fallen away from the true
[20:30] Word of God so God had to come become a
[20:33] man become flesh in order to to to speak
[20:36] to that chaos and bring an order out of
[20:39] that chaos so the people because the
[20:41] people were not living in their right to
[20:43] be conditioned you know when Moses gave
[20:46] the law the purpose of that law was that
[20:48] the people would dwell in their
[20:50] inheritance and peace that was the
[20:52] reason God gave the law says if you
[20:54] if you obey my word then you everyone
[20:56] will live in their inheritance you know
[20:58] the you know you'll you'll you'll sit
[21:00] under your fig tree and under your vine
[21:02] and you know you'll possess the fullness
[21:03] of the land but they had long forgotten
[21:06] that God and now they're living in a
[21:08] chaos under the under the rule of the
[21:10] Romans and they were you know I'm
[21:13] Caiaphas and and and them said you know
[21:16] this man's gonna cause the whole nation
[21:18] to go after him and you know speaking of
[21:20] Jesus and and and they're all worried
[21:23] that the Romans would take away their
[21:24] position in the nation and because what
[21:26] had happened they had fallen into a
[21:28] chaos instead of being in an order with
[21:30] the Word of God that week yeah as this
[21:32] this all making clear so far I mean they
[21:36] need to be living in order but it was
[21:38] actually a chaos because they weren't
[21:41] coming lined up with God's Word there
[21:42] weren't one with the word for their day
[21:44] that's why there was a chaos in the land
[21:46] and then God God but then God became
[21:49] flesh
[21:50] he didn't just hear to just move over
[21:52] the people just in a spirit form but he
[21:55] became a man and began to speak into
[21:57] that chaos to bring an order so in that
[21:59] chaos of of of Israel there was he was a
[22:04] man by the name of Peter you know his
[22:08] daddy told him that you know when
[22:09] Messiah comes he's going to do the
[22:11] supernatural but you know you'd be
[22:12] careful there'd be a whole bunch of
[22:13] false ones come before him but you know
[22:15] we know there's gonna be a messiah and
[22:17] so you know he was told the promise of
[22:20] the scripture but but his life that he
[22:23] was born into was a was a life of chaos
[22:25] he didn't walk with God like Joshua did
[22:28] they didn't have the dominion over their
[22:29] enemies and any land like their
[22:31] forefathers did so it was a chaos but
[22:34] then Jesus came his way
[22:36] and so Jesus came his way and he said
[22:39] come and follow me and he began to take
[22:41] the man Peter and take him out of a
[22:43] chaos and into an order to become one
[22:45] with the word for his day so there was
[22:48] Peter he was a proud man you know he
[22:50] sure he was the only one who walked on
[22:52] water not once but twice you know he was
[22:53] the first one to answer Jesus you know
[22:56] we know that the Christ you know come
[22:57] from God and you know but but he had a
[22:59] pride and he had a you know he had a you
[23:02] know his humanity was actually in chaos
[23:05] because it wasn't surrendered to the
[23:07] word
[23:08] it wasn't surrendered to the Lord Jesus
[23:09] Christ now I just want to you know I'm
[23:12] gonna come back to Jesus going to
[23:14] Lazarus grave but I want to go to the
[23:17] book of Galatians and I just want to
[23:19] show you how he say show you how we are
[23:25] in a chaos when we were born now let's
[23:28] go to Galatians 5 and this is probably
[23:30] maybe going on a big seek way but I just
[23:32] want you to bring this because you know
[23:34] we can say even well before this virus
[23:37] struck the world we could say this world
[23:38] has order you know we haven't had any
[23:41] major Wars for not in my generation
[23:45] there's been peace you know with this
[23:47] being prosperity people quote how many
[23:50] hundreds of millions appeals been lifted
[23:52] out of poverty in the in the recent
[23:54] future you know there's this rule of
[23:56] government there's all these things but
[23:58] in reality man is born into chaos and
[24:01] unless God comes and get a hold of his
[24:04] life he will remain in that chaos and we
[24:07] can see this here if we if we go to
[24:09] Galatians 5 and verse and verse 17 where
[24:12] where the Apostle Paul is speaking to
[24:15] the Galatians and speaking of the works
[24:16] of the flesh and then he and he's gonna
[24:19] speak about the fruits of the spirit now
[24:21] if we if we if we go to Galatians 5 and
[24:26] 17 assists for the spirit lusteth
[24:29] against this so for the flesh lusteth
[24:32] against the spirit and the spirit
[24:33] against the flesh and these are contrary
[24:36] the one to the other so that we cannot
[24:39] do the things that you would but if ye
[24:42] be led of the Spirit ye are not under
[24:44] the law now the works of the flesh are
[24:47] manifest and which are these now I'm
[24:50] sure as we read through this you can say
[24:51] this is chaos
[24:53] this is chaos adultery that's chaos
[24:56] because mimic chaos is just order that's
[24:58] been messed up right something that's an
[25:00] order buts all broken up that's now
[25:02] chaos and there's even the second law of
[25:05] thermodynamics and the universe is
[25:07] everything tends towards disorder that's
[25:09] a that's a that's a fundamental law of
[25:12] the universe the second law of
[25:13] thermodynamics who ever studied who's
[25:16] had to endure thermodynamics anyone
[25:18] [Laughter]
[25:21] but anyway very interesting but but
[25:23] that's a law in the universe that
[25:24] everything tends towards disorder unless
[25:27] a stronger force comes in and applies
[25:30] itself and then it can bring it back to
[25:31] order so we're going to come to that but
[25:33] but I'm sure we can see that this is um
[25:35] this is chaos now the works of the flesh
[25:38] are manifest which are these adultery
[25:39] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[25:42] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[25:45] emulations wrath strife seditions
[25:48] heresies envyings murders drunkenness
[25:52] revelries revellings and such like
[25:56] that's all chaos but yet man is born
[26:00] with that chaos nature it's a fallen
[26:03] nature unfortunate we are born with that
[26:05] see we were born into chaos see it's not
[26:07] just the world was falling apart but man
[26:10] it's so so we can't just say the world
[26:11] is in chaos but man is born into that
[26:14] chaos we have this nature that we're
[26:16] born with and so unfortunately man under
[26:20] his own devices doesn't matter how
[26:21] educated it is how how cultured he may
[26:24] be he will always tend towards chaos
[26:26] because that nature's within him a man
[26:29] but God Richard mercy lujah amen and
[26:35] such like of which I've told you before
[26:37] as i have also told you in times past so
[26:40] i'm still and good to anyone
[26:41] that they which do such things shall not
[26:44] in here at the kingdom of god cause
[26:45] chaos go not in here at order you'd be
[26:47] called out of that chaos i mean but the
[26:49] fruit of the spirit is now these things
[26:51] are order love joy peace ec this list
[26:57] there's no destruction in this list its
[26:59] destruction in the first list are red
[27:01] hatreds destruction
[27:02] you know emulations fornication and
[27:05] cleanliness adultery
[27:07] you know wrath strife seditions all
[27:09] those things are towards the negative
[27:11] they had destructive so it tends toward
[27:13] that's the nature of chaos right but now
[27:16] the fruits of the spirit the the ones of
[27:20] order love see love brings together i'm
[27:23] in joy brings together a joyful heart
[27:26] doeth good like a medicine i mean peace
[27:29] brings brings together i mean long
[27:31] suffering brings together
[27:35] amen gentleness brings together it
[27:38] doesn't divide I mean goodness brings
[27:41] together you know you take the first
[27:44] list you know the fruits of the yeah you
[27:46] know you know the you know the fruits or
[27:48] the works of the flesh and if someone
[27:51] and unfortunately many poor people who
[27:53] aren't born by the Spirit of God they'll
[27:54] manifest the first list even though
[27:56] religious and the thing is you take it
[27:58] someone who's who who's very you know
[28:01] manifests although since continually I'm
[28:04] sure you'd agree you wouldn't really
[28:05] want to hang out with that person very
[28:06] much they'd be very detrimental to
[28:08] yourself because it's chaos it separates
[28:12] us divides and breaks down and destroys
[28:14] I mean but those who have love and I'm
[28:17] talking about Holy Ghost love those who
[28:19] manifest love those that manifest joy
[28:21] peace longsuffering gentleness meekness
[28:24] faith goodness temperance against such
[28:28] there is no law that is order that
[28:30] brings together that unites that heals
[28:33] that binds you know that it strengthens
[28:35] that stabilizes hallelujah and those you
[28:39] know so there's the two manifesting
[28:42] themselves so God had to call us out of
[28:44] chaos and bring us into order but the
[28:47] reason that he but the reason that he um
[28:49] he he did so the reason he brooded over
[28:52] you is because he saw there was a seed
[28:54] in you that had the men that that was an
[28:56] attribute of himself hallelujah Amen so
[29:00] there's the two so so the Apostle Peter
[29:03] had to be called out of chaos
[29:04] those are sincere men though is a good
[29:06] man any other coming to order who's
[29:10] who's following me so far and you glad
[29:13] that the Lord brought you into order
[29:14] hallelujah I mean once you're in chaos
[29:17] but now you're in order so as I see it
[29:19] now the you know the the second law of
[29:22] thermodynamics is thermodynamics is that
[29:27] everything tends towards disorder and so
[29:34] everything tends towards disorder but
[29:36] unless there's an external force is
[29:39] applied that can actually bring it back
[29:41] into order so now here our shoe man 'ti
[29:43] you see see every two thousand years the
[29:45] world falls apart because it's the
[29:48] second law of
[29:49] Amyx everything tends towards disorder
[29:52] so in Moses I mean so Noah's day the
[29:54] world was falling apart there was
[29:56] violence there was hatred there was all
[29:58] kinds of things going on people
[29:59] multiplied there was violence okay you
[30:02] know what was people going into chaos
[30:04] but brother BAM says it was the most
[30:06] scientific age so there are smart people
[30:08] though educated people but because their
[30:11] nature was fallen I mean they had to
[30:13] tend towards disorder then when Jesus
[30:15] came the world was falling into chaos
[30:17] again it was falling apart I mean but
[30:20] even as the world was falling apart
[30:22] there God called out a bride in that day
[30:24] you take you take the woman at the well
[30:26] I'm sure we can agree she was in chaos
[30:29] amen she she had she had five husbands
[30:32] the one she would she wasn't married to
[30:34] her life was a chaos but deep down in
[30:37] that chaos is a predestinated seed that
[30:40] the son of man had to come across and
[30:42] speak to when he spoke to that woman I
[30:44] mean and and and it seed became
[30:46] quickened by the life hallelujah that
[30:47] that was being spoken through that word
[30:49] I mean and her life went from chaos
[30:52] water I mean it went from darkness
[30:55] covering her and just you know
[30:56] traditions and just how she was I mean
[30:58] that light struck her then she came to
[31:00] life a man and she began to manifest
[31:03] truly what was in her from the
[31:05] foundation of the world hallelujah amen
[31:09] so here we have Jesus so so unless
[31:12] there's a so unless an external force is
[31:14] applied everything will tend towards
[31:17] disorder now we have come down to this
[31:19] day we're now 2,000 years down the road
[31:22] as as brother Bram says every 2,000
[31:24] years amen the world falls apart yeah
[31:27] and now so but down through the church
[31:30] ages God had send a messenger to the age
[31:32] and as the world is falling apart I mean
[31:35] that messengers minister actually bring
[31:37] order I mean I mean to that age but now
[31:40] we've come down to the end we've come
[31:42] down to the seventh church age there's
[31:43] no more Church ages there's no more
[31:45] messengers rather Gentile age is being
[31:47] wrapped up the world has to fall apart
[31:49] again I mean but even as the world is
[31:52] falling apart now that's when the Son of
[31:54] Man is revealed again and God calls out
[31:56] a bride from chaos into order hallelujah
[31:59] so this world is ordained to fall apart
[32:02] you know we
[32:03] you know we could go into the Book of
[32:05] Daniel and we could read about the
[32:07] fourth beast power that basically
[32:09] devours and consumes the world and and
[32:13] we see that anointing that's come down
[32:15] through the ages you know this world has
[32:17] been broken into pieces amen we know
[32:20] that there has to be you know America
[32:22] has to go bankrupt the world economic
[32:25] system has to be rewritten
[32:26] right it's been prophesied it will
[32:29] happen and look at what's happening look
[32:32] at what's happening in the world today I
[32:33] mean there's this virus has gone through
[32:36] the world people are pumping out heaps
[32:38] of money even America before the deer
[32:41] lockdown really happened they said that
[32:42] put out a stimulus of two trillion
[32:45] dollars and it's gonna go higher than
[32:47] that already and they're already in a
[32:49] massive debt that they've never been in
[32:51] before and it just keeps getting worse
[32:54] and worse and even last week you go look
[32:57] on the news it says that our Reserve
[33:00] Bank made a deal with the Federal
[33:02] Reserve in America and they borrowed
[33:03] about 60 odd billion dollars and a very
[33:06] low interest rate what's happening the
[33:09] world is in debt like never before
[33:11] that's right there has to be there has
[33:13] to be one that comes and actually
[33:15] actually actually pays off the debt and
[33:18] we know who that is by prophecy we know
[33:21] that there's the world counselor I mean
[33:23] so there's the Vatican with all the gold
[33:24] in the world
[33:25] see the rest the economic systems all
[33:27] just on on confidence that's why the
[33:29] stock market goes down when people lose
[33:31] confidence because the value goes down
[33:33] because people's confidence goes down in
[33:35] that system and so the whole monetary
[33:37] system is based on confidence so when
[33:39] the confidence goes down then the
[33:41] monetary system goes down but because
[33:43] the debt is so high and they're not and
[33:45] they're and they're afraid to actually
[33:47] just let the system crash they keep
[33:49] pumping money into it but they just get
[33:50] into a greater debt cycle it's going
[33:52] it's in chaos there's no gold standard
[33:56] against the you know who's who's ever
[33:58] looked at us just a little bit or
[33:59] studied economics in any way right
[34:01] there's nothing backing our money
[34:03] anywhere
[34:04] there's nothing backing it so now these
[34:07] kind of crises happen the world goes on
[34:09] shutdown they pump out all this money
[34:12] just create some more debt and there has
[34:15] to come to a point you look at the
[34:17] last few years America just votes in the
[34:19] Senate and they just raise their debt
[34:20] ceiling the world's busted brother Ram
[34:23] says in his day that those people are
[34:25] paying off you know your the debts they
[34:27] are making what in 40 years time they're
[34:29] still paying them off
[34:30] you know the whole system is busted and
[34:33] they're not gonna let Wall Street Crash
[34:35] I can't remember this is not about the
[34:38] little workers like us is about big
[34:40] corporations and they're not gonna let
[34:42] them crash they're not gonna let them
[34:43] fail so they something has to prop them
[34:45] up and then you see nowadays what do we
[34:48] have we have a president there who's a
[34:50] businessman he cares about business
[34:53] right and so he's the perfect tool in
[34:56] order to actually sell the whole system
[34:58] out to the Catholic Church that's right
[35:00] because they have the money but they
[35:02] have the money and the and the Wall
[35:04] Street has all the paper has all the
[35:06] bonds but those bonds begin to worth
[35:08] nothing so someone's going to come and
[35:09] pay the debt off and what happens the
[35:11] whole world of screw controlled by Rome
[35:14] the world is falling apart you know we
[35:19] have to we have to understand these
[35:20] things because sure this virus may go
[35:23] away I pray it does but the economic
[35:26] system of the world has but will be
[35:28] forever changed that's right and here we
[35:31] are born living in this chaos we're
[35:33] living in this chaos but I just want to
[35:37] make you turn your attention to two
[35:39] revelations chapter ten because as I
[35:43] said in this chaos the Lord comes into
[35:46] that chaos and makes an order when he
[35:49] comes himself Amen an order comes out of
[35:51] chaos and so if we go to revelations
[35:57] chapter 10 because whatever what a
[35:59] reason I said all that as I just want I
[36:02] pray no one is afraid of what's going on
[36:04] in the world we have nothing to fear as
[36:07] a part of God's program right it's all
[36:10] part of God's program nothing's going
[36:12] out of cater he's not panicking right
[36:15] he's not worried he knows exactly where
[36:17] you are
[36:18] Amen I remember the next thing that we
[36:22] are told we will see is the bride
[36:24] leaving this world the rapture which is
[36:27] the next thing on God's program
[36:30] remember it doesn't matter how badly the
[36:32] world falls apart the devil cannot take
[36:35] full control of the earth until the
[36:36] bride goes I mean cuz brother MCS in the
[36:39] fourth seal when the bride goes up the
[36:41] Beast comes down you know the devil
[36:43] comes fully incarnate as the Beast I
[36:45] mean so maybe let's read that scripture
[36:48] first shall this go to second
[36:49] Thessalonians you know it's amazing
[36:54] because because people can so panic all
[36:57] the devil's gonna take over the world
[36:58] and we're gonna be trapped here and you
[37:00] know we're gonna you know there may be
[37:02] for the people that go through the Great
[37:03] Tribulation but it's not the brides
[37:05] anointing it's not our lot to go through
[37:10] that tribulation this message came
[37:12] Christ Himself came in this day to give
[37:14] you a way of escape out of the room you
[37:16] know that don't you know be here when
[37:18] the Great Tribulation fully sets in so I
[37:21] mean so you know people are you know
[37:23] these people prepping and preparing for
[37:25] the Great Tribulation they believe
[37:26] they'll go through this because they're
[37:28] under the anointing to go that way I
[37:30] mean but we're not called to go under
[37:32] the sofa read here in 2nd Thessalonians
[37:35] and 2 and 7 maybe maybe licious yeah
[37:41] yeah let's just go from from verse 7 of
[37:44] 2nd Thessalonians 2 he says for the
[37:47] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[37:50] only he who now letteth will let until
[37:53] he be taken out of the way and then
[37:58] shall that wicked then shall that wicked
[38:00] be revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[38:02] with the spirit of his mouth and destroy
[38:04] with the brightness of his coming now
[38:08] this may seem like a very obscure kind
[38:10] of Scripture it says the mystery of
[38:12] iniquity doth already work only he who
[38:15] now letteth will let until he be taken
[38:17] out of the way so this one who let's
[38:19] write this is actually the Holy Ghost
[38:21] and when the Holy Ghost leaves the earth
[38:24] I mean then the devil can have full
[38:26] control on the earth you know what the
[38:28] devil still you know doesn't have free
[38:30] reign on this earth you know why we're
[38:33] here it's the same Amen it's the same
[38:35] reason why the world's falling apart
[38:36] it's your fault they're full control
[38:41] because you're upon the earth amen
[38:43] and that's why the world is falling
[38:45] apart as well because remember there's a
[38:47] second law of thermodynamics everything
[38:49] tends towards disorder but in the
[38:50] universe is only so much order there's
[38:53] only so much entropy right so something
[38:55] goes towards disorders because thing
[38:57] else is coming into order right and the
[38:59] reason the world is falling apart is
[39:01] because the bride is coming into order
[39:03] with the Word of God
[39:04] Alleluia that's why this world's falling
[39:07] apart is your fault
[39:08] all right back to brother James on the
[39:10] phone last week I said you know you're
[39:12] you're the reason this world's falling
[39:13] apart brother James it's your fault
[39:16] Allu yeah amen why because you know
[39:19] we're coming into order with the Word of
[39:21] God so now he says he will litter here
[39:24] let his will let until he be taken out
[39:26] of the way and that he is the Holy Ghost
[39:28] so when the Holy Ghost leaves the earth
[39:30] with you know that's when the devil has
[39:33] full control but at the moment he is
[39:35] actually being held back from having
[39:37] fully having his way I mean but remember
[39:41] when the Holy Ghost leaves the earth we
[39:43] go with it I mean because were one with
[39:45] him
[39:47] it means let's go to revelations chapter
[39:49] 10 and I know this is um this is this is
[39:53] I think whether when a brother Andy's
[39:56] favorite favorite scriptures but I pray
[40:00] it's also our favorite so all of our
[40:02] favorite Scripture because what I've
[40:03] been really thinking about in this time
[40:05] is you know the word we believe it
[40:07] should mean so much more to us now you
[40:10] see it to me it seems to be so more real
[40:12] I mean where where where things where we
[40:14] look at revelations 10 and you know we
[40:17] we look at the world's falling apart and
[40:19] and how brother Brown you know
[40:21] prophesied that the you know that that
[40:23] the world would go bankrupt and the and
[40:25] in the Vatican will will basically buy
[40:27] the world with the gold and we see it
[40:29] becoming material more and more every
[40:30] day so it goes from more than just a
[40:32] prophecy but we see it becoming into
[40:35] basically the maturity of its
[40:36] fulfillment and so I think you know if
[40:39] we really look at the message really
[40:41] look at the Word of God we should be ail
[40:42] to see it becoming so much more real to
[40:45] us and it shouldn't mean so much more to
[40:47] us in this thing and then even before so
[40:50] so we see in Revelation Stennis is now I
[40:52] saw another mighty angel come up come
[40:55] down from heaven clothed with the cloud
[40:57] a rainbow was upon his head and his face
[40:59] as it were the Sun and his feet as
[41:02] pillars of fire now we know this is
[41:04] Christ the mighty angel coming down to
[41:06] the earth and we know that because as
[41:08] it's a symbolic book we just look into
[41:10] the symbols we see that he was clothed
[41:12] with a cloud he sees a comeback in a
[41:14] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head we
[41:16] know a rainbow all always I'm as
[41:18] symbolic of a covenant and he is the
[41:20] angel of the Covenant and his face as it
[41:23] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[41:26] fire now we we understand that we are
[41:28] his body in this day I meant the Bride
[41:31] of Christ is the body of Christ upon the
[41:33] earth
[41:33] amen as brother Chris Merrett said you
[41:36] know we are the we have the earthly
[41:38] strength of God upon the earth as the
[41:39] bride so now if its feet as pillars of
[41:42] fire we we need to look and say well
[41:44] where does the pillar of fire reside
[41:46] today I mean we can go to the you know
[41:48] yo we can go to the day of Pentecost in
[41:50] Acts chapter 2 and the pillar fire came
[41:52] down into the upper room and separated
[41:54] himself into the believers now the
[41:56] pillar of fire was now in the church I
[41:58] mean so now God was now in his people so
[42:01] now it says that his feet were as
[42:03] pillars of fire I mean that means we are
[42:05] his feet upon the earth hallelujah I
[42:08] mean we are his remember we are his body
[42:10] upon the earth
[42:11] so this mighty angel came down through
[42:13] this message a minha now because we
[42:15] received this message and it brings us
[42:17] back to a true Pentecost because it
[42:19] brings us back to the what the Apostle
[42:21] Paul preached it takes us back to a
[42:23] proper Pentecost and a proper Pentecost
[42:25] gives us God dwelling in us again
[42:27] amen amen so now here we are now so so
[42:30] we are his feet upon the earth now it's
[42:32] very interesting to see where where
[42:34] where he stood so it's reading in in
[42:38] verse 2 and I won't be much longer and
[42:41] he had in his hand a little book open
[42:43] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[42:46] and his left foot on the earth now this
[42:50] is very important where he's standing
[42:51] because if we go to revelations chapter
[42:53] I believe it's chapter 13 we can see
[42:56] that there's two powers that come out
[42:58] come out and one power comes out of the
[43:01] sea one one one power comes out of the
[43:03] earth now we can just we just read here
[43:08] revelations 13 and one I'm not going to
[43:10] go into the symbolic
[43:11] of this but we know that this is the
[43:12] anointing on the world systems and the
[43:14] time of the end I mean so it says and I
[43:17] stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw
[43:20] a beast rise up out of the sea having
[43:23] seven heads and ten horns and upon his
[43:25] horns ten crowns and upon his heads the
[43:28] name of blasphemy now I'm just gonna
[43:30] read there but I just want you to notice
[43:32] you can go and read it later and see
[43:34] we're at Crawford cross-references into
[43:36] the Book of Daniel but he came at this
[43:38] power came out of the sea now we know
[43:40] the sea is in the book of Revelation as
[43:43] people you're multitudes of people's
[43:45] tongues and nations right mm-hmm but
[43:47] this power comes out of there so here's
[43:49] the demonic power raising up but then
[43:52] also if we continue reading down and we
[43:57] and we go to verse 11 of of revelations
[44:02] 13 and it says and I beheld another
[44:04] beast coming up out of the earth out of
[44:07] the land and he had two horns like a
[44:10] lamb and he spake as a dragon
[44:12] so here's these two powers one comes out
[44:14] of the sea one comes out of the land
[44:17] comes out of the earth but where does
[44:19] this mighty angel now stand he stands
[44:21] puts one foot on the sea and one foot on
[44:23] the earth so he pushes this demonic
[44:25] power back I mean when he comes down as
[44:28] in this form Elias and now these demons
[44:30] demonic powers are rising up but now
[44:32] this power of God comes down it actually
[44:35] pushes these powers back so now here is
[44:37] God standing upon the earth the mighty
[44:38] angel upon the earth put holding these
[44:40] forces back until the until the Covenant
[44:44] of God the will of God is now opened and
[44:46] spoken to a people right and and we've
[44:49] received that open book
[44:50] amen we become one with that which is
[44:52] Christ and now we have been given the
[44:54] power to prophesy again yeah Christ is
[44:58] upon the earth this is why I really want
[45:00] to say Christ is upon the earth holding
[45:03] back the forces of darkness until we
[45:05] come to our position yeah I see
[45:08] revelations teen eight to 11 as as our
[45:11] scripture man I mean because John is a
[45:14] symbol of us in the book you know one
[45:16] man brother BAM says one man in the and
[45:18] the vision can be symbolic of a whole
[45:21] people and we see John at the end of
[45:22] Revelations 3 your
[45:24] lessons for one and I saw a door open
[45:26] and heaven and that same voice he come
[45:28] up hither and that is a that's symbolic
[45:31] of the rapture of the church so one man
[45:32] in the vision is a symbol of a whole
[45:34] group of people and hallelujah I mean so
[45:38] now so now God is upon the earth I mean
[45:41] Jesus Christ is here I mean in in spirit
[45:44] form all that Christ was is here right
[45:47] he hasn't changed one iota but but his
[45:50] but his physical form but who he is
[45:52] everything he does is still the same I
[45:54] mean today so so he is upon the earth
[45:57] holding back these forces right until we
[46:00] come to our position and once we come to
[46:02] our position in Christ then what we got
[46:04] in the rapture Amen that's right so I
[46:08] just want to say don't worry about
[46:10] what's going on in the world
[46:12] God will hold those powers back until
[46:15] his bride comes into her position amen
[46:18] and when she is ready then he leaves the
[46:22] earth and she leaves with him amen
[46:27] so we really have nothing to fear
[46:29] friends we have absolutely nothing to
[46:31] fear remember God God you know the devil
[46:35] can't do nothing he can push he can
[46:37] shove it and try all he wants to do but
[46:39] he can't do nothing until God allows him
[46:41] to oh he desperately cuz he knows he has
[46:44] but a short time you know he desperately
[46:46] wants to take over the yoke you know the
[46:49] world and completeness but he can't do
[46:51] it because you're standing in his way
[46:54] amen you actually standing in his way
[46:56] because God's hand is upon you and God
[46:59] is bringing you to your position thank
[47:01] you all hallelujah amen so I knew glad
[47:06] you've been called out of chaos and
[47:07] brought into order
[47:09] amen thank you as this world is falling
[47:12] apart God's called a bride out of this
[47:14] chaos manifest his word in the same time
[47:18] and I think we should be we should be
[47:21] the most thankful people in all the
[47:22] world
[47:23] I mean means hearts are failing for fear
[47:26] you know the world is falling apart but
[47:30] even as the world is in this chaos God
[47:32] is calling us I mean to become one with
[47:35] him so
[47:37] take advantage of the shutdown friends
[47:39] yes amen worship the Lord bring your
[47:44] family together I won't sing pray read
[47:48] together you know just just just worship
[47:52] God but we have an opportunity you say
[47:56] I'm the only one Daniel was the only one
[47:59] hallelujah when the land of Babylon was
[48:02] the only one but he stood he had a
[48:04] testimony I mean we can be the same way
[48:07] I just want to leave you with that world
[48:11] is in chaos but God has come to bring an
[48:14] order out of that chaos he's coming to
[48:16] call a bride out into order and then so
[48:19] we can we have the same Authority we
[48:22] have the same right remember the same
[48:23] one that said let there be life there's
[48:25] the same one that's in you amen and you
[48:28] can see your family may be in chaos you
[48:32] can speak to that mountain I mean you

[48:37] Spirit of God can brood over them and
[48:38] bring them into order out of chaos I
[48:40] mean I mean god bless you friends I'm
[48:44] gonna leave it there I love you all
