[40:51] they've been
[40:53] bless you amen let's um let's turn in
[40:56] the scripture to Ephesians chapter 2 I
[41:10] mean I don't I don't have a PowerPoint
[41:13] morning do it the old-fashioned way
[41:17] Ephesians 2 and 19 they many see is now
[41:27] therefore yeah no more strangers and
[41:30] foreigners but fellow-citizens with the
[41:33] Saints and of the household of God and
[41:35] are built upon the foundation of the
[41:38] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[41:39] Himself being the chief Cornerstone and
[41:42] whom all the building fitly frame to
[41:45] give the grass and to a holy temple in
[41:47] the Lord in whom ye also are builded
[41:51] together for an habitation of God
[41:53] through the spirit but this cause i paul
[41:56] the prisoner of jesus christ for you
[41:58] gentiles if you have heard of the
[42:00] dispensation of grace of god which has
[42:02] given me to you word how that by
[42:04] revelation he made known unto me the
[42:07] mystery as I wrote a foreign few words
[42:09] whereby when you read you may understand
[42:12] my knowledge and the mystery of Christ
[42:14] which in other ages were not made known
[42:18] unto the sons of men as it was now
[42:20] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[42:22] prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[42:25] should be fellow ears and of the same
[42:27] body and partakers of his promise in
[42:29] Christ by the gospel wherefore I was
[42:32] made a minister according to the gift of
[42:34] of the grace of god given unto me by the
[42:36] effectual working of his power and to me
[42:39] who am least then the less then the
[42:43] least of All Saints is this grace given
[42:45] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[42:47] the unsearchable riches of Christ and to
[42:50] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[42:52] of the mystery which from the beginning
[42:55] of the world hath been hid in God who
[42:57] created all things by Jesus Christ to
[43:00] the intent that now unto the
[43:02] principalities and powers and heavenly
[43:04] places might be known
[43:06] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[43:08] according to the eternal purpose which
[43:11] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord
[43:15] I mean and let's go to the book of
[43:17] Judges and we're gonna read judges
[43:21] chapter 2 and verses 7 to 14 this may
[43:28] seem a bit unusual but we're gonna read
[43:34] judges to 7 to 14 and the people serve
[43:44] the Lord all the days of Joshua and all
[43:47] the days of the elders that outlived
[43:48] Joshua who had seen all the great works
[43:51] of the Lord that he did for Israel and
[43:53] Joshua the son of nun the servant of the
[43:55] Lord died being a hundred and ten years
[43:57] old and they buried him in the border of
[43:59] his inheritance and Timnath he rose in
[44:03] the mount of ephraim on the north side
[44:06] of the hill of yesh and also all that
[44:09] generation would gathered unto their
[44:11] fathers and there arose another
[44:12] generation after them which knew not the
[44:16] Lord nor yet the works which he had done
[44:19] for Israel I mean my Lord blesses word
[44:22] you may have your seats this morning now
[44:24] it's very contrasting scripture there
[44:29] but one is now I want to continue on
[44:34] from from where I was last Sunday I pray
[44:37] the Lord help me
[44:37] now we hear we read very to two
[44:40] contrasting scriptures but you know one
[44:43] was you know the Apostle Paul and I find
[44:45] when I read the book of Ephesians it's
[44:46] very hard to find a place to stop and
[44:48] start but here here he is showing that
[44:50] in times past there was there was parts
[44:54] of of God that were not made no and they
[44:56] were they were there was a position in
[44:58] Christ that was not known to the church
[44:59] but now they came a dispensation where a
[45:02] people would come back to where Adam and
[45:05] Eve was in the garden that they would
[45:06] they would dwell in their position in
[45:08] Christ that the because he says to the
[45:11] intent that the reason that the gospel
[45:12] has been ministered that these
[45:14] unsearchable riches of Christ would be
[45:15] now ministered to the church as that
[45:17] that they would know the believer would
[45:19] begin to know
[45:20] see and comprehend the principalities
[45:23] and powers and heavenly places that are
[45:25] given to the church so that means that
[45:26] the power that they that the bride has
[45:29] that the believer has would be made
[45:31] known because you know if you take any
[45:33] army if they don't know what their
[45:34] equipment can do how are they going to
[45:36] fight I mean like if America they have
[45:38] all the missiles or Russia they have all
[45:40] their muscles but if they don't know
[45:41] what they could do do you think they
[45:42] would use them do you think they could
[45:43] actually rest in the fact they have this
[45:45] weapon that could destroy the world you
[45:47] know that would they wouldn't act the
[45:48] way they do if they didn't know what it
[45:49] could do and it's the same thing with it
[45:51] that yeah you know with us we want to
[45:53] know what we have we want to know the
[45:55] position we have we don't want to just
[45:56] sit back and say well Jesus died for me
[45:59] thank you Lord and just sit back and not
[46:01] use what he gave us I mean because when
[46:03] he redeemed us it wasn't just to cleanse
[46:04] us from sin but it was two places and
[46:06] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that we
[46:08] could have authority over the devil have
[46:10] authority over this flesh I mean we
[46:12] could overcome all things so we want to
[46:14] see what we what he has made us to be I
[46:17] mean because the more you see what God
[46:19] has made you to be the more you worship
[46:20] Him because the more thankful you are
[46:22] hallelujah I mean cuz he paid a great
[46:25] price I remember that great price was
[46:27] paid that we would we would live
[46:29] according to our privilege hallelujah I
[46:32] mean in the greater the prices paid the
[46:34] greater the thing that's bought
[46:35] hallelujah amen so so but you're very
[46:40] very two contrasting scriptures so one
[46:42] the Apostle Paul is showing the church
[46:43] the dispensation of grace that he is
[46:46] ministering to them was not known in
[46:47] previous ages how the Gentiles are the
[46:50] habitation of the Spirit that that we
[46:53] would know the principalities and powers
[46:55] and heavenly places might be made known
[46:57] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[47:00] so that you would know your position in
[47:01] the Lord Jesus Christ what he has made
[47:04] you to be now this was not revealed to
[47:06] the believers before but now has to be
[47:08] made knowing right so now when something
[47:11] is is revealed is not just to give us
[47:14] something to talk about it's not just
[47:16] something you to do to debate or or you
[47:18] know you know your form an opinion
[47:20] that's not why things are revealed but
[47:23] the word is revealed in order that God's
[47:25] mind would put on flesh upon the earth
[47:27] so what God thinks it is spoken and then
[47:29] it's spoken in the right people will
[47:31] receive it and it will become manifested
[47:34] I mean so that's why it's revealed that
[47:35] it would be lived it would be manifested
[47:37] that people would not just talk about it
[47:39] or debate it but they would actually
[47:40] possess what is spoken I mean so that's
[47:43] the you know that's why Jesus died is
[47:45] that not that we would just talk about
[47:47] him dying
[47:48] I mean I'll talk about him resurrect him
[47:50] but we would possess amen the promise of
[47:52] eternal life that would be manifested in
[47:54] these mortal bodies hallelujah so so
[47:58] when something is so so so when
[48:00] something is revealed I mean it is God's
[48:02] thoughts manifested upon the earth so
[48:05] you take you take fruit now and you
[48:07] could spend week it's been forever just
[48:09] looking in the scripture you know this
[48:11] is God's mind being transmitted down
[48:14] it's what this message is it's God's
[48:16] mind being transmitted down I mean that
[48:18] we would know what he's thinking and not
[48:19] just say well now I know what the mind
[48:21] of God is but no now that mind would be
[48:23] manifested I mean as the scripture says
[48:25] that the mind that was in Christ be in
[48:27] you so if his mind is in you you'll
[48:29] operate you'll live according to the
[48:30] word I mean you won't just talk about it
[48:33] or debate it it'll be manifested
[48:35] hallelujah so amen so brother Branham
[48:39] would know so you take Isaiah yo
[48:42] prophesy about a virgin shall conceive
[48:44] and we know that that was impossible
[48:46] without God never been done before and
[48:49] and you know we don't you know prophets
[48:52] will say something and if they're really
[48:53] conscious of what they're saying they
[48:55] probably would never have seen it how's
[48:56] this gonna happen this is impossible but
[48:58] he just spoke it out and someone wrote
[49:00] it down and they believed that as I say
[49:01] at the Lord I mean so now you know you
[49:04] take so but when God when God
[49:06] prophesized something he knows exactly
[49:09] who's going to manifest their promise
[49:11] right isn't just throw it out there and
[49:13] say well maybe someone will catch it
[49:14] maybe someone will agree and you know he
[49:17] knows who's going to manifest it
[49:18] hallelujah he knows exactly the person
[49:20] the time the season when it's going to
[49:22] happen that you take when Isaiah
[49:24] prophesied a virgin shall conceive and
[49:26] and brother Bram dramatized it you know
[49:29] II so listen listen the message Jehovah
[49:33] of miracles and this is when Joseph and
[49:35] Mary are coming back from from from a
[49:37] meeting in the synagogue he seasoned at
[49:39] this point Joseph must have said do you
[49:41] realize dear how many quails that would
[49:43] have taken to feed them people speak of
[49:45] the people in the wilderness but there
[49:46] are about two and a half
[49:47] million people in the camp and each man
[49:49] could easily eat two quail or more for
[49:52] satisfying so it would take more than 5
[49:54] million quails but he's Jehovah the
[49:56] Creator amen how that he could create
[49:58] quail this probably wasn't even five
[50:01] million quail and all Palestine or all
[50:03] the wilderness but he's Jehovah God who
[50:05] can put them there and that's there's
[50:07] none there he can still create them for
[50:09] he did it in the days of Abraham on the
[50:10] mountain when Abraham called him Jehovah
[50:12] Jireh the Lord will provide anything he
[50:14] is need of then Joseph's mother must
[50:17] have said something like this that
[50:18] message was striking but I thought the
[50:20] good rabbi ruined it at the end when he
[50:22] said but it is true that Jehovah used to
[50:25] do miracles but alas Jehovah doesn't
[50:27] even do miracles today that those days
[50:29] have long past the go all Jehovah wants
[50:32] us to do is go to church pay our dues
[50:34] and just live a good life Joseph must
[50:36] have said I kind of disagree with the
[50:38] rabbi because if he is God he has to
[50:41] remain the same God if he was Jehovah
[50:43] Jireh he could provide for them he can
[50:46] provide for us all so how I could have
[50:48] holid like to have holiday mean to
[50:50] Joseph I mean I like that kind of faith
[50:52] he's still the same one hallelujah Mary
[50:54] slips back into the house and picks up a
[50:56] scroll brings it out as their usual
[50:58] Sunday afternoon Bible study and it
[51:00] happened to be this day we'd say she
[51:02] brought out the scroll of Isaiah and as
[51:04] Joseph took the scroll and opened it up
[51:06] he began to read the scroll to Mary and
[51:08] to comment finally he comes to the place
[51:10] in Isaiah nine and six Ritz hears
[51:12] something like this and to us a child is
[51:14] given unto us a son the government shall
[51:16] be upon his shoulders and his name shall
[51:18] be called counselor the Prince of Peace
[51:20] the mighty God the everlasting father
[51:22] and while he is reading he heard a sigh
[51:24] and he looked sideways and the little
[51:26] lady sweetheart of his her little face
[51:28] had flashed up and her eyes were
[51:30] glistening like the stars on a dark
[51:31] night and said read it again dear and he
[51:34] read it against you and and she must
[51:36] have said oh who has that be what was
[51:38] that prophet speaking of and he said
[51:41] something like this or would have said
[51:42] the Prophet was speaking of the Messiah
[51:45] will come and one of our woman someday
[51:47] will bear the Messiah their scripture
[51:49] seemed to grip the little version for
[51:51] she couldn't get away from it hallelujah
[51:54] and you know amen say see see that word
[51:56] was was there sitting in the scrolls for
[51:59] 800 years but then finally the pre
[52:01] later one I mean that was part of the
[52:03] promise heard that word and you know
[52:06] many other woman would have heard that
[52:08] scripture many other would have seen
[52:09] it's going to be me but once came upon
[52:12] the earth or it wasn't just it's gonna
[52:13] be me it was her hallelujah and gripped
[52:16] her I mean like not a scripture didn't
[52:18] and I pray to God that the word this
[52:20] prophesied of today I mean of a body
[52:22] change of a rapture I'm it would grip us
[52:25] like never before
[52:26] I mean it will become more than our
[52:27] everyday food everybody comes to our
[52:29] live to us more than just a nice promise
[52:31] or more than a nice idea but grip our
[52:34] lives Holly it becomes so real or God
[52:36] that's for me I mean not because not
[52:39] because I may say it or brother Brahm
[52:40] Caesar or you read in the scripture but
[52:42] God comes and behind as his that
[52:44] scriptures for you hallelujah encrypter
[52:48] and it could never get why because God
[52:50] had revealed it to her the rapture is a
[52:52] revelation I mean it's a revelation to
[52:56] you it's got to be made alive to you I
[52:58] mean when it becomes alive to you your
[53:00] whole life will be different I'm going
[53:03] home I'm going home there is nothing
[53:05] holding me here hallelujah glory to God
[53:09] amen
[53:11] now the Apostle Paul would say in
[53:14] Ephesians three I'm going to come back
[53:15] to judges we're just going to go this
[53:16] way a bit but that's cause there's
[53:19] Ephesians 3 and 14 the cause of what is
[53:22] so so for this cause what's the cause we
[53:25] worried about the cause of what is being
[53:27] revealed in this dispensation of grace I
[53:28] bow my knees into the father of our Lord
[53:30] Jesus Christ
[53:31] I've whom the whole family in heaven and
[53:33] earth is named that he may grant you
[53:36] according to the riches of his glory to
[53:37] be strengthened with the might by his
[53:39] spirit in the inner man that Christ may
[53:41] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[53:44] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[53:47] able to comprehend
[53:48] now that would comprehend means to take
[53:50] eagerly to cease to possess to apprehend
[53:53] to perceive it's not just a mental
[53:55] comprehension actually to possess what
[53:57] is being given a mentor sees it to lay
[54:00] hands upon it I mean to to to apprehend
[54:02] it Palu you that you me able to take
[54:06] eagerly to cease possess with all saints
[54:09] what is the breadth and length and depth
[54:12] and height and to know the love of God
[54:14] which passes
[54:15] knowledge that ye may be filled with all
[54:17] the fullness of God so the Apostle Paul
[54:19] is not just saying you know a little bit
[54:21] about it that you won't just have a
[54:23] shallow kind of religion you'll know the
[54:25] depths the heights the breadth the
[54:26] length I mean we're in four dimensions
[54:28] hallelujah I mean that you'll know all
[54:30] these things the fullness of God
[54:31] everything that he is that you'll see
[54:33] that you'll possess it
[54:34] I mean it's more than just being
[54:36] justified you'll be sanctified as well I
[54:38] mean you'll be filled with the Holy
[54:39] Ghost you'll possess the fullness the
[54:41] inheritance in Christ you will not
[54:43] someone else you will I mean you'll
[54:45] possess the fullness of the promise of
[54:46] this day hallelujah that's why the
[54:49] Spirit has come that's why we're the
[54:51] habitation of the Spirit hallelujah it's
[54:53] more than just knowing about it but you
[54:55] really possess it amen
[54:58] so notice the breadth the length the
[55:01] depth and the height every dimension
[55:02] every part of the scripture I'll say
[55:04] this if the word is not exciting you
[55:07] something else is exciting you you
[55:10] should the word the rapture is for the
[55:12] rapture the rapture is for those who are
[55:13] caught up in him this is a love affair
[55:16] yeah between you and the Lord Jesus
[55:18] that's a love affair it's not a working
[55:20] relationship but you're never here
[55:22] comment should never get stale that
[55:23] should get richer greater more wonderful
[55:25] should mean he should mean more to you
[55:27] now than he did yesterday I mean he you
[55:29] should love for more now than you did
[55:30] yesterday his word should be more alive
[55:32] more rich more wonderful every day why
[55:35] because it's a love relationship I mean
[55:38] it's not a the honeymoon continues on
[55:40] yes I mean you know what we're here for
[55:42] we're here to break the cycle of revival
[55:44] and death I mean the bride is here upon
[55:47] the earth now that the cycle of revival
[55:50] and death would be broken that we
[55:52] wouldn't just have one generation coming
[55:54] and have amazing testimonies and God
[55:56] would live and in the next generation we
[55:57] just become formal and just well say
[55:59] might my parents had or had an
[56:01] experience and now I'm just here no that
[56:03] wouldn't be that way
[56:04] it would just be revival than the next
[56:06] generation revival the next generation
[56:07] revival I mean because now we're going
[56:10] into a season where it's not a cycle of
[56:12] revival and if that cycle must come to
[56:15] an end and we are and and and you should
[56:18] say in your soul Lord Here I am use me
[56:22] manifest that breaking of the cycle in
[56:24] my life hallelujah that's why we're here

[1:04:35] thee in the fire I'll be with thee on
[1:04:37] the mountain I'll be with you in the
[1:04:38] valley I'll be with you through the very
[1:04:40] tight places holy but I'll be with thee
[1:04:42] I'm in gonna have confidence that he'll
[1:04:45] lead you through hallelujah now notice
[1:04:48] notice when when when Eve was taken out
[1:04:51] of Adam it was Adam that told her who
[1:04:54] she was I mean she didn't have to work
[1:04:56] it out herself he came to her and
[1:04:57] revealed it I mean so so the rib was
[1:05:00] taken out you know the Lord God took it
[1:05:02] out of the man he made the woman and
[1:05:03] brought her unto the man and then Adam
[1:05:05] said to her this is bone of my bones
[1:05:07] flesh of my flesh she shall be called
[1:05:09] woman because she was taken out of man
[1:05:12] hallelujah now we know that this is a
[1:05:14] type of the Seventh Seal where where a
[1:05:16] man and a woman are living in Dominion
[1:05:18] and in the garden I mean so now we under
[1:05:22] the true seventh seal are now being
[1:05:23] restored
[1:05:24] god I mean back to having dominion upon
[1:05:26] the earth again I mean to go into a
[1:05:28] millennium right that's why the Devils
[1:05:30] under our feet I mean because the Lord
[1:05:32] has lifted us up into heavenly places
[1:05:34] I mean of the devil and his works are
[1:05:35] under our feet I mean he has restored as
[1:05:37] Jesus was the second Adam amen
[1:05:40] so the bride in this day is the second
[1:05:42] Eve it's the man and the woman being
[1:05:43] restored to go back into the garden
[1:05:45] hallelujah amen so now notice notice
[1:05:49] though Adam told the woman because she
[1:05:51] wasn't called Eve before the fall
[1:05:53] because she is part of him right that
[1:05:54] cult yeah they're both called Adam right
[1:05:56] but he came to her and said you are bone
[1:05:59] of my bone flesh of my flesh she didn't
[1:06:01] work it out she didn't say well am i
[1:06:04] part of you and how's this work no no he
[1:06:05] came to her
[1:06:06] amen to tell her who she was and it's
[1:06:09] the same thing today the Lord this
[1:06:11] message has come to you I mean that you
[1:06:13] would understand you're not just here I
[1:06:15] mean to to go through life and have a
[1:06:18] kind of religion no it's not that at all
[1:06:20] this message has come that you would
[1:06:21] know you're part of him a man as he is
[1:06:23] the word so the bride is part of the
[1:06:25] word hallelujah glory to God I mean
[1:06:29] we're not a separate part here that's
[1:06:30] why you've got to look into the
[1:06:31] scripture why did why did Jesus walk
[1:06:34] with a torn the way to Emmaus here they
[1:06:36] were the ministry had had hold
[1:06:39] themselves up somewhere the one they
[1:06:40] believed that was was the Messiah was
[1:06:42] dead the treasure of the church Judas
[1:06:44] had just hung himself their whole world
[1:06:45] had fallen apart and they're living in
[1:06:48] the time of the resurrection the
[1:06:49] greatest week in history brother a seed
[1:06:52] and they walk here long said think of it
[1:06:54] the whole world just fell apart they had
[1:06:56] to forsake all to follow this man from
[1:06:58] Nazareth it wasn't just I'll leave this
[1:07:00] church go to this church nothing will
[1:07:01] happen no everyone knew that they
[1:07:03] forsook they had to furs they had to go
[1:07:05] beyond the pressure of the synagogue
[1:07:07] there to go beyond the pressure of the
[1:07:08] high priest and follow this Jesus of
[1:07:10] Nazareth he wasn't well thought of he
[1:07:13] wasn't you know the who's who he was a
[1:07:15] renegade he was Beelzebub they said they
[1:07:18] had been willing to follow him now he
[1:07:20] had died and the whole world fell apart
[1:07:22] but then living a time of resurrection
[1:07:24] and it wasn't just the resurrection of
[1:07:26] the Messiah but there were people that
[1:07:29] were going to be resurrected as well
[1:07:30] there are gonna be quickened from death
[1:07:32] to life so here comes here comes Jesus
[1:07:34] on the way you know with him on the way
[1:07:35] to Emmaus he begins to reveal prophecy
[1:07:38] about himself and what he's fulfilling
[1:07:40] why cuz they're gonna know the height
[1:07:42] the depth the breadth or the length of
[1:07:43] the promise hallelujah and so here he is
[1:07:46] opening the word to them and it's
[1:07:48] burning within their hearts and then
[1:07:49] finally they come into the house and he
[1:07:52] does and he does something that he did
[1:07:54] before he died he does the same thing
[1:07:56] today hallelujah breaks the bread and
[1:07:59] they and their eyes come open it's you
[1:08:01] it's it's Messiah then he disappeared
[1:08:03] why did he do that because he wanted
[1:08:05] them to see that they are part of that
[1:08:07] resurrection hallelujah that's why he
[1:08:10] walked with a nets way up in the
[1:08:12] scripture that they would know they are
[1:08:13] part of the promise they're part of the
[1:08:15] prophecy hallelujah and it's the same
[1:08:18] thing today why does he walk among us
[1:08:20] why did he do the sign of the Messiah in
[1:08:22] this day what he did before he was
[1:08:24] crucified he did it get in this day that
[1:08:26] we'd see Jesus Christ is alive today why
[1:08:28] did he do it why is he open his word to
[1:08:30] you because to show you you're part of
[1:08:31] the resurrection you're part of the
[1:08:33] rapture you're part of the prophecy
[1:08:35] you're part of this book hallelujah just
[1:08:39] as Moses came out of the scripture John
[1:08:41] the Baptist Isaiah Jeremiah the prophets
[1:08:43] the woman at the well they all came out
[1:08:45] of the scripture I mean just as they did
[1:08:47] so did you hallelujah amen amen the
[1:08:52] Apostle pulls in the scripture he was
[1:08:54] prophesied of he said I'll be a light to
[1:08:56] the Gentiles wholly he came out of the
[1:08:59] scripture he has prophesied of he has
[1:09:00] spoken of is the same thing with this
[1:09:02] word speaks of you and here you are
[1:09:05] hallelujah amen I trust you look at
[1:09:09] yourself a bit different we're not at
[1:09:11] rotten down scraping by oh kind of
[1:09:13] people know we're here to manifest the
[1:09:15] Word of God
[1:09:15] I mean we're part of the scripture I
[1:09:17] mean that lives today hallelujah
[1:09:20] so Amy now now the other Scripture we
[1:09:28] read about from judges chose the
[1:09:32] beginning of the recital of revival and
[1:09:34] death that rear what that was a
[1:09:37] reoccurring event through the book of
[1:09:38] Judges and then just reoccur there when
[1:09:41] or it goes all the way down through the
[1:09:42] scripture into the new testament era
[1:09:45] until today now but notice in judges
[1:09:48] they had the tabernacle they had the
[1:09:51] mercy
[1:09:51] see they had the priesthood that the
[1:09:54] high priest said the sacrifices they had
[1:09:55] the feasts they even had a written
[1:09:57] record of what the Lord had done for
[1:09:59] them in the past but their generation
[1:10:02] did not know the one that gave them
[1:10:04] those things and even the purpose for
[1:10:06] them so they didn't they didn't fold up
[1:10:08] the tabernacle and put away in storage
[1:10:09] they didn't cover up the ark and put it
[1:10:12] away in storage you know take the
[1:10:13] priests garments off the priests and put
[1:10:14] it away and stop you know there was
[1:10:16] still there they you know there was a
[1:10:19] tabernacle they had everything but they
[1:10:21] didn't know the Lord that gave at them
[1:10:23] amen and so maybe maybe just just let me
[1:10:27] repeat that they had Church order how
[1:10:29] ministry should be important times of
[1:10:31] the year how they should dress how to
[1:10:32] worship they even had a written record
[1:10:35] an audio record a video record of what
[1:10:38] God had done for them in the past but
[1:10:40] that generation did not know the one
[1:10:42] that gave them those things even the
[1:10:43] purpose for them amen now I read that I
[1:10:47] thought Lord no I don't want to see this
[1:10:52] today I mean that that we can have
[1:10:55] church we can go through the motion and
[1:10:56] we can know how to dress and act and
[1:10:58] whatever whatever whatever but not know
[1:10:59] him
[1:11:00] just like them there must come a time
[1:11:02] where the cycle is broken where we don't
[1:11:05] just have a church or a message culture
[1:11:07] and people conform to how people should
[1:11:09] be but they are transformed by the
[1:11:11] renewing of their mind they meet God for
[1:11:13] themselves I mean that the god of their
[1:11:14] fathers becomes a God their God only you
[1:11:18] know why did why did why did God call
[1:11:20] Israel out why did he give them the
[1:11:22] tabernacle is here so I can walk among
[1:11:24] you he wanted to have us have his family
[1:11:26] around him that was the purpose it
[1:11:29] wasn't just for them to follow a bunch
[1:11:30] of rules and do's and don'ts or what no
[1:11:32] God wanted his children close
[1:11:34] he wanted his family close to him that's
[1:11:36] why it was there
[1:11:37] that was the purpose holy Ana and if I
[1:11:39] only caught the purpose of it is that
[1:11:41] they Almighty God that created all
[1:11:43] things would walk among them holy that
[1:11:45] they would look well in safety and peace
[1:11:47] under their vineyard and God would be
[1:11:48] there and they'd say you know cuz they
[1:11:50] couldn't no other nation could say let's
[1:11:53] go worship the Creator
[1:11:54] let's go worship the one that gave us
[1:11:56] life nikka let's go worship the Chern
[1:11:59] Living God let's go prices name let's go
[1:12:01] hear his word no other nation could do
[1:12:03] it they had their idols they had their
[1:12:05] what
[1:12:05] they did I mean didn't matter how real
[1:12:07] it was it wasn't the true and living God
[1:12:09] but they could say let's go worship Him
[1:12:11] hallelujah glory to God and it should be
[1:12:14] the same thing with us
[1:12:15] let's go worship the Creator let's go
[1:12:18] worship the one that died for us on
[1:12:19] Calvary they shall worship the one that
[1:12:21] gives eternal life let's go spend time
[1:12:23] with him he doesn't know he just doesn't
[1:12:25] want to walk among us he wants to be in
[1:12:27] us holy not just to be with you but in
[1:12:29] you to the end of the world
[1:12:31] hallelujah - why this message come that
[1:12:34] Christ would dwell in us and not just a
[1:12:37] little bit but in his fullness it's full
[1:12:39] every fiber of our being that wouldn't
[1:12:41] just be just justified by faith or just
[1:12:43] sanctified but filled with the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost more than just being anointed our
[1:12:47] spreads we come and dwell in our souls I
[1:12:49] mean that it would be no longer we that
[1:12:51] live that his character is now our
[1:12:54] character hallelujah amen we're going to
[1:12:58] look at the purpose of it what is the
[1:13:01] purpose of church that God would come
[1:13:02] down I mean the window fellowship way of
[1:13:05] communion with him that he would come
[1:13:07] and meet with us and change us and molas
[1:13:09] and shape us I mean that's the purpose
[1:13:11] of church holy what's the purpose of
[1:13:13] having family altar that God would come
[1:13:15] down hallelujah hallelujah that the holy
[1:13:18] spirit would be present in the house I
[1:13:20] mean there you would know that he's
[1:13:22] alive amen
[1:13:23] what that's the purpose of this message
[1:13:25] that God would come down that Jesus
[1:13:26] would step out of history I'm so glad
[1:13:28] he's not a god of history Paulie I'm so
[1:13:31] glad he's not a God that died in 1965 or
[1:13:33] somewhere and or yesterday yesterday no
[1:13:35] today hallelujah
[1:13:37] I'm glad he's alive today I'm so glad we
[1:13:40] can feel his presence Amen doesn't
[1:13:42] matter if we all sing out of tune out of
[1:13:43] key out of whatever God comes down
[1:13:45] probably they can walk with you manifest
[1:13:48] himself to you I'm so glad it's that way
[1:13:51] I'm so glad we serve a God of reality
[1:13:54] hallelujah hallelujah and it's for you
[1:13:59] that's for all of you hallelujah amen
[1:14:04] now this word it says he they knew him
[1:14:08] not it means they didn't see him they
[1:14:13] didn't recognize them they were not
[1:14:15] acquainted with him there's few of the
[1:14:16] definitions so they didn't really see
[1:14:18] him
[1:14:19] they had their natural eyes but
[1:14:20] spiritual eyes they didn't see him they
[1:14:22] didn't recognize his presence as many do
[1:14:24] not recognize his presence today they
[1:14:26] weren't acquainted with them they never
[1:14:27] relationship sure they had a
[1:14:29] relationship with maybe the feasts and
[1:14:31] the forms and the worship but no the God
[1:14:32] that gave them yeah I need that thank
[1:14:35] you I'm looking down there's no water
[1:14:39] thanks buddy he'd appreciate it I mean
[1:14:42] so they didn't they weren't acquainted
[1:14:45] with him I thought that's the biggest
[1:14:47] robbery the biggest robbery that anyone
[1:14:51] could ever have is be among the
[1:14:53] believers but not know him I mean cuz to
[1:14:57] know him is life I mean to know him as
[1:15:01] life and when the Spirit of Truth has
[1:15:03] come he'll lead you and guide you into
[1:15:04] all truth he will lead you and while
[1:15:06] it's not a collective thing it's an
[1:15:08] individual walk I mean he will lead you
[1:15:10] and guide you into all truth I mean to
[1:15:12] win to him so when you hear messages
[1:15:14] about the seals and trumpets and
[1:15:16] whatever more it's a reality and you see
[1:15:18] him hallelujah I mean when I first heard
[1:15:21] the seals I saw horse-riders tribulation
[1:15:24] whatever more second time I just saw
[1:15:25] Christ I still the lamb with the book it
[1:15:28] was open I saw the Redeemer stepped
[1:15:30] forth to claim me hallelujah amen
[1:15:35] now Peter would say in 2nd Peter 1 he
[1:15:38] says for so an entrance shall be
[1:15:40] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:15:41] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[1:15:43] Savior Jesus Christ whereby I'll not be
[1:15:46] negligent to put you always in
[1:15:48] remembrance of these things and though
[1:15:49] you know them and be established in the
[1:15:51] present truth yeah I think it meet as
[1:15:54] long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir
[1:15:56] you up by the pudding putting you in
[1:15:58] remembrance amen knowing that shortly I
[1:16:01] must put off this my tabernacle even as
[1:16:04] our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me more
[1:16:06] ever I will endeavor that you may be
[1:16:08] able after my decrease to have these
[1:16:10] things always in remembrance I mean for
[1:16:12] we are not followed cunningly devised
[1:16:15] fables when we made known unto you the
[1:16:18] power and the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:19] Christ but will witnesses of His Majesty
[1:16:22] know before he received from God the
[1:16:25] Father honor and glory when there came
[1:16:27] such a voice to him from the excellent
[1:16:29] glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:16:32] well pleased
[1:16:33] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:16:35] heard when we were with them in the Holy
[1:16:37] Mount we also we have also a more sure
[1:16:40] word of prophecy whereunto you do well
[1:16:43] that you take heed as unto a light that
[1:16:46] shyness in a dark place until the day
[1:16:48] dawn and the day star arise in your
[1:16:51] heart so a new day dawns a day star is
[1:16:53] Christ himself arising in your hearts
[1:16:54] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:16:56] the scripture is of any private
[1:16:58] interpretation why is it not a prior
[1:17:00] private interpretation for the prophecy
[1:17:03] came not in old time by the will of man
[1:17:05] but the holy men of God spake as are
[1:17:07] moved by the Holy Ghost that's why it's
[1:17:09] not a private interpretation because it
[1:17:11] wasn't them bringing the word it was God
[1:17:12] moving upon them bringing the world a
[1:17:14] man that's why it's not of any private
[1:17:16] interpretation now brother Brown says
[1:17:18] and take on the whole armour of God he
[1:17:20] says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:17:21] flood that yo God raise up a standin he
[1:17:24] says but God doesn't have to do anything
[1:17:26] more to his make it any more appealing
[1:17:28] the only thing he has to do is raise up
[1:17:30] of his own word against the enemy the
[1:17:32] Bible said when the enemy comes in like
[1:17:34] a flood the Spirit of God raises a
[1:17:36] standard against it what does he do he
[1:17:38] makes the word that he's already said
[1:17:40] more positive and taking his same word
[1:17:43] he just makes it more positive now what
[1:17:47] does that mean now he's not saying so so
[1:17:51] he's not saying it's um he makes it more
[1:17:53] greater than initially was that's not
[1:17:55] what he means because God's Word cannot
[1:17:57] change but an order for it to become
[1:17:59] more positive you know if you look at
[1:18:01] the definition of positive one of them
[1:18:03] it means two it's consisting in or
[1:18:06] characterized by the presence rather
[1:18:09] than the absence of distinguishing
[1:18:11] features so to make it more positive
[1:18:13] Amen it's actually showing the
[1:18:16] distinguishing features of the word of
[1:18:18] present so it's not taking away saying
[1:18:20] they're not there he's saying they are
[1:18:22] there hallelujah so if you're saying
[1:18:24] that the word becomes more positive
[1:18:25] that's how it raised up a standard he
[1:18:27] says the distinguishing features of the
[1:18:29] word are there hallelujah so what are
[1:18:31] the distinction features of the word
[1:18:33] Amen he's mighty too safe hallelujah
[1:18:36] he's made it a hill
[1:18:37] I mean he's present to deliver he's here
[1:18:40] to give peace he's here to be our banner
[1:18:42] our fortress our strength our strong
[1:18:44] tower amen to be our guide to
[1:18:46] be our refuge how their to be our healer
[1:18:48] to be a deliverer those are
[1:18:50] distinguishing features of the word I
[1:18:52] meant to show I mean to show what the
[1:18:54] devil's works are and then and they are
[1:18:56] cast away I remember us to show that
[1:18:58] Christ is present and because he is his
[1:19:01] word I mean if you have Jehovah Rapha
[1:19:03] you know you have to have all the
[1:19:05] attributes of God I mean because here
[1:19:08] because if he is praising or veneers as
[1:19:10] present I mean he doesn't just come half
[1:19:12] him come he's all here hallelujah amen
[1:19:17] so his distinguishing features are
[1:19:19] present that's how he makes the word
[1:19:20] more positive hallelujah he brings you
[1:19:23] to the realization that's how I raised
[1:19:25] up the standard he opened your spiritual
[1:19:27] eyes that you would really recognize he
[1:19:29] is here I mean it's like Elijah you know
[1:19:32] speaking to to his servant you're the
[1:19:34] Syrians are around the city amen and and
[1:19:37] and the server gets panicky look we're
[1:19:38] in trouble we're surrounded how we gonna
[1:19:40] get out of this one and then Elijah just
[1:19:42] praise Lord open up his eyes he didn't
[1:19:45] know that though there he just believed
[1:19:46] out there and then the servant was more
[1:19:48] shocked with the armies of heaven around
[1:19:49] them than he was the enemy on the on the
[1:19:52] field they meant so should be the same
[1:19:53] thing with us holy it doesn't matter
[1:19:55] what the enemy's doing in the physical
[1:19:56] I'm in the armies of heaven and kept
[1:19:58] about those hallelujah snot just we're
[1:20:01] not in this fight ourselves hallelujah
[1:20:04] amen so so what did what did it happen
[1:20:07] God made his promise more positive his
[1:20:11] word more positive hallelujah amen
[1:20:16] now he says this this is an where is it
[1:20:23] doesn't count down he says now somebody
[1:20:27] now now pray for somebody or do
[1:20:30] something here here is what pops in your
[1:20:33] heart right now is speaking to someone
[1:20:34] now here is what's in your heart you've
[1:20:36] got two brothers that you're praying for
[1:20:37] they're both alcoholics if that's right
[1:20:39] raise up your hands now this is the
[1:20:41] brief show that Jesus Christ is here
[1:20:42] alright see there you are see there it's
[1:20:45] sharper than two aegis sword a discerner
[1:20:47] of the thoughts and tints of the heart
[1:20:48] he says don't don't you see it friends
[1:20:51] we've passed speaking tongues here in
[1:20:53] the astronaut age here is now we still
[1:20:55] believe in speaking tongues we know that
[1:20:57] amen but we've gone beyond now here is a

[1:24:41] Barabbas saw someone taking our place he
[1:24:44] was wounded for our transgressions
[1:24:45] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:24:47] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:24:49] and with His stripes we I was healed you
[1:24:52] were healed I wonder if we the guilty
[1:24:53] ones who should be sick and see him in
[1:24:57] our deliverance we who should go to hell
[1:24:59] see him and see him in your freedom
[1:25:01] you'll pass to heaven wonder if you
[1:25:03] could see what Barabbas saw that day he
[1:25:06] said a little while the world save me no
[1:25:08] more but you shall see me he says Oh
[1:25:10] Church then if he said you shall see me
[1:25:12] that's a proof that you can look again
[1:25:13] and then you'll see me probably with you
[1:25:16] even and you to the end of the world I
[1:25:17] mean when when will you see him at the
[1:25:19] word he is the word look at the word and
[1:25:22] see what the promises please the same
[1:25:24] yesterday today and forever what he was
[1:25:26] then when he
[1:25:27] think galley is the same thing he is
[1:25:28] tonight in Jeffersonville I'll say the
[1:25:30] same thing today here in Stokes rally
[1:25:31] the same thing he was as that Bradham
[1:25:34] Tabernacle what you what do you look to
[1:25:37] see a founder adult a denominational man
[1:25:39] you'll never see it in Jesus what do you
[1:25:41] see when you do you look to see some
[1:25:44] great priestly man you'll never see it
[1:25:46] in Jesus no sir how do you see Jesus by
[1:25:49] the Word of God being made manifest
[1:25:50] because he was the manifested Word of
[1:25:53] God what he was then he is tonight and
[1:25:55] will be forever I mean she can still
[1:25:58] look you can still see him you can still
[1:26:00] know him he says because a little while
[1:26:01] the world sees me no more but you shall
[1:26:03] see me but depends what you're looking
[1:26:05] at how'll it depends also what you're
[1:26:07] looking for
[1:26:08] amen the scribes and Pharisees we're
[1:26:10] looking for the wrong kind of Messiah
[1:26:11] and they missed him when he came I'll
[1:26:13] leave but the woman the wellses we know
[1:26:15] when Messiah cometh he'll do these
[1:26:16] things and she meet Messiah
[1:26:18] hallelujah beacons still look into his
[1:26:20] word and see him today just as alive as
[1:26:22] he was than he is now hallelujah now the
[1:26:27] Jesus would would be would rebuke the
[1:26:30] scribes and Pharisees he says you tithe
[1:26:33] and mint and anise and cummin and have
[1:26:35] admitted the weightier matters of the
[1:26:37] law so they were which our judgment
[1:26:41] mercy and faith these things you ought
[1:26:43] to have done and not leave the other
[1:26:45] undone he's saying that you've actually
[1:26:48] left off the most important part amen
[1:26:52] I mean this is how so you know it's like
[1:26:55] those in the days of judges they didn't
[1:26:56] know the Lord
[1:26:57] they had a form they they worship the yo
[1:26:59] they they had a tabernacle they had all
[1:27:01] those things but they did not know him
[1:27:03] and look at the scribes and Pharisees
[1:27:06] they were doing all these outward
[1:27:07] physical things but they really missed
[1:27:08] the true essence of the law they they
[1:27:11] missed the weightier matters now the way
[1:27:13] to you matters means the more burdensome
[1:27:14] things the more important yeah more
[1:27:16] important things they had they they had
[1:27:20] actually omitted them and term it means
[1:27:22] to forsake to lay aside to leave to
[1:27:24] yield up to actually yield up means to
[1:27:26] surrender it we don't want to surrender
[1:27:29] up the way to you matters Amen judgment
[1:27:32] mercy and faith parley we don't want to
[1:27:34] you know we don't want to forsake them
[1:27:36] laid them aside we want to lay hold upon
[1:27:39] them hallelujah
[1:27:41] amen not judgment husband of course we
[1:27:47] know means means by extension so so it's
[1:27:49] a it's a it's a judgment as for or
[1:27:54] against right it's by extension a
[1:27:57] tribunal by implication justice like
[1:28:00] divine law I mean so we have to wait
[1:28:03] there we don't want to admit judgment
[1:28:05] because many times to us
[1:28:06] people use the word judgment they always
[1:28:08] look at the negative side I mean but
[1:28:10] judgment is also a very positive thing I
[1:28:12] mean because he because when the woman
[1:28:14] was taken in adultery in the very act
[1:28:17] and brought before Jesus she judged her
[1:28:19] righteous hallelujah so so here the
[1:28:22] scribes and Pharisees who believed in
[1:28:24] the law actually brought her before the
[1:28:26] one who gave the law who was made flesh
[1:28:27] and now the law was going to judge her
[1:28:30] hallelujah remember the Lord didn't
[1:28:33] judge her as as as condemned the law
[1:28:35] actually judge her as righteous because
[1:28:37] she said because because he began to
[1:28:39] right in the right in the sand or the
[1:28:41] accusers he said them without sin let
[1:28:44] him cast the first stone and from the
[1:28:45] oldest to the youngest they dropped
[1:28:47] their stones and they left and then said
[1:28:48] now he looked up and says woman were
[1:28:50] like us where are thy accusers and she
[1:28:53] said I have none Lord
[1:28:54] so her attitude was not you know the
[1:28:57] yard to her he was not just a man a
[1:29:00] prophet Lord means Supreme One amen they
[1:29:03] have all gone my god they've gone and
[1:29:05] then now the one who gave the law says
[1:29:07] neither do i condemn they go and sin no
[1:29:09] more so don't write so you're free to go
[1:29:12] just don't go do it again
[1:29:13] so she was judged amen all the charges
[1:29:17] were dropped
[1:29:17] Jesus dropped the charges hallelujah
[1:29:20] that's the same thing with us amen he
[1:29:22] judges us righteous because we believe
[1:29:25] his word how they just like Abraham it
[1:29:27] was imputed to them for righteousness
[1:29:29] because he believed the word that's why
[1:29:31] he was righteous not because who he was
[1:29:32] as a man but because he believed the
[1:29:34] word God declared him righteous
[1:29:37] hallelujah hello righteous one tell you
[1:29:40] today I mean we wrestle about the things
[1:29:43] we do I mean but it's our faith that God
[1:29:44] sees man sees how it works for God sees
[1:29:47] our faith hallelujah and God gives you
[1:29:49] the faith anyway to believe
[1:29:51] hallelujah hey man praise the Lord mercy
[1:29:55] compassion amen we know faith is
[1:29:57] revelation amen those Caesar three
[1:30:01] things are very important now but the
[1:30:03] thing is we have to we have a battle and
[1:30:08] now I'm just going to kind of close on
[1:30:09] this but we have a battle when we look
[1:30:13] at ourselves and I said that now God is
[1:30:16] called God is calling a bride we know
[1:30:18] through seven Church ages she's been
[1:30:20] called but now it now God comes to the
[1:30:22] climax of his manifestation man and
[1:30:24] woman manifested as one hallelujah but
[1:30:29] then now the thing is our battlers is
[1:30:32] how we how we view where he's
[1:30:35] manifesting his word now Isaiah would
[1:30:40] would would prophesy also of of our Lord
[1:30:45] and and and his ministry in Isaiah 53
[1:30:48] says who has believed our report and to
[1:30:50] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed but
[1:30:53] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[1:30:54] plant and out of a root out of dry
[1:30:56] ground he has no form nor comeliness
[1:31:00] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[1:31:03] that we should desire him so now this is
[1:31:05] the judgment of the people upon the form
[1:31:07] that God took to manifest Redemption you
[1:31:09] think about here was here was the one
[1:31:11] who who could take away the sins of the
[1:31:13] world as a man here was God's manner
[1:31:16] God's salvation manifested that's why
[1:31:18] it's called Jesus Jehovah salvation was
[1:31:21] now being was now being manifested upon
[1:31:22] the earth and he didn't come in a form
[1:31:24] that was amazing he didn't look like a
[1:31:26] king he didn't he wasn't tall but
[1:31:28] shoulders look like he should have a
[1:31:29] crown on his head he didn't he didn't
[1:31:31] put on that form so now here we says he
[1:31:33] had no form nor comeliness then when we
[1:31:36] shall see him there's no beauty that we
[1:31:37] should desire him now that word camel
[1:31:39] enos means magnificence so he didn't he
[1:31:41] didn't have a form or magnificence that
[1:31:44] when we see him and there's no beauty
[1:31:46] that we should desire him so there was
[1:31:47] nothing of us physical um you know self
[1:31:50] that that was wow this is the Messiah
[1:31:52] this must be him you know you know it's
[1:31:54] not like the children's Bibles where
[1:31:56] Jesus as his blond blond haired white
[1:32:00] robes and he looks very different Devo
[1:32:02] announced he looked exactly the same as
[1:32:03] everyone else I mean you could have we
[1:32:06] could have been wandering through
[1:32:06] Jerusalem and he could have walked past
[1:32:08] and women
[1:32:09] you would never have seen him cuz he
[1:32:11] looked like everyone else
[1:32:12] hallelujah so why do you say hallelujah
[1:32:16] because it's more than what you see with
[1:32:17] your eyes that makes you catch who he is
[1:32:19] that's the same thing today
[1:32:21] I mean see there's no outward appearance
[1:32:23] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[1:32:25] of sorrows and antiquated with grief so
[1:32:28] he knew grief very well this is where
[1:32:29] God's manifesting his salvation and we
[1:32:32] hid as it was our faces from him and he
[1:32:35] is despised and we esteemed him not
[1:32:38] now the word esteem means to think or
[1:32:40] regard or value so we didn't think about
[1:32:43] him in a great way we didn't regard him
[1:32:44] in a great way we did not value him in a
[1:32:46] great way we esteemed him not
[1:32:48] I mean surely he has borne our griefs
[1:32:51] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[1:32:54] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[1:32:57] afflicted I mean so we regarded him as
[1:33:00] stricken we valued him as stricken we
[1:33:02] thought of him as stricken amen
[1:33:04] but he was wounded for our
[1:33:05] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:33:07] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:33:09] was upon him and with His stripes we
[1:33:11] were healed but we are like sheep have
[1:33:13] gone astray I mean we have turned
[1:33:16] everyone to his own way and the LORD
[1:33:17] hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
[1:33:19] now that was when God manifested his
[1:33:22] salvation man did not esteem him in a
[1:33:25] great way it was the fullness of the
[1:33:28] Godhead was made work was Bodley in
[1:33:30] Christ Jesus God became a man to walk
[1:33:32] among us to manifest their salvation now
[1:33:35] I just want to put it on your lap we
[1:33:37] know that God's Jesus his ministry did
[1:33:40] not stop when he died on Calvary it
[1:33:42] continued through the book of Acts and
[1:33:44] Dow goes down into today the book of
[1:33:46] Acts is not the acts the Apostles as the
[1:33:48] acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles
[1:33:49] it means it's the same Christ's ministry
[1:33:51] continuing now in a mini membered body
[1:33:53] now you look at those people we would
[1:33:56] not esteem them great amen
[1:33:58] there was not a great big Cathedral
[1:34:00] great big chapel robe choirs yo
[1:34:02] excellent music and everything when you
[1:34:04] saw the first church we would never
[1:34:06] people would never have esteemed them as
[1:34:09] great you'd never think you know there
[1:34:12] was no form or comeliness or
[1:34:14] magnificence that when we would see them
[1:34:16] that there'd be any beauty that we would
[1:34:18] desire well this is this is the Bride of
[1:34:20] Christ on display this is the great
[1:34:22] mystery of cry
[1:34:23] send you the hope of glory is now in
[1:34:24] these people you'd never a statement to
[1:34:26] be great this is where God is fulfilling
[1:34:27] his word
[1:34:28] you'd never esteem it great what do you
[1:34:30] look at though you know I went through
[1:34:32] all the you know I went through some of
[1:34:34] the 120 in the upper room yes you're the
[1:34:38] husband I was in Papua New Guinea you
[1:34:39] know the people didn't realize that God
[1:34:41] doesn't take the great ones of the world
[1:34:43] he takes the he takes it down and out
[1:34:45] story yeah you know the rejects the you
[1:34:47] know he takes those are the people he
[1:34:49] takes her and transforms and puts in his
[1:34:51] body
[1:34:52] hallelujah and so now you take you take
[1:34:54] 120 real quick weird Peter he truck
[1:34:57] he's the minister of the church the
[1:34:59] pastor the church he tried to kill a guy
[1:35:01] not that longer with a sword he wasn't
[1:35:04] aiming to cut off his ear he's trying to
[1:35:05] cut off his head but he wasn't a
[1:35:07] swordsman he's a fisherman and then and
[1:35:09] then he said I'm going to stand for your
[1:35:10] Lord I you know I will I will
[1:35:12] I will even go die with you and then he
[1:35:14] goes to the judgement Hall a woman comes
[1:35:16] along aren't you one of them and then he
[1:35:19] and then he buckles under that pressure
[1:35:20] of one woman's testimony you know
[1:35:22] because in those days a woman's word was
[1:35:24] valued less than a man's right so sorry
[1:35:27] buckled under that and then another
[1:35:28] woman came along aren't you one of them
[1:35:30] buckles under that and then someone else
[1:35:31] comes along and he curses and swears and
[1:35:33] denies the Lord three times what a great
[1:35:35] man standing for the faith and here's
[1:35:37] the pastor of the church you know
[1:35:39] there's a woman at the well there was
[1:35:40] Mary Magdalene Seven Devils were cast
[1:35:42] out of her there was Matthew the tax
[1:35:44] collector no one likes the tax collector
[1:35:45] oh yeah this there's all these people
[1:35:49] but God gathered them hallelujah he
[1:35:51] bypassed the ones that we would have
[1:35:53] seemed to be there and he took the
[1:35:55] unlikely ones hallelujah and then you
[1:35:58] take over the Apostle Paul I mean you
[1:36:00] know you think our first church age
[1:36:01] messenger he'll be a one who walked with
[1:36:04] Jesus in the days of his flesh and God
[1:36:06] bypassed all of them they were still
[1:36:07] part of the body but he bypassed all
[1:36:09] them and took a Pharisee of the
[1:36:10] Pharisees and me to manifest his
[1:36:12] Redemption Parlier to the people so now
[1:36:15] see God's ways are they differently I'll
[1:36:19] leave I'm I'm glad God works that way
[1:36:21] amen and you go through the oh you take
[1:36:23] Rahab Tama you can take all those ones
[1:36:25] Bathsheba take all those ones down
[1:36:27] through the scripture the woman that are
[1:36:28] in the lineage of Jesus Christ my mama
[1:36:30] you look out you're Rahab all those ones
[1:36:32] and he and they're reflecting you al
[1:36:36] so now there's nothing of his form that
[1:36:39] we would desire him there's nothing
[1:36:41] great we esteem him stricken we you know
[1:36:43] we didn't esteem him when we saw him we
[1:36:45] hit our hid as it were our faces from
[1:36:47] him now that's where God manifested his
[1:36:50] Redemption as I said now the the bright
[1:36:52] is continuing his ministry not to die on
[1:36:55] the cross to pay for sins but now to
[1:36:56] continue his work right to find the last
[1:36:59] ones that we can go home
[1:37:00] so now work now we look at ourselves who
[1:37:03] has a battle with self and self-worth
[1:37:06] yeah why what what's the problem because
[1:37:09] your esteeming yourself not your
[1:37:11] esteeming yourself valuing yourself as
[1:37:14] man would value right you're not valuing
[1:37:16] yourself as God values you I mean that's
[1:37:19] the problem we value ourselves we have
[1:37:22] we need to change our thinking that we
[1:37:23] don't think according to these five
[1:37:25] senses I mean if you don't value
[1:37:27] ourselves we should never avail
[1:37:28] ourselves according to this a mentor or
[1:37:31] our position in society what we have our
[1:37:33] jobs profession you know status you know
[1:37:37] status who cares about status you know
[1:37:41] it doesn't matter we want to have God
[1:37:42] status and then we want to view
[1:37:45] ourselves as God views us holy Oh what
[1:37:47] we're going through great afflictions it
[1:37:50] says that at pleased it pleased him to
[1:37:52] bruise him at pleased God to bruise him
[1:37:55] to manifest his glory but it sees that
[1:37:58] but it pleased God so it's actually you
[1:38:01] know you may think this is strange but
[1:38:02] we go through a great trial it's
[1:38:04] actually a pleased God to allow you to
[1:38:05] go through it because he wants to
[1:38:07] manifest part of his life out of you
[1:38:09] through that trial hallelujah well no
[1:38:13] but we should say hallelujah we should
[1:38:16] count it all joy whether I can't see the
[1:38:19] joy just count it joy attribute it to
[1:38:21] being joy amen
[1:38:23] so now we so we wrestle with what we
[1:38:26] look like on the outside or how we view
[1:38:28] ourselves but we should look ourselves
[1:38:30] according to the word I mean but that's
[1:38:32] the problem and especially this first
[1:38:34] world as as an image is put in front of
[1:38:36] us that is photoshopped that is video
[1:38:39] you know the videos are altered there's
[1:38:41] a false perception of success there's an
[1:38:43] Instagram life that's put forward amen
[1:38:46] and it's projected and people try and
[1:38:48] become it and that's why they become
[1:38:49] depressed
[1:38:50] broken people what because they are not
[1:38:52] content because the world is trying to
[1:38:54] tell you don't be content with how God
[1:38:56] made you don't be content with what you
[1:38:58] have contentment with godliness as great
[1:39:01] gains I mean it's it's not a bad thing
[1:39:04] it is actually great gain to be content
[1:39:06] with what you have amen because we know
[1:39:09] we know that physical you know being
[1:39:11] very rich doesn't necessarily mean or
[1:39:13] being very poor as not showing God's
[1:39:16] pleasure or displeasure upon you it's
[1:39:18] not actually that is actually not even
[1:39:20] part of it at all
[1:39:21] amen so it's not oh I'm I'm rich
[1:39:24] therefore I must be very spiritual I'm
[1:39:25] very poor I must be very can although
[1:39:27] that's not how God works
[1:39:29] I mean God's blessing is that he chose
[1:39:31] you before the foundation of the world
[1:39:32] remember his love does not change his
[1:39:35] love does not change so you know his
[1:39:38] love is shown an election his love is
[1:39:42] shown and choosing Amen because he said
[1:39:44] before Jacob and Esau were born Jacob
[1:39:47] have I loved Esau have I hated because
[1:39:48] he chose one rejected the other and
[1:39:50] there was God's choosing he said well
[1:39:52] that's not fair I just say thank you
[1:39:54] Lord us chosen I'm just happy I'm an
[1:39:56] aren't you
[1:39:57] hallelujah so so he chose one and
[1:40:00] rejected the other right so his love is
[1:40:04] shown an election and his choosing
[1:40:07] because if God has decided there one of
[1:40:09] them you're gonna be one of them and
[1:40:11] you're accepted in the beloved you've
[1:40:13] been your he he's shown as love towards
[1:40:15] you and that love cannot change
[1:40:19] hallelujah so therefore we should just
[1:40:21] relax and rejoice and love him Amen I
[1:40:26] mean we should just enjoy him everyday
[1:40:28] just be happy being safe holy have you
[1:40:31] got nothing to be happy about it you
[1:40:33] know you can't think of anything going
[1:40:34] well in life just think well at least I
[1:40:36] have eternal life
[1:40:37] at least I at least I have redemption at
[1:40:39] least I'm walking in the light at least
[1:40:41] he's revealed himself to me at least
[1:40:43] he's taking all my sin away and they
[1:40:45] cease she'll be into the kingdom with
[1:40:46] His Holy Spirit hallelujah I just begin
[1:40:49] to rejoice in those things hallelujah
[1:40:52] and you'll just keep rejoicing in that
[1:40:53] through all eternity
[1:40:55] hallelujah you say well life's going
[1:40:58] sideways
[1:40:59] let it go sideways Josef's life win very
[1:41:02] sideways
[1:41:03] comes to his brothers guess what I had a
[1:41:06] dream oh he comes this guy and you guys
[1:41:09] all bowed down to me that's the
[1:41:11] conclusion of it I'm gonna be here to
[1:41:12] this place
[1:41:13] he's like two-by-four thinks he's king
[1:41:15] of the world you know that's God's dream
[1:41:18] that was a vision I mean I was you know
[1:41:21] it was a dream but there was god chung
[1:41:22] this is what's gonna happen in the
[1:41:23] future
[1:41:24] and no doubt I got the coat of many
[1:41:25] colors I'm special but then his life
[1:41:29] went sideways he's now being sold well
[1:41:32] one of his brothers wanted to kill him
[1:41:34] once he'd know don't kill him and he
[1:41:35] sold as a slave and he's going down into
[1:41:37] Egypt as a slave and no doubt as my
[1:41:40] thought but but I thought I was gonna be
[1:41:43] head of the tribe I thought I was going
[1:41:46] to be the one everyone were bow down to
[1:41:47] and he's actually going according to
[1:41:49] what God told him he's actually walking
[1:41:51] according to that dream see we don't
[1:41:53] know the middle we know the end from the
[1:41:55] beginning
[1:41:55] but the details in the middle do you
[1:41:57] know if you knew the you wouldn't need
[1:42:00] faith do you know that if you didn't
[1:42:02] actually know you wouldn't need faith
[1:42:03] that's why God doesn't show us what's
[1:42:06] around the next corner just keep walking
[1:42:07] just keep walking why and you gotta have
[1:42:09] faith Lord you've led me here you'll
[1:42:11] lead me on I mean I don't know what's
[1:42:13] going on but I know you're leading me
[1:42:15] and so he's taken down into Egypt
[1:42:17] thinking but I thought I was gonna be
[1:42:19] here to the tribe and he's going exactly
[1:42:20] how God were him to be but he had sent
[1:42:22] himself my life's gone for highways and
[1:42:26] then now he's finally there in part of
[1:42:28] his house in charge of the whole thing
[1:42:31] now it's going to happen and he finds
[1:42:34] himself in jail again
[1:42:36] you know just when he thought everything
[1:42:39] was coming together oh no because God
[1:42:43] knew the character he needed to have in
[1:42:44] order to manifest there and many times
[1:42:47] you say yes Lord you've made me the
[1:42:49] bride but there's a character that's
[1:42:51] going to be molded and shaped and the
[1:42:53] words gonna be molded into us although
[1:42:54] our carnality is going to be taken out
[1:42:56] of us holy and God knows how to do it
[1:42:59] hallelujah why because he wants you he
[1:43:01] has an image of you and it's more than
[1:43:03] just you thinking you're awesome with a
[1:43:04] crown and a white robe saying look at me
[1:43:06] hallelujah no you're made in His image
[1:43:09] I'm it's a history military have that
[1:43:11] Hemi same humility that surrendered your
[1:43:14] love prisoner to Christ you're the same
[1:43:16] way
[1:43:17] hallelujah glory to God so there he is
[1:43:20] and maybe he thought for the second time
[1:43:21] well maybe this is it and God had him in
[1:43:24] the prison God had him as a slave God
[1:43:26] had him in the prison God had him at the
[1:43:27] right hand of Pharaoh then finally the
[1:43:31] vision the dream here it is they bowed
[1:43:34] down hallelujah and we think our life
[1:43:37] win sideways Rahab no doubt you know ye
[1:43:40] you just take any character in the Bible
[1:43:41] there's Moses on the backside of the
[1:43:42] desert
[1:43:43] forty years that's a long time I haven't
[1:43:46] been alive that long that's a long time
[1:43:48] forty years and may you know say year
[1:43:53] after year take the sheep here now it's
[1:43:55] spring do this you know just farming
[1:43:58] trouble stress things going on in life
[1:44:01] but knows how to get hold of us and
[1:44:03] maybe he thought man I was you know he
[1:44:06] had his foot on the throne and he
[1:44:08] decided to forsake it I thought man he
[1:44:11] was right there here is back so the
[1:44:13] desert how's your life going Moses
[1:44:16] according to your plan no let's go on
[1:44:19] sideways that's the same thing with us I
[1:44:23] mean I don't mean that as a joke we
[1:44:28] think man what's happened God knows
[1:44:29] what's happening you'd have confidence
[1:44:32] be certain of God amen now he says to
[1:44:34] see I'll just read this he says now what
