[41:48] him over the works of thy hands thou has
[41:51] put all things in subjection under his
[41:53] feet 4 and that he put all in subjection
[41:56] under him he left nothing that has not
[41:59] put under him but now we see not yet all
[42:01] things put under him but we see Jesus
[42:04] who has made a little lower than the
[42:06] Angels for the suffering of death
[42:08] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[42:10] the grace of God should taste death for
[42:12] every man for it became him for whom are
[42:15] all things and by whom are all things
[42:17] and bringing many so
[42:19] under glory to make the captain of their
[42:21] salvation perfect through sufferings for
[42:24] both he that sanctifies and they who are
[42:26] sanctified are all of one for which
[42:29] cause he is not ashamed to call them
[42:31] brethren Amen metal-look bless his word
[42:34] you may have your seats this morning now
[42:39] I want to take a a bit of a thought this
[42:43] morning from Hebrews 2 and Hebrews 2 and
[42:49] 9 there but we see Jesus the Apostle
[42:53] Paul is here is writing to the Hebrews
[42:55] here he was writing it was more than an
[42:58] intellectual idea that he was putting
[43:00] forth it was more than just a new
[43:02] doctrine or a new teaching or a new
[43:04] religion but the Apostle Paul knew what
[43:06] he was talking about he was a man that
[43:09] would from his from from from being a
[43:11] young boy he studied the scriptures and
[43:13] he would he would spend a lot of hours
[43:15] no doubt memorizing them and writing
[43:17] them down and you know he he would have
[43:19] you know he became a Pharisee of the
[43:22] Pharisees he's a very devout man but
[43:25] there was but there was a part of his
[43:27] life where where he could not conquer
[43:30] and that part of his life was himself
[43:32] you know we understand that under the
[43:35] blood of bulls and goats no man could no
[43:37] man could be perfect in the sight of God
[43:39] the blood of bulls and goats could only
[43:40] cover sin it could not change the nature
[43:43] of man that we are born with you know we
[43:45] we know from from the book of Genesis
[43:47] where we're sittin cam into the world
[43:49] that that Satan allowed a hybrid nature
[43:55] of man to come into being these are a
[43:57] hybrid body you know this is a fallen
[43:59] body the spirit of man has fallen we're
[44:01] born and soon shaped at iniquity come to
[44:04] the world speaking lives and we should
[44:07] say hallelujah to that because if you
[44:08] recognize that then you know God has
[44:11] provided a way for you to be changed I
[44:13] mean it says in the Bible that there is
[44:15] not one man that seeketh after God not
[44:17] one because it's not in man's nature to
[44:20] actually look for him you're Amanda's
[44:22] man is constantly trying to further
[44:24] himself with maybe maybe a bigger house
[44:27] or maybe even owning a house or a better
[44:29] car or a better job or you know some
[44:31] kind of thing
[44:32] but that is not success in life you know
[44:35] success in life is not whether you have
[44:37] your own house or whether you have you
[44:40] know all the fancy you know all the
[44:42] natural things that is not how you win
[44:44] at the game of life you win at the game
[44:46] of life by meeting him I mean where
[44:48] Jesus said I am the resurrection and the
[44:50] life hallelujah
[44:52] that is that is the way to win don't get
[44:54] caught up in the in the hamster wheel of
[44:57] life you know comparing yourself with
[44:59] the Joneses and well I'm a certain age
[45:02] and and they're the same age as me and
[45:04] they've got their own they're virtually
[45:05] paid off their own house they've got a
[45:06] successful career you know they've got
[45:08] all these things and what do I have what
[45:11] happens their midlife crisis strikes
[45:13] then you start chasing those things who
[45:16] cares about those things hey you with me
[45:18] who cares about those things what legacy
[45:21] do you want to leave behind what legacy
[45:23] a big inheritance for your children or
[45:25] would you rather see Jesus Christ's
[45:27] birth than them I mean that should be
[45:30] the legacy that you should want to see
[45:31] for your family for your spouse is that
[45:33] if you were if this is the last day you
[45:35] had on earth that your legacy is Jesus
[45:37] Christ is living in them hallelujah that
[45:40] has eternal value be following me
[45:43] amen so don't worry about thee you know
[45:46] don't worry about anything else look to
[45:49] him the Apostle Paul he didn't all of us
[45:54] study and all of you know he was a
[45:56] Pharisee of the Pharisees all of us
[45:58] devoutness all of his ambition didn't
[46:01] come to anything when he stepped into
[46:03] the presence of the pillar of fire on
[46:05] the road to Damascus I mean with that
[46:07] where where where that light struck him
[46:09] down and he says who are you lord
[46:11] and that word Lord a supreme one Hawaii
[46:13] Supreme One amen he says I am Jesus whom
[46:16] you persecute it turned his whole life
[46:19] upside down
[46:20] Alleluia but for the Apostle Paul after
[46:24] that experience and going down into
[46:26] Arabia for three years and he would
[46:28] study the Old Testament and he would he
[46:30] would begin to find out that the god he
[46:32] met on the road to Damascus is the same
[46:35] God that Moses met the same God that
[46:37] Elijah met him in the same God that you
[46:40] know that covered Adam and Eve with with
[46:41] lambskins as they went out of the garden
[46:43] hallelujah that same God that spoke to
[46:46] he met him you've got to be real sure
[46:48] your experience matches God's Bible I
[46:51] mean that your experience member we are
[46:53] saved by faith in the Word of God I mean
[46:55] you can't just go by experience he'll
[46:57] remember God vindicates his word sure I
[46:59] mean he's a supernatural God we do not
[47:02] serve a God of tradition we do not serve
[47:05] a God of history I mean we are not
[47:07] historian saying all this is what Jesus
[47:09] did 2,000 years ago or even in the 60s
[47:12] or even 20 years ago I mean but he got
[47:15] to be alive today
[47:15] I mean but we see Jesus hallelujah he
[47:20] says he says I am the same yesterday
[47:22] today and forever and if that is the
[47:25] case and it is true it's in his word
[47:27] that means he's the same God that meant
[47:29] the Apostle Paul is present today and
[47:31] real Christianity is meeting him I mean
[47:34] to be a Christian is to be christ-like
[47:36] and you cannot be christ-like by trying
[47:39] to turn over a new leaf
[47:40] or a new year's resolution or finding
[47:43] some self-help book seven steps to
[47:45] becoming a successful Christian that's
[47:48] not how you become christ-like your will
[47:50] could not be number one of your life the
[47:54] Apostle Paul's world was was governing
[47:56] him here's a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[47:58] because his will was this is what I want
[48:00] to be this was his ambition but when he
[48:03] met God he had to cast away his own cast
[48:06] away his own ambition cast away his own
[48:08] will he says I can't everything but done
[48:11] that I would win Christ and that's what
[48:13] you've got to put your whole life your
[48:16] whole life everything you have
[48:19] doesn't matter of its material or family
[48:21] whatever you got to put that second
[48:23] place I mean you can't serve you can't
[48:26] serve God and something else at the same
[48:27] time a man at it because if he is God
[48:31] serve him with everything within him
[48:33] with your you're within you hallelujah
[48:36] that's what we should do I love singing
[48:38] the songs of Zion I love singing about
[48:40] Redemption I love singing about the
[48:42] blood cuz it's a reality
[48:44] hallelujah I trust it's a reality to you
[48:47] Amen glory to God he had to surrender as
[48:51] will a man and when he did that he says
[48:54] he says many times Paul a prisoner of
[48:56] Jesus Christ amen and a prisoner
[48:59] there's no say and where they go they
[49:01] don't they don't call the warden up in
[49:04] the morning and say warden you know I
[49:06] don't feel like being in the cell I want
[49:09] to go out for a little bit you know

[49:19] day core in this person I'm going to
[49:21] change the rules no that's not how it
[49:23] works the warden says you know the law
[49:26] which is behind the warden says this is
[49:28] your sentence this is we have to be I
[49:31] mean this is what you have to eat this
[49:34] is your schedule and you have no say
[49:36] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[49:39] being a believer amen he gives us
[49:42] schedule a many you know he gives this
[49:45] is what you should this is how you
[49:46] should be this is how you should dress
[49:48] this how you should treat one another so
[49:51] you should treat your family amen and we
[49:53] understand it's not out of rules it's
[49:56] out of love hallelujah if you really
[49:58] love him it's a joy to be a Christian I
[50:00] mean it's a joy to serve the Lord
[50:02] hallelujah it's not a drudgery or a
[50:04] hardship or or help me lord it so thank
[50:07] you Lord even in the worst day thank you
[50:09] Lord hallelujah and I would rather love
[50:12] him than love this world
[50:14] what does does the devil have a heaven
[50:16] to give you the Hat does he have any
[50:18] turtle home to give you then why serve
[50:20] them I mean won't let him be your master

[50:32] a church Church can't give you eternal
[50:33] life I mean some preacher can't give you
[50:36] eternal life it's God that has to give
[50:38] you eternal life and it's God that takes
[50:40] you to heaven hallelujah that's why you
[50:42] know the Apostle Paul it comes the very
[50:45] one that created heavens and earth who
[50:49] are you Lord hallelujah
[50:51] you know my heart's desire I just speak
[50:55] from my heart for a little bit you know
[50:57] there's a reason on Wednesday we're
[51:00] talking about the resurrection talk
[51:02] about Jesus going up Calvary talking
[51:04] about the disciples if they really
[51:06] understood what was going on that day
[51:08] that would have been the happiest people
[51:10] in all the earth
[51:11] hallelujah and the Spirit of God just
[51:13] dropped into
[51:13] place hey man you all know who's here
[51:16] hallelujah why is he dude why did he do
[51:19] that
[51:19] because he wants you to know I did that
[51:22] for you I mean I'm I'm here to prove to
[51:25] you it's more than a story
[51:27] I mean it's more than an idea it's more
[51:29] than a different way of life but he's
[51:31] trying to tell you I am the resurrection
[51:33] and the life I paid for your sins
[51:35] hallelujah I cook your send it away that
[51:38] day on Calvary hallelujah memory died
[51:40] for the sins of the world you're in that
[51:42] you're in the world are you proud of the
[51:44] world that means you purchase your
[51:45] salvation hallelujah to God glory to the
[51:49] land amen and then we think about how
[51:51] glorious it is on this day the lamb
[51:53] steps forth
[51:54] pablor he takes the book loosens the
[51:57] seals Amen steps down upon the earth
[51:59] what do you see when you see believers
[52:01] what do you see manifested
[52:03] I mean what's my title but we see Jesus
[52:06] where is Jesus and his people I mean
[52:09] Jesus in this church
[52:10] hallelujah says like the Apostle Paul
[52:13] this is this being speaks to him he says
[52:16] who al or I'm Jesus whom you persecute
[52:19] he didn't go chasing after a
[52:21] supernatural being he was he was after
[52:23] ordinary looking people who lived
[52:25] ordinary kind of lives I mean that
[52:27] weren't the who's who in life they just
[52:29] the common people hallelujah but Jesus
[52:32] was in them I mean God was veiled in
[52:34] their hallelujah hallelujah but we see
[52:37] Jesus and then you come among people
[52:39] what is this what is this I'll talk
[52:42] about these four walls who cares about
[52:44] the four walls God gave us the four
[52:45] walls but this isn't the Church where
[52:47] the people of the church I mean the
[52:50] people of the dwelling place of God
[52:51] hallelujah so what do you see when you
[52:56] see one another Paul would say in 1st
[52:58] Corinthians 11 that many are sick among
[53:00] you because you do not discern the
[53:01] Lord's body he's not talking about the
[53:03] bread and the wine those are just
[53:05] elements or symbols he's talking about
[53:07] the body is the body of Christ
[53:09] hallelujah when you see when you take
[53:12] each other by the hand she about looking
[53:14] someone's I see I see eternity and I see
[53:17] more than just a person I see eternity
[53:18] veils I see God bound in place
[53:21] hallelujah
[53:22] is that what you see but we see Jesus
[53:26] he had ambition amen but the Apostle
[53:32] Paul when he would when he would begin
[53:33] to write and he would tell us in
[53:38] Ephesians chapter 2 let's just go there
[53:40] because we read that he says not all
[53:43] things as we just turned to Ephesians 2
[53:47] I'm just going to read from Hebrews 2 he
[53:50] says thou is put all things in
[53:51] subjection under his feet for in that he
[53:54] put all in subjection under him he left
[53:56] nothing that is not put under him but
[53:58] now we see not yet all things put under
[54:01] him because we there's still death in
[54:04] the world physical death but the death
[54:07] that he abolished at the cross was
[54:09] spiritual death which is a far greater
[54:11] death than a natural death that's why
[54:14] the Apostle Paul went you know when the
[54:17] judgment came down behead him by the
[54:20] sword he's meat he be found guilty for
[54:23] insurrection all these things amen he
[54:25] went glory he went rejoicing he told he
[54:28] told Timothy before was coming he knew
[54:30] was coming I have a crown of life
[54:32] we'll read it later overcrowd of life
[54:34] waiting for me do you think of a man
[54:36] where he reading Corinthians we'll get
[54:39] it to Ephesians but you know when he
[54:40] would write and write in 1st or 2nd
[54:42] Corinthians he said about how I knew a
[54:46] man about 15 years ago is lifted up into
[54:48] the third heaven you know who he's
[54:49] talking about himself imagine a man have
[54:52] been taken up into the eternal it comes
[54:55] back down and then some other mortal
[54:58] says I'm gonna cut your head off do you
[55:00] think he would have been worried worried
[55:02] here's my ticket out of here
[55:04] I mean I've lived my right I've run my
[55:06] race I mean I I've delivered the full
[55:09] counsel of God to the people I have
[55:12] lived out my portion of the word and I'm
[55:14] done hallelujah
[55:16] aren't you gonna be glad one day I mean
[55:18] when the dead in Christ rise amen and
[55:21] God will cause us to recognize them
[55:23] what's he what's the what's a little
[55:25] gonna say to you basically and you're
[55:26] done
[55:26] I'm gonna take you home hallelujah glory
[55:30] to God I'm so glad we're living in that
[55:33] time of the resurrection
[55:36] allelujah asians two and one the Apostle
[55:40] Paul he this is not this is from
[55:42] experience and you had he quickened who
[55:45] once did in trespasses and sins we ran
[55:47] in times past you walked according to
[55:50] the course of this world according to
[55:52] the Prince of the power of the air the
[55:54] spirit that now worketh in the children
[55:56] of disobedience among whom also ye all
[55:59] had our conversation in times past in
[56:01] the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[56:03] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[56:05] we're by nature the children of Wrath
[56:07] even as others but God who is rich in
[56:10] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[56:12] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[56:14] hath quickened us together with Christ
[56:17] by grace ye are saved and has raised us
[56:20] up together and made us certain heavenly
[56:22] places in Christ Jesus that in the ages
[56:25] to come he might show the exceeding
[56:27] riches of His grace and his kindness
[56:29] towards us through Christ Jesus for by
[56:32] grace you're saved through faith and
[56:33] that is not of yourselves as a gift of
[56:35] God not of works lest any man should
[56:37] boast for we are his workmanship created
[56:39] in Christ Jesus
[56:41] and to good works which God hath before
[56:43] ordained that we should walk in them
[56:46] now we could keep reading because it's a
[56:48] glorious chapter but you know the
[56:51] Apostle Paul knew what it was like to do
[56:53] works
[56:53] he knew others like to be very devout
[56:56] around all the feasts times and to and
[56:59] to eat the right kind of things and keep
[57:00] the law with all of his energies and all
[57:02] of his ambition but then when the Lord
[57:04] quickened a member he was dead
[57:06] spiritually he was dead I mean and even
[57:09] in that condition even living there and
[57:12] you're sitting under Gamaliel the
[57:13] greatest Bible teacher of the age he was
[57:15] dead hallelujah but then one day Jesus
[57:19] came amen and so now he became alive his
[57:23] eyes of the eyes of his understanding
[57:25] became open amen he wasn't dead in
[57:28] trespasses and sins anymore but the Lord
[57:30] opened his eyes to what he was doing in
[57:32] his age amen and then he would begin to
[57:35] write that we were once we have been
[57:37] quickened by him I meant the believer is
[57:39] a totally different kind of person I
[57:41] mean to the people out on the street I
[57:43] mean not because they look at us and say
[57:46] why you dressed different in your a
[57:47] different kind of way I mean
[57:49] there's a life that comes into them I
[57:51] mean we have been quickened or made
[57:52] alive hallelujah is just like a seed you
[57:55] know you could have a couple of seeds
[57:56] they could look the same but they're
[57:58] both is no expression of life it has to
[58:01] be quick and it's going to be made alive
[58:02] I mean that when you take a seed and you
[58:04] plant it I mean everything that's in
[58:06] that seed comes to that's to come to
[58:08] life I lose just like an apple seed
[58:11] every Apple that will grow on that tree
[58:13] is already in that sea I mean it's just
[58:15] going to be planted I mean it's going to
[58:17] be watered it's going to be in the right
[58:19] kind of conditions
[58:20] hallelujah then the tree begins to grow
[58:22] I mean then all the apples that are in
[58:24] that one seed they come to life I mean
[58:27] that tree can raise up above the soil
[58:29] I mean begin to grow to its maker
[58:31] hallelujah begin to give it glory
[58:33] hallelujah nature praises God you know
[58:36] it's not ashamed it's not ashamed of
[58:39] praising God amen in our life you say
[58:42] well what about us how life should be a
[58:45] worship everything we do should be a
[58:47] worship I'm not talking about singing
[58:49] songs all day but everything we do
[58:52] should be a worship to God
[58:53] I mean how we treat our children how we
[58:55] treat our spouse how we treat people in
[58:58] the you know out on the street how we
[58:59] conduct ourselves why are you this way
[59:01] this is a worship a man because I've
[59:04] been redeemed hallelujah to God
[59:07] hallelujah that's how it should be
[59:09] everything we should do I mean when we
[59:12] get up in the morning thank you lord
[59:13] I have another 24 hours Amen to walk
[59:16] with you hallelujah brother Brown would
[59:19] say Amen he would say about I'll find it
[59:25] if I can find it here
[59:28] he says many times we see the unseen
[59:30] hand of God and we don't understand it's
[59:34] him now Lord we see Jesus we don't see
[59:37] all things we see we still take the
[59:41] saint sorry we we see we still take the
[59:46] Saints of us to the grave and walk over
[59:48] each other's grave but we see Jesus we
[59:50] made the promise we see him with us not
[59:53] Jesus in the grave not Jesus 2,000 years
[59:55] ago but Jesus tonight it's with us we
[59:58] see him manifested in all of his power
[1:00:01] and signs and wonders
[1:00:02] God may we never neglect this great
[1:00:05] salvation but may we embrace it and
[1:00:07] accept it and be reverent and live by it
[1:00:09] until the day that Jesus comes to take
[1:00:11] us home
[1:00:12] granted Lord we ask in his name
[1:00:15] hallelujah you know but many times in
[1:00:18] life we know we're just walking through
[1:00:20] life thank you that's the one thing I
[1:00:22] forgot this morning appreciate it
[1:00:23] you know we walk through life and we
[1:00:27] don't understand the protection that's
[1:00:28] around us I believe we were talking
[1:00:30] about this yesterday I mean yo we yo we
[1:00:33] take for granted we take for granted
[1:00:35] things that God keeps us from I mean
[1:00:38] when we just get up and we go about our
[1:00:40] daily life and you know things sometimes
[1:00:44] in the morning things can go wrong and
[1:00:45] maybe we're late for work or maybe the
[1:00:47] car just doesn't work and you know we we
[1:00:49] just can't get on the road like who want
[1:00:50] to and God's protecting us from from a
[1:00:53] crash someplace amen where you see you
[1:00:56] know you know there's many things that
[1:00:58] go on in life we just get up in the
[1:01:00] morning remember the devil he actually
[1:01:03] hates you
[1:01:04] he's not your friend he's not here to
[1:01:07] help you in any way he wants to destroy
[1:01:09] you he doesn't take prisoners to keep
[1:01:12] them prisoners he kicked he makes
[1:01:14] prisoners to execute prisoners amen and
[1:01:17] so we have to understand this world is
[1:01:21] more than what these five senses declare
[1:01:22] yes the unseen realm is far greater than
[1:01:25] what we see with these five senses I
[1:01:27] have been so now if that is the case
[1:01:29] then there is two powers battling
[1:01:32] there's a spirit of God and there's a
[1:01:34] spirit of Satan it's only two when you
[1:01:37] boil it down this only two and those two
[1:01:40] warring over you those two are fighting
[1:01:42] over you
[1:01:43] amen but we have to have great
[1:01:46] confidence where the Lord says I'll not
[1:01:49] lose one of them I'll not lose he cannot
[1:01:51] lose one of hers he says all the fire
[1:01:54] all that the father has given me will
[1:01:56] come and all that come to me will know
[1:01:58] why I'll no wise cast out I've been
[1:02:00] where the scripture would tell us at the
[1:02:02] angel the lord encamps about those who
[1:02:04] fear him and he delivers them hallelujah
[1:02:07] and so now if that is the case and I
[1:02:10] believe it's the case then when you get
[1:02:12] up in the morning even when you came
[1:02:14] here I'll say this it's
[1:02:16] more in this room than you can see I
[1:02:17] mean this far more in this room than you
[1:02:20] can see I mean because when the children
[1:02:22] of God begin to gather and worship amen
[1:02:24] the Angels that are said to protect them
[1:02:26] they come with holiness heaven has come
[1:02:29] into this room and then God is present
[1:02:31] among us hallelujah if we could only
[1:02:33] just just grasp the reality all that
[1:02:36] heaven and us has come down into this
[1:02:38] room hallelujah I am the resurrection
[1:02:40] and the life
[1:02:41] believe without this hallelujah this far
[1:02:44] more in this room than you can see well
[1:02:46] I'm just going along life I don't really
[1:02:48] see a whole bunch there's more in this
[1:02:51] room and see Alleluia the scripture
[1:02:56] would tell us of Elijah his servant
[1:02:58] there in there and Dathan or dothe or
[1:03:00] whatever it said and the Syrians come to
[1:03:03] go you know come get Elijah and they and
[1:03:08] they march they surround the city he's
[1:03:09] he's staying in and the servant gets up
[1:03:12] and he sees that the whole place is
[1:03:14] basically besieged and the servant gets
[1:03:18] worried what are we going to do Elisha
[1:03:21] wake up we're in trouble help us what's
[1:03:23] going to happen and then he just maybe
[1:03:26] just goes at listen Lord open is more
[1:03:29] for stand against us what are you
[1:03:31] worried about this Lord opened the man's
[1:03:34] eyes his eyes were 20/20 but as
[1:03:37] spiritual eyes were closed and what we
[1:03:40] really need is the spiritual eyes to
[1:03:42] come open
[1:03:43] Amen this is more than tradition this is
[1:03:45] more than what we do on a Sunday morning
[1:03:47] or maybe a Wednesday night I mean but
[1:03:49] it's a living reality hey with me this
[1:03:52] message our Lord Jesus Christ is real I
[1:03:55] said well I know that no but you got to
[1:03:58] really know that amen but we see Jesus
[1:04:00] that's my burden my burden recently is
[1:04:03] Lord everything you are I want to see I
[1:04:05] want you to be so real I mean you're the
[1:04:08] same God that was with the Prophet
[1:04:10] you're the same God of the day of
[1:04:11] Pentecost you're the same God that
[1:04:13] filled the temple in the Old Testament
[1:04:14] amen and you're the same God today and
[1:04:17] the glorious thing about today is his
[1:04:19] blood cleanses us that he can dwell in
[1:04:21] us hallelujah amen we should never be
[1:04:24] afraid to just lose control
[1:04:26] take control of the meeting Alleluia
[1:04:29] because that's what we need you need to
[1:04:31] let her Lord take my life and make it
[1:04:33] Thane I can't live this life in my own
[1:04:35] strength if you do you'll fail and
[1:04:37] you'll be discouraged many people try
[1:04:39] and I'm going to be a Christian I'm
[1:04:40] going to turn a new leaf I'm gonna walk
[1:04:42] with them and they fall flat and they
[1:04:44] wonder why they fall flat is because
[1:04:46] they have not given up they have not
[1:04:48] surrendered fully I mean you've got to
[1:04:50] actually you have to die that's it a few
[1:04:53] Sundays ago you've got to die you have
[1:04:55] been to die and be born again and that's
[1:04:57] not by it just saying is some sinner's
[1:04:59] prayer or just saying I'm gonna be a
[1:05:01] Christian now you've got to die your
[1:05:03] nature must die partly because of a
[1:05:05] Dyson he can come in I mean it makes a
[1:05:07] new creature in himself and if you are a
[1:05:10] new creature you say well I'm battling
[1:05:12] and look who's been quickened who's been
[1:05:15] quickened
[1:05:15] amen you're not dead anymore you'll be
[1:05:17] made alive in Jesus Christ howling
[1:05:19] you're a new creature in him amen that's
[1:05:22] a powerful thing you think now God has
[1:05:25] made us eat alive Holly and now he can
[1:05:27] operate through his body amen
[1:05:30] Satan better be careful Jesus Christ is
[1:05:32] here
[1:05:33] Amen not just in this room but wherever
[1:05:35] you are he says I'll never leave you I
[1:05:37] will never leave you nor forsake you who
[1:05:40] is that the very crater that made all
[1:05:41] things well says I'll never leave you so
[1:05:44] he says I'll go with you
[1:05:46] I'll go with you and to the world I'll
[1:05:48] go with you to school I'll go with you
[1:05:49] to your job site I'll go with you on the
[1:05:52] road I'll go with you to your house you
[1:05:54] say well I'm the only one no announced
[1:05:56] beliefs Mary was in the same kind of
[1:05:59] predicament
[1:06:00] hallelujah no one else had the
[1:06:04] visitation of Gabriel and she was just
[1:06:07] an ordinary young kind of girl I don't
[1:06:09] know what kind of age 16 maybe I don't
[1:06:11] know she's walking to a well one day
[1:06:14] just going about her business then she
[1:06:16] sees an angel this is more than a story
[1:06:19] there's more than a story friends and
[1:06:21] then and then this angel calls her by
[1:06:24] name Mary you're highly favored you're
[1:06:28] going to have the promise you're gonna
[1:06:29] have the seed of the woman hallelujah
[1:06:31] you got to bring forth the Messiah
[1:06:33] you're going to bring the holy water of
[1:06:35] Israel's going to be birthed out of you
[1:06:37] and then she says how can this be
[1:06:40] hallelujah the Holy Spirit will
[1:06:41] overshadow you you know we look at the
[1:06:43] word we look at promises they which are
[1:06:46] alive and remain should not hinder them
[1:06:48] which are asleep of the dead in Christ
[1:06:50] will rise first and which are alive and
[1:06:52] remain shall be caught up together to
[1:06:53] meet the Lord in the air
[1:06:54] and we look at this to say how can it be
[1:06:56] so easy the Holy Spirit overshadow thee
[1:06:59] hallelujah you bring forth the promise
[1:07:01] of the day so she and then so she just
[1:07:03] is real simple
[1:07:04] let it be unto me according to thy word
[1:07:06] her faith accepted the promise I mean
[1:07:10] with many many young woman from the time
[1:07:12] that Isaiah gave the prophecy of virgin
[1:07:14] shall conceive eight hundred years about
[1:07:16] then - when Mary was here in the and and
[1:07:19] and the angel Gabriel visited her there
[1:07:21] to be many young woman I'm gonna be her
[1:07:24] and no doubt there would have been many
[1:07:26] dads I believe you're gonna be in

[1:07:31] you've been raised in the synagogue you
[1:07:33] do everything just right hallelujah hey
[1:07:36] those things are ok but you got to meet
[1:07:38] him I remember then 800 years later
[1:07:40] after Isaiah spoke those words a virgin
[1:07:43] shall conceive here she was she just
[1:07:46] accepted it let it be unto me according
[1:07:48] to thy word and we have to really we
[1:07:52] have to take that same kind of stand in

[1:08:40] world I mean the Prince of the power of
[1:08:42] the year but now we've been made alive
[1:08:44] but when I met him when I met the Lord

[1:10:06] he says well you bow down and worship me
[1:10:08] I'll give you all the kingdoms of the
[1:10:09] world but then you know it's the same
[1:10:12] thing with you Jesus he knew he was
[1:10:14] gonna take it over
[1:10:15] he just had to purchase it so he could
[1:10:18] have said to the devil I'm not trying to
[1:10:19] put words in his mouth but he could have
[1:10:21] said why would I want to run your your

[1:10:38] amen and it's glorious and there's
[1:10:40] nothing bad about it

[1:10:49] I don't want it but really you do it
[1:10:51] should just be nothing in here there's
[1:10:55] no deep calling to the deep with that
[1:10:57] desire go it died
[1:10:59] hallelujah it's been buried in the blood
[1:11:01] of Jesus Christ I don't know where he
[1:11:04] took it away
[1:11:05] Jesus took it away hallelujah amen
[1:11:10] that's what he does the blood of Jesus
[1:11:12] Christ cleanses us from all sin and he
[1:11:16] takes the nature away that we can
[1:11:19] overcome the food amen it's like a man
[1:11:21] who always gets into debt
[1:11:23] a rich man can come and pay the debt off
[1:11:25] but if the but if the nature of the man
[1:11:27] who falls into debt all the time is
[1:11:29] still there he will fall into debt again
[1:11:31] amen that's like justification but real
[1:11:34] transformation by his Holy Spirit is the
[1:11:36] spirit of the rich man goes into the one
[1:11:38] who falls into debt and if he has that
[1:11:40] same spirit he won't fall into dead
[1:11:42] anymore you following me that's what
[1:11:45] Jesus does hallelujah we we shouldn't
[1:11:48] just be in a cycle of you know victory
[1:11:51] and defeat victory and defeat you gotta
[1:11:54] look back in your life where were you're
[1:11:56] a year ago maybe I don't know how long
[1:11:58] ago look where you are today what's
[1:12:00] under your feet now there wasn't under
[1:12:02] your feet then who's who's more
[1:12:05] victorious who's more victorious today
[1:12:08] hallelujah that's the Lord putting
[1:12:10] things under your feet that's what he
[1:12:12] that's how he wants us to be amen we are
[1:12:15] victorious hallelujah to him that
[1:12:18] overcometh eces it's always a victory
[1:12:21] about them that overcoming every age to
[1:12:24] him that overcometh in this age you'll
[1:12:26] sit with me on my throne as I set out on
[1:12:29] my Father's throne
[1:12:30] hallelujah and he lets us do it he
[1:12:35] causes us to do it hallelujah glory to
[1:12:39] God now let's go to first Corinthians 15
[1:12:44] so the Apostle Paul hallelujah he sees
[1:12:50] what it alive we be made alive we be
[1:12:54] received if you've received eternal life
[1:12:56] you have the greatest thing you can't
[1:12:58] buy it you can't earn it you can't work
[1:13:01] for it
[1:13:02] you can't bargain for it he gives it
[1:13:04] without manual price hallelujah you have
[1:13:07] the most precious thing
[1:13:10] hallelujah I mean actually sorry we're
[1:13:14] going to come back to there but I didn't
[1:13:16] mention it before but I want to actually
[1:13:18] go down to
[1:13:20] sorry I want to actually go to Luke 2ne1
[1:13:24] first if you don't mind because I just
[1:13:33] want to deal with I know I did mention
[1:13:35] in the beginning don't get on the
[1:13:37] devil's hamster wheel mean but this what
[1:13:39] is so big what is so big in the day now
[1:13:42] we live in home improvement amen
[1:13:46] you know the block DIY and proving
[1:13:48] improving improving what is it it's it
[1:13:51] is comparing it is keeping up with the
[1:13:53] Joneses but it's been magnified like a
[1:13:56] million times amen
[1:13:58] and we don't want to get caught in that
[1:14:01] trap Luke 21 and that's read from verse
[1:14:09] 29 and he spake to them a parable behold
[1:14:16] the fig tree and all the trees when they
[1:14:18] now shoot forth you see and know that
[1:14:21] your own selves that summer is nigh is
[1:14:24] nigh at hand so likewise ye when you see
[1:14:28] these things come to pass know you that
[1:14:30] the kingdom of God is nigh at hand vela
[1:14:31] i say to you this generation shall not
[1:14:33] pass away till all be fulfilled now we
[1:14:36] understand the fig tree and prophecy is
[1:14:38] Israel if you go read Jeremiah chapter
[1:14:40] 24 Jeremiah speaks of figs as Israel and
[1:14:44] prophecy okay so since when you see the
[1:14:47] fig tree put forth which is Israel
[1:14:49] becoming a nation it says this
[1:14:51] generation shall not pass away till all
[1:14:54] be fulfilled so so the generation that
[1:14:56] sees Israel become a nation will not
[1:14:58] pass they'll be on the earth until all
[1:15:01] things be fulfilled right it's been 70 I
[1:15:04] don't know 70 years or I can't do math
[1:15:05] right now but however long it's been as
[1:15:07] well as being a nation a while
[1:15:09] and that and that generation is
[1:15:10] beginning to die off they're getting old
[1:15:12] oh we're at the end hallelujah right so
[1:15:16] likewise ye when you see these things
[1:15:18] come to pass know that the kingdom of
[1:15:20] God is nigh at hand
[1:15:21] verily I say unto you this generation
[1:15:23] shall not pass away till all be
[1:15:25] fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass
[1:15:27] away but my words shall not pass away
[1:15:29] now he says listen he says take heed of
[1:15:32] yourselves lease at any time your hearts
[1:15:34] be overcharged with surfeiting and
[1:15:37] drunkenness and the cares of this life
[1:15:39] so that they come upon you unawares so
[1:15:44] he says when when this begins to happen
[1:15:46] beware take heed of yourselves that your
[1:15:50] hearts your you know your emotional
[1:15:51] state how you think does not become
[1:15:53] overcharged with the cares of life amen
[1:15:58] what has happened in this hour got to
[1:16:02] improve i got a you know people come to
[1:16:05] a certain age

[1:16:58] has for you and weigh it up we don't
[1:17:01] even need to weigh it up because what is

[1:17:36] caught up in this whole Oh and then
[1:17:38] they'll and they'll throw away
[1:17:40] everything to move someplace and buy a
[1:17:42] house although you know and then they
[1:17:43] get all you and then people that's why
[1:17:45] there's so much you
[1:17:46] midlife crisis divorces and so on

[1:18:15] be caught up as I said we should not be
[1:18:18] caught up in the kids of this life sure
[1:18:20] Jesus could come right now afraid us
[1:18:24] because every we we really have every
[1:18:29] promise for the Gentiles as done I'm in
[1:18:33] the you know the Jews have gone back to
[1:18:34] the homeland they are promised

[1:19:38] glorious to me mm where he where he now
[1:19:41] he purchased his bride at Calvary now he
[1:19:43] comes to claim as bride that means
[1:19:45] that's why he stepped forth out of
[1:19:46] history to you hallelujah and he makes
[1:19:49] himself known to you because it says you
[1:19:51] are my precious possession and when I
[1:19:53] practice your Calvary now I'm going to
[1:19:55] clean you holy in order to claim you I'm
[1:19:57] going to strip the devil off of you
[1:19:59] I mean that you would know that you
[1:20:01] don't beloved to him I mean you never
[1:20:02] came from him hallelujah I belong to the
[1:20:05] Lord Jesus Christ hello that's why we
[1:20:07] can pray our Father which art in heaven
[1:20:09] hallowed be thy name and then you come
[1:20:11] out of your father I mean your birthday

[1:20:25] Satan I do not belong to this world they

[1:20:32] agreement between me and them hallelujah
[1:20:34] I trust is the same with you
[1:20:36] I'm bought with a price and that is the
[1:20:39] blood of Jesus Christ I am NOT my own
[1:20:41] the Bible says hallelujah maybe this is
[1:20:44] not like some divorce agreement where
[1:20:46] you can have them the weekend you can
[1:20:48] have them the week this is not how it
[1:20:49] works Jesus says they're mine give them
[1:20:52] up Satan by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:54] and he enforces his victory hallelujah
[1:20:56] God amen amen his blood he says he says
[1:21:01] that that first husband has done away
[1:21:02] with I mean that's why says the Apostle
[1:21:05] Paul says in the book of Romans yo one
[1:21:07] cannot be married to another while there
[1:21:09] are other spouse loose and he's speaking
[1:21:11] of a greater marriage and of all of the
[1:21:14] spiritual union of the Bride of Christ
[1:21:15] police say the person could not be
[1:21:18] united with Christ and be united with
[1:21:20] with the world holy that's why the Lord
[1:21:22] bear he he just comes in he may be a
[1:21:25] gentleman but he will not let us he you
[1:21:27] know there comes a time where he says
[1:21:29] Satan you're done you're done with this
[1:21:32] person you're done with them in their
[1:21:33] life let's come to an end I'm going to

[1:22:12] but the Bible says that goodness and
[1:22:14] mercy will follow us all the days of our
[1:22:15] life and that word follow actually means
[1:22:18] to pursue and overcome hallelujah so

[1:22:22] and mercy of God was chasing you amen
[1:22:25] and it overcame you hallelujah and you

[1:23:17] wouldn't you rather be a fish on his
[1:23:19] table Jesus said the kingdom of God is
[1:23:21] like a net that's cast out and it's
[1:23:24] pulled in a mint there's some there's
[1:23:27] some turtles and snakes and whatever
[1:23:29] more but is the fishies looking for

[1:23:33] be a prize fish on this table
[1:23:36] Alleluia I'm so glad the day I gave up
[1:23:42] glory to God now we're in first
[1:23:47] Corinthians 15 let's go
[1:23:51] amen now I love I love it held the Bible
[1:23:56] there's a generation where the promise
[1:24:00] is given but then there's a generation
[1:24:02] with the promises fulfilled and it's
[1:24:05] like Abraham would be promised in in the
[1:24:08] book of Genesis he said your seed will
[1:24:10] sojourn in a strange land for hundred
[1:24:12] years but after that time I will deliver
[1:24:15] them with a mighty hand and they'll come
[1:24:17] back to the you know to the promised
[1:24:19] land so the promise was given to Abraham
[1:24:21] but the fulfillment was in future
[1:24:24] generations and like many things the
[1:24:27] Apostle Paul would write win because we
[1:24:30] must understand when he wrote the
[1:24:32] promise of the rapture of he said we
[1:24:35] which are alive and remain so when I
[1:24:38] believed when he was inspired to write
[1:24:39] first Thessalonians 4 and 5 he went when
[1:24:43] he would write we he believed he was
[1:24:45] part of that group I mean that they did
[1:24:47] in Christ who already did but he was the
[1:24:49] alive in the rain but he didn't
[1:24:51] understand would be 2000 years I mean
[1:24:53] the promise was being given through the
[1:24:55] first church aid messenger but there
[1:24:57] were people that would fulfill they're
[1:24:59] alive and remain part hello you how you
[1:25:02] doing today hallelujah I trust you can
[1:25:05] see you know because we are living time
[1:25:07] where all scripture must be fulfilled
[1:25:09] Amen that they that the word that's been
[1:25:12] sitting there maybe even thousands of
[1:25:13] years it must become manifested in a
[1:25:16] people
[1:25:17] alleluiah we understand that there's
[1:25:19] some scriptures we will never fulfill I
[1:25:21] mean the bride will be never thrown into
[1:25:22] a lake of fire I mean she will not go
[1:25:24] through a tribulation hallelujah Amen we
[1:25:27] will not be burnt with the great horn
[1:25:29] here on the church systems
[1:25:31] that's not our fulfillment but our
[1:25:33] fulfillment is that she would be arrayed
[1:25:35] in fine linen clean and white and that's
[1:25:37] you right now that is the believer right
[1:25:40] now amen we are as he became sin that we
[1:25:43] would become the very righteousness of
[1:25:44] God through Christ Alleluia some you
[1:25:49] know there's some promises where the
[1:25:52] ephesian church if you read Ephesians
[1:25:54] chapter 4 you know the you know the
[1:25:56] Apostle Paul would place them yeah these
[1:25:58] are spiritual people but he comes to
[1:26:01] Ephesians chapter 4 and he says until we
[1:26:03] all grown to the fullness of the statue
[1:26:04] of Christ and to the perfect man so they
[1:26:08] were looking at becoming they had been
[1:26:10] birthed into the kingdom they're growing
[1:26:11] but they had to grow to become a fully
[1:26:13] mature Church now we understand that if
[1:26:16] you look at history they aimed at that
[1:26:17] but they relaxed and that slowly went
[1:26:20] down then it went into the dark ages
[1:26:21] amen you read you read Acts chapter 15
[1:26:24] there's already Pharisees there's
[1:26:26] already people who had come in among the
[1:26:28] believers that profess to be believers
[1:26:30] but they're still Pharisees they're
[1:26:32] still believing part of what they used
[1:26:33] to believe it's what had happening there
[1:26:35] was a full everyone was birthing the
[1:26:37] kingdom and you know and on the day of
[1:26:39] Pentecost there begin to drift even in
[1:26:42] amen now we are not ordained for that we
[1:26:49] are ordained to press onto the high
[1:26:51] calling in Christ and actually become a
[1:26:53] fully mature body amen
[1:26:58] so what so what Paul was writing the
[1:27:00] book of Ephesians it would become
[1:27:02] embodied in the people remember the word
[1:27:04] must put on flesh it has to put on flesh
[1:27:07] it's not it's got to be more than just
[1:27:09] quoted or put on your Instagram or
[1:27:12] Facebook or on your fridge but it has to
[1:27:14] become embodied the word must dwell in
[1:27:17] you and manifest now first Corinthians
[1:27:21] 15 now as I said he was looking at this
[1:27:29] and he believed that he is part of this
[1:27:31] he says behold I show you a mystery we
[1:27:35] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:27:37] changed we shall be transformed in a
[1:27:42] moment in a twinkling of an eye at the
[1:27:44] last Trump for the trumpet of God shall
[1:27:46] sound as did in Christ shall race
[1:27:48] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:27:50] he's putting himself in there we shall
[1:27:52] be changed for this incorruptible must
[1:27:54] put on incorruption and this mortal must
[1:27:57] put on immortality now this is a promise
[1:28:00] and it's been sitting there okay so when
[1:28:04] this corruptible must put on
[1:28:05] incorruption then this mortal shall put
[1:28:08] on immortality then shall be brought to
[1:28:11] pass the saying that is written death is
[1:28:14] swallowed up in victory hallelujah so
[1:28:17] now we're looking we're living in these
[1:28:19] moments where we are living in the
[1:28:22] scripture if this is a map I would say
[1:28:24] you're here amen we've come there is a
[1:28:27] people that are lifted off the earth
[1:28:28] before the Great Tribulation they there
[1:28:31] is a way of escape in this hour I mean
[1:28:34] there is an ark like in the days of Noah
[1:28:35] but the Ark is not a physical boat in
[1:28:37] this day it is Christ and Christ is his
[1:28:40] word Alleluia say well how do you get
[1:28:42] into the sack repent and be baptized
[1:28:44] name of Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:28:46] remission of sin and ye shall receive
[1:28:48] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:49] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:28:51] children amen hold on to that promise
[1:28:53] all of us with children amen you and
[1:28:56] your children those that are afar off
[1:28:58] and when I'm in Papua New Guinea I say
[1:29:00] even in Papua New Guinea and it's
[1:29:01] minutes the Lord our God shall call now
[1:29:04] that's the first that's the first sermon
[1:29:06] preached all day of Pentecost Acts
[1:29:08] chapter 2 did Peter get it wrong no when
[1:29:11] Jesus said the name baptize in the name
[1:29:13] one name Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:29:15] Peter gave the name Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:18] Alleluia that's Haigh into the ark now
[1:29:22] get the swallowed up in victory Oh death
[1:29:26] where is thy sting o grave where is thy
[1:29:28] victory the sting of death is sin and
[1:29:31] the strength of sin is the law but
[1:29:33] thanks be to God who give us the victory
[1:29:35] through our Lord Jesus Christ wherefore
[1:29:37] my beloved brethren be steadfast
[1:29:39] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:29:42] of the
[1:29:42] Lord for as much as you know that your
[1:29:44] labor is not in vain in the Lord amen
[1:29:48] that's why we should be steadfast we are
[1:29:50] not following currently devised fables
[1:29:52] of men I mean we are not following
[1:29:54] something that's been hatched up in a
[1:29:56] seminary or an or in some Bible school
[1:29:59] or even in Jeffersonville or someplace
[1:30:01] Amen but we are following the vindicated
[1:30:03] Word of God we are following the proven
[1:30:06] Word of God hallelujah
[1:30:08] have we not Amen was the testimony it's
[1:30:11] evidence that this is a life I mean like
[1:30:14] a testimony in court you give a
[1:30:15] testimony I was there I saw this amen
[1:30:18] and we can stand and say I can give
[1:30:21] testimony that this is truth as promises
[1:30:24] of truth and it does transform me
[1:30:26] Alleluia and it has brought me this far
[1:30:29] it's going to take me to heaven I mean
[1:30:31] because my faith is not in not in
[1:30:33] something other than the written word of
[1:30:36] God because if you have genuine faith in
[1:30:38] this word it will manifest and prove it
[1:30:40] in your life
[1:30:41] glory to God amen
[1:30:44] and that's why we can rejoice this
[1:30:47] message that we've embraced reveals
[1:30:49] Jesus Christ in this Bible I admit it's
[1:30:52] not another testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:30:53] and as the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:30:56] Alleluia so that's why we should be
[1:30:58] steadfast our labor is not in vain
[1:31:01] amen so how we raise up remember our
[1:31:03] whole energies our whole energies should
[1:31:06] be number one
[1:31:10] honey spouse honey husband whatever
[1:31:13] we're gonna serve the Lord we're going
[1:31:16] in a rapture the Lord has promised us an
[1:31:19] eternal home amen an eternal home and
[1:31:23] he's given us the ability to get there
[1:31:25] I mean before he puts it me but God
[1:31:27] doesn't enforce something upon a people
[1:31:29] without giving them first away to do it
[1:31:32] hallelujah Amen just like in the Old
[1:31:35] Testament kill the slam this shed blood
[1:31:38] I want to have fellowship with you he
[1:31:41] didn't leave them to work it out he says
[1:31:42] this is how you do it I've given you a
[1:31:45] prophet that gave you the word I gave
[1:31:46] you a priesthood that they can stand
[1:31:48] between you and you and me I gave you a
[1:31:50] sacrifice that covers your sin amen
[1:31:53] and then when Jesus stood and said be
[1:31:55] perfect
[1:31:56] even as our Father in heaven is perfect
[1:31:58] now it's not like wool how we're gonna
[1:32:01] do it let's have a committee meeting
[1:32:03] let's work out how we can be perfect
[1:32:04] that's not how it worked out he makes
[1:32:07] you perfect by his offering by his blood
[1:32:09] by one offering he's perfected for you
[1:32:12] and then them that are sanctified
[1:32:14] hallelujah amen hey we're maturing we're
[1:32:17] growing so this there's perfection as in
[1:32:20] sinless perfection and his perfection as
[1:32:22] in mature as long as we're growing make

[1:32:40] going Jesus stop the cross to take us to
[1:32:43] heaven and we love Him that's why we
[1:32:47] serve Him because we love him not
[1:32:49] because of any other thing why do we do
[1:32:51] this daddy we love him he's so good to
[1:32:54] us
[1:32:55] hallelujah took our sin our way
[1:32:57] revealed himself to us we weren't
[1:33:00] looking for him doesn't matter if you're
[1:33:02] religious up to your eyeballs he's gotta
[1:33:04] beat you Alleluia
[1:33:06] why is it you know that should be oh

[1:33:12] remember you create an atmosphere in
[1:33:14] your home you gonna be the only one like

[1:33:18] she believed the angels message no one
[1:33:22] no one was rejoicing with her all of
[1:33:25] Nazareth didn't erupt saying glory the
[1:33:27] Messiah is coming I mean they weren't
[1:33:30] rejoicing even Joseph that loved her in
[1:33:32] a sad Center I'm just gonna have to put
[1:33:35] her away privately he didn't understand
[1:33:37] what was going on until the same angel
[1:33:39] meet him in a dream but she believed she
[1:33:44] believed hallelujah and she didn't have
[1:33:48] a whole church backing her up she didn't

[1:36:30] wanted to read it I say at 25 and we
[1:36:39] read from verse 5 down to verse 9 thou
[1:36:51] shall bring down the noise of strangers
[1:36:53] as the heat in a dry place even the heat
[1:36:57] with the shadow of a cloud the branch of
[1:37:00] the terrible ones shall be brought low
[1:37:02] and in this mountain shall the Lord of
[1:37:05] hosts make and to all people a feast of
[1:37:08] fat things a feast of wines on the lease
[1:37:11] effect things full of marrow of wines on
[1:37:15] the Leeds well refined and he will
[1:37:17] destroy in this mountain the face of the
[1:37:20] covering cast over all the people the
[1:37:23] veil that is spread over all nations now
[1:37:28] Moses this is just me this is just in
[1:37:30] fellowship as brother Johnny DeMuth
[1:37:31] would say there's a veil put over the
[1:37:34] juice when they read the law because
[1:37:37] they are ordained they were they wrote
[1:37:40] they were blinded that the Gentiles
[1:37:41] could come and amen and but all the true
[1:37:45] Jews from Calvary to now will be there
[1:37:47] cuz cuz God blinded them but there is a
[1:37:50] very spiritual veil over the whole world
[1:37:54] amen there's a veil of tradition a min
[1:37:58] is a veil of unbelief but he says that
[1:38:01] them on this mountain I believe this is
[1:38:02] mountains I mean this just mean
[1:38:04] Fellowship's you can take it or leave it
[1:38:05] whatever you want to do right
[1:38:07] see see say the people on this mountain
[1:38:09] Mount Zion that's where we've come to
[1:38:11] yeah we don't have time to read Hebrews
[1:38:12] chapter 12 but Paul says the Apostle
[1:38:15] Paul's you have not come to Mount Sinai
[1:38:17] where you know you know we'd God gave
[1:38:19] the law and no one could could approach
[1:38:21] even you know come on the mountain they
[1:38:23] said be thrust through with a dart God
[1:38:25] came down there's a separation between
[1:38:27] the people and God he says you have not
[1:38:29] come unto that mountain but you've come
[1:38:31] unto the Mount Zion I'm into two
[1:38:34] and an innumerable company of angels
[1:38:36] that's why I said there's so much more
[1:38:38] in here hallelujah we've come to this
[1:38:40] place I mean where spiritual realm was
[1:38:42] opened up hallelujah
[1:38:44] they seize to the spirits of just men
[1:38:46] made perfect amen
[1:38:48] isn't it glad hey this body's going to
[1:38:50] be redeemed but the spirits have just
[1:38:52] been made perfect that's you hallelujah
[1:38:54] and answer Jesus I'm just quoting the
[1:38:57] you know just go read Hebrews I believe
[1:38:59] it is 12 I mean the media the the
[1:39:01] mediator of the new covenant so he says
[1:39:03] now the people on this mountain I'll
[1:39:05] destroy and I'll destroy in this mount
[1:39:07] in the face the covering cast over all
[1:39:09] the people the veil that has spread over
[1:39:11] all nations now there's been a
[1:39:14] traditional veil the devil what he tries
[1:39:17] to do as he gives false doctrine to the
[1:39:19] people I mean that the people will not
[1:39:22] believe the truth and it takes the life
[1:39:25] away it takes eternal life at vales
[1:39:28] eternal life from the people right jesus
[1:39:31] said by teaching the commandments and
[1:39:33] doctrines of men you make the Word of
[1:39:34] God no effect and what was the what was
[1:39:37] the word what was the law men to do I'm
[1:39:39] gonna cover your sins by the blood of
[1:39:42] bulls and goats until the Redeemer comes
[1:39:44] and wipes all the dead away I mean that
[1:39:47] was the purpose of the look they said by
[1:39:49] teaching the commandments and doctrines
[1:39:50] of men you make the Word of God no
[1:39:52] effect and so there's a traditional veil
[1:39:55] but in this day that veil has been
[1:39:58] renting to Alleluia that we are not
[1:40:01] looking at this Bible and saying what
[1:40:04] does it mean hello we should say
[1:40:07] hallelujah I mean we're not looking and
[1:40:10] saying I don't know if it is he 3:5 18
[1:40:13] how many gods are there is one
[1:40:15] manifested in three different offices
[1:40:18] Alleluia how do we baptize it's clear I
[1:40:21] mean how were you know all the mysteries
[1:40:24] of the Bible have come open what does
[1:40:26] God like was he doesn't like it's been
[1:40:28] has been manifested let's become Rick
[1:40:31] right so that veil we see God as he
[1:40:33] really is Allu you it means that the
[1:40:36] veils been taken out okay
[1:40:38] the the veil that has spread over all
[1:40:39] the nations he will swallow up death and
[1:40:42] victory and the Lord God will wipe away
[1:40:44] tears from off all faces
[1:40:47] and the rebuke of his people shall he
[1:40:48] take away from all the earth for the
[1:40:51] Lord has spoken it and it shall be said
[1:40:55] in that day lo this is our God we have
[1:40:58] waited for him and he will save us this
[1:41:00] is the Lord we have waited for him we
[1:41:02] will be glad and rejoice in his
[1:41:05] salvation
[1:41:07] Alleluia so this is where the Apostle
[1:41:10] Paul would take the scripture death has
[1:41:13] swallowed up in victory
[1:41:14] the veils been taken away amen
[1:41:17] we know who the Lord is this is not out
[1:41:20] of an arrogant weight God has revealed
[1:41:21] himself to us and not just here but
[1:41:23] around the world there's people almost
[1:41:25] everywhere Alleluia where there where
[1:41:28] where the Apostle Paul would go and meet
[1:41:30] Peter after a thing about 15 years after
[1:41:33] the road to Damascus experience and they
[1:41:35] sat down and they begin to talk they
[1:41:37] hadn't met each other until now they
[1:41:39] found out that preaching the same thing
[1:41:40] I mean because the same God that met had
[1:41:43] met both of them hallelujah amen so they
[1:41:47] knew exactly that took well this shall
[1:41:52] be swallowed up in victory we are living
[1:41:55] in the time of the change of the body
[1:41:57] amen
[1:41:58] we are a people in order to be
[1:42:00] physically resurrected right we have to
[1:42:04] be spiritually resurrected first and to
[1:42:06] be resurrected us to be made alive I
[1:42:08] mean to be quickened I mean so there has
[1:42:11] to be a people I believe I'm looking at
[1:42:12] them today amen that have become
[1:42:14] spiritually alive in Jesus Christ I mean
[1:42:17] that they have been resurrected
[1:42:20] hallelujah and that is the proof that
[1:42:22] this is reality this is the proof that
[1:42:25] this message is reality amen because he
[1:42:28] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:42:30] I mean so where he is he is the
[1:42:32] resurrection and the life
[1:42:34] hallelujah where where when he went to
[1:42:36] Lazarus tomb that day you know we said
[1:42:38] to me real Martha I am the resurrection
[1:42:40] and the life if he didn't call Lazarus
[1:42:44] by name there would have been a general
[1:42:46] resurrection right there and then
[1:42:49] Alleluia
[1:42:50] so now if he is the resurrection in the
[1:42:53] life where he is death cannot stay amen
[1:42:58] every time he went past a funeral
[1:43:00] you reading the Gospels the person
[1:43:02] didn't stay did Amen hallelujah he
[1:43:06] raised him from the dead now his spirit
[1:43:10] is still among us quickening his word to
[1:43:14] make people life
[1:43:15] hello amen we have been resurrected and
[1:43:20] brother Bram says the sign of the
[1:43:22] resurrection in the end time is a people
[1:43:26] that have been resurrected I mean the
[1:43:28] believer becomes the site of the
[1:43:30] resurrection
[1:43:31] amen because the things they once were
[1:43:33] they did too and they are now alive in
[1:43:36] Christ and men to the things that were
[1:43:38] once under bondage true whether it was
[1:43:40] was drugs or smokey or the world or
[1:43:42] popularity or whatever it was I mean
[1:43:44] that thing is dead
[1:43:46] hallelujah a new creature you become a
[1:43:48] new creature in Christ I mean this
[1:43:51] message is transforming power hallelujah
[1:43:54] that's why that's why I'm this you know
[1:43:56] you know that's why in this age we have
[1:43:58] brother bear him here and he would and
[1:44:02] the Lord would open the word to show us
[1:44:05] this is Jesus in his word amen
[1:44:08] it's not houki spooks amen he it shows
[1:44:11] Jesus Christ in here and it said now
[1:44:14] that same life that was back there it's
[1:44:18] now present the angel of the Lord that
[1:44:21] was there in the prophets ministry it's
[1:44:24] still alive today amen
[1:44:27] the same God it's not a different God
[1:44:28] it's not a different one it's not a
[1:44:31] different God to the one in the Bible
[1:44:33] you say you've gone off now they said
[1:44:35] Jesus went off at the end amen just
[1:44:39] using modern modern terminology oh he
[1:44:41] went off he was doing real good being a
[1:44:43] prophet of Nazareth and raising the dead
[1:44:45] healing the sick but then he began to
[1:44:47] claim by Messiah that's the that's the
[1:44:49] reason he came into the world I went off
[1:44:51] with E and he got crucified amen because
[1:44:54] he were getting to declare I am he and
[1:44:56] then now you have a little man stand
[1:44:58] here in this generation and he began to
[1:45:02] show Jesus Christ in his word and they
[1:45:04] said well he was good when he healed the
[1:45:06] sick and discerned the sort you know
[1:45:08] thoughts and tends to the heart but then
[1:45:10] when he began to show what the truth of
[1:45:12] the Bible was now he's got off at the
[1:45:14] end
[1:45:14] no hasn't gone off at the end I don't
[1:45:16] know why I'm going down this way but
[1:45:17] here we are
[1:45:17] but it's the that was the resurrection I
[1:45:21] mean there's been a quickening come
[1:45:24] hello you say I have experienced their
[1:45:27] quickening I mean I am NOT the person I
[1:45:30] once was I have not just become
[1:45:33] religious I have not just joined a
[1:45:35] church amen but the same God we're gonna
[1:45:38] go back to the Apostle Paul now there's
[1:45:40] same God that met the Apostle Paul has
[1:45:42] met me hallelujah and so now you become
[1:45:47] the sign of the resurrection to the
[1:45:49] earth amen the believer he said well
[1:45:53] that's all very kind of underwhelming no
[1:45:56] it's not you look at no you gotta look
[1:45:58] at spiritually what the believer is we
[1:46:01] are not just mentally I'm a new creature
[1:46:03] you actually resurrected you're not dead
[1:46:07] in trespasses and sins anymore amen
[1:46:10] this is what because ultimately people
[1:46:14] talk about Calvary but we should
[1:46:16] actually wanted Calvary produce I mean
[1:46:19] what does Calvary produce because if
[1:46:22] Calvary happened and I know it happened
[1:46:24] then it would produce a people that are
[1:46:27] now alive in Christ I mean they've been
[1:46:30] delivered from dead works of the flesh
[1:46:31] and of man I mean they no longer have a
[1:46:34] sin nature which just cause them to live
[1:46:36] in the world
[1:46:36] I remember they've been resurrected
[1:46:38] above those things hallelujah that's
[1:46:41] what Calvary what is the blood Dome
[1:46:43] what does it mean I'm now washed by the
[1:46:45] blood Oh what what you once were you not
[1:46:49] anymore I mean you say this is very
[1:46:52] elementary no there is a power in the
[1:46:54] word is a pair on the word to overcome
[1:46:57] all temptation there's a power in the
[1:46:58] words to overcome all sin and I'm going
[1:47:01] to finish with this thought there's a
[1:47:02] power
[1:47:03] Amen in the world to overcome every
[1:47:05] devil amen you can understand Satan is
[1:47:08] not your master his works are not meant
[1:47:11] to be your master amen you do not have
[1:47:14] to you know the devil lies to people you
[1:47:16] see young people they sit in church and
[1:47:18] they play survivor Church if I can just
[1:47:20] outlast this the devil says wait a bit
[1:47:21] longer wait a bit longer
[1:47:23] you don't have to listen you don't have
[1:47:25] to give you a life you don't have to
[1:47:26] give yourself and that's the
[1:47:28] line to them and then they grow up and
[1:47:30] they come to about 40 and the devil
[1:47:31] lights them again are you've got to
[1:47:33] relive your dream you were going to do
[1:47:34] this you were to do this and they have a
[1:47:36] midlife crisis
[1:47:37] what is it the devil's been lying the
[1:47:39] whole time what happens people were born
[1:47:41] the devil begins to lie to them when
[1:47:42] they come to the age of accountability
[1:47:43] you don't have to give you a life you
[1:47:45] can just float along you can just hide
[1:47:47] in church your camouflage no one sees
[1:47:50] you God sees you you can't hide from him
[1:47:53] and then and then the devil says just
[1:47:56] wait a little bit longer than I say I'll
[1:47:58] wait a bit longer and then they come to
[1:48:00] about teenage years the world opens up
[1:48:02] to them and bushing comes in you can be
[1:48:05] anything you want you can but there's
[1:48:09] one thing I want to be I want to be an
[1:48:13] eternity hallelujah I want to be found
[1:48:17] in his righteousness amen and that
[1:48:21] people continue on in the devil lies
[1:48:23] lies lies lies lies and off they go well
[1:48:26] who did they listen to this the service
[1:48:29] has gone a very different way but here
[1:48:30] we are just don't listen to the devil's
[1:48:34] life he says just wait a little bit
[1:48:37] longer you don't really have to
[1:48:39] surrender everything he will give you
[1:48:42] the devil will give you a good family he
[1:48:45] will give you a good church he'll give
[1:48:47] you good ministry and good music he will
[1:48:50] he will offer the world to you but
[1:48:53] without a real birth amen he will give
[1:48:56] you all those things and that is that is
[1:48:59] living below your privilege remember
[1:49:02] Satan is meant to be under your feet he
[1:49:06] is not he will always come in the veil
[1:49:08] of religion ultimately and him say just
[1:49:12] serve this the Apostle Paul he was
[1:49:16] actually serving all said it may be very
[1:49:17] strong but the scribes and Pharisees
[1:49:20] they crucified our Lord Jesus who was
[1:49:23] anointed named Satan Satan anointed them
[1:49:26] did they crucify the Prince of life so
[1:49:29] the Apostle Paul was actually serving
[1:49:31] Satan in that system
[1:49:34] I mean where the allegro he was serving
[1:49:36] sated in that system he had to become
[1:49:39] quick and he had to become a life the
[1:49:40] devil was going to give him a kingdom
[1:49:42] you can be the Bible teacher of Bible
[1:49:45] teachers because the devil took his
[1:49:47] ambition was going to take him there I
[1:49:49] mean but God wants to take your ambition
[1:49:52] and take you to heaven hallelujah
[1:49:55] it's your choice what do you want
[1:49:59] don't just be religious people can
[1:50:02] receive a religious spirit that's the
[1:50:04] hardest one to break because people
[1:50:06] justify themselves but I'm religious I
[1:50:08] do this I can quote this I can do this I
[1:50:10] mean they could be living like the devil
[1:50:12] I mean that's living below your
[1:50:15] privilege amen oh this is a bit strong
[1:50:18] no Christ came to deliver us amen that
[1:50:22] he we become love prisoners to him
[1:50:25] I mean but we see Jesus hallelujah Jesus
[1:50:30] came to set the captives free
[1:50:32] only can we have some musicians to come
[1:50:36] don't live below your privilege they're
[1:50:39] children of Israel we're living as
[1:50:42] slaves they had a choice they could run
[1:50:49] back when the pressure came on they were
[1:50:54] used to being slaves in Egypt their
[1:50:56] daddies were slaves their granddaddy's
[1:50:58] were slaves but then they got taken out
[1:51:01] of slavery one day an angel came spoke
[1:51:05] to a man in a burning bush go down and
[1:51:08] set my people free
[1:51:10] they weren't slaves in the eyes of God
[1:51:12] Satan saw the most slaves they got
[1:51:16] lifted up out of slavery then now
[1:51:18] pressure came on let's go back to Egypt
[1:51:22] let's go back there they forgot that the
[1:51:25] Egyptians were wanted to kill killed all
[1:51:29] of the boys why the Moses end up and end
[1:51:32] up in a basket gonna wipe out this race
[1:51:37] you with me gonna wipe out this race I
[1:51:40] think so they wanted to go back to that
[1:51:43] they wanted to go back to that because
[1:51:45] of a slave mentality that was below
[1:51:47] their privilege they could have been
[1:51:50] they could have talked to each other and
[1:51:51] said we've never been free before and
[1:51:55] the devil would have come to them and
[1:51:56] said you've always been slaves
[1:51:57] you got a slave nature get a slave
[1:52:00] mentality and he anointed them let's go
[1:52:02] back to slavery that's not what God had
[1:52:05] for them amen
[1:52:07] that's the same thing with us we're not
[1:52:10] called because people I know you said
[1:52:12] you know people sit in church and the
[1:52:14] devil comes to them you've never been
[1:52:16] free you've never been victorious
[1:52:18] you think you can overcome this you
[1:52:20] think you think God can save your family
[1:52:23] hasn't happened yet it's not gonna
[1:52:25] happen now hello who's been there and
[1:52:28] sometimes we've begun to agree because
[1:52:32] you haven't seen it happen well who are
[1:52:34] you listening to Joshua and Caleb said
[1:52:38] let's go take the land
[1:52:39] I mean we're more than able he's made us
[1:52:42] able hallelujah well I don't know if it
[1:52:45] can be done by the authority God's Word
[1:52:48] it can be done hallelujah
[1:52:51] don't be weary and don't be discouraged
[1:52:53] throw your duck doubt your doubts I mean
[1:52:57] because the devil knows if he could just
[1:52:58] lit your if God breaks his grip if God
[1:53:02] can break the Satan's grip off your life
[1:53:05] he doesn't know what to do with you
[1:53:07] brother Bram said a man can so be
[1:53:10] surrender to God that the devil don't
[1:53:12] even know what to do with us hallelujah
[1:53:15] and that's got to become flesh and
[1:53:16] people I mean so don't don't look at
[1:53:19] your past
[1:53:20] Jesus took care of your past I've never
[1:53:24] seen it happen I tell you these many
[1:53:28] things he's becoming you sorry but yeah
[1:53:32] Maggie's down but you know you become a
[1:53:34] new believer you begin to read promises
[1:53:36] of the word I've never seen that happen
[1:53:40] it's like healing supernatural healing
[1:53:42] before it happens to you say I've never
[1:53:45] seen that happen before I've never seen
[1:53:47] someone ask me fill with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:48] because when you become a new believer
[1:53:50] then God says I'll show you a menu just
[1:53:53] taken me this word you say Lord I want
[1:53:55] to see this happen he says I will show
[1:53:58] you
[1:53:59] Alleluia don't be discouraged don't be
[1:54:05] up and down well I don't feel it
[1:54:07] brother Brown no Jesus I'll say brother
[1:54:10] brems said it too but jesus said he
[1:54:11] didn't say do you feel it when people
[1:54:14] came to be healed
[1:54:15] he never said do you feel it are you
[1:54:18] happy now they said hey do you feel like
[1:54:20] you're gonna take a rapturous
[1:54:22] know do you believe it and we have to
[1:54:26] throw away sometimes we're going to
[1:54:27] throw away how we feel you say well how
[1:54:31] do you feel when you pray to God prayed
[1:54:32] for I felt you know don't go by the
[1:54:35] feeling because it always be this will
[1:54:37] how it'll be is like this yeah you know
[1:54:40] the devil anoints yo comes you and says
[1:54:42] you got to feel like you're on some
[1:54:43] plane and once you get to that plane of
[1:54:46] greatness then you got then the Lord
[1:54:48] will answer your prayers and it's always
[1:54:51] too high you can never obtain it and you
[1:54:55] just get this boy because he's dangling
[1:54:56] a carrot that doesn't exist just like
[1:54:59] any promise in the Bible he's dead
[1:55:01] because it dangled it and you can never
[1:55:03] catch it and he just moves it as you
[1:55:05] jump low because but you start running
[1:55:10] down that way and you get discouraged
[1:55:13] but it's faith in the word brings the
[1:55:15] promise not how you feel it's faith in
[1:55:18] the word Amen Jesus came
[1:55:22] Amen to give his faith in you so it's
[1:55:25] not how you feel that's why the Word of
[1:55:27] God separates between the spirit and the
[1:55:29] soul I mean to take away the spirit yo
[1:55:32] sure this feeling if you say you love
[1:55:34] someone don't feel it it's not real love
[1:55:36] Amen but faith is more than a feeling so
[1:55:42] don't go by feelings necessarily I've
[1:55:45] prayed for things felt dear as a post
[1:55:47] and I've seen it happen because God
[1:55:50] wants to show you it's not how you feel
[1:55:52] it's do you believe it and there's more
[1:55:55] than a feeling but I believe in a
[1:55:58] heartfelt religion Alleluia I mean less
