[24:35] [Music]
[24:56] we have an item this morning from
[24:57] brother um
[25:16] thank you
[25:18] god bless you
[25:21] i forgot my classes now
[25:23] lately i forget them
[25:26] and
[25:27] i don't know what's the meaning of that
[25:29] but i think the meaning is that
[25:31] that i must not use them
[25:37] i'm glad to see each one of you
[25:39] so the song the song that i'm going to
[25:41] sing
[25:42] relates to also what brother isaac
[25:44] the other the other uh
[25:47] stanza that spoke about
[25:49] a fire on the day of pentecost
[25:52] so
[25:53] if maybe sister tell you i've i've trans
[25:55] my wife translated not me
[25:58] my wife helped me to translate it
[26:00] just for you to follow what it means um
[26:04] or you know that's the closest
[26:05] translation we could get but i'll sing
[26:07] it in my mother
[26:08] tongue and because i believe god is not
[26:11] limited by language
[26:13] language barrier those are the things of
[26:15] the devil
[26:17] language barrier is the things of the
[26:19] devil that's why we can speak of
[26:20] heavenly tongues here and the spirit of
[26:23] the lord just makes us one language amen
[26:25] there was there was only one language
[26:26] before they went to the to the tower of
[26:28] bible isn't it
[26:31] sorry i'm not preaching
[26:32] um
[26:34] so
[26:35] thank you for that song that stanza that
[26:38] that spoke about uh pentecostal fire
[26:41] because this song
[26:44] when that pentecostal fire
[26:46] you know splashed when it splashed and
[26:48] bursted some of the sparks
[26:51] fell there in africa somewhere
[26:54] some of those parks they fell and landed
[26:56] somewhere in africa and that's where
[26:58] some of these songs that i'm seeing now
[27:00] emanated from those missionaries went
[27:03] out there although they had some
[27:05] ulterior motive some of them but some i
[27:07] believe they were guided by god
[27:09] because this kind of songs could not
[27:11] just come from the devil
[27:13] and that's why i'm here today because of
[27:15] those kind of
[27:17] inspirations amen so the song
[27:19] if kira can help me i just told him
[27:22] hardly this morning
[27:24] so
[27:24] if the boy can't play it well just bear
[27:26] with him but i believe
[27:28] he can catch the inspiration
[27:30] it says saying
[27:32] oh
[27:35] [Music]
[27:46] a
[27:55] [Music]
[28:13] [Music]
[28:18] [Music]
[28:38] [Music]
[28:52] [Music]
[28:59] [Music]
[29:23] oh
[29:35] [Music]
[30:04] [Music]
[30:09] [Applause]
[30:19] is that quite an old song brother
[30:20] brother-in-po yeah very old
[30:23] okay then that's got the six eight one
[30:25] two three one two three that
[30:29] the time tempo you know
[30:32] they say that maybe i think the amazing
[30:33] grace tune was actually an african tune
[30:36] for me because it's
[30:38] me
[30:38] [Music]
[30:41] because the guy that wrote the song
[30:42] didn't put the tune to the words he just
[30:43] wrote the words
[30:44] but they say that it was an african
[30:47] tune
[30:52] um let's stand this morning and just
[30:53] sing some worship songs to the lord
[30:55] amen

[50:29] just want to um
[50:31] we want to read now but we all know the
[50:32] scripture so we don't need to turn in

[51:07] that what he did back there he does now
[51:09] he doesn't change his ways amen and
[51:12] he'll forever be the same he's
[51:13] consistent amen who believes that this
[51:16] morning that jesus christ is consistent
[51:18] and he loves you and if you meet the
[51:20] same conditions by believing his word
[51:22] like the saints of old did you'll get
[51:24] the same results amen if your life
[51:27] reflects the life in the book of acts
[51:28] you will have a book of acts written in
[51:30] your life it doesn't matter where you
[51:32] come from it doesn't matter what your
[51:34] family lineage is it doesn't matter what
[51:36] limitations you think is on your life
[51:38] that the blood of jesus christ brings an
[51:40] annulment to your old nature the
[51:43] marriage to that old man that old
[51:44] husband of fear terror lust whatever it
[51:48] may be that's held you down it is time
[51:50] for an exodus it is time for a divorce

[51:55] house
[51:57] the blood of jesus is here speaking
[52:00] liberty over your lives speaking freedom
[52:03] don't look at the natural look at the
[52:05] promise
[52:07] jesus christ comes riding out of history
[52:10] out of the pages of the scripture
[52:12] into your life to fulfill his promises
[52:16] so that you can have a book of acts
[52:18] that you become a book of acts
[52:20] you want to see miracles

[52:31] like that amen if you want to see
[52:33] miracles who wants to see the miracle

[52:50] little foundation and then we'll get
[52:52] into it
[52:54] the key to a supernatural life
[52:56] the key to a supernatural walk now of
[52:58] course there's many keys and there's
[53:00] many different ways um that we can but

[53:04] today we'll just be blessed by that amen
[53:06] if you pull and and you have faith then
[53:08] you'll get what you need if you ever
[53:10] need this morning let it just just pull
[53:12] on the lord and he will meet that need
[53:14] hallelujah whatever is in your life that
[53:16] you need deliverance healing restoration
[53:19] guidance whatever you need of
[53:22] just pull god will meet your need this
[53:24] morning because as peter spoke the words
[53:26] the holy ghost fell upon them amen why
[53:29] because they were under expectation
[53:31] man there's an atmosphere in here today
[53:34] hallelujah you know the founding
[53:36] scriptural basis for our claims to a
[53:38] supernatural experience i find in john
[53:40] 14 12 it says jesus speaking verily
[53:43] verily i say unto you he that believeth
[53:45] on me the works that i do shall he do
[53:48] also
[53:49] who believes that
[53:51] amen who's read the gospels

[53:56] amen hallelujah he went to funerals and
[53:58] turned them into parties hallelujah he
[54:00] turned death into life amen he even was
[54:04] killed himself and rose again amen he
[54:06] conquered death hell in the grave
[54:08] amen he healed the sick amen he raised
[54:11] the dead he cleansed the lepers he set
[54:14] the captives free
[54:16] if you believe
[54:18] the same things will happen in your life
[54:20] don't look at yourself
[54:22] don't look at your own limitations oh
[54:24] i'm this and that and everything else no
[54:26] don't look at that look at the promise
[54:28] he that believes
[54:30] she that believes
[54:32] amen and every now that people might
[54:34] tell you oh you don't believe because
[54:36] you've got unbelief you've been given a
[54:38] measure of faith
[54:39] he dealt to every man a measure of faith
[54:42] amen who's a human in here

[54:55] pumpkin

[54:59] life
[55:00] that's the faith of the son of god
[55:03] amen and you just have the right
[55:04] attitude towards his word and you watch
[55:06] god's faith take over
[55:08] you watch his faith come on our little
[55:10] faith is just but when we reach up and
[55:12] his faith comes down there is nothing
[55:15] impossible
[55:16] the omnipotent and the omnipotent bring
[55:18] forth the creative power
[55:21] amen
[55:22] hallelujah
[55:25] and greater work shall he do than these

[55:35] glorified in the sun

[55:45] somewhere
[55:47] i've got a few questions here that we

[55:52] way for us to always walk supernaturally

[56:37] quite refreshed on this because brother
[56:39] adrian just preached on these things so
[56:41] amen you can just remember it's the same
[56:42] thought okay but more more perfect by a
[56:46] greater and more perfect tabernacle
[56:49] not made with hands that is to say not
[56:51] of this building it's talking about
[56:52] christ jesus in his flesh the true
[56:54] temple neither by the blood of goats and
[56:57] calves but by his own blood

[57:02] having obtained eternal redemption for
[57:05] us
[57:07] amen for if the blood of bulls and of
[57:09] goats and of ashes of and here for
[57:11] sprinkling the unclean in the old
[57:12] testament judaic sacrificial system
[57:15] sanctified to the purifying of their
[57:17] flesh

[57:21] shall the blood of christ
[57:24] who through the eternal spirit offered
[57:27] himself without spot to god purge your
[57:29] conscience

[57:36] believe what my blood can do for you
[57:39] you might be struggling but believe what
[57:40] my blood can do for you
[57:42] believe the liberation that comes from
[57:44] the voice of god oh my lord the blood
[57:47] speaks
[57:48] the bible says the blood speaks in
[57:49] hebrews 12. better things than that of
[57:51] abel
[57:52] it speaks freedom liberty restoration
[57:55] the dead being raised it speaks a
[57:57] resurrection it speaks a rapture it

[58:59] the spirit
[59:00] the conscience of god will come upon you
[59:03] and you'll hear the voice
[59:05] begin to burst something in you
[59:08] commission you place you
[59:10] hallelujah i said i wasn't going to
[59:11] preach these words these scriptures but
[59:14] romans 8 1
[59:16] hallelujah
[59:18] glory there's a lot of inspiration in
[59:20] that one how much more the blood of
[59:22] christ who through eternal spirit
[59:23] offered himself without spot to god
[59:25] purge your conscience from dead works to
[59:27] serve the living god
[59:29] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[59:32] the new testament
[59:34] that by means of death for the
[59:35] redemption of the transgressions
[59:38] that were under the first testament
[59:40] hallelujah
[59:41] they which are called might receive the
[59:44] promise of internal inherent eternal
[59:46] inheritance
[59:47] for where the testament is
[59:49] the testament is the voice of the new
[59:52] testament
[59:53] everything that came out and is written
[59:55] by paul and james and all of them and
[59:57] the voice of god that would speak
[59:59] freedom and liberty the voice of the
[1:00:00] blood the testament the bible
[1:00:03] came out of the blood
[1:00:05] amen and and you know in the in the lord
[1:00:08] when uh will because he had a will and
[1:00:10] an inheritance that would be given to
[1:00:12] the people
[1:00:13] and and say to your rich uncle or your
[1:00:15] dad or someone they pass away and and
[1:00:17] they've got a rich
[1:00:19] bank account and a huge
[1:00:20] house and manner
[1:00:22] and and it's to you
[1:00:23] now now when they die there's a lawyer
[1:00:26] that comes
[1:00:27] and he bequeaths that to you saying this
[1:00:30] is the will this is what he willed to
[1:00:32] you he wanted you to have this it's an
[1:00:34] inheritance and so when he's passed on
[1:00:37] or they've gone then their voice still
[1:00:39] speaks through the cleaving agent
[1:00:42] through the lawyer and they give you the
[1:00:44] inheritance and you take it and then you
[1:00:46] go and use it and you enjoy it amen but
[1:00:49] this is a different one because the very
[1:00:51] one that died for you he rose again and
[1:00:54] now he's here to give it to you to
[1:00:57] ensure that you get it
[1:00:59] amen amen get in the spirit
[1:01:02] this is the keys to a supernatural walk
[1:01:04] you want supernatural
[1:01:06] who's sickened the devil just running
[1:01:08] rampant and letting things happen to
[1:01:10] children and letting things happen to
[1:01:12] you and your family you say why
[1:01:14] oh god i want to just have such a great
[1:01:17] standing in your presence
[1:01:19] where when i speak it happens
[1:01:21] this is our destiny
[1:01:23] not too many days hints that will be in
[1:01:25] full measure
[1:01:26] start claiming it now
[1:01:30] that's the truth start fighting for it
[1:01:33] hallelujah
[1:01:35] because the battle's already won for you
[1:01:37] but just like israel they still had to
[1:01:39] take up a sword
[1:01:40] and capture every demon
[1:01:42] they cut through humans but we cut
[1:01:44] through demons
[1:01:45] hallelujah hallelujah israel stayed in
[1:01:48] the natural they rejected the messiah
[1:01:50] but our war is against the devils
[1:01:52] but control the people
[1:01:54] hallelujah and you've got great
[1:01:55] authority over those things
[1:01:58] hallelujah amen
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:02] hallelujah
[1:02:04] so just remember
[1:02:05] the voice of the blood speaks but the
[1:02:07] very testator himself doesn't need
[1:02:09] another lawyer
[1:02:10] amen it's him
[1:02:12] a prophet came on the scene and he said
[1:02:14] i must decrease and he must increase
[1:02:16] the seventh seal himself the mighty
[1:02:18] angel of christ
[1:02:20] comes to personally to you
[1:02:23] and says here is your inheritance i'm
[1:02:25] going to make sure you get it i'm going
[1:02:27] to make sure you claim it i'm going to
[1:02:29] make sure that you walk in the
[1:02:31] supernatural thank you hallelujah
[1:02:34] whatever it takes
[1:02:36] who's that who's there
[1:02:38] is everyone there whatever it takes long
[1:02:40] you're so surrendered and you trust him
[1:02:42] that much where you can say to him
[1:02:44] whatever it takes
[1:02:46] it might hurt amen
[1:02:48] but whatever it takes
[1:02:50] now that doesn't mean you're just going
[1:02:52] to get bombarded
[1:02:53] it's all in god's timing
[1:02:55] because you trust him right
[1:02:57] hallelujah
[1:03:03] romans 8 1 says there is therefore now
[1:03:05] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:03:06] christ jesus who walked not after the
[1:03:09] flesh but after the spirit
[1:03:11] hallelujah
[1:03:13] and just this last one on this
[1:03:15] particular vein
[1:03:20] ephesians 2 4 to 6
[1:03:23] it says by god who is rich in mercy
[1:03:25] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:03:28] even when we were dead in sin
[1:03:30] has quickened us together with christ
[1:03:33] for by grace you are saved
[1:03:35] and has raised us up together and made
[1:03:37] us hallelujah
[1:03:39] you've been made to sit
[1:03:41] you've been created you've been
[1:03:49] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:03:51] jesus
[1:03:53] oh my
[1:03:54] no wonder the devil doesn't like you
[1:03:56] no wonder he's jealous of you no wonder
[1:03:58] he seeks to destroy you and find any
[1:04:00] leverage into your life whatever he can
[1:04:02] see he'll try everything
[1:04:04] that's why
[1:04:05] this is what he wants to do
[1:04:07] his prerogative is to dumb you down so
[1:04:09] that you ain't supernatural
[1:04:11] you don't have supernatural
[1:04:12] manifestation there's no miracles in
[1:04:14] your life i'm not saying that is but
[1:04:15] this is what he wants to do he wants to
[1:04:17] make you a mute
[1:04:19] now you want to be a mute to god but the
[1:04:21] devil wants to make you a mute to god
[1:04:23] and open to him
[1:04:25] so you just start speaking the tree of
[1:04:26] knowledge speaking conspiracies seeking
[1:04:29] all the world knowledge and what this
[1:04:31] one says and that one says but what
[1:04:32] about being a mute only to god
[1:04:36] and the creative power
[1:04:38] see when you speak all these other
[1:04:39] things all the time and it's just
[1:04:40] willy-nilly out this and that and
[1:04:42] emotions and whatever then how can god
[1:04:44] put creative activate that creative
[1:04:46] power in you
[1:04:47] how
[1:04:48] how
[1:04:49] it's so important
[1:04:51] amen and you see now these carnal things
[1:04:53] come from a life that isn't consecrated
[1:04:56] and you're up and down because the
[1:04:58] spirit realm in your life is just it's
[1:04:59] been powered
[1:05:01] it's been empowered with all sorts of
[1:05:03] philosophies and and and and all sorts
[1:05:06] of things that you watch and you
[1:05:07] tantalize the taste buds
[1:05:11] but god calls
[1:05:13] he's calling you
[1:05:14] he's saying come into the secret place
[1:05:17] he said to the prophet you know in 1956
[1:05:19] he said and what is a vision
[1:05:21] he took him up into that place and he
[1:05:23] saw that tent and he the angel lord said
[1:05:25] this is the third pull and he says and
[1:05:27] the pillar if i went and stood over a
[1:05:29] wooden building amen an earthen building
[1:05:32] and said i'll meet you in there
[1:05:34] and the prophet says what does this mean
[1:05:36] and he says isn't it written in the
[1:05:37] scripture don't you remember
[1:05:39] that when you pray in your closet just
[1:05:41] go into secret and your heavenly father
[1:05:42] will meet you in there
[1:05:44] he's saying that the the final move of
[1:05:47] this ministry and the message calling us
[1:05:49] into rapture and condition is is going
[1:05:51] to be centered around a supernatural
[1:05:53] communion with god in the secret place
[1:05:56] without that you ain't going nowhere
[1:05:59] ain't going nowhere
[1:06:01] so next time you sit down to pray and
[1:06:02] the devil's fighting you
[1:06:04] and making you not want to pray and
[1:06:05] trust me i know because he does it to me
[1:06:08] then you just tell him where to go
[1:06:10] and you fight amen just think the
[1:06:12] israelites you know when they came up to
[1:06:14] ai and they were all getting beaten down
[1:06:16] and acan came and he took those things
[1:06:17] that's what the devil wants for you
[1:06:20] he doesn't want you to take ai
[1:06:23] hallelujah
[1:06:24] so he wants to fight you and that's why
[1:06:27] it's hard to pray
[1:06:29] and then when you do praise fighting you
[1:06:31] oh just finish now finish now you know
[1:06:33] you just it's too long or you can't pray
[1:06:35] that long
[1:06:38] just go get there
[1:06:39] get out of it i'm going to play more
[1:06:41] like david when he when he was dancing
[1:06:43] around the ark and mccall was mocking
[1:06:45] them
[1:06:46] oh and he just said just watch this then
[1:06:48] the next day he danced even more
[1:06:50] hallelujah
[1:06:52] devil tries to mock you for getting in
[1:06:54] the spirit you just say watch this then
[1:06:57] and go even further
[1:06:58] go deeper
[1:07:08] the next question
[1:07:09] what would hinder or prevent us from a
[1:07:11] supernatural walk and i just listed
[1:07:12] these things out as a lack of
[1:07:14] consecration
[1:07:17] selfishness
[1:07:20] no no desire to sacrifice
[1:07:24] no fear of god
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:29] condemnation
[1:07:30] for those that are wanting to do right
[1:07:32] and are have the fear of god
[1:07:34] so you see
[1:07:35] you can go both ways
[1:07:37] you can be someone that's gone and
[1:07:38] conscious beside your conscience and you
[1:07:41] it begins to become easy for you to do
[1:07:42] things that are besetting you
[1:07:45] in your walk
[1:07:46] um and so then you because of that you
[1:07:48] are dumb down the devil's one
[1:07:51] temporarily
[1:07:52] he's just got you in a little thing you
[1:07:54] know that stops you from communing with
[1:07:55] god
[1:07:56] it just pushes the presence up there on
[1:07:58] the post you know who's heard the story
[1:08:00] about the how the spirit the dove waits
[1:08:02] just a little bit away he just you know
[1:08:04] that's the supernatural walk
[1:08:06] you know there's the supernatural walk
[1:08:08] right there
[1:08:09] and and he's just waiting just make it
[1:08:11] right i've made provision for you my
[1:08:13] blood's made near you near uh you know
[1:08:15] you know you go back to this um
[1:08:17] scripture here which i thought was just
[1:08:19] quite tremendous about ephesians 2 how
[1:08:21] it says that why we were yet sinners he
[1:08:23] gave himself for us and he called us if
[1:08:25] he will call you as a sinner how much
[1:08:27] more will he restore you as a believer
[1:08:29] that's fallen amen you don't have to
[1:08:32] stay away he loved you when you were a
[1:08:34] sinner
[1:08:36] so if he loved you when you were a
[1:08:37] sinner how about small does he love you
[1:08:39] and still love you and want to keep you
[1:08:42] and bring you up every time
[1:08:44] back straight away
[1:08:46] no crawling on your knees up
[1:08:48] up to the altar no penance no rosary
[1:08:50] beats no works just faith and belief and
[1:08:54] repentance
[1:08:58] for a true believer
[1:09:00] no fear of god
[1:09:02] and then condemnation for those
[1:09:04] that have a high conscience
[1:09:07] it can stop your supernatural walk
[1:09:08] because of fear and it breaks your faith
[1:09:10] complaining and murmuring
[1:09:12] oh my
[1:09:14] god oh man we've been going through that
[1:09:15] children's bible again and
[1:09:17] they really really
[1:09:19] i can't it's unbelievable how much
[1:09:20] israel just complained
[1:09:22] murmured and
[1:09:24] just got in the spirit of jealousy and
[1:09:26] carnal
[1:09:28] let's not get down that road
[1:09:30] hey man help me lord
[1:09:32] place a guard on my tongue david said
[1:09:34] that i wouldn't sin against you
[1:09:37] complaining not only makes the lord
[1:09:39] upset
[1:09:40] but and and brings things down to
[1:09:43] whoever you're complaining to
[1:09:45] lowering the atmosphere into a carnal
[1:09:46] condition but it also brings you into a
[1:09:49] state of amnesia
[1:09:51] because you're complaining and you're
[1:09:52] com murmuring and
[1:09:54] and you know just just just got a
[1:09:55] negative testimony
[1:09:57] oh my
[1:09:59] oh god help us with that
[1:10:01] don't ever say that and i'm not going to
[1:10:02] repeat brother adrian's service because
[1:10:04] that's what he would he hit that hard
[1:10:06] amen who appreciated that amen
[1:10:09] hallelujah
[1:10:11] idols is another thing
[1:10:14] and i'll tell you
[1:10:15] you think you're you know we're in the
[1:10:16] message and we've got the sermon and
[1:10:18] we're discerning the antichrist spirit
[1:10:20] but if you go and comb through even
[1:10:22] let's say you know i'll come through my
[1:10:24] children's stuff and books and you watch
[1:10:26] idols come in the house
[1:10:28] it looks real innocent and you start
[1:10:29] reading and i i don't have time to read
[1:10:31] everything but you've got to have a
[1:10:33] discernment
[1:10:34] because all of a sudden you've got
[1:10:36] homosexual books in your house promoting
[1:10:38] homosexuality you know that yeah stuff
[1:10:41] like that in your house someone picks
[1:10:43] that up and a homosexual spirit comes on
[1:10:44] your child then they start girls liking
[1:10:46] girls and boys liking boys why because a
[1:10:48] spirit came in
[1:10:50] spirit came in and how did that happen
[1:10:52] to israel we think oh israel you know
[1:10:54] they fell all the time and had idolatry
[1:10:56] come in and they married and this is
[1:10:57] what happens to us too
[1:10:59] you're not exempt from that you have to
[1:11:00] be vigilant
[1:11:03] real vigilant
[1:11:04] do you think the enemy is not trying
[1:11:06] everything and you think he's not i mean
[1:11:07] he is dumb anyone that fights god is
[1:11:09] dumb but he is pretty smart at
[1:11:11] infiltration
[1:11:13] and he'll try everything
[1:11:15] through the children
[1:11:17] through us through just letting little
[1:11:19] things in and what happens is the fear
[1:11:20] of god disappears and then all of a
[1:11:22] sudden you've got idolatry going on in
[1:11:24] your own house just like that and then
[1:11:26] idolatry happening in the church
[1:11:29] you think that you know this is how it
[1:11:30] happens that's why it's so important
[1:11:33] that you have a supernatural walk
[1:11:35] from the pastor to the janitor amen
[1:11:39] hallelujah every part of the body of
[1:11:41] christ should be walking in the
[1:11:43] supernatural
[1:11:45] then the devil can't come in
[1:11:48] because the spirit of prophecy will rise
[1:11:49] up and prophesy against it
[1:11:52] or a tongue's an interpretation will say
[1:11:54] hey sister watch out for that because
[1:11:55] that's coming into your house that son
[1:11:57] or that daughter has got this
[1:12:01] or this uncle is going to come and die
[1:12:03] and bring this and it looks all good but
[1:12:05] it's not good get rid of it and ananias
[1:12:09] and sapphira
[1:12:13] bring it on
[1:12:15] hallelujah
[1:12:18] oh god
[1:12:20] you know there's a we want the
[1:12:22] supernatural everyone wants the
[1:12:23] supernatural we are supernatural and we
[1:12:27] have miracles in our midst
[1:12:30] collectively
[1:12:31] but what i'm not gonna look at anyone
[1:12:32] but what about you
[1:12:34] are you riding on the testimony of the
[1:12:36] church
[1:12:38] and thinking you're okay because you are
[1:12:40] in a church that has supernatural and
[1:12:42] this brother's gone this and that one
[1:12:43] and we have a supernatural testimony how
[1:12:45] god can deliver young men
[1:12:48] and you think oh we're so good because
[1:12:49] we're in this church but what about you

[1:13:43] and just let it go flying over
[1:13:45] if peter was proud
[1:13:46] and let it go flying over do you think
[1:13:48] he would have stood in the prison when
[1:13:49] the angel of the lord said stand up i

[1:13:55] down on the ground tied down he's proud
[1:13:57] i don't need your help

[1:14:01] word comes across them and it's
[1:14:02] conviction and it's correction and they
[1:14:04] say oh no that's not for me that's for

[1:15:49] supernatural testimony or a supernatural
[1:15:52] life with god or your home ain't
[1:15:54] supernatural where you're having
[1:15:56] powerful moments in the presence of god
[1:15:57] in your life in your prayer closet with
[1:15:59] your family at church when you're
[1:16:01] driving hallelujah anywhere

[1:16:12] what happened because you know we go
[1:16:13] through things what happened to aaron's
[1:16:15] rod
[1:16:16] in god's presence
[1:16:18] amen that turned back to its origin it's
[1:16:20] all about restoration
[1:16:22] god restored
[1:16:25] the stick that had been shaped by man
[1:16:27] judgmental
[1:16:29] caused all these destructions
[1:16:31] just like our life can
[1:16:33] cause destruction shaped by man
[1:16:36] dry
[1:16:38] legal
[1:16:41] resentful no i'm not saying aaron's rob
[1:16:43] was resentful but we can get like that
[1:16:45] when we get into a dry condition but
[1:16:48] then you get that stick and you put it
[1:16:49] in god's presence
[1:16:51] oh my god
[1:16:53] and you know what his blood make us die
[1:16:56] and actually in other scriptures it says
[1:16:58] that he's torn the middle wall of
[1:16:59] partition he's ripped the veil from the
[1:17:02] top
[1:17:03] amen from from heaven to earth
[1:17:06] the veil has been ripped
[1:17:08] now do not bask on the other side of the
[1:17:10] veil just because some glory's spilling
[1:17:11] out like reuben and gad and manassee did
[1:17:13] on the other side of the jordan you know
[1:17:15] you just get excited sitting in a church
[1:17:17] environment where it's all good
[1:17:18] and it's all nice
[1:17:20] and it's and everyone out and there's
[1:17:21] people entering in and getting into
[1:17:22] their promise and getting saved and
[1:17:24] you're just sitting on the other side of
[1:17:25] jordan
[1:17:26] where there's greenery all spilling over
[1:17:28] because you're but you're in the wrong
[1:17:30] side
[1:17:32] come through
[1:17:33] come through
[1:17:35] ask god to discern your heart
[1:17:38] why are you not coming through what are
[1:17:40] you holding on to are you willing to
[1:17:42] sacrifice
[1:17:44] are you willing to lay on the altar
[1:17:46] a living sacrifice amen
[1:17:48] hallelujah
[1:17:51] near the final one curses left
[1:17:52] unresolved in families in regions
[1:17:55] amen hallelujah and i've got a whole
[1:17:57] sermon on that
[1:17:59] so i won't actually touch on that i'll
[1:18:00] speak on that one time
[1:18:02] but um yeah the lord's opened up a few
[1:18:03] things there but just remember
[1:18:05] if you we're dealing now with
[1:18:08] principalities and powers and rulers of
[1:18:09] darkness we're we're dealing on a
[1:18:11] spiritual level our war is not in the
[1:18:13] flesh
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:16] when you get mad at your brother or your
[1:18:17] sister just remember the war is not in
[1:18:19] the flesh
[1:18:20] hallelujah you can't get mad at your
[1:18:22] brother and sister in god's presence
[1:18:25] oh my hallelujah
[1:18:27] you're just full of love man
[1:18:29] love covers a multitude of sin
[1:18:32] amen
[1:18:34] hallelujah they can do no wrong in his
[1:18:37] presence you know that
[1:18:38] do no wrong why because the blood is
[1:18:41] still there
[1:18:42] the blood speaks perfection
[1:18:45] the blood speaks greater things than
[1:18:48] that of abel abel's blood smoke
[1:18:50] vengeance
[1:18:51] his blood speaks mercy
[1:18:53] his blood speaks come up higher
[1:18:55] come out of your own church ages and
[1:18:57] come up into revelation 4. come into the
[1:18:59] throne room
[1:19:01] you're invited all of you are invited
[1:19:04] right now
[1:19:05] and many of you have taken the
[1:19:07] invitation but there's people in here
[1:19:09] that are still in the church ages
[1:19:11] in their soul
[1:19:12] their soul hasn't been brought up into
[1:19:14] the throne room yet
[1:19:16] hallelujah hear the voice of the god of
[1:19:19] jesus christ
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:22] come up here he says he says i heard a
[1:19:25] loud voice
[1:19:27] i heard a shout yes
[1:19:29] hey man come up here come into me
[1:19:33] come in here come and see
[1:19:36] hallelujah
[1:19:38] that's the message
[1:19:40] that's our message
[1:19:42] come
[1:19:43] amen hey man
[1:19:50] hallelujah
[1:19:55] next question is what promises of
[1:19:56] reconciliation has he made for us
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:01] to chronicle seven
[1:20:03] to 15
[1:20:06] so remember
[1:20:08] you can fall
[1:20:09] as an individual
[1:20:11] the church can fall as a local body
[1:20:15] and the region can reject
[1:20:18] the gospel and fall into a state
[1:20:21] of many different states but
[1:20:23] one of the states is obviously a state
[1:20:25] where this feat has been shaken of the
[1:20:27] dust as jesus said to do
[1:20:29] if that town rejects the gospel and that
[1:20:32] state can get put into a state of
[1:20:34] judgment
[1:20:35] but but but an area can also be placed
[1:20:38] in a in a state of fallow ground
[1:20:41] right everyone knows that fallow ground
[1:20:44] and that's deliberate
[1:20:46] removal of god's
[1:20:48] of the garden growing
[1:20:50] of the farm of the cultivation remove it
[1:20:54] stop harvesting the let it grow dry
[1:20:57] let it go hard
[1:20:59] i need to break the cycle of death
[1:21:02] break the cycle of all the pests that
[1:21:03] have come into the church or the pests
[1:21:05] that have come into that region and it's
[1:21:06] causing trouble just let it sit for a
[1:21:09] few years let it sit let it go dry
[1:21:12] but then
[1:21:14] what happens next
[1:21:16] now
[1:21:17] god now after solomon dedicated the
[1:21:19] temple
[1:21:21] and second chronicles seven um he says
[1:21:23] now now now solomon are dedicated to
[1:21:25] temple and now it says now thus solomon
[1:21:27] finished the house of the lord and the
[1:21:29] king's house
[1:21:31] and all that came into solomon's heart
[1:21:34] to make in the house of the lord and in
[1:21:37] his own house i love this he
[1:21:39] prosperously affected
[1:21:41] amen it really happened you know it
[1:21:43] prospered
[1:21:44] because it was under the direction of
[1:21:46] the holy spirit
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:48] and the lord appeared now i love this
[1:21:50] because it's not just solomon praying
[1:21:52] this next this course of scripture it's
[1:21:54] actually god speaking this is a promise
[1:21:57] amen and he's the same yesterday today
[1:21:59] and forever and it says and the lord
[1:22:00] appeared to solomon by night and said
[1:22:02] unto him i have heard thy prayer and
[1:22:04] have chosen this place to myself amen
[1:22:07] for a house of sacrifice
[1:22:09] god has chosen you for a house of
[1:22:12] sacrifice
[1:22:13] amen a living sacrifice where you are
[1:22:17] dead on the elijah altar
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:21] dead to yourself
[1:22:22] dead to that old husband that's selfish
[1:22:24] that has no fear of god that is
[1:22:26] idolatrous that it comes from babylonian
[1:22:28] background
[1:22:30] hallelujah dead to those things
[1:22:32] on the altar
[1:22:34] so the fire can come
[1:22:36] to bring you up to call you out of the
[1:22:38] church ages to call you out of darkness
[1:22:41] to call you into a ministry to call you
[1:22:44] up into a revelation of jesus christ
[1:22:48] hallelujah
[1:22:49] to take you higher
[1:22:52] and you just surrender everything
[1:22:54] like rahab do you think rahab did much
[1:22:55] when her house was crumbling

[1:23:01] trust
[1:23:03] someone said trust
[1:23:04] that's all she could do
[1:23:06] that's all you can do
[1:23:08] when god's dealing if god's dealing with
[1:23:10] you right now
[1:23:11] let the past crumble

[1:24:31] land

[1:25:31] amen you know wellington had a curse
[1:25:33] over it
[1:25:34] do you know that and when we first
[1:25:36] started the church way back over in the
[1:25:38] other building amen and there was a
[1:25:41] service going on and we were having the
[1:25:43] spirit was moving in a mighty way and
[1:25:45] the lord came down in tongues and
[1:25:47] interpretation and said that over us
[1:25:51] and remove the curse that was over
[1:25:52] wellington for whatever wellington did
[1:25:56] that's between wellington and god now
[1:25:58] i'm not talking about the city and the
[1:26:00] civilization i'm talking about the
[1:26:02] spiritual land
[1:26:04] the elect land hello

[1:26:10] and where your desk is at work
[1:26:12] that's your land amen you can have
[1:26:14] ethernet condition right around your
[1:26:15] desk
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:17] and when those guys come over and start
[1:26:19] talking filth they get convicted because
[1:26:21] the spirit of god comes and says
[1:26:24] not in my eden hallelujah
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] glory
[1:26:31] oh lord
[1:26:32] amen foot princess possession amen amen
[1:26:36] and then he says here in second
[1:26:38] chronicles 7 15 hallelujah now mine eyes
[1:26:42] shall be open
[1:26:44] and mine is a tent unto the prayer
[1:26:48] that is made in this place
[1:26:52] glory
[1:26:54] you know
[1:26:56] the other day when i was preparing this
[1:26:57] well i wasn't knowing what i was going
[1:26:59] to preach properly
[1:27:00] and then uh i was just praying
[1:27:02] when i when when this came i thought man
[1:27:05] lord i really
[1:27:07] you know because this is my this is the
[1:27:08] burden on my heart and i want what i'm
[1:27:11] preaching now i'm preaching to myself
[1:27:12] too right
[1:27:13] i'm not saying i'm the big high and
[1:27:14] mighty one that has all the miracles
[1:27:17] you know there's miracles there's things
[1:27:19] that happen and we have a glorious time
[1:27:21] but there's always a greater calling and
[1:27:23] a higher calling right and you can and
[1:27:25] there's more
[1:27:26] and we have our frailties and all those
[1:27:28] things right here so now i'm like
[1:27:30] praying oh god
[1:27:32] i want your shekinah presence because
[1:27:34] now i'm going to read some quotes now
[1:27:35] and and and it was convicting me a lot
[1:27:37] because i thought man you know you can
[1:27:40] go out and you can do all these things
[1:27:41] and you can have a a great ministry but
[1:27:43] unless you're in the shekinah glory of
[1:27:45] god unless you've got an abiding
[1:27:47] presence within your life it's not going
[1:27:49] to do much
[1:27:51] you can preach the best sermon ever but
[1:27:52] if god isn't in you and behind you and
[1:27:54] anointing you what is it going to do
[1:27:57] and so i was praying oh god
[1:28:00] lord
[1:28:01] because it's my the burden of my heart
[1:28:03] is i just want to be able to just if
[1:28:04] someone comes to me and they're sick
[1:28:06] they don't leave sick
[1:28:08] amen you know that
[1:28:10] this is for all of you
[1:28:12] people don't leave us sick ever
[1:28:16] and if they if there is a reason you the
[1:28:19] lord will speak to you
[1:28:21] and he will give you a word
[1:28:22] or the church will rise up and you'll
[1:28:24] know there's a reason why this is
[1:28:25] happening and you'll be delivered in
[1:28:27] such and such a time whatever right so
[1:28:28] you have the vision of god
[1:28:31] and we're in the tune of the spirit of
[1:28:32] god and you you don't go and cast off
[1:28:34] stuff that needs to be there for a
[1:28:35] minute or you take judgment off
[1:28:37] something or someone
[1:28:39] you know you get these prayers and
[1:28:40] prayer requests over the whatsapp and
[1:28:42] you think pray for this one pray for
[1:28:43] that one prayer and i'm wary about that
[1:28:45] and that's just me you pray and i and
[1:28:47] you should pray i pray that the lord
[1:28:48] will be done and he would open the case
[1:28:51] and bring clarity but you know sometimes
[1:28:54] we just go and pray demons off or pray
[1:28:56] something that somebody's under judgment
[1:28:58] somebody's under correction
[1:29:00] and you don't know them from a bar of
[1:29:02] soap and you're going and you're going
[1:29:04] against god's plan
[1:29:06] just by praying willy-nilly you know
[1:29:07] your mouth just speaks out all these
[1:29:08] things superfluity of naughtiness
[1:29:11] because you're just speaking but then
[1:29:13] that's why you know we don't get access
[1:29:15] to the supernatural like we want to
[1:29:17] because our mouth is just frivolous
[1:29:20] we just speak everything out
[1:29:22] but you know the lord is calling us to a
[1:29:24] consecration where we speak his mind
[1:29:28] we have his will and you begin to say
[1:29:30] what he says say
[1:29:32] and when he nods you go when he says
[1:29:34] when he if there's no answer you stay
[1:29:36] amen fully obedient
[1:29:40] prisoners to jesus christ
[1:29:42] that's a sacrifice and it takes control
[1:29:45] it takes temperance
[1:29:47] but we want this who wants this
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:51] hallelujah
[1:29:52] help us lord
[1:29:54] and i and me especially you know my
[1:29:55] mouth can just speak a whole bunch of
[1:29:57] things
[1:29:58] as you know
[1:29:59] everyone knows who i am
[1:30:01] you know a sanguine style person that
[1:30:03] can just speak out
[1:30:05] and you know i just prayed lord help me
[1:30:07] and this is a testimony
[1:30:09] and i said lord i really want and desire
[1:30:12] you know just to have your
[1:30:14] kind of presence so thick and tangible
[1:30:16] in my life i just want to see the the
[1:30:20] the full measure of my inheritance
[1:30:23] i hate it when i pray and nothing
[1:30:26] happens i hate it amen and i will never
[1:30:29] accept that
[1:30:30] and i want to know why
[1:30:32] i'm sure everyone wants to know why
[1:30:35] what is it is it a lack of faith is it a
[1:30:37] lack of you're not praying the right
[1:30:39] thing are you touching the spirit of god
[1:30:41] are you in tune what is it right and now
[1:30:44] i'm going to answer these questions
[1:30:45] but remember it's not a direct answer
[1:30:47] just for every individual you you still
[1:30:49] have to find from god but these are some
[1:30:51] of the reasons this is why i've enabled
[1:30:53] this the key to a supernatural life
[1:30:56] because we want keys right keys open the
[1:30:57] door
[1:30:58] faith is the key and christ is the door
[1:31:01] right amen and the word we're going into
[1:31:04] the word now amen amen
[1:31:07] so i'm praying this and i'm like
[1:31:10] and anyway every morning usually um on a
[1:31:12] regular morning which is pretty often
[1:31:15] i asked the law for a psalm or a proverb
[1:31:17] or something you know i just kind of
[1:31:19] pray and just just wait on the lord and
[1:31:21] just whatever he impresses on my heart
[1:31:23] i'll just go read and so i got psalm 36
[1:31:26] and i went and read it in the king james
[1:31:28] because use i read the king james first
[1:31:30] and foremost but i do read other
[1:31:32] translations to try and get a
[1:31:34] more you know sometimes it's a clearer
[1:31:37] word because some of those old words are
[1:31:38] quite hard to understand
[1:31:40] and i read it in psalm 36 verse 1 and
[1:31:43] the king james and it says now the
[1:31:45] transgression of the wicked saith within
[1:31:47] my heart
[1:31:49] that there is no fear of god before his
[1:31:51] eyes and i was like man i really can't
[1:31:53] understand what he means by my heart my
[1:31:56] heart and i'm like i'm sure there's
[1:31:58] something funky going on here like i
[1:31:59] just don't understand that and i think
[1:32:01] oh it's that old english thing again you
[1:32:03] know how they put things around the
[1:32:04] other way and you're going ah
[1:32:07] i know i don't speak english in
[1:32:08] self-defense right
[1:32:09] i speak it as a normal language
[1:32:13] and i'm thinking what's what is this and
[1:32:15] anyway on my bible it's got a little
[1:32:17] commentary on the side and it says in
[1:32:19] four manuscripts it doesn't say that it
[1:32:21] says this some
[1:32:23] word and i thought okay so and so i went
[1:32:26] over to another translation and it said
[1:32:27] this it says in in the same verse it
[1:32:29] says now now the transgression
[1:32:33] aggressor that he may sin says within
[1:32:35] himself
[1:32:37] that there is no fear of god before his
[1:32:39] eyes
[1:32:40] and i thought wow
[1:32:43] man and i was felt directed to this you
[1:32:45] know because i read the whole psalm and
[1:32:46] the sun's beautiful you read psalm 36
[1:32:48] i'm going to power i'm going to just
[1:32:49] drop down it says for he has dealt
[1:32:51] craftedly before him to discover his
[1:32:52] iniquity
[1:32:54] and hate it
[1:32:55] then i drop down to verse 7 it says now
[1:32:57] how how has thou multiplied thy mercy oh
[1:33:00] god so the children of men shall trust
[1:33:03] in the shelter of thy wings
[1:33:05] they shall be fully satisfied with the
[1:33:07] fatness of thine house
[1:33:09] and thou shalt cause them to drink of
[1:33:11] the full stream of by delights
[1:33:14] and that word delight goes back to eden
[1:33:17] so you he will he you see this is where
[1:33:20] a lack of fear brings you out of that
[1:33:22] presence but when the fear of god is
[1:33:24] restored
[1:33:26] when the fear of god is restored
[1:33:29] and the spirit is like the conviction of
[1:33:31] the spirit and when you hear the word
[1:33:33] you're convicted
[1:33:34] and you change
[1:33:36] because you're so convicted and the fear
[1:33:38] of god puts a fear on you
[1:33:40] and you really repent and you really get
[1:33:42] right with god because you don't want to
[1:33:43] transgress his laws
[1:33:45] you don't want to transgress his
[1:33:46] commandments because you're sick of
[1:33:48] walking in a natural state sick of being
[1:33:50] defeated
[1:33:52] hallelujah
[1:33:54] you want to walk in the supernatural you
[1:33:56] want to walk on your inheritance you
[1:33:57] want to see miracles in your life and
[1:33:59] your family's life hallelujah never need
[1:34:02] a doctor again imagine that never need
[1:34:05] medical because you've got the tree of
[1:34:06] life
[1:34:07] that's the greatest doctor
[1:34:09] the divine physician
[1:34:11] even for esther you never need a dentist
[1:34:13] again
[1:34:14] my teeth falling apart lord jesus
[1:34:17] restore these teeth in this perfect
[1:34:18] teeth
[1:34:19] you know you've got perfect teeth in
[1:34:21] your theophany why not just get a
[1:34:23] download now
[1:34:24] why not just get perfect teeth now why
[1:34:26] not just get a perfect mind now why not
[1:34:28] just get a perfect spirit now
[1:34:30] hallelujah
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:34] why not get deliverance instant
[1:34:36] so what is holding things back
[1:34:39] what is it
[1:34:42] lori
[1:34:43] are you with me amen
[1:34:45] so in this testimony i said lord
[1:34:48] i felt like you know in my own life i'd
[1:34:50] you know under all the pressure for the
[1:34:53] last 10 years
[1:34:55] in business with isaac and you know not
[1:34:57] because of isaac but just
[1:35:01] look it's been a wild ride
[1:35:03] it's been a wild ride of pressure and
[1:35:06] heaps of things and my and i've loved
[1:35:08] every moment right
[1:35:09] but
[1:35:11] but it has been
[1:35:13] um stress right and into that
[1:35:16] what's really in a man has revealed
[1:35:18] and so obviously to see all the good and
[1:35:20] the bad is revealed and the conscience
[1:35:23] and that process gets said
[1:35:25] and you begin to for me i was beginning
[1:35:27] to speed on my car because i'm always
[1:35:29] late for everything not anymore though
[1:35:31] christians are never late
[1:35:34] anyway
[1:35:35] that's what they say anyway that's what
[1:35:37] brother chris andrews says you can you
[1:35:39] can ask him what he means
[1:35:41] so anyway
[1:35:42] i i i start speeding and then you know
[1:35:45] now i'm so busy i'm texting while
[1:35:46] driving and speaking on the phone and so
[1:35:48] i'm slowly moving through those things
[1:35:50] and getting technology that allows me to
[1:35:51] do stuff legally and all of that but in
[1:35:54] the process you still see your
[1:35:55] conscience you lose the fear of god
[1:35:59] because your conscience is the very
[1:36:01] contact of fear of god
[1:36:04] where it becomes hard to sin
[1:36:06] becomes hard to take that social drink
[1:36:08] becomes hard to go and lust at that
[1:36:10] woman
[1:36:12] or that man or whatever becomes hard to
[1:36:14] swear when you're angry
[1:36:17] you know becomes hard to do those things
[1:36:20] because
[1:36:22] of a conscience and you see it in any
[1:36:23] way i got said
[1:36:26] and you know
[1:36:27] in my past i lived a very as you know a
[1:36:30] very simple life and so all of the
[1:36:32] things and trappings when you get into a
[1:36:34] state where you see your conscience then
[1:36:36] more things the devil's just like got an
[1:36:38] inroad right
[1:36:39] i thought
[1:36:41] i just said lord
[1:36:43] i i just and i you know every day you
[1:36:45] repent of your sins and you go through
[1:36:48] the motions to a degree of whatever
[1:36:50] you're led to do in prayer but
[1:36:53] that day i was like
[1:36:55] i just thought you know i haven't really
[1:36:58] kind of been specific
[1:37:00] too much on what i've repented of so i
[1:37:01] said lord i just repent of speeding in
[1:37:03] my car i repent of lusting after woman
[1:37:06] if i seen a woman or if i was in a bad
[1:37:08] state i repent of
[1:37:10] um the
[1:37:11] you know like texting while driving i
[1:37:13] repent of getting angry you know and
[1:37:16] those things and then all of a sudden
[1:37:18] it just changed the whole atmosphere
[1:37:20] changed and and the that's that presence
[1:37:22] of god it was so and i thought you know
[1:37:24] what i'm going to share that testimony
[1:37:26] because
[1:37:27] some
[1:37:28] you know you've got to be specific
[1:37:32] in many many cases it's like you can
[1:37:34] just say have a blanket repentance but
[1:37:36] where is the the real penitence in that
[1:37:39] you're just making a blanket it's like
[1:37:40] well lord just rep forgive me of
[1:37:42] everything i've ever done even if i
[1:37:43] haven't done this type of thing
[1:37:45] and that's alright in some cases maybe
[1:37:47] you don't know and generally don't know
[1:37:48] and he will get rid of those things
[1:37:49] that's way down deep or he will show you
[1:37:52] yes he can show you things he's shown me
[1:37:54] things before and the same experience
[1:37:56] happened years ago where i was proud and
[1:37:58] i got arrogant and i and i didn't
[1:38:00] realize it and and then i repented of
[1:38:03] that on a prayer
[1:38:04] you know like the presence of god came
[1:38:06] but it sort of hovered over me and and
[1:38:08] didn't come right in and and this
[1:38:10] thought came that you've been proud and
[1:38:12] i've repented of it and i laid it all
[1:38:14] down and then the presence came right
[1:38:15] down into me
[1:38:17] and that's because you'll see he's
[1:38:19] watching and waiting and so i was like
[1:38:20] lord i just want this anointing
[1:38:22] for my ministry for my fatherhood for my
[1:38:26] my my husband
[1:38:28] um ship
[1:38:29] whatever you call it as a husband as a
[1:38:31] man i want my anointing
[1:38:34] and for every one of you
[1:38:36] man brother sister child
[1:38:38] you have an anointing
[1:38:41] amen and god has made a way by the blood
[1:38:43] for you to stay in it
[1:38:45] no condemnation you may make mistakes
[1:38:47] but you're walking after the spirit and
[1:38:49] i walk after the spirit my whole life is
[1:38:52] for the spirit but yet in the humanity i
[1:38:54] sometimes make mistakes but if i walk in
[1:38:56] condemnation because of those mistakes
[1:38:58] i've
[1:38:58] the supernatural won't happen in my life
[1:39:00] i won't have miracles i won't have his
[1:39:01] presence his anointing won't be there
[1:39:04] like it should be
[1:39:06] god's word is anointed you can say
[1:39:07] something and you might not be in a very
[1:39:09] good condition and it will still bless
[1:39:10] the people and it might still deliver
[1:39:12] but
[1:39:13] when you're in the right place and
[1:39:15] you're consecrated and god speaks
[1:39:17] through you and you and you're anointed
[1:39:19] and the power of god is in your life you
[1:39:21] watch the difference
[1:39:24] and when someone comes to you for prayer
[1:39:26] and you pray and they get healed from
[1:39:28] leukemia or they get healed from
[1:39:30] whatever condition that they've had all
[1:39:32] their life or their limb grows back if
[1:39:35] they've got an arm cut off or something
[1:39:36] amen do you know what will happen
[1:39:39] even your from that moment the word will
[1:39:41] get around and even your shadow will
[1:39:44] cause people to get healed
[1:39:46] because people realize that there's an
[1:39:47] anointing
[1:39:48] you know that hallelujah
[1:39:51] and i've always said lord
[1:39:54] it kindle it
[1:39:56] you know it's got to start somewhere and
[1:39:58] we think all this revival has got to
[1:39:59] start
[1:40:01] what about you
[1:40:03] this is where it starts you know you
[1:40:04] think oh lord our church needs a revival
[1:40:06] no you need a revival
[1:40:08] you need a revival
[1:40:11] i need a revival right
[1:40:13] amen amen we need revival hallelujah
[1:40:17] amen
[1:40:20] hallelujah so i read those things and
[1:40:22] anyway this that presence came in i was
[1:40:24] like well and it wasn't like a huge like
[1:40:25] out of this world kind of experience but
[1:40:27] it was enough to know that there was a
[1:40:29] little
[1:40:30] like kind of little you know like a
[1:40:32] little easement on the title a little
[1:40:34] blockage in the land that was just
[1:40:36] holding things back and so the flow just
[1:40:38] came amen
[1:40:40] amen you know i got a question have you
[1:40:42] been getting proud offended or jealous
[1:40:44] and then lately
[1:40:46] i want to this the lord showed me this
[1:40:48] because it was happening in my life you
[1:40:50] know
[1:40:50] this when none of us are exempt right
[1:40:52] peter wasn't exempt
[1:40:57] brother branham says always listen now
[1:40:59] notice always listen and be conscious of
[1:41:02] your littleness
[1:41:04] you know if you realize how little you
[1:41:05] really are
[1:41:06] you'll never be jealous
[1:41:08] you'll never be offended and you'll
[1:41:11] never get proud
[1:41:12] if you feel misjust like someone you've
[1:41:14] been an injustice
[1:41:16] you'll never feel proud
[1:41:18] because you realize you're nothing and
[1:41:20] you're little and you realize you don't
[1:41:22] even deserve anything
[1:41:24] really it's all his grace right
[1:41:27] it's an absolute it's like grease
[1:41:29] you know it cures all
[1:41:32] hallelujah
[1:41:34] real true now that's a very natural
[1:41:36] comparison right everyone that knows
[1:41:38] brother branham's life story knows what
[1:41:40] grease is that's what their family
[1:41:42] used to cure all you know it's like our
[1:41:44] rollies in new zealand we have rollies
[1:41:46] and it just goes on everything
[1:41:48] hallelujah unless you've got a nurse for
[1:41:50] a wife then you have all the right
[1:41:52] chemicals and
[1:41:55] hey man
[1:41:56] rollies
[1:41:57] congress
[1:41:58] or realize that you're nothing
[1:42:01] your littleness now when i say that i
[1:42:03] don't mean in christ's eyes you're
[1:42:05] actually a treasure right and you're as
[1:42:06] bride and you're as queen and you're
[1:42:08] called up but in this flesh and in your
[1:42:11] you know what what you deserve
[1:42:14] very little the prophet says this he
[1:42:15] says who are you
[1:42:17] this is an influence in 63 he says who
[1:42:19] are you
[1:42:20] stick your finger in a bucket of water
[1:42:22] and pull it out
[1:42:23] and find the hole you put your finger in
[1:42:26] then say that was me
[1:42:29] you're nothing you'll be not be missed
[1:42:31] after a little while after you're gone
[1:42:33] they'll have a funeral procession out
[1:42:34] there and that's all but your influence
[1:42:38] will live on and on and on who wants to
[1:42:42] you know just you know footprints in the
[1:42:45] sands of time
[1:42:48] who might you know it's a believers
[1:42:50] desire that your footprints are anointed
[1:42:52] that if someone walked in your
[1:42:53] footprints they would get saved i always
[1:42:56] say you know like people that are so
[1:42:59] paranoid about letting google know what
[1:43:01] they're saying and all that stuff i'm
[1:43:02] like really
[1:43:04] google does not care what you say
[1:43:06] they don't care you ain't no monarch or
[1:43:08] king in this world
[1:43:10] they don't care
[1:43:11] i said you know what let them hear
[1:43:13] everything they might get saved
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:18] let them hear it amen hallelujah amen
[1:43:21] now obviously if you're
[1:43:23] doing missionary work in
[1:43:24] you know china or places that are not
[1:43:27] allowing you would be more wise but in a
[1:43:29] in a country like this it doesn't matter
[1:43:33] in the free world
[1:43:37] with big emphasis on this
[1:43:41] it's very much a bound world
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:46] so now i've just
[1:43:47] the final kind of section here is the
[1:43:49] cry
[1:43:50] of the believer and on an individual
[1:43:53] level
[1:43:54] it says here now and let's read in
[1:43:56] judges 6
[1:43:57] 11 to 14.

[1:44:26] threshed wheat by the wine press to hide
[1:44:29] it from the midianites
[1:44:31] because he was scared right

[1:44:35] because of the circumstances
[1:44:37] not knowing that inside him oh my how
[1:44:40] many people living under fear not really

[1:44:51] living by mega fear

[1:55:55] hallelujah
[1:55:57] amen he says here thou mighty man of
[1:55:59] valor
[1:56:01] could refer back to the old word and
[1:56:02] know it's right because he know this
[1:56:04] that god is a supernatural being and
[1:56:06] wherever a supernatural being is he'll
[1:56:08] do supernatural signs because the
[1:56:10] supernatural is in him you just can't
[1:56:12] get out of it how can you stand in the
[1:56:14] face of wind without having it wind
[1:56:16] blowing how can you get in water without
[1:56:18] being wet water is wet that's the
[1:56:20] chemical of it that's wet and when you
[1:56:22] get in water you're going to get wet
[1:56:24] right
[1:56:25] and when you get in the presence of gold
[1:56:26] the supernatural there is going to be
[1:56:28] supernatural signs
[1:56:30] amen and a supernatural workings of a
[1:56:32] supernatural god
[1:56:34] amen
[1:56:35] hallelujah
[1:56:36] amen
[1:56:38] what is a supernatural walk
[1:56:40] amen if jesus jesus answered the sound
[1:56:42] of them have faith in god for verily i
[1:56:44] say unto you that whosoever shall say
[1:56:46] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[1:56:48] be cast into the sea and shall not doubt
[1:56:50] in his heart but shall believe that
[1:56:52] those things which he saith shall come
[1:56:54] to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:56:56] saith
[1:56:57] therefore i say unto you whatsoever
[1:56:58] things you desire
[1:57:00] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:57:02] them and you shall have them
[1:57:05] hallelujah
[1:57:06] you know later on it says here of the
[1:57:09] disciples when they couldn't cast out
[1:57:11] that man that demon out of that man who
[1:57:13] had epilepsy you know i want to show you
[1:57:15] how you can get unbelief out of your
[1:57:17] life
[1:57:17] because no one wants to have unbelief
[1:57:19] but looming over their life
[1:57:21] amen hallelujah because the disciples
[1:57:23] couldn't cast them out they said lord
[1:57:25] how do you cast this devil out so easy
[1:57:28] he says this kind only comes out by
[1:57:30] prayer and fasting and it's because of
[1:57:33] your unbelief
[1:57:34] these people have been raising the dead
[1:57:36] cleansing the lepers preaching the
[1:57:37] gospel healing the sick
[1:57:39] and the getting results and then all of
[1:57:41] a sudden they couldn't do it why because
[1:57:42] now there was a higher level of demonic
[1:57:45] authority and they couldn't have the
[1:57:47] faith to cast it out they said no
[1:57:49] lord
[1:57:52] jesus says this kind only comes out by
[1:57:53] prayer and fasting so he's saying if you
[1:57:55] want unbelief out of your life you need
[1:57:57] to have a consecrated prayer life
[1:57:59] it's time to have a consecrated prayer
[1:58:02] life
[1:58:03] amen and you know what when you begin to
[1:58:06] get a concentrated prayer life god will
[1:58:08] begin to put fast over here amen
[1:58:10] hallelujah
[1:58:12] and you will begin to get closer to god
[1:58:14] hallelujah
[1:58:16] amen
[1:58:17] there's three things that are going to
[1:58:19] help you in your supernatural world
[1:58:21] first one is that you love the bible
[1:58:23] that you love the word that you enjoy
[1:58:26] your relationship with god through the
[1:58:27] written word of god
[1:58:29] read your bible
[1:58:31] amen and not just read it to get it over
[1:58:33] i'm done with but you long you're hungry
[1:58:36] you just want to get your bible thank
[1:58:38] you
[1:58:39] and you this is how you feel
[1:58:43] hallelujah
[1:58:45] oh god i love your word i just want to
[1:58:48] just pouring it into myself
[1:58:50] oh when you read it and you love him and
[1:58:52] you're looking up to his word and he
[1:58:54] begins to speak to you because you love
[1:58:56] it this is communion
[1:58:59] this is communion
[1:59:01] this is what he wants to bring in your
[1:59:02] life he wants you to have a relationship
[1:59:05] with him through his written word as
[1:59:06] well
[1:59:07] amen
[1:59:09] hallelujah
[1:59:11] the prophet says see the bible is a
[1:59:13] supernatural book it's written so that
[1:59:15] it's hid from the schools of theologians
[1:59:17] how many knows that jesus thanked god he
[1:59:19] said i thank thee father that thou has
[1:59:21] hid it from the wise and prudent and
[1:59:23] revealed it to babes such as would learn
[1:59:25] it's a book of love
[1:59:26] when the love of god comes into the
[1:59:28] heart then you fall in love with god
[1:59:30] then he reveals himself the bible
[1:59:32] meaning
[1:59:34] the interpretation of the bible is god
[1:59:36] himself interpreting his promises
[1:59:39] but the bible is written between the
[1:59:41] line
[1:59:42] hallelujah you think how the prophet
[1:59:43] always brought out about that stamp that
[1:59:45] boy found a stamp in the attic and he
[1:59:47] goes and sells it for a dollar
[1:59:49] just this little piece of paper
[1:59:51] and then that that stamp gets sold by
[1:59:53] the stamp clip for 500
[1:59:55] then that one takes it to on a national
[1:59:57] level and it's five hundred thousand
[1:59:58] dollars for a little piece of paper with
[2:00:00] ink on it
[2:00:02] now it wasn't the paper that was
[2:00:04] valuable it wasn't the ink that was
[2:00:06] valuable it was what was on it
[2:00:08] right
[2:00:09] now this times a million and this is
[2:00:11] what the word of god is
[2:00:13] it's not the bible book it's not the ink
[2:00:16] it's the word that is on it and god is
[2:00:19] calling you to have a supernatural
[2:00:21] communion with him through the word
[2:00:23] the second one is communion in prayer
[2:00:26] and i've touched on this already but
[2:00:28] just remember how jesus said by prayer
[2:00:30] and fasting that you will have greater
[2:00:32] victory and unbelief will leave your
[2:00:34] life completely
[2:00:35] jesus was always on the mountain
[2:00:38] he was always on the mountain fasting
[2:00:40] and praying the prophet was always on
[2:00:43] the mountain fasting and praying for
[2:00:45] healing yeah
[2:00:47] how do you think he had so much success
[2:00:49] do you think he just walked in because
[2:00:50] he was a prophet no it was more than
[2:00:52] that he fasted and prayed and
[2:00:55] consecrated himself if you want a
[2:00:57] supernatural life it's time for
[2:00:59] sacrifice
[2:01:01] it's time for fasting and praying
[2:01:03] under the leadership of god
[2:01:05] under the leadership of the holy ghost
[2:01:07] offer yourself on the
[2:01:09] altar
[2:01:10] offer yourself
[2:01:12] come down
[2:01:13] offer yourself and see what the fire of
[2:01:15] god will do
[2:01:16] he'll begin to use you he'll commune
[2:01:19] with you
[2:01:20] he'll begin to take you up
[2:01:22] amen
[2:01:24] and you will begin to see what jesus saw
[2:01:27] what the disciples saw jesus doing that
[2:01:29] they couldn't do
[2:01:30] what william branham did that you see
[2:01:33] that you want to do
[2:01:36] those powerful meetings
[2:01:38] he fasted and prayed for days a prophet
[2:01:42] with a great gift like he had he still
[2:01:44] fasted and prayed for days
[2:01:46] amen
[2:01:49] hallelujah now i don't want to put a
[2:01:50] legal binding over you
[2:01:52] where you feel like i've got to just go
[2:01:54] faster
[2:01:55] offer yourself
[2:01:57] to the spirit of god
[2:01:59] see what he does with you yes
[2:02:02] amen
[2:02:03] you express you wantness
[2:02:05] you want the supernatural
[2:02:07] you want to be able to pray
[2:02:09] and see results
[2:02:11] then you have to have pay the price of
[2:02:13] sacrifice
[2:02:20] prophet says listen to come down
[2:02:22] usually before we come for that
[2:02:24] anointing for the prayer line i have to
[2:02:25] stay shut up fasting and praying
[2:02:28] but
[2:02:28] when you don't have to do that i'm
[2:02:30] coming down to just speak you just feel
[2:02:32] different you know it's the same spirit
[2:02:34] but a different operation
[2:02:36] but god's gift now is a different quote
[2:02:39] it says but god's gift is the spirit of
[2:02:40] god that came down in the form of an
[2:02:43] angel now he didn't have wings he looked
[2:02:45] like a man i heard him when he walked
[2:02:48] in brother-in-law's just as that walked
[2:02:50] on the floor walked right over just as a
[2:02:52] normal as any man and talks like any
[2:02:54] other man he comes time after time
[2:02:58] through the room and different places
[2:03:00] when i'm fasting and praying
[2:03:03] there's something about it
[2:03:05] that changes your atmosphere
[2:03:08] so that you become sensitive to the
[2:03:10] supernatural so that you can come to a
[2:03:13] place where you're abiding in him his
[2:03:14] words are abiding in you then you can
[2:03:16] ask what you will because it's an
[2:03:18] abiding presence to know the will of god
[2:03:21] there's a quote i'm just quoting a quote
[2:03:24] it's the an abiding presence
[2:03:26] where you are abiding in him and his
[2:03:28] words are abiding in you and you begin
[2:03:30] to understand the plan of god
[2:03:33] for your people
[2:03:34] for the people around you for your
[2:03:36] children for the land for the ones
[2:03:38] around there and you get commissioned
[2:03:41] and you begin to hear hallelujah
[2:03:44] oh my the supernatural begins to take
[2:03:46] place in your life if jesus had to do it
[2:03:48] if brilliant brandon had to do it then
[2:03:50] you if you want it
[2:03:53] it just depends what you want
[2:03:55] what do you want
[2:03:58] hallelujah amen can i be musicians
[2:04:00] please
[2:04:02] glory to god
[2:04:04] what do you want
[2:04:06] lord hold this battery
[2:04:10] prophet says
[2:04:11] you see the failures
[2:04:13] of the church the pentecostal church the
[2:04:16] methodist the baptist and all
[2:04:18] it's a failing just play something sweet
[2:04:22] hallelujah
[2:04:23] maybe a
[2:04:24] god of miracles you know a miracle
[2:04:26] working god we can play that the
[2:04:28] it's failing to that abiding grace of
[2:04:31] god tonight you'll shout and clap your
[2:04:32] hands and dance in the aisles and speak
[2:04:34] in tongues that's goofs this is no good
[2:04:37] unless you're abiding in the shekinah
[2:04:38] glory see
[2:04:40] those things are fine i have nothing to
[2:04:42] say against them they're of god shouting
[2:04:44] and blessing god is wonderful speaking
[2:04:46] in tongues or translation of tongues
[2:04:49] or i mean interpretation of times it's
[2:04:50] the same but all these other things
[2:04:53] gifts of healing prophecies and all
[2:04:55] these things are marvelous but they're
[2:04:57] no good they're not fruitful they can't
[2:04:59] yield the right
[2:05:01] unless you're living in the presence of
[2:05:02] the shekinah the atmosphere around you
[2:05:04] is godly that's the reason that men and
[2:05:07] women are not permitted to these things
[2:05:10] that's what i've just been speaking
[2:05:11] because you'd go out here and call a
[2:05:14] blessing over something god has cursed
[2:05:16] or cursed something god has blessed here
[2:05:18] we are it's an abiding presence
[2:05:21] to know the will of god
[2:05:24] then don't look at the world's going to
[2:05:26] say about you it's what god thinks about
[2:05:28] you
[2:05:29] then you're living in its presence
[2:05:31] the privilege of every believer to live
[2:05:34] in a shekinah
[2:05:36] to have miracles
[2:05:38] to be a person that people can have
[2:05:40] trust and confidence that when you pray
[2:05:43] god answers purify my heart jesus
[2:05:47] sanctify me lord i offer myself as a
[2:05:49] living sacrifice to you
[2:05:51] hallelujah that's all you need to do
[2:05:54] if you want results
[2:05:57] if you want to see
[2:05:58] your family
[2:06:00] truly walking in the resurrection
