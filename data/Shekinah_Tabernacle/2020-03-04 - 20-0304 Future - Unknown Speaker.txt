us we pray in jesus name amen praise the lord god bless you all this evening how's everyone doing good good that's good thank you musicians it does feel a little bit more spacious up here it's nice praise the lord um okay um so i'm going to go through this reason um let's go to the next one and we'll just read and then you can have your seats so my thought i've got tonight is called the future who has a future it's in about one seconds time we just arrived that's how the future works um and it's in a small way it's a continuation of what um brother um james spoke about last week but just from a different perspective so um the scripture that i've got for this is um matthew 25 13 and says watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of van cometh you don't know what time in the future that will be you can take your seats um this evening i'm going to go through this uh reasonably quick because i thought this was maybe i thought it maybe i didn't maybe i didn't think about it enough to be concerned but i thought this was actually a normal preaching service not a prayer service so i've lined up a preaching service size sermon so you might not be saying that after an hour brother no look if i go fast i can get through it real quick but i i think by the grace of god we can i believe i'm dealing with intelligent people that can just focus and come through that's and look once again i'm not going to say to you anything that you don't already know i'm not clever enough for that i just sort of get a whole lot of stuff that you do know and put it all together and if you get enough of the same thing people think wow but i'm not giving you anything you're not going to get anything well hey maybe you might but i'm i'm not going to say that i'm going to say that by goes grace's word is just it's it's just nice it's just sound you know and it just all makes sense that's what i love about the word of god it all makes sense if it doesn't make sense we can just wait on the lord and eventually it all makes sense and and everything in life makes sense when we apply the wisdom of god to life and the more the wisdom of god that we get in our life the more life makes sense everything makes sense even things that don't make sense we know why it doesn't make sense we know why this world is a mess and a mess because we're living in a a permissive world-type state that's not going to make any sense so we don't try and make sense of this world and try and make it a certain way because we know it's not going to be that way praise the lord okay so now what we're going to talk about tonight in a few different um aspects of it as is the future right so so but i want to start by by just talking about our ability to see things right because this thing called the future is as a to us as a mysterious area that we don't have access to and it's kind of strange like in a natural sense with our eyes we can see forward right so we look at a road here and we can see down the road imagine if you couldn't see ford if you're going to see backwards you know whatever okay so so we there's a lot of things in life that we have the ability to look into like i can say oh i'm gonna walk down this road to that mountain over there and there's we can walk walk and get to the mountain because we've got the ability to see this way right this might not be relevant but maybe it is we can see like things like numbers we've got the ability to look downwards into numbers and see see a long long way in numbers now numbers all make sense but we've got this ability as a human to we can look down we can make sense of it we can travel if i said to you if you start at one and you count to a hundred if you travel if you go there you'll get to 100. we we know that that's we can look down in that path right this is just we may we i've just given you a few examples of how we have this ability to look forward to to look right we've got this ability also to look at like um action consequence we've got to look forward into that realm as well i like this verse surely the tuning of milk brings forth butter and the ringing of no of the nose bringeth forth blood so forcing a breath bringeth for strife so we can say so you can look ahead and say if you if you beat the butter like this then further down the track you'll have if you beat the cream further down the track you'll have the butter and if you punch some in the nose enough times eventually blood will flow out of his nose so yes knows uh so the forcing of wrath bring a full strike there's this you know we've got this ability to look forward into lots of things it and it helps us actually get around it helps us get by you know this ability to look forward but there's this one kind of frustrating thing that we cannot look into we we something stops us from seeing it we and that's the future that's we're on this we're on this line of time and we only get to see the present we cannot look past that we cannot look past the present and it's it's it's a funny way that humans are made but we all possess the same function right that we that that we're we're stuck in this thing that we actually can't see and nobody can see the smartest man in the world can't see people people all have a future they can't see you you can't see it like i've got this guy here i've got the past and the present and and right on the line there is as far as you can see you can't you can't see one minute ahead of you you can't right and there's this mysterious place called the future that lays before all of us but these things amaze me and amaze my mind like what it did david when he started thinking about the ways of god and he said he just said i can't fathom how this all works it's too such knowledge is too big for me to comprehend right now we look at the future as being something new every day like oh there's a new day tomorrow there's a new future and it's the strangest concept to understand that somebody's been there already this my brain has trouble dealing with this but i believe it i'm just saying i have trouble dealing with it i want to read you the scripture this is jesus speaking he said and when they came now to jerusalem unto beth fudge in bethany at the mount of olives he send us forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as you be entered into it you shall find a cult tied where never man set loose him and bring him so now i know they're going distance but he's saying when you get there in the future you'll find it there it'll be there i often say hey can you go there and pick up this tool someone goes to get the tool oh the tool's not there oh i left it there but in the meantime someone's taken a tool somewhere else so i i was just hoping it would still be there but i wasn't sure it would be there i was presuming it would be there jesus is saying at that point in the future it'll be there when you get to that place then he said and if any man said to you unto you why do you this say him that the lord hath need of him and straight away he will send him hither so also when you get there if someone asks you tell them this and they will tell you this in the future and been there hasn't arrived yet and they found the cult by the door and they went their way and found the cult by the door without in a place where two ways met and they lose him and certain of them that stood there said unto him what do you loosen the cult and they said unto him even as jesus had commanded and they let them go jesus has need of it okay you can take it this event had already happened at some point it was it already happened somebody was there and saw it happen before it happened this amazes me because this makes the world a very very different place when we understand this the world is not just us and going along we know that but it just the more we realize it the less we actually worry and then he said all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold the king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon a donkey and on a cult the foal of a donkey so maybe a thousand years before this someone else has said oh by the way at this point someone's going to this man is going to ride on a hall on a on a cult and he's going to he's going to come riding in on a cult this was even before that happened a thousand years before this or however long it was this is what's going to happen this event had already happened and someone already knew about this event happening somebody's walking around in this place we call the future as if it's the past we just can't see it our eyes we've got something over our eyes that make us not be able to see but someone's seen it all someone's seen it all now i want to i want to just talk about this for a minute because it just to reiterate what i've been saying this is brother branham and he's saying he he was in a he was overseas and he saw the the boy that had been hit i think was a motor accident right then he realized i've seen this before this event has happened before and i've seen it and he said turn back to the fly leaf he's telling the brothers of them you look in your fl in your fly leaf i had people all over america write in the fly leaf of their bibles see if it would come to pass see if it was i said read your fly leaf look look at there i said see them cedar trees see them rocks boy about eight years old light brown hair croc haircut big brown eyes legs broke down hands like this automobile why brother moore that's the boy exactly so he's seen it before we've i've i've seen this event before someone's been there jesus has been there he he walks he walks outside of our time and he's he's been there right he's been into the future this is the great thing about the great test about being a christian is actually the future that's the great test do you think if we that's the really thing that we don't know that if you did if we knew the future we wouldn't have to have faith we we wouldn't have to say i believe the lord will provide because when we say that we say he'll provide in the future it's something where i can't see but i believe he will if we didn't have this call it blindness then and we knew what would happen then we couldn't have faith for that event to happen that's how this that's the beauty of this system that the lord's made all his systems are wonderful okay like like let's just touch on this concept of faith real quick like all of the promises of god are actually the result is in the future where we can't see and that's what faith has to do is take hold of him say in the future this will happen like this because his word says here that it will happen don't forget jesus is standing in the future saying yeah that's what will happen i'm here arranging it for you the way that you believe it if you can take it that way they shall take up serpents and if they drink anything now it shall not hurt them in the future they shall lay hands on the sick that are sick and then in the future they shall recover right right but the thing that accesses the future for us is faith see that that's the thing that ties that ties us to the promise in the future is this thing that's the eyes that actually have the ability to look into the future as the eyes of faith i say we can't see it we actually can if we believe it that way we can we can see into the future because i say i laid hands on this sick person in the future they will recover might be tomorrow might be next week might be week after but faith says they will recover right uh faith it can also in the future could be victory if that's what you so need right um no weapon that is formed against he shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the unjudgement thou shalt condemn in the future if anyone comes against you you will defeat them a name in the name of the lord that's what's your that's what lies in the future for you right this is the hero to drop the servants of the lord and the righteousness is of him or or let's say for blessing you want blessing in your life jesus says that we're talking financial blessing he said those things he said bring me all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith that if not that sometime in the future sayeth the lord of hosts if i will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to contain it that's a that's a so we we so now for for a result in the future by faith right that's how that's how this christian walk works and that's faith is a more mature faith knows it doesn't sort of hope for it it knows it okay if i do this this will happen end of story this is the way it's going to be don't forget now i've kept the pictures of the lord in the future because he's always in the future we worry he doesn't worry he's there he's or he's standing there he's standing in our fearful tomorrow he's right there he's there he knows that he doesn't worry about anything he's just there he has to be there he has to be if he's not there he has to he has to already be there he's already at tomorrow already there right okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna segue slightly here just to bring it from a different perspective then like we can worry about the future a lot of times and it can derail our christian walk if we worry about the future right and now jesus deals with this concept of the future because there's a way that a christian ought to deal with the future that's very very simple and that is don't worry about anything don't worry and don't try and make an effort to make your future better for yourself in this life that's what he said don't make an effort to do that that's contrary to the way that we want to do because we're unsure of the future so we want to make an effort to make it better for us there right but i want to read you these just go through what the bible says therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life i.e what's our life our life is basically the future we're genuinely not we're worried about the future not the past the past has been it's the future we worry about take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not life more than meat and the body than raiment so saying don't even think about it don't even worry about it don't worry about your future behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns you heavenly father feedeth them we think well if i don't do this and this this the next year at this point i'm going to have this and this and this he's saying look at the fouls they don't do any of that they get fed why are you striving to go and do that consider the fouls are you not much more than they what's your view by taking thought can add one cubit to a stature and why take your thought for raymond why were what are you going to put on tomorrow consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet i say unto you that solomon that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these consider that lilia just doesn't do anything doesn't try and get a nice nice clothes it just basically sits back and does nothing and ends up with something that's different than the concept that we think we need to do but this is what the lord is saying that we should be and there's a very important reason why is because if we start thinking on these things then it derails our the word of god that's in us and our christian thrust in our life if we start thinking of our future in the wrong way that's why he said you need don't think about that right wherefore i've got god so clothed the grass of the field which today is in tomorrow's cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe ye a ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or with all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek why because they don't deal in faith in the future they deal and i i don't believe there's any i believe i've got to do it all myself and figure it all out myself therefore i've got to put on all my worldly effort to make my future better for myself and the more that i do that the more of an esteemed human being i am and i'm actually i'm an esteemed honourable human being because look how much i've got for myself for the future but that's nonsense if you're a christian it's nonsense it's a carnal worldly way of thinking that we shouldn't go down that track because we'll derail our christian life for all these things do this gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take no thought for the morrow for the moral shall take thought for itself sufficient until the day is the evil thereof don't worry about it leave it don't even think about it don't worry about it just just seek me in my righteousness and i'll just deal with all that either way right but now we've got to make sure that we understand that the either way god's limited his i think i could say this he's put it he's put a limitation on his contract with us lord you said you'd give me all these things he actually didn't just to just to sort of make it as if i serve god then everything in my life will all just turn out rosy it may not and if it doesn't he never promised that it would yeah right the only real thing is he's promised even in those scriptures with food and clothing when you if you find the other places where we promise you'll get all these other things he said food and clothing he limited as part of the contract to food and clothing because he knows that's actually all you need to stay alive i need food need to be clothed and i live for another day but that's what it says and that's why that's why paul says but godliness with contentment is great gain for we've brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment it has to be there with content so saying if you've got food you've got clothes done you you're sorted the lord has looked after you 100 you've got no problems in the world all right that's that's all that's what it is now i'm going to touch on this one because this is now the parable of the sower so that the the um soil went to sowing some sowed amongst the um just fell on groundwork that just died straight away some fell amongst some um on the wayside although the first one that the birds of the air came and plucked it out the word of god didn't do anything in their life the second one was in sort of stony ground where it took root straight away but then when pressure came on when people realized oh i've actually got to pay a price to serve the lord they weren't interested in making any sort of sacrifice for the lord so that seed died the third one fell among thorns so this word fell into someone's life but it started growing up but then it says but he also then the thorns started to grow around the seed and made the seed not be able to bring forth the fruit of the word that was in it that it was supposed to he also that received the seed among thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world to start putting the effort into into the future to as a care of the world and the deceitfulness of riches because it's not actually bad i can help people the safeness of riches choke the word and become unfruitful right because they they although the word was growing in there they had all these other things in their life we can that choke the word and it becomes unfruitful very very easily can the word of god that's in us become unfruitful because we think we're doing the right thing by by putting effort into the future but we're actually not supposed to put any i know that might sound quite out of left field but that's actually what the bible says oh brother lord call me do this well are you sure are you sure we get programmed into this mode that oh no the you know i really feel but you got to make sure you feel that from the lord it's not just our pressure of conforming to the way that a smart wise person should act and then go and do that do you understand what i mean right because we can easily i want to keep it right because we always you know we can we can get on this track so easily and the word in our life gets choked out now let me say this now the future for for non-christian people is whatever life they have left that's what they call the future this is the life that i've got left that's the future because they believe when i die there's nothing so i've only got 30 years left to live i've got to you know if i don't do it now then in this amount of time i won't have this when i'm this agent right so then i've got to start putting effort in now for that right and i want to read this scripture and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light so meaning that because they only focus on this on the life they have in this world then in the worldly sense they are going to be wiser than us because their efforts are going to be are going to give a better natural result than ours will because we our efforts are not going in towards this life they're going into a life to come right but worldly people are far smarter than us far far smarter because only because they have no faith and they put their effort to achieve things in this life and then that's it they're done like they because they they think they're done right and for a long time i used to think maybe i'm just really dumb you know maybe i'm just not i haven't got a lot enough now to me you know because i i think i'm you know these guys think that they think like that and i think like this you know i used to think i was a bit maybe a low iq i still think that but this has helped me to understand right that that that we as christians we go beyond this future we we our actions are for eternity that's where that's where our effort in this life is for eternity so we're actually one step ahead of the smart people we're sowing into eternity that's why i've got these two and two little brackets laying it up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust hath corrupt and where thieves break through and steal don't put your treasures here jesus sang don't put your treasures there but laugh for yourselves treasures in heaven which is all the things you do for no result all the times you take abuse and don't do anything all the effort you make for nothing it's all there right it's all there at the time it may seem like it's futile but it's not futile it's all there there's an account being saved up laugh yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust earth corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal but where your treasure is there will your heart be also very very easy to get our treasure here very very easy we we are made like that because that's the pride of life and everything kicks in we've got to have this like that guy because i've got to look like i'm sort of i know what i'm doing in the world i've got to make it hey we succumb to that pressure god's not interested in that pressure he's not interested in making us look different either this is the rich man that might put all his effort in you know the scripture but he put all his effort in for here and now and he said i'll say to my soul soul that has much goods laid out for many years take thy knees eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fall this night shall the soul be required of thee then who shall these things be which thou has provided all your effort what's the for all your life's effort for what so is he that lath up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god a life that just lays up treasure for themselves here and is not rich towards god as a wasted life absolute waste of them i don't care what they achieve they've wasted completely wasted their life well i'm here i just want to nail spare time is that all right real quick can i now spare time okay who's got who's got sort of a little bit of spare time who's got lots of spare time okay no one wants to put the hand up because they don't know what i'm going to say they're like i don't want to say that because you might prove me wrong there you go you're white so put your hand down we don't have any spare time no spare time whatsoever i want to show you why we have none nothing right now in order to have something spare you need to have a few components to get an end result right so so in order to have speed you need to first find out how much do i have right so i've got three i have three i've got three phones okay not a good example because how many do i need two right i only need two phones i've got three two then then by this definition the end result the end factor which is one that's what i've got spare right that's that's what we call oh you don't you can take my third phone that spare i don't need it i've got three you need two got one left right let's apply that same you know say that's how that's how spear works that's the concept of spare right so let's apply that definition to to time and our future how much do you have i might have one minute left i might have 20 years left i might have 25 i'm not sure i don't know how much i've got how much do you need well i need all of it actually every single last bit of time i need how much do you have spare none i've got nothing spare i allocate it to places i allocate it there's a huge difference i allocate it if i want to allocate it to wasting it on things that are futile then i can go and do that right we allocate it we don't oh i've got about a couple of days spare time i'll just do nothing no you allocated two days to do nothing we did right that's how it works we allocate it and every moment is precious every moment is hey man we might have one day left so 24 uh 12 hours is half your life left man i've only got half my life i'm gonna and in 24 hours i'll be gone man i'm going to make the most of my last 12 hours of my last 24 hours see that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is meaning redeem the time don't realize you've only got a limited amount of the stuff in the future there's only a small amount there you don't know how much you got redeem it take it real seriously what you're going to do with it take it real seriously and sow into the kingdom of god therefore now this is this is now solomon looking around at this concept and and understanding in all his wisdom that all of this all of these things we do is all futile it's a big complete waste of time he says man work work works works then they die then all this stuff gets passed on and they can't take any of it with him what's the point of all his labor he's starting to look around at the futility of life and he was absolutely correct he says therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for it is all vanity and vexation of spirit that's all this life is if we just put it if we just sow into it that's all that all is that if you take it in that context right that's that brings me on to this that picture like this darts for argument's sake now people can allocate all of their future to throwing a little needle with some little wings on it onto a board on the wall that's about that far away then they go to another tournament and that's what they allocate their life to that's it what did you do with your life i threw needles into a board and you go and talk to them they talk about darts oh that starts they're telling different dart manufacturers you wouldn't believe how much information there is about darts but i can guarantee you these guys could keep you entertained for days about all the different facets there is to darts it's a complete waste of time a complete waste of time just like all sports are it was designed for children to have a little bit of fun kick a ball around you know hey we're just children we don't understand the concept of time we to us it's just it's an endless supply we just want to have fun and play which is fine you know the lord said when your child just enjoy being a youth until you get to solomon's point where you realize there's no it's all vanity then you've got to start thinking i've got to do something with it but when you're a child you just play sports is designed for little children to kick a ball around or run around with a ball not adults adults to run around with a ball and think it's serious it's nonsense i film a lot of sports and i've got to listen to commentators and coaches and that talk in my ear with all the commentary coming through and rambling on for three days about how important they think this thing is that we're watching and and i have this little i always have a i never tell him this but i've always got a i shouldn't say this but it's a waste of words but the judges you know often the judges and certain games get in the way of our camera view and we ask them to move they say i've got to be here because the rules say i must see this line and that line and there i've got to see when the ball's there i feel like saying look chill out mate this is a game it doesn't really matter and it's actually entertainment you know you're an entertainer so i've got i'm behind the camera i'm filming this thing people are watching it for entertainment man no one cares you know i'm actually above you it's not as important as what you think right but it's nonsense and the only reason why that it gets somewhere is because it's entertainment and it entertains people to spend their future watching it now now the the worst thing with this guy is there are people that watch darts spend their life watching darts can you believe that they'll sit down for three days and watch cars go around a circle and so and so one who cares who won where he won what no didn't when the next year is going to come back and do it all over again if and he he gets his cup he can't keep it another guy comes in and then and people are striving they want that cup so there's this big circle it's just to feed men and women into this machine steal their future then they die and go to hell that's all it's for to take their attention take their time and then they end up going to hell they've been entertained to hell because they thought car racing was important darts were important or something it's nonsense it's all nonsense i hope there aren't many sports fans in here i have to say it how does okay so now i'm almost done here but when we think of the future right you know when we're young we think we've got a bright future and everything no and i still believe i've got a great future because with the lord it always gets better right but our concept of the future changes when we're a believer it should get better but unfortunately when we uh you know when we're not a believer it can get quite clear you know that's where people can get depressed and down because they can't see they can see a repetition happening in the future of the past which was bad and that they may think oh it's going to go bad again anyway so but but really when we look at our future the future that we all have what do we have in the future really we we should be able to look according to the fact that someone's already been there and he's given us a few ideas this is what your future is going to look like then we should be able to look at that and say okay what does my future now and this timeline for the next amount of time till the world's done what does it look like and jesus there's a parable here jesus said now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branches eat tender and put us forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise when you shall see all these things no it is at the door it is near even at the door really i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled right so saying at a certain point where you see the fig tree putting forth the spuds which is always israel when you see that putting forth the spuds the generation that sees that will not pass away till it's all fulfilled okay so now i want to do that you probably can't see this map but i've drawn a little arrow map of i think it's 1900 1900 120 years ago you look at the map for israel you'll find turkey uh sorry yeah is it uh yeah yeah the turks yeah the turks the the ottoman empire turks the turks had it was part of that empire they were there that's why the australian light horsemen fighting the turks and and world war one that there was no country called israel as such on the map it didn't exist right now we look at a map in 2000 there's a country there that exists like the the fig tree exists now it's there so you say when you when you see this thing start to grow up out of essentially nothing then this generation that saw that which was 40s won't pass away to all be fulfilled right so there's a specific timeline won't pass away everything's going to be fulfilled that's that's our future that's what lies ahead of us at some point right he said behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord before that happens i'll send you this person then you'll know you'll have that sign and that sign hey two or three witnesses that's enough my future's looking reasonably different than maybe 200 years ago is future my future's looking very different now we might say well i'm going to die anyway well yeah but there's a different concept we should put to it you know and it's should we adjust our life and how we do things based on the information that we know right now this might not seem very wise and there's there's this push always to go the other way but i think about it and i think well it would make logical sense to base my life around information that i know right because the last two slides i showed you i kind of know that but i shouldn't say i kind of know that i know this is pointed out your future's basically coming to an end and you've only got this amount of time it's going to be done right this is going to be done so now you have to you think about that about noah and the lord said unto noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth so the lord said right this is what's going to happen the men are wicked i'm going to destroy them he told noah now based on that information what then should we do if we were back there well i would look around and say well my best bet is probably to help you build this boat and spend and you know be here that's my best bet if i know that's what's going to happen this is my escape this is where i should put my effort in if i didn't believe it i'd just carry on building because the bible said they built they sold their marriage they did all these things they lived their life and well that's not a bad thing to do brother we've got to do this that that yeah well what benefit would it have been for you to do that when in noah's time what benefit it's going to get flooded over in a certain amount of years mate when that boat's done when that boat's built and the rain comes your house is gone oh in 20 years i reap from this orchard don't you understand this is going to happen this is probably you i don't think you'll ever reap from that orchard you understand what i'm saying not to scare us but to really should we change our life based on information we know i think it's it's actually prudent that we should or you think about when when daniel and them were in were in babylon and daniel after a while he said in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books i understood by the scriptures and god saying what the future would be the number of years where of the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of jerusalem i understood that he said for that time you'll be there for about 70 years into the future and then at that time you'll be going back right so he had information about the future that he believed and i set my faith into the lord god to seek my prayer on supplications and fasting with sackcloth and ashes okay the 70 years is almost up that's and our future is now over in israel not here if you now you think about if there were some people that were sort of lukewarm believers that kind of believed that but kind of didn't and they started making an effort to build a business and the place where they were cause after seven years you get to know people you've been there 70 years you've got contacts you're probably quite well-liked you you've mingled into the community you could start building up building a business doing this doing that daniel would've said hey what are you doing oh brother you know got to do these things you know provide for the family hey we're not staying we're not staying here the 70 years is always like we're going back there all the effort you put in here unless you're going to stay here with these guys all your effort is in vain i'm going to keep it that way people always want to correct it back the other one but you know but we do that too much to justify to justify adhering to the cares of this life you know we get about 15 of those to one of these so i'll keep it on this side this is the last quote i'm going to read then i'm done is that all right now now this is brother brown speaking about this and now this this will sort of seem to throw out everything i've said but it doesn't really when you if you be honest about it right should evangelist continue on the field in this hour so they're saying should we just stop you know he's here in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change your thing if jesus is coming in the morning preach today like it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this hour some people say plan like it's 100 years live like it's today but he said don't don't get scruffed up now that's what i'm trying to warn you about see just don't be the odd peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent see come back to god continue in your evangelistic service just as you always did if you're building a house put it on up jesus comes tomorrow you'll be found faithful at that duty yep if you're building a church go on put it up i'd rather be putting my money in something like that and be found let me found with it in my pocket i like that just just keep on continuously everywhere i understand congregation says amen continue right on and just go on as you are now just just don't stop don't do nothing just go right on just as you are keep on serving the lord now for instance if i was if i was working for a man and you know it was 15 minutes before quitting time well you say ah just 15 minutes more so i might as well just go over and sit down you'll get docked for that 15 minutes you've got to you know you've got to work work right till the end if you're planting wheat plant your wheat you're digging potatoes go and dig them out say well nobody will eat them that don't make any difference dig them out anyhow see yeah just continue as you are i got a letter from someone the other day somebody told them well the time is at hand sell the farm you won't need the food that you that you live off of on the farm he said because this millennium is going to start and you won't need it so just go on ahead and while the tribulation period is going on your children is not safe just let them let the children have the farm where they can eat off of it but you'll sell your farm people did that at one point in the book of acts just to keep it in context right they did that and and or something like that and now they had it i said oh my i find it he was coming tomorrow and i was a farmer i'd put my crop in today sure he made me a farmer i'm going to stay at my duty that's right if you made me a mechanic said somebody said the other day a fella came in and said say brother you know what he said i'm going to give you the second set of keys i bought a new car he said i'm going to give you the second set of keys told his pastor said i'm going to give you the second set of keys because the rapture might come you know and i said i won't need it anymore the parcel is going to miss it you see so you keep my keys you stay here you can have the car oh that's making ready isn't it all right but that's the way it is see we mustn't be that way we we must be a sane solid christian see that i'm putting it to work right up to the last minute i've got a job today and i'll be right around faith with the post of duty if he comes in the morning i want to be standing right here in this people you say brother branham if he was to come this morning shouldn't you be out there i said no sir this is my post of duty i'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things i am then when he comes i'll just move right on with him see if i'm hiring potatoes i'll be hiding away just as hard as i can when he comes i'll just drop the hole and take off remember in the jubilee year that was if they was hoeing with a hoe they just kept on hiding they know the julie year was maybe 10 minutes more than the trumpet will sound at the jubilee year they just kept on pitching hey whatever they was doing but when the trumpet sounded then they dropped the pitchfork and gone see that's that's it just keep on pitching handle the trumpet sounds all right now i believe that i believe that's what we should do right but i also believe that we should make sure that what we are doing is the will of god for us and we're not just getting sucked into a care of this life which is very very easy to do because too many times people use that to justify what i'm you know i'm just going to do this and when the lord comes i'll be doing this but maybe they shouldn't be doing that they're doing that to secure their future not that there's anything wrong with that but if they're doing that because they think they need to secure the future therefore they're you can't train them out of it then how can god move how can god move in their life now this might sound oh that's not saying well the bible actually says to think like this think like this think like you didn't you it's a funny concept but he actually said act foolishly to what the world would call foolish see we're wise we we plan for the future and i sort it all out the lord actually said don't think like that don't worry about it i'm just saying what he said that's what he said right and and we just have to be honest with ourselves to make sure am i am i just pushing my way in my future and doing it my way out of fear out of worry out of because i've got a you know i've been so programmed this is the way to go am i am i doing it for that or or am i really pliable could the lord tell me tomorrow stop and i stop i do something else i couldn't care less really really you know that that's what and i believe each one of us are so i'm preaching to the converted here right i'm preaching to the converted but but it's something we all have to always check in our lives you know and and and don't be scared to look foolish to the world to have treasure in heaven it doesn't matter what the world thinks of us oh look at the car they drive whatever no no that doesn't matter the lord doesn't even look at that that's why jesus said it's a sin it's a sin to look upon one person and think that they are better than somebody else based on what they have he actually said in james it's a sin if you someone comes in and you esteem them more than someone else based on natural circumstances he said that's sin that's a strong word sinful behavior that's what he said i was shocked when i read the verse and realized that sin god calls it sin in our life we think sin is murder and adultery and things you see that sin to think like that let um stand this morning uh this morning this evening and we'll just um we're just praying then i'm going to hand the service over to um um brother ben just search your legs we'll pray thank you lord jesus for your grace to us lord and for the ability that we have lord as as just mere humans lord but we have the ability to make you the shepherd of our lives because you've called us lord jesus and lord we just want to daily surrender our life to your leadership lord jesus lord and may we may there be maybe nothing stopping each one of our lives that would that that lord your wish would be our command that if you said come here we go there go this way we go that way lord we we're so pliable in your hands lord jesus that we we we commit not just our life in the past but all of our future to your hands lord knowing that that you're the great shepherd lord that you'll you'll lead us lord and let every path that we go down we don't care whether it seems good or seems bad we know that you're the great shepherd lord and you're leading us through every circumstance also we just thank you that we can have lay our future lay everything in your hands lord and just serve you with all of our heart lord jesus and be faithful in the things that you've called us to do we just thank you lord jesus i pray you'll continue to bless our service as we just um hand it over to brother ben and you'll yes continue to be with us we pray in jesus name amen you can take your seat sorry it was a bit of a habit because we generally have a song afterwards i'm going to hand it to brother ben
