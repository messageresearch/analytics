you already had an awesome one with brother isaac this morning but if you knew how accurate this message is i heard a couple of brothers and sisters say how timely brother isaac sermon is if you would know how timely it is just watch this space that's how timingly it was i hope you listen this morning because then you won't miss your blessing now okay so ben you you may be dismissed we're going to jump into the scripture and we're going to go into the the book of psalms so don't worry it's a lengthy reading i'm just going to read the first one then you can can you make yourself comfortable well like brother always says i'll keep standing god bless brother as well what awesome people we have in our church okay don't get old don't don't get all now listen let's not get all starchy let's not all get servicing mode okay this is a sunday school i'm gonna move around i'll come and and knock at your door if there's something but i want you to just jump in my brain for a second and just follow where i go just try to to take this journey i even put slides up for me to put slides up is a big thing so even all i want you to do is catch the thought and see where we're going and if you can catch that i promise you will not leave you without your blessing okay so don't get distracted whatever happens if you get distracted if your friend distracts you please stand up and go sit somewhere else just this is for you one this is for you momo this is for you jonathan this is for you ab this is for you reuben kiera joshua it's for you all of you individual not for all of you for you so let's start talking to the lord this is david in psalm 19 verse 24 to 37 he says thy testimony are also are my delight and my counselors my soul cleaveth unto the dust quicken thou me according to thy word quicken thou me according to thy word i have declared my ways and thou heardest me teach me thy statutes see that's going and then he says make me understand the way of thy precepts so shall i so shall i talk thy wondrous works of thy wondrous works my soul melted for heaviness strengthen thou me according unto thy word it's again unto thy word remove from me the way of lying and grant me the law of grace of graciously die lord graciously i have chosen the way of truth thy judgments have i laid before me so you may be seated so i don't want you to stand so long he goes on to say and he says i have stuck i have stuck unto thy testimonies oh lord now remember the word testimony i want you to concentrate on this word does this thing have a pointer testimonies okay i want you to focus about testimony because there's going to come apart in your life a place in your life if you choose life or death if you choose god or satan if you choose the world or heaven what you choose you're one day going to be called for a testimony here on earth and in heaven think about it here on earth and in heaven and i'll explain myself now in due time i will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart teach me o lord the way of thy statutes and i will keep i shall keep it unto the end give me understanding and i shall keep thy law yea i shall observe it with my whole heart so david is having a one-on-one year with the lord so david is not just happy with a normal everyday walk he wants to talk to the lord every day personally the mighty king david that went through so many things is saying to the lord i see i i i not we not us not them but i so meaning that this walk is a very very very personal walk between you and god no one else's revelation no one else's teaching no one else's vision no one else's thoughts could change you from what you and god are talking about i might not know what's going on in mormo's life but god does know because every day when more more thinks god listens and now brother brother isaac come and preaches surveillance man what a sermon but see even if you talk inside of your heart even if you speak to god here no matter what you say even if you say i don't understand i don't think it's not clear everything you say in here god hears god sees and is going to help you to get where you need to go because he's not a god of confusion okay if i'm going to i'm going to go like brother and call you out if you are not listening hey okay so i think i'll skip these but go read some to go go read this song this is a wonderful song because what happens is it basically psalm 119 is a big psalm but when you go from verse 24 and you go all the way to the end and the year where i am is 30 yeah here 37 so let's get that one up he says make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein do i delight incline my heart unto thy testimonies their testimonies again and not to covetness turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity okay so be holding things that that will will go away without self-image anything in the world anything that will exalt you above the word of god turn my eyes away from those things i want to be in your word and quicken and thou me in thy way so we're going to talk about mr jonah mr jonah he's not here so i'm saying you're going to be called out on your testimony david is asking lord keep me in thy testimony not just mine but thy testimony so we've got jonah jonah god goes to john he says now the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amitai saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me so i'm watching i've got my i've got my eye upon them and they're getting wicked same with sodom and gomorrah this morning see what i'm talking about the preaching over the pulpit see what's happening god is trying to warn all of us big and small that there's coming a time where we get to a place where the wickedness of this world is irking god and he repents that he made man but he never just punishes he first warns but now he says you go and you go warn them mr noah you gonna jonah you're gonna go and warn them please go warn them now how many of you have been called to be a witness how many can i see some ants amen all of you sitting here is accountable that you are a witness why because you're not sitting here with no accident god didn't call you here to this sermon this church and this fellowship and this wendy wellington just to fade away he called you for a witness because there are wicked people out there that needs to hear god's wrath is going to pour out upon this world and they might not even know about it but somebody has to say it somebody's going to go out so there you are in your school there you are in your workplace there you are in your church people walking away from church how many youth do we have in this church i don't see them all here who's the witness who's the witness so if we all just stay away what's going to happen to the kingdom of god if we all just give up who's going to warn these people because if you look at the story of jonah and we'll get there but the there's a wonderful part in the story where god goes and shows the prophet and says i need to send you because these people wanted to repent i knew their hearts though i grieved me and they were wicked and i was going to punish them and destroy them i know that if i send you i send you jonah the way you will preach the word of god the way you would live it was going to get them to repent and then i will give them grace but see jonah no man he was in a little bit of a world of his own he says but jonah rose up and flee he ran away a prophet called by god flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord he didn't even want to have nothing to do with it so god calls him and says hey here you are in wellington here you are as a witness for me in this end time brother isaac is preaching time is no more it's later than we think and i need you to go get the last ones but what are we doing we flee because the world is so nice natasha's for me is just driftwood darstars is for me is a place of safety where you can do just what you want because you're a christian and you're saved tarshish for me is a place where you can go where you feel safe because you're in your comfort zone that's darsha's so when when jonah was asked to go he just fled into his comfort zone because then i don't have to talk about god i don't have to stand in front of friends that says there's no god i don't know have to be in a workplace where everybody walked past me uses the name of the lord in vain i don't have to share a testimony back to someone to say hey but wait there is a heaven and a hell no tarshish is a place where i can just fade away into the background and nothing ever happened don't worry oh he's a christian but he's nice because he he never says it as it is he hides it all he just sweeps it under the carpet he's one of us i ain't one of this world i am not come to this world to be one of this world i am a witness and a testimony and i want you to realize at a very young age you will always be tested on your testimony satan is always going to call you out when you least expect it when you're having the most fun or when you're at the lowest point in your walk with god satan is going to come and say are you a christian and it's usually the people the closest to you that hurts you the most so i'll rather prepare you for it and know that when this comes god will put the words in your mouth but are you willing to speak those words or do you just run to tarsus come on it's easy to run to tasha's it's easy to keep quiet when your friend says no let's just do this rather than go to church or let's just do this rather to go to the next youth event oh i just couldn't be bothered i'd rather stay at home who is those people and why are we as christians happy with that conduct who is standing at that time for the lord and saying no you know what i will still go because i'm a christian we need that god needs it because remember you're not representing you're not representing just hannah you're not representing momo as momo or armantazar you are representing the kingdom of god so when you stand you you're a representative of god first before you are mad because every prophet that spoke through every age had a name every prophet had a name but god had to call them first before their name was made known as a prophet and had to vindicate them so you never know when god says to you to say something if you keep quiet you get in trouble no i don't want to go too far away but look now this man this prophet loving god believing in god runs from the presence of the lord and he went down to joppa and he found the ship going to tarshish and he paid them he paid the ship to take him away away from the presence of god this is how this world is we pay games we pay movies we pay everything out there to get us away from the presence of god we pay for entertainment the biggest commodity today is entertainment data internet all the faults you see there people pay to have that on their phones they pay to go to a place where they're comfortable it's the same it's the same no i'm not i'm not just fighting but i need to lay something here so that we realize is this is a time where there's life and death there is a time where there comes that decision what you're going to do and unfortunately being a dad i see that time for my sons coming closer and closer and closer and the older they're getting and the older you're getting the more you're gonna fight these battles and it's gonna happen but i'll rather have you being ready for the devil when he has a punch then just get knocked out the first time right because i got knocked out i come from the world and i still today pick up pieces that i got knocked out because nobody told me this like that man that brother isaac preached about what came to heaven and he says i was a good person but when his life started being displayed on that big tv he couldn't hide anything now i don't want us to be there that's my job okay jonah so now here comes the testimony pod remember i said hold on to this testimony part here it says so now he's on the boat storm breaks up we all know the story big storm breaks up and these guys are get together and they go in the in the story it says and they each one pray to their own god that's what it says there in the story just before we get here and he says and then they said unto him because they now caught him he was sleeping in the boat because he's a christian so he doesn't care about a storm okay because he knows god is in control of everything though he's still running away from god he was fast asleep in the boat he says and then they called wake him up and say please pray unto your lord he says and then they said unto him tell us we pray thee now here comes it for what cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation what are you where have thou cometh from what is thy country and of what people are thou yeah so they ask you so who are you who are you you come here into down there and come and work here and do those things but who are you who told you to come and be awful righteousness in here who are you who says this is wrong who says gays and lesbians and those things are wrong who are you to say it this is what they do because you're rocking the boat when you come as a christian into a workplace and you stand for the truth then they want to know who are you why do you not play games there's nothing wrong with games huh why don't you watch all these filthy stuff on the internet or all the stories why don't you know the newest superhero story avengers plus -17 or whatever why don't you know it because i don't look at it but they're going to ask you out on it now here he comes and he said to them i'm a hebrew and i say to them i'm a christian i don't do those things i don't believe it's right because the bible says it's not right fear and he says and i fear the lord and the god of heaven which have made the sea and the dry land that's his testimony then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto them why has thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord because he had told them so jonah on the boat had to come clean and go boys you know what i got it wrong god said i have to go here and i decide i'll go here and now the storm is upon your boat and you're all gonna die pretty much if you don't throw me over the side and they go these people they go we can't throw you over the side we don't want your blood on our hands he goes but god said you have to do it it's thus say of the lord so he has to go over the side and the moment they threw him over the side of the boat everything went gone and then they were exceedingly afraid so now i'm asking you when the boat is wrong and people ask your testimony and you say but i'm a christian i don't do these things brother muppo said it so nicely my feet will not let me go into this place he'll just turn around right here and go this way but my feet cannot let me go into a bar because they got designed from heaven to go in there but it's not him it's his feet his feet's telling him he's walking there and he goes no i can't do this and then i just walk this way and then the guy goes but why don't you do it this is because i'm a christian so he comes to a place where he has to share his testimony with someone because the people like it or not the world is watching you they're watching you so close not because they want you to slip up but they want to see if this rapture is real now think about it one moment they see you one moment you got okay because it will be a twinkling of the eye and you'll be gone and all the 20 years you've been spending in that company working for them every time you've been saying the rapture's coming the lord's coming this day is going to end they look at you and you're gone what then then they will be filled with exceeding fear because there was a testimony in this church sorry if i bore you now here's another testimony who knows the story he's a dude on the rope and there's someone there on the top letting them go down what's that story yes no yes what's her name who likes rayab now rayab she had a testimony as well these two spies comes to her house she goes and hit them and then she goes she tells them and she said unto them i know that the lord has given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us and that the inhabitants of the land faint because of you of what you did you crossed the red sea you went out of egypt you slew the kings of the amorites and you had the king of shylon and gog og and as soon as they hear these things our hearts did melt neither did they remain any courage in any man because of you christian standing in a workplace saying the lord's gonna come the lord's gonna come she had a testimony that came via the grapevine and when two believers came into her house she knew that was her chance to get salvation for a whole family two believers it took to enter into our house and say good morning sister how are you doing we came on some business we we came to look something for the king you know you know we've got caleb and joshua they they're taking the land they go oh no i know all about you just go hide away and then when they came out she said we know about you because you guys are just giving us the creeps because everybody is just dying around you and you're just conquering every nation and the waters even open up and you walk over it on drive and she had a testimony she was scared but it took the two guys to go to her but when they showed up the work was already done because the testimony of joshua and caleb already arrived in this city before they even beseeched it so the whole big walls jericho all those things were already scared of these guys coming because the testimony went went forth so again your testimony will come back and i'm not angry i'm actually happy i just want to get something here man running away from the presence of the lord how many wishy-washy that's what too many christians are today soft soap and everything until they think they just join a church go somewhere put their name on a book and a little something jump up and down shout something like that and they call that christianity christianity is a everyday rugged life living for god in this present world amen that's christianity that's the definition of christianity brother isaac preached on it as well that's why he found himself six times here maybe he'll be here seventh time and then that's us we've gone i love the numbers but see there was a there was a in there christianity is everyday rugged life he said that little dog who remembers that little dog that he thought he was just a puny dog but that dog had so much fight in him and he said that's it that's it he might be the smallest dog but he thinks he's the king of the block and he acts and conducts himself as the king of the block okay little dog i don't think he'll stay little so it is a consistent burning of fire and love of god so we get our judgment here unfortunately us as christians the moment we as kids we said i have decided to follow jesus then the fire falls and unfortunately when fire falls it burns and it is tough when your best friend tells you i don't believe in god it is tough when a lot of people tell you we don't believe in god show me god joshua this morning how many of my colleagues come to me and say okay here i am show me god where's god i want to talk to him right now don't you think someone that met the lord has seen the miracles he can do standing and looking at a guy that's a real good guy and he's just not seeing it just not seeing it blind to it my dad asked the same question and guess what he made god but he asked that out of respect and humility and these people are asking it out of defiance but that's not your fight you just live that's not your fight you just live the life if you defy the work word of god you're already blinded to it you shall never see the kingdom of god okay unless he gives you grace you cannot see it so if you've asked it's same going to your dad and asking him dad can i have 20 bucks you say hey you owe me 20 bucks you're gonna get two different results from your dad i can promise you that one would be a loving kind yeah maybe i'll give you one the other one will go sorry because your approach is wrong well we're not going there sorry i want to i want to speak about this so we know now we're not wishy-washy chris christians but here we go another one and now this is where you need to please realize this is where my thought came from this little verse right here but it's easy to go the way of the world it is easy to flow down the stream go out there and sit down at the river with your boat so all picture we're in our boats give a bit of space give a bit of space give a little space come on you boys i like it give a bit of space you're in a boat the river's flowing that way so which way are you supposed to be rowing the river's flowing that way which way are we rowing we're rowing up the river why because if you stop rowing what's going to happen okay so you stopped rowing where you going now he's still rowing so you're still standing still you're still rowing ruben went all around now you went as well he's gone as well those two are still rowing so stop rowing here she goes no you stop throwing as well you go as well so just these two are still rowing it's easy to stop the boat and just drift it's much more fun to just let the boat go down the river and it's all nice because if i row my arms get tired hey if you can you think you can do that for the rest of the service like this you tell me how your arms feel okay i might just leave you to do that he says here you will get your oars and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just once let loose of those ores and watch how fast the trees passes past you going down but you but you look where you are going when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you are going towards the falls and you won't be long until you're going to go over that falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but you must accept your responsibility keep on rowing but not keep on rowing okay so now he says here when you stop rowing and you the greater the older ones when you stop rowing mr sander don't stop rowing when you stop rowing you will go with the river and when you go with the river there is consequences amen i'm sorry but there is consequences so here we go and the devil that deceived them all was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and it shall be torment meant it day and night forever and ever now remember that for ever and ever is not eternity it's a time it's a time and a time okay so it's not eternal that forever ever is just a time at all the white throne judgment where they'll be be called before the lord and it says here and i saw a great white throne and him that sat upon it whose face the earth and heaven fled away and were found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was opened which is the book the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works workers of iniquity works when they had to stand for the lord their works show different christians and let's say not christians or not they just said they were dead i'll explain to you what death is now not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father which are the heaven many will say to me on that day lord lord heaven we prophesied in thy name and in thy name heaven we cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works the name of jesus christ talking it's easy to sing it easy to sing and i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity iniquity means something you know and you don't do something you know you ought to do but you don't do it that's iniquity that means god's coming and revealing to you something to say hey it's really important to come to services like this because we don't preach at you just because we think you're bad it is to strengthen you and to help you to see maybe around you because these brothers and sisters around all of you that might be struggling and you're the key you're the key that can unlock that door you because god can preach through the trees he can preach to the roof he can preach through a rock he can preach through anything but he chose you and these people dying in this church as we speak as we speak because we're failing to keep our testimony we're failing to stand in the gap and praying for them how many of you sincerely pray for your brothers and sisters how many at night goes on their bed and kneel and sit put your face in your bed and start crying for your brother that's just walked out of the church but it's easy to say right from wrong it's easy to say they're doing it wrong and look at him but who is bringing him before the lord because god needs those cries god needs it but here we stand and we just accept it ah it's just not for them one of your brothers walk away out of your house say i don't believe in the lord what would you do you can't beat him into a submission what will you do you're going to follow or you're going to go into battle mode into warfare and start fighting back what are you going to do it's happening you tell me youth of today i'm looking at all of you how many is here that's supposed to be here you count i just want to know how many should be here and where are they what are we as a church what are we we we here we showed up what are we going to do to get them back here where's the fire falling not out there and it says here whosoever have these sayings of mine and do with them will be likened unto a wise man which build his house upon a rock driftwood now i'll preach a bit okay i'm done now i've done all the all the boring stuff now we talk okay driftwood tell me one good thing about driftwood oh i like you rebecca my high five you go what can you do with driftwood you can okay so what do we do with what drift would we burn it we burn it we burn it so here is a tree that's grown let's fall over that fell into a river that's drift all the way to the sea ended up in the seashore dad goes to this chainsaw he cuts it up cuts it up hurts very much and then he eventually throws it into there so what's the use of driftwood yeah throw it in the fire okay where's that driver going so he stopped growing he stopped growing he didn't fight the current he gave up he's dead and he stopped rowing where is he going he's going there and now from there where is he go into the fire so is driftwood good we don't want to be driftwood now tell me look at that one there there's a tree and there's a river that was flowing in my animation it just doesn't want to do it on this one but that river is flowing and the snow covering this tree tell me how does that tree feel who he's cold but he's a driftwood no it's still planted so do i always have to be happy and bubbly no do i always understand everything that comes over this pulpit no but you see that tree is still planted and that water is still flowing but it didn't become part of that river now there is the most beautiful rich trees i'm thinking it's a maple canadian maple tree or something like i don't know beautiful color and it's autumn so another season where it's a bit dry and he's just struggling he just he doesn't want to be here he's been sitting in church the whole day and now he comes and this guy with a big nose is sitting here and preaching at him and he's just i just can't anymore i'm just tired i just want to sleep and it feels like that i'm just about to fall asleep but where's the tree tell me where's those trees stole by the water hey so you still showed up though i'm the most boring thing you want to see now you still showed up ah okay where's that tree whoa man makes me thirsty i just want to drink some water right now he's out of fellowship bye huh he has no ways he's brothers and sisters show me those three brothers and sisters brothers and sisters where's that trees oh but he doesn't have excuse that tree does it because look at his leaves he's still growing because this tree has a personal walk with the lord jesus christ and the god said i will water you day and night. so not your circumstances but i the lord will give you strength and that tree is growing in the middle of a desert why because it's good to be in fellowship but there's no excuse if you get out of fellowship to walk away from the lord no excuse because it's god first brothers sisters mom dads all those things last sorry it's true god said i come to divide not to unite because i'm a jealous god and i want all the attention where's that tree now the rest of this is about that eye it's about that eye okay it's a massive waterfall is that driftwood okay what's flying there seagulls or eagles i just hope it's eagles and not seagulls but okay pick up the purpose too they're rats with wings they eat everything and clean everything up seagulls but they're really annoying those are eagles flying there i just said pretend i'll make it eagles so that plant tree is on a mountain this high having a jubilee and he's singing it's bubbling it's bubbling it's bubbling every day so some days you find yourself here christians some days you find yourself here some days you find yourself here i pray you don't find yourself here or there now i'm going to ask you one thing i want you to now just think about yourself because this is my whole lesson i don't have much more i know it was the blood there's a scripture i wanted to read and i just want to end with that and then i want you to think about where you standing with god at this moment can we go to philippians 3 verse 9 and verse 10 this is my bible i used to use this phone for everything but god now i use this phone to further the kingdom of god awesome i the devil don't like it he tried to make me sick before i came here he says and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith i need faith that i may know him in the power and the resurrection of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made con conformable unto his death now what that means in short is may you be found in jesus christ before you get found in this world now how many of you and this is where you get to speak to the lord and i maybe give you just a couple of minutes i want you now to just maybe separate their boys a little bit from each other more you move there and there in the middle just there's a reason there's a lot of space in here which is good i want you to think quickly just quickly are you driftwood or are you a tree okay so if you're a tree and there's wood drifting past you what should you do help them pray for them we come up whatever it needs to be done that's what we need to do so you came to a youth service you didn't need to be here i didn't want to preach we wanted to do a skit today but it didn't work out that way and i'm glad i didn't because when brother isaac started preaching this morning see the thing that we forget as children is you think that you have no power because you're just a kid is that right kid is a goat you're not a kid you're a child of god though you're still a child you're a child of so who's got power who's got the most power in the whole whole universe who's super duper awesome triple power everything yes why because i got god so can you pray and things change so do you want things to change in this church do we want things to change in this church yes you know why we're all here somebody prayed for you you know that you know why you're here just because your mom and dad comes no why why are they there brother isaac why did you come here brother why did you come here huh brother james you you shared same same similar stories than i do just a bit more next level but where did you come from and what brought you here and if it was so nice out there what are you still doing here why do you come every sunday every monday when it's hot when it's cold why are they here there's no excuse for staying at home if you can be here if you are sick and you're in bed you've got a massive headache or something like that i could understand but we are here because we want everyone to be here now there is some children that that recently and this is your burden this is where i want to bring it into your your lap that either can't make it by a circumstance or just not the decided to follow jesus now i want to ask your children what can we do about it so can we pray for them can we honestly now in this service pray for them do you think it's fair now i want to ask you something do you think they'll come in yes because who can stop the prayers of the saint nothing nothing can stop the almighty god's power if you pray with sincerity so why don't we as a church start praying for our brothers and sisters young and old instead of saying what's wrong instead of pointing out the driftwood but actually praying for them can we do that as young ones i don't need to preach to the old ones i'm talking about you you're the you're the ones that that is in the middle of it right who understands if somebody walks away who understands it i don't i don't understand why somebody would not choose life but is it going to stop me praying for it so let's pray i want you all to take time now close your eyes and pray together with me you can pray out loud you can pray in your heart doesn't matter all i want you to do is be sincere now and pray for someone that you know that needs it right now just one person whoever is in your heart who is even your head i want you sincerely go before god now and say lord jesus be merciful bring them back let's close our eyes lord jesus we love our brothers and sisters so much lord and church is not the same without them here lord i've got so many prayer requests on my heart that i i just see children lord jesus walking from the face of god lord and good children lord with praying parents lord and devout christian homes that they were raised in lord and lord satan is trying them lord and they need help father they need reinforcements they need what brother isaac said today they need your bodyguards around them lord jesus they need mercy and they need grace father so every child in this church i know has someone in their heart even one of their friends lord that really need you lord jesus that truly needs to know that you live and i pray today of all these children lord that they will be witnesses unto thee that they would be living trees no matter in what season in their life but be living trees for you lord jesus lord that what they do and what they set out every morning lord for your kingdom lord let there not be children in this church that's a false witness that is lord sitting in school and hiding away like noah lord jesus oh jonah lord sorry lord because jonah lord he refused to be in your presence he refused to be that testimony lord to go down lord to nineveh and speak to those people who were ready to receive your word lord jesus he forsook that and lord he had to go through many a trials to put him on that place so that you could use him and even then lord he didn't understand how you saw the whole situation lord but we want to see how you see lord and we know that our prayers it matters we know that if every son and daughter of god matter how big and or how small lord comes before the king and bows down and asks for your help lord jesus that all hell will shake lord jesus because we are believers and they said that all things are possible to them that believe this prophet ours lord jesus came with nothing new but the truth no man spoke like this man lord because he came and told the truth lord jesus and no matter what this world says we are sold out lord to the truth and the message of this hour now lord i just want to ask if there is children in here that don't believe this if there's anyone in your lord jesus that haven't met you personally or decided to follow you lord or even lord has the desire in the heart at the moment even to follow you lord may you come to their pew may you come to this seat now right now in the name of our lord jesus christ as the great creator lord i didn't come in and stand here lord and talk to these guys for anything of me lord but to introduce christ to each child lord jesus and each mom and dad or jesus because that is what is in my heart and that is if we are outside of you if we are outside of you lord it is certain death it is firewood lord it is driftwood lord and i don't want to be driftwood lord jesus i want to be a tree lord that stands against the elements and draw my strength from you o lord the the river of god flowing through the city of god lord jesus lord i pray that these children may realize that they have a great commission towards their friends that on their age their testimony could set someone free if if lord if jonah never shared that message the princes of that city wouldn't have said to the whole city to repent put satcloth and ashes over all the animals over everything and ask god for mercy lord and it was granted unto them and a whole nation a whole nation came to repentance because of one man that went and just did as he was told lord lord may we not forsake to do what we are told right now to be a witness in our schools in our workplace lord even in this church when someone is doing something that's not not pleasing to you lord as hard as it may be that we would correct them out of love in a nice way saying have you thought about this lord because we receive our correction here this is your bride lord my brother isaac said today so wonderful we get corrected here lord so that we don't go through the right throne judgment and we don't get judged there lord jesus the books are open and they that were found in the lamb's book of life they don't get judged lord because they accepted your sacrifice lord may our children stand between the living and the dead may they stand between the driftwood and the trees lord and just keep bringing the ones coming in lord say come in come be a tree come grow by the waters come to a sunday school meeting lord come and see because there's always something we can learn in season that can help us lord just come anyways even if you don't feel like it just come oh lord jesus just come lord and those that's not here those that's not here lord jesus i cry out for them and say lord may they hear the voice say to them come may they hear your voice calling them back into this place lord jesus so that they could they could see and open their eyes again lord take that take that nakedness away from them lord and clothe them in your righteousness i pray lord every child dear may you go with them this week and may they know lord that they will be called upon a testimony one day and they are going to be called out if you're a christian or not and what you would believe and lord i pray in the name of our lord jesus christ that you will give them the right words to speak that would give glory to god and your kingdom and not to this world i pray thee give them brave hearts lord give them lord give them a boldness to stand lord in this day we others can't stand i pray this in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ amen amen amen so sorry i didn't want to go so long you've done very well give yourself standards summers are falling asleep already but i'll tell you this i'll rather be here in church than be out there in the world not because i'm doing the preaching but i don't listen as well and i'm telling you that sermon this morning just amazed me how god can be so accurate sister priscilla sister landy come on testify things that we speak about before we walk in joshua said it how many people said things that we speak and it comes over the pulpit that's no man that's not man that's god so you say you can't see god all i'm telling you all i can see is god amen can the resistance come we play one song we just play a song i think we'll think it's bubbling i want to leave with its bubbling please if it's all right or maybe yeah let's sing it's bubbling i'll play all the guitar it's fine we'll do it in the key of d that's all i can play listen boys you're gonna get called for a testimony sisters your testimony you're going to get called upon it might not be in the form of some some let's say at work or a church might be another brother it might be even someone that's very close to you don't sell your testimony for no one i said this morning maybe i share this with you what if everything ends today and you stand before god i want you to understand what if today is all of our last day and we find ourselves right in the presence of god i said it to the sunday school this morning if there is nothing if there was no god okay and you lived a christian life loving other people and caring for other people what do you have to lose what do you have to lose you took care of the widow you prayed for your brother you were caring for other ones when some people were poor you gave to them when something it's a good life so even just christian values is a good life so if if they say there's no god and everything ends today when you leave this earth people will miss you they will miss you because you had an influence in their life because of your christian you being surrendered to god but i'll bring the flip side what if you get to heaven and it's all true and the ones that live a real un circumcised life a real terrible life stand before this great god and now it's all playing in front of him what then don't think it will be bubbling would it and then you'll be standing in front of that god and that god will say come in my true and faithful witness enter into the joys of the kingdom right isn't it worth it for this little bit of time here on earth let's all stand up
