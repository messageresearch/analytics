[34:30] morning couldn't find my bible so it's
[34:32] been one of those days
[34:34] but um praise the lord i'm glad the word
[34:36] is still the same
[34:37] i have tabs my other bible it's kind of
[34:39] cheating and maybe that's what's um
[34:41] anyway
[34:43] praise the lord we are here in isaiah 43

[34:47] here if you're going to turn me down
[34:49] here yeah please
[34:52] so this verse here this people

[35:05] and we're going to read from verse 23 in
[35:08] john 14.
[35:10] here
[35:18] so john 14 and from verse 23 we're going
[35:21] to read down to verse 30.
[35:23] it says jesus answered and said unto him
[35:25] if a man loved me he'll keep my words
[35:27] and my father will love him and we will
[35:29] come unto him and we'll make our abode
[35:31] with him he that loveth me not keepeth
[35:34] not my sayings and the word which you
[35:35] hear is not mine but the father which
[35:39] sent me
[35:40] i'm just making sure i'm in the wrong i
[35:42] mean in the right
[35:44] place yes
[35:46] these things have i spoken unto you yet
[35:48] being present with you but the comforter
[35:50] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[35:52] will send in my name he shall teach you
[35:54] all things and bring all things to your
[35:56] remembrance whatsoever i have said unto
[35:57] you peace i leave with you my peace i
[36:00] give unto you not as the world giveth
[36:04] give i unto you let not your heart be
[36:07] troubled neither let it be afraid
[36:10] you have heard how i said unto you i go
[36:12] away and come again unto you if you love
[36:15] if you loved me you would rejoice
[36:18] because i said i've gone to the father
[36:20] for my father's greater than i
[36:22] and now i have told you before
[36:25] it come to pass that when it has come to
[36:27] pass
[36:28] ye might believe hereafter i will not
[36:31] talk much with you for the prince of
[36:33] this world cometh and hath nothing in me
[36:37] amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer
[36:39] there if you want to be remembered in
[36:40] prayer you remember it's not a tradition
[36:42] the lord remembers us when we pray
[36:44] amen i believe that every prayer he
[36:46] answers and he remembers and he hears
[36:49] amen so let's let let's pray uh this
[36:52] afternoon this evening together gracious
[36:54] heavenly father
[36:55] thank you lord that we
[36:57] we truly do need you more
[37:00] and i want to thank you that in your
[37:01] presence is truly where we find home
[37:04] lord it's not necessarily a physical
[37:05] location upon the earth but our home is
[37:07] anew
[37:08] lord because there's a call in our
[37:10] hearts to another world to a better
[37:12] world to an eternal world where there's
[37:14] no death no sin no suffering no violence
[37:17] down there it's peace forevermore it's
[37:19] sublime as the prophet said as he came
[37:22] lord he went there beyond the curtain of
[37:23] time as you know then you brought him
[37:24] back here and he tried to describe the
[37:26] atmosphere what it was like he said
[37:28] sublime it's far above anything that
[37:30] could be in human language and we want
[37:32] to thank you that we're pilgrims on our
[37:34] way to that great land i just want to
[37:36] ask father as brother martu has asked
[37:38] for prayer for uh jason his his friend's
[37:41] brother brendan strang
[37:44] that last sunday he went to church and
[37:46] mastered him for the first time and he
[37:47] needs to find the lord father i pray you
[37:49] just give him such a sincere heart lord
[37:52] may he seek you with all of his heart
[37:53] lord because your word says they that
[37:55] seek me with all their heart shall find
[37:56] me
[37:57] father may he not be seeking to join a
[37:59] church law but may be seeking to meet
[38:01] you please maybe put that in his heart
[38:03] lord we know there's a deep calling to
[38:05] the deep lord there must be a reason
[38:07] he's been stirred up and he's looking
[38:09] father and i pray dear god bring him all
[38:11] the way home unto you lord into the true
[38:12] baptism of the holy ghost seal his soul
[38:15] away for eternity for your glory grant
[38:18] it dear god and we just lord any other
[38:20] need that's in our midst father unspoken
[38:22] or anything father i pray you'd meet
[38:24] every need lord you see the burdens and
[38:26] the questions and the troubles that we
[38:27] may be carrying but i want to thank you
[38:29] lord we can let off the pressure tonight
[38:31] lord we can come into your presence just
[38:33] lay it all at your feet just rejoice
[38:35] give you praise just want to ask you be
[38:37] with us lord hear those who are watching
[38:39] by the way the internet be their portion
[38:41] to father i pray you'd increase our
[38:43] faith like never before put such
[38:45] stabilizers in our life father that we
[38:47] don't that that we're not tossed to and
[38:49] fro by man's opinion or the climate or
[38:51] whatever is going on but maybe just be
[38:53] steadfast ensuring you grant it father
[38:55] for your glory in jesus christ's name
[38:58] amen
[38:59] amen god bless your friends you may have
[39:00] your seats tonight um i would like to
[39:04] uh
[39:05] kind of
[39:07] approach the subject and and um
[39:09] you know the last time we sung that song
[39:11] i see
[39:12] your promises and fulfillment all over
[39:14] my life
[39:15] i love that song
[39:17] to me it's it
[39:18] it's it's it's our
[39:20] theme song
[39:21] i think when we see god's fulfillment in
[39:23] our lives
[39:25] because we know that we're living in the
[39:26] time when all things would be fulfilled
[39:28] where every prophecy speaking of the
[39:30] bride would be manifested in a people as
[39:33] as jesus would say or rather jesus
[39:35] through peter would say and i think acts
[39:37] 3 or 4 he said that he said that heaven
[39:40] must receive the lord jesus christ until
[39:42] the restitution of all things so that
[39:44] word restitution is a restoration so the
[39:47] lord cannot come until we are restored i
[39:50] mean part of the restoration or
[39:51] restitution of all things is us the
[39:53] bride coming back to her position that
[39:55] she was on the day of pentecost and i
[39:57] believe we're living in that day and i
[39:59] believe more than we're just living in
[40:00] it but we're experiencing it
[40:02] amen so i just want to go in a little
[40:05] bit today where where the lord jesus
[40:07] says that the prince of this world has
[40:08] no part in me
[40:10] he has nothing in me the lord would say
[40:12] that's the last statement that we read
[40:14] there in in john 14 and 30 the prince of
[40:17] this world cometh and he has nothing in
[40:19] me
[40:20] now a few other um
[40:22] i looked at a couple other bible
[40:23] translations with this um with this
[40:26] verse and it says in the uh english
[40:28] standard version it says he has no claim
[40:30] on me now all this applies to you as
[40:32] well
[40:33] he has no claim on me then in the
[40:35] contemporary english version it would
[40:37] say but he hath no power over me and i
[40:40] think all those things stand very true
[40:42] tonight amen he has nothing in me so
[40:44] there's no part of me in him and i have
[40:46] no pardon him amen right so he's got
[40:48] nothing in me i've got nothing in him
[40:50] there's a parting of ways there was a
[40:52] clear-cut parting of ways there wasn't
[40:55] while i had my foot in his camp and my
[40:57] other foot in god's camp and just be
[40:59] have enough religion to make me
[41:00] miserable no there was a parting of ways
[41:03] there was a definite clear-cut divorce
[41:05] there's a break there's a clear we're
[41:07] not talking no more we're not friends no
[41:09] more we're not even associates no more
[41:12] we're certainly not work colleagues no
[41:13] more we are not on speaking terms the
[41:16] only speaking terms well when the devil
[41:18] comes our way you say but my lord has
[41:20] washed me he has loosed me from your
[41:22] grip you have no part of me i have no
[41:24] part in you because of what he has done
[41:27] not what i have done that's what he has
[41:29] done what the lord has done that counts
[41:30] amen so he has nothing in me i trust
[41:33] this should be you should be able to
[41:34] repeat this he has nothing in me
[41:36] he has no claim on me
[41:39] and he has no power over me
[41:41] at all
[41:42] hallelujah
[41:44] amen so he's got nothing in me and and
[41:46] this is what the lord has really done in
[41:48] our day by taking the book in
[41:50] revelations four and five where where
[41:52] where brother graham said it was the
[41:54] most sublime act in scripture i mean the
[41:57] the most sublime act in scripture was
[41:59] where where john would be looking and he
[42:01] was lifted up into the throne room of
[42:03] god and he saw there was a cry that went
[42:05] forth a mighty angel a strong angel
[42:07] proclaimed who's worthy
[42:09] amen let him come and take the book and
[42:11] brother brahm standing behind the pulpit
[42:12] and the breaches maybe i just feel this
[42:14] way but let him come
[42:16] hallelujah event was taking place in my
[42:18] opinion i mean the lamb was stepping
[42:20] forth from eternity to loose the seals
[42:22] off the book aiming to show you who you
[42:24] are
[42:25] hallelujah so so it's the most sublime
[42:28] act because because john he said he went
[42:30] much not because he wasn't found worthy
[42:33] or you know there are a lot of what we
[42:35] would call worthy people but none were
[42:37] found worthy because we're all born in
[42:38] sin
[42:40] we're all born lost even the most mighty
[42:42] prophets that have ever been even if you
[42:44] take you know joseph
[42:46] uh his life there's only one mark in the
[42:48] whole scripture against joseph
[42:50] one thing of his entire life all the
[42:53] even in all the pressure he was under
[42:55] the hardship the rejection everything
[42:57] one thing was held against him and that
[42:59] was when his father jacob was was was
[43:02] coming down into egypt and you know the
[43:03] egyptians counted our shepherds
[43:06] abominations so so he tried to get jacob
[43:09] to tell a lie don't say you're a
[43:11] shepherd that was the one mark held
[43:12] against him
[43:14] of his entire life one thing was held
[43:16] against him
[43:17] so he could have been the most nearly
[43:19] worthy person
[43:21] but there's one mark held against him
[43:22] and of course he was born in sin anyway
[43:25] but so there was no man sure the angels
[43:27] would have been worthy but it wasn't an
[43:28] angel that caused the fall or allowed
[43:30] the fall to come and it was man that
[43:32] brought the fall into being right
[43:34] allowed satan to to take control of the
[43:36] human race and take control of nature
[43:38] and know that's why we have suffering
[43:40] today that's why we have sickness that's
[43:42] why innocent people get sick and
[43:44] terrible tragedies happen is because the
[43:46] devil's in charge of this world but
[43:48] there's coming a day where he is being
[43:50] dethroned
[43:51] amen well it will not be him in charge
[43:54] no more he'll not bring sickness no more
[43:56] he won't bring death no more there won't
[43:58] be any storms or typhoons or hurricanes
[44:00] no more i'm able to be peace forevermore
[44:03] because the prince of peace will take
[44:04] his rightful place on the throne but
[44:07] before that happens he's got to call the
[44:09] people to his side he's got to call a
[44:11] bride and that's what he's been doing
[44:12] through seven church ages and i trust
[44:14] you can see yourself in the story i mean
[44:16] because it's the greatest story the
[44:18] greatest love story the greatest story
[44:20] that's ever been told and ever been
[44:22] lived amen is the one you're living out
[44:24] right now
[44:25] hallelujah so
[44:27] no no angel was um you know no angel
[44:30] could come into it even though they had
[44:31] never sinned like michael or or gabriel
[44:34] one of the great angels because angels
[44:36] never caused the fall it was man that's
[44:38] why jesus was called the second adam
[44:40] because he came to redeem back
[44:42] everything adam lost everything adam
[44:44] forfeited his god over the earth jesus
[44:46] came to redeem back and that's why our
[44:48] lord jesus had control over nature amen
[44:51] ten thousand devils got into the sea of
[44:53] galilee when he was tired after a busy
[44:55] series of meetings he's fallen asleep on
[44:57] the boat ten thousand demons said that
[44:59] we've got him now
[45:01] we're gonna drown him and they thought
[45:02] they were in control of that sea because
[45:04] no doubt they whipped up those waves
[45:05] quite a lot
[45:06] and the and the disciples have battled
[45:08] those waves quite a lot you know there's
[45:10] been a lot of storms in life
[45:12] and and sometimes we can kind of manage
[45:14] them
[45:15] because they would have managed that
[45:16] storm before on that boat but when they
[45:18] came to the end of their human ability
[45:20] the next course of action was they're
[45:22] gonna they're gonna be drowned but they
[45:24] had someone different in the boat that
[45:25] they had never had before maybe and that
[45:28] was the actual true master of the waves
[45:30] that was the true master of the wind and
[45:32] they woke him up said master don't you
[45:34] care we're going to die we're going to
[45:35] drown and he just said peace be still
[45:38] because the devil thought he had
[45:39] ownership over nature but actually god
[45:42] showed no i made these i made these
[45:44] atoms i made this weather i made the sea
[45:46] i'm in control amen it's the same thing
[45:48] when storms whip up in our life we can
[45:50] wake jesus up
[45:52] he's in the boat hey man he's in the
[45:53] boat i trust he's in your boat i mean
[45:55] you're having fellowship all the time
[45:58] you're a fellowship junkie hallelujah
[45:59] you and the lord jesus all the time amen
[46:02] but you've got to wake him up
[46:04] i mean don't try and rely on your own
[46:05] human ability to solve the calm the
[46:07] storm wake up the one who has mastery
[46:09] over everything
[46:10] amen he would go to lazarus's tomb four
[46:13] days in the grave that man was writing
[46:15] corruption had said in i mean but
[46:16] corruption knew its master the prophet
[46:18] said amen and and brother abraham said
[46:21] that if if jesus did not call lazarus by
[46:23] name there would have been a general
[46:25] resurrection because he said i am the
[46:27] resurrection and the life not a
[46:29] resurrection the resurrection
[46:31] hallelujah amen he went to the fig tree
[46:33] there were no figs he wanted figs his
[46:35] desire was for figs there was no fig so
[46:36] it cursed the tree to show he had he had
[46:39] dominion over nature
[46:41] amen the same one was in joshua when
[46:43] joshua said son stand still moon stand
[46:45] still amen could control things how did
[46:47] that work i don't know but god ordained
[46:49] it it was because joshua's desire and
[46:52] god's desire matched up
[46:54] i mean because the prophecy was you're
[46:56] going to take the land
[46:57] amen so so his desire and god's eye
[46:59] messed up that's why joshua could stand
[47:01] and say sun stand still moon stand still
[47:03] i mean we've got to destroy our enemies
[47:05] we can't let them have time to regroup i
[47:08] mean to win your desire and god's desire
[47:11] match up i believe god's got to do
[47:13] something about that
[47:14] hallelujah the anointing hap strikes
[47:17] amen and and it's more than just human
[47:19] you know no doubt maybe a lot of people
[47:20] would say wouldn't it be cool if i could
[47:22] stop the sun and the moon wouldn't that
[47:24] you know you think yeah people think
[47:25] wouldn't be cool if we could fly who
[47:27] thought that when they were a child
[47:29] i want to fly
[47:31] you know so
[47:32] you could say it
[47:34] but if the desire matches up with gods
[47:36] and it's his season for it to happen
[47:38] it'll happen
[47:40] that's just i'm just maybe too simple
[47:42] but that's why i feel you know because
[47:44] remember we're walking we're walking
[47:46] into a full uh a full inheritance
[47:49] amen and the first part of this we must
[47:51] realize is the devil has nothing in me
[47:54] the devil has nothing in us amen he has
[47:57] no claim on you in any part of you
[48:00] remember the greatest battle may be ever
[48:03] fought in the mind
[48:05] but the mind is really god's mind
[48:08] right
[48:10] this is called no man's land well you
[48:11] know they say there's no man's land but
[48:13] really it's it's this is god god made
[48:15] the mind
[48:16] god made the body god made the soul
[48:19] it's not that the devil says no i made
[48:21] their spirit no no no no god made it
[48:24] amen so god yo i mean the devil has no
[48:26] part in our thought life
[48:29] amen the devil has no part in our bodies
[48:33] you know i love it where brother brown
[48:35] would pray
[48:36] and um you know he would he would he
[48:38] would pray this someone came up with
[48:39] sickness and the doctors couldn't find
[48:41] what was wrong it came out in
[48:43] discernment but the prophet said you
[48:44] know satan you may be able to hide from
[48:46] the doctors but you can't hide from god
[48:49] and that's like anything there's trouble
[48:51] you know maybe you can't diagnose it you
[48:52] can't put your finger on where the
[48:54] trouble is but but that thing can't hide
[48:56] from god
[48:57] that's why you call a prayer meeting
[48:59] seek the lord about it and he'll he'll
[49:01] he'll give you the diagnosis probably it
[49:03] boils down to this is the enemy doing
[49:05] this why should i put up with him coming
[49:07] on my land
[49:09] amen so he has no claim on us now this
[49:12] is what the power of the blood does
[49:14] where where um the apostle john would
[49:17] would be writing in revelations 1
[49:20] and he would say in verse 5 he'd say and
[49:23] from jesus christ who is the faithful
[49:25] witness and the first begotten of the
[49:27] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[49:29] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[49:31] us from our sins in his own blood so
[49:34] that word washed as means it's it's a
[49:37] separation
[49:38] it's like you take something that's
[49:40] dirty and you put it in the washing
[49:42] machine and when you get it out of the
[49:43] washing machine it's been loose from its
[49:46] dirt
[49:47] it's been washed so so so the garment
[49:49] and the dirt have been separated
[49:52] hallelujah now if time would go on those
[49:55] same molecules of dirt could actually
[49:57] come back to the shirt again you know
[49:59] they say well
[50:01] this isn't this is the one thing i
[50:03] remember from university it's um it
[50:05] would say i think it's in a physics
[50:07] textbook
[50:08] they'd say that the last breath that
[50:10] julius caesar ever breathed has gone
[50:12] around the world
[50:13] right just by how molecules move
[50:16] apparently
[50:18] i don't know how you kind of work that
[50:19] out but there's there's a theory
[50:21] interesting theory didn't help me an
[50:23] exam was never asked on it but anyway i
[50:24] remember that
[50:26] so
[50:27] you could say if time would go on enough
[50:30] and that julius caesar was still alive
[50:32] the same molecules of air that he
[50:34] breathed out could all eventually come
[50:36] into him if time would go on as i say if
[50:38] the dirt that was on your shirt was
[50:40] loose in the washing machine if time
[50:42] would go on perhaps that dirt would come
[50:43] back to you again
[50:45] but that's not the same thing with the
[50:46] blood of jesus christ i mean what
[50:48] doesn't just it doesn't just separate it
[50:50] from you it actually annihilates it
[50:53] amen but i'll say that annihilation is
[50:55] actually pending
[50:57] because it's now on the head of the
[50:58] accuser
[51:00] i mean remember because he will stand in
[51:02] judgment one day and he will give an
[51:04] account
[51:05] for every murder for all unbelief hatred
[51:08] malice strife
[51:10] shady deal crooked white lie black lie
[51:13] whatever you are call all murder all
[51:16] hatred deceit war he will give a count
[51:18] every broken home broken life whatever
[51:21] it is he will give an account because it
[51:23] will all come eventually down onto him
[51:26] it will boil down to him just like in
[51:28] the garden there was adam and eve and
[51:30] the serpent well where did it go it went
[51:32] from adam goddess adam the woman you
[51:35] gave me basically god this is your fault
[51:36] this is how
[51:37] fallen man works he blames god
[51:40] god you gave me this woman this is the
[51:42] problem you gave me it too it's your
[51:43] fault god
[51:45] that's what he said
[51:46] but then but but then it moved on
[51:48] because god's not separate he's not
[51:50] satisfied with a with an excuse
[51:52] he's looking for the truth right
[51:54] because it's his children he wants to
[51:57] free them from the sin
[51:58] i mean we may have a lot of excuses but
[52:00] he wants to free us
[52:02] amen so then then now it goes to evens
[52:04] and and eve says well the serpent
[52:06] beguiled me and then the serpent's being
[52:08] questioned by god and he's got no one
[52:09] else to pass the buck to
[52:11] and it'll be the same thing in the great
[52:12] white throne judgment satan will be
[52:14] there and he and he can't pass the buck
[52:16] to anyone else he'll add the carrot and
[52:19] then he will take it
[52:21] into destruction
[52:23] amen but the sins that we confess under
[52:26] the blood of jesus christ
[52:27] if time would go on for eternity
[52:30] if that makes sense it can never come
[52:32] back to us
[52:33] like dirt from a shirt so we're far more
[52:36] loosed than than than dirt from a
[52:38] garment
[52:39] right so it it is completely free from
[52:41] us and it can never return
[52:43] i mean that's why you say well i don't
[52:45] know how to pray it doesn't matter how
[52:47] you pray it's the it's a intent of the
[52:49] heart
[52:51] amen so you know some people can say the
[52:53] greatest flowery prayers god doesn't
[52:55] hear it but god hears a simple humble
[52:57] cry
[52:58] a simple humble cry is what god hears
[53:00] when you really mean business with god
[53:02] god sees the heart he may he doesn't
[53:04] usually see the outward emotion of it
[53:06] but he sees the heart of it
[53:08] amen and then so now it's a it just
[53:10] takes a simple humble cry to god forgive
[53:13] me lord i've done wrong i've done this
[53:15] and then what happens is
[53:17] that is now that's confessing to the
[53:18] blood of jesus christ and is now taken
[53:20] from you you are loose from your sins
[53:23] you know it's amazing how the bible is
[53:25] saying first john that the son of god or
[53:27] daughter of god cannot commit sin
[53:29] cannot practice sin because the seed of
[53:31] god is in them
[53:33] amen but now
[53:34] so now
[53:36] we can we can actually look into the
[53:37] face of the devil
[53:39] and we can tell him that he has no part
[53:41] in us
[53:42] because all of the sins that he actually
[53:44] caused in our life have been taken from
[53:47] us
[53:48] amen from from the deeds of this guy
[53:50] here
[53:52] amen they are not attributed to me
[53:55] anymore they're under the blood of jesus
[53:57] christ so now he does not have claim on
[54:00] a people who are under the blood
[54:02] he has no claim
[54:03] right he has nothing to put his crooked
[54:05] fingers on to say no no they they
[54:08] actually belong to me because they're
[54:10] under still the spirit of unbelief
[54:12] remember all sin is an attribute of
[54:14] unbelief
[54:15] amen so he has no claim if you're really
[54:17] under the blood of jesus christ or how
[54:19] do i know that you've really received
[54:20] the holy ghost you become a new creature
[54:22] in christ
[54:24] you may make many mistakes and trip up
[54:26] along the way but it's not him that
[54:27] falls at him that gets back up
[54:30] hallelujah
[54:31] amen so he has no claim on us in that
[54:33] way but then now it's not just that
[54:36] claim because the devil's crafting
[54:38] it's not just sin
[54:40] that he tried to get the people under
[54:42] and he accomplished it but the blood of
[54:43] jesus christ loses us but it's also
[54:45] anything man i say the devil has
[54:48] injected himself into religion
[54:51] and so now he keeps the people in
[54:53] bondage
[54:54] by creeds and dogmas of men
[54:56] like jesus would say that by teaching
[54:59] the commandments and doctrines of men
[55:01] they make the word of god no effect to
[55:03] the people now if you think about that
[55:05] single statement he said he said
[55:07] basically the scribes and pharisees have
[55:10] made the word of god no effect
[55:12] by teaching creeds and dogmas so now the
[55:14] people were under a slavery where the
[55:17] devil would say no no they believe what
[55:18] i've taught them
[55:20] so now i've got a claim on them
[55:23] but now that's why the lord jesus came
[55:25] as he wanted to strike off every claim
[55:28] because our god is a thorough lawyer
[55:31] he's thorough in his job he's not
[55:32] haphazard he's not blase
[55:35] he you know because he knows the devil
[55:37] because he made the devil he understands
[55:39] how the devil works he knows the devil
[55:40] can if he can get just a
[55:42] a fingernail hold on something he'll
[55:45] hold on to it with all that's within him
[55:47] right so our god makes us in such a way
[55:49] by his blood that the devil has no claim
[55:51] on any of us
[55:53] hallelujah so now now jesus would would
[55:56] would instruct the disciples after his
[55:58] resurrection to carry in jerusalem till
[56:00] they receive power from on high
[56:02] now what was going to happen is as
[56:04] brother man would say that they were
[56:06] about to receive an abstract title deed
[56:09] that all of their sin was struck off
[56:12] there was nothing held against them
[56:14] it was all gone amen and that was in the
[56:17] form of receiving the holy ghost because
[56:18] remember if you've truly been born again
[56:21] really received the holy ghost all of
[56:23] your past present and future sins have
[56:25] been taken care of
[56:27] amen by one offering he's perfected
[56:29] forever them that are sanctified amen we
[56:31] may fall into sin
[56:33] but that doesn't mean we're not lost
[56:35] the bible says if we confess our sins
[56:37] he's faithful and just to forgive us
[56:40] amen so so if you've really received the
[56:42] holy ghost all of your sin has been
[56:44] struck off it's not on your account
[56:47] hallelujah
[56:48] amen that's why we shouldn't be afraid
[56:50] we should just walk on with god
[56:53] because that's what an abstract on
[56:55] abstract
[56:56] um title details so a title d to say
[56:58] just have i bought this building not
[57:00] putting any ideas into anyone's minds
[57:02] right now but you know then then we'd
[57:04] have to make sure and in order for the
[57:06] sale to go through that there were no
[57:08] claims on it
[57:10] and if there were those claims would had
[57:11] to be
[57:12] sorted and then we could buy the
[57:14] building
[57:15] so that's what the lord did
[57:17] when he died that day on calvary as he
[57:19] was actually striking all the claims
[57:22] of the bride of christ
[57:24] not just 120 in the upper room but all
[57:26] the believers down through the ages by
[57:28] that one offering he did the whole thing
[57:29] and that's why the word becomes alive to
[57:32] you is because he did it for you
[57:34] hallelujah and then said now so so he
[57:37] struck all everything that was held
[57:39] against him peter james and john the
[57:41] woman at the well legion whoever it was
[57:43] all of their deeds were struck off by
[57:45] the blood of jesus christ and they
[57:47] received the holy ghost which was an
[57:50] abstract title deed which means the
[57:52] devil now had no claim on them
[57:54] whatsoever
[57:56] hallelujah
[57:58] but then now we've had seven church ages
[58:00] and the first church age started uh you
[58:03] know it was it was a couple of decades
[58:05] after the day of pentecost
[58:07] and by that time the church has already
[58:09] fallen the devil had started to make
[58:11] claims
[58:12] and because i would say in the ephesian
[58:14] age it says you know remember without
[58:17] your doubt fallen you know repent and do
[58:19] the first works
[58:20] go back
[58:21] right so they'd already begin to fall
[58:23] now the blood still covers the people
[58:26] but that was showing now there had to
[58:28] come a time where god would do the
[58:30] second act of redemption
[58:32] to actually strike off from all of the
[58:35] new testament saints what the devil had
[58:37] put upon them
[58:39] you take luther for example when the
[58:40] reformation started he was he was
[58:43] smoking a pipe you know he was a
[58:45] trinitarian he was drinking but yet god
[58:48] used him to to to illuminate an age that
[58:50] just shall live by faith the people were
[58:52] in darkness but now light was being
[58:54] restored so now that was that was you
[58:57] could say tag satan you could say but he
[58:58] he was believing my doctrine
[59:01] and then you know there was a
[59:02] restoration going on but then finally
[59:04] now we've come to the end and that's why
[59:06] john went much because someone's got to
[59:08] take the book
[59:10] someone's got to claim it for their own
[59:11] amen to actually finish the work of
[59:13] redemption because redemption is two
[59:15] parts right it's the purchase then
[59:17] there's the claim then there's i mean
[59:19] there's a purchase and there's actually
[59:20] the gathering of what you've purchased
[59:22] right just like boaz boaz purchased the
[59:25] redemption of naomi and ruth at the gate
[59:28] of the city but then he had to go marry
[59:30] ruth
[59:31] right that's redemption all in that
[59:33] it's a book of redemption the book of
[59:35] ruth
[59:36] i mean so so he couldn't just he
[59:38] couldn't just say now i've redeemed
[59:39] naomi to get ruth and i'm going to marry
[59:41] her and not marry her no he had to
[59:43] become one with her actually marry her
[59:45] right you're following me and then so
[59:46] the lord jesus purchased our salvation
[59:48] on calvary that was the purchasing but
[59:50] then he had to come for the claiming
[59:52] work
[59:53] i mean the claiming work and that's why
[59:55] to me brother graham said that the
[59:56] taking of the book is the most sublime
[59:58] act in scripture because that's why john
[1:00:00] wept does that where is the kinsman
[1:00:02] redeemer that can claim us
[1:00:05] hallelujah because he knew if that book
[1:00:06] wasn't taken we're all in jeopardy
[1:00:09] but it's amazing because you know he was
[1:00:11] the beloved disciple he would lean on
[1:00:13] jesus bosom he was in the inner circle
[1:00:16] but yet when he was standing in eternity
[1:00:18] maybe he just couldn't see him there
[1:00:20] where is that lamb where's the one who's
[1:00:22] worthy that's why he went much and
[1:00:23] that's why the elder said don't weep
[1:00:25] john
[1:00:26] the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:00:27] prevailed i remember when john looked he
[1:00:30] didn't see a lion coming to bring
[1:00:32] judgment but he saw a lamb
[1:00:34] he saw his lamb amen i trust when you
[1:00:36] see the lord jesus you see your lamb you
[1:00:39] see your perfect sacrifice you see the
[1:00:40] one who died for you you see the one who
[1:00:42] is who shed his blood to wash all your
[1:00:44] sins away
[1:00:46] hallelujah i trust that's what you see i
[1:00:48] don't see a god that's angry with me
[1:00:51] i see a god that loves me and gave
[1:00:53] herself
[1:00:54] for me or to me amen he gave he is my
[1:00:57] ransom
[1:00:59] hallelujah
[1:01:00] amen so he went much and he because
[1:01:03] there was no one found worthy but then
[1:01:04] the lord jesus stepped forth
[1:01:06] bloody wounded he prevailed through the
[1:01:09] line of the tribe of judah has prevailed
[1:01:11] hallelujah and then when he stepped
[1:01:13] forth and he took that book
[1:01:15] now we are represented in that book yes
[1:01:19] amen just like as i said brother brown
[1:01:20] would say in the breach that that that
[1:01:22] ruth is a symbol of the book of
[1:01:24] redemption and boaz is our christ
[1:01:27] i mean so so he said that
[1:01:29] the lamb taking the book is is the same
[1:01:32] as ruth being married to boaz
[1:01:35] amen so now so what's been happening is
[1:01:38] there's been there's been a intercessory
[1:01:40] work going on and it's still going on it
[1:01:43] hasn't stopped i still need it i still
[1:01:45] need an intercessor i need someone to
[1:01:48] stand between me and god interceding on
[1:01:50] my behalf i still need the blood
[1:01:53] some people think they don't need blood
[1:01:54] no more no i need the blood of the lamb
[1:01:56] i need him every day and i'm going to
[1:01:58] need him every day till i leave this
[1:02:00] earth
[1:02:01] holy i'm so glad he's still there
[1:02:02] tonight amen redemption and mercy is
[1:02:05] still there tonight
[1:02:06] hello for whosoever will
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:10] hallelujah
[1:02:11] amen so now he took that book
[1:02:14] which represents claiming
[1:02:17] you
[1:02:18] you got to make it personal so now when
[1:02:20] the lamb
[1:02:22] now we know the one who's
[1:02:23] we know it's a great jama we know
[1:02:25] there's not two gods there's one there's
[1:02:28] not three there's one
[1:02:30] right but when adam adam if i can use
[1:02:32] this as a symbol
[1:02:34] adam actually had the title d to the
[1:02:36] earth before the fall
[1:02:38] but when he fell it couldn't go into the
[1:02:40] slippery hands of the accuser so went
[1:02:42] back to the original creator and it
[1:02:44] waited there for another man to come who
[1:02:46] was actually worthy to claim it back
[1:02:49] amen that's why my lord jesus is my
[1:02:51] champion when i could not save myself he
[1:02:54] saved me when i could not redeem myself
[1:02:56] he redeemed me when i could not do
[1:02:57] anything on my own behalf he stepped
[1:02:59] forth howard says they're mine he's mine
[1:03:02] she's mine amen she has no pardon the
[1:03:04] devil amen the devil has no pardon her
[1:03:07] hallelujah
[1:03:08] amen so so then jesus stepped forth with
[1:03:11] his own blood
[1:03:13] and now took it into his possession
[1:03:15] hallelujah so so how does that really
[1:03:17] work out in this age
[1:03:19] he came looking for you
[1:03:21] he's picked you up
[1:03:22] he's carrying you home
[1:03:24] hallelujah he you are now his possession
[1:03:28] you are his purchased possession i'm
[1:03:30] glad i'm his aren't you glad you're his
[1:03:33] hallelujah and he's not going to let you
[1:03:35] go
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:38] hallelujah
[1:03:40] amen so this great act is going on right
[1:03:43] now
[1:03:44] amen because there's still some people
[1:03:47] upon the earth that have to be redeemed
[1:03:50] that's why the dead in christ haven't
[1:03:52] risen yet
[1:03:53] amen but hey the last one could be real
[1:03:55] close to us
[1:03:57] amen i'll say come home
[1:04:00] it's wonderful the water's fine
[1:04:03] hallelujah
[1:04:04] amen so so he would say that the that
[1:04:07] the prince of this world has nothing in
[1:04:09] me
[1:04:10] and this is what's happened at the end
[1:04:12] of the ages that god has done another
[1:04:14] abstract title deed search
[1:04:16] amen this is why the lamb could take the
[1:04:18] book
[1:04:19] because he would come in the seventh
[1:04:21] church age and strike off all the false
[1:04:23] doctrine of the church
[1:04:25] because we have been restored back to
[1:04:26] the faith of the fathers they had no
[1:04:28] false doctrine in them they weren't
[1:04:29] trinitarian they didn't have god cut up
[1:04:31] into many pieces they didn't baptize
[1:04:33] wrong they didn't have their church the
[1:04:35] wrong way they didn't have they they
[1:04:37] weren't some cold formal group they just
[1:04:39] went through a cycle of a religious
[1:04:40] motion no they had reality they had god
[1:04:43] in their midst amen they knew that
[1:04:45] jehovah the old testament was jesus of
[1:04:46] the new they knew that the very creator
[1:04:48] god himself was the holy ghost that
[1:04:50] dwell within them hallelujah amen they
[1:04:53] knew the promises of the bible were in
[1:04:54] fulfillment in their life
[1:04:56] amen that they could go rejoicing and we
[1:04:58] have been restored back
[1:05:00] amen to this very thing
[1:05:03] amen as brother brown would say i
[1:05:05] believe it's in birth pains now we know
[1:05:08] the scripture says malachi 4 that that
[1:05:10] the ministry of malachi 4 would turn the
[1:05:12] hearts of the children back to the
[1:05:13] fathers now that is not a uniting of
[1:05:16] natural fathers and natural children
[1:05:18] it is the hearts of the children which
[1:05:21] are us will be turned back to the faith
[1:05:23] of the fathers that's why we could sing
[1:05:25] that hymn faith of the father's living
[1:05:26] still
[1:05:28] amen so now if the hearts of the fathers
[1:05:31] i mean children return back to the
[1:05:32] hearts of the fathers then the same
[1:05:34] birth the fathers received we would
[1:05:36] receive
[1:05:37] amen that it would not be just a mental
[1:05:40] agreement saying jesus died on the cross
[1:05:42] for me it would not be putting your name
[1:05:44] on a church book it would not be just
[1:05:46] getting baptized and that's it and no
[1:05:48] change of life but the same holy ghost
[1:05:50] that fell in the book of acts amen would
[1:05:52] fall upon you and i transform our lives
[1:05:55] change our thinking change our actions
[1:05:56] change our nature i mean where he would
[1:05:59] become a god of reality whereas bible
[1:06:01] would be true in our lives i mean that
[1:06:03] every scripture would be real to us
[1:06:05] hallelujah
[1:06:07] now what i love about this i may be
[1:06:09] jumping ahead of myself a bit but you
[1:06:11] know
[1:06:12] if if well wait i'll just read this
[1:06:14] quote i said i would now if we could he
[1:06:16] says here now her messenger is promised
[1:06:19] the seventh church h1 in malachi the
[1:06:21] fourth chapter he's promised to do it
[1:06:23] and the message is to bring back the
[1:06:25] word bring the people back to the word
[1:06:27] birth is to be she's been delivered of a
[1:06:30] new birth from according to malachi 4.
[1:06:33] that's why brother ram would stand in
[1:06:35] 1965 and say that screaming hollering
[1:06:38] acts 238 youngins are the only kind the
[1:06:40] word can produce that's the only kind it
[1:06:43] can produce it's not a cold mental
[1:06:45] assist not a dry eyed confession but a
[1:06:47] real birth a real dying out a real
[1:06:49] change of nature and it's god that does
[1:06:51] it we're not reforming ourselves i mean
[1:06:54] who's with me tonight this is not a
[1:06:55] reformation this is a transformation i
[1:06:57] mean god can change your thinking maybe
[1:06:59] your thinking is always negative and
[1:07:01] down and there's nothing to this and
[1:07:02] i'll never become anything in life and
[1:07:04] what's the point of trying and god can
[1:07:06] change your thinking to say i've got a
[1:07:08] purpose in the world i'm here for a
[1:07:09] reason i'm not here just to fill up time
[1:07:12] and waste time and occupy time but i'm
[1:07:14] here to manifest the word of god that

[1:08:13] called us to fulfill a specific portion
[1:08:16] of scripture in this day
[1:08:19] amen that may be a bit generic but i'd
[1:08:21] say it's not generic because the word
[1:08:24] this
[1:08:25] must be transferred
[1:08:26] from
[1:08:27] no more ink on paper but now it's flesh
[1:08:31] amen that when you read through the
[1:08:33] scripture

[1:09:14] titus two and one
[1:09:17] but speak now now here's a challenge now
[1:09:19] i'm challenging myself too see if we're
[1:09:21] a living bible
[1:09:23] what we are reading
[1:09:25] we should actually be able to look in
[1:09:27] our lives and say
[1:09:28] i'm living that
[1:09:30] and maybe no one's told you it
[1:09:32] but if the same spirit that wrote the
[1:09:34] bibles in you you will live out the
[1:09:36] bible
[1:09:37] without even realizing it says now but
[1:09:39] speak the other things which become
[1:09:41] sound doctrine
[1:09:42] that the age men be sober grave
[1:09:44] temperate sound and faith and charity
[1:09:46] and patience the aged woman likewise
[1:09:50] that they be in behavior as becometh
[1:09:52] holiness not false accusers not given to
[1:09:54] much wine teachers of good things that
[1:09:57] they may teach the young woman to be
[1:09:58] sober to love their husbands to love
[1:10:00] their children to be discreet chaste
[1:10:02] keepers at home good obedient to their
[1:10:04] own husbands that the word of god be not
[1:10:06] blasphemed young men likewise exhort to
[1:10:08] be sober-minded in all things showing
[1:10:10] thyself a pattern of good works and
[1:10:12] doctrine showing uncorruptness gravity
[1:10:15] sincerity sound speech that cannot be
[1:10:17] condemned that he that is of country
[1:10:19] part may be ashamed having no evil thing
[1:10:21] to say of you
[1:10:23] exhort servants to be obedient unto
[1:10:24] their masters
[1:10:26] and to please them well in all things
[1:10:28] not answering again not prolonging but
[1:10:30] showing all good fidelity that they may
[1:10:33] adorn the doctrine of god our savior in
[1:10:35] all things for the grace of god that
[1:10:37] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[1:10:39] men
[1:10:40] teaching us that uh denying ungodliness
[1:10:43] and worldly lust we should live soberly
[1:10:45] righteously and godly in the present
[1:10:48] world looking for that blessed hope and
[1:10:50] the glorious appearing of the great god
[1:10:52] and our savior jesus christ who gave
[1:10:54] himself for us that he might redeem us
[1:10:56] from all iniquity and purify unto
[1:10:59] himself a peculiar people now that word
[1:11:01] peculiar doesn't mean strange
[1:11:03] that means a precious treasure
[1:11:06] zealous of good works these things speak
[1:11:08] and exhort and rebuke with all authority
[1:11:10] let no man despise thee
[1:11:12] now i think that covers from the old to
[1:11:14] the young
[1:11:16] so
[1:11:17] i trust when you read that and you found
[1:11:18] your portion
[1:11:20] you could say i trust sincerely it say
[1:11:22] actually i'm living that
[1:11:24] because you're a living bible
[1:11:26] amen
[1:11:28] and that was not old-fashioned the
[1:11:30] scripture is for all all generations
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:36] so now
[1:11:38] the lord jesus in this end time did an
[1:11:40] abstract title deed search
[1:11:43] and that's why the seven church ages and
[1:11:44] the seals were preached because in the
[1:11:46] seals brother braham says we're just
[1:11:47] stripping down the devil exposing him on
[1:11:49] every hand and he would go down through
[1:11:51] the seven church ages and he'd say
[1:11:53] taking the the where god praises the age
[1:11:56] and the complaints against the age and
[1:11:57] the history that happened in the age to
[1:11:59] expose the devils working down through
[1:12:00] the church ages what was going on the
[1:12:02] lamb was standing exposing the works of
[1:12:05] the devil to show actually no no this is
[1:12:08] where the devil can have claims on
[1:12:09] people
[1:12:10] but this is but i'm going to strike them
[1:12:12] off this end time bride because when
[1:12:14] this end time bride comes to perfection
[1:12:17] then the resurrection of the dead in
[1:12:19] christ will come forth
[1:12:21] because they without us cannot be made
[1:12:23] perfect or complete
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:27] amen so it's incredible our that we're
[1:12:30] living in
[1:12:32] hallelujah now
[1:12:34] i'm gonna
[1:12:35] i'm gonna run through this real quick
[1:12:36] because i know time's gone
[1:12:38] but
[1:12:40] every promise has been opened to us in
[1:12:41] the
[1:12:42] in the word
[1:12:44] now i'll say this if one promise has
[1:12:46] been opened to you then every promise is
[1:12:48] yours
[1:12:49] right every promise of one promise has
[1:12:51] been opened every promise is yours you
[1:12:53] know it must have been an incredible
[1:12:56] thing if we could go into the minds of
[1:12:58] the israelites as they were walking
[1:13:00] around jericho
[1:13:01] they weren't wondering if the walls
[1:13:03] would fall they knew they were going to
[1:13:04] fall
[1:13:05] now they had
[1:13:08] they were living out the fulfillment of
[1:13:10] the prophet moses ministry
[1:13:13] because his whole ministry was that the
[1:13:14] people would go into the land he
[1:13:16] couldn't do it himself because of what
[1:13:18] he did in the wilderness smiting the
[1:13:20] rock and those things but his whole
[1:13:22] ministry was that they would leave egypt
[1:13:24] and go into the promised land
[1:13:26] and joshua was told
[1:13:28] in joshua chapter one
[1:13:30] that he was instructed to be strong and
[1:13:33] of good courage
[1:13:34] i mean to be strong and very courageous
[1:13:37] amen that thou mayest observed to do
[1:13:39] according to all the law which moses my
[1:13:41] servant commandee turn off from the
[1:13:42] right hand or to the left hand that thou
[1:13:44] mayest prosper wheresoever thou goest
[1:13:47] so
[1:13:48] joshua was instructed now wherever you
[1:13:50] go
[1:13:51] every place of the soul of your foot
[1:13:52] shall tread upon this is verse 3 of
[1:13:54] joshua 1
[1:13:55] um that have i given unto you as i said
[1:13:58] unto moses so now joshua's told wherever
[1:14:01] you go you're going to get it
[1:14:03] you'll that's your possession
[1:14:05] right so now they were living out the
[1:14:07] ministry of moses
[1:14:09] and now they were living out the
[1:14:11] fulfillment of that ministry
[1:14:13] mean so now
[1:14:14] supernaturally they crossed the river
[1:14:16] jordan
[1:14:17] they didn't build a bridge they didn't
[1:14:18] build boats they didn't build a pontoon
[1:14:20] system they didn't have whatever
[1:14:23] they supernaturally in spring season
[1:14:25] when the river was flooding they crossed
[1:14:28] the jordan
[1:14:29] and they did it by the priest carrying
[1:14:30] the word carrying the ark and they
[1:14:32] stepped into the jordan created an
[1:14:33] entrance
[1:14:34] and they crossed now their forebears did
[1:14:37] the same thing not with the ark but
[1:14:38] crossing the red sea supernaturally
[1:14:41] so now the promises they would step into
[1:14:43] the land and they'd take it they had
[1:14:44] already stepped into the land you think
[1:14:47] about what now a promise has just been
[1:14:48] fulfilled i was excited in my mind i
[1:14:50] hope this makes sense to you you know
[1:14:52] but so
[1:14:54] one part of the promise has already been
[1:14:55] fulfilled
[1:14:56] you could have gone to the promised land
[1:14:59] they had already begun to live out the
[1:15:01] fulfillment of moses ministry
[1:15:04] they were living it out now right they
[1:15:06] set foot in over jordan they are in the
[1:15:08] land now if that promise was true that
[1:15:11] they could go into the land
[1:15:12] supernaturally therefore every other
[1:15:14] promise everything else in the land was
[1:15:17] theirs
[1:15:19] if one promise is true every promise is
[1:15:21] true
[1:15:23] every promise if one promise is true so
[1:15:26] listen who's been saved yes sir who's
[1:15:29] received the holy ghost
[1:15:31] who's being healed
[1:15:33] who's repented being baptized received
[1:15:35] the holy ghost
[1:15:36] who's that answered prayer
[1:15:38] that's that's a promise answered isn't
[1:15:40] it that's one so if that's been answered
[1:15:42] they'll all be answered
[1:15:44] hallelujah are you with me so now the
[1:15:46] whole so here they are here's israel
[1:15:48] walking around jericho
[1:15:51] hallelujah they're just under
[1:15:52] expectation
[1:15:54] he told us to walk around once for six
[1:15:56] days
[1:15:57] these these are going to fall
[1:16:00] maybe they would talk in camp how do you
[1:16:02] think it's going to happen they didn't
[1:16:03] know but i knew it was going to happen
[1:16:05] then they walked around seven times on
[1:16:06] the seventh day then they blew the
[1:16:08] trumpets let out a shout
[1:16:10] they weren't wondering if it would work
[1:16:13] remember the promise of crossing the
[1:16:15] jordan worked
[1:16:17] amen see the devil challenges our faith
[1:16:19] how do you know you have faith for it
[1:16:21] well i had faith back here
[1:16:23] remember they all had to believe to
[1:16:25] cross the jordan
[1:16:27] the apostle paul said that the other
[1:16:29] generation entered not because of
[1:16:31] unbelief
[1:16:32] so the next generation had to enter in
[1:16:34] because of faith
[1:16:36] hallelujah so now if we have crossed
[1:16:38] jordan
[1:16:39] the whole land is ours
[1:16:41] the same faith if i can put it this way
[1:16:43] the same faith that allowed us to cross
[1:16:45] jordan
[1:16:46] gives every part of the land
[1:16:49] hallelujah if we go up to where manasseh
[1:16:51] lived
[1:16:52] says divine healing it's mine we go here
[1:16:54] my whole family's in it's mine
[1:16:57] redemption of my family here hell peace
[1:16:59] in the home is here walk above this
[1:17:02] world here amen every divine promise
[1:17:06] is open
[1:17:08] hallelujah
[1:17:09] but why is that because the devil has no
[1:17:11] claim on you
[1:17:14] you have no pardon him he has no part in
[1:17:16] you
[1:17:17] as i said you parted ways i trust a long
[1:17:19] time ago if you haven't parted ways just
[1:17:21] repent with all your heart right now and
[1:17:23] you'll part ways
[1:17:24] he won't be your best buddy that just
[1:17:26] ends you up in trouble and runs for it
[1:17:28] when you get in trouble no no he'll be
[1:17:30] your enemy
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:33] so now i'm going to read this
[1:17:37] read these and then
[1:17:40] we're going to go
[1:17:41] enoch was translated this is in god's
[1:17:43] power to transform
[1:17:44] enoch was translated from death by god's
[1:17:48] transforming power
[1:17:49] what did god do that for for a type of
[1:17:52] the rapturing church that's coming sure
[1:17:54] elijah was the same jesus body was
[1:17:56] quickened after was dead and in the
[1:17:58] grave jesus body was quickened by the
[1:17:59] word of god and transformed from a dead
[1:18:02] cold image to a resurrected glorified
[1:18:04] son of god because the prophet psalms
[1:18:08] 16 10 if he put it down 16 10 said i'll
[1:18:11] not leave a soul in hell neither i
[1:18:13] suffer my holy one to see corruption oh
[1:18:15] god that word has to come to pass it's
[1:18:17] god's word planted in your heart if you
[1:18:19] want to go on a rapture if you want to
[1:18:21] be a christian's genuine place this word
[1:18:24] as i believed it was ezekiel god said
[1:18:26] take that scroll and eat it up
[1:18:28] that the prophet and the word would
[1:18:29] become the same and the very promise
[1:18:31] that's in there has to manifest itself
[1:18:34] because it's god's original seed don't
[1:18:36] let some educated theologian out there
[1:18:38] try and pump it out if you don't let
[1:18:40] them spray you with some carnal size of
[1:18:41] knowledge and education but believe god
[1:18:44] i mean so but you've got to realize
[1:18:46] if one promise is true
[1:18:48] all the promises are true because
[1:18:50] remember every promise is an attribute
[1:18:52] of christ and he's not a he's not a
[1:18:56] he's one
[1:18:58] right so healing's a part of him
[1:19:01] salvation's part of him deliverance is
[1:19:03] part of him it's all attributes he's a
[1:19:04] mighty healer he's a mighty redeemer
[1:19:07] he's a god of war remember he's our kins
[1:19:09] and redeemed he's also our kinsmen
[1:19:10] avenger
[1:19:12] right pour out his wrath upon the devil
[1:19:14] is trying to get in and attack our lives
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:19] now
[1:19:23] he says this now
[1:19:25] i'll read this one from perseverance and
[1:19:27] we'll stop samson was met on the field
[1:19:29] one day with a thousand philistines
[1:19:30] around him
[1:19:32] and looked all around he wasn't a
[1:19:33] trained man that knew how to duel but
[1:19:35] when he turned his head he felt that
[1:19:37] covenant then locked strike his
[1:19:39] shoulders that's all he had to feel he
[1:19:41] got the first thing in his hand was a
[1:19:43] jawbone of a mule and beat down a
[1:19:45] thousand philistines why he was
[1:19:47] persistent because he know that god had
[1:19:49] made a covenant with him of those seven
[1:19:51] locks long as they hung in their place
[1:19:53] nothing was going to bother him oh
[1:19:55] brother sister how the church and living
[1:19:56] god understand tonight persistent as
[1:19:59] long as we can feel the covenant of the
[1:20:01] holy spirit the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:03] cleansing us from all sin we should
[1:20:05] never let nothing stand in our way
[1:20:07] persistent certainly
[1:20:10] amen it took a battle to get the
[1:20:11] promised land but every divine the whole
[1:20:13] land opened up to them
[1:20:15] amen and the whole world has been opened
[1:20:17] up in this end time hallelujah there's
[1:20:19] no oh when is it it's going to be no
[1:20:21] it's now
[1:20:22] it's right now every promise is true
[1:20:24] right now every promise is yours right
[1:20:26] now now we are the sons and daughters of
[1:20:28] god not one day right now
[1:20:30] amen we have no part in the devil and he
[1:20:33] has no pardon us no matter what claim he
[1:20:35] tries to put on you point him to point
[1:20:37] him to the blood

[1:20:40] promise

[1:20:48] amen so take that key of faith
[1:20:50] lord jesus you purchased this that day
[1:20:52] on calvary lord jesus you took those

[1:21:09] amen because of that victory you won for
[1:21:11] me that day on calvary you take that key
[1:21:13] of faith in the finished work and it
[1:21:15] will unlock every door every divine

[1:21:44] didn't because it was silence but they
[1:21:45] could have gone around shouting
[1:21:47] jericho's coming down
[1:21:49] if god blew us over jordan he's going to
[1:21:50] give us this victory and if they knew
[1:21:52] about aya they could have been shouting

[1:21:57] stronghold of the enemy is coming down
[1:21:59] they're going to be praising him for it
