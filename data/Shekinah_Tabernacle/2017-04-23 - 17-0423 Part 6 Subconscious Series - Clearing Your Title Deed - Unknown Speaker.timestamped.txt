[56:56] you know know and sometimes there needs
[56:57] to be a clearing yes Hallelujah there

[57:12] hallelujah amen let's um we got it up
[57:15] good sweet let's just while we're

[57:20] scripture oh
[57:23] yeah um this morning I want to speak on
[57:26] which is part six of the subconscious
[57:28] mind series and it's called clearing
[57:31] your title deed hallelujah amen and this
[57:35] one is more preaching than teaching so
[57:38] yeah we'll just we'll just enter in amen
[57:40] we'll enter into the the vision of the
[57:42] word amen hallelujah uh this is a a
[57:45] marvelous subject a wonderful subject
[57:48] and I don't believe that no human can
[57:50] grasp or capture the whole thing but
[57:52] I'll just take a little bit by the grace
[57:54] of God and share that with you
[57:56] Hallelujah that what he's shown me under
[57:59] his anointing and Grace about what he's
[58:02] done and what the abstract is and all
[58:04] these things that brother brandom speaks
[58:06] about and if you've listened to these
[58:08] messages and you might not all capture
[58:10] the whole thing but today let's Shine
[58:13] the diamond a little bit amen hallelujah
[58:16] let's turn in our Bibles and or if you
[58:18] just want to read we're going to we're
[58:20] going to start at Genesis 3 and verse
[58:23] 6-13 and it says and when the woman saw
[58:26] that the tree was good for food and that
[58:29] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[58:32] to be desired to make one wise she took
[58:35] of the fruit thereof and did eat and
[58:38] gave also unto her husband with her and
[58:40] he did
[58:42] eat and the eyes of them both were
[58:44] opened and they knew they were naked and
[58:46] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[58:48] themselves
[58:49] aprons that would never work and they
[58:52] heard the voice of the Lord God walking
[58:55] amen amen they heard the voice amen if
[58:59] we have studied English that doesn't
[59:01] make sense in the
[59:04] English they saw the uh The Voice
[59:07] walking a voice how does a voice walk so
[59:10] it must have been a person amen walking
[59:13] in the garden to come down for
[59:14] Fellowship but they had eaten of another
[59:17] tree Lord God walking in the garden the
[59:19] voice of the Lord God Walking In The
[59:21] Garden in the call of the day and Adam
[59:24] and his wife hid themselves from the
[59:25] Pres presence of the Lord God amongst
[59:28] the Trees of the
[59:30] garden and we'll just go carry on and
[59:33] the Lord God called unto Adam and said
[59:35] unto him where art thou amen see the
[59:40] Lord God is already
[59:42] now calling He's already calling he's
[59:45] already he's he's he's starting this
[59:48] work of redemption already amen asking
[59:50] where are you and then he'll ask who are
[59:53] you who is this person and you'll see
[59:55] later on in the sermon what I'm talking
[59:59] about Where Art Thou he said and he said
[1:00:02] I heard thy voice in the garden and I
[1:00:03] was afraid because I was naked and I hid
[1:00:06] myself and he said who told thee that
[1:00:08] thou was naked hast thou eaten of the
[1:00:10] tree whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:00:12] should us not eat and the man said the
[1:00:14] woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
[1:00:17] gave me of the tree and I did eat and
[1:00:20] the Lord God said unto the woman what is
[1:00:22] this that thou Hast done and the woman
[1:00:24] said the serpent beguiled me and I did
[1:00:28] eat and we skip down to verse 22 and the
[1:00:32] Lord God said behold the man has become
[1:00:35] as one of us to know good and evil and
[1:00:38] now lest he put forth his hand and take
[1:00:41] also of the tree of life and eat and
[1:00:44] live forever therefore the Lord God sent
[1:00:47] sent him forth from the Garden of Eden
[1:00:50] and in another translation it says that
[1:00:52] Adam was kicked out of the Garden of
[1:00:55] Eden he was given the boot basically
[1:00:57] like it wasn't just an easy thing it was
[1:01:00] go so there were and then the Lord says
[1:01:04] and therefore the Lord God sent him
[1:01:05] forth out of the Garden of Eden to till
[1:01:07] the ground from when he was taken
[1:01:09] Hallelujah so he drove out the man and
[1:01:12] he placed at the east of the Garden of
[1:01:13] Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1:01:16] turns every way to keep the way of the
[1:01:19] tree of life so they couldn't enter back
[1:01:21] in there had to be something happened
[1:01:24] for them to enter back in because
[1:01:26] something left Adam's
[1:01:30] hands and where did it go Revelation
[1:01:33] chapter
[1:01:38] 5all and I saw in the right hand of him
[1:01:40] that sat on the throne a
[1:01:42] book written within and on the backside
[1:01:46] sealed was Seven Seals that's where the
[1:01:49] book went that's where the title deed
[1:01:51] went that's where Adam inheritance went
[1:01:53] it couldn't go into the hands of Satan
[1:01:55] had to go back into the hands of the
[1:01:58] almighty God Amen and so that's where
[1:02:01] the title deed has been for a long
[1:02:04] time but as we know and you're very
[1:02:07] familiar Revelation 10:1 and 2 and it
[1:02:10] says and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:02:13] down from heaven aren't you so glad
[1:02:15] Hallelujah that a an angel came down
[1:02:17] from heaven amen a captain came down
[1:02:21] from heaven amen he came down from
[1:02:24] heaven Hallelujah he came to you
[1:02:27] Hallelujah why was he coming to you he
[1:02:30] wants you to eat something hallelujah
[1:02:32] what was driven out for many years they
[1:02:35] were all driven out couldn't come back
[1:02:37] you've been a privileged people that's
[1:02:40] only in this generation that's eating
[1:02:42] this remember that it's a very big
[1:02:47] difference the title deed and clothed
[1:02:50] with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[1:02:52] head and his face was as it were the Sun
[1:02:55] and his feet as pillars of fire and in
[1:02:57] his hand he had a little book open so
[1:03:02] there's a big difference we've read Adam
[1:03:05] walked out kicked out got kicked out and
[1:03:09] God guarded it so he couldn't get back
[1:03:10] in there was no way he could get back
[1:03:11] and eat that tree and then we see where
[1:03:14] the book went and it was closed and now
[1:03:17] we see an event happen a glorious event
[1:03:20] where a little book is open and he set
[1:03:22] his right foot upon the sea and left
[1:03:24] foot on the Earth
[1:03:26] and
[1:03:27] now very
[1:03:29] glorious Revelation 108 and the voice
[1:03:32] which I heard from Heaven who knows that
[1:03:34] John is a type of the Bride amen amen so
[1:03:37] what John heard you hear amen have you
[1:03:40] heard amen Have You Heard a Voice speak
[1:03:43] from Heaven say and I don't know how
[1:03:45] that voice manifest to you but it
[1:03:47] manifest to me in a thirst I have a
[1:03:49] hunger for God I have a thirst to to
[1:03:52] know more about my my bridegroom I want
[1:03:54] to know all about him not in head
[1:03:56] knowledge but in heart knowledge I want
[1:03:58] to know all about him I want to know his
[1:04:00] personality and all those things and and
[1:04:02] it all is revealed in there and I Heard
[1:04:05] a Voice which I heard from himen spake
[1:04:06] unto me again and said go and take the
[1:04:08] little book which is open Amen in the
[1:04:11] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[1:04:13] the sea and upon the Earth may the Lord
[1:04:16] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[1:04:17] word you may be seated
[1:04:22] amen we are eating the from the tree of
[1:04:25] life again
[1:04:28] Hallelujah you are what you eat amen
[1:04:33] amen so I want to just establish that as
[1:04:36] a foundation because we're going to
[1:04:38] we're going to soon go back to the time
[1:04:40] of Abraham and we're going to see a
[1:04:43] great picture unfold of God's Plan of
[1:04:49] Redemption brother brandom says
[1:04:53] here and this is just to
[1:04:56] further the foundation so that we can
[1:04:58] revisit these things later on in the
[1:05:00] sermon so if you're wondering where I'm
[1:05:02] going you just have to be a little bit
[1:05:03] patient what is this book of redemption
[1:05:06] this title deed Abstract title deed you
[1:05:09] say abstract what does an abstract mean
[1:05:13] it means it's searched all the way back
[1:05:15] to its beginning oh my we're going to go
[1:05:19] somewhere here like that little drop of
[1:05:21] ink this morning when it struck that
[1:05:23] bleach it went all the way back and When
[1:05:25] sin has been confessed and fallen into
[1:05:29] the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives
[1:05:32] an abstract right straight back to the
[1:05:35] Creator again amen and you become a Son
[1:05:37] of God Abstract title deed is held in
[1:05:41] the hand of the
[1:05:43] almighty oh my it's Redemption means all
[1:05:46] legal possession Amen to all all that
[1:05:51] was lost by Adam and Eve I want you to
[1:05:54] just say something with with me and
[1:05:56] we're going to say I have all legal
[1:05:57] possession I have all legal possession
[1:06:02] amen all legal possession Hallelujah now
[1:06:05] you might experience things in your life
[1:06:08] and things that are happening in your
[1:06:09] life that make you feel like you
[1:06:12] don't that devil is not going to just
[1:06:14] sit there and let you take that he going
[1:06:17] to fight you to The Bitter End he's
[1:06:19] going to fight you to try and destroy
[1:06:21] you to make you feel like you don't have
[1:06:24] what you actually have yeah that's right
[1:06:26] he's going to lie and he's going to
[1:06:28] deceive and he's going to do all these
[1:06:29] things so just because you're having a
[1:06:31] battle about it that's actually a good
[1:06:33] sign am that you have got something
[1:06:37] because if you're not being fought and
[1:06:39] you're not going through struggles and
[1:06:40] battles it means that you might not have
[1:06:42] it you know if it's just all easy and
[1:06:44] plain sailing all the time if the
[1:06:47] devil's not after you he's got
[1:06:49] you amen
[1:06:53] amen right
[1:06:57] going to go to Isaiah 51 I'm not going
[1:06:59] to preach too much at the moment but
[1:07:01] just want to lay this down
[1:07:04] harken harken now the reason I'm doing
[1:07:07] this is because and why I'm going back
[1:07:09] to Abraham is the inspiration came from
[1:07:11] here a long time ago to look to Abraham
[1:07:14] it says here hearken to me ye
[1:07:18] you that follow after
[1:07:20] righteousness ye that seek the Lord who
[1:07:23] seeks the Lord look unto to The Rock
[1:07:26] when ye are
[1:07:28] H this is all symbolism symbology or
[1:07:31] whatever and look unto the rock where
[1:07:34] you are human where did you come from
[1:07:35] what's the rock is Christ it's the rock
[1:07:38] you are human from The Rock Amen and so
[1:07:41] it's good to look at to the rock that
[1:07:43] you were he from it's good to find out
[1:07:45] your Eternal origin amen that you were
[1:07:48] one of those sons that shouted for Joy
[1:07:50] before the world even began Amen in the
[1:07:52] mind of God Amen and you'll find out one
[1:07:55] day we think now it's because it was in
[1:07:57] the mind of God it wasn't really there
[1:07:58] it wasn't happening it happened you were
[1:08:00] there because his mind is eternal just
[1:08:02] as real as you feel like you're right

[1:13:44] 15:1 after these things the word of the
[1:13:47] Lord came unto Abraham in a vision
[1:13:49] saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield
[1:13:51] and thy exceeding great reward amen and
[1:13:54] he brought him forth abroad and said
[1:13:58] sorry I've skipped some verses so just
[1:14:00] because for time and he brought him
[1:14:02] forth abroad and said look now toward
[1:14:04] heaven and tell the Stars if thou be
[1:14:07] able to number
[1:14:08] them and he said to him so shall thy
[1:14:11] seed be and he believed in the Lord and
[1:14:15] he counted it to him for righteousness
[1:14:17] see God's now making a covenant with
[1:14:20] Abraham amen and you watch there's a
[1:14:22] sacrifice now that's going to take place
[1:14:24] of a ram that is 3 years old how old was
[1:14:27] Jesus when he went to Calvary how old
[1:14:30] was his ministry the when the Heaven and
[1:14:32] Earth kissed 3 years old the sacrificial
[1:14:36] lamb had to be washed and at the at at
[1:14:39] the threee Mark or three and a half but
[1:14:40] 3 year M he was
[1:14:44] sacrificed and he believed in the Lord
[1:14:46] and he counted it to him for
[1:14:47] righteousness and he said unto him I am
[1:14:49] the Lord that brought thee out of er the
[1:14:50] caldes I give to give thee this land to
[1:14:54] inherit it so here God is giving Abraham
[1:14:58] the title deed of the natural promised
[1:15:02] land and he said verse 8 and he said
[1:15:05] Lord God whereby shall I know that I
[1:15:08] shall inherit it good question you want
[1:15:11] to know you want to
[1:15:13] understand the perfect love of God you
[1:15:16] want to understand these things because
[1:15:17] if you don't you'll perish with lack of
[1:15:19] knowledge you have see there is a Godly
[1:15:21] knowledge we cannot just kick knowledge
[1:15:23] out completely there's a God
[1:15:26] knowledge and that's understanding your
[1:15:28] position in the the the Judgment seat of
[1:15:31] Christ and the that's understanding who
[1:15:32] you are it's being red up to
[1:15:35] maturity so you can make a stand because
[1:15:37] your enemy he knows all the laws of God
[1:15:40] he knows how to Swindle everything and
[1:15:42] if you don't know how to stand in the
[1:15:44] courtroom of God in battle you will be
[1:15:47] defeated and you'll walk in defeat but
[1:15:49] if you can understand the the legal side
[1:15:51] of these things not legalism but the the
[1:15:54] spiritual legal laws of God and how they
[1:15:57] work then you can become a lawyer you
[1:16:00] can become an executor of things yes
[1:16:02] amen amen that's what God wants to raise
[1:16:04] you to do because you're going to judge
[1:16:06] the world one day with Christ and he's
[1:16:09] training you now to rule and reign with
[1:16:11] him he's training you to be governor of
[1:16:14] many cities providing your faithful
[1:16:16] right now he's training you he's putting
[1:16:18] you through test he's allowing you to
[1:16:20] understand the spiritual law of God now
[1:16:22] don't worry and get all FR I've got to
[1:16:25] learn all the laws I've got to learn all
[1:16:26] these things oh don't worry about that
[1:16:29] amen you just hold the captain's hand
[1:16:31] the trials you go through and God placed
[1:16:34] in your life he painted you with the
[1:16:36] human race he painted you with your
[1:16:38] predecessors he took all the DNA of your
[1:16:41] predecessors and everyone like that and
[1:16:42] he put them all together he made you a
[1:16:44] certain way God is Sovereign a God that
[1:16:46] can hold six se illion stars together
[1:16:48] and make them all orbit and put them in
[1:16:50] Balance how much more can he paint you
[1:16:52] out of your predecessors and put you a
[1:16:55] certain personality in you and then put
[1:16:57] you through a race a challenge a battle
[1:17:00] that's predestined to bring out a
[1:17:03] certain ring in your life a certain Ting
[1:17:05] on the bell of your life the new song
[1:17:08] that you sing Hallelujah with your life
[1:17:11] will be a certain flavor amen amen and
[1:17:14] he will train you up to be a
[1:17:18] ruler amen but the struggles you go
[1:17:21] through is to develop your character
[1:17:23] it's to remove things out of your life
[1:17:28] where was
[1:17:30] I H here we go take so now he says how
[1:17:33] will I know if I inherited it and he
[1:17:35] said unto him take me an hepher of 3
[1:17:37] years old and a she goat of 3 years
[1:17:40] old and a ram of 3 years old so there's
[1:17:43] a significance for 3 years old and
[1:17:45] that's why when I was think pondering on
[1:17:47] that the Lord reminded me that as after
[1:17:50] he was washed and and he he was washed
[1:17:53] as the lamb sacrificial lamb it was a
[1:17:55] three-year
[1:17:56] Ministry and a turtle do and a young
[1:17:59] pigeon and he took unto him all these
[1:18:02] and divided them in the midst so cut
[1:18:04] them in half and laid each piece one
[1:18:06] against another side by side but the
[1:18:09] birds he divided not and when the fouls
[1:18:11] came down upon the carcasses Abraham
[1:18:13] drove them away and when the sun was
[1:18:14] going down a deep sleep fell upon
[1:18:16] Abraham and lo and horror of great
[1:18:19] Darkness fell upon him and he said unto
[1:18:21] Abraham Abraham know of assurity that
[1:18:24] thy shall be a stranger in a land that
[1:18:26] is not theirs Satan was listening he was
[1:18:29] listening to this know of assurity that
[1:18:32] thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
[1:18:33] that is not theirs and Shall Serve them
[1:18:36] and they shall afflict them 400 years
[1:18:38] now it didn't say now we wonder some
[1:18:40] people critical and you know they say oh
[1:18:43] you know they they was more than 400
[1:18:45] years the word must be faulty or
[1:18:46] whatever but it says they shall afflict
[1:18:48] them 400 years so it doesn't say they'll
[1:18:50] be there could be there for 5 600 years
[1:18:52] but they were afflicted for 400 years so
[1:18:54] they were slaves for 400 years so they
[1:18:56] might have been 30 40 50 how many years
[1:18:58] uh under Joseph and the good pharaoh and
[1:19:00] that but then they went into slavery and
[1:19:01] that Affliction was 400 years and also
[1:19:04] that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I
[1:19:06] judge and afterwards they shall shall
[1:19:08] they come out with great substance and
[1:19:11] thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace
[1:19:13] Thou shalt be buried in a good old
[1:19:18] age you can see
[1:19:22] now God gave Abraham the
[1:19:25] title but God also placed something on
[1:19:29] that title there was nothing that
[1:19:31] Abraham could do or fast or pray or
[1:19:35] believe he believed there's nothing more
[1:19:37] that Abraham could do other than become
[1:19:40] subject to the very word that was being
[1:19:42] revealed to him and surrender to what
[1:19:45] the ordinances amen he might not have
[1:19:47] understand why circumcision I mean no
[1:19:49] how do we you know it's like it's not uh
[1:19:51] you don't just try and figure that out
[1:19:53] he just did it yes he he just did it he
[1:19:56] became subject to the word that was
[1:19:58] revealed to him by God who descended
[1:20:01] down in his day as mesc to give him
[1:20:03] Bread and Wine and same God giving him
[1:20:06] his title deed but God placed something
[1:20:08] on that title he placed a a clause an e
[1:20:12] an easement on that
[1:20:14] title that said that yes you're in the
[1:20:16] land I give it all to you and your seed
[1:20:18] shall inherit the land but your seed
[1:20:21] shall s j in Egypt for 400 years first
[1:20:23] so there was something that no matter
[1:20:25] what Abraham tried or prayed or cried
[1:20:28] out to God or how good he could be as a
[1:20:30] Christian or a uh whatever you call I
[1:20:33] say Christian there's nothing he could
[1:20:35] do to to to to to change or twist the
[1:20:39] program God placed an easement on the
[1:20:43] title but one day God was going to clear
[1:20:45] that title Hallelujah one day it was
[1:20:48] going to come open again amen
[1:20:51] hallelujah Abraham just so you know had
[1:20:54] the the faith and the power the
[1:20:57] anointing to take that land because it
[1:21:00] shows when he took all his Farmers
[1:21:02] Hallelujah with ice picks and Spades
[1:21:04] brother Bram said and he went and took
[1:21:06] and overcome all those kings with armies
[1:21:09] and horses Abraham had the anointing he
[1:21:12] had the ability to do it yes
[1:21:20] amen God carries on here says but in the
[1:21:23] fourth generation they shall come hither
[1:21:27] again for the iniquity of the amorites
[1:21:29] is not yet full and it came to pass that
[1:21:32] when the sun went down and it was dark
[1:21:34] Behold a smoking furnace which is hell
[1:21:37] and a burning lamp passed between those
[1:21:39] pieces so the pillar of fire or
[1:21:41] something went between the pieces and
[1:21:43] that was in those days was the sign of a
[1:21:45] covenant that God cuz Abraham wanted to
[1:21:48] know how am I going to inherit the
[1:21:50] promise how am I going to inherit my
[1:21:52] inheritance who's going to pay for this
[1:21:55] how am I going to take this land where
[1:21:57] is the
[1:21:59] Covenant and he asked the question and
[1:22:01] here God performs The Covenant in those
[1:22:04] days they divided the Beast and they set
[1:22:06] they walked through the middle of the
[1:22:08] Beast and that and and and that was the
[1:22:11] Covenant that they made in this time and
[1:22:14] so he says and so God makes this
[1:22:15] Covenant with
[1:22:17] him by a sacrifice of a ram that's 3
[1:22:20] years
[1:22:21] old and showing and type the very sacrif
[1:22:24] rice of Calvary in the same day that the
[1:22:27] Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying
[1:22:30] unto thy seed have I given this land
[1:22:33] from the river of Egypt unto the Great
[1:22:35] River the river Euphrates and now he
[1:22:37] names it out the kenites and the kenites
[1:22:39] and the cadit and the Hittites and the
[1:22:41] perizzites and the rims and the amorites
[1:22:43] Canaanites gites and jebusites all the
[1:22:45] ites amen and so all those ites those
[1:22:48] names actually all have meanings and you
[1:22:49] can associate the very meanings of every
[1:22:51] one of those names with the problems
[1:22:53] that you face in life
[1:22:55] right
[1:22:56] right but God's given you all the
[1:22:59] land amen he's given it all to
[1:23:11] you Genesis 161 and2 now Sarai Abram's
[1:23:15] wife bear him no children and she had an
[1:23:18] handmaid an Egyptian whose name was
[1:23:20] hagga and Sarai said unto Abraham behold
[1:23:23] now the Lord Lord has restrained me from
[1:23:25] bearing so there's a trouble troubles
[1:23:27] coming troubles coming the start of the
[1:23:31] church very
[1:23:33] first start the start of the church now
[1:23:36] that God had called Abraham out of the
[1:23:38] world out of Babylon he's now starting a
[1:23:40] church and right at the very beginning
[1:23:43] here comes the Antichrist Spirit here
[1:23:45] comes a false Vine that's about to come
[1:23:47] into the into into being here comes
[1:23:50] trouble for Israel trouble for Abraham's
[1:23:53] family that follow them right through
[1:23:56] and they're still troubling them today
[1:23:58] amen the Arab race not nothing against
[1:24:00] Arabs because there's elected Arabs as
[1:24:02] well it's not about flesh or anything
[1:24:04] but that they are from Hagar and and um
[1:24:09] Abraham that's the union is the Arab
[1:24:12] people now they have troubled Israel for
[1:24:17] 3,000 years 4,000 years that's a long
[1:24:21] time just from now what here what is it
[1:24:24] Sarah starts wanting the promise to come
[1:24:26] to pass she's getting now not in the
[1:24:28] wrong spirit either she just wants it to
[1:24:30] happen she's got faith or something
[1:24:33] human Faith she she's trying to make it
[1:24:36] happen God said it will happen it's
[1:24:39] going to happen
[1:24:40] yes so Sarah now and her ambition starts
[1:24:44] rising up she starts trying to make it
[1:24:47] happen
[1:24:49] she and Sarai said unto abrah behold now
[1:24:52] the Lord has restrained me from Beering
[1:24:54] I pray thee go in unto my mate it may be
[1:24:57] that I may obtain children by her and
[1:25:00] abrah hearkened to the voice of
[1:25:05] Sarai you know many times in the church
[1:25:08] when a pastor starts hearkening to the
[1:25:10] voice of the woman that he's pastoring
[1:25:13] the the church not saying us but it's
[1:25:15] been the the and and the the popular
[1:25:18] opinion the feminine opinion of this
[1:25:21] world and pastors which is like that
[1:25:23] relationship of brah and S they start
[1:25:26] hearkening they start crumbling and all
[1:25:28] of a sudden Antichrist Spirit comes in
[1:25:31] all of a sudden false things come in and
[1:25:33] everything all happen because they got
[1:25:35] to follow the Fashions they got to have
[1:25:36] their own
[1:25:41] captive Abraham hearkened to the voice
[1:25:43] of Sarai it's
[1:25:47] trouble Genesis 161 to 11-2 it says and
[1:25:51] the angel of the Lord now this is later
[1:25:55] this is after Sarai sorry Hagar had
[1:26:00] um had the baby uh was pregnant and it
[1:26:03] says and the angel of the Lord said unto
[1:26:05] her behold thou art with child and shall
[1:26:07] bear a son and shall call his name
[1:26:08] Ishmael because the Lord has heard thy
[1:26:12] Affliction and he will be a wild man my
[1:26:16] a wild man and his hand will be against
[1:26:19] every man and every man's hand against
[1:26:22] him and he shall do in the presence of
[1:26:25] all his
[1:26:26] Brethren isn't that trouble that's
[1:26:28] happened for 4,000 years because someone
[1:26:31] tried to make the promise come to pass
[1:26:33] you cannot make the promise come to pass
[1:26:36] you cannot fast forward the program of
[1:26:39] God Amen you cannot try and fast forward
[1:26:41] it and yes the problem is you know Sarah
[1:26:45] had gifts she was gifted her gift was an
[1:26:48] Egyptian maid and so now here Sarah now
[1:26:52] takes her gift and she anoints her her
[1:26:54] own gift and she starts to minister
[1:26:56] through her gift and she starts to take
[1:26:58] her gift and change the very church cuz
[1:27:02] Abraham now the church called out means
[1:27:03] Ecclesia called out now changing the
[1:27:06] church she now she's anointed her gift
[1:27:08] and she's now using her gift and her
[1:27:10] gift is
[1:27:11] now made to change things and make it
[1:27:15] happen and now we find many ministers in
[1:27:18] this message and many ministers all the
[1:27:20] way through everywhere that are
[1:27:22] anointed and they can see things in the
[1:27:25] word and they catch hold of something
[1:27:29] that may not have actually meant to be
[1:27:31] happening for a while and they start
[1:27:33] anointing their own gift and giving
[1:27:34] their gift and they start anointing it
[1:27:36] and they start preaching from their own
[1:27:38] gift and they take the church beyond the
[1:27:40] program of God or if they're complex and
[1:27:44] inferiorities and all the things like
[1:27:46] Saul and they follow this and that or
[1:27:48] maybe they're just scared because
[1:27:50] they've been told all these things and
[1:27:51] they take their gift and anoint it
[1:27:53] themselves and hold the people back and
[1:27:56] bring the People Back Into the
[1:27:57] Wilderness after they've crossed
[1:27:59] over or take the people further into the
[1:28:02] Millennium already or give the people
[1:28:05] Two Souls so they can sin and do all
[1:28:07] those things because they got a spirit
[1:28:08] of lust so they anoint that gift
[1:28:11] Sarah took her gift to make it promise
[1:28:15] come to pass now we now what do you got
[1:28:17] to do with your gift you're gifted all
[1:28:20] of you you've got gifts yes that's right
[1:28:22] don't you use your gift you can use it
[1:28:24] if you want God's not going to stop you
[1:28:28] but surrender that gift amen surrender
[1:28:31] that gift submit that gift let God use
[1:28:33] that gift because that gift if God can
[1:28:35] use it it's God God is the one that
[1:28:38] wants to he'll keep you where the pillar
[1:28:40] of fire is burning Hallelujah he'll keep
[1:28:42] you where the fire's warm amen where the
[1:28:44] fire's real you'll stay in the reality
[1:28:46] of this message Hallelujah you'll stay
[1:28:49] where the very battle is taking place
[1:28:51] where the scriptures is unfolding where
[1:28:52] the prophecy is happening
[1:28:54] now present tense walking with the
[1:28:57] everpresent Living God the I am amen he
[1:29:00] will keep you there amen the gift will
[1:29:02] stay there it will Minister from there
[1:29:05] Minister from eternity hallelujah amen
[1:29:09] that's
[1:29:12] right
[1:29:15] amen Israel 1 Corinthians 10:11 is our
[1:29:18] natural example now all these things
[1:29:21] happened unto them Israel for examples
[1:29:23] and and they are written for admonition
[1:29:26] upon whom the ends of the world have
[1:29:29] come you know Israel it's amazing so
[1:29:32] much like that is so much because you
[1:29:35] see
[1:29:38] Israel they get planted in the promised

[1:29:44] a land that's surrounded by
[1:29:47] enemies
[1:29:48] Hallelujah you know and you wonder
[1:29:50] sometimes why you're fighting and
[1:29:52] struggling because he's placed you in
[1:29:55] the middle of all your your enemies and
[1:29:58] this flesh this is the prom you know
[1:30:00] this is like the natural Promised Land
[1:30:01] you could say and it's like sinful
[1:30:03] nature and he's placed you your soul
[1:30:05] inside in the middle of all of your
[1:30:07] enemy your worst enemy amen but he said
[1:30:11] it's all yours take it Hallelujah you
[1:30:14] know brother bradam said in this quote
[1:30:15] he said that when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:30:17] into you it blends with your spirit so
[1:30:19] he comes in and then he pushes out amen
[1:30:23] your your your old nature your old it
[1:30:25] doesn't get kicked out it gets changed
[1:30:28] gets renovated by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:30:32] that's why he said be renewed in the
[1:30:34] spirit of your mind be renovated in the
[1:30:37] spirit of your mind let your
[1:30:38] subconscious mind be renovated amen and
[1:30:41] that's what we're speaking on today but
[1:30:43] we're taking a different angle so we
[1:30:44] might not mention subconscious very much
[1:30:46] today but just remember this is very
[1:30:48] much about the subconscious this is very
[1:30:50] much about all your memories and
[1:30:51] affections and all the things that's
[1:30:53] held in your life life that's holding
[1:30:54] you back they are your the Hittites and
[1:30:56] hivites and jebusites and one day we're
[1:30:59] going to speak about driving out your
[1:31:00] jebusite amen that enemy that's trampled
[1:31:03] you down and threshed you all your life
[1:31:05] that right punch that the brother Bon
[1:31:06] talks about you know the Lord can come
[1:31:08] and just give him another good one amen
[1:31:11] punch him out hallelujah hallelujah once
[1:31:14] your life anoints him kingen when your
[1:31:17] life anoints him King you can sit on the
[1:31:19] Pew you can come to church you can say
[1:31:21] all you want to say and please all the
[1:31:23] people but what is your life saying amen
[1:31:26] when your life anoints him King amen
[1:31:29] that makes a huge difference that's when
[1:31:31] he actually becomes king that's when
[1:31:33] actually you get the full victory in
[1:31:35] your life hallelujah amen turn not to
[1:31:39] the left or to the right meditate in it
[1:31:41] day and night you shall have good
[1:31:43] success Hallelujah if you're not willing
[1:31:46] to forsake all and follow him you will
[1:31:48] be an unsuccessful Christian you'll be
[1:31:50] an unsuccessful message believer
[1:31:54] successful now when I say that I don't
[1:31:56] mean like going out there and earning
[1:31:57] lots of money I'm talking about
[1:31:58] spiritual success Freedom Liberty the
[1:32:02] fruit of the spirit in your life
[1:32:03] Hallelujah the stature of the perfect
[1:32:05] man
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:09] hallelujah we're going to go now we're
[1:32:11] going to talk tell a little bit from
[1:32:13] Abraham to kaders Bia and we're going to
[1:32:16] take some some steps here and show you
[1:32:19] that you know Abraham now and Abraham
[1:32:23] had this conditional Covenant given to
[1:32:25] him God elected him and he called him
[1:32:28] out of Babylon he called Abraham from
[1:32:30] Idols amen hallelujah he looked beyond
[1:32:33] Abraham's fault and saw his need amen
[1:32:36] hallelujah and he took him out of that
[1:32:38] situation and now he started removing
[1:32:40] things out of his life and people out of
[1:32:42] his life that was holding him back amen
[1:32:44] and so he removes lot out of his life
[1:32:46] and once his dad was not even meant to
[1:32:48] bring his dad you know and when his
[1:32:50] dad's gone and then lot's gone and then
[1:32:51] the inheritance starts becoming more a
[1:32:53] apparent hallelujah what was just an
[1:32:55] apparition became apparent amen then it
[1:32:58] became materialized Hallelujah but that
[1:33:01] wasn't until later on Amen but Abraham
[1:33:04] was called out Hallelujah and now you
[1:33:06] see now God is actually calling out
[1:33:08] under election and he's giving him the
[1:33:11] title and he gives him the Covenant and
[1:33:13] he makes the sacrifice and divides it
[1:33:16] into two and passes between it amen like
[1:33:18] a type of Calvary right calls him out
[1:33:21] and then Abraham has Isaac and then the
[1:33:23] age continues on and Isaac now
[1:33:26] carries uh
[1:33:30] justification and then Jacob Now a type
[1:33:32] of Grace comes on the scene and God
[1:33:35] through all these people he reveals a
[1:33:37] bit more of himself and reveals a bit
[1:33:39] more of themselves and these men were in
[1:33:42] the promised land they were in the
[1:33:44] promised land they were Anointed with
[1:33:46] the same anointing as Abraham they had
[1:33:48] the faith that was written in Hebrews 11
[1:33:51] amen where they could pass on an
[1:33:52] inheritance were carrying the word of
[1:33:55] God they were carrying the light of his
[1:33:58] presence amen they were carrying amen
[1:34:01] that light that torch that baton of the
[1:34:04] word and they were passing it on to each
[1:34:06] other amen they were Messengers to their
[1:34:09] age amen they were prophets to their age
[1:34:13] they were Apostolic amen they were in
[1:34:16] the promised landall amen hallelujah and
[1:34:20] God would reveal himself to them and and
[1:34:22] he would beet meet Jacob one night
[1:34:24] Hallelujah and show what he's going to
[1:34:26] do with the latter amen how he's going
[1:34:29] to connect Heaven and Earth again amen
[1:34:32] and he's going to provide a great
[1:34:34] connection but brother brandham said
[1:34:35] that Jacob was a Shyer he could not hold
[1:34:39] he that lad could not anchor in Jacob so
[1:34:41] it was just an experience for him that
[1:34:43] God was showing things in time
[1:34:46] Hallelujah but now Joseph comes on the
[1:34:48] scene and Joseph a man a type of
[1:34:51] perfection he comes on the scene
[1:34:54] and now God's plan is starting to change
[1:34:57] because you see the seed that he that he
[1:35:00] SED into Abraham and the seed that
[1:35:02] passed on into Isaac and the seed that
[1:35:04] passed on into Jacob Hallelujah that
[1:35:06] seed God and His Divine Redemption plan
[1:35:10] had to go into the ground amen and so
[1:35:12] that seed now that got placed into Jo
[1:35:15] Joseph of the Cod of Many Colors amen
[1:35:17] and that inheritance that was going to
[1:35:19] go to him amen God was now ordering
[1:35:22] Joseph to take that seed into the ground
[1:35:24] and Joseph was put into this into that
[1:35:27] Cliff amen and the Israelites took him
[1:35:29] into Egypt Hallelujah and God was now
[1:35:32] taking what he started of this cool
[1:35:34] church and he's taking it into the Dark
[1:35:36] Ages taking it into darkness and
[1:35:39] slavery because he said he would because
[1:35:43] the seed the corn of wheat must come
[1:35:45] into go into the ground and die and run
[1:35:46] away because God wants to express
[1:35:49] restoration he wants to express himself
[1:35:52] as restorer as a the executor of a will
[1:35:56] amen hallelujah so now God's taking and
[1:36:01] so Joseph goes into the dark into Egypt
[1:36:05] and starts prospering in Egypt and the
[1:36:06] favor comes on the Pharaoh and draws the
[1:36:09] church Into the Dark
[1:36:13] Ages and then what's happening here in
[1:36:15] the dark ages of Israel now all they're
[1:36:19] losing their identity they're losing
[1:36:22] their vision of the apostolic age
[1:36:25] they're losing their identity and
[1:36:28] knowing who they are and the slave
[1:36:30] mentality starts to Dawn upon them they
[1:36:32] start thinking denominational thoughts
[1:36:35] my
[1:36:37] the chewed down like the caterpillar and
[1:36:40] Canker wom chewed down to a stump until
[1:36:44] they thought like slaves and it was
[1:36:46] ingrained in their mind and their
[1:36:49] thinking denominational slave mentality
[1:36:52] was coming upon
[1:36:55] them they became slaves to the power of
[1:36:57] Babylon because Egypt is the influence
[1:37:00] of Babylon the Tower of Babel that's
[1:37:03] where it all went that all that wisdom
[1:37:05] and P whatever that stuff is evil that's
[1:37:09] that that was coming upon them and they
[1:37:11] were thinking that idolatrous way and
[1:37:13] even though they had circumcision and
[1:37:16] where the some did and some didn't it
[1:37:17] was dwindling it was becoming weak they
[1:37:20] were starting to lose their identity
[1:37:24] it was slowly lost and the slave
[1:37:25] mentality took
[1:37:27] residence Satan was breaking the
[1:37:29] people's connection to the almighty he
[1:37:32] was trying to stop them from believing
[1:37:33] that inheritance because you
[1:37:36] see with a slave mentality how can you
[1:37:40] receive kingship how can you if you're
[1:37:43] thinking like a slave you get fearful
[1:37:44] and the Devil comes to you and tells you
[1:37:46] this and you get fearful and scared
[1:37:48] about why slave
[1:37:51] mentality too much denominational
[1:37:53] teaching
[1:37:54] too much tree of knowledge school these
[1:37:57] Public Schools it's tree of knowledge
[1:37:59] and it's designed and engineered to
[1:38:01] unbelief absolutely there's no faith in
[1:38:04] the schools no
[1:38:06] faith it kills and that is exactly what
[1:38:11] was happening to
[1:38:12] Israel under the Egyptian
[1:38:16] Taskmaster but you see God now would not
[1:38:19] leave them that way God's not going to
[1:38:21] leave you that way he's not going to
[1:38:22] leave anybody that way he will never
[1:38:24] leave Israel that way amen God was going
[1:38:27] to raise up a prophet Hallelujah and
[1:38:29] start ministering amen true identity
[1:38:32] again and restoring
[1:38:35] truth those ordinances and practical
[1:38:38] things to further circumcision to
[1:38:42] further yes we we believe that Christ
[1:38:46] died on Calvary for us we believe the
[1:38:50] baptism of the Holy Spirit we believe
[1:38:52] these things but there's more
[1:38:54] there's more ordinance there's more
[1:38:57] statutes there's more things to come
[1:38:59] forth from a Prophet The Prophet's going
[1:39:01] to bring these
[1:39:02] things going to bring from the heaven
[1:39:05] the Lord it says that Abraham did these
[1:39:07] things as he saw up there so what
[1:39:09] Abraham brought what the prophet brought
[1:39:11] was to change and to start the
[1:39:13] restoration process from thinking slave
[1:39:16] thoughts to thinking king and queen
[1:39:18] thoughts amen amen to think Royal
[1:39:21] thoughts Hallelujah to think thoughts
[1:39:23] that a coair with Christ amen hallelujah
[1:39:27] amen God cannot leave his church
[1:39:30] Abraham's Church in slavery he will not
[1:39:33] leave them there amen but they went
[1:39:35] through a refining process amen and then
[1:39:38] when the time of the promise drawn here
[1:39:39] he raises up a prophet amen and he
[1:39:43] starts speaking the word to them and
[1:39:44] they start as they start listening to
[1:39:46] that word as they start becoming subject
[1:39:48] to that word there's very things in
[1:39:51] there that's going to stop the Angel of
[1:39:52] Death from a affecting themall there
[1:39:55] very things and equipment and actions
[1:39:58] that God has given them through his
[1:40:00] Prophet to save them Glory from the
[1:40:02] angel of death
[1:40:05] Hallelujah they came out of Egypt that
[1:40:08] was the easy
[1:40:09] part the hard part started when they
[1:40:13] crossed over the Jordan uh sorry the Red
[1:40:15] Sea CU God now got to take Egypt out of
[1:40:18] them that's the easy part Saints coming
[1:40:21] out of Egypt and all of the super
[1:40:23] natural that goes on in the first part
[1:40:25] of your life or whatever however God
[1:40:27] deals with you that's the easy part
[1:40:30] remember that's just even not even the
[1:40:32] beginning it the beginning is when you
[1:40:34] cross over Jordan that's when you really
[1:40:35] start but you see now God's going to
[1:40:37] test to see what sign Faith you've got
[1:40:41] going to test these things so
[1:40:43] now in that transition point you know
[1:40:46] there raises up this
[1:40:48] prophet and now from from the dark ages
[1:40:52] of Joseph Joseph bringing them into the
[1:40:54] Dark Ages not that he did it but it was
[1:40:56] just the way the Lord ordered it now
[1:40:59] God's going to justify he's going to
[1:41:00] bring he's going to open up
[1:41:01] justification he's going to cleanse them
[1:41:03] by baptism he's going to restore baptism
[1:41:06] to them and so he takes them out of
[1:41:08] Egypt on Eagle
[1:41:09] wings and takes baptism and they baptize
[1:41:13] in the Red Sea un Moses it says amen
[1:41:15] they come through the Red Sea unto Moses
[1:41:18] baptized cleansed Justified and now the
[1:41:22] challenge comes Hallelujah and now the
[1:41:24] the sacrificial system comes and now the
[1:41:27] hardship comes and all the trials that
[1:41:30] come because now they're in the
[1:41:31] wilderness now God was in the wilderness
[1:41:34] don't ever think that when you're in the
[1:41:35] wilderness God isn't there he's with you
[1:41:37] he's with you if you're feeling
[1:41:39] Wilderness he's there he's putting you
[1:41:41] through it for a purpose amen and so you
[1:41:44] see now that in this and now the
[1:41:46] sacrificial system is restored and the
[1:41:48] blood is spilled again and they become
[1:41:50] Sanctified priesthood to God but God's
[1:41:53] not
[1:41:58] finished
[1:42:03] Hallelujah you see under the
[1:42:05] sanctification in the
[1:42:08] wilderness it was become an open book an
[1:42:12] Open Door sorry they come from the
[1:42:14] confinements of these homes and and and
[1:42:17] having their their their their time in
[1:42:20] Egypt and now they come out through the
[1:42:22] bapst
[1:42:23] justification and now they come into
[1:42:25] sanctification and now it's a big open
[1:42:27] air preaching time it's an age of an
[1:42:29] Open Door they can now go forth and
[1:42:31] they're right in the open arid deserts
[1:42:34] of Si amen and the sacrificial system is
[1:42:38] restored but there's also an uprising
[1:42:40] against these things and and there's all
[1:42:42] these fights and things that's going on
[1:42:43] because God's testing his people and now
[1:42:46] finally after a few days they come to
[1:42:50] Kadesh and here Mo
[1:42:53] now why they coming to kades is because
[1:42:56] this is now the time where they're going
[1:42:57] to receive the first fruits this is the
[1:43:00] time of the first fruits of the
[1:43:03] Resurrection amen this is the time where
[1:43:05] they're going to taste of the fruit of
[1:43:07] the
[1:43:08] land they got it's the the Judgment seat
[1:43:11] of the whole world brother brandham
[1:43:12] called it was that kades barer and
[1:43:15] they're all standing around and they
[1:43:17] send their spon and while they're
[1:43:19] sending their spon the devils are on all
[1:43:21] of them and the devils are just p
[1:43:23] pushing thoughts into their mind you're
[1:43:24] a slave God has brought you out here to
[1:43:27] destroy you and they were making them
[1:43:29] doubt the sincerity and integrity of God
[1:43:33] and the devil knew how to do it he would
[1:43:35] play on their slave mentality he would
[1:43:38] play on this thinking of slavery and
[1:43:40] after they had had their golden Cal and
[1:43:42] all those things and done all that
[1:43:45] showed that they still had a gypt in
[1:43:46] them it showed that they were still
[1:43:48] slaves to those things even though they
[1:43:50] had been brought out unto a mixed
[1:43:52] multitud was brought out and the slavery
[1:43:54] was manifesting itself and because it's
[1:43:56] so ingrained in them yeah but God one
[1:44:00] day is going to clear all that
[1:44:02] Hallelujah God's going to make sure that
[1:44:04] that's cleared Hallelujah and he's going
[1:44:06] to show us in type going to show us in
[1:44:08] these stories just how much he's going
[1:44:10] to do it for you because all these
[1:44:13] things that happened to Israel amen they
[1:44:15] only just happened naturally and en typ
[1:44:17] and it's a natural land and all those
[1:44:18] things and they lived out a
[1:44:20] Bible but it's really showing you
[1:44:22] something Hallelujah he's really showing
[1:44:25] you what he's going to
[1:44:27] do oh
[1:44:31] my they let the fear of the enemy
[1:44:33] their faith so you see they sent
[1:44:36] the 12 Spies into the land so men of God
[1:44:40] rose up went into the land and they came
[1:44:43] back and they tasted of that land they
[1:44:45] tasted of these gifts they tasted they
[1:44:48] heard prophets they heard the stories
[1:44:50] the great healing Revival starting to
[1:44:52] take place
[1:44:54] again they were tasting of it all but
[1:44:57] right at the same time that
[1:44:58] denominational slave mentality
[1:45:00] Hallelujah that denominational slave
[1:45:02] mentality the devil's playing on them
[1:45:04] and they can't believe
[1:45:06] it it's too much for them they despise
[1:45:08] the
[1:45:11] land and the fear crippled their
[1:45:15] faith
[1:45:16] see you have faith and the devil knows
[1:45:20] that he knows you've got faith cuz God
[1:45:23] gave it to you amen but he also knows
[1:45:25] that there's things that's happened in
[1:45:26] your past that may you fearful make you
[1:45:30] scared and so he just starts winding you
[1:45:32] those ways and make try and make you try
[1:45:35] to raise up that old slave mentality but
[1:45:37] I'm here to tell you today you can be
[1:45:39] delivered from that Hallelujah you can
[1:45:41] have none of that anymore and we're
[1:45:43] going to speak on that very soon
[1:45:45] Hallelujah so they let the fear of the
[1:45:47] enemy their faith and they
[1:45:49] despised the land through fear they lost
[1:45:52] their identity as the Church of God cuz
[1:45:54] they were called out of Egypt they were
[1:45:57] called into sanctification now they've
[1:45:59] being called to the restoration of the
[1:46:01] gifts at kades Baria and the gifts of
[1:46:02] the land come to them and fear comes
[1:46:05] upon them and denominational thinking
[1:46:07] comes upon them
[1:46:08] why
[1:46:11] because they bought Egypt with them they
[1:46:14] bought that denominational thinking with
[1:46:16] them it came through all those different
[1:46:18] ages from Egypt to Kadesh came through
[1:46:21] justification it came through the the
[1:46:23] sanctification still do the same
[1:46:25] practices still did the same things it
[1:46:27] wasn't there wasn't a complete clearing
[1:46:29] of the title The Devil had come the
[1:46:31] title that Abraham had I'll give you
[1:46:34] this land and you do this and this and
[1:46:36] this when they went into the Dark Ages
[1:46:38] Satan just added a whole lot more things
[1:46:40] and took a whole lot of things away so
[1:46:43] when they came out their their title
[1:46:45] deed their understanding of their
[1:46:46] inheritance was so full of junk so full
[1:46:49] of rubbish so full of Egyptian
[1:46:51] Babylonian Tower of Nimrod stuff all of
[1:46:54] those things was filling them so Satan
[1:46:56] just had a field day it was very easy
[1:46:58] for him to just send this thought and
[1:47:00] send that thought and send that thought
[1:47:01] holding them back from eating amen
[1:47:03] hallelujah holding them back from the
[1:47:05] land holding them back from eating parch
[1:47:08] corn amen as mature Sons and
[1:47:11] Daughters by slave mentality was all
[1:47:13] brought out
[1:47:17] Hallelujah old repressed memories rose
[1:47:20] up and they desired their old C their
[1:47:21] own captain
[1:47:23] you know that happened they got scared
[1:47:26] here's Joshua and Caleb who by mixing
[1:47:30] Moses word with faith this is the
[1:47:34] key what mooses see God gave Moses the
[1:47:37] message right to prepare them to go on
[1:47:39] the land not just when they're in the
[1:47:41] land but to how to get there this is
[1:47:43] what God has done here I'm going to
[1:47:45] clear your title understanding I'm going
[1:47:48] to clear your title so he starts
[1:47:50] preaching the word only Joshua and Caleb
[1:47:52] and maybe maybe the young ones I don't
[1:47:53] know maybe they weren't so full of Egypt
[1:47:55] by that stage but the older ones they
[1:47:56] were full of
[1:47:58] Egypt so Joshua and Caleb they had the
[1:48:01] they were the only ones that
[1:48:05] believed and all those other ones fear
[1:48:08] Came Upon them and they they lost their
[1:48:11] identity because Faith connects you to
[1:48:14] your identification Faith connects you
[1:48:16] to your
[1:48:17] inheritance and when Satan can wind you
[1:48:20] up and SC make you scared and fearful
[1:48:22] and down and all those things he's
[1:48:24] trying to disconnect you
[1:48:28] but what's that song called in your
[1:48:31] darkest hour keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:48:34] amen hallelujah when there's fear all
[1:48:36] around you keep your eyes on Jesus amen
[1:48:39] and you tell that devil you tell that
[1:48:41] devil Joy is mine victory is mine the
[1:48:45] title deed is mine it doesn't matter how
[1:48:47] you feel amen amen he will anoint your
[1:48:51] feelings that's right he knows EX L what
[1:48:53] software your subconscious wrote back in
[1:48:55] that time when you were traumatized by
[1:48:56] something or you were embarrassed by
[1:48:58] something and he just stimulates that
[1:48:59] very same thing and all of those
[1:49:01] chemicals start to come up ignore it be
[1:49:03] unconscious of it amen Enoch was
[1:49:06] unconscious of those things hallelujah
[1:49:09] amen he walked unconscious of fear
[1:49:11] unconscious of what people thought amen
[1:49:13] he walked with God Amen Hallelujah Caleb
[1:49:17] and Joshua walked with God Amen they
[1:49:21] walked they listened to what Moses said
[1:49:23] they became prepared Hallelujah they
[1:49:25] were prepared to stand amen they were
[1:49:29] prepared against fear because the word
[1:49:31] came forth to prepare them and the word
[1:49:34] has come forth to prepare you listen to
[1:49:37] that message Sint listen to the message
[1:49:40] that Jesus gave you listen to it it's to
[1:49:43] prepare you it's to help you you might
[1:49:45] not understand it all but it's there for
[1:49:47] help
[1:49:49] you're the word is in you amen and as
[1:49:52] you're receiving that word it's breaking
[1:49:55] strongholds it's loosening all the grave
[1:49:58] clothes amen hallelujah because it's he
[1:50:01] is the resurrection and the resurrection
[1:50:04] has descended on the scene with an open
[1:50:05] book Hallelujah and he said come and eat
[1:50:08] it hallelujah amen but see he's the true
[1:50:12] Captain God had prepared a true Captain
[1:50:15] for them just
[1:50:17] waiting you know he prepared a true
[1:50:19] captain and that Captain was going to
[1:50:21] lead the campaign once they crossed over
[1:50:25] but Satan thought I'm going to get them
[1:50:27] and so he laid them over with demon
[1:50:29] power and fear and tormenting them in
[1:50:32] their minds and they succumbed and they
[1:50:35] disconnected from their identity
[1:50:37] disconnected from their true identity of
[1:50:42] faith and what did they do what were
[1:50:45] they saying what was their ambition let
[1:50:48] us make our captain let us make our own
[1:50:51] captain let us make our own denomination
[1:50:55] to lead us back into Egypt where it was
[1:50:57] all good what are they doing today what
[1:51:01] What did the what did Pentecost do I'll
[1:51:04] just go forward a little bit what did
[1:51:05] Pentecost do they made their own Captain
[1:51:09] where did they return to where are they
[1:51:11] now they're in Egypt they're back eating
[1:51:15] the garlic of Egypt
[1:51:18] again reflecting Hollywood feeding on
[1:51:22] the tree of knowledge again where the
[1:51:24] tree of life was
[1:51:29] presented but even though in Israel
[1:51:31] these guys had had more freedom to do
[1:51:33] that Israel they wanted to go back to
[1:51:35] Egypt but they didn't go back they died
[1:51:36] in the
[1:51:39] wilderness this is the age of people's
[1:51:41] choices so God just gives them their
[1:51:44] choice yes that's right they want to go
[1:51:45] back to Egypt good on them well bad on
[1:51:48] them we don't want to go back to Egypt
[1:51:50] amen hallelujah we've heard a word amen
[1:51:52] [Music]
[1:51:56] hallelujah hallelujah complexes of
[1:51:58] slavery became too much for them they
[1:52:00] lost hold of their
[1:52:02] title because Faith connects you to your
[1:52:04] title and your entitlement now you're
[1:52:07] not entitled to now it's h this sounds
[1:52:10] bad God doesn't owe you nothing he owes
[1:52:12] you not a thing he he wants you to
[1:52:15] believe if you believe your faith will
[1:52:18] access every promise amen you recognize
[1:52:20] you're a coair with Christ
[1:52:23] Hallelujah the word came forth from
[1:52:25] Moses to clear their title but they
[1:52:27] failed to mix it with faith they were
[1:52:30] too worried about what others thought
[1:52:32] and popular
[1:52:33] opinions the entertainments of Egypt
[1:52:37] strangled their hold on God's very
[1:52:39] presence and the reality of what was
[1:52:41] happening even though they had seen the
[1:52:44] powerful fruit of Joshua's Ministry that
[1:52:48] he brought back from the
[1:52:49] land now we're going somewhere now
[1:52:53] because you see brother Bram had a jewel
[1:52:55] Ministry Jewel a
[1:52:58] jewel um purpose Moses and Joshua
[1:53:02] Ministry was combined in brother
[1:53:04] Brandon's Ministry we'll go into that
[1:53:07] soon but remember now see Joshua went
[1:53:11] into the land and he brought back fruit
[1:53:13] he brought back a supernatural fruit
[1:53:16] from the land and they couldn't connect
[1:53:18] with it they failed
[1:53:24] The Grapes of Revelation and the
[1:53:26] testimony of
[1:53:27] victory was too much for a slave
[1:53:31] mentality it was too much for someone
[1:53:33] that thinks they're a slave think on the
[1:53:35] word what does God say about you
[1:53:39] Hallelujah if you
[1:53:41] allow negative thoughts about yourself
[1:53:43] to rest in your mind for one second it's
[1:53:46] going to affect you it's going to hurt
[1:53:50] you you can cast it down straight away
[1:53:53] the feeling might take an hour to leave
[1:53:55] but the because there's a spirit that's
[1:53:56] attached to every thought thought is you
[1:53:59] know it's not just information when
[1:54:02] Satan gives you Authority the spirit of
[1:54:03] that the demon power in that thought
[1:54:05] starts to oppress
[1:54:08] you but how much more now if you let the
[1:54:13] thoughts of God when they come yes they
[1:54:17] can rest in my mind the The Plan of
[1:54:19] Redemption I said this last time the
[1:54:21] Plan of Redemption
[1:54:22] sat in the physical mind of Mary
[1:54:25] Hallelujah for whatever time it was amen
[1:54:27] the angel descended down with a message
[1:54:30] Hallelujah and he descended down and he
[1:54:32] preached the message to Mary the bride
[1:54:35] hallelujah amen and that thought that
[1:54:38] Plan of Redemption the very hinging of
[1:54:40] salvation for Humanity Hallelujah the
[1:54:43] answer to the very Genesis situation
[1:54:47] rested in her mind it sat there and she
[1:54:51] had to say yes she had to say be it unto
[1:54:54] me according to Thy word amen she had to
[1:54:57] agree with exactly what the angel
[1:55:00] ministered to her and that's exactly
[1:55:03] what is taking place today hallelujah
[1:55:06] amen the angel ministered to Mary the
[1:55:09] Tree of Life Hallelujah because what was
[1:55:13] born in her the Tree of Life Hallelujah
[1:55:17] just started off as two cells but the
[1:55:19] coming of the Lord had begun Hallelujah
[1:55:21] the coming of the Lord was already
[1:55:23] happening by two cells amen was already
[1:55:27] formed inside her
[1:55:31] womb so what did Joshua
[1:55:37] possess what did Joshua possess that was
[1:55:40] any different from
[1:55:41] Abraham
[1:55:47] amen Joshua 1: 1-8 Moses my servant is
[1:55:51] dead now therefore arise go over this
[1:55:53] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[1:55:56] land which I do give unto them even to
[1:55:58] the children of
[1:55:59] Israel every place that the soul of your
[1:56:01] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[1:56:03] unto you as I said unto Moses from the
[1:56:06] Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto
[1:56:09] the Great River the river Euphrates all
[1:56:12] the land of the Hittites and unto the
[1:56:14] great sea towards the going down of the
[1:56:15] sun shall be your Coast there shall not
[1:56:18] any man be able to stand before you all
[1:56:20] the days of your life as I was with
[1:56:23] Moses so shall I be with thee I will not
[1:56:25] fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and
[1:56:28] of a good courage For unto this people
[1:56:31] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[1:56:34] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[1:56:36] give them I don't see no easement here
[1:56:40] that's right I see nothing saying you
[1:56:42] got to wait for this amen it's yours now
[1:56:47] it's time Joshua had an open license
[1:56:49] Hallelujah to give them the land amen
[1:56:52] Joshua had the the very Victory amen
[1:56:55] where did it come from from the mouth of
[1:56:57] God hallelujah the word came forth
[1:57:00] that's the title is the word the
[1:57:02] preaching of the open book amen and so
[1:57:04] God now starts preaching an open book to
[1:57:06] Joshua in type amen starts preaching
[1:57:09] from this open book now there is nothing
[1:57:12] to stop you you are going to inherit
[1:57:14] this land little by little it's going to
[1:57:16] be done you just need to now hold the
[1:57:18] hand of the captain who are you going to
[1:57:20] meet Joshua when you cross over the
[1:57:22] Jordan amen hallelujah because you
[1:57:28] see
[1:57:29] Joshua had the
[1:57:32] whole land to give and what did he do
[1:57:36] let's just read
[1:57:40] it I just want to we're just going to go
[1:57:42] back a little bit because I want to show
[1:57:43] you now the very Mission
[1:57:46] briefing God now he doesn't just tell
[1:57:49] the people tell you to go and do
[1:57:50] something without giving you some detail
[1:57:52] house amen so he says here behold that's
[1:57:55] Moses behold an angel shall go before
[1:57:58] you to keep you in the way amen
[1:58:01] hallelujah and to bring you into the
[1:58:03] place which I have prepared beware of
[1:58:05] him and obey his voice provoke him not
[1:58:08] for he will not pardon your
[1:58:10] transgressions for my name is in him I
[1:58:13] am Jesus Hallelujah but if you shall
[1:58:16] indeed obey his voice and do all that I
[1:58:18] speak then I will be an enemy unto your
[1:58:21] enemies and then an adversary unto your
[1:58:23] adversaries for my angel shall go before
[1:58:25] you and bring you in unto the amorites
[1:58:27] and the Hittites perizzites Canaanites
[1:58:29] hites and giib isites and I will cut
[1:58:31] them off amen you shall not bow down to
[1:58:34] their gods nor serve them nor do after
[1:58:37] their works but you shall utterly
[1:58:40] overthrow them and Qui break down their
[1:58:42] images amen don't settle for Hollywood
[1:58:46] in your home don't settle for it break
[1:58:49] down those images amen utterly overthrow
[1:58:52] them don't allow Satan into your home

[1:58:57] because you see they will kill you they
[1:58:59] will destroy you they will keep you on
[1:59:00] the ground you will never be raptured if
[1:59:02] you continue to walk in Hollywood's
[1:59:04] light Hallelujah you cannot because
[1:59:08] someone that's going to be raptured will
[1:59:10] catch the word and utterly overthrow
[1:59:12] those things they will not succumb to
[1:59:14] Hollywood they will not get their Joy
[1:59:16] from the Tree of knowledge they will get
[1:59:18] their Joy from the giver and creator of
[1:59:20] Joy amen the one one and only Jesus
[1:59:23] Christ Hallelujah he is the creator of
[1:59:26] Joy he is the one amen hallelujah that's
[1:59:30] a Rapture people amen people that aren't
[1:59:32] connected to the Fashions of this world
[1:59:34] they walk unconscious of fashion amen
[1:59:38] hallelujah oh my
[1:59:41] Hallelujah so the difference between
[1:59:43] Abraham and Joshua was Abraham was in
[1:59:46] the land and given the land and Joshua
[1:59:48] now is here to restore the land but see
[1:59:51] there was no EAS on the title anymore
[1:59:53] Joshua was commissioned to take the
[1:59:55] people give them the land and lead the
[1:59:57] campaign under the headship of the
[1:59:59] captain and take them into the land and
[2:00:01] defeat everything and take them right
[2:00:03] through to defeat every single thing and
[2:00:05] God held nothing back everything that he
[2:00:09] promised he gave Hallelujah the Bible
[2:00:13] says that everything that Joshua God
[2:00:15] promised Moses and Abraham and
[2:00:17] everything it was right there everything
[2:00:20] all the ingredients all the to all the
[2:00:22] equipment all the spiritual power and
[2:00:24] everything was all there everything he
[2:00:27] had promised was
[2:00:29] manifested and All of You Shall Serve
[2:00:31] the Lord your God and he shall bless
[2:00:33] your bread and your water amen and I
[2:00:36] will take sickness away from the midst
[2:00:38] of you there shall nothing cast their
[2:00:40] young nor be Barren in your land amen
[2:00:45] the number of your days I will fulfill I
[2:00:48] will send my fear before you Hallelujah
[2:00:51] and will destroy all the people to whom
[2:00:54] you shall come and I will make all your
[2:00:56] enemies turn their backs unto you and I
[2:00:59] will send Hornets before you which shall
[2:01:01] drive out the Hite and Canaanite and the
[2:01:03] hittite from before you I will not now
[2:01:06] this is here you see now you don't want
[2:01:08] to rush ahead of the pillar of fire
[2:01:10] don't rush ahead of the program of God
[2:01:12] just surrender to the
[2:01:14] captain mixed his word that he gave
[2:01:16] through the message of the hour with
[2:01:18] faith surrender to the captain because
[2:01:20] this is how he's going to do it
[2:01:23] so don't get discouraged when you find
[2:01:24] things just keep coming at you and you
[2:01:26] there's just something why am I that's
[2:01:28] happening he's got a plan and a purpose
[2:01:31] he's predestined your
[2:01:33] fight I will not drive them out from you
[2:01:36] before you in one year L the land become
[2:01:39] desolate and the beasts of the field
[2:01:41] multiply against you little by little I
[2:01:45] will drive them out from before you
[2:01:47] until you be increased and inherit the
[2:01:50] land amen what does that mean what does
[2:01:53] that mean because I questioned and asked
[2:01:55] the Lord how do what does that mean a
[2:01:57] long time
[2:02:00] ago if he just gave you the land right
[2:02:02] now you wouldn't have the maturity to
[2:02:04] handle speaking things into existence
[2:02:06] you get angry and say something and all
[2:02:08] of a sudden 40 children would be killed
[2:02:10] by a
[2:02:11] beer so he's got to put he's got to
[2:02:13] leave some enemies in there some little
[2:02:15] complexes and things until you mature
[2:02:18] amen amen there a this is this is what
[2:02:21] he's got to do
[2:02:22] cuz you can imagine God just he's not
[2:02:24] one of those parents that just spoils
[2:02:26] their children and just gives them
[2:02:27] everything they never have to work or do
[2:02:30] anything salvation's like that but your
[2:02:33] Victory character is a victory not a
[2:02:36] gift amen hallelujah you got to go
[2:02:39] through some things amen you got to come
[2:02:42] to maturity to handle the freedom that
[2:02:44] comes from having perfect Faith
[2:02:47] Hallelujah having a
[2:02:49] clear identity no and you can say to
[2:02:53] this mountain be moved and it would
[2:02:54] happen oh God amen hallelujah amen
[2:02:58] you're like you know the the wife of the
[2:03:00] second Adam amen what did he do when he
[2:03:02] walked the Earth he had dominion over
[2:03:04] these things hallelujah amen and so you
[2:03:07] see now all of these little things
[2:03:09] inside your life and all of those things
[2:03:11] is going to just little by little and
[2:03:13] same with Israel here we'll just stay in
[2:03:14] Israel for a while we'll go back so it
[2:03:16] says you know that it's not going to
[2:03:18] happen straight away because you see God
[2:03:20] wanted to test them to see how much they
[2:03:21] love the Lord thy God Amen and so these
[2:03:24] enemies was around them a little bit you
[2:03:26] know they procrastinated but you see if
[2:03:29] they had just stayed with the captain
[2:03:31] and they just held his hand and did what
[2:03:34] he said and prayed and connected with
[2:03:36] the very campaign manager they would
[2:03:38] have just continued to inherit more and
[2:03:39] more and more and more and they would
[2:03:42] have had all of it in all of Jerusalem
[2:03:44] in about probably 40 years or whatever
[2:03:46] it may have been I don't know we're just
[2:03:48] conjecturing but how long did it take
[2:03:50] them 400 years or 500 years it took them
[2:03:55] to get the land the tribe of Dan He
[2:03:58] procrastinated for a long time and
[2:04:00] didn't hear anything he was in no man's
[2:04:02] land to I don't know procrastinating
[2:04:05] wasting time not really getting you know
[2:04:09] like Hannah she just got really sincere
[2:04:10] one day amen and she thought no I'm not
[2:04:14] going to stay
[2:04:15] Barren that's it I'm going down to the
[2:04:17] temple and I'm going to go and pray and
[2:04:19] I'm going to stay there until God does
[2:04:20] something for me because cuz I'm sick of
[2:04:22] being unfruitful I'm sick of being down
[2:04:24] I'm sick of being teased I'm sick of
[2:04:26] being troubled by demons sick of it so
[2:04:29] she really got down and she really meant
[2:04:32] business and she had a visitation from
[2:04:33] the high priest of her profession amen
[2:04:36] the high priest came and spoke a word to
[2:04:38] her and she brought forth a prophet that
[2:04:40] changed the nation amen
[2:04:44] hallelujah sometimes we have to do that
[2:04:50] amen you know
[2:04:52] there is nothing you can do to alter
[2:04:54] God's program and you cannot produce
[2:04:57] anything more than the grace of God is
[2:04:58] giv to your age amen hallelujah and so
[2:05:02] every age had their own characteristic
[2:05:05] and their own agenda from the Lord the
[2:05:08] elect and their own Revelation partial
[2:05:11] revelation of Christ until finally at
[2:05:14] the end time where God would just pour
[2:05:16] everything out and give everything but
[2:05:18] then he would Place something on like
[2:05:19] this and he would say you know I've
[2:05:21] given you everything and you can take it
[2:05:24] just hold my hand and walk with me
[2:05:27] because I'm the campaign manager and I'm
[2:05:29] going to give you it little by little
[2:05:32] amen turn not to the left or to the
[2:05:34] right and all those Idols that you wor
[2:05:37] worship before the flood he says through
[2:05:39] Joshua you know when Joshua called them
[2:05:42] all together before he died and he he
[2:05:43] gave a had a big meeting and he said you
[2:05:46] know because they still had idols and
[2:05:48] some of us still have Idols that's right
[2:05:50] in our homes
[2:05:53] some of us still have le in our
[2:05:57] houses Joshua calls a meeting before
[2:05:59] he's passing off the sea and he says all
[2:06:02] those Idols that your parents worship
[2:06:03] before the flood get rid of them and
[2:06:06] choose you this day whom you're going to
[2:06:08] serve whose side are you on where is
[2:06:11] your joy coming from where is your
[2:06:13] entertainment coming from oh my are you
[2:06:17] content Hallelujah with the lily of the
[2:06:20] valley amen are you content with the
[2:06:22] rose of Sharon fragrance in your home
[2:06:25] amen are you connected with the Tree of
[2:06:27] Life are you feasting on the
[2:06:30] tree my my Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah
[2:06:33] so now we're just going to show you
[2:06:35] something here you might have already
[2:06:37] know I was insinuating the seven Church
[2:06:39] ages in the Old Testament and see what
[2:06:42] we have here and I want to introduce you
[2:06:43] to this um this thought and this is
[2:06:46] where we're going we have
[2:06:49] Abraham and Ephesus
[2:06:52] we have Isaac and
[2:06:54] smyrner we have Jacob pergamos then we
[2:06:58] have the Dark Ages sitting in under
[2:07:00] Joseph and
[2:07:01] thyra now if we had six months we could
[2:07:04] go into all of the similarities and all
[2:07:07] of these people's lives and show you
[2:07:10] it's all there but we're not going to do
[2:07:11] that because that's not the scope so
[2:07:13] here here we have these Church ages and
[2:07:15] these guys were in the promised land
[2:07:17] these guys were in the in the apostolic
[2:07:19] age they had been connect connected with
[2:07:22] people that had a true identity a true
[2:07:25] identification they were connected they
[2:07:28] they the very Life of Christ was on
[2:07:30] display they had no troubles with with
[2:07:33] with with really being knowing their
[2:07:35] title deed knowing their inheritance but
[2:07:37] what happened in the Dark Ages is that
[2:07:40] identity started to be lost and it
[2:07:43] started to form denominational thoughts
[2:07:45] and the elect church that was crumbled
[2:07:47] down was only very
[2:07:50] little and
[2:07:52] actually God didn't use those
[2:07:55] underground churches really to to to
[2:07:58] bring the restoration he took the
[2:07:59] restoration right out of Rome he took
[2:08:01] the restoration out of a priest of Rome
[2:08:05] Luther because he wanted to do it little
[2:08:08] by little wanted to do it through Luther
[2:08:12] because he knew Luther would bring a
[2:08:13] whole lot of Egypt with
[2:08:16] him and so here we have
[2:08:21] the Red
[2:08:24] Sea we have red here I put red here
[2:08:26] because that was the blood on the ltil
[2:08:28] that stopped the Angel of Death from
[2:08:30] destroying them so that they could leave
[2:08:32] Egypt and they came across the blue here
[2:08:34] the Red Sea Under justification
[2:08:37] Sardis and then they came into the
[2:08:40] Wilderness which is Philadelphia which
[2:08:43] is where sanctification was restored
[2:08:45] where the sacrificial system was
[2:08:46] restored where the rock in the
[2:08:48] wilderness was given and God's provision
[2:08:51] was there and now we come right up to
[2:08:54] Kadesh barer in the age of Leo DEA and
[2:08:57] here we have the River Jordan and here
[2:09:00] is where the buck stops here is where
[2:09:02] you cross this you have passed the point
[2:09:04] of no return you're dead to yourself
[2:09:07] you've you've surrendered your Ambitions
[2:09:10] the ones that you're conscious of
[2:09:12] because remember even when you cross
[2:09:14] over Jordan and you enter into the
[2:09:17] land god starts to bring other things up
[2:09:20] that you didn't even know were there
[2:09:21] that's right brother you thought you
[2:09:23] died to
[2:09:24] everything and you did consciously you
[2:09:27] didn't want to do all those things
[2:09:29] andmore you were enough you were at rock
[2:09:30] bottom you're sick of it sick of sin and
[2:09:33] sick of being dealt to by enemies so you
[2:09:36] died to yourself and you got down on
[2:09:38] your knees and you prayed until God came
[2:09:41] hallelujah amen then you crossed Jordan
[2:09:44] now what do you do when you cross Jordan
[2:09:45] Hallelujah now what do you do now when
[2:09:48] you cross into the bright age
[2:09:51] amen when you come back because you see
[2:09:55] in all these ages whenever they got
[2:09:58] their experience with God they stayed
[2:09:59] where the program was but when you get
[2:10:02] your experience with God you come out
[2:10:04] you go right out of Egypt and come into
[2:10:06] the Promise Land because this is where
[2:10:09] the program is this is where it is and
[2:10:12] you will get the new birth from this
[2:10:13] message you will get the new birth from
[2:10:15] the preaching of this word amen cuz this
[2:10:18] is the word that's come to Quicken the
[2:10:20] bride this is the word that's come to
[2:10:22] Quicken the predestined seed in your
[2:10:24] life hallelujah amen so when you get
[2:10:28] born again you not going to stay at
[2:10:30] kades barer and have the gifts only
[2:10:32] Hallelujah but you're going to come into
[2:10:34] fellowship with The Giver of the gift
[2:10:36] Hallelujah you're going to come into
[2:10:37] fellowship with the descended Mighty
[2:10:39] angel with an open book hallelujah amen
[2:10:42] that Captain's going to destroy your
[2:10:44] pasten amen that's what's going to
[2:10:46] happen Hallelujah and so when you get
[2:10:48] born again you're going to Cross Jordan
[2:10:50] and all your sins are going to be taken
[2:10:52] down into the Dead Sea the lowest part
[2:10:54] on the earth amen and they're going to
[2:10:56] be swallowed up in Victory amen glory to
[2:10:59] Jesus amen and so see here you come into
[2:11:02] the bright age now you see now Joshua
[2:11:05] and all them people will go back to
[2:11:07] Israel a little bit and you see now
[2:11:09] they're sitting around they're wondering
[2:11:11] what's going on Hallelujah and they see
[2:11:13] their first Frontier is this is this big
[2:11:16] stronghold because you know what
[2:11:18] happened back in the time of Abraham am
[2:11:21] Hallelujah when God was telling him what
[2:11:24] was going to happen Abraham the devil
[2:11:27] was listening and he was building he
[2:11:29] says right then I've got 400 and
[2:11:31] something years and I'm going to make it
[2:11:33] so hard for them my he was prepared when
[2:11:37] Israel crossed the Red Sea that day
[2:11:39] Satan was prepared he was waiting for
[2:11:42] them and he had 400 years of demon power
[2:11:45] and all these things to make it so scary
[2:11:48] and he and he had it all planned out
[2:11:50] ready
[2:11:51] waiting and he knew exactly the slave
[2:11:54] mentality that was going to be into
[2:11:56] their minds and all the things and how
[2:11:58] and they would have those task masks he'
[2:11:59] anoint them and he would say things to
[2:12:01] them and beat them down just like you
[2:12:03] sometimes do with your own thinking down
[2:12:04] in your heart and you beat yourself down
[2:12:06] you call yourself stupid and you get
[2:12:08] angry at yourself and all those things
[2:12:10] my don't do that my my no you see so
[2:12:15] Satan spent 400 years and he built up
[2:12:17] these strongholds and he built up all
[2:12:19] these things just like he buil builds up
[2:12:22] things in your grandparents and parents
[2:12:24] and great great grandparents he builds
[2:12:25] up all these complexes and he makes it
[2:12:27] so hard for a Believer to receive the
[2:12:28] truth and he creates these Western
[2:12:30] civilizations full of fashion and
[2:12:32] Hollywood and schools that are going to
[2:12:35] program the children's Minds to stop
[2:12:37] them from being able to really
[2:12:39] believe Hallelujah I mean now some of
[2:12:42] our children go to school you just need
[2:12:43] to spend a lot more time to undo all of
[2:12:46] the satanic thoughts that they get every
[2:12:48] day and if you don't just remember there
[2:12:50] will be a hard one day and it will be a
[2:12:53] negative Harvest so you have to spend
[2:12:55] the time on your children spend the time
[2:12:58] when they get back from school and undo
[2:13:00] satanic thoughts undo all that thinking
[2:13:02] it will come out of their mouths if
[2:13:03] they're a loud person if they're a quiet
[2:13:05] person you've got to fish it out if they
[2:13:08] don't talk you fish it out amen start
[2:13:10] talking to them you have to because it's
[2:13:13] going in the devil's got them for 8
[2:13:16] hours or 6 hours a day and it's going in
[2:13:18] so you need to spend the time so it's
[2:13:21] you just have to so here we
[2:13:25] are Satan prepared the enemy and he had
[2:13:30] these walls so thick that they could run
[2:13:32] chariot races around them my but God had
[2:13:35] a bride Hallelujah God had a female in
[2:13:39] there that was stuck in sin stuck in
[2:13:42] prostitution stuck in slavery and a
[2:13:44] whole life was dictating to her and
[2:13:47] everyone she was down in society no one
[2:13:49] thought anything much of her
[2:13:52] only for the wrong
[2:13:54] reason she was stuck God had a bride
[2:13:57] there and he
[2:13:58] had something had stopped the master
[2:14:01] amen he had a plan amen
[2:14:05] hallelujah so there's these big
[2:14:09] strongholds and you know they're
[2:14:10] wondering because these people were
[2:14:12] faithful people they had seen God move
[2:14:14] but they didn't know what was going to
[2:14:15] happen you see and sometimes we don't
[2:14:17] know what's going to happen right we
[2:14:19] don't know how it's going to happen but
[2:14:21] you can rest assured it's going to
[2:14:22] happen you can rest assured that God is
[2:14:25] going to rescue you out of whatever
[2:14:27] trouble you're in amen you can rest
[2:14:30] assured that maybe you can't
[2:14:32] identify completely as being the Bride
[2:14:35] of Jesus Christ yet maybe you're stuck
[2:14:37] around a 20 foot concrete wall of
[2:14:40] unbelief something that's holding you
[2:14:42] back but you can rest assured that
[2:14:44] there's going to be a word released in
[2:14:46] your life amen you can rest assur that
[2:14:48] the captain is concerned about you amen
[2:14:51] you can rest assured that he wants to
[2:14:53] marry you amen he wants to you to know
[2:14:56] that you're his bride he wants you to
[2:14:58] know that how much he loves you amen how
[2:15:01] much he wants to redeem you out of your
[2:15:03] situation
[2:15:06] Hallelujah and so they're having their
[2:15:07] meeting Joshua and his generals and all
[2:15:10] of his men and they're sitting down
[2:15:13] whatever they're doing having their
[2:15:14] parch corn amen hallelujah feeding on
[2:15:17] the word amen probably reading the law
[2:15:19] and all of a sudden the atmosphere
[2:15:21] changes and Joshua says excuse me
[2:15:23] Brothers I'm going outside and he walks
[2:15:26] outside and silhouetted if I had a
[2:15:28] bigger picture silhouetted on the
[2:15:31] horizon amen is this man standing there
[2:15:33] with a sword drawn in his hand
[2:15:35] Hallelujah and this man had a certain
[2:15:37] Poise about him of of of battles about
[2:15:41] to start amen hallelujah there's Victory
[2:15:43] about to be won and Joshua wondered if
[2:15:45] he was for him or for the enemy amen CU
[2:15:48] if he was for the enemy I think Joshua
[2:15:49] is going to have some second thoughts
[2:15:51] amen cuz this they must have commanded a
[2:15:53] bless a a real a commanding nature amen
[2:15:58] and so you see now Joshua approaches
[2:16:00] this
[2:16:02] man and he receives the very opening of
[2:16:05] the word amen he receives the message he
[2:16:09] receives the victory day he receives the
[2:16:12] very ingredient that's going to search
[2:16:16] back and undo all sin in rahab's life
[2:16:21] yeah he's going to release the very
[2:16:24] secret the mystery that was hidden in
[2:16:26] the back part of God's mind amen
[2:16:29] hallelujah on how to conquer this
[2:16:31] unconquerable Fortress amen hallelujah
[2:16:35] he's going to release the word and he
[2:16:38] took his Prophet up onto Mount Sunset
[2:16:40] glory to God and he released the word to
[2:16:42] him
[2:16:43] amen hallelujah hallelujah gave him the
[2:16:46] word and he took it back and said you
[2:16:48] must preach this seven
[2:16:51] part message you go around that City
[2:16:54] seven times amen and on the seventh time
[2:16:57] in the seventh Church age amen at the
[2:17:00] evening time amen you go around that
[2:17:02] place seven times you take the
[2:17:04] revelation of all Seven Ages and the
[2:17:06] light that Shone in every age and the
[2:17:08] revelation of Jesus Christ and you can
[2:17:10] accumulate it into one message
[2:17:13] Hallelujah and you preach that and you
[2:17:15] take your people and bequeath it to the
[2:17:17] people hallelujah and so the people the
[2:17:21] arm of the Lord amen God's Army
[2:17:25] hello they take that word amen and they
[2:17:29] start submitting to that word they
[2:17:31] surrender to that word they believe that
[2:17:33] word amen they know that this man had
[2:17:37] been Vindicated amen Joshua was
[2:17:39] Vindicated in the eyes of the people
[2:17:41] whatever Joshua said they believed amen
[2:17:44] even if they didn't understand what he
[2:17:46] was saying hallelujah they believed it
[2:17:49] Hallelujah because because God was
[2:17:51] speaking through this man Hallelujah and
[2:17:54] what this man was going to say was going
[2:17:56] to release the bride it was going to
[2:17:59] give her an identity but you see
[2:18:02] surrounding the bride's identity was
[2:18:05] prostitution spiritual prostitution you
[2:18:07] could say denominational
[2:18:10] thinking unbelief science evolution
[2:18:13] whatever it may be surrounding her
[2:18:16] thinking her whole life surrounded by
[2:18:19] the the the old Stu reality of of of sin
[2:18:25] and yet she had heard amen that there
[2:18:29] was a living God Amen she had heard that
[2:18:31] Bible days were here again Hallelujah
[2:18:34] she had heard that things were different
[2:18:36] things were changing it wasn't just
[2:18:38] going to be some religiosity anymore
[2:18:40] we're not going to worship some Stone
[2:18:42] we're not going to kiss some image
[2:18:44] Hallelujah but they're going to have a
[2:18:46] real true Living God on the scene and
[2:18:50] something r up in rahab's heart amen and
[2:18:52] she believed it and God reckoned that
[2:18:55] righteous Hallelujah God appreciated
[2:18:58] that and if you want to please God
[2:18:59] believe his word amen hallelujah if you
[2:19:02] want to give God glory get in position
[2:19:05] amen hallelujah if you want to give him
[2:19:08] glory let your life anoint him King let
[2:19:12] your life say
[2:19:13] Amen my goodness Hallelujah and so you
[2:19:17] see they obeyed what the captain said
[2:19:22] Joshua comes back to his meeting he says
[2:19:24] I've got it I've got the revelation of
[2:19:26] the Seven Seals amen I'm going to preach
[2:19:29] it hallelujah we're going to live the
[2:19:31] sermon Saints Hallelujah the sermon that
[2:19:34] we live is the very Revelation that this
[2:19:37] Captain brought Hallelujah with a sword
[2:19:39] drawer ready to destroy all the enemies
[2:19:42] amen and so you see they the next day
[2:19:44] they start obeying then on the seventh
[2:19:46] day Hallelujah they've got the trumpets
[2:19:48] ready and they're ready to shout amen
[2:19:50] Hallelujah because the Lord has
[2:19:52] descended with a shout hallelujah and
[2:19:54] they're going to shout in the evening
[2:19:56] time at the end of the seventh day we're
[2:19:58] right at the end of the seventh day it
[2:19:59] is midnight now hallelujah it's time to
[2:20:02] shout hallelujah it's time to shout the
[2:20:04] presence of God time to shout the glory
[2:20:07] of God Worthy is the Lamb oh Father
[2:20:11] Hallelujah and so they come and they go
[2:20:14] around and they do seven times one day
[2:20:16] and they shout and now Rahab is inside
[2:20:20] and all of us
[2:20:21] son nothing that she did nothing that
[2:20:24] she did all she did was believe all of
[2:20:28] her past all of those demon thoughts all
[2:20:30] of the destruction was crumbling around
[2:20:34] her but she could feel the peace
[2:20:36] Allelujah she had peace why her enemy
[2:20:39] why her whole life the past and all the
[2:20:42] pronating sin was being crumbled around
[2:20:45] her while the accusers of her foul life
[2:20:49] were being destroyed Hallelujah she was
[2:20:53] witnessing the very effect of the seven
[2:20:56] seal revelation of the captain
[2:20:58] Hallelujah to see her life crumbling all
[2:21:00] around her she was being freed she
[2:21:03] wasn't doing anything she just believed
[2:21:06] she acted upon the message Hallelujah
[2:21:10] that those spies came in with some tapes
[2:21:12] Hallelujah they came into her house and
[2:21:14] gave it some tapes amen and she started
[2:21:17] listening and she wondered oh this is
[2:21:19] different I haven't seen or heard this
[2:21:21] before amen that's right amen she just
[2:21:24] did it she didn't question it she just
[2:21:26] did it amen what happened Hallelujah her
[2:21:29] life started crumbling around her
[2:21:31] Hallelujah because there's power in the
[2:21:33] revelation of this message Hallelujah
[2:21:35] there's a reality as been talked about
[2:21:37] the reality of this message is not
[2:21:41] statutes and laws the reality is you
[2:21:44] stand in your home and watch your whole
[2:21:46] life crumble away and you come and now
[2:21:50] your old identity is destroyed amen amen

[2:22:03] just I just put on Jesus Christ I put
[2:22:06] off the old manner of Life put off the
[2:22:08] old
[2:22:09] conversation because you know the new
[2:22:11] conversation putting on Jesus Christ is
[2:22:15] that very thing that will undo all the
[2:22:17] complexes it will undo all the works of
[2:22:20] darkness it'll defeat the enemy and you
[2:22:23] might not even understand why but God
[2:22:25] Knows Why and and in hindsight you look
[2:22:28] back and I go oh that's why that's what
[2:22:30] happened didn't even recognize but it
[2:22:32] happened see God interprets his word by
[2:22:35] bringing it to pass amen not just on the
[2:22:37] age level but in your life level in your
[2:22:39] home in this church it makes he makes it
[2:22:42] happen
[2:22:44] Glory
[2:22:46] Hallelujah you see
[2:22:48] now Hallelujah this just gets rich too
[2:22:50] you know so Ephesus
[2:22:55] Paul
[2:22:57] irenius Martin and
[2:23:01] Columba these men were
[2:23:04] Apostolic they had an identity linked
[2:23:06] back to
[2:23:08] Calvary they were the fathers of our
[2:23:12] faith that our hearts have been turned
[2:23:13] back to amen catch
[2:23:17] that they were connected to the
[2:23:21] message and the message of Christ he is
[2:23:23] the message ties them back to everything
[2:23:26] that was lost in Eden they were an
[2:23:29] Apostolic people amen but true to form
[2:23:34] the seed that was sewing in Abraham I
[2:23:36] mean
[2:23:39] Paul was slowly going down down down
[2:23:44] into the dark
[2:23:47] age because this false Vine was in there
[2:23:52] and so in the Dark Age under Catholic
[2:23:55] rule the church lost its identity it
[2:23:59] started thinking slave mentality for 800
[2:24:02] years 900 years of Dark Age and you see
[2:24:07] Satan was biting that brid tree down to
[2:24:08] a
[2:24:09] stump but Hallelujah you see now God now
[2:24:13] raises up
[2:24:17] Luther and Luther comes out
[2:24:21] justification but he carries the big
[2:24:25] suitcases of
[2:24:27] Rome and then out of the English church
[2:24:31] comes John Wesley in
[2:24:34] Philadelphia and he brings sprinkling
[2:24:37] baptisms and all these things he brings
[2:24:40] bags with them the title hadn't been
[2:24:43] cleared yet there were still easements
[2:24:46] and there still claims that the devil
[2:24:47] the accuser could accuse them to stop
[2:24:50] them from manifesting as sons of God
[2:24:52] because there's hybrid seed in their
[2:24:55] teaching they were planting that hybrid
[2:24:57] seed in their congregation still and so
[2:24:59] they could only climb so far they were
[2:25:02] only becoming so much of an image of
[2:25:03] Christ they were
[2:25:06] still stuff that needed to be cleared
[2:25:08] off there was still an abstract search
[2:25:11] that needed to be made
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:16] Hallelujah and so and Leo DEA the
[2:25:19] Pentecostal Church yeah yes they had the
[2:25:21] gifts and all right they thought it was
[2:25:25] it but and it looked very similar you
[2:25:28] see but they still had father son Holy
[2:25:31] Ghost baptism and and believe there's
[2:25:33] three people in the godhead and and they
[2:25:36] were they were sewing the seed into the
[2:25:38] hearts of their and they were bride they
[2:25:41] were elect in their time cuz God was
[2:25:43] still restoring he was blinking his eye
[2:25:46] at the ignorance because he hadn't
[2:25:47] restored it he was working
[2:25:51] he was going to at some stage he was
[2:25:53] going to at this stage here right at
[2:25:55] this point he's going to clear the title
[2:25:58] amen and then he's going to execute the
[2:26:00] inheritance here amen and
[2:26:04] so they carried it all with them Luther
[2:26:07] brought Rome Wesley brought
[2:26:09] Rome Pentecost brought Rome but now the
[2:26:13] Joshua commission came to bring the
[2:26:15] church out of the Wilderness and into
[2:26:18] the fullness of godu Hallelujah

[2:27:52] of life we're eating the Tree of Life
[2:27:55] Hallelujah we've come into connection
[2:27:56] with a captain Hallelujah that's taken
[2:27:59] now and he took justification and he he
[2:28:03] took it and he searched it back
[2:28:05] Hallelujah and instead of just having
[2:28:08] faith so that you don't get in trouble
[2:28:10] for sin this justification says you
[2:28:12] never sinned in the first place he
[2:28:14] searched an abstract search he took the
[2:28:16] title deed and he said where there's
[2:28:18] justification written on the title deed
[2:28:20] and he searched it back and he said you
[2:28:22] didn't even sin in the first place and
[2:28:24] I'm going to lay it all on the devil
[2:28:27] amen that's justification with the
[2:28:29] abstract title search the abstract
[2:28:31] search back to its beginning amen
[2:28:34] hallelujah my he took
[2:28:37] sanctification and he and he and he and
[2:28:40] he magnified it right up until
[2:28:42] Hallelujah you don't have to try and do
[2:28:45] anything it's not your own works you
[2:28:47] know this is what sanctification really
[2:28:49] became in the in these days because it
[2:28:51] was a partial understanding so he did an
[2:28:53] abstract title search right back through
[2:28:55] sanctification and gave us access to the
[2:28:58] very Grace that will change us and make
[2:29:02] us holy and give us the desires to
[2:29:05] please God Amen real sanctification true
[2:29:09] Holiness is not legalism true Holiness
[2:29:12] is search back so that we can connect to
[2:29:14] the blood we can connect to the very
[2:29:17] power the very will of God that is
[2:29:20] revealed in the blood of Jesus Christ to
[2:29:23] change you to really transform your life
[2:29:28] Hallelujah and he looked back at
[2:29:30] Pentecost amen performed an abstract
[2:29:32] search and said it didn't start in 1906
[2:29:34] Hallelujah it started in two Zer 33 ad
[2:29:39] whenever amen hallelujah searched it
[2:29:42] right back and said this is where you

[2:29:45] church not 1906 with tongues
[2:29:49] amen and your hearts by the abstract
[2:29:53] that was performed by the captain with
[2:29:54] his word and his title deed searched it

[2:31:02] hallelujah hallelujah sometimes you know
[2:31:04] our emotions get filtered through our
[2:31:06] stupid

[2:31:32] abstract Sears you right back to the
[2:31:35] original you the you that was in his

[2:31:58] abstract search amen the executor of the
[2:32:01] will through this title search all the
[2:32:03] claims of justification were cleared
[2:32:05] sanctification cleared Pentecost
[2:32:10] cleared Hallelujah they needed to be
[2:32:13] surrendered to the true
[2:32:14] captain and now the captain would
[2:32:16] completely remove Egypt out of Israel
[2:32:19] over the next 400 years hallelujah
[2:32:22] amen hallelujah that's taking us right
[2:32:25] through to the time of David for them
[2:32:27] you know they took them that long to
[2:32:28] inherit their
[2:32:31] land but that Captain never left them he
[2:32:34] stayed there the whole time he was with
[2:32:37] them the whole time you pul back when
[2:32:39] they went into their sodomite conditions
[2:32:41] and all of those things in the time of
[2:32:42] Judges but he was there and he was
[2:32:43] waiting and he wanted to deliver them he
[2:32:45] kept his side of the word he kept his
[2:32:48] bargain his side of the bargain or
[2:32:50] whatever you call it deal contract it's
[2:32:53] Israel that didn't keep
[2:32:54] theirs amen but there was always a
[2:32:57] testimony there was always a witness you
[2:32:59] see so Rahab when she got set free amen
[2:33:04] you know see her whole life was a
[2:33:06] certain way it was
[2:33:08] prostitution and some most of our Lives
[2:33:11] was spiritual prostitution
[2:33:14] amen all of our Lives spiritual
[2:33:16] prostitution you could say different
[2:33:18] varying factors
[2:33:20] when we were not born again and
[2:33:22] whatever you see but when the captain
[2:33:25] came the executor of the world the
[2:33:27] lawyer Amen to execute the will to
[2:33:31] execute and to perform the abstract
[2:33:33] title search to do some property law
[2:33:35] upon Israel upon Rahab Hallelujah you
[2:33:39] see Israel in their positions when they
[2:33:41] were in their positions they became the
[2:33:43] army of the Lord so that Rahab could be
[2:33:45] free so now we as the army of the Lord
[2:33:49] and our position
[2:33:51] got to set Rahab free there's many rabs
[2:33:53] out there
[2:33:56] amen I'll read this
[2:33:58] ver wait on the Lord and keep his way

[2:34:08] see it Hallelujah you will see it thank
[2:34:11] you Jesus but the wicked have to be cut
[2:34:15] off that shows that you can defeat Satan

[2:34:20] God will defeat Satan any place anywhere
[2:34:23] under any condition amen if it's in the
[2:34:25] belly of a whale or if it's in the
[2:34:27] Lion's then it's if it's on the bed with
[2:34:29] a cancer or if it's laying Yonder
[2:34:31] bleeding to death in an automobile
[2:34:34] accident the word of God will defeat
[2:34:36] Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian
[2:34:39] can use it it's your god-given privilege
[2:34:42] to do it
[2:34:45] hallelujah
[2:34:48] amen this is the last
[2:34:53] quote God can never get away from his
[2:34:55] commission I've failed him I've had here

[2:35:00] discernment around and around the world
[2:35:02] till tens of thousands of times a
[2:35:04] million cases I guess I ask you one
[2:35:07] thing did it ever fail no sir and if the
[2:35:10] signpost won't fail how much more will
[2:35:13] the commission never fail if the sign
[2:35:15] that's the minor part if the sign
[2:35:17] pointing to the city if doesn't fail to
[2:35:20] tell you the cities there you know going
[2:35:23] from cadis back over and giving the
[2:35:26] signs and he's got to take the people in
[2:35:28] all right so this is what he's talking
[2:35:29] about he's right at kades B this is this

[2:36:03] part of the sign pointing to the city if

[2:36:06] there how much more will the city be
[2:36:08] there when you come amen there's the
[2:36:10] commission now my Ministry is changing

[2:36:15] obviously so there will still be the
[2:36:17] discernment they will still carry on
[2:36:19] just as I feel that God wants me to sa
[2:36:21] them but until then I'll pray and lay
[2:36:23] hands on the sick as he told me to do
[2:36:25] and carry out my commission I've waited
[2:36:26] a long time for this but I believe now
[2:36:30] that we're ready to take the promised
[2:36:32] land and just as sure as there will be
[2:36:35] there will be some rahab's waiting amen
