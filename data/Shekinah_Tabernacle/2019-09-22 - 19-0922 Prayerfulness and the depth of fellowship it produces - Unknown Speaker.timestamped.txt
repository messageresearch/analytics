[53:19] first time to minister and church from
[53:22] Taranaki by the Elroy Robertson's church
[53:24] and I Monday expectation this morning
[53:29] once he's thanked rather been and sister
[53:32] sister Christine for the hospitality for
[53:36] the invitation to come we had a
[53:39] wonderful meal my brother Andy dominant
[53:42] me just appreciate and may never leave
[53:45] God where the harness is talent
[53:50] then we find spiritually after that to
[53:53] the early hours of this morning and yeah
[53:57] I just see that things we were speaking
[53:59] about is where the Lord will have us go
[54:02] this morning and so without further ado
[54:05] let's think our Bibles to Matthew 6 we
[54:09] want to look at verses 913 of Matthew 6
[54:12] I know that you are a well taught church
[54:15] you are establishing the word so I don't
[54:18] have to lay too much groundwork we go
[54:21] straight in you bring the word now if
[54:23] you don't understand all get the
[54:26] recording if you fall asleep get the
[54:27] recording and listen to it again that
[54:30] you might fully understand what it is
[54:32] that God is trying to wanting to achieve
[54:33] in our lives in this hour amen Matthew 6
[54:38] verse 9 to verse 13 jesus speaking after
[54:43] this manner therefore pray our Father
[54:49] which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[54:52] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[54:56] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[55:00] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[55:04] debts as we forgive our debtors and lead
[55:07] us not into temptation but deliver us
[55:11] from evil vine is the kingdom and the
[55:14] power and the glory forever amen Jesus
[55:18] giving the pattern of prayer for every
[55:20] true believer who has the Holy Ghost in
[55:23] its pretty one more time gracious father
[55:25] Lord I cannot stress enough the
[55:28] importance of this subject father the
[55:31] greatest weapon that you placed in the
[55:33] hands of your people was held to
[55:35] approach you and fellowship Oh God how
[55:38] to break through the veil of our own
[55:40] humanity and take position at every
[55:42] promise lays in the power of prayer
[55:44] father I pray Lord Jesus may you take
[55:47] the subject and so expound it to your
[55:49] people this morning Lord Jesus they
[55:52] would go forth
[55:54] with a more concentrated life to see the
[55:57] word that's been preached then made
[55:59] reality in their lives Lord Jesus this
[56:02] is where we are add father it's not for
[56:05] a shortage of word it's a lack of
[56:07] consecration Lord I pray Lord Jesus and
[56:10] not your word this morning keep us in
[56:12] the channel to pull on the word and meet
[56:14] each need I pray in your mighty name
[56:16] Amen god bless you all saints you may
[56:19] may take your seats
[56:25] praise the Lord
[56:28] Ray's gone like to speak this morning on
[56:33] prayerfulness and the depth of
[56:35] fellowship produces prayerfulness and
[56:39] the depth of fellowship that produces
[56:42] brother bin nice to see you again yeah
[56:46] yeah may God bless you this morning amen
[56:53] the greatest thing God gave the church
[56:58] was prayer the greatest weapon God
[57:02] placed in your hands the thing that the
[57:04] people do not know how to harness
[57:06] correctly is the secret to you breaking
[57:10] through every entrance in your life
[57:12] prayerfulness is the greatest weapon
[57:15] that God gave a man he gave a woman
[57:17] where he gave a child's when you look at
[57:20] your life saints of God you will see
[57:22] that God has brought you through many
[57:23] things but you find that you've come to
[57:26] a place in your life off then where
[57:28] there's no further progression or there
[57:31] is as wishful Ness of a day where you
[57:34] could have a Liberty a day where you
[57:36] could have possession of the promises
[57:38] that are preached meeting after meeting
[57:41] in the church but you never have
[57:44] possession of those things because the
[57:47] key laid and fellowship with God and
[57:50] that's the one thing we neglect the
[57:54] devil is not interested in the
[57:56] consistency of your church attendance
[57:59] nor is he interested in how many hours
[58:01] you read the scripture nor how many
[58:03] messages are the prophet you listen to
[58:06] that means nothing to the devil he's
[58:08] fine with that but when a man goes to
[58:10] prayer that is the greatest threat to
[58:13] the devil amen
[58:16] it is not how much of the word you know
[58:18] it's who you know that will make the
[58:21] difference for every single one of us
[58:25] prayerfulness this morning I want to
[58:27] show you about prayer and fasting by the
[58:30] word how you harness those things to
[58:35] break through the veil of God to take
[58:37] you through the veil of self and realize
[58:41] your sovereign potential and what I'm
[58:44] called to is not what your call to and
[58:46] vice versa you're all unique your own
[58:49] sovereign your lives are mapped out by
[58:52] God and this morning this is a key the
[58:55] devil don't want you to know I harness
[58:58] it this morning go first from this place
[59:01] - these things I speak these things from
[59:04] my own experience of my own life will
[59:07] you realize that no matter how much you
[59:09] love the things of God how much time you
[59:11] spin and the things of God you know if
[59:15] you are away from that fellowship that
[59:18] communion with God in their private
[59:20] place of that secret chamber if you're
[59:23] away from that you will only go so far
[59:26] with God the proper was asked 1964
[59:30] questions and answers how can a
[59:32] Christian get deeper in the love of God
[59:35] and in one line he says read the word
[59:38] and pray read the Word of God and pray
[59:43] and then he says I'm going to hurry just
[59:45] get as many as I can talking about the
[59:47] questions all it takes to get deeper in
[59:51] the love of God to fall into love with
[59:53] Jesus Christ is to read his word and
[59:56] talk to him about his word and from
[59:59] there all these other things will be
[1:00:02] added amen this is not going to fall
[1:00:06] that God to pray for a wife to pray for
[1:00:10] a home to pay for a pray for a pay
[1:00:13] increase
[1:00:14] this is going before God to commune with
[1:00:17] them on the basis of his word and on
[1:00:20] that basis with index is the wife and
[1:00:23] the pay rise and the home and every
[1:00:27] other thing that is lacking and needed
[1:00:30] lazed in that fellowship seek first the
[1:00:34] kingdom of God and all those other
[1:00:36] things are locked in the seeking of his
[1:00:38] kingdom amen my there are three things
[1:00:44] Jesus instructed us to do three things
[1:00:49] believe watch and pray belief watch and
[1:00:56] pray that's why this morning I'm not
[1:00:59] speaking about how well you know the
[1:01:01] word I'm talking about How well do you
[1:01:03] know him because if you know him he can
[1:01:06] reveal his word what is true revelation
[1:01:10] saints of God true revelation is
[1:01:14] relationship not a man who can sit down
[1:01:17] at the table and string together the
[1:01:20] mystery of the seven everything's with
[1:01:23] Scripture and quotation but still don't
[1:01:26] walk and overcoming life with Jesus
[1:01:28] Christ
[1:01:29] when a man knows his God who can take
[1:01:32] that word and make it effectual that is
[1:01:35] revelation until then it's still up here
[1:01:40] amen now in Matthew 6 Jesus is dealing
[1:01:45] with prayer and fasting and he's showing
[1:01:50] that both are connected in other words
[1:01:54] to have an effective prayer life fasting
[1:01:58] goes with it
[1:01:59] the two complement each other and the
[1:02:02] two are not optional these things are
[1:02:06] essential for the effectiveness of your
[1:02:09] walk in a flesh body because your flesh
[1:02:13] is not converted your flesh has a law of
[1:02:18] sin in it till the day the body is
[1:02:21] changed
[1:02:22] until then you will battle a man when
[1:02:26] you get the Holy Ghost your troubles do
[1:02:28] not end there your troubles begin amen
[1:02:32] when did Israel learn about about Emelec
[1:02:35] when they came out of Egypt Amalek was a
[1:02:39] grandson of Esau who was brother to
[1:02:41] Jacob the closest relation you have is
[1:02:45] Emelec who is the flesh and you did not
[1:02:48] know about the flesh when you were in
[1:02:50] the world
[1:02:50] because you were gratifying the
[1:02:52] sensuality of the flesh everything that
[1:02:55] was there you did not know about its
[1:02:56] power till the word came your way and
[1:02:59] called you to a separation and your
[1:03:01] first battle is with Emily amen and God
[1:03:06] said from generation to generation I
[1:03:09] will have war with Amalek who is the
[1:03:13] flesh therefore if you want to be
[1:03:17] effective in the warfare you need to be
[1:03:19] in fellowship with God and when did
[1:03:21] Amalek come to an end
[1:03:24] in the time of the book of Esther
[1:03:26] because emilich from him came a gag and
[1:03:35] from a guy came Heymann Haman is the
[1:03:38] last amela type recorded in the Bible
[1:03:41] and he was put to death by a woman when
[1:03:46] she came into a position as the Queen
[1:03:50] there was the execution of the humble
[1:03:53] last Amalekites the flesh was finally
[1:03:57] put into total subjection and until this
[1:04:01] body has changed you will have war with
[1:04:03] emilich amen amen so Lord make us
[1:04:08] effective in our warfare help us to
[1:04:11] believe a lord I believe that help down
[1:04:13] my unbelief Lord boost my faith you come
[1:04:16] this morning and you sit under the word
[1:04:18] to have your faith and a true faith is
[1:04:20] not given it's already there but it is
[1:04:23] increased as you sit under the word Amen
[1:04:27] believe watch and pray Jesus showing
[1:04:30] that both these things prayer and
[1:04:32] fasting with secret things of God these
[1:04:35] were not public things a man this is not
[1:04:38] for me to come this morning and tell you
[1:04:40] about how often I pray how often I fast
[1:04:43] how much time I spend in the word these
[1:04:45] are private things between you and God
[1:04:48] but nobody to know all that they see is
[1:04:51] a life manifesting Jesus Christ but what
[1:04:54] they don't see is the consecration
[1:04:56] behind the seniors amen
[1:05:00] and how were the disciples watching the
[1:05:03] fullness of the word who had the force
[1:05:05] of the Holy Ghost in prayer all the time
[1:05:09] Jesus was not born in sin but had a body
[1:05:12] like unto sin in order to experience
[1:05:15] what you experience in a flesh body and
[1:05:18] if Jesus had the fullness of the word
[1:05:21] and had the fullness of the Spirit and
[1:05:23] had to pray how much more is it required
[1:05:26] of you who does not have the fullness of
[1:05:29] the word and has a stately the spirit by
[1:05:32] measure how much more is it required of
[1:05:34] you to pray how much more is it required
[1:05:40] of us who only have it by measure when
[1:05:43] you are sitting under the word you are
[1:05:46] receiving more of the Holy Ghost annex
[1:05:49] to they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:51] but an X for they were refilled with the
[1:05:53] Holy Ghost
[1:05:54] when does the filling stop the fullness
[1:05:57] of the Holy Ghost for your body is not
[1:05:59] the livers glorified till then there is
[1:06:02] more of the Holy Ghost to be
[1:06:04] heads amen the Prophet said some of only
[1:06:08] got enough Spirit of God to stop them
[1:06:11] smoking enough to stop them drinking
[1:06:13] enough to get them out of bed push the
[1:06:15] accelerator and come to church that's
[1:06:17] all I've got
[1:06:18] but there's more Holy Ghost of your head
[1:06:21] to take what you receive in the church
[1:06:23] and make it effectual in the workplace
[1:06:25] effectual in the home picture on the
[1:06:28] streets of Satan's Eden there's more
[1:06:30] spirit to be handed amen Lord make us a
[1:06:36] prayerful people amen until you have
[1:06:41] that friend you will only go so far in
[1:06:43] your walk you can come to every
[1:06:46] convention come to every altar call pour
[1:06:48] out tears on the ground but until there
[1:06:51] is that consecrated life behind the
[1:06:53] scenes between you and God
[1:06:54] you will keep coming up the front for
[1:06:56] the same thing yeah after year when I
[1:07:00] see it I see how watched it and we see
[1:07:04] it because there's a lack of teaching
[1:07:06] amen Jesus he is showing the location of
[1:07:12] Prayer the position of Prayer and he
[1:07:17] gives you the pattern of Prayer right he
[1:07:20] shows you the place the position and how
[1:07:26] to pray now think about this there is a
[1:07:30] time when we play pray as a church there
[1:07:32] right yeah there's a time we pray as
[1:07:34] brothers
[1:07:35] there's a time we pray as a family but
[1:07:38] then what Jesus is talking about is
[1:07:40] private one-on-one prayer alone from all
[1:07:44] distraction where you can stay there if
[1:07:47] you wish for hours in the presence of
[1:07:49] God this is the prayer life that I'm
[1:07:51] talking about this morning I'm not
[1:07:52] talking about a brother's prayer meeting
[1:07:54] I'm not talking about praying as a
[1:07:55] church or a family I'm talking about
[1:07:57] private prayer one-on-one
[1:08:00] well you pour out all things to him
[1:08:02] that's what I'm talking about this
[1:08:03] morning amen and this is what I want you
[1:08:07] to understand so I want you to Nancy
[1:08:10] it's powerful
[1:08:12] Jesus says you go into the closet to
[1:08:15] pray the closet is the bedchamber in
[1:08:18] other words the private place whether
[1:08:20] that's where ever you want to go like
[1:08:22] the Prophet went to that cave in
[1:08:24] Greensville Indiana and in prayer the
[1:08:26] angel came let me tell you if an angel
[1:08:29] is appeared in these last days he's
[1:08:32] appeared on an age level but he has yet
[1:08:35] to appear for some on an individual
[1:08:38] level and until you are there at your
[1:08:42] altar of incense you'll never make the
[1:08:45] angel he must appear personally that is
[1:08:51] how the angel comes when you get alone
[1:08:55] with God he will draw near when you when
[1:08:57] we worship God this morning as a body of
[1:09:00] the lever stirs to do what was to bring
[1:09:02] the Holy Spirit down right to bring the
[1:09:05] angel down for the word to come forth
[1:09:08] this is why there's a responsibility of
[1:09:11] the song leader in the way that the
[1:09:15] songs are sung the songs are about the
[1:09:18] word that's unfolding in this age the
[1:09:20] musicians have responsibilities before
[1:09:22] the song leader steps up to create the
[1:09:24] atmosphere that will set the whole path
[1:09:26] of the service every office every
[1:09:31] position and the church must understand
[1:09:33] its calling but for lack of teaching
[1:09:35] people hindering the church because they
[1:09:41] are not understanding what their calling
[1:09:43] encompasses Jesus showed go to a private
[1:09:49] place wherever there is in the bedroom
[1:09:52] in a cave wherever you go to get alone
[1:09:54] with God
[1:09:55] go somewhere and then he shows you the
[1:09:59] position of Prayer who said that you had
[1:10:01] to be on your knees jesus said when you
[1:10:05] stand praying who said you had to be on
[1:10:07] your knees who says that you have to
[1:10:10] stand who said that who made these
[1:10:17] traditions on how you pray when they're
[1:10:20] not even in the word you can kneel and
[1:10:24] pray you can stand and pray I fell on
[1:10:26] face it prey can sit and pray you can
[1:10:28] drive and pray wherever you are walk and
[1:10:31] pray who said that it has to be this way
[1:10:35] who said you have to do this who said
[1:10:37] that men made that up the link we have
[1:10:49] to God is not subject to traditions of
[1:10:51] men message of the hour did not come to
[1:10:54] establish a firm tradition yeah take the
[1:10:56] great tradition and restore the way God
[1:10:58] appointed for things to be done that's
[1:11:03] why we do not live under the law that's
[1:11:04] why the word gives you Liberty because
[1:11:07] it's breaking a formalistic 2,000 years
[1:11:10] of false teaching yeah because it's so
[1:11:14] engrained in the subconscious I must do
[1:11:16] things this way in this way and now
[1:11:18] serving God as a Chow must under
[1:11:22] enjoyable experience for many is coming
[1:11:25] to church and serving God what Paul
[1:11:28] hated Maya was sharing this with the
[1:11:30] church the other day Paul hated that
[1:11:32] Jesus he knew because he was persecuting
[1:11:35] the church he had in his mind who Jesus
[1:11:38] was and he hated that Jesus so much he
[1:11:41] went to lock up the followers of this
[1:11:46] Jesus but what did Paul need he need to
[1:11:49] meet Jesus without the mask and who did
[1:11:53] he meet not a man wearing sandals in a
[1:11:56] robe he met the pillar of fire Jesus
[1:11:59] without the mass and I Charlie when he
[1:12:03] met the real Jesus without the mask now
[1:12:05] he has changed from a persecutor to the
[1:12:09] Apostle and prophet of the age let me
[1:12:12] say this to you young people this
[1:12:14] morning if you don't enjoy coming to
[1:12:16] church well or anything that relates to
[1:12:18] the things of God all you need is to
[1:12:20] meet Jesus without the mass you need to
[1:12:23] meet him outside of how you think of
[1:12:26] though he is because when you meet them
[1:12:29] in that form I tell you will change you
[1:12:33] we're good
[1:12:36] in it Lord Jesus be more to me than what
[1:12:41] these ones talk about what the
[1:12:43] denominations present a mess you must be
[1:12:45] real I must meet you I'm not satisfied
[1:12:47] with the testimony of what Paul hen or
[1:12:50] what the Prophet had or what brother Ben
[1:12:52] will brother Andy or others at had but
[1:12:54] Lord I must meet you I must have my own
[1:12:57] experience amen
[1:13:02] watch this in Luke 3 Jesus was baptized
[1:13:06] as they're right he was not baptized for
[1:13:08] repentance he was baptized because as
[1:13:10] the sacrifice he had to be washed but
[1:13:12] when he went to the waters of baptism
[1:13:14] the Bible said they have an open and the
[1:13:16] Spirit of God descended in the form of a
[1:13:18] dove and when he was baptized the Bible
[1:13:21] says when heaven open he was praying
[1:13:24] Luke 3 verse 21 Jesus when he was
[1:13:26] praying the Holy Ghost came down then
[1:13:31] when he was adopted and Luke 9 when he
[1:13:37] was transfigured his adoption he was
[1:13:39] praying when that took place at his
[1:13:43] baptism when the fullness of the Holy
[1:13:46] Ghost came down he was praying at his
[1:13:50] adoption which is spiritual maturity he
[1:13:54] was praying now think of that when you
[1:13:58] receive the Holy Ghost that is the start
[1:14:00] of your spiritual journey that's why
[1:14:02] it's called the new birth you are a
[1:14:04] spiritual baby who makes a ton of
[1:14:06] mistakes babies do not get things right
[1:14:08] do they they are not mature children
[1:14:12] they're not mature they are babies they
[1:14:15] they say the wrong thing act up the
[1:14:17] wrong way but because they are born they
[1:14:20] have a life they are still a sunless to
[1:14:23] the daughter so when you receive the
[1:14:25] Holy Ghost you'll not mature you're only
[1:14:27] a baby still rank in the things of the
[1:14:29] world you're on a journey to spiritual
[1:14:33] maturity amen
[1:14:35] that's why you need more of the Holy
[1:14:37] Ghost to bring you more and more into
[1:14:39] the image of your heavenly Father
[1:14:42] and therefore if Jesus at the time of
[1:14:45] baptism when he received the Holy Ghost
[1:14:47] and its fullness that's the paradox of
[1:14:49] the Godhead he was born by the Holy
[1:14:51] Ghost beget his food with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:52] and his baptism that's why it was a
[1:14:55] great mystery for the H if he who had
[1:14:59] the spirit without measure prayed at the
[1:15:01] time of baptism how much more will it
[1:15:03] take prayer from the time you received
[1:15:05] the Holy Ghost to your adoption all the
[1:15:09] way from the rebirth to full maturity
[1:15:11] must be a strong fellowship with God all
[1:15:14] the way all the way and Jesus also as a
[1:15:18] ministry did nothing except what the
[1:15:21] father showed him and how did the father
[1:15:24] show him all things because there was a
[1:15:26] communion a link established in order
[1:15:29] for the father to reveal his will to the
[1:15:32] son and now why often can't we find the
[1:15:37] will of God for our lives to know what
[1:15:39] to do what to speak when to step back
[1:15:43] when to rebuke when to encourage why are
[1:15:46] these things lacking because that
[1:15:48] communion is not there for the father to
[1:15:50] show you when to go about this your
[1:15:59] growth from spiritual infancy to
[1:16:00] spiritual maturity is all based on
[1:16:02] prayer fellowship with God prayerfulness
[1:16:05] I tell you you see people that will take
[1:16:08] drugs to try and settle their nerves all
[1:16:11] kinds of medicines with you see people
[1:16:13] smoking cigarettes to remove the shakes
[1:16:16] there is a nothing that will settle you
[1:16:18] like prayer will when you get beyond the
[1:16:20] tiredness and thinking about the fishing
[1:16:23] trip and all the distractions that
[1:16:24] surround you and you pray through that
[1:16:27] barrier to God comes down there's
[1:16:30] nothing that will settle you like that
[1:16:32] if you've been in that place I tell you
[1:16:34] there's nothing that can put you in an
[1:16:36] atmosphere like that
[1:16:38] amen Jesus wasn't prayer and Luke 11 and
[1:16:42] Hera his disciples watching him pray and
[1:16:45] they are struck by how this man can
[1:16:48] access God and they say to him Lord
[1:16:50] teach us how to pray
[1:16:53] but all those disciples were already
[1:16:55] praying people because all through the
[1:16:58] Old Testament that Torah that they knew
[1:17:00] so well it was read to them it's filled
[1:17:03] with the prayers of the Saints now here
[1:17:05] they are seeing a man praying like no
[1:17:08] man prayed and they say Lord teach us
[1:17:12] because when you pray you access the
[1:17:14] father every time you are a man when you
[1:17:17] walk the word is on display the word is
[1:17:19] effective when we don't have what you
[1:17:22] have
[1:17:22] teach us how to commune like you can so
[1:17:26] we can have the life that you do have oh
[1:17:28] my
[1:17:29] so Jesus sing that's teaches them how to
[1:17:33] pray why am i and my all that Jesus
[1:17:42] accomplished was by fellowship with the
[1:17:44] father now watch what the prophets in
[1:17:46] realized the Prophet was God to the aged
[1:17:48] Moses was God to the people and brother
[1:17:51] Branham though he was a prophet he was a
[1:17:53] son of man he was God to the aged
[1:17:55] because God was in their vessel but the
[1:17:58] Prophet is off the scene but the word
[1:18:00] never left the earth and the word is
[1:18:02] Jesus Christ and the word is now in a
[1:18:05] body of believers
[1:18:07] therefore where is God that's heresy to
[1:18:12] those not trained in the word but you
[1:18:14] are God to the age and the people
[1:18:17] stumble at it because of the humanity
[1:18:19] paths but the sole part fish part and
[1:18:25] the spirit part backslides and
[1:18:28] disappoints Bailey
[1:18:30] but the soul part is completely glorify
[1:18:33] so parties where God is that's what
[1:18:37] stumbles of people how can there be God
[1:18:39] in this vessel who sometimes explodes
[1:18:42] and says the wrong thing it does the
[1:18:44] wrong thing how can God be a net by God
[1:18:49] is in there and when your eyes are
[1:18:51] inching you by the word you see God in
[1:18:54] there when you look at your brothers and
[1:18:56] your sisters you see God in them you
[1:18:58] gonna be on that surface of 80 cents
[1:19:00] worth of New Zealand dust South African
[1:19:03] dust wherever you're from African dust
[1:19:04] and you lookin you see the soul paths
[1:19:07] when God is looking at you this morning
[1:19:09] he's looking at your soul that's why he
[1:19:12] says you're perfect now when we look at
[1:19:16] one another we want to start looking
[1:19:17] beyond the skin and look into the soul
[1:19:20] we can look my brother's my sisters sure
[1:19:24] they have these other things but I have
[1:19:26] things to a man praise the Lord and the
[1:19:29] Prophet said in fellowship with God
[1:19:31] through reconciliation 1956 and this
[1:19:34] meeting I have thought of doing this
[1:19:36] many people has watched my life in the
[1:19:38] healing campaign how that the things
[1:19:40] would take place and the prophetic gifts
[1:19:42] and so forth I would just like to tell
[1:19:45] you how that's done
[1:19:46] my this is there was no man with a
[1:19:49] supernatural ministry or prophet and
[1:19:52] people were watching that I wanted to
[1:19:53] know how it's done and he said I'll tell
[1:19:55] you how it's done
[1:19:56] BET's done through fellowship with Jesus
[1:19:58] Christ no other way no other plan no
[1:20:03] trick to it just simply praying
[1:20:05] fellowship taking God at His Word what
[1:20:10] he said was truth believing it that just
[1:20:12] settles it then
[1:20:13] talk to him love him and thank him for
[1:20:16] it and that does it why do you have a
[1:20:20] powerless unfulfilled life because
[1:20:23] you're not in that fellowship with Jesus
[1:20:25] Christ like where you should be that's
[1:20:29] why you get out of bed in the morning
[1:20:30] you drag your feet to work and you can't
[1:20:33] stand for him witness about them
[1:20:35] minister to the needs pray for the sick
[1:20:38] live a full life of Jesus Christ because
[1:20:41] there's a lack of fellowship that don't
[1:20:42] quicken your faith
[1:20:44] to walk into those things that is why
[1:20:47] you live way below God ordained
[1:20:50] privileges
[1:20:52] amen amen
[1:20:55] maybe you just get sick of just coming
[1:20:57] to church or just going to conventions
[1:21:00] of just sitting with believers and
[1:21:03] talking about the things of God don't
[1:21:05] you want to go further than that
[1:21:06] haven't you got more land than that well
[1:21:10] Lord raised my faith
[1:21:11] let me tell your friends if you were
[1:21:13] having to settle your racing heart beat
[1:21:15] and wipe off the beads of sweat on your
[1:21:18] face before you can do something for God
[1:21:20] you're not there yet because when Jesus
[1:21:23] moved he was come man in u.s. position
[1:21:25] go and speak you win him speaks but God
[1:21:28] brings you their place just go and do
[1:21:30] the word you're not ashamed it's
[1:21:32] something you're shy it's you're ashamed
[1:21:34] that it's subconscious fear the greatest
[1:21:37] curse was fear the greatest enemy was
[1:21:40] yourself the greatest battle is the mind
[1:21:42] the three great things are all in this
[1:21:44] flesh body and need to be dealt to
[1:21:47] through fellowship with Jesus Christ
[1:21:50] Jesus gave the pattern of Prayer and the
[1:21:53] pattern of prayer is for those who have
[1:21:55] the Holy Ghost only those who are born
[1:21:58] again not for people in the
[1:22:00] denominational world the only people who
[1:22:03] can pray correctly of those who have the
[1:22:05] Holy Ghost
[1:22:06] now watch the pattern that Jesus gave
[1:22:08] and you will see why you need the Holy
[1:22:10] Ghost why you need our Father oh this is
[1:22:17] how we pray you know how we pray is not
[1:22:19] our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be
[1:22:21] then that's the pattern yeah that's the
[1:22:25] pets a blueprint on how you pray that's
[1:22:28] not how you pray right this is how you
[1:22:31] pray our Father you acknowledge his
[1:22:35] Godhead but how can you acknowledge his
[1:22:38] Godhead except you have a prophet to
[1:22:41] reveal the mystery of God first if
[1:22:46] there's no prophet whose message was to
[1:22:49] reveal the mystery of God how can you
[1:22:51] say our Father and if you see that he is
[1:22:55] your father you must see that you are
[1:22:57] son cuz he cannot be a father less you
[1:23:00] are a son right the Prophet said he says
[1:23:06] there's no eternal son before they
[1:23:09] cannot be an eternal father because he's
[1:23:11] not a father to the other son about it I
[1:23:17] know you're thinking on that one asked
[1:23:20] me afterwards our Father you must
[1:23:24] acknowledge his Godhead you must see who
[1:23:30] he is that's why you need a prophet the
[1:23:35] mystery of God came by a prophet then
[1:23:38] you see who you are sons and daughters
[1:23:41] when we start talking about when you
[1:23:43] know who he is then you know who you are
[1:23:45] we talk about we want we know who we are
[1:23:47] but do you know who God is because
[1:23:49] unless you know God as you don't know
[1:23:51] who you are but when you know who God is
[1:23:53] you know you are a son amen our Father
[1:23:56] you acknowledge his greatness his
[1:24:00] awesomeness you don't rip into prayer
[1:24:03] with all your list of demands that
[1:24:06] shallow top it's a man don't know how to
[1:24:09] approach his father you go before the
[1:24:11] Lord in that private prayer and you
[1:24:13] start thanking him praising him
[1:24:16] worshiping him our Father give him glory
[1:24:20] for all that he's done he wants to hear
[1:24:24] that then he'll come down hallelujah
[1:24:29] that's how you pray which art in heaven
[1:24:32] all you need to know not just who he is
[1:24:35] but where is he at he's in heaven where
[1:24:39] is heaven I said that Bros in Pakistan I
[1:24:42] said brother zekiel lives in Pakistan
[1:24:44] where is Pakistan if I gave you a blank
[1:24:47] map of the world where no borders that
[1:24:48] define on the map point to me where
[1:24:51] Pakistan is an and for the average
[1:24:53] European definitely for other races they
[1:24:57] will not be able to find where
[1:24:59] Pakistanis you see we know that God is
[1:25:03] in heaven nominations no he's in heaven
[1:25:07] problem is they don't know we have news
[1:25:09] yeah see the prophesied heaven consists
[1:25:14] of the wood yeah heaven consists of the
[1:25:17] word therefore the whereabouts of God is
[1:25:21] in his word heaven is a faith
[1:25:23] civilization and the faith is the
[1:25:27] revelation of the word that makes an
[1:25:29] economy function so therefore God our
[1:25:33] Father is in his word and his approach
[1:25:37] on the basis of his word his approach on
[1:25:44] the basis of his word then therefore you
[1:25:48] need to be taught the word to know how
[1:25:49] to approach this God this father that
[1:25:51] you have when they discredit the
[1:25:55] prophets and everything that he said
[1:25:59] this man who had the keys to unlock the
[1:26:01] whole Bible when you throw that away
[1:26:03] how can you access God how can you know
[1:26:06] how to approach him
[1:26:07] how could he responded cannot because
[1:26:10] you must pray on the basis of the word
[1:26:12] that's revealed yeah amen
[1:26:15] he says hallowed be thy name this is a
[1:26:19] God who is a holy God a God of sanctity
[1:26:22] a God of standards a God of Maros a God
[1:26:26] of righteousness that's the God that we
[1:26:29] serve and his sons and daughters are
[1:26:33] bearers of his name
[1:26:35] you are bearers of his name when Jesus
[1:26:40] said when God said when he gave those
[1:26:42] Commandments those ten commandments one
[1:26:44] of them was thou shalt not take the name
[1:26:46] of the LORD thy God and then the taking
[1:26:48] of it the name of the Lord in vain is
[1:26:50] not when you curse because this is given
[1:26:53] away before any of that this is when you
[1:26:55] claim to be something but you're not
[1:26:59] you are bearing his name in vain and
[1:27:04] this is why the denominational world all
[1:27:08] claim that Christ is their husband that
[1:27:12] they say they are married to him but all
[1:27:15] the children they are producing don't
[1:27:17] look like him
[1:27:18] meaning they've been with somebody else
[1:27:21] they are bearing his name in vain that
[1:27:23] is why they are called harlots because
[1:27:25] they claim they are married to him but
[1:27:27] the children they are bringing forth to
[1:27:29] not bear the characteristics of Jesus
[1:27:31] Christ their father been in folks Union
[1:27:36] Amen you get up from under this word you
[1:27:39] are straight and folks Union because if
[1:27:42] you're not married to him he says have
[1:27:44] no other god but me cuz I'll have no
[1:27:46] other wife by you he's gonna have no
[1:27:48] other wife but you so have no other God
[1:27:51] but him and if you find that you are
[1:27:53] deadly and anything that puts God second
[1:27:56] you're in folks union you're in
[1:27:58] fornication Amen so let the word dropper
[1:28:02] and must praise the Lord there is a
[1:28:06] sanctity required of us so a bearers of
[1:28:08] his name the Bible says Jesus says thy
[1:28:11] will be done in as it is in heaven
[1:28:14] and in other words to know the will of
[1:28:16] God not for this earth but for this you
[1:28:22] first have to see it in heaven to know
[1:28:25] the will of God for your life you must
[1:28:27] see it first in heaven for Moses to
[1:28:29] build a tabernacle on the earth you had
[1:28:31] to see the pattern first in heaven and
[1:28:33] when you come to church the will of God
[1:28:36] is preached the pattern in heaven is

[1:32:01] into God hallelujah
[1:32:04] my my my Jesus isn't mac-11
[1:32:06] therefore I say unto you what things

[1:32:18] have them you need healing believe
[1:32:20] you've got it right now and you'll get
[1:32:22] hey man my my my and in a Matthew 18
[1:32:28] Jesus gave the parable of the great Lord
[1:32:30] who had a servant who owed a great debt
[1:32:33] of ten thousand talents and he called
[1:32:37] his servant and he says pay me what you
[1:32:39] owe
[1:32:39] ten thousand telling us and the man says
[1:32:43] I can't pain I don't have I don't have
[1:32:45] it and the Lord said well gods look him
[1:32:49] up sell his wife and children make them
[1:32:52] bun slaves till this man pays his debt
[1:32:55] and that servant fell at the feet of his
[1:32:58] Lord says Lord and mercy with me have
[1:33:00] patience with me I'll pay you all and
[1:33:02] the Lord was so moved by that they're
[1:33:06] genuine plea of the servant he forgave
[1:33:08] him a great debt but that one who was
[1:33:11] forgiven a great bits had a fellow
[1:33:13] servant who owed him a hundred pence
[1:33:16] repents and he
[1:33:18] his brother and he says pay me what you
[1:33:20] owe me yeah and he could not he said
[1:33:23] look I don't have 100 pills I got
[1:33:24] nothing I paid the electricity and put
[1:33:27] feeling the car and got the groceries
[1:33:29] were nothing there were nothing more it
[1:33:30] says well ramen in the prison yeah
[1:33:35] this man forgot what his Lord had just
[1:33:38] done for him
[1:33:40] forgave him a great debt he cannot
[1:33:42] forgive a brother from a minor debt and
[1:33:45] so this this 100 pence was given over to
[1:33:50] the tormentas was put in prison was
[1:33:51] locked up but he should pay and word got
[1:33:54] back to the Lord Himself of what had
[1:33:57] taken place and that servant was now
[1:33:59] called to stand before the Lord and give
[1:34:01] an account for what he had done and the
[1:34:03] Lord said I forgave you a great debts
[1:34:04] and you can't even forgive your brother
[1:34:07] are minor debts and now I'm gonna turn
[1:34:10] you over to the tormentors well you
[1:34:11] should pay what you owe now think about
[1:34:14] that
[1:34:14] our Lord forgave us a great dish I sin
[1:34:19] that you could not pay with your own
[1:34:21] blood amen and he himself paid your debt
[1:34:26] on Calvary 2,000 years ago and yet we
[1:34:30] look at our brothers and sisters who do
[1:34:32] minor things against us and for 15 20 25
[1:34:35] years we still hold it against them to
[1:34:38] the stake and wonder why we cannot tap
[1:34:41] into the things of God because of
[1:34:43] unforgiveness fellowship with God is
[1:34:49] based and that's why you need to get
[1:34:53] before God and when you've finished all
[1:34:55] your talking wait before God and wait
[1:34:58] till he can come down and start showing
[1:35:01] you this brother this sister you need to
[1:35:05] go and see you need to make that right
[1:35:07] don't just tell me about it we need to
[1:35:10] go to them and if you can't do that you
[1:35:13] say Lord I know but I can't do it now
[1:35:16] Lord strengthen me yeah help me to
[1:35:19] humble myself to do this what is very
[1:35:22] awkward for me to make a race the
[1:35:24] expense of my reputation the expense of
[1:35:27] how I will be seen if I do it help me
[1:35:29] Lord
[1:35:30] that I might have a greater Bella shoot
[1:35:33] a deeper walk where these the
[1:35:37] supernatural can be seen in my life
[1:35:40] bring me to that place hallelujah praise
[1:35:44] alone in the Great Commission 1958 one
[1:35:48] of the great quotes of prophecies he
[1:35:50] says if I have found grace in your sight
[1:35:52] through God you take my word for this
[1:35:53] brethren if you want to be a blessing
[1:35:55] and get a blessing when a man has done
[1:35:57] you wrong and he is absolutely justly I
[1:36:00] mean he has done you wrong in other
[1:36:03] words he has really done you wrong and
[1:36:06] you know that he's done you wrong he's
[1:36:08] done you evil don't mention that oh I
[1:36:11] tell you we are designed by a nature
[1:36:13] where we can sit for three hours and
[1:36:15] talk about the folks of one another and
[1:36:17] my five minutes of talking about any
[1:36:19] good that's just boring it's an
[1:36:20] interesting that's not worth sharing
[1:36:22] with others but the bad my we can feed
[1:36:25] on it we love it we're good at it we are
[1:36:28] designed in a student body to do that
[1:36:31] and here he says don't tell nobody about
[1:36:33] it because in this life when you receive
[1:36:35] the Holy Ghost it's the word man on the
[1:36:37] inside
[1:36:38] that is controlling you you're not
[1:36:41] controlled by flesh you have to be
[1:36:42] controlled by the word just tell no man
[1:36:44] don't mention that you take him to
[1:36:47] prayer before God now amen and don't
[1:36:49] take it in a way of just a selfish and
[1:36:51] say well I'm supposed to do this but
[1:36:54] stand with your shoulder to his short
[1:36:56] and stand in the presence of God our
[1:36:58] Father where prayer should be made in
[1:37:01] the presence of God say father here's my
[1:37:03] brother and he deserves punishment
[1:37:07] because he's done me evil and I don't
[1:37:09] see why he did it then let God go to
[1:37:12] talking to you and you'll see maybe what
[1:37:15] that man's been through the devil has
[1:37:19] twisted him up somewhere and caused him
[1:37:21] to do that though he's absolutely wrong
[1:37:25] before you leave the throne of God
[1:37:28] you'll be feeling sorry for that
[1:37:30] oh my you'll be sympathizing with that
[1:37:34] brother and when you get back down to
[1:37:36] where earth when you get back down to
[1:37:38] earth again you'll go over to that
[1:37:41] brother and shake his hand cuz you know
[1:37:43] what he's been through
[1:37:45] my you can't stand with a mortal in the
[1:37:49] presence of God and condemn anybody I
[1:37:52] don't believe in no sir even if he is a
[1:37:54] ranked sinner my how do we forgive our
[1:37:59] knees where ever before God to him to
[1:38:02] show you what we've been through that we
[1:38:06] can truly forgive amen that's why before
[1:38:10] we take the communion the bread and the
[1:38:12] wine that ordinance we were instructed
[1:38:14] to partake of first if any man assault
[1:38:17] against his brother let him make it
[1:38:19] right because it's communion fellowship
[1:38:23] why is there many who are sickly and
[1:38:26] weak and many sleep among you because of
[1:38:29] a lack of forgiveness
[1:38:32] why is sickness in the church why
[1:38:34] sickness in people's lives why is it
[1:38:37] things that stay there year after year
[1:38:38] why because of a lack of forgiveness
[1:38:42] people who cannot let go that's why
[1:38:45] people stay in these conditions that's
[1:38:49] why the church is often handed one man a
[1:38:51] cannon took some silver and a gold a
[1:38:55] golden wedge in Babylonian garments and
[1:38:57] all these things one man and the church
[1:38:59] sauce 36 men died one man brought about
[1:39:03] the death of 36 innocent men producing a
[1:39:06] whole bunch of families of widows
[1:39:08] because of one man's sin in the church
[1:39:10] and when they came back to the pasture
[1:39:13] when it came back to a Holy Ghost full
[1:39:14] man he realized there's sin in the camp
[1:39:16] when I'm looking at amongst a body of
[1:39:18] believers and I see we are stagnating we
[1:39:21] realize there's something in the camp
[1:39:24] that needs to be rooted out needs to be
[1:39:26] identified that a church can move on to
[1:39:29] greater victory when they went to AI
[1:39:32] they were to take the city with no
[1:39:34] deaths on their sign and Joshua as far
[1:39:38] as he was concerned was a great disgrace
[1:39:40] and utter defeat to the kemberly
[1:39:42] the 36 mentioned I was not this was not
[1:39:46] to be God has called you to victories at
[1:39:49] the expense of mental life of many men
[1:39:51] churches a body walks on immunity takes
[1:39:55] position when we attended his sin under
[1:39:58] Kemp is unbelief in the kit forgiveness
[1:40:05] prayer takes you into the throne room of
[1:40:06] God in that place in that presence you
[1:40:08] can only forgive that's why I tell you
[1:40:10] when we're talking about private prayer
[1:40:12] not talking about praying as a family
[1:40:14] and all these things they have their
[1:40:15] place we're talking when you get alone
[1:40:16] with God yeah because that is the
[1:40:18] greatest form of Prayer just you and him
[1:40:20] then I'll be transitioned to the family
[1:40:22] and the church and the brothers and so
[1:40:23] forth but this is the greatest place to
[1:40:26] be and in that place you go beyond the
[1:40:30] tiredness when you come to church go
[1:40:33] beyond the timeless go beyond thinking
[1:40:35] about the lunch
[1:40:36] it's a Shelly what are you here for with
[1:40:40] feeding a word man the word man there's
[1:40:41] often neglected between Sunday and
[1:40:43] Wednesday and Wednesday and Sunday that
[1:40:45] par that's neglected that's what we're
[1:40:47] here to feed this morning amen all right
[1:40:52] you go beyond that still God comes down
[1:40:56] and that's where time don't matter in
[1:40:58] the presence of God you make time
[1:41:00] subject to eternity eternity was before
[1:41:03] time time came because of the fall let
[1:41:06] me tell you this I said this to the
[1:41:08] church back home I preached the same
[1:41:10] thought 24 hours have not changed in
[1:41:15] 6,000 years you think time Speer that
[1:41:19] time does not spit up time never spit up
[1:41:21] that hours full of 60 minutes yeah yeah
[1:41:27] 3,600 seconds hasn't changed because you
[1:41:31] have become so busy you feel if I'm
[1:41:33] speeding up you allowed Satan the camera
[1:41:36] to place the minds that you felt were of
[1:41:38] an important tool to your life and the
[1:41:40] first thing you did was push God to the
[1:41:42] background that's why you've got no time
[1:41:44] you got
[1:41:44] Yury engineered your life to accommodate
[1:41:47] the devil that's why you've got no time
[1:41:49] you're more concern about your pay and
[1:41:52] your keeping your car and having all
[1:41:53] these things to look the parts then what
[1:41:56] you are concerned about the things of
[1:41:57] God that's why you have no time I'll
[1:42:00] show you that proper talking about
[1:42:02] Martin Luther the more he had to do and
[1:42:08] he felt like everything else he got done
[1:42:11] why because you put seek first the
[1:42:14] kingdom of God and all the other things
[1:42:17] that Adams you seen that have you
[1:42:19] actually seen that in your life you go
[1:42:21] before God and you're given your time
[1:42:23] you go to work and things fall into
[1:42:25] place unusually fall into place just
[1:42:29] doesn't normally happen that way until
[1:42:31] you start putting him really fast my cuz
[1:42:35] God honors his word you mean we have to
[1:42:40] accommodate God man if you accommodate
[1:42:42] God that's what God will do you want to
[1:42:46] accommodate the devil who does nothing
[1:42:47] for you all you get is more letters with
[1:42:50] windows in them when you accommodate the
[1:42:52] devil that's all you get all these
[1:42:57] things you have to pay all these bills
[1:42:58] all these things that's all you get when
[1:43:00] you accommodate the bill yeah but when
[1:43:03] you come and they God the one who
[1:43:06] provides the healing provides the peace
[1:43:08] provides the sleep that you need you
[1:43:10] mean if I if I go before the Lord and
[1:43:12] make some time to pray before I go to
[1:43:14] bed and it's already laid the morning
[1:43:16] wore out but if you don't and you go to
[1:43:18] bed all you're gonna do is cost and turn
[1:43:20] on my anyway
[1:43:21] but imagine if you just able more things
[1:43:23] went to bed and watch how that in ten
[1:43:25] minutes it's like eight hours worth of
[1:43:27] sleep I think God is limited that's
[1:43:34] right Lord opened our eyes to see how we
[1:43:40] are to live our lives amen
[1:43:45] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:43:49] deliver us from evil what is prayer to
[1:43:52] find the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:55] lead us Lord because he the Holy Ghost
[1:43:57] said in Revelation 3:10 because thou has
[1:44:00] kept the word of my patience
[1:44:02] I will also keep thee from the hour of
[1:44:04] temptation lead us not into temptation
[1:44:07] by keeping the word of my patience I
[1:44:10] will keep you from the hour of my the
[1:44:14] Holy Spirit is speaking my Hosie

[1:44:28] being tempted but the only ones have
[1:44:30] been cats are those in fellowship with
[1:44:33] God hallelujah why do you see pivot
[1:44:36] conventions don't messed up in the world
[1:44:38] they're not being kept from the hour of
[1:44:40] temptation because they have not yet to
[1:44:43] meet the unmasked God and receive them
[1:44:48] in their lives
[1:44:49] hallelujah temptation is a path to evil
[1:44:52] but the Holy spirt will keep you on the
[1:44:54] right path keep us on the right path
[1:44:56] you're going astray this morning all you
[1:44:58] gotta do is go before the Lord make it

[1:45:14] takes
[1:45:15] hallelujah amen for vine the Lord says
[1:45:20] as he finishes his prayer for thine is
[1:45:22] the kingdom and the power and the glory

[1:45:28] kingdom on the earth on this earth but
[1:45:31] first he will set it up in you a man

[1:45:36] he will first establish his kingdom in
[1:45:38] here amen the kingdom of heaven is
[1:45:41] likened unto a man by then he talks
[1:45:44] about all these parables about men he
[1:45:47] sets up his parable and his kingdom in
[1:45:49] your life God alone has the power to
[1:45:52] achieve his will his word for your life

[1:46:27] last 30 years but Lord you come into
[1:46:30] this day and bring change what do you
[1:46:33] think it means to serve God does it mean
[1:46:35] when you're standing behind a pulpit
[1:46:37] you're serving God when you run a DVD
[1:46:39] being watched by another church that
[1:46:41] you're serving Ghana that's what people
[1:46:43] think it means to serve God when that
[1:46:45] when they're doing something in the
[1:46:46] church and say it's when you step out of
[1:46:48] bed in the morning say Lord here am I
[1:46:50] leave me by your spirit and God will
[1:46:51] bring you into contact with every person
[1:46:53] that you need to be in contact with and
[1:46:55] you serve Him in that measure and when
[1:46:57] you are effective and faithful and then
[1:46:59] measure he will take you on to greater
[1:47:01] things till you are living out the
[1:47:03] fullness of your personal Commission

[1:47:12] rate and the final word was a min what
[1:47:17] does that mean so be it
[1:47:19] in other words all these things Lord let
[1:47:22] them be in my life I don't just want
[1:47:25] half of what you've sinned all of what
[1:47:28] you've sinned let it be established let
[1:47:31] it be done Lord as much as it hurts and
[1:47:34] might feel like an inconveniences but
[1:47:37] let it be done hallelujah and now you
[1:47:39] watch the change some of us I know that
[1:47:45] you're people here that know what I'm
[1:47:47] talking about this morning people here
[1:47:49] have been in that place of Prayer you
[1:47:50] know the power of it but often for all
[1:47:53] of us and myself included they are
[1:47:55] memories of those times this is called
[1:47:59] to be more than a memory this is called
[1:48:00] to be a consistent everything well in
[1:48:03] other words when you're washing the
[1:48:05] dishes you're in fellowship with God
[1:48:07] when you're out there and spanners and
[1:48:09] graceful of your eyes communion with God
[1:48:12] in a supermarket communion with God he's
[1:48:15] the first one you talk to it the dawning
[1:48:18] of a new day
[1:48:19] when you talk to at the end of the day
[1:48:21] and the one you talk the most to during
[1:48:24] the day
[1:48:24] you're so conscious of God by being in
[1:48:27] fellowship with him
[1:48:28] my what a God and he wants that so much
[1:48:32] but you know what this God is a
[1:48:34] gentleman you don't push him herself on
[1:48:36] you he's not like that he just wants you
[1:48:39] to act your own leisure
[1:48:40] yeah your own willingness go before him
[1:48:43] and say Lord here am i and here we go
[1:48:46] and do he what a bliss above what you
[1:48:49] can imagine wouldn't you want to serve a
[1:48:56] God why don't be married to somebody
[1:48:58] like that God don't force himself the
[1:49:00] devil forces himself or he makes you
[1:49:02] listen to his music everywhere you go
[1:49:05] you have to listen to it you have to
[1:49:06] watch all his stuff on the billboards
[1:49:08] and see it in the magazines is on the
[1:49:10] television and internet everything pops
[1:49:13] up it makes you see all that and what
[1:49:16] does it do for you yeah all you do is
[1:49:19] you go through life the ejected
[1:49:20] bombarded falling plenteous tears it's
[1:49:25] empty this is the devil that we make a
[1:49:30] lot of accommodation for and that's all
[1:49:34] he can do for you I think the devil
[1:49:36] cares about your talent the devil will
[1:49:38] harness your talent you glorify him and
[1:49:41] when you've said his purpose you'll spit
[1:49:42] you out and leave you on the side walls
[1:49:44] right yeah
[1:49:44] that's the devil all these great movie
[1:49:47] stars ones have served their purpose
[1:49:48] they get spat out and all they end up is
[1:49:51] laying dead on a bear the whole bunch of
[1:49:53] needles around them yeah they're drunk
[1:49:55] whatever shots yeah they serve their
[1:49:57] purpose to glorify the devil and he
[1:49:59] spits them out and that's the devil we
[1:50:02] accommodate often what does God called
[1:50:05] us to God won't spit you out I'll tell
[1:50:08] you what when you've served your purpose
[1:50:09] he takes you home to glory
[1:50:12] they take you've served your purpose the
[1:50:15] reason why you were here this morning
[1:50:16] and woke up and drew breath cuz you and
[1:50:19] not finish with you
[1:50:23] as long as you draw breath you have a
[1:50:29] service we purpose what is godly as you
[1:50:35] spit you up now he promotes you the
[1:50:37] glory
[1:50:37] death is promotion for the break
[1:50:41] hallelujah she's not going down she's
[1:50:44] going to our greater body at the opening
[1:50:46] that's already waiting hallelujah we're
[1:50:51] talking about this last night and the
[1:50:52] Holy Ghost links you up with your word
[1:50:56] representation that is already there in
[1:50:58] other words brother Chris the real you
[1:51:01] is over there and perfection
[1:51:03] the real me is over there already in
[1:51:05] perfection and I never knew it without
[1:51:07] the Holy Ghost but when the word came my
[1:51:09] way something within me responded and
[1:51:13] when I received the Holy Ghost and
[1:51:14] aligned me with my word representation
[1:51:17] hallelujah death is only the proper seat
[1:51:22] of buggie
[1:51:24] how it hitches you up to take you in the
[1:51:27] glory amen praise the Lord let these
[1:51:30] things be done Lord what is prayer
[1:51:32] prayer is humanity praying to deity
[1:51:35] that's what the people stumble over if
[1:51:37] he is God why is he praying who's he
[1:51:40] praying to Jesus was all God and
[1:51:42] completely men oh that's the mystery of
[1:51:46] it's his humanity his flesh humanity
[1:51:51] prayed to the deity within him when you
[1:51:55] pray humanity prays to the deity who is
[1:51:59] the Holy Ghost already on the insane
[1:52:01] that's why the pattern of prayer is for
[1:52:04] those who have the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:52:09] my and if he was a fullness of the word
[1:52:13] and had to pray what about you only half
[1:52:15] of my measure yeah oh how much greater
[1:52:17] do we need to pray in this busy age slow
[1:52:21] it down
[1:52:22] lock yourself in a room for 24 hours and
[1:52:24] appreciate how long the day is you'll
[1:52:27] find nothing spit up
[1:52:34] yeah are you tired
[1:52:39] shall I continue you know if there's one
[1:52:44] subject for me in my whole life to this
[1:52:47] point that holds such a great evaluates
[1:52:49] in the subject there is nothing like
[1:52:52] this this is the greatest tool and we
[1:52:54] are come to harness there's nothing like
[1:52:57] this subject
[1:52:59] Jesus Jesus showed us that prayer and
[1:53:01] fasting are connected present optional
[1:53:05] when you feel like it
[1:53:07] prayer is not what you make yourself do
[1:53:09] pray comes forth from within you it's
[1:53:12] automatic
[1:53:13] amen that's why when we come to church
[1:53:16] but some of us it's automatic we brother
[1:53:21] Andy said last night David said I was
[1:53:23] glad and when they said to me come and
[1:53:25] let's go up to the house of the Lord
[1:53:26] something happened to David so when it
[1:53:29] was said let's go up to Zion oh my let's
[1:53:32] go up but but but for many of us it saw
[1:53:35] something and it's brother saw and said
[1:53:38] he has a record of being about two hours
[1:53:40] minimum
[1:53:40] it's three hours and in a munch is the
[1:53:43] chicken is set to 12 p.m. and I know we
[1:53:47] get home and it's all carbon DUP and and
[1:53:49] and listen that and what inconvenient
[1:53:53] they can the Lord change that why you
[1:53:59] know what if you don't feel like that
[1:54:00] this morning I I'm glad to be in the
[1:54:02] house the Lord and I tell you there were
[1:54:04] days and my life I was not glad to go up
[1:54:06] to the house to the Lord you know what
[1:54:07] changed that the Lord did
[1:54:10] for some of you that might be today it
[1:54:12] might be tomorrow might be in five years
[1:54:13] whenever but you all have your appointed
[1:54:15] time amen you can't get ahead of that
[1:54:19] time wherever you are no matter how
[1:54:21] messed up you are you exactly where God
[1:54:23] wants you even if it's the depth of sin
[1:54:26] you're a right where God wants you
[1:54:29] amen that's the paradox of free moral
[1:54:33] agency you have choice but God already
[1:54:35] knows hallelujah my prayer and fasting
[1:54:41] is connected now when Jesus was
[1:54:44] transfigured in Matthew 17 him Peter
[1:54:47] James and John descend from the mountain
[1:54:49] and the first thing they encounter is a
[1:54:51] man who has a child who is a lunatic
[1:54:55] possessed by a devil and the disciples
[1:54:58] were unable to cast the devil out and
[1:55:02] the the father of the child rushes to
[1:55:05] Jesus Falls of his fingers what help me
[1:55:07] my son he's possessed and he saw VEX and
[1:55:12] he falls into the fire and into the
[1:55:14] water and he thrashes about you know how
[1:55:16] many times people had epileptic fits
[1:55:17] when they stood in the presence of the
[1:55:18] Prophet the devil always reacted when
[1:55:23] the people stood in the presence of the
[1:55:24] Prophet and scratched about because he
[1:55:27] knew his time was up
[1:55:28] and Jesus does Jesus work himself up
[1:55:33] this devil I'll show these disciples
[1:55:37] stand aside this site was Galloway bring
[1:55:41] me this - that's not what Jesus did
[1:55:43] bring me the child
[1:55:45] you see Jesus does the Bible says that
[1:55:48] he paused abundance of did jesus shake
[1:55:52] the child come out of him devil Jesus
[1:55:59] rebukes the devil and the devil leaves
[1:56:02] and that his psyche was shocked because
[1:56:06] Jesus approach was so unorthodox because
[1:56:10] I'd been shaking the stuffing out of
[1:56:11] that little boy and they've already been
[1:56:13] shaking enough with the devil in them
[1:56:15] and Jesus comes along and just says
[1:56:18] leave and the devil leaves a child
[1:56:23] and the disciples are what is this and
[1:56:27] they come to Jesus apart and they say
[1:56:29] why could we not have tossed them out
[1:56:31] why could we not cast out this devil
[1:56:34] you've already given us power to cast
[1:56:36] out Devils and now we've come across one
[1:56:39] that we are actually powerless against
[1:56:44] and jesus said unto them because of your
[1:56:46] unbelief I say unto you if you have
[1:56:50] faith as a grain of mustard seed then
[1:56:52] you shall say to this mountain being the
[1:56:53] Mount of Olives removed hence to you on
[1:56:56] the place in the cherry moon now when we
[1:56:57] talk about this mountain
[1:56:58] we're not spiritualizing it as a
[1:57:00] mountain of faith it's a mountain a
[1:57:03] grain of mustard seed faith has the
[1:57:07] power to move not a mountain of sin at a
[1:57:10] mountain now the eggnog Mount Ruapehu
[1:57:13] adds that power just a great grain size
[1:57:17] faith spiritual eyes so many things
[1:57:21] these things are that and he says if you
[1:57:26] had that kind of faith you could say the
[1:57:29] mountain be removed and a wooden and
[1:57:30] nothing shall be impossible unto you
[1:57:32] healthy yet however this kind of devil
[1:57:35] dough is not out but by prayer and
[1:57:39] fasting man you mean you can only go so
[1:57:46] far handle Devils to a certain extent
[1:57:48] without fellowship with God yeah do you
[1:57:54] realize there are things there are
[1:57:55] Devils that often sit in your life that
[1:57:57] you are unable to deal with because you
[1:57:59] are out of a place of fellowship with
[1:58:02] God why do you have the setting sins
[1:58:05] that you just can't seem to shake off
[1:58:07] you've been up in older calls and they
[1:58:10] can't shake them out why there's no
[1:58:15] fellowship because in that fellowship
[1:58:21] see those two things that consecration
[1:58:27] is what will drive up every kind of bill
[1:58:31] every kind of devil my there are people
[1:58:34] out there in the world who because gifts
[1:58:36] and callings over there up repentance by
[1:58:37] Birds
[1:58:38] they had a gift of faith and cast out
[1:58:39] there but they themselves have devils in
[1:58:42] their own life that are not cast out
[1:58:44] because unless they walk under this
[1:58:46] message to bring a real consecration
[1:58:49] there's no change in them this is more
[1:58:54] than just what we can do fathers what
[1:58:56] could the Lord doing us these things are
[1:59:02] connected friends that's why I want to
[1:59:04] show you these things this morning Jesus
[1:59:09] never told his disciples how often he
[1:59:12] prayed how often he fasted yeah all he
[1:59:16] did was prove this consecration by
[1:59:18] casting oh yeah that's the secret
[1:59:22] something man who makes all the noise
[1:59:24] yeah there was a man just comes walking
[1:59:27] and he speaks it's not the place a
[1:59:34] Stanford I've listened to ten messages
[1:59:37] of the Prophet since Monday I've been
[1:59:40] praying for 15 hours minimum weekly and
[1:59:43] of that there is a man we
[1:59:45] behind-the-scenes private fellowship
[1:59:48] with the left hand don't know what the
[1:59:49] right hand is doing you like no idea
[1:59:51] he looks this personal absolutely
[1:59:53] ordinary to all of us just looks like
[1:59:55] the same brother Andy that he was last
[1:59:57] week or five years ago but what you
[1:59:59] don't know is what exists behind the
[2:00:00] scenes and here comes a man walking and
[2:00:03] he can speak and he's effective and
[2:00:06] Devils are responding he's proving where
[2:00:09] he's at in the word by a manifestation
[2:00:12] by a life expressing what's happening
[2:00:15] behind the scenes you see that yeah it's
[2:00:20] not about how much you talk about what
[2:00:21] you do yeah your prowess with the quotes
[2:00:24] in the scriptures right it's when there
[2:00:26] is something to be done you go forth and
[2:00:28] you do like it's just ordinary the
[2:00:30] supernet was natural God wants to bring
[2:00:33] it in supernet was just natural just
[2:00:35] that's my life it's just what happens
[2:00:37] it's just what I do you eat breakfast
[2:00:40] because that's what you do you're in
[2:00:42] sweet communion with God because that's
[2:00:44] just what you do
[2:00:45] it's just my life I decide maybe we we
[2:00:50] have to start scrapping some things to
[2:00:52] give them now time you find out that 80%
[2:00:56] of what you do is totally a waste of
[2:00:58] time because as long as you want a body
[2:01:03] of flesh you are naturally attracted to
[2:01:05] fleshly service you can sit down for
[2:01:06] hour after hour on youtubing and you
[2:01:08] start off watching about gardening and
[2:01:10] you end up watching about Jurassic Park
[2:01:12] by the end of the journey
[2:01:13] three hours later and you complain after
[2:01:15] we reach an hour and a half in the
[2:01:16] church watch full of Gaea blah the Rings
[2:01:21] nine hours piece of cake eazy-e's and
[2:01:25] complain yeah when you come into the
[2:01:27] house of God so you realize now that we
[2:01:30] indulge heavily and things that are
[2:01:31] totally unnecessary yeah and you find
[2:01:34] that those things a bit from men to
[2:01:35] often to our walk they're not sinful
[2:01:37] some of those things they're not all
[2:01:39] sinful things but for some of us they
[2:01:42] are hindrances in our life and for God
[2:01:45] to have the greater effect in your life
[2:01:47] he calls you to a separation first there
[2:01:51] must be an acceptable separation to come
[2:01:54] into an acceptable union God will place
[2:01:59] demands on you that he will not place on
[2:02:01] other people he will show you things in
[2:02:03] that private time of prayer hey look my
[2:02:06] son is spending too much time watching
[2:02:08] these things cut these things off
[2:02:10] because when you're cutting things off
[2:02:12] God gives you something better
[2:02:13] all right when you stop smoking it's not
[2:02:16] for you to go and be dry in a craving
[2:02:18] for a smoke for God to give you
[2:02:19] something bit time always give me
[2:02:23] something bitter right we didn't come to
[2:02:26] sturb the Lord to enjoy a life a
[2:02:28] disappointment it was to come at the
[2:02:30] true joy we actually find out what
[2:02:32] fulfillment is it's beyond winning the
[2:02:34] lotto amen beyond winning the lotto let
[2:02:38] me tell you this how many of you here
[2:02:40] this morning thought that when you got
[2:02:41] married you would be complete some of
[2:02:44] you did and when you got married and
[2:02:47] everything it settled down you found out
[2:02:48] that you were still not satisfied and
[2:02:51] then you thought if I got the pay rise
[2:02:53] and it's so much in the bank I feel like
[2:02:55] I'm really
[2:02:56] and complete and when you got there was
[2:02:58] good at the time not a little while no
[2:03:00] leading more you thought when you had
[2:03:03] children family by the home and have
[2:03:06] some more life and I'd feel completes
[2:03:08] and you've got the children in the
[2:03:09] family and it was all good and that's
[2:03:11] wonderful ahead but we found your
[2:03:13] student and completes and you realize no
[2:03:16] matter what you think will be the thing
[2:03:18] that really settles it for you and gives
[2:03:20] you a sense of accomplishment it's
[2:03:21] always elusive it's never it's the only
[2:03:24] thing that can bring a lasting
[2:03:26] fulfillment is when Christ is first then
[2:03:31] with your wife and your children all the
[2:03:32] money in the bank of the nice car in the
[2:03:33] flesh home your completes because God is
[2:03:36] in it hallelujah why not seek them first
[2:03:40] get your priorities the right way hey
[2:03:44] man
[2:03:44] then all these other things can be added
[2:03:48] why do people run after other things
[2:03:51] because they're empty you're empty
[2:03:54] that's why you run after other things
[2:03:55] get Christ in where you have a purpose
[2:03:58] and you find out you actually don't need
[2:04:01] those things because you're full of
[2:04:03] Jesus Christ and all you want to give
[2:04:05] your time to is serve Him you don't have
[2:04:08] time for the devil anymore you've got
[2:04:10] too much of God to deal with mine and I
[2:04:17] have too much of God praise the Lord
[2:04:19] hallelujah I tell you I'm preaching to
[2:04:24] myself this morning I'm raking myself
[2:04:27] over the coals and cutting deep because
[2:04:29] it's it's needful for me but I see it in
[2:04:32] the way I say Lord give me this give me
[2:04:36] that Lord hallelujah praying fasting a
[2:04:40] secret things they will produce a
[2:04:42] consecrated life watch what the Prophet
[2:04:45] said in Smyrna church age he says we
[2:04:47] have more wealth than we have ever had
[2:04:49] and yet less is being accomplished
[2:04:51] spiritually it is not with money that
[2:04:55] God works
[2:04:56] he moves by his Spirit and that moving
[2:05:00] of the Spirit comes only to a life
[2:05:03] consecrated to the words hallelujah you
[2:05:07] want to see God move
[2:05:08] have a life consequence freeze alone the
[2:05:13] disciple has already had the power to
[2:05:15] cast out Devils and Mach three they were
[2:05:17] already commissioned given the power and
[2:05:20] now they faced a devil they were lacking
[2:05:22] the faith
[2:05:23] cast out they didn't even have mustard
[2:05:27] seed faith because if they had that they
[2:05:28] could cast the devil out how much
[2:05:31] faithful weed eating friends cooking out
[2:05:33] what is faith revelation in other words
[2:05:35] give me a clearer understanding of your
[2:05:37] word and what is revelation relationship
[2:05:40] what he said last night it's a
[2:05:42] relationship that by the hour Albert's
[2:05:44] is their relationship that's what it is
[2:05:47] to know him because when you know him
[2:05:50] who's casting out the devil not me
[2:05:51] that's the God I know in me that's God
[2:05:55] standing there or what devil can stand
[2:05:58] against there was God standing before
[2:06:01] the lunatic child the devil could stand
[2:06:03] before that never was created by God you
[2:06:06] had to obey God hey man
[2:06:09] moving of the Spirit comes to a life
[2:06:11] consecrated to the word praise the Lord
[2:06:15] now what is fasting we pray he just Lord
[2:06:21] out fast
[2:06:22] teachers Lord how to pray teach me Lord
[2:06:24] out fast what is it you realize these
[2:06:26] things are not difficult at all things
[2:06:29] are not actually a burden at all it's
[2:06:31] very straight for God is not going to
[2:06:32] give any things to inconvenience right
[2:06:35] that's not how God works 1964 the
[2:06:42] message identification the Prophet said
[2:06:43] a lady asked me coming down the road the
[2:06:45] other day from up here
[2:06:46] it's Florence who should carry and
[2:06:48] brother Dimas his sister it's just the
[2:06:50] Williams and then they sit in the car
[2:06:51] and she said brother Brennan I fast and
[2:06:53] fast and fast and still I can't cast out
[2:06:57] Devils
[2:06:57] I said you wasn't born to do such your
[2:07:01] duty is fast the Holy spirt is working
[2:07:04] on somebody else out there for that in
[2:07:06] other words for the casting out of the
[2:07:08] devil but your part is too fast you
[2:07:10] don't know the place now this woman the
[2:07:12] theme master carrion sister Florence she
[2:07:15] had a gift of fasting some people are
[2:07:20] gifted to pray
[2:07:22] is a gift of bread yeah that's why the
[2:07:24] church is prayer warriors who want a
[2:07:26] highness
[2:07:27] but then there's people like me who are
[2:07:28] not gifted in prayer and that's why for
[2:07:32] me it's breaking through the veil but
[2:07:34] when there's a gift you watch they can
[2:07:37] just soldier maybe Channel that's a gift
[2:07:41] and like this woman she had a gift of
[2:07:44] fast it was just an anointing something
[2:07:46] a better life just made her that way too
[2:07:48] fast because fasting is perverted right
[2:07:51] it's because there's a need a burden
[2:07:54] something's weighing on you and she says
[2:07:58] I'm doing I'm fasting I'm praying when
[2:08:01] I'm fasting and I can't cast our
[2:08:02] business and the prophecy because you
[2:08:04] were not called to cast your Judy is too
[2:08:09] fast
[2:08:09] what was the success of the prophets and
[2:08:11] ministry the success of the ministry was
[2:08:15] not that just the angel had appeared to
[2:08:16] him the success of the ministry was the
[2:08:19] angels are the brothers you say out the
[2:08:21] back praying for the bros on their knees
[2:08:25] but nobody saw praying for him is what
[2:08:29] gave the success all those meetings I
[2:08:32] trust successive this morning is because
[2:08:35] they were phrase be phrase you've got to
[2:08:43] know what you're called to the
[2:08:44] limitations of boundaries of your corner
[2:08:46] don't try and take dance portion or
[2:08:48] dad's Porsche ashes Porsche you take
[2:08:50] your portion what the Holy Ghost he
[2:08:52] finds to what Joshua tells you is yours
[2:08:54] this morning if you see that's yours
[2:08:56] you only take that much don't venture to
[2:08:59] brother Benz parts the other brothers
[2:09:02] and sisters pass on Finch internets
[2:09:04] just be happy living in all that God's
[2:09:09] it is yours not 50% but all that yours
[2:09:12] enough yours is only a small part living
[2:09:14] all the small parts
[2:09:16] it was a greater part living all the
[2:09:18] greater my and the profit makes us an
[2:09:26] amazing thinkers remember showing you
[2:09:27] that fasting is not a but it not a chore
[2:09:30] it's not for you to go home now brain
[2:09:33] was hard enough the Prophet said people
[2:09:38] wouldn't miss port and fast victory he
[2:09:40] says I went read the question long one
[2:09:42] but here's a man wrote a book this isn't
[2:09:44] the message the Intervale 1956 a man
[2:09:47] wrote a book about fasting and he says
[2:09:51] that he had a picture of a woman on the
[2:09:54] cover and before she began her forty day
[2:09:56] fast apparently she looked a certain way
[2:09:59] but after the forty day fast she looked
[2:10:01] 20 years younger and everybody read the
[2:10:04] book or the woman read the book and they
[2:10:07] saw the picture of this young looking
[2:10:09] woman on the cover and they thought and
[2:10:15] they begin to fast for 40 days he's
[2:10:17] woman they because they they believe
[2:10:19] this because remember the inspiration
[2:10:22] behind the book was that Jesus fasted
[2:10:24] forty days and so the man writes a book
[2:10:26] on the power of this kind of fast here
[2:10:29] is a young looking woman so everybody
[2:10:31] wants to lose some years and in the
[2:10:36] prophecies this so they began a faster
[2:10:37] forty days as is some of them with false
[2:10:39] plates and their teeth would drop out
[2:10:41] and their eyes would sink back and
[2:10:43] mothers to be woman to be mothers their
[2:10:45] little ones that you understand they
[2:10:47] would go completely mentally out and be
[2:10:49] taken into the institutions many of them
[2:10:51] come in that condition and the
[2:10:53] prophecies I believe in fasting
[2:10:55] certainly but when you fast you don't
[2:10:58] hunger ah Jesus after he got through
[2:11:04] fasting the Bible says he was hungry
[2:11:11] that means you're not putting yourself
[2:11:13] into a fast yeah it's an automatic thing
[2:11:20] think about this we continue say you've
[2:11:23] got a nice roast you're really looking
[2:11:25] for
[2:11:26] we're all hungry the fragrance of it is
[2:11:29] coming through the oven you're ready
[2:11:31] that eats like we were last know we
[2:11:33] really that eats but imagine the phone
[2:11:37] rings where all we are just ready to eat
[2:11:39] and the phone rings are we here tragedy
[2:11:42] in the family
[2:11:43] yeah loved one just been killed hunger
[2:11:47] gone automatic fast just lay your
[2:11:52] burdens you are burning because this
[2:11:54] relates to you often you don't feel that
[2:11:56] way when it's tragedy about somebody
[2:11:58] else but when it starts getting home
[2:11:59] boom straight into a fast see that yeah
[2:12:04] now we're understanding a bit more
[2:12:06] aren't we yeah how these things work the
[2:12:10] men and the prophecies he certainly
[2:12:12] captured the woman the man that did they
[2:12:14] wrote the book and it says all these
[2:12:15] things fasting is an anointing it's a
[2:12:20] time where you were denying the flesh to
[2:12:23] get alone with God now what I want to
[2:12:25] show you is there's three levels of
[2:12:26] fasting and that fast that Jesus had was
[2:12:30] the highest level of fasting there are
[2:12:33] two other levels the Prophet said in
[2:12:36] perseverance 1962 yesterday I was
[2:12:40] sitting in the room usually Friday is a
[2:12:43] fast day for me I don't eat on sometimes
[2:12:46] Tuesdays and Fridays till sometime in
[2:12:50] the afternoon that's he said that's not
[2:12:52] a regular fast that's just a couple of
[2:12:54] days a week too fast so a longer fast
[2:12:58] comes in more days when the Lord puts it
[2:13:01] upon you but this type of fast he's
[2:13:04] talking about that's just an respects
[2:13:06] and honor of God's great Memorial to us
[2:13:10] the fasting a command and so after three
[2:13:13] o'clock usually I have something lights
[2:13:14] now watch
[2:13:16] there is fasting out of respect to God's
[2:13:19] Word and when he would fast out of
[2:13:22] respected God's Word he would put primer
[2:13:25] say to just spend alone in the scripture
[2:13:28] in prayer it's not eating maybe to the
[2:13:31] early afternoon 3 o'clock then he might
[2:13:33] have something to eat in the fastest
[2:13:34] finish and he's hungry because it's not
[2:13:36] an anointing it's out a respectable word
[2:13:38] and during
[2:13:40] Tiny's he's devoting himself to the
[2:13:43] presence of God this is not something
[2:13:45] where you'd go to work in your fasting
[2:13:47] right this is when you're taking time
[2:13:49] aside the spin in the presence of God
[2:13:52] and you're hungry because it's not
[2:13:54] anointing it's respect to the word
[2:13:56] that's the lowest level of fasting very
[2:13:59] brief not even a full thing this respect
[2:14:04] God honors his word
[2:14:07] now watch that's the lowest level when
[2:14:10] Jesus went to the wilderness to be
[2:14:12] tempted he did not go too fast I mean
[2:14:16] they went quick I mean he did not go
[2:14:18] there too fast
[2:14:19] he went there because he was led by the
[2:14:22] spirit to be tempted and when he's when
[2:14:26] he's there being tempted he's not eating
[2:14:28] and he's unconscious of the fact he's
[2:14:31] not eating nor drinking he's oblivious
[2:14:35] to the fact that he's in a fast and
[2:14:37] after he withstands the devil by the
[2:14:41] word that he's trended then the Bible
[2:14:44] says after what he wasn't hunger let me
[2:14:49] say that again the devil tempted a
[2:14:50] mouthing was a hunger but after the
[2:14:53] anointing of the fast came off him and
[2:14:55] he was hungry that's when the devil
[2:14:56] tempted him but he did not go too fast
[2:14:59] it was an anointing that was upon him
[2:15:02] right when Moses went up into Mount
[2:15:04] Sinai to receive the law and the
[2:15:07] instruction on how to build the
[2:15:09] tabernacle he did not go there too fast
[2:15:11] he went there because God instructed him
[2:15:14] to go on up and when he's receiving
[2:15:16] revelation from God he goes into an
[2:15:18] automatic fast because he's there for 40
[2:15:21] days and 40 nights and neither ate nor
[2:15:23] drank and he's not hungry the highest
[2:15:27] level when Elijah was fleeing from
[2:15:30] Jezebel in the Book of Kings and the
[2:15:33] angel prepared a meal for Elijah
[2:15:35] the Bible says Elijah went and the
[2:15:37] strength of that meal for forty days
[2:15:40] do you know Elijah was not intending to
[2:15:42] fasts he just ate a meal and that was it
[2:15:45] for forty days it's an anointing it's an
[2:15:49] anointing that is the highest level and
[2:15:51] you may never experience
[2:15:53] once in your life but that is a level of
[2:15:56] fasting that exists then the second
[2:16:00] level of fasting is what Daniel
[2:16:03] experienced and dangled Tim Daniel was
[2:16:06] burdened because the angel things have
[2:16:08] been revealed to him in the word and
[2:16:10] he's burdened about what he's singing
[2:16:12] the word and the Bible says he's seeking
[2:16:15] the will of God and the Bible says that
[2:16:17] he ate no Pleasant bread for 21 days the
[2:16:24] only thing he's not eating his Pleasant
[2:16:26] bread
[2:16:26] he's eating unleavened bread but not
[2:16:29] Pleasant bread so he's still having a
[2:16:32] little food in water over 21 days but
[2:16:35] the whole appetite to eat normally is
[2:16:38] not there because of the burden that he
[2:16:40] has to receive from the angel then after
[2:16:44] 21 days II angel comes down Gabriel
[2:16:47] comes down and apologizes for the delay
[2:16:51] and then after he has revealed certain
[2:16:54] things the fast is over and is back to
[2:16:57] eating normally again that is the second
[2:16:59] level of fasting that is why when you
[2:17:01] are burdened about something this is now
[2:17:03] beyond respects to God's Word you just
[2:17:06] have your whole focus is Lord know what
[2:17:09] I'm needing something I need a response
[2:17:11] I neither I need to draw from you and it
[2:17:15] takes away the appetite
[2:17:16] you might sip a little water and have a
[2:17:18] little cracker here and there just to
[2:17:20] keep you going but the main appetites
[2:17:22] not there that's the second level of
[2:17:24] fasting those are the three levels below
[2:17:27] assist respect God's Word not even a day
[2:17:29] to take time alone with God just to
[2:17:31] think on his word commune with them the
[2:17:33] second level is your burdens you might
[2:17:35] eat a little something here until the
[2:17:37] Lord comes on the scene and settles your
[2:17:39] heart the effort I pretends and the
[2:17:41] highest level is when there is an
[2:17:42] anointing God comes down there is no
[2:17:46] thought there's no hunger there's no
[2:17:47] thirst there's nothing you understand
[2:17:49] that this morning so is it difficult
[2:17:51] it's so simple isn't it it's an
[2:17:54] inconvenient no it's not God would put
[2:18:00] rigors on us
[2:18:02] why there's people who worship their
[2:18:04] foreign gods make trips to Mick and
[2:18:06] prays five times a day and all these the
[2:18:08] mines and that's so faithful and all we
[2:18:10] have to do is push the pedal in our cars
[2:18:13] and come to church and it's too hot oh
[2:18:19] why how did the burden come on Daniel
[2:18:25] Daniel was looking in the word yeah he
[2:18:28] was seeing what was written in the word
[2:18:29] and he wanted that see the word be
[2:18:34] reality he wanted to be in the place
[2:18:37] where the word was at amen he wanted to
[2:18:40] make the angel and when he prepared his
[2:18:43] heart when he got serious about what he
[2:18:45] was seeing the angel came he was reading
[2:18:47] The Book of Jeremiah here in about 70
[2:18:49] years in Babylon and his burdens and
[2:18:51] Gabriel comes down to tell them about 70
[2:18:55] weeks how does the angel come Prince you
[2:19:01] want to meet the angel think admit the
[2:19:03] angel how does the angel come down
[2:19:06] desperation serious go beyond the veil
[2:19:10] of Pilate election manna to go beyond
[2:19:12] all that's and it and watch the aims let
[2:19:15] the presence of God coming down your
[2:19:16] little candidates and that's where you
[2:19:18] can stay there for 40 minutes one hour
[2:19:20] two hours three days whatever you'll
[2:19:22] just stay there and he can minister to
[2:19:27] you once you finish talking and pouring
[2:19:30] out yourself just wait who's the angel
[2:19:34] friends I was telling this last night
[2:19:35] who is Gabriel who is Gabriel who's
[2:19:39] Michael I will tell you right now
[2:19:42] Michael and Gabriel Jesus Christ
[2:19:46] every time Gabriel appears in the Bible
[2:19:48] he is the giver of Revelation so right
[2:19:51] Daniel 8 he's revealing the vision of
[2:19:53] the RAM and he goes Daniel 9 he's
[2:19:55] revealing about the 70 weeks Daniel 10
[2:19:57] is telling about the the battle between
[2:19:59] the Prince of Persia and the things that
[2:20:01] will unfold he comes to Zacharias and
[2:20:04] Luke 1 and he discerns the condition of
[2:20:06] Elizabeth your wife is barren she's old
[2:20:08] stricken in years but will bring forth
[2:20:09] an angel with discernment an angel who
[2:20:12] gives revelation who is this angel
[2:20:16] all through the Old Testament Scott the
[2:20:18] angel of the Lord he does not have a
[2:20:19] name but by the Book of Daniel he's
[2:20:21] given a name Gabriel a man every time
[2:20:24] Daniel saw him what did he see a man he
[2:20:28] described a man and that man was God
[2:20:33] Gabriel as the give of revelation comes
[2:20:35] to Mary you will bring forth the son you
[2:20:37] know that was God announcing his own
[2:20:38] birth
[2:20:40] Gabriel was God standing there telling
[2:20:42] Mary about when he's going to be born
[2:20:47] now let me tell you this in 1946 who
[2:20:50] appeared to the Prophet Gabriel but I
[2:20:56] thought it was Jesus Christ who was with
[2:20:58] the Prophet who's Jesus Christ who was
[2:21:02] it that discerned the names and the
[2:21:04] addresses and the conditions of every
[2:21:05] single person was it brother Branham no
[2:21:08] was it God was God wasn't it
[2:21:10] but what's God's name in that position
[2:21:12] when he's the giver of revelation what's
[2:21:14] his name Gabriel he was a man that
[2:21:18] stepped out of the ball of fire
[2:21:23] do you realize before he was a man he
[2:21:26] was the pillar of fire that appeared in
[2:21:28] the log cabin in 1906 and hovered above
[2:21:31] the bed of the Prophet he was a ball of
[2:21:32] fire and then when the proper was seven
[2:21:35] years of age that ball of fire is now a
[2:21:37] whirlwind that speaks a talking world
[2:21:41] winds then in 1946 and dreams more
[2:21:45] Indiana in a cave here is the ball of
[2:21:47] fire and out all that steps a man whose
[2:21:50] voice is the same as the whirlwinds so
[2:21:53] who is this man it must be the pillar of
[2:21:56] fire it must be God himself Jesus Christ
[2:22:01] appearing in these last days as Gabriel
[2:22:03] who is the giver of Revelation so who's
[2:22:08] Michael Jesus Christ the protector of
[2:22:12] his word every time Michael is seen in
[2:22:14] the Bible Daniel chapter 12
[2:22:16] he's there to deliver the names written
[2:22:18] in the book it's your name written in
[2:22:20] the book he's there to deliver the names
[2:22:22] hallelujah when he's seen in Jude
[2:22:24] there's a contention between the devil
[2:22:27] and Michael about the body
[2:22:29] Moses its confrontation and Michael says
[2:22:32] the Lord rebuke thee Satan revelation 12
[2:22:35] it's a war between Lucifer and Michael
[2:22:38] it's warfare God standing for his word
[2:22:41] God standing for his people the
[2:22:44] protector of his revelation God changing
[2:22:47] office depending on what he wants to
[2:22:49] achieve mine where do we first read
[2:22:55] about Michael in the Bible Michael comes
[2:22:59] to help Gabriel Daniel was in prayer 21
[2:23:06] days fasting wanting the Lord to come my
[2:23:08] angel Lord send the angel and Gabriel
[2:23:11] finally turns up and he apologizes he
[2:23:13] says gate Daniel I'm sorry but for 21
[2:23:15] days the Prince of Persia who is the
[2:23:17] devil withstood me and I he could not
[2:23:20] prevail as Gabriel / the devil and their
[2:23:24] office so what does Gabriel have to do
[2:23:27] change form and become Michael and as
[2:23:31] Michael the devil is driven back and it
[2:23:33] becomes Gabriel and speaks to Daniel is
[2:23:36] that so hard you talk about one God but
[2:23:40] the Prophet come in these last days to
[2:23:42] reveal who God is but the prophets say
[2:23:44] God is not one like that yeah why
[2:23:46] because in Revelation 4 it's 1 God on
[2:23:48] the throne but the seven spirits of the
[2:23:50] one God before the throne and the four
[2:23:52] cherubims of the one God before the
[2:23:54] throne but I thought there's only one
[2:23:56] God there is only one God who can reveal
[2:23:58] himself in Menna four offices hallelujah
[2:24:01] that one purifier became a hundred and
[2:24:04] twenty licks of fire in the upper room
[2:24:07] one God became seven heavenly angels
[2:24:10] that formed the cloud in 1963 that was
[2:24:13] the seven spirits of God in the form of
[2:24:15] a cloud revealing one God hallelujah so
[2:24:21] who is the mighty angel that came down
[2:24:23] in Revelation 10 Gabriel himself the
[2:24:26] giver of revelation the angel appearing
[2:24:29] to those who are looking for him those
[2:24:32] who are needing him to come he's
[2:24:33] descended on an age level but he has to
[2:24:37] descend for personally to me
[2:24:39] and that's what your prayer life is all
[2:24:41] about to bring Gabriel into your little
[2:24:44] big chamber that little campus
[2:24:46] bring him there now when you're walking
[2:24:49] Gabriel is with you when you're speaking
[2:24:52] Gabriel speaks Amen when you're sick you
[2:24:57] don't need to open Missy you need
[2:25:01] Jehovah Rapha when there's something
[2:25:05] that you need you need more than Jehovah
[2:25:09] Shalom I want God as Jehovah Jireh I
[2:25:12] need God to manifest himself in a
[2:25:15] specific office to meet my need when he
[2:25:19] was the son of God a spirit being
[2:25:21] he cannot shed his blood in that office
[2:25:24] so he changes farmer becomes a son of
[2:25:26] man and in that farm he can shed blood
[2:25:29] the penny of what he must achieve in his
[2:25:32] office he changes form becomes that
[2:25:34] tooth of thorns
[2:25:37] simple isn't it we're thinking about all
[2:25:40] these angels and it's one God revealing
[2:25:42] himself in different forms this angel
[2:25:46] who's appeared to us and these last days
[2:25:48] Saints is Gabriel himself Jesus Christ a
[2:25:51] person of the Holy Ghost has appeared
[2:25:54] for us when does he appear when there's
[2:25:58] fellowship winners and since the golden
[2:26:00] altar was where the incense was offered
[2:26:02] the incense is the prayers when the
[2:26:04] prayers are going up before the Lord the
[2:26:06] angel appears where was the Prophet when
[2:26:08] Gabriel appeared in his cave praying
[2:26:11] where was Daniel when Gabriel appears
[2:26:12] alone praying
[2:26:14] where was that cariah's when Gabriel
[2:26:16] appeared offering incense and the people
[2:26:19] were outside praying to where and when
[2:26:22] is the angel going to come when there's
[2:26:25] prayer when this fellowship when there
[2:26:28] is communion with God this Gabriel
[2:26:32] ceases to be a figment of your
[2:26:33] imagination and is a living reality
[2:26:36] walking and speaking through you you
[2:26:43] know where the golden altar was placed
[2:26:45] it was placed just before the Holy of
[2:26:47] Holies was the last piece of furniture
[2:26:49] before you go into the hole
[2:26:50] what brings you closest to God what will
[2:26:53] bring you the very presence of God my
[2:26:55] hope a man and the smoke goes up and
[2:26:58] will blankets it will blanket the
[2:27:01] sanctuary
[2:27:02] it will blanket your home will blanket
[2:27:03] your life you are enveloped by a
[2:27:05] supernatural atmosphere or incense the
[2:27:12] Prophet said in the Victory Day 1963 you
[2:27:14] realized before the Prophet would step
[2:27:16] out in front of the people to preach the
[2:27:18] word he prayed first prayer Satan you
[2:27:22] can't do nothing to me I come in the
[2:27:24] name of the Lord Jesus you see something
[2:27:26] happens you're covered in the incense
[2:27:29] you're covered in your prayer and you
[2:27:31] can walk out the fake them cannot do
[2:27:33] anything against you Gabriel can step
[2:27:36] into that kind of atmosphere yes God
[2:27:39] don't appear at the rock concert God
[2:27:42] don't appear there but he will appear
[2:27:43] with is the right worship yeah you've
[2:27:45] been hearing about worship in this
[2:27:46] church Evan G well pray and worship is
[2:27:48] the same thing that's why when we sing
[2:27:52] that our singing us to match the
[2:27:53] preaching of the word oftentimes if we
[2:27:57] preached how we send out their journey
[2:27:58] and the Junction's that they win through
[2:28:01] what God's doing not in America not in
[2:28:05] German and Africa but here in Wellington
[2:28:07] not not in Taranaki but here in
[2:28:10] Wellington we sing about what the word
[2:28:11] is achieving Amen let's be covered with
[2:28:15] Craig covered with that incense and the
[2:28:19] secret to as I wrap this up that's
[2:28:21] relief for those of you who are
[2:28:22] wondering but not to see to commune with
[2:28:25] and if we just sit spill and let him
[2:28:28] answer us back many things and one of
[2:28:32] the horrible things that I do I will try
[2:28:35] I try to do all the talking and not sit
[2:28:38] still long enough for him to answer me
[2:28:41] back oh we do that so many times in
[2:28:46] prayer I think he what he would say back
[2:28:49] to us and sometimes I've did that and my
[2:28:54] whole opinion was changed you see I'd go
[2:28:57] to him ask him something now Lord these
[2:28:59] people really been it's changed
[2:29:01] altogether sometimes
[2:29:04] somewhere else just commune with the
[2:29:06] Lord
[2:29:07] oh what glorious fellowship just to get
[2:29:08] down and talk and commune and wait for
[2:29:11] him to talk back do we do that Oh My
[2:29:16] isn't that where we fall short we do all
[2:29:19] the talking amen we're ripping cuz when
[2:29:22] he comes he can show you how you make
[2:29:25] this right maybe that faith that you're
[2:29:29] wanting in your life will come if you
[2:29:31] just say too much in haste and leaves
[2:29:34] and never lets you speak that that's how
[2:29:36] the voice happens naturally you talk to
[2:29:40] one another yeah but you don't do that
[2:29:42] with God you present your list of
[2:29:45] demands all these things that you want
[2:29:47] to get sorted out to start your day
[2:29:49] because it's quite inconvenient being in
[2:29:51] this place but when the word becomes
[2:29:54] much more real to you this is not about
[2:29:57] you even going before God with anything
[2:29:59] but you want yeah you're not even
[2:30:03] thinking about that you just thank you
[2:30:05] Jesus praise your name thank you for
[2:30:08] watching can I tell you for many of us
[2:30:12] some of us may be where there's been no
[2:30:15] prayer life if there's a lot of things
[2:30:16] to thank the Lord for I'll tell you when
[2:30:19] you get down and you've been out of
[2:30:21] fellowship with the Lord for a long time
[2:30:23] you'll be staying there a long time when
[2:30:25] you go in as president is a lot of
[2:30:26] porking do a lot of things to think of
[2:30:29] or a lot of things to make right you
[2:30:32] know what happens when there is this
[2:30:34] rich constant fellowship of God when you
[2:30:38] go before the Lord the second time in
[2:30:40] the third phone now you can start
[2:30:42] looking at the new territory yeah
[2:30:44] because you've got all those other
[2:30:45] things out of the way yes if a laborer
[2:30:47] and his present you spoken about these
[2:30:49] things we've conversed about this and
[2:30:51] that he's spoken back to me now we can
[2:30:53] look at other things now we can start
[2:30:55] addressing my shortcomings or things I
[2:30:58] would like to see or but the home I'd
[2:31:01] like to buy all these other things you
[2:31:02] get address because all that bet lock
[2:31:04] their backlog of undone business now you
[2:31:10] can just really spend time
[2:31:12] fellowshipping in a deeper level for
[2:31:14] many of us even this morning for some of
[2:31:16] us where
[2:31:18] dad is just going to fall the Lord
[2:31:19] making things right lay it out before
[2:31:22] all your burdens or your vexations or
[2:31:24] your should get straight sort out things
[2:31:27] with God get on the straight and narrow
[2:31:29] with God once that's all laid out then
[2:31:31] when you come before him again you can
[2:31:32] start looking at these things start
[2:31:34] addressing other things you see how it
[2:31:37] is but often all it is if we come before
[2:31:40] the Lord oh I need this and be with me
[2:31:41] today and be with mum and be and be just
[2:31:44] shallow stuff we're talking about
[2:31:46] getting alone pouring it out pouring it
[2:31:49] out that's so rich amen and sometimes
[2:31:55] that kind of rich prayer might only be
[2:31:57] ten minutes another day it might be an
[2:31:59] hour might be two hours might be five
[2:32:02] minutes just when it's done and you're
[2:32:04] satisfying the Lord is satisfied get up
[2:32:08] amen
[2:32:09] some days you will be in a channel to
[2:32:11] pray there are days where I'm in a
[2:32:13] channel to pray there are other days I'm
[2:32:16] not in a channel whether you're in the
[2:32:18] channel or out of the channel
[2:32:19] breakthrough PMS breakthrough bring
[2:32:24] flesh to the wood good soldiers of Jesus
[2:32:27] Christ we have trouble praying have you
[2:32:29] done like praying tell the Lord what I
[2:32:31] hate it I can't stand it I don't like
[2:32:33] coming to church I don't enjoy reading
[2:32:35] the Bible tell them you already knows
[2:32:40] how many times have I picked up the
[2:32:42] Bible and read Ezekiel and by the second
[2:32:44] verse and completely lost no idea what
[2:32:46] it's talking about
[2:32:47] well the dates and the language confused
[2:32:49] why don't stand it it's too complicated
[2:32:52] but no idea what it's talking about help
[2:32:58] me to understand and then when you go on
[2:33:01] your journey when you go on your journey
[2:33:02] through life in musicians will come when
[2:33:04] you go through your journey we could
[2:33:06] make it play into my chamber be free
[2:33:08] Holy Spirit this journey that you are on
[2:33:14] it's between you and the Lord right it's
[2:33:18] not so that for you to compete with each
[2:33:20] other better who's where who's the more
[2:33:22] in advance whose arm or River later
[2:33:24] that's not what it's about it's a
[2:33:26] personal journey the Lord might reveal
[2:33:29] one thing to you today
[2:33:31] you might not be a patch on
[2:33:33] understanding things like somebody
[2:33:34] else's most about knowing him see being
[2:33:40] in his will where he wants you to be
[2:33:42] that's that's how you want to walk and
[2:33:49] so we want to I trust
[2:33:53] take these things go and think on these
[2:33:55] things get away from the kids get away
[2:33:59] from the husband wife some time now
[2:34:01] these things you cannot always do I'm
[2:34:04] talking about this private prayer you
[2:34:05] cannot always do it sometimes just not
[2:34:08] convenient but when there is the
[2:34:09] opportunity take it
[2:34:14] but there's opportunity this afternoon
[2:34:17] tonight for you whenever take it get
[2:34:21] alone with God maybe between Monday and
[2:34:24] Friday it's just you are just so busy as
[2:34:25] you are but when you get alone with God
[2:34:28] say Lord I have made my life so busy I
[2:34:32] have so many demands on me lord I cannot
[2:34:36] reengineer I cannot change it can I give
[2:34:38] you my full schedule and I'm asking that
[2:34:43] you were adjusted though I might have to
[2:34:48] work 12 hours a day and then sit with
[2:34:51] the kids and read them their stories and
[2:34:53] sit with a wife and talk to her and keep
[2:34:56] everybody happy Lord when I do all that
[2:34:59] I have no time a lord you reengineering
[2:35:01] so I have time this is why the prophets
[2:35:04] said if I could read this this quote
[2:35:06] about Martin Luther he says he was a man
[2:35:09] given too much prayer and he learned
[2:35:12] that the more work he had to do and the
[2:35:16] more solely he was pressed for time the
[2:35:18] more of his time he gave to God in
[2:35:21] prayer in order to ensure satisfactory
[2:35:25] results that is so not what we are
[2:35:29] taught the more that's required of you
[2:35:32] the tighter your schedule is spend more
[2:35:35] time in prayer just stay there to watch
[2:35:38] all that other stuff God supernaturally
[2:35:41] arranges it because what your desire God
[2:35:45] is first
[2:35:48] you honor me say at the water only you

[2:36:30] waited 10 years to get an answer but
[2:36:32] when it came it was so straightforward
[2:36:33] so simple how could I not see it
[2:36:35] we're all at different levels sometimes
[2:36:38] when we preach were preaching seeing the
[2:36:40] vision here but often the people are
[2:36:42] only at this level and they only see
[2:36:44] things that they're live you're seeing a
[2:36:46] greater picture but wait to spend time
[2:36:48] with the Lord let them raise you higher
