[38:09] made without an oath but this uh but
[38:12] this with an oath by him that said unto
[38:14] him the lord swear and will will not
[38:16] repent thou art a priest forever after
[38:19] the order of melchizedek by so much was
[38:21] jesus
[38:22] made a surety for a better testament as
[38:25] they truly were many priests because
[38:27] they were they were not suffered to
[38:30] continue by reason of death but this man
[38:32] i like those words but this man
[38:35] praise the lord because he continueth
[38:37] forever has an unchangeable priesthood
[38:40] wherefore he is able also to save them
[38:42] to the other most which come unto god by
[38:45] him seeing he ever liveth to make us
[38:47] intercession for them i think we should
[38:49] just shout around the building right now
[38:50] he's talking about what god has done for
[38:52] us i mean what the lord has done for as
[38:54] much as a high priest became us who is
[38:56] holy harmless undefiled separate from
[38:59] sinners and made higher than the heavens
[39:01] who needeth not daily as those high
[39:03] priests
[39:04] to offer up sacrifice first for his own
[39:06] sins and then for the peoples for this
[39:09] he died once when he offered up himself
[39:12] for the law maketh men high priests
[39:14] which which have infirmit um infirmity
[39:17] but the word of the oath which was since
[39:20] the law maketh the son who is
[39:22] consecrated forevermore

[40:58] made me rejoice but this man amen
[41:00] hallelujah our god is not an ordinary
[41:02] man
[41:03] praise the lord you know this man you
[41:05] know it's amazing i love i love the book
[41:07] of hebrews how the apostle paul makes
[41:09] such a contrast between the old
[41:11] testament law and this new and living
[41:13] way in which we are enjoying right now
[41:15] by the blood of jesus christ now if you
[41:17] think about you think about our lord
[41:18] jesus what a masterpiece of a man he was
[41:21] i mean there's no one like him upon the
[41:23] earth no one can stand in his shadow
[41:25] amen the prophets couldn't stand there
[41:27] no one no one can be like him there's no
[41:29] one there's no one like our jesus he's
[41:31] our jesus i mean he's our god amen and
[41:33] i'm so thankful that he's not just a god
[41:35] of history but he's the god of the
[41:37] present amen he's the same yesterday
[41:39] today and forever now we read there in
[41:42] in um in psalms here that it would say
[41:45] in the last uh verse 13 it says um you
[41:48] know consider her palaces you know her
[41:50] towers and so on that you may tell it to
[41:53] the generation following so there's a
[41:55] reason for that because you know um
[41:58] bulwarks and towers speak of a defense
[42:01] amen a palace speaks of a dwelling place
[42:03] and so we need to tell these things to a
[42:05] future generation you know the future
[42:07] generation must know that the lord jesus
[42:10] christ is supreme
[42:11] i mean he is supreme deity he's not part
[42:13] of the godhead he is the godhead i mean
[42:16] the fullness of god here body dwelt in
[42:17] the man the lord jesus christ and he is
[42:19] supreme deity there's not three gods or
[42:21] two there's one
[42:23] praise the lord now
[42:24] i'm so thankful our god is so great he
[42:26] become the last of the lord i remember
[42:29] standing in the poorest province of
[42:30] papua new guinea chimbu province and i
[42:33] was telling the people you know
[42:35] the lord jesus was homeless he didn't
[42:37] have a place to lay his head you know he
[42:39] says foxes have dens birds of nest but
[42:41] the son of man has no place to lay like
[42:43] leia said head and and they were so
[42:45] impacted by that here were people we
[42:47] would look at them and say they have
[42:48] nothing but they realized the lord
[42:50] became lower than them he became poorer
[42:53] than them amen and it's so just you know
[42:56] you so appreciate god what god the
[42:58] prophet says what god make what
[43:01] what makes god so great is that he can
[43:02] become so little
[43:04] amen
[43:06] praise the lord but but this man was a
[43:08] different kind of man he he looked like
[43:10] a common kind of man he looked like
[43:12] everyone else but he wasn't like
[43:14] everyone else i mean within his veins
[43:16] was the purchasing power of the whole
[43:18] world aiming to redeem adam's fallen
[43:20] race back to its rightful position amen
[43:23] within him was was the resurrection he
[43:25] is the resurrection in the life wasn't
[43:27] just part of a resurrection but he is
[43:28] the resurrection you know the prophet
[43:30] would tell us that that if he did not
[43:32] call lazarus by name when he stood
[43:34] before his two men said lazarus come
[43:36] forth there would have been a general
[43:37] resurrection because he is the
[43:38] resurrection in the life i mean all
[43:41] power is in his hands all power in
[43:42] heaven and earth is placed in his hands
[43:44] i mean there's no one beside him his
[43:46] enemies being defeated amen there's no
[43:48] one can withstand him he is the almighty
[43:50] god he sees through every situation
[43:52] there's no way you can lie to him you
[43:54] can hide nothing from him he sees
[43:55] through everything because the word of
[43:57] god is a discerner of the thoughts and
[43:59] things of the heart he has never been
[44:00] defeated he's never been conquered he's
[44:03] never fought to a draw he's never fought
[44:04] to a stalemate he's been victorious in
[44:06] every situation whether it was in a
[44:08] fiery furnace or in the flood or in a
[44:11] lion stand or in a prison wherever it
[44:13] was in a red sea around jericho god our
[44:16] god was victorious amen here's the
[44:18] alfred omega he is the almighty he's not
[44:21] just mighty he's the almighty amen he's
[44:23] the supreme one amen he's alpha and
[44:25] omega the beginning in the end his name
[44:27] is wonderful he's a counselor the prince
[44:29] of peace the mighty god amen he is the
[44:32] very lord of glory and he's our god this
[44:34] man but this man i mean but this man
[44:37] made a new and living way hallelujah he
[44:39] didn't just just reinstitute a
[44:40] priesthood of bloods of bulls and goats
[44:43] and just continuing on of perpetuating
[44:45] cycles of of life and death and sin and
[44:48] so ever more no no he came to break the
[44:50] cycle he came to break the cycle of sin
[44:53] amen we know the blood of bulls and
[44:54] goats could never ever take the desire
[44:56] for sin out of a person could never do
[44:58] it no matter how devout the person was
[45:00] house and see the person was
[45:02] it could never do it yeah i mean even
[45:04] you know even great men like david he
[45:06] said i uh you know i set the word of god
[45:08] ever before my face i was sitting out
[45:10] against him but then when he looked out
[45:11] of his window one day he saw bathsheba
[45:13] that all went to one side his carnal
[45:15] desires rose up and he took him we know
[45:17] the rest of the story even that man with
[45:20] his great desire that sin nature could
[45:22] be never taken away from by the blood of
[45:24] bulls and goats but this man
[45:26] i mean but this man he didn't just bring
[45:28] a lamb or a goat no no he was the lamb
[45:31] he was the lamb of god as john would say
[45:33] that taketh away the sin of the world
[45:35] hallelujah so he he didn't just cover up
[45:37] sin but he changed the nature of the of
[45:39] the believer i mean to take sins desire
[45:41] out of them
[45:42] praise the lord this man but this man
[45:45] remember remember the the the message of
[45:47] the hour unleashes the full power of the
[45:49] blood upon a people what's the full
[45:51] power of the blood we're going to be
[45:52] alive and remain and be changed
[45:55] hallelujah our bodies are going to be
[45:56] changed i mean so it's going to and you
[45:58] know it has brought the full power of
[46:00] calvary into manifestation
[46:02] hallelujah where once people would would
[46:05] would aim at becoming you know so like
[46:07] the apostle paul said in the book of
[46:08] ephesians he says you have believed you
[46:11] trusted and you're sealed to the day of
[46:13] your redemption but then come down to
[46:15] chapter four he says now he says now we
[46:17] must grow he says that you know he sent
[46:19] the five-fold ministry until we all come
[46:21] to the statue of the fullness of christ
[46:23] right so he said and he says now so so
[46:25] they were aiming at that they were
[46:27] believers in the kingdom but they are
[46:29] aiming at growing into the fullness of
[46:30] the statue of christ but we know that
[46:32] the word ephesus means aimed at and
[46:35] relaxed but aim at but to relax so they
[46:37] aimed at it but because the anointing on
[46:39] the age was actually they that that
[46:41] church had to go eventually down to the
[46:43] dark ages died and come forth in a
[46:45] reformation or restoration they could
[46:47] aim it but they couldn't become
[46:49] right but in this age the cycle is
[46:51] broken i mean we're not here just to aim
[46:53] at become the fullness of the statue of
[46:55] christ no we're here to step into it i
[46:57] mean that's why the word the message is
[46:59] released to power in this day i mean
[47:01] that would manifest i mean that
[47:04] promise in you and i's life
[47:06] i mean that's why there's power in the
[47:08] seven thunders which is the revelation
[47:09] of the seven seals because there's a
[47:11] power withheld within god but it's it's
[47:13] always released in his word and those
[47:15] those thunders were held up john was
[47:17] about to write it it was going to be
[47:18] released but god said seal it up until
[47:20] the time of the end when knowledge shall
[47:22] run to and fro of knowledge shall your
[47:23] people shall travel to and from
[47:25] knowledge shall increase that's from
[47:26] daniel chapter 12. because we know
[47:28] within god's word when he releases a
[47:29] word he releases a power
[47:31] right so under the power of the law
[47:33] under the blood of bulls and goats i
[47:35] mean it gave josh your power to take his
[47:37] mountain it gave i mean caleb to take
[47:39] his mountain it gave josh your power i
[47:42] mean to make the sun and the moon stand
[47:43] still
[47:44] it gave israel power that they would
[47:46] take their promised land it gave them
[47:49] power it gave david power that he had
[47:51] killed the lion he'd killed the bear who
[47:53] killed goliath and that came against him
[47:55] it gave them power to destroy their
[47:57] enemy i mean it gave gideon and the 300
[47:59] power to destroy that whole host of the
[48:01] midianites it gave them power to do it
[48:04] but it did not under the in that word
[48:07] was not a power to change sin nature
[48:09] right but jesus when he would take the
[48:12] um the last supper he he would hold up
[48:15] the cup he says this is the new
[48:16] testament in my blood
[48:18] i mean so now there was a paranormal
[48:20] word because the new testament's in my
[48:22] blood we read it it's an it's an incan
[48:24] you know paper form but it was in him
[48:26] but it had to be released
[48:28] right so now there was a power within
[48:30] him that could not be released until he
[48:32] went to calvary to purchase it
[48:34] praise the lord because remember in god
[48:36] there's all power right he's not limited
[48:37] in power he's unlimited in power right
[48:40] but but he releases his power in certain
[48:42] seasons to achieve a certain goal
[48:45] and in this age it's
[48:46] rapture hallelujah remember he doesn't
[48:49] have to purchase the rapture he's
[48:50] already purchased it but he's got to
[48:51] release the fullness of the holy ghost
[48:53] upon the people i mean to break a cycle
[48:55] of of
[48:56] life and death that will step from this
[48:58] world to the next world
[49:00] this man but this man
[49:02] amen he's done it all for us
[49:05] hallelujah
[49:06] amen
[49:08] i like the i love the story of arnold
[49:10] von winkler
[49:12] i love it very much it always always
[49:14] moves me
[49:15] where where back in the uh early swiss
[49:18] confederacy days you know the austrians
[49:20] invaded and and you know they weren't
[49:22] they weren't a trained army like the
[49:23] austrians they were just farmers
[49:25] but then but then you know
[49:27] they they rallied together and they were
[49:29] going to try and fight the austrians and
[49:30] and in reality they didn't have the
[49:32] ability to to to beat them
[49:34] and then a little man called arnold von
[49:36] winkler stood up maybe he was a little
[49:38] man because maybe he was a little man
[49:39] but anyway he stood up
[49:41] and and and and they would ask him what
[49:43] are you going to do tomorrow he says
[49:44] today tomorrow i'm going to die for
[49:46] switzerland
[49:47] and they will move by what he's going to
[49:48] say says over in the other valley
[49:50] there's my family there's my wife and my
[49:52] children and i'm going to i'm going to
[49:53] never see them again
[49:54] i'm going to give my life and i said
[49:56] what are you going to do he says i'm
[49:57] going to just follow me and fight with
[49:59] what you got
[50:00] and just and just him saying that so so
[50:02] so rallied the swiss
[50:04] amen where he found the thickest part of
[50:06] the austrian spears and him and he
[50:07] needed to scream make way for liberty
[50:09] make way for liberty anything that god
[50:11] in his way had to get out of the way i
[50:13] mean but he made a path through those
[50:14] spears where he grabbed them the prophet
[50:16] tells us the you know the story tells us
[50:18] that he pulled them into his into his
[50:20] chest and it made a gap in the formation
[50:22] the austrians and the swiss just plowed
[50:24] in there broke their ranks and they won
[50:25] the day i mean that was a great that was
[50:28] a great that was a great achievement
[50:30] that was a great feat of heroism i mean
[50:32] but this man
[50:33] i mean but this man found the thickest
[50:35] wall of the spares of death amen of hell
[50:38] he says make way for liberty amen god
[50:41] god knew that adam's fallen race was
[50:42] against the wall amen we couldn't keep
[50:44] the ceremonies we couldn't keep the
[50:46] offerings we couldn't keep the law we
[50:48] couldn't do it it doesn't matter how
[50:49] devout how sincere we could never keep
[50:51] it
[50:52] i mean it's a he so it's a one step from
[50:54] the portals of glory
[50:55] his name is jesus i mean he stepped down
[50:58] he says i'm going to redeem adam's
[50:59] fallen race amen he found where the
[51:02] death where the stinger of death was
[51:04] amen and he attracted that buzzy bee
[51:07] it was buzzing around it stung moses he
[51:09] died i mean it stung a lot you know
[51:11] you're staying elisha stung all the
[51:12] prophets down through apart from you
[51:14] know elijah and different ones but you
[51:16] know
[51:17] everyone had to taste death
[51:19] because because the stinger of death
[51:21] would sting into someone and then the
[51:22] stinger would come out but this man was
[51:25] made of different stuff
[51:26] i mean this man was the one who could
[51:28] rip the stinger out
[51:29] hallelujah so he's buzzing around
[51:31] calvary amen and just in my little mind
[51:34] i just see the
[51:35] you know bee of death you know come and
[51:37] put a stinger in then an unseen hand
[51:39] comes and grabs it
[51:41] says this is mine now
[51:42] hallelujah and then and then and then he
[51:44] tries to pull it and he just rips it out
[51:46] of himself you know i mean but but our
[51:48] lord jesus still got that stinger of
[51:49] death that's why jesus and that's why
[51:51] paul could say death whereas i sting
[51:53] brave where is thy victory but thanks be
[51:56] to god who gives us the victory amen
[51:58] hallelujah amen sorry our lord jesus
[52:00] raised up he plunged himself into the
[52:02] darkest myths of what man ever feared
[52:04] which was death and he conquered it
[52:06] then he ascended on high amen he never
[52:09] sent down a declaration of theological
[52:12] faith he sent back the holy spirit said
[52:14] take this and fight with everything that
[52:15] you got within you
[52:17] take this and follow me pardon me as the
[52:20] father has sent me so send are you and
[52:22] the father sent him went with him
[52:24] and went in him and when he sent us he
[52:28] comes with us he's in us men and women
[52:30] what we need today is not our names on a
[52:32] church book which is perfectly all right
[52:34] but we need to pick up that powerful
[52:36] weapon of the holy spirit in our heart
[52:38] which changes our innermost being and
[52:40] makes us new creatures in christ jesus
[52:42] and wipes the way through the sinful
[52:45] world by the righteousness and power of
[52:47] the resurrection of jesus christ that's
[52:50] what we need that's what the church
[52:51] needs not a face lifting or a bunch of
[52:53] new members but revive what we've got
[52:55] and fill with the holy ghost and set out
[52:58] to fight the enemy to pray for the sick
[53:00] heal the sick cast out devils freely you
[53:02] receive freely give these signs shall
[53:04] follow them that believe christ
[53:06] put into the heart of man into the hand
[53:09] of man the strongest weapon that was
[53:11] ever put to human beings was the baptism
[53:13] of the holy spirit a new heart a new
[53:15] spirit and i'll put my spirit in there
[53:17] and win and then fight with what's in
[53:19] you until death shall set you free
[53:22] that's brother brown and the
[53:23] impersonation of of of christianity
[53:27] amen our lord jesus didn't just give us
[53:29] something to debate about
[53:32] this message is not something just to
[53:33] argue about this message is is to be
[53:36] lived
[53:36] i mean where god would put on flesh and
[53:38] a people and every promise he's given to
[53:41] the bride will be manifested in her
[53:43] amen our lord as i said in the beginning
[53:46] what made god so great is as he he
[53:49] became so little
[53:50] and brother brown would give a story in
[53:52] the in the message the mighty god are
[53:54] available for us he says you know he was
[53:56] reading a story some years ago and it
[53:57] was or some great noble king
[54:00] and you know his princes loved him his
[54:02] guards loved him all these different
[54:04] things but one day he made a decision
[54:06] because he was a great lover of his
[54:07] subjects
[54:08] and and and he called us gathers royalty
[54:11] into his throne room he says today you
[54:13] see me as king for the last time for
[54:16] many years and they're very troubled
[54:18] they say good king why would you say
[54:20] that you know you're going to a foreign
[54:21] country or are you going to become an
[54:23] alien somewhere he says no i'm going to
[54:25] stay right here
[54:26] i'm going to go out among my subjects
[54:28] i'm going to become a peasant i'm going
[54:30] to cut wood with the wood chopper i'm
[54:32] going to till the ground with the toilet
[54:33] i'm going to prune the vines with those
[54:35] who prune the vines i'm going to be one
[54:37] of them in order to be better acquainted
[54:39] with what they're doing and i love them
[54:42] and i want to be more acquainted with
[54:43] them personally they they won't know me
[54:46] but yet i want to be acquainted with
[54:47] them in that way
[54:49] and the next morning you know he he took
[54:51] off his crown his great robes put on
[54:53] peasant robes and he went down amongst
[54:56] the common people and brother brahm says
[54:59] now in that little story we find out
[55:01] then
[55:02] about god
[55:04] where because he became so great
[55:06] by becoming so little
[55:08] i mean that he put on humanity that he
[55:11] would understand the frailty of humanity
[55:14] he would understand when we're troubled
[55:16] he would understand our burdens he'd
[55:17] understand what it's like to be sick
[55:19] he'd understand what it's like to lose
[55:20] loved ones he would understand
[55:23] everything we go through
[55:25] and he did it that you would know he
[55:27] understands
[55:28] every trial every hardship
[55:31] every question
[55:33] every what seems to be unanswered prayer
[55:35] he understands it
[55:37] amen he was acquainted with grief he
[55:39] bore our sorrows
[55:41] praise the lord he knows everything
[55:42] about us amen we may think he may not
[55:44] understand but he understands
[55:46] he knows what it's like to be sick he
[55:48] knows what it's like to be troubled he
[55:50] knows what it's like to be vexed amen he
[55:52] he understands it remember he was so if
[55:55] i could say that word vex there in the
[55:57] garden of eden it was like blood blood
[55:59] dripped from him
[56:00] he's so troubled but he made that great
[56:02] decision to me i think well i couldn't
[56:05] find the quote but brother brown said
[56:06] somewhere that was the masterpiece in
[56:08] the garden
[56:09] in another garden the garden of
[56:11] gethsemane
[56:12] where he became such a masterpiece that
[56:14] he said not my will but thy will be done
[56:18] amen
[56:19] amen so he understands what we go
[56:21] through
[56:22] he understands our troubles he
[56:24] understands amen because he became one
[56:26] of us
[56:27] praise the lord are you glad you ever
[56:29] you serve a god that understands he's
[56:31] not somewhere somewhere distant in
[56:33] heaven somewhere and he's trying to put
[56:35] himself in your shoes he's been in our
[56:37] shoes
[56:38] praise the lord
[56:40] amen now i said in the beginning
[56:44] that
[56:46] we have to tell the next the future
[56:48] generations about zion's
[56:50] towers and their bull works and
[56:52] different inner palaces
[56:54] because
[56:55] we've got to understand that every
[56:56] generation will fight the same enemy
[56:58] that enemy may be rebranded just like
[57:01] you take spark used to be telecom
[57:03] same company
[57:05] different branding
[57:06] they still are in telecommunications
[57:08] maybe the phones aren't dumb anymore but
[57:11] it's still phones
[57:12] it's still connecting people so it's
[57:14] like the devil it's actually the same
[57:15] deal but he just rebrands himself
[57:18] every generation you take the spirit of
[57:20] rock and roll in the beatles it's now
[57:22] evolved
[57:23] to i don't know who's trending right now
[57:26] that person
[57:27] right so it's gone from the rolling
[57:29] stones and the beatles different ones
[57:31] and they just evolved the same spirit
[57:34] just rebranded
[57:36] amen just like you know
[57:38] peer pressure that spirit is just
[57:40] rebranded now it's on social media
[57:43] now it's on the internet people have
[57:44] virtual lives so they can't just escape
[57:46] from even peer pressure you know there's
[57:48] there's you know there's virtual
[57:50] bullying and so on online bullying
[57:51] what's that peer pressure same devil
[57:54] just rebranded a little bit
[57:56] so
[57:57] it's the same devil
[58:00] that every generation fights now the
[58:02] next generation may think that the older
[58:04] generation doesn't understand what it's
[58:05] going through now brother ram said that
[58:07] actually
[58:08] the world gets 10 times worse
[58:11] he would say i think it's a blushing
[58:12] prophet i might be wrong about the
[58:14] sermon but he says you know the world is
[58:16] 10 times worse now for your children
[58:17] than when we were young
[58:20] it's the same devil but he's just he's
[58:22] just
[58:23] if i can say i can't say bigger because
[58:24] he doesn't get bigger but you know it
[58:26] just it just gets more stronger in a way
[58:28] but remember god is way stronger than
[58:30] every enemy
[58:31] but
[58:32] i think what happens is as the younger
[58:35] generation doesn't unders thinks we
[58:37] don't understand what they go through
[58:39] but we can say no that devil just got
[58:41] rebranded
[58:42] we fought it when it was
[58:44] uh telecom not the talent but i'm just
[58:47] using that example
[58:48] okay you know now it's sparked but you
[58:50] know it's the same thing it doesn't
[58:51] maybe the technology's changed its face
[58:53] may be different
[58:55] from a brick phone to a smartphone but
[58:57] it's still a phone if you know what i
[58:58] mean so so it may look different but the
[59:00] spirit behind it's the same
[59:02] and so every generation
[59:05] uh fights the same enemies but the thing
[59:07] is if we can realize actually the enemy
[59:09] they like my children the spirits they
[59:12] are fighting i fought
[59:14] they've just rebranded themselves and
[59:16] vice versa because i think if we can if
[59:19] we can relate or think actually my
[59:21] parents actually would understand what
[59:22] i'm going through
[59:24] then then there's not a cut in
[59:25] communication
[59:27] right or saying i have a need or this
[59:28] you know so that's it but it says in
[59:30] judges maybe you want to put this up
[59:32] brother andy or whoever's quick on the
[59:33] trigger back there uh judges three and
[59:35] one and we'll read down to verse four
[59:42] because there's a reason why because you
[59:44] know you think sometimes joshua goes
[59:46] takes the land you think why there why
[59:47] are there these enemies still in the
[59:49] land
[59:50] he says now these are the nations which
[59:52] the lord left now there's a reason why
[59:54] god allows things to be there
[59:56] to prove israel by them for as many of
[59:59] israel as had not known all the wars of
[1:00:02] canaan so there was a generation after
[1:00:04] the wars of canaan that didn't know war
[1:00:06] for example they were not alive or even
[1:00:09] adults when caleb took his mountain
[1:00:12] but maybe they just born there maybe
[1:00:13] they just came later after the battle
[1:00:15] was done with the you know with their
[1:00:17] mothers they and and they just inhabited
[1:00:19] it so they weren't actually part of the
[1:00:21] fight
[1:00:22] right they were not part of that fight
[1:00:23] they were the next generation coming but
[1:00:26] every generation had to know what it was
[1:00:28] like to fight a war
[1:00:30] now only the generations so
[1:00:33] we're in verse 2 now there we are only
[1:00:35] that the generations of the children of
[1:00:37] israel might know
[1:00:39] to teach them war at the least such as
[1:00:42] before
[1:00:43] knew nothing thereof so the lord left
[1:00:46] these ones in the land that the next
[1:00:48] generations would know how to fight
[1:00:50] amen because every generation
[1:00:53] we're soldiers
[1:00:55] we're not peacekeepers we're soldiers
[1:00:58] amen so so the enemy is allowed to come
[1:01:01] against us or come against our children
[1:01:03] that they would know how to fight
[1:01:06] but we need to teach them to war
[1:01:08] right remember we are not here just to
[1:01:11] you know
[1:01:11] put people out on the battlefield they
[1:01:13] have no training you know you've never
[1:01:15] ever seen an army in your right mind
[1:01:17] send them into battle with no training
[1:01:18] they don't know how to use their
[1:01:19] equipment they don't know how to
[1:01:21] communicate they don't know what they're
[1:01:22] capable of they don't know how to fight
[1:01:24] as a unit and different things you'd
[1:01:26] never do that you you're setting them up
[1:01:28] to fail
[1:01:29] we don't want to set our children up to
[1:01:31] fail
[1:01:32] right we want to equip them with the
[1:01:34] best
[1:01:36] amen with the very best equipment amen
[1:01:38] that they would know what it does they
[1:01:39] know what they're capable of
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:43] amen to teach them war at the least as
[1:01:45] such as before knew nothing thereof
[1:01:48] namely the five lords of the philistines
[1:01:50] uh where yeah thank you there um and and
[1:01:52] all the canaanites and the sidonians and
[1:01:54] the highways that dwell in mount lebanon
[1:01:56] from mount baal hermann um unto the
[1:01:59] entering inn of hamath
[1:02:01] and they were to prove israel by them to
[1:02:04] know whether they would hearken unto the
[1:02:05] commandments of the lord which he had
[1:02:07] commanded their fathers by the hand of
[1:02:10] moses so an enemy comes in
[1:02:13] to test you will you hearken will you
[1:02:15] lean upon the word and trust it trust
[1:02:17] him or we try and fight another way
[1:02:20] amen so you know we want to be such that
[1:02:23] you know the word is our standing orders
[1:02:26] right that we become so
[1:02:28] one with the word that actually what you
[1:02:31] read in the you know this is like a
[1:02:33] battlefield manual we know it's a love
[1:02:35] letter but it's many things
[1:02:37] this is the battlefield manual
[1:02:39] we become such soldiers that we embody
[1:02:41] this
[1:02:42] right that our training everything that
[1:02:44] we you know it just becomes flesh
[1:02:48] amen that we would know when the enemy
[1:02:50] comes against us we know how to deal
[1:02:52] with them
[1:02:53] we know what our equipment does this is
[1:02:55] why zion was told tell the future
[1:02:57] generations about your towers and your
[1:02:59] palaces your bulwarks your your your
[1:03:01] fortifications the palace is where the
[1:03:03] king dwells
[1:03:04] tell the future generations about this
[1:03:06] because they need to know
[1:03:08] i mean because remember we are not here
[1:03:10] defenseless
[1:03:11] we're not here hopeless we're not here
[1:03:14] just just scraping in by the skin of our
[1:03:16] teeth no no we're overcomers i mean but
[1:03:18] in order to be an overcomer you've got
[1:03:20] to overcome something amen an overcomer
[1:03:23] remember an army on the parade ground
[1:03:26] that's never been tested is not
[1:03:27] victorious it's not invincible maybe on
[1:03:30] paper it's invincible but it's after the
[1:03:32] army goes through a campaign or they go
[1:03:34] through a war maybe they lose some
[1:03:36] battles but they come out packing the
[1:03:38] victory amen remember we are the bride
[1:03:41] as an invincible army
[1:03:42] but in order to be invincible there's
[1:03:44] got to be some fights there's got to be
[1:03:46] some skirmishes there's going to be some
[1:03:47] close run battles amen but i believe by
[1:03:50] our god we'll win everyone
[1:03:52] hallelujah that it remembers not that
[1:03:54] him that wins the war it's him that no
[1:03:56] so it's not him that wins the battle
[1:03:57] counts
[1:03:58] or or or rights history or is the victor
[1:04:01] it's him that wins the war or her that
[1:04:03] wins the war amen you can look in world
[1:04:05] war ii the allies back was against the
[1:04:08] wall but they didn't they didn't lose
[1:04:10] they won amen sometimes our backs will
[1:04:13] be against the wall how we gonna how
[1:04:15] we're gonna overcome this lord help us
[1:04:17] i'm in dire straits but remember god
[1:04:19] knows tomorrow
[1:04:20] amen and it's not remember your current
[1:04:22] state is not your final destination
[1:04:25] i mean that is not your fix this is just
[1:04:27] how it's going to be you know winston
[1:04:28] churchill was built such a way he knew
[1:04:30] that the wall was you know they were in
[1:04:32] great trouble they had nothing to fight
[1:04:34] the enemy with he you know secretly a
[1:04:36] tellers cabinet you know where muzzle
[1:04:38] that's just paraphrasing but he
[1:04:39] basically said you know we might as well
[1:04:40] just drink all the whiskey throw the
[1:04:42] bottles at them they had nothing to
[1:04:43] fight
[1:04:44] when they when they evacuated the troops
[1:04:46] from dunkirk that you know all those
[1:04:47] things they lost all their heavy
[1:04:49] equipment there they had nothing to
[1:04:50] fight the only way reason that england
[1:04:52] stood is because of the channel
[1:04:54] that was the only reason but but
[1:04:56] publicly he never said those things he
[1:04:57] said we'll fight them on the beaches
[1:04:59] we'll fight them and the hedgerows will
[1:05:00] never surrender one of his most famous
[1:05:02] famous speeches i think yeah you can
[1:05:04] find it on the internet he would tell i
[1:05:06] think it was a school he just stood
[1:05:07] there maybe maybe the school was under
[1:05:10] expectation of some great oratory of
[1:05:11] some great motivational speech he just
[1:05:14] said never give up
[1:05:16] never give up amen never give up
[1:05:19] amen that's all he said that was a
[1:05:21] speech sometimes it's just the simple
[1:05:23] things that really matter i'll say never
[1:05:24] give up
[1:05:26] keep fighting
[1:05:27] never give up
[1:05:28] this is not the end amen this is not the
[1:05:31] end amen the devil doesn't know the end
[1:05:33] our god knows the end amen remember our
[1:05:36] god said that my thoughts are towards
[1:05:38] you of peace that you'll come to an
[1:05:40] expected end remember he said his
[1:05:41] thoughts not his opinion not that god
[1:05:43] has an opinion but his thoughts are
[1:05:45] before the foundation of the world i saw
[1:05:47] you on streets of gold being an
[1:05:49] overcomer rejoicing in the victory that
[1:05:51] i won for you that down calvary and then
[1:05:54] rejoicing in the victory that you had
[1:05:56] going through later sia i mean that's
[1:05:58] what he thought about you that you'd
[1:05:59] come to an expected end i mean that
[1:06:01] expected end is not the lake of fire
[1:06:03] it's not the great tribulation it's a
[1:06:05] rapture amen it is it is going to a
[1:06:07] wedding supper that's your expected end
[1:06:10] hallelujah that's why i say never give
[1:06:12] up
[1:06:13] amen this memo wherever you are right
[1:06:15] now this is not the end of the battle
[1:06:17] this is not the end of the war you may
[1:06:19] be oh how's this ever going to happen no
[1:06:21] you're not at the end of the war
[1:06:23] i mean the war is not finished amen
[1:06:26] hallelujah
[1:06:28] hallelujah
[1:06:29] amen there's been a lot of
[1:06:31] dire straits you know in history of
[1:06:33] warfare
[1:06:34] i remember it says it's really rally
[1:06:36] it's not the um
[1:06:38] you know
[1:06:39] it's not the
[1:06:41] size of the dog in the fight
[1:06:43] it's the size of the fight in the dog i
[1:06:46] remember brother martin topping
[1:06:47] christchurch he told me once upon a time
[1:06:49] he had this little corgi and that thing
[1:06:51] would take on anything
[1:06:53] that just had one move jump jugular rip
[1:06:55] that was it
[1:06:57] anyway but but
[1:06:59] corgis aren't big it would take on
[1:07:00] anything it wasn't afraid of nothing
[1:07:04] you know we may look little
[1:07:06] but it's not the size of the dog in the
[1:07:08] fight it's the size of the fight in the
[1:07:11] dog and you when you realize that the
[1:07:13] dog in the fight and you
[1:07:15] as the lord jesus christ
[1:07:17] amen where where he overcame hell
[1:07:20] death the grave culture prejudice
[1:07:24] you know bad reputation people put on
[1:07:26] being illegitimately born and you know
[1:07:29] he he overcame superstition he overcame
[1:07:31] unbelief he overcame trouble amen he
[1:07:33] overcame satan himself he overcame all
[1:07:36] things that same one is in you
[1:07:39] that same one is in you if he has
[1:07:41] overcome
[1:07:42] you've got to recognize that and you've
[1:07:44] got to recognize the one in you has
[1:07:46] already overcome that spirit that you're
[1:07:48] fighting
[1:07:50] amen now that's really overcoming the
[1:07:51] prophet would tell us
[1:07:53] hallelujah
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:57] so we live in this great hour
[1:08:00] without god but this man
[1:08:03] our lord jesus himself
[1:08:05] we don't follow a prophet we follow god
[1:08:08] we follow jesus christ the word amen
[1:08:11] amen
[1:08:12] we are following
[1:08:14] the supreme one
[1:08:16] he never lost a battle i want to i just
[1:08:18] want to remind you of these things
[1:08:20] our god is supreme
[1:08:22] amen he has never gone into a fight and
[1:08:25] come out licking his wounds
[1:08:28] hallelujah
[1:08:29] he is victorious in everything now the
[1:08:31] weapons we have are the greatest weapons
[1:08:34] even now the um
[1:08:36] australians are you know signed a pact
[1:08:38] with the uk and and and america about
[1:08:41] developing hypersonic missiles
[1:08:44] because they try because there's an arms
[1:08:45] race going on people looking for a
[1:08:47] competitive edge they're looking for
[1:08:49] something that they can tilt the balance
[1:08:51] in their favor
[1:08:52] we have that
[1:08:54] we have what we need to tilt the balance
[1:08:56] in our favor
[1:08:57] and the thing is this ain't an arms race
[1:09:00] because the devil can't produce a weapon
[1:09:02] that can beat you
[1:09:03] there's nothing he can do that can
[1:09:05] defeat the word of god there's no weapon
[1:09:07] he can remember no weapon formed against
[1:09:09] he shall prosper it says in isaiah no
[1:09:11] weapon amen so he may fashion a lot of
[1:09:14] weapons thinking this thing will give me
[1:09:15] the competitive edge in the fight but it
[1:09:17] won't prosper
[1:09:19] that's what the word says i mean you've
[1:09:20] got to realize the thing that you're
[1:09:22] facing you'll say satan
[1:09:24] my god told me no weapon formed against
[1:09:27] me shall prosper you may form weapons
[1:09:30] but you're just wasting your time
[1:09:32] and you're just going to walk out
[1:09:33] disappointed i mean you think it may get
[1:09:35] me but it can't get me because nowhere
[1:09:37] performed against me shall prosper
[1:09:40] amen it says and i in isaiah remember
[1:09:42] it's important to take those kind of
[1:09:43] promises and realize that there's no
[1:09:45] weapon formed against the shall prosper
[1:09:48] hallelujah
[1:09:50] amen now our armor
[1:09:52] is supernatural
[1:09:54] it's not natural there's nothing natural
[1:09:56] about you
[1:09:57] we're all supernatural
[1:09:59] the bride is a supernatural people amen
[1:10:02] even even putting on the whole armor of
[1:10:04] god
[1:10:05] it's not saying a prayer of now put on
[1:10:06] the helmet of salvation and the good
[1:10:08] about the loins with truth and different
[1:10:10] things no it's the baptism of the holy
[1:10:12] ghost
[1:10:13] that's what the that's what the whole
[1:10:15] armor is
[1:10:16] brother ram says and take on the whole
[1:10:18] armor of god think i act funny maybe i
[1:10:20] am but i've lost my mind to the world
[1:10:21] and found it in christ let the mind that
[1:10:23] was in christ bearing you takes the
[1:10:25] baptism of the holy ghost the whole
[1:10:27] armor of god not just to shake hands
[1:10:29] with the preacher put your name on a
[1:10:30] book or take some kosher and swallow it
[1:10:32] and the priest drink up the wine that
[1:10:35] isn't it but brother stay there until
[1:10:37] there comes a rushing mighty wind that
[1:10:39] fills all your being
[1:10:41] takes all your doubts out takes all your
[1:10:42] creature out takes everything else out
[1:10:44] and puts the word in there with the
[1:10:46] power of god behind it to back it up
[1:10:48] gloria i feel real good amen god said so
[1:10:51] it's the holy ghost
[1:10:53] hallelujah
[1:10:55] amen now brother brahms asked a question
[1:10:57] this is in 1964.
[1:10:59] question is the answer is number one he
[1:11:01] says dear brother branham do you believe
[1:11:03] that signs shall follow all the all that
[1:11:04] have the holy ghost he says jesus said
[1:11:06] so mark 16. the question continues if so
[1:11:09] what about the people who believe the
[1:11:11] message with all that's in them yet they
[1:11:13] not have these signs are they
[1:11:15] unbelievers or do they need the holy
[1:11:16] spirit if so please instruct us today
[1:11:19] how to receive the holy ghost we believe
[1:11:21] you are god's mouthpiece for our day
[1:11:23] your brother he says thank you my
[1:11:25] brother for regarding me as your brother
[1:11:27] and i think that's a very good question
[1:11:29] friends yes it is a little slack i'd
[1:11:31] like to deal a little longer on that if
[1:11:33] i could see
[1:11:34] it is slack look some of you
[1:11:37] when you cannot receive the baptism of
[1:11:38] the holy ghost without having experience
[1:11:40] when it happens now if you believe every
[1:11:42] speck of the word you say you believe
[1:11:44] every speck of it then the word is
[1:11:46] laying in there waiting for the holy
[1:11:48] ghost to put it to work but it takes the
[1:11:51] lighting of the candle
[1:11:53] this is so fundamental
[1:11:55] it takes the lighting of the candle
[1:11:57] here's the candle with the wick in it
[1:11:59] and with all the tallow and everything
[1:12:00] it has to have in that candle but until
[1:12:03] the fire comes on it it will not shine
[1:12:05] any light no matter how perfect the
[1:12:08] candle is and how perfect it will burn
[1:12:10] and everything it's got to be litten and
[1:12:12] when it burns and when you believe and
[1:12:14] are made up of the instructions of what
[1:12:16] the holy spirit is love joy peace long
[1:12:19] suffering goodness the fruits of it
[1:12:20] bears out until the holy spirit with a
[1:12:23] fiery experience comes down and lights
[1:12:25] that candle
[1:12:26] then you haven't received the holy
[1:12:28] ghosty you've got to have the experience
[1:12:31] to have the holy ghost
[1:12:33] so it's not something we just grow into
[1:12:35] you've got to really meet god you can be
[1:12:37] the perfect candle there is you can
[1:12:39] quote every scripture every every part
[1:12:41] of the message but there needs a
[1:12:42] lighting of the candle
[1:12:44] amen but if your candle's been lit whose
[1:12:46] candle's been lit amen in the holy ghost
[1:12:49] is in power manifesting in your life now
[1:12:51] i don't know what kind of experience
[1:12:52] you'll have but you'll know you've met
[1:12:54] god
[1:12:55] i mean you'll know you've met him some
[1:12:56] you know some way can be manifested in
[1:12:58] different ways but there'll be a
[1:12:59] difference in your life
[1:13:01] i mean when now now you actually have
[1:13:03] the armor of god on the inside the
[1:13:05] baptism of the holy ghost now you can go
[1:13:07] out in power and realize nothing can
[1:13:09] stand before you amen if you stay fully
[1:13:12] surrendered to god remember the prophet
[1:13:14] said that a man can be so surrendered to
[1:13:16] god that even the devil doesn't know
[1:13:18] what to do with him
[1:13:20] amen i sent this sickness i sent this
[1:13:22] trouble against him i sent this trouble
[1:13:24] this problem and their family this
[1:13:25] without the family this and the church
[1:13:27] this and his job you know
[1:13:29] and then the devil comes back and says i
[1:13:31] just i don't know what to do with this
[1:13:33] guy
[1:13:34] he just he just stays surrendered to the
[1:13:35] lord he doesn't rise up in his carnality
[1:13:38] he just continues on what can i do with
[1:13:40] them
[1:13:41] amen we can live that kind of life we
[1:13:43] can live that kind of life amen remember
[1:13:45] remember a lamb or a sheep amen forfeits
[1:13:47] all its rights
[1:13:49] amen it doesn't kick it just it just
[1:13:51] shaved me off lord
[1:13:53] amen for your glory
[1:13:56] hallelujah so now
[1:13:58] friends
[1:14:00] every generation must know how to fight
[1:14:03] but uh i'm telling you this we have the
[1:14:06] equipment
[1:14:07] this word
[1:14:08] this whole armor of god we have it
[1:14:12] this is not something we're looking for
[1:14:13] we have the best weapons
[1:14:15] we've won the arms race
[1:14:17] remember if you fully strengthen the
[1:14:18] lord the lord changes your life you've
[1:14:20] won the game of life
[1:14:22] amen now it's just growing in maturity
[1:14:24] growing in character until the lord
[1:14:25] takes you home
[1:14:27] hallelujah but we need to tell our
[1:14:29] children we need to tell each other how
[1:14:31] good god is
[1:14:32] how great this tower is
[1:14:34] that we can run into in a safe the name
[1:14:36] of the lord is a strong tower the
[1:14:38] righteous run into in a safe who's ever
[1:14:40] run into that tower i mean you've been
[1:14:42] distressed on every hand but then you
[1:14:44] turn to the lord and say lord i must be
[1:14:46] hid away in you amen you find yourself
[1:14:49] feeling you may still be in the trial
[1:14:51] but there's just a peace comes in
[1:14:53] amen you run into that tower and you're
[1:14:55] safe you say oh lord how great you are
[1:14:57] as a city of refuge
[1:14:59] hallelujah
[1:15:00] amen then you can say how great his
[1:15:02] palaces are
[1:15:03] amen where he steps in when he stepped
[1:15:05] into your life it's important that we
[1:15:07] rehearse these things
[1:15:08] to one another to our children when god
[1:15:10] became real where they can see it's more
[1:15:12] than more than rules and regulations
[1:15:15] more than just abiding by a creed not
[1:15:17] that we believe in creatures some people
[1:15:19] could just so line up with the word but
[1:15:20] there's no life in there right we don't
[1:15:22] want to be that kind of thing but
[1:15:24] they've got to see a love they've got to
[1:15:25] see a reality they've got to see a life
[1:15:27] i love the lord this is not a dreary
[1:15:29] life this is not a burden this is a joy
[1:15:32] this is such a great joy i'm so glad the
[1:15:34] lord found me amen i'm so glad that he
[1:15:37] met me save me i know what amazing grace
[1:15:39] is
[1:15:40] it became amazing amen when he met me
[1:15:44] hallelujah
[1:15:45] amen it is a joy to serve the lord
[1:15:48] amen burdens now a lighter brighter is
[1:15:50] my way it is such a joy to walk with him
[1:15:53] isn't it so good you can be in the worst
[1:15:54] part of your life you say lord
[1:15:57] i'm with you
[1:15:58] hallelujah and it's not you holding his
[1:16:01] hand he's holding your hand
[1:16:02] i've got you i've got you in this
[1:16:04] trouble i've got you in the what does it
[1:16:06] oh it's real dark in here don't worry
[1:16:08] he's right there just like brother brown
[1:16:10] would say uh um it's an um there's a man
[1:16:13] standing prison that can turn on the
[1:16:15] light now i remember going there in cape
[1:16:17] town there's the
[1:16:18] fort of good hope it's the starfall
[1:16:20] there in cape town and we went on a tour
[1:16:22] i was six or seven and we went down to
[1:16:23] this into this dungeon and the guy
[1:16:26] turned off the light it's pitch black
[1:16:28] and they said there were prisoners in
[1:16:29] here hundreds of years ago whenever and
[1:16:31] they and they lost their sight they're
[1:16:32] in there so long it was it was it was
[1:16:34] you could feel the blackness it was so
[1:16:36] dark never been in such a dark place and
[1:16:38] brother bam said like there's a place
[1:16:40] like that and there was a family there
[1:16:42] and then you know the tour guide turned
[1:16:43] off the light and the little sister just
[1:16:45] started screaming
[1:16:46] but the brother said don't worry sis
[1:16:48] there's a man standing present that can
[1:16:50] turn on the light so you don't need to
[1:16:52] worry don't don't worry how dark it gets
[1:16:55] there's a man standing present
[1:16:57] this man
[1:16:58] but this man who's the same yesterday
[1:17:00] today and forever but this man who said
[1:17:02] i'll never leave him or forsake thee but
[1:17:04] this man that says i'll be with you even
[1:17:05] in you to the end of the world he's
[1:17:07] standing present he can turn on the
[1:17:08] light
[1:17:09] hallelujah aren't you glad he's our
[1:17:12] guide he's our refuge he's our source of
[1:17:14] strength when we come to the end of
[1:17:16] ourselves that's when he steps in you
[1:17:18] say lord i can't take another step
[1:17:20] further he says that's fine i'm carrying
[1:17:21] you anyway
[1:17:23] hallelujah i'll bear you up on eagle's
[1:17:25] wings
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:28] hallelujah
[1:17:29] so it's very vital
[1:17:32] that we know how to fight
[1:17:35] and we teach our children to fight
[1:17:38] well how do we fight the battles won in
[1:17:39] prayer amen
[1:17:41] the battle's won in a surrendered life
[1:17:42] how did jesus won the victory on calvary
[1:17:45] he surrendered his life in gethsemane
[1:17:48] the victory was all it was all done and
[1:17:49] dusted in gethsemane
[1:17:51] they said not my will but thy will be
[1:17:53] done
[1:17:54] amen there's victory in praise
[1:17:56] there's victory in worship hallelujah
[1:17:59] amen is victory in love and joy
[1:18:03] so we need to teach and i'm not saying
[1:18:05] this because i don't believe you're not
[1:18:07] doing these things but it's worth it yes
[1:18:10] you know brother bam says about like uh
[1:18:12] people drafted into the army you know
[1:18:13] the sergeant major screaming at them
[1:18:15] from before dawn till after dusk and
[1:18:17] running them through drills and they you
[1:18:19] know got these big packs on their back
[1:18:21] and they're going you know on their on
[1:18:23] their chest commander crawling under you
[1:18:25] know barbed wire and these and and these
[1:18:27] machine guns that are trained to fire
[1:18:29] above their heads live rounds and you
[1:18:32] know no doubt there's times when those
[1:18:34] those recruits are just they hate the
[1:18:35] sergeant major they hate them with
[1:18:37] everything with them that's probably the
[1:18:38] motivation they get through basic
[1:18:39] training they hate him but then when
[1:18:41] they get on the battlefield
[1:18:44] they thank that sergeant major for all
[1:18:46] the shouting
[1:18:47] for all the drills for all the equipment
[1:18:49] they had to carry maybe when they're in
[1:18:50] basic training i carry these big packs
[1:18:52] and
[1:18:53] would i have to carry this shovel and
[1:18:54] why i've got to carry this helmet in
[1:18:56] these rations and there's extra
[1:18:57] ammunition in these grenades and then
[1:18:59] they find out when they're in the battle
[1:19:01] thank god i got the shovel i can dig
[1:19:03] myself a foxhole thank god i've got a
[1:19:05] grenade i can throw it at the enemy or
[1:19:06] these rations when i'm out on the field
[1:19:08] or you know and they begin to thank god
[1:19:10] for their sergeant major
[1:19:12] hallelujah you know because you might
[1:19:14] never know they might never know when
[1:19:15] they'd have to use that shovel but when
[1:19:17] they need it they have it in hand you
[1:19:19] may never know when you've got to use a
[1:19:21] particular scripture or a particular
[1:19:23] quote i mean you think why is this guy
[1:19:25] shout at us all the time and you know
[1:19:27] make us go through all these drills and
[1:19:28] carry on but there'll come a time when
[1:19:30] the devil comes against you on the
[1:19:32] battlefield and you'll say thank god
[1:19:34] amen thank god i heard that message
[1:19:37] thank god i heard the prophet preach on
[1:19:38] the called out ones or you know yeah
[1:19:40] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:19:42] thank god i had that memory verse put on
[1:19:44] my heart thank god i read the bible that
[1:19:47] that that one scripture who's ever had
[1:19:49] that the devil comes against you in your
[1:19:51] mind
[1:19:52] and then one scripture breaks the whole
[1:19:54] thing
[1:19:55] hallelujah
[1:19:56] and you say thank god
[1:19:58] maybe you can't even remember where you
[1:19:59] heard it but you heard it somewhere
[1:20:01] hello and it means the world in that one
[1:20:03] moment because that one scripture can
[1:20:05] break the enemy's attack
[1:20:07] hallelujah
[1:20:09] so
[1:20:10] we're in a battle i'm just gonna i'm
[1:20:12] just gonna quit right here
[1:20:14] we're in a battle
[1:20:16] but our lord jesus is our seventh star
[1:20:18] general
[1:20:20] and he is leading us through
[1:20:22] you don't need to worry
[1:20:23] you know brother ram says
[1:20:25] do you know how um if you want to see
[1:20:27] the supernatural you know what he says
[1:20:29] relax
[1:20:31] don't get all tense
[1:20:33] relax remember this is victory is won by
[1:20:36] rest
[1:20:37] resting in the lord
[1:20:38] that doesn't mean you're going sitting
[1:20:40] under a coconut tree and watching the
[1:20:42] world go by that's not that kind but
[1:20:43] resting knowing he's in control where we
[1:20:46] can actually say lord you've got this
[1:20:48] has he seen you through some scrapes
[1:20:50] before
[1:20:52] has he quit
[1:20:53] has he come to a point where it says
[1:20:55] well ladies too dark i guess i'm just
[1:20:57] going to let them go on through no no he
[1:21:00] leads his sheep
[1:21:02] he leads us
[1:21:04] he is not like a shepherd here i
[1:21:06] remember when i you know when i was
[1:21:08] growing up i spent time my friends in
[1:21:09] gisborne they had farms and then my
[1:21:11] uncle had a big station uh inland
[1:21:14] between gisborne and wairoa and there
[1:21:16] and me and my brother i don't know what
[1:21:17] age you were
[1:21:18] 10 younger than that you know we had a
[1:21:21] we had a quad bike and we had to herd
[1:21:23] like 500 sheep down the road and put
[1:21:25] them in a paddock we had great fun it
[1:21:26] was awesome but you know he's not that
[1:21:29] kind of shepherd who's sitting in a bug
[1:21:31] and room you know trying to scare them
[1:21:32] and startle the sheep to go forth no he
[1:21:34] doesn't he doesn't scare us into glory
[1:21:37] that's not our god he leads us he calls
[1:21:39] us by name
[1:21:41] and something in us just says yes lord i
[1:21:42] come
[1:21:44] hallelujah and then he leads us through
[1:21:46] he said i'm going through a horrible
[1:21:47] time he's leading you through
[1:21:49] amen but he now in the history of of
[1:21:53] believers i've never seen him drop
[1:21:56] someone in a trial
[1:21:58] he takes them through
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:02] so i think we can rejoice tonight
[1:22:04] you say i don't know if this gun works
[1:22:06] remember
[1:22:07] the devil if he can think his weapons
[1:22:09] equivalent to yours he's got you
[1:22:12] don't doubt your weapon the word of god
[1:22:15] it'll this remember brother brown says
[1:22:17] end time message meets end time
[1:22:19] conditions always
[1:22:21] this message meets 2022.
[1:22:24] and it'll meet 2023
[1:22:26] admit 2020 2021 it'll meet 2022 2023 it
[1:22:31] meets the conditions of the end time
[1:22:33] so we can rest and rejoice thank god
[1:22:37] you've actually laid up food
[1:22:39] you've you've actually laid up guides
[1:22:43] to help me in the condition this world
[1:22:45] is in right now
[1:22:47] that i don't have to guess
[1:22:48] how can i serve you in this time and
[1:22:51] navigate through all these things i can
[1:22:53] just rejoice and walk on
[1:22:55] because this message is actually more up
[1:22:57] to date right now than it was when it
[1:22:59] was preached
[1:23:00] because a prophet when a prophet sees
[1:23:02] things in in time where he is it's in
[1:23:04] seed form but how he sees it it's fully
[1:23:07] mature
[1:23:09] and now it's fully mature back then it
[1:23:11] was in seed form so we can just rest
[1:23:14] our god's got the battle
[1:23:16] but this man
[1:23:18] this man standing he's gonna wrap your
[1:23:20] bride
[1:23:20] doesn't matter how dark it gets he's
[1:23:22] gonna rapture us out of here
[1:23:23] just keep looking to him
[1:23:25] amen let's have the musicians tonight
[1:23:27] shall we
[1:23:28] amen but i'm so glad sure the enemies
[1:23:31] here that the every generation's gonna
[1:23:32] learn how to fight but you know what i
[1:23:35] love about the
[1:23:36] enemy
[1:23:37] he was defeated back there
[1:23:40] yeah the devil's a loser
[1:23:42] let's just let's just call it he's a
[1:23:44] loser
[1:23:45] he lost the battle
[1:23:47] did he beat david
[1:23:49] as goliath no
[1:23:51] did he stop noah building an ark
[1:23:54] no
[1:23:55] did he stop elijah no on mount carmel no
[1:23:58] did he stop our lord jesus let's just
[1:24:00] take the main one did he stop the book
[1:24:03] of acts church
[1:24:05] did they quit when the sanhedrin said
[1:24:07] stop preaching in this name they said no
[1:24:09] who should we who should we who should
[1:24:11] we uh follow or
[1:24:13] obey god or man and you know after they
[1:24:16] obeded you know what they did they went
