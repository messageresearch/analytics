through this one i'll do the same don't worry about it we can just trust the trials don't get any easier but our faith gets stronger that's the difference they actually get slightly harder to increase our faith but but our faith always meets the the need and god won't test us above what we're able because he's a faithful god amen i'm just talking as we funnel the bring the people in [Music] i'm

weeks i think it was been three weeks ago when we um received the news of taz's sister that the devil has stuck out his head again it must have been early i was the morning i think when the news came through and um and i remember that i was talking to tarzan i was just saying well the doctors can really just report on what they saying i said but how god works in the unseen and our faith has not wavered and even right now she's um back in hospital she i think they did draining some fluids and i did emergency um surgery on it yesterday and then sorry um a couple hours and fell asleep and a couple hours later i woke up with just these two lines of a song that just came back and it said um we're just your ways are higher than mine and it says um lord i want mountains to move you know um but you want me to climb them and um yeah and this has just been our testimony and i trust will bless your hearts [Music] it's not what i prayed for it's not what i wanted it's not something i understand my circumstances seemed so confusing but i'm placing it all in your hands cause your ways are higher than mine i want mountains to move but you want me to climb so i'm gonna trust your will you're welcome your time cause your ways are higher than mine [Music] one day i'm sure i will look back and marvel at how you knew best all along you see from heaven and you see the hard times that makes my faith steady and strong cause your ways are higher than mine i want mountains to move but you want me to climb so i'm gonna trust your will your work and your time cause your ways are higher than mine when i start to doubt lord help me believe that somewhere so far above me [Applause] that your ways are higher than mine i want mountains to move but you want me to climb so i'm gonna trust your will your work and your time cause your ways your ways are so much [Music] a higher [Music] than mine [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the lord that's the truth sister latabo ancestor the rebecca god bless you saints [Music] do just where we [Music] but through the eyes of the prophet god revealed to us before god was gone all the way the future new

leading our souls into the invisible the inaudible the inconceivable faith to believe for the impossible [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the lord amen that was really wonderful we're just going to sing a few worship songs um before we call up before brother ben comes up and introduces um brother tazewell um the next one there's these are two songs one is called i surrender and it's it's it was written about just making a full surrender to the lord you know they had this burden on my heart to write a song and say lord i surrender i surrender my all alad at your feet i surrender everything because you're worthy you deserve all of the glory there was no one else beside you my king that's the chorus there and then the other one that we're going to do after that is a song called eagles cry and this one came actually i think brother ben was ministering and he just once again get a little word then i heard an eagles cry and it just keeps on this little word keeps reverberating and sort of stays there you can stay there for weeks until you kind of get a guitar and sit down and bring it together but that one there is then i heard an eagles cry i heard a word speak to my heart said child you don't belong down there come up from where you are then i heard an eagles cry he told me i could fly and i believed the word that i had heard and sought up to the sky because that's who we are we're eagles amen that's then um this afternoon i'll lift my hands to you [Applause] [Music] i close my eyes and feel your love and spend the comfort of your spirit's embrace reign on me with your presence lord you're all you're all that i need fill me up with your spirit lord you're off you're all that i need and i surrender my all and i surrender [Music] i surrender everything for your worthy you deserve all of my glory there is no one else besides you my king [Music] surrender and i boldly come for your throne of mercy holy by [Music] righteously before you i'll stand reign on me with your presence lord you're all you're all that i need fill me up with your prayer [Music] my [Music] i surrender everything for your worthy you deserve all of the glory there is no one else besides you my king and i surrender for you are worthy for you are worthy you are holy you are mighty you are lovely you're forgiven you're amazing you're restoring over where you are worthy you are worthy you are holy you are mighty you are lovely you're forgiving you're amazing you're restoring overwhelming and i surrender my all i surrender my [Music] i lay it at your feet i surrender everything for your worthy and you deserve all of the glory there is no one else besides you my king and i surrender oh [Music] in high surrender [Music] i sought the truth in men gave their answers but something just wasn't right i couldn't explain it they sounded like strangers it just didn't meet my thirst inside and then i heard an eagles cry i heard a word speak to my heart it said shout you don't belong down there come up from where you are then i heard an eagles cry it told me i could fly and i believed the word that i had heard and sought up to the sky when i heard an eagles cry how i was thirsting and i was calling from somewhere deep inside the deep unveiled through your seventh angel the voice of the bridegroom calling to his bride and then i heard an eagles cry i heard a word speak to my heart it said shout you don't belong down there come up from where you are then i heard an eagles cry it told me i could fly and i believe the word that i had heard and sought up to the sky when i heard an eagles cry now i'm flying now i am flying above all the confusion below everything's clear and now i'm flying above the storm in every situation whatever comes my way i i have a peace with jesus flying above the storm there is a joy within me now that i'm soaring freely your word has set me free i'm flying above the stone and i won't be going back down my soul is glory bound i'm built to dwell in the heavenly for eternity then i heard an eagles cry i heard a word speak to my heart said child you don't belong down there come up from where you are then i heard an eagles cry and told me i could fly [Music] cry hallelujah amen that's why we gathered isn't it we've heard the we've heard the voice behind the voice we've heard papa eagle call us and you know the reason why the eagle stirs the nest and gets the youngins flying is because mama eagle wants baby eagles to know that they can do what she can do i mean it's the same life that's in mama as in baby but babies need to realize that life is in them so they can soar and the lord said the works that i do you shall do also and grant these that shall you do because i go to my father so he wants you to realize you're built of the same material hallelujah that that he's made of the word itself hallelujah amen well we're in for another treat you know i i love this morning you know you know the um amen i love this morning hallelujah you know so i like it you know when the when the third seal opened the black horse rider rides forth there's a voice from the midst of the throne saying touch not the oil and the wine so don't touch the revelation and the stimulation caused by the revelation so the devil can't hold it back but the devil will try and make you hold it back that's why we're free to rejoice you know if we just think where we came from where i came from how can you not shout and rejoice and when the word comes open to you and like john saw john you see yourself beyond the curtain of time already you see your theophany there your glorified body there how can you not shout i see i'm there if i'm there i'm gonna this man's gonna catch up to that man if i put it that way hallelujah so how can you not rejoice amen praise the lord so i get happy [Music] i'm from africa yeah my dad's south african so i can rejoice too if you want to try and put me in that bracket but i just got saved i met god hallelujah you know i'm not into dead formal dead you know this is not a cemetery you know we're living people quickened by the word of the hour hallelujah washing the blood of the lamb so we have brother tazewell coming to minister the word of god to us amen so if the first service was like it was what's this one going to be because you know this is god's doing he wants to pour himself into you more than you want to receive him and brother bam said the dynamics of this end time bride will be a refilling of the holy ghost and we're living in that hour it's not one day like brother ferdi said it's right now it's here it's going on hallelujah so amy just as brother tez comes to pulpit i said you know i said to him just have your liberty like never before you want to have a prayer line you want to have old call whatever you want to do just let the lord lead you amen praise the lord so yeah so let's just sing that chorus yo brother isaac now i heard the eagles cry and as uh brother taz makes his way here he's my buddy love and appreciate him i mean so i mean let's do this as he comes the eagles cry [Music] i said shout you don't belong down there come up from where you are then i heard an eagles cry it told me i could fly and i believed the word that i had heard and sought up to the sky when i heard an eagles cry then i heard then i heard an eagle cry i heard a word speak to my heart you said shout you don't belong down there come up from where you are then i heard an eagles cry it told me i could fly and i believed the word that i had heard and sought up to the sky when i heard an eagle's cry [Music] hallelujah let's just pray loving fatherly soul thankful just so grateful for god for this time lord this is so real just all the words of that song that i

sorry um um god bless you it's just so it's so good to be here i was just now standing there and just watching everything watching the proceedings and i was just tearing up and i told myself when i

shekinah congratulations and you special if we just have our bibles and we'll just see how the lord leads tonight thank you brother isaac don't stop writing songs i like it i love it um we got your bibles um psalm 105. you could just read that verse from verse 16 and then we'll go to first samuel chapter 7 and we'll end off with romans chapter 8. psalms 105. just get it sorry a bit nervous but enough yeah no i know i know i know i know we family we are family we are family we are family verse 16 verse 16 to 21 verse i'll just read verse 16 21 moreover he called for a famine in the land upon the land and break the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for his servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was led in iron until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him the king sent him sent and loosed him even the rulers of the people and let him go free first samuel chapter seven so when brother ben asked me to minister at these meetings this scripture just came immediately to me first samuel chapter 7 [Music] and i will read just one verse there verse 12. then samuel took a stone and set it between misbah and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped us i believe um shekinah that i believe is your testimony for these past 10 years it has been the lord amen and then just one last scripture in the book of romans chapter 8 and then we can take our seats romans chapter 8. eight verse 31 that's when the regis is actually the the second part of the verse but it says so it speaks of a couple of things but it says here what shall we then say to these things so this morning we heard some things being preached to us i believe tonight by the grace of god we'll hear some more precious promises from the world tomorrow we're going to hear more tomorrow morning tomorrow night the verse says here what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us let's just pray heavenly father your word has been read and i pray again lord just take me away all nervousness whatever and oh father we ask you to speak lord there's a song that we sing that says word of god speak that's what we want father in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you amen you may be seated tonight in the presence of god eminence i really appreciated my brother-in-law this morning man was just awesome and yeah that's just the way i know him [Laughter] he's actually my uh my my mentor i was i remember years years ago i was i was i still am but i was very very shy and very much in the background very much in the you know not wanting to be seen and somehow the lord inspired him to see a gift on this young taz and don't forget the first time he asked me to lead the song service in the youth meeting and i was so stressed out but i prepared that whole week [Laughter] to lead the song service and i'm just so grateful to god you know that the lord allowed him just to recognize something and then you know like he said you know once god came and he he brings a change in your life you can't see that the key is easy brings a change in your life so the things i used to do or the way i was you can't be like that you know once once you've seen what is done in your life once he's revealed this to you you can never ever be the same again so i'm really grateful to the lord just for the various people he's allowed to come my way so i've got i've got a title for tonight and uh you know as freddie was ministering this morning he hit on a couple of things and which i said they heard you pulling off my notes but we're just going to see and there's there's something that was key that ferdi said which i felt i i believe it was the it's it's it's god wanting to get our attention on something specific this weekend but i want to just give you my title and then i've got an a sort of an inspirational the subject behind it but the title says that god's purpose for your life will never be defeated [Music] i i want you to to grab that now i'm saying god's purpose for your life will never be defeated but i want you to take that turn it back on yourself and say god's purpose for my life can never be defeated because he's got a purpose and he's got a plan for each one of you and me as i'm standing here so that's the title for tonight and then i've got a little subject and brother any on tuesday night your you said something which just activated something within me and my my my subject for tonight is that you you are moving from the position of a prisoner into a position of power so if i may use a simple term i might say you are moving from prison into power now i don't know what you're going through and you know that and i know that but god knows so he knows why he tells certain people to say certain things because there might be somebody sitting here that maybe doesn't recognize or know that i am an eagle but they are eagles and they might be sitting here in this meeting but acting like chickens but they are eagles their makeup is that of an eagle and maybe tonight today the service may god come down to that person's seats and make them realize that i am an eagle i'm not a chicken i am walking what was the words that further used i'm gonna write i wrote it down here further used we need to switch position and i think that is so key i think that is what god wants to tell you and me over this weekend let's switch position wherever you are right now when you came to this meeting take it from here and move higher [Applause] i like that and he didn't know what i was gonna write in my notes but earlier this week the lord said from prison to power [Music] shall switch positions allow god allow the word to infiltrate your heart today allow it please i beg you especially the young people i beg you allow god as he speaks many of you know my testimony i came into a meeting i sat down thinking i'm just a cool smooth young person not realizing it i was an eagle i was always an eagle but i acted like a chicken i clocked like a chicken or i tried to but i just couldn't come out right until one day the word of god by the emerson came my way it changed my life it made me who i am today and because i know what it does and because i know where it's taken me from and because i know what is helping me to do i would i would if i could push it into everyone especially the young people i would so i want to encourage expert this is not a young people service but i'm so bad i'm so burdened for the young don't let my crying or my emotion try to make you emotional i mean it's normal as human beings but don't let emotion control decisions that needs to be made allow the word allow the word brother brennan in the message i know my redeemer liveth he says god's purpose can never be defeated and i want i want to carry that all over this meeting tonight i want you to know and i want you to receive that god's purpose for your life will not be defeated can never well not [Applause] you see it's important that you receive the words you've got to receive the word amen so he says there's nothing can defeat it so how happy what we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the living god that there is neither things present nor things that can come he says there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils he says nothing can separate us from the purpose of the loving god now we know there's a scripture that says nothing can separate us from the love of god and his love is projecting to you and to me so that his purpose for you what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring to pass he says there's no demon there's no power there is nothing that can ever separate god's great immortal eternal plan he says it must be as god has said if you want to know what god has said about you i encourage you to find it in his precious word as you feed on the word as you listen to the messenger as you think on those tapes it tells you who you are the purpose of god for you starts unfolding and you start to understand and then rather when you use that term it stimulates you stimulation of revelation because you're seeing yourself in the word and as you see in yourself mind stimulates you [Music] it makes you want to shout it makes you want to scream and say thank you jesus [Music] [Applause] thank you for your grace oh praise the lord nobody would come and in the message i know my redeemer liveth and you just touch on that word purpose and you talk about a home that you live in he says that home is not just or the house is not just a building that was put together just because there's a purpose for that house that you're living in that house so that home is to house you its purpose is to keep you warm sometimes even maybe to keep you but safe from the elements outside so there's a purpose for that house you tell us about you'll use the word automobile i'll use the word car he'll tell us that many of us came here maybe without vehicles that vehicle when it was created it wasn't just created to be there and to look nice that vehicle was created to bring you yeah and this is a memorial time this is a an awesome very important time this year tonight over this weekend i can imagine how god is looking and he's smiling [Music] and he's saying my ten years being ten years went so quick but look what i've accomplished in you know not only chicago and he's smiling and he's saying there's my daughter there's my son maybe they they sting here and they they they don't really know that they're my daughter or my son maybe that realization hasn't hit them yet but i'm going to because i know what needs to be said and i'm going to allow someone to say something that will activate something within them that will make them realize hey i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god not a chicken in the barnyard priming eagle the bran would say you talk about a church building and i'll talk about this building here this building was built for a purpose maybe the people when they built it thought they're gonna have it for conferences thought they're going to have it for business meetings and various kind of business events but i believe god had a purpose for this building to be created so when the designers of the architect went and they architected this this building they didn't have in mind that there's going to be royalty shooting in this place because that is who you are [Music] you are royalty [Applause] you are the apple of his eye you special [Music] and i'm not just giving you good words that's not just good words go and read the word i know i'm coming back i this for me is so important read the word and you will realize i'm royalty thus balding was bought for a purpose to house he's purchased to house royalty so that so that god could sweep into this place and take captive and change lives and help you to switch is calling you come up higher david i'm sorry i'm going to use you as an example we pointed to david very pointed to david isaac david isaac it's favoritely sorry very pointed to david lee and i sat there and i had this inspiration in my heart and i said this building was built for a purpose so that isaac lee could stand there and say preach it brother preach it [Applause] [Music] and that god could use the minister to show and point to a trophy [Music] of his grace [Applause] this year is a trophy to the grace of god [Applause] a trophy i'm looking at trophies of his grace all of you you are trophies hallelujah [Applause] [Music] god did not make you and i just to see we could do it made us for a purpose there is a purpose for all of us being here he says for a specific purpose now you know as we go through the word we can we can realize and read and understand you know why and where god is leading us in what he wants us to do and you know he's called us for for bigger things than whatever we're doing out there but you know i was i was thinking about this and i i mentioned something similar when we spoke in fielding but i the lord just impressed on my heart say it again you know many times we come to these gatherings and we think it's just about the minister coming with the word preaching the word so that my son and that my daughter can be delivered many times you want to put it on the minister now the word is of vital importance but i believe with all of my heart that god has placed you as you sitting here he's gifted each one many of us what so many gifts so it's not only the minister but it's you it's you it's you you can bring about a change just be sensitive to the moving of the there's gifts of discernment there's gifts of prophecy you know i stand here today i'll throw down here god's purpose for your life will never be defeated many many many years ago back in south africa a prophecy went out over tears that was just hiding in the corner very much scared and shy ashamed of himself sometimes a prophecy went out that said you're moving overseas you leaving south africa i had no plans no intentions nothing of leaving the country prophecy went out you're leaving the country you're going overseas and god is going to use you i heard that and i thought me i come to shy to speak in front of people but god when i when i look back and i look at where he's taken me from south africa moved me to the uk moved me here i see that there were certain things that god needed me to he wanted he had planned it out i had to just die to be obedient to what he wanted them and doesn't matter what came my way what challenges the purpose of god for my life had to be fulfilled it had to come to pass so no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose as i'm looking at you tonight you are here to serve a purpose and you just allow him allow him amen open up yourself and say lord i'm available to you amen until god's purpose is fulfilled no matter how much trouble i listened to brother isaac and i'm so grateful for your testimony you could you stood here and he said i went to this and i went through that but i overcame that's your testimony you are overcomers do you know that that you are an overcomer he's called you to be an overcomer i told the church back home because some people looked at me kind of strange and i said that being overcomer so i said okay let's push the spiritual stuff aside let's just go natural for the change and so i told him i said this morning maybe it was a bit cold and you were laying in your home bed but you had to overcome the desire to sleep in you see you knew that this was happening this weekend but there was a desire man it's so cold i don't want to get out of this home bed but you did and because you did that you overcame the warm dead so just on the natural side you i'm looking at overcomers here today now take that to the spiritual and know that there's a god that's loving inside of you why [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he talks about abraham and sarah he says nothing can defeat his purpose not even death abraham was as good as dead and sarah's whom had been dead for 40 or 50 years but nothing can defeat god's purpose her body was old it was wrinkled the milk veins would ride up so when the natural person would look at that they say how is it possible but the purpose of god if god said something is going to happen so he said he changed sarah made her a young woman again and took a man 100 years old turned him back to his youth no matter how unreasonable [Music] it may sin if god has given a promise that promise will stands and i like i like i like telling people this i say don't when when god has given you a promise focus on the promise you will see the problems all around you but don't focus on the problems focus on the promised [Applause] focus on the promise [Applause] [Music] like i said i don't know i don't know many of your you know things that you go through in life but i wrote down yes it even if you might feel bound maybe not even spiritually bound maybe just bound with some kind of sickness maybe some kind of i don't know what it is maybe you you know you're sitting here you're listening to the ministry you listen to by the tears and you saying man i want fats that brother tells us i want it you all you need to do is they say take that step that's all i mean don't listen to things around you don't worry about who's around you all you do is take that step once you've taken that step you know because it's always difficult it's difficult to take that one step but once you've taken that one step you can take the next step and then you can take the next step [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it could be a step now i'm not saying come to the altar and i'm not pushing it away either right god works in various ways if it means that you need to take that step and come here and pray and say lord i need you do it [Music] it might be god just calling you calling you saying come just take that step take that step this greatness within you there's a there's a specific purpose that i have for your life but i need you or even in your seat i need you to open up your heart and say lord forgive me lord i want to serve you help me simple as that it's not rocket science it's not that complicated physics or complicated maths it's as simple as saying i need you it's as simple as just being brutally honest with him you see he wants to move you if there's no one here in the meeting and there's maybe someone on the live stream he wants to move you from a he wants you to switch positions he wants to move you from a position where you think you are in a prison house and he wants to move you to the rightful position where you should be a position of authority a position of dominion because that is why you were created [Applause] so i ask you allow god to reveal himself to you and i apologize for saying this in message churches because all message people are very holy and they don't make mistakes and they and i apologize for that but if you're someone that's struggling and really wants to go to that next level with god he's available amen not cares not about cat it's about him he's available amen to you just take that step that's all you do and he can switch your position amen switch you from wherever you are and take you into another level with him because he wants you and me to come up higher he wants to move you from a prison into power i love that prison to power amen and you know who in the bible went from prison to power [Laughter] someone i love in his name was joseph joseph prison to power to authority sickening command to pharaoh now just let me just go through some things here i like i like joseph so he would allow me just to let's just walk through a little bit of joseph if it's okay and i'm gonna try to make it as simple as i can especially for young people you know many times i used to find myself sitting in church as a young person and listening to the minister's minister and they would use all these complicated words and to just go over my head and you know it just confused me but not that you mustn't do that just that i remember as a young person many times i would just sit in church and have no idea what's being said then and obviously tried to memorize those big words so i could use it for somebody and sound sound very messy intellectual anyway so you know you know if you go if you read in the messages of brother branham and he would he would talk about joseph and i'm not going to go into these things but you know you talk about how joseph you know the life of joseph would be a perfect he says it's a a perfect type of our lord jesus christ you know and uh you would you'd use words like you know joseph perfection you'd use words like jacob grace and uh or you'd say there's nothing against joseph perfect joseph you know and um and and then he would come and you'd take that and you turn it and say there's nothing against you and many times we would sit there by the crest and we would hear that nothing against you nothing against me does the lord know what i did yesterday no nothing against me so we would hear these things and read hear things like you know you're the poor the pure sinless virtuous bride of our lord jesus christ and that is who you are amen and that's why i say this building it was elected year was for you so that we could be here the purpose so that shekinah could could could celebrate 10 years of the grace of god and this body would be available to house the pure bride of jesus christ that's sitting here right now in his presence and i i mentioned that word you know as as you know and as we're going through the word and as i i read about joseph and you know i i read about the various things it just gets me so excited it gets me so enthused when i see the grace of god in that life of joseph so now psalm 105 verse 17 said that you know um joseph was sold for a servant now we know for those of us that know what happened with joseph joseph was he was a he was um to his brothers to his brethren he was kind of strange kind of kind of weird now i want to just read something whether branham says he says let me show you a beautiful type here in joseph he says joseph the spirit man he says the eagle he was born amongst his brothers just like the real church is among the other and he could interpret dreams and see visions you see there was something different about joseph but the rest of them hated him but his father loved him and maybe there might be some sitting here today and you know people out there might hate you and might ridicule you and might think man you're so strange or that church a kind of man they are a strange bunch of people but god loves you he's mindful of youth if we look at what is done in shaking the tabernacle man it it makes me so emotional so i was crying to see the grace of god so the brandon says he was thrown into ditch and supposed to be dead he says that he says joseph was a perfect example he said it was christ in joseph he talks about the brothers and everyone else around they hated him without a cause they hated him because he was who he was he couldn't help being who he was but the problem says the man joseph couldn't help he was just who he was but the brandon says what he was he was and all the brothers hated him because joseph was spiritual joseph had dreams joseph the lord would reveal things to joseph yeah but joseph probably in the home of his dad and mom and you know even though the brothers hated him dad loved him so he probably had an okay life but he had no idea what was coming ahead in his life but joseph was spiritually minded you know we know about he had these spiritual dreams and he was even rebuked by his dad to say ah are you telling me that me your mom and i we're gonna bow down to you but joseph was just who joseph was and the brethren the brothers probably thought you know i don't know if you've heard the statement before and that he was heavenly minded and no earthly good i don't even heard that statement before now i i used to use that statement sometimes right we i would say people they're so heavenly minded all they want they want to act super spiritual but their life is a mess until the lord came to rebuke me the lord came to rebuke me and he he allowed me to come across something that somebody had said about that statement you heavenly minded but you know earthly good they said yeah i'm gonna just read this if you read history you will find that the christians who did the most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next most of heaven he says the apostles themselves remember the apostles they were heavenly minded they said the apostles themselves who set on foot the conversion of the roman empire the great men who built up the middle ages and the english evangelicals who abolished the slave trade all left their mark on earth because their minds were occupied with heaven let's get our minds occupied with heaven and as our minds are occupied with heaven heaven will come down and teach us how to control our home how to run the home how to run the church how to be a christian at work it is that since christians have largely ceased to think of heaven that they have become so ineffective in this world let's think on him allow him to lead us to guide us you make us better parents better moms better dads better deacons better ministers better pastors let's be heavenly minded so that we can do good with now joseph was so strange to his brethren that they hated him but joseph at the time obviously was protected by dad so maybe it didn't really bother him the hatred he probably felt that he knew about it but he had that protection by that so we know the story how joseph was then sold as a slave so the brothers came for those of us they don't know the what happened in the bible the brothers came joseph came to visit them they grabbed him threw him in the pits wanted to kill him some slave traders came past they took him out of the pit cave sold him to the slave trader slave traders and sent him away told lies to the dead so here's joseph a slave having every reason to hate his brothers every reason because i can imagine being a slave in those days wasn't nice it was probably horrible slaves were mistreated now i know we read about how david found that joseph found favor but i know and as i read it joseph had to prove himself in order to find favor but until that time man i can imagine he was probably mistreated and every time the master would kick him he'd probably think to himself about the brothers and maybe something would rise up inside of him but because joseph was joseph i believe god was using these opportunities for joseph to learn forgiveness i can imagine joseph being ordered this way and ordered that way then as the orders would come in maybe he's getting so tired and then maybe his mind would go back to the days with dad and mom then maybe he'd start having those battles in the mind my brothers it's because of them that i'm here but joseph had every reason to hate them every reason to point fingers at them we find as you follow the life of joseph he calls as a slave in the house of potiphar and in the house of potiphar he starts to prove himself and then potiphar realizes hey i've got golger and then potiphar starts elevating him into a certain position and the bible teaches us how everything that joseph touched prospered and you'd say joseph son of prosperity so maybe there was a time in joseph's life where things were going okay still a slave but things were going okay but you see god had a purpose and a plan for joseph's life now us sitting here today 2022 we know what happened we know where joseph ended up but at the time of the marcus joseph had no idea yes he had visions maybe yes he had dreams and you know the lord had probably spoken to him and showed him but maybe being in the situation that he was maybe he would question and think man am i really going to move into the position of power am i really going to move from this present house of slavery into a position of power amen but you see god was moving things and then in the house of potiphar part of his wife tries to seduce joseph brother actually uses the word he says this beautiful woman tried to seduce that joseph was a man and the bible does say he resisted but i can imagine as a man being seduced by this beautiful woman it took something within joseph to say no and i believe that today as you and i sit here in the presence of almighty god there's something within you young man and young lady and brother and sister that can say no [Applause] and then if we look at that story we know that joseph was then falsely accused by potiphar's wife and then she end he ended up in the prison in the prison house not in power but in prison in the pharaoh's prison a dirty place probably ugly place horrible place that is where joseph ended up in prison and then being in prison i can imagine joseph sitting there and thinking how did all of this start then maybe his mind would go back my brothers it's because of them that i am sure and again he had all the right amen to say i like them but nowhere in the scriptures do we find excuse me that joseph ever said i hate them but the brandon teaches us joseph was a perfect type of christ he said there was christ in joseph the brandon says he says in the prisoner maybe he's sitting in the prison and he's remembering the dreams and he's remembering the prophecy that went out maybe remembering this and remembering that but he's sitting in a prison house in a forfeit dirty ungodly probably place random says in a prison he says now remember he was thinking he also became a total failure so maybe joseph was sitting there in prison thinking about this and thinking about that and maybe even feeling like a total failure i mean yes the lord had given him the dreams and he knew that you know this there's something special about me but here i am sitting in a prison house there may be some of us sitting here tonight maybe we've been going through hellish times maybe we've had our own brethren turn against us and we have every reason to point fingers every reason to say i hate them but joseph being a type of christ nowhere in the bible did joseph ever say i hate them it might be someone sitting here you might think i'm a total failure amen i want you to know that you are not you might be sitting here today and thinking i'm in a prison house circumstances happen in my life this happened and that happened and here i am and i feel so like a the nothing just pressed on my heart to let you know don't tell yourself that you are not a nothing there is greatness within you and maybe god is just using the opportunity to get that greatness to come to the surface this may be using certain circumstances maybe using certain brothers maybe using certain situations because greatness is inside of you and that greatness needs to come to the floor you know a lot of times we always tend to think that trouble and problems if we want to blame the devil but sometimes god allows certain things to happen in our lives if you want if you want to argue that just go and look at the life of joseph how god allowed certain things to happen and i had to learn from that and tell myself tess don't judge maybe god just allowed certain things to happen because something needs to be changed in that young person something great is in that sister and god is just using that kind of pleasure to bring it out i'm obviously not advocating that you can go out and sin but i'm just saying the lord has taught me not to point fingers not the judge but to pray and i was listening to um brother kaidrina the other day and he actually he was he was i think he was giving his testimony and he talks about how he just you know wasn't really interested in god but he says god then allowed cancer to hit his brain and you see it for him that was a wake-up call for god to get his attention no i don't know again i'm repeating myself me the lord doesn't want me to repeat myself but i don't know what you're going through but just think about the things that you are going through and ask yourself the question is this maybe the lord that's calling me pulling me beckoning me and saying come come that's all i want from you i want you just to take that step if it means just raising my hand if i've never done it before raise your hands if it means just giving over because that's what he wants he wants you and me just to give over give it to him don't you try to fight your battles give it to him he will help you he will show you how to do what you must do you know as you're sitting here tonight there's a greatness within you you might be the youngest person here tonight we have faith she's maybe one of the youngest out here with this younger there's something special within you and maybe others can't see it but he sees it i mean and he wants you and me to recognize that there's something within you there is something there that can be a help against the powers of hell you can be a catalyst for your friend you can be a conscious but all he wants from you is to surrender all he wants from you is to let go he told me to tell you don't let the devil pull you around don't let the devil kick you this way and kick you that way because he's a bullish don't let him you need to do tonight tonight i just feel in my heart tonight give your life to jesus i mean just let go let go because if you go and look at the story of joseph there came a time when joseph had to switch position where joseph had to step from prison into a position of power into a position of authority it was always in him and that's right now within you his people but he wants you he wants you just to let go it's a song that says let go and let god have his wonderful way let go and let god have his way [Music] your troubles will vanish your night turn today let go and let god have his way as you bow our heads and the musicians can come thank you [Applause] as we just bow our heads musicians just play something softly lord jesus i know for me father lord as i'm standing here it sounded very very jumbled up but i did tell you before i came up lord that i want you to speak father that i want you to take taz out of the way and word of god to speak to hearts lord jesus here in this building is your purchased possession lord we're celebrating ten years of your grace the shekinah tabernacle [Music] lord when we look at what has been accomplished we see nothing else but the grace of almighty god [Music] father i believe right now that that grace [Music] is here [Music] i believe heavenly father that the grace of god has been extended i want to pray right now loving father you know my heart you know my desire lord as i looked across the audience father in my eyes fell oh god on certain people and look god you can see that there's battles and there's fights within [Music] you can see father that there's a desire to come up higher [Music] now i just want to pray right now in the name of jesus that lord you just deal with the hearts lord just for the next few minutes [Music] we ask heavenly father that your spirit would flow freely and oh god this morning and tonight you came to tell us that there's an opportunity [Music] to switch position lord god we want to father lord when we go back home that lord god when we think back of the 10 year anniversary of shekinah lord god that we can take that and relate it to something real that happened in my life that lord god when we think back and look back to shekinah's 10th anniversary [Music] we can also say that that was the day [Music] where my life was changed that was the day i received the holy ghost that was the day i responded not to the voice of brother tears but i responded to the voice of god [Music] when we think back to shekinah's 10th year anniversary lord we can then say that was the day that i realized that i'm not really a chick but i'm an eagle so i just pray tonight father if there's someone lord that you would you lord [Music] who touch their hearts not as not some emotional workup because lord god if it was tears or if it was some kind of emotional thing then tomorrow [Music] we'll just be back to our normal things i pray tonight let it be god [Music] is my prayer in jesus name amen as we just keep our heads bowed we keep our eyes closed [Music] i wonder if you're someone here you know i'm so burdened for young people i've got i've got young people in my own home and i i see the struggles i see the battles i see the the things that's pulling [Music] and i i understand [Music] if there's any young person here tonight not excluding the moms and the dads and not excluding anyone else [Music] but if this young one here today [Music] that you know you look at yourself you so much want to be a real christian you you so much want to serve god you want to be able to say no but you're finding it such a struggle [Music] i want to let you know firstly i'm not going to judge you i'm going to love you the love of god is here right now [Music] and it doesn't matter what the struggle is in your life but the lord this morning called out a demon called pornography [Music] if pornography [Music] is holding you in that prison house you can move and switch position where you can move out of that prison house into a position of power where there's a greatness within you that will have an authority and a power over that demon of pornography so as we're going to sing the song if we could just keep our eyes closed i want to extend an invitation [Music] but i want you to know that it's an invitation [Music] of love [Music] that's what it is it's an invitation of love it's it's it's the love of god it's just being approached to you whoever you are as we sing the song i want you to let go and let god have his wonderful way with you [Music] i guarantee you and get into you you know what i remember we had a camp shekinah camp a couple of i think a couple of years ago and i remember a young brother coming up if it's okay brother i'll call your name brother john maloney i remember [Music] he was standing there with me and i held him we spoke we prayed and then i asked him i said john now you go and you go and speak to the lord you tell him you tell him [Music] and because john did that you see john took that step [Music] he took a step today or yesterday i seen him again and my heart was just so overjoyed maybe john has had his own battles since then and he would have had battles but what's keeping charlie how what has brought john back into church [Music] it's the grace of god now that grace is here tonight this afternoon if there's someone my eyes has not opened yet i don't know if anyone has come but if there is god

ministered there and she came to me [Music] as you said by the tears your sermon convicted me [Music] i looked at so much love just flowed out and i told her that you know what it's more than just the word convicting you [Music] you need to do something about it [Music] you need to take that step [Music] i'm sorry i don't know why the lord with the meeting this way but [Music] there's freedom in
