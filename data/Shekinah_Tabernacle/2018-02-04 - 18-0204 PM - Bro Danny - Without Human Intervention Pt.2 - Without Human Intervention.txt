[Music] [Music] hallelujah amen you may be seated [Music] I thought about giving you testimony at the Christmas service and as soon as I sat in a service that nope definitely not ready but um this morning I was listening in the back um I had the baby in the back and it was the stay on his screen and um I just knew I had to share I don't want to say too much Mimi won't understand because oh you'll get it but um but I knew I had to say something because maybe there's some person here that struggles with it or maybe you're you're needing that encouragement and if it touches just one person in this whole room then that makes a difference because sometimes we can get so caught up in our own lives that we don't share or we don't reach out and that one person they miss out they may miss it and you can be that person that can reach out to somebody it might be just a word or just saying that I care and you look like you need someone to care about you and that can mean all the difference I'm the second of six children in my family and now were five my youngest brother should have been 22 on the 2nd of November this last year he was born when I was 9 and a half and he was my baby because in a big family you know you do a lot you babysit and you change diapers and you do a lot and you're not the mommy just the sibling so they're like your baby we had a lot of difficulty the last ten years of my family's life a lot of changes you don't always understand it you don't know what's happening you don't know why maybe your parents make certain decisions maybe you're not the one who made that decision and you just feel your suffering all the consequences but they're doing it for your best and they love you when we made some large changes in our family my little brother was 10 years old and at 10 you don't you don't understand a lot at 12 you don't understand why they changed your life around at 15 all you know is you have no friends and at 18 you decide school ain't worth it life isn't worth it and maybe you spend way too many hours playing video games maybe you decide we're family isn't worth it maybe decide friends ain't worth the hassle and all you would do is isolate yourself don't do you that reach out to somebody whether that's someone at your church maybe that's a family member maybe that's your neighbor reach out to someone they could change your life and they may not be a message believer but maybe it's someone who gives you a perspective a life's worth living and then you may find that this life for Christ is worth living August 23rd my little brother went home he took his own life there is nothing anyone can say I can reverse that there's nothing you can do to change a decision you make that affects your entire family your whole church people who love you people who care reach out to somebody ask them awesome to do something for you tell them to take you somewhere tell him you want a friend tell him you need a friend because that friend can change you it can change your life you know one brother Danny was talking this morning he kind of sounded funny but he said people have familiar spirits and it's a spirit they're familiar with that's the truth you get familiar with those spirits of being out with people you think are fun spirits out at the bar spirits out with friends that you think are you people from school spirits of games or videos or whatever's the coolest new thing or the coolest new YouTube or whatever you think it is you become familiar with that spirit and that's filler it becomes familiar with you the problem is you don't know how to get rid of that spirit find somebody who is stronger than you find somebody who's much stronger than you and say I need a friend because I need help i need you i need it i don't know how to do it by myself be that person for me because there are so many people that want to do that for you so many who people who care and they want to be that person for you and for you and for you and for you and they will do it they'll do if it takes their time they'll do if it takes to their money they'll do it if they have to put aside everything that's important to them god said one souls worth 10,000 world's one soul you're that soul you're that young person you're that young person that can go and be a pastor a pastor's wife a deacon someone in a church it could be a pillar you're that person but you can't do it if you don't reach to someone reach out and he spoke this morning thought about that spirit of witchcraft that was bothering he didn't know what it was a lot of time we have things bothering us we don't know what it is somebody has to tell us and then our eyes open and we can get rid of that thing he said that brother after the service so there was somebody holding you up that whole service so Lord that's me these last five months have been a disaster almost seems in my emotional life and there's been somebody it's the Lord Jesus Christ holding us up and I want to say it's not all gonna be better pains aren't all gonna go away you can't give me back my little brother but there is healing that started and I want to tell you because there's healing that starts you will have a changed life there's a healing that's just for you and that's just for me so I just want to give all the glory to God because no matter what happens in any situation I know for me he started healing this morning and it makes all the difference to God be the glory [Applause] Amen god bless is that Sharon the Lord is with you in your mornin and he will

Jim how we thank God that he's done it amen praise the name of the Lord let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer Amen a gracious Heavenly Father we would like to say how much we Lord appreciates you and thank you Father for your mercy and your goodness to us today we thank you Lord for how you've moved so far but father we pray you won't stop there that you're go farther Lord and you'll move in this evening service in a special way that you will bless every effort that has went forth every song that was sung the testimony that was given Lord may it be lifted up to your throne Lord as a trophy of grace Lord and we pray Lord in this service that you would move to the hearts Lord people Lord have responded to the word they've raised their hand they've said their needs now Lord move into that need father move into that life Lord God may you have complete preeminence in this service may we lay aside our tiredness and lay aside the day now focus our minds Lord upon the word of God may there be complete liberty in the house of God Lord every hindering spirit Lord be moved and bound and put aside so that the children of God can receive the gospel Lord we ask these things in Jesus name Amen amen turn in your Bibles to the book of first Peter the fifth chapter we're going to continue preaching on what we did this morning but I would like to read this verse this a few verses here out of this book and then we'll go back amen to the book of Genesis and continue in that same thought this morning we were speaking on without human intervention amen and we would like to continue on in the same manner this evening first Peter 5 the fifth verse likewise ye younger submit yourself unto the elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble to subject yourself one to another you must open yourself one to another humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time Paul Peter is telling us that amen unless we humble ourself into the eldership and unto one another and to the order that God has placed in the church and in the body until we've done that you can't even humble yourself to God you have to humble yourself to God's order it's not a rule of man ruling over you in Dominion amen for their own sake and for their own a man ability and for their own position but it's the order that God has set up because he could have caused anything to preach the gospel brother Branham said he could have used the moon the Sun he could have used anything but he chose man to do it and then on top of that unfortunately one of the hardest things to do is get one man to believe another so he says humble ourselves one to another humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time cast all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world you understand that as we stand in this congregation there's many afflictions that are the same thing you've gone through maybe it's covered up maybe it's hid maybe somebody else don't know about it but the same things are accomplished in your brethren now the devil tells you you're the only one you're the only one but the God of all Grace who hath called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle to you to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen you can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word I just want to a man just read a couple of the scriptures that I read this morning if that's okay just to refresh your memory of Isaac and Rebecca so we remember that amen Rebecca was barren and with Berenice arises a lot of questions with Berenice bitterness can come in attitudes and complexes bitterness Berenice is a prison baroness a man causes you to try to manufacture something and try to look to do something that a man that you've tried to produce and you've tried to bring forth life and it calls to mind how Sarah and Abraham were that Sarah because she could not produce amen the the the seed that was being called for she manufactured something because out of her bare serosa desperation to produce the promise and yet it wasn't being produced and the Bible says that Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived it so she had a struggle in her womb and didn't understand what the struggle was and she said if it be so why am i thus if this is what I was supposed to have why am I having this struggle and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said two nations are in the womb two men our people shall be separated from the boughs one people shall be stronger than the other and the elder shall serve the younger the elder shall serve the younger this is the direct word of the Lord now we live in the time and the hour of course we know and believe it's the end time and it's not just because we believe it and see the science happening all around us it's been announced by the prophet of God we're at the end time amen there's no other age to come amen we're right on the on the doorstep of the Millennium can you say Amen hey man it's the going home time for the bride of Jesus Christ God has unveiled himself before us this is the hour of the unveiling of God we as a people here this evening set here as the most spiritually informed people that's ever been on the face of the earth amen you have more of a spiritual depository than any prophet has ever had Amen any men of God you can read about in the Bible you have more that's been handed to you that you have it's your disposal to use in your walk with God than anybody in history and yet we struggle and we also are the most conflicted people and we are the weakest people Paul said this know also that in the last days perilous times would come we are truly in perilous time I mean that word perilous apparently means it's fierce it's hard to take and in men Amiens hearts are failing them for fear people are turning away and walking away from the truth without natural a fleck affection seemingly your friends and everybody just separate without any care and it has an effect upon you what an hour that we live in but God didn't leave us without resources he man as I've already said we have the most resources of any time in history but I want to read to you this this statement brother Branham makes in in the man running a man running from the presence of the Lord and as he's praying he says may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age Lord be unveiled to us I mean say Amen that's my desire and will see the plainness of God so what is the unveiling of a mystery for to see the plainness of God and what is the reason for us to see the plainness of God so that we'll know how to behave ourselves and to act correcting ourselves because when you see what's right as a believer you automatically bring your body into correction of what you've seen and it brings your action into that correcting ourself and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus Christ you see the unveiling of God the great mysteries of God the opening of the word amen was not Amen to make up camps and divisions and more spiritual people more high-minded people it was never intended for that but it was so that you would know how to live humbly that you would know how to walk humbly that you would know how to live and correct your own self bringing your body into the Dominion of the word of and be able to present your body as a living sacrifice I mean say man so one of the mysteries to be revealed in this time is the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation right the baptism of the holy ghost without traditions but the Word of God in full effect in you amen the person of Jesus Christ the full word the full Word of God not the full textbook of God but perfect interpretation with divine vindication amen don't leave out the divine so just say we have Amen the perfect interpretation don't leave out the divine for without the divine the perfect interpretation is meaningless man and so I'm here this evening amen and you just excuse me now I want all you tired people in here this is a buckle up your armor now and help me out preach the Word of God all right I mean because we want to put Devils on the run and then the devil is like a roaring line we've already read and he's out to seek and devour he's out after these young people he's out after you he's out after your worship he's out after everything you proclaim and say that you believe now reject those spirits that try to come in and hinder you hearing the Word of God the resentments that creep in and who does that guy think he is and all that just throw it aside now begin to enter in and say Lord Here I am now I want you to speak to me I want you to look at me with those eyes not eyes of fire but eyes of love that'll come in and walk in the corridor of my life go into my uncomfortable places that have been my prison-house and set me free from that young people I challenge you this evening if you humble yourself to God and be a real man with the words come the time that David was dying and then Solomon is fixing to set on the throne is that a word here y'all use fixing okay good I don't have to explain it to you hey man he was getting ready to get on the throne hey man and there was things in David's David's life that hadn't been completed things that he didn't deal with and maybe he didn't have the strength to deal with and maybe he didn't even have the right to deal with because some of it was his own doing but men like Joab his cousin had been his right-hand man they've been his general over all the army but that man began to do his own thing and he brought a man he killed a man at the how at the doorstep of of Hebron him in one of the cities of refuge and he pulled him out there in deceit and killed him and a man in the blood amen David said let that blood come upon you and upon your house but David didn't clean it out amen amen the man that cursed David and the man wanted his men want to draw their swords and take his head off and and David said leave him alone God told him to do that but even though God told him to do that didn't mean God wouldn't deal with that and it came the hour all these things amen amen the counselors I had come against David I mean he told Solomon now Solomon's taking the throne he said Solomon show yourself a man and young people it's time to be a man with the Word of God even young ladies it's time to be full grown with the Word of God it's time to put aside all of our petitions it's time to put aside all of our facades put aside all that we pretend to be and come to him just as you are if God is gonna do anything in your lives you can't come like your mama you can't come like your daddy you can't come with the excuses of the past say brother daddy you don't know where I've been but I tell you he knows where you've been some of you're just too proud to admit little things that are there human intervention intervention means to intervene means to become true to between two times or come between an event means to come between by way of hindrance or modification you know there's been a lot of intervening with the baptism of the Holy Ghost down through the ages where we've modified it we've changed it we said if you do this it'll come but God doesn't want any of that because when we modify it then we are we are basing ourselves we are basing our confidence on something that's been modified you remember brother meant him talked about Amen he always wanted a rather or Wetherby rifle Amen and so some brothers took a rifle and had it bored out to be a Weatherby but it wasn't made by the by the manufacturer it was made by another company because it was a board Amen right and it wasn't the right rifle when he put it up to target practice it blew up in his face that's something that's been amen intervened with something that's been amen amen modified them tell you many people have come to the altar gave their heart to the Lord went back and said I got the Holy Ghost but because Amen they didn't go all the way with God it blew up in their face down the road God wants something to live inside of you he wants his own life to live there where that way you don't have to quit anything you have to try anymore it won't be hit your life it'll be his life amen for our life is dance and it's hit he takes you so far into Christ a min that the devil's he ever got back there to you he would be born again with you come on Church God wants to take you so far into his presence tonight Amy that does not even be a shadow of doubt in your life a story of Isaac and Rebekah is actually an ugly story of human nature it's also the story of a family that's been blessed of God they've received all that Abraham had Abraham was a very rich man he was a very rich landowner he's very well respected most of all he had revelation of God and God said haven't seen that Abraham will teach his children I'm not going to hide anything from him what I'm going to do him in and he blessed Abraham he blessed him in his home he blessed him with land he blessed him with riches and so all of these blessings came upon Isaac and Rebekah and Isaac and Rebecca's own life are a result of the supernatural I think amen came when his mom and dad was a hundred and seventy five years old a man not a hundred and seventy five by 101 and seventy five years old amen amen they came God had to change their bodies in order for Isaac to be born it was a result of the supernatural Rebecca coming amen and being of the wife of Isaac was a result of the supernatural where the angel that was with Abraham a man went before Eliezer and beat Eliezer by the space of about 30 minutes and met her at the well and prepared her life to receive the message that would come will you go marry this man and then they've been given prophesy themself of their own children it is no mistake that a man in in the foundation of the gospel and the foundation of Israel Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph that Jacob is the grace part and brother venom said that it was God working out through all of these men he was working his own life out through there showing himself in faith and justification and in in grace and in perfection you see because grace gives way to perfection you have grace speak about grace but it must give way to perfection can you say Amen amen this story Amen then that we are reading as the results of prophecy amen and it shows a man prophecy and then how they brought the prophecy into the intellectual realm and it shows how we use our abilities to help God fulfill his own word as we know God don't want our abilities he wants your vessel and this couple Isaac and Rebecca they have been brought to earth to fulfill a very important piece of the puzzle or tapestry if you will of God's mystery that he would reveal in this in time do you imagine how god amen builds his his word as he builds it through the lives of people and sometimes his very prophecy would hinge upon one person coming and doing something that would be an interlocking piece of puzzle that would fit right in he would let his but he would let a mean his prophecy dwindled down to one person one person on earth that if they did not step forward and fulfill that part it would that prophecy would go into the ground as a failure but every time every time it looked like it was drawing itself out amen that person would step up ain't been supernaturally drawn and feel that place think about it I say I made a prophecy he didn't understand a virgin shall conceive aiming and that prophecy went around and around and around and around the world and it kept going around waiting for a womb to anchor in amen and it took about eight hundred years but one day there was a little virgin amen only about fifteen or sixteen years old hey man you don't have to be super spiritual a great of age to a man come and fulfill a and part of the Word of God and she's just walking to the well there's a flicker of light and there's an angel standing there and I'm going to begin to tell her you're highly favored of God it didn't seem to make sense to her one person that had to say be it unto me according to thy word amen Genesis 24 is a major part of the puzzle explaining God's purpose at the end time in fact amen amen God used this scripture amen to point out amen brother Venom's brother branham's Commission and what God had placed him on the earth to do go get a bride for Isaac amen it's a stand out message that has been preached it's been sung about the father the faithful servant the presence of the angel the woman at the evening time watering the camels and the decision to go meet Isaac little did they know that they were living out the desire of the of God to bring a bride in this evening time who would be faithful to the servants message so you would think that past experiences and blessings would teach him the right moves Rebekah is barren and Isaac entreated the Lord and the Lord heard his prayer and in Rebecca's pregnancy the children struggled together in the womb prompting her to ask the Lord at it if this pregnancy is really of you why do I have this struggle you see because it's human nature to think that God cannot be in something if it's a struggle can I say that again it's human nature to think that God cannot be in something if it's not a struggle we want it to come easy we don't understand the struggle but God was faithful to her to reveal to her that you have two nations in your womb and that separation has already begun in your body and the elder will serve the younger now this is prophecy this is direct word of the Lord the elder shall serve the younger we don't underst wrong understand the struggles we have and it is because the separation has already begun as as as birth is fixing to come forth it is a pain so I brother Branham preached the birth pains and talked about the struggle that the earth was under me but he said it's fixing to birth and it's a struggle we don't want the struggle but the struggle is necessary to the fulfilling of the Word of God amen you know brother bana made a statement that the Pentecostals don't like but whether it is he says God's side is always weak thank you for a men in that God's eyes is always weak he said but that's how God uses them he said that's God's Way of getting to us is when we're weak now I want you to notice something particulars we just come through this at the birth of Esau and Jacob caused the separation in the household of Isaac and Rebekah because they played the favorites and because they played the favorites it affected the way they looked at the prophecy the prophecies holy the prophecy is God's Word the prophecy cannot be changed no matter how you try to say it change it no you try to dress it up it is what it says it is the elder shall serve the younger but look at this because they have favourites it influenced the way they dealt with their children the Wills and affections of the parents worse at odds with the working of the Holy Ghost you know that causes confusion in the home and I know this may seem strange as a as a youth camp message but you know what you know we we need to to come right down to the level of our lives begin to deal in those levels and maybe you're sitting here and maybe things have been at odds that you're in your household amen and it sets you at odds with the Word of God with the working of the Holy Ghost but God has already made a statement and God is faithful to his words and no matter how much we try to intervene Amen and try to work Amen according to the permissive will of God God will make it work back for his glory because it's now up to God to fulfill his word brother Branham said in the message Satan's even that the Spirit of God is not something that is schooled into you can I say that again you know since we're tired sometimes we have to repeat ourselves but the problem with repeating ourselves it's going to take longer to get through this amen but he said Amen that the Spirit of God is not something that can be schooled into you it is something that is predestinated into you amen what is predestination it's the thought of God it's the destiny of your life Amen in God predestinated predestined it to take place think about it now what if this moment here in this building even in your tiredness God has said I have predestined in this night for them to receive my life glory it's something that's predestinated into you by the hand of Almighty God your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you want to rebuke to the churches you know we've spent hours and we spent years of ministry trying to explain the Holy Ghost experience to people and many times it's coming out of our own experience amen but let me just tell you this I mean my experience cannot be yours I mean if my experience causes you to act like me if I'm a hear of preach and I I shake my head and then my whole congregation shaking my head what do I got them in the spirit of I got them in my spirit brother BAM said what the minister should always stay in the spirit of the word amen so that the spirit of the word will be upon the people amen so I'm coming to you not in my own spirit but I'm coming to you in the spirit of the word so that as you're here and you begin to open yourself up to the Word of God say where they God speak a mean word of God move word of god make the things of my life coming right to the Word of God that's supernatural glory it's predestinated by God's hand and it's predestinated by God's knowledge into you but in the home of Isaac and Rebekah there's differences of opinions and desires and both are true to the object of their desires Isaac loved Esau best Isaac is a prophet but he is moved by the venison he's moved by the character of Esau to set his affections upon Esau so it causes him to set aside the will of God and aim at the wrong object the supernatural is not moved by us but I'll say that the supernatural has moved in on us we see the same characteristic and he saw that when he's hungry he sells his birthright for a bowl of pottage amen he took a holy thing and he watered it down to his desire at that moment young people don't miss this moment don't set aside the preaching of the word for some fantasy or imagination that's in your mind right now don't set it aside for some worldly friendship or some connection that you got in your spirit that's not of God don't set it aside for some pleasure he set it aside Rebekah is aiming at the right object which is Jacob her favorite but she's doing it in a sinful way both are trying to have faith and both are trying to bring the word to pass and both are wrong you see so the motives of the parents aimed the children in the wrong direction the Bible says in the Book of Psalms 127 chapter lo children our heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man a mighty man is a man of experience a mighty man is a man who's fought battles that's why he's called mighty that he's been victorious in and he said his children are as arrows in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate so if you have an arrow in your quiver God you that arrow so that the mighty man could aim it at the right target our children are to be aimed at the right target are you with me you children are to be aimed at the right target what is the target you know what I mean the world has come in and and wrapped its tentacles around our thinking and around our opinions until we a men begin to let the culture affect the way we live the message we begin to we begin to put our emphasis amen on our on our schooling's and on our ambitions and upon everything that we even want to do in life and don't see how far we begin to step away from the will of God when God says I want to aim you I want to make your life something that hits the target that you won't be left in confusion but when I shoot it out of the bowl it hits the bull's eye every time and you'll be able to speak with the enemy and the dictates of judgment we don't want our young people confused we don't want our young people showing up to church because their daddy and mommy dragged him there come on God made a promise that he would bless but those blessings are under condition and you've got to meet the conditions to make it work this may seem like it's off topic but you just just bear with me brother Bantam said I was sitting with a little sweet girl here and first I calmed that family through to see if there is anything wrong because they was wanting to be healed he said God would heal but it's under conditions and the only thing I found was the mother was afraid it was wrong to take medicine now who told her is wrong to take medicine somewhere along the line her faith got scrupled up with if I take medicine I don't have faith and the angel of the Lord pointed that out in her life and said that's the only thing wrong that's hindering that healing a man he said he said don't you take don't you think that sister get that out of your mind go right ahead with the child and give it the medicine God will make it known it ever because her faith I mean has been so misconstrued we tried to live up to a pattern we've tried to live up to a style we've tried to live up to a presentation that it has to be a certain way and if I if I'm not healed I don't have faith and oh man my truth my toothache hurts Oh God heal my toothache God hear my god why do I have a toothache and I must not have rapture in faith the message has been presented wrong that's nothing to do with rapture in faith brother Branham was speaking to a church that did not believe in divine healing they actively taught against divine healing man you can even brother branham amen had a reoccurrence of a stomach problem every 7 years of his life amen so I've heard it said that if brother Brant brother I heard us say that brother meant him died because he didn't have rapture in faith it's been preached over pulpit that's nonsense that's foolishness what is rapture in faith you are chicken in a barnyard you only knew how to look at the ground ami but one day an eagle stream and it took your eyes off the ground and you lifted your eyes heavenward now you're no longer looking at ugly things your eyes are on heavenly that's rapturing faith that kind of teaching that kind of teaching only brings in legalism on the church and begins to kill the people one by one by one Satan it's like a roaring lion and he cloaks himself in the theologies of people that handle the message wrong God help me to handle the message rightly define the truth we are called to be stewards of the Word of God not to use it as a club to beat the church down every time they try to rise up in revolution you just forgive me I'm acting like I'm at home I always find out brother bam said these people are trying to manufacture something and people you come to God for the Holy Ghost tonight don't come because your mom wants to you don't come with a certain style or a certain way and hope it works out I'll see if it happens brother BAM said people are trying to help God to make his promise come true I'm gonna go in something real personal here in the message of paradox brother BAM talks about something very personal but no doubt it'll affect lives in this building because even human nature runs the church once true he said a lot of modernists believe that the days of miracles are past they don't believe there's such a thing as America but yet I believe the world is full of miracles for instance I believe that every born-again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves that's a miracle amen I want a confession here this evening how many been born again stand to your feet and you say there's no miracles happening look at all the miracles sit down thank you it's quite a statement that's people that escape the clutches of Satan all you men stand up they got the Holy Ghost just the men aw just the elder man you you you boys say stay down it's the elders okay everybody turn to look at these men everybody how many of you men standing up have been tempted to quit raise your hand well good grief how many of you men standing up the devil told you that you've had that thought in your mind many times more than once you don't have the Holy Ghost look people look at him now look at him why in the world is a Holy Ghost film in fighting these kind of battles how many of men they then have felt old desires try to climb back up in you come on come at your door come on raise your hand people look at them old desires try to come back try to haunt you pick at your windows brother ben says torment you look young people they got the Holy Ghost and they got real life struggles many of these are preachers or maybe all how many of you preachers raise your hand and they raise their hand their preacher and here they've they said they felt they felt old desires try to come back I didn't say they came back as they try to come back they've been told they don't have the Holy Ghost they've been told give up how many of you how many of you've had real life frustrations that nobody else knows about you went home and you wept about it it haunted you and troubled you maybe you even went into oppression and a little bit of nervousness and maybe complexes started coming on you and these are Christians and you thought a man that serving God is a picnic serving God is about how many mysteries you know how intelligently you can disperse it and hey let me tell you God did not talk to you about the third Pole amen in the opening of the word for them to be slogans in your life then the long as week Amen keep talking about it Amen that people say by that person's spiritual they really know a lot you can brother could sit down for a moment thank you I hope you stay awake a little bit longer I Pat myself on the back for that you see amen we make this a slogan what camp are you in and that camp reacts according to the nature of that slogan that is not what God ever intended the message to me like he never intended the message to be a choice of churches and a choice of dogma I'm just going to preach anyhow he always the message is Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever this message is about the life of God and it's a paradox Oh hallelujah say brother Danny you must have come from a Pentecostal background wrong I came from a midnight background they don't even know how to move well I'm telling you this has nothing to do with my background this has to do with my family tree that comes from glory I'm not obvious first I got a family tree I have a goodly heritage young people let me tell you something hey man I'm a never poor Jacob he's gonna be in limbo for the rest of his life for the rest of his sermons amen amen hallelujah you know what is said about that Scripture in the Book of Psalms it says I have a goodly heritage the lines are fallen to me in Pleasant places it was said of that scripture that that's must have been what Jesus Christ thought as he walked towards Calvary I have a goodly heritage I have some young people here in New Zealand the lines have fallen into me in Pleasant places for I know that rise up in the hour that I'm predestinated and they are going to accept what I have done they're not going to set back but they're going to be real soldiers and step out of the muck of their life they're going to be that Lily that comes up out of the mud and they press their way hallelujah you're going to press your way through it and you're gonna come up and shine on the surface I don't care what your parents have done I don't care about the mess in your life we got a God that knows how to take all the tangles amen and put it all back together here you haven't gone in this room right now who's willing to pick you up well you don't know where my life has been Danny you don't know where my life has been you don't know the mess it's been through my lights my virtue is gone my life is ruined I can never come back but God said let me tell you again but God said this is the problem you've been talking too much it's time to hear what God has to say about there is no weapon formed against you that is selma plus but i'll bring you out of your mess i'll bring you out of your destruction I'll give you the oil enjoy some of you don't know what's going on right now but that's the Holy Ghost coming to your door we have never lived in an hour of such perversion we have never lived in such a mess until God said this is Satan see Amen Satan is the god of this earth but I'm turning the tables Haman he came into my perfection Amen Eve had no nothing to look back to and say this is why I'm going to fall she was in a perfect team she had perfect health she had no family problem it was perfection and she fell and now in this evil age here you come marriages mixed up lives are perverted homosexual on the rampage coming in on her young people but God said in that hour in the hour of Satan team I'm going to bring a bride up there fear will be a glorious branch how many young people willing to take that challenge I'm gonna be that one you gotta quit looking at your fast you've gotta quit giving excuses this God is not a God in this week this is a God who just opened his arms and then the stars begin before that's the god that's here and if you think my life can't be a real race he arranged all of that out of all that chaos amen he brought the sun the moon the stars in the midst of darkness he said let there be light but he's asking you one thing are you gonna come to me like somebody else are you gonna come to me as you are come on here daddy might have said you act like me go to church do what I do you're getting the Holy Ghost you had no guarantee of that so the church dress tough eat Jacob to meet his daddy says you act like your brother you're going to get the blessing you see hey man Jacob went in to act like he saw in order to get the blessing but he had a blind daddy he was a prophet but God don't show his prophets everything and prophets can make great mistakes the Prophet said and here's a prophet Isaac his eyes are blind and they took advantage of his blindness and they dressed him up to look like his brothers how many times have you come to church and try to aim in right and try to live right trying to do the right thing but it's because you're acting like somebody else nothing can come beliefs that but God wants you to stand up with your mess stand up as you are aim you may be ashamed of us stand up with it be a real man now tonight bring it up before clocks a clock I'm trapped in pornography I don't know how to get out stand up and be a man let me just tell you something that same angel that supported me is supporting you right now and he's telling you you need to stand up and acknowledge that he's here and he wants to set you free this evening into a glorious place you've never experienced before [Applause] [Music] Jacob thought if I smell right I talk like he saw if I act like him my father's going to give me the blessing they tell you Feder trusted in the Word of God that said a min the elder shall serve the younger God was gonna bring it to pass glory to many been dressed up in Esau's clothes you smell like he saw problem with that prophet was he heard the voice but he went by his feelings hey man there's many of you caught in that right now I don't feel like a brother named I don't feel I don't it just don't feel right hey man who cares about your feelings this is the person of Christ you need to make a move when you hear that voice talking to you you think where you're at is cool you think where you're at is gonna be something well brother day I just want to go out there and live my time I want to experience the world look at these people they've been in drugs even they've been in sexual perversions they've been in all these things but God who is rich in mercy from that they're here to tell you there's nothing in that life for you hey better Danny I just got some friends I can't cut the ties let me tell you them are not your friends I said them are not your friends they were your sinner buddies them are not your friends and your friends I'm telling you the truth flea that flee to the cross when Jacob tried to get the blessing he said I am he saw many of you've come here and you've identified yourself wrong here's a

bring you to the real birthright amen and his brother was coming with an army of 400 men we're gonna take care of this little message believer who thinks he can steal things from me and act like a hypocrite now I know what kind of peoples in this message I never finished that quote on the paradox well that's the kind that's in the message my daddy said about my uncle before my daddy was converted my uncle was converted first come out of Vietnam war he was a druggie and a hippie and all of that and my dad and my mom want to go the baptism said my my back Michael Sam's getting or Sam's getting baptized kind of go the bets that says yeah that's a kind of it's in the message a bunch of hippies and drug addicts hey man it's fine wonderful they were hey man and when when Jacob knew hey men that he could not escape the confrontation of his past his birthright was gonna kill him I'll tell you something this message is gonna kill you it's gonna kill you because you've just been running along under the coverage of it hey man I'm a believer I do that I show up to church say man I dress nice don't I whoo I must be a believer that don't make you nothin come on surely God wanted my attendance really Judas attended faithfully come on I'm on I couldn't make you confront your past and when you confront your past you're going to talk right wonder who's going to treat this meeting as

we're gonna see you raise your hand they're gonna be a real man and a real woman and Jacob said okay I've got to get serious with this thing and he sent his family across the brook and they sit there and a man appeared to him because this holy ghost is not the holy ghost with sensation it's the person person of Jesus Christ a man and he begin to wrestle with that man and he wrestled all night I'm telling you that man wasn't weak but the Bible says in Hosea Amen that this man prevailed over God he didn't a man overpower God with his strength God can point at a devil and that devil has to go with one finger get out get out of this room get out of this gym get out of that young man that devil has to go Devils are scared tonight hey man cuz they know and then if you decide you tell you what's going on right now you want to know though man said I a man he said the preaching of the word does not save you it does not heal you it's God that does all of that but what the preaching of the word does is the devil that is upon you has to stand back and let you listen to that service and make your choice and right now that devil has left your chair and he's standing over in the wings and you know don't believe don't believe what you hear but there's angels of God standing right beside you let's say come on Justin this is your time and this is your hour slam you stand up and believe it hey man that God is here and he's giving you your opportunity but you got to be a man with it quit being a child with this message I got secrets in my life I got perverse and I got this I got that well glory to God hey man he's a man of sorrows he's acquainted with grief a min the chastisement of our sins was laid upon him all we like sheep have gone astray amen but he took our sin and he laid it upon him Oh hallelujah before I come to Jacobs and Jacob had to talk right and when he wrestled if you go back and read in Genesis 27 when II saw a man when Jacob was stealing the blessings amen and he's smelling and acting like he saw Isaac says who are you and he said I am Esau now he's wrestling with a man but it's not his father it's the man that met him in a dream and said hey man I'm not going to leave you until I have performed what I said to Abraham I'm going to bring it to pass so to you let me tell you God's not gonna leave you young people and T brings to pass what he promised through Peter hate me for this promise is unto you and to these children right here in this room amen as many as are far off as many as our Lord our God shall call here give me the Holy Ghost tonight that man wrestled with with Jacob and man showed he could have stopped Jacob at any moment because all he did was with one touch and he limped the rest of his life but he was wrestling with him and some of you being wrestled with right now why that man he's wrestling with you should I break through that shyness should I break through that barrier that's always stood in the way should I really be myself tonight and say God I wanna I'm gonna I'm gonna make that step [Applause] then God's gonna ask you who are you I'm Jacob I'm a swindler I'm a cheat I'm in pornography I can't break a gaming addiction I've got idols in my life I don't know how to get away from I got friends I don't know how to break the relationship off let me tell you something because you were honest with me I'm gonna call you something else I'm gonna call you something else you're no longer as a planner you're no longer a cheat but you're a print with God your name is Israel you're ready for a name change tonight I said oh you're ready for a name change are you ready for a different walk are you ready for a different talk are you ready for God to come into the sin of your life and are you ready for your life to begin to express what this message is all about we have a God deliverance yeah he's here they just relate to you for something very personal just maybe a couple personal things God wants me to relate to you it'll help you cuz you got to be yourself with God you know too many of us we've been in a message too long we hear the pastor say something brother BAM stay with it yeah that's what he said hey man amen amen preach it brother oh you're good you're good you know how to act you know how to talk you know what you are you're just a good Baptist there's a lot of Baptists in the message they just believe and they think that's all I got to do you have to have no power in their life to live a bust and it's the good Baptist a lot of Catholics in the message put a lot of idols in front of them even brother branham's an idol in front of them but you have a bunch of Catholics come on amen oh we got a bunch of Pentecostals in the message you've relied upon a sensation you've relied upon jumping you've relied upon shock we say no Danny are you speaking about all these brothers at a jump in here are you talking about alpha oh no you didn't hear me this morning then did you we can worship our God with the same exuberance as they worship their gods out there hey man but if you would ask how far am i serving God because I jumped no he can serve God in the down time - hey man when the depression come in are you still going to serve God yeah I want to still serve God amen when all the troubles rise around me I'll lift up my head and I still say I have a redeemer this faithful and true I'm gonna talk to young people about a faithful God tonight you got a faithful God I said you have a faithful God says it's going to give you - two - two stories I might give you three if I can remember I was doing a counseling session one time I don't like counseling sessions because half the time people don't tell the truth well they let me up that percentage 75% of time they don't tell the truth maybe I setup that percentage they just want me to take her side her dealing with a couple had marital problems that's shocking in the message there's marital problems because I found out after thirty years of ministry that actually there's actually humans in the message I didn't think they were I had a couple come in they were so rancorous to each others had so much problems from other when they came in to actually get counselors all right if I sit down thank you Amen yeah I pulled a chair upset right in front of them like I'm sitting in front of you and and they they were so at odds with one another that they actually faced me like this had their back to each other and they faced me like this so some of you came to church tonight so I began to talk to them and out of their mouth is he's done this and he's done that and out of her mouth is she's done this and she's done that and yes she's done this and he's done that she's done this and he's done that and she's done this and he's done that and she's done this and he's done that and she's done this and he's done that and you know they weren't being men and women was the problem I got tired of it I said alright you gonna mean business turn and look at one another it's couple been married for decades you should have saw how hard it was I said turn and face one another they faced one another I said take each other's hands I mean they had children and they you got it and they finally took one that's how hard it can get I said you know what we're not gonna be able to fix the problem by finding out how bad she is and how bad he is I told him cuz he's the head of the home he should know she's not a doormat he's not the head of the home in name only he thought he was I said tell me the best thing that comes to your mind that you can think about her it was a paradox he looked at her and he looked away he looked at her she goes you're gonna laugh but this was true well she makes good cookies I said is that all well I like how she rubs my back when it hurts he just started saying it started saying and I said now you say something nice she started saying something you know what happened all of a sudden the fourth man came he dropped down and the tears begin to roll out of their eyes I stood up I said you know what my counseling is done you make up you know because it has to become a paradox where you try to you try to go down every road and everything and it's just nothing but resentment and blame and everything pointing out you got to just open up before God this is the woman I love this is a woman I'm married who bore my children who took my name this is the man who took the responsibility of my my care upon him himself this is the man a man who's been with me all my life and here we have gum we have narrowed down our relationship to this well let me just tell you young people the Lord Jesus is not sick to you tonight but he's looking directly at you and he one I want to tell you the best things I can think about you you're all fair my love you're all fair there is no spot in you brother Danny what but what about it what about there is no spot on you that's what the word says because the word says it about you it is my obligation to bring you up to that now I'm gonna get real person anyway how's that okay sorry you see the devil don't like this because he knows you kids are gonna come out and so I got this call and this pastor is relating this story to me he had something happen in his church one of the married men in his church had went out and had an affair with another married man in a denominational Church homosexual affair both of those men were trapped in a place they didn't know well to get out of it but they wanted to get out of it they went to psychologist after psychologists nobody could help them they spent hours and hours and Rehab nothing could help them they went they went to the denominational pastor nothing helped one day that pastor was talking to the brother and his congregation when it started to come out and he found out about it he began to talk to him and that man was on the phone he says you don't know you don't know what it's like to be tempted by homosexuality the pastor's like I don't know he said you don't know he stirred screaming and crying said you don't know and the Holy Spirit spoke to the pastor and said tell him I know what it's like Jesus Christ was tempted yet without sin in all points a hair stood up on the back of my head and when he said that the phone went quiet then the man began to weep and deliverance came in and that man said I'm gonna come to church and I'm gonna confess what I've done before the church I'm gonna let him know that I've been set free and I'm gonna go to that denominational Church and I'm gonna let him know not only did God set that boy free he set the boy in the denominational Church free and that boy in the denominational Church said powers and hours of rehab nothing happened but five minutes five minutes come on in the presence of God amen because you have a man who is touched by the feeling of your infirmity it's time to get real with God who are you I am Jacob I am Jacob there was a day that our Lord Jesus was walking toward Calvary and he had made his decision in the Garden of Eden Lord if it be possible let this cup pass from me hi I would like to spend more time with the disciples he had a right to get married he had a right to a longer life but it was the hour of decision the angels of God had lined up in the bushes around there the demons of Hell had come in and they were all watching what is he going to say and the God began to talk to him can you take the sin of adultery can you take the sin of gambling can you take the sin of lust can you take this sin can you take that because there if your to be a high priest you've got to be able to take it and he said not my will but yours be done and the spirit left him there because he had to die like a man he had to die as a man God could not die but you and I were still in him there and he left he left the garden and he went out as a man he's hard into the pilots amen judgement hall and he's standing there and he says tell us who you are and he shut his mouth because he's not going to give any excuse to miss this death I said he's not gonna give any excuse to miss this death he opened up his mouth to begin to defend himself he had take away the power of Calvary because it says he open his shares he's dumb and he can't tell us who you are and he examined him and he turned to the rulers he said I don't find any fault in this man they said good salmon him again and he come and he looked and he talked to him again and he just stood there amen and he'd only answered the questions that took not away from what he was going to do he turned again and he says I find no fault in the man he said you got to you got to give him up then on this and this time it's just this season amen amen we can give up a prisoner so another one could take his place crucify him it's got to be you you've got to deliver him and he opened up the doors to the crowd and he says behold the man I find no fault in him brother Branham said God will make Satan testify and the Prophet said we hadn't separated yet from that body we were still in him and he says behold the man I find no fault say it with me in him three times the enemy pronounced there's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong he was only given over to Calvary to be a substitute amen and now he's going to the cross as a man he's been beaten more than any man's been beaten his bones are staring out I mean they took the the cat-o'-nine-tails and when they it had the hooks on it they hit it and it hooked his self and his flesh and they rip it out again and every time it ripped it rip flesh out until finally my bones my bones they stare at me till even his organs are beginning to show through the skin he's been beat beyond recognition there is no beauty in him that we should desire him he's been beaten till he's unrecognizable it's globs of spit on his face a crowned champ down in his head and he's weakening because a mortal man can't take this kind of punishment they put a cross on him a beam and he begins to walk and now he's struggling and he's walking young people why don't you step into this moment now because he's making that walk for you you don't even understand it and then he's beginning he's laboring in his walk and he can hardly hardly do it and finally he falls down on the ground hey man there's a black man alpha come over here there's a black man standing off there watch it man Jesus can't get up but Rome calls out to him help him alpha reach down because Jesus knows what it's like to need human assistance and they said alpha I'm just calling you alpha take his cross and he put it on and getting to walk in front of him and Jesus staggering behind him and the blood on that cross is falling down upon alpha hey man thank you God never forgotten what that man did for him was he laid on the ground now Jesus can stand him say I noticed like to need another human give me a hand up giving your hand this evening you're not too far you're just laying on the ground amen but now it's time to be a man I'm gonna pick you up by the Word of God over 2,000 years later in the town called Jonesboro Arkansas there's a commotion going on there's a man by the name of William Branham you gonna eight straight days of meetings to this day to this day and Jonesboro Arkansas the message he preached in the 50s the pillar of fire still the most popular sermon ever preached in Jonesboro Arkansas to this day he's there and because he's inside and the people don't know who he is nobody knows what he looks like on the outside and brother Branham had been called to pray for a person in in the ambulance and so he goes and he works his way through the crowd nobody knows who he is he's going through the crowd he gets in that ambulance she prays for four I believe as a dead person is that right was it dead or almost dead or something it was it was sick and the Lord healed the man in the ambulance and so they they sent him out of the ambulance another way so he could try to work himself back up into that building and while he's going there he's trying to get his way back into the church and the people so jams tight together and they don't recognize brother Branham he's trying to work and say watch where you're stepping and they're talking to brother Branham and they're waiting for brother Branham and they're trying to say get out of the way cuz they don't know what he looks like and as he's walking he hears a voice crawling out somebody help me somebody help me find my father help me somebody help me somebody help me find my father a little black blind girl had got lost in the crowd got away from her parents and brother branham said nobody was helping her he said I worked my way over to where she was at and I kind of got in front of her and she's walking somebody help me somebody help me he stepped in the way there and he says why are you here says I'm booked she begin to talk to said I'm blind and I heard about another blind man they'd been healed in these means I knew if God would do it for him he would do it for me amen young people if God would do it for some other generation I promise you here do it for this generation if he would feel another generation with the Holy Ghost here feel this generation with the Holy Ghost amen there's no sin too far there's no place you gone that the hand of God cannot reach you your staggering and darkness but God has worked his way through the crowd and he's standing in front of your chair brother Branham began to say you don't really believe that do you you don't really believe that he's still the same yesterday today and forever he still heals like that do you she began to talk to him said mister if you take me to that man I'll find my daddy myself I said I'll find my daddy myself brother Bentham says perhaps I'm the one you're looking for insane crap are you are you brother branham
