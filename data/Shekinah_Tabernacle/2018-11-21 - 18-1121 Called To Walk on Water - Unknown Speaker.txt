and be brought right into harmony with your heartbeat hallelujah Lord bring us into Union and keep us there Lord and may you tune our thinking and calibrate us Lord to stay and rhythm Lord and keep in line or guard with the word and with the very the rhythm of your symphony as it beats out the very will of God in this hour or father and the midst of this perilous seas that are raging all around her father there is an anchor there is a stabilizer on the ship father all Lord may your word just become and stabilize father the ship of Zion that we sail together and as individual I commit these things to you I pray father you just take over Lord have your way tonight Lord I just came at these things into your hands and Jesus Christ name Amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen thank you musicians hallelujah while you're standing let's just turn in our Bibles to Ephesians chapter five I was going to speak sorry I once I was gonna sing a song and open the eyes of my heart Lord to see you high and lifted up that you know it was a different team pone wasn't gonna merge into the from that song so the praise the Lord anyway I'll talk about that you know that's what we want that's what we desire tonight as like Isaiah and as is-6 I mean you know God just caught him up and he saw the Lord as he is he saw the Lord High and lifted up a man he saw the worship of God he saw God in his position and I want to tell you tonight and you many have heard it and I'll just remind you because Peter seemed like to bring these things into remembrance that we have also been called into that relationship tonight you can see him high and lifted you can behold one that sitteth upon the throne they meant he caught up into his throne room hallelujah Ephesians 5:25 26 and 27 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself so there's a is a key right there a mystery to be unfolded and I believe it has been unfolded in the statement that he might present it her the church to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish maybe the Lord is blessing to his word you can have your seats hallelujah well you see here the Lord has a desire in his heart here's a purpose in his heart he wants to restore the woman he wants to restore the woman the feminine image of God that says desire he wants to restore her and that is the joy that's been in his heart since before the world even began he's wanted to restore that because he knew that she would fall amen she and he knew that their Eve would fall the woman and the garden would fall so he needed to restore that and we believe now that this was coming to pass in the hour that we're living in hallelujah and it has been going on for the last two thousand years hallelujah since the gospel went forth and the church era started and the New Testament began to minister freedom amen and when the voice of the blood of Christ started to speak and cause freedom to come upon the people he began to rebuild the female image he began to rebuild the church amen and she's been through many appear Allah sees many are trials many of persecutions she suffered she's gone through at all but through it all God has always come out victorious amen and here's all he's just rebuilding he's rebuilding you know when you're in a situation that might look like it's completely like just gone but to God it's a different story amen God has it all in control he's the great Orchestrator Amen hallelujah well I won't get ahead of myself let's just go to Ephesians 32 and I just want to you know just uh sorry Ephesians 5 verse 32 and it says here this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church amen so it's a great mystery it's not just a mystery but it's a great mystery but and really when you start to see these things you'll find the whole Bible is kind of centered around this very mystery of the man and the woman getting married amen and through that marriage would come redemption of no matter what state that woman was in in the story and it's through all of the holy prophets and all of the stories of the Bible you'll see there is an account of this particular thing happen where a woman was in trouble and she was completely just out of her position and then through marriage and through Redemption and a foreshadow and through the Old Testament stories you find a redemption by marriage hallelujah where no matter what condition or what state that woman was in she came into a perfect position in God's will and her life wrote the Bible that you read hallelujah amen and that's the power of God without interfering with their free will and all so God was very amazing actually more beyond anything we could ever imagine so you never need to worry about anything ever again don't worry about anything ever again if you just trust in Him who will not leave you amen nor forsake you amen no matter how tumultuously release the Seas you may be walking don't you take your eyes off him hallelujah you know if you take if you keep your eyes on him you will remain in the faith of the Son of God amen and you will walk on the water hallelujah you have been called to walk on water and that's what I want to speak on tonight as being called to walk on water we're not called to sink amen and the bride and this last day the church at the end when it's the very masterpiece of God's building hallelujah the very the very crescendo of God's symphony that all the stories of the prophets and all of the everything in the Bible points to the hour that you're living in hallelujah and by God's grace you are becoming the masterpiece of God's crescendo hallelujah amen and you just happened to be living in this hour and he made you for this hour and he made you and is calling you to walk on water amen hallelujah I won't get ahead of myself again but we'll just carry on here in an ex 3:19 it says here this is the way that she's restored and one view of it you could say annex --an 3 verse 19 we read repent ye therefore and be converted amen very nice and plain and simple hallelujah turn from your old ways your old thinking everything that you thought you were and everything you thought God was Amen just turn from it all and just just get converted come has provided wait hello Louie and and if you want to know who's provided way the Apostles did it Amen just so simple repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen well repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come here we see that Luke in the book of Acts is pointing and his narrative to a future event that there will be a time of refreshing to come from the presence of the Lord hallelujah you know back in 1947 when the angel of the Lord came to the Prophet on the very day of the inauguration of Israel and how it all kind of synchronized together in God's great plan where did the angel say he came from amen he came from the presence of the law amen it's very important when an angel of the Lord comes he's coming from the presence of the Lord and he has a message hallelujah amen if it's just a whole lot of miracles but no message then you can just forget about it because God doesn't do a show just to be a show when God sends a ministry there is always a voice behind that hallelujah and it's that voice that will bring divided division between light and dark it's that voice that will bring the new birth to its full extent it's that voice that will actually separate the sheep from the goats in that age it's that voice that will bring the new birth for the people that hear it hallelujah when God speaks amen but so here we have the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and in verse 20 and he shall send Jesus Christ so there will come a time you know in the future from their age that they were living and there would be a refreshing there would be a rejuvenating of the church because obviously the church would go through so many trials and so much hardship and so much too much was the sea would get so rough that the ship would start rocking and water would come in and there would be all sorts of troubles but at the end of it God would restore it he would bring it back and how would he do it he would send Jesus Christ amen there would come a time where a mist where a reformers and we're teachers and we're pastors and all of those would not be enough to do the restoration work would not be enough to bring everything back together tie all the loose ends that the church was found herself in it would have to be Jesus Christ himself praise Allah amen I did brought it I brought it down because I didn't want to like bang into it or you know things get a bit active up here some prepare you know amen we'll see what happens this is more of a teaching but well yeah I just lift them in the Lord's hands so amen so so yes so he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached right so before the sending of Jesus Christ himself Jesus Christ was preached about he was taught the precepts of the Bible were taught and everyone was teaching about Jesus Christ but then one day the very person will minister it himself and he would tie it all together himself now there's no other way and I'll get into it a bit later but there's no other way for that to happen other than through the office of a word prophet there's no other way no teacher a teacher we'll have a little portion they'll get inspiration and they'll see the Scriptures come together but it's not verbatim it's not that they're not exactly a full-time mouthpiece of God their subconscious and their conscious minds are not perfect we won together where God just speaks and they see the vision God makes a word prophet a word prophet to be a channel amen and there's two there's two main prompt there's a lot of different obviously God as a God a variety but I've seen you know there's two different types of prophet like major prophets in the Bible there's a major prophet that writes the scripture like Isaiah Ezekiel Moses and then is a major prophet that that takes the scripture and makes it live there and that's like Samuel so Samuel as far as we know did not write anything himself but there was a narration about him and he was a major prophet that took the very you know the the very few the the condition of a nation and and and turned it around and brought the vision back to a nation and that was that's a different type of prophet so you see there's two types of prophets in the scripture and the end time prophet because the Canon of Scripture has been completed there is no more scripture to be written per se written text so therefore there is no need for a prophet to come to write more Bible but there was need to be a prophet like Samuel to bring a vision of God a heavenly vision back so that the very voice of God and the presence of God and the approach to God could be restored so that all the word and all the interpretation of the word would come together so the people could have be anchored in the fullness of the truth and when you believe that watch what happens Alleluia Amen you'll walk on water amen all things hallelujah so it says here which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things that word restitution to us like a reconstitution that's like putting the water back in something that's gone dry amen and I'm so glad that he's come with the rain you know the rain come down tonight and a natural but you see there's a spiritual rain raining upon the people there is a letter rain in a former rain coming together so we're new here teaching when you hear the word coming forth it's not just knowledge to you you don't have to keep it as knowledge if you don't want it to be if you want it to be more than knowledge I can encourage you that the letter rain is falling and you can have it quick into your heart you can have it quick into your soul and you can receive a new birth in your seat hallelujah you can be changed now hallelujah amen because we are in an age with a former letter rain of falling together hallelujah because God is tying everything back up so that you can walk on the water amen so that you can rise up above the circumstances of this world so that you can rise up above all the demonic power that is trying to destroy you you can walk on the water tonight Alleluia He is calling you he's calling all of us to walk on the water and continue walking because we're in an age where we won't sink hallelujah you know walking on the water is walking in Adam's shoes before the fall don't you you know because when Adam before the fall he had dominion over everything he had dominion over nature he had dominion over the animals was first to see everything and so when you see Jesus Amen when you see Jesus coming he was he had Dominion and he showed the very Dominion to Adam lost that's why he was the second Adam you know the second Adam come to declare and to reveal everything that the first Adam lost and that second Adam his main purpose was though that you would also do the same things hallelujah and he's very patient he's been waiting a long time God's been waiting 2,000 years for his church to recognize what's going on recognize the power in his blood tonight you can feel that car you can have that power tonight the blood can speak to you hallelujah it can speak I hear the sound of freedom amen what was that song remember that song you know the blood still cries freedom hallelujah I'm so glad about that and the power of that blood when that was released on the day hallelujah when he hung between heaven and earth with a power that blood is here tonight hallelujah to bring you to God's River realization hallelujah and the water the restitution the reconstitution of your life can happen now because that's what is here to do and the most important thing we can find out you know once once we hear about Jesus and we hear about that we start to believe that he's real the most important thing we can do is give all diligence to make our calling and election sure and just lay before God and let him come hallelujah so that you can recognize and see him and see what he's doing in the hour you know when you find out what God is doing in the hour that you're living in now you can get a vision for your life it's not until you do that otherwise you're just stabbing in the dark and you're like any other denomination and you might hear things and hear preaching and all that stuff and it might just float around in your mind but when God makes it real to you when it's quickened to you the very magnitude of what's going on in this very moment this hour and what God is doing a vision has been restored to the h.a vision can only come through a prophet that's the only way God brings a vision to an ageist through a prophetic Channel amen and when you catch that vision when he reveals that to you when he quickens that to you now you can seek God for the vision for your life based on that vision based on the vision of the age the vision that's been brought down Israel had no vision she had no vision she was scattered there you know hophni and Phinehas had been going and doing all sorts of things the High Priestess I clocked him you know all these things started falling apart they've went and fought the Philistines and they tried to rally themselves up they had a good old Pentecostal meeting but it didn't work because there was no vision it was no revelation of the word there was no vision there was no channel of inspiration from heaven to the earth to manifest God's will all there was was just the whole lot of rallying together and an excitement in singing all the church song trying to scare the enemy but the enemy called their bluff and they were defeated until God sent a prophet hallelujah he sent a prophet named Samuel and through that prophetic gift the vision was restored back and then the people could rise up hallelujah amen and you see at the time of venice' the Battle of Ebenezer this is one of the early battles in the time of Samuel what happened when when the prophet's ministry came into its possession hallelujah you know see what happened in the Thunder came amen hallelujah what are you under right now you are under a thundering message Amen hallelujah and where there's thunder there's lightning and where there's lightning this revelation of the word there is quickening power you can access that quickening power right now and that power will cause you to walk on the water you will walk on the water you are walking on the water walk on the water amen don't look at the Seas don't look at the things and all the politics and all those things going on it is all an orchestrated distraction don't look at it keep your eyes on him hallelujah he's walking on the water remember that this is the key here he is walking on the water not just you a man he walks on the water hey man he's got one foot on the water amen hallelujah and he stand here with an open book calling you to come and eat amen he wants you to walk on the water so that you could eat the word with him a man hallelujah I'm getting way down to the end of the sermon here a man but praise the Lord and Olivia I want to go back now just a little bit let's just go right back to the beginning here a little bit here and just see how God rebuilt the man he rebuilt the male image he needed to you see when Adam and Eve God created the earth and he and he brooded over the earth and he started to create and he brought all of creation up and up and up and it got more and more more and more detailed and more and more and more closer to his image until finally after six days of creation now it came time to create his very image and he put this image in the garden amen he planted a beautiful garden on the earth and then he put his son the very image of God in there but still wasn't complete then he put this man Adam to sleep and when he put him to sleep what happened out of his side came the revelation of Adams feminine part but when she was inside him he he was whole he was one but it wasn't the complete picture because he needed that love to come out and the love to be reciprocated and that's the joy of the relationship that's the joy of God is that there would be a woman with a man love each other and this is this this whole picture is the Bible and this whole picture is the Song of Solomon because through the Song of Solomon is very hard to discern but there is a man in a woman singing to each other they're communing with each other are you singing to him is your life singing are you singing the tune that he is singing as there our response is there now I don't mean just clapping and up and whatever I'm talking about a Holy Ghost eternity response a response from eternity to Eternity a response of the Shunammite in there and the son of David amen hallelujah the salt that the the you know Solomon was a type of Jesus Christ a type of the bridegroom and the Shunammite the bride amen and so you see there this song they should be singing to each other and this is a joy there is a joy there is a first love there is a an attraction amen now those seas that we're all raging around us they're raging Isaac brought it out very well perilous times absolutely perilous times we are and they come and comfort they come and convenience they come in all sorts of shapes and forms that's doesn't necessarily mean you're going through a trial that makes your flesh feel bad it's not just that you have those but there's trials that are different they are more cunning and they come in the form of comfort they come in the form of ease they come in the form of distraction they come in the form of lust they come in the form of all these different spirits and these spirits are everywhere Ten Thousand Devils of the I swear to drown you keep your eyes on him the whole time but don't just you know this is not just a pretty saying when I say keep your eyes on him I want to explain that a little bit it's not just I'm gonna keep my eyes on Jesus as like a catch phrase you know it's not a catch phrase there are something so real so real about your secret place there's something so real about your relationship with him hallelujah and if you don't have that dynamic that where he speaks to you doesn't matter what form he speaks but you there's a dialogue there's a conversation in your life if there isn't lay hold of it grab hold of that with all your strength and all your might you just lay it all down surrender everything leave no stone unturned lay it all down and say Lord don't want your conversation I want my life to be a song I want to sing but not with my mouth but with my heart to you hello Louie when you get that and you can have it's your inheritance they hold of it hallelujah because this is the fairy song this is the joy this is the desire of God this was the joy that was set before our King when he carried the cross up that hill that day amen hallelujah he was thinking of you and not just of you as a person but of the relationship that he would have with you and the joy of the song that your life would sing to him that's what he was thinking about that was what was on his mind because it says for the joy that was set before him you are their joy your response to his gospel your response to his song your response when he comes walking on the water a man when he's coming walking on the water in the churches and trouble hi Louie and he might have found you in some denominational boat hallelujah and the Seas have been perilous in this hour and here comes Jesus the Son of man walking on the water amen and he's coming to get you is coming to take you out hallelujah he's coming to call you to walk in the shoes of enna wants you to walk into a position where you rise up above the judgments of this earth where you rise up above the circumstances of this earth rise up in the name of the Lord rise up tonight step out of the boat spit out of the boat by faith keep your eyes on him don't think about what other people are thinking hallelujah you just think about what he's thinking his thoughts towards your our peace and love and unexpected in and he's come to give you power and love and a sound mind hallelujah a sound mind amen no more tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine no more uncertainty but a rock hallelujah because of a lower because of a joy when Jesus saw you when he was carrying that cross with his blood spilling on the earth and his organs hanging out of his body purchasing you what a price he thought of you hallelujah he thought very highly of that relationship Amen hallelujah and has been preached about the alabaster box so true break it don't hold anything back when you break that box it's no return it's no return no return hey man hallelujah amen glory to God you see now this is the relationship that Adam and Eve had before the fall and they had dominion over everything it was a perfect condition yet there was things in their life and circumstances that would bring them to the demise and that that perfect man and that perfect woman would fall and then God would sit in his heart and in his mind hallelujah that he would spin now than the Old Testament he would spend it rebuilding the image of the man and he did this you see because when they fell he promised that he would restore their image back he promised that he would crush the head of the serpent by the seed of the woman and the seed of the woman is the perfect man the image of Christ the image of a son of God what nm fell from and so you see over throughout the new Old Testament you have all these prophets coming with a portion of that character a portion of that nature of God that was manifested in them but just a portion because God was slowly revealing his true image and then finally after four thousand years he came on the earth himself God the kinsman redeemer became a man because a man lost it and a man a human needed to bring it back hallelujah it needed to be a man and I'm so glad for our champion hallelujah our champion came to bring it back hallelujah and he's brought it back and he's calling you to step out at the boat tonight to step out and walk on the water hallelujah it is possible because all things are possible because he's walking on the water amen and where the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart amen it makes me want to walk on the water amen that's what it is this is the this is the power invested a man that was going through his faith and he walked the earth and he ministered and he preached and he conducted himself because he was declaring the image of a true man the image of a son of God he took control over nature amen he had dominion he never went to a funeral hallelujah whenever people was sad he turned them into rejoicing amen because death had to flee hallelujah Amen no circumstance could take mastery over our king over our Lord because he was to clearing the image of a true man but that's not the end of the story there was an unexpressed part within him amen and this was the the part just like there was an unexpressed part in Adam and it took the father to put out him to sleep and open his side and bring out their unexpressed part for her to come to her position and have a love relationship that would respond ask the Lord the Lord I need that channel open to my life that the response would be the fullness of what you have purchased not just something that I've controlled up I've been preached then I feel excited so I'm gonna worship or your they's all good but it's more these are channels that the blood that which cries freedom he's making you free to respond like the shunammite responded to Solomon hallelujah amen and so you see here he had but he took he took victory over all that he spoke the word happened he had power over cooked food and he created food that was already cooked and they ate it all these things happen because he was declaring he had dominion and everything that had him lost hallelujah and he came and let me just read it now Matthew 14 verse 22 says in straightway Jesus constrained when you found the scriptures say Amen 14 verse 22 Romans smiling at me we were just saying that earlier 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him and to the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come at evening now it's a key evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea so the church that called the ecclesia of God which is the church has called people now what symbolically now has been called in there in the shippers eye on him but it's getting too rough and things are becoming too much hallelujah and the heads there come a time of restitution there has to come a time where he himself would come and he would rescue them amen he was interceding for them up on a hill up in the heavenly places up in the heavenly realm interceding but they had to come a time where he himself would come and he would rescue them Alleluia what would he do he would walk on the water other and he would call them come walk on the water take Dominion back take your Dominion back the devil may have been hounding you he may be pestering your oppressing you trying to possess you just you just address him hallelujah there is power in the name of Jesus to destroy any devil cast them off you know for nine months I struggled with a demon of unbelief when I first got saved and it was treacherous it was horrible a mile I was in a boat and it was rocking and rolling and so horrible and it was and I believe but I but this dis devil it just keep telling me God is not real God is not real God is not real I didn't understand spiritual warfare until one day I heard a prophet speak a man I heard a voice behind the voice in it and he said that you just cast it down anything that speaks to you that is not the word as the devil amen and you can cast that down take up your sword cast it down Amen you used the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah don't use your name don't use some name of some man but you use the name of Jesus no man that is the name hallelujah and you will be free but you have to take out your sword and cut them hallelujah and the devil is here to excite and the Lord is here to expose the devil amen he is here to expose the devil because he see the devil will do everything he can to make you fear because the sooners your fearing and scared and all of those emotions and cripples faith hallelujah but God is here to deliver when perfect love comes in and perfect love is walking these pews right now perfect lovers come to sit next to you make room for him hallelujah amen make room for perfect love he wants to sit and he's going to sit right next to you just invite them to your pew right now and vitamin hallelujah perfect love casts out all fear and when you when fear is gone you can believe Amen louia amen any country thought anything that comes to you any tumultuous sea that tries to raise up and cause you to sink in the water it's all it wants to do Peter he started walking now Peter the leader of the first church and then the first church age was headed other than this man that was given the keys to the kingdom amen but you see the very picture you see here of Peter stepping out coming the church the first church they came into that position and they tasted of it they tasted on that Dominion for a short time hallelujah but it wasn't their season it wasn't their season to eat the open book and live forever it wasn't their season it wasn't God's program for a rapture in that hour so you see Peter starts walking on the water and it's and in all the trouble starts and the trouble started in the first church very bad all little deeds of the Nicolaitans come in the sea started raging while the church was walking on the water starting to come into that position that Adam lost and then it got too much and they started looking at the circumstances and the church started to sink down because Peter was living at a time of what that church would do that church would have to go down into the ground and that seed would have to go down underground and God would have a witness for 900 years underground of a church that was hidden away that God would preserve a man so that one day after two thousand years of all through these trials and we don't understand always the trials that we're going through we don't understand why these things happen we don't understand sometimes we do and sometimes we don't sometimes God doesn't tell us you know why we're going through all those things and sometimes you know these things in our life they're you know they're just so troublesome to us and and we wonder why am I not being delivered of this thing why are these enemy stained they will be delivered amen you just keep seeking the Lord he will deliver those enemies and it's perfect timing just reach out and lay hold of your inheritance amen those the enemies have got no power over you they are shaking because they know their time is coming amen they know it's time right now in the restitution of all things the enemy's kingdom is shaking hell annoying because there is a king walking on the water a man he's walking on the water and he's calling people up into their positions he's calling you that's why I wrote that song you know he is calling me and to heaven through a mighty voice amen he's calling me to lean on his chest how do you lean on his chest you have to be caught up amen hallelujah he's calling us into that hallelujah we're not just called to try and just get by a man we're not just called to just fear out the season or no we're cool to walk on the water we're called to dominion over all of it and all these trials and things that ghosts are in the church went through every church they wouldn't have fully understood why why are we just all dying but there was an anointing there to help them it was an anointing they were anointed to sacrifice they were anointed as martyrs they were anointed as smart men in the age of man but they finally came a time for the Eagles a man where a prophet would come with eagle vision to see a man to see beyond and bring on the full mind of Christ to the people so that you could see it so that you could realize who you are amen but you see all these trials and things they're all for a purpose because God was going to restore all things he was going to bring restitution he was going to restore the female image he was going to restore his perfect woman amen and through all of it and as a human would never understand hallelujah and God will never understand all the way that God understands it all the trials and everything that goes on in the church and all the things that's happened over the last 2,000 years that's because God is rebuilding a woman and you see all the trials that happen in your life you also go through seven church changes in your life there is also seven Church ages there's also a process that God takes you through he takes you through a time of full everything's just so amazing and there's power and glory and the prayers are always answered and and then the faith rises up and then he takes you through a time now of death he takes you through a time where you have to die to yourself and you start failing and things start going wrong all the time because these season he's bringing out something in you he's bringing out a nature in you because it says that he we would be conformed to the image of a son that we would be molded and shaped that every son that cometh to God must go through these things so consider it not strange that you go through the fiery trials hello Louie they're all for a reason you go through these things for a reason because these things inside you that need to come out and they will come out when they need to come out and God will bring them out he is the campaign manager a man he is leading the campaign he has got it all he's got the whole view we just sometimes need a punch the screen of our life right up to see if he lets you amen and prayer the Prophet said then you know there's times in prayer where you get a Holy Ghost lifting obviously what we need what we need is a Holy Ghost lifting up that's a personal experience with a God where he lifts you up out of this flesh and out of your thoughts and you start to see things in a bigger picture hallelujah he starts to show you and you and it's not so much as information coming at you it's just a perspective and you start to see there is a divine plan never ever ever give up never give up hallelujah there is a purpose why things happen hello yeah amen and all of the things each as each enemy comes up you know we all want I mean I know from I'm speaking for myself but I'm sure he runs the same we all want if we're honest professor we all want God to deliver all of those enemies into our hands right all the enemies that are squatting in the land of our life that you know it's coming Satan you got your expiry date you know he's coming and they're shaking because David's on the loose amen hallelujah do you just crown him King you know we're net when Israel anointed David King when they made him King they came together yes let everything in your life and noisome king let everything in your life don't hold anything back hallelujah when you come to that place where there's no reservation and you hold nothing back ooh and David becomes king then all those enemies have an expiry date those enemies are finished hallelujah amen they know they're finished they know they're already done and all that they are as a bluff and then and you think they may bring you joy or they may bring you this or that they bring you nothing it's just a bluff it's a lie it's all a lie and it's all these seas what are they trying to do trying to make you sit down in the elements the elements of the water you see water it's not me to be walked on it's not meant to be walked on and this world is not me to be escaped this world is not designed for people to escape hallelujah amen I feel real good right hallelujah amen this world is not designed for people to get out of it it's a it's a cage of unclean spirits and hateful birds and everywhere I look darkness was my light there's no Sun anymore for the earth for the world it's gone it's black there's nothing left it's all darkness groans darkness on the people completely gone there's no way out but God Richard mercy amen he would come walking on the water himself hallelujah with an open book and he would preach a message through a prophet to you amen he would give you the divine inheritance that Adam lost and if you eat then you'd live forever because inside there is your name and your identity and the sustenance for you to walk on the water baby when you listens to those tapes and you have that in mind it'll change everything change the perspective that an angel came from the presence of God to bring a refreshing to reconstitute your life was the moisture of the Holy Ghost to take a barren wilderness that you were or maybe still a and make it a river of living water that would spring forth amen and it would restore the garden of your heart from a tumultuous war-torn Jerusalem into a beautiful millennial condition and to a Garden of Eden again and that's what is coming to creator says I behold I create an Eden within you it's not your work or our works or us getting seven steps to freedom or anything like that it's the power of God amen that's the inheritance that was read out to you if you just step out of the ship tonight and walk on the water come up to him hallelujah you come up to him and say give me that book Lord give me my inheritance because as I eat this Amen I'm gonna walk on the water I'm gonna walk with him and talk with him about me hallelujah I don't know where I am and I Louie well praise God amen hallelujah the only way what was his face shining like when he came with a book amen shining like the Sun that's the only sunlight that's in this world and it's directly to the Bride of Christ it's directly to those that would come out amen come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins come out and fellowship with the king step out of the boat and walk on the water walk on the water it's not designed to walk on but you can walk on it but with God all things are possible hey man he's calling come out of her my people Alleluia come out of man's ideas come out of New Zealand traditions come out of all national spirits then you see a national spirit manifesting in your life just lay before the Lord he will deliver you Amen Alleluia there are things as the children grow up as well you'll find that that that traits that you see in your parents start to come out and you that they've already overcome because they've got the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost you need the Spirit of God to come into your life to give you the overcoming power to overcome those traits you can't escape them without it remember this is not designed for you to escape but this one has given you an opportunity to escape hallelujah the darkness of this earth there is one whose face is shining like the Sun alleluia am I gonna read there let me just carry on I'll read the scriptures so it says here man we didn't even get to the story and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him and to the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the ship wind was country remember that the wind was contrary it's always going to be contrary everything that you try and do and anything the Lord calls you to do there's always going to be contrary winds to try and strike you you never give up you just be sure of the vision that he gives you be sure there hey men that's why you know Peter said give all diligence not some not 99% 100% of your diligence before anything before your hobby's before your education before your life before your will before your plans before your flesh before your family give all diligence to make your calling and election sure hallelujah amen it's so important amen that's God's vision for your life that's his perfect will these things becoming you won't get everything maybe all at once but he will start and he'll just start to reveal things to you it start to lead your life amen and the faith will come up set your wings you know the winds of faith will rise but underneath you as you find the vision as God reveals things to you for your life under that revelation as the winds of faith and you just spread honestly it's not I've got to do this to try try try struggle struggle no let's just set your wings because the winds of faith will take you on the journey of the Holy Ghost you'll rise up on that current hey man find that you know you've got to just kind of you gotta wait on the Lord amen now here the wind was country Matthew 14 25 and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled and that's quite normal you know it was a bit different from what they were used to a man it was different from their denominational thinking from their Pharisaic thinking what they had been taught all their life in their churches what the School of Theology had taught them it was different this was something different this was a man they had dominion over all nature they didn't get taught that in their theology school they didn't get taught that by their priests so it was different they were troubled and it's the same when the mighty angel himself of the open book was walking now and people come into the church and they hear these things yes their spirit they start to get a bit trouble that's so different he says be not afraid it is me and you will see the characteristic of God with ya and the same God that calls us to walk on the water there will be fruit and a vindication of that walking on the water man hello yeah and I'll talk about that in a minute I'll share some vindication a man [Music] walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled now these were elect you know even the elect can be a bit troubled at first hey it might be so different but yet something in their heart is saying yes I see it something more hallelujah there's just so much truth inside this that's so real hello yeah that's wind you have to just go Lord I just lay everything down lay it all down don't don't wrestle with the scriptures and I Louie you let him Andalou you see that the prophecies it will speak for itself there is a life contained in it it's the seed of the word you don't have to try and make a seed grow just give it the atmosphere Alleluia you take the seed of the word that you're hearing right now yes go back to your room and will he and here in the atmosphere and let it do a minute it's a life hallelujah disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it as a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus speak Amen the voice behind the voice amen oh my I want to jump amen unto them saying be of good cheer desire be not afraid and now I'm gonna drop down on her and Peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus see he do you realize what happened this is a man you know there was a hope that was scared yeah he was afraid he didn't quite understand what was happening yeah and then all of a sudden something changed amen hallelujah and he started walking on the water and I encourage you even if you're afraid tonight even if you're scared you're unsure maybe just step out hey Ben walk on the water because he is here amen he's calling you to walk on the water he's calling you above sin he's calling you above death he's calling you to live forever he's calling you to dominion over all these things because he's restoring you to the true image of a woman church woman a spiritual woman amen and you sisters he you know he's restoring your true image as well amen but as a church he's restoring us as a people to walk like it was before Amen who wants to walk like that miles before a fall amen it's your inheritance amen the devil will always tell you you don't have enough faith he will always tell you you can't just have that because you don't have faith you have faith it's given to you but 2xs like I said the ones of faith don't try all I've got to get healings and all this little stuff yes that's fine that's the children's bread but find God's purpose for your life you find God's purpose for your life before you try and get miracles in your life and you want to you know to try and increase your face find God's purpose for your life lay everything down until you find his purpose and you have that perfect love in your life and you just make them get the basics all sorted a man get those things right get it all in line when it's all in line then set your wings faith that like you've never seen before will rise you up and anything nothing will stand before your prayer when you're walking in the will of the Lord not even a sea can stand in your way not even a river even if it's flooded it will part when you walk through because you're under the winds of faith and you're walking and you're flying amen this is an age of flight hallelujah the anointing you have received Alleluia but you got to click into that channel and then it's not just the willy-nilly thing that you just kind of are again here at Christian there is no such thing as a generic Christian amen the Bride of Christ all has a perfect plan and God's mind just find that all the troubles and all of that will become easy well they'll be still have some hard times but you know when you're under the winds amen you'll brother brand and see your crest every way hallelujah amen glory to God praise the Lord and he come and but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto Him o thou of little faith wherefore did us thou Jesus kept the church even though it went down down down and it became a spindly stump the the bride tree you know got beaten down by the locusts and the caterpillars and the cankerworm 's and the parlor worms and all the worms and the devil come to eat the church down and all others went down to a stop but as it but but as it got down there the church cried out save me Lord and he pulled them up and he pulled up Luther out of the Catholic Church a man he pulled him up and said the just shall live by faith you don't have to serve that beast anymore you have to serve that Roman tyranny anymore hallelujah but it wasn't finished he kept pulling him up keep pulling him up keep pulling him up hallelujah amen he pulled out right up until you're walking on the water with him again hey man he pulled it out through Wesley brought back their holiness brought it up through the Pentecostal move and brought back the gifts of the Spirit still not finished then he come walking on the water himself amen let me read them hallelujah 2 Timothy 3:1 just before we go into my sieze here this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come are we in the last days as their perilous times as the seas boisterous as the world going into complete chaos homosexuality and its rampant forms become a normal thing to the point where if you don't think that way you're weird so we're considered oddballs for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away revelation 10 verse 1 this is the this is now this is going to describe the our visitation of our God who has come himself because Jesus Christ was sent himself at the end to come and see him all the school to come and claim everything he purchased he would come Alleluia and I read that right at the start Ephesians 5 says that he might present her to himself God the all-knowing all-powerful would come down into time again and he would walk in time hallelujah spiritually no no not the physical body not the Corporal coming I'm talking about the fullness of Christ manifested amen and spiritual form in Word form and then in the form of the angel of the Lord and they're speaking through the mouth of a redeemed son through a prophet he says you see that's how visitation that's our inheritance that he is holding revelation 10 verse 1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire aren't you so glad that when all the smoke came out of hell all over the earth and it blocked out the Sun there was a provision made for you there's a provision made for you a space shining like the Sun and he says just come and behold my face he wants to have fellowship with you he wants to restore the song in your life give everything else give it up lay it all down and if you want joy lay it down if you want peace tonight lay it down lay all the things down that you know that you can lay down hallelujah don't get all caught up that you don't know oh I don't know what to lay down I don't know this just lay what you know what's in your conscious mind surrender it if you want peace if you want joy if you want rest if you want to be sure of God be certain of God do you lay everything down until he comes on the scene of your life and you know that you've gone beyond the veil Amen you've come into a place where the glories never fail and the word never goes fail Amen hallelujah and you start to see your life start to restore back like Aaron's rod when he went in when he started walking on the waters hallelujah sorry the rod doesn't walk on the water but I'm thinking of a person now walking on the waters the multitudes tongues and Nations and all those things you know waters and the Bible was multitude tongues and nations and just that we're the Catholic Church came out and we're the Gentile empires of all that stuff you just walk over all that stuff walk over the religions walk over all this theologies and walk over everything and you just go beyond the veil lay it all down hallelujah let that altar of incense it's just before the Holy of Holies let your whole life be poured on that did everything go let it all be poured on that and a supernatural God you will walk into his presence Amen because the vales rent there's nothing to stop you nothing the Devils by he's got no power he can't stop you walking and he can't stop you escaping the unescapable world he can't stop you because there is a God the God of heaven the one who knew that this perilous sea would come and it would be gross darkness and there'll be no light left in the churches no light lifting denominations no light anywhere but in Christ alone and he himself would have to come in the end time with his face shining like this so that all the light of every age and all the theology that was true it would all come together and it would be concentrated into a message and that message would be preached to you and you would catch that and you would recognize your day and you would see there is a God of heaven whose Bible days again and has he's come to walk on the water and cause you to come into a Holy of Holies amen and you would be no man no much more than a stick shaped by man when you started out hallelujah been fashioned by man's ideas used by men whatever has been going on in your life there's nothing when you hop into their Shekinah glory it doesn't have any effect anymore all of those prison chains kids are broken by the power of his blood and they were broken at Calvary all of it's broken you are absolutely free tonight free to walk into that place you made the old dry old stick that has no resemblance of a son or a daughter right now but you can't walk you can go beyond the veil tonight you can go beyond the veil right now hallelujah right now and all the joy that you've ever wanted all the nice piece that you've ever wanted will be yours all that security your identity everything that you really want all that you'll ever need as in there just lay everything down what does it worth to you what does it worth nothing the devil's lying he's a liar and he's the father of lies it's all a bluff oh my no matter water does matter how hard it is he's caught us to walk on the water amen we're just about finished and he cried with a loud voice oh no and he had in his hand a little book open and he said in his right foot upon the earth and his left foot upon a sea and a right left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he cried seven thunders uttered their voices amen and we know that that's the voice of God that comes from heaven and speaks down into the earth and what does it do it shakes the heavens and the earth so that all that's shakable anything that's temporal in your life let it fall let it crumble let it fall away the voice is here it's here to crumble all those things away so you can walk into the Holy of Holies they may let their voice just recognize it say Lord let me go beyond the veil let me hear beyond the veil let me hear their voice that speaks behind the voice let me hear that because I want supernatural I want the vision in my life I want what the preachers talking about hallelujah that's all that you need and it's so simple it's not some complicated thing it's not too far away from you it's yours now take it walk into it amen and you see that rod then you think that you are that may be shaped up like a dry old stick that's been hid around or become a fruitful tree will turn back to its original form it will be root will receive restitution it will be reconstituted amen because God has sent Jesus Christ amen and the time of refreshing of all things that is everything that Adam loves all the inheritance I just rebuilt the true man and rebuilt the true woman so that they can sing a song hallelujah like deeper in Bharat they sung a song they had a victory amen like in the time of the book of Revelation we made the lamb opened at all and they just rejoiced John had the whole heaven in the whole earth and under the earth listening to the testimony that he overcame a man our God has overcome hallelujah I'll share a couple of testimonies I was up in Taranaki and you know I'm I run most of you know my past and it's not pretty so there's a lot of things that the Lord has to do in my life you know that he's been doing and is still doing - and the I'm talking subtle things that you wouldn't know until he shows you subtle things and these subtle things start to come out and then I start failing in certain areas and you know it shows itself and I pray O God and I get down and I say Lord what's going on what's happening how does this happen and where is its root closed where is it found Lord and in His mercy and his love because I am in the Shekinah because I'm in the I just you know you when you're in there he's the healer hallelujah he's the deliverer hallelujah it's not it's just a process that he takes you through and I said Lord what is this and then then I start failing more in a certain area and and I knew it's this thing this complex or this this deep like it's like a wound of some sort and so I'm up at Taranaki now and brother Craig is preaching and then after the service there's a prayer and every time a preacher calls all these people come in for prayer always search my life and I always say Lord is there anything in me that you want me to go pray for is there anything and I just wait on the Lord and if he says go I'll go and that then sometimes he says go and I still don't want to go and I'm like oh man I just I don't know that's just a battle anyway so I'm down the back of the church and I'm suddenly and I'm saying Lord what is this thing what is it and I said Lord if you tell me what this problem is where its root causes I will God for prayer and anyway I'm like praying and there's people going up for prayer and and then he just says fear of rejection Wow okay well here I am I'm going up and then I think I can't remember exactly but I kind of put her off again and then something else happened and then I went up I went out right at the end and He healed me hey man hallelujah because he's calling us to walk on water and any little thing that hinders that channel hinders that faith or hinders that expression of him he will deliver he will move he will take it all apart he will remove it so that you can be restored amen you know we have a supernatural God that's calling us to walk on water amen hallelujah I told you guys the story of Rebecca and the rain even the little ones wherever she is they're catching it they've got faith because God is calling us all to walk on the water he's calling our children Alleluia what are you teaching them hallelujah you know these things are so real and the children are catching it so Rebecca prays and you know there's forecast storms and rain Thanksgiving we've got a lot to be thankful for amen because God is restoring the spoken word back into his people hallelujah and so Rebecca prays and it starting this and it becomes sunny for three days for five days I don't know it was sunny for a long time and we played out and we've done all the things amen you see because she sees the next day man the Lord the whole city is benefiting from my prayer because we pray I prayed and God took away all the rain and now the whole region is all red all happy because I prayed and I said praise the Lord amen even the children are catching it even the children are walking on the water amen Alleluia amen just today is another testimony a really cool testimony so Rebecca got bitten by a whitetail spider must have been a pretty big one and she had the two holes in her leg she didn't feel a thing so brahmand prayed just said that there'll be no poison and there was nothing so no poison but it was a differently a whitetail spider and bigger didn't even no problem didn't even tell Ruby her at all and then so we I'm sitting out preparing on my dick and beaker comes out sits on my knee and she starts telling me about brother Branham she has a story about a whitetail spider and a bite and how he prayed and the poison was reversed and she's telling me if a some Brahmin walks out at the same time it says what did you just say and so biggest telling me the story of a whitetail spider doesn't even know she's been bitten by one brahmin knew she walks and she goes Rebecca that's significant that's very significant because did you know that you've got bitten by a whitetail spider today and Rebecca's testifying about what God did for her said she didn't even realize it CUC we are being called to walk on the water to walk above all of the steers of this world all of the troubles and tumultuous eats we're being called above all our children are being called above don't limit them let them catch it hello Louie you're not too young amen you walk on the water children whoo children here wanna walk on the water does all the young children want to walk on the water amen hallelujah you can walk on the water too Samuel was what five seven nine I don't know he was young he was a young boy he walked on the water amen hallelujah God caught him up about all of those things and that was before the Tommen how much more can a young child walk on the water right now hallelujah don't put your salvation don't put your experience off till you're older you take it now take it now young children hallelujah even if you're four three you take it three years are probably sleeping good Alleluia amen take it let us take it let us take out heritance he's calling you come out of the ship yes come out of all your old thinking now come out of all your troubles all your fears all of the tumultuous sea and you look at him and walk hallelujah amen the other night we were praying and if we started the prayer meeting at my place at about 1:30 in the morning actually and it was just going to be a little you know like an end of end of night tired prayer that we kind of thought we may fall asleep in and it ended up turning into hours of rejoicing and singing and and and a friend of ours you know like there was words spoken in the spirit of one of the sisters getting healed of a real big issue and so you see when God comes everything changes they meant everything changes hallelujah so you see these are the fruits that are happening in our lives hallelujah who remembers the prayer meeting when we were praying up a pooka obeying there was some people lots of people healed in the meeting you know when we had that prayer meeting and God came down on those words the blood still Christ freedom remember that who remembers that the blood still Christ freedom in it just there was healings taking place deep feelings because God's calling us to walk on the water he's calling us above all these things and all all he requires as your alabaster box your life can I have the musicians please Hosea 6 5 therefore have I hewed then by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and though judgments are as the light that goth forth revelation 10 7 were just I'm just speaking how this how the Lord expresses himself how he's calling you out of the ship this is how he does it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished what I've spoken to you of now all the love and the relationship the union the union all of those things these were mysteries that were hidden in the scriptures they've only been revealed as Christ the mystery of God has been revealed in this hour how did he do it through the mouth of mouthpiece of God a major prophet one of the greatest ministries to ever strike the earth ever strike the earth Jesus did more miracles in his ministry and and and Jesus manifested more miracles in this endtime ministry than he did in his own ministry the greatest ministry to ever hit the earth but the greatest miracles ever recorded under any circumstance of equal nature to pour are to Joshua's stopping the eternities stopping the heavens and stopping the Moon in the Sun great things have taken place the Lord says shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord had not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth the secret unto his servants the prophets the lion has wrought remember revelation 10 as the winner lion roars and seven thunders uttered they're boys who will not fear the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy and in here to just balance it out Ephesians 4 verse 11 and he gave some prophets apostles and some prophets sorry and he gave them some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors Vincent teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till till we all there see it's hid prophets are to come this is not something that is just in the past but there is prophetic ministry it had to happen in the end time until we all come to the unity of the faith and to come
