this year when I first Christ Church had a Kemp with further baby from Canada I was praying that because I didn't know my exam timetable the end but I was just praying that I would be able to attend a camp this year and when the exam timetable out came out I was really grateful that my last exam was the day of the camp so I had my last exam on the morning of the camp and then we traveled but the Vlahakis family um all the way to christchurch and it was just a blessing because I really needed that time to grow my relationship with the Lord and have a greater desire for him and I'm grateful that the Lord wanted me that and I just realized at first I was questioning a lot about my future and had a bit of anxiety just wondering what my life will be heading into but I'm so grateful that I could offer everything to him and my life just knowing that I can trust in him and just give him everything I have so we're gonna sing a special and called Lord I offer my life thank you [Applause]

great to have you here I mean who's happy to be a Christian today hallelujah amen let's just go to second Corinthians chapter 6 that means great - amen great to be here C Corinthians six and four then we're going to go to Isaiah 55 actually sorry can you actually I have this on the slideshow I've got a slideshow well partial one today so he just put that up I guess I could drive it from here there we go seeking Corinthians six and four and read down to verse 10 he says but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God and much patience and afflictions in necessities and de-stresses and stripes and imprisonments and in tumults and Labor's and watchings and fastings by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing all things let me just say all things all things are mine I mean let's go to our the Book of Isaiah chapter 55 and we're gonna read from verse 8 here I've only got to verse 11 but we're going to go down to verse 13 so as I have 55 and in 8 I mean say I mean when you are there he says for my my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord I mean change our thoughts are your thoughts Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not hither but watereth the earth and make it bring forth bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word that goes out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing whereto i seated for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the leaves of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the Brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that cell shall not be cut off I mean this is bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father truly it's our hearts desires that you draw us close to you Lord that Lord we would be under the shadow of your wings dear god I just pray father you bring us so close Lord to your left hand side would feel your heartbeat lon father Lord that your Lord we thank you for your word which is a love leader and I just pray father it may your Holy Spirit just brood upon each heart here dear God may you move upon us my lord may you anoint your word to our hearts dear God we have not come here just to fulfill the religious duty Lord just to go through emotion Lord because of maybe it's a habit but Lord we've come here to meet with you so dear God I pray you'd come down among us my lord and do what you want to do father we are we are the clay you are the Potter some older slaw done to enter your image I pray father may you anoint speaker in here one more time Lord we are all together insufficient but you are the all sufficient ones so Lord may you come and take this service under your divine control father be with those who are not here be their portion father always and I ask father Lord you know the needs on every heart dear God may you meet those needs father may we walk out of here rejoicing and happy father may you grant it love renew our strength and you dear Lord Father in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen I mean God bless your friends you may have your seats this morning I don't know if I can I don't know if I can what do you call it block that out but I'd like to take a if I could take it title I've been listening to the service of the message brother been speaking about possessing all things I'd like to I'd like to speak about possessing all things today but I want to I really pray that you know by the end of the service that you'd have such confidence in the word of the Lord that nothing will move you from it one but that's it there's my heart's desire you have such rock-solid confidence nothing a movie doesn't matter what the world does what your family does even what you know what comes against you you'll just stand on that word hallelujah so now we know that when God's so God's word this may be very obvious but I just want it to sink in God's Word always produces exactly what he intended it to produce so exactly what he thought of and he spoke it it produced exactly that so so you take Genesis 1 when God is creating the heavens and the earth and he said let there be light and the word says there was light it wasn't anything it was light it wasn't slightly light or nearly light or something close to light it was exactly light so what God thought he spoke it and it produced it amen and then it says in Genesis 1 and 9 and God said let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so cuz he spoke it and it happened it means but you know we know with us you know we try and create something you know sometimes we you know maybe we're young or even old you say I want to to picture and so what's in your mind what you want to paint you know so you have it you can imagine something you want to paint some great landscape you maybe see it so vividly but very few people can actually paint what they see in their mind from from here to here something gets a bit lost you know you try and paint something maybe try and even write a song or or you tell a story but from here to here something gets lost it doesn't quite come out how you imagined it or how you thought it God is not that way exactly what he saw becomes material exactly what he speaks happens hallelujah because we know now God God has a you know so for example when God said Let there be pineapples a watermelon didn't appear and God and say well that's close enough so it'll be good enough now when God said let there be a pineapple bush a pineapple bush was formed you know let there be a coldie tree called a tree was formed whatever he said let there be it happened exactly that way it wasn't close enough good enough knows exactly because God's Word always produces exactly what he said it would produce I mean because God's Word we know has a perfect thought behind it now I want to I don't want to maybe I'm just going to jump to this colors can we can we have that back up now we're going to talk about you know there's many promises in the scripture there's prophecy of a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing I mean there's there's the Lambs wife the scripture talks about you know there's people who the death will be under their feet that they'll walk from this world to the next world that they'll possess all things where where Joshua told thee told the leaders of Israel that day when they capture as Kings put your put your feet on the neck of your enemies experience what it's like to have dominion over your foes after you've won the battle that's the same thing you know we got it we're going to put our feet on the neck of these five senses and we take this flesh subject to the Word of God because we know the greatest miracle Jesus ever did is he subjected his own flesh his own humanity to the Word of God that was for him holy that was that's why and Gethsemane he conquered because he said not my will but thy will be done he I've taken his own gym he knew what he had to go through he knew what he had to suffer he knew what he had to enjoy and as a man no one wants to die but he subjected his own human lifeless clay amen to the Word of God hallelujah so now there's many promises in the scripture and many times we say Amen but then it's win now we realize we're part of that promise and that's when some reluctance can back up is something I say oh I don't know about that Amen that's where I'm belief comes in I mean because I said it's gonna be a bride we say hallelujah she's going to take a rapture glory I mean she's gonna be gathered around the throne hallelujah I say you're part of it and sometimes it can be a little mingling here saying oh me yes you but you've got to come to the realization it's not your doing it's his doing holy and now this is an 18 what we'll go to it now this is this is the so this actually really happened there's a story of Charles Blondin and any city walks over Niagara Falls so who seen the Niagara Falls they're massive it's not some little trickle of a waterfall these things are massive there's an 1859 and so so because there's a lot of tight rope your people would do things and people watch it and before this woman got in the got in the wheelbarrow you know he was going back and forth everyone's cheering whoo isn't that wonderful and he says could I have a volunteer and everyone goes quiet because he's going along with the Wilbur oh that's amazing isn't that wonderful he says now I need someone to get in the wheelbarrow and people and and and and just silence then eventually someone said and apparently it was his manager his mother I don't know she got in the wheelbarrow and she said in the wheelbarrow and they crossed the Niagara Falls and there's no worry it's like the Word of God he has every divine promise hallelujah and and and we can go through all the scripture he fulfilled his promise to Moses amen to Abraham amen all the way down through promise promise fulfill fulfill fulfill and we see what if he's done it in the past you'll do it in the future but then he says to you he says you get in the word I'm going to take you across get in the wheelbarrow of the word I mean don't just sit there being a spectator get in the words Thalia sit in it Holly I'm gonna carry you across that's what you've got to do hallelujah but then there's a reluctance or can he do it we did it in the past you'll do it again God doesn't change he cannot change Sofie fulfilled his word amen to Moses or Elijah whoever it was he'll fulfill it to you holy be him gonna be willing and now what did she have to do did she have to do anything no she's had to sit in the wheelbarrow just be still sit in the promise and he will carry your cross away to the fulfillment of a promise that's all you have to do hallelujah don't be scared jump in oh but what if it doesn't work it'll work it'll work we can have a testimony service four months in this place and the conclusion would be it works and it will work then it works now to work in the future hallelujah listen her ability did not get them across it wasn't her doing it was him it was him carrying the wheelbarrow got across the same thing with us it's not us that's why the Lord says just rest and my promise just take me at my word don't try and struggle just surrender let him carry your cross hallelujah that's what you gotta do oh but I've made so many mistakes it didn't matter her condition she could have been crippled she could have had all kind of problems going on in her own life she's had to get in it's the same thing with us I've got this issue I've got this problem I got this question I got this complex just get in the word he'll carry you over I've got this struggle just get in get in the barrel and he'll carry you that's all you have to do hallelujah well this person in this person that person who cares I'm in the scripture says in Psalms 23 that he sits a table before me in the presence of my enemies he anointed my head with oil and my cup runneth over holy so therefore there's going to be a time our enemy has to be in our presence kaalia the devil comes against us we shouldn't worry about him if the Lord sees hit a table before me the principle enemy I'm going to feast on the word I'm gonna have a rejoicing time irrespective of who's here what spirits fighting me whatever is going on that's irrelevant I'm going to worship I'm going to rejoice I'm gonna have a wonderful time why because the Lord said the Lord said here's the banquet here's the table what do I have to do just sit and eat just sit and rejoice just enjoy it hallelujah you mean you can sit and feast and have a jubilee in the presence of the your enemy absolutely I mean because my feasting my worship my Walker's not based on my enemy it's based on him carrying me over hallelujah that's the only thing that matters I'm it doesn't matter what the critics on the bank was saying will they make it or he's not going to make it looking at me - no that's irrelevant he was the one that mattered to get her across it's the same thing with us howler in the Lord Jesus doesn't matter what the critics is doesn't matter what anyone else says he has promised me and His Word he's going to take me through I'm going through how there because he promised to me he's not a man that can lie he's going to take me all the way hallelujah just stay in the wheelbarrow of the word I trust us grips you whenever there's trouble just think of this picture hallelujah hallelujah now as I see it God's word as a thought behind it now he sees this is an works the word became flesh see and others from India oh sorry couple of promises husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish I say just get in that wheelbarrow get in that promise he wants you and that without spot blemish or any such thing so there's nothing that can be held against you it's been struck off by the blood hallelujah and I were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many waters as the voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are call into the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God well they said God has sent a message in this day too robust in his righteousness how he's got to put on the garment doesn't matter you know we were reading just as a family speaking about the parable of the wedding supper and the King sets out the invitation and and people made light of it he says just go into the highways the byways get the good and the bad just get anyone get anyone who will say yes it doesn't matter what their conditioning and you know just just get the good and the bed I'm glad that fits everyone doesn't matter if you think you're good you think you're bad invitations been said I'd say I just accept that invitation hallelujah and then the people came and we know in the in the Eastern tradition Middle Eastern tradition everyone came to one door and they were and their feet will wash our anointed kiss made welcome and a robe was put upon them so it doesn't matter if they are a beggar or a multi-billionaire when after they went through the door they all look the same hallelujah same thing coming through the word jesus' as the door how are you put on the wedding garment you put on the rope you go in so you swap your invitation for a for a wedding garment there's brother a bee was talking about hallelujah so and that's what we've done I just heard her this message this bridegroom call came out he says do you want to come something in me said oh oh come yes this is what I've been looking for my entire life hallelujah amen now he sees this and this is in the word became flesh he says now but a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily I say unto you ye shall say to this mountain be moved and plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say will come to pass you'll have whatever things you say is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church now you can have you can express it by mental conception so you can just think about it in your mind is a good idea you could agree with it mentally but he says but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in a word form the word takes a hold and becomes material I mean so so so when it's revealed to you that takes a hold and the word you here becomes material becomes manifested in your life I mean sure so if God's revealed you I'm saved I've been cleansed I've been sanctified holy what happens that becomes material it becomes a living reality in your life he reveals you you've got the Holy Ghost that's for you you say yes you accept it he comes and lives and yours word is manifested in your life what it becomes material it's not just something you talk about a nice idea it becomes a living reality amen I thought expressed oh how God see your heart and your mind is so filled with God's Spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh my what kind of people should we be if they're very holy spirit has you so embodied so empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being as God's Spirit expressing itself right through you what kind of church would we be hallelujah get in the wheelbarrow get in the promise because if the Prophet seated about the bride I say amen that's going to become someone's got to receive the revelation more than a mental conception and it's got to become material in them that our mind our motives our objectives everything our is the word hallelujah amen I think that's it yes we're getting sorry that's all I have but now we read in Isaiah 55 that is word so shall my word that Garth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper and the thing whereto I sent it now this word void in the Hebrew the root word of it means empty or worthless so his word shall not return to him empty it shall not return to him worthless I mean it will not return to them in that form but it shall prosper it's but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing whereto I sent it now that's what prosper means to push forward hallelujah so it's not just gonna sit still it's not just gonna be dormant it's not just gonna become a status quo it's gonna push it's gonna it's gonna grow it's gonna manifest itself so his word is not gonna just be idle it's not gonna be empty but it's gonna what he spoke like I said let there be a pineapple bush it didn't return to Him void there's a pineapple bush or Sun Moon and stars they were there so every every word of God now because it has God's thought behind it it will produce what God has ordained to produce so now we're looking now in the scripture we speak of this day we're where we have come to an adoption age where people are positionally placed in Christ where you know we're no longer just you know just fighting the year you know but God actually you know we come into the promised land we come into the Holy Ghost and God places us in the body amen and we you know so when it speaks in in Galatians 4 about the adoption of sons it says here come a time but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father run to you be no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ so God had in his mind that this would happen this wasn't just the Apostle Paul writing something to make the Galatians feel happy but God wasn't ending now this is the season you're living and where you no longer be a servant under the law I mean but you would receive your placing because that word adoption adoption and the Greek means the placing son hallelujah so it's not getting someone who's not part of the family then then writing some paperwork and then they become family that's not the adoption no it's the placing of a son where someone who's born into the family comes to a time where where they are mature with their mind is the same as God's mind or the father's mind and then now the father says I'm going to place you in a position of authority I mean that what you say is what as if the same as well if I would be saying it cuz we have the same mind hallelujah so now we are living in a time where where where we would receive the adoption of sons now we know this message is an adoption message I mean where people would would come into the body of Christ by one spirit we're baptized into one body and there be you know there be those who are the fivefold ministry that helps the governments the musicians here every the Sunday School teachers every joint suppliers so people so God would move you into your allotted position in in Christ whatever that is God will move it to you and you'll find yourself naturally doing that I mean cuz that's just how you you know no matter what you feel you should be doing though the Spirit of God you'll find yourself naturally manifesting your part where you mean to be now if God said that they're mean adoption of sons this will not return on to avoid I mean it will not just be an empty promise that has never fulfilled it'll never be something that just lingers and then we wait and we wait and we wait for the promise to be fulfilled but in God's season it will happen I mean and his and it will prosper and what he sent it to accomplish I mean so will prosper it will move forward it will it will become a reality and it's the same you know it's exactly what's happening you know in this day and age I mean we are not a people that just rise to a certain level and and then and then the devil says you can't go no more where you just plateau that is not the brides portion I mean when he said that there are people that are filled with the fullness of Christ I mean when you would receive the fullness of your inheritance I mean there's no devil there's nothing that can stop the bride possessing all promises hallelujah because if God purposed your going to be filled with the fullness of me Holly you're gonna be placed to the body of Christ you're not going to be a servant no more you're going to be a son amen and it's not by the new birth you become a son but you always were son or daughter of God remember the reason you receive the Holy Ghost is because you are a son and daughter of God the reason there's a pull on your heart is because you are a sadder daughter of God however you just got to respond to that pole it doesn't matter if you're good you're bad whatever you've been that doesn't matter if God's called you I'd say here I come polar if he said get in the wheelbarrow of my word I sound stepping in Pali and you'll take me all the way hallelujah so we are living in a season where God's people are going to be fully manifested holy we're not waiting for a future we're not waiting for another word to come I mean this messages come the Prophet said that the shot is the message he's just declaring the messages the sharp hallelujah Amen so if the shots come we don't need an eighth messenger we don't need time to come and break down the word to us know the Holy Spirit will teach us holla he will guide us into all truth only because we have to recognize that this walk is not God a man and us this is us and God walking together I mean that is the purpose hallelujah that God would what did brother Bram say in the end of the church age book my one desire is that God and man would have a true spiritual relationship hallelujah and that is that that is the thrust of this church that man and God that you and God would have a true spiritual relationship that is not your man in God it's you and God walking hallelujah will it show this fivefold ministry and those things but it's you and God I mean when brother Brian speaks in Christ the mystery of God revealed and he says that your pastors ordained to see you through what's he talking about there he won't leave you the devil won't leave you as a nice happy group you're all happy now but the devil will bring someone and shoot them with a bunch of poison spread it through try and scary faces stay with your pastors ordained to see you through ordained to see you through what the devil coming in trying to scare you that's what he's talking about because the thing is if people hold on to a ministry too much what happens with their ministry dies then where do they go that's what happened what the Prophet people all brother brand will do bro and we'll do a brother and we'll do it but they had to come a time just like John the Baptist I must decrease he must increase so the word must come to its preeminence Christ Himself must come preeminence among the people what he said in the seventh seal message I'm just building a platform for that great one to come and a bunch of religious spirits get in and they say well I'm the one that build a platform for but no he says I'm building a platform for who the word himself to come among the people palliate Jesus Christ Himself to unite himself with you that's the platform he built hallelujah so if that's the case though you know with but but they know that all brother Barron brother brand will do this because I caught up with the messenger and they didn't catch the message of what he's saying and then when the Prophet was taken off the scene Yvonne's in shock how he'll raise again he'll come back yeah he's going to come back at the resurrection the dead in christ arise he'll be there he's coming back or not to minister some more work oh he'll explain it no the Holy Ghost was here to make a place I mean but the same one that gave the same anointing that gave the word has to come in you and then you understand he will teach you what it means so now he's shocked yo now we're shocked what's happened the prophets got off the scene what's going to happen what they were caught up with the man and not with the message but now we're not caught up with the man no more just like brother cadre said at the camp we don't worship William Brennan we worship Jesus Christ and I'm so glad the place erupted with the name in father because it's the only thing I'm not caught up in a man I'm caught up with the word Jesus Christ himself he's the one I'm following hallelujah amen so now so now who's came because ultimately you know no man can save another I mean no man can save another I can't give your rapture I can't give you eternal life like God can sure God can use an instrument sure he can he uses the body to give them party to life at me and my humanity I can't do it I can't take your sin away my humanity I can't give your rapture as much I'd love to just take us all let's go done hallelujah but of my humanity I can't do it he's the one he's the one this messages Jesus Christ hallelujah and so now he is here to ensure we receive placing as a son or daughter of God hallelujah so we'll not so this promise we'll return to him with thee what the purpose that it was sent to do hallelujah and that's why now we have come to a time where as I said we're not here to Plateau holier where the devil that's held back all the Deveaux the devil tries to ward off every divine promise just like when Jesus spoke to his disciples the us but who do they who do you say that I am and Peter had the revelation now at the crisis so a Living God he said blessed art thou simon barjona flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now we know a gate tries to stop access writer started attacking weapon it's a defensive weapon so the gates of hell so so there are gates of hell that have been set up to try and ward you from every divine promise because the devil doesn't want you to receive what Jesus wants to give you hallelujah so he fights that he fights you every day that you will not gain ground you will not receive what God has but remember God's Word won't return to invoice I mean it will accomplish that which he purposed that the duel will prosper in that holiest of God has ordained two people now I'm just going to probably jump down a bit but you know when god when i say that god's word word return to avoid it's more than just promises just like a promise all by your stripes you know by His stripes you're healed but when God sends a word he has a thought behind it of a people that will manifest their promise right so when he said is going to be a bride he thought of you his wife and the Lambs wife when with when John was inspired to write that down revelations 19 I mean God's thought behind that was you hallelujah his wife has made herself ready he thought about you I mean what was the joy the joy set before him the Lord Jesus when he went up Calvary it wasn't just the you know just some kind of random oh there's gonna be a bride know if he knew exactly who was going to be there he knew exactly the joy was you he following me so was just some abstract idea of having a wife know he knew exactly who it was hallelujah so so now if his word will accomplish that which he said to do he says now there's going to be a bride he thought of you Amen so now it's a person people are tied to the promise hallelujah so now when when we know Abraham was was told by God that you know his seed will sojourn in a strange land but they will return to this place they will they will inhabit this land when God promised that to Abraham he had Joshua and Caleb in mind he had that generation in mind when he gave that promise to promise to Abraham now we have received now it's so amazing when you think about it when God poured his spirit out upon upon the people even not just not just over there Pentecost but the same spirits being poured out through seven Church ages now it's being poured out without measure and that is an evidence of every divine promise hallelujah so it's the evidence of eternal life I mean it's the evidence of healing it's evidence of joy everything that's in God God pouring a spirit out upon us is the evidence that the promise is there hallelujah when God gives a promise is not just some so something we can never receive but God pours a spirit out I mean that will say yes it's there and it's mine hallelujah so it's just like Joshua and Caleb when they went over with the other spies and they brought back grapes you know and they brought back yeah yeah that big thing it grapes from the promised land that that the others never saw but he show but but they showed them here here is direct evidence of this land that's being promised now you just think about it you know you're there in camp these twelve spies go out all you've heard about is stories of a promised land you know it's there because you've heard about it you've never seen it but you've heard about it then finally two men come back packing this big massive bunch of grapes and then you're the one of those privileged ones I say can I have one you've never had a great before that I mean I mean apart from being in Egypt but I mean in the in the wilderness they had no grapes they just had the manner and things could I have one and you pluck it off you put it in your mouth and if the flavor explosion happens what you've just become one with the promise of the land you become one with the evidence so now it's not just something you've heard about you've actually received a down payment you've actually received evidence that the land is there hallelujah and it's the same thing today when God pours out his Holy Spirit I mean it is a direct evidence I mean there is an eternity I mean there is a new body hallelujah I mean just like your healing healing is just a proof that there's a new body to go to hallelujah now brother has seized and possessing all things now forgive me that this is but lengthy but just bear with me he says it's just like Joshua and Caleb brought back the evidence of an unseen land that had been given to a people by a promise Joshua and Caleb brought back in evidence that there was such a land now down here they had a promise of it God gave them the promise and they went right back to the land but they never seen it and Joshua and Caleb went over into the promised land and brought back the evidence that the land was there and it was a good place flowing with milk and honey amen what was it that word they were going to possess that land they had the promise they was on the road over there and they were almost to the Jordan and Joshua crossed over and brought back the evidence that it was a good land just what Joshua did for the children of Israel Joshua means Savior hope your savior that's the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him they he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he rose up again with the evidence the baptism of the Holy Ghost that deal was a land beyond the river that they call the sweet for ever amen he come back and brought us in evidence what does it do brother bear him and makes you stop lying stealing drinking cursing of morals everything that makes a new creature out of you by who or once did and sins and trespasses nevertheless I live but not me but Christ lives in me I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus a min ear of the promise hallelujah yes sir that land belongs to us how do you know it Joshua rose from the dead brought back in evidence the Holy Ghost I got it amen shook glory I'm an ear our child of the King a child the king ear of all things the Bible said so the same God the same God that gave Israel a promise of that promised land it was an unseen thing to them that same Bible that same God gave us a promise of eternal life and the Holy Ghost bears record of it Christ is alive not dead he lives right among us lives in us through us works around us amen he says now he says it was him sitting on the bench down there the other day when Satan seen a chance to kill me that's when the gun blew up in his face but he couldn't do it amen he'll never do it until Christ says it's ready amen no matter how many times he comes he'll go back empty handed until Christ gives an order I mean we know the devil can't take our lives until God has finished with us upon the earth so as long as we have life in our bodies we have a purpose we have a purpose for his kingdom there's a reason we're alive I mean don't just think you're filling up space filling up time you have a purpose for God's kingdom I mean you're valuable in his hand he needs you here I mean to work through it doesn't matter what part of the body you are you are important to God's program never ever forget that because the devil says you you're worthless you're not important you don't matter you're important I mean you're very important to God hallelujah amen it's God's word that promised it and we believe it because we're here I'm an air of divine healing I'm an air of joy got a right to be happy so what makes you happy I've got a right to be how do you know because I'm a near to it Amen all I know I feel religious yes I'm a near to the happiness I'm a near to joy I'm a near to peace I'm a near to eternal life I'm a near to the Holy Spirit amen I'm a near to every evidence of Scott I mean I'm a near to the authority of God amen who made you that not me he did every one of you as an heir to the same thing I'm an heir to a throne he's an overcometh shall sit with me on my throne as I overcame and sit on my Father's throne I'm in an heir to all things not just one thing all things everything's under your feet even death is under your feet graves and your feet hell is under your feet sin is under your feet everything is under your feet urine ear you're dead your life is hidden God through Jesus Christ and you rose again to eternal life sitting in here only places in Christ Jesus oh my shoe call us anything you want to call us what you want to say we're crazy if you want to but where is is to what all things are you an intern are you an inter Branham Tabernacle no I'm an heir to all things both seen present future to everything I'm an heir to it and every sin and wickedness has been put under my feet by the grace of Jesus Christ he rose on Easter morning triumph over death how the grave made me an heir and said wait yonder till I give you the promise and is anointed authoritative servant see the promises unto you and see your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call I'm an heir amen amen Jesus proved it to us on his resurrection oh my we'll move into the battlegrounds between death and life I'm a sinner brother branham you don't have to be you're a sinner because you desire to be you don't have to be the debts already paid brother branham brother Bram I wish I had joined you can have it you're just letting Satan rub you from the privileges that Christ died for I'm an heir to it it's all mine everything he died for belongs to me belongs to you we're his children we're stored everything that he died for now when you enter into that battleground that says oh there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know you're going to act funny and you're going to be something something's going to have been different I don't care what different it is I'm an heir to it that's life and I'm coming after that's right that's what ought to be the motive of every sinner I'm going to receive it upon the basis of the Holy Ghost who is here now telling me to come and receive it it's mine I'll never rise till I receive it I won't be a fanatic I'm going to stay right here I don't care what anything goes I'll never cease praying till he gives me the Holy Ghost Lord and I know you've got to do it right now if there's anything wrong in my life tell me about it I'll do it what is it Lord I'll go make it right if God doesn't reveal anything you say then Satan I comfort you can't stand there no longer get out of my way hallelujahs hallelujah there you are this is my story this is my song I'm heir of salvation what is salvation something that's given to you it's a gift I'm an heir of salvation what kind for eternal life salvation for my soul salvation for my body salvation for my weariness salvation for everything God made me an heir of everything through Christ he died rose returned back and brought the evidence and poured it out upon us oh my glory oh my now you go up there what do you do just like Abraham did got up there with that promise God you told me it's mine I've got faith in your promise I'm bringing your word you promised this you said ask you shall receive seek you shall find ask it shall be given knock it shall be opened Here I am Lord I'm here I'm knocking seeking asking I've got to receive it they were something takes place then oh when you lay that word down hallelujah I'm a near to joy I'm a near to piece of an answer long-suffering I'm here to rejoicing I'm a near to revival on the edge of the reality of Christ I'm here to healing I'm here to the Holy Ghost I'm here to all things I'm here to overcoming power hallelujah I'm heir to all things why cuz he made me an heir I didn't make myself an heir he made me an heir hallelujah hallelujah and he's here to pour it out upon us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if I Munir it's mine and you go tell Satan get out get off my Mountain devil get away from me I'm an heir of all things hallelujah you've got to tell the devil where to go Amen so I said now before so God's Word will not return to Him void and every promise includes a people in that promise now we know that Jesus fulfilled many scriptures when he when it went here's here he was here on earth and so now when God spoke the promises you're pertaining to the Messiah he knew who would fulfill it he says in John 1 and 1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the was God and the same was in the beginning with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth so every promise of the Messiah became flesh and it prospered and what have seen to do hallelujah it didn't it didn't return to avoid when God said I'm gonna have a perfect lamb didn't return to avoid amen though the scripture says in 2nd Corinthians 3 and to you ye are our epistle Soave be with us on our Thursday yeah our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not on tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart so so the Apostle Paul is saying the words that we have spoken your the manifestation of the word that we have preached Amen so now so now the bride we know is the Word of God made flesh I mean we are part of that word hallelujah so now if we are part of that word amen then we have to recognize if God sent his word upon the earth to produce a bride amen it will accomplish that what you seem to do I just want you to have more confidence God you sent your promise upon the earth it's going to be a people taking a rapture I know I'm part of that because I feel the pool the deep calling to the deep amen and so therefore amen we will not return you know that promise will be fulfilled exactly as God has said it will be fulfilled now he says improving his word he says speaking of John the Baptist this is but he had an important job that was to announce the Messiah cuz why God kept his word proved it a voice of one crying from the seminary behold I've got my doctor's degree that might have been right in the old lady's birthday almanac but not in God's Word he says the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way the Lord and make his paths straight was he preparing the way of the word then that the word can be made manifest he says hallelujah he says don't you see it seeing shadows' stop here for a minute and the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest and we're now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man so you know we have the evidence that the land is there because we're living in the land now Bobby C's has got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest now he's not just speaking about his own ministry he's talking about a bride I mean because remember we know in the garden there was a man and a woman having dominion over the earth right and that was that was a that was a type of what you would be with Christ in the Millennium hallelujah so now so now we know that Jesus was the second Adam he was prophesied through the Bible he's going to come he's going to be the Redeemer he'll be the God's manifestation of his salvation you know he will save his people from their sins that was all you know or prophesied of him but that was just the man the second Adam but there's got to be a second Eve hallelujah there's got to be the woman restore del Sol if God's are a fully restored man hallelujah because of what Christ did now they can be a fully restored woman holy that she will be made in His image her brother have said that she is him why because we are part of him Holly is just like you take you know we can go into Ruth you know when Ruth married Boaz she was no longer Ruth of my web she was Ruth obviously him I mean he was the mighty man of wealth she became the mighty woman of wealth because of him hallelujah she lost her identity when she became married with Boaz hallelujah as a say and you can take Rahab she uh she was the harlot Rahab but when God destroyed her past hallelujah God annihilated her pastors don't living witness no more of what she used to do and then she married Salman she was no longer Rahab of Jericho a harlot no she was mrs. Salman of Judah I live because she no longer had her her her own identity and that's why you've got it the devil reminds you of what you used to be he'll never tell you what you are holy but God wants you to know who you are not what you used to be but what you are holy just like the woman at the well here she was she had six five five husbands you know she thought what marriage doesn't work or just live with the sixth one but the seventh one came to the well hallelujah and we know the woman of the world not from what she was but what she became hallelujah it's the same thing with us I mean God does remember what we were but what we are and him hallelujah so that's why we say she is him because why the bride's identity is in him in the word so there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest now we know that's the Bride of Christ everything that was manifested in the second Adam is gonna be manifested in the bride Talia it was it was first displayed as a mature wave sheaf and the Ministry of brother Browne guys showing this is what my life does this is what Calvary produces this is what a redeemed son does he has dominion over nature dominion over death he has dominion over the devil not because of him but because of the Lord in him brother I'm said I'm just your brother I'm waiting for him to come hallelujah he didn't glorify himself no he glorified the Lord our Lord Jesus but God was demonstrating this is what my blood does and he wanted you to see it why do you want you to see it because he wanted you to realize just as he came forth in that way you will have dominion over Satan as well you'll have Dominion you will be restored back to what they had before the fall hallelujah oh one day can we just quit your side I kind of that again you say one day get in the Barrow getting that promise now hallelujah it's not all one day 1020 years now now now now there's a people you gotta say Lord show me the power of your salvation in my life show me the power of the blood in my life right now hallelujah because it's your doing its your salvation it's not my salvation it's your salvation show me the power of your blood what to do to give me joy give me peace give me rest give me the Thanksgiving heart give me a stable walk colors I'm not tossed to and fro any by whatsoever around me or even my own emotion give me a stable walk show me what your blood does show me hallelujah that your blood will cause my place to become subject to your work and that's you living through me not my own self hallelujah just get in the Barrow hallelujah you can you can unblock that how you can Amen so to be a place for pet and this is this is us now he so he see that improving its word now and the identified masterpiece of God he says Amen Lord make me mold me make me Lord what I should be then there'll be a different thing then if I be lifted up from the earth I'll draw all men unto me yes sir see he's cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get trying to get back to a bride for the son another masterpiece part of the word the word so he's saying that the bride is part of the work of a part of the groom hallelujah so now there's only one meeting places and God's provide a place of worship he says there's only one meeting place that's in Christ Jesus Oh today how today I would have everybody see that see how to get in being baptized the bride as part of her husband the church as part of the word the manifestation now what church you in a union denomination if you are all strictly tell you now you're in lady osya but if you're in Christ you're a new creature and you're in Christ and you're in the Church of the Living God with the manifestation of the very same things he did in his day we'll be coming back here in this day doing the same thing that he said it would do then it's the real church you get into it by spiritual baptism not by joining not by some more but being baptized by the Holy Ghost into his body alright it's God's only provided way that he is left for us to do is to be baptized into his body by his Spirit and then and then this isn't seen is not ever the shook he says that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride as part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled on this day there's the same part of the word that was to be fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience the same life hallelujah so now let's just wait can I have that again sorry okay that's gonna get sick of me he says now so we are part of his word I just want know when you look in the mirror in the morning what do you see DC and aged face do you see a tired eyes what what do you see when you look at the person in the mirror if you're looking at your natural self you're looking at the wrong person you're looking at the wrong person he says now so for so my so shall my word that got out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void so if we are part of his word he's already spoken us forth that's why we're here we're not here by chance I mean we're part of God's Word manifested for this hour so we will not return unto Him void or it be or worthless no but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing we're into I sent it so now when he says he's going to have a bride in these last days what that's his word that's spoken forth hallelujah so what he's saying is now it will accomplish I'm just probably repeating myself but I feel to repeat myself it will accomplish that which he's purposed it may be so he says he's gonna have a bride he's gonna have a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing what's gonna have to happen though the power of the blood has to be magnified or showed its true power hey Shawn truly what it can do it has to be shown it's gonna be shown before the eyes of the people that we can realize yes by by the cross we are without spot we are without wrinkle or was that any such thing I mean that's why you know we can never be too free hallelujah because when God said he took away our sin he took away our shame he's taking away our guilt he's taken away our past he's taking away even our future he's taking our first birth that's been annihilated it's been done away with holy what did you try to tell you that there is no spot or wrinkle or any such thing that can be held against you Holly you've got to begin to realize other scripture says we shall know as we are known so there comes a day and we're living in a day when we shall know as God knows us I mean if we are known if we knows we are knowing we won't beat ourselves up hallelujah you know you we'd probably don't have time for now but the prophets of the Old Testament were the word for the age many of them had to do a lot of what we'd call crazy stuff one was told lie on the side for so many days lie on the other side so many days I think I say I had to walk naked through the streets you know one had to make make cake make make bread and put human feces in it but he said no I can't do that okay then didn't put animal dung in it had to eat it had to all these kind of things but it was God's Word manifested in front of the people I'll say this God hasn't called us to do any of those things right but that was God's Word manifested amen you can even take know me being a Moabite don't call me no me no more call me Mara because my life is bitter it was actually Pleasant worship him in her her her husband please don't worship within that your meaning of their names so there was a time winner was a place in worship but then it became a better life God ordained these steps God ordained their steps God took them through dark places she had to lose her husband and her sons she actually had to have a bit of walk why because Ruth had to comin but that was what her walk was called to be hallelujah as the same thing with us sometimes you know we you know we can look at our walk and you know we can't compare ourselves with each other we can't compare ourselves because we know your brother Brent says it's like you know the bride is like a bouquet different flowers they have different fragrances they grow on different conditions but it's still part of the bouquet so so he may call you to go through a very dark place hallelujah and sometimes we're wondering Lord where are you leading me and sometimes we even doubt Lord or even leading me here look at Joseph's life that's what do you think you know our walk is tailor-made for us God doesn't get surprised you know he doesn't have a stand-up meeting on Monday morning angels what do you think they'll do today he knows exactly where you're gonna go he's gonna have confidence though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil so you may go through some dark places like the prodigal son I'll say he had to go he had to go and be a protocol you know of course it caused great anguish and and distress in his parents you know saying you know they tried to give him the best but he won't do what he wanted to do anyway he said now I'm gonna have my own way he had to go sometimes we think the world has fallen apart and God says no this is exactly where I want - hallelujah wait you think man this is where's the light at the end of the tunnel God says just keep walking you'll see it our walks individual but you have to have confidence my word will not return unto me void this message why why is it gripped you because God is identifying you're part of me it's a merit it's a bridegroom call so now if ever it's gripped you you know if it's gripped you and you've given yourself to it you say Lord by your grace I'm part of your word so I cannot return to you empty I can't return to you you know you know it's like the fight your the talents you know we get scared Lord am I using my gift for you am I scared no the bride doesn't have a fair relationship why why that man barriers talent he says yo he says basically you're very hard man and I was scared if I tried to use I'll lose it than you'll be mad at me so I buried it his relationship with the master was based on fear that's why he hid his talent but the bright God wants to take away all fear why why should we beat you no the Bible says in Hebrews 11 but without faith it's impossible to please him it's impossible without faith you can't please God without faith but you swap it around with faith it's impossible not to
