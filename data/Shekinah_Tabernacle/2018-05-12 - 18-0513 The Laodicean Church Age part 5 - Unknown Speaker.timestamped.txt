[4:07] give my hand cup of praise this morning
[4:09] thank you Jesus hallelujah amen well
[4:14] join me to the Book of Psalms 146 if you
[4:17] have your Bibles
[4:30] ayman I read one verse from 146 and one
[4:35] verse 447 mm I love you blesses you this
[4:38] morning the first verse of hundred and
[4:40] forty-six reason as wise praise ye the
[4:43] Lord praise the Lord O my soul while I
[4:47] live
[4:47] will I praise the Lord I will praise I
[4:50] will sing praises unto my god while I
[4:53] have any beer so while I have any breath
[4:56] with every fiber of my being because
[4:59] that's why we're created
[5:00] hallelujah and the first verse 147
[5:03] reason is wise praise ye the Lord for it
[5:05] is good to sing praises unto our God for
[5:09] it is pleasant and praise is commonly so
[5:12] I looked up the meaning of calmly in
[5:15] Google and calmly is described as
[5:17] something beautiful something
[5:19] captivating something charismatic
[5:21] delightful engaging not within us
[5:24] ourselves but that's how God sees us so
[5:27] when we worship that's how he sees us
[5:29] from his throne of heaven and what you
[5:31] like to make your God knows your Savior
[5:34] smile upon you this morning in in in
[5:37] spirits hallelujah Amen and sometimes
[5:41] the devil has a way of convincing us God
[5:43] maybe our knees a bit too weak to dance
[5:45] you know our arms are a bit too heavy to
[5:48] praise our Heavenly Father that our
[5:51] voices are battuto up you know that we
[5:53] don't want to sound bad in front of our
[5:55] neighbor also have to forget about
[5:57] ourselves
[5:58] alleluiah less slowly invite the Lord to
[6:03] be with us this morning so I encourage
[6:05] you with every fiber of your being
[6:07] worship him for he will bless you and
[6:11] musicians hallelujah play with
[6:14] everything within you
[6:16] let's all worship together amen in all
[6:19] spirits and in truth

[42:46] in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god
[42:49] bless you everyone you may have your
[42:50] seats so I want to continue talking
[42:53] about I'd like to welcome brother Harry
[42:56] here god bless you if Jesse feel at home
[42:58] as well wonderful to have you I want to
[43:02] continue on talking about you know the
[43:04] latest in church aging and where we are
[43:06] in this span of time that we're living
[43:09] in and and it's incredible to see yo the
[43:12] the amount of Scripture that God has is
[43:14] fulfilling in this day and I want to as
[43:17] we talked about last Sunday speaking
[43:19] about how revelations 9 how the
[43:21] bottomless pit healthfirst Satan has
[43:22] fallen I mean he fell from his position
[43:25] in heaven and he's and and the
[43:27] bottomless pit is open hell is open
[43:29] itself upon the earth and but but we
[43:31] know that as all of hell is here all of
[43:33] heaven is present upon the earth as well
[43:35] because if you continue to read through
[43:37] revelations 9 and you're going to you
[43:39] know chapter 10 which we will go into
[43:41] more this the service but yes and I saw
[43:45] another mighty angel come down from
[43:46] heaven so when this one falls and the
[43:49] bottomless pit opens in a mighty Christ
[43:51] Himself comes down he comes down upon
[43:54] the earth because he's going to do a
[43:55] quick short work in the end time he's
[43:57] going to gather his children to the to
[43:59] himself
[44:00] amen he's going to hold back the powers
[44:01] of darkness as this is going on and I
[44:04] just want to just as a bit of a
[44:06] background we're going to speak about
[44:07] Haggai and then we're going to go to the
[44:10] Ministry of Moses but we see here that
[44:12] so this is this is written during the
[44:15] time of the restoration of the
[44:16] rebuilding of the temple after Israel
[44:19] has been in the promised land many years
[44:21] and they were taking captivity into
[44:23] Babylon and they came back out of
[44:25] Babylon after 70 years of captivity and
[44:27] now they're there and they're rebuilding
[44:29] the temple they're rebuilding Jerusalem
[44:31] and and the people had to be stirred up
[44:33] by the Spirit of God to fulfill amen the
[44:36] rebuilding of the of the city and the
[44:38] temple and God as God is speaking to
[44:40] them trying to get them to
[44:41] see that the same that he is the same
[44:44] God that covenant 'add the word that you
[44:47] know when they came out of Egypt he's
[44:48] tried to tell them that
[44:49] don't thank God I he says according he
[44:52] says and work for I am with you said the
[44:54] Lord of Hosts according to the word that
[44:56] I covenant had with you when you came
[44:57] out of Egypt so my spirit reigning
[45:00] remaineth among you fear ye not so the
[45:03] same God that took them out of Egypt was
[45:05] still present there in the land he was
[45:08] still there with his children that they
[45:10] would fulfill their portion of the word
[45:12] I mean it was allotted to them he was
[45:14] still present and we've got her I trust
[45:16] we understand that when brother Branham
[45:18] was taken off the scene Christ the
[45:20] mighty angel did not leave I mean just
[45:23] because God took us took his brighter
[45:25] I mean took his profit off the scene it
[45:27] doesn't mean God left I mean the same
[45:29] God that was with Malachi forest with
[45:31] the Bride of Christ in this hour he's
[45:34] the same God he does the same things I'm
[45:36] in that same atmosphere I mean that same
[45:39] presence we feel I mean it's the same
[45:41] God that was back there God hasn't
[45:43] changed one bit
[45:45] Amen so now I want to so Moses now we we
[45:51] know just just just a brief background
[45:53] you know Moses he was given you know he
[45:56] was commissioned to take a people out of
[45:58] out of the land of Egypt and God said I
[46:02] have come down I've heard the cries of
[46:04] my people I'm sending you a cease I'm
[46:07] going to give you two signs that have
[46:08] voices and if they wanna and the first
[46:11] sign was the leprosy he put his hand in
[46:13] his bosom pulled it out it became white
[46:15] like me you know as leprosy put it back
[46:17] in and then it went away
[46:18] and then the next one was he took his
[46:20] rod and he cast it to the ground it
[46:21] turned into a serpent and so God told
[46:25] Moses if you if they will not hear the
[46:27] voice of the first sign didn't I hear
[46:29] the voice of the second sign it says
[46:31] after that I'll give you another sign we
[46:33] just pull take water and poured upon the
[46:35] earth he'll turn into blood and then it
[46:37] that he's basically saying if they do
[46:38] not hear this then judgments going to
[46:40] come I mean a brother brand was given
[46:42] given to science I mean the sign in the
[46:45] hand and in the discernment if you're
[46:46] sincere you'll come to know the secrets
[46:48] and thoughts of the people's hearts I
[46:50] mean that ministry was sent to the earth
[46:52] and it caused the healing revival to
[46:54] sweep
[46:55] world I mean because God was causing an
[46:57] exodus to happen I mean there's been a
[47:00] parallel of the Ministry of Moses and
[47:02] Joshua is being looked at in this day I
[47:05] mean we are living in Bible days again
[47:07] it's not just a story of history but
[47:10] it's a pattern that's been laid out and
[47:11] we're living in that pattern
[47:13] I mean suggest is just aunt Moses called
[47:16] the people out of Egypt I mean they came
[47:18] to Mount Sinai God came down on Mount
[47:21] Sinai with a word with a covenant amen
[47:24] and then so but that the purpose of that
[47:26] word wasn't for them to dwell in the
[47:28] wilderness the purpose of that word as
[47:30] they would have fellowship with their
[47:31] God they would have a sacrifice approach
[47:34] to God I mean that God would walk among
[47:36] them that God would dwell among them and
[47:38] the purpose of it was for them when they
[47:41] get into their promised land it wasn't
[47:43] for their wilderness journey only but
[47:45] the purpose of the law coming on Mount
[47:46] Sinai is that God would dwell with his
[47:49] people in the promised land that was the
[47:51] purpose of the law
[47:53] amen it's the same thing now with us
[47:55] many people say well the message was 50
[47:58] years ago we've gone on we haven't gone
[48:01] on that same word of place today you
[48:04] take that word that God is enjoying to
[48:06] you and you take it into a promised land
[48:08] and it lives as in that right I mean
[48:12] that same that's why this messages is a
[48:15] today's message
[48:16] it's not a yesterday's message you say
[48:18] well societies change God's Word hasn't
[48:21] changed amen brother brand many
[48:23] prophecies of today I mean it's more
[48:26] up-to-date right now the day you're
[48:27] alive than when he spoken hallelujah so
[48:31] but now we're called to work I mean
[48:36] according to the word that I have
[48:38] covenant to do when you came out of
[48:39] Egypt now this is just an I should turn
[48:46] it on here we go let's go to Hebrews
[48:48] chapter 9
[48:58] Hebrews 9 in verse 13 this is for if the
[49:06] blood of bulls and goats and the ashes
[49:09] of a heifer sprinkling the unclean
[49:12] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[49:15] flesh how much more shall the blood of
[49:18] Christ who through the Eternal Spirit
[49:20] offered himself without spot to God
[49:22] purge your conscience from dead works to
[49:24] serve the Living God and for this cause
[49:27] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[49:30] that by means of death for the
[49:32] redemption of the transgressions that we
[49:34] were under the first Testament they
[49:36] which are called might receive the
[49:39] promise of eternal inheritance they
[49:43] meant an hour for where our Testament is
[49:48] which is also will there must also there
[49:53] must also of necessity necessity be the
[49:56] death of the testator for a testament as
[49:59] a force after men are dead otherwise it
[50:02] is of no strength at all while the
[50:04] testator liveth whereupon neither the
[50:07] first Testament was dedicated without
[50:10] blood for when Moses had spoken every
[50:14] precept to all the people according to
[50:17] the law he took the blood of calves and
[50:19] of goats with water and scarlet wool and
[50:22] hyssop and sprinkled both the book and
[50:23] all the people saying this is the blood
[50:26] of the Testament which God hath enjoined
[50:30] unto you
[50:32] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[50:35] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[50:37] the ministry and almost all things are
[50:39] by the law purged with blood and without
[50:42] the shedding of blood is no remission so
[50:46] now Moses here and type because the law
[50:49] is a shadow he receives a word from God
[50:52] he receives the word from God and then
[50:55] he joins by the sacrifice he joins the
[50:59] book the word to the people that they
[51:01] become one by a sacrifice it's not just
[51:05] here something that maybe if you like it
[51:07] you can read and you can you know enjoy
[51:09] and maybe debate about it wasn't that
[51:11] I'm gonna join this word this is good
[51:14] this is God's mind I'm gonna join I'm
[51:17] gonna cause my people to become one with
[51:19] this covenant by am i doing I'm gonna
[51:22] join them but they become reciprocal
[51:24] you cannot separate God and His Word and
[51:27] God joining himself to his people right
[51:30] you cannot separate them so in God God
[51:33] gave that word to Moses and he spoke it
[51:36] to the people and they said all these
[51:38] things we will do
[51:39] he took the sacrifice and he sprinkled
[51:42] the book and the people joining them
[51:44] together that they would become one he
[51:47] said well how does that parallel today
[51:48] we've had a prophet like under Moses
[51:50] come the first part of his ministry was
[51:53] an exodus ministry where a people were
[51:55] called out by the power of God from this
[51:57] world out a denomination out of unbelief
[52:00] I mean where a word would be sent upon
[52:02] the earth and he'll call the people out
[52:04] hallelujah and then the second part that
[52:06] Minister is the reason we have been
[52:07] called out as would become one with
[52:09] Jesus Christ we just weren't called out
[52:11] to be in the wilderness wandering around
[52:13] and it is at some place but because we
[52:15] are called out to - to a union to a
[52:18] wedding that's why he called us up come
[52:21] get married hallelujah can become one
[52:24] with me and we know we don't become one
[52:26] with the Prophet we become one with the
[52:28] God that was revealed through the
[52:29] prophets
[52:30] Amen he's just the vial that God
[52:32] happened to use just like John the
[52:33] Baptist the voice of one crying in the
[52:35] wilderness he just happened to fulfill
[52:37] that Scripture amen and his whole
[52:40] purpose was the join of people to Jesus
[52:42] Christ introduced them I mean this
[52:44] message is to introduce you to Jesus
[52:46] Christ I Pratt has even look beyond the
[52:48] veil in his language in whatever he
[52:50] phrases it uses but it's God speaking
[52:52] through that man here we see this is
[52:54] Jesus speaking to me I mean so they took
[52:57] a word now they needed that law because
[52:59] God said if you keep this word you'll be
[53:01] successful and you'll dwell in your land
[53:04] and you possess the fullness of your
[53:05] inheritance I mean by this word that
[53:07] I've joined to you now we've come to a
[53:12] we've come to a spot now where we know
[53:15] the book is not sealed I mean there was
[53:17] the everything Adam lost went up to the
[53:20] hands of the original owner you know God
[53:22] Himself in Revelations four and five a
[53:24] book was
[53:25] the inheritance the internal inheritance
[53:27] of of the believer was sealed up I mean
[53:30] for a season but now we've come to that
[53:32] season where it's not sealed up anymore
[53:34] I mean we're a prophet would come and he
[53:38] would receive that word that book would
[53:39] come open now I might be jumping here to
[53:41] myself but I want you just to get a
[53:43] parallel with the inheritance with
[53:45] people probably they looked at it what
[53:47] does the Bible mean what does the saying
[53:48] and learn at people would would probe
[53:50] and try to understand how the scripture
[53:53] goes together there's always these loose
[53:55] ends where man's wisdom comes to a scene
[53:57] and it always does that's why God had to
[53:59] seen a prophet in the end time to take
[54:02] all the loose ends take away all the
[54:04] things that was just man's ideas and God
[54:06] would purify the word through that
[54:08] ministry that a people could receive a
[54:10] pure word again hallelujah I was want to
[54:14] put this on you just now I was listening
[54:17] to this is an influence in 1963 brother
[54:21] Branham just a few days before this I
[54:23] think it's New Years Eve he preaches
[54:25] services just the time of the end and
[54:27] he's relating how he has the vision of
[54:30] the seven angels coming to him so this
[54:32] is this is hanging on his heart he knows
[54:34] it's going to happen and he's actually
[54:36] in Arizona when he's preaching these
[54:37] meetings and he says we're told in
[54:40] Revelations 10 that there'll be a
[54:42] messenger in the last day that will
[54:44] gather up these little ends and we'll
[54:46] bring them together and in the mystery
[54:48] of God would be finished at the sounding
[54:50] of this angel which was a messenger of
[54:52] the earth the one came down from heaven
[54:54] with his hands up rainbow over his head
[54:57] and swore that there'll be time no more
[54:59] an angel taking an oath and when we see
[55:02] this thing is materializing
[55:04] oh how sincere we should be all promises
[55:07] of God are true but their own conditions
[55:09] no matter how fundamentally right we are
[55:11] we've got to approach it in the right
[55:13] way now ameen can be fundamentally right
[55:16] and still not receive the blessings of
[55:18] god because it's approached in the wrong
[55:21] way it goes upon conditions now notice
[55:24] this he's looking for something to
[55:26] happen he's looking for something to
[55:28] happen in the future when this when this
[55:30] happens hey but he says we begin to see
[55:32] it materializing around us that's more
[55:35] than just a prophecy but the prophecies
[55:36] about to be fulfilled
[55:38] is how sincere we should be I mean when
[55:41] you see when he sees this word is
[55:43] beginning to be fulfilled he sees how
[55:44] sincere should we be and we're not
[55:47] looking for it to happen it's already
[55:49] happened I mean so how sure how sincere
[55:52] should we be when God is fulfilling the
[55:55] promise of the ages in our day in our
[55:57] and in our lives
[55:59] I mean we shouldn't just come in wide
[56:00] and loose and say well you know just
[56:03] just staggering and what you're
[56:04] wandering around we should be sincere we
[56:07] should be deadly sincere when God has
[56:09] given us a promise they which are alive
[56:11] and remain we're not hinder them which
[56:13] are asleep of the dead in Christ rise
[56:15] first and then they which are alive and
[56:16] remain shall be caught up with them to
[56:18] meet the Lord in the air and we know
[56:20] that that that price is really begin to
[56:22] happen because the Lord has descended
[56:24] with a shout I mean the end of his
[56:25] ministry brother Graham says that the
[56:27] shot is the message I mean calling a
[56:29] bride to Jesus Christ so the first part
[56:32] of that cycle has already begun house
[56:34] and says should we be I mean God our
[56:38] Lord I want to be taken off the earth I
[56:40] don't just want to stagger it and
[56:42] stagger out and just take it haphazard
[56:44] and yes you'll be right mating you
[56:46] whatever sweet ass bro and no kick that
[56:49] out the door we should be deadly sincere
[56:52] with this word that we have received we
[56:54] shouldn't just take it casual and say
[56:57] well isn't this just lovely no go beyond
[57:00] that amen
[57:02] we should be deadly sincere he said
[57:05] prophet had to be sincere we need to be
[57:08] sincere amen now we read this we read
[57:16] this last Sunday but he says now you see
[57:19] I'm not making it up I'm speaking of the
[57:22] book coming up in Revelations 10 it says
[57:24] thus saith the Lord I'll read it to you
[57:25] out of the book the mist the sounding of
[57:27] the seventh angels message the mystery
[57:29] of God should be finished has been
[57:30] declared by his holy prophets that the
[57:33] prophets who who has wrote the word at
[57:36] the sounding of the seventh church age
[57:37] the last church age at the all the loose
[57:40] ends that through these church ages have
[57:42] been probed it will be wound up together
[57:44] and when the seals are broke and the
[57:46] mysteries revealed down comes the angel
[57:49] the message of Christ setting us foot
[57:50] upon the
[57:51] upon the sea with a rainbow over us he'd
[57:53] now remember the seventh angels on the
[57:55] earth at the time of this coming so he
[57:58] says when you see this mighty angel will
[58:00] come down when the seventh Ange seventh
[58:02] church eight messengers here he's
[58:04] already come and gone
[58:05] this has already happened how sincere
[58:08] should we be if God here comes God
[58:09] coming upon the earth I'm gonna I'm
[58:12] gonna unite myself with the people this
[58:14] is not a doctrine this is an anointing
[58:16] coming down this is a person and Spirit
[58:18] fall that's why I say over all that
[58:21] health all that hell is may be upon the
[58:23] earth but all that heaviness is here all
[58:25] that heaven all the power of heavens
[58:27] been emptied upon the earth I'm in for a
[58:29] great uniting time I mean where God
[58:31] would take his bride catch her away
[58:34] hallelujah this is this is what's going
[58:37] on today this day hallelujah I mean this
[58:43] day now he's just gone to revelations
[58:47] tender but if you want to turn with me
[58:49] you can see it there on the on the
[58:53] screen he sees here revelations 10 and
[59:03] one and I saw another mighty angel come
[59:06] down from heaven clothed with the cloud
[59:09] with a rainbow upon his head and his
[59:11] face as it were the Sun and his feet as
[59:14] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[59:16] little book open and set his right foot
[59:18] upon the sea and his left foot on the
[59:20] earth and he cried with a loud voice as
[59:22] well as when a lion roar and when he had
[59:25] cried seven thunders uttered their
[59:27] voices this is this this angel coming
[59:30] down this is Christ himself
[59:31] rainbow represents the Covenant he comes
[59:33] down the covenant angel the angel of the
[59:35] covenant that led Israel out of Egypt to
[59:38] the promised land he's the same one he's
[59:41] the same God here it comes upon the
[59:43] earth I trust this means something to
[59:45] you this is not theology you look at the
[59:47] anointing you're living under amen and
[59:50] so now he has a book open a Christ seven
[59:54] thunders uttered their voices now we're
[59:56] just going to read down to I think verse
[59:57] nine and when the seven thunders had
[59:59] uttered their voices I was about to
[1:00:01] write I heard a voice from heaven saying
[1:00:03] unto me seal up those things
[1:00:05] which the seven thunders uttered write
[1:00:06] them not and the angel which I saw stand
[1:00:09] upon the scene upon the earth lifted up
[1:00:11] his hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:00:14] liveth for ever and ever who created
[1:00:15] heaven and the things that therein are
[1:00:17] and the earth and the things that
[1:00:19] therein are and the sea and the things
[1:00:20] that there are now that time should be
[1:00:23] no longer there shall be no more delay I
[1:00:26] mean I'm going to wind up my plan of
[1:00:29] redemption this is coming to an end I'm
[1:00:31] going to bring the bride to her position
[1:00:33] as rails going to go to the homeland to
[1:00:36] receive me the Beast and all the
[1:00:38] Antichrist systems are going to come to
[1:00:39] their position this world is going to
[1:00:41] come to its position amen
[1:00:43] this is K this is the end time I'm gonna
[1:00:46] wind up this work very rapidly there's
[1:00:48] going to be no more delay it shall not
[1:00:50] tarry I mean the vision shall not tarry
[1:00:52] no longer it's going to become material
[1:00:55] hallelujah but in the days of the voice
[1:00:59] sorry my but in the days of the voice of
[1:01:02] the seventh angel when he should begin
[1:01:03] to sound the mystery God should be
[1:01:05] finished as he has declared to his
[1:01:07] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:01:09] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:01:11] again and said go and take the little
[1:01:13] book which is open in the hand of the
[1:01:15] angel which standeth upon the sea and
[1:01:16] upon the earth and I went unto the angel
[1:01:19] and said unto him give me the little
[1:01:20] book and he said unto me take it eat it
[1:01:22] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:01:25] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:01:28] honey now see here we have we have
[1:01:34] Christ ascending with a book open in
[1:01:39] Revelation now we know the book of
[1:01:40] Revelation is not all chronological at
[1:01:43] all you know it it's like a step letter
[1:01:46] you go up and down up and down so it's
[1:01:47] not you know so chapter 10 you know
[1:01:51] these things so the book coming up and
[1:01:54] everything this this overlaps the last
[1:01:56] church age okay even though we're in
[1:01:58] chapter 10 that's in chapter 3 but at
[1:02:00] all it overlaps know there was a so this
[1:02:05] angel that came down from heaven and he
[1:02:08] swore by him that liveth forever who
[1:02:10] created heaven and all things therein
[1:02:11] are and and created the earth and and
[1:02:15] created everything he's swearing by
[1:02:17] himself because Christ
[1:02:18] he could swear by no greater he swore by
[1:02:20] himself so this is this is Christ coming
[1:02:23] down who made all things and now he's
[1:02:25] swearing by himself that time shall be
[1:02:27] no longer but this is now the end time
[1:02:29] where I'm going to finish my plan right
[1:02:32] so now he's can and and will come into
[1:02:35] this later but this is very important
[1:02:37] because you got to have now when God
[1:02:38] swears I'm going to do something we
[1:02:41] should just we should build a cease from
[1:02:43] all strife we should judge him faithful
[1:02:45] he's more than able to do it I mean
[1:02:47] because that's that's the big battle
[1:02:49] have you judged some faithful have you
[1:02:51] just this word to be true I mean have
[1:02:53] you judged some able to keep us promise
[1:02:55] that he's given to you you got to judge
[1:02:57] him faithful because if you judge and
[1:02:59] faithful and you know he has it all in
[1:03:00] control you don't need to worry you
[1:03:03] don't need to stress you can't cast all
[1:03:04] your cares upon him because you know
[1:03:06] he's faithful if you don't believe he's
[1:03:08] faithful you hold on to your kids you'll
[1:03:10] hold on to your burdens and will become
[1:03:12] your problem but if you judge them
[1:03:14] faithful that now becomes his problem if
[1:03:16] you cast your kids upon him
[1:03:18] right so you got to judge them faithful
[1:03:22] now so there's a voice that cries out
[1:03:25] these seven thunders that that John
[1:03:28] Sorey heard he is about to write it but
[1:03:30] he was told to seal it up so there was
[1:03:32] part of God's Word that's been sealed
[1:03:34] until the time of the end now when God
[1:03:37] speaks it causes things to happen now
[1:03:40] you say well that's very obvious but you
[1:03:42] know you see John the Baptist came into
[1:03:44] Israel he began to speak that was God
[1:03:46] speaking forth out of a man from the
[1:03:49] wilderness and it caused an awakening
[1:03:51] over people
[1:03:51] it stirred up the whole you know
[1:03:53] originally the whole nation gets his
[1:03:54] multitude came out of Judea and Galilee
[1:03:56] and different ones to hear him I mean so
[1:03:58] everyone was stood up but there are a
[1:04:00] few among that group that their eyes
[1:04:02] came open and it awakened them and when
[1:04:06] Luther came and preached the just shall
[1:04:07] live by faith there was an awakening
[1:04:09] going on where people were sitting in
[1:04:11] cold traditional you know your Catholic
[1:04:14] Church they came out of that because
[1:04:16] there was there was a word went forth
[1:04:18] same with Wesley same with Pentecost and
[1:04:21] the same in this hour but there's a
[1:04:23] reason now God sends his word for a
[1:04:26] specific purpose now I just want to now
[1:04:30] brother branham
[1:04:31] if you go look at the healing revival
[1:04:33] before before the post will World War
[1:04:36] two a healing revival that the world
[1:04:38] actually attributes to the Ministry of
[1:04:40] brother branham being this being the one
[1:04:42] who actually initiated it before that
[1:04:45] the Pentecostal church was at a low ebb
[1:04:46] spiritually there's a great revival and
[1:04:49] God put a spirit out upon the earth and
[1:04:51] ministries just raised up overnight
[1:04:54] there was a great revival going on the
[1:04:56] Pentecostal move was the biggest move in
[1:04:58] the whole world in terms of converts
[1:05:00] coming into a church you know the the
[1:05:03] whole the whole landscape of you say
[1:05:06] America was changed because of the
[1:05:08] Pentecostal revival because the
[1:05:10] post-world War two healing revival the
[1:05:12] whole spiritual landscape of the place
[1:05:14] was changed so everyone thinks they're
[1:05:16] having revival but then brother Brahim
[1:05:19] sees this and doesn't third seal he says
[1:05:23] now he said it'd be the same thing we
[1:05:26] live in that day with it could be our
[1:05:28] guest
[1:05:29] it could be six hundred promises of them
[1:05:31] like that out of the scriptures just
[1:05:34] referring to it now but they rejected
[1:05:35] she held to her traditions and
[1:05:37] substitute instead of that she held to
[1:05:41] the substitute blood instead of the real
[1:05:43] blood the speaking of Jesus coming the
[1:05:45] first time Jesus the word said when he
[1:05:47] was manifested to her because she held
[1:05:50] to those tradition to these traditions
[1:05:52] Jesus the manifested word said to them
[1:05:55] to the bride Hebrew bride because you
[1:05:57] hold to your traditions you make the
[1:05:59] Word of God without any effect to you it
[1:06:02] can't be effective now that's what's the
[1:06:04] reason today that the revivals that the
[1:06:07] revivals that we're supposed to have
[1:06:09] we've had denominational revivals we
[1:06:12] haven't had a real stirring and they
[1:06:15] thought they're having a real stirring
[1:06:17] no no no no no sir
[1:06:20] don't think we've got revivals we
[1:06:22] haven't we've got millions and millions
[1:06:24] and millions of church members but not a
[1:06:26] revival no where no no the bride hasn't
[1:06:29] had a revival yet see there's been no
[1:06:31] revival there no manifestation of God to
[1:06:34] stir the bride yet see we're looking for
[1:06:36] it it will take those seven unknown
[1:06:38] thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:06:41] he will send it he promised it and yet
[1:06:44] we say well how's there being no
[1:06:46] Manifest no manifestation of God to stir
[1:06:48] the bride yet you know there are
[1:06:50] miracles upon miracles the thoughts of
[1:06:52] people's lives were you know their lives
[1:06:54] were exposed before them where this is
[1:06:57] where you're from this is your address
[1:06:59] this is what's wrong with you
[1:07:00] thousands and thousands of times the son
[1:07:02] of man was was revealed but he says
[1:07:05] there hasn't been a manifestation of God
[1:07:07] to stir the bride yet amen because it
[1:07:10] takes the word to manifest the bride
[1:07:13] it takes the opening of the word to men
[1:07:16] - what - awaken someone that's why
[1:07:19] supernatural will not convert someone it
[1:07:21] takes God opening his word to them I
[1:07:24] mean that their hearts become open and
[1:07:26] God makes his word real to them that
[1:07:28] awakens someone that is the true
[1:07:30] awakening when God reveals his word to
[1:07:33] you personally I mean it goes beyond
[1:07:35] someone else's testimony someone else's
[1:07:37] story but it becomes a living reality to
[1:07:40] you that causes an awakening I mean once
[1:07:44] you were maybe did in some religion or
[1:07:46] in the world but then he revealed his
[1:07:48] work to you and it went from here to
[1:07:50] here and you heard more than a man from
[1:07:52] Kentucky you had the voice behind the
[1:07:54] voice and a spoke to your soul and you
[1:07:57] became awakened I mean so now he say
[1:08:00] you'll take these seven are nine
[1:08:01] thunders to wake her again he will send
[1:08:04] it now he promised it now this is in the
[1:08:06] third seal this as the word because you
[1:08:08] could understand as brother Branham
[1:08:10] walks with God the message unfolds to
[1:08:13] him
[1:08:13] he doesn't know everything when he
[1:08:15] starts his ministry God and falses were
[1:08:18] the prophets only know what God reveals
[1:08:20] to them like the shunammite woman comes
[1:08:23] to Elisha and you know the shunammite
[1:08:25] woman's son has has died this is all
[1:08:29] been going on but now she comes to the
[1:08:31] prophet and the prophet Elijah doesn't
[1:08:33] know what's going on God hasn't told me
[1:08:35] prophets don't know everything they just
[1:08:37] only know what God's revealed so as God
[1:08:39] is walking with brother Branham God
[1:08:41] unfaltering the Prophet amen
[1:08:44] so not only does the message unfold to
[1:08:47] us it was unfolding to brother Branham
[1:08:49] as he was preaching it right Amen so now
[1:08:53] but now he sees this so this is this is
[1:08:56] 1963 during the seal sees it will take
[1:08:58] symma non non thunders to stir the bribe
[1:09:01] and then now we come to recognizing your
[1:09:05] day in its message in 1964 he says they
[1:09:07] want a Great Awakening they're crying
[1:09:09] believing that they will be awakened
[1:09:11] they're good people why is it what have
[1:09:14] they done they have not recognized the
[1:09:16] awakening of the bride see by being a
[1:09:19] Christian they feel the pull of the hour
[1:09:20] I I pray you feel more than the pull of
[1:09:23] the hour amen I pray you feel more than
[1:09:26] the pool but they haven't recognized
[1:09:28] what's been done that's what's making
[1:09:30] them feel that way they know something
[1:09:32] supposed to happen but see they're
[1:09:34] looking for it way off in the future to
[1:09:38] come when it's already happened right by
[1:09:41] you don't put it off
[1:09:42] God's going to move God's gotta move and
[1:09:44] he's already moving he's already moved
[1:09:47] oh he went he's he can open his word
[1:09:49] he's already open his word when is he
[1:09:51] going to take her people and adopt him
[1:09:53] into the body of Christ he's already
[1:09:54] done it
[1:09:55] when's he gonna call the bride he's
[1:09:56] already calling a bride I mean it's
[1:09:59] already happening don't put a wife in
[1:10:01] the future someplace the church world is
[1:10:03] looking for a great revival and you know
[1:10:05] and they prophesy it's going to happen
[1:10:06] and they're looking at the promise to
[1:10:08] Israel after the bride is already gone
[1:10:11] and they think it applies to them but
[1:10:12] applies to Israel they're gonna be
[1:10:15] bitterly disappointed amen and I pray we
[1:10:18] don't fall into that bracket that's why
[1:10:20] I believe with all my soul the same God
[1:10:23] that was there that you hear about on
[1:10:24] tape is present where the bride is that
[1:10:27] same God that same covenant angel as
[1:10:29] with his children that same Jesus was
[1:10:32] there he's here I mean if we just throw
[1:10:35] aside our whatever we're going on in
[1:10:38] love and just receive as promised take
[1:10:40] him at his word Amen you know we should
[1:10:43] all just go to digress a little bit
[1:10:45] there was a man it was a slave in
[1:10:48] America you know the story slave buyer
[1:10:51] goes to a plantation
[1:10:53] he wants to buy slaves and he sees this
[1:10:55] one slave he doesn't act like the rest
[1:10:57] of the slaves he's very different and he
[1:11:00] goes to the plantation owner who owns
[1:11:01] this slave and he sees can I buy that
[1:11:04] one he says no he's not for sale well
[1:11:06] then why is he so different and the
[1:11:09] owner says well I was wondering
[1:11:11] and I asked other slaves I come to find
[1:11:13] out that he is the son of a king his
[1:11:16] father is a king in a tribe in Africa
[1:11:19] and though he may never get back there
[1:11:22] and take his Father's throne
[1:11:24] he conducts himself as the son of a king
[1:11:26] because he is of royal blood so now but
[1:11:31] he was fed the same way as the other
[1:11:32] slaves he did the same work as the other
[1:11:34] slaves so everything of his life was the
[1:11:37] same as the other slaves but he did not
[1:11:39] react to the situation based on his
[1:11:42] position Amen of being a slave but he he
[1:11:47] reacted to it based on the office said
[1:11:49] he had the office he had was he is the
[1:11:51] King son are you following me so he
[1:11:54] reacted to everything around him because
[1:11:57] I'm a son of a king so he conducted
[1:11:58] himself that way and there should be the
[1:12:01] same thing with us we should never react
[1:12:03] to life based on our situation we should
[1:12:06] react in life based on the office that
[1:12:07] we live in right it's like a king you
[1:12:10] know a king if he forgets who he is then
[1:12:13] he can you don't worry about what's
[1:12:14] going on in the kingdom what well you
[1:12:16] know what are we gonna do with this and
[1:12:17] this this problem is this problem but if
[1:12:19] he just woke up and recognized I'm the
[1:12:21] King I have authority to deal with this
[1:12:23] I was authority to sort this out I'm
[1:12:25] gonna thority to fix this I mean all the
[1:12:27] kingdoms behind me it's in my hands I
[1:12:29] mean he he would wreck to something very
[1:12:32] differently than just appeasing on the
[1:12:33] street and it's got to be the same thing
[1:12:36] with us we can't just look at life like
[1:12:37] other people do and then we're to look
[1:12:39] at life according to being the sons and
[1:12:41] daughters of God I mean it'll change how
[1:12:44] you look at the world it'll change how
[1:12:46] you look at your family change how you
[1:12:48] look at your children I mean we don't
[1:12:49] need to be worried about everything who
[1:12:51] are you
[1:12:52] sons and daughters of God I mean that's
[1:12:55] why we should react to everything based
[1:12:57] on who we are and him a man isn't that
[1:13:01] right all of heaven is behind his
[1:13:03] children brother Bram says God will
[1:13:05] bankrupt heaven
[1:13:06] mmm before he lets one of us promises
[1:13:09] fail and never comes back insufficient
[1:13:12] funds I mean you gotta have confidence
[1:13:15] what does God made you what places he
[1:13:17] placed you in throw away the mind battle
[1:13:20] and say no his royal blood now flows
[1:13:22] through my veins what does he made you
[1:13:24] to be have a slave could do that amen
[1:13:28] the sons and daughters of God that are
[1:13:30] redeemed a meek ensure live that kind of
[1:13:32] way amen now they was believing in a
[1:13:42] coming Messiah they believed there'd be
[1:13:45] a forerunner come but it was right on
[1:13:47] them they didn't know it they didn't
[1:13:48] recognize it they believed there was a
[1:13:50] forerunner that would fall around the
[1:13:52] Messiah and they cut his cut his head
[1:13:54] off and killed the Messiah because it
[1:13:56] was prophesied that they'd be blinded
[1:13:58] Hosea said so and the same spirit that
[1:14:00] Spektor Hosea spoke through John and see
[1:14:03] the church and this last days would be
[1:14:05] naked blind and would put him outside of
[1:14:08] the church they failed to see these
[1:14:09] prophecies fulfilled but being in there
[1:14:12] they realized that something has got to
[1:14:14] happen they just don't get it they don't
[1:14:17] realize it much like the Jews of all
[1:14:19] times
[1:14:20] blinded later see a riches theology
[1:14:23] hostile with the church hostile towards
[1:14:26] the message because it didn't come their
[1:14:28] way and they failed to recognize the
[1:14:31] awakening of the bride now we read
[1:14:33] before they'll take these seven unknown
[1:14:36] thunders to stir her up and brother
[1:14:39] Brahim set off the other thing of the
[1:14:40] seals
[1:14:40] she has been awakened and he's asked
[1:14:44] very very straight questions he
[1:14:45] questioned had the seven thunders which
[1:14:48] equals seven mysteries already been
[1:14:49] revealed were they revealed in the seven
[1:14:51] seals but are yet but are not known to
[1:14:55] us as the thunders yet no this is his
[1:14:57] answers and questions and answers no
[1:14:59] they were revealed in the seven seals
[1:15:01] that's what the seven thunders was about
[1:15:03] they was to reveal the seven thunders
[1:15:05] then head out of their voices and no one
[1:15:07] could make out what it was John knew
[1:15:08] what it was but he was forbidden to ride
[1:15:10] it but he said but in the seventh angel
[1:15:12] in the days of his sounding the seven
[1:15:14] mysteries of the seven thunders would be
[1:15:16] revealed and the seventh angel as a
[1:15:18] messenger to the seventh church age so
[1:15:21] he makes it very clear it's no longer
[1:15:23] that's like when Jesus was there and he
[1:15:25] said father glorify thy name
[1:15:27] and then a voice from heaven Sparkle
[1:15:29] I've glorified it and I'll glorify it
[1:15:31] again some head of thunder some heard a
[1:15:34] voice so a thunder is the Word of God
[1:15:36] not not made plain but but it's not a
[1:15:39] thunder anymore it's a voice to us I
[1:15:41] mean you say well what has this got to
[1:15:44] do with me well I'll tell you when God
[1:15:46] releases his word he releases a power in
[1:15:49] that word I mean just like Winnie when
[1:15:52] that law was released on your Mount
[1:15:54] Sinai
[1:15:54] there was a power in that law that they
[1:15:57] could go to their promised land and
[1:15:58] possess it I mean there was a power in
[1:16:01] that law that they could march around
[1:16:02] Jericho they could conquered Jericho
[1:16:04] they could conquer every city every
[1:16:07] obstacle in front of them could be
[1:16:08] conquered because there's a power in
[1:16:10] that word now he sees here in Hebrews 1
[1:16:13] and 3 God who at sundry times I'm just
[1:16:17] trying to get you to see we don't just
[1:16:19] have a little musket we don't have a bow
[1:16:22] and arrow of some former age we've got
[1:16:25] the hot most high-tech weapon I mean
[1:16:28] with you know the full arsenal of
[1:16:29] heavens been opened it's been released
[1:16:32] to you use your weapon I mean don't be
[1:16:35] afraid to use the word take God at His
[1:16:37] Word He is God who at sundry times and
[1:16:41] divers manners spake in times past unto
[1:16:43] the father's by the prophets has in
[1:16:46] these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:16:48] son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:16:51] things by whom also he made the world's
[1:16:53] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:16:55] and the Express image of his person and
[1:16:58] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:17:01] power when he had by himself purged our
[1:17:04] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[1:17:07] Majesty on high now I want you to notice
[1:17:09] this he says this is in verse 3 and
[1:17:12] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:17:15] power not by it now this is not a play
[1:17:17] on words they don't say by the power of
[1:17:19] his word but by the word of his power so
[1:17:22] when God releases his word he releases a
[1:17:25] power with that word right he releases a
[1:17:28] power with that word that's why that's
[1:17:31] why when we receive him when we receive
[1:17:33] his word he gives us power to become the
[1:17:36] sons of God as many as received him gave
[1:17:40] him
[1:17:40] power to become the sons of God this is
[1:17:42] John one right to to become placed as a
[1:17:45] son of God in their position that's why
[1:17:48] it's so powerful faith is such an
[1:17:50] incredible thing what makes you believe
[1:17:53] what makes you believe you wait really
[1:17:56] you gotta think ability I actually don't
[1:17:58] know what caused me to believe this I
[1:18:01] really don't know but I heard a word one
[1:18:03] day I heard a word and it spoke to me
[1:18:06] like nothing else has ever spoken to me
[1:18:08] I mean it impacted my life like nothing
[1:18:11] else has impacted me and I just happened
[1:18:13] to believe it I can't put it in words I
[1:18:16] can't put it in some formula or some
[1:18:18] equation but I just happened to her
[1:18:19] believe this and then you can see now
[1:18:22] the life you now live I mean you live
[1:18:24] above what you used to be right because
[1:18:27] it gives you power to overcome whatever
[1:18:29] had hand you down now you stand on it
[1:18:32] right here
[1:18:34] you're the boss now I mean the Word of
[1:18:36] God in you is the boss and everything
[1:18:38] else has to shut up everything else is
[1:18:40] now under your feet I mean because God
[1:18:43] releases a power in his word hallelujah
[1:18:47] this now he say well now why is this now
[1:18:52] so why these seven thunders being
[1:18:54] released why is it because God didn't
[1:18:57] release that in the first church H John
[1:19:00] saw it he was about to write he said see
[1:19:02] all those things up says part of a power
[1:19:04] part of God's power was held back for
[1:19:07] the endtime are you following me right
[1:19:11] it was held back because there had to be
[1:19:12] something that the endtime bride would
[1:19:15] receive which would break the cycle of
[1:19:17] revival and death amen just like the day
[1:19:20] of Pentecost there was an awakening
[1:19:22] knows a revival I mean but not very long
[1:19:24] after that death begin to sit in to the
[1:19:26] Ephesian Church I mean then God would
[1:19:29] God would repeat the process here here
[1:19:31] at like someone's candle I mean to be a
[1:19:34] revival again but then it would die down
[1:19:36] and go on to death again there's a cycle
[1:19:38] of revival and death you can see it all
[1:19:40] the way down through church history take
[1:19:42] even in the Old Testament Moses you know
[1:19:45] you know the children of Israel came
[1:19:47] into the promised land under Joshua
[1:19:49] there was a revival they took the most
[1:19:51] of the land but then what happened
[1:19:53] and that generation died and then the
[1:19:55] people turned from serving God they
[1:19:57] started serving idols there was death
[1:19:59] now coming and then there be a season
[1:20:01] where they were under slavery they
[1:20:03] called out upon God God seemed to judge
[1:20:05] send a deliverer they were free for a
[1:20:07] season a revival happened but then they
[1:20:09] turn their hearts return to where again
[1:20:11] they started serving the idols of the
[1:20:13] other nations and so the cycle you read
[1:20:16] the book of Judges it's a cycle of
[1:20:17] revival and death revival and if all the
[1:20:21] way down because there wasn't a power in
[1:20:24] that law to break some nature out of the
[1:20:26] people and for them to break that cycle
[1:20:29] right but now but then you come to your
[1:20:33] fees and age and Ephesians means to aim
[1:20:35] it but relax they aimed at the high
[1:20:37] calling in Christ but they relaxed and
[1:20:39] then eventually the church went down to
[1:20:41] the dark ages revival and then death and
[1:20:44] then you come down to our age the cycle
[1:20:46] has to be broken the cycle of revival
[1:20:50] and death must be broken that it's just
[1:20:53] revival right because God is the cycle
[1:20:56] breaker that comes you know we have
[1:20:58] seasons we can have years you know we
[1:21:00] are creatures of time but there has to
[1:21:02] come a time when there's no time I mean
[1:21:05] where it goes from time to eternity and
[1:21:06] there's no time anymore so it's like why
[1:21:09] God releases his word to us as we would
[1:21:12] come to understand we're not creatures
[1:21:14] of time right our main existence is not
[1:21:17] in time right this is just a little part
[1:21:20] of our existence we came from God and we
[1:21:22] go back to him I mean we came out of a
[1:21:25] sinking we manifested upon the earth
[1:21:27] then he takes us home right we're not
[1:21:30] just here that you're our 70 years of
[1:21:32] what if we're allotted you know that's
[1:21:34] not us that's not the sum of our
[1:21:36] existence this is just a brief gap an
[1:21:39] eternity that's going to come to an end
[1:21:42] it has to come to an end amen of death
[1:21:45] and sickness and sorrow and pain and the
[1:21:48] devil's got to come to his end I mean
[1:21:50] he's got to burn and all those things
[1:21:52] are going to be done away with Oh
[1:21:53] hallelujah so we have to begin now we
[1:21:57] have to begin to see we are part of that
[1:21:59] breaking of the cycle I mean just like
[1:22:02] you can trace your family lineage and
[1:22:04] maybe you can see there was an alcoholic
[1:22:05] spirit
[1:22:06] I mean down from your great-great
[1:22:08] great-great-great or maybe not so
[1:22:10] great-grandfather you know there was it
[1:22:12] was a drinking problem in your family or
[1:22:14] there was a your unfaithfulness or you
[1:22:16] know whatever it was lying or resentment
[1:22:19] or unforgiveness or you know you can you
[1:22:21] can see that in your family but there
[1:22:23] comes a time when that comes to an end
[1:22:24] that cycle of that affecting you know
[1:22:27] that affecting the your your that
[1:22:30] generation in the next generation and
[1:22:31] then the one who has normally raised up
[1:22:33] under that they can see it in their
[1:22:35] parents eyes now I'll never be like this
[1:22:36] they become exactly like that because
[1:22:39] they have not the power to overcome that
[1:22:41] thing in them oh yeah I mean but there
[1:22:46] comes a time with ears of people that
[1:22:47] will break that cycle because God wants
[1:22:50] it broken not it's not they're doing
[1:22:52] it's his doing I'm going to wind up my
[1:22:55] plan I'm going to give the people a
[1:22:57] total victory I mean that they will
[1:23:00] overcome all of these things hallelujah
[1:23:03] and then you just find yourself at the
[1:23:05] end hallelujah and there's a person down
[1:23:08] in the lineages who has to break the
[1:23:10] cycle and you just find yourself sitting
[1:23:13] in that role
[1:23:14] Here I am here's your script what's my
[1:23:17] motivation victory what's my motivation
[1:23:20] redemption what's my motivation Satan's
[1:23:22] going to burn hallelujah
[1:23:24] what's my motivation divine love have
[1:23:27] been expressed hallelujah and then to
[1:23:30] the things that your forebears are you
[1:23:32] once wrestled with you don't wrestle
[1:23:33] with them anymore because God has given
[1:23:36] you Dominion hallelujah because he
[1:23:39] released God released a powerful power
[1:23:41] and his word for you to overcome these
[1:23:43] things that's why in faith cometh by
[1:23:45] hearing and hearing the Word of God I
[1:23:47] mean that's why we've got to listen
[1:23:49] that's why we should be a you know this
[1:23:53] thing takes up too much of our time and
[1:23:55] we let it do it this world is full of
[1:23:59] distractions just like Haggai and then
[1:24:02] where you're you're you know the
[1:24:04] rebuilding Jerusalem they're all
[1:24:06] distracted here's the enemy trying to
[1:24:09] come and stop building we're gonna kill
[1:24:10] you and all these things they got
[1:24:12] distracted by all those things they they
[1:24:14] had to get focused we're gonna rebuild
[1:24:16] the city
[1:24:18] I mean don't worry about the
[1:24:21] distractions of life you gotta make a
[1:24:23] make a look at your day or your week and
[1:24:27] and look at where y'all look at where
[1:24:30] your time goes where does your time go
[1:24:34] this is about redeeming the time you
[1:24:36] gotta claim back your time these things
[1:24:39] we have to do in life about children
[1:24:41] we've got jobs we've got
[1:24:41] responsibilities but what about your
[1:24:44] time what are you using your time for
[1:24:47] because you can scroll through all the
[1:24:49] you know I'm just scrolling through the
[1:24:51] news you know most of that we don't need
[1:24:54] to hear or read or see how did that help
[1:24:57] me it didn't help me it was actually
[1:24:59] negative impact on my life I don't want
[1:25:01] to know what Hollywood's doing or what
[1:25:03] the sports world is doing I don't really
[1:25:05] even care too much what Trump is doing
[1:25:07] let him do what he's gonna do he's gonna
[1:25:08] do it right oh god what are you doing
[1:25:12] what are you doing God what are you
[1:25:14] doing for me amen
[1:25:17] we should we should stay focused friends
[1:25:20] these are just a few more days to labor
[1:25:23] now for as the rain cometh down this is
[1:25:26] one of my favorite scriptures and the
[1:25:28] snow from heaven and returneth not
[1:25:30] feather but water with the earth and
[1:25:32] maketh it go forth and bud isaiah 55:10
[1:25:35] and 11 that it may give seed to the
[1:25:38] sower and bread to the eater so shall my
[1:25:41] word that go forth out of my mouth that
[1:25:43] shall not return unto me void but it
[1:25:46] shall accomplish that which I please and
[1:25:48] it shall prosper the thing with - I sent
[1:25:51] it
[1:25:51] I mean his word shall accomplish what it
[1:25:54] seemed to do Amen it's been sent to call
[1:25:57] a bride in this hour he's going to have
[1:25:59] a bride without spot or wrinkle washed
[1:26:01] in his blood made in His image I mean
[1:26:04] where the prophecies that she is him
[1:26:06] because to become one it's going to
[1:26:08] happen and you're gonna look at yourself
[1:26:10] and say it's happening and that's
[1:26:12] happening because I heard a word and
[1:26:14] something my eyes have come up and I
[1:26:16] become awakened anymore than by
[1:26:18] supernatural by a word that's been
[1:26:20] released and stirred me up it's awakened
[1:26:22] me hallelujah it's well what is it its
[1:26:25] effect on you
[1:26:27] amen I have become awakened I'm not a
[1:26:30] sinner anymore I'm not in the world I
[1:26:32] don't have some dated religion I have a
[1:26:34] living God
[1:26:34] I mean he's joined himself to me I mean
[1:26:38] he's awakened me we should never take
[1:26:40] these things casual you know we take it
[1:26:42] for granted
[1:26:42] we're the Bride of Christ we take it for
[1:26:44] granted oh we're going in a rapture we
[1:26:47] take that for granted
[1:26:48] we actually just take it for granted we
[1:26:50] should be so thankful oh Lord I want to
[1:26:53] serve you with everything all of my
[1:26:55] energy all that I am because he's worthy
[1:26:58] I mean we should just sit back and watch
[1:27:00] the world go by let someone else do that
[1:27:03] there's plenty of people doing that I
[1:27:05] mean there's not a lot of room on the
[1:27:07] grandstand let them sit there I want to
[1:27:08] run I mean let's build let's run with
[1:27:12] them amen his word will accomplish what
[1:27:15] it seemed to do that's why I said before
[1:27:17] have you judged him faithful you've got
[1:27:20] a judges word faithful because of it if
[1:27:22] you do judge it faithful then lord have
[1:27:24] you sent a messenger in this day to call
[1:27:26] a bride I mean he said the bridegroom
[1:27:29] call will come right through this this
[1:27:32] this ministry the Ministry of Malachi
[1:27:34] for he says well if that is true and
[1:27:36] that's you speaking hallelujah then you
[1:27:39] will call a bride and the bride's being
[1:27:41] called I mean you know we're like the
[1:27:43] 11th of the 11th 11th our workers we
[1:27:47] just we've just turned up just before
[1:27:49] clothes time it's like it's like for 459
[1:27:54] and and the office closes at 5:00 and
[1:27:57] here we are
[1:27:58] hallelujah I'm glad I'm in there hey man
[1:28:02] you glad you're in hallelujah I'm glad
[1:28:07] now this is from Hebrews chapter 6 as we
[1:28:13] read in Revelations 10 there he swore by
[1:28:16] himself that time shall be no longer for
[1:28:19] when God made a promise to Abraham
[1:28:22] because he could swear by no greater
[1:28:24] swear by himself saying surely saying
[1:28:28] surely blessing I will bless thee and
[1:28:30] multiplying I'll multiply thee and so
[1:28:33] after he had patiently endured he
[1:28:35] obtained the promise for men fairly
[1:28:38] swear by the greater and an oath for
[1:28:40] confirmation as
[1:28:41] to them and into all strife wearing God
[1:28:44] willing more abundantly to show to show
[1:28:48] unto the years of promise the
[1:28:50] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:28:53] by an oath so Abraham said God swore by
[1:28:57] himself Abraham I'm gonna do it I'm
[1:28:59] gonna make you father of Nations it
[1:29:01] looks impossible to the flesh amen you
[1:29:04] can't do it in your flesh but I've
[1:29:06] already done it I have made your father
[1:29:09] not I will I have that's why you know we
[1:29:12] just as we walk with God we're just
[1:29:13] becoming what we mean to be I mean we're
[1:29:16] we're meant to be made in His image God
[1:29:18] God took a photo of you at your best
[1:29:20] before the foundation of the world and
[1:29:23] put it in his family album and you're
[1:29:25] just becoming like that photo I mean you
[1:29:29] say well this thing's getting old though
[1:29:30] talk about the real you this is just
[1:29:31] your house you're in at the moment but
[1:29:33] your eternal self is becoming like that
[1:29:35] photo we're just going from glory to
[1:29:37] glory changing us bowling us every day
[1:29:40] amen and it's by his word that he
[1:29:42] doesn't write so he swore by himself
[1:29:46] he's going to do it and so with a
[1:29:47] confirmation of an author's Amen for men
[1:29:52] barely swear by greater and and oath for
[1:29:54] confirmation as to them and end to all
[1:29:56] strife that's why we enter into rest
[1:30:00] they mean that's why the the bride truly
[1:30:03] is resting in this hour in terms of he
[1:30:06] said it I believe it he confirmed it to
[1:30:08] me he made his promise alive to me
[1:30:11] therefore I can rest amen I can rest in
[1:30:15] him I mean we're still got to fight for
[1:30:18] every inch of ground every divine
[1:30:19] promise sure but we can race that he is
[1:30:21] going to do it you just got to step
[1:30:22] forward right hallelujah now we read
[1:30:27] that John was told to take thee well
[1:30:31] maybe I'll put it back up there 8 and 9
[1:30:34] he was told to take the book out of the
[1:30:37] Angels hand and eat it become one with
[1:30:41] this promise become one with this
[1:30:42] covenant now John in the book of
[1:30:44] Revelation is actually a symbol of you
[1:30:47] John is a symbol the Book of Revelations
[1:30:50] a book of symbols it's a book of
[1:30:52] prophecy but John himself is you
[1:30:55] the book because you come through you're
[1:30:58] from revelations one and he says I'm
[1:31:00] standing on the Isle of Patmos and hears
[1:31:03] a voice for voice behind him he turns
[1:31:05] and looks he sees seven golden
[1:31:06] candlesticks he sees the seven churches
[1:31:08] he's at the end of the city so this is
[1:31:11] already behind them this is like he's
[1:31:12] walking in time he doesn't know where he
[1:31:14] is until finally he's here at the end
[1:31:16] and and he turns he hears voices he sees
[1:31:19] the seventh Church ages behind him so
[1:31:21] God is actually telling you this is
[1:31:23] where you were because it's where John
[1:31:25] was because behind him was already the
[1:31:27] seventh Church ages right the seventh
[1:31:29] church age is already at its end where
[1:31:31] John was actually there and he heard the
[1:31:33] voice of the one walking in my seven
[1:31:35] church ages and then God begins to show
[1:31:37] so this is where you are in time anyway
[1:31:40] so this is what has been this is what is
[1:31:42] happening this is what will be right and
[1:31:44] then and then after you read the letter
[1:31:46] C in church age which is our church age
[1:31:47] revelations for one I heard that same
[1:31:49] voice in heaven and as the doors open
[1:31:52] say come up hither so it's the rapture
[1:31:54] the rapture of the bride at the end of
[1:31:56] the seventh church age so one man in a
[1:31:59] vision one man is a symbol of a whole
[1:32:01] group of people those that are dead in
[1:32:03] Christ and those who are alive and
[1:32:04] remain as represented in John right so
[1:32:07] John is a seal in the book I mean I mean
[1:32:10] it's a symbol in the book so as so as
[1:32:12] John was told to take the book take this
[1:32:14] open book out of the Angels hand and eat
[1:32:16] it now so it is speaking now over people
[1:32:20] now this is the book that's come open
[1:32:22] every divine promises in here right this
[1:32:26] message makes this plain it reveals
[1:32:28] Christ in here the message does and so
[1:32:30] now every divine promise everything that
[1:32:32] Adam fell from we have been restored to
[1:32:35] right so now we have to become one with
[1:32:38] that and then it becomes manifested in
[1:32:41] our lives so it's not so john is
[1:32:44] instructed don't just look at the book
[1:32:46] don't just talk about the book don't
[1:32:49] just talk about the message brother and
[1:32:51] sis don't just talk about the message
[1:32:52] become one with the message come under
[1:32:55] the message the messages Christ
[1:32:56] I mean don't just say yo yo cuz he says
[1:32:59] in the token message brother BAM I
[1:33:01] believe every word you say he says
[1:33:02] that's good but that's just being able
[1:33:04] to read races you must receive the token
[1:33:08] the whole ego
[1:33:08] Raisa just intellectually saying yes
[1:33:11] it's true and that's not enough
[1:33:13] it's got to be revealed in here and
[1:33:15] become a living reality
[1:33:16] amen amen
[1:33:19] so now he was taking take that book and
[1:33:21] eat that book become one with that book
[1:33:24] so now that's why we must become one
[1:33:28] with this word today because after John
[1:33:31] ate the book you don't see the book
[1:33:33] anymore you just see John Amen with
[1:33:36] their book goats in me hallelujah
[1:33:39] just like the you say the children of
[1:33:41] Israel there the law should have been
[1:33:43] embodied in everyday life that you
[1:33:46] wouldn't need to read the read the
[1:33:47] scrolls of Moses you can just see the
[1:33:49] life they lived if they really became
[1:33:52] one with that word then life became the
[1:33:54] manifestation of that word amen you
[1:33:58] people say like like what does this mean
[1:34:00] in the law well let's just go look at
[1:34:02] that guy's life we'll be able to work
[1:34:03] out what it means because their life is
[1:34:05] the interpretation of what the word
[1:34:07] should be right and it's the same thing
[1:34:09] with us now what is this message let's
[1:34:12] have a look let's look at some people
[1:34:16] amen because the life of the believer
[1:34:18] should be should be the interpretation
[1:34:21] of the word because we're living
[1:34:22] epistles read and known of all men
[1:34:25] amen now we're gonna we're gonna begin
[1:34:33] to take a bit of a turn on this oops he
[1:34:39] just sees he revelations chapter four he
[1:34:42] sees what John represent John represent
[1:34:44] an entire church that was taken up I
[1:34:46] told you one person here in a vision can
[1:34:48] represent the entire body of Christ and
[1:34:50] then and then and then and then in the
[1:34:52] same message I would notice John being
[1:34:54] taken up immediately after the church
[1:34:56] age was the type of the raptured Church
[1:34:58] immediately after the church ages over
[1:35:00] this lady accenture chage then comes the
[1:35:02] rapture right I just want this I just
[1:35:06] want the book of Revelation to become
[1:35:07] more personal and then you see when the
[1:35:10] angel comes to John and says come and
[1:35:11] see and come and see this and I saw this
[1:35:13] and I saw this you go to the message in
[1:35:15] brother band talks about future home it
[1:35:17] comes about souls under the altar he
[1:35:19] talks about the seals so all those
[1:35:20] things he's told to come and see
[1:35:21] the message shows you what those things
[1:35:23] are amen
[1:35:26] that's why it's more than doctrine God
[1:35:28] wants us to see who we are he wants to
[1:35:30] see he wants you to see who he is right
[1:35:33] this message is a personal message don't
[1:35:37] let the devil ever allow causes to
[1:35:40] become common - you should be fresh now
[1:35:43] you say what's this got to do with hair
[1:35:45] guy we're we're there where they are
[1:35:48] told be strong all you people of the
[1:35:51] land side the Lord and work for I am
[1:35:53] with you say at the Lord of Hosts
[1:35:55] according to the word which I coveted
[1:35:57] with you when you came out of Egypt so
[1:35:59] my spirit remaineth among you fear ye
[1:36:02] not so he's told be strong and work ok
[1:36:06] if you do not see the Engel and in mind
[1:36:09] for anything you will lose heart and
[1:36:11] what you're doing you know it's just
[1:36:13] like those who are you know you know you
[1:36:15] take any sportsman if they do not see
[1:36:17] the prize that they can obtain they will
[1:36:20] lose motivation in their training right
[1:36:24] just any project at work at home
[1:36:26] wherever maybe if you do not see the in
[1:36:28] goal you will lose motivation and that's
[1:36:32] and that's what the devil wants us to do
[1:36:34] he wants us to lose sight one day it'll
[1:36:38] happen well you been no today could be
[1:36:41] the day he could take me away now he's
[1:36:45] come for many the Lord has come from any
[1:36:48] in our generation Amen he could come for
[1:36:51] you before the service is over right so
[1:36:54] we should be looking like it could be
[1:36:55] today amen and we shouldn't be worried
[1:36:59] about it we should be say thank you Lord
[1:37:00] if it's today I'm ready
[1:37:02] you've made me ready I'm waiting you
[1:37:04] know really at the end of the day when
[1:37:07] they did in Christ rise we should say
[1:37:08] I've been expecting you I've been
[1:37:11] expecting you Amen then we take it up to
[1:37:13] meet the Lord in the air we could say
[1:37:14] I've been expecting you hallelujah it
[1:37:18] should be that way shouldn't us we've
[1:37:19] been expecting him catches waiting
[1:37:22] bright away now we just got to take a
[1:37:26] big turn in this in this in this sermon
[1:37:30] because you think I haven't been talking
[1:37:32] about theory because of you asked
[1:37:35] if you've been awakened you got to
[1:37:37] realize you've got to work to do right
[1:37:40] you've got to work to do
[1:37:41] not just evangelize in the world
[1:37:43] evangelism starts at home
[1:37:45] right it starts in your four walls of
[1:37:47] where you live and it starts also in
[1:37:50] here because you're responsible not just
[1:37:53] you know you're responsible to God but
[1:37:56] you're also responsible to yourself
[1:37:57] because we want to be yielded vessels to
[1:38:00] him right we want to be available
[1:38:03] I mean when we just sit there say Lord
[1:38:05] whenever you want to use me Here I am
[1:38:07] and it could be driving it could be at
[1:38:09] the supermarket could be at home it
[1:38:10] could be on my job Lord whenever you
[1:38:12] want to use me I'm available I don't
[1:38:15] have to get ready I'm ready right we
[1:38:17] want to be ready okay so if we have that
[1:38:20] in mind then we will not go like the
[1:38:23] lady I see in church age that's lukewarm
[1:38:25] and different you know not excited you
[1:38:28] know not not motivated you know we will
[1:38:31] not be like that but we'll be on fire
[1:38:32] now how that fire manifest is different
[1:38:35] to each one right some people are very
[1:38:37] exuberant some people are very quiet
[1:38:39] that is not that does not show how
[1:38:42] people are on the inside so your watch a
[1:38:45] deep core through the deep is a man
[1:38:46] saying before brother branham and the in
[1:38:48] the discernment line he's just standing
[1:38:50] there like this and the Prophet talks
[1:38:54] him says I can see you're a little bit
[1:38:55] excited I can see you're excited sorry
[1:38:57] that's just him he's not shouting he's
[1:39:00] not jumping he's just standing there
[1:39:02] she can't always take how people
[1:39:05] manifest to be how they really feel
[1:39:07] right we're all built differently God is
[1:39:11] a God of variety praise the Lord
[1:39:13] he's not a cookiecutter doesn't make us
[1:39:15] all the same I mean but but if we really
[1:39:17] if we're really convinced and then
[1:39:20] concerned if we're convinced this is the
[1:39:22] coming of the Lord then we'll be
[1:39:24] concerned not only for our people on the
[1:39:26] street will be concerned for ourselves
[1:39:27] and concern for our family right so that
[1:39:30] gives us motivation now we're going to
[1:39:32] work because God gives us the tools I
[1:39:34] mean to liver overcoming life he doesn't
[1:39:37] force us through a pipe and cause us to
[1:39:39] overcome we have to overcome he enables
[1:39:42] you to overcome just like God told Moses
[1:39:44] children of Israel I give you the land
[1:39:46] the land is yours
[1:39:47] you must go fight so they had to go
[1:39:49] fight for every promise then you go
[1:39:51] fight for every city but God had already
[1:39:53] give it to them right that's the same
[1:39:55] thing with us so that but this this
[1:39:57] world doesn't want us to be motivated
[1:39:59] you know with the things of the Lord or
[1:40:01] really anything just just float by keep
[1:40:03] with the status quo
[1:40:04] there's brother Armand summed up this
[1:40:06] country very well as a sheep paddock
[1:40:08] with some fences and this sheep it's
[1:40:12] flat it's grass
[1:40:13] that's this country it's all the same
[1:40:17] keep it all the same don't don't be too
[1:40:19] different tall poppy syndrome someone
[1:40:21] rise up a little bit different they get
[1:40:22] cut down jealousy listen this is this
[1:40:26] country we have to fight that spirit we
[1:40:29] cannot let that enter and you know if
[1:40:31] we're born again we're not under that
[1:40:33] spirit amen and now but our minds many
[1:40:36] times and our way we look at things it's
[1:40:38] got to be retrained we have to look at
[1:40:41] the things according to who we are not
[1:40:43] our situation okay so this country maybe
[1:40:48] in a sheep field but I'm an eagle in the
[1:40:50] sky
[1:40:51] hallelujah I worship as well but I'm an
[1:40:54] eagle I mean but you know we shouldn't
[1:40:56] just let's not live according to this
[1:40:59] New Zealand culture this New Zealand
[1:41:02] spirit she'll be right know if God said
[1:41:05] so I'm gonna press the mark of the high
[1:41:06] calling the Apostle Paul never said
[1:41:09] she'll be right I mean just just just
[1:41:12] you know what a press in the kingdom of
[1:41:15] God the violent take it by force and
[1:41:18] it's not someone with a sort but the
[1:41:19] vile the ones you press in they mean hey
[1:41:22] if the promise is mine it's mine you've
[1:41:25] seen people you go you know it's like
[1:41:28] that what the Black Friday sales and you
[1:41:30] know you're the big discount sales
[1:41:32] people fight yeah it's like one TV and
[1:41:36] people are fighting in the shop just to
[1:41:38] get that TV have you ever seen that kind
[1:41:40] of thing because they want it it's on
[1:41:43] it's on special I want this it must be
[1:41:45] mine and they will literally push
[1:41:48] everyone out of the way that they get it
[1:41:50] now that's just a that's just a TV or or
[1:41:53] whatever it's gonna burn but if people
[1:41:57] are so jealous over something they
[1:41:58] believe is this how much more the
[1:42:01] Bride of Christ with the promise of God
[1:42:04] it's mine
[1:42:05] push every devil out of the way this
[1:42:07] belongs to me right man that's how we
[1:42:11] should be so should give us motivation
[1:42:12] let's work let's build they had to
[1:42:15] rebuild the city and at 70 years it was
[1:42:17] Branton ashes and rubble and whatever
[1:42:20] more they had to go through all the
[1:42:21] rubbish they had to get the stones they
[1:42:24] had to rebuild have you ever seen a
[1:42:26] ruined city that's a little be a lot of
[1:42:29] work be a lot of work to rebuild but
[1:42:31] they but some of them were motivated
[1:42:33] God's given us a promise we're gonna
[1:42:37] worship God according we're gonna
[1:42:38] rebuild this temple we're gonna offer
[1:42:40] sacrifices we're gonna build walls we're
[1:42:43] gonna have a city again God's going to
[1:42:44] dwell among us that was the motivation
[1:42:46] and should be the same thing with us God
[1:42:49] has restored his word I mean his
[1:42:51] presence is among us hallelujah he's
[1:42:53] caught he can have living stones he does
[1:42:55] lively stones he's going to take those
[1:42:57] stones place them into his body
[1:42:59] hallelujah that once we were bunch of
[1:43:02] rubbish on the ground Brandon charred
[1:43:03] and broken he'll pick us up and restore
[1:43:06] us and wash us molars and put a sir put
[1:43:08] us into the building where we should be
[1:43:11] amen now proverbs 20:4 I went by the
[1:43:17] field of the slothful and by the
[1:43:19] vineyard of the man void of
[1:43:21] understanding and lo it was all grown
[1:43:25] over with thorns and needles had covered
[1:43:27] the face thereof and the stone wall
[1:43:29] there always broken down then I saw and
[1:43:31] considered it well I looked upon it and
[1:43:33] received instruction now I'm not just
[1:43:39] when I read this I'm not just talking
[1:43:42] about a natural farmer but he's
[1:43:45] receiving instruction this means this
[1:43:48] means I say this means mind this man
[1:43:52] spirit realm is broken down full of full
[1:43:57] of wheats
[1:43:58] thorns and there's no wall of protection
[1:44:01] this is there's actually someone's mind
[1:44:03] this is how some people are they have no
[1:44:06] wall of protection around their mind
[1:44:07] that's why I see it on Wednesday you've
[1:44:09] got to capture take your thoughts
[1:44:10] captive you've got a you're responsible
[1:44:14] for this
[1:44:14] you are responsible for what goes in
[1:44:16] this and how much it's entertained or
[1:44:19] what's thrown out you're responsible for
[1:44:21] your thoughts God doesn't make us robots
[1:44:24] where we just all automated you know
[1:44:26] nature runs by instinct but we have a
[1:44:28] free moral will right and God gives it
[1:44:31] to you and he entrusts it to you and
[1:44:34] he's saying what are you gonna do with
[1:44:35] this now first tip is you've got to give
[1:44:37] that will over to him right but what are
[1:44:40] you doing what are you feeding upon
[1:44:42] every day
[1:44:42] are you building up a wall of defense
[1:44:44] which you should be the Word of God in
[1:44:46] your heart right are you getting rid of
[1:44:49] the thorns and the you know many times
[1:44:51] we think people who are negative they're
[1:44:53] full of negative thoughts or pessimistic
[1:44:55] you know they're full of pessimism
[1:44:57] different ways because they're thinking
[1:44:59] in a certain way I say that's a bunch of
[1:45:01] thorns that's a bunch of needles it's
[1:45:04] got to be a Brigitte it's got to be
[1:45:06] taken out this is someone a man void of
[1:45:09] understanding because a man of
[1:45:11] understanding doesn't want weeds growing
[1:45:13] in his garden ears want weeds growing in
[1:45:15] his vineyard or in his field he wants it
[1:45:18] all taken out you know the Song of
[1:45:20] Solomon the bride ceaseless bride see
[1:45:22] it's coming to thy garden speaking about
[1:45:26] herself
[1:45:26] there's no just talking about a natural
[1:45:28] garden talk about her talking about you
[1:45:30] and I we're a garden we're a field right
[1:45:34] and so now we should never let this be
[1:45:38] us because we should be a people of
[1:45:40] understanding isn't the bride a people
[1:45:43] of understanding we know who he is we
[1:45:46] know who we are we know what he's done
[1:45:48] for us we know where we're going we know
[1:45:50] where we came from we know who the devil
[1:45:52] is we know how he works we know as
[1:45:53] tactics and then we should not be
[1:45:55] ignorant to his devices so that's the
[1:45:58] case now we shouldn't be like this
[1:46:01] we got to be responsible you know what
[1:46:03] are we what are we paying what are we
[1:46:06] paying attention to well I'm just gonna
[1:46:09] scroll through a few things and then and
[1:46:11] then and then that gets lodged in there
[1:46:13] and you've got to get the whole and you
[1:46:15] got to rub it out and you've got to
[1:46:17] spray some stuff and why don't you just
[1:46:20] scroll through the Bible
[1:46:22] scroll through the Bible instead scroll
[1:46:25] through the message instead what are you
[1:46:28] putting in here because what you put in
[1:46:30] here will it'll change how you think
[1:46:32] it'll change how you treat your treat
[1:46:34] each other you see these people who
[1:46:36] become mass shooters and whatever more
[1:46:39] they never started off that way mass
[1:46:42] murderers and things they never started
[1:46:43] off that way
[1:46:44] they were like anyone else sure they had
[1:46:46] their temperament and their and you know
[1:46:48] certain things happening but they didn't
[1:46:50] they were not born to be a mass shooter
[1:46:53] but as what they lived in here and it
[1:46:56] grew and it took over and then they
[1:46:58] began killing people amen but we came
[1:47:03] for what we what we do and the problem
[1:47:05] is in this age was quite any age with
[1:47:07] mainly this age you know children's
[1:47:10] brains are still growing even into their
[1:47:13] early 20s the brain is still developing
[1:47:15] and then but the world has put
[1:47:19] everything in front of us and
[1:47:21] emotionally children cannot handle what
[1:47:24] they see they can't handle it and that
[1:47:30] and that's a problem if you're being
[1:47:33] given stuff the emotionally cannot
[1:47:34] handle I just want you to think about
[1:47:37] these things because what are we what
[1:47:38] are what are we putting in the garden
[1:47:40] because we're responsible for them too I
[1:47:44] mean just think about it now
[1:47:46] Ecclesiastes 1018 by much slothfulness
[1:47:48] the building decayeth and through
[1:47:51] idleness of the hands the house droppeth
[1:47:54] through and then in proverbs 25 28 he
[1:47:58] that hath no rule over his own spirit is
[1:48:00] like a city that is broken down and
[1:48:03] without walls just like the man's
[1:48:05] vineyard the wall was broken down so if
[1:48:07] you have no rule over your own spirit
[1:48:09] Amen it's like you have no defense
[1:48:11] anything can just come in raid go away
[1:48:15] or set up camp or whatever because you
[1:48:16] got no rule over your own spirit
[1:48:18] remember it takes a strong man to be in
[1:48:21] the house because of the strong man's in
[1:48:23] the house of the God himself is in the
[1:48:25] house nothing else is stronger than him
[1:48:27] right and he takes dominion where he is
[1:48:30] given room he takes over I mean but you
[1:48:33] got to let him take over
[1:48:34] he will take as much as you'll give him
[1:48:36] Simon the Pharisee invited him to a
[1:48:38] feast
[1:48:39] he was unwashed feet and welcome but yet
[1:48:41] he was there because Simon gave him that
[1:48:44] much how much of your life are you
[1:48:46] giving him he giving him just a little
[1:48:49] bit on the corner are we giving him the
[1:48:50] chief chief seat at the feast as he
[1:48:54] number one or Z number something else
[1:48:57] you gotta think about it now he the
[1:49:02] slothful slothfulness the building decay
[1:49:05] ahthe are honest of the hands the house
[1:49:07] drop us through it's like a relationship
[1:49:10] you got to work at it yeah amen if you
[1:49:13] don't work at a relationship it will
[1:49:15] collapse like this buildings it will
[1:49:17] drop through amen
[1:49:20] it's like how's your prayer life how's
[1:49:23] your prayer yeah you know brother Brahim
[1:49:24] seed gives us how do you get closer to
[1:49:26] God read your Bible and pray what are
[1:49:29] the two hardest things to do every day
[1:49:30] read your Bible and pray why is that
[1:49:34] because the devil was sitting in the
[1:49:37] congregation taking probably better
[1:49:38] notes than everyone else and when he
[1:49:41] heard that he's okay I've got to work on
[1:49:43] this and then we have this world we have
[1:49:46] everything and what does it do it just
[1:49:48] robs us of our prayer life I'm not
[1:49:51] talking about length of time don't make
[1:49:52] it a religion but the quality of prayer
[1:49:55] amen we don't have to spend five hours
[1:49:57] to get into the spirit we just get in
[1:49:59] the spirit you just be talking to them
[1:50:01] driving along and have a glorious time
[1:50:02] we're gonna be it you know sometimes
[1:50:05] I've been at work I've been there
[1:50:06] working in the lab it feels like
[1:50:08] Heaven's just gonna I'm gonna leave I'm
[1:50:11] just thinking about him amen and then he
[1:50:14] begins to speak to me hallelujah so
[1:50:17] how's your prayer life you say well I
[1:50:19] don't know how to pray it's just like
[1:50:20] any relationship user hello how are you
[1:50:23] it's that small talk from your heart you
[1:50:28] don't need some big flowery words talk
[1:50:30] from your heart God wants people who are
[1:50:31] real he doesn't want something that's
[1:50:34] all polished up and washed up and
[1:50:36] looking all great he just wants you to
[1:50:38] be real I want you to be honest
[1:50:41] amen and then from there things can grow
[1:50:46] so I want to ask you
[1:50:48] i I just want to leave you with that
[1:50:50] thought this has happened wait so now
[1:50:55] let's just read this this is speak this
[1:50:58] is from influence again as well speaking
[1:51:00] of Uzziah I believe now when you're
[1:51:04] corrected by the word you must be
[1:51:06] subject to the word and he said he would
[1:51:08] do as he pleased this is when he went
[1:51:10] into the temple tried to be a priest
[1:51:12] when he was a king a CD of do as he
[1:51:14] pleased he was the head of the thing he
[1:51:17] just do what he wanted and you know what
[1:51:19] happened he was spent with leprosy and
[1:51:21] while his anger rage was upon him the
[1:51:24] priests detected the leprosy in his face
[1:51:27] now you say well what do you mean
[1:51:29] leprosy represents as a type rather of
[1:51:32] sin and when a man won't stand
[1:51:34] correction by the word of God he's full
[1:51:36] of leprosy blows up and carries on what
[1:51:39] does you do what do you do you ruin your
[1:51:41] influency something happens people knows
[1:51:44] it and can tell the word that you're
[1:51:46] corrected by that you're not going to do
[1:51:49] it therefore you ruin your influence now
[1:51:51] this is a man whose vineyard has been
[1:51:53] full of weeds and everything pride comes
[1:51:55] in and that's the biggest thing you look
[1:51:57] in the Bible you look at the Kings the
[1:52:00] biggest danger God blesses them and they
[1:52:02] come to a junction in their in their
[1:52:04] reign are they gonna stay humble or are
[1:52:08] they gonna think well I can just do
[1:52:09] anything and you and you look at them
[1:52:12] you go through seeking Kings you see the
[1:52:14] godly Kings 99% of the time God blesses
[1:52:17] it because they because they cast out
[1:52:19] the idol say you're repair the house of
[1:52:21] God all these things God blesses them
[1:52:24] they begin to have victories over their
[1:52:25] enemies then they get lifted up and
[1:52:27] pride they're not walking humbly with
[1:52:29] their God anymore because they think now
[1:52:31] they can just do anything and there's
[1:52:33] such a danger right as I read as I read
[1:52:37] very early on I said yo we see
[1:52:39] revelations 10 manifesting among us
[1:52:41] materializing among us we should be so
[1:52:43] sincere right because we're not waiting
[1:52:45] for it to come a Dorian motion and it
[1:52:50] hurts this fellow anger got on him and
[1:52:52] while he was in his anger leprosy was in
[1:52:55] his face and we find out that not only
[1:52:57] did he drop the sense that he ran from
[1:52:59] the house of God never be able to return
[1:53:01] because no matter how great he was how
[1:53:04] much influence he had when he was
[1:53:06] corrected then he refused to take his
[1:53:08] correction because his social standing
[1:53:11] had become more to him than the Word of
[1:53:13] God had become okay what of God had
[1:53:19] become I'm sure you understand what I'm
[1:53:22] driving at see have become more to him
[1:53:24] his position as King became more to him
[1:53:27] than the Word of God that's why we have
[1:53:33] to remain sincere we're not when we talk
[1:53:35] about these things
[1:53:36] you know this is precious God as God and
[1:53:40] His mercy would awaken you when maybe
[1:53:44] the person next to you maybe your
[1:53:46] childhood friend
[1:53:47] he hasn't become awakened well she
[1:53:49] hasn't become working their life has
[1:53:50] gone on a different road and your life
[1:53:52] has gone down this road with God and you
[1:53:56] may have been exactly the same
[1:53:57] neighborhood same everything but then
[1:53:59] God awakened you didn't awake them yet
[1:54:02] well why is that God's grace God doesn't
[1:54:07] ask anything do you know if he'd never
[1:54:10] if he never blesses us one more time if
[1:54:12] he never answers another prayer if he
[1:54:14] never moves again he's already done more
[1:54:15] than enough amen and we must never
[1:54:19] forget that he doesn't owe us a single
[1:54:22] thing we worship Him not because of how
[1:54:26] good life may be we worship Him because
[1:54:29] He is God and he made all things and he
[1:54:33] is our Redeemer we do not worship Him
[1:54:35] based on our circumstance we worship Him
[1:54:37] because of who he is we must never
[1:54:39] forget that we must be sincere because
[1:54:44] we've got we've got the greatest thing
[1:54:46] in the world the greatest treasure of
[1:54:48] heaviness Christ among us why do we want
[1:54:50] a substitute of some little influence to
[1:54:53] try and make ourselves somebody big
[1:54:55] among somebody here why not be a humble
[1:54:58] servant to Christ we have the greatest
[1:55:02] treasure and when I heard that I
[1:55:03] listened to the sermon it gripped me and
[1:55:06] when he said that we have the greatest
[1:55:08] treasure Christ among us
[1:55:11] amen I want to leave it there friends
[1:55:17] this just bow head shall we I just want
[1:55:22] to ask you a question if you've got all
[1:55:25] indifferent and hard cold why don't you
[1:55:29] just raise your hand
[1:55:31] gracious father Lord you see these hands
[1:55:35] all over the building
[1:55:36] I just pray father your Lord we would
[1:55:39] ponder these things Lord may we not be
[1:55:42] just a a hearer of the wood but may we
[1:55:44] be a doer father you owe us nothing Lord
