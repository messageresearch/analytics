[52:52] to me about you know when we traveling
[52:55] brother Burley over here we only have so
[52:58] much room we have to check a bag and and
[53:01] it can only weigh so much so and we got

[53:08] can only pack so much but isn't it a
[53:11] beautiful thing this morning that
[53:13] there's no weight limit with God but no
[53:15] matter how full you are right now
[53:17] there's still a little bit more room God
[53:19] can pour out some more blessings this
[53:21] morning God can give you some more joy

[54:17] hero and uh letting you know and that
[54:20] that you can overcome and that you can
[54:22] press through it and and I appreciate a
[54:24] real soul that'll stay with this message
[54:27] and amen we're just so thankful this
[54:29] morning if you have your Bibles and you
[54:31] could turn with us to the Book of
[54:33] Joshua I got a a few
[54:36] readings um but they're not long and you
[54:40] can be seated after that and uh we just
[54:43] want to take a little thought this
[54:44] morning out of
[54:46] Joshua um about stepping into the
[54:50] commission stepping into the commission
[54:52] and then uh we're going to uh take a
[54:56] couple scriptures here but Joshua 1
[54:58] veres
[55:00] 1-9 a familiar passage and uh we could
[55:04] probably all all know it but we'll just
[55:08] refresh your
[55:09] memory after the death of Moses the
[55:12] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[55:14] the Lord spake onto Joshua the son of
[55:16] nun Moses Minister saying Moses my
[55:19] servant is dead now therefore arise and
[55:22] go over this Jordan thou and all this
[55:24] people under the land which I do give to
[55:26] them even to the children of Israel and
[55:29] every place that the soul of your foot
[55:31] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[55:33] you as I said unto Moses from the
[55:36] Wilderness and this Lebanon even onto
[55:38] the Great River the river Euphrates all
[55:40] the land of the Hittites under the great
[55:43] sea toward the going down of the sun
[55:45] shall be your Coast there shall not any
[55:48] man be able to stand before thee all the
[55:50] days of thy life but as I was with Moses
[55:53] so I will be with thee I will not fail
[55:56] thee nor forsake thee so be strong and
[55:59] of a good courage For unto this people
[56:02] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[56:03] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[56:05] give them only be thou strong and very
[56:08] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[56:10] do according to all the law which Moses
[56:12] my servant commanded thee turn not from
[56:15] from it to the right hand or to the left
[56:18] that thou mayest Prosper withs soever
[56:21] thou goest and this book of the law
[56:23] shall not depart out of thy mouth amen
[56:26] didn't say out of thy hands it says out
[56:28] of thy mouth it shall not depart but
[56:31] Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[56:33] night that thou mayest observe to do
[56:35] according to all that is written therein
[56:37] for then shalt thou make thy way
[56:39] prosperous and then shalt thou have good
[56:41] success have not I commanded thee be
[56:44] strong and of a good courage Be not
[56:45] Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[56:47] Lord thy God is with thee withs soever
[56:49] thou
[56:50] goest and you don't have to turn there
[56:52] I'm just going to read a couple quick
[56:54] scriptures out of Judges 6 and 14 it
[56:57] says and the Lord looked upon him and
[57:00] said go in this thy might and thou shalt
[57:02] save Israel from the hand of the
[57:04] midianites have not I sent thee amen
[57:07] here's another excerpt where the Lord
[57:10] speaking to to Gideon have not I sent
[57:13] thee and and we just want to keep that
[57:15] in mind as we as we go through this
[57:17] thought and uh also in Psalms 42: 6-7
[57:21] you don't have to turn there but very
[57:23] familiar it says oh my God my soul is
[57:25] cast down Within Me therefore will I
[57:27] remember thee from the land of Jordan
[57:29] and of the hermit from the hill Mazar
[57:31] deep calleth unto deep at the noise of
[57:34] thy water spouts all thy waves and thy
[57:37] Billows are gone over me amen so we want
[57:40] to take a thought from that step into
[57:41] the commission it's for you and anden
[57:45] let's bow our heads for a word of
[57:47] prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[57:49] for your grace father and an opportunity
[57:52] to Lord that you saw fit to give us
[57:55] another day to serve you Lord and you
[57:57] saw fit to gather us together in this
[57:59] place and Lord we don't believe it was
[58:01] an accident but we believe you arranged
[58:03] it father even before the foundation of
[58:06] the world Lord and Satan can't
[58:08] understand that father he can't
[58:10] understand that you can pre-arrange
[58:12] something father he can't understand the
[58:14] supernatural but father as your sons and
[58:16] daughters Lord we understand that you're
[58:18] a supernatural God and you've arranged
[58:21] moments father moments of Deliverance
[58:23] and moments of victory and father we
[58:25] believe we're living in a a pre-arranged
[58:27] moment this weekend father where you're
[58:29] coming down and touching hearts and
[58:31] you're touching lives and turning
[58:33] situations around and father we give you
[58:35] the glory for that for we know it's no
[58:37] man that could do it father but it's
[58:39] only you and we invite you to come in
[58:41] this service once more this morning
[58:43] Father that you take over the hearer and
[58:46] the speaker once more Lord and you just
[58:48] go down the aisles and go down the pews
[58:50] and just Lord minister to the hearts and
[58:52] needs of your people father Lord that my
[58:55] prayer this morning of that if there's
[58:57] one here father that feels like maybe
[58:59] they've missed an opportunity Lord that
[59:01] that feels like maybe that they're still
[59:03] under a burden father that Lord they
[59:05] don't want to go home the same they
[59:06] don't want to take it home father and
[59:08] Lord I've got no power of myself to take
[59:11] it from them but Lord you have the power
[59:13] father your word Lord has the authority
[59:16] to cast it off and father we come on the
[59:18] basis of your word Lord that Lord every
[59:21] son and daughter of God would be able to
[59:22] leave here free this morning amen we
[59:25] believe it and we thank you for it and
[59:27] we'll be sure to give you the glory in
[59:28] Jesus name amen you may have your seats
[59:32] this morning for a few moments and we
[59:34] want to take this thought on stepping
[59:36] into the commission and and and Joshua
[59:39] of course is a prime example of that
[59:42] because Joshua was following Moses
[59:45] Joshua wasn't the Forerunner Moses foran
[59:49] but Joshua was stepping into those
[59:51] tracks and uh uh you know I would say
[59:54] they were big shoes to feel for Joshua
[59:56] because Moses had the Lord had went with
[59:59] Moses the Lord had protected them the
[1:00:01] Lord had led him through battles and
[1:00:03] victories and great things and Joshua
[1:00:05] saw that and here he was now Moses is
[1:00:08] gone Moses my servant is dead and said
[1:00:11] what are you going to do Joshua you're
[1:00:12] going to have to step into those same
[1:00:14] tracks that Moses stood in and brother
[1:00:17] brandham said uh now only two left now
[1:00:20] that ever left the promised land Joshua
[1:00:22] and Caleb now Joshua the new Comm or to
[1:00:25] lead an army to step into the place
[1:00:27] where a great man like Moses stood it
[1:00:29] was no little task he said I think of a
[1:00:32] minister today that's called of God to
[1:00:34] step into the tracks where Jesus stood
[1:00:36] what a command what a commission but now
[1:00:40] he brings it down not just to the
[1:00:41] ministry but he says each that's called
[1:00:43] of God is commissioned to stand in that
[1:00:45] same place I'll be with you even in you
[1:00:48] to the end of the way amen so you're
[1:00:50] stepping into more than the pastor's
[1:00:52] tracks you're stepping into more than
[1:00:54] Mom and Dad's tracks but you're stepping
[1:00:57] into the very tracks that Jesus stood in
[1:01:00] and you're stepping into those shoes to
[1:01:02] stand under that same commission and
[1:01:04] live a life and live a holy life and
[1:01:06] live an overcoming life and operate
[1:01:09] under the commission that God's called
[1:01:11] us to amen it looked like he could have
[1:01:13] sent someone else you know there's been
[1:01:16] some some prophets Through the Ages that
[1:01:18] I'm I'm sure felt like they weren't fit
[1:01:20] for the job and it looked like God could
[1:01:23] have sent someone else you you know it
[1:01:24] looked like God uh Jonah would be a
[1:01:27] great example where it looked like God
[1:01:29] could have sent someone else uh and here
[1:01:31] God God God so pre-arranged it that he
[1:01:34] would send them in the the belly of a
[1:01:35] fish and he was sending them to a people
[1:01:37] who served a fish God and and it would
[1:01:40] God operates in such a Perfection and it
[1:01:42] looked like maybe there could have been
[1:01:44] a stronger man or a more a more military
[1:01:47] man that God could have sent but Jonah
[1:01:49] was the one ordained for the job and and
[1:01:51] if God's ordained you for the job that
[1:01:53] no one can take your place place no no
[1:01:55] one your neighbor can't take your place
[1:01:57] but God has commissioned you to step
[1:01:59] into that spot and only you can feel
[1:02:01] those shoes they've been molded to you
[1:02:04] they've been custom designed to you only
[1:02:06] you can step into those shoes amen and
[1:02:09] it's a powerful thing and it's also a a
[1:02:12] sobering thing and say Lord how am I
[1:02:14] going to do it but the beautiful thing
[1:02:17] is that he's not leaving it up to our
[1:02:19] ability but but when he spoke to Moses
[1:02:21] when God sent Moses he said Moses in the
[1:02:24] book of Exodus I'm come down to deliver
[1:02:26] them out of the hand of the
[1:02:28] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[1:02:30] that land onto a good land in a large
[1:02:33] onto a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:02:35] onto the place of the Canaanites and the
[1:02:36] Hittites and the amorites and the
[1:02:38] perizzites and the hivites and the
[1:02:41] jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry
[1:02:43] of the children of Israel has come unto
[1:02:45] me and I have also seen the oppression
[1:02:48] wherein the Egyptians oppressed thee now
[1:02:51] at this point Moses is probably feeling
[1:02:53] pretty good he says well praise the Lord
[1:02:56] uh our people are going to be delivered
[1:02:58] uh the Lord's come down he's heard their
[1:03:00] Cry he's going to set them free at this
[1:03:02] point Moses is charged up he said this
[1:03:04] is this is going to be a miraculous
[1:03:06] thing we're going to stand here and
[1:03:07] witness great Deliverance to our great
[1:03:09] nation but then he says come now
[1:03:11] therefore Moses I'm going to send you
[1:03:13] onto Pharaoh he's like oh hold on that's
[1:03:16] a little different I I knew that there
[1:03:18] was prophecy that our people would be
[1:03:20] delivered I knew that it was coming and
[1:03:22] and you just told me how you're going to
[1:03:24] do it but you're sending me to do it how
[1:03:26] how could I ever do that how could I
[1:03:28] ever step into that commission how could
[1:03:30] I ever do anything to deliver these
[1:03:32] people but he said Moses I'm coming down
[1:03:35] but I'm sending you amen and Moses tried
[1:03:38] it one time in his own ability and it
[1:03:40] felled he fell flat on his face but one
[1:03:43] time he tried it and God was with him
[1:03:45] and brother it was a oneman army
[1:03:47] Invasion that went down and took over
[1:03:49] the land of Egypt because God was with
[1:03:51] them because he stepped into his
[1:03:53] Commission according to the word of the
[1:03:55] Lord amen and it was a great thing it
[1:03:58] was a marvelous thing and when God gets
[1:04:01] ready to fulfill the word he sends he's
[1:04:04] sending you to fulfill it he needs
[1:04:06] somebody he he don't need ability but he
[1:04:09] does need some prisoners as our brother
[1:04:11] Burley spoke about last night he
[1:04:13] said when he sent Jesus he said Jesus in
[1:04:17] John 20:21 then said Jesus to them again
[1:04:20] peace be unto you as my father hath sent
[1:04:22] me even so send I you he said as the
[1:04:25] father has sent me so send I you and the
[1:04:27] father that sent him went with him and
[1:04:29] in him and when he sent when he sent us
[1:04:31] he went came with us and in us because
[1:04:35] God can only work through a perfect
[1:04:37] Channel and God is is looking to do a
[1:04:40] work in this hour God is looking to do a
[1:04:43] work in this age but he can only work
[1:04:45] through Perfection and so he couldn't
[1:04:47] send just anybody he couldn't just send
[1:04:50] just any church any denomination but he
[1:04:52] had to go and shed up perfect blood and
[1:04:55] put that perfect blood Upon A people and
[1:04:58] on the day of Pentecost he could send a
[1:05:00] power Upon A people that could receive
[1:05:03] an ability that he could operate through
[1:05:05] human beings because he's not operating
[1:05:07] through your stained flesh and through
[1:05:09] all your mistakes and all your
[1:05:10] shortcomings but he's put something on
[1:05:12] the inside of you brother and sister
[1:05:14] that he can operate through and he's
[1:05:16] operating through that channel and it's
[1:05:18] not your ability it's not your Humanity
[1:05:20] but it's the eternity that dwells inside
[1:05:22] of you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:24] that's quickened your soul and God says
[1:05:27] I can work through that because it's not
[1:05:29] going to be your hands it's going to be
[1:05:31] your hands but it's not going to be your
[1:05:33] ability it's going to be your feet but
[1:05:35] it's not going to be your ability it's
[1:05:36] going to be your voice but it's got
[1:05:38] nothing to do with your ability but the
[1:05:41] god that sent you has gone in you and
[1:05:43] put a Perfection inside of you that he
[1:05:45] can work through you so you can throw
[1:05:48] down all the thought of human ability
[1:05:50] this morning it has nothing to do with
[1:05:52] it but it's a perfect strength being
[1:05:54] established through perfect weakness
[1:05:56] that God can work through a perfect
[1:05:58] people amen and we're living in it but
[1:06:02] you must have leadership to walk right
[1:06:04] to walk with the Lord you must walk
[1:06:06] under a leadership and there was a rich
[1:06:08] young ruler one day and we've all know
[1:06:10] the story and brother he turned down the
[1:06:13] leadership of God for the leadership of
[1:06:16] church and brother brand said when he
[1:06:18] come to the end of when he come to the
[1:06:19] end of the road he begin to scream
[1:06:22] brother Burley told the powerful story
[1:06:23] last last night at that sister he said
[1:06:26] you know he belonged to church and
[1:06:27] everything he was raised right he knew
[1:06:29] all the rules but when he come to the
[1:06:31] end of the road he said there's nowhere
[1:06:32] to step where's his leadership he had
[1:06:35] been led by his church which is dead
[1:06:38] amen but one day there was a man named
[1:06:40] Moses and Moses didn't just take the
[1:06:42] leadership of a church and mean he
[1:06:44] didn't just take the leadership of
[1:06:45] pharaoh but he took the leadership of a
[1:06:47] pillar of fire he accepted the
[1:06:49] leadership of God and when he came to
[1:06:51] the end of his Road he looked and laying
[1:06:53] there by his side brother brandom said
[1:06:55] was his leader The Rock and he stepped
[1:06:58] out on the Rock and the angels of God
[1:07:00] packed him away into glory and because
[1:07:02] Moses accepted leadership but when
[1:07:05] brother B said his name will be great
[1:07:07] when there's no more Egypt or Treasures
[1:07:09] when the pyramids are dust and Egypt is
[1:07:11] no more Egypt Moses will be immortal
[1:07:13] among men because he accepted the
[1:07:15] leadership of Christ instead of going
[1:07:18] the way the church went he accepted true
[1:07:21] leadership and he's still he's still
[1:07:24] mortal amongst men God has God Has
[1:07:26] Lifted him up because he accepted the
[1:07:28] true leadership but every man of
[1:07:31] God is commissioned to walk under the
[1:07:34] leadership of this word every man of God
[1:07:36] is commissioned to stay with this word
[1:07:38] Every Woman every daughter of God is
[1:07:40] commissioned to stay with this word and
[1:07:42] stay with the leadership of this message
[1:07:43] and stay with the rhythm of this word no
[1:07:46] matter which way the Rhythm goes if it's
[1:07:48] in the up or it's in the down you know
[1:07:50] that it's just the rhythm of the word
[1:07:52] it's just the great Symphony being
[1:07:54] orchestrated and you're just walking in
[1:07:56] it you're just a part of it no matter if
[1:07:58] you're going through the deep valleys
[1:08:00] brother BR said all things work together
[1:08:01] for good to them that love God to them
[1:08:04] who are the called according to his
[1:08:05] purpose so what is it it's just a part
[1:08:07] of the Rhythm and you're just walking in
[1:08:10] the Rhythm in the leadership of the
[1:08:12] Lord amen the thing about this
[1:08:15] commission is we're not just
[1:08:16] commissioned uh to to lay our hands on
[1:08:19] the sick and they shall recover we're
[1:08:21] not just commissioned to cast out Devils
[1:08:23] although we are are but but many could
[1:08:25] do that and brother Brandon would say
[1:08:27] you know many will come Accord the Bible
[1:08:29] told us that many will come to me in
[1:08:31] this day and say Lord have not I
[1:08:32] preached in your name and prophesied
[1:08:35] have not I done these great things have
[1:08:36] not I cast Devils off in your name and
[1:08:38] they'll say depart from me you workers
[1:08:40] of iniquity I never even knew you why is
[1:08:43] that because that's not the only
[1:08:45] commission to just cast out devils and
[1:08:47] pray for the sick but you're
[1:08:48] commissioned to stay with the word
[1:08:50] you're commissioned to stay with this
[1:08:52] message and you could could do all those
[1:08:54] things and and be living any kind of
[1:08:56] Life Judas could do those things Judas
[1:08:58] was under that commission but the
[1:09:00] difference was Judas never went to
[1:09:01] Pentecost and got the Seal of his
[1:09:04] commission he never went and got his
[1:09:06] papers he never went and got the
[1:09:07] confirmation of the commission I me
[1:09:10] because any of us can aspire to be a
[1:09:12] great Soldier and go down brother
[1:09:14] Brandon would say to the 10- cent store
[1:09:16] and get a nice little outfit and get a
[1:09:18] soldier uniform or a policeman uniform
[1:09:21] and you can go and you can have all the
[1:09:23] outward appear but if you don't have
[1:09:24] your papers that you're sent that you've
[1:09:27] been commissioned then no one will
[1:09:28] believe you but you must have your
[1:09:30] papers you must have the Seal of your
[1:09:32] commission the disciples he said I've
[1:09:34] commissioned you to do this but before
[1:09:36] you go go up to Pentecost and receive
[1:09:38] the confirmation and these signs shall
[1:09:41] follow you and I'll be with you even in
[1:09:43] you but you must go to Pentecost first
[1:09:45] and receive the confirmation of the
[1:09:48] commission and you got no right to call
[1:09:50] yourself a preacher or even a Christian
[1:09:53] unless you first come on those sacred SS
[1:09:56] and receive the confirmation of your
[1:09:58] commission the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:01] amen and then it won't be the book of
[1:10:04] shakina fellowship and then it won't be
[1:10:06] the acts of brother Benner brother
[1:10:08] Burley but it will be the acts of the
[1:10:10] holy spirit inside of you writing
[1:10:12] another book of Acts writing another
[1:10:14] book of a of a people who have been
[1:10:16] sealed with this great Holy Ghost amen I
[1:10:19] think of that story uh where brother
[1:10:21] Brandon talks about the the wife walking
[1:10:23] in and the husband's reading the paper
[1:10:25] he said well is there anything new is
[1:10:27] there anything new on the news he said
[1:10:29] no it's just the same news only
[1:10:30] different people amen it's just the same
[1:10:33] depression only different only different
[1:10:35] people are doing it but the thing about
[1:10:37] it is brother if you get the same holy
[1:10:39] ghost that sell fell on the day of
[1:10:41] Pentecost I can look and say brother
[1:10:43] Burley uh what's the news looking like
[1:10:45] about the church today he said brother
[1:10:46] it's the same news that they had only
[1:10:48] it's through different people they're
[1:10:49] still Healing The Sick they're still
[1:10:51] casting out Devils they're still staying
[1:10:53] with my word only this time it's through
[1:10:55] a group of people that have rose up out
[1:10:57] of lead to se of Darkness now it's
[1:10:59] through brother Burley and brother B
[1:11:01] it's not through Paul and Peter anymore
[1:11:03] but it's through you and through me it's
[1:11:05] the same book being written another book
[1:11:07] of Acts written behind this church
[1:11:09] because oh youve received the same
[1:11:12] commission you've received the same holy
[1:11:14] spirit that they received and we're
[1:11:16] walking in it and we're living in it and
[1:11:18] we're in our
[1:11:20] commission amen but the question isn't
[1:11:22] if there's a
[1:11:24] commission but now we come down to where
[1:11:26] the rubber meets the road and the
[1:11:27] question is is it for me I know there's
[1:11:30] a commission I can read Mark 16 every
[1:11:33] day I I know but is it for me is it for
[1:11:37] me we know the days of Miracles aren't
[1:11:39] passed if if you study the message if
[1:11:41] you study the scriptures you know that
[1:11:43] the Great Commission is still in force
[1:11:45] today uh brother B said you know it was
[1:11:47] introduced on the day of Pentecost and
[1:11:49] it hasn't ceased and Pentecost begin
[1:11:51] without an ending we we know that
[1:11:52] there's still a commission for the
[1:11:54] church we're not just meant to sit here
[1:11:55] and and just have our feet up on the
[1:11:57] bench and doing nothing we know that
[1:11:59] there's still a commission that is not
[1:12:01] the question but it is if it's for you I
[1:12:04] mean you can say is the token for me is
[1:12:06] the commission for me and you can look
[1:12:08] at the Bible in Acts 2 and say the
[1:12:10] promise is onto you and to your children
[1:12:13] and and as many as the as a far off and
[1:12:15] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:12:17] and and you can look to the word for
[1:12:19] your answer and begin to build faith and
[1:12:21] you can find your identity in this word
[1:12:24] you don't have to look to any man I
[1:12:25] don't have to discern you you can look
[1:12:27] to this word and say this is my answer
[1:12:30] he said the promises are onto as many as
[1:12:33] the Lord Our God has called he said
[1:12:35] blessed are they which hunger and thirst
[1:12:36] after righteousness for they shall be
[1:12:38] filled and mean he didn't just leave you
[1:12:41] he already said you're blessed if you
[1:12:42] hunger he already said you're blessed if
[1:12:44] you thirst but he didn't just leave you
[1:12:46] there he said You shall be filled and so
[1:12:48] you can begin to draw strength from the
[1:12:50] word and say yeah maybe it is for me
[1:12:53] maybe it is for me after all maybe the
[1:12:54] Holy Ghost is for me me no matter how
[1:12:57] stooped you are in sin what you have
[1:12:58] done brother Brenham said that doesn't
[1:13:00] have one thing to do with it he said you
[1:13:03] apply the token it's for you if you feel
[1:13:05] in your heart there's something tugging
[1:13:07] it's for you you apply the token me you
[1:13:10] may have come in here this morning
[1:13:12] wondering even if you've sinned away
[1:13:13] your day of Grace maybe the devil's
[1:13:15] tried to put that in your mind that even
[1:13:17] you've sinned away the day of Grace but
[1:13:19] brother Brandon would say look do you
[1:13:20] have respect still for the Lord Jesus
[1:13:23] and if you do he said he hasn't left you
[1:13:25] he's still got Mercy for you and mean he
[1:13:27] would look and he said I see a real dark
[1:13:29] shadow following you too which is a
[1:13:31] devil he's almost tempted you to Suicide
[1:13:34] sometime telling that you had crossed
[1:13:36] the separating line that you wasn't
[1:13:37] never going to be saved is that right is
[1:13:39] that yes and then another another
[1:13:42] message he says Satan has desired to
[1:13:44] take your life he said you're all tore
[1:13:46] up you think you send away your day of
[1:13:48] Grace you think your life is ruined do
[1:13:50] you love Jesus what makes you love him
[1:13:53] yeah before there could be anything in
[1:13:54] there make you love him there has to be
[1:13:56] a Creator to create the love in your
[1:13:58] heart is that right if you send away
[1:14:00] your day of Grace you would hate Jesus
[1:14:02] but you love him and you're all right
[1:14:04] and the devil's just lying to you you're
[1:14:05] nervous come here and I'll cast him away
[1:14:08] from you if you'll believe do you
[1:14:09] believe it and he says almighty God be
[1:14:11] merciful to the boy he stands here and
[1:14:13] Satan is trying to get him in the
[1:14:15] condition to commit suicide but Thou Art
[1:14:18] here to relieve the boy and to make this
[1:14:20] evil spirit go and thou has said these
[1:14:22] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:14:23] my name they'll cast out Devils then act
[1:14:26] upon the authority of God's word as a
[1:14:28] Believer I now ask the spirit that's on
[1:14:30] the boy of unbelief to leave him go out
[1:14:32] of the in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:14:34] bother him no more and I set him free
[1:14:37] and may the enemy be bound and leave
[1:14:38] this room and torment no one else in
[1:14:40] Jesus Christ's name see what is it Satan
[1:14:43] is a liar and God's word is the truth
[1:14:46] and Satan is trying to get you in
[1:14:48] condition for suicide and Satan is
[1:14:50] trying to get you in condition for a
[1:14:52] hard life and Satan is trying to get you
[1:14:54] in condition for depression and fear but
[1:14:56] God sent us a word to get you in
[1:14:58] condition for who you were really meant
[1:14:59] to be God sent us a word and we stand
[1:15:02] here under a commission and take this
[1:15:04] word and speak it over your life and
[1:15:06] what are we doing we're getting you in
[1:15:08] the condition for Joy we're getting you
[1:15:10] in the condition for the promise we're
[1:15:12] getting you in the condition to say
[1:15:14] maybe it is for me maybe I can receive
[1:15:16] the Holy Ghost and we declare that word
[1:15:18] over your life it's for you it's for you
[1:15:21] it's for you and you can start
[1:15:23] confessing it is for me what are you
[1:15:25] doing you're getting in a different
[1:15:27] condition you're changing atmospheres
[1:15:29] from an atmosphere of fear to an
[1:15:31] atmosphere of Faith amen and God's
[1:15:33] calling you God's pulling you to this
[1:15:36] God's pulling you to this new birth amen
[1:15:38] God's pulling you to these things that
[1:15:41] you desire because it wasn't made or
[1:15:44] give to you by any goodness it was God's
[1:15:46] election and calling that brought you to
[1:15:48] it you never you never done nothing to
[1:15:50] Merit it amen you never saw after God
[1:15:54] God sought it after you and give it to
[1:15:55] you on the basis of Sovereign Grace Amen
[1:15:58] in a true hunger in a heart of a son and
[1:16:01] daughter of God will not leave you just
[1:16:02] joining Church true hunger will not
[1:16:05] leave you just just putting your name on
[1:16:07] a book true hunger will not just leave
[1:16:09] you in justification true hunger will
[1:16:11] not just leave you in sanctification but
[1:16:13] true hunger will take you all the way to
[1:16:15] Pentecost to receive the same holy ghost
[1:16:18] that was poured out in the book of Acts
[1:16:20] true hunger will take you to a reality
[1:16:22] true h will not leave you short but it
[1:16:24] says I've got to have it I've got to
[1:16:27] have a reality I've got to have what my
[1:16:29] pastor has I've got to had what they had
[1:16:31] in the Bible I'm not satisfied with
[1:16:34] anything less I'm not satisfied with the
[1:16:36] Creed but true hunger is taking you all
[1:16:38] the way to the
[1:16:42] reality predestin to search for
[1:16:46] predestinated to stay in the wilderness
[1:16:48] but you were predestinated to cross over
[1:16:50] into every promise into every blessing
[1:16:53] amen and never let the devil talk to you
[1:16:55] out of it because there's a deep calling
[1:16:58] onto the deep and if it's calling you
[1:17:00] know there's a deep to respond you may
[1:17:02] not even have a scripture you may you
[1:17:04] may have walked in here this morning and
[1:17:06] you can't even find the book of James
[1:17:08] but there's something in your heart that
[1:17:09] says There Is A Healer that you may not
[1:17:12] be able to find the book of Isaiah where
[1:17:14] it said uh you know by his stripes I am
[1:17:16] healed you may not even be able to find
[1:17:18] the promise of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:17:20] Bible but it's still a deep calling in
[1:17:22] to the deep there's still something in
[1:17:24] you that says there must be a Healer
[1:17:26] because I'm hungering for it I'm
[1:17:28] Desiring for it I've got a need for it
[1:17:31] because there's a deep calling to the
[1:17:32] Deep so there must be a deep to respond
[1:17:35] even if you don't even know where it's
[1:17:36] at in the Bible God knows and he's put a
[1:17:39] creative something in The Believer to
[1:17:42] press for that and pull for that because
[1:17:44] there's something in you connecting life
[1:17:46] connects with life life begins to
[1:17:48] connect with life and if there's a life
[1:17:50] in you this morning no matter how deep
[1:17:52] it's buried in the muck of sin when the
[1:17:54] Word of Life Starts to come forth the
[1:17:56] life in you starts con to connect with
[1:17:58] the life of this word and it begins to
[1:18:00] pull you out of that muck and pull you
[1:18:02] out of that sin and bring you up to the
[1:18:04] surface so you can see the light of day
[1:18:07] who you really are where you really came
[1:18:09] from what you've really been sent here
[1:18:11] to do and it'll begin to let you know
[1:18:14] it's for you it's for
[1:18:16] you it's a pulsation in you and me it's
[1:18:20] more than a custom so what do you do
[1:18:24] well there's two elements that control
[1:18:26] there's fear and there's
[1:18:28] Faith two elements and brother brand
[1:18:30] said a spirit anoints them now they may
[1:18:33] seem a little strange to a person that
[1:18:34] doesn't believe this way see if they are
[1:18:37] unbelieving it's the spirit of the devil
[1:18:39] anointing that person it's pulling right
[1:18:41] down it's pulling down and like that
[1:18:44] with disbelief you see and I can feel
[1:18:46] that and tell it brother brandom said
[1:18:47] yes sir and it makes it hard but he said
[1:18:50] when a person is really believing
[1:18:52] they're pulling in the spirit of God see
[1:18:54] cuz it's the word of God we all know
[1:18:56] that and if the devil can just put a
[1:18:58] question mark across there he's got you
[1:19:01] but when you erase that question mark
[1:19:03] and say that's every bit bit true and
[1:19:05] it's for me then you're pulling from God
[1:19:08] Amen you may have come in here pulling
[1:19:10] one way but you don't have to stay that
[1:19:12] way the only thing you can do is right
[1:19:14] now you have the authority to change
[1:19:15] your confession and say brother it's
[1:19:17] every bit true and it's for me and you
[1:19:19] can stop pulling in unbelief you feel
[1:19:21] like you're you're getting hold into
[1:19:23] that Darkness but in a moment right now
[1:19:25] under that authority of this commission
[1:19:27] you can change your confession and say
[1:19:29] brother it's every bit true and it's for
[1:19:31] me it's every bit true every promise is
[1:19:33] true and it's for me and I'm tired of
[1:19:35] that devil of fear holding me down in
[1:19:38] this muck of sin in this Darkness I'm
[1:19:40] tired of that devil holding me down so
[1:19:42] what do you do just turn to your
[1:19:44] neighbor and say it's for me say I'm
[1:19:46] changing my confession this morning it's
[1:19:48] for me I'm ready to walk in the
[1:19:50] blessings of God I you don't have to
[1:19:53] understand it it's not for you to
[1:19:55] understand all you have to do is believe
[1:19:56] it and start walking in it this morning
[1:19:59] right now under that Authority you can
[1:20:01] change and start walking in Fresh Light
[1:20:04] amen it's the devil it's Satan anyway
[1:20:07] that's trying to stop you he said well I
[1:20:10] shot the Holy Ghost and I just couldn't
[1:20:11] receive it I don't believe it's for me
[1:20:13] every time I get down I get sick and I
[1:20:15] go to praying if I fast I get sick if I
[1:20:17] try to stay all night I stay and get so
[1:20:19] sleepy I can't get off my feet remember
[1:20:21] that's the devil because God God intends
[1:20:23] for you to have the Holy Spirit many
[1:20:25] times you find when you're prayed for in
[1:20:26] a meeting Divine Healing the next day
[1:20:28] you find out no doubt the devil will try
[1:20:30] to make you worse and mean maybe some of
[1:20:32] you've been prayed for last night or the
[1:20:33] night before and the situation got worse
[1:20:35] and you think well maybe something's
[1:20:37] wrong no it's not that something's wrong
[1:20:39] he said it's just Satan trying to get
[1:20:41] you away from the blessing that God's
[1:20:42] got for you see don't you listen to that
[1:20:45] always press right on always press right
[1:20:48] through that that's the moment that
[1:20:50] that's the test right there and there's
[1:20:51] a test right there there is when when
[1:20:53] you've been prayed for for your healing
[1:20:55] for your deliverance and all of a sudden
[1:20:57] you begin to feel that little bit of
[1:20:58] oddness come back and and and sometimes
[1:21:02] I mean let's just this is we're all
[1:21:05] humans here sometimes you try to fight
[1:21:07] that with your own ability and say try
[1:21:08] to keep the bad thoughts from coming try
[1:21:10] try to keep them from coming uh uh I
[1:21:13] feel good right now and and I'm just so
[1:21:15] worried that it's going to come back I'm
[1:21:16] just so worried and you begin to and you
[1:21:18] begin to just begin to get yourself in
[1:21:21] such a worked up confusion in a worry
[1:21:23] but but it's just the devil trying to
[1:21:25] stop the visitation it's just the devil
[1:21:27] but you don't have to accept it you
[1:21:29] don't have to walk in it but you can say
[1:21:30] no devil I've come upon the basis of the
[1:21:33] word I've been come upon the promise I
[1:21:35] didn't come upon my feelings and there's
[1:21:37] got to come a time in your life and that
[1:21:39] time needs to be right now where you
[1:21:41] separate your feelings from your faith
[1:21:43] it's not about your feelings but it's
[1:21:45] about your faith in the commission and
[1:21:47] if you came for healing the Bible said
[1:21:49] by Stripes you are healed you don't have
[1:21:51] to walk in any any longer no matter how
[1:21:54] you feel no matter what the devil tells
[1:21:55] you you can walk out of it this morning
[1:21:57] because you're coming upon the basis of
[1:22:00] the infallible word for your deliverance
[1:22:02] for every promise you can walk out
[1:22:04] because you're not trusting in your
[1:22:06] feelings or your ability but you're
[1:22:08] trusting in the ever ever everpresent
[1:22:12] Promises of this
[1:22:14] Bible amen but Satan always tries to do
[1:22:17] that uh before I mean it's almost funny
[1:22:21] how how predictable he can be sometimes
[1:22:23] and man before this camp meeting you
[1:22:25] know all kinds of things are going to
[1:22:27] happen because Satan is trying to block
[1:22:29] the oncoming visitation and Satan always
[1:22:32] does that he did that to Abraham and
[1:22:34] Sarah when there was coming a visitation
[1:22:37] that they were going to have a son Satan
[1:22:38] tried to block it and brother Brandon
[1:22:41] would would tell about that many times
[1:22:43] and if you want to listen to it I
[1:22:44] encourage you is there anything too hard
[1:22:46] for the Lord Brother brandham lays us
[1:22:48] down real heavy in the first 15 minutes
[1:22:52] he says many times when we see
[1:22:53] disastrous things happening like that
[1:22:55] especially to Believers we must bear
[1:22:57] this in our mind that it's Satan trying
[1:22:59] to block the blessing that's on the road
[1:23:01] amen and he says down he skips down he
[1:23:04] says Satan's been after me all day so I
[1:23:06] just believe that there's a blessing in
[1:23:08] store here in this city somewhere and I
[1:23:10] know when he tempts me and tries to
[1:23:12] block me out what's he trying to do he's
[1:23:15] trying to get you to disbelieve he said
[1:23:18] the worst thing that you can do is
[1:23:19] disbelieve God and as soon as you get a
[1:23:22] little scar shared well maybe I haven't
[1:23:23] done this and maybe I haven't done that
[1:23:26] right then Satan's got that blessing
[1:23:28] conquered for you and me and you can't
[1:23:30] get to it as long as Satan makes you
[1:23:32] think that amen so what do you do in
[1:23:34] that moment you think maybe that's
[1:23:36] because something's wrong you maybe
[1:23:38] think maybe think maybe I didn't have
[1:23:39] enough faith maybe when I got prayed for
[1:23:42] I uh something was wrong and and all of
[1:23:44] a sudden and automatically that that
[1:23:46] blessing begins to slip away because
[1:23:48] that's what Satan wants you to do is
[1:23:49] change your confession to the negative
[1:23:51] but if you've come upon the word you can
[1:23:54] stand there and say no Satan's just
[1:23:56] trying to block my visitation so I'm not
[1:23:58] going to turn to that but I'm just going
[1:24:00] to look even more to the promise because
[1:24:02] I know it's promised me and I know that
[1:24:04] there's a blessing that must lay just
[1:24:06] beyond that press just beyond that
[1:24:08] battle there lays a blessing for you
[1:24:11] amen when brother Brandon went out one
[1:24:13] time praying in the woods and the
[1:24:15] thistles were all around them and the
[1:24:17] mosquitoes were buzzing around them and
[1:24:19] and and and and many times that's hard
[1:24:21] and we all know some times that's hard
[1:24:23] to get down and pray and your mind is
[1:24:25] going every which way except what you
[1:24:27] should be thinking about but brother
[1:24:29] brandham stayed there and begin to pray
[1:24:30] there and that's when the Lord dealt
[1:24:32] with him to go by the way of Carter's
[1:24:34] and Georgie Carter received her healing
[1:24:37] because brother Bram didn't just didn't
[1:24:39] just look at the circumstances but he
[1:24:40] pressed through that barrier and there
[1:24:42] was a victory that lay right on the
[1:24:44] other side of that barrier there was a
[1:24:46] Deliverance that lay right on the other
[1:24:47] side of that press so you can press
[1:24:49] through it this morning you may still
[1:24:52] Maybe maybe you're still feeling
[1:24:53] Darkness maybe you were prayed for last
[1:24:54] night but but this morning the devil's
[1:24:56] taunting your mind don't stop don't turn
[1:24:59] around press through the darkness press
[1:25:01] to the victory press to your healing
[1:25:04] press to your deliverance it's on the
[1:25:05] way anyhow if the word promised it it's
[1:25:08] on the way just keep rejoicing just say
[1:25:10] thank you Lord for the promise thank you
[1:25:12] Lord for the healing thank you for the
[1:25:15] Deliverance amen it's settled it's
[1:25:18] settled
[1:25:19] already what do you do you got to let
[1:25:21] the word be become your word brother
[1:25:24] brandom said you got to let the word
[1:25:26] become your word say well I believe God
[1:25:27] can heal but I just don't know stand up
[1:25:30] and let the word become your word
[1:25:32] believe it don't reason it just believe
[1:25:34] it it's the word brother and if the word
[1:25:37] can find a place it can turn if the word
[1:25:39] can find a place in your heart I don't
[1:25:41] care the situation you don't have to
[1:25:43] tell me we don't have to sit down for 20
[1:25:45] minutes and talk about your situation if
[1:25:47] the word can just find a place it can
[1:25:49] turn it no matter how dark it is no
[1:25:51] matter how deep it is no matter how much
[1:25:53] sin that you've come under if the word
[1:25:56] can just find a place it can turn that
[1:25:58] so what do you do you got to let the
[1:25:59] word become your word you got to let the
[1:26:02] word become personal to you and say it's
[1:26:04] not just a promise of healing it's my
[1:26:06] promise of healing it's not just a
[1:26:09] promise of Deliverance it's my promise
[1:26:11] of Deliverance it's my promise of the
[1:26:13] Holy Ghost it's my promise and let the
[1:26:15] word become your word amen and and no
[1:26:18] matter how dark the situation is am me
[1:26:21] we you can you can tell me you can tell
[1:26:23] me but there's nothing I could do about
[1:26:25] it in my human ability we could talk
[1:26:27] about how dark it is but I can tell you
[1:26:30] that there is a word that you can
[1:26:31] receive that can turn that situation
[1:26:33] around and change it for the glory of
[1:26:37] God what do you do brother Isaac what do
[1:26:39] I do you got to act on the commission
[1:26:43] we've been given a commission but you
[1:26:44] got to act on it what did Noah do for
[1:26:46] 120 years he walked out and he started
[1:26:49] building that Ark he just started
[1:26:50] banging Nails he started following the
[1:26:52] Commandments of the Lord there wasn't
[1:26:54] rain coming for you know 20 years and
[1:26:57] and all this time but he the whole time
[1:26:59] what it was he doing he was acting on
[1:27:01] the commission he just started acting he
[1:27:03] said Lord you told me I'm just going to
[1:27:05] act I'm just going to keep working on
[1:27:07] this Arc though they make fun of me
[1:27:09] though they tell me uh I'm some sort of
[1:27:12] of of just fanatic for doing this I'm
[1:27:14] going to act on the commission amen
[1:27:17] Moses acted on the commission you know
[1:27:20] the devil tried to tell him Pharaoh's
[1:27:21] been looking for you for 40 years as
[1:27:23] soon as you walk in that City he's going
[1:27:25] to have you killed but Moses said I
[1:27:27] don't know all I know is the Lord's with
[1:27:29] me he said he sent me I've got my staff
[1:27:31] in my hand I'm acting on my commission
[1:27:33] this morning I don't understand it all
[1:27:35] but I'm just going to act on it I'm just
[1:27:37] going to walk in it I'm just going to
[1:27:39] believe for it amen you know the Bible
[1:27:42] commissioned us to go into all the world
[1:27:44] and preach the gospel amen but brother
[1:27:47] Burley you could read that every day of
[1:27:49] your life but a few days ago you had a
[1:27:52] get up off the chair walk to that plane
[1:27:54] and get on and fly 20 hours across the
[1:27:57] world to be here what that takes an
[1:27:59] action that takes a stepping out to say
[1:28:01] Lord you told us to do it you gave us
[1:28:04] this commission but I got to act on it
[1:28:06] and me that's a that's an example but
[1:28:08] you can do that this morning for every
[1:28:09] promise for every Redemptive blessing
[1:28:11] for your healing what do you do you were
[1:28:13] prayed for the devil's come and
[1:28:15] whispered in your ear that that you
[1:28:16] didn't receive it you don't take that
[1:28:18] lie but you start acting on the
[1:28:20] commission and say Lord no your word
[1:28:21] said I was healed your word said I was
[1:28:24] delivered your word said by your stripes
[1:28:26] and that's greater than the feelings
[1:28:28] that I have this morning and mean if you
[1:28:30] desire the Holy Ghost those disciples
[1:28:32] went up into that upper room and for
[1:28:34] nine days they acted on the commission
[1:28:36] they just started acting said Lord you
[1:28:38] told us that we could have it and and
[1:28:40] what were they acting on it wasn't just
[1:28:42] acting on some figment of their
[1:28:44] imagination but they had a Word of
[1:28:47] Promise that they were acting on you see
[1:28:49] they had read in Isaiah 28:19 about PRI
[1:28:51] prep must be upon precept line upon line
[1:28:54] here a little and there a little hold
[1:28:56] fast to that what's good for with
[1:28:58] stammering lips and other tongues will I
[1:29:00] speak to this people and this is the
[1:29:02] rest that I said they should see in Joel
[1:29:05] 2:28 it said it shall come to pass in
[1:29:07] the last days saith God I will pour out
[1:29:09] in my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:29:11] sons and daughters shall prophesy and
[1:29:13] upon my handmaids and Maid servants will
[1:29:15] I pour out my spirit and what was it
[1:29:18] what were they doing they had a Word of
[1:29:20] Promise and they were acting on it for
[1:29:21] for n days and and it wasn't just say
[1:29:24] well maybe we've received it it's not
[1:29:26] that it's not just to say well they you
[1:29:28] know brother B said what if they would
[1:29:29] have said well maybe we've received it
[1:29:30] at at five days or six days but no they
[1:29:33] had to stay until but the whole time
[1:29:35] they were acting upon the word but but
[1:29:38] you're living in a different phase this
[1:29:39] morning brother and sister because
[1:29:41] brother Brandon said you know in this
[1:29:42] day we don't have to T and T and T
[1:29:45] there's no such a thing but while Peter
[1:29:47] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:29:49] fell upon him and you don't have to T
[1:29:51] this morning for days and days but right
[1:29:53] now you can make up your mind and say
[1:29:55] Lord you promised it to me I'm going to
[1:29:57] act on it you say when can I start
[1:29:59] acting brother Isaac right now you can
[1:30:01] start acting and say Lord thank you for
[1:30:03] the Holy Ghost Lord thank you for the
[1:30:05] promise Lord I know it's for me I'm
[1:30:07] tired of that devil and it's for me and
[1:30:09] Lord I Thank you for the promise thank
[1:30:11] you Lord for the Holy Ghost and you
[1:30:13] don't know maybe in just a couple
[1:30:14] minutes all of a sudden something come
[1:30:16] over your life and transform you and
[1:30:18] change the situation around you can have
[1:30:20] your healing when can I have it brother
[1:30:22] Isaac right now you can have your
[1:30:24] healing right now you can have your
[1:30:26] deliverance right now you can receive
[1:30:27] the Holy Ghost just start acting on it
[1:30:30] just start saying Lord I Thank you for
[1:30:31] the promise Lord thank you for my
[1:30:33] prodigals coming home thank you for my
[1:30:35] family thank you for my children thank
[1:30:37] you for the healing thank you for
[1:30:39] everything Lord that you promised me in
[1:30:42] your word I thank you for it I give you
[1:30:44] glory for it Lord for it's mine and it's
[1:30:46] settled and I don't have to live with it
[1:30:48] one moment longer and me start acting
[1:30:50] and and if you act ACT first you'll see
[1:30:52] a miracle but what you got to do you got
[1:30:54] to act first and then you'll see a
[1:30:55] miracle you start acting and by the end
[1:30:58] of this meeting you could be walking out
[1:30:59] of you're a completely different person
[1:31:01] a completely different young person
[1:31:03] transformed by the power of
[1:31:05] God what did he speak to Peter he said
[1:31:09] Lord when Peter walked out on the water
[1:31:12] he said Lord if that be you bid me
[1:31:16] come and he said come that's the hard
[1:31:20] part right there sometimes you pray and
[1:31:23] you really don't want to hear an answer
[1:31:25] you say Lord if if you do this I I'll
[1:31:27] serve you Lord if you do this I'll serve
[1:31:29] you and then he doesn't you're like wait
[1:31:31] a second it wasn't supposed to be that
[1:31:33] easy I'm not so sure if I if I'm ready
[1:31:35] to serve you I'm not so sure but there's
[1:31:37] got to come a time where you stop saying
[1:31:39] Lord if that's you Lord if that's you
[1:31:41] Lord if that's you B me come Lord if
[1:31:43] that's you I'll serve you Lord if that's
[1:31:45] you I'll know it's for me but all of a
[1:31:47] sudden the word came forth come and
[1:31:49] Peter stepped out on the water and
[1:31:50] there's got to come a time where you
[1:31:52] start acting and where you start
[1:31:53] stepping out on the water and me and
[1:31:56] brother brandom said come on he said
[1:31:57] that's just the same as James 514 in
[1:32:00] Mark 16 the same God that said it said
[1:32:03] come on we're not waiting to hear him
[1:32:05] say come this morning we're not waiting
[1:32:07] for anything he's already spoke to you
[1:32:09] through this word come into the water
[1:32:11] and the waters are good there's victory
[1:32:13] in the water there's healing in the
[1:32:15] water there's Deliverance in the water
[1:32:17] you just got to step out into it and the
[1:32:19] waters are stirred this morning by the
[1:32:21] preaching of the word the waters begin
[1:32:23] to stir this message has enough power to
[1:32:25] turn you around but you got to step out
[1:32:28] in the Water by faith and say Lord I'm
[1:32:30] going to start acting on it because you
[1:32:32] promised
[1:32:33] it am man this is where the rubber meets
[1:32:35] the road this is what you can take with
[1:32:37] you young people when you go back to
[1:32:39] school and when you go back to work amen
[1:32:41] this is the overcoming power upon the
[1:32:43] basis of this word and I think one of
[1:32:46] the most powerful examples of that of
[1:32:48] acting on the commission was John Ryan
[1:32:51] amen when he came in he came in blind as
[1:32:53] could be he came in and he started
[1:32:55] saying Lord I I got a need for healing
[1:32:58] and he went up for prayer and he said
[1:33:00] you know uh brother you know brother
[1:33:01] brandom heal me you know take this from
[1:33:04] me he said I can't do that he said well
[1:33:06] will you will you at least pray for me
[1:33:07] he said yeah and begin to pray for him
[1:33:09] and say you know you're going to be
[1:33:10] healed you're going to be healed John
[1:33:12] Ryan you're going to be healed just go
[1:33:13] forth you're going to be healed and so
[1:33:15] John Ryan starts walking off the
[1:33:17] platform and and he goes and he comes
[1:33:18] back and say I thought you told me I was
[1:33:20] going to be healed and brother BR say
[1:33:22] well I I that has nothing to do with it
[1:33:24] John Ryan uh you are healed he he
[1:33:27] already said you're healed that's got
[1:33:29] nothing to do with it and by the way you
[1:33:31] told me you believed anyhow you told me
[1:33:33] you were a Believer so why don't you
[1:33:34] start acting like you believe why don't
[1:33:36] you start acting like you're healed and
[1:33:38] so John Ryan did he walked out and said
[1:33:40] you know extra extra read all about it
[1:33:42] I'm Healed I'm Healed extra extra read
[1:33:45] all about it and he started acting upon
[1:33:47] that promise and he started walking out
[1:33:49] and one day he was sitting in a barber
[1:33:50] chair brother B and he said praise God
[1:33:53] I'm Healed praise God I'm Healed and his
[1:33:55] eyes became open he said wow now I am
[1:33:58] healed now it's finished now I can have
[1:34:00] my sight now it's over now it's already
[1:34:03] settled now I can walk forth oh I'm no
[1:34:06] longer acting now I'm rejoicing in it
[1:34:08] because it's settled and you can Rejoice
[1:34:11] before it's even settled you can Rejoice
[1:34:13] before your eyes are ever open because
[1:34:15] it was already settled in the word and
[1:34:17] you can rejoice in it amen you're not
[1:34:19] lying you're not lying you're
[1:34:22] acting you're not lying if you tell
[1:34:24] someone you're healed you're acting
[1:34:27] there's a sister one time brother Wayne
[1:34:28] tells about her name her name was Dena
[1:34:31] Nelson and they were down there in
[1:34:32] Arkansas preaching the meeting and she
[1:34:35] came up she had had a stroke and she
[1:34:37] said you know I want prayer you know I
[1:34:39] want I want prayer for my healing and
[1:34:40] brother brother Wayne laid his hands on
[1:34:42] her and prayed for her and he said go
[1:34:43] you know go confess your healing and so
[1:34:45] they come back to church that night and
[1:34:47] she said she you know he preached the
[1:34:49] word and she began to walk up towards
[1:34:51] that her again he said my hey she must
[1:34:53] be coming back for prayer again but all
[1:34:55] of a sudden she said brother Wayne I
[1:34:56] want to testify and you know what she
[1:34:58] did she took that arm that used to be
[1:35:00] crippled and when she reached out for
[1:35:01] that microphone her crippled arm reached
[1:35:03] out and grabbed that microphone her
[1:35:05] crippled leg reached out and she started
[1:35:07] dancing around that building because
[1:35:09] what she was she doing she was acting on
[1:35:11] her commission and she went from a
[1:35:12] crippled woman to a hill woman in a
[1:35:14] matter of moments because she just acted
[1:35:17] she didn't work through it she didn't
[1:35:18] press through it she just acted upon the
[1:35:20] faith of the word she just acted upon
[1:35:22] the promise and she began to walk and
[1:35:24] she began to dance a victory dance
[1:35:26] because it was no longer uh the identity
[1:35:29] of a crippled woman but she said I'm
[1:35:31] Healed I'm Healed there it is change
[1:35:33] your confession your identity isn't
[1:35:35] crippled this morning your identity
[1:35:37] isn't depression this morning your
[1:35:39] identity isn't anxiety this morning
[1:35:41] change that confession you've got to
[1:35:44] change it to this word and say Lord by
[1:35:46] your stripes I'm Healed Lord I don't
[1:35:48] care about the crippled arm by your
[1:35:51] stripes I'm
[1:35:52] healed amen we've had a soldier doing
[1:35:56] that all weekend he's got the trouble in
[1:35:58] his eyes but what's he doing Lord by
[1:36:00] your stripes I'm Healed he's not lying
[1:36:02] to you he's acting he's acting on his
[1:36:05] commission he's acting on the word and I
[1:36:09] believe the word will bring to pass the
[1:36:11] promise for his healing
[1:36:14] amen now it's a strange thing that this
[1:36:17] is so much thought of people they say
[1:36:18] well I'm weak my faith is not very much
[1:36:20] I'm not a very good Christian that's
[1:36:22] just what the devil wants you to say
[1:36:24] you're just talking his language right
[1:36:26] then see you mustn't never say that
[1:36:28] don't never let your testimony be
[1:36:29] negative let it be positive all the time
[1:36:31] I'm saved I have God in my heart I
[1:36:34] believe him with all my heart do you
[1:36:35] believe in Divine Healing with all of my
[1:36:37] heart let your testimony always in your
[1:36:40] thoughts never let a negative thought
[1:36:42] come into your mind if you can help it
[1:36:44] when it starts that don't entertain it
[1:36:46] where you say I can't help the thoughts
[1:36:48] from coming well that'll be like the
[1:36:49] farmer that said he couldn't stop the
[1:36:51] birds from flying over his place but he
[1:36:53] could stop them from roosting he's the
[1:36:55] high priest of your confession and it'll
[1:36:58] work for every Redemptive blessing but
[1:37:00] brother brandom said you confess what
[1:37:02] you confess you are that's what you
[1:37:05] are amen and any man will never live any
[1:37:09] farther or any higher than what he
[1:37:11] believes he's living amen it's not mind
[1:37:15] over matter friends but it's not your
[1:37:18] thought to begin with you're accepting
[1:37:21] something into your mind but it's not it
[1:37:23] has nothing to do with your thought but
[1:37:25] it's the just a nesting place for the
[1:37:27] word to come in and that if that word
[1:37:29] can find a place in your mind and begin
[1:37:31] to confess it and at the confession of
[1:37:34] your mouth that that word begins to drop
[1:37:36] into your heart and bring to pass the
[1:37:38] promise and it's not mind over matter
[1:37:41] but the mind accepts it and you can
[1:37:43] choose to accept either what God Said or
[1:37:45] what the devil said this morning you can
[1:37:47] accept what the devil says or you can
[1:37:49] accept What God Says and and that'll
[1:37:51] determine what spirit is in there and if
[1:37:54] it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the
[1:37:56] things of God and it won't feed on
[1:37:58] anything of the world but if you start
[1:38:00] confessing it and you start accepting it
[1:38:02] you can start walking in it brother and
[1:38:04] sister and if you start walking in the
[1:38:06] vision eventually you're going to be
[1:38:08] walking in the Fulfillment you say I I
[1:38:10] don't see Visions brother Isaac I I'm
[1:38:13] not spiritual that way that is nothing
[1:38:15] to do with it brother B said every time
[1:38:18] you open this Bible you see a vision and
[1:38:20] if you can take that vision and start
[1:38:22] walking in it brother one of these days
[1:38:23] you're going to be walking in the
[1:38:25] Fulfillment amen God gives Visions I I
[1:38:27] love them and I thank you I thank the
[1:38:29] Lord for them they mean so much to me
[1:38:31] but but but that has nothing to do with
[1:38:34] you if God hasn't given you a vision you
[1:38:36] still have one by the word and the word
[1:38:38] is your vision and you can start walking
[1:38:40] in that vision and you can start taking
[1:38:42] that promise and one of these days if
[1:38:44] you just keep walking in it you're going
[1:38:46] to walk in the Fulfillment one of these
[1:38:48] days if you take a promise for your
[1:38:49] prodigals and you believe with all your
[1:38:51] heart one of these days you might be
[1:38:53] sitting in your recliner and you're
[1:38:55] reading about Lord that that prodical
[1:38:57] son that came home and that door opens
[1:38:59] and they walk into the building what is
[1:39:01] it you walk in the vision you'll walk in
[1:39:02] the Fulfillment you walk in the vision
[1:39:05] for your healing you'll walk in the
[1:39:06] Fulfillment but you got to start
[1:39:08] somewhere you got to start walking you
[1:39:10] got to come back to the foundation of
[1:39:12] the word and say Lord I don't care what
[1:39:14] any other voice says I'm going to walk
[1:39:16] in the vision and man don't you think it
[1:39:19] was a little hard maybe for Abraham when
[1:39:21] God promised him Isaac and maybe ishmail
[1:39:23] come along don't you think there was
[1:39:25] some critics but Abraham had a vision
[1:39:27] for a son that would carry forth his
[1:39:29] seed and when Ishmael come along he
[1:39:31] wasn't phased at all but he said Isaac
[1:39:33] is coming I don't care what the critics
[1:39:35] say but my Isaac is coming amen that's
[1:39:38] what you got to do you see brother
[1:39:40] Brandon was promised a son he said
[1:39:41] you'll call his name
[1:39:43] Joseph and when the first girl came
[1:39:45] along they said Oh Brother brandom you
[1:39:47] know you messed up now is it you sure it
[1:39:50] wasn't Joseph Josephine you sure it
[1:39:52] wasn't Josephine he said no it was
[1:39:54] Joseph and I'm not going to worry about
[1:39:56] the critics I'm going to walk in the
[1:39:57] vision until my Joseph comes I'm going
[1:40:00] to walk in the promise until my Joseph
[1:40:02] comes and one of these days I'm going to
[1:40:04] walk in the Fulfillment because God
[1:40:06] promised me a son amen you're learning
[1:40:08] how to walk according to the word and
[1:40:11] don't settle for anything
[1:40:12] else and in this book of the law shall
[1:40:15] not depart from thy mouth but Thou shalt
[1:40:17] meditate therein day and night that thou
[1:40:19] mayest observe to do according all that
[1:40:21] is written for therein for then shalt
[1:40:23] thou make thy way prosperous then shalt
[1:40:25] thou have good success you're standing

[1:40:53] with that devil this morning I like what
[1:40:56] brother Wayne said he said well how why

[1:41:32] torment your mind you're a daughter of
[1:41:34] god sister you're a Son of God and you
[1:41:36] have a right to press through that
[1:41:37] Darkness you don't have to live with
[1:41:39] that spirit that would try to tell you
[1:41:40] these lies that you're never going to
[1:41:42] make it but there's another spirit in
[1:41:44] the building today that is declared to

[1:41:53] walk into full blessing you can walk out
[1:41:55] why why why do I do that because I've
[1:41:57] been commissioned according to this
[1:41:59] Bible to preach this word not just in
[1:42:01] letter only but in power and
[1:42:03] demonstration and even Jesus himself
[1:42:05] preached to them deliverance and the
[1:42:07] opening to Door the opening of the door
[1:42:09] to them that are in prison that's right
[1:42:12] amen and what are we doing this weekend

[1:42:15] have we been doing when we say the doors
[1:42:17] are open and you can walk out we're not
[1:42:19] just doing that just to pump you up
[1:42:21] we're not just doing that because we
[1:42:22] feel good and it makes us feel good
[1:42:24] we're doing that according to a
[1:42:26] commission and we're standing here and
[1:42:28] letting you know that you have a right
[1:42:29] to your deliverance you have a right to
[1:42:31] walk out of the prison this morning I'm
[1:42:33] here to declare to you according to the
[1:42:35] commission of this word that the doors
[1:42:37] are open and you can walk out of the
[1:42:39] prison and walk into your Victory anden
[1:42:41] you don't have to live with that devil
[1:42:43] anymore but you can walk into your
[1:42:44] Victory this morning it's a commission
[1:42:47] it's an absolute commission and no devil
[1:42:49] can talk me out of it no no no no no no
[1:42:52] no dried up teacher can talk me out of
[1:42:54] my commission because I met God in the
[1:42:56] sacred Sands and I've come under a
[1:42:58] commission say Lord your word will set
[1:43:00] them free your word will deliver them
[1:43:03] your word has the power to loose the
[1:43:04] spirit from their minds we're not
[1:43:06] looking for tomorrow we're not looking
[1:43:07] just to the end of the service but right
[1:43:09] now under the authority of the word you
[1:43:11] have a right to come out of that prison
[1:43:13] you have a right to throw it down and
[1:43:15] change garments to a new walk to a new
[1:43:19] life amen you got to stand you got to
[1:43:23] stand against that devil Joshua pressed
[1:43:27] through and on Joshua's Journey he went
[1:43:30] by Esau's Mountain how many know that in
[1:43:33] Deuteronomy 2:5 it says meddle not with
[1:43:35] them for I will not give you of their
[1:43:36] land and no not so much as a foot breath
[1:43:39] because I have given Mount siir onto
[1:43:40] Esau for a possession and when they
[1:43:43] passed by it Joshua had to keep his men
[1:43:45] from fighting with Esau's mountain with
[1:43:48] the men on Esau's Mountain Joshua's
[1:43:50] group said we're headed towards Jacob's
[1:43:52] mountain and Jacob's mountain is on the
[1:43:54] other side of the river and we're going
[1:43:55] to pass by Mountain and the problem was
[1:43:58] Joshua's Men had already tasted of blood
[1:44:00] so they were ready man hey let's fight
[1:44:02] these people man this is this is we're
[1:44:05] we're Overcomers we're going to fight
[1:44:07] these people but brother Bram said if
[1:44:09] you're not careful you try to do that
[1:44:11] you'll pick up their habits you try to
[1:44:13] stop by Esau's mountain and brother BR
[1:44:15] said you'll pick up their habits because
[1:44:17] there's some people that maybe you go to
[1:44:19] school with and and you go to work with
[1:44:21] and and and we trust that that that
[1:44:23] everyone is seed but there's some people
[1:44:25] that are living on Esau's mountain and
[1:44:27] brother BR said if they were
[1:44:28] predestinated to join up with you they
[1:44:30] would have but some not everyone's going
[1:44:32] to join up with this message friends not
[1:44:34] everyone's going to join up with this
[1:44:36] message so what you got to do is don't
[1:44:38] turn to the right or turn to the left
[1:44:40] and when those friends try to come and
[1:44:41] persuade you differently you're under a
[1:44:43] different commission you're headed to a
[1:44:45] different Mountain friends you're headed
[1:44:46] to a Rapture you're headed to to the
[1:44:49] Holy Ghost Land across cross the Jordan
[1:44:51] you're not supposed to stop short you're
[1:44:53] not supposed to stop and turn to those
[1:44:55] things but you got to press through that
[1:44:57] and why do you press through that
[1:44:58] friends because there's a deep calling
[1:45:00] to the deep and mean he said if that's
[1:45:02] enough for them that's fine if if they
[1:45:04] want to live on Esau's Mountain that's
[1:45:06] fine if they want to live just under a
[1:45:08] Halfway Christian Life that's fine but
[1:45:10] brother Brandon would say but if there's
[1:45:11] a deep calling to the Deep then there's
[1:45:14] you know that there's more for you you
[1:45:16] know that there's another Mountain for
[1:45:17] you you don't have to live on that
[1:45:19] mountain you don't to stop there brother
[1:45:21] BM said sheep hurting isn't enough for
[1:45:23] you you know just going just to just
[1:45:25] going to a denominational Church brother
[1:45:27] Ben wasn't enough for you why was it
[1:45:29] because there was a deep calling onto
[1:45:31] the deep in your heart that said give me
[1:45:33] my Mountain give me my Holy Ghost give
[1:45:36] me my Rapture give me my message and you
[1:45:39] press through every darkness and you
[1:45:41] press through you don't turn to the
[1:45:43] right or to the left you got to walk by
[1:45:45] Esau's mountain and walk to your
[1:45:48] Mountain but Joshua didn't stop stop
[1:45:50] because Joshua had already tasted of the
[1:45:52] land he said friends if all of you want
[1:45:56] to stop I that's up to you but as for me
[1:45:58] and my house we're going across why
[1:46:01] because Joshua had already seen it he
[1:46:03] said I don't know about you uh milk and
[1:46:05] honey may not be your taste but it's
[1:46:07] mine milk and honey may not be what you
[1:46:09] desire but it's what I desire and and
[1:46:12] and healing may not be for you but
[1:46:14] healing is for me I mean the Holy Ghost
[1:46:16] may not be for everyone but it is for me
[1:46:19] the message may not be for for everyone
[1:46:20] but it is for me mean heartfelt religion
[1:46:23] brother and sister may not be for
[1:46:24] everyone but it is for me amen and you
[1:46:26] can make up your mind but as for me in
[1:46:28] my house this message is for me this
[1:46:31] word is for me this Holy Ghost is for me
[1:46:34] and it's for my family and it's for my
[1:46:36] children and we're pressing into the
[1:46:39] land what are we
[1:46:41] doing we're
[1:46:44] overcoming Joshua was commissioned to
[1:46:46] stay with Moses's message no matter what
[1:46:49] Dayan and Kora said
[1:46:51] no matter what the critics said they
[1:46:53] could say Hey
[1:46:55] Brother Moses did you know Moses he
[1:46:58] takes too much on himself you know Moses
[1:47:02] sometimes he gets a little puffed up he
[1:47:04] thinks that his word is the only word he
[1:47:06] he thinks that his message is the only
[1:47:08] message and and and I think and this is
[1:47:10] just my opinion and well except I posted
[1:47:13] it on the internet and I posted on
[1:47:14] Facebook but but I think that that he
[1:47:16] takes too much upon himself and and that
[1:47:18] really really we should have more men
[1:47:21] because one opinion one opinion really
[1:47:23] really that's not good we need a few
[1:47:25] opinions we need to we need to work our
[1:47:27] our minds together to really get a
[1:47:28] balanced truth and and brother if you
[1:47:31] hear the that's the voice of Satan
[1:47:33] that's the voice of daythan and cor that
[1:47:35] try to come in and tell you that this
[1:47:37] message isn't really an absolute this
[1:47:39] this message isn't
[1:47:40] really it was a good it was brother
[1:47:42] Brandon's opinion and it's good for
[1:47:44] reference material but but but but I
[1:47:46] like to I like to hear little Dr Dobson
[1:47:48] as well and I I like i' like to hear a
[1:47:50] little good A little good teaching from
[1:47:52] the Charismatic Church down the road as
[1:47:54] well that's the voice of Satan in your
[1:47:56] ear sister that's the voice of Dayan and
[1:47:58] Kora which is a Satan voice that tries
[1:48:01] to get into your mind and tell you that
[1:48:02] this message is an absolute but Joshua
[1:48:05] was under a different commission amen
[1:48:07] and I'll Stand in the commission that
[1:48:09] Joshua stood and said I will not turn to
[1:48:11] the right or to the left but I will stay
[1:48:13] with Moses's words Moses's message is
[1:48:16] good enough and I'm under a commission
[1:48:17] this morning to just say what those
[1:48:19] tapes say don't add one word don't take
[1:48:21] one word stay with this message stay
[1:48:24] with what the tapes say you're under a
[1:48:26] different commission this message is an
[1:48:28] absolute over your life over every other
[1:48:30] opinion over every other answer this
[1:48:32] message is the
[1:48:34] answer we've been commissioned
[1:48:37] absolutely
[1:48:38] commissioned brother Bram said if you
[1:48:40] can read in that scripture something
[1:48:41] that Christ has ordained or commissioned
[1:48:43] us to do and because of some twisting
[1:48:45] around if someone would tell you that
[1:48:47] was for the disciples or someone else
[1:48:49] and then you you don't hold on to that
[1:48:51] then Christ is not your
[1:48:53] absolute that person who led you out of
[1:48:56] the way is your
[1:48:57] absolute but if that word Christ if that
[1:49:00] word Christ still holds then he is your
[1:49:04] absolute that is the absolute if you you
[1:49:07] got to look in this word friends and see
[1:49:09] what does this word say and then that is
[1:49:10] your absolute if this word commissions
[1:49:13] you to baptize in the name of the of the
[1:49:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is
[1:49:16] your absolute if this word commissions
[1:49:18] you to lay your hands on the sick and
[1:49:20] they shall recover that is the absolute
[1:49:22] and no teacher can take you out of the
[1:49:24] way but you got to come out and operate
[1:49:27] under your
[1:49:28] commission amen this is overcoming this
[1:49:31] is overcoming here amen we got to what
[1:49:37] does friends that's why you know that's
[1:49:41] why we stepped away
[1:49:42] anyhow you know brother brandom
[1:49:45] said he had to leave the Baptist Church
[1:49:48] to worship God he had to leave the B
[1:49:50] Baptist Church to worship and power and
[1:49:52] demonstration he had to leave the
[1:49:54] Baptist Church to really to really
[1:49:56] Worship the Lord to really preach this
[1:49:58] word he had to leave the church he had
[1:50:00] to leave every denomination and that's
[1:50:02] why we came out we didn't come out just
[1:50:04] to stay with the chains we didn't come
[1:50:06] out just to bring our chains across the
[1:50:09] boat like the pilgrims when they came to
[1:50:11] America they came out for Religious
[1:50:13] Freedom and and when you came to this
[1:50:15] message you came for freedom and you
[1:50:17] didn't come to bring your old change
[1:50:18] across the boat and say oh I know I sit
[1:50:21] in a message Pew but but I still think
[1:50:24] that that God that God doesn't deserve
[1:50:26] to be worshiped in spirit and truth I
[1:50:28] still think that that all the things
[1:50:30] brother brandham said weren't true but
[1:50:32] that's why we came out friends we came
[1:50:34] out for Freedom we came out for Liberty
[1:50:37] we came to this message for our freedom
[1:50:39] for our freedom for our children to be
[1:50:42] Lord filled with the Holy Ghost for the
[1:50:44] freedom for our children to overcome we
[1:50:46] came out for Freedom don't bring your
[1:50:48] chains over on the boat don't bring your
[1:50:51] denominational chains into this message

[1:50:55] of Freedom this is a Heritage for our
[1:50:58] children this is the place where we can
[1:50:59] rest this is the place where we can find

[1:54:03] circles and he would walk around and he'
[1:54:05] began to wither away and he began to
[1:54:07] wither and wither and wither and what
[1:54:09] was happening he was in a trap but one
[1:54:11] day a good man came by a good man came
[1:54:13] by and and took that little chain and
[1:54:16] took it off of his leg that he could
[1:54:18] walk free but what was the problem he
[1:54:20] had walked in prison so long that when
[1:54:22] that good man came by and told him that

[1:54:54] in it so long that you think that you

[1:54:58] that you think that that's going to be
[1:54:59] the end of your life you've lived in it

[1:56:27] to worship you because you saved me
[1:56:29] because you're my God not because I feel
[1:56:32] like it but because Lord you're worthy

[1:59:32] people he dealt with spirits and he he
[1:59:35] dealt with conditions and he could look
[1:59:36] at a lady and the lady had one time
[1:59:39] there was a lady that had a menopause
[1:59:42] and she had had people tell her that she
[1:59:44] had had Seven Devils on her and and one
[1:59:47] told her she had five Devils on her and
[1:59:48] one told her she had four Devils on her
[1:59:50] and she had people tell her you got
[1:59:52] Devils on her but when she come to a
[1:59:54] prophet the Lord could give him a vision
[1:59:56] of the situation and realized that she
[1:59:58] was just in a time of life and she was
[2:00:00] just in a time of menopause and all it
[2:00:02] was was the devil was making her nervous
[2:00:04] amen maybe the Lord's speaking to you
[2:00:05] right now don't turn it down maybe the
[2:00:07] Lord's telling you something here maybe
[2:00:08] you come into maybe you've come in here
[2:00:10] tonight and maybe you've been nervous
[2:00:12] and and maybe you've come in under this
[2:00:14] oppression and me and you come in and
[2:00:17] hearing this story of of this sister
[2:00:19] brother Brandon would begin to tell her
[2:00:20] that that that you're not you've got no
[2:00:22] need to be nervous sister you're just in
[2:00:24] a time of life you're not you're not
[2:00:26] you're not really bound up with these
[2:00:27] Devils someone's told a lie on you and
[2:00:30] and she got to where she could hardly
[2:00:31] eat her food because she said I'm not
[2:00:33] going to eat until until I get these
[2:00:35] Devils off of me but the prophet could
[2:00:37] come in and tell her that that you don't
[2:00:38] have Devils on you sister you're just in
[2:00:40] a you're just in a season you're just in

[2:00:46] during that weak spot and tear you down
[2:00:48] and and and so brother Brandon began to
[2:00:51] discern and say it's not that you're
[2:00:54] possessed with the spirit it's just that
[2:00:56] it's just that you're in a phase of life

[2:11:19] need a fleece Lord I need a fleece he

[2:11:43] here again this Sunday Lord am I going
[2:11:45] to make it he said have not I sent you
[2:11:47] Gideon you're Mighty Man of Valor I've
[2:11:49] sent you I've sent you and you're going
[2:11:52] to make it you're going to rise above it
[2:11:55] you're going to overcome because I sent
[2:11:58] you I sent you have not I sent
[2:12:02] you has not he sent us into this age
[2:12:05] didn't he spin us off of his Immortal
[2:12:07] thoughts before the foundation of the
[2:12:09] world it's no accident you're here you
[2:12:11] came from the mind of God and you're
[2:12:13] here to overcome it's no accident that
[2:12:16] you're here God spun you off of is
[2:12:18] eternal thoughts you're an eternal
[2:12:20] attribute of God and you're here to
[2:12:22] overcome you're here to finish this
[2:12:24] thing you I don't know brother and
[2:12:26] sister I don't know what the days are
[2:12:27] going to hold ahead it looks like the
[2:12:29] coming of the Lord is so near I don't
[2:12:31] know what kind of things we're going to
[2:12:32] go through we may go through some rough
[2:12:34] few days before then but have not I sent
[2:12:36] you have not I sent you why are you
[2:12:38] worrying why are you crying Moses I've
[2:12:40] sent you to finish this thing don't
[2:12:41] worry about what's going on in the world
[2:12:43] don't worry it may seem too late it may
[2:12:46] seem like it's too late for your
[2:12:47] children to come in but there's one
[2:12:50] thing there's something in literature
[2:12:52] brother Burley called a day
[2:12:54] newon and a day newon is that final that
[2:12:57] final place where all the Loose Ends
[2:12:59] begin to tie together it's that plot
[2:13:01] where all the climax of events begins to
[2:13:03] tie together it's called the day numon
[2:13:05] that's what literature uses to tie in
[2:13:07] all the Loose Ends and and I used to
[2:13:09] read a lot of books when I was younger
[2:13:11] and I learned something that sometimes
[2:13:12] you can come to the end of a chapter
[2:13:14] sometimes you can come to the end and
[2:13:16] and you look and you see that the words
[2:13:18] don't go all the way to the end of the
[2:13:19] page so you think something's coming to
[2:13:20] an end here something's coming to an end
[2:13:22] because there's a blank at the end of
[2:13:24] this page so when I turn this page what
[2:13:26] am I going to see is it going to be the
[2:13:28] end of the book or is it just going to
[2:13:29] be the end of a chapter and you take
[2:13:31] that page and you Lord I don't
[2:13:33] understand yet the events don't make
[2:13:36] sense yet I I I I I I've still got
[2:13:38] children and Lord I I see what's going
[2:13:41] on in the world and Lord I've still got
[2:13:43] promises and Lord it looks like it's too
[2:13:45] late for look Lord it looks like it's
[2:13:47] just too late and all of a sudden you
[2:13:49] turn that page and it's not the end of
[2:13:51] the book it's the start of the last
[2:13:54] chapter and God says you know brother
[2:13:57] Ram said he would take that and he would
[2:13:59] say I don't I don't have the quote now
[2:14:01] it's somewhere but he say thank God that
[2:14:03] there's another chapter written and and
[2:14:06] I believe he was talking about a sick
[2:14:07] lady that that came in he said thank God
[2:14:09] there's another chapter written what
[2:14:11] happened you turn that page you think
[2:14:12] you're living in the last chapter
[2:14:14] sometimes you say Lord it doesn't make
[2:14:16] sense Lord why is all this fear still in
[2:14:18] my life Lord why is all this stuff going
[2:14:20] on but if you're a Son of God and a
[2:14:22] daughter of God God will tie all those
[2:14:24] loose ends together and in that last
[2:14:26] chapter you begin to realize this is
[2:14:28] what it's all about you begin to realize
[2:14:29] Lord you're you're tying it all together
[2:14:32] all the loose ends are starting to make
[2:14:33] sense uh everything I wondered about why
[2:14:36] am I like this why why am I fearful oh
[2:14:39] why have I always been different than
[2:14:41] everyone else it seems like I've always
[2:14:42] been odd I've always been different from
[2:14:44] the other children what was it it was a
[2:14:46] deep calling to the Deep on the inside
[2:14:48] of your heart something in you a jean
[2:14:50] seed that made you different than
[2:14:51] everyone else and all of a sudden you
[2:14:53] begin to come to the reality of who you
[2:14:55] are and God burst you into your identity
[2:14:57] as a son or daughter of God and you
[2:14:59] realize all the Loose Ends start to make
[2:15:01] sense everything start to make sense in
[2:15:03] that last chapter that's who you were
[2:15:05] always meant to be you were always meant
[2:15:07] to wear the Garment of this message you
[2:15:10] were always meant to wear it God
[2:15:13] tailored Elijah Elisha to fit the
[2:15:16] Garment of Elijah
[2:15:18] he didn't change the message to fit you
[2:15:21] he predestinated you to fit this
[2:15:23] message amen and you probably many of
[2:15:27] you walked in the Garment of fear for a
[2:15:28] long time many of you have walked in the
[2:15:31] Garment of suicide for a long time but
[2:15:34] there's another garment that's been
[2:15:35] hanging up in your closet for a long
[2:15:37] time why don't you try it on there's
[2:15:40] another garment hanging up over there
[2:15:41] and you've always wanted to try it on
[2:15:43] you've always felt like there was more
[2:15:45] for you you've always felt like there
[2:15:47] was more of God to to be had and you've
[2:15:49] looked over at that dress and you think
[2:15:50] my pastor dresses like that Daddy
[2:15:54] dresses like that why don't you try it
[2:15:57] on this morning say Lord I'm taking off
[2:16:01] this garment Lord I'm taking off this
[2:16:03] Garment of suicide I'm taking off this
[2:16:06] Garment of depression I'm taking off
[2:16:08] this Garment of anxiety Lord put the
[2:16:12] message on my life Lord put this message
[2:16:15] on I'm stepping in this morning
[2:16:18] I'm stepping into my commission I was
[2:16:21] always meant to be a Son of God I was
[2:16:23] always meant to be a daughter of God I'm
[2:16:26] not just here because some man sent me
[2:16:28] but God for ordained that there would be
[2:16:30] a bride on this earth that could take
[2:16:33] and they could pick up this message say
[2:16:36] lord lord it's a perfect fit Lord you
[2:16:39] ordained this Lord you must have saw
[2:16:43] something in me that I didn't see that
[2:16:45] you would call me to this message and
[2:16:47] you begin to put it on and say Lord Lord
[2:16:50] I guess I always was a Son of God I
[2:16:53] guess I always was predestined to make
[2:16:55] this Rapture and then you just start
[2:16:58] slipping it on and all of a sudden the
[2:17:00] fear just starts rolling away the
[2:17:03] depression just starts rolling away say
[2:17:06] Lord this is what it's always been about
[2:17:09] you sent me Lord you you really did send
[2:17:12] me I wondered about it Lord I put out a
[2:17:14] fleece I put out a fleece and and Gideon
[2:17:17] when he came down he got all his men you
[2:17:19] know they had to go through test and
[2:17:21] those that were fearful were sent away
[2:17:23] and those that drank water laying down
[2:17:26] were sent away because they were used to
[2:17:28] bound down to Idols but what was it
[2:17:29] doing God was filtering you for this
[2:17:32] message God filtered you many left in
[2:17:35] the first poll many came in the second
[2:17:37] poll many came but then when it came to
[2:17:39] that third poll brother Ben they all
[2:17:40] left they were only here for the
[2:17:42] Miracles they were they weren't here for
[2:17:43] the opening of the word but when the
[2:17:45] opening of the word came your way that's
[2:17:47] what hooked you and it hooked you for
[2:17:49] Rapture friends this message hooked you
[2:17:52] for the Rapture you've been filtered for
[2:17:54] this you've been filtered your friends
[2:17:55] have left you but when you were left
[2:17:57] standing there you say Lord but to whom
[2:17:59] would I go where would I go and he said
[2:18:01] no you don't have to leave I filtered
[2:18:04] you for such a time as this I filtered
[2:18:06] you to speak my word I filtered you to
[2:18:08] make a Rapture I filtered you to stand
[2:18:10] above this layer to see in darkness and
[2:18:12] shine as a Morning Star I have filtered
[2:18:15] you for this and you know Gideon came
[2:18:17] down
[2:18:18] and Gideon came and he said but if
[2:18:20] you're still worried and if you're still
[2:18:23] doubting uh he said go with furah your
[2:18:26] servant down to the enemy's camp and and
[2:18:29] you can read it in judges I I don't want
[2:18:31] to mess it up but I just just
[2:18:32] paraphrasing it he said go down with fur
[2:18:35] your servant and and Gideon walks down
[2:18:38] and he walks down and and they go down
[2:18:40] there to the camp and and they're just
[2:18:42] like grasshoppers they're everywhere and
[2:18:44] they go down and all of a sudden they
[2:18:46] begin to overhear the enemy telling
[2:18:47] about a dream that they had and it was a
[2:18:50] dream of their defeat it was a it was a
[2:18:53] dream of Gideon's Army winning the
[2:18:55] battle and oh Gideon just starts
[2:18:58] rejoicing and say Lord truly you've sent
[2:19:01] me Lord truly we are going to win Lord I
[2:19:05] wondered about it I would put fleeces
[2:19:07] and Lord I would constantly worry that
[2:19:09] maybe maybe I'm not good enough because
[2:19:11] of the family line I came out of maybe
[2:19:13] I'm not good enough because because of
[2:19:15] the situations I came out of
[2:19:18] but the Lord says I've sent you and oh
[2:19:20] they overtook that Army and they won the
[2:19:23] battle CU it wasn't a man it wasn't
[2:19:26] trusting in no man but Gideon was
[2:19:28] operating under commission Lord have not
[2:19:31] you sent me into this age for such a
[2:19:34] time as
[2:19:35] this amen just stand to your feet this
[2:19:40] morning have not I sent
[2:19:43] you you know what
[2:19:45] this message means to me friends is
[2:19:49] years ago the Lord put that on my heart
[2:19:53] that if God could do it for brother
[2:19:56] Burley if God could do it for brother
[2:19:58] Ben then because this message struck my
[2:20:02] heart that it's more than a man's idea
[2:20:04] but God gave me a revelation that this
[2:20:06] message is Christ and he's the same
[2:20:08] yesterday today and forever so I begin
[2:20:09] to think Lord if you can do it for
[2:20:12] brother Burley you can do it for me and
[2:20:15] and start a Revival in your heart and
[2:20:17] it's a Revival of so can I a Revival
[2:20:21] that if it worked for Paul if it worked
[2:20:23] for brother brandom it'll work for me
[2:20:25] it'll work for me because it's the same
[2:20:27] yesterday today and forever say what do
[2:20:30] I do brother Isaac L we're going to go
[2:20:33] back to school we're going to go back to
[2:20:35] work but when the musicians can come
[2:20:38] when brother Brandon got off that plane
[2:20:40] in Memphis one time I mean he was you
[2:20:43] know he was meant he was I don't
[2:20:45] remember if he was going home or going
[2:20:46] somewhere El else but but he got off
[2:20:48] that plane and the the Lord began to
[2:20:50] deal with his heart go this way and
[2:20:53] there was a uh a widow woman that was
[2:20:56] praying for an Elijah and brother
[2:20:58] brandham didn't know that at the time
[2:21:00] but he just got off that plane and the L
[2:21:02] Spirit of the Lord began to brood with
[2:21:03] him just walk this way and he didn't
[2:21:06] know what the destination was going to
[2:21:07] be yet but it just began to brood with
[2:21:09] him just Just Walk This Way Walk This
[2:21:12] Way and he just begin to walk and all of
[2:21:14] a sudden you know the voice would come
[2:21:16] back just keep walk walking just keep
[2:21:18] walking uh you know he was leading the
[2:21:21] prophet he was in control and so instead
[2:21:23] of worrying about his flight instead of
[2:21:26] worrying about everything brother
[2:21:28] Brandon just started singing I'm one of
[2:21:30] them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I
[2:21:34] can say I'm one of them and what was he
[2:21:36] doing brother the Lord was telling him
[2:21:39] to just keep walking and the devil in
[2:21:41] his mind might have been telling him
[2:21:42] you're going to miss your plane you're
[2:21:43] going to miss but instead of worrying
[2:21:45] about the details he just started
[2:21:47] started enjoying the
[2:21:49] walk and many of you parents maybe you
[2:21:52] haven't enjoyed the walk in so long many
[2:21:54] of you young people you haven't enjoyed
[2:21:56] the walk in so long because you've been
[2:21:58] so worried you've been so worried about
[2:22:00] how it's all going to work out you've
[2:22:02] been so worried about how all the loose
[2:22:04] ends are going to come together you've
[2:22:06] been so worried about it that you've
[2:22:08] stopped enjoying the walk but isn't this
[2:22:10] Christian walk worth enjoying isn't this
[2:22:13] Christian walk worth laying aside every
[2:22:15] weight burying all your different all
[2:22:17] your church problems and just walking
[2:22:20] with the Lord and just just keep walking
[2:22:23] and enjoy the walk it's a good walk and
[2:22:26] remember when the devil tries to come
[2:22:28] against you and you're a Son of God and
[2:22:31] you're a daughter of God you can look
[2:22:32] into this word and be reminded have not

[2:22:46] Josh UA and Moses walked with it's not a
[2:22:49] different God this isn't a history
[2:22:51] lesson you are walking with the same one
[2:22:54] that they walked with you are walking
[2:22:56] with the same one that brother brandham
[2:22:58] walked with when all of a sudden the
[2:23:00] storm got spoken away and he's walking
[2:23:03] and all of a sudden it's just as if he
[2:23:05] was a young man and his tears begin to
[2:23:08] drip down and they would hit the leaves
[2:23:11] and it would crackle because the leaves
[2:23:14] were dry and he would look and the deer
[2:23:16] weren't scared of them and and it was as
[2:23:19] his his wife was there as if they were
[2:23:21] in their young age what were they were
[2:23:23] walking in Eden conditions again up on
[2:23:26] the mountain and remember who you're
