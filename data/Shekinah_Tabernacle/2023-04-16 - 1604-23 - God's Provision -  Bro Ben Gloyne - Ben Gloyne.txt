foreign [Music] foreign [Music] it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning good to see you all feeling good [Music] feeling Victorious hey man you know Christian always wins even if it may not appear so at the time we're always winning you know when the when the children of Israel the Lord said to Moses went after they got LED out of the um out of Egypt the Lord said to Moses lead them in a certain direction over to the certain place he led them there and then I don't know maybe a few days later it looked like they had been LED right into a trap and that all was lost you know as the pharaoh changed his mind on letting them go and he decided I'm actually going to go there and wipe them all out and it appeared for all intents and purposes like that was the end of them it appeared like everything was going wrong but the Lord was in control of the whole situation he led them there and he hardened fear his heart to lead Pharaoh there so that he could wipe him out once and for all but at the time it was I think it was relatively hard to see if you were standing there by the Sea and seeing Pharaoh's Army coming towards you but you know it doesn't matter what situation you are in in your life the Lord has always got it all under control Don't Worry About a Thing If It appears like you're in a bad spot you're not the Lord's LED you there and he's got it all under control that's

so God bless you amen Clifford family and everyone else just not here amen the Lord be with you Shannon and Jesse and amen um so Genesis 22 and verses 1 to 14. and then here we are so it says here this is speaking of Abraham and Isaac CC now so Genesis 22 verse 1 everyone there amen okay and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou love us and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and settled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac's son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place which God hath told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the S and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood and the of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac's son and he took the knife in his hand I mean and he took a fire in his hand sorry and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father said my son my father and he said here I am here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both went of them together and they came to the place which God hath told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac's son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fairest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the law Lord it shall be seen amen let's bow our heads in the word of prayer this morning if you have a need you want to raise it amen to the Lord with an uplifted hand Hallelujah gracious father We Want To Praise Your Great Name Lord we want to thank you Lord truly we can say we have seen your presence go before us and around us and behind us and within us Lord you're so good to us Lord we're so thankful Lord you've given us your peace and Lord I pray for anyone here Lord who may be watching and does not know your peace Lord does not know your presence Lord I pray this would be their day father may you touch all of our Lives Lord God may you meet every need Lord we want to thank you Lord that you're greater than all the sickness that's floating around upon the Earth long Lord you've already made a way oh God you've already made preparations Lord Jesus for all healing Lord because by your stripes we are healed so I pray father you touch each one o God who couldn't be here today Lord we think of the Clifford family Lord and Shannon and Jesse Lord and Lord anyone else Lord father who's unwell dear God I pray you touch their bodies Lord and father may you not just touch their bodies or just our bodies but may touch our Spirits touch our souls oh god father bring a healing Lord and the Inner Man Grant it father we love you so much we thank you we could read your word together we pray Lord may you anoint it now Lord not just speak about hearer as well oh God anoint all of us father and Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats uh this morning so I'd like to I'd like to speak this morning on God's God's provision amen we see that you know with with uh Abraham here you know God God provided for every step of his journey where he wasn't just here on Mount Moriah where God would provide but we know God before this where where the Lord came to him said I'm the Lord God Almighty you know and you know that's the strong yo the El Shaddai the strong the breasted one you know God provided strength from to draw off to to to get strength to to make the promise manifest in his life of a promised son so God provided God was Jehovah Jireh for every step of his journey amen it's the same thing with you and I he is Jehovah Jireh for every step of our Earthly Journey amen he does not provide in the beginning of our walk where we first meet him then he then then he runs out of Supply no but he supplies everything we have need of you look at how how Abraham had a revelation where Isaac was carrying the word and he's wondering where the sacrifice was and and and Abraham said by faith God will provide himself a sacrifice so it's not us providing the sacrifice or anything to meet our needs as he has provided amen so he's looking Abraham's Faith declared that the lamb was already there amen and we know that you know when when because God wasn't wondering actually what Abraham was going to do he already knew what he was going to do God knows what we're going to do but God allows us to go through trials and tests to prove really what's on the inside of us I mean because God had to reveal to Abraham who Abraham was God knew who Abraham was but God had to provide had to show Abraham who he really was and so when Abraham began to see Faith expressed in his life he began to realize that he was more than just a man or more than just a um you know thank God for aircon we're comfortable aren't we oh we're too warm too cold it's fine amen but you know God would provide himself I mean a a sacrifice and and Abraham's Faith was declaring what God had placed there now isn't it amazing that Abraham behind him heard thee heard the lamb bleeding Corner Thicket God created that lamb right there because God knew he would need that lamb and it's the same thing with every part of our Earthly Journey whether it be financially Natural Things spiritual things God will provide amen God will provide a house God will provide a job God will provide support God will provide everything we have need of we just need to walk in faith amen praise God so you know I was going to call this message God's response but I was thinking no God never responds God never reacts to anything God is the initiator and the devil's there the one who's in reaction amen so I thought that's not right God no it's God's provision because we're going to realize that before we ever came to the Earth God made a way he he gave us provision amen he you know you know he already made a way he knew what we would what we would uh face he knew what we would go through and by his grateful knowledge he provided at provision which was greater than what anything the enemy could do you know I'm so thankful you know I'm going to talk about the armor of God eventually but you know I want to say the devil's equipment Ain't Enough Hallelujah you know right now there's a war in Ukraine they talk about technology and they talk about tanks and you know abilities of different weapons that they're testing out you know I think can this one match this one and this one's better than this one the devil ain't got enough he has nothing that can ever combat what God has already given us amen so you know God by his God by his foreknowledge knew what we would need for this season that we live in amen it's like Brother Band would say about a um you know parents you know when they prepare for a child he'd say see see look how you're Earthly parent before you come here before they know you was coming made ready for your coming just think of that now your Earthly appearance which an Earthly parent is only type of a Heavenly parent if we know how to give good gifts to our children how much more does your heavenly father know how to give good gifts to his children amen Jesus spake these words see they made ready for your coming they made a little crib or got a little some little booties and little clothes and so forth they made ready everything for you to arrive prepared before you even come to the earth now that's just a natural that's just natural parents now how much more our Supernatural parent you know I was thinking about the Aquinas house that we you know enjoyed so much yesterday I believe God inspired someone to build that house for them amen to dwell and you know they didn't know when they're building it that God children were going to be there but I believe God inspired someone to build that house for them just like I believe God inspired someone to build this building for us hallelujah I believe that's how God works because he knew he people think this is going to be an office or a factory but no God actually enters his mind you think that but I know what it's for amen hallelujah so God you're going to see everything you receive amen leaving the car you drive God inspired someone to make that for you Hallelujah because he knew you'd need it amen so God looks after us real well amen hallelujah now if that's just in the natural you know how much more the supernatural Hallelujah you know see see God's God's fulfillment of his word shows his provision it's not some Eerie fairy thing God is Jehovah Jireh and he provides no no it's a it's a manifested reality Hallelujah you know we look at the scripture for example where Isaiah would be you know Isaiah we know he wrote the Bible within the Bible 66 chapters there's 66 books in the Bible you know you know you know he he he he started from in the beginning to Eternity right and then and then Isaiah is prophesying he says in Isaiah 59 and 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him amen so the Isaiah was actually prophesying not of his day but speaking of a future day because he says when the enemy shall come in like a flood then the Lord will lift up a standard against him amen now now we see that that wasn't Isaiah's day the enemy wasn't like a flood sure he was on the earth Devils were working and anointing people in all different kinds of things but there was not a flood of evil of demonic how like we see today I mean but we see the Fulfillment of this now as I said God God is Not reactionary because you think well the Lord see when the enemy comes in like a flood you think well he's then he'll lift up a standard then he's reacting no the reason the enemy comes in like a flood is because God allows it to happen now we won't read it but you read Revelations chapter nine it says a star falls from heaven now if someone you know if something Falls it doesn't it doesn't come down right it doesn't choose on its own choosing to descend it's been pushed well if you get pushed from a building or a tree and you fall you didn't come down you were pushed there's a force greater than yourself pushed you and gravity took you down it means this star which had the key to the bottomless pit foul it says in Revelations nine and one why is that because because that was actually the enemy falling amen what what happened is is God pushed him out of Heaven he was pushed they actually say he even fled to the Earth because he was defeated in heaven amen but now but then what happens is he comes down he has the key to the bottomless pit and then hell is open up upon the Earth Hallelujah now now and then now we don't have time for it now maybe we'll make it more of a study in the future but if you look at those demon powers that are released it's not a natural Army because they're told not to hurt the trees or the grass but only those men who don't have the Seal of God in their forehead so so it's demon depression on the mind of man and it can only touch those that don't have the Seal of God which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost see we are we're provisioned in the state hallelujah amen so so it's not a natural Army that's going to come and there's two you know these incredible uh yeah people think it's going to be a big army it's going to take the world no well it already has taken the world hey man brother and preached the invasion of the United States says the enemy's not coming he's here amen and that's the same thing the enemy's not coming and he's here amen you know so we must realize that he's here right but the thing is now if you keep reading down if you come down to verse 12 it says about after the first woe and and we know a woe in the Bible is a World War I mean and there's four Angels loose from the review Fridays with two hundred thousand thousand demons and so they have been loosed for the end time you know that they were bound until this end time but now they've been loosed amen so between the first and second world war amen these four Angels were loosed with their armies upon the Earth and they were sent to kill a third part of men and we know that that third part of men was actually the third part of the Jewish race and in the Holocaust the third part of the Jewish race we were murdered were exterminated why because demon anointings fell upon men to stir up amen the people against the Jews amen let's say yo Hitler the you know if you've ever seen Hitler Hitler's political speak he's not a politician he's a preacher and he always finished his sermon with amen and that's how the Lutheran Church used to finish that those those Orthodox our judges amen you know and you see his preaching his inspired he's anointed and the anointing was upon him went upon the people that's why the you know Nazi Germany all those kind of nations were so caught up in that because it was a it was a fallen Spirit anointing and they fell upon Mussolini and Eichmann in different ones and then they caused that to happen now so so there was a demonic anointing released and it killed the third part of the Jewish race now those demons are still here oh yes they haven't gone they didn't go back to the river Euphrates and about no no they're still loosed upon the Earth no but remember God knew God knew that this would be here right and so he's made provision that's why I gotta we're gonna have such confidence in our God I mean we should have absolute confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ this morning Hallelujah because remember he didn't just give us provision he predestinated us to wear that provision I mean because he's previously he always predestinates the people to overcome in the age that they live amen because remember the Bible would say in Revelation is two and three speak of the church ages always says to he that overcometh I'll give this or I'll Grant this you know so God knew that there'd be a people in that age that would overcome amen by the blood of lamb and the word of their testimony in that age amen I believe I'm looking at those people this morning Hallelujah part of them I mean so I can so so I'm sure we can agree just from those little statements here about Revelations 9 and and even if you go look at the history of the last 120 years of the world things have changed massive change we used to study in social studies and uh what is it these days called year 10 year 11. the rapid change in even the 50s and 60s of society you know in New Zealand massive change even even um you know I wish I saved the news article but there was an anniversary of when the Beatles first went to Australia and that tour changed the country because they used to be quite isolated but what happened four men with a demonic anointing came in through their music or released that Spirit upon the country and it changed it forever and even this is historian saying that tour changed their Nation well I was having a demonic anointing was released you know and and because of this we can see this is why there's so much Insanity that we have today there's all this demonic anointing you know it's amazing people are shocked by men wearing skirts and dresses today people are shocked by that they show you shot you should be shocked right that men men are cross-dressing today but in reality we've had cross-dressing for over 100 years it's actually nothing new amen women have been wearing men's garments for over 100 years now you know we're shocked by men dressing like women but we've become used to woman dressing like men and and and we've come accustomed to it we think it's normal it's it's not normal amen it's actually because of a demonic anointing upon people you know so because because why what's happened is because there's these fallen angels have come upon there the enemy is coming like a flood and and people have got used to women dressing like men women shouldn't dress like men shouldn't dress like women we should know what bathroom to use right we should know on whose side we're on right amen I remember when annalize was about seven years old I was trying to explain to her about chromosomes it's physically impossible for a man to change his chromosomes to be have a woman's chromosome and but it's 100 impossible you know you can't change who you are Spirit may come on and you can think of something but biologically who God made you you're different amen so we've had we've had sadly we've had women dressing as men for over a hundred years and and and has become acceptable now people can do what they want everyone has free moral choice but I want to stand for the Bible if we consider ourselves Christians we'll we'll do as Christians do amen because we live a certain way because we want to please the Lord right amen so because people say well what about women's pants and so on well you know people say well it's made for a woman no it's not because if you look at the origin of the Garment it was a man's garment you know because there's you know even as Moses would say you know the woman should not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do those do so are Abomination unto the Lord their God now we're going to realize what God doesn't like he still doesn't like he hasn't changed right he doesn't change his opinion because because now the Holy Ghost is here the blood of lamb is here and he just lets it know he's still what he loves he loves what he hates he hates he hasn't changed in any way and if you look at the law some things are Abomination unto uh unto Israel some things are Abomination unto God right so there's an Abomination under God God still doesn't like it and then all but some people say well they all wear robes they all wore the same garments when when Moses said a woman shall not wear a garment pertains to a man they knew exactly you know to our untrained eye not understanding the culture and how they're dressed you know we think well they all look the same but no there were men's garments and their woman's garments they knew exactly right and that's why the Lord wrote it this way is because this transcends culture and time because you go to any country under heaven and these man's traditional garments and women's traditional governments right so we don't want to let that Insanity come on us and think that is fine hey man amen Israelites they they had a different dress both sections and we have the same so he can't say well that's a woman's garment but but it's actually the origin of the man's government amen but now when the enemy comes in like a flood he says the Lord will lift up a standard against him but now notice the next verse verse 20. he says it says and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression and Jacob saith the Lord so there's actually two groups the Lord is coming to when all this happens Amen to the so the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them it turned from transgression and Jacob so because many times you would read this and think well Zion is is a part of Israel and Jacobs Israel City the same group no they're two different groups amen because what we have is Zion actually speaks of the bride of Christ it's not just a physical location in Israel but Zion speaks of the Bride hey man because you know the Lord was saying Isaiah 49 I'm just going to take one of this but Zion said the Lord has forsaken me and the Lord had forgotten me he says can a woman forget her suckling child but she um should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I've a grave and then the palm of my hands thy walls that continually before me thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that make hay shall go forth out of Thee left up by an eyes about and behold all these that gather themselves together and come to thee as I live saith the Lord thou shall surely clothe thee with them all as with an ointment and bind thee on bind them only as a bright Duff y speaking not just of a city but a people speaks about the daughters of Zion in the Bible right so now when the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise up a standard so so and then the Redeemer shall come to Zion now now when's he going to come to Zion then if the enemy's already coming like a flood well if you look at Revelations 9 after read Revelation is nine the first word of Revelations chapter 10 is and I Surrender the mighty Angel come down so in Revelations 9 there was a star Fallen he was pushed a greater force forced him to come down right because he was pushed he fell and the enemy is falling but in Revelations 10 and 1 says Anna sir another Mighty Angel come down he came down on his own choosing who is this Mighty Angel Christ himself an Angelic form amen he has come down this is when the Redeemer comes to Zion remember we're going to meet him in the air physically right but before we meet him in the air physically we're going to become one with his word here upon the Earth amen and that's what Revelations 10 speaks of is the people becoming one with Christ amen all that he is hallelujah amen so this Mighty Angel has come down has come to give us provision price gone I trust you're happy with me this morning I live because we're not alone in this battle we're not here humanly trying to overcome amen but the devil was course to fall and the bottomless pit opened sure but Christ did that and then Christ came down to show the devil all of his forces all that he is cannot stop his bride in the same time and he cannot stop those that turn from transgression and Jacob because after the Redeemer comes to Zion and we go on a Rapture what does he do he goes to the Jews that same Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord so you see the Fulfillment of that scripture to me that's quite neat Hallelujah amen praise God so now the Lord is here to meet the challenge of the day he knew what we would have need of amen he has provided us amen with many great things now as I said before it is the it is the Lord gives the promise to the Overcomer to he that Overcomer cometh right now to me that speaks of an individual walk you in the Lord Jesus Christ now and then and then even in this age where it says if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come unto him and sup with him and he with me so anyone that hears his voice anyone that hears this message amen open the door of your heart don't leave anything close let him come in and re renovate transform your life amen hallelujah amen now some people think well it's an individual walk well I don't need a local church I say yes you physically do I mean not just something that you pay your ties to the stream once in a while but you need to physically be part of a local body amen we need to be physically part of a local church because it says in um you know Hebrews 10 and 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the as the manner of some is well I don't want to be part of the I don't want to fulfill that part of it I want to be the assembling of ourselves together right amen but exhorting one another and so much more as you see that day approaching see we need one another I know this is probably nothing new so you know but you know don't just switch off here we are you know we need one another I mean every joint of the body fitly supplies the need amen there's a fiction there's an effectual working in the measure of every part making the increase of the body into the edifying of itself and love so every part of us we need every part of us you know if you woke up one morning and you didn't have one of your ligaments you'll feel it right if you wake up one morning and you're missing of muscle somewhere you're going to feel that you're going to be and the whole body at the compensate and won't be able to work as it could if that was there so we all need one another amen we're all part of the same body of Christ hallelujah amen it's a God now God has made a provision amen amen for this end time he's made a provision for our Earthly Journey before we ever arrived here now he didn't just put here put us here by chance right we are not here by chance we're not here by an accident you know some some parents may think their children are accidents but God With God there's no accidents right God knew you would be here you know I heard a testimony from from Canada that there was a there was a family and they and and and and and and they had their kids they thought so both the mum and dad had their tubes cut and everything but then they had another child and then they cut the tubes again they had the operation all over again then they had another child and that last child is the believer Hallelujah it goes the show we're not here by chance you know if God wants you here you're going to be here hallelujah so so we should wake up at the morning say God you wanted to be here today oh look I'm here for a purpose Amy I'm not here just to occupy time amen as the Lord would say if he has brought us here in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more how can we trust them to prepare the things that is to come amen but he says if he's brought us here in this chaos this world's a chaos amen but we can be the peace and the chaos amen we can be in the storm but the storm doesn't have to be in US sure the winds and waves will rage but it doesn't have the rage in you and I I mean why because God has provided where we have needle for Every Storm Hallelujah see God did not just make everything just to see if he could make it right he did not make the tree out there he did not make the you know the Earth that we stand on the food we eat this country he did not make New Zealand just for the sake of it he made it for a purpose I mean he made all the nations we're born out of for a purpose amen he made the road everything everything everything that we have is for a purpose now God did not make you and I just to see if he could make you and I he made us for a purpose and therefore there is a purpose of all of us being here we're not here just to be another human being you're here because God made you for some purpose you're not here just eat the food that God growed you're not here just to live in the house that God that man made although where the clothing that someone fashioned you'll hear for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are or how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail and my fingers for a purpose my eye and every part of our bodies is to serve a purpose and it was not just putty to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put in a servant's purpose as God's divine plan to do so and if we were put it for a purpose there's nothing can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that God has put us here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches or Sorrows we go through all of those are for reasons and there's a reason for it amen because why God wants to prove his provision he wants to prove his provision he does not just look at the theoretical specs of something he puts it into practice amen just like there's many weapons just like it was in the Spanish Civil War between World War II I mean many of the powers would send their weapons to that country to test them out before they are used in World War II it's the same thing before world war three right now in the Ukraine amen God you know you know the different Al you know different powers of sending their equipment because they want to see how it goes it's all very well in the training field it's all very well in the hangar it's all very well doing some test flights but when you put it into you know hostile territory you want to see how it goes against your opponents amen that's why it's you know you know the UK right now is the big weapons Testing Lab that's what it's been used for sadly this is what America is using it for Russia is using it for different powers they want to test their drones and their tanks and their missiles Amen to you see and it's the same thing with God God doesn't just have things on the on the runway God doesn't have it just in a cabinet to say this is what it can do God wants to show his provision amen and he wants to show amen the ability of those that are carrying that provision well this will say you're here for a purpose amen we're not here just occupy time or just go through the motions no God wants to prove us he wants a prove he's Jehovah Jireh amen he wants to prove that he will provide everything you have need of rather be healing amen amen Deliverance Peace of Mind financially Whatever It Is God wants to show he's still Jehovah Jireh amen and he will he will create something even out of nothing amen that Ram wasn't there when Abraham looked because he heard it behind him so now if something's behind you it means you've walked past it right so he walked past the thicket God showed him where to go he's walking past the thicket it's not there right but when he had need of it his faith declared it's going to be there amen God created it where it wasn't even there and there's the same thing with God can do for you and I you say well amen you say well my family Hallelujah my family has no desire God can create a desire amen what about my loved ones there's no there's no desire in them God can create that desire Hallelujah he can create whatever he is the creator amen he creates something out of nothing what is he you so face to do it amen so he used Abraham's Faith remember God who told him go on the mountain I'll show you where to go he saw it by Vision he was a prophet so he knew exactly the you know the the Red Jewel whatever it's going to be on he didn't just say well this is good enough no he went to the exact spot and apparently it's the exact spot where the temple is built he went on that mountain hallelujah amen so so he saw it by Vision he went up there and then even he's you know he told the he told you know his servants the lad and I are going to come back again amen so God knew yo Abraham had Resurrection faith Hallelujah hello people with Resurrection Faith amen same faith of Abrahams and you and I Hallelujah so he had a faith and then so God created the ram in a place where he walked past praise God God can create something out of nothing I'm you know I get excited I say Lord You're unlimited you can just do anything right now you can do anything Hallelujah you don't look at the circumstances and whatever we look at you just look at your word Hallelujah and that's what we need to do just look at God's word amen the greater the trouble you are thinking about from the um convention Auckland company I think it's Brother David Tyler was preaching us like when the lowest when you get to your lowest point that's when God comes on the scene so in your lowest point you should be rolling out red carpet Holly what are you doing in this trial why are you picking up carrying carpet around I'm gonna roll it down I'm I'm getting ready for my visitation what do you mean you're stressed you're troubled the world's falling apart your life is falling apart why are you why are you sweeping up why are you why are you getting the what you're a front door already why are you putting this carpet out I'm having a visitation amen I'm in the right condition for a visitation of the Lord hallelujah and that's how we should be and then it's like Abraham he's on the planes of memory it's dry it's a desert it's a bad place Sarah's fussing there's trouble going on and things but he begins to roll out a red carpet Hallelujah because why the one he's expecting to come is Gonna Come on the scene amen so Hallelujah you know praise God hey who's going to start rolling out red carpet right now Hallelujah that's what we should do hallelujah what if it's always darkest before Dawn amen praise God Hallelujah that makes me happy amen now now provision I just you know I always ask Mr Google what you know words mean and provision has a few meanings but one of us the action of providing or supplying something for use now I'm going to talk about how so that so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the full armor of God Amen but you've got to look at the action of how God provided this to us amen he didn't just he didn't just send it down on it on on on angel's wings he didn't say here you go you know put it in the mail to you no he knew that he had to change the wearer of the alma to match the armor just like Elisha had to be changed to match Elijah's Mantle right God God took him God see see and and the whole way that Elisha was was actually molded because what happened remember Elijah called Elisha by throwing his mantle upon him and that was actually God actually anointing Elisha right but then when he threw the mantle on him he realized it doesn't fit him just yet but he's ordained to fit the mantle right on the inside he's a prophet God already said Elijah's my Prophet after you amen so now how did he mold and shape him he just followed Elijah he is following Elijah he began to see what Elijah did you know no doubt he'd hear Elijah praying the prince of God would just come down what would begin to happen because his heart was soft it was cutting and shaping him to fit the mantle that's why we've got to be very soft-hearted we can't ever justify a position against someone amen because many times what stops the Lord is actually hardened hearts it's not circumstances it's hard and hot so he began to walk with Elijah and then they came to a place in the walk where now he's ready and then they Cross Jordan and then Elijah's taken up right then the mantle falls upon him and it fits him just right so he follows the word Elisha follows the word until he's cut and shaped for the word to fit him see we don't want to ever cut the word to fit our lives that's what denomination has done they've taken the word of God and they're taking a twink pin and crossed things out this this doesn't match me I don't want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I shouldn't have to dress this way I'm going to twink that out and you know God being the Jesus being the almighty no he's just my Aaron boy I'll cut that out seeing they get a twink pin why because they want to cut the word to match them we don't want to ever cut the word to match us we want God cut me shape me that I match your word amen that my experience matches God's Bible like the prophet says I don't want God's Bible to match my experience I want my experience to match God's Bible I mean because if you have a Bible experience you've got a Bible God to back up a Bible life now in you amen so this is what we've got to have a hallelujah amen I'm so thankful that you know God has given us that kind of a heart amen hallelujah just like you know here we were wandering around in this world and God God has already ordained yeah I've got a people to fulfill the Great Commission just like Elijah's commission wasn't finished in his ministry though God told him to do different things Elisha was part of the Fulfillment of what God told Elijah to do and this end time ministry God is what left it with us to fulfill praise the Lord amen we're not just standing here saying well in 1965 brother Bram did this no shall we talk about those things we appreciate the life of the Prophet right but that same God comes and lives in us that what he preached now becomes manifest manifested praise the Lord Hallelujah but now you've got to look at the action of providing so so God's Great action of of of providing the full armor of God for us amen he had to he had to come down because he knew that we weren't fit to wear it yet with our natural birth our fallen nature we're born with though we may have a sincere desire we want to be right we want to be Christians whatever more but we have to be born again our Natures have to change see that then now the armor can come on hallelujah amen so it's all part of it that's why it's got to be a death to self and what I love about a real death to self you know Christy and I were talking about it as Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane showed a real death to self when he said not my will but thy will be done there in Gethsemane he didn't say not my world but your will be done but I'll see how it goes and I'll pull out later if it gets to bed no when he surrendered his will he did not try and take it back up again because he made a clear-cut decision Lord whatever happens to me from this point on it is your will and I'm surrendered to it amen he knew what he had to face Remember by Vision he had seen Calvary he knew he'd be rejected all those things and and mad and all those things he knew it but he didn't go into Pilot's judgment Hall to say well if it gets too painful then I'm going to quit amen and we're to be like Jesus Remember so so we should have such a surrender in our lives that doesn't matter how painful it gets how much trouble we may face we may be perplexed and troubled whatever all may go on we don't quit we don't a full a full surrender to God actually gets rid of any plan B's we only have one plan that's actually plan C Christ right Hallelujah that is plan a is plan C amen praise the Lord that's what we're gonna have hey man I like playing C we should always let's do plan C yeah amen this is what we need to have amen so down so the action of him providing it was that he had to come down as a man take our sins upon himself redeem us back to himself amen so it was a great it was a great action that down Calvary hallelujah what that he could equip his army with the best amen and everything he equips us with is necessary it's not unnecessary and it's only in the battle you see how necessary it really is I mean it's like a it's like a raw recruit in the Army you know years ago they'd never really had helmets for the Army and then and then and then when they were first given to them the little rookie sword I don't want to wear this thing it's just a heavy thing on my head they thought it was unnecessary but when they got into battle they saw how much they needed it and God don't provide anything less he has need of unless we have need of it everything that he provides for you you'd better take it because you're going to have to need it amen in the Army are people carry around 90 pound packs on their back they've got shovels and grenades and all different kinds of things and they think well I gotta lug this stuff around I mean but it's in the battle when the when the machine guns trained on them not just trained above them to crawl under and they begin to dig and use everything in their packs they begin to realize how valuable the equipment is amen and it's and it's the same thing with you and I Hallelujah sometimes we may think what's the point of coming to church what's the point of reading our Bible praying listening to the message you may need that scripture one day you may need that quote one day I mean when the enemies come in you're trouble in your mind I mean God can bring that to your remembrance and combat that enemy Hallelujah all that song you know you know sometimes what's the point there's great Point many times we come through special meetings we think yo that was just a wonderful time though God's preparing us there for our future hallelujah we're going to be very attentive when God speaks to us because many times God will speak the name he comes in and cause tries to cause trouble but if we realize that we just heard what we heard on Sunday amen it'll combat what the devil does on Tuesday praise the Lord amen amen why because everything's necessary amen so now he equipped us with his Best Equipment I mean the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah we don't have we don't have second class equipment we don't have relics of formal Wars drawed up amen Lutheran or Methodist Doctrine or even Pentecostal Doctrine no we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the full word of God Amen we have the best equipment we've got the best generation fighter Hallelujah we have a Seventh Generation fighter not a fifth generation South fighter we're the Seventh Generation we're at the best tanks we've got the best guns we have the best ballistic missiles we got the best nuclear weapons thermonuclear whatever it is it goes boom and the devil's armor is Never Enough his equipment is second rate it's rusting it's gone all he's a creature of habit now if you think you think about a natural Nation if they're just a creature of habit just say just say for example we take America when they when they fought their first war they had muskets and cannons gun powered black powder rifles now now imagine if they're like the devil well they do they they'd use those same weapons in every war creature of habit uses the same old tactics standing online right in front of enemy and go fire yeah have you ever seen how that that's crazy stuff you know the British apparently stood like 30 Paces from it that's when they shot first like right there to there like meet a brother and Paul away you know and then they've already had received a barrage of muskets and cannons but they March in an order you know two two white belts on a red coat that's a good that's a good Target you know but they don't do that these days they've kind of wised up a bit this is not a good idea you know so what they wear camouflage and they've got the best weapons that they can get but the devil's a creature of habit see how he worked in Eden against evil how he worked against the angels is how he works against mankind today you take our Absalon gathered you know you know cause that Revolt in Israel that's how the devil worked against the angels in heaven and that's exactly how even how the devil you know the serpent worked against Eve maybe we'll go through that one day but you but because he he's a creature of habit he gets his black powder musket he matches up you know and sometimes we just kind of watch him like this and we and we get shot I mean that hurt me but he's a creature from heaven we've got way better weapons than that amen we just push a button well how do you say how do you push a button do you pray and God comes down and when you say Amen there's a missile comes out of a truth and it may go way up and there goes lands pinpoint accuracy and the devil's blasted this by the Rings but you got to push the button we have to use the equipment God's given us and we'll get to that soon hallelujah amen he says now I believe the whole armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the word behind it and if anybody says they got the Holy Ghost deny one word then it's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wrote this Bible and he said whosoever shall take anything out of it or put anything in it the same way we've taken as part out of The Book of Life the Holy Ghost recognizes the word only because that's his word and he cannot go back on that word he has to keep his word amen amen so the whole armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the word behind it now there's you know if we read in two if we read in Ephesians and now I'm just going to skip one well maybe we'll come back to it but but the Apostle Paul let's turn to Ephesians 6 shall we're here if you don't mind a bit of a a bit of a Sunday school lesson you know it's interesting in Ephesians where you know you read chapter one that that the Apostle Paul tells the Ephesians they they have they have been sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise he even would say in Ephesians chapter four don't grieve the Holy Ghost we're by your seal to the day of your Redemption so if you have the Holy Ghost you can grieve it but you can't be unsealed I'm so good I'm so glad God doesn't use our Humanity um our Humanity against us Amen to kick us out of the Kingdom aren't you amen you sealed in you sealed in we can't grieve him we don't want to grieve him right but it doesn't mean we get unsealed praise God I'm so happy but then it's notice notice here he says he says here in uh verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God so it's interesting they have the Holy Ghost they're still to the day of their Redemption but yet the Apostle Paul is telling them put on the whole armor of God so to me what this means it means actually put it into use amen because what okay you can take I don't know what kind of weapons we have in New Zealand but what good just say if we're at War what good are those weapons if they sit in a hangar or some storage shed somewhere and they're mothballed what good that they can work maybe on paper you know what they can do but what good are they if they're just mothballed or maybe even just on a trophy display like the whole armor of God okay you have to put it on that actually when you're in battle it will prove its worth amen and so what that means to me is that to put on the whole armor of God God's saying actually don't be in this battle carnally but let the holy ghost in your life be your armor let him take over every battle right let him be your defense let him be your be your armor praise the Lord because remember God's God's given us real good provision in this hour amen so so he says because what that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil yeah amen it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore so so the apostles repeating this wherefore so because of what we've just read because of what we're fighting take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand so the email to withstand in the evil day so Paul's actually speaking of a future day it's this is the evil day amen where where Satan is the God of this evil age I mean so we so there has to be a people that can stand in this evil day remember God predestinates the best equipment Hallelujah he produced The Knights of people to put on that equipment they mean to overcome in the age of the room Hallelujah so this this is the evil day in my opinion the world has never been so evil has since the flood is it's never been this evil as as we live in right now amen but the but God doesn't make does not allow the enemy to get anything one up above him praise the Lord he says having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth now truth is not a collection of ideas it's not trending opinion it's not a an agreement of a group right it's not a Collective Agreement of a group amen it is not the majority opinion right because if he took their majority opinion Jesus was a heretic Jesus was a blasphemer but what did God say it's my son this is the word made flesh I mean remember the apostles were in the minority the scribes and Pharisees were the majority which one's right if they had websites and social media in those days oh my you know ever Pharisee Jones that's amazing people used to get all their epiphanies in the shower now they get all their epiphanies driving along they sit in a car and and they had this deep video they've got to share with the world what's the road man you're driving you know but they seem to have all these you know yeah now I'm just going to tell you this and I've been thinking and they're driving and saying I thought man that's crazy no wonder there's accidents people get all these Deep Thoughts you know when they're driving just pull over or something you know so imagine Pharisee Jones he's in his chariot the cheese of Nazareth you know I've got this deep Revelation from God you know that's what they would do that social media would have taught them to shreds because the devil would have anointed them to make websites and all kinds of things no well who's right then well they'd say well we heard them say unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you and my Bible says this and Moses he said yo yo you can't eat the flesh with the blood in it that's you know all those things well that may be a truth but it's not the truth because they weren't understanding what he was saying right but you see so truth is not a truth is not a collection of ideas or opinions no Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life truth is a person amen which is the word made flesh that is the truth hallelujah so your Lion's gonna be good about with truth amen so now so you've got to put this armor on you let the Holy Ghost take control of your life and and having on the breastplate of righteousness now a breastplate covers the Torso well know what a breastplate is don't we it's a piece of armor to here to here covers here I mean so so it covers your vital organs but it covers and that includes your heart now your heart is your seat of your emotions right it's not now when the Bible talks about a heart it's not really talking about a a muscle pumping blood through your body however many times whatever you know beats per minute but it's talking about your seat of your emotions your spirit I mean so so this breastplate of righteousness has to actually cover your emotional realm yeah I mean it's got a It's gotta protect your emotional realm I mean and what is it it is they called a breastplate of righteousness because as a Christian what is the greatest battle we really fight are you really a believer you know when you're in the when you're in the world you didn't care you're in the world doesn't matter you know you never had that battle am I really a am I really a heathen you know am I really an unbeliever am I really a sinner I never had those thoughts when I was in the world you know I don't I don't believe any of us that came out of the world really had that mind battle no of course not why because you're on the devil's side you actually have no opposing Force against you trying to trying to rob your your identity actually the devil's saying yes this is who you are absolutely you're a drunker you're a geek you're a gamer or whatever you are yeah that's yeah movies music yep that's you you know right but then when you meet the Lord and the devil's cast out of your life then now you've got then now you've got an opposing Force the devil's always challenging you are you really you you think you're the bride of Christ you know you really think you're an overcomer look what just happened this morning coming to church how was that conversation was that an Overcomers conversation was that really you know and then what does he do he's trying to he's trying to get into your vital organs spiritually now he's trying to get but you've got to realize that no matter what the enemy Fires at you you've got a breastplate of righteousness and that righteousness is not your own righteous as we know we know it's not our own righteousness right we know we'll get there by the grace of God Amen by his righteousness it's all him amen when we're gathered around the throne we won't say it was all you and me Lord some days it was mainly me no yeah yeah that was the days where I failed right no it was all him amen salvation is of the Lord alone praise God Amen Grace we know as a Divine influence upon the hardest reflection in the life as brother our mum was preaching on Wednesday amen so it's nothing we have done in our Humanity that will that will mirror us the body change no he gave us remember he became sin for us who knew no sin that we would be made the righteousness of God in him can we put that up second Corinthians 5 and 21. I love this verse we've got it by our front door I say take that devil you know he he called us all kind of names that's amazing all he can do is accuse yeah he comes along like a whiny a whiny little kid you did this that's all he can do if you listen to him then he has power over you don't listen to him so take your opinions back to Hell see look to me this is the breastplate of righteousness this is what he's done has he already done it see some people always try and put this off in the future one day I'll be righteous one day Lord no no don't put it in the future see you've gotta you've got to pray and thank him because it's in his mind it's already done remember when Jesus died on Calvary it is finished what's finished the sin question what's finished the price has been paid amen what is finished now righteousness is my races can be released or is released on a people that will so it's not a future event so people say well you know one day one day one day Lord you'll forgive me one day I'll be redeemed one day you know yo we're talking to someone in Chile Pedro and I and they were talking about this before we're about to pray I said no hold on I'm sorry but that's actually not right he already has done it it's not one day no no he he has already done this for us and we're going to pray and thank him you say well I don't feel it I don't yeah I don't think I'm quite there yet you thank him for what he's done then he can act on your behalf of what he's already done so he hath mate he has uh made him to be sin for us who knew no sin and everyone's very easily can rejoice in that he's our sin offering praise God that we might be made the righteous of God in him praise the Lord so if he became my son offering the most righteous as he is that should protect our emotions amen your father that should protect our heart our vital organs what was that a breastplate of righteousness Hallelujah amen and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace now it's interesting with the next one I'll just you know I'm just picking out a few here now above all now now in another translation I think it's the uh English Standard Version I saw last night it says and in all circumstances taking the shield of faith whereby ye shall quench the quench all can we put that up um Ephesians 6 and 16 are we yeah we're in now we I like this I like that all men this is the perfect Shield you know Israel's got its Iron Dome and David slinging we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know see see above all so it doesn't say this about the breastplate or being good with truth or even the sort of through which is the word or the helmet of salvation but it's but it's this above all taking the shield of faith whereby you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen no these fiery darts will shoot at you what are these fiery darts they're Satan's thoughts they are thoughts remember because because the devil the devil can put thoughts in your mind but it's what you do with them amen do you either do you either receive a package you either sign for it and then open its contents and then now it's all in your house in your house or do you take the box stomp on it and return to send it all right what do you do you know I think I think every every every every thought that comes into our mind that's contrary to the word of God stomp on it how do you stomp on it you actually tell devil actually no the Bible says this you're telling me this about this brother this is about the sister but they're part of me because by one Spirit we're baptized into one body amen they may have done this but they're part of me anyway and I can look beyond what they've done because we're one body Hallelujah sure I may have done that but I've repented of it amen the blood has washed it and now it's on your head man one day I want to preach about the burden of sin you know because we think about the Lord Jesus carrying that cross up Calvary all the sins of the world but you know the devil's getting this weight added to him day by day and day by day why because as the bride confesses her sins hardly all the sin that was attributed to us lands upon him and then when he comes up to the Judgment he's going to be bowed over and he can't he can't he can't get rid of this weight because it's actually part of him hallelujah amen oh yeah one day I want to preach on that the burden of sin amen Satan's got a bad Sin burden and he ain't got no cure Hallelujah praise the Lord amen hallelujah so so we can we can stop we can stop the we can quench them why by taking the shield of Faith now Faith is a revelation amen faith is a revelation so if the Lord has revealed you who he is in this hour that this message is more than a prophetic Ministry more than a Healing Ministry but as Jesus Christ himself revealing his word right it is Christ coming down to this end time revealing himself in the word right because the message is Jesus Christ reveal amen what is that now then you are built upon the rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is not was but is amen so you can take that Revelation now and use it to quench every fiery Dart Hallelujah well how do you take that Revelation then well it's quite simple so for example the enemy fires a thought in your mind you ain't gonna make it but you can take the Revelation now the Lord's met me he's he's given me a provision in this day the full armor of God and the reason he's given me that provision is because I'm his child right remember remember this equipment is made for a certain group of soldiers is and they're predestinated soldiers right you think maybe you volunteered for this Army but your but your name was on the roll was on the was on the Army roster or whatever it's called before the foundation of the world the Lamb's Book of Life and that's why you're you're called into the army and that's why you accepted the call Here I Am Lord amen I sign up praise the Lord hallelujah see that's why we should never think a negative thought brother Bram says now don't think sitting here in the wheelchair you you're not that you're hopeless or helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through or don't let it anchor you can't help it going through your mind that's right but don't let it stop it's like the old farmer said I can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun I can sure keep them from roosting so you do the same thing too don't let them Roost you just let them pass right on through and here's a shotgun to use I mean both the Old and New Testament amen it's a double bell shotgun it's very good too I'll tell you it keeps them all away Harley what you know well we're talking about President talking about it you know you know how we say we're in a battle you know the devil's fighting us man he just turns up to get a pounding when you think about it you know he was against us but then who goes away licking their wounds who goes away carrying their dead and they're injured It Ain't Us amen because we've got a bar from Gilead right the Lord heals us in the battle right but now but the enemy taxes packs his soldiers back to hell why because they come against you they get a pounding I trust that happens in your life you know the devil starts afflicting you begin to pray God comes down sets you free Amy he starts working your family you begin to pray you let Love Project what happens he gets abounding Hallelujah I trust that's your experience hallelujah amen see it see it works real good you take the promises of God you begin to confess them they'll say that's firing a shot at the enemy Hallelujah and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God but then notice this now sometimes we forget the last part of the armor is Verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints so he's saying don't just pray for yourself no it's for All Saints amen CCC ow see this armor that we've put on the seventh part of it is prayer and I say that much it's the most important part because it actually brings God on the scene remember how the Lord Jesus when he was there and he was he was you know about to be crucified different things he says don't you know I could call my father it's in 12 Legions of angels right she's basically saying I could pray right now and my father will hear my prayer and send 12 Legions of angels and he could just change the whole scene by by one prayer now how much more now you and I redeemed by the blood you know we have more Authority in heaven than an archangel who never felt Gabriel Michael wormwood whoever it is you know the great most powerful are angels in the armies of heaven we have more Authority with God under the blood of Jesus Christ being his children Amen to those angels that never fell do you know that they can be talking to God about something and we go down on our knees and and God goes wait you're next in line sure this conversation isn't your your important wormwood but my child's talking to me my son my daughter we're having a conversation amen so prayer praying with all parents application in the spirit and watching there until with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen now see well what does the prayer do if we get wounded in the spirit we can pray right if a dart gets through we can pray amen father forgive them they don't know what they do if we fall then we we say look what do we do we pray we repent we get back up we have a high priest amen amen but what kind of prayer do we use because it's easy to say a prayer but the purpose of praying a prayer is that we're coming to the presence of God and he talks back to us right brother Brown would speak this in the Great Commission you'd say no he says he says did you ever just let me give you if I found Grace in your sight through God um he says take my word for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong so basically if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing he says if you want so I'll just change it now if you want to have supplication watching the answer with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints so if you want to get a blessing and be a blessing amen when a man has done you wrong and he just and and he has absolutely justly I mean he's done you wrong and you know he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God so don't go tell everyone about it this is not your status on Facebook this person did this and this is a I'm going to put this on my gram and tell you tell the world that this is going to be on my Twitter feed and oh boy we're going to have a Twitter storm because brother sister so-and-so did this and X and Y and Z no don't tell anyone about it put down your phone right get off WhatsApp and pray yes I'm trying to bring it into out because it can be abstract let's let's bring it on now see how we respond to things really proves see Abraham his response was a Godly response God's able to provide him himself a lamb right what should our response be to all things because remember it's like this the only way I know this is because this could be any this could be any colorless solvent could be methanol could be isopropanol it could be it could be many different things right hexane anything okay the only way I know what it is is if I take the cap off and I I taste it I pour it out and it's and it's the same thing with us as believers we're filled with the Holy Ghost well how do we know Trouble Comes right the lid comes off and then what's really on the inside comes out it's easy to say this is water you got to taste and see it's water right and but it's by experience I can say now this is water so it should be now by experience between one another we can say that person's a real Christian right I got so mad at them and I just did the most carnal stupid thing and what did they do they prayed for me they loved me more they're pre I say they are they are a great Heavenly water right but if they started shooting and scrapping and doing all kinds of things and what's happened in trouble I'd say no that's butane well that's hexane it's a poison by the way it'll kill you don't drink it stay out of the solvent cabinet kits foreign you see so what's in US comes out when Trouble Comes amen so now Hallelujah he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in just a selfish way and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the prince of God our Father weigh and say a prayer uh sorry way of prayer should be in the prince of God and say father here's my brother he just he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it then let God go to talking to you see this is prayer then let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what the man's been through the devil has twisting him up somewhere and caused them to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a rank sinner this is not even about Christians now this is about the whole world they could have such a vendetta against you and they can plan things and they can do horrible things but if you could impress stand with them shoulder to shoulder it's like you're praying with them you go to Before the Throne of God God begins to reveal to you what they've been to why they're like that and then when you get back down you can't have those same feelings against them you know many times it's like the kids you know one will say this one did this to me deal with them dad but when the shoes are on the other foot they want Mercy they just want Mercy and that's how we are as human beings sometimes if we're carnal deal with them God bring them to a place no we shouldn't be like that I'm not trying to be humorous but that's how we feel sometimes no but but that's not real prayer that's just saying a selfish prayer no we should be able to pray in such a way when God's got done talking with us then we can really stand in their shoes and actually love them more and that doesn't say anything about it they've asked forgiveness or not that's got nothing to do with it amen we don't pray for people intercede for them just because they say sorry Hallelujah no amen amen we should practice even people it doesn't matter what they've done said sorry not sorry ah sorry pretend to be sorry whatever more we should love them anyhow now what about a brother that's made that that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if we will take him to the throne of God stand shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing he's Immortal and maybe this maybe his destination I I I I really wish I put this up there and maybe his destination rests upon our attitude towards him maybe our attitude I mean his destination rest upon our attitude towards him just an attitude not even a deed or a word our attitude well he deserves it where are you sending him where are you sending him potentially with that attitude see we should man Lord Jesus oh my amen when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize that we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other and the best way to do is pray after you've really been the prince of God you see it's amazing when you see people who are in The Prince have got a lot of soft and they're loving and they're warm and they're forgiving and they're gentle why because they've been the prince of their creator and they realize you know you all need help we all need the Lord right but then those who are not in the prince of God that much or at all they become sticky and hard and and judgmental and all these different things so I said Lord help us I'm just going to finish there this morning we should pray always we have been provided with the best equipment but put it on don't let your carnality rule you let the armor of God be on Beyond amen and let it fight the battle for you Hallelujah let's have the musicians please this morning amen praise the Lord amen Brothers have you got a song um I don't I'm not sure all right man should we should we before we sing that shall we sing um um for the Lord is marching on and his army is ever strong amen let's just let's just sing that then we'll try that Jehovah Jireh song amen
