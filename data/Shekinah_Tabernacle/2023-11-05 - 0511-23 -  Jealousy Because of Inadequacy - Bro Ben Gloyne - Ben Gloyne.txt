believe so hallelujah amen so who's happy to be a Christian today amen praise the Lord amen we're just going to go to the scripture now we're going to we're just going to read one scripture as uh you know um you may say well it's just one verse but you know we know the word of God is eternal and um it's not the of the verse is what's in the verse amen it's God's Eternal Word that's it's big you know there's a lot in there so we're just going to read this one verse and we'll then we'll open in prayer and amen so Proverbs 14 and and 30 who enjoys the Book of Proverbs you know I heard uh brother blue Kennedy many of you sister Maggie knew who he is we'll meet him one day you'll meet him one day he's gone on to be with the Lord many years ago but that was his Daily Devotional was was a chapter of proverbs every day and I think that's a good thing to um do amen amen so here it says here Proverbs 14 and 30 a sound heart is is the life of the flesh but Envy rotness rotness of the bones amen so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer we remember do you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen gracious father we're so thankful Lord we can worship you in spirit and in truth and Lord we know it's not anything we have ever done Lord that counts or stands it's what you have done amen and Lord as we come into your presence this morning we asking that your Divine Mercy would just overshadow us dear God may you Lord we have come to see you today lord it's great to see one another's smiling faces and see one another worship and praise you and Lord but we've come to meet you the great unseen one Lord so as Brother Andy was praying I believe this morning about inviting you Lord we invite you here this morning Lord we need you to take over lord our houses of clay oh God may come and move in our lives and Lord do what you want to do in this service Lord Jesus we submit ourselves under your Mighty hand and we pray dear God all those who couldn't make it today Lord we see there's a few who are not here Lord I pray you be with them Lord be their portion father be their strength dear God if they're not Lord if they're unwell in body may you touch them and heal them Father we want to remember brother Phill in hospital Lord I pray You' heal his body Lord I think he think he told me had 110 Staples or Lord Lord in his body Lord I pray Lord you'd heal Him Father raise him up dear God and Father Gabriel Lord may he continue to put on weight and grow healthy well and strong we thank you Father for your lord for your hand on his life too and Lord we just pray that you be merciful to us we commit our Liv Liv into your hands Lord this whole day Lord may we look back at the end of this day and say it was you Lord Jesus so Grant It For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning I was um so it was before camp and I was thinking about jealousy for some reason I begin to think about why uh you know why people get jealous you know there's a reason for everything and you know just the thought came to me that because jealousy is you know it can be you know it can be it can be because of many things right people can be jealous over over people who who who have money they don't it makes them jealous or different things but really what came to me was jealousy because of inadequacy where people be feel inadequate to do something and they get jealous of those who are made to do it amen and um so this this here in Proverbs 14 and3 we're just going to let's just let the Lord just have his way you know preached on meekness and and you know unselfishness I just think we just continuing in those kind of thoughts you know cuz God's got to prepare us to leave this earth you know it's God's got to do surgery in our lives and break generational problems and carnal natures and you know God doesn't want those things in us so you know this is where we are you know you know so so this this word here if we look at this Envy it's another word we can put in there is is it's say jealousy or Envy now we know our God is a jealous God but there's a negative there's a perverted jealousy and that's the one that we want to we want to get rid of today amen it's not meant to be our portion so you know it's you know that so the Envy is rottenness of the bones that's how terrible jealousy jealousy destroys people jealousy destroys communities jealousy destroys Nations you know even um we'll get into it maybe later but you know especially you know um you know like in for example Pap Guinea you know there's people are very jealous there you know there'll be people I know people who have who you know you in their own village they you know you they have a village meeting they say look I want to I want to make a pig farm pigs are very valuable over there they mean a lot they're they're very valuable commodity they said look I'm going to make a pig farm in our village you know you you know all of us are going to work together and we're going to even share the profits this is going to benefit us all they make the pig farm but because they even their own relations are so jealous of them doing something greater than themselves they will kill all the pigs they'll burn down the farm because they're jealous they'd rather destroy the place then see their neighbor and their family Prosper wow you say well that's over over there no it's here too it just comes in different forms but that's jealousy see jealousy would rather see the place in ashes than than that than see anyone go forward but it's amazing because your jealousy jealous people like to help though they like to be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff so they hate to see people succeed but when they're broken on the bottom then they want to help so people say I'm not jealous because I want to help people who are ruined but they want to push them off the cliff so jealousy is very subtle in it in its ways we don't want to be the ambulance at the bottom we want to be the fence at the top amen because because someone who's not jealous wants to see someone Prosper you know I was thinking if you guys all became multi-billionaires I'd be happy for you I wouldn't be jealous I'd be glad amen use it for the kingdom of God you know I'm not worried about that stuff doesn't bother me people do well praise the Lord you know God moves go you know you have a family Revival praise God you know we shouldn't be jealous of anything amen God does for anyone yes on natural or spiritual right but we know jealousy came from Satan it's not an attribute of God and so we don't want any part of him amen even it says in Romans 13 He says the night is fast spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantedness you say well I don't do any of those things not in strife and envying Hallelujah so not in strife and trouble and turmoil and we got to have someone to fight against and something you're battling with and you know some people love to have an opposition but they but they but they turn the gun on their brother and sister they think their cause is against someone else no we have a cause against the devil right the Bible says we should live peaceably with all men if the waters aren't troubled then there's no trouble don't stir the waters don't cause trouble for trouble's sake you know some people live off drama no we should live off the word of God and the peace of God that passes all understanding amen so he says let us walk honestly let you know we we don't walk in the nighttime people who walk in darkness have are full of strife and envying now that doesn't mean there's not you know Strife when I'm talking about Strife here I'm not talking about trouble in your life you know through Great Tribulation we enter the kingdom of God right we have trouble we're not void of trouble just because you become a Believer we actually get more trouble but we have the one who deals with the trouble on the inside of us and he takes care of it he proves his word in that trouble and then what does he do just just to reveal himself give you testimony after testimony of his Saving Grace then you have greater confidence in the god that's called you amen so sure we'll have trouble but this Strife is there's no peace in the soulelujah there's always a trouble there's always a contention and there's always an envy and a jealousy but let's not walk like this this is not your walk okay our walk is peace love joy and the Holy Ghost amen this is how this is this is what we're called to I'm just going to go through this and hey we're going to get to an end and I pray God would just touch me too amen amen so Strife is a quarrel a contention a debate a a a Strife a variance we shouldn't be full of that full of quarreling we shouldn't have any quarrels true amen hey I'm just going to go amen we shouldn't have any quarrels amen blessed are the peacemakers amen blessed are the pure in heart amen you know those Beatitudes that Jesus spoke amen he's describing the character of a Believer amen so he's actually see he he spoke it am mean the Holy Ghost should take that word take it into your life and manifest it out of your life amen so that so we should be a walking Beatitudes amen this is how we should be amen amen see now what does it mean to be jealous un s Cambridge told me this unhappy and slightly angry because you wish you had someone else's qualities advantages or success they should just be happy amen amen Lord we should rally yes God's moving we should rally around that move I mean just be thankful you know like brother bam said on the Ohio River he was just he was just there when God turned up you know and I want to be wherever God turns up Hallelujah that that's where I want to be wherever he is Lord where are you going I'm coming with you Lord you you that's how we should be amen we shouldn't be unhappy or jealous because someone because God is moving in someone else's life you know because the reason we people get jealous as they think well they're not doing it my way therefore it's wrong their family is different to my family and God can't bless that family cuz they're not like my family every family is Sovereign every family is different all of our children are different as husbands and wives we're different God is not a cookie cutter amen where do we we are the only thing we're to conform to is the word amen right not to our idea of how we should all be amen but you see if we see jealousy Compares it's always comparing it's always keeping stock of people and it's no forget that we should compare ourselves with the word of God amen amen so but you see and to be inadequate means lacking the quality or quantity required insufficient for a purpose now when I'm talking about these things I'm talking more spiritually here because you know people get jealous we'll take it through the scripture when God moves God always when God comes he causes trouble yeah cuz he's about to stir up and change the status quo over Place amen you can see this when when um you know when Samuel is told by God to go to Jesse's house to anoint one of his sons king and the first thing that Jesse's family Jessy says have you come peaceably because they know wherever Samuel goes God goes and God sent him and God's going to cause some trouble because God's going to stir up the status quo and that's what the anointing does Amen CU jealousy wants to keep everything the same but God wants to build amen powerhouses of the Holy Ghost in every one of our Lives amen he wants to stir us up he wants to bulldo the devil's Kingdom and build his kingdom and whenever that comes there's a upheaval of things amen there's always a disturbance that's why when even people are convicted there's a disturbance going on Amen they feel convicted they try and blame but the devil say blame this person this person this person no you got to fully die out and let God change your nature am mean so that's why Samuel was asked you know they trembled the Elders of the Town trembled it is coming this is the last verse and they said comest thou peaceably she's like man something's going to happen he Samuel doesn't just go somewhere because he wants to go somewhere God has sent him to do something amen and he says yes peaceably I'm come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice now this is going to spark some jealousy wherever God because many times we think of you know God chose me Hallelujah I'm the bride praise God you're just happy you're in but what about those who say that's not fair who said they should be in why not me see there's always a flip to every coin see people who really know him Rejoice that they know him others who don't know him are jealous that they don't know him like that but they'll always carnally belittle someone they'll always carnally belittle the believer that's jealousy so Samuel is going to come and he's going to anoint David as king because David is ordained to be King David was made to be king the anointing remember did not make him King the anointing Came Upon him because he was King he had kingship in his life amen that was is he was predestinated to become king over Israel so now if you imagine now when you know David is you I mean Jesse calls his sons but he doesn't call his youngest son the one that God ordained to be king is not even invited to the feast and you know no doubt you know Jesse would go to his older Sons and he would say look look Samuel's coming he wants to have a feast with us they would do their hair they would get dressed out would get already you know cuz they're expecting that that you know that Samuel's going to do something you know God's going to touch their lives and some way so they get dressed for church they're already you know they do what they do and you know they put on their choice clothes and everything and then now one by one they're instructed to pass before the prophet so no doubt when it's your turn let's just put ourselves in their shoes right nowall I've been told I'm basically go going before the prophet of God God's going to speak to me God's going to do something but then every time it's just like nope how would you feel when you hear a no let's be real let's be real friends how would you feel you're expecting especially the eldest elab it's going to be me look I look like a king I you know I'm built like a king I'm the eldest so I'm the leader of the home the elders isn't always a leader some people think they're leaders they're not leaders some people think they're not leaders but they meant to be leaders amen so you got to be very you know this is not an age thing that dictates who's who right I mean you one by one they go past and everyone no no because God tells because even Samuel thought that eliab was going to be it but you know God would tell him don't look on the outside it's not a statue of a man I'm not talking about a physical ability that makes us inadequate in a person it's a spiritual inadequacy amen that is the thing that causes a jealousy and so here they go one by one and you know you know Samuel thinks the first one yes cuz he's big he's strong he looks like a king but God says no I'm not looking at those things I don't look as humans do but I look at the heart of man amen God seeth the heart he doesn't look on the outward appearance then Jesse called abinadab and made him to pass by before Samu he said neither ha the Lord chosen this then Jesse called shamama to pass by he said neither hath the Lord chosen this and one by one they all go past and then Samuel left stand there there's a whole bunch of nose but then finally there's you know Samuel says do you have another son and J is like oh yeah I do go get him he's in the field you know so so David comes in now here comes the youngest brother now I don't know if you can see the emotion I wanted this photo cuz you see the emotion on the picture here to me I mean I mean you know the drawing to me this encapsulates it because here's all the NOS who are here who think they're yeses and here comes the yes who is really they thought was a no he wasn't even invited and then now look at this imagine this this is your family one of your siblings is going to be king yeah it's not you but it's going to be one of them shouldn't you be instead of this you should be hallelujah amen amen amen my brother's going to be king he's going to be anointed king we're going to take the whole land amen God's going to live in our house amen that's my brother Hallelujah I'm his brother amen Hall I'm his big brother Hallelujah that should be see see that is not jealousy amen that is that is a genuine Thanksgiving to God that God would visit the home amen anoint one of us hallelujah to do a predestinated job but they don't look like that do they they're jealous are unhappy this guy this little boy this young fella you know wow I think God's got it wrong oh come on now Samuel you're too old you know you're causing no no no this is not right you know but no God said no but he said yes to this one but you see it caused a jealousy to rise up can you imagine the next day or after Samuel leaves W imagine the dining table you know normally the youngest in the family you kind of look after them they're like the family petting away you know cuz they're the baby of the family not after this here comes David in they were all there when it happened the Bible says the spirit of God was with them from that day on do you not think there was a at a presence came down when Samuel was pouring the anointing oil on David's head there would have been a different atmosphere walking with him but then imagine the dinner table it wasn't just now tell us again how it felt oh how's it now when you play your H David it now when when you're with your sheep man that's amazing as you'd say man I just play and it's different when I play now you know it's like I'm not playing anymore it's like my hands just you know there's an unseen Force guiding my hands and I begin to sing lyrics I've never heard about before and there's such an atmosphere come oh play for us David and he begins to play around the dining table then God comes down Hallelujah it wasn't like that why because of jealousy it would have been you know instead of looking after the little brother he would have been become more of a pain and he didn't do anything different it was just now the older brother's attitude because of jealousy against the younger one they would have been offended look I've been in the message longer I know all the quotes and all the scriptures and all these things it should be me but God doesn't look at those things he looks at the heart he has predestinated vessels that will manifest his promised word in its season and you know I believe look I'll read the quote at the end I'll just say it not for B but you know brother Bram says I may not be able to manifest all the word but I'm not going to stand in the way of people who can amen so here's this picture now and then we know that there's a there's the call to war and when Saul and all the so so now this is this is now with Goliath coming out and bringing his boast and challenges so when Saul and all the is and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine they are dismayed and greatly afraid now David was the son of that ephran night of Bethlehem Judah whose name was Jesse he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul and the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn who was rejected remember the next under him was abinadab and the third was shama and David was the youngest and the three eldest followed Saul see you see now there's a big difference between the three eldest and David because they went into Saul's army they got trained like Saul they got ecclesiastical vest like Saul trying to manufacture a promise amen but David was schooled by God Amen with the sheep in everyday life God was training David Amen in a different training that the three Elders got and now remember there's jealousy in the family right there's jealousy in the family amen because the eldest was inadequate but if he realized is inadequacy and he rallied around those who was adequate it would have been a totally different picture because jealousy can simmer it can be a lot of passive aggressive comments for a long time but then it'll boil over eventually what's in the inside comes out amen I trust you just enjoy it with me amen I've been enjoying this amen because there's so many things in the word of God you look at Family Dynamics and it's Spirits am mean it's more than just carnal well dynamics of a family there's Spirits within family am amen it's either God or it's a family spirit amen and we're called to cast out the family Spirit we're not called to live by a family strain but the family strain of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's what we're called to have amen so now David it says now David left his Carriage now notice this now am me the first verse here I've got in yellow see they were all they were dismayed and greatly afraid this was the whole Army now if you think about this if if David's three older brothers really rallied around what God did in David's life when they first heard Goliath's challenge maybe a few days in they could have sat around the campfire and said you know Brothers our younger brother killed a lion and a bear remember when he was anointed remember when Samuel came to our house remember when God anointed him remember when the presence of God came into his life and then he would you know because remember when David you know David killed The Lion and the bear who would have been the first people who would have heard about it the older brothers amen the family would have heard about it who would have seen maybe the lion rug outside David's tent they would have seen it amen and the bear the next they would have seen it amen so they would have been it wasn't secondhand yeah they heard it firsthand the testimony of God's power in his life am mean so really if they had no jealousy they could have said you know what our brother's got a different atmosphere with him he's not he there's a fearlessness about this boy did you see that lion he killed he said he grabbed it by the Scruff of the neck and he slid its throat it after he hit it hit it with a stone and I looked at its body there was really a knife mark his throat was really cut Hallelujah did you see that Berry down I've never seen such a big thing a big Whopper as that thing you know there's something different about our brother and God's been proving it we should bring him to the battle Glory look we're all let's be honest here we're all dismayed we're greatly afraid of this guy but David has different kind of testimonies amen David has a different kind of a training let's go get him see if they did that that would have been a proof there was no jealousy in their lives CU they just wanted to get the job done amen who cares who calls the last one in let's just get them in who cares I I don't care if it's us or not I'm not worried I just want to go home amen amen so you know that's how we should be right amen amen amen it's not about trying to B see now see David left his Carriage into the hand of The Keeper of the carriage ran to the Army and came and saluted his Brethren as he talked with them behold they came up the ch Champion the the Philistine of gath Goliath by name out of the armies of the Philistines and spake it quing the same words and David heard them and all the men of Israel when they saw him fled from him and were sore afraid all those men included his brothers right so jealousy wants to keep everything in status quo this is what jealousy wants to do amen so so if they weren't jealous it wouldn't have remained this way but then now when David heard the boast of Goliath and he began to speak to the men who stood by him saying what will be done to this man that kills this Philistine and taketh away their approach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God and the people answered him after this man is saying it so shall it be done to the man that kth him and iLab his eldest brother see now the eldest Brothers had enough the passive aggressiveness of the past and all these it's going to erupt all right it's going to erupt because when he heard David talk like this his anger was kindled against David and he said why comest thou down hither amen and and with whom hast thou left thy few sheep those few sheep in the wilderness basically what you've been doing has been no credit to the family you've been doing nothing that's been help he's got a few sheep in the wilderness you have no real responsibility you you don't know what it's like to be like me and David didn't cuz he had god with him he didn't have a spirit of jealousy oh amen but you see he's trying to belittle David he says I Know Thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou might see the battle and David said what have I now done so basically iLab what is it now you've been picking at me and blooding me since I've been anointed by God and you know what have I done now what is it now this is what jealousy jealousy wants to keep undermining under roading pulling down squishing down you know this is what jeal the spirit of jealousy does that's why he says what have I now done what is it now elab blah blah blah jealousy jealousy jealousy you just want see they're all afraid elab is afraid but jealousy will make a person who has the goods will try and pull that person down to be like everyone else so basically elab saying to David just be like us tremble and run there has to be an end of a stalemate there has to be an end of just a status quo we're not called to status quo of living with the devil hey Israel is dismantling Hamas I pray they well they're fighting Spirits they won't be able to do it but if that's the bride in the natural What About Us in the spiritual amen are we are we are we just willing up with fencing the devil off in our lives some when he fires Rockets every so often are we just sick of it and I'm going to dismantle this thing amen I'm going to dismantle everything that's not of God in my life I'm going to let the Holy Spirit amen burn it out I'm going to let him come in take out the tunnels take out the Deep rooted things take out the surface things take out the in between things I'm going to let God take it eradicate It Whatever the cost it's going amen if I've got to confess things I've got to confess things if I've got to look foolish I've got to look I've got to Bear the approach for the word I'm going to Bear the approach if I got to be identified with this word and everyone forsakes me so be it sir I want this I want this demon out of my I want this trouble I want this H my spirit want this thing out of my life amen but you see pride will allow it to remain that's why David said what have I now done see this is what this wasn't the first time eliab just erupted Adam the older brother tried to tried to crush the one who actually had the anointing but you see when you've got the anointing you know that your identity is not in your family anymore though they are your family and you love them and appreciate them you know you're a Son of God or a daughter of God you know you come from God you're going back to God and you know that your father is God your identity is in him it's not in your last name amen it's in your real name as the Bride of Jesus Christ when you really get the anointing you know that's true amen because why he comes to Quicken seed he comes to Quicken his children amen it's not a haphazard thing you receive the Holy Ghost you're predestinated to receive it amen the Bible says in Galatians because you are Sons he sends forth your his Spirit where you cry ABA father my father my father you don't become Sons by the new birth you get born again because you are the Lord hallelujah amen so David David could withstand the criticism amen David could with understand this jealousy Spirit it didn't let him Rob him of his Joy it tries to jealousy wants to destroy any kind of Joy any kind of love anything that's good jealousy wants to just just level the whole thing but you see now jealousy is so crippling it tries to the real believer but it but it cripples the one who's got that spirit because a testimony doesn't mean anything to them anymore I me because as I said earlier that you know they would have been the first ones that would have heard the account of David killing the lion in The Bear they would have seen the Skins they would have seen the you know the marks in the carcass where he slid its throat and all those things they would have seen all those things amen but you see that those testimonies did not impact them because they were jealous they did not rejoice because of what God God delivered a lion and a beer into the hands of David they probably would have been happier if David was dead that's what jealousy does they're only sad when someone's basically dead that's jealousy because you see now when David went into Saul he began to share those same testimonies that his brothers saw see Saul wasn't there when he killed the lion and the bear Saul didn't see the you know uh bear skins and the lion skins and the you know all the he didn't see any of the evidence he just heard that testimony but the brothers saw the evidence and heard the testimony but because of jealousy it didn't impact them at all that's right because it didn't cause him to say hey God delivered those animals into his into his hand let's go get him and he's going to kill this Goliath see David see David you know when you know when his brother said you just got Pride you're arrogant you're naughty in your heart you're Wicked all these things why have you come see David was serving his father that's why he uh ended up there cuz his father Jessy said take this food to your brothers so he was serving in his family doing what the father told him he I can say he was serving the word he was living according to the word how the word wanted him to be but that jealous spirit will not see someone walking in the word amen it will condemn whatever they do if it's contrary to what they're doing amen so you know but you see so you know you're just naughty David said no my you our father said bring this food to you here it is I'm doing what I'm told now what's this guy doing oh no you know but but you see so this testimony that Saul heard caused Saul to have confidence in David that David could kill Goliath but you see those same testimonies didn't mean anything to eliab and his older brothers did not mean anything because of jealousy it nullified the testimony in their old life in their own lives instead of getting the benefit that's why I say if they rallied around and praised God that God anointed one of their brothers as king man they would have been blessed they would have been so blessed amen they' be so blessed to see God use brother way that God did did not ordain for them to be used remember they are still Israelites they are circumcised to the Covenant they were Believers but because jealousy came in it nullified the effects of what God is about to do in their Nation amen so Saul heard these testimonies and it stirred him up to say David you may be a young person God uses young people amen amen God uses young people all the way through the scripture and God still uses young people let no one that's what Timothy was told by Paul let no man despise thy youth he told Timothy that he didn't tell the elders that he told Timothy that CU Timothy was going to be withstood by Elders that were jealous of the gift in Timothy's life and how God was using him amen those were jealous people oh you say but they're Believers yeah Believers can be jealous if they're not born again they can be jealous amen that's right and if we allow those spirits to come in we can become jealous but if we let that if we let God take that out of us yeah God is not jealous in that way that's right amen amen and if God's life is in us we cannot be jealous in that way it's impossible cuz what it's his life within us amen so now there he was he you know David David was you know David testified to King Saul and King Saul said go the Lord be with thee so it impacted King Saul praise God it impacted him and because of that testimony David was selected to go kill Goliath we know he is predestinated to to do the job he knew exactly what to do you see the anointing is misunderstood the anointing is very misunderstood brother Braham said this and why are people so tossed about I thought this is so amazing how this came out this sermon see the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and said the spirit of God is upon me fearth anointed me to preach the acceptable ye to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick to give sight to the blind now we would think if such an anointing was on him had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler yeah but the Bible said he laid down the scroll sat down and precious words proceeded out of from his mouth that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how see that is the anointing to have supreme power un under control or in control knowing exactly what and how I'll say that having the supreme power in control is not you controlling the anointing but the anointing controlling you I mean because the sons of God are led by the spirit of God so it's not us that controls the Holy Ghost if you get in your mind God I want to control your spirit you are wrong you're a luciferian I mean but if you let God live I mean like I think I said it up in Oakland many times people say I've got to the Holy Ghost and that's true but really what you should say is the Holy Ghost needs to get me am me because we are are prisoners to him he is not a prisoner to us amen so sure that's a good thing to say I've got to get the Holy Ghost it should be Lord get me Here I Am Here I Am Lord I lay it all down I Surrender my life completely that you can come and live in my life that's what we need to have amen so it's knowing exactly what and how and it's not it's not saying I think I know it's you know it comes by Revelation it's not guesswork this is not a guesswork Christianity amen the sons of God are live by the spirit of God me my sheep know my voice as stranger they'll not follow I know them by name amen there's a personal relationship between you and God am mean you know his voice you know his leadership it can be different to all of us right like brother B he's Leed by Vision I I don't think I've ever had a vision in my life I've had dreams he spoken to me audibly by voice he's quickened his word to my heart I mean I met you know I've seen dreams that have come to pass those I I've seen those things right I've seen those things but I haven't had a vision like brother R would describe that doesn't mean that I have to have visions to be led by God true cuz however God speaks to you is how he speaks to you and God Made You unique right but you'll see the proof of the pudding is the eating thereof so in other words if he speaks to you he'll bring it to pass and you don't need to make it come to pass he'll bring it to pass amen the Lord so so we got to have confidence in his voice see knowing exactly what and how amen but you see now now what happens is people uh jump to another side and say well what about emotion emotion follows emotion is not the main thing emotion follows right Revelation brings stimulation you get the Revelation then it stimulates you right so when God quickens the word to a heart it brings stimulation it brings a response of a joy and a Hallelujah and a praise God and you may scream and holler and run around the building that's perfectly fine but do it because of Revelation yeah right don't do it just because there's a great atmosphere y y I know many of us and people don't know how to handle the presence of God because it's too great and it should be too great cuz our God is God you know Hallelujah but you see emotion should follow see the anointing is not emotion but it will bring emotion amen and you know if you just read the message any bit you'll see how brother Brown balances all these things he says other saying you know I know she was healed I know he was healed then why can't I be healed certainly you can brother only thing is get the anointing of the Holy Spirit what is it brother Bram take God at his word see he's telling you how to get the anointing take God at his word for by faith are you saved that through Grace and not by works not mental emotions no stir up no speaking with tongue no shouting no nothing by faith walk into the presence of God say Lord God I come solemnly on the basis of your word and I believe you that's how you go by faith walk into his presence say I believe you according to your word amen amen you say brother Braham don't you believe in shouting speaking tongues yes sir but you're putting the cart before the horse amen come to Christ first come to Christ first let the Holy Spirit just take you over start eating from the manner it's good today it's good tomorrow it's good all the time every day amen so don't don't don't just tie emotion with the anointing because we can just feel emotional we are emotional people we share we should have a healthy emotional realm right we're not robots we don't shut down and be all t and tough and whatever no we should feel emotions but the emotions come after was like John when he saw the lamb come forward he saw the revelation of the Lamb coming forth then everything in Heaven and Earth and under the Earth heard him cry out glory and blessing and honor and power be to the lamb why because he saw the meteor to step forth the one who he actually saw on the earth had now stepped forth to claim the book amen so he saw that as a revelation and it made him made the stimulation he made his cup run over hallelujah hallelujah so that's how it should be amen nothing wrong with getting emotional don't shut down and be all stok and dead we're not dead people we're not tombstones we're living stones me filled with the Holy Ghost amen so but you see and don't get all tense about it just enjoy God Amen see cuz I I can see people's minds already analyzing well am I too emotional and am I emotional before and you know how does this work and how should I feel right now just enjoy God Amen just relax and let God minister to us Amen Let God flow let God live Amen Let God be God Amen and and God will take care of all those things just love him amen amen but you see we are not we are not bound by impression amen Impressions will lead us anyway all right amen sometimes we find that someone spoke in tongues the other one wants to imitate him they'll speak in tongues too one sees one give interpretation the other says I've got it too and you go by Impressions then say thus sayith the lord well that's wrong and God will never move you any further what you are right now just an organiz ation until you get out of that you can be a oneman organization a mean being led by impression trying to imitate amen what God is doing in someone genuine you've got to get out of that mode you see Saul trained David's older brothers they would have tried to be imitators right but God trained David in the wilderness amen so they had to get away from that ecclesiastical training to walk with God amen amen so you say but be sure where are we now you might not like me now but at the day of judgment you'll love me see be sure don't say it unless God says so and you know that it is the truth that God said so not your opinion not uh but not some impression because you can be impressed any way so we can't go well I feel the Lord said no he either says it or not right and if he says it it happens amen and we should be man or woman enough to say I was wrong amen God loves honesty right because we can be Leed by like for example you know you know we were we were we downstairs when Gabriel was dedicated with downstairs a I had such a strong feeling my family's complete you can be impressed anyway I the first two Analise and Lilia though dedicated and I thought no no there's more to come and then Here Comes Here Comes Gabriella the family's done we are done no I was wrong praise God I was wrong but we can't be so fixated on I feel your feelings will do this all around and that's what the charismatic Pentecostal church is I feel this and I feel that this could be this in Prophecy and all these things we've had a Vindicated Prophet coming this day he's given us thus sayith the Lord we know where we are the message shows us where we are in time amen we're waiting for the coming of the Lord the bride is making yourself ready amen here we are remember the only way to stand for Israel is get into your position as the bride and go on the Rapture that is the only way sympathy Facebook posts anything else will not help them we must get out of the way cuz when we leave amen the two prophets come and Grace is restored back to them and God will fight for his people amen that's how it has to be amen so you want to stand for this world get in the word surrender to the Holy Ghost and let him control you and let him form you into the image of the word that's the only way to help this world you care about the environment get into the word become one with the Lord Jesus Christ you care about this world do that amen that's the one thing we must do believe on the Lord Jesus Christ thine and thy house shall be saved amen that is absolutely essential amen see for as many are as led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God does not say as many are led by Impressions amen no they're led by the spirit of God Amen my sheep know my voice amen so we're not led by impression we're led by thus sayith the Lord amen and you should have confidence when God tells you something it's amen amen that's praise the Lord you know because it comes to pass amen praise the Lord just like years ago when I finally got the Revelation that I was going to marry Christine about at least a year after the Lord told her I said praise God I'm going to get married I knew it was going to happen I didn't have to guess I was reading Proverbs who whosoever findeth a wife find a good thing that obtained favor of the Lord and the Lord spoke to me and said that's Christine I didn't have to now make it happen even though of course you know you do everything right but you know I didn't have to like go there and move there and you no you rest in God's timing you rest in God's leadership right just like the Lord said the first prayer meeting we ever had if you remain humble my word will continue to go forth and I'll bring people here and they'll find rest and we and we've seen that come to pass I know you're beneficiaries of that amen it did not say and they would become just message people no they would enter into rest they' receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they would really know him Hallelujah now that doesn't mean we had to go to the streets and compel and do all these things no God brought everyone sovereignly in different ways over different times amen hallelujah but you see now jealousy jealousy doesn't have confidence in the leadership of God jealousy only has confidence in keeping the status quo wow and you see we cannot we cannot trust in Impressions because it says here in James but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a sea uh a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord so another shall as in might no a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so if you think it it might happen you become unstable the Lord could do it no amen hallelujah do you believe it it's not a fear it might not happen we got to get all that out of us see the devil the devil always puts a question mark on God's word right are you all following me today I know you're kind of thinking about these things and you know if I look you in the eye I'm not making a point at you I'm just looking you in the eye okay so don't take it personally right but you see we can't be unstable if God said it that settles it like brother Burley said if God said it that settles it right so if God has given us a promise that settles it how when I don't know but he'll do it yes if he quickens it to you you amen amen never ever approach god with a maybe you can Lord no it's yay and the promises of God a yay and amen amen because if you begin to doubt the word and the devil loves to try and put doubt upon the word you become double-minded unstable in all of your ways we don't want to be unstable amen we want to walk with God now but you see now Saul himself had a jealous spirit and he had a complex of the family he came out of yeah but you see see and you and and Samuel answered Saul and said I am a I am the SE God before me un the high place for ye shall eat with me today and tomorrow I'll let thee go and tell thee all that is in thine heart and as for thine asses that thou lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of Israel is it not on thee and on all thy father's house remember God told Samuel to anoint Saul King right and Saul answered and said am I not a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel and my family the least of all the families of The Tribe of Benjamin wherefore then speaketh thou so to me see he came out of the smallest tribe the smallest family out of the smallest tribe but his job was to unite all the 12 tribes under one headship God will use those who come out of unlikely backgrounds but I came out of a broken home I never knew my father I never knew my mother I never knew I never had siblings I never had a stable home life you this is basically what Saul's saying he's trying to bring a he he's trying to bring forth his insecurities and insecurities bring forth jealousy it's a beating ground for jealousy to bloom amen but do you see God called uh Saul to be king and if he just stuck with that commission where he came from would not have mattered why because God wasn't calling him to stay in that to be known by that he was to be known as King Saul just like you and I we're not to be known by where we came from our background our upbringing whatever trouble has happened I'm not diminishing those things not one bit but those things should never identify us they should not be our our name amen we are not Mr or Mrs broken home trouble past pull it a post whatever more we're not those people amen no we are the redeemed Sons and Daughters of God washed in the blood of the Lamb amen we are M Jesus Christ he has called us by a high and holy calling am me to stand by his sideen but you see Saul because of this insecurity am mean it bred it bred a complex it bred a jealousy in his life but look at this now his father was a mighty man of power his man his father was a mighty man he came out of actually Incredible family if you think about this is this is this is the family that God would allow him to be born into to to train him to be a king amen his father wasn't a weakling he wasn't a boy he was a mighty man of power amen and he had a son now now even look at Saul see he was a choice young man and goodly and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he for his shoulders and upward he is higher than any of the people so he so he he looked like a king you say well but but he was never ordained to be king because he came out of the wrong tribe now if Saul didn't have any jealousy about him when when when Samuel told him that the kingdom was going to be taken from him if he had no jealousy he'd be like okay who's the next king let me let me prepare for him to stand on this you know let me let me lay a platform for this next king I mean that it's not a big amount of trouble that when he steps on the throne but be such a smooth transition y y he could say to Jonathan Jonathan I've ruined my testimony I have I I've gone against the word of God and God's rejected me but Jonathan someone else is going to become king I don't know who but when that person is called you stand by that man and Jonathan we're going to prepare this Kingdom that when that man comes to the position it's going to be a seamless transition because remember David wasn't a jealous man and when God told David that he he wasn't going to build the temple he didn't throw his toys he didn't have a hissy foot he began to prepare and bring material and bring everything that when Solomon came to the throne he could start building the Temple he didn't sit there and say I'm not sharing the because you know David got the plans eh yes he had the plans God showed him how to build it he didn't you when God said you're not building this he didn't he didn't he had no jealousy in him because he didn't say well no I'm not sharing this with anyone you ordered this wood from here forget it send it back break these Stones up you know empty the coffers you know we're going to spend no no he didn't do that but jealousy will burn everything around it yeah right but he wasn't a jealous believer CU he was a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah Lord amen but you see so so that's how we should be amen now I know time's running away but I'm just going to run with it so now as we said now jealousy came from Satan and when the first worship came worship spiritual worship produces jealousy we may not like to admit it but it produces jealousy testimonies produce jealousy amen not for the believer but for the unbeliever the make believer so now here we are we have Cain and Abel they have you know comes to the process of time when they realize you know that they're Fallen they live in a fallen state that Jehovah God made all things and they want to approach God they want to worship God they want to have communion with God that's why you build a family altar I mean that's why they built their altars because they wanted to have communion with God and now so here's able he brings his lamb you know Cain's already brought his fruit and whatever he brought you know and you know and then and and then they're worshiping and then God comes down and receives Abel's sacrifice now if Cain was actually the son of Adam he would have rallied around Abel's sacrifice wouldn't that been amazing they have you know it's like you're having a prayer meeting at home and then one of your family breaks through into the anointing amen and' be like hallelujah praise God you know you'd be so happy you know if one of my girls were all praying and they break through and start shouting and the anointing comes down and they start and and you know it's not them praying it's God praying through them you know if you're a jealous parent God forbid that I'm looking at anyone on this camera or here that's like that if you're jealous you'd say no no they're too young they don't deserve that that's not right they do these things oh wow that's jealousy that's Cain yes right but you know if he was the son of Adam he would have been ring around Abel you broke through God came down accepted your sacrifice the god that our parents told us about has come down into our church we're not having just a dead formal worship anymore but now the anointing of Jehovah has come down hallelujah how can I gather and rally around what you're doing how can I help out how can I become part of the move of God hallelujah but you see Cain got mad didn't make him happy it just made him angry it made made him angry now remember Cain it says here by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain so Cain's sacrifice wasn't a haphazard thing it wasn't just a casual he was sincere he believed in God he was not an atheist he wasn't an idol worshipper he really believed in God he really believed in God but you see so so Abel so he had an excellent sacrifice but Abel's was more excellent because Abels was by Revelation I mean it wasn't by human ability and and and and just a you know a feel lad kind of you know presuming kind of a thing no he had Revelation it was blood and it was a lamb amen so now but you see it caused jealousy to rise up and Cain so you now notice it's always the natural to hate the spiritual it causes Cain to hate Abel it caused cor to hate Moses it caused Judas to hate Jesus and on and on it goes It goes the natural to hate the spiritual just as Cain at the beginning hated Abel the one that God received the Sacrifice from and tried to destroy the them even they try to destroy the influence they try to destroy everything because it's nothing but jealousy it started in Cain it proved it with jealousy and it's still the same thing today I mean when the natural the carnal and the spiritual meet together it proves it Satan nother way because jealousy comes from Satan and then it causes an impersonation of the truth somebody to try and do to impersonate something that it isn't they're not ordained to do how much of it have we seen in the last days oh how much of it amen you see now but by by God vindicating Abel by coming down receiving a sacrifice that caused jealousy with Cain because he was jealous of his brother and he slew his brother that's what jealousy will do you say well I haven't stuck a knife in anyone but have you killed their influence have you murdered their influence to someone else that's history is repeating itself amen amen but you see Saul going back to Saul so that was just in Cain and Abel Cain was jealous because God did not accept his sacrif but then even God came down and spoke to Cain just do like your brother did you know there's no record of God ever speaking to Abel in the Bible but he has a conversation with Cain that's how much actually God cared about Cain so listen forget the fruit Cain get a lamb did you see God did you see me vindicate look I know what I'm talking about because I'm The Vindicator of the word if I can put words in God's mouth I'm The Vindicator of the word I put that Revelation in Abel and then Abel manifested that Revelation and then I Vindicated that revelation Yeah by by receiving the sacrifice so K I didn't even need to give you the Revelation you saw it work just go do what your brother did you'll be accepted by me it's it's you know it's easy but you see even jealousy jealousy overrode God's intervention God help us where we get to a point if we ever get to a point we become jealous of anyone that God can't actually guide us anymore and it's our carnal nature Rises up and just kills the spirit God help us am we never want to get to that point or even near that point you feel jealousy or resentment against anyone you get to your knees and pray amen right then and there you feel any order against anyone CU they do well or whatever happens don't don't hold on to it amen that's one thing like a lot of things my wife tells me goes in one ear out the other right it should be the same thing with that kind of thing should go in and out yes am have no beding ground in the middle yes but you see now Saul Saul was jealous he failed to Rally around the gift that came into his kingdom because remember when David when they returned from the slaughter of the Philistines see the women came out of all the city singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tabrets with joy with instruments of music and the woman answered one another as they played saying Saul has slain his thousands and David his 10, thousands and see it didn't make Saul happy wouldn't that make you happy we got a champion in our mid hallelujah hallelujah we got God's champion no it's it's not him Saul wasn't happy he it it made him very wroth and the same displeased him and see and he said they have ascribed unto David 10, thousands to me they've ascribed but thousands but and what can he but have but more um and sorry what can he have but more but the kingdom and Saul I David from that day and forward so it's Once Upon a Time David's testimony moved David uh moved Saul but now because of jealousy even that doesn't matter anymore yes you see jealousy is often rooted in insecurities and fears that a person may not even realize they have these could uh include a fear of oversimplification fears of inadequacy fears of Abandonment fears of being replaced and fear of being judged just like Saul we're not Sauls I don't believe amen praise the Lord I feel like I'm getting my point across amen but you see this is what always happens this is what jealousy will do because of because of an insecurity within the individual they can become jealous there's nothing wrong with what God's doing it's within them and they hold on but that insecurity becomes their identity see if Saul just moved with the plan of God the insecurity would have left because he would have realized hey someone else is going to become king praise God we're going to have a transition we're going to do things that aren't normally done in kingdoms amen but because of jealousy he held on to it to The Bitter End and he died of failure amen we don't want to be like that Hallelujah yeah even says of Jesus that pilate knew that for Envy they delivered him to be crucified so because of jealousy they had the Messiah crucified see because why when Jesus came he upset all the tradition he upset human Church order hey God has a church order humans have church order right that's why I said he upset all the human Church order amen he did things that the scribes and Pharisees didn't even want to do they didn't want to deliver the people they didn't want to you know know set people free from all the bondage they actually laid them on with rules and regulations had nothing to do with the word of God Amen and they did but even they said we know you're a teacher come from God but the more Jesus did the more angry they became the more blinded they became amen it's amazing that after after um Lazarus was raised from the dead then they would have the meeting that they would you know what are we going to do about him this man does so many miracles and then caias you know and all they worried about was their was their standing we know if he you know if we let him alone all men will believe on him and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and Nation how do they know that but jealousy see jealousy wants to keep its position and that jeal and that position is actually nine times out of 10 of fantasy really when Saul was rejected King he was no longer King so he was living in a fantasy world that I'm King he wasn't king no more I mean the scribes and Pharisees they worried about their position being taken their position wasn't even God's position anymore cuz they had moved from the the word of God true tradition amen so they're all worried about a and and that's how people can be in church we can have a wrong idea of our position in the church we're just coming on home amen but you see we can't live in a fantasy world see gifts always gifts make room for themselves amen but you see now caias said you know one man must die foration so I'm just kind of speeding up a bit and it says now after they after they after caias has prophesied these things amen it says then from that day forward they took counsel together to put him to death he had raised Lazarus from the grave he didn't just say I'm resurrection and life he proved it a man four days in the grave never been done before amen praise God you would have man could you imagine a man who looks like any other man just walks into the building and then by the end of that service every trouble we have sickness spiritual what it's gone and then we have lunch and we begin to pull apart that guy and say how terrible he is and how offended we are that he came and did that that's what the Jews did with Jesus he came into the synagogues own's crippled or whatever on the Sabbath day heals them they get mad the been sitting in church for years I don't know how long and they just that jealousy will keep that person there that's how bad jealousy is cuz they're jealous of what Jesus would do and then when Jesus came in and actually set that free they weren't rejoicing saying thank you Rabbi we were praying for him we we knew God would come one day we'd heal them we're so happy for this this is the greatest moment of the synagogue is that you the Messiah would come in our midst and you'd heal this man You' set this one free of this evil spirit Lord you would do these things we've been praying and longing for it to happen would one day see the day and now we see the day they weren't like that they got mad yeah but we're in the message we're not exempt from these things we're still people religious Spirits are not a respector of Doctrine or belief amen they took counsel together to put him to death amen you see now we don't want to ever come to a place that jealousy destroys our Christian walk amen where where someone else begins to receive the word we don't get offended at it see jealousy gets offended when someone else tries to come in and they want to meet God cuz because jealousy wants to keep everything the same and if that person doesn't match what we think we are they're out we're all growing hallelujah amen some of us are growing out some of us are growing up but we're all growing Lord spiritually we're all growing I just put a joke in there cuz I feel a bit of you know let's just calm down a bit you know we're all growing the person you were a week ago you're not that person today the person you were a year ago you're not that person today give our kids a chance let them make mistakes as brother Arman said let them but let's guide them when they do but jealousy wants to keep them on the floor and tell them why they're wrong and that they're wrong and I'll stay wrong let's not be that way let's see all the Lord wants to do when we Fallen Sinners pick us up dust us off and walk us on that's all he cares about are you okay Lord I've done this it's all right you've repented my blood covers it your just keep walking I'm so discouraged Lord but just keep you can do it how many times see like William pling Lego he's trying to put the things together he gets all upset I said no just do it like this jealous was said well you're too young you don't deserve that did no we're here to help one another amen amen we're here we're here to grow right amen but a jealous Spirit doesn't want anyone to grow you got to quote my quotes and say my scriptures if you don't agree with me you're out and I'm above you jealousy always elevates someone above the other people no if we are the master of all the servant of all amen but you see when the Jews they rejoicing when Paul was opening the scriptures to them but when the G genes came in they were filled with jealousy these people have no right to come in I've been in church all my life and these people come in and get excited how dare they jealousy if someone's if someone's enjoying the Lord I want to I want some of that amen tell me what's making you happy it'll make me happy too sir someone shouting let's shout you know let's what's go you know I'm going to be part of what's going on amen that's right amen I trust you feel that way you see Colin coming he's man he's just head Overhill so happy I'm like praise God I want to I want that to rub off on me I mean see that spark 70 years old the word come alive to him it's like praise God Amen y let's just celebrate that amen let's not push that down well you know but let's just enjoy it amen let's just see it grow and you know someone someone told me years ago well enjoy your enthusiasm or your Zeal while at last I thought no come on no we should get more zealous we should enjoy the Lord more you know just because someone's had a hard Road you know in the Lord there's a reason for that that God wants to use that to help others amen all of our walks are for a purpose praise God don't be jealous of someone who just seems to just that you know just like they everything just turns out right for them be happy for those people oh but they're going to fall eventually no that's jealousy we're not here to wait for fails this is not watching some ridiculous YouTube video of top 10 fails or you know this is not Christianity amen amen amen see now we can make ourselves nothing we can't make Bishops and Prophets and so forth we can't you can't manufacture it it's got to be born in you got to be the spirit of God predestinated from the foundation of the world God said in the church God did what he did and when they try to impersonate we lose our influence oh Church listen it's like a ball game this is now he's talking about American football somebody's um somebody at a ball game somebody gets the ball and every one of their own players tries to take the ball right from away from them you can't win the game game be a guard guard the ball don't try and take it away from the next man glory to God if he can do it over here and and this um but sorry glory to God if he can do it over here on this corner God bless him I'm a Oneness I can do it I'm a trinitarian I can do it I he ain't got no business doing that you're knocking the ball out of your own players's hand all of you Methodist Baptists Presbyterians lutherans Oneness Tess threeness if you're riding a one hump camel two hump camel if you got a dozen humps what difference does it make let's let's all come to this well a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins where sin is plunged beneath the flood let's guard the ball this is the ball amen the holy spirit is trying to pack it it'll condemn communism it'll condemn sin it'll condemn unrighteousness it'll and it'll manifest and glorify Jesus Christ and bring his person into the midst of the people amen sure amen no yes sir so if someone's being blessed don't try and block his b don't try and take his Blessing from him or her someone's rejoicing don't try and oh wait till I'm going to talk I'm going to straighten them out no that's jealousy don't don't try and squish what God is doing am we're here to plant and water am me we're here to cultivate let God grow amen if someone if the young people have a Revival amen amen I'm going to celebrate that a lot I'm going to celebrate that heaps amen if the old people have a Revival I'm going to celebrate that heaps amen if we all have a Revival I'm going to celebrate that peaps I'm not going to try and knock the ball from their hand I'm not going to try and squish them down amen if they run around the church cuz God's anointed them I'm not going to stop it amen that's right amen if it's God doing it I'm happy with that amen so you know we don't want to try and knock the ball out of someone's hand by just an off-hand comment that's just a condescending thing amen no we want to guard the one with the ballen Hallelujah who's ever seen that American football there everyone's running to try and block the one who's running and the one running can be the smallest guy but there's you know who's seen that we should be like that who's ever packing the ball let's guard that person let's pray for them let's encourage them amen let's strengthen one another that's how you that's how you block amen lift them up in prayer encourage them amen that's all we should doise the Lord hallelujah he says I may not be able this is just in closing I may not be able to make every promise manifested in my life I may not be able to make it manifested to someone else's life but I'll never stand in the way of anybody who can do it I'll be for them am I'll pray for them I may not be able to walk with Joshua did with a shout that shook the walls of Jericho and neither May able to walk with Enoch who took an afternoon stroll one day with God and went all the way home with him I may not I I might not be able to have that type of Faith but I'm contending for that Faith amen and believing it with all my heart and praying that God will give that Faith quickly because that's the way his church is going home one day a little afternoon stroll and the Rapture will be on and will be gone amen amen so we should be contending for that faith amen jealousy will not contend for that Faith jealousy will drive the spirit of God from this church that's right don't be jealous don't throw people off a cliff and be the ambulance at the bottom well I'm helping them but when they're doing well you want to destroy them but now I'm helping them I'm a good person now you're jealous so we never want to be jealous see we we're all gifted differently I can't do your job you can't do my job neither one of us are better than the other we're all the body of Christ all the same right we don't have ones above the others we're all there's no big eyes and small use and all we're all the same but you see jealousy will try and Elevate let's not be like that amen if you have any jealousy in your heart let's have the musicians come please tonight I mean this morning I just want to close with this thought if you feel jealousy that's Satan you don't need to keep it you can let it go you have ought against someone cuz they're doing well or whatever more you need to get rid of that thing amen this is not a time to be jealous the Lord jealousy has no place in the Christian's life am it is not it should be so foreign if you feel any order against someone you should be shocked when that thought comes into your mind it should trouble you it should bother you real bad why do I feel this way against this brother or sister why do I feel so annoyed and you know they're happy but I'm just so annoyed they're happy why you know are they doing well I'm just so that's not fair I should be see that's jealousy we should not feel that
