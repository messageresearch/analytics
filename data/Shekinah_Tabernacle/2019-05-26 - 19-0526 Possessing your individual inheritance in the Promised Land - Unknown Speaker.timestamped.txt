[1:02:42] with appreciation with worship we just
[1:02:46] forget about ourselves we lay everything
[1:02:50] just at the door there when we come in
[1:02:51] here I'm just getting the spirit and
[1:02:54] look at the profits or say it said in a
[1:02:57] in a transmission he said what's going
[1:03:02] about John see he wasn't the spirit on
[1:03:04] the last day
[1:03:05] now remember the first thing you have to
[1:03:08] do is what get in the spirit so that is
[1:03:13] the battle the devil will no want to do
[1:03:16] that and remember remind you everything
[1:03:19] that's going on for the week and try to
[1:03:22] wear you down and the person is
[1:03:26] struggling physically suddenly that will
[1:03:28] be strong to get in the spirit and you
[1:03:30] manage to come to a level and they so
[1:03:32] struggling and the puzzle will come but
[1:03:35] we are not here to be for somebody to
[1:03:40] check us off we're here to actually pull
[1:03:42] down the prints of God amen
[1:03:46] all right so so I said
[1:03:48] now remind the first the first the first
[1:03:50] thing you have to do is what get in the
[1:03:53] spirit house this revelation is going to
[1:03:57] ever come to you get in the spirit how
[1:04:02] how are you ever going to get the Holy
[1:04:04] Ghost and I believe and there's no
[1:04:09] question that the most important thing
[1:04:13] for everyone here good young and old for
[1:04:18] young people I want to just like menisci
[1:04:20] I'm looking for this afternoon I'm sure
[1:04:23] we don't have a wonderful time it's
[1:04:24] afternoon but it's a privilege that you
[1:04:26] have yet you are born you are in this
[1:04:29] church I don't mean this building I
[1:04:32] don't mean this physical building you
[1:04:35] are in under the blood they took the
[1:04:40] fullness of the word you may not you
[1:04:43] don't have to understand everything
[1:04:44] don't don't unless they don't have to
[1:04:47] answer everything just have to believe
[1:04:50] now and those those top of maybe your
[1:04:55] parents and message and have the body
[1:04:57] message that they're growing up don't
[1:04:59] just stop at that because God is not a
[1:05:01] grandparent it's a father okay so so
[1:05:05] you're not going to go in the ticket of
[1:05:07] your father amen
[1:05:10] so you got your own ticket but well
[1:05:13] don't ever be discouraged
[1:05:15] don't ever stop to listen to what the
[1:05:17] devil has to say but I bleep was do it
[1:05:20] testimony said that when they will open
[1:05:22] this lie is mouth he does what he lies
[1:05:24] and how would you deal I if it's not in
[1:05:29] line with the word simple and short amen
[1:05:33] so what am I trying to say you don't
[1:05:37] stop our truth ever stop until you get
[1:05:40] the Holy Ghost and if you have the Holy
[1:05:43] Ghost don't stop until I revealed
[1:05:47] because the dynamics of this church will
[1:05:51] be the Baptist the Holy Ghost which we
[1:05:53] are work in a measure so we needed
[1:05:55] dynamics to keep us going
[1:05:59] amen all right so so so it's a hard you
[1:06:03] ever going to get the Holy Ghost get in
[1:06:05] the spirit
[1:06:06] get in the spirit when you when you were
[1:06:09] sinner and you went to dance you got
[1:06:12] industrial all mine you started clapping
[1:06:15] them hands I'm patting your feet and
[1:06:17] she's digging and train your heart of
[1:06:19] the floor I am doing I run a run
[1:06:21] acting silly you was in the spirit of it
[1:06:25] just give us idea you know what it means
[1:06:27] you know that kind of thing could you
[1:06:29] imagine a fellow was they dance field
[1:06:31] going to a dance say well I'm you having
[1:06:34] her a pretty good time I suppose
[1:06:36] oh they say you wore flowered out of
[1:06:40] here go other can you say go at the
[1:06:44] ballgame somebody in rocking home run
[1:06:46] and some and something another set and
[1:06:50] look and somebody set on look and say
[1:06:52] well that's pretty pretty good yeah he
[1:06:57] won't be able baseball fan horror fan
[1:07:00] you know you wouldn't be real you
[1:07:02] wouldn't be in the spirit of baseball
[1:07:04] when somebody knocks in homerun you
[1:07:06] raise up and roll out who my win you
[1:07:10] knock somebody off this he said and and
[1:07:12] nobody nobody sees that ain't about
[1:07:14] about it why did I have a good shot in
[1:07:16] the spirit of the then you say oh no
[1:07:21] brother Isis isn't it it's in the field
[1:07:26] you know football field well Brom said
[1:07:29] then in the church when you get in the
[1:07:32] spirit reserve and horror movie
[1:07:35] hallelujah present Lord Holy Roller was
[1:07:46] over the wood I'm good as a question if
[1:07:52] we are holy rollers because we do that
[1:07:55] their names are on holy rollers out
[1:07:58] there I rather be a Holy Roller who
[1:08:02] taught you
[1:08:03] I'm reading that Anthony at that I'm a
[1:08:07] holy roller
[1:08:08] my certainly may be you know was trying
[1:08:12] to
[1:08:12] what about John in the other pod
[1:08:14] partners maybe he was dancing and
[1:08:16] jumping running around the island was
[1:08:19] having a good time it wasn't his spirit
[1:08:22] that may sound since our previous
[1:08:24] problem said but I don't mean it that
[1:08:26] way
[1:08:27] see he could that well he might be doing
[1:08:32] that I believe he was having a good time
[1:08:34] in the spirit just praising God because
[1:08:38] that's exactly what happened when this
[1:08:41] beautiful only only on them on this
[1:08:43] first place when the hooligans fell on
[1:08:47] them they staggered like drunken men and
[1:08:50] women and other led they were drunk
[1:08:53] jabbering and Cairo led out to the booze
[1:08:56] said this will are full of new wine
[1:08:58] that's the way they acted in the first
[1:09:01] time so the spirit come again he
[1:09:05] probably will act the same way see
[1:09:08] there's nothing new about this
[1:09:13] hallelujah so it's not a new present
[1:09:16] Lord hallelujah he said this is the
[1:09:18] old-time religion give me that old-time
[1:09:21] religion give me that old-time religion
[1:09:24] give me that old-time religion is true
[1:09:28] and now for me that would touch a world
[1:09:31] but give me Jesus hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:34] oh man you so well in itself it's it's
[1:09:41] on this earth what do you know I told
[1:09:43] you but in heaven guys shouting amen
[1:09:48] and also he hell there is noise it's not
[1:09:54] so Christ said there will be there will
[1:09:56] be weeping and gnashing their teeth not

[1:10:03] choose to be because you just kept the
[1:10:05] noise right all right praise the Lord
[1:10:09] so we are in heavenly places amen in
[1:10:12] heavenly places we're having a good time
[1:10:14] with the Lord

[1:10:22] the cannot see get in when seated

[1:10:31] I'm sorry I diluted give him some time
[1:10:34] to this because I will not get to my
[1:10:36] message but that is fine if I can read
[1:10:38] that's fine also
[1:10:40] so Barbara was saying this it's it's any
[1:10:43] sooner its own experience it deep cut to
[1:10:46] the deep I remember on an instant
[1:10:49] standing there if you pardon me for
[1:10:51] leave my subject I'm a planning they're
[1:10:53] watching and seeing the rainbow and I
[1:10:55] wept you might say I got worked up
[1:10:58] emotionally maybe I did what I got
[1:11:02] crying I couldn't help it not because I
[1:11:05] was sad because I was happy here in the
[1:11:09] wolf Cola or his central that all led me
[1:11:14] to this to see the rainbow and I
[1:11:16] remember in the in the rainbow he gave a

[1:11:24] rainbows the Alpha and Omega how his
[1:11:27] promise is true Christ it never fail he
[1:11:31] had he had anchored me in his kingdom
[1:11:33] homina uncle today who the law ma not by
[1:11:39] my own works but by the grace he had
[1:11:42] called me superb and was going to this
[1:11:46] and sometimes happening by for knowledge
[1:11:49] he had elected yeah he brought me in and
[1:11:53] all that comes to me he will receive
[1:11:55] raise him up in the last day this
[1:11:58] promises and I got to weeping so he ran

[1:12:56] but the Lord he was the one I was
[1:13:00] blessing anyway and around the tree I
[1:13:03] went around around again and again and I
[1:13:06] guess if someone would have come they

[1:14:40] would say though I was what he thought I
[1:14:42] was crazy so I want to put a
[1:14:44] straitjacket but I was just screaming to
[1:14:46] the top of my voice and after a while it
[1:14:48] look okay so some
[1:14:50] experient interrupted him and so and so
[1:14:53] forth
[1:14:53] now now as we pass through this journey
[1:14:57] let us remember that our lap down
[1:15:05] creates we planned the day God knew the
[1:15:14] day you are conceived in a modest room
[1:15:16] with a we call you home is already
[1:15:18] arranged everything
[1:15:20] amen he will not tell you what's going
[1:15:23] to happen between them it is the matter
[1:15:27] doesn't matter up and down no troubles
[1:15:29] and one it doesn't matter it's only
[1:15:31] going to work his way to bring it to the
[1:15:33] end and so what they say what's what I'm
[1:15:36] saying things are too to be so your
[1:15:39] breath here
[1:15:40] was horribly plant creeping pre-planned
[1:15:43] so what do you worry about what we did
[1:15:46] was sleep about I guess you believe that
[1:15:48] every one of you knows that our birth
[1:15:51] here was pre-planned did you know that
[1:15:54] your being here never altered or related
[1:15:58] just as a myth or as a thought
[1:16:00] everything was all pre planned by God
[1:16:06] before the first of the world that you
[1:16:11] will be here so God knows that I am a
[1:16:15] family the song we call New Zealand
[1:16:18] about 20-something
[1:16:20] hours of flight away from home what am I
[1:16:23] doing here I don't know what I believe
[1:16:27] I mean the will of God
[1:16:29] and I'm happy that's one happy Lord let
[1:16:33] me be in your will my daily prayer Lord
[1:16:36] if you allow me to leave
[1:16:38] well maybe one more day may every meet
[1:16:41] of heat come for Jesus amen hallelujah
[1:16:47] okay so pre-plan did you know that you
[1:16:50] will be your being here okay so so going
[1:16:55] down the evil god node and to be
[1:17:00] infinite he had to know every flea that
[1:17:04] ever would be in the earth and how many
[1:17:07] times to eat to about his eye
[1:17:09] that's infinite see you our little minds
[1:17:15] cannot fathom what it means the infinite
[1:17:19] God he knew all things before there's
[1:17:23] nothing so therefore that of cater with
[1:17:28] the Lord and I don't believe that the
[1:17:32] person just happened to be here by
[1:17:33] chance I mean we have to get this not
[1:17:38] just think when you come to the world
[1:17:41] everything okay
[1:17:43] when you come to the world everything
[1:17:44] had for prepared for you prepare rather
[1:17:49] than for you I don't have to understand
[1:17:52] that how that we could think that God
[1:17:55] that a God that could prepare all these
[1:17:57] things for us would not or we could not
[1:18:02] put trust in him if he brought us in
[1:18:06] this chaos and we are in and prepare the
[1:18:09] good things of life for us here how much
[1:18:12] more can we trust him to repair the
[1:18:16] thing that is to come see if the know
[1:18:19] things now talking about the promised
[1:18:22] land
[1:18:23] amen because it tell you this morning my
[1:18:26] correspondence possessing your image
[1:18:28] inheritance in the promised land so God
[1:18:30] has already given you the promise and
[1:18:33] it's your inheritance what will get you
[1:18:36] step forward amen
[1:18:39] and sober brand was saying about about K
[1:18:42] about about Kanan and said what the
[1:18:44] natural de lecture the promise to Israel
[1:18:47] the natural and kena right but ours is
[1:18:50] spiritual promise
[1:18:51] amen and he says a Canaan does not
[1:18:55] present age of millennium it only
[1:18:58] represents the age of the overcomer amen
[1:19:03] the edge of hell disposition of
[1:19:09] overcoming because in Canaan they killed
[1:19:12] and bone and took cities and there will
[1:19:14] be no death in Bellino right and another
[1:19:18] thing it does it brings us justification
[1:19:21] by faith after they believed in Moses
[1:19:24] for me and they left Egypt so they
[1:19:27] believe are justified and they left
[1:19:29] Egypt and that was sonification to
[1:19:34] follow order the pillar of fire and I
[1:19:36] torment of a sacrificial lamb in witness
[1:19:38] and then enter into the land they have
[1:19:41] been promised now the camp will twist
[1:19:51] three stages come to this from its land
[1:19:54] now watch is family tap in the New
[1:19:56] Testament there was twisted using the
[1:19:58] journey and there's three stages in the
[1:20:01] journey for we are justified by faith
[1:20:03] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:20:06] second the land of Egypt will come out
[1:20:10] and then our son defied to the orphan of
[1:20:12] the blood washed from our saints and
[1:20:15] become pilgrims and surgeons claiming
[1:20:17] that we are all sick in a land a city
[1:20:21] that's coming or a promise all right so
[1:20:24] the Israel and in in wilderness sajin is
[1:20:27] no place of rest traveling night and day
[1:20:30] following the pure fire well finally
[1:20:33] country promised land where they settle
[1:20:35] down the Ark's where the believer comes
[1:20:37] he comes first to recognition that he is
[1:20:41] a sinner and the and then he is
[1:20:44] separated by the waters the washing of
[1:20:47] the water by the blood amen
[1:20:52] by Washington what by the world rather
[1:20:56] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ then
[1:20:58] being justified by faith it because
[1:21:00] petechiae and the peace with God true
[1:21:04] sirs Christ baptizing in love Jesus
[1:21:07] Christ - to permit him to enter the
[1:21:11] journey you get it into the journey then
[1:21:13] he he becomes a sojourner and a pilgrim
[1:21:15] he's he is on his journey - what a
[1:21:19] promise that God made okay
[1:21:23] so Israel had not yet received the
[1:21:25] promise birthday we only journey
[1:21:28] so please understand
[1:21:31] and he was right the Companions arena
[1:21:33] premiums and you know how how did they
[1:21:36] fell but Israel when they when they come
[1:21:39] to the sport of California when the
[1:21:41] spies went out and said the land is
[1:21:44] great but some of them came back and
[1:21:46] said we can take it because the cities
[1:21:49] are wardrobe and so forth but Joshua and
[1:21:52] Caleb stood and said we are more able to
[1:21:56] take amen
[1:21:58] so what the Word of God will simply say
[1:22:00] the promises a male that God given to
[1:22:03] you the devil is will come to the
[1:22:05] fractions of the flesh see smell taste
[1:22:13] feel that here to discourage you it will
[1:22:17] come true to the fashions of the Spirit
[1:22:19] conscience memory affection reasoning
[1:22:24] limit to discourage you but Caleb and
[1:22:28] usual look beyond amen and saw the
[1:22:31] promise amen while the others are giants
[1:22:36] so the open opposition
[1:22:39] Oprah's on a giant Caleb and Joshua saw
[1:22:43] them as grasshoppers
[1:22:45] and say if you love you be with us and
[1:22:48] have your question
[1:22:49] this one is a lot yet this morning well
[1:22:53] you said we're to India and we is
[1:22:57] something happens so I'd be smaller if
[1:23:01] you are hungry for the Holy Ghost you
[1:23:03] cap that we're coming to that you go
[1:23:06] we'll give it to you and I want to I
[1:23:09] want to toast many young people you get
[1:23:12] this when the Holy Ghost well you need
[1:23:14] it and I tell you why I was listen now
[1:23:17] listen to what abruptly post testimony
[1:23:19] I'm saying because he said it so it's in
[1:23:24] YouTube so is Naboo bomb but the poll
[1:23:30] was with his father who the campaign's
[1:23:33] and he gave it testing the we're we're
[1:23:39] robbing as a mission from from India for
[1:23:42] to a lab report to see the angel so he
[1:23:46] saw and he saw healings and no meat but
[1:23:53] he said that I had no Holy Ghost okay
[1:23:58] and when the time comes
[1:24:01] him the wind or try a came and they
[1:24:07] began to speak to you know you to listen
[1:24:12] you know you are missing so much out
[1:24:15] there this in Dhaka Hall name it smoking
[1:24:23] and and he went yes went drinking
[1:24:33] smoking and in school into gambling
[1:24:36] gambling this is so it happened that one
[1:24:40] place he went he was very well I see did
[1:24:44] you see the devil knows how to sew so
[1:24:47] actually progress it's not the evidence
[1:24:49] of God being with you
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:52] so she was it was pleased very well but
[1:24:55] the point that she I think he went to
[1:24:57] the next level and when the time came
[1:25:02] for that nest nest level they he went in
[1:25:05] went in and the owner of the place said
[1:25:07] boy this not for knows what place are
[1:25:08] you you live under that person with my
[1:25:11] gesture no no he's very good and are you
[1:25:14] not the son of Abraham
[1:25:16] he said no why because he couldn't get
[1:25:21] himself what he's doing the environment
[1:25:25] he was in to be associated with Barbra
[1:25:28] and wasn't long he took ill he took ill
[1:25:33] so bad I was going to die and the
[1:25:38] doctors said that he the only wood it
[1:25:41] was so bad I think interesting so the
[1:25:44] only chance he has is to so was 14 15 or
[1:25:48] so 16 it was for him to the harvest in
[1:25:51] test time and then and then put a roast
[1:25:54] on I didn't hook as I put the power so
[1:25:56] he be used to from the extreme young boy
[1:26:01] and before the they could get they were
[1:26:06] desperate to get the father to sign
[1:26:09] consent when I was still on the age and
[1:26:11] they couldn't contact over they called a
[1:26:17] call so because he left home actually
[1:26:22] due to ground to the grand mother there
[1:26:26] was the governor was there and then I
[1:26:29] think just the morning before the
[1:26:31] surgeon surgery the grandmother they
[1:26:34] took the sign and suddenly somebody
[1:26:37] touched his back elbow behind the belong
[1:26:42] was in the mountain and I just said who
[1:26:46] quickly your son needs you so they
[1:26:49] couldn't contact him inform what window
[1:26:53] so that's God's Messi who you and I I'm
[1:26:58] then and then it came he said daddy pray
[1:27:03] for me that I won't pray for you
[1:27:05] I know I didn't mean it that way you
[1:27:09] know so I said that you you you seen you
[1:27:12] love the angel you pray the Lord anyway
[1:27:20] it was an end and you know when you you
[1:27:22] have like a theme you know so the end is
[1:27:24] what they call the the good end
[1:27:27] so what happy ending correct yes so God
[1:27:32] pray for the Sun and it's as the doctor
[1:27:35] this could be given another test so no
[1:27:38] no no no in fact he doesn't have too
[1:27:41] much time to say okay no he said he
[1:27:43] waited he that he went out he went
[1:27:47] through from the Lord now has just
[1:27:48] returned would you please check him over
[1:27:51] again and they checked over not one
[1:27:54] single young people I tell you that's
[1:28:04] not now there so and don't worry don't
[1:28:08] be discouraged go has a time for you but
[1:28:11] you got to you got to want it God
[1:28:15] designed the Holy Ghost
[1:28:16] it would ask God to help you that's
[1:28:19] nowhere when we talk about inheritance
[1:28:21] don't worry about the big why just me
[1:28:22] you need the Holy Ghost because in the
[1:28:25] whole puzzle is all we have need of amen
[1:28:29] I feel I need him today then when I
[1:28:32] first started almost 40 years ago for
[1:28:36] the odd odd years ago when you Lord gave
[1:28:39] me a repeat mrs. to me so I said I need
[1:28:44] him as much why because when this flesh

[1:28:56] word he wasn't discouraged cp1 look not

[1:41:28] prepared it's a it's a practice for
[1:41:31] people people God in His infinite mercy
[1:41:34] has sent the Prophet with a message to
[1:41:37] prepare us for a second coming
[1:41:40] I know glad hallelujah and he said
[1:41:45] somewhere that a prophet is a sign of
[1:41:47] judgment of the world right so so the
[1:41:50] same word I would join the words when I
[1:41:52] put that's listen you Amen in your place
[1:41:56] in the body so he said
[1:42:11] yeah
[1:42:12] so it says it took about here we say
[1:42:16] it's a profit place it's a private place
[1:42:19] calling in to perfection and you have to
[1:42:22] be perfect to get there MA
[1:42:25] now don't forget about about the warp
[1:42:26] effort here right okay
[1:42:29] the Bible said so just said be therefore
[1:42:32] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:42:35] perfect it is a perfect kingdom so it
[1:42:38] must be a pre people come because you
[1:42:44] have to stand and be married to the
[1:42:46] person of God and you must be a prophet
[1:42:49] bride so how can you do it to address
[1:42:53] both the private word amen that was why
[1:42:58] he had to send the prophet got all
[1:43:03] losing and fill difference of the word
[1:43:07] so and he said I've come to introduce
[1:43:10] reveal what amen and you have been
[1:43:14] privileged amen to to see it and you
[1:43:21] receive it and then that is the
[1:43:24] perfection in you that is why every
[1:43:28] other thing will fail
[1:43:30] amen so you can do it true you you can
[1:43:37] do it to anything else poor dependent
[1:43:39] world which is the waters of separation
[1:43:41] that washes us from sin from saying amen
[1:43:55] that's right think so the blood will
[1:44:01] just Christ think of it dripping blood
[1:44:04] the word yeah yeah so she stands perfect
[1:44:15] virgin on a daughter on audio treated
[1:44:18] she never seen in the first in first
[1:44:20] place this is how doth sees you
[1:44:23] amen so you is like how if you see the
[1:44:30] way and received word God sees you and
[1:44:33] spoke it it was the way that Caleb and
[1:44:35] Joshua saw the promise and spoke it but
[1:44:39] there was enough to cool him down
[1:44:43] made him formal and cold and indifferent
[1:44:45] and religious and church members but you
[1:44:48] just said no hallelujah go to God
[1:44:53] so he saw the promise and God as and
