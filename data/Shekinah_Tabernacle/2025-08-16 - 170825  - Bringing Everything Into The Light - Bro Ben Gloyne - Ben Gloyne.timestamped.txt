[3:57] Good morning.
[4:00] I'm excited to be here this morning. Our
[4:03] first song we're going to sing is the
[4:05] the the verse says, "You ask me why I'm
[4:07] happy, so I'll just tell you why."
[4:11] Because my sins are gone. We're are we
[4:15] are a redeemed people this morning.
[4:19] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[4:21] where they are, I say, "My sins are
[4:23] gone." They're underneath the blood on
[4:24] the cross of Calvary as far removed as
[4:27] darkness is from dawn.
[4:29] and the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[4:31] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[4:33] My sins are gone.
[4:35] Regardless of the fact that we're
[4:36] actually alive, we've been given so many
[4:38] things. We're here this morning and
[4:39] we've been redeemed.
[4:41] We've been redeemed this morning. So,
[4:43] let's stand. We're going to worship the
[4:44] Lord. Hey, you feeling good? You ready
[4:45] to worship the Lord? You ready to praise
[4:47] the Lord that you've been redeemed?

[4:52] by love divine. We're going to do that
[4:54] one instead. Find that one.
[4:57] Oh, glory, glory. Let's pray this
[5:00] morning. Lord, we thank you, Lord, that
[5:01] we've been redeemed this morning, Lord,
[5:03] by your amazing grace and by your love,
[5:05] Lord. You came down. You became one of
[5:06] us, Lord. So, we just pray you'd accept
[5:08] our offering of praise and worship to
[5:10] you this morning, Lord. We know it's not
[5:11] meat. It's not a meat price to pay for
[5:13] what you've done for us, Lord. But we
[5:15] just love to come and worship you and
[5:16] praise you this morning, Lord, know that
[5:18] you made a way. So, we just want to
[5:19] commit ourselves to you this morning and

[5:23] Brother Ben as he ministers. Lord, we

[5:27] excited to have the opportunity to come
[5:28] into your presence, Lord, and to worship
[5:30] and to praise, Lord, and give you all
[5:31] the glory, Lord Jesus. So, we just
[5:33] commit the service to you in Jesus name.

[37:43] scripture from Habacook uh 2 and verse
[37:47] 14. It says for the earth shall be
[37:50] filled with the knowledge of the glory
[37:51] of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
[37:54] We know Moana means the sea means the
[37:57] ocean. So I pray that her life would be
[38:01] always a reminder to you of the glory of
[38:04] the Lord. And everywhere she goes,

[46:02] Praise God. Good to be here today. Amen.
[46:04] Good to have you all. Amen. Praise the
[46:06] Lord. Let's go to the scripture, shall
[46:07] we? We're going to go to Ezekiel uh
[46:10] chapter 28,
[46:13] and we're just going to um yeah, read
[46:15] down to verse 17. Then we're going to go
[46:17] to John chapter 3 as a bit of a context
[46:20] here.
[46:26] Amen. So
[46:28] Ezekiel 28.
[46:39] Amen. It says here now, "Son of man,
[46:42] take up a lamentation upon the king of
[46:45] Tyrus, and say unto him, thus sayeth the
[46:47] Lord God, thou sealest up the sum, full
[46:51] of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou
[46:53] has been in the Eden, the garden of God.
[46:56] Every precious stone was thy covering,
[46:58] the Sardis, the topaz, the diamond, uh
[47:01] the barrel, the enher, the sapphire, the
[47:03] emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold.
[47:06] workmanship of thy tablets and of thy
[47:07] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[47:09] that thou was created. Thou art the
[47:11] anointed cherub that coverth, and I have
[47:13] set thee so. Thou was upon the holy
[47:16] mountain of God. Thou hast walked up and
[47:18] down in the midst of the stones of fire.
[47:21] Thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[47:23] day that thou was created till iniquity
[47:25] was found in thee. By the multitude of
[47:28] thy merchandise, they have filled the
[47:30] midst of thee with violence, and thou
[47:32] hast sinned. Therefore, I'll cast thee
[47:34] as a profane as profane out of the
[47:37] mountain of God. I'll destroy thee, oh
[47:39] covering cherub from the midst of the
[47:41] stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted
[47:43] up because of thy beauty. Thou hast
[47:45] corrupted thy wisdom by reason of of thy
[47:48] brightness. I will cast thee to the
[47:50] ground. I will lay thee before kings
[47:52] that they may behold thee.
[47:55] And then in John chapter 3 and and verse
[47:58] uh 18 to 21 here
[48:05] going to read this
[48:18] says here
[48:20] he that believeth on him is not
[48:22] condemned but he that believeth
[48:24] believeth not is condemned already
[48:26] because he hath not believed in the name
[48:28] of the only begotten son of God. And
[48:30] this is the com uh condemnation that
[48:32] light is come into the world and men
[48:34] love darkness rather than light because
[48:37] their deeds were evil. For everyone that
[48:39] doeth evil hateth the light, and neither
[48:42] cometh to the light, lest his deeds uh
[48:45] should be reproved. But he that doeth
[48:48] truth cometh to the light, that his
[48:50] deeds may be made manifest, that they
[48:52] are wrought in God. Amen. So, let's bow
[48:55] heads in a word of prayer. If you want
[48:56] to be remembered, you just want to slip
[48:57] your hand up. Say, Lord, remember me.
[48:59] Don't pass me by today, Lord. Come to
[49:01] where I am. Gracious Father, we have
[49:03] come to invite you to our lives this
[49:04] morning, Father, that you'd come and
[49:06] take complete control, Lord. You would
[49:08] you would increase our faith, Lord. Mold
[49:10] us and shape us, Lord. We want to
[49:12] magnify your name more, Lord. We want to
[49:14] lift your name up more, Father, that
[49:15] you'd be exalted in our praise and our
[49:17] worship. So I pray, dear God, may you
[49:20] come anoint every life, Father, not just
[49:22] here, those who are streaming, those who
[49:24] are sick, who couldn't be here, be their
[49:26] portion, Father. And I pray you would
[49:27] fill us all with the Holy Ghost. You
[49:28] would bind every work of the enemy, dear
[49:31] God, that you would just have complete
[49:32] liberty in our midst. I pray that no
[49:34] spirit would be able to distract anyone,
[49:36] but may you just have complete control,
[49:38] Lord. We surrender all that we are into
[49:40] your hands for your glory. We've read
[49:42] your word now, Lord. We're asking you,
[49:43] the great author would anoint it to our
[49:45] hearts, Lord, for your glory in Jesus
[49:47] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[49:50] you, friends. You can have your seats uh
[49:52] this morning. So, I want to speak about
[49:54] bringing it all into the light.
[49:58] We we read here in in Ezekiel 28 where
[50:02] um where where the Lord is telling
[50:04] Ezekiel to take up a lamentation. It
[50:07] says upon the king of Tyrus. Now this
[50:09] lamentation is really upon the anointing
[50:11] that's upon this king. Now I just want
[50:13] you to look at this here where where he
[50:15] is describing Satan uh as he was made
[50:18] and what happens is when because the
[50:21] angels became demons because they fell.
[50:23] They left their first estate. And so
[50:25] what they were in heaven see every angel
[50:27] has a different function. They're not
[50:28] all made the same. And and and and a
[50:31] cherub anointed cherub is one that
[50:32] protects access. It's you know it's like
[50:34] a it's like a security guard you know
[50:36] that you know that protects the throne
[50:37] of God that so Satan was made to
[50:40] actually to to block or allow access of
[50:42] different angelic beings to come before
[50:44] the throne of God and this is how he has
[50:46] been made. Now just because he fell
[50:48] because of iniquity in his heart does
[50:50] not mean that he is not built the same
[50:52] way but he's just fallen out of his
[50:54] position. So this is really if we can
[50:56] look and see what the enemy how he's
[50:59] been made and how he'll work it will
[51:01] show us what he tries to do in our
[51:02] lives. Now he is very much uh very much
[51:07] made to to get between you and God. He's
[51:10] like a wedge. Now I find it very
[51:12] interesting where we read here at uh
[51:14] verse 17. He says, "The Lord says, I
[51:16] will lay thee before kings that they may
[51:19] behold thee." Now, who are these kings
[51:21] he's talking about? He's not talking
[51:23] about King Charles III unless he meets
[51:25] the Lord. But yeah, he's not talking
[51:27] about those kind of kings. He's talking
[51:28] about kings and priests that God has
[51:30] made. He's talking about his bride, his
[51:33] children. Amen. That God, he says, God,
[51:36] so because this being, this enemy we
[51:38] fight has exalted himself, you know, in
[51:40] in Isaiah says he will be like the most
[51:42] high. He wants to be like God. But God
[51:44] tells him, you want to go there, but
[51:46] you're going to end up at the feet of of
[51:48] my people. Amen. You I will lay thee
[51:50] before kings. Amen. That they may behold
[51:53] thee. And so what the Lord is doing in
[51:55] this day, because to me, the scripture
[51:57] will be fulfilled not just when every
[51:59] knee will bow. No, I believe it's today.
[52:01] I mean, I believe it's right now where
[52:03] the sons and daughters of God have come
[52:05] to their position in Christ. I mean,
[52:07] which is above the enemy and his and he
[52:10] has now been laid at your feet that you
[52:12] can actually consider him for what he
[52:14] really is. I mean, cuz that's what
[52:15] happens when light is shone. It really
[52:18] shows you what that thing is made of.
[52:20] You know, who's ever who's ever, you
[52:22] know, maybe in the dark and you've got
[52:23] maybe a coat or something something
[52:25] hanging up and you know, it's behind a
[52:27] door and you see this black thing just
[52:28] it seems like suspended in midair and it
[52:31] and it can be scary. Not speaking from
[52:33] experience, but other people, you know,
[52:34] they oh, it looks like it's some devil's
[52:36] hanging there in the room and stuff and
[52:39] you know, you know, but then when the
[52:40] light comes on, you can behold it for
[52:42] what it really is. That's just a
[52:44] dressing gown, man. Come on. You know,
[52:46] but the thing is the fear because the
[52:48] darkness brings a fear. It gives it
[52:49] power over your life because you can't
[52:51] see it. You can't behold it for what it
[52:53] really is. But when the light turns on,
[52:56] when the light turns on, it exposes well
[52:59] the bathrobe. It exposes the enemy,
[53:02] right? Enemy is not a bathrobe, but you
[53:04] know what I mean, right? You see, see,
[53:06] it exposes the enemy that we can really
[53:08] see him. And this is what the word has
[53:09] done in this day. Brother Ara said when
[53:11] the seals came open, it just exposed
[53:13] Satan. See, it revealed Christ, but it
[53:16] also exposes Satan. exposes his works
[53:18] down through the church ages. And and so
[53:21] so the so the word we know is the
[53:23] manifested light of this day. This
[53:25] message exposes Satan for what he really
[53:27] is. So you can behold him. And and it
[53:29] says in Isaiah, I don't have the quote,
[53:31] but but um I mean I don't have the
[53:33] scripture, but but he's describing the
[53:35] same scene as we read here in Ezekiel.
[53:37] And you know, it says it says, "And they
[53:38] that see him shall say, is this the man
[53:40] that did weaken the nations? Is this
[53:42] really him? this great being that's
[53:44] controlled the earth and manipulated and
[53:47] brought all kind of darkness and sin.
[53:48] Those that see him will say, "Is it
[53:50] really him? Is it is this the guy?" And
[53:53] the reason we can say that is because
[53:54] God has raised us up above the works of
[53:57] darkness. Amen. Because we see him for
[53:59] who he really is. Now to to behold
[54:02] something is to inspect it, to perceive
[54:05] it, to consider it. Right? And this is
[54:07] what the word I pray that they your God
[54:09] has opened your eyes. You can see the
[54:11] enemy for who he really is. He loves to
[54:13] hide in shadows. He loves to hide in,
[54:15] you know, in many different things. And
[54:17] he tries to separate you and God. He'll
[54:21] allow you to come to church. He don't
[54:22] mind that. He don't mind you claiming to
[54:24] be a message believer. But what he does
[54:26] mind is when it's you and God are one. I
[54:28] mean, you can say, "I and my father are
[54:30] one that the word is put on flesh."
[54:32] Amen. He hates that kind of a person.
[54:34] Amen. But what he wants to do is he
[54:35] wants to Satan wants to come in and try
[54:37] and be like God to you.
[54:40] That's his master plan. But aren't you
[54:43] glad you've made a god God's great
[54:45] graces come into your life that you can
[54:47] see him for what he really is. Now
[54:51] um so Satan's really like a wedge. Now
[54:54] the girls who came to Brisbane with me
[54:56] will see some of these are similar
[54:57] pictures. But this is basically what
[54:58] Satan is. He wants to be a wedge between
[55:00] you and God. He wants to he wants to
[55:02] rule your life to to protect I mean I
[55:05] mean I mean to to keep you warded off.
[55:08] this is what he wants to do. And how
[55:10] does he do this now? Because I want to I
[55:12] want to go into some things this morning
[55:14] because, you know, if we know him and we
[55:16] know his tactics, then we can sidestep
[55:18] them all, right? Because you know, how
[55:19] do you win a war? Intelligence.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; It's not about the grunt on the front
[55:24] line in the trench, that's not how a war
[55:25] is won. It's by intelligence. Amen. If
[55:28] you know what your enemy is doing, when
[55:30] he's going to do it, what he's going to
[55:31] use, you can bypass it. You can take him
[55:34] out. You can destroy him before he ever
[55:35] gets near you because of intelligence.
[55:38] And this is the age where we have
[55:39] received the mind of Christ. Amen. That
[55:42] divine love of Christ himself, that
[55:43] capstone has come down, anointed our
[55:45] lives that we can think like the Lord.
[55:47] We can talk like the Lord. We can act
[55:50] like the word. Amen. Who is the Lord?
[55:51] Right? We can we can operate like he is
[55:54] in the world. Praise the Lord. But you
[55:57] see, so Satan always comes in. What does
[55:58] he do now? He always brings questions.
[56:01] He always brings doubt. He wants to his
[56:03] whole objective is to bring doubt upon
[56:06] the word. Now maybe next Sunday I'll go
[56:08] into it but you see the things that you
[56:10] know we are about to step back into the
[56:12] garden of Eden again. And so what are
[56:14] the things that were fighting? What were
[56:16] the believers fighting before they well
[56:18] you know the original sins what were
[56:20] they? Okay so outside of the garden it
[56:22] was Cain killing Abel right the
[56:24] intellectual killing the spiritual
[56:27] trying to kill the effect of the word
[56:28] jealousy hatred strife against the
[56:31] believer. So it was violence. But then
[56:33] in the garden, what was it? Adultery,
[56:35] sexual sin. Those things are the two big
[56:38] things that we face in this day. More
[56:40] than smoking, drinking, drugs. Sure,
[56:44] they're all out there, but but when it
[56:46] comes to a believer, those things were a
[56:48] big thing in Brother Brandham's day.
[56:50] Sure, they're here in the world today.
[56:52] But for a believer, those are not the
[56:54] things we war against necessarily. I
[56:56] pray you don't. If you do, bring it to
[56:58] the table. Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Bring it to the Lord and he'll take
[57:01] those things from you. So, you see,
[57:02] we're so we're going back. So, so we're
[57:04] facing those things before we step back
[57:06] into Eden again. Maybe they'll be next
[57:08] Sunday. I don't know. But that's where I
[57:10] want to go eventually. And so, but what
[57:13] does what did Satan do? He interpret He
[57:15] interpreted the word to Eve. We all know
[57:17] this, right? He took 99% of the truth,
[57:20] 1% lie, gave it to Eve, and we're in
[57:23] this chaos that we live in today because
[57:25] he he brought a bit of darkness into
[57:28] where the truth is. And this is what he
[57:29] always does. He will present. He never
[57:31] came to even say God doesn't exist or
[57:35] he's not your father or you're not his
[57:36] child. He never came that way. He just
[57:38] put a question. Did God really say it
[57:40] like that?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; You see, and he so he always puts a
[57:43] question on these things. Why? Because
[57:44] he was trying to be that anointed cherub
[57:46] that covered her not to bring life but
[57:49] to bring death. And this is what he
[57:51] achieved. And so it's the same thing
[57:53] with you and I. What is the thing we
[57:54] face? Is the word really right? Is this
[57:57] message really true?
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did it really happen the way the
[58:00] prophet said it happened?
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it did.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Does it really produce what it says it
[58:05] does? I'm a living witness that this
[58:08] message is right because I have received
[58:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[58:12] I've become I've realized that I'm a son
[58:14] of God. Amen. God has shown me where I
[58:16] come from, who I am, and where I'm
[58:18] going. I mean, why? By the revealed word
[58:20] of the day. Amen. So, so people put
[58:22] questions on it. You say, "Well, the
[58:24] question you should really ask is the
[58:26] same question God asked Adam and Eve.
[58:28] Who told you you were naked? Who's
[58:30] telling you these questions? Who asked
[58:31] you? Who showed you these things?"
[58:33] Because if you look at the person who's
[58:34] saying those things, I'll tell you one
[58:36] thing. There's no overcoming power.
[58:39] There's no victory. There's no joy.
[58:40] There's no peace. There's nothing good.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; So, so it should be that should be the
[58:44] question you should ask. Who told you
[58:45] that?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Who shared that gossip? Who's the one
[58:48] who's trying to destroy someone's
[58:49] influence? Who's trying who told you
[58:50] those things?
[58:52] You got to think about that. Hey, we
[58:54] should say it for what it is.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't sugarcoat things. No, who
[58:59] told you these things? What's their
[59:00] life? What's their track record? What
[59:02] are they producing?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; What was the serpent producing? Nothing.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even in the promise of God.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Neither is Satan, by the way.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now, so he always puts
[59:14] questions on the word. And he always
[59:17] tries to apply um he always tries to
[59:20] appeal to our reasoning and to our
[59:21] emotions. This is what Satan does.
[59:24] Always applies to your reasoning and
[59:25] your emotions. If it feels good, do it.
[59:29] Really?
[59:31] No. You got to be careful. Everything
[59:33] you must do must be according to the
[59:34] word. It's our safety. It's our
[59:37] headship. If you want the protection of
[59:38] the word, stay under the word. If you
[59:40] want God to be your king, stay with your
[59:42] king, which is the word. Don't steer
[59:44] from outside his headship. Stay with
[59:46] him. Amen. You if you want his benefits,
[59:48] you got to stay with the king. You got
[59:50] to stay with the headship. Right? If you
[59:51] move outside his headship, what are you
[59:53] going to get? Not what you think you'll
[59:55] get. Because Satan always try and appeal
[59:57] to you. Say, "Listen, man. This thing
[59:59] isn't really real. Your parents just do
[1:00:01] this cuz it's how they've been raised."
[1:00:04] No, I wasn't raised this way. I wasn't
[1:00:07] raised in a Christian message
[1:00:08] environment. But God found me at
[1:00:10] university in a place that he that the
[1:00:12] least likely place. He found me there.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Against all odds, he
[1:00:18] found me.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? His election stand sure. So
[1:00:21] don't worry about, you know, it's not
[1:00:23] about upbringing. It's not about well,
[1:00:25] you know, anything like that. It's God's
[1:00:28] sovereign grace.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, so he always apply um
[1:00:33] um applies I mean appeals to our
[1:00:35] reasoning, to our emotions, you know, he
[1:00:38] he always tries to keep it in that
[1:00:40] realm. And we have bodies. We have
[1:00:43] flesh. You can't kill your emotions. You
[1:00:45] shouldn't. You shouldn't kill human
[1:00:47] desire.
[1:00:49] That's wrong. God gave it to you. We're
[1:00:52] all red-blooded,
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; right? You can't turn off a switch. No,
[1:00:57] it's got to be channeled. I think this
[1:00:59] is next Sunday. I'm going to already
[1:01:00] leave it alone. But you see, you got to
[1:01:02] realize you can't just there's not just
[1:01:03] something that turns off all your
[1:01:04] emotion. You just become like a mutant,
[1:01:06] a robot. No, that's not healthy. Yeah.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; See, cuz what happens is the devil, he
[1:01:11] always brings something and perverts it.
[1:01:13] And perversion will always cause
[1:01:15] something to come out wrong.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You see, and so and so what happened
[1:01:19] with Adam and Eve, it came out wrong cuz
[1:01:20] a perversion came in. So you always
[1:01:23] apply to those things. But we have to
[1:01:26] come to a place,
[1:01:28] you see, where see and then he will he
[1:01:31] will apply he will he will anoint our
[1:01:33] feelings. Who's had that?
[1:01:36] A thought has come into your mind and
[1:01:38] it's completely wrong but it feels so
[1:01:40] real. The imagination could be so vivid
[1:01:43] everything but it's completely
[1:01:44] completely wrong.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Like brother an says you just imagine
[1:01:47] somebody hates you once and they don't
[1:01:49] hate you but you imagine they do. You
[1:01:51] just keep thinking they don't like me.
[1:01:53] The first thing you'll be shunning that
[1:01:54] person when they haven't done nothing to
[1:01:57] you. And after a while it becomes so a
[1:01:59] reality uh to you till you actually
[1:02:01] believe that person don't like you. and
[1:02:04] you might ball them out or say or say
[1:02:06] something to you. For instance, your
[1:02:08] wife or your husband or some neighbor or
[1:02:10] something like that when the person's
[1:02:12] absolutely innocent of any ill thing,
[1:02:14] it's because you just imagine it so. But
[1:02:16] till it becomes a reality to you now see
[1:02:20] now see what I mean. What do you mean
[1:02:22] your wife, your spouse, your children,
[1:02:24] your you can just get an imagination
[1:02:26] that person hates you and they begin to
[1:02:28] do something. They even talk nicely like
[1:02:29] how you doing today? Oh, good. It's like
[1:02:32] you start balling them out about
[1:02:33] something like, "Well, where did that
[1:02:34] come from?" An imagination. Well,
[1:02:36] where'd that imagination come? An
[1:02:38] anointed chair that's trying to cover
[1:02:39] you, trying to actually make you think
[1:02:41] your brother, your sister's not your
[1:02:43] brother or sister. He'll try and make
[1:02:44] you think the believers are no good.
[1:02:46] He'll point out every every fault that
[1:02:48] they have. We got plenty of faults.
[1:02:50] We're human, aren't we? And we've got
[1:02:51] plenty of things the devil can point
[1:02:52] out. But you see, we're going to look
[1:02:54] beyond those things. But what's his
[1:02:55] whole purpose in doing it? Separation.
[1:02:58] He's trying to ward off keep keep people
[1:03:00] separated from the body of Christ. This
[1:03:02] is this is what he does.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; So why should we go by imaginations? Oh,
[1:03:07] I heard this about this person and this
[1:03:09] person. Never trust a grape vine.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Never never trust I'm I'm actually quite
[1:03:15] happy I'm not connected.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Someone got some sick
[1:03:19] tears. Maybe God and he just snipped
[1:03:20] that thing and you had to put up with
[1:03:22] that stuff. Why should Oh, I heard that
[1:03:24] down the grape vine. It's like Chinese
[1:03:25] whispers. Who's played Chinese Whispers
[1:03:27] before?
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; It starts off as a man driving a taxi
[1:03:31] and a few people down the class, it's a
[1:03:33] purple monkey dishwasher or something.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; It's totally unrelated. We played that
[1:03:37] at primary school, right? And and
[1:03:39] everyone's trying to listen as hard as
[1:03:41] they can to pass the message on and they
[1:03:43] listen as hard as they can and it
[1:03:44] becomes completely wrong.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; So why trust the grapevine? The whole
[1:03:48] purpose of that is is for Satan to get
[1:03:51] in, bring separation that he can have
[1:03:54] dominion.
[1:03:56] Amen. Someone who's part of a body, the
[1:03:58] enemy will come against them. But I tell
[1:03:59] you what, that body goes shouldertosh
[1:04:01] shoulder. Amen. With that person, helps
[1:04:02] them out and they'll get victory. You'll
[1:04:04] never get victory in a Christian life
[1:04:05] living by yourself.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; We are not an island. Even Switzerland
[1:04:10] is not an island.
[1:04:12] That's what her uncle said to me many
[1:04:14] years ago. I'm like, "No, it's not an
[1:04:15] island anyway. We're isolated, you
[1:04:17] know." No, we are not. You say we're on
[1:04:19] the back side of the world and here we
[1:04:20] are. Last stop before Antarctica, we're
[1:04:22] an island. We're not. This country is
[1:04:24] connected with the world. We have to be
[1:04:26] connected with the with the believers,
[1:04:28] with the word. We can't be all isolated
[1:04:30] by ourselves.
[1:04:32] Amen. So we But you see now what does he
[1:04:35] do? He comes in He comes in through sin,
[1:04:38] indifference, and disease. Trouble comes
[1:04:41] in. He makes us feel indifferent. This
[1:04:43] is a problem with this country. Apathy
[1:04:44] is rife in this country. She'll be
[1:04:47] right. Take it easy. You know, and what
[1:04:51] happens? Indifference comes in. We
[1:04:52] settle down. We don't no longer press
[1:04:55] the battle like we used to. And that
[1:04:57] what does he do? He comes in through
[1:04:58] indifference. He comes in even through
[1:05:00] disease. Sickness strikes someone. And
[1:05:04] and God has allowed that because God
[1:05:06] wants to prove his word in that
[1:05:07] situation. But the devil, see, God is
[1:05:09] always whenever God does something,
[1:05:11] Satan comes in to try and pervert it
[1:05:14] every time.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And so, we must be very careful.
[1:05:17] Whatever is going on in life, we don't
[1:05:18] let the devil get a hold of our life
[1:05:20] through anything. Okay, I'm going kind
[1:05:22] of broad. I'm going to but I'm going to
[1:05:24] boil it down soon. Okay, I'm going to
[1:05:25] bring it down. Okay, so this is what he
[1:05:26] does now. And then what happens is see
[1:05:29] whenever these things begin to be spoken
[1:05:31] about and that's the enemy has actually
[1:05:34] tried to ward off someone, keep them
[1:05:35] keep them isolated, what happens with
[1:05:38] that person? They begin to change in
[1:05:41] terms of they feel shame. They can feel
[1:05:44] guilty. They can feel unworthy. And it's
[1:05:47] actually that spirit trying to hide in
[1:05:49] that person. We got to realize I
[1:05:51] believe, you know, I reckon it would
[1:05:53] revolutionize our lives if we could see
[1:05:55] the enemy for what he is. You see,
[1:05:57] because it's very easy just say if
[1:05:59] someone is naturally uh injured, you
[1:06:02] know, you say you've got a cast on your
[1:06:04] leg, you got a body cast, you're in ICU,
[1:06:06] you can see that person's fighting some
[1:06:07] sickness or some trouble. But then
[1:06:09] that's in the natural. It's easy to see
[1:06:11] that, right? But then in the spiritual,
[1:06:13] they can be walking around. They can be
[1:06:15] have all range of motion, do everything
[1:06:16] fine, but yet they're in a ICU bed
[1:06:19] spiritually. and they think the sin that
[1:06:22] or the or the enemy that's got a hold of
[1:06:24] their lives is them because that's the
[1:06:26] way if you can see sin is not you, you
[1:06:28] can get rid of it. If you can see a
[1:06:30] spirit is not you, you can get rid of
[1:06:31] it. But when you take ownership of it
[1:06:33] for yourself, you think it's you, you
[1:06:35] can never be free from you. Right? And
[1:06:37] this is what the devil comes in. He
[1:06:38] never comes say and say say, "Hello, I'm
[1:06:40] Mr. Satan. I'm going to make you feel I
[1:06:43] I'm going to trap you into this sin in a
[1:06:45] couple of days. I've been working on
[1:06:47] your life for a while. I've isolated
[1:06:49] you. I'm going to make you feel ashamed
[1:06:50] of it and this is how it's going to
[1:06:51] happen. He never comes that way. He
[1:06:54] makes us think first person. You know,
[1:06:56] he puts a thought in your mind. I'm
[1:06:58] feeling down today. Things are hard.
[1:07:00] What's he trying to do? Get you on a
[1:07:01] road to depression. Trying to make you
[1:07:03] feel down. Everything's wrong and
[1:07:04] everything's negative and everything's
[1:07:06] bad. That's him trying to be that
[1:07:07] anointed cherub covering over your life.
[1:07:10] But you got to realize, no, life may be
[1:07:11] hard, but God is God. Amen. Jesus Christ
[1:07:14] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:15] forever. and I may be going through a
[1:07:17] hard patch, but I'm going to go through
[1:07:18] this hard patch and God's allowed it to
[1:07:20] prove himself and everything's working
[1:07:21] for my good and I'm an overcomer and the
[1:07:24] blood's covering me and and everything
[1:07:26] is actually fine.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; That's how I feel about things. I think
[1:07:30] we should be positive. Amen. This is the
[1:07:32] good news, is it not? This message is
[1:07:33] the good news.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see now, but but see, he knows
[1:07:37] that the spirit of God is about to exp
[1:07:39] let the people know of his works. And I
[1:07:42] pray God will do that today.
[1:07:44] Amen.
[1:07:46] He says he says that the
[1:07:50] he's speaking about the book of
[1:07:51] revelation here. He says now it exposes
[1:07:53] Satan revealing his works attempted
[1:07:55] destruction of God's people and the
[1:07:56] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:07:58] the time he's cast into the lake of
[1:08:00] fire. He fights that he can't outstand
[1:08:02] it. He knows that if the people get the
[1:08:03] true revelation of the true church and
[1:08:05] what she is and what she stands for and
[1:08:07] she can do the greater work, she will be
[1:08:09] an invincible army. Amen. If they get a
[1:08:11] true revelation of the two spirits
[1:08:13] within the framework of the Christian
[1:08:14] church and by God's spirit discern and
[1:08:17] withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan
[1:08:19] know Satan will be powerless before her.
[1:08:22] So, we're going to be able to discern
[1:08:24] and withstand the antichrist spirit.
[1:08:26] What is that spirit wanting to do? Make
[1:08:27] you lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; That's what the enemy wants you to do.
[1:08:32] Religious, absolutely. But he wants to
[1:08:34] make you feel lukewarm, formal, and
[1:08:36] powerless. And but God has made to make
[1:08:38] us be on fire without form and powerful.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what this is what God
[1:08:45] wants to do. So so we
[1:08:48] if we look at this now he says he'll be
[1:08:50] definitely thwarted today as when Christ
[1:08:52] withtood his every effort to gain power
[1:08:54] over him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates
[1:08:55] revelation but we love it with the true
[1:08:58] revelation in our lives. The gates of
[1:08:59] hell cannot prevail against us but we
[1:09:02] will prevail over them.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we will prevail over them.
[1:09:07] Now,
[1:09:09] see, there has to come a time. See, we
[1:09:11] don't walk by feelings. Amen. We walk by
[1:09:14] revelation.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; And you've got, you know, and we must
[1:09:17] come to a place like Sarah did. Sarah
[1:09:19] walked by feelings for a very long time
[1:09:21] with Abraham. She didn't feel pregnant.
[1:09:23] She didn't feel fertile. She felt
[1:09:25] menopause. She felt post-menopause. She
[1:09:27] felt all these things in her body. But
[1:09:29] because of the visitation of Elohim in
[1:09:31] Genesis 18, Amen. What happened is that
[1:09:34] visitation turned her heart. Amen. And
[1:09:36] then what happened? She came to a place
[1:09:38] where she judged him faithful. Amen. Who
[1:09:41] had promised. And I believe we are that
[1:09:44] kind of a people. We've come to a place.
[1:09:46] Lord, I judge you faithful. Whatever
[1:09:48] your word has promised for me, it's yay
[1:09:50] and amen. Amen. You're more than able to
[1:09:52] achieve it. You see, if you keep that
[1:09:54] kind of faith, you keep that because the
[1:09:56] right mental attitude towards any
[1:09:57] promise of God will bring it to pass.
[1:09:59] Right? So if you have that right mental
[1:10:01] attitude, Lord, you're faithful and
[1:10:02] true. You cannot fail, Lord. I'm not
[1:10:05] looking at my circumstances. I'm looking
[1:10:06] at your promise. Amen. Because if you
[1:10:08] keep looking at your problem, see what
[1:10:10] does the devil do? Covers you over,
[1:10:12] makes you look at your problem. I can
[1:10:14] never overcome this problem. This lust
[1:10:16] or this pornography or this hatred, this
[1:10:18] gossip, this jealousy, if you just look
[1:10:20] at that, you'll never be free. You've
[1:10:23] got to look beyond that.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Look beyond that to the promise. Amen.
[1:10:27] You got to look beyond that because even
[1:10:29] Jonah said, "He that observes lying
[1:10:31] vanities forsakes are his own mercy."
[1:10:33] And he was in a whale's belly when he
[1:10:35] said that.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; He was surrounded by whales belly. I
[1:10:38] doubt very much. It was a big nice
[1:10:40] cavern that he sat in like you see the
[1:10:42] you know the um children's uh you know
[1:10:44] gospel stories and he's sitting there on
[1:10:46] a you know nice and he's covered in
[1:10:48] seaweed but he's got this big cavernous
[1:10:50] stomach to sit in. No, he would have
[1:10:52] been stuck like this and it's pushed
[1:10:54] against him and all these things, but
[1:10:56] you know, he said that's just all lying
[1:10:57] vanities.
[1:10:59] How about you and I?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:03] Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:11:06] we're told to walk in the light as he is
[1:11:08] in the light. This is a principle of the
[1:11:10] scripture. He says, "This then is the
[1:11:12] message which we heard of him and
[1:11:14] declare unto you that God is light and
[1:11:16] in him is no darkness at all. If we say
[1:11:18] we have fellowship with him and walk in
[1:11:19] darkness, we lie and do not the truth.
[1:11:21] But if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:11:24] the light, we have fellowship one with
[1:11:25] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:11:27] his son cleanses us from all sin. So
[1:11:31] we've got to walk in the light. We we
[1:11:33] got to bring everything to the light.
[1:11:35] All of our things must be reproved by
[1:11:37] the light. If we keep things in secret,
[1:11:39] if we keep it in darkness, then it can't
[1:11:41] be brought into the light. It can't be
[1:11:43] exposed for what it really is. Amen. You
[1:11:45] may think you have a right to hold
[1:11:47] something against somebody. You bring it
[1:11:49] to the light. Like brother Bram says
[1:11:52] that you know someone does something to
[1:11:53] you and it can be a genuine thing
[1:11:54] they've done and but what do you do? You
[1:11:56] go to prayer. You go shoulderto-shoulder
[1:11:58] with that brother or sister and you lift
[1:12:00] them before the throne of God and then
[1:12:02] and then and then you let God begin to
[1:12:03] talk to you about that situation and
[1:12:05] then maybe God will show you what
[1:12:07] they've been through and what's caused
[1:12:08] that. But he says after you've come down
[1:12:10] from that prayer, you'll feel sorry for
[1:12:12] that brother. What's happened? You've
[1:12:13] brought it to the light because brother
[1:12:15] Ram says that no mortal can condemn
[1:12:17] another mortal in the presence of God.
[1:12:20] Amen. It's impossible that when you
[1:12:22] really come into the light, you won't
[1:12:24] condemn anybody. You won't hold nothing
[1:12:26] against nobody. It will all be gone. You
[1:12:28] won't because you'll realize that thing
[1:12:30] in your life of that ought or that
[1:12:31] unforgiveness is really what is that?
[1:12:33] That's Satan trying to cover you over.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; But we're told to walk in the light as
[1:12:39] he is in the light.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the thing is in this day the
[1:12:44] light has been tried to be obscured. As
[1:12:47] you say in Revelations chapter nine,
[1:12:49] when the fifth angel sounded, I saw a
[1:12:51] star fall from heaven unto the earth.
[1:12:53] And to him was given the key of the
[1:12:54] bottomless pit. And he opened the
[1:12:56] bottomless pit. There arose a smoke out
[1:12:58] of the pit as a smoke of a great
[1:12:59] furnace. And the sun and the air were
[1:13:02] darkened by reason of the smoke of the
[1:13:04] pit. Now I don't have time to read it.
[1:13:06] You just go read this whole chapter. And
[1:13:08] it says that you know after this all
[1:13:09] happens it says one woe is passed and
[1:13:11] two come hereafter. And so this has been
[1:13:14] placed in time because a woe in the book
[1:13:16] of revelation is a world war. So after
[1:13:18] world war I what happened? The bombless
[1:13:19] pit opened. Right? These these
[1:13:22] supernatural uh demons came out to
[1:13:24] torment man. And this is why we have
[1:13:27] such a rife problem with with mental
[1:13:29] illness, trouble on every hand, all
[1:13:31] these things. Why? Because this demon
[1:13:33] power has been released into this age. I
[1:13:35] mean what and and what is it like? like
[1:13:37] smoke. Who's ever tried to Who's ever
[1:13:40] bride and the smoke comes in your eyes?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; It stings. You can't see straight. Tears
[1:13:46] come. You start coughing. It gets in
[1:13:48] your lungs. You can't see right. Why?
[1:13:50] Cuz there's smoke has come in. You can't
[1:13:52] see. And it says the sun was darkened by
[1:13:55] the reason of the smoke. So the the sun
[1:13:57] represents the gospel, represents the
[1:13:59] light, and it's been obscured by the
[1:14:01] smoke. And you see this is the problem
[1:14:04] in this day and age where people are so
[1:14:06] caught up in devices so much. I mean
[1:14:09] what you know even brother Bram said
[1:14:10] about rock and roll music when someone
[1:14:12] hears that without the Holy Ghost the
[1:14:14] spirit in that music will catch that
[1:14:16] person take them captive. Now you take
[1:14:18] that multiply it by what we have today
[1:14:21] with with with Tik Tok and social media
[1:14:23] and all these different kind of things.
[1:14:25] What happens? It's actually smoke. It
[1:14:27] obscures the light. It obscures the
[1:14:31] light doesn't see we had we had fires
[1:14:34] what in in in in Australia a few years
[1:14:36] ago and the and the smoke came over to
[1:14:38] New Zealand made it a bit darker all
[1:14:40] these things see the the the impact of
[1:14:43] the sun rays could not strike the earth
[1:14:45] because of the smoke and because people
[1:14:48] get caught up in in in the internet and
[1:14:50] different kind of entertainments it
[1:14:51] becomes smoke that the light of the word
[1:14:54] can't impact them like it should I mean
[1:14:56] so you got to feel if you feel numb in
[1:14:58] church, you don't feel anything. I say
[1:15:00] maybe you're in a smoky place. Maybe you
[1:15:02] should step out into the light. Come
[1:15:04] away from those things. You say, "Well,
[1:15:06] I just need it. I'm so addicted." Yeah.
[1:15:08] And it is it is an addiction. Amen. The
[1:15:12] reason why it's so successful is because
[1:15:13] it is addictive. Like you take
[1:15:16] McDonald's, the reason it's so popular
[1:15:18] is because it tastes good. It's
[1:15:20] addictive. It's been engineered that
[1:15:22] way. It wasn't a random accident that
[1:15:24] even the restaurant is how it's built,
[1:15:26] the food, how it's made. It's all been
[1:15:28] engineered
[1:15:29] that that as soon as a child takes it,
[1:15:32] they say, "I want another one."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; It's been made that way. There's, you
[1:15:37] know, you I know I've said it before,
[1:15:38] but you know, there's the thing called
[1:15:39] brain hacking where where psychologists
[1:15:43] will be employed by social media giants
[1:15:45] to so they can tailor their tailor their
[1:15:48] videos, tailor their content that it
[1:15:50] hacks your brain. It it was once called
[1:15:53] once upon a time programs on the
[1:15:55] television. What is it programming? Was
[1:15:58] it programming your mind? It's
[1:16:00] programming your life. I'm not against
[1:16:02] social media and all these things. Use
[1:16:04] them as a tool, but don't let it use
[1:16:05] you. Don't let it make you numb that you
[1:16:08] don't feel the impact. You say, "Once
[1:16:09] upon a time, God was so real in my life
[1:16:11] and where's he gone and all these
[1:16:13] things." I say it's maybe because
[1:16:14] there's smoke.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; You just got to get away from the smoke
[1:16:18] and let the light strike you again. You
[1:16:20] haven't changed. God hasn't changed in
[1:16:23] terms of you're a predestinated seed.
[1:16:24] It's just smoke has got into your eyes.
[1:16:27] Amen. So, get rid of those things. If
[1:16:29] it's ruling you, it's not worth it.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I doubt there'll be not a single
[1:16:35] saint that's redeemed on the other side.
[1:16:37] Amen. At the wedding supper table when
[1:16:38] we reach, imagine this, brother Armand.
[1:16:40] We're sitting there say, "Man, I wish I
[1:16:42] watched more.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; I wish I watched more realels. I wish I
[1:16:46] watched more cat videos."
[1:16:49] I don't do that, by the way, but you
[1:16:50] know what I mean. But it's so
[1:16:51] ridiculous. But what's happened is is
[1:16:54] people become disconnected. What's that?
[1:16:56] The anointed cherub that coverth has
[1:16:58] anointed that person and separated them.
[1:17:00] If you got young people who sit in their
[1:17:02] room all day on their computer, on their
[1:17:04] phone, they ain't watching. They're not
[1:17:06] learning calculus.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; They're not learning something that's
[1:17:09] helpful. I say it always leads to
[1:17:12] pornography.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; It'll see what happens is the devil when
[1:17:18] he anoints someone, he puts them into an
[1:17:20] alternative reality. Just like brother
[1:17:22] Bram said, there was a young lady and
[1:17:24] you know years ago she was in a meeting.
[1:17:26] She had a natural heart trouble and God
[1:17:27] healed her of that. But now she had a
[1:17:29] spiritual heart trouble because the boy
[1:17:31] that she was going to marry ran off and
[1:17:33] married someone else. And she was
[1:17:35] convinced that Johnny still loved her.
[1:17:37] And brother said, "No, snap out of it.
[1:17:39] You know, Johnny doesn't love you. He
[1:17:41] had the wrong kind of love for you. He
[1:17:42] had a selfish love for you. He didn't
[1:17:44] really love you at all because he went
[1:17:45] off and married the other girl. If he
[1:17:47] really mar loved you, he would have
[1:17:48] married you, but he's married this other
[1:17:50] person. But she had this she had this
[1:17:52] alternative reality that she had built.
[1:17:55] See what happens because of pain and
[1:17:56] hurt and things and you know people you
[1:17:58] know because life can be so
[1:17:59] overwhelming. People build a reality to
[1:18:01] live in a world that they can govern and
[1:18:05] they can control. That's why men and
[1:18:07] especially you know people can just go
[1:18:09] into an online gaming world cuz they
[1:18:11] can't cope with the real world. We're
[1:18:13] built to live in the real world. I'm not
[1:18:15] against technology. Okay? Not against
[1:18:18] social media. But you don't let it rule
[1:18:20] you.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be your thing that that
[1:18:22] that that you're you're only a person
[1:18:24] online. You should be a person offline
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; because what happens when you know
[1:18:29] you're you can't get your dopamine hit
[1:18:31] because the internet's gone. God forbid
[1:18:33] you lose your phone or you know all the,
[1:18:35] you know, the Wi-Fi crashes and mental,
[1:18:37] you know, all these troubles happen and
[1:18:39] the world has ended because you got you
[1:18:41] can't see, you know, your reels or
[1:18:43] whatever you're so caught up in your
[1:18:45] Instagram.
[1:18:46] We're not built to be so caught up in
[1:18:48] those. We're not meant to walk with
[1:18:50] those things. It's the enemy actually
[1:18:51] covering people over and isolating them.
[1:18:54] It leads to depression. It leads to
[1:18:56] anxiety. People who are so caught up in
[1:18:59] social media are depressed. That it does
[1:19:02] not make a fulfilling life. It doesn't
[1:19:04] make people feel happy. It makes people
[1:19:05] feel less happy because they begin to
[1:19:07] compare themselves with others. And news
[1:19:10] flash, all that stuff that's
[1:19:11] professional is all altered. Yeah,
[1:19:13] that's right.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; It used to be photoshopped. They'd take
[1:19:15] people's bodies and make them longer and
[1:19:17] taller and skinnier and all these
[1:19:18] things. And so, so the model or whoever
[1:19:21] it is that the people are looking at,
[1:19:22] they're not even that in real life. In
[1:19:24] real life, they can be this this tall
[1:19:26] and this wide. Photoshop makes them this
[1:19:28] tall and this wide. And people like,
[1:19:30] "Man, I can never be that way." Well,
[1:19:32] they could never be that way, too,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; cuz they were edited, right? And videos
[1:19:36] are edited. It's all being staged. It's
[1:19:38] not real. You say, "Man, I wish I could
[1:19:40] go on that holiday." And you don't
[1:19:41] realize that that person has a crew of
[1:19:43] 20 people around them. It's perfectly,
[1:19:45] you know, all you see is a little part
[1:19:47] of the holiday which is staged
[1:19:49] completely. It's not even real. Man, I
[1:19:51] wish I had that life. Even those people
[1:19:53] don't have that life cuz it's fake.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; But you see our brain, see the devil
[1:19:58] interprets it to you as that's real
[1:19:59] life.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; What's happened? That's the anointed
[1:20:02] cherub that coverth. We are not ordained
[1:20:05] to live in that kind of a world.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I ain't addicted to
[1:20:08] social media. I don't have those
[1:20:09] problems." What world have you built to
[1:20:12] cope? He is our hiding place. The word
[1:20:16] is our coping mechanism. Amen. The
[1:20:18] world, the word is our joy. I trust. I
[1:20:22] mean, you feel troubled, take a drink of
[1:20:24] the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Take a swig of the word. Amen. You feel
[1:20:28] down? Begin to read the promises of God.
[1:20:30] You say, "Well, does it really help?"
[1:20:32] Absolutely.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; He's my joy. He's my fountain.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; He's my everything. I can judge myself
[1:20:38] by the end of the week. how how how much
[1:20:40] I've been on my phone. If I've been on
[1:20:42] my phone too much, I'm down. I'm moody.
[1:20:45] I'm just being honest here. And I can
[1:20:47] see it. It's like, man, this plus this
[1:20:49] equals this. I don't want this anymore.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Why not live a happy, fulfilled life?
[1:20:55] Why not live a life where you're
[1:20:56] connected to your family? You say,
[1:20:57] "Well, they don't understand me." Try
[1:20:59] and make them understand you.
[1:21:02] You know, we're all You say, "Well, my
[1:21:04] parents should understand me and
[1:21:05] everything." They barely understand
[1:21:06] themselves.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. We don't have a book to
[1:21:10] be the perfect parent.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; None of us are perfect.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; All of us have stuffed up more than
[1:21:15] once.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Most of us never learn from our
[1:21:18] mistakes.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, a re a relationship
[1:21:22] is a two-way streak. See the same thing
[1:21:25] with us and God. You say, "God, speak to
[1:21:26] us. Oh, God. God, you got to reveal
[1:21:28] yourself." Well, what are you doing? Are
[1:21:30] you giving him something to work with? I
[1:21:32] mean, are you giving him the word to
[1:21:34] work with in your life? You say, "Well,
[1:21:35] I feel distant from God." Draw nigh to
[1:21:37] him. How do you draw nigh? Begin to read
[1:21:39] his word. Begin to listen to the
[1:21:41] message. Sing songs. Meditate on his
[1:21:43] goodness in your heart. And you'll find
[1:21:44] yourself drawing nigh to him. And he
[1:21:46] draws nigh to you. See, he did not make
[1:21:48] us robots. He never wanted some statue
[1:21:51] to know. He wanted someone with
[1:21:53] feelings, love, emotion, thoughts,
[1:21:55] self-will. That's how he made us, right?
[1:21:58] So, we've got to use our own self-will
[1:22:00] to draw nigh to him.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Because God never when you receive the
[1:22:06] Holy Ghost, you don't become a robot.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; I'm just automatically and nothing's
[1:22:11] wrong. I never have a problem. And you
[1:22:12] know, no, he didn't make us. God never
[1:22:15] wanted I would have hated it if just
[1:22:17] say, you know, I marry Christine. I
[1:22:20] would have hated it if she had no
[1:22:21] ambition, no desire, no personality, no
[1:22:25] drive, no differing opinion.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That would be a boring life.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That would be the dumbest thing.
[1:22:34] Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; You want someone that will push you,
[1:22:37] will motivate you, will challenge you,
[1:22:40] will bring the best out of you.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants from you.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; From us, right? He doesn't want a robot
[1:22:49] and just sits there and, you know, I'm
[1:22:51] just a believer. No, he wants you to be
[1:22:53] a person. He wants you to be living, you
[1:22:56] know, a living epistle. He wants to see
[1:22:58] himself in you.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Does God have ambition? Does God have
[1:23:02] love? Does God want to express himself?
[1:23:04] Does God want to reveal himself? Does
[1:23:06] God want to share his heart? Does God
[1:23:08] want to make memories?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Does God want to prove his character?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; He made you like that.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:18] Amen. But see, it's a very smoky day.
[1:23:21] It's not by accident. It's not like life
[1:23:23] has never changed. Now it's No. Where?
[1:23:25] How does the smoke come through? Through
[1:23:28] all these digital things. Through these
[1:23:30] things. It makes it smoky. We can't see.
[1:23:32] That's why it's so sad, you know,
[1:23:34] because people go back and they say,
[1:23:35] "Well, you know, over a hundred years
[1:23:37] ago, there'd be people like Charles
[1:23:39] Finny. They just stand up and say,
[1:23:40] "Repent or perish." And someone 3 miles
[1:23:42] away would give their life to the Lord.
[1:23:43] Go into a railway carriage, another
[1:23:45] person, the whole place would be
[1:23:46] converted. You say, "Well, what where's
[1:23:48] the power like that?" Now, the power is
[1:23:50] even greater now.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; But the smoke is here to try and stop
[1:23:54] the power. But I tell you, a
[1:23:55] predestinated seed will see through the
[1:23:57] smoke.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; God will get a hold of their lives.
[1:24:01] Amen. It's a different season that we're
[1:24:03] living in. See, it says in Zechariah,
[1:24:05] "It shall come to pass in the uh it
[1:24:07] shall come to pass in that day that the
[1:24:09] light shall not be clear nor dark." Why?
[1:24:11] Smoke. I mean, but it shall be one day
[1:24:14] which shall be known to the Lord, not
[1:24:15] day or night. But it shall come to pass
[1:24:17] at the evening time, it shall be light.
[1:24:20] So, there is light. You say, "Well, it's
[1:24:22] smoky." No, that's only part of the
[1:24:24] picture. It shall be light in the
[1:24:26] evening time, and it is the evening time
[1:24:28] now. It's the evening time of the church
[1:24:30] ages. Amen. Evening time of history. The
[1:24:33] millennium's going to come in soon. But
[1:24:35] before that, of course, there's the
[1:24:36] rapture and all these things. But it is
[1:24:38] the evening time. So God promised that
[1:24:40] it'll be this smoky day, not day or
[1:24:42] night, but in the evening time, it shall
[1:24:44] be light. Amen. It's the same thing when
[1:24:46] when Elijah when he stood there on Mount
[1:24:48] Carmel, it was the evening time
[1:24:50] sacrifice that he made.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what happened is there was all
[1:24:54] these opinions. See what happened is
[1:24:55] Satan came in, darkness came in and it
[1:24:58] was trying to trying to keep the people,
[1:25:01] you know, to keep sin in the dark. It
[1:25:05] was that anointed cherub, you know, that
[1:25:07] coverth came into Israel through Baal
[1:25:09] worship forced by Queen Jezebel. And but
[1:25:11] now the works of darkness were going to
[1:25:13] be brought out to the light. How does it
[1:25:15] get shown to the light when the light
[1:25:16] proves itself? When you see the
[1:25:18] contrast.
[1:25:20] Amen. So Elijah at the time of the
[1:25:23] evening sacrifice, what did he do? He he
[1:25:25] he prepared the altar. He prepared the,
[1:25:28] you know, prepared the sacrifice. He
[1:25:29] says, "Lord, may be known that I've done
[1:25:31] all this according to your word and that
[1:25:33] thou and and that the people would know
[1:25:35] that thou art the Lord God. Thou has
[1:25:37] turned their hearts back again." So what
[1:25:39] happened at the evening time sacrifice?
[1:25:41] The fire of God came down. The light
[1:25:43] came down and proved which was which.
[1:25:45] Because before that, you know, the
[1:25:47] Israelites were like, you know, you
[1:25:48] know, Elijah said, "If God is God,
[1:25:50] worship him. If Ba's Ba, worship him.
[1:25:52] Choose you this day." They between two
[1:25:54] opinions. Why? Because of smoke because
[1:25:57] it was a dismal day. There's different
[1:25:58] opinions and things going on. But then
[1:26:00] when the fire of God came down, amen, it
[1:26:03] proved exactly who was God. It
[1:26:05] vindicated God vindicated Elijah's
[1:26:08] message. I tell you what, he's done the
[1:26:10] same thing in the evening time today.
[1:26:11] Amen. Where the true sacrifice of God
[1:26:13] has been vindicated. Amen. The power of
[1:26:16] God has been vindicated. Why? By the
[1:26:17] pillar of fire returning back into the
[1:26:19] church. Amen. What's happened is God has
[1:26:21] come and vindicated. There is light in
[1:26:23] the evening time. Amen. That's why
[1:26:25] Elijah would stand in this day. Amen.
[1:26:27] Brother Bram would stand in this day and
[1:26:29] and and God would vindicate. He says,
[1:26:31] "If I'm a servant of God and what I've
[1:26:33] told you now is the truth, let him come
[1:26:34] down and prove that it's true." And God
[1:26:37] would come down, heal people, discern
[1:26:38] people, do things that were unique to
[1:26:40] his ministry. What was it? the evening
[1:26:42] time light
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; that he would prove what is light and
[1:26:46] what is not.
[1:26:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light has shone. Has has not
[1:26:51] our Lord Jesus Christ proved his word?
[1:26:54] Amen. Has he not proved that he's the
[1:26:55] same yesterday, today, and forever? I
[1:26:57] mean, he's proved that his atonement
[1:26:59] covers everything. Not just salvation,
[1:27:01] but healing, deliverance. Amen. Healing
[1:27:04] for the body, healing for the spirit,
[1:27:06] miracles. Amen. And the light has shone
[1:27:08] to prove and to show it's not mind over
[1:27:10] matter but it's you know just try and be
[1:27:13] a good person but there's power in the
[1:27:14] blood to change a person transform a
[1:27:17] person's life. Amen. This is what the
[1:27:19] light has done. Amen. That you know the
[1:27:22] light has shone to prove there's a true
[1:27:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And the light has
[1:27:28] shone to prove that our identification
[1:27:30] is not in a church but it's in Jesus
[1:27:33] Christ the word our sacrifice. Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what the message has done.
[1:27:39] Praise the Lord. What has it also done?
[1:27:42] It's shown that as as I said in the
[1:27:44] beginning, it proved that Satan is
[1:27:46] nothing but a bluff. I mean, when the
[1:27:48] first seal came open, that white horse
[1:27:50] rider, many people identified, even
[1:27:52] brother Bram did in the beginning when
[1:27:53] he mixed the horse rider, the white
[1:27:55] horse rider of Revelation 6 and
[1:27:56] Revelations 19 together as one because
[1:27:58] he thought it was Christ riding forth.
[1:28:00] But then when Christ came and opened the
[1:28:02] seals, revealed the reality of it is no.
[1:28:05] This one on a white horse with a bow, no
[1:28:07] arrows is not Christ. It is the
[1:28:10] antichrist. So the first revelation that
[1:28:12] opened up with the opening of the book,
[1:28:14] what was it? That he's nothing but a
[1:28:17] bluff.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; He's got a bow. He's got no arrows.
[1:28:20] Amen. He's got no weapon that can kill
[1:28:22] you. He'll just bluff you. But the
[1:28:24] problem is you. If we give Satan room,
[1:28:27] we give him power.
[1:28:30] He will have as much power in your life
[1:28:31] as you give him. So if something becomes
[1:28:34] a big massive problem in your life,
[1:28:36] you've given him a lot of power. Right?
[1:28:38] If it's nothing in your life, there's no
[1:28:40] power in it. And but what does he do? He
[1:28:42] comes in by deception, by putting in
[1:28:44] questions, make you think certain ways.
[1:28:46] And what happens? You think, man, this
[1:28:47] problem, I can't be free of this thing.
[1:28:49] Whatever's going to happen to me. What's
[1:28:50] happened? You've given it room.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; But when you stand back and say, "No,
[1:28:54] Satan, you're a bluff. You have no part
[1:28:56] of me. I've got no part in you. this
[1:28:58] this work of darkness, I'm bringing it
[1:29:00] to the light to to to reprove it.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That thing can't stand.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's nothing. He's nothing but a
[1:29:08] bluffer. Amen. That rider had no arrows
[1:29:10] for his bow. Did you notice he had a
[1:29:11] bow? There's nothing said about any
[1:29:14] arrows. So, he must be a bluffer, right?
[1:29:16] Maybe he's got a lot of thunder, but no
[1:29:17] lightning. But we find out Christ had
[1:29:19] both lightning and thunder. I mean, for
[1:29:21] out of his mouth goes a sharp twigged
[1:29:23] sword. He smites the nations with it.
[1:29:24] This guy can't smite nothing. You see,
[1:29:26] he's playing the part of a hypocrite.
[1:29:29] Amen.
[1:29:31] Amen. So, what does he what does Satan
[1:29:32] try and do? Make you go by feelings.
[1:29:34] This is not a complete list, but this is
[1:29:35] just a few things I put together. He
[1:29:37] tries to make you go by feelings. Do I
[1:29:39] feel safe today? It's got nothing to do
[1:29:41] with it. Do I feel like I'm like I'm an
[1:29:44] overcomer.
[1:29:46] You don't go by feelings. Feelings have
[1:29:48] no bottom to it. It's got no foundation.
[1:29:50] There's nothing to actually prove them
[1:29:51] with. You say, "Well, do you feel full
[1:29:54] of joy?" You know, do you do you feel
[1:29:56] like a Christian? There's some days I
[1:29:58] feel like I'm a Christian. Some days I
[1:29:59] don't, but I'm a Christian,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; right? Who's with me? I mean, tries to
[1:30:04] make you think you're no good or not
[1:30:05] worthy enough. He tries to because what
[1:30:07] is that? He tries to make us think that
[1:30:09] we have no right to the promises of God
[1:30:11] by what we have done. But the thing is
[1:30:14] the worshipper is never examined. It's
[1:30:16] the it's the sacrifice that's examined.
[1:30:19] It's if the sacrifice is worthy, then
[1:30:21] the worshipper becomes worthy. Amen. In
[1:30:23] the Old Testament, when a when a
[1:30:25] believer brought a lamb or a bullock or
[1:30:26] whatever to the priest, who was
[1:30:28] examined? Not the worshipper that
[1:30:30] brought the sacrifice. The sacrifice was
[1:30:32] examined. And if the sacrifice was found
[1:30:34] to be faultless, sinless, right? Then it
[1:30:37] would be offered on behalf of the
[1:30:38] worshipper. Friends, our lamb has been
[1:30:41] proven to be perfect without spot or
[1:30:43] blemish or any such thing. Amen. And
[1:30:45] because our sacrifice has been accepted,
[1:30:47] we become accepted. So it's not about
[1:30:50] our worthiness, it's about his
[1:30:52] worthiness. It's not about if we're good
[1:30:54] enough for long enough. No, it's what he
[1:30:56] has done that matters.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Tries to make us feel discouraged in
[1:31:00] ourselves. Who's been there?
[1:31:04] Amen. Tries to make us feel discouraged
[1:31:05] in ourselves or others. Tries to make us
[1:31:08] feel too ashamed to be trapped by our
[1:31:11] guilt. Even even victims of, you know,
[1:31:14] sexual sin or whatever it is, you know,
[1:31:16] that they weren't looking for it, but it
[1:31:17] found them. Satan will use a victim
[1:31:20] mentality to keep people a victim.
[1:31:22] And and what does Satan always do? It's
[1:31:25] your fault. You're the reason I did this
[1:31:27] to you. It was because you did such and
[1:31:29] such. This is why this has happened. And
[1:31:31] he puts the blame on the victim and not
[1:31:33] on the perpetrator. The perpetrator is
[1:31:35] Satan, by the way. Right? But so we must
[1:31:37] never let anything make us feel like we
[1:31:39] are at fault. We are the victim. No,
[1:31:43] it's Satan's fault.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Who's with me today?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the enemy's fault. Never sit
[1:31:48] there with a victim mentality.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, we are overcome. You say,
[1:31:52] "Well, I'm too ashamed. I can never
[1:31:54] confess my sins. I can never make things
[1:31:56] right." You know, that's that is the
[1:31:58] enemy making you feel that way because
[1:32:00] as soon as Satan is exposed, he becomes
[1:32:03] powerless. Right? If he's hidden in
[1:32:05] shadow, if you don't bring it into the
[1:32:07] light of the word, then he has power.
[1:32:09] You bring him into the light by
[1:32:10] confessing it, exposing it, then he
[1:32:12] loses his power.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will he will make us think we
[1:32:17] can never be free. He loves to keep us
[1:32:19] in a cycle up and down and up and down
[1:32:22] and up and down and he makes you think
[1:32:23] you'll never be free of this. What is
[1:32:25] that? That's the enemy trying to
[1:32:26] influence your life saying you're stuck
[1:32:27] like this. That's a lie. That is a big
[1:32:31] fat lie. Amen. He'll use your past
[1:32:33] against you.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll make you think you don't
[1:32:36] belong.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I remember the first time I came to a
[1:32:39] message church. You know what? You know
[1:32:40] what was in my head? Go leave. Leave. I
[1:32:44] was in churches before that. I never
[1:32:46] felt that way. That thought never came
[1:32:47] into mind. I came in amongst the truth
[1:32:49] and a and and a voice kept saying to me
[1:32:51] in my head, "Leave. Go out of here. You
[1:32:54] shouldn't be here." And I realized
[1:32:56] that's not me. That's the enemy. So I
[1:32:58] said, "Satan, I ain't going anywhere.
[1:32:59] You might as well get out."
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he Oh, you don't belong. You
[1:33:03] don't fit in with the young people. You
[1:33:05] don't fit in here. You're a misfit.
[1:33:06] We're all a misfit.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; We're all misfits.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We never fitted anywhere.
[1:33:13] That's why you tried to be I remember at
[1:33:14] school, you know, I got into the first
[1:33:16] 11 hockey team. Tried to be like a jock.
[1:33:18] Didn't fit there. Tried to be a nerd.
[1:33:19] Didn't really fit in there. Tried to be
[1:33:21] in this group and this group. Didn't
[1:33:22] really fit anywhere. But then one day,
[1:33:24] Jesus found me.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I realized this is where I belong.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you do? He make you think
[1:33:31] you don't fit. You don't belong here.
[1:33:32] That's a lie. Everyone belongs. Everyone
[1:33:34] is the same value. Everyone is
[1:33:36] important. Everyone's loved. Accepted.
[1:33:39] Amen. You never ever think that you
[1:33:41] don't belong as part of the body of
[1:33:42] Christ. That's the devil trying to ward
[1:33:44] you off, keep you isolated. I mean,
[1:33:46] he'll make you think you can handle sin.
[1:33:49] He'll make you think, yeah, you can you
[1:33:51] can handle this habit, this thing. It's
[1:33:53] just a it's just innocent.
[1:33:56] It will always grow and become something
[1:33:58] that will devour you.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Okay? It doesn't matter how innocent it
[1:34:02] appears, how secret it is, it will
[1:34:04] always devour you. Always come back and
[1:34:06] bite you.
[1:34:08] Amen.
[1:34:10] He will always he'll he'll make you
[1:34:12] think the word is not for you.
[1:34:14] Well, the word's not for him. That's why
[1:34:16] he makes you think it's not for you. I
[1:34:18] mean, he always give you reasons why he
[1:34:20] should stay in your life. You enjoy this
[1:34:22] more. This is fun. Just a bit of
[1:34:24] harmless fun. You know, people go online
[1:34:26] and they have this online persona. They
[1:34:28] start flirting and, you know, sexing and
[1:34:30] all these things. It's just some
[1:34:31] harmless fun. It's not going to hurt
[1:34:33] anyone. That's sin.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's harming you. See? See, what
[1:34:37] happens is the devil wants to devalue
[1:34:39] you in your own eyes. That's why men and
[1:34:41] women throw themselves at people trying
[1:34:43] to find love, trying to find security
[1:34:45] somewhere. They don't value themselves.
[1:34:47] Amen. Because the devil wants to devalue
[1:34:49] you. You are worth more than 10,000
[1:34:51] worlds. Amen. You're more valuable than
[1:34:53] the blood of Jesus Christ. Because if
[1:34:56] Jesus thought that he his blood was more
[1:34:58] valuable than you, he would never have
[1:34:59] died for you.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Right? Because remember, if you buy
[1:35:02] something, the thing you buy in your
[1:35:04] eyes is more valuable than the money you
[1:35:06] have.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, you'd never buy it. So
[1:35:09] Jesus saw you and he saw his own life.
[1:35:11] He says, "No, you are more valuable than
[1:35:13] me." And he's the prince of life, the
[1:35:15] king of glory. Amen. So never ever let
[1:35:18] the enemy devalue you in your own eyes.
[1:35:20] You're very valuable and you're
[1:35:22] incredibly valuable person. You say,
[1:35:23] "There's nothing good about me." No,
[1:35:25] there is. The devil just doesn't want
[1:35:26] you to see it.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] Amen. He will make you think and he
[1:35:32] always make give you reasons why. You
[1:35:34] know if things are hidden, if you have
[1:35:36] to justify a reason to keep things
[1:35:38] secret from your family, from your
[1:35:40] spouse, it's wrong.
[1:35:43] We don't need locked chats on our
[1:35:45] phones.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; We don't need to reason though. Oh no,
[1:35:48] but I need to keep this secret. Why?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Why do you need See, what is that?
[1:35:52] That's him. The devil being a wedge
[1:35:56] trying to get between you and your
[1:35:57] spouse, between you and your family. Oh,
[1:36:00] but you know, they they just won't
[1:36:02] understand.
[1:36:03] How many predators have said to some
[1:36:05] kid, "This is our special thing.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; This is our special. Don't tell mom and
[1:36:10] dad. They won't understand what we
[1:36:12] have."
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's a demon power.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; That's a demon power. See, but it's
[1:36:17] reasoning trying to say, "Don't tell.
[1:36:19] Just keep this secret. It's just it's
[1:36:21] just online. It's harmless. It's not
[1:36:23] going to hurt anybody. It's trapped you.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; It ain't worth it.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; You are more valuable than that thing.
[1:36:32] And people who initiate those things,
[1:36:35] men come along to girls whatever more
[1:36:36] and they initiate those things. They
[1:36:38] don't care about themselves. They don't
[1:36:39] care about the person.
[1:36:41] You say, "Well, no, I've got to keep
[1:36:43] these things secret. I've got to keep it
[1:36:44] locked away." That's where the devil
[1:36:46] works. But when you bring it to the
[1:36:48] light,
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, my my spouse will be
[1:36:52] upset." They should be.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; They should be. Why are you keeping
[1:36:55] secrets? I got no secrets.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Transparency is good.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; I don't want the devil in my life. I
[1:37:03] don't want to give him just a little bit
[1:37:04] of a toenail,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; let alone an inch.
[1:37:10] But you see what happens is reasoning
[1:37:12] comes along
[1:37:13] because people the the devil tries to
[1:37:16] get get them to think you can keep this
[1:37:20] thing.
[1:37:22] But what happens is people become a
[1:37:23] human shield by agreeing to the devil's
[1:37:26] reasoning.
[1:37:29] Do you want to live like that? Is she
[1:37:31] happy? Is she feeling at peace?
[1:37:35] What's she doing? She's become a human
[1:37:37] shield. You say, "Well, it's against my
[1:37:38] will." You have to agree to the enemy
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; for him to have any control in your
[1:37:44] life.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; He'll try and trap you into things, but
[1:37:48] your human will, you give your human
[1:37:49] will over and you become a human shield.
[1:37:52] And then he starts firing things through
[1:37:54] your life and you're frozen in fear
[1:37:55] because he says, "This is you. You're
[1:37:58] born this way. You just this is just
[1:38:00] from your upbringing. This is because of
[1:38:02] this just your nature and this is why
[1:38:03] you're this way." And you got to
[1:38:05] realize, no, this is not me. This is the
[1:38:08] enemy. What if she just begin running?
[1:38:12] You don't want to be like that. You
[1:38:13] don't want to live your life as a human
[1:38:14] shield. Gossip comes out, lust comes
[1:38:17] out, perversion comes out, control comes
[1:38:21] out, hatred, malice, strife, jealousy
[1:38:23] come out. It's just cuz there's a human
[1:38:25] shield.
[1:38:26] We're not built to be that way. That's
[1:38:28] an anointed cherub that coverth trying
[1:38:31] to keep you under his control.
[1:38:35] But God is here. I know I've been going
[1:38:38] down this way, but I tell you what,
[1:38:39] friends, God is here to destroy
[1:38:44] the yoke of the enemy. Amen. The yoke of
[1:38:46] the enemy is destroyed because of the
[1:38:48] anointing. So in other words, that
[1:38:50] soldier with his gun is destroyed by the
[1:38:53] anointing.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where where we don't have to be
[1:38:56] under the yoke and control by the enemy
[1:38:58] no more. You say, "Well, all my friends
[1:39:00] do it." You're not live. You shouldn't
[1:39:02] live according to what your friends do.
[1:39:04] You should live according to what your
[1:39:06] the word says. Well, it's expected of
[1:39:08] me. I won't fit in and all these
[1:39:09] problem. No, peer pressure is a demon.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Peer pressure is a big fat demon. You
[1:39:14] don't have to buckle down to that thing.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You can be free.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the yoke is destroyed because
[1:39:20] of the anointing. So, any any kind of
[1:39:22] you know you the enemy the the anointing
[1:39:25] of the enemy is destroyed which is a
[1:39:27] yoke by the anointing of God. Now I tell
[1:39:30] you what, we should ask a question. What
[1:39:33] is within us to do it?
[1:39:36] Amen. I preached on the statue of a
[1:39:37] perfect man a bit last Sunday and how
[1:39:39] there's virtue, there's strength in our
[1:39:41] lives. You know, we should create an
[1:39:43] atmosphere and an environment that if
[1:39:45] the enemy has got into someone's life
[1:39:46] through indifference or sin or, you
[1:39:48] know, whatever it is that they should
[1:39:50] have liberty to say, I can bring this to
[1:39:53] the light and I won't be condemned.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; I won't be I won't be made feel little.
[1:39:58] I won't be put on some probation. I
[1:40:00] won't put No, I will be restored. There
[1:40:03] should be an atmosphere of the Holy
[1:40:04] Ghost in our lives that someone can come
[1:40:06] to you and say, "Look, I've been
[1:40:08] struggling with this and I need you to
[1:40:09] help me with this thing." And there
[1:40:11] should be something in you say,
[1:40:12] "Absolutely, my brother." I mean, I want
[1:40:14] to see that out of your life, too. We're
[1:40:16] in this together. I mean, you should
[1:40:18] have an attitude around you that you
[1:40:19] don't look down and say, "Oh, I thought
[1:40:20] so."
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, eventually, yes, but you've
[1:40:26] got to do what I say. you you know we're
[1:40:28] not here to push one another down.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; If you are like that, you've got the
[1:40:32] wrong spirit.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; You've got a luciferian religious spirit
[1:40:35] that just wants to destroy people. But
[1:40:37] if you got the spirit of Christ, you
[1:40:39] should have virtue in you, strength that
[1:40:41] can be imparted. Amen. That can be that
[1:40:44] can be transferred. Amen. That a person
[1:40:46] can receive strength that they can
[1:40:48] receive faith to overcome the thing
[1:40:50] that's in their life. Amen. Because you
[1:40:52] got to realize that you shall know the
[1:40:54] truth and the truth shall make you free.
[1:40:56] So always bring everything to to the
[1:40:58] truth.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Bring every problem. Bring everything
[1:41:01] you know the devil wants to keep it
[1:41:02] secret in your life. Bring it out to the
[1:41:04] open
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; and you shall know the truth and the
[1:41:08] truth shall make you free. There's
[1:41:10] power. There's a force within the truth
[1:41:12] to liberate anyone from anything.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And where is that truth now?
[1:41:17] Because he is the way, the truth, and
[1:41:19] life. He is a person. He should be in
[1:41:20] you. Right. So there should be a power
[1:41:23] within. Are we all together today? Is
[1:41:24] this all right? Amen. Got to realize you
[1:41:26] are you are equipped
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; to liberate. You're equipped. Amen. To
[1:41:31] march up to the window, snap that rifle,
[1:41:34] stab it through the guy, and free the
[1:41:36] woman and the child.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, you got an anointing about you,
[1:41:39] the Holy Ghost, to liberate anyone
[1:41:41] living in fear.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; That's afraid that if people really knew
[1:41:46] who I was, what would they do with me?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; It takes courage to step away from the
[1:41:52] window. It takes courage to say actually
[1:41:55] this is what's going on in my because
[1:41:56] none of us really know our real self. I
[1:41:59] mean each other, right? Because even I
[1:42:01] say myself, you see me maybe this way.
[1:42:05] You don't live with me, right? You don't
[1:42:08] see me every day, every moment. You just
[1:42:10] see maybe this guy. You maybe think I
[1:42:11] just walk around like this all the time.
[1:42:14] You know, I used to think like brother
[1:42:16] Bram, you just hear him preaching. You
[1:42:17] think he's always a serious guy and he's
[1:42:18] always like this. And then I saw Sister
[1:42:20] Rebecca Smith, Brandon Smith's
[1:42:22] slideshow, and he used to dress up in a
[1:42:24] cowboy suit and dance around in the
[1:42:25] backyard and let off pressure and pull
[1:42:27] jokes and pranks and all these things,
[1:42:29] you know. I thought, who is this guy?
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; But you see, I picked up a wrong
[1:42:34] perception of who he really was cuz he
[1:42:36] was a natural man. He was a real person.
[1:42:39] He wasn't just a stiff starchy preacher
[1:42:41] all the time,
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; right? He was a real person.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; What about us now? We never want to put
[1:42:47] a per perception on young people they
[1:42:49] have to be a serious can't joke. We
[1:42:52] should be able to be deep and shallow at
[1:42:54] the same time.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; We should be able to be frivolous and
[1:42:56] laugh and joke but then also serious.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; There should be an ability within us to
[1:43:01] go deep or be shallow.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you're only deep, there's a
[1:43:05] problem. If you're just shallow, there's
[1:43:06] a problem. You should be able to
[1:43:08] actually open up to someone, talk, they
[1:43:09] should be able to come to you with a
[1:43:10] serious thing or with a joke.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And you should be able to joke, too. God
[1:43:14] has a sense of humor.
[1:43:16] Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Yep. Look at the platypus.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Look at there's a seagull kind of
[1:43:23] seabird with blue feet. There's all
[1:43:25] these things in nature. If you think
[1:43:26] God's a serious god all the time, look
[1:43:28] at those things.
[1:43:30] You say, "Look at the kiwi. Look at
[1:43:32] these ridiculous things that run, you
[1:43:33] know." Oh, don't don't step on that.
[1:43:36] Well,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; you know, when that thing went to
[1:43:38] England the first time, someone actually
[1:43:39] thought someone stitched it all together
[1:43:41] from different birds. I think this thing
[1:43:43] can't be real. Oh, it is.
[1:43:46] But you know, we can't always be this
[1:43:47] tense thing. We got to be relaxed. We
[1:43:50] should be able to be ourselves.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not God is not a cookie
[1:43:54] cutter. He wants us to He wants you to
[1:43:56] be you and him.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] Amen. So, you shall know the truth and
[1:44:02] the truth shall make you free. There's
[1:44:04] power in it.
[1:44:06] Amen. So big. See, even would say in in
[1:44:09] it say, "Brethren, if any man be
[1:44:10] overtaken in a fault, ye which are
[1:44:12] spiritual, restore such in one in the
[1:44:15] spirit of meekness." Amen. So it doesn't
[1:44:17] say if any man be overtaken at a fault
[1:44:20] which is spiritual. Just say you forgive
[1:44:22] them but push them down for a little
[1:44:23] bit. No, restore them in the spirit of
[1:44:26] meekness. To restore someone is to
[1:44:28] restore them to what they were
[1:44:29] originally.
[1:44:31] Amen. Which is their position in Christ
[1:44:34] as an overcomer made in his image.
[1:44:36] That's full restoration. That's what the
[1:44:38] blood does. So, what is God saying? He's
[1:44:40] saying you must do that. And the spirit
[1:44:42] of meekness restore. If someone's
[1:44:44] tripped and fallen down, you don't leave
[1:44:46] them in the mud.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; You don't even pick them up and leave
[1:44:49] them in muddy clothes. Who's ever I'd
[1:44:50] never seen a mum in my life. Their
[1:44:52] little boys running around. He goes
[1:44:54] outside and he's just a mud ball. Or
[1:44:56] maybe he's in the mud and she just picks
[1:44:58] him up and, you know, lets him run
[1:45:01] inside covered in mud. Who does that?
[1:45:05] The mum's like pulling their feet in
[1:45:07] their shoes right now, imagining that,
[1:45:09] right? But you see, what do they do?
[1:45:10] They take them, they wash them, they
[1:45:12] clean them, they give a new set of
[1:45:14] clothes, and they what they do? They
[1:45:16] restore them to how they were before
[1:45:18] they fell in the mud.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; That's restoration, right? And should
[1:45:22] not that same anointing be upon us, if
[1:45:24] someone's raised, it doesn't matter,
[1:45:26] adult, young, whatever, they fall, they
[1:45:28] trip, they they even willfully fall into
[1:45:30] sin. But then they but but thing is if
[1:45:33] God is dealing with you, if there's
[1:45:34] something in you says, "I want out of
[1:45:36] this thing, there's a way out for you.
[1:45:38] There's a place at the table." Amen. But
[1:45:40] but so if someone even willfully does
[1:45:42] it, should not there be a spirit of
[1:45:44] meekness within us to restore that
[1:45:46] person? Should we not be that way?
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You know, cuz I hate to say it, many
[1:45:51] people, they want to keep someone in
[1:45:52] some kind of second category as a
[1:45:54] believer because of things they've done,
[1:45:56] hold their past against them. God
[1:45:58] doesn't hold your past against you. If
[1:46:00] you have sincerely repented, you you're
[1:46:02] placed under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:04] Amen. On your record of your life, that
[1:46:07] thing is gone.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; And then we bring it up because it bring
[1:46:10] comes back in our mind. We say, "Lord,
[1:46:12] forgive me again." And he looks at his
[1:46:13] records. He says, "What is that? What
[1:46:15] are you talking about?
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; I can't remember." God has the ability
[1:46:19] to forget.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Forgive and forget. Amen. We should have
[1:46:23] the ability to forgive and let it go.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, but they should have known better.
[1:46:29] We all should have known better.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Satan should have known better.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; He was in the presence of God. He saw
[1:46:34] the glory of God.
[1:46:37] So we So I pray we have that ability. We
[1:46:40] can restore one in the spirit of
[1:46:42] meekness. Not keep them pushed down, but
[1:46:44] restore them to how they were before
[1:46:47] they fell. God help us.
[1:46:50] Amen. There should be, as I said, a
[1:46:52] strength, a virtue that comes out of us.
[1:46:54] Like when when the woman touched the hem
[1:46:56] of his garment, Jesus stopped and said,
[1:46:58] "I perceive that virtue has gone out of
[1:47:00] me." Amen. But now you take it the other
[1:47:02] side there. It should be more than just
[1:47:05] someone getting virtue out of you, but
[1:47:06] you should be able to impart a strength.
[1:47:09] Amen. To break the yoke of the enemy.
[1:47:11] And that's what that's what Peter Peter
[1:47:14] and John when they walking past the
[1:47:16] gate. Beautiful. There was a crippled
[1:47:17] man. He was there for a very long time.
[1:47:20] Didn't even go into the church. He's
[1:47:21] just crippled by the door, hanging
[1:47:23] around the believers on the on the
[1:47:26] peripheral of the church, how I put it
[1:47:28] that way. And he was crippled and many
[1:47:30] people just stepped over and saw him
[1:47:31] crippled and left him there and left him
[1:47:33] in that state. I tell you what, they had
[1:47:35] no virtue. They had no strength that
[1:47:37] they could impart because they did not
[1:47:39] have the Holy Ghost. But here came Peter
[1:47:41] and John, amen, in a season. And they
[1:47:43] saw him and they didn't walk over him.
[1:47:44] They didn't just they weren't just
[1:47:45] sympathetic to him being in this state.
[1:47:47] They said, "Look on us.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Silver and gold we have done." But such
[1:47:51] as we have, give we unto thee in the
[1:47:53] name of Jesus Christ. Raise up and walk.
[1:47:55] What happened? Virtue, strength came out
[1:47:57] of them into him that he was restored
[1:48:00] back as a healthy, strong, well person.
[1:48:03] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, that's just
[1:48:04] a physical thing." No. What about
[1:48:05] spiritual healing?
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; What about a broken heart? What about
[1:48:09] what about a broken, you know, a broken
[1:48:11] spirit? There's regret and pain and
[1:48:13] anguish. You just overflooded someone
[1:48:15] and they and they're crippled on the
[1:48:17] ground spiritually.
[1:48:18] I believe there is a there's a virtue
[1:48:21] within us
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; that we can look at that person and say,
[1:48:24] "God, use me to help that person. Use me
[1:48:28] to lift them up. Take them by the
[1:48:30] shoulder. Be a friend. Oh, it's got to
[1:48:32] be a supernatural thing." Many things
[1:48:34] are so naturally supernatural. Amen.
[1:48:36] Where you can begin to talk to someone,
[1:48:38] show you're a buddy, don't condemn them,
[1:48:40] don't be judgmental, just be friendly to
[1:48:42] them, show love.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; And what happens? that that anointed
[1:48:45] chur begins to lose his grip
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; on that person. They begin to come to
[1:48:49] the light. Why? Because they the light
[1:48:51] has come to them through you
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; by the life you live, how you talk, how
[1:48:55] you conduct yourself with a real heart
[1:48:57] of love, genuine concern. What's that?
[1:49:00] That is the light coming.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:06] Amen.
[1:49:08] Because why love or charity shall cover
[1:49:11] a multitude of sins. Amen. You have a
[1:49:13] power if you have the Holy Ghost. You
[1:49:15] have the power to forgive. Not by just
[1:49:18] accepting an apology. You have a power
[1:49:19] to forgive someone. Amen. By the spirit
[1:49:22] of God within you that you can actually
[1:49:24] forgive that person. But that in that
[1:49:26] forgiveness is a restoration.
[1:49:28] Amen. I believe it.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; I believe someone can hurt us or hurt
[1:49:32] someone and you can because Christ is in
[1:49:34] you say, "I forgive you, brother. I
[1:49:36] forgive you, sister. I don't hold it
[1:49:38] against you at all."
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you actually, not in your
[1:49:43] head, but from your heart, you do that.
[1:49:45] And what happens? That thing is no
[1:49:46] longer hanging over them because the
[1:49:48] devil wants to use guilt and remorse to
[1:49:50] keep someone chained down. But someone
[1:49:52] who's got virtue of the Holy Ghost can
[1:49:54] break that out of their lives. They can
[1:49:56] raise up to what they were in the
[1:49:58] beginning.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, is it really that
[1:50:01] important about true forgiveness?"
[1:50:03] Absolutely. Cuz here we have in 2
[1:50:05] Corinthians, this is after, of course,
[1:50:07] Paul has written the first letter where
[1:50:08] he's rebuking the Corinthian church
[1:50:10] because there's a there's a man who's
[1:50:12] been sleeping with the stepmom, I think
[1:50:13] it is. And you know, and then he's
[1:50:15] rebuking this thing and and then you
[1:50:17] know, you know, the Corinthians have
[1:50:19] made it right. There's been there's been
[1:50:20] repentance and restitution and all these
[1:50:22] things taking place. But then he says,
[1:50:24] "So that contra-wise, we ought rather to
[1:50:27] forgive him." Talking about that man,
[1:50:29] "and comfort him, least perhaps such a
[1:50:32] one should be swallowed up with over
[1:50:34] much sorrow." So here is a man who's,
[1:50:37] you know, the light has shone into his
[1:50:39] life. He's seen the error of his ways.
[1:50:41] He's made it right. He's repented all
[1:50:43] these things. Now he's sitting there
[1:50:45] instead of being restored. Now, now he's
[1:50:47] at a crossroads. And it's up to the
[1:50:49] believer where he will go.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "Really? Yeah. Yeah, your
[1:50:53] attitude towards someone can can
[1:50:55] determine their eternal destination.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; You have power within you.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so now he's at a crossroads.
[1:51:03] And do you think the devil wants this
[1:51:04] man restored?
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; He wants him down out, lost, wandering
[1:51:10] somewhere condemned in his own spirit.
[1:51:13] And this is why he says, "Lest perhaps
[1:51:15] as such one should be swallowed up with
[1:51:16] over much sorrow." Cuz he's sitting here
[1:51:19] with this pain. He's know what he's
[1:51:20] done. He's know what he's brought in.
[1:51:22] broader reproach and all these things.
[1:51:23] But now Paul's saying, "Wherefore, so
[1:51:25] because of this, I beseech you that you
[1:51:28] should confirm your love towards him.
[1:51:30] For to this end also did I write that I
[1:51:33] might know the proof of you, whether you
[1:51:36] be obedient in all things."
[1:51:39] So it's not just being obedient, church
[1:51:41] order, doing the right things that way.
[1:51:43] But what about forgiveness? What about
[1:51:45] the spirit of Christ within us restoring
[1:51:48] someone?
[1:51:50] To whom ye forgave anything, I forgive
[1:51:52] also. For if I forgave anything, to whom
[1:51:55] I forgave it, for your sakes forgave um
[1:51:58] I it in the person of Christ. Least
[1:52:01] Satan should have an advantage of us.
[1:52:03] For we are not ignorant to his devices.
[1:52:06] So he's saying that he says you need to
[1:52:08] confirm your love towards him. You got
[1:52:12] to show, hey, this is done. God's taking
[1:52:15] care of it. You're free to walk on with
[1:52:17] Christ. You don't need this thing to be
[1:52:18] a ball and chain around your spiritual
[1:52:20] feet. But you can now walk on in
[1:52:22] confidence knowing that the Lord has
[1:52:23] forgiven you. The blood of Jesus Christ
[1:52:25] has cleansed you. And let's go forward,
[1:52:27] man. Let's walk on together. We're in
[1:52:29] this together. You're my brother. I'm
[1:52:31] your brother. We are one body. That's
[1:52:34] confirming your love. Look, look, you're
[1:52:35] not a secondass citizen. You're not down
[1:52:37] in the back or because of you got to be
[1:52:39] on probation somewhere. No, you've been
[1:52:41] restored. You've shown genuine
[1:52:43] repentance. We genuinely forgive you.
[1:52:45] We've embraced you with a spirit of
[1:52:47] meekness that you'll be restored. Amen.
[1:52:49] And so why is that that that that over
[1:52:52] much sorrow would swallow him up? How
[1:52:55] many people sadly have sat with
[1:52:56] condemnation when they shouldn't feel
[1:52:59] condemned when they shouldn't?
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is that? That's the devil
[1:53:03] putting that wedge in to to keep them
[1:53:06] separated from the body of Christ.
[1:53:07] Because that's why Paul said less Satan
[1:53:09] should have an advantage of us for we
[1:53:11] are not ignorant of his devices. So he
[1:53:14] gets exposed. It comes to the light but
[1:53:18] then healing's got to take place.
[1:53:19] Restoration's got to take place. And
[1:53:21] that was the but then the devil tries to
[1:53:24] get in during that time to keep
[1:53:26] separation, keep someone down.
[1:53:30] So I'm going to let's have the musicians
[1:53:32] um this morning. I think I just finished
[1:53:34] there.
[1:53:35] Maybe I didn't cover these things
[1:53:37] exactly like I really should have, but I
[1:53:39] want to ask you the question. Are you
[1:53:41] living like this today in your own
[1:53:44] private life? Are you living like this?
[1:53:47] You see that there's a gun, there's
[1:53:49] pain, there's hurt being inflicted by
[1:53:51] things you're doing, but you but you're
[1:53:54] so afraid
[1:53:56] to expose those things to bring it to
[1:53:58] the light that you're just a human
[1:53:59] shield for the enemy. God never made you
[1:54:02] to be a human shield for Satan. He made
[1:54:04] you to be the temple of the living God
[1:54:07] where it's not shots fired and people
[1:54:08] get wounded and hurt because of words we
[1:54:10] say and actions we do because of because
[1:54:12] of a spirit that's motivating our lives
[1:54:15] but it's the love of God
[1:54:18] is
[1:54:23] restoration
[1:54:31] there's something in your life that's
[1:54:33] hidden
[1:54:33] Do you think, well, I can't confess it.
[1:54:35] I can't make that right. I can't, you
[1:54:36] know, and and your life has become
[1:54:38] increasingly isolated.
[1:54:41] I'd say
[1:54:43] that's happening. You don't have to live
[1:54:45] like that. You can walk free.
[1:54:48] Amen. So, let's stand this morning.
[1:54:55] I think let's pray. Let's just let's
[1:54:57] just bow our heads this morning. And
[1:55:00] I'll ask you the question. If you want
[1:55:02] to be if you want to be free that virtue
[1:55:05] can flow out of your life that you can
[1:55:07] strengthen one another, you raise your
[1:55:09] hand.
[1:55:10] Amen. Because by accepting one, you're
[1:55:13] turning down the other. I mean, you want
[1:55:15] the spirit of God to live through that
[1:55:16] you don't push people down, but there's
[1:55:18] a strength comes out. People feel
[1:55:19] strengthened. They feel stabilized. They
[1:55:22] feel closer to God because they've been
[1:55:24] in your atmosphere.
[1:55:26] Amen. Let's pray together. Gracious
[1:55:28] Father, I have both hands raised. Lord,
[1:55:31] as we've gone through this morning, the
[1:55:32] tactics of the enemy, how you made him
[1:55:34] to be that anointed cherub that coverth
[1:55:37] to to block or to give access to your
[1:55:39] presence and how after he fell, he's
[1:55:42] still in that function trying to block
[1:55:44] us off from your goodness, from your
[1:55:46] spirit, Lord, to try and keep us
[1:55:48] isolated and under his influence. But,
[1:55:50] Father, we we are so thankful we can
[1:55:52] bring everything to the light. We don't
[1:55:54] need to hide anything. It doesn't matter
[1:55:56] how ashamed we may feel, how guilty,
[1:55:58] Lord, we want to bring everything to the
[1:56:00] light. We don't want the devil to work
[1:56:01] any part of our lives at all. And
[1:56:03] Father, you see the hands that have been
[1:56:05] raised, Lord, that we desire that Lord,
[1:56:07] when people come into our presence, that
[1:56:10] you would flow, Lord, that your virtue,
[1:56:13] your strength of your Holy Spirit would
[1:56:15] flow out of our lives, oh God, not even
[1:56:18] consciously, but just the atmosphere of
[1:56:19] your presence around us, Lord. the words
[1:56:21] we speak, Lord, the the love we show,
[1:56:25] Lord, would would strengthen those
[1:56:27] around us, oh God, that people would say
[1:56:28] after they came to church or came into
[1:56:30] our presence, something's touched me.
[1:56:33] Something's influenced my life.
[1:56:34] Something's happened. And we can say,
[1:56:35] "Virtues flowed out into that person."
[1:56:38] May you grant that, dear God. Father,
[1:56:40] may we never be judgmental, push anyone
[1:56:42] down, but Lord, may our hearts just be
[1:56:44] restoration, wanting to see our brother
[1:56:47] or sister restored. May we just be so
[1:56:50] loving, Lord, that people would not want
[1:56:52] to hide anything that's bad, but they
[1:56:54] would want to expose the enemy, knowing
[1:56:56] that this is a safe place, that they can
[1:56:58] make things right, that they can be
[1:56:59] free. Granted, dear God, I pray you'd
[1:57:02] forgive us of our sins and our wrongs.
[1:57:04] Lord Jesus, I pray for anyone here who's
[1:57:06] isolated themselves online or some
[1:57:08] alternative world and they're and
[1:57:09] they're trapped in something they can't
[1:57:11] get out of. Dear God, I believe your
[1:57:12] grace is here to liberate them. So,
[1:57:14] Father, even now, Lord, I pray you touch
[1:57:16] them. May they see they're valuable.
[1:57:18] They're more valuable than that thing
[1:57:19] that's caged them. Oh God, they're worth
[1:57:21] more than 10,000 worlds. Lord Jesus, may
[1:57:23] they walk free, Lord. I believe your
[1:57:25] anointing here is is here to destroy the
[1:57:27] yoke of the enemy. Father, I pray you'll
[1:57:29] bless each one. We thank you, Lord, in
[1:57:31] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:57:35] Amen.
[1:57:36] Amen. What song you got there, bro?

[2:11:30] name, Lord. Thank you. You will heal.
[2:11:32] You will restore. Glory to your name, oh
[2:11:35] God. Thank you so much, dear God.
[2:11:37] Father, I pray, Lord, as we go into
[2:11:39] lunch now, may your anointing be with
[2:11:41] us, Lord. I pray, Father, that you would
[2:11:44] shine your light upon our lives, Lord.
[2:11:46] That we would not be reasoning why to
[2:11:48] keep anything in darkness, but Lord, may
[2:11:50] we have such a desire, Lord. I want to
[2:11:52] be saturated by your light of your word.
[2:11:54] I don't want any part of the shadow of
[2:11:56] darkness in my life at all. I want you
[2:11:58] to live, oh God. I want you to expose
[2:12:00] me, Lord. If there's anything in me,
[2:12:01] Lord, created us a clean heart. Lord,
[2:12:03] search us and try us, Lord. If there be
[2:12:05] any evil in us, oh God, take it from us
[2:12:07] in the name of Jesus Christ. Grant it,
[2:12:09] Father. We commit our lives into your
[2:12:11] hands. We thank you for this day. And I
[2:12:13] pray, Father, your anointing would flow
[2:12:14] into our lives like never before.
[2:12:16] Father, as we go to lunch, we go into
[2:12:17] the world, Lord. Job, school, wherever
[2:12:19] it is, Lord. I pray your virtue of your
[2:12:21] Holy Spirit, Lord, will flow out of our
[2:12:24] lives into broken, damaged hearts. Oh
[2:12:26] God, bring a restoration, Lord. Bring
[2:12:28] redemption, Lord, to everyone we come
[2:12:30] across. Father, grant it in Jesus
[2:12:32] Christ's name. We thank you for the
[2:12:33] power of your blood, Lord, which washes
[2:12:36] away every sin. Glory to your name.
[2:12:38] Lord, I pray that we would not allow the
[2:12:40] enemy to use our past against us. Lord,
[2:12:42] we condemn his works in the name of
[2:12:44] Jesus Christ. Satan, you're nothing but
[2:12:45] a bluff. You've been exposed as nothing
[2:12:47] but a bluff. We give you no power. We
[2:12:49] turn our backs on you, Satan, in the
[2:12:51] name of Jesus Christ. We turn down your
[2:12:53] thoughts. We want to take everything
[2:12:54] back to the word of God. Hallelujah. We
[2:12:57] praise your name, Lord. We ask you
[2:12:58] dismiss us with your blessing now. We
[2:13:00] thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
