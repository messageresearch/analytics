Jeremiah no the book of Isaiah sorry chapter 35 I want to um sorry can you turn this down Brother Andy I just want to uh really touch on a few things that we spoke about Thursday night I thought it was be good to bring bring this morning and uh let's just read let's just read the entire chapter of Isaiah 35 let's see here so the Wilderness and the solitary Place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and Blossom as the rose it shall Blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy in singing The Glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it the Excell Excellency of carel and Chiron they shall see the glory of the Lord and the Excellency of our God strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with a recompense and he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as a as in heart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall Waters break out and streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become a pool and the Thirsty land Springs of water and the habitation of dragons each shall uh where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes and an Highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men uh though fools shall not ear therein no lion shall be there nor any ravenous Beast shall be shall go up thereon it shall it shall not be found but the redeemed shall walk there and The Ransom of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting Joy uh upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away Hallelujah may the Lord bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord now uh I I hardly I feel like I've got a bit too much hair on my FK this morning but I want to I want to I know brother Isaac preached on balance a couple of weeks ago and I think I couldn't find the recordings they've disappeared into somewhere so I don't know what he touched on but I want to uh speak about uh I want to speak about this chapter here and I want to really uh if I could give this a a title in some way I say where are you on the road we understand that there is one way it's not it's not a two-way traffic there's one way and we read there a highway there shall be and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wering men through Falls shall not a therein and we read a bit later in verse 9 it says but the redeemed shall walk there so there's a way within the highway that the redeemed shall walk down amen and we understand that a that any road that is built properly uh is is graded so the water and the trash gets washed off to either side and on either side there's a guttering or there's a ditch and if the ditch becomes deep enough it can become a trench and what happens now is as we go on our Christian walk God allows influences to to come into our lives and if we respond in our Humanity we will end up on either side either ditch and if we keep responding in our Humanity the ditch will be dug deeper and will become a trench and you'll put sandbags there you'll put concrete there and you'll reinforce you know with you are because we understand the scripture tells us that every man is right in uh in his own eyes but the Lord pth the heart so everyone thinks they're on the way you know if we were honest with ourselves and I and I asked everyone in this room you would say I'm in the middle of the road amen they would let's just be honest because every man is right in his own eyes so every man thinks that they are they they are where they should be now this pth it means to to balance to measure out by weight or Dimension to analyze to equalize through idea of leveling so it's actually to you know to equal to meet to ponder to waste it's actually to you know weigh it up you the Lord the Lord weighs up you know which way we may lean because if we like it or not you know there's a human part of us and that human part loves to justify itself and that human part loves to be religious amen so God will God will allow things to come into our lives to keep us to actually either bring us out of a ditch or to keep us in the middle of the way and it's also God allows everything to happen in our lives good and bad ugly and and beautiful whatever you want to put it because God is testing God is proving rather what is in you amen God is proving is it is it is there Dr in there is there is there rust is there things that need to be removed cuz remember we are the clay here is the Potter and the Potter he you know takes up the clay and if there's any impurities he just breaks the vessel on the wheel again and molds it up and continues the process until there's only clay and then once once the once the vessel is molded into into the image that the Potter has in his mind then it's ready for the furnace then it's ready to be really to be tried amen I remember doing you know at school if there's any perfection in any Pottery you did it just blew open in the Kil God isn't that way God's work is perfect but we have to understand that God allows things to happen to see which way you going to lean that's right amen God will cause things that like job God knew s youo Satan God had fellowship with Satan and he said have you considered my servant job you know all the story very well but you got to bring it down into your address because God was telling God was telling Satan this man is perfect he was born like any other man he had he had problems like any other man but God said this man is perfect and the reason brother Braham tells us the reason he believed or God knew he was perfect is because God because job was trusting in God's provided way which was the lamb and that's why job could be justified in his stand is because he stood upon what God had provided which was the shed blood of an innocent one and that's why he could he could stand there and tell his friends I'm not a secret sinner this is not because I've been good or bad but God I don't understand it but God has allowed these things to happen and then he stood upon that word and then finally God in his timing Came Upon the scene and then God explained the whole picture to him what was going on but the reason that job could stand is because he believed in he knew the lamb was God's given way and because he could stand upon the word those other influences didn't move him off the way amen he didn't let other people sh he didn't let his closest friends yeah his closest friends came to him and they sat there and he was astonished and they wait till he opened his eye mouth and spoke and then what was in their heart begin to come out because because everyone around us they see they see people in different situations why is this person going through this and why is this person going through this and in their human reasoning they'll say it's because of this and this and this job's friends did the same thing and God told job pray for your friends or maybe he spoke to them himself I can't remember but he said get job to pray for you to offer a sacrifice because his friends were actually the ones that were in error amen I just want you to think it deep because sometimes you know it's such a fallacy in this day where especially the modern Church they everyone has a word for someone I have a word for you do you are you sure they had a word word for job amen and where did it end them up they're on the they're in a ditch someplace because of their human reasoning I just I just want these things to sink deep we have to be led by God we cannot be led by our emotion we cannot be led by our personality we cannot by led by these five senses or how we feel about it we have to be led by the spirit of God and the word that is the only thing you can you can't trust your senses I I tell you right now if you trust your senses you go off on some ditch some place and then because it feels right or you think it's right you'll begin to fortify your position you know the bigger people dig under the ground and they put concrete and all these different things it's the harder to get the people out amen but trust me if you're in a trench or in a bunker someplace God is not going to leave you in the bunker but it's harder to flush someone out that's in some nuclear bunker that is just someone in a ditch but he knows exactly what's needed to Spring you out of that kind of condition so every road has a ditch on either side now brother Bram says this in in Hebrews chapter 1 because I just want to read this because when I read this I marveled and I have we to understand our Humanity works against us and it's not 99% of the time it's not the devil who's the problem it's you that's the problem it's actually you find you the reason you're in that situation is because of you hey this is I'm preaching to myself you know as well the reason how how did I end up this way me remember the devil is defeated on Calvary he he's a bluff he has no power you hear the prophet in the prayer line time of time Satan you're a bluff you're defeated Jesus defeated you 2,000 years ago and I met an angel to give me this Divine call and he calls Satan's hand and Satan's exposed and defeated amen how many times we said Satan you're a liar you're a bluff and the devil has to recognize I'm a bluff so now Satan has been defeated but now you have to be defeated you have to overcome yourself the greatest enemy the prophet of God said the greatest enemy I have is William brandham he didn't say Satan he didn't say all of hell he said he said William brandham is my greatest enemy if I can just get this man out of the way God can work Hallelujah and if that was for Malachi 4 how much more for the bride of Christ amen so now so so just listen to this this is in Hebrews chapter 1 and then they used to talk about the Highway of Holiness now if you read over that there's in Isaiah 35 now notice there shall be a highway and a way now and is a conjunction see a highway it wasn't a Highway of Holiness it shall be a highway and a way and it shall shall be called the way of Holiness not the Highway of Holiness and the way the road is in the middle of the road it's built like this so that the waters will wash off the trash on both sides keep the road clean if you don't you have puddle standing on your road all the time if it isn't built right the way is the middle of the road now on this side when people get converted their minds are set right on Christ and if they're just a little scholarly so they're built a certain way and don't keep under they'll get real cold and stiff and starchy and indifferent so that's one side and then if they're just a little bit nervous so a little bit emotional a little bit nervous um and if you don't watch you'll just get radical and Wild on this side now are people built a little bit scholly yes are people built a little bit nervous yes it's different personalities so God gives you a certain personality but that can be used against you basically if all you get out of the service is you can't walk this way we believe we're saved by grace but sometimes we forget we walk this walk by grace alone so if you think it's you keeping yourself you'll fall and if you and if you keep things as yourself you'll continue to fall until finally you recognize hey God I can't do this I can't walk this walk without you if we inject our own Humanity at all 1% of us or Point whatever percent of us is too much in this walk amen am Christianity is not about us walking this walk Israel wanted to do something and they failed give us the law they basically said in in the book of Exodus we want to do something and then as soon as the law begin to come out of Moses's mouth they begin to recognize we cannot do this and in their Zeal and and in their good intentions they still failed right amen amen you got you got to bring it on Home friends this is this is just how it is with us our our good intentions many times is Antichrist hallelujah amen our will is Antichrist human will is Antichrist unconverted will is Antichrist even in good intentions now so they go into Sensations and everything but the real Church CH the real same gospel right in the middle of the road it's not cold and starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides calling from both sides that's right now that's what and we're going to and how are we going to get that church right out of the word the year mundam now Paul wanted to get this church right in the middle of the road you see how we how we you know Paul even says in First Corinthians amen he says in 1 Corinthians 11 and let's just let's just go to this because the failure people fail when they look through natural eyes yes people fail when they look through and it doesn't matter you know how long they've been Christians or you know brother bham standing in the Gap he preaches a sermon standing in the Gap and he and he and he's just had a great experience where he's lost his love for the people because Christ he was being rejected every door was closing he says you know when he's preaching the seals he says heaps of my friends I know thousands or whatever he said are going to leave me because of this and it's Christ unveiling himself and we understand that the scripture had to be fulfilled behold I stand at the door and knock because that's for the church World Jesus was kicked out of the church world and that was lived out in brother braham's Ministry and if he looked at it through spiritual eyes he would have understood this a scripture being fulfilled but we don't like to be rejected you know people don't like to be rejected they don't like to be put in a box you see and so he begin to lose his love for the people says I'm just going to go up to Northern British Colombia or Canada wherever I'm just going to be a hunter cuz I always wanted to be a hunter and I'll take my family up there and you know we'll just go up there and when the Lord says go preach this or go speak to this person I'll stomp out of the Wilderness and say thus sayith the Lord and then go back yes you go go listen to the service and so what happens now is is is because he was being rejected and he was looking it through human eyes now all this was examples for us this why this happened to the prophets we could look at how someone filled with the Holy Ghost in their position he was an adopted son of God in his position but yet he he he began to pull away under his Humanity he was pulling a certain way because of how the people were responding and because he was looking through natural eyes amen he wasn't looking but the Lord because of see the Lord because brother BR he was driving past a place and there was all these bums on the side warming themselves and there were some bums came into a restaurant and one looked like him and one looked like his cousin Fletcher or whoever it was and God said if you continue down this way that you want to go you'll end up like that and your wife will leave you you lose everything will he still be saved yes but his Humanity was driving him a certain way which was not the way God wanted him to go so God in his grace turned him back around so now these things these happen these things happen to you amen that's right where things come into your life but then how are you going to respond to it are you going to respond in a natural way and you can reason it out and justify your actions or are you going to surrender it to God and yield yourself to God that you can keep in the middle of the way now 1 Corinthians 11 now let's go to let's just go to verse 29 I just want to read a couple of verses here or verse 28 but let a man examine himself this is Paul speaking of the of the uh uh communion so let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep now this Discerning the Lord's body he's not speaking about the unleavened bread and the and the wine being the Lord's body he's speaking about the body of Christ he's saying because they do you have not discerned the Lord's body many are seek uh sick and weak and many sleep so what happened with the Corinthian Church is they they became carnal in their walk and you can see that in in you know in the first chapter where Paul said you know you say I'm of Paul I'm of I'm of you know sephus and I'm of you know Apollos and all these different ones you know these different Ministries and what it happened is the people begin to look through natural eyes and they were looking at Ministries and they were comparing Ministry with Ministry and how people are built if they're scholarly what will they enjoy more more teaching if they're a bit more nervous and a bit more you know emotional they'll enjoy a bit more evangelism so in so in their carnal mind they begin to make camps in the church because because they like other Ministries over other Ministries instead of looking through God's eyes and say these are different gifts in the body and they complement one another to build us in the fullness of the Statue of Christ but they were looking through their carnal mind and and what happened they were still in church they were still worshiping the god you your know God they still walking in the message of the hour because they were obeying the message of the hour they believe the messenger and all these different things but they were carnal in their walk you understand so they were look looking through natural eyes and not spiritual eyes and so this is happening he says the reason many are sick and S your sleep actually means dead there because you're not Discerning the Lord's body you're not Discerning that your brother and sister is the Tabernacle of the Living God because in our in our natural Humanity we'll look at each other and say this person's like this and this person's like this and or this person's personality just jars with me that's right Hallelujah right why is this person this way God made them that way because iron sharpens iron you understand sometime now God allows people to come in am same fil you they they're all the bride totally different personalities different approach different way of doing things and God causes two opposing personalities to come together to bring them both into the middle you got to look at the big picture this walk everything it doesn't matter if it's in here or on the street in your job in the school God brings people your way Amen to mold you a certain way it's actually for your benefit oh I just I just can't see out either with this person that's for your benefit but you got to you got to say well how do I how do I respond because if you respond naturally you're not going to get the benefit and because remember if I pull a certain way like tiger wall if I pull a certain way and you I don't agree with it you'll pull the other way and you'll find yourself not in the middle of it you'll find yourself on the other side you'll find yourself in you know in the other ditch and that happens when we do not look spiritually at things if we look carnally at things you'll you you'll pull in the opposite direction yes sir that's right our humanity is such an enemy you see so they weren't Discerning they weren't because what happens I think brother Marcus said this to me I can't remember yeah he did in Fellowship he said if we put someone in a box they are of no use to us they can't benefit us in any way that's right because you because you've labeled them you say over here this is what you are I've I've indexed you a certain way and that's it good but God allowed that person to come into your life to benefit you you see so if we put them in a box you know some people some people are built more legal that's right some people are built more liberal that's right but every man thinks he's right in his own eyes yeah everyone thinks they are not liberal or legal there but they're right down the middle but God will allow God will allow legalists and liberal liberals to be in the same church that's right to bring both of them into the middle Amen to bring both in the middle but remember if you put them in a box you want you just go this way more because that person's wrong amen you'll put them in a box and you'll just because you know we love to hold our defend our point of view I'm a defender of the faith I'm an example of the message right that's right you building a bunk of friends basically it doesn't mean just be tossed to and fro by everything but you should know in whom you have belief but you can't just index people say this is this and because if you put someone in a box you lose your love for them and then you think the reason the love is going is because of them it's because of you amen you got to think about it now amen so we don't want to you know God Cain asked God am I My Brother's Keeper and he was his brother's keeper right let's go to Hebrews chapter 3 we are our Brother's Keeper but then how do you how do you uh how do you apply that how do you apply that now Hebrews chapter 3 and let's just read I just want to read from verse 7 down to verse 13 or 14 cuz Paul now Paul is speaking to the Hebrews here he says wherefore is the Holy Ghost saith now here's some homework read Hebrews 3 and 4 wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice hard did not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation said they do always ER in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed Brethren least there be any uh be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God but exalt one another daily while it is called today least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for We Are Made part partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end so Paul Paul is Paul is admonishing them saying to exalt exalt one another now this word exalt has many different meanings in the Greek it says to call near to invite uh uh uh to invoke by imploration exaltation consolation to beseech to comfort to to give exaltation to entreat and to pray yes amen so it has many different you know has many different meanings so to you know to to exalt one another daily is not always to beat people over the head say brother BR said this that's right you need wisdom we need wisdom we need we need so much wisdom in this day now because if one of us ends up in the ditch the whole body of Christ you know goes a bit sideways that's right amen if one of us is you know one way if one of us is sick we all suffer spiritually and physically amen so to exalt you know it means even to you know to pray to comfort and even even where brotherr says that love is corrective and it is corrective but how I've been thinking about this how is that correction applied is it always a stick in saying do this and you shouldn't do this and this is wrong and this is right and you know sometimes it is but it love doesn't always correct that way amen amen cuz at the end of the day if you see if someone is lacking in an area or you say they're too liberal or they're too legal whatever box you want to put them in they have to want what you have amen they have to want what you have you can't you know if if people and that's and this is this has been the problem especially in this country you go back 30 years brotherly kindness has been destroyed and people who are dogmatically right people look at them and they say I don't want that that's right but doctrinally they may be correct and doctrinally they might see a further part of the word than these other people but because how it's applied and what it produces cuz people just see you know you look at a car you can say how great the car is and what you know but if it looks like a big rust bucket that needs that basically needs to be thrown into scrap I'd say I don't want to buy that car amen and and and you take the same thing into the message where people live a certain life and people look at that and say I don't actually want that I don't want my family to be produced in that kind of way now remember the family is Sovereign in itself husbands we're all built differently amen but if you see a real love and harmony sure there's ups and downs and bumps and all these kind of problems whatever more but if you see a real Harmony in a family amen then people will say I want that I want that and what does that do remember because the true way is down the middle calling from both sides that's right amen you know sometimes we don't sometimes it's actually wrong to be proven right that's right Amen to win an argument if you lose the brother or sister but win the argument you've lost right amen you've you've totally lost you've totally that's not Christ like just to say I'm right this is right you're wrong cuz you've lost the brother and then it's harder to win that brother the scripture says than to win a win a win a castle win a fortress amen so you got to look at things see that's so carnal to come down and say this is how it is and that might be 100% true but you got to use wisdom you say there's more it's more than just winning an argument you got to think of your brother's Soul your sister's Soul because you can you can treat someone a certain way and they can go through Years cuz they've pulled the other way you see and yeah I've seen it around people have have have fallouts 20 years ago 30 years ago they go around the mry bush a couple of times around the mountain and they're having the same Fallout with the same people and neither of them have grown at all amen right that's right I've seen it I've seen it and why because the first time they were carnal in what they did and they haven't learned from what they did and they're still carnal but yet quoting the prophet yet quoting the scripture yet right in their own eyes well this person did this to me and this person did that to me what did Jesus do for you amen cuz ultimately you cannot let and the devil will play on it so much this person's like this so I can't worship like this this person's like this so I can't sing how I want to sing this person's like this so I can't pray how I want to pray that's right and what happens is is that person actually becomes God to you because that person begins to dictate to you how you can worship God and how you can walk with God that's right but they did this to me they may have done those things but it was done for a reason that you would lean upon God and not lean upon your own self Israel you read Hebrews there you go into Exodus allowed them to be delivered gloriously and go in the desert 3 days and drink bit of water and go through those great big hardships because God wanted them to completely depend upon him that when they came to the promised land because that was their schooling was the Wilderness amen they were going through their schooling and God wanted them to be that way and and suffer those things that when the real test came which was possessing their land it wasn't going through the the law came that the law would God would be worshiped by that law in The Inheritance it wasn't for the wilderness user in the promised land so that whole journey was just them being schooled am and so they could but the problem is they were still slaves you know they were taken out of Egypt but Egypt wasn't taken out of them you look at Moses you know when when Jacob Joseph brought Jacob down into Egypt you know uh Joseph told Jacob do not tell Pharaoh your Shepherds cuz this is an Abomination to the Egyptians and look at Moses Moses is is in in Pharaoh's house he's next on the throne and then God because God's going to take Egypt out of Moses what happens a few days from then he's doing what's an Abomination to the people that he had ruled over and he had these sheep he was actually doing something there was an Abomination amen and God allowed that and those 40 years in the desert because God had to take Egypt out of Moses amen that when Moses came to a season where now you're going to deliver my my people he was ready amen and so God has to take all dependency of this guy am he he he causes things in life to take full dependency out of this guy amen so I can fully depend upon him and that's God's way of schooling his children it's not by education and learning you know and just say this is how this is the form that we do things but it's being surrendered to God that when when you feel like you're going through the grinder is because God's saying look to me and sometimes you may have to bear things and have to carry burdens and and and afflictions sure sometimes but he's proving he's saying can you bear it do you have the patience and the perseverance to Bear what you've been what's been put upon your shoulder cuz God is proving his salvation in you God is proving to the devil that the cross was enough that the blood was enough that I'm redeeming my children I've taken the book I mean I'm gathering what belongs to me to myself and they're becoming more like me that's right so he allows things to happen because God saying Satan look here's my bride she won't fall like Eve did she won't fall like the first church did she's predestinated not to fall Hallelujah and then so it's proven Satan says okay just give me a go and nine times out of 10 it's everyday things things come into life it's a little bit pressure comes on Amen you know a man it doesn't matter man woman child they are what they are under pressure that's right they are not what they are when everything's fine and so God was proving what was in Israel in that Wilderness Journey he was proving what was really in their hearts because they could rejoice when their enemies were destroyed and they had that good old Pentecostal meeting there on the other side of the Red Sea and Miriam playing the Tambour they're all dancing they could all Rejoice but that didn't prove what was in them yes it was a Wilderness Journey which proved what was in them amen so God is wanting to prove really what's in you Hallelujah and the Beautiful Thing is whenever something when failure comes up when something comes to mind I may have a massive blind spot that I have no idea about but then when God allows that to be exposed and I fall then I can actually say God now you can deal with it am because God is a gentleman he doesn't Force you through a pipe and make you overcome amen he doesn't Force you through a pipe and make you you know be be delivered of things but God allows it things to happen that imperfections in me can come out amen and you say Lord take this and then when he really does take it the same situation will come up and you'll just cruise over that's right amen amen hey God is looking for Perfection that's right God is looking for a Perfection yes and we know the blood of Jesus Christ one by one offering we're perfect he perfected them that are Sanctified so he gave a perfect offering to make a perfect people if it was imperfect offering it could never make the people perfect that's right amen but then he takes that power you know he takes that transforming power of His Holy Ghost and then he molds and shapes you into a mature cuz perfectionist not only sinless Perfection but it's also a maturity a completeness a fully grown person this be no you know don't be babies anymore where you need milk you should have been we from the milk and Taken full meat by now cuz there's a spiritual growth that must take place and so God is now you know this is how God this is how God operates now I was going to read this the thing is though God God is always God uses man every time so if we are one way or another God will allow people to be among us to bring us into the middle and not only to bring us into the middle but they mean they may need to come into the middle and you take this is in the patmas vision and this is speaking this is speaking of of of John Wesley now in John Wesley's day the church Church John Wesley did not believe in predestination here's the here's the messenger to the age he didn't believe in predestination George Woodfield and these ones they they pre he was a contemporary he preached predestination you think why would why would a man who's a church age messenger believe less of the word than others God built them this way that's right cuz he says it was certainly so now but by election God chose His Bride by election before the foundation of the world put their names on the L Book of Life sland uh before the foundation of the world before the ever the world ever began God in his mind being infinite and we use the word sometimes as predestination but it is a sure hanger in this church age that we live in it was certainly a great thing used in the days of the martyrs cuz they certainly believed it but it got away from it now to the legalist ideas the legalist teaching the church which come brother says which was a good thing because all of it had gone calvinistic in England till they didn't even uh they didn't even have revivals anymore and John Wesley come along preaching the Armenian Doctrine which balanced it up God will always balance it up that's right so so the church well they said well everyone's predestinated we don't need to go preach we don't need to go have revivals CU everyone who's going to be there is going to be there and and the whole church went to seed on that idea that's right right so God built John wisley a certain way to preach you know but their their method of sanctification was a SE self- sanctification and it was works but God built them that way to swing the church into the middle yes amen so God you say would God absolutely he did that that's right and if that was the same if that was that way in the Philadelphian age how much more now in the bride age when God doesn't want his bride leaning one way or another on the humanity and their feelings and I feel this this way but God to me the message is balanced that's right amen the message is is perfectly balanced and so God built his you say well that was Elijah speaking in the later part of his ministry he said I must decrease he must increase so it wasn't just Elijah speaking it was God himself speaking he says in the seventh seal message he says well maybe I'm just building a platform for that great one to come and people take that quote and they say I'm I'm the man but they're all wrong cuz he speaking of Christ himself stepping upon the scene which he had said now I must increase he must increase the word must increase God you see so you know so God will allow people to come to balance us in a certain way especially now that we have because we have the mind of Christ in this age they have the mind of Christ so if we really have the mind of Christ you can't have two minds the bride is not schizophrenic amen you can't have two minds operating you can't have two Wills operating there's only one will you know I don't know if they're them online yet but if you haven't you know with the convention there was up in ker K Brother Joseph leanza preached a wonderful services on the will yeah and now so our will can't operate and God's will can operate at the same time that's right and the Lord's PR says Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done that was the first thing that was prayed thy will be done if it is our will being done we'll lean certain ways and we'll justify ourselves but we're leaning AER if you lean if you lean too far for too long you end up in a ditch amen so it's not our will our will is Antichrist against God and Romans 1 says there's not one that seeks after God not one because they all want their own will to do their whatever they want to do that's why we have to cast down reasoning and imaginations that exalt us out of the word of God Amen so we have to be willing that we lay our will down see brother brandham you say about pre you're standing in the Gap his will he said I never wanted to do this I wanted to be a Trapper his whole life he wanted to be a Trapper so when he lost the feeling for the people his will began to come up again he says I want to go hunting again cuz he wanted to be a Old Testament prophet in the wilderness cuz he loved hunting he loved the Wilderness that was his will coming up again amen so we our will canot operate and God's will that's right you it it just it just doesn't work but I'm justified in in what I believe I justified in my position your will cannot operate in God's will your thinking cannot operate with God's thinking now Jesus says this in Matthew chapter 7 forth what judgment ye judged you shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again why beholdest thou the moat which is in thy brother's eye remember I'll just read it but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wil thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye you see it's such an important thing when we pray when we pray it shouldn't be we're not we shouldn't be trying to change God's mind when we pray we say Lord change my thinking change my mind amen amen because of someone you know we all think we're right yes I think I I'll be I think I'm right I think I'm down the middle amen that's just I'll just be you know if I'm the only honest one here that's fine but but that's how I feel I believe I'm right cuz every man thinks he's right in his own eyes you see so it takes God unless God if unless you pray that's why thy will be done thy kingdom come thy will be done and so we must pray in a way because if just say if I have a problem with someone it shouldn't be now now I get my ammo and I justify myself and or that person's wrong cuz remember the Judgment that you give that same judgment will be given to you it should never be that it should be Lord examine me remember there's a forest in my examine me take out my imperfections that when I Can See Clearly that's why he said this when you can see clearly then you can help your brother amen then you can help your sister that's right but if you're going you know there's this thing you know it's in Psychology but brother speaks about it's called imprinting where things there's there's key events in our life that are that that are just imprinted into us that's right just just complet it's molded our our entire character and God allows those things for certain purposes now if something is if something is taken carnally in the Christian work it'll imprint upon me and then I will look through those glasses that's right amen and all of my decisions and everything every way I see things will be based upon that thing yes amen amen it's called a clouded spirit and you know in another term where it becomes the filter that we look through that's right and I can and people you know unless God shows that to the individual they will say I'm looking through perfect glasses what do you mean I'm looking through the word brother look it says this here amen so we have to be very careful amen where if something comes out if there's a disagreement or something you know the last thing how can love leave a leave a body it's how the members treat each other and how they respond to others in the church that's how love leaves oh that this person's here that person's here yes that's right oh and then and then they put in a box are you God I'm saying things pretty flat today but I think I think this is this is just how it's coming out so you know are you got is this is this how they're going to end up is that you know because the problem is we take a photo of people we put it in our mind and every time we see them it could be years the photo comes out this is how they are are they still that way oh this person did they did that to me years ago have you forgiven them but they did a catastrophic thing to my life it's totally ruined me has it it may be terrible but have you forgiven them perfect faith is based upon forgiveness you read about the scripture perfect faith I want perfect Faith it's based upon forgiveness if you cannot forgive then you cannot have perfect Faith so it actually comes down to you you can even go to them say look when you did this and this I forgive you they might never ever apologize yes that actually doesn't matter that's right it's if you can forgive them leave it at the feet of Jesus Christ and move on that is the challenge remember things things happen happen and God is saying how are you going to deal with this but I'm justified in my position you may be hey Jesus he came to his own his own received him not he could have called Legions of angels he could have just leveled Jerusalem just like this hey cursed the Fig Tree he said J just he could call he he could have just called fire from heaven you know his you know his disciples say should we call fire from heaven he says you don't know the anointing that's on you because I saw Elijah do these things you know the story y that's right and so Jesus could have been fully Justified just to cause the you know all those religious demons there he could have just caused those people just to vanish to nothing he could have done it that's right and he would have been Justified the very God that they were claiming to serve had was standing among them and they totally rejected him and it's Humanity CU remember he was a human in his Humanity he could have done that and he would have been perfectly Justified that's right but when he was on the cross he said Lord forgive them they don't know what they're doing amen can we can we and you and you mean you look at that scene and say of course they know what they're doing they've rejected you and they you know this man will not have rule over us he will not be our King you know she could say they actually know what they're doing he call himself God he was God he is God and he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and no one's ever been crucified has anyone ever been scorched and rejected and basically uh face public execution Jesus suffered all those things he said father forgive me I mean father forgive them sorry they don't know what they're doing right and we want to be like Jesus amen am now we must be able to look we must be able to look beyond the situation and you must be able to look it through through through spiritual lives and everything everything in life you have to look beyond your five senses your five senses lie to you every day your emotions lie to you every day but if you can take it back into the word and you can identify the bigger picture remember this whole life is a character building process yes doesn't matter before you met the Lord you always were the Lords just came a season where you recognized him and gave your life so everything in life the parents you have the background the country you were born in you know the influences at school or wherever you went that was God molding and shaping you for a certain work to be molded in a certain way but if we look it because there's a fine thing there's a fine line now there's such a fine line between identifying a scar and being healed and identifying a scar and nursing it so people people can identify because some things are ter are terrible things that happen in life I'm not I'm not sugar coding anything there's great I know even sitting there's great pain of of the past painful things that have happened but there's a fine line between identifying it and it being healed and identifying it and actually nursing it amen because in hospital someone goes into Hospital you say what a massive wound on that person but then there comes a process of time where you say look at what they're doing to the person you see the healing process you know take shape so if the person just looks at the wound of what happened you know they're missing what what the doctors are doing to them you see so and the devil can use our own personal it because he always uses you were wronged there Jesus was wronged all the time Believers have always been wrong but God allows that to see what are you going to do are you going to nurse that thing it wasn't you know I didn't ask for this no one asked for life you know what happens in life no one asked for it you know no one no one said yeah I I wanted that trial I wanted that pain I wanted that suffering who loves trials I've never heard a Christian say I need another trial I want a bad one this time I want a real bad one I've never I've never heard anyone say that and and we can we can come through a trial but if but if you keep it you know if it's still if it's still the devil will will will will anoint your memory and take you back to that place and open that wound and make it as Roar and as painful as it when it first happened and he'll even magnify it many times amen and and that is actually identifying a scar and nursing it because a scar a wounding can take you into a ditch as well amen but if you keep your eyes upon the Lord that's why such power and just giving it to really giving it to him and every time the devil brings you away you say Lord you say that's done it's under the blood amen now we can't let so I just want to read this now this is in raising gas's daughter in 56 he was a God man he was divine he was virgin born god Jehovah god um overshadowed a little virgin and brought forth for the Virgin bornn Son of God and that was a tabernacle or the living place of Jehovah himself Jehovah walked in a tabernacle of Flesh and paid the price for sin don't you ever let him be a prophet he was the god of the prophets sure was he was more than a good man he was the god of the Good Men now out here in this little old sea tossed about says when he's on the boat remember sleeping 10,000 Devils of the sea swore that drown him while he was laying back there tired you know the devil takes advantage of you when you get tired or warn out he does you the same way you just get a little tired and worn out and get discouraged certainly he caught Jesus right at that weak spot tired and weary yes so the devil you know he even says in one place he and Christ revealed his own word so so the devil looks for weak spots when you're weak and he says now so so this is the beginning of Christ is revealed in his own word it's like there opening comments now where I come to the conclusion to talk on was this because knowing that we say we mustn't just just say because we're gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people for we are going to pass through dangerous treacherous Waters where already sailing through them and sometimes I guess it's much uh with you like it is with me it seems like that so much of it it's such a scary I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room a few moments ago and both them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of human beings on Earth I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you I don't care who you are uh he's got a right to that one punch which would had you rather be that punch be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he could punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you've got to keep covered all the time and he says and to see this nervous age that we're living in he changes his course so there is a there's a there's an open place in all of us the devil has a right for that one punch that's right you got to keep it covered all the time how do you keep that covered don't walk in your Humanity whatever you do because if you walk in that Humanity the devil can use your own Humanity against you and swing you one way or another yep now you say well how does so both both legalists and liberalists say they love the Lord Jesus but how someone Acts shows actually what they are I'm just going to read so this is a marriage and divorce he says see you find yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is right now that's hard to say that but it's the truth we find ourselves on two different roads one going this one going one way one going the other now let's see what truth is now listen and see if this sounds sensible to you for instance if I get ready to go overseas now I'll take my own family I'll call my wife up to me and I'll say we're going uh well I'm going overseas dear now here is the legalist side now my wife I'm going to lay the Lord down on you if you flirt with any man while I'm gone when I come back you're a divorced woman and I don't want you making eyes I don't want you flirting you understand that I'm your husband if you do it I'm going to put you away when I come back then she reaches and gets me by the tie and say my good man I want to tell you something see that if you make eyes at any woman or take any woman out or flirt with any woman you're going to be divorced man when you come back why wouldn't that be a happy home that's the legalist all right now the other side the other side is now that if I go overseas and I make a mistake and go over and say well now look I'll take this woman out oh it's all right with my wife she don't care my wife say I'll go out with this man it's all right with Bill he don't care if I don't care then there's something wrong with me I don't love that woman right and if I and if she don't care there's something wrong with her she's my life uh wife I don't want another man fooling with her she's my wife that's the correct way of it there's both of them's got a truth but not the exact truth now when I go overseas to make it right my little family gathers around and we pray with one another and I commit them to God and they commit me to God and when we um when we go overseas I go overseas now I know she loves me I have confidence in her and I love her and she's got confidence in me as long as I love her like that she don't have any worry about me taking any other woman out as long as she loves me right why there's no need of me thinking about any man's going to go out with her because she's my wife and I believe her and I believe if I would actually do something wrong make a mistake and go out with some woman and return back and would confess it to her and tell her meter I didn't mean to do that I just got caught in a trap this woman just run right out to me and grabbed me by the arm and and started so and so I believe she'd be understanding I believe she would forgive me for it but I wouldn't want to do it for nothing because I love her though she would for forgive me I I wouldn't do it I wouldn't hurt her for nothing though I know she'd forgive me for it I don't want to hurt her and that's the way it is with Goden if I with ailo love which is human love Fellowship love can make a man feel that about his wife What about agapo love the Greek meaning the love of God what would that make me do about Jesus Christ as long as I want to do it and it's in my heart to do it well as long as in my heart to do it I go do it legalism won't let me do it but because that I know I get punished for doing it but the real truth of it is is when the love of God comes into your heart till you want to do it that's the truth of it there's two schools not legalism or Calvinism it's both legalism and see that's what he said so he said if you really love the Lord you will you know he said the liberal he said the liberal rul they say it's like we just don't care and the legalist say well you better not do it cuz you'll get punished but if you really love him if you have a real Godly love for him then you won't want to do it why what's your because what you know what's the motive behind it you won't do it because you love him not because you're scared you'll be punished for it but because you love you're in a love relationship you and God and you also wouldn't want to do it cuz you wouldn't want to hurt him cuz he knows because he know knows that he cares for you and you care for him so why would you want anything to come into the relationship which would Mar the relationship amen it's divine love only true divine love can keep a Believer down the middle of the road it's not how much they understand how much they know or any any human human element it's the love of God and it's only the the real love see one way to lose the love of God is to operate in a carnal realm that's right amen if you operate in a carnal realm you'll lose your love for your brother and your sister that's right you'll lose your love for God that's right it's guaranteed because you're not walking in the spirit anymore but you're walking after the flesh amen so now as I just wind this up you know we want to it says it says and Above All Above All Things Have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins love love shall cover the multitude of sins and that's how you know the devil the devil if he can if the body isn't United and there's gaps in you there's there's separation in the body then the devil can get into those gaps and he can divide the Sheep even more yes amen and then how does he do that oh that brother said this to me or this sister said this or this happened to this and then and then it just snowballs yeah and that's how that's how the devil can get in and then you can and then you can justify yourself and say well you know the reason the devil came in is because he shot that person with something and now he's trying to poison the whole group amen but it's not always that way it's it's how you react to when things come your way it'll either allow the devil in more or it'll push the devil away that's right amen it's how you react not not what the other person you know Christianity I just came to the conclusion the Lord Christianity is all about me this world has been created for me amen everyone in my life is actually for me that's very selfish but if you think think about it God built this Earth that you could be here and God made this world the way it should be to mold you in a certain way amen and he brings the word your way to mold you in a certain way so it's all about you that's right a it's actually not about the other person it's actually about you we see we see David when he's rejected epsilon's you know there's a coup epsilon's come in he's fleeing for his life you know and there's that crippled up guy shimi whatever his name is of the House of Saul that's right daddy said Remember the House of David House of Saul after Saul Jonathan died there was Civil War then finally David came upon the throne the house of Saul was put down and then so here's a crippled up guy from the house of Saul and he's and he's cursing David and throwing stones at him and all these things and one of his body guards draws his sword says am I going to let the head of that dog you know leave his head on things he curses my king and David says God told him to do it that's right God told him to do it and I bet you if if you know if we went back into that time and you asked him shimi did you see an angel did he say curse David now he prob said no I just I just hate the guy amen but David could see the bigger picture because even even in that great time of distress God was testing David God was testing him to see are you cuz he could said yeah take his head off that guy's head would have been taken off and it would have been wrong you see but David cuz he wasn't looking through just a car away he was looking he was looking through spiritual eyes he could say no leave him alone God told him to do that that's right amen and David David had his falling his failings and all these things but David you know David was the perfect king that's right amen that's right I'll call you know you know Christ will be the son of David he's a man after my own heart he's a perfect King and so he was in the middle of the road I'll put it that way way cuz Christ was displaying himself in his life and then so in everything you could say God allowed that God calls why did David how come David did so well you know he could have killed Saul twice he could have done all these things but he knew God told him to do it amen he could be he could behave himself wisely that made Saul fear Him all the more it says because he knew God told him to do it amen what do mean the brothers trying to kill me amen trying to get the whole nation against me organize churches to come against me amen now I'm in the wilderness with these Gentiles that have that actually have no part of the promise but they believed he was coming into Power Hallelujah GL God allowed all that cuz God was proving because a king a king isn't just a king when everything's all Rosy and peachy and everything's nice a king is a king under pressure someone in someone in command it really proves what they're made of under pressure when the chips are down which way are we going to go and so God was proving this is what a king this is what a man in leadership is really like amen when the pressure and I our sister as well we should all be able to see ourselves in David you say well you're spiritualizing things too much David spiritualized it and God put it in his word amen maybe God told them to do it how you because if you can see it that way then you won't carnally respond I don't believe because you can see the bigger picture amen God's wanting to mold us now I just want to read this he says now this is in the era of God's Deliverance in 56 today is a compromising time that's true you paint your steps red and watch to see if your neighbor don't paint his steps red sure you wear a little round hat to church with a little feather up in it and watch all the woman come to church with that little round hat and feather in it that's right yes sir all of them want to look like one another it's a matching time now in a counter way some people think everyone should be like me amen why isn't that brother like me why isn't that sister like you know why isn't their family like our cuz we're believers they should be like me AR necessarily did god build them the same way as you no is their family the same as you God is a god of vary that's why the house is Sovereign amen that's why the family is Sovereign in itself God is not a cookie cutter no runs SP SE at our place you but God is not a cookie cutter amen and God allows us now I just finish this listen he says that's right all of them want to look like one another it's a matching time you know that's true it's a matching time amen he says he says that must have gone home that's right now listen this is true now I'm going to tell you my brother I don't care whether my shoes match my trousers or my my trousers match my coat I want my experience to match God's Bible That's the matching time if you want to match something match experience against Paul's amen that's what we need today it's a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible that's our example right real matching time don't try to match your neighbor match some Saint uh match some of the Saints in the Bible if you're a saint act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint dress like a saint be a saint live a saint die like a saint go to heaven like a saint amen amen where this is the mirror amen match if you want to help your brother or sister match the mirror amen say Lord take my cleanse me of my secret faults David prayed amen that's what we should be praying that God can that God can take us in such a way cuz the devil will try and pull you into a ditch amen he'll try and overthrow you any way you can he'll do it as long as you go off the way that's all he needs you to do that's all he's wanting to do amen and God's as I said God is proving your salvation God is proving you he said he says in Deuteronomy 8 those 40 years in the you know these 40 years in the desert and you you in the wilderness was to prove you and to Humble you Moses was telling Israel to prove what's in you and so I trust when we look when we look at everything that happens do you look at things carnally or do you look at things spiritually through a spiritual eye because if you look at things through a spiritual eye the whole church can turn against you but yet you still won't lose your love for them or for the Lord amen and sometimes God will allow that to happen to test you on it amen this person's at fault are they this person did wrong they may have and they may be at fault but it was happening now to test what's in you amen amen we don't want to be carnal and pull different ways and I don't want to I don't like concrete I don't want to build a bunker amen but my feelings I feel this is right the feel you this is Paramount if you can't take what you're doing into here you forget about what you're doing doing you should just throw it away because if you're led by your feelings you will end up in a ditch that sures the world Amen Hallelujah maybe let's just bow our heads in word of prayer shall we oh Lord Jesus father I just pray you will just take these chopped up words Lord father as we look at everything in life may we not respond in a carnal way may we not respond through how we feel father we don't want to end
