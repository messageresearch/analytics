praise the Lord God bless you friends amen thank you thank you musicians amen God bless you amen oh praise the lord it's good to see one out tonight um if you'd like to turn with me to uh Genesis chapter 8 okay Genesis chapter 8 and I want to read from verse six and it came to pass at the end of 40 days that Noah opened the window of the Ark which he had made he sent forth a raven which went to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the Earth also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters wereit from off the face of the Earth but the dove found no rest for the soul of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pull her in unto him into the ark and he stayed yet another seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the Ark and the Dove came into him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so Noah knew the waters were abated from off the Earth and he stayed yet another seven days and sent forth the dove which return not again into him anymore and I just want to read let's go to Matthew chapter 3 the end of Matthew chapter 3 and verse 13 then I want to go A Song of Solomon again then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I need I have need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me and Jesus answered and said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill La righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight away out of the water and low the heavens opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lightning upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased amen we just go to Song of Solomon Chapter 2 again and we'll and we'll read from verse 13 down to verse 14 sorry verse 12 down to verse 14 in Song of Solomon 2 the flowers appear on the earth the time of singing birds has come the voice of the turtle we know that word is the turtle dove is heard in our land the Fig Tree pth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs of The Rock and the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated I want to I want to take a I want to read some from Brother brandham Where he related um he he's related going past the curtain of time there in rejected King you know when he was there and he's lying on his bed early in the morning and he wondered what it's like to go into the next world are you just a vapor what's it like and then a voice said to him would you like to see beyond the curtain of time he said it just help me so good and then he was taken instantly ly before he even was aware of it he was out of his body and he was looking down at his body and he was young again he had a full head of hair his green grassy Fields all these sisters in white came to him our precious brother then there's all these other you know men came robed in white again and said our precious brother you know if you had not come we would not be here and you know because he preached the gospel and one was pointed out said you you remember her and and he says no and and he says she was 90 years old when you led her to the Lord and if you didn't go she wouldn't be here and then he said oh where's Jesus I want to see Jesus and then he says uh you know that same voice said to him he's a little bit higher uh you'll go and then they said you'll go and present us to him and then and then um but first you'll be judged for your ministry and then he says well will Paul be judged and and then he said yes and he and and he rejoiced because he preached the same thing Paul preached he says if Paul and his group's accepted my me and my group will be accepted and the people there in Paradise will scream back to him we know we're resting on that Hallelujah and so he said he said after that he said I could never be the same William brandom as I was before and as as he was going back into his body they kept telling him keep keep pressing the battle and he said he words could not describe how great that world is well your words words could not describe how he said it's beyond perfect it's beyond Sublime it's you know it's just it's just words could not describe how great the region of the regions of the Blessed Are and he said whatever you do don't miss that place you need perfect love to get there and if you have the Holy Ghost you have perfect love and then he sings at the end of that way he prays he says know he he sings this song I'm so homesick and blue I want to see Jesus I'd like to hear those sweet Harbor bells chime it would brighten my path it would vanish all fear and he says Lord let us look past the curtain of Time Lord let me look past the curtain of Sorrows and fear let me view that Sunny bright climb it would strengthen our faith and it would vanish all fear he says Lord let them look aast the curtain of time and I was thinking as I just thought about this Noah and this is maybe I just trust a Lord will put this out right but we could just know when he when he said let them look past the c a time I believe he was talking about us because this isn't a prayer he says let's just he said he said let us bow our heads just a moment and he and he and he and he and he recounts the song in prayer he says let them look past the curtain of time if we could just if it would just anchor into our SS just a little bit the place we're going to where Jesus says I trust this mean something to you where Jesus says I go to prepare a place for you and if I do I'll come again and I'll receive you unto myself that where you are you'll be he doesn't say where you are he says where I no say where I am there you'll be in John 14 I go to prepare a place and then Paul in in in second Corinthians chapter 12 he didn't speak of himself but it was himself he says I knew a man I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago speaking about his own self wherefore in body I cannot tell or whether they out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such a one caught up into the third heaven so remember there's Heavens there's the atmospheres then there's the second heaven which is the Stars the universe but the third heaven is the heaven that we're going to that is the third heaven so say caught up to the thir third heaven and I knew such a man whether in body or out of body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such a one will I Glory yet of myself I'll not Glory but of my infirmities for though I desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear least any man think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that heareth of me and least I be exalted above measure through the abundance of the Revelation that was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan Buffet me I mean sorry it was given to me a thorn on the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me Le I should be exalted above measure now Paul was speaking about himself when he says I knew a man he was talking about himself he was taken up into that realm amen and to us to us we have heaven we have a taste of Heaven down here amen we come into the presence of the Lord we come in contact with eternity yet where these time beings you know we we we don't understand all things we don't see all things but yet we see Jesus amen there's a faith that God puts in us that we that we we we we know that that that we're not from this world but we're in this world and we know that God has called us through his word and yet we have struggles we have hardship we have stress and pression and and depression and hardship but yet there's something in us that we long not to be here anymore we have a longing that one day we could just look Pastor curtain a time to know that our Fair's been paid how do you get there Jesus Paid It All Jesus Paid your ticket to get there and then brother Ram says You must have the token which is the life of Jesus the Holy Ghost in you and if you have that then you have what you need to get there you have the ticket in your hand to get on the Gospel Ship to go to the other land Hallelujah you already have what you need to get there and if you have it it's as if as if you're there because you have what you need to get there Hallelujah but if we could just look past a curtain of time now Noah Noah you we sing the song we'll probably sing at the end Noah drifted on the flood many days but he was looking you know he had been through a great disaster it would have been a terrible thing to be it would have been glorious to be in the ark but to hear the sound of outside and to feel it Lift Off the Earth and hear the screams and see that you know just in your mind try and fathom the destruction and no doubt he would have seen a bit of it because the scripture says he was moved with fear he prepared an ark to save the save's family so there would have been a great grip come upon him I've got got to build this Ark God's made a way of Escape but it must be built and he's given me I found Grace in his sight I don't know why but it says says in their Genesis but he found Grace in the sight of the Lord so he didn't deserve it he didn't earn it it was just given to him and he was moved and he built the ark and it would have been an incredible thing to be in there and it would have been amazing to recognize you're in God's provided way but it would have been incredible thing to hear the destruction on the outside so his whole world was destroyed and then he would have been looking for a Deliverance out of this boat when are we going to go back on the land when is it going to you know you know when are we going to build again when are we going to see the new world and he sent a dove and God he you know he sent the crow The Raven I can't remember exactly which one but they're the same type of bird and that one it left and it never came back cuz that's a scavenger it can eat anything but a dove it can't eat where the crow eats it it doesn't have any Gall it can only eat certain things and so that's why the Dove came back and and the second time the Dove came back it had that Olive uh branch in its mouth so it was signifying that by him coming back into the ark it was signifying to Noah your days of suffering in this Ark are over amen he was actually signaling to Noah God was showing Noah the days that you're going to be in this boat is coming to an end and you're going to walk out into a new world Hallelujah and then now but that was just a shadow and then Jesus came who was the bridge between eternity and time he was Jacob's Ladder Jacob was there asleep and he he saw a ladder come down from heaven and angels descending and ascending and there was God on the top of the ladder and you know of course that ladder could not anchor on anchor on Jacob cuz he was an unconverted man even though he was a promised son he was a Believer but then that Jesus God had to become a man that an anchor could anchor on a man and then so the bridge between eternity and time the gulf was was was was bridged and God was signifying when Jesus went down when Jesus was born God was signifying here's eternity man's suffering days have come to an end amen suffering man that would walk in darkness would approach God through the blood of bulls and goats that time was coming to an end amen eternity became flesh and dwelt among us and then now the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove they signifying here is the end of man's suffering Hallelujah we could just look past a c in a time we're 2,000 years down the road and then brother brandham he preached a sermon the wings of a snow white dove and if you look at a prophet's life the they're living out things and they're representing they're actually representing you see you see Abraham was representing something when he took hagga and then he took Sarah the Bond woman and the free woman giving birth of two different lines of children you know two different Sons he was actually playing out a part of God Moses was a God to the people the things he did in his life that was God being played out and so now when a prophet comes upon the Earth you know his life is ordered and God is explain things in his life now if you go back if you go back from this is a 1965 he preaches that sermon if you go back to 1933 now he says the spirit of God descended on the river like a dove was the pillar of fire came back on the Ohio River and when the pillar of fire comes God is doing something when he when he appeared to Moses he was taking he was taking Israel out of bondage their suffering days were over and and they were going to go to a land that belonged to them they weren't going to be uh be under the slave master's whip anymore but they were ordained that they would sit in their Vineyards and they would enjoy the fa land and build houses and live in peace if they walked with God so their days of suffering were over and then now and then now when Jesus came the first time the pillar of fire was there in a man God and flesh and it was signifying the days of suffering Humanity being a slave to sin being a slave to sin nature that was going to be done away with amen because all those in the Old Testament they were still that the blood bus and goats could not undo sin nature so even though they were Believers that sin nature still govern them that's why you see David David was a man after God's Own Heart and we'll and we and we'll Embrace him one day we'll see him over there and he always said I'll not you know he said I kept the Lord ever before me that I sin not against him right the writ his word is always before me and you know but then when he saw bash Sheba uh his because he was unconverted there was nothing in there to keep this flesh in subjection so when he saw bash Sheba he he he committed adultery with her did all those things had had her husband killed all those different things because of sin nature was ruling his life amen but yet he still one of gods but then now this side of Calvary we have something where the life of God comes into you and if you yield yourself to it it'll take control and it will give you dominance over everything of the Flesh and then so Jesus came and that was signifying the end of man's suffering under sin and that's why you know Paul could write and Paul met the same Pillar of Fire and God came and dwelt in him and he began to write how we're no longer you know we shouldn't be a slave to sin anymore and we're free in Christ because he experienced those things and then now we come down 2,000 years down to the end and the pillar of fire appears on the Ohio River and a voice speaks out of it saying as John the Baptist forun the first coming of Christ so your message will forun the second coming and so it was signifying now because you know was signifying God was saying your man's suffering this world's suffering your sin is going to be done away with I mean in terms of there's going to be a wiping off of the Earth there's going to be a time when the millennium's going to come and God's children are going to be resurrected and there's going to be a time of peace upon the Earth and Israel is going to be back in it Homeland and God is going to wind up his plan because we read in Revelations 10 and said he said and he and he cried out with a loud voice those seven voices you know Thunders out of their voices that time should be no more and actually in my mind it says that there shall be no more delay so God is declaring that I'm I'm going to wind up my plan I'm going to burn the devil I'm going to burn all of his minions I'm going to vaporize all of his workings I'm going to restore Eden it's been 2,000 years say now is the end of man's suffering hallelujah amen that that eternity eternity visited the earth once again amen through a through a Ministry of a prophet and so now he was signifying so God was saying just like in Noah you he brought a message on a dove wings of a snow white dove then Jesus came on the wings of a dove eternity came into being in flesh and then now here we are the ministry remember he was to forun the second coming and but you say well brother Brown's Ministry is come and gone isn't he meant to introduce Jesus like John did he did he introduced him as the word amen you read the seven Cal Min um um sermon he says maybe I'm just laying a f a platform for that great one to come and some people take that say I'm him but he but that's not it's not another eighth messenger he's actually saying I'm laying that platform and what who was the platform for he introduced Jesus the word he introduced the lamb to you amen he introduced he introduced the son of man was introduced but in the first coming there are two different bodies but Jesus didn't come have to come in a body flesh to pay the price of redemption it already been done so he took a redeemed son to show what the power of the calvary did he took a redeemed son stepped into that son and revealed himself Hallelujah so then he comes to the end of his ministry and he preaches a sermon on on the wings of a snow white dove and he speaks of when he's he speaks it every seven years in his life this this this terrible stomach sickness would afflict them and even in his ministry he had to go off the field because it was so bad and then he had this he had this I can't remember it was a vision or dream you should go and listen to the sermon there's like this little black squirrel thing and he was a young kid by a tree in this thing jumped off a limb and actually jumped down into his throat and was tearing at his you know you you know you know inside his stomach but then the Lord said don't worry he's only 6 in long so he's going to come to his end and then and then finally he had another dream or vision and he's out there in the desert and the same thing that that that he saw as a boy jumping into him tearing his tummy that same thing jumped off but it fell it it actually missed him fell into a cactus Bush and impaled itself on the thorns and then the Lord told him go up into sabido Canyon and he walks up there and he walks along a path that he knows and he sees that thing he sees that thing dead amen and then he continues walking and he sees a pure Snow White Dove amen and he said so what is what is what is this it's not just a story or a prophet has a vision it's symbolizing now God is telling him your enemy's dead you'll suffer no more from this thing amen right the end of his life and God to me this is just me but to me God is showing now why was the dove there why was he saying now this is the end of your suffering every type of Dove is in the scripture it's symbolizing the end of man's suffering I'm going to do a furtherance of my plan amen he says normally there's no white doves up there you go you go listen or read it very unusual thing he just left it there he recognized God was showing himself something amen and that was the end of his suffering and God was showing to us now through the ministry of of the Prophet this is the end of man's suffering I'm going to put an end of all the works of the enemy he may war against you and try and wear you out and try and destroy you and we live in these bodies and we fight all kinds of things and we think we've won the battle but yet another enemy rears its head and we're going to fight another battle and it seems like just an onward taking one trench and then taking the other trench and going into that bunker and clearing that bunker out like an endless just a Warfare grinding along in the trenches who feels like that sometimes amen but there's an end to it amen there's an end to the suffering there's an end God God is not an author of of of frustration he knows what he's doing but there's an end to all these things if we could just look at where we're going if God would just let us look past the curtain of time amen where he was said the voices said keep pressing the battle if you only and he and he couldn't describe the place but he wanted to describe the place and it's more real than this room you're sitting in it's more real than the body you're in it's more real than your next breath Hallelujah if we could just look past a an eternal place that's been prepared for you think of it when when if you wanted to throw a surprise party for someone you'd make it how they would like it would you not I mean you would prepare it that they would enjoy the place and God knows what you like God knows the kind of places you like to go scenery in nature and mountains or Hills or beaches or whatever it is rugged places and he's prepared it brother says the Millennium will be be it'll have mountains there'll be valleys there'll be deserts cuz some people like deserts some people like mountains some people like plat land some people like all kinds of things because he's prepared a certain way because he knows how people like things amen but the voice this voice that we've heard if you could just I wish I had words but if we could just look past the curtain a Time Amen to recognize our suffering we just have a a few years upon this Earth and if the Lord should take us a lot of us would live a lot shorter I think it was Jacob it was Jacob no yes Jacob he comes down to Egypt you know Joseph's there reveals himself to his Brethren says is my father still alive and and he calls he calls him you know you know brings him down to Egypt he he he shows him to pharaoh and Pharaoh says how old are you he gives his age but he says my days are few and been has been full of evil basically he hadn't been enjoying you he you know he didn't say there was anything good think about he's a patriarch he's a Believer who whose grandfather Abraham amen and he met God for himself but he recognized I'm not I'm not driving my tent Stakes too deep amen this this world is is is really even if you think the world we live in is far more evil world than he lived in it's a far more wicked place and yet people want to people want to drive their tent Stak far deep what what am I saying they want to they want to look at natural things too much I say we should look at you know we should be good stewards of what we have but in the same token we shouldn't be so Earthly minded we're no Heavenly good amen amen amen because if we really want to be really Earthly good we should be tooo Heavenly minded it doesn't mean we should neglect day-to-day things and our job and our family you know you understand what I mean but we should be always have it on our hearts God's called me I've heard his voice it says remember we read there in the Song of Solomon you think that scripture is so inspired it's not just a song Amen God put himself he he wrote this to you I trust when you read this you say I am that shunamite Hallelujah and in the song God's speaking about me he says the flowers appear upon the Earth what is that speaking of Springtime amen the the time of the singing birds has come absolutely in the springtime it says and the voice of the turtle and we it's the turtle dove that's what that word means so the voice of the turtle dove the dove is is heard in our land what is that signifying peace amen a d voice peace has come a new season an old season's passed a new season is coming Hallelujah there's a new Season's coming amen the voice of the dove who was speaking to us through the ministry of the Prophet I say it was the Heavenly Dove God himself he was declaring himself the voice of the dove is is is is heard in our land absolutely it is I mean God sent you a voice he spoke through that man to tell you where you're from and where you're going and who you are not just so you could fill your mind with Doctrine and understanding but you would understand who you are Hallelujah you've been made to hear that voice and to receive that voice it's not a haphazard thing you heard it or it found you it had to find you amen it had to find you the Fig Tree put forth her green figs when did the when did the when did the pillar of fire appear on Ohio River 1933 when was Israel found as a nation was it 1948 Amen to me that was I'm not he said it was like a ball of fire came down to me it's like the same one that came down on the River Jordan the same God that came down there came over the prophet in 1933 amen signifying peace has come Earthly things things of time are going to be done away with and Eternity is going to come back upon the Earth again sin is going to be he purchased it all on Calvary but now he's going to wipe it off am hallelujah amen and all of his children will be gathered to him amen the victory put for her buds that's Israel we know and fines and the vines with tender grapes give a good smell and what is the sum total of that Arise My Love my fear one and come away amen what is what is Israel becoming a nation tell me God saying Arise My Love My Fair one come away amen they have to be in their Homeland that God can gather a bride out of every Kindred nation and tongue oh my Dove Thou Art in the Cliff of The Rock and the secret place of the stairs this is this is this is your this is you speaking amen is he your heavenly Dove Hallelujah thou are in the Cliffs of The Rock and the secret place of the stairs let me see thy countenance I'm going to go on it maybe in a couple of Sundays but we this this age is the age where the people see the face of God Amen oh I'll show it to you in the scripture not now we don't have time but I'll show you the Bri di sees him unveiled in this hour amen when brother R preached the service he preached twice said the Mighty God unveiled before us for us and the unveiling of God he wasn't just finding some fancy title to excite people he was declaring that Mighty God is unveil before us hallelujah the mighty one amen the Lord Jesus been unveiled before us hallelujah amen let me see thy countenance which is thy face let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely Hallelujah take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vine for our Vines have tender grapes my beloved is mine I trust that's your see how do you let off the pressure recognize where you're going all these things are just these things are not even going to be a memory all the hardship all the struggle all the burdens of Life they won't even be a memory the only thing you'll remember is God you brought me through that place you brought me from this this this this rubber sheep of life here hallelujah that's what you'll remember amen hallelujah my beloved is mine and I am his he Feth me among the lies oh he does until the day break and the Shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a row or a young heart upon the mountains of Beth Hallelujah Arise My Love My Fair one come away Noah drifted on the flood many days sent him a sign on the wings of a dove though we have suffered in many a day and many a way God has sent you a sign why is God real Among Us have you ever thought about it it's not just to show himself for the sake of it but he's made himself real because he wants you to recognize you're a part of Eternity amen you're a part of him why did he speak to you why does it mean something to you because you're an eternal being and God is finding parts of himself amen if there's a twinge in your heart for him just give yourself don't hold back oh what will people think what will God think of you the angels will rejoice will they think it says the Angels rejoice when one comes to him all of Heaven erupts Hallelujah and we got to recognize we don't have to we're not in the first church age I say thank God we're not in the second Church age I say thank God we're not on the fourth or the or third or fourth or fifth or sixth I say thank God we're not at the start of the seventh I say thank God Amen we're at the end of all things things I say thank God Amen because many have wanted to live many saints that have had have been under expectation have gone into the grave and we want to be where you are now Hallelujah well there be a people that won't taste death but they'll just walk out Victorious amen into eternity many people even even many message people that have that have died in the faith would want to be where you are I say Lucky them in a way because they're rejoicing they receiving their reward but they all of them would want to say what would you want to see I want to see the Rapture I want to see the dead in Christ rise and here you are in your health and I could say relatively in your youth in your strength amen I want to see the dead in Christ rise I want to look past the Cur the time amen when when now you may take me you you may think I'm a bit off in a in some way but when brother B said let them look past a curtain a Time I Think God answer his prayer let us look past the curtain of time Hallelujah here we are don't take it for granted amen just any day now our Lord is coming he's coming back for you and me Hallelujah this is where we are friends oh if we could just look past a curtain at time I have these burdens I have these things about tomorrow I don't know where how things are going to work out in life just cast your cares upon him because he cares for you amen life is just to prepare character in you oh my Hallelujah just think what's eternity what's now compared to Eternity what's a few days a few turns of the Earth around this little place we call home compared to Eternity oh I've got a mountain of a problem I don't know the way he knows the way he prepared he pre-ordered your trials he pre-made your trials he pre-made your path he knew where you're going amen he's not surprised oh God help me and he and he and he knew it would be there and he's not worried about it he wants you to respond amen I don't know how I'm going to get by and my life is just in this course and I don't know how I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel he is the light at the end of the tunnel amen he knows what's going to happen and he's not worried about you because he has confidence in his salvation do you think the do you think the devil is going to get one of his bride no sir no sir not he doesn't ever have a chance in hell amen hey we're we're in hell we're in Satan's Eden this is the greatest this is this is this is the best the devil can put amen hey think you know it's like you know like the block or you know someone you know they try to make the best house competition and this is the people's mind this is how we can make this house so good that the people will judge for it and they'll buy it they'll want it that's what the devil's done with the this world how can I make it so great that everyone will be so blinded and they'll worship me in in different facets of fashion or sport or entertainment or or economics or political things or whatever people be so blinded and yet there's a people upon the Earth that they look at the best the devil has and they could even wait up with what the worst at what God would have and that's say I'd rather live in the gutter amen redeemed amen hallelujah then then then be the richest greatest person on all the Earth Hallelujah I trust that's how you see things amen I would rather go through Great Tribulation every day and go to Glory than live 70 years as the king of the earth and then go to hell amen because when you come to the end and then what and what then is the question and then you know you know what then what if man would gain the whole world in lose his soul Hallelujah but then what good would a man do to have his soul saved hallelujah amen if we could just look past the curtain of time it's just there brother brandham he looked back he was laying on his bed and it was just up there at a different speed amen the dimension is right just just there it's not past the Milky Way and past the whatever and on the other side of someplace over somewhere it's right there Heaven is right there amen that and all it'll be when he calls when these bodies change we just step from this Dimension into the other dimension amen it's just there amen if we could just look past the curtain of time why is it and I'm going to close with this the reason you're feeling may be how you're feeling or how God spoke to you and you can always go back to that time I trust you've had that time is because God revealed himself to you because he wants you to recognize you're my son or you're my daughter amen I've laid claim on you and you're coming to be where I am Hallelujah and the works of the enemy even our own desires or what we think we should do in life will not stop you getting there hallelujah it's not going to he doesn't save us one day to lose us another day God doesn't work like that he makes up his mind he makes up his mind he doesn't change his mind amen so when he when he chose you before the found foundation of the world he wasn't worried with what you would go through in this little space of time amen that would that that would change his mind that it' actually change his mind halfway through your life oh no actually no I actually can he can't change his God cannot change his thinking God doesn't change his mind amen well you say Well it he said it you know he it said that God you know repented that even made man he wasn't wishing I wish I never made man he was just sad in how they ended up amen amen and then when it and then when he told Moses Moses I'll wipe out Israel and I'll start with you and he said no and then Moses said no block my name out of the book they actually said God repented he he didn't change his mind he knew Moses would do that amen he knew Moses would throw himself in the breach so he was doing that to see what is in you Moses amen what is in you Moses I'm going to show you what's in you Moses amen so I said that because it may look like oh he God doesn't change his mind he can't he can't have a he can't change his thoughts towards you amen qu your musicians I'm just going to wrap up with this amen so if he has chosen you amen he's not worried but we get so caught up in these 70 years how's my retirement going to be where am I going to end up in you know you know what's my 5ye plan all those things are good we should have a plan but don't be so caught up in in that little space that you lose sight of really where you're going whatever you do don't get so because if you just get caught up in natural things then the pressures of Life can wear you down sure we'll have pressures of life sure we'll have hardship and we'll have stress we'll have burdens that's all part of living but if you keep your eyes on the wrong thing if you keep your eyes on the burdens and the stress then they can wear you down but if you keep your eyes on Eternal things then then he'll give you the strength to go through those things amen you got to know whom you have believed that's the main thing that's why I always just pray Lord let us look past the curtain the time every day if we could just see that place that's if we could really just have a glimmer and in a way we do when we feel his presence we have a glimmer of that place CU we know it's not just our mind working this out it's not just us trying to live a certain way but God and he actually reinforces I'm in control everything's going going to be okay you may not understand how it's going to work out but it's going to work out
