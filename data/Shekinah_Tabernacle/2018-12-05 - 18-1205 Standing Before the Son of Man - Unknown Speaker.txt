morning I mean tonight rather sorry let's just go in the scripture to Luke 21 god bless you all good to have you one here tonight Luke Luke 21 then we're going to go to Revelations 22 Luke 21 in verses 34 to 36 C is here now and take heed to yourselves at least at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth so that includes you watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that ye that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of men I mean let's go to revelations chapter 22 we're going to read verses 1 to 6 relation 22 1 to 6 is and he showed me a pure river of water of life career clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and the myths of the street of it on either side of the river were was there the Tree of Life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations and there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever I mean let's just leave it there let's bow heads in a word of Prayer if you want to be remembered of Prayer just want to raise your hands to the Lord he sees every need that we have and you're glad he's mindful gracious father we thank you very much for this evening we can gather together in your presence lord I just pray father you just touch every heart Lord by your spirit Lord I pray you'll just come and you'll just minister to us Lord and speak to us and father may we Lord we always need more of you so I pray Lord you would give us more of yourself this night Lord Father may we be feed from your word Lord may we be spiritually full and overflowing of your goodness Lord and I pray father you just take this Scripture and lord I pray just bless your word to every heart Lord we Lord we know Lord as you even said without you we can do nothing and truly we can do nothing in our own self slaughter takes you to come and you live Lord them Lord through Lord by you we can do all things and father may be you living Lord in us and through us we just want to commit the service into your hands we thank you Lord just bless each one here bless those who couldn't make it as well look be their portion too in Jesus Christ name Lord I ask amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats tonight I know I want to take a subject and basically everyone you feel very insufficient but this one I want to speak about when we stand before the Son of Man you know this life is we you know we understand in the scripture that it sees but this life is but a vapor you know we are not really living for the now you know there's one inevitable thing of everyone here in this room should time would tarry is that we all die you know should time go on we'll all die we'll all have a funeral service someone who'll carry our casket in and people will say some words and then they'll either you'll be cremated or put in the ground or you'll become a memory on this earth that's inevitable you know we can't man's trying to ultimately that want to merge themselves with machines and become immortal they'll say but I don't believe they'll be able to do it but there will come a time where if time should go on that we'll all be dead I know it wasn't expecting a hallelujah from that statement but you know they'll come a time where your last breath will be breathed your heart will stop you'll go somewhere and I just want to just think about you know if we could just you know we get so caught up sometimes in our situation of life and the things we may be struggling with and the things and even our own flesh wars against us you know how an emotion our own desires our own this body you know our temperament that we inherited from our family and that we weren't we would never have picked even our own selves and we some sometimes find it hard to look in the mirror at the person we are and you know who's had days like that we all have these battles you know and and where the maybe the next bill payment will come for all you know you're this you're there and this pressure and the family this pressure at school is pressure at your job there's pressure and the nation pressure in the world there's these struggles but if we could just look past those I mean if we could just really just look past everyday life and maybe next week and next month and Christmas and New Year and you know and look beyond to really we're we're going to end up we need to look beyond these five senses amen to really look you know because when we read that one day we'll stand before the Son of Man you know I trust that it's everyone's hearts desires that when you get to stand before him that day he will say these words to you he'll say well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord hallelujah and he'll bid gee I don't know how it'll be exactly but our name will be called the redeemed will be gathered round the throne and your name will be called and you'll stand before the Son of Man and he will have a crown to place on your head and he'll say well done and you know how sometimes witness people you really look up to in life and you do something for them and and theirs and they thank you for it out of the bottom and they say thank you for doing that for me I so appreciate you doing that for me but in your heart you you just think it was nothing I mean because you love and appreciate them you know maybe it could have been a very hard task and maybe taking a very long time but when you hear that gratitude from them and your heart you just swell up with pride and you say you know you maybe just said thank you but in yourself you just say it was nothing it was a joy hallelujah to to do that for you and you know not that we're looking for rewards you understand that you know we don't serve God out of trying to earn our salvation or earn the rapture it's given by the grace of God without money or price we just have to receive for salvation we just got to accept him accept this word that's all we need to do hallelujah remember when you when we cuz we will stand there one day we will stand there just like you're sitting here now you will stand there and then you will stand before him you will see him face to face I mean just like we're here today and that world is more real than this world at first life is but a vapor who seen some vapor who seen some smoke and you watch it and it was-- and then where does it go and he can t remember really what it did amen who's on a real hot day you take a real cold drinking you just breathe it out and just all kind of where did that go that's how our life is it comes it goes is gone and where are we but there will come a time which had this life is very temporal but there will come a time where we will stand before him and that'll be a great moment and I trust even if you're not now by the end of the service something and you will settle in your heart and you'll say Lord I want to stand there see you face to face I want to hear those words not that I will receive anything I don't care about no crown as as brother Burnham he would tell the story of a man called Oh hallelujah I love was dying and I thought he'd died they'd gathered round his deathbed and they thought he died he came back and they're all startled and and they said where'd you go he says well I was there and I was an angel and you know invited me through a you know through the gate I went through the gate and and and then an angel you know they said here's your here's your crown here's your robe but he says I don't care about no crown no robe and they and they asked well what kind of a reward do you want he says I just want to stand there and look at him for a thousand years and I trust that as as as brother bran would say you know I trust that's the attitude of every Christian we just want to get a look at him just to see the one who redeemed us see the one who purchased our salvation seen the one when he took your sin hallelujah he took your sin but that you could not place his Oh God I'll pay it for them hallelujah I'll carry their grief Oh Oh I'll carry their wounds they're playing their hurt hallelujah I'll put on human flesh that I'll understand what it's like to be a child I'll understand what it's like to be a teenager I'll stab what it's like to be an adult oh oh so all understand what it's like to be rejected and despised and used and evil spoken of and ridiculed hallelujah I will I will do that you know it's amazing experiences do not leave you they meant you think of some great traumatic experience it's still very part of you and you can just think it for a second and your heart maybe begins to pound the same feelings that rush through your body come back because it's a part of you you can't get rid of it for nothing you know our Lord Jesus will carry those words hallelujah he weren't just when he came out of the grave there was no delete button just pushed and he forgot the suffering he knew what it was like he carries that hallelujah he's the high priest can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities brother Branham would he would there was someone who came forward for prayer and I don't know what they were what was wrong with them but he was praying for them and he says Lord you understand holy and the person was healed hallelujah our God isn't a robot our God isn't some distant thing who doesn't care about you he cares a lot about you he cares more about you than anyone in this earth ever will care for you even even your spouse your soulmate he cares way more no one there's no one who cares for you like Jesus cares for you hallelujah I'm so glad that's true amen and those that are sealed we read their they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads glory to God I trust this means something to you now this brother Branham would speak about going beyond the curtain of time you know I scribbled this out but my writing scary so I just I just copied it quickly but he says now he speaks about this is from the rejected King in and this is just the first service where he speaks about about going me on the curtain of time I trust when you hear it it means something to you remember we're all going to die if time should tarry the Lord made a door open that we don't have to go to be lost mmm buddy he made a door that we can go off and be saved holy that we can go to you know heaven is far greater than the greatest greatest thing you can imagine it's greater than the best camp experience as the it's greater than the best service you've ever been and it's far greater nothing can compare to being there even for a moment how great it is hallelujah where where he said now he said and God let me press the battle but if it comes to dying I am no mom or that would be a joy it would be a pleasure to enter from this corruption and disgrace he says if I could make up yonder 1 billion miles high a square block and that's perfect love so you see as a billion miles high there's a square block of perfect love and every time each step this way it narrows so it gets from a block of square block approval up every time you come this way narrows narrows gets less and less right each step at Darrow's until you get down to where we are now it would be merely a shadow of corruption that little something we can sense and feel that there is something somewhere he says he says that's how great it is you know cuz if you think about just a square block of perfect love a billion miles away and every time you come closer gets less and less and less and less until it comes to you and we have glorious times you know when it comes to you Allu yeah and it just feels like nothing matters and he's the greatest thing in the world and as love just fills your soul and you don't want to leave those places you just say Lordan but can I just remained like this forever and ever and ever and ever that's merely a shadow he says of corruption he's just a just merely a show so it's a nothing compared to their that little something we can sense and feel that there is something somewhere we don't know what it is he says oh my precious friends my beloved darlings of the gospel my begotten children under God listen to me your pastor you I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever there's no way to explain it there's no way you just can't do it I just can't do it but whatever you do friend lay aside everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot where you can love everybody every enemy everything else you mean when you first met him everything was wonderful nothing mattered remember that moment remember that time the trees looked greener the sky looked more wonderful you know you know you see a sunset that's like Lord you just painted that just for me whose if you know what I'm talking about the world is just greater even you know everyone around you is just nicer hallelujah that's not psychology that's not emotion that's God doing that when you look at the world and the world seems different but it's the same Amen you know what I'm talking I trust you know what I'm talking about Alleluia it is lay aside everything until you get perfect life perfect lovers the Holy Ghost oh yeah this is only perfect love will enter into that place now let's just imagine if I may maybe this I would you see but we're in the rapture well we are in the rapture but the dead in Christ are here you see the Apostle Paul when they're being credible you see Irene Eason Polycarp of Martin and you see Mary and Martha and Elizabeth and all the different ones through the scripture great heroes of faith you see your white cliff who translated the Bible into English and you know Tyndale and all these great heroes of faith maybe people you admired you see brother Burnham and different ones who've gone on before wouldn't that be incredible to see them but then we caught up there's a deep calling to the deep I pray this goes beyond just a service is a deep calling to the deep I trust you have it and you something and you says I'm not I don't I don't belong in this world I don't belong in this world I have to live here I've got to exist and you know I want to whatever but ultimately I don't belong here I belong in another place and there's a longing there's a deep calling to the deep and that's like a you know as as it says in Jeremiah let's go to Jeremiah 33 and 11 shall we you know this Bible's our love leader Amen I trust it's a love letter to you you say that's just emotion anything without emotion brother Brahim sees his deed I believe in half out religion hallelujah cuz heartfelt religion will see you through it'll hold you you won't hold it hallelujah Jeremiah 33 11 you ever see brother Branham and the deep thought the deep he prays his Lord when he get to the end of the way and the arms are all stacked and we get up to your house and he you know finishes his prayer and he wipes his eyes his sorry I'm crying like a baby but there's something when I just talk about him right he was a man's man right but he wasn't a statue he had heartfelt religion but he was a man's man brother Perry Greene gave a testimony when they were in hunting yeah your brother Graham said the first person to brush your teeth is a you know you know so he was a man you know he was a man's man but he had a heart right he wasn't just some you know and you see him there are thousands of people say sorry you know that's crying when he's talking to him because there's just something about him when he draws close amen Jeremiah 33 and 11 it is the voice of joy the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of Hosts for the Lord is good and His mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praising to the house of the Lord for our will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the Lord hallelujah so he's saying that this is how it's going to be it's going to be the voice of joy now this is talking about you he's not just chunk Jeremiah's not just talking about this thing but this is how as it was at the first it shall be now in the beginning they had their first love right before their feet before the church age started the you're the bride of the first age they had a first love hallelujah you know what a first love is like you fall in love with the Lord Jesus you'll know what a first love really is amen he's wonderful doesn't matter if you have it all though you have nothing you've got him and that satisfies that lasts it means something halleluyah doesn't matter what people will look at the street that you like it doesn't matter i'm inverters now a lighter brighter is my day and is such a joy to walk with him i mean but there's the voice of gladness who's glad from a heart i mean the voice of the bridegroom we've heard the voice of the bridegroom this message is the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride you've got to respond I mean this this message is a message of love divine love hallelujah that's what I experienced when I first heard it I wasn't in a church I just had the tapes in the Bible and all I heard was love I didn't hear law and rules and thou shalt I heard the vine love hallelujah give yourself to me the Lord said and I'll fill you and he did hallelujah and it's been glorious ever since I heard from another land I'm here I heard from where I'm going to I trust you've heard the same voice I mean when you've heard the voice of the eternity speak and there's something and you're responding saying yes their voice Buller I'm part of that voice as a brand of Bragg number one hallelujah I am the voice of God are one because we are the bride and he's the bridegroom they become one something does it mean something to you I mean there's a deep calling to the deep the voice of a bride was the voice of a bride and the bridegroom so honey I can't wait I don't want to be a part anymore hallelujah you understand it's a longing hello yeah Amen you say what is he I don't know I don't understand you meet him and you'll understand what I'm talking about Alleluia there's a deep calling to the deep brother bram spoke about beyond the curtain of time in the regions of the Blessed he says there's not a word to that would speak it friends perfect wouldn't even touch it that's how great it is he said everyone's young there's no sickness to Zee sorrow pain bad thoughts bad days everything's just perfect hallelujah everyone's young hallelujah he says sublime wouldn't even touch it that's how great it is I think if we could just look beyond the curtain a tie it would change a lot of things sometimes you know the devil wants to keep us earthbound he wants to keep her he wants us overcharged with the kids of life that's a sneer that's come upon the earth and we can't escape but if if Jesus says that would come upon the whole earth where do you live are you you and the earth yes I trust you are let's not come in Houston to whoever I hope you don't have a problem you know in space somewhere you're upon this earth right so this nice try and we'll try and stretch you and overcome you and you'll be over care overcome with the cares of life you know don't look at those things the devil wants to keep the earth bound God wants you in heaven Jesus wants you in heaven that's why this message is a rapture call hallelujah and so now we don't you know we're going to look beyond the curtain of time that's why you know when the Holy Spirit moves that's eternity reaching down that's heaven coming down into the room and guys try to tell you just beyond the river just through this rail I mean there's a world that is far more real than this world and God's trying to get your attention you belong in that world I've come to get you to this world hallelujah that you want to know and understand you don't belong here you're in destination is not the grave or the tribulation your end destination is heaven hallelujah that's why this message came and brother Brahim cities lying on the bed just for his translated beyond the curtain of time and heaven was actually just above the doorframe it wasn't far away sometimes we think is blump here but beyond Pluto someplace far away no it's just there it's just in a dimension moving faster than this dimension it's right there God's not far away God's not far away someplace someplace someplace someplace he's here heaven is here also colors here but heaven is here that's the main thing hallelujah yes and then he found himself before he realized he was there hallelujah why because the Holy Ghost was in him and it took him there and he is wondering what's going to happen when I die cuz he thought he'd just like whoops of smoke floating around he goes brother nibble he can't shake his hand or any he says the West was smart and her voice said to him Jonah see the past occurred in a time I believe this do you believe it I believe he was taken there and brother has he don't help me so much and before he knew it he was there and he put his hand on his head he had a full head of hair and he saw his body laying on the bed and then he sees everyone hello yeah amen and then and then it's a time for him to go back he says do I have to go back to that thing he said brother Bram says this world is a dump now I remember a dump you got a silver street dump that's not a dump that's clean when I was young this is in Gisborne that was a real dump it was just bulldozed everywhere and bulgar added just stunk and it was rancid horrible thing that was a dump I went there to this dump I thought this is not where's the dump I'm looking for the dump you know you go up this concrete and you know you drive up you just push your stuff over the side a front-end loader pushes it off it does whatever that wasn't Ginsburg dump that place didn't even stink I'm a where's the rubbish you know but a real dump it stinks there's rats there's diseased seagulls all manner of stuff maggots moving around the whole thing moves and you know and you taste it before you see it and see the smell it is that strong he says that's what this world is like and it can be polished up and it can be clean and the nicest clothes and we can think we're a million dollars and it's a dump you get a look at where's your priority you know so many people worry about the cares of the we need to worry about this life we need a job we need an education we need to live right but don't make it your all where your heart is that's where you where your heart is that's where your treasure shall be also are you investing in the bank of heaven this world is broke this world as brokers just digits as brother Isaac was saying and it's all going to fall over and they're predicting the United States is already going into recession because of some market thing I can't explain it I won't try but it's happened in the previous about six recessions with the amount of income you get from different bonds and things that basically goes from instead of a profit it kind of goes inverse and goes down some kind of I shouldn't see it anything anyway but it's happened in the last recessions and we're here and it's going down where is it going to go doesn't go up it's going to go down so where are your treasures I've got treasures in heaven I trust you've got treasure in heaven because at the end of the day this world is not going to be this world anymore there's going to be a holy fire come down and it's going to be renovated and the saints of God that are deemed are going to be here and a holy New Jerusalem and it's going to be more wonderful than you can even imagine hallelujah but the main thing as we get to see him that's the main thing brother Branham you know because you got to think about it really what do we what are we Christians for we're not Christians this so we can explain from Genesis to Revelation and and and from 1947 to 1965 and have it all together just right it's more than that it's actually not that it's the life of God the word becoming flesh in you that you know the author of the book that's the main thing you know the voice behind the voice amen that's the that is the main thing if you know him we're all going to step through a door right and some step through that door death a lot younger than others right but we're going to go through the door who's going to catch you when you go through the door that's the only thing that matters right brother brems 14 he shot he's losing blood in the hospital they don't have blood transfusions in those days he begins to drop he begins to fall and he and he said there's no mama there no daddy there no one to catch him he cries out there was no God there right came to that boy and all that and then he you know tried to bargain with God nee and he came back to life because he had a job to do upon the earth but at the end of the day what matters do we know her more do we not know him if you know him it'll pay off it'll pay off a lot and you wrote one regretted for a second hallelujah because you'll see him and there won't be a voice saying depart from me either work iniquity there'll be a voices well done my good and faithful servant he didn't say well done my good and successful servant well done my good and faithful what if we're cool to do let's be faithful to it I'm in John the Baptist he ended up in prison he thought you know his you know his eagle eyes filmed over he's wondering about the Christ year he sent his servants to you know his disciples to go ask Jesus and now the one or do we look for another and they came back with the report and he rested he said though he was the one he probably thought well as my life been worth it I've been however long from a young child to 30 or whatever in the wilderness eating locusts and wild honey preached for six months end up in this place but I guarantee you when the crown of life is put on that glorious head there'll be a voice saying well done my good and faithful servant hallelujah it depends we want to be good and faithful amen all Lord but we know it's him if we ever there to Tim in us that makes us good and faithful yeah we just yielded ourselves to him and he does it amen brother Bram tells the account of of brother Bosworth he's come down to the ends of his life and he's there by his deathbed and he asked brother Bosworth what is the what's the greatest time of your life he's a man that's dying I don't know how old he is maybe in his eighties he served God 60 odd years what's the greatest time of your life and brother Bosworth says right now because he's the one that I've lived for it's going to walk through that door and I'm going to go with him hallelujah and that's what happened and that should be the thing on our hearts more than anything that whenever it happens the one that we have looked for the one who were felt as presents come and meet us and wash your our sins away and confirm to us you're mine and I've redeemed you I've bought you wholly more than a motion more than a nice idea more than just because mummy and daddy do it but because it became real hallelujah trusts come real to you you say well I've never felt anything take him at his word Thank You Medes word the devil lies to us and says it's not real it's just emotion no I felt a lot of emotion in my life but when he comes it's very different from just emotion I mean when he comes it's very different than just a feeling hallelujah it's very different it's a reality hallelujah he's a real being he's not just an idea this is not something that's just been crafted for 2,000 years to control people that's God come down reveal his word saying is there's not an end when you die it's just the beginning this life is but a vapor this life is like a dream you know how you had some crazy dream you work out well that was crazy right one day we'll wake up right one day we'll be an eternity and we'll think that was crazy Alleluia so he asked brother Bosworth yes do you realize where you're going he says yes but brother Branham all I love from the past 60 years has been for Christ and any minute he will come in that door to take me home and that should be the attitude that should be more than just in here because it sounds good it should something be in here saying any minute I could be this could be the last moment upon the earth but any minute now he's going to come through that door and take me home hallelujah that should be the attic attitude of every every Christian I think I mean let's go to you know we read I don't know if we read it but but revelations 21 and 4 it says he shall wipe all tears away from their eyes you know I don't know how it's gonna be but when we see him it's gonna be wonderful it's gonna be the greatest thing to stand before him hallelujah and it's gonna mean a lot it's gonna mean a lot I mean you think we're gonna be you know when I actually get really excited I get very quiet I don't shower I actually get very quiet and you know I don't know what how you're gonna be it doesn't really matter all different but there's gonna be something we see him as he is as I said to be wonderful to see all the other you know the dead in Christ race and see them but they will pale in comparison to when we see him hallelujah and it will be the most glorious moment of our lives and you'll say Lord thank you you allowed me to come to this place because it wasn't me that got me here it's you that got me here where I was saved by your grace and my walk is by your grace and the rapture is by grace as your divine influence upon my heart and its reflection in the life it's your doing this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in our eyes hallelujah and that's why in reality we know no flesh will glory in his presence because we know that it's him that got us there where were we revelations 21 and 4 and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there she be and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he and he that said upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I'm looking forward to hearing that it is done I'm Alfred I make at the beginning in the end and I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son hallelujah it'll be worth it it'll be worth it every try along the a long life's journey you know the Apostle Paul comes down to his last day upon the earth he's really written to timber the a crown of life lace for me on that other side and all them that lovers glorious appearing he comes down to the end of his life he spent a lot of time and in jail he's being beaten he's been stoned he's been shipwrecked he's been all kinds of things he was in such a place he writes to Timothy bring my other coat that's how cold he is in prison he doesn't have underfloor heating like the prisons we have in this country there's no underfloor heating there but he comes down and you just think about that if you could stand there and watch the beheading of the Apostle Paul you probably are you'll probably ask him what's the greatest moment of your life right now because I'm going to put my neck down here and extra swords gonna fall and I'm going to be with him and this is the moment I've been looking for I was carried up to the third heaven it was glorious I had visitations of his presence it was glorious but now it's gonna be permanent just like the as I said a while ago about the you know the Saints that gave their lives in the Coliseum hallelujah they're anointed to walk in there they are anointed they weren't afraid of those lions they weren't afraid of the gladiators you think about it what if I see it in a minute we're gonna be in glory hallelujah I thought it wouldn't matter what state we could all be in prison doesn't matter if we're in a concentration camp or before a firing squad or whatever it may be if I see if we're gonna be in glory in a minute I show it also hallelujah hallelujah we're out of here wouldn't we what do we when you think about it wouldn't you be rejoicing oh yeah you mean I get to go now to see the one that I love to see the one who redeemed me you know dance on streets of gold and live for eternity and you know I get out of this pest house hallelujah amen well that there's no fanaticism I trusted something and you say really it could be in a minute wouldn't that be lovely wouldn't that be good why not honor win say let's go come quick you know the Bible says the spirit and the bride say come hallelujah even so Lord Jesus come quickly so I'm gonna leave it with that don't you think about it what are we living for oh but this and this and this and this No what about him because listen listen this and this is gonna pass away we're all gonna die if time should tarry where are you gonna go where are you gonna end up we're all gonna end up somewhere the Lord GMO seas here I'm so glad the door of Mercy's here you just got to accept he said I don't know how to talk to him just talk to him be real brother branham tried to write a note and put it on a tree and then he goes and he prays in a wood cheat or whatever it was the devil says well it's too late and you know he always tries to push you away and hang and he says well I'm gonna talk to you anyway mister God Jesus wherever you are I'm sorry in all these things and God changed them amen so how about us soon and very soon we're gonna see the king we're gonna stand before the Son of Man and it's gonna be wonderful to stand before him and he's gonna give us a crown but it's for something its rewards that we can give it back to him right we're gonna crown him king of kings and Lord of lords he's gonna wear many crowns why is that because we're gonna give him our crown amen and it's gonna be a glorious moment the presence that is upon the earth of His Holy Spirit it's just a little little little little little little foretaste of that and it's trying to get your attention to say there's a lamb beyond the river and it's for you and only the devil robbed you of a single more moment of holding you back I'd rather walk with the Lord than have another day with the devil right don't let him rob you God's here to walk with us to keep you he will see you through every trial he will see you through every storm he will see you through every rejection every peer pressure that tries to hold I know what peer pressure is like and he'll be back for a few years but you're just got to push through it you just say I'm sick and tired of this you know just respond to the deep calling to the deep well I've got my whole life in front of me I'd rather use that whole life for the Lord Jesus Christ that's how I feel amen cleared the musicians I want to sing I love him because he first loved me you maybe when you first meet him at glory she is amen it wasn't just a nice time for the he doesn't give us just a religious feeling he wants you to know there's a place around the wedding supper table for you that's why this word means something to you is because there's a place that this message is to call you to the wedding supper yeah right the reason that something spoke to your soul when you really heard the word is because there's a place at the table it's all staying sorry they stand this thing that I I love him let's just worship the Lord night Oh Lord I wanna I'm gonna stand before you one day it's gonna be wonderful we're not worthy to stand before his presence but he
