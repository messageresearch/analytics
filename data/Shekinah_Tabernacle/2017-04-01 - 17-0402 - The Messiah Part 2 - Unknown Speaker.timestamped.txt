[28:31] K what about the other one yeah
[28:34] okay okay good few okay te it's a
[28:38] pass praise the Lord
[28:42] um okay we just um I've actually got an
[28:45] item I'm going to do this
[28:46] morning praise God Amen
[28:53] um so this one
[28:58] maybe week and a half ago during the
[29:00] week as I was actually driving around
[29:03] and installing floors
[29:05] and going to the cafe and picking up
[29:08] this and picking up that and general
[29:12] daily happenings a
[29:16] song tune and different things just kept
[29:19] on coming throughout the driving and
[29:21] stopping and unloading and that so I
[29:24] actually wrote this song in my mind just
[29:26] driving around
[29:28] and then um I think I got a chance maybe
[29:31] on a Thursday or Friday night to
[29:33] Thursday night to finish some and then
[29:35] Friday night to actually figure out the
[29:39] chords that it was and how it actually
[29:41] um how the song actually worked to see
[29:43] if I was singing it correctly or not um
[29:47] and and this was uh finished on the um
[29:50] Friday before um Annie's mother passed
[29:54] away which was the Saturday night
[29:59] Sunday morning Sunday Sunday
[30:02] night was it Sunday
[30:04] night okay so I finished on the the yeah
[30:08] yes I know it was the Friday night
[30:09] because she went to hospital on the
[30:10] Saturday that's right so it's a
[30:13] different song than what I usually write
[30:14] it's it's we um I don't usually write
[30:17] this sort of style but I was thinking of
[30:20] um when I found out that his mother was
[30:22] quite sick I don't know I guess I I made
[30:25] the song for her I suppose you could say
[30:28] because it was different for me than my
[30:30] usual style but I want to sing the song
[30:32] I've got the words up there
[30:39] um and I went to the funeral on Saturday
[30:42] uh sorry on Friday and um I really
[30:46] enjoyed brother Andy's
[30:48] um would you call that a testimonial his
[30:52] his talk speech to me it was a testimony
[30:55] of the saving power of Jesus Christ
[30:58] I really enjoyed it um it was a light
[31:01] amongst the darkness and and I believe
[31:06] that she is okay now and his mother is
[31:09] okay and she is where this song is
[31:12] writing about I believe that and it's a
[31:16] a great hope that we have in Jesus
[31:18] Christ amen
[31:28] you put the stars in the sky and you
[31:32] told the
[31:34] morning you not drawn night until I have
[31:40] declared my plan in the

[46:37] sorry about that I think that's
[46:40] everything okay let's turn to the
[46:42] scripture shall we it's hard you come up
[46:44] here and your mind is all on on
[46:46] different things and you know um let's
[46:48] go to Psalms chapter 1
[47:02] I mean Psalms 1 and
[47:07] one we'll
[47:10] read we'll read down to verse three
[47:13] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[47:15] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[47:17] in the way of Sinners nor sth in the
[47:19] seat of the scornful but his Delight is
[47:21] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[47:24] doth he meditate Day Day and Night and
[47:27] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[47:29] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[47:31] fruit in his season his Leaf also shall
[47:34] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[47:38] prosper and let's go to Joel chapter
[47:44] 2 and we're just going to read
[47:48] verses um 21 down to 26 and then we're
[47:51] going to
[47:53] have uh one more scripture reading from
[47:55] Luke 21 so Joel
[48:02] 221 it says fear not o land be glad and
[48:06] rejoice for the Lord will do great
[48:08] things Be not Afraid ye Beasts of the
[48:11] field for the pastures of the Wilderness
[48:13] do spring for the tree beareth uh her
[48:16] fruit the Fig Tree and the vine doth
[48:18] yield their strength be glad then ye
[48:21] children of Zion and and rejoice in the
[48:23] Lord your God for he hath given you the
[48:25] former Reign moderately and he will
[48:27] cause to come down for you the rain the
[48:30] former rain and the latter rain in the
[48:32] first month and the flaw shall be full
[48:34] of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[48:37] wine and oil and I'll restore to you the
[48:39] years that the Locust hath eaten the
[48:41] cankerworm the caterpillar and the
[48:43] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[48:45] among you and you shall eat in plenty
[48:47] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[48:50] the Lord your God that hath dwelt dealt
[48:53] wondrously with you and my people shall
[48:56] never never be
[48:58] ashamed and let's go to Luke 21 just
[49:01] just one
[49:02] more uh reading
[49:08] there so Luke chap 21 and verse
[49:16] 29 and this is Jesus speaking and he
[49:18] spake to them a parable behold the Fig
[49:22] Tree and all the trees when they now
[49:26] shoot forth ye see and know of your own
[49:28] selves that summer is n at hand so
[49:30] likewise ye when you see these things
[49:32] come to pass you know that the kingdom
[49:34] of God is not at hand verely I say unto
[49:37] you this generation shall not pass away
[49:39] till all be fulfilled amen amen may the
[49:43] Lord bless his word you may have your
[49:45] seats now I want to continue on my
[49:50] thought I I think it's about three or
[49:51] four Sundays ago I can't remember how
[49:53] far back but I was speaking about
[49:55] Messiah and how we have the Messiah we
[49:58] have found the Messiah amen amen we have
[50:00] found the Messiah the Messiah for every
[50:02] age is the manifested word for that age
[50:05] amen amen so we have a present day God
[50:08] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[50:10] and forever but now I want to go into
[50:13] the effect of having the Messiah because
[50:16] many people claim to have the Messiah or
[50:18] to have Jesus he is the Messiah but what
[50:20] would he produce in the people that
[50:23] actually have him so I want to go down
[50:25] this this is where going because you got
[50:27] to really look at now we are living out
[50:30] I'm just going to throw it out there we
[50:32] read there in Joel 2 about the
[50:33] restoration that that that the Locust
[50:35] and the Palm worm the cankerworm and the
[50:37] caterpillar and you know those things
[50:40] ate away you know there was a promise of
[50:42] I will restore whatever's been lost and
[50:45] we understand that we are living in a
[50:47] time of restoration where everything
[50:51] that was lost is now being restored back
[50:53] to man we understand that man is you
[50:55] know man is being been redeemed we're
[50:57] been placed as Adam was before the fall
[51:00] having dominion over everything upon
[51:02] this Earth amen and all the powers in
[51:04] hell every Power that can be named we
[51:06] have been given dominion over it amen
[51:09] there's a time of restoration and we're
[51:10] living in that time of restoration so
[51:12] it's not a prophecy anymore but it's
[51:14] become manifested in the people this is
[51:17] where I'm going you got to look at you
[51:18] really got to look at yeah I know sister
[51:20] Vanessa put on a while ago a photo of of
[51:22] modern day woman and she said I wish I
[51:24] had a photo of what the messes produces
[51:26] I could just go like this just do a
[51:28] panning shot amen amen hallelujah you
[51:32] got to be able to put yourself in that
[51:33] picture because this message was called
[51:36] to restore a people back to their proper
[51:39] position in Christ am and so we read
[51:42] there about that a man shall be planted
[51:45] like a tree planted by the rivers plural
[51:49] of one water amen he shall be planted
[51:52] like a tree and we understand that Jesus
[51:55] we read there in Luke 1 it says behold
[51:58] the Fig Tree and all of the trees now
[52:01] he's not talking about a natural he's
[52:02] not talking about just a natural fig
[52:04] tree in all of all of the trees but we
[52:07] understand from reading the Bible you
[52:08] read in Jeremiah 24 that Jeremiah sees a
[52:11] vision of two baskets of figs and it's
[52:13] Israel you go read it the the
[52:15] interpretation is given in the in the
[52:17] you know with the vision and one part
[52:19] one basket of figs is that part of
[52:21] Israel that'll be they'll all be taken
[52:23] into captivity one part will be
[52:26] scattered to the Nations and will never
[52:27] return and the other part the other
[52:29] basket of figs will come back and dwell
[52:31] in the land and that's exactly what
[52:33] happened when Israel was taken into
[52:35] captivity some of them were scattered to
[52:36] the Four Winds of the Earth but another
[52:38] part came back into the land amen so the
[52:42] tree in the scripture speaks of a Nation
[52:44] or a people and so now there has to be
[52:47] so he's saying when you see the Fig Tree
[52:49] or when you see Israel become a nation
[52:51] again you know that summer is not even
[52:53] at the doors you know the Millennium is
[52:55] closed amen going through these things I
[52:57] want to show you the message is in the
[52:59] scripture brother Bram was a word
[53:01] Prophet so what he preached is in the
[53:03] Bible it's not outside the Bible it's
[53:06] not just his own thoughts of what he
[53:08] thought about it but you can find it in
[53:09] the scripture I mean that's why I'm
[53:12] trying I think maybe I don't know uh
[53:15] what I Endeavor to do is show what he
[53:17] preached and show it to you in the
[53:19] scripture that you have a confidence
[53:21] that he's a word Prophet am amen because
[53:24] the message is in here it reveals Christ
[53:27] in here amen but if you can't see it in
[53:30] here someone can come along with a
[53:32] phrase or an isolated statement and it
[53:34] can destabilize you but if you can see
[53:36] it in the scripture then it gives you a
[53:38] confidence that you know in whom you
[53:40] have believed because Jesus is the word
[53:43] amen so that's why I want to I I trust I
[53:46] do it all the time but that's always my
[53:47] heart's desire is that the people would
[53:49] see the message in the Bible amen that
[53:52] when people say oh you just following a
[53:53] man no we're not following a man we're
[53:55] following the reveal word of God this
[53:58] made plain yes amen and that's why we
[54:01] listen to the tapes is because it gives
[54:03] us understanding of what is written in
[54:05] this book amen it takes God always uses
[54:08] a Channel of a prophet to reveal his
[54:10] word yeah amen and so those who are
[54:14] under the effect of that ministry will
[54:16] produce what God promised for the age
[54:19] okay so if he produced if he promised a
[54:22] restoration then those that are walking
[54:24] truly walking with with God God it'll be
[54:27] manifested in their
[54:29] life amen I I I trust you don't think
[54:32] this is too pie in the sky or whatever
[54:35] phrase you want to put there but you've
[54:37] got to look at yourself you got to look
[54:39] at now this is all around the world this
[54:41] is not just in these four walls that's
[54:43] right but God has has done a restoration
[54:45] amen amen this this tree that that that
[54:48] David wrote about there in Psalms 1 you
[54:52] know you can see that it was planted on
[54:54] the day of Pentecost a fruit tree was
[54:56] planted a bride tree was planted there
[54:58] in the upper room but then what you see
[55:01] in the book of Acts you do not see in
[55:03] the dark ages why is that because the
[55:06] tree false you know the Antichrist came
[55:09] in and chewed away everything that that
[55:11] tree was till it was just a stump you
[55:13] can go see it in church history the
[55:15] Catholic Church the Lutheran Church you
[55:18] you know when God was working in those
[55:20] church is bringing a Reformation it
[55:22] wasn't it wasn't like Pentecost but it
[55:24] was growing back to become like the day
[55:26] of Pentecost amen so we we have been we
[55:30] have been restored not back to the move
[55:34] of Pentecost of zeusa street that many
[55:36] people think was was a final restoration
[55:39] but we' have been restored back to the
[55:41] same book of Acts church that you read
[55:44] about in the beginning because God had
[55:46] to give a quick demonstration to show
[55:48] this is how I work in a group of people
[55:51] amen you have you know they had Miracles
[55:54] they had healing they had Visions they
[55:57] had dreams they had prophecy they had
[55:59] prophecy for their local area agabus was
[56:02] a prophet he prophesied of the famine
[56:04] that was going to come that's why Paul
[56:05] went around and gathered up money to you
[56:07] know buy food for the church down in
[56:09] Jerusalem and those things so specific
[56:11] prophecies for there you know that that
[56:14] was what was happening in the church
[56:15] they were governed by the Holy Ghost
[56:17] amen amen but then what happened is you
[56:20] you don't get very far in the book of
[56:22] Acts I think it's acts 15 where there
[56:24] were there were people people were Jews
[56:27] and they came into the faith but they
[56:29] didn't have a real birth and they tried
[56:31] to make the church say oh you've got to
[56:33] keep the law you have to become a Jew
[56:35] then you be can become a Christian and
[56:37] it's always the light of a former age
[56:39] because that you know the Jewish law was
[56:41] was a former thing God did but then he
[56:43] fulfilled the law in Jesus Christ that
[56:45] it wasn't wasn't a bunch of ceremony
[56:47] trying to sanctify ourselves in a in a
[56:50] in a man-made way but then God came down
[56:52] into his people separated them unto
[56:54] himself and then dwelt in them amen
[56:56] hallelujah but then it was the former
[56:59] people who were Jews but didn't have a
[57:00] full conversion they came and said well
[57:03] you've really got to do these things
[57:05] because many things of the former age
[57:08] seem really good brother Braham says the
[57:10] Pentecostal move they were great
[57:12] legalists amen they're great legalists
[57:15] and you can see it that's right in other
[57:18] places where people come in it doesn't
[57:20] matter how many years they've been
[57:21] walking with the truth but but what
[57:24] they've came out of it hasn't come out
[57:25] of them
[57:27] and because it seems so holy and
[57:29] Sanctified I believe in Holiness living
[57:31] absolutely the word teaches it but then
[57:34] but then it can be so ingrained in them
[57:37] and that people are only
[57:40] satisfied if the for example of the
[57:42] brothers come in a certain TI of
[57:45] church amen now I'm not I'm not
[57:48] preaching either way because you kind
[57:50] and for say because what is this does
[57:53] this pertain to Salvation I'm uh this is
[57:56] of my notes but you know does am I a
[57:58] better Christian cuz I wear this that's
[58:00] right I wear this because I love the
[58:02] Lord and I come to respect him amen amen
[58:05] and I'm meeting the king that's just me
[58:06] but that's just me I wouldn't force that
[58:08] upon anyone but people get this idea
[58:10] from a former age oh they're in a
[58:13] certain tie they've made it that's right
[58:15] they've rarely made it but they can just
[58:17] be a wied wall that's right they can
[58:19] just be dead on the inside that's right
[58:21] amen amen that's right so but then so
[58:25] it's the former age that affects or
[58:28] tries to influence what God is doing
[58:31] because just like in the first church
[58:33] now there's a
[58:35] pattern the pattern is God placed
[58:39] manifested the church in the book of
[58:41] Acts the enemy came and chewed it down
[58:45] yes that's right then he became then it
[58:46] became nothing in in the days of the
[58:49] Dark Ages that's why it was the Dark Age
[58:51] CU God couldn't manifest himself like he
[58:53] did originally but then eventually there
[58:56] was a restoration until finally the
[59:00] bride tree the fruit tree that was
[59:01] planted there on the day of Pentecost is
[59:03] manifested again in this hour yes amen
[59:07] but then what happens now is there's a
[59:09] challenge because it's like in the
[59:10] natural you plant a tree you you know
[59:12] you make a garden there's always bugs

[1:04:21] beginning and he had those ones that
[1:04:24] already died they died under the blood
[1:04:25] of of the Lamb amen so they weren't lost
[1:04:28] that's right you with me amen but there

[1:07:48] interested in me he doesn't understand
[1:07:50] my situation that's a bunch of
[1:07:52] nonsense Hallelujah that's why Jesus God
[1:07:55] became flesh as a man is that he know
[1:07:57] what it would like to be a child you
[1:08:00] know and I've said it before but you
[1:08:02] think of a 12-year-old boy they go to

[1:08:27] normal kind of
[1:08:29] boy he wasn't a normal kind of boy he
[1:08:31] would have been made fun of in the
[1:08:33] village because for one he had the black
[1:08:36] name of oh your parents weren't even
[1:08:39] married when you were
[1:08:40] born you know he had a black name to
[1:08:42] begin with so he would have been made
[1:08:45] fun of he knew what it was like to be
[1:08:48] misunderstood you know he knew it was
[1:08:50] like to lose loved ones where's Joseph
[1:08:53] when he got old it's because Joseph died
[1:08:55] di no silent years he knows he you he
[1:08:59] knows what it's like to be rejected be
[1:09:01] made fun of be misunderstood he knows
[1:09:03] what you've what you carry that's right
[1:09:06] he understands cuz he's walked in your
[1:09:09] shoes
[1:09:11] hallelujah amen he knows what it's like
[1:09:14] to be mishandled mistreated yeah he was
[1:09:16] the Lamb of God he comes to the temple
[1:09:19] he's the one that can deliver the whole
[1:09:20] nation from their sins amen from their
[1:09:23] dead religion
[1:09:25] and they spit on his face rip out his
[1:09:27] bed if you're a prophet tell us who hit
[1:09:29] you then we'll believe you and those
[1:09:31] same ones that made that mockery came
[1:09:33] and it was Nicodemus before that says we
[1:09:35] know your a teacher comes from God
[1:09:36] because no man can do this unless God be
[1:09:38] with
[1:09:39] him he understands he's been in your
[1:09:43] shoes Hallelujah so never never let the
[1:09:45] devil light say he doesn't understand
[1:09:47] God doesn't care if he really care he
[1:09:49] deliver you he will yes amen amen but
[1:09:53] his love is elective love
[1:09:56] amen Jacob before they even born Jacob I
[1:09:58] have loved and Esa have I
[1:10:00] hated Hallelujah I've been accepted of
[1:10:04] the Beloved amen before either of them
[1:10:06] were born God said I've chosen this one
[1:10:08] I've rejected this one because he knew
[1:10:09] by four knowledge that's right
[1:10:13] amen now I am the True Vine and my
[1:10:16] father is a husbandman every branch in
[1:10:18] me that beareth not the fruit he taketh
[1:10:20] away and every branch that beareth fruit
[1:10:22] he purgeth it that it may bring forth
[1:10:25] more fruit now ye are clean through the
[1:10:27] word which I have spoken unto you abide
[1:10:30] in me and I in you as the branch cannot
[1:10:33] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[1:10:35] the vine no more can ye except ye abide
[1:10:39] in me now I'm just going to stop there
[1:10:42] because he also said Jesus said I'm
[1:10:44] going to go back to this but Jesus said
[1:10:45] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:10:47] you ask what you will and it shall be
[1:10:48] done and in the age of the Reformation
[1:10:51] the man age they there many books
[1:10:53] written abiding in Christ and you've got
[1:10:54] to pray so much and you've got to read
[1:10:56] so much and that's abiding in him now
[1:10:59] you should pray and read there should be
[1:11:01] a I know we're busy but there should be
[1:11:02] on your heart Lord I just want to I want
[1:11:04] to spend time with you Lord I'm just
[1:11:07] driving but here I am I can talk to you
[1:11:09] you can talk to me alwayss on your heart
[1:11:11] should be him first and foremost but but
[1:11:14] people begin to teach that it's it's the
[1:11:16] amount of time you spend as you abiding
[1:11:18] in his words there's a qualifier of the
[1:11:20] amount of time you spend and therefore
[1:11:22] now you can ask what you will but the
[1:11:24] true abiding in Christ is not the amount
[1:11:27] of time that you spend but it is his
[1:11:30] word remember he is his word he is a
[1:11:33] living being so if you abide in me and
[1:11:36] my word abides I abide in you so if God
[1:11:39] himself comes and steps down into you
[1:11:41] that's you that's how you abide in
[1:11:43] Christ as when God dwells in you
[1:11:45] Hallelujah I'm abiding in Christ it says
[1:11:48] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:11:50] am amen hallelujah that's how you abide
[1:11:52] in him if a man abide not not in me he
[1:11:56] cast he cast forth as a branch and it
[1:11:59] Werth I mean withth sorry and Men gather
[1:12:02] them and cast them into the fire and
[1:12:03] they are burned if you abide in me and
[1:12:05] my words abide in you here we are you
[1:12:07] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[1:12:09] done unto you here and is my father
[1:12:11] glorified that you bear much fruit so
[1:12:14] shall ye be my
[1:12:16] disciples so to abide in Christ is I
[1:12:20] mean to be part of the vine is if the
[1:12:23] life ye are the Vine
[1:12:26] I just don't want to get this mixed up
[1:12:29] ye are the
[1:12:30] Vine wait I am the vine ye are the
[1:12:32] branches I always get things back to
[1:12:34] front Okay so he is the vine and the
[1:12:37] vine puts forth a branch and the branch
[1:12:39] produces the fruit so if the life of the
[1:12:43] vine is in you it will produce a
[1:12:46] life amen I know it's very Elementary
[1:12:49] but if the life the life of the vine has
[1:12:52] to be in you and if the life of the Vine
[1:12:55] and you will produce a life all right so
[1:12:58] we
[1:13:00] know now so we know the man so the fruit
[1:13:03] just like a natural tree or you take an
[1:13:05] orange tree there is a citrus life or
[1:13:08] there's an orange life in the tree and
[1:13:10] that is manifested in the oranges yeah
[1:13:13] or or any any fruit uh giving giving
[1:13:17] tree or a Vine but what fruit did the
[1:13:20] first church have okay now we know they
[1:13:24] cast out Devils they healed the sick
[1:13:27] they raised the dead there was prophecy
[1:13:29] among them as I as I said before agabus
[1:13:31] in Acts 11 prophesying of a drought that
[1:13:34] would come and the church was directed
[1:13:36] by the Holy Ghost
[1:13:38] himself but then it's
[1:13:40] also in Acts 246 it says and they
[1:13:43] continually daily with one Accord in the
[1:13:46] temple and breaking bread from house to
[1:13:48] house did eat their meat with gladness
[1:13:50] and singleness of heart praising God and
[1:13:53] having favor with all the people people
[1:13:55] and the Lord added to the church daily
[1:13:58] such as should be saved so there was Joy
[1:14:02] I mean there was gladness and there was
[1:14:03] signlessness of heart I mean they all
[1:14:06] just one big happy family this was the
[1:14:08] first
[1:14:10] church and
[1:14:12] so and then Jesus said by this you know
[1:14:15] by I mean I think it's uh first John by
[1:14:18] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:14:20] disciples if you love one another all
[1:14:23] right so there's a manifestation of of a
[1:14:25] Divine love one between the other which
[1:14:29] is which is what the first church had
[1:14:32] okay so they didn't have clicks they
[1:14:34] didn't have a you know there was a
[1:14:36] singleness of heart am amen amen so it
[1:14:39] wasn't they didn't have none of them had
[1:14:42] a um had a desire I wish I'd see that
[1:14:45] person fall or I hope they fail in what
[1:14:47] they think God is telling them to do
[1:14:49] there's a singleness of heart saying you
[1:14:51] know we're all in this together doesn't
[1:14:53] matter if we're Jew Samaritan Greek
[1:14:56] Gentile you know whatever you know we're
[1:14:59] all in this together cuz we're all part
[1:15:00] of one body and you always see when Paul
[1:15:03] is writing he's contending against
[1:15:06] division in the church amen he is always
[1:15:09] contending against that and he's
[1:15:11] contending against like with the
[1:15:12] Galatians he was contending against the
[1:15:15] light of a former age the legalism of a
[1:15:17] former age coming in amongst the
[1:15:19] believer he was fighting these things
[1:15:22] and he told the people and in uh
[1:15:25] Galatians 5 and22 but the fruit of the
[1:15:28] spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
[1:15:32] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[1:15:35] Temperance against such there is no law
[1:15:38] so he's saying what is produced really
[1:15:41] the fruit of the spirits not the fruit
[1:15:43] of the flesh CU he because he lists all
[1:15:45] that but the Fruit of the Spirit and the
[1:15:47] believer should be love joy peace
[1:15:49] longsuffering yeah I'm just going to
[1:15:51] read again gentleness goodness Faith
[1:15:52] meekness Temperance against such there
[1:15:55] is no law so that should be that was
[1:15:58] manifested because remember Paul when
[1:16:00] he's talking about these things it
[1:16:02] wasn't just a theoretical idea it was a
[1:16:05] living reality cuz he could identify
[1:16:08] because
[1:16:08] remember he God used him to write most
[1:16:11] of the New Testament so they couldn't go
[1:16:13] back and say well let's read verse and
[1:16:16] verse and it says this here and here and
[1:16:17] here and this is how it should be they
[1:16:19] were living by inspiration cuz all they
[1:16:21] had was the Old Testament so but Paul
[1:16:24] could see
[1:16:25] because he knew it was God after
[1:16:27] searching the scriptures he knew it was
[1:16:29] God that he met on the road to Damascus
[1:16:32] and then he could begin to see the life
[1:16:34] that was being produced because that
[1:16:36] Spirit came and dwelt in the people and
[1:16:38] that's why he could write these things
[1:16:39] he said this is what it
[1:16:41] produces amen so it's not a oh that
[1:16:44] sounds nice or this is how it should be
[1:16:46] that's how it was
[1:16:50] amen so that's how it was but then I
[1:16:53] said now it went from that and then it
[1:16:57] went down into the dark CES it was just
[1:16:58] the stump of the
[1:17:00] tree because it says in Joel 1 and four
[1:17:04] it says that which the Palm worm hath
[1:17:06] left hath the Locust eaten and that
[1:17:09] which the Locust hath left has the can
[1:17:11] worm eaten and that which the canor worm
[1:17:14] hath left hath the caterpillar eaten now
[1:17:17] these bugs are all the same bug in
[1:17:18] different stages right so it is a even
[1:17:23] though I speak of natural things here
[1:17:24] here but God is really this is a
[1:17:26] prophecy now of this is what's going to
[1:17:28] happen in the seven Church ages from
[1:17:31] Pentecost down into the Dark Ages right
[1:17:34] and then we read in Chapter 2 but there
[1:17:36] would be a restoration of everything
[1:17:38] that was taken away is going to be
[1:17:40] restored
[1:17:42] Hallelujah and so now it was planted on
[1:17:45] the day of Pentecost this tree everyone
[1:17:48] was of one Accord of singleness of heart
[1:17:51] everyone had Joy love peace long
[1:17:53] suffering all those things
[1:17:55] amen they were one body walking in one
[1:17:58] Accord and then now but the
[1:18:01] enemy did not remember he hates the life
[1:18:06] he hates the life of God on display he
[1:18:08] wants to he wants us to all become
[1:18:11] grumpy bitter you know rigid dogmatic
[1:18:16] people with no love if he could that's
[1:18:18] right he would make us that way and
[1:18:21] brother Bram I think I'm jumping ahead
[1:18:22] of myself but if I can't find it it
[1:18:24] comes to M he speaks in
[1:18:28] the if I can find it he
[1:18:36] says oh yes so there an au tharan Church
[1:18:40] age he says I want to give a warning
[1:18:43] right here this is speaking of of of
[1:18:45] this age now but it's written in the
[1:18:47] thar and church age chapter in the
[1:18:49] church age book it says I want to give a
[1:18:51] warning right here it says concerning
[1:18:53] the last days that because of abounding
[1:18:56] iniquity the love of many will wax cold
[1:18:58] and the later see or last age selflove
[1:19:01] the love of material things will take
[1:19:03] place of the true love of God we need to
[1:19:05] guard against the power of sin in these
[1:19:07] last days so many are getting so hard
[1:19:11] because they haven't realized the effect
[1:19:14] of this last day spirit so he's actually
[1:19:17] talking about believers they have not
[1:19:19] recognize the effect of the spirit of
[1:19:21] the age because theyve become hard and
[1:19:24] and crusted and dogmatic in my way or
[1:19:26] the highway and this is how it should be
[1:19:28] and what's happening is now it's not the
[1:19:30] fruit tree growing anymore amen amen
[1:19:33] it's like you know brother Bram he you
[1:19:35] know he was out hunting and there was a
[1:19:36] burnover so so fire had gone through a
[1:19:38] forest and there's just these old big
[1:19:40] trunks there and it's blowing in the
[1:19:41] wind and it's just the wind would blow
[1:19:43] through the Trunks and it made a
[1:19:45] horrible sound it's like a morning sound
[1:19:47] the days of Miracles has passed and I
[1:19:50] may say and and the wind we know is the
[1:19:52] spirit and I don't I don't want to add
[1:19:54] to it but this is just me people say now
[1:19:56] there's a great Falling
[1:19:58] Away there's been a great falling away
[1:20:00] for 2,000 years amen amen there been a
[1:20:04] great falling away for 2,000 years and
[1:20:06] so people but then people make a
[1:20:07] mournful sound but what's happened the
[1:20:10] fires come through and all these are
[1:20:13] just these big old trees standing around
[1:20:15] but there's no it's just the wood yes
[1:20:18] that's right amen and a tree without
[1:20:20] leaves can't can't absorb sunlight right
[1:20:24] that's right amen you need the leaves
[1:20:26] you need the leaves to absorb the
[1:20:28] sunlight that the water that comes up
[1:20:30] through the roots now the plant can grow
[1:20:33] if you don't have leaves you're not
[1:20:35] going to get any s you you're not going
[1:20:37] to have any life in you that's right he
[1:20:39] with
[1:20:40] me but then he looked down and he saw
[1:20:43] these little seedlings growing up
[1:20:45] swaying in the
[1:20:47] breeze now we don't just we want to be
[1:20:50] fully mature Believers but I don't so in
[1:20:53] a way I don't want want to be green you
[1:20:55] know the saying oh that person's green
[1:20:57] they're inexperienced you know that
[1:20:59] saying so in a way I want to be green
[1:21:01] because green you're
[1:21:03] flexible but I want to be a a mature
[1:21:05] believer in Christ but I want to stay
[1:21:07] green Amen in that way because the more
[1:21:11] the bigger the tree the more leaves they
[1:21:13] have and the more leaves they have the
[1:21:15] more sunlight they can absorb Hallelujah
[1:21:17] I'm talking about ESO inl he with me
[1:21:20] this is what we want to absorb amen amen
[1:21:24] now so people Unfortunately they haven't
[1:21:26] realized the effect of the last day
[1:21:28] Spirit yes that's right amen and why why
[1:21:32] do people become that way it's because
[1:21:34] things come in and they pull the other
[1:21:37] way amen they pull the other way in in
[1:21:41] defense trying to hold something
[1:21:43] together and remember there's but with a
[1:21:45] road there's two ditches on either
[1:21:47] side amen so the challenge is always now
[1:21:51] when things happen to us that's right
[1:21:53] amen bad things can happen to us you
[1:21:55] know misunderstand yeah I mean among
[1:21:57] Believers bad things can happen brother
[1:22:00] so and so sister so and so can say so
[1:22:02] and so and you can do so and so you know
[1:22:05] but you can't let it have you pull the
[1:22:08] other way amen because what is stronger
[1:22:11] you say well you know there's been Winds
[1:22:14] of Doctrine come through through among
[1:22:16] the Believers over the
[1:22:18] years now the real trees I'll put no I
[1:22:23] don't know I I got to be careful before
[1:22:24] I say this don't misunderstand me but
[1:22:27] false things can come through where once
[1:22:30] was you you you take the book of Acts
[1:22:32] Church they all had sing of singleness
[1:22:34] of heart they loved each other you know
[1:22:37] the love of God was manifested among
[1:22:39] them but the enemy came in you got to be
[1:22:42] a Jew before you can become a Christian
[1:22:44] and the resurrection's passed already
[1:22:46] and all these false yeah Paul Paul
[1:22:47] writes about false doctrines and so so
[1:22:50] what would happen now things would be
[1:22:53] lost CU you know when a storm passes
[1:22:56] through the tree still there but it's
[1:22:58] maybe few lost a few
[1:23:00] branches amen and so things have been
[1:23:04] lost and then people if they've pulled
[1:23:06] the other way they can say well in the
[1:23:07] old days it wasn't this way but there's
[1:23:10] an hour of restoration friends amen if
[1:23:13] the devil's robbed us of anything we
[1:23:15] have a right to claim it back amen we
[1:23:18] have a right we can't just can't just be
[1:23:20] victims saying oh it was like this 30
[1:23:21] years ago why can't we have it now
[1:23:25] just okay but it can be like oh we had
[1:23:28] it gloriously downstairs why can't we
[1:23:30] have it
[1:23:31] here you know what I mean like we can't
[1:23:34] just look through the rearview mirror if
[1:23:36] if the devil's taken something from us
[1:23:37] we have a right to get it back amen it's
[1:23:40] like the honeymoon feeling once upon a
[1:23:42] time we had it oh but we're just years
[1:23:44] down the road you have a right to get
[1:23:45] that back amen what's a sweetheart
[1:23:48] always a sweetheart Hallelujah that's
[1:23:50] how it should be that's right so the
[1:23:52] devil's taking it from you you have a
[1:23:54] right remember a full restoration I'm
[1:23:57] not just talking about I'm down on
[1:23:59] everyone's level now am how are we doing
[1:24:01] you have a right and you should be angry
[1:24:03] at Satan if he's robbed you of anything
[1:24:06] even the joy of your salvation amen
[1:24:08] that's right amen you have a right to
[1:24:10] lay claim amen you Hallelujah you have a
[1:24:13] right so don't just sit back and say
[1:24:16] well this is just
[1:24:18] uh those days are gone who says those
[1:24:21] days are
[1:24:22] gone hallelujah amen search for it and
[1:24:25] redeem
[1:24:26] it Hallelujah
[1:24:32] now he says now the first thing so this
[1:24:36] so this enemy came in in four stages and
[1:24:39] the first thing the enemy did because
[1:24:41] there's four stages of the same bug
[1:24:42] remember we read there's in restoration
[1:24:44] of the Bride tree you do well to go and
[1:24:45] listen to it the first thing the first
[1:24:48] fruit he took off was brotherly love so
[1:24:50] the fruits of the spirit read about in
[1:24:52] Galatians the first one is love joy
[1:24:54] peace long suffering all those things so
[1:24:56] the first thing the enemy came in and
[1:24:58] took off the tree was
[1:25:00] love amen and he says that's one of the
[1:25:03] things that kills the church right there
[1:25:06] it's when when Brotherly Love Goes it
[1:25:10] kills the
[1:25:11] church
[1:25:13] amen the next fruit so love is the first
[1:25:17] fruit on the tree love joy peace long
[1:25:19] suffering goodness meekness Faith
[1:25:20] patience that right in the Holy Ghost
[1:25:23] now nine spiritual gifts with the nine
[1:25:24] fruits of the tree and so forth all
[1:25:26] right now the first he got the eating of
[1:25:29] the fruit of the tree so he says now
[1:25:31] let's picture a big tree of God's tree
[1:25:33] it's bearing nine spiritual gifts
[1:25:35] they're Healing The Sick they're
[1:25:36] speaking in tongues they're casting out
[1:25:37] Devils they're doing great works and
[1:25:40] preaching the unadulterated word of God
[1:25:42] no denomination to tie them down they're
[1:25:44] free doing a great work so in came this
[1:25:47] little old devil set up with his two
[1:25:49] horns sitting out in front like a
[1:25:51] grasshopper you know and his little old
[1:25:53] greedy teeth that's the first the pal
[1:25:55] worm he come to eat off brotherly love
[1:25:59] he said you know so and so did so and so
[1:26:01] over it so and so's church I won't
[1:26:03] believe that bunch of people see there
[1:26:05] he that's the first thing next he wanted
[1:26:08] to eat the fruit of faith faith in the
[1:26:11] word amen now look how do you know that
[1:26:15] that is the word it's been translated so
[1:26:17] many times that's right amen and can
[1:26:20] people can say say well how do you know
[1:26:22] that he is a real prophet he said this
[1:26:24] here and he said this here and he said
[1:26:26] this here I'll say this the Revelation
[1:26:28] contained in in the message is perfect
[1:26:30] amen amen and there was a dispensational
[1:26:33] change brother Ram said when the seals
[1:26:35] opened the Bible became a new book to
[1:26:38] him amen so there's a because remember
[1:26:41] the message when we listen to it it
[1:26:43] unfolds to us but you got to remember it
[1:26:45] unfolded to the prophet because prophets
[1:26:48] don't know everything just like the
[1:26:50] shunamite woman you know her son was you
[1:26:52] know got Sun struggles hang in the the
[1:26:54] field and and and was dead and she said
[1:26:57] settle me settle me a mule I got to go
[1:26:59] to the prophet and then gazi sees the
[1:27:02] shunamite woman coming and says to the
[1:27:03] prophet I think it's Elisha here comes
[1:27:05] the shite woman he didn't know what was
[1:27:07] going
[1:27:08] on so the word unfolded to the prophet
[1:27:12] as much as it unfolds to you that's
[1:27:13] right amen amen and as the word
[1:27:17] progresses then all of the falsehood
[1:27:20] goes and the truth comes
[1:27:22] in amen
[1:27:24] but people will take isolated statements
[1:27:26] and say he said this here he said this
[1:27:28] here it's the V it's someone's voice you
[1:27:31] got to remember there's a man part and
[1:27:33] then there's the
[1:27:34] office amen if you took every word I
[1:27:38] said I wouldn't take every word I said
[1:27:40] cuz I stut around I say things back to
[1:27:43] front is this okay take it's like
[1:27:46] brother R said it's like a Dutchman or I
[1:27:48] can't remember what nationality says
[1:27:49] take what I say and not what I mean yeah
[1:27:53] amen he said about the you know you know
[1:27:55] you on the preaching of the seals and he
[1:27:57] said about the 700 uh 700 hadn't bowed
[1:28:01] their knee to bail you know in the days
[1:28:03] of of of Elijah of course it's 7,000 and
[1:28:07] people thinking that he's he's actually
[1:28:08] correcting the Bible or did you mean 700
[1:28:10] 7 he said of course I meant
[1:28:13] 7,000 that's it's just that you know his
[1:28:15] mind is on other things right but God
[1:28:17] protects those things you got to
[1:28:20] understand it but people take quotes and
[1:28:22] all the they don't they paint a picture
[1:28:25] that's
[1:28:26] wrong amen and the enemy uses that as
[1:28:30] well I hope that's
[1:28:33] okay but the Revelation contained in it
[1:28:36] is perfect and I would if you think well
[1:28:38] that's just his advice people came to
[1:28:41] John the Baptist and said what should I
[1:28:42] do soldiers what should I do do violence
[1:28:44] to no man be content with your wages
[1:28:46] said you so they just asked for his
[1:28:48] opinion what they consider but then they
[1:28:50] took it as now this is God's Prophet
[1:28:51] speaking I'll take it on board amen so
[1:28:54] whenever people just think well that's
[1:28:56] just brother bram's opinion well I would
[1:28:57] rather do what those people did to John
[1:28:59] the Baptist and actually took it I'm
[1:29:01] going to do what he
[1:29:02] said amen and you'll find what he said
[1:29:05] in the Bible anyway now Faith in the
[1:29:08] word that's that devil still eating the
[1:29:11] words been translated so many times this
[1:29:13] and
[1:29:14] that
[1:29:15] amen and he says what's another fruit
[1:29:18] I'm just going to read so I'm going to
[1:29:19] read a big portion of this but what's
[1:29:21] another fruit Joy of salvation the enemy
[1:29:24] comes and tries to eat away our joy of
[1:29:27] Salvation he says you people make too
[1:29:29] much noise someone asked brother Bram
[1:29:32] how can you a woman one time how can you
[1:29:34] preach with all this noise people are
[1:29:35] crying all these things he said if they
[1:29:37] didn't do that how could he preach he
[1:29:39] says it's like a skunk dog it's like a
[1:29:42] dog called fritz or whatever it's called
[1:29:43] you know you the worst thing you the dog
[1:29:45] was scared of a skunk but then all the
[1:29:48] owners did is have they sick him boy
[1:29:49] sick him and the dog will get right in
[1:29:51] and get him hallelujah it's like someone
[1:29:53] says amen he I mean sick him hey we got
[1:29:56] a devil to tree and once we tree him
[1:29:58] we're going to hang him Hallelujah so
[1:30:00] you know he's saying if people will
[1:30:02] quiet he said well there would be
[1:30:03] something wrong why CU there show there
[1:30:05] should be a joy you know brother Billy
[1:30:07] Paul brandham he gave the testimony in
[1:30:09] Bram Tabernacle of of his life you know
[1:30:11] with you know with brother Braham and
[1:30:12] everything he said there was a woman in
[1:30:14] the Tabernacle and she would have her
[1:30:16] purse and his brother was preaching she'
[1:30:18] begin to swing it around and around and
[1:30:20] she'd let it go across the church as
[1:30:23] he's preaching cuz she's so
[1:30:25] happy now there's no record that I've
[1:30:27] heard that she ever got rebuked for
[1:30:29] that but there was Joy of Salvation
[1:30:33] people were happy we should be happy all
[1:30:35] the time amen we have we're free hallah
[1:30:39] we're free indeed amen we're not bound

[1:31:38] well now this one says you're not saved
[1:31:40] if you go there you have to join our
[1:31:42] church to be saved now I'm going to I'm
[1:31:44] going to bring it down home if people
[1:31:46] say oh you don't see what I see in the
[1:31:48] message you you don't have
[1:31:50] it you got to recite my Creed right cuz
[1:31:54] some people think you got to stand up
[1:31:55] and say I believe that Jesus died on the
[1:31:58] cross for me I believe Malachi 4 was
[1:32:00] fulfilled in the life and Ministry of
[1:32:02] William Bram I believe the seals are
[1:32:04] open I believe you know it's just a
[1:32:06] Creed it becomes a saying right he

[1:32:10] things you understand but it but it
[1:32:12] become people just you know match oh is
[1:32:14] this person really in because if they
[1:32:16] see these things now I've come to a
[1:32:18] place remember Jesus spoke of the

[1:37:59] the leaves might as well be sitting in
[1:38:01] the sun there ain't no cooling there all
[1:38:03] right but you know what we're supposed
[1:38:05] to do the Bible said the predestinated
[1:38:07] church the predestinated sons of God
[1:38:09] what would they do set in Heavenly
[1:38:11] places what is that coolness Comfort
[1:38:13] feel at home
[1:38:15] amen
[1:38:16] amen and he says now he also says in
[1:38:20] God's provide uh this is in God's
[1:38:22] providing healing for this generation in
[1:38:25] 1954 what's the matter with the church
[1:38:27] today the water supply is cut off
[1:38:29] because of our grumbling and doubting if
[1:38:32] you'll go into a desert you'll find that
[1:38:35] every Bush that you come up against
[1:38:37] still will perhaps have thorns and and
[1:38:39] stickers on it because it's raised in a
[1:38:41] dry land without water you take that
[1:38:44] same variety of bush and put it in a
[1:38:46] moisture land of moisture it'll be soft
[1:38:48] because it gets plenty of water and you
[1:38:50] take a church that's always fussing and
[1:38:52] stewing about this days of Miracles has
[1:38:55] passed just remember they're in a desert
[1:38:57] and out of the water and a church that's
[1:39:00] loving and humble and flexible and feels
[1:39:03] and goes with the word of God remember
[1:39:05] they're living by the fountain that
[1:39:06] never runs dry David said blessed is the
[1:39:09] man whose trust is in the Lord sth not
[1:39:12] in the seat of the scornful walketh not
[1:39:14] in the way of Sinners but his Delight is
[1:39:16] in the law of the Lord he shall be like
[1:39:18] a tree that's planted by the rivers of
[1:39:19] water see whatever he doeth it shall
[1:39:22] prosper his leaves shall will not fail
[1:39:24] he will bring forth his fruit in
[1:39:28] season amen amen
[1:39:31] so th this is what happens am I know
[1:39:35] it's a lot of negative but I trust you
[1:39:36] can see the positive amen amen as well
[1:39:40] so now there
[1:39:42] was and then he goes into
[1:39:45] the he
[1:39:47] says um and then also God identifying
[1:39:50] himself by his characterist
[1:39:52] characteristics in 64
[1:39:53] so may the Lord water us tonight that we
[1:39:56] won't be stickers but we'll be fine
[1:39:58] leaves that waywood people might sit
[1:40:00] down under the tree of our shade and
[1:40:02] find rest to their souls I say Amen then
[1:40:05] he got into the bark which is the
[1:40:08] doctrine that's the next stage of The Bu
[1:40:10] and ate all the doctrine away and he
[1:40:14] substituted see the cankerworm got into
[1:40:16] the bark what did it do destroy the bark
[1:40:18] what did it do it made a natural church
[1:40:21] for a spiritual church amen so it made a
[1:40:25] instead of having a supernatural birth
[1:40:27] it just became a natural thing of of
[1:40:29] mentally agreeing to a list of that's
[1:40:32] right list of Doctrine that's that that
[1:40:35] is supplanting a spiritual for a
[1:40:37] natural amen the message has never
[1:40:39] really come to change your thinking only
[1:40:41] but it's come to change your heart amen
[1:40:44] that's what God has always wanted to do
[1:40:46] yes it took away the true and gave it a
[1:40:48] false now remember the leaf the fruit
[1:40:50] the Palm will eat the leaf the Locust
[1:40:52] eat now the bark covering the religion
[1:40:54] the doctrine the cankerworm got what
[1:40:57] what where did that first Doctrine come
[1:40:59] outside the Bible he says you historians
[1:41:01] know where it came from from Rome that's
[1:41:03] exactly where it started where they
[1:41:05] started accepting dogmas I mean that's
[1:41:07] how irus St Mar and polyup all them
[1:41:10] after John's death for translating the
[1:41:12] word of God he is out in the aisle of
[1:41:13] Patmos they burned him in Greece for 24
[1:41:16] hours brought back and he still wrote
[1:41:18] the Bible God was determined that his
[1:41:20] Bible would be written
[1:41:23] amen and then the next and then the next
[1:41:26] stage is of course after you get into
[1:41:28] the bark you get into the sap line so
[1:41:30] you suck the life out of the
[1:41:32] tree
[1:41:34] amen now what's the caterpillar he's a
[1:41:37] sucker sucks the life the spirit the
[1:41:39] life that's what he does goes right down
[1:41:41] a hold of the pulk and goes to sucking
[1:41:43] caterpillar here he is who who are we
[1:41:46] going to call him denomination that's
[1:41:48] the guy's name right there why he's a
[1:41:50] destroyer sucks the life every time that
[1:41:53] God sends a move among his people every
[1:41:55] time and they denominate right there
[1:41:57] they die I want somebody that knows the
[1:41:59] history of the church that can condemn
[1:42:01] that show me one time that an
[1:42:03] organization ever organized that it
[1:42:05] didn't die right there that cankerworm
[1:42:07] got a hold of it took its religion away
[1:42:10] and then the sucker came along and
[1:42:12] sucked the life right out of the tree
[1:42:15] what kind of life was in it the Holy
[1:42:16] Spirit what did it do it couldn't hold
[1:42:19] the holy spirit in there and then still
[1:42:22] have dogmas the Holy Spirit wouldn't
[1:42:23] stand for it am mean so it take the take
[1:42:26] the life out of the tree and gives it
[1:42:28] Dogma makes a denomination we don't care
[1:42:30] what this says our denomination says
[1:42:32] this there you are remember after it
[1:42:34] denominates it always dies and never
[1:42:36] rises again
[1:42:39] amen but now there are four stages of
[1:42:42] the same bug that brought it down into
[1:42:45] the Dark
[1:42:46] Ages but there's also four messengers of
[1:42:49] life that were sent to restore back the
[1:42:53] tree okay so Luther started the
[1:42:57] restoration amen and it started to grow
[1:42:59] a bit more like Pentecost and then
[1:43:01] Wesley you know so Luther we know he
[1:43:03] brought that just shall live by faith
[1:43:05] that was his teaching and then Wesley
[1:43:08] received that because Wesley was
[1:43:10] actually he heard uh
[1:43:13] Luther's um Luther's writings on the
[1:43:15] book of Romans and it said he said he
[1:43:17] felt a warming in his heart he's
[1:43:19] actually birthed by the message of the
[1:43:21] former age it's in history
[1:43:23] amen and then Wesley brought
[1:43:25] sanctification and then of course
[1:43:27] Pentecost brought the restoration of the
[1:43:29] gifts but then the the word came the
[1:43:32] message came which is the final part of
[1:43:34] the restoration amen so it's four bugs
[1:43:37] because remember through Luther Wesley
[1:43:39] Pentecost and and the ministry of
[1:43:41] brother brandham it's the Holy Spirit
[1:43:43] doing all the same thing just like the
[1:43:45] four bugs that destroyed the tree it's
[1:43:47] all the same Antichrist Spirit just in
[1:43:49] different stages amen and this is the
[1:43:51] same as the fourth stage stes of
[1:43:53] ezekiel's dry bones all right and so the
[1:43:58] four stages of ezekiel's dry bones I'm
[1:44:00] going to I'm going to wrap this up soon
[1:44:02] so just just hold on now Ezekiel 37 it
[1:44:06] says the hand of the Lord was upon me
[1:44:07] and carried me out in the spirit of the
[1:44:09] Lord and set me down in the midst of the
[1:44:11] valley which was full of Bones and
[1:44:13] caused me to pass by them round about
[1:44:15] and behold there were uh very many in
[1:44:18] the open Valley and lo they were very
[1:44:20] dry and he said unto me son of man can
[1:44:22] these bones live and I answered oh Lord
[1:44:24] God thou knowest and again he said unto
[1:44:27] me prophesy upon these bones and say
[1:44:29] unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word
[1:44:31] of the Lord thus sayith the Lord God
[1:44:33] unto these bones behold I will cause
[1:44:36] breath to enter into you and you shall
[1:44:38] live and I'll lay senu upon you and
[1:44:41] shall bring forth flesh upon you so sinu
[1:44:44] flesh and cover you with skin and put
[1:44:46] breath unto you through there four
[1:44:48] stages and you shall live and you shall
[1:44:50] know that I am the Lord so I prophesied
[1:44:52] as I was commanded and as I prophesied
[1:44:54] there was a noise and behold it shaking
[1:44:56] and the bones came together bone to his
[1:44:57] bone and then I heard though the senu
[1:45:00] and the flesh Came Upon them and the
[1:45:01] skin covered them but there was no
[1:45:04] breath in them so there's no life in
[1:45:05] them right then he said unto me prophesy
[1:45:09] unto the wind prophesy son of man and
[1:45:12] say to the wind thus say the Lord God
[1:45:14] come from the Four Winds o breath and
[1:45:16] breathe upon the slaying and they may
[1:45:19] live so I prophesied as he commanded me
[1:45:22] and the breath came into them and they
[1:45:23] lived and they stood up upon their feet
[1:45:25] an exceeding great Army amen so see it
[1:45:30] took it took the prophet to say you know
[1:45:32] to command the life to come into the
[1:45:34] people so the word that he released
[1:45:36] brought a life into them amen that's the
[1:45:38] say and then brother bam says he you
[1:45:40] know he goes to the scripture and the
[1:45:41] end of restoration of the bride bride
[1:45:42] tree he says I wish I had time and he
[1:45:45] and he mentions he says but prophesy son
[1:45:47] of man so what's happening now a prophet
[1:45:49] was upon the earth now this is this is
[1:45:52] not in the sky because you've got to
[1:45:54] look at your life and look at us as a
[1:45:57] body and it's around the world too I
[1:45:59] always want to emphasize that cuz we
[1:46:01] don't have anything special it's all
[1:46:03] around the world doesn't matter every
[1:46:05] Kindred nation and tongue God is dealing
[1:46:08] and it's not just here in this nation
[1:46:09] it's all over the nation you got to
[1:46:11] understand that too but you got to see
[1:46:13] now what is being
[1:46:15] produced amen there's there's there's
[1:46:18] love amen there's brotherly love there's
[1:46:21] the fruits of the spirit on display amen
[1:46:23] there's Divine Fellowship amen amen the
[1:46:25] truth of the word is being restored
[1:46:28] there's a holy spirit
[1:46:29] moving that's right Hallelujah do you
[1:46:31] not see these things happening Among Us
[1:46:33] amen amen and this is all because God
[1:46:36] placed a messenger in the age and he was
[1:46:39] commanded to speak the word that's right
[1:46:41] amen but Jesus said the words I speak to
[1:46:43] you they are spirit and they are life
[1:46:45] amen so there's a life that's connected
[1:46:47] with that word amen so when he when he
[1:46:50] when he's speaking it now there's a life
[1:46:52] of God followed those words and when
[1:46:54] they anchored into a heart of faith it
[1:46:56] produces what the word says it would
[1:46:58] produce Hallelujah so we're not just a
[1:47:01] bunch of dead corpses upon the Earth but
[1:47:03] we're a living people amen life Jesus
[1:47:06] Remember the last part of God's creation
[1:47:09] is when he actually made a body well
[1:47:11] well actually he created man as a spirit
[1:47:14] then he formed the body Out of the Dust
[1:47:16] of the earth then he breathed into him
[1:47:17] he became a living Soul Jesus comes to
[1:47:19] the end of his ministry and he breathes
[1:47:21] on them receed the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:47:26] amen and then our God has come down that
[1:47:28] was that was before Pentecost just
[1:47:30] before Pentecost is about to ascend then
[1:47:32] pour His Spirit out he comes down to the
[1:47:34] end of the ages are he following me he
[1:47:37] comes down to the end of the ages he
[1:47:39] puts a prophet upon the Earth amen he
[1:47:41] speak to the wind not talking about
[1:47:43] natural wind talking about the spirit of
[1:47:45] God he speaks a word that the spirit of
[1:47:47] God come and dwell in a people that's
[1:47:49] right Hallelujah some of you looking at
[1:47:52] me like what are you talking talking
[1:47:53] about you got to look at your life what
[1:47:56] is being produced what is the effect of
[1:47:59] having
[1:48:00] Messiah I mean what's the effect we're
[1:48:02] going to look at the effect Hallelujah
[1:48:06] and the effect is very
[1:48:07] simple what was there on Pentecost is
[1:48:10] back again amen the same life Hallelujah
[1:48:15] the same things being done the same
[1:48:17] fruit of the spirit being produced amen
[1:48:19] hallelujah hallelujah here we are
[1:48:26] hallelujah amen he said prophesy son of
[1:48:29] man and we just read that he said
[1:48:32] prophesy into the wind prophesy son of
[1:48:34] man he
[1:48:36] spoke the wind came into and he stood up
[1:48:39] as exceedingly great

[1:49:04] great Army amen God just little bitty

[1:49:10] is an ambassador for
[1:49:12] heaven hallelujah amen you like you take
[1:49:15] the Ambassador from the United States
[1:49:16] they walk in there like they own some
[1:49:19] countries they're not afraid I'm the
[1:49:22] ambassador to the United
[1:49:24] States whatever you know but they they
[1:49:27] don't go on their all timid cuz they
[1:49:28] know they've got a lot of weight that's
[1:49:30] right they got a lot of power behind
[1:49:32] them and the President says I give you
[1:49:34] this office and you can go execute what
[1:49:36] I say to do Hallelujah and here you are
[1:49:39] a bride of Christ God's given you an
[1:49:41] office amen he says now I I'll put my
[1:49:43] word in you you can execute what I say I
[1:49:46] want
[1:49:47] done
[1:49:50] hallelujah amen
[1:49:52] who have the musicians to come you got
[1:49:55] to no honestly I'll be pondering
[1:49:57] this who have the musicians come you got
[1:50:00] to you got to look this is what God is
[1:50:02] doing amen amen wear a brnch of fruit
[1:50:06] trees amen hallelujah the brid tree he
[1:50:10] preaches a sermon the restoration of the
[1:50:12] brid tree it's not just oh I'll find a
[1:50:15] you know a prophet when he declares
[1:50:16] things there's a reason he preaches
[1:50:18] things in a certain
[1:50:19] order amen he's not just thinking oh
[1:50:23] let's think of a cool sermon I can
[1:50:24] preach it will make the people happy
[1:50:26] he's declaring certain things amen and
[1:50:29] he says now is now the bride tree is
[1:50:32] restored Hallelujah and you happen to be
[1:50:36] manifesting I trust you are in your life
[1:50:40] you are living out you're living it out
[1:50:43] amen you could say we could say this
[1:50:46] day I trust I'm not too bold in saying
[1:50:48] it but this day this scripture is
[1:50:50] fulfilled amen amen because it says as
[1:50:53] you see Israel come forth and all the
[1:50:55] trees and many people they look at all
[1:50:57] there's there's National life people you
[1:51:00] you know they see the Fig Tree come
[1:51:02] forth Israel people's rights have come
[1:51:05] forth One World government's coming
[1:51:06] forth you know all these different
[1:51:08] things but they forget about the real
[1:51:10] tree that God is caring about amen
[1:51:13] because remember when when we come to
[1:51:16] opposite when the when the brid tree
[1:51:18] fully manifests and is taken off the
[1:51:21] Earth then the gospel's given to the
[1:51:23] Jews so it's just like brother brandham
[1:51:25] he's commissioned to take the two signs
[1:51:27] of healing to the world which would
[1:51:30] initiate the coming of Christ you know
[1:51:33] it would initiate the
[1:51:35] Rapture at the same time Israel says
[1:51:37] We're a nation we're an independent
[1:51:38] nation What's Happening Now Jews are
[1:51:41] coming to their position the trees is
[1:51:43] growing here comes a here comes a
[1:51:45] prophet messenger that knows the mind of
[1:51:48] God back parts of God's mind is I'm
[1:51:50] going to tell you what it is Christ The
[1:51:52] Mystery of God revealed and it's more
[1:51:54] than sermons a life is being
[1:51:56] released Hallelujah am to produce a
[1:51:58] people amen amen and here we are he says
[1:52:03] now it's harvest season he says the seed
[1:52:05] the grain is here amen amen he's talking
[1:52:08] about you he says because you know he
[1:52:11] said all the former moves of God they
[1:52:12] were moves of God but it's just the
[1:52:14] carrier of the life and then now it goes
[1:52:16] from a Carri now it comes to the very
[1:52:18] life that was planted amen he says you
[1:52:21] are the grain is here
[1:52:23] amen amen hallelujah and I trust you can
[1:52:25] look at yourself and say I'm
[1:52:27] grein Hallelujah I trust you can say God
[1:52:31] you've made me grain you can't be
[1:52:32] anything you you know a tear cannot make
[1:52:35] itself
[1:52:36] grain Hallelujah and a grain can't make
[1:52:38] itself a tear am Hallelujah it can't we
[1:52:42] can't make ourselves anything else I
[1:52:44] trust this mean something to you friends
[1:52:46] I mean you can look into the word say
[1:52:48] God you've made me this doesn't matter
[1:52:50] how I feel doesn't matter how happy I am
[1:52:52] am doesn't matter what is oppressing me
[1:52:54] or trying to depress me or destroy me
[1:52:56] I'm green hallelujah
[1:52:59] hallelujah here we are no we this is not
[1:53:03] proud if we brother BR said if the bride
[1:53:05] really knew what God really did she' be
[1:53:07] on her knees day night crying out saying
[1:53:10] thank you Jesus
[1:53:12] Hallelujah doesn't make you proud the
[1:53:15] devil doesn't want you to know who you
[1:53:16] are but God wants to know exactly who
[1:53:19] you are Hallelujah
[1:53:22] amen now brother Braham says he he he
[1:53:25] says it in a few places is totally off
[1:53:27] the
[1:53:28] side but he would people would come
[1:53:31] forward now in prayer you know for
[1:53:33] prayer and they'd give their
[1:53:35] lives and he says I present you as love
[1:53:39] gifts in the name of Jesus
[1:53:42] Christ and then he says I give you every
[1:53:46] one of them Father the trophies of the
[1:53:49] message their love gifts from God to his
[1:53:52] son now this is you this is you all
[1:53:56] right I give you every one of them
[1:53:57] Father trophies of the message their
[1:53:59] love gifts from God to his son Jesus
[1:54:02] Christ and no man can come to me except
[1:54:04] my father draws him and all that the
[1:54:06] father has given me will come to me and
[1:54:09] I'll raise them up in the last days you
[1:54:11] promised it Christ I claim it for them I
[1:54:13] claim your word for them so he's saying
[1:54:15] that these people he says he says these
[1:54:17] are this is what this is how God looks
[1:54:20] at
[1:54:21] you and amen there's probably a whole
[1:54:23] other sermon but this is how God looks
[1:54:24] at you you're a love
[1:54:27] gift Hallelujah you're not just some
[1:54:29] shabby thing this is this is you know if
[1:54:32] I could put it we know there's only one
[1:54:34] God but you put it dramatizing here's
[1:54:36] the father what can I give my son I love
[1:54:38] my son he's the apple of my eye what can
[1:54:41] I give him give him a wife Hallelujah
[1:54:45] give him a part of himself that he'll
[1:54:47] love like I love him but even more so
[1:54:50] cuz they're part of each other hallah so
[1:54:52] searches the earth I mean he's looking
[1:54:54] for love gifts like you go you go to the
[1:54:56] shop you buy a gift for someone you're
[1:54:57] looking for something that they will
[1:54:58] really like Hallelujah so he searches
[1:55:01] the Earth doesn't matter what chop
[1:55:03] they're in where they're born what they
[1:55:05] look like H says down in them there's a
[1:55:08] love gift and he Broods over you lifts
[1:55:11] you up and says here you are here you
[1:55:13] are son Hallelujah I thought of you when
[1:55:15] I found them amen hallelujah amen amen
[1:55:20] amen hallelujah that's what God thinks
[1:55:23] of you doesn't matter what any mortal
[1:55:25] man or whoever it is thinks of you
[1:55:27] that's what God says about you that's
[1:55:29] right Hallelujah that's why you've been
[1:55:31] drawn that's why you've been called am
[1:55:34] mean because no man can come to me
[1:55:35] unless my father draws him and there's
[1:55:37] been a pull Hallelujah more than just a
[1:55:40] religion God has been pulling why cuz he
[1:55:42] say I see a love gift I'm pulling my
[1:55:44] love gifts
[1:55:46] hallelujah hallelujah and that's who you
[1:55:49] are Hallelujah I'm very move friends but
[1:55:52] that's what that is what God is looking
[1:55:53] for he's not looking for a bunch of
[1:55:55] religious people some people that they
[1:55:57] can just have some kind of different
[1:55:59] life where's my love gifts I want those
[1:56:02] ones I love Hallelujah I want to embrace
