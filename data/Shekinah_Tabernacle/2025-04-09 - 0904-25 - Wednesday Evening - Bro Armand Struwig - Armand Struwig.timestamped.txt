[3:00] Praise the Lord. God bless you all this
[3:03] evening. Good to be here. It's good to
[3:06] be
[3:07] um have a chance to worship the Lord on
[3:10] our Wednesday evening.
[3:12] Feeling good. Ready to feeling
[3:15] refreshed. Feeling like energized from
[3:18] the day.
[3:20] I was just I just was thinking of a
[3:23] quote um
[3:25] from um Charles Splurgeon actually
[3:31] Spurgeon
[3:33] Spurgeon and it said
[3:36] um God uses failures God uses people who
[3:40] fail because that's the only kind that
[3:42] there
[3:44] is and when you think about it you know
[3:47] he uses failures and sinners and all
[3:49] that because that's all that he's got to
[3:50] work
[3:51] with. So if you don't feel if you feel
[3:54] you're inadequate, join the bunch of the
[3:56] rest of
[3:57] humanity. Here we
[3:58] [Music]
[4:00] are. But you know, we're not depending
[4:02] on us. We're depending on him. We we
[4:05] don't depend on how good we are. We
[4:06] depend on how good he is. You know that
[4:08] this whole walk never depends on us. It
[4:11] was just on us to receive it. So let's
[4:13] just um stand this evening and just
[4:14] receive what the Lord has for us
[4:16] tonight. We're going to worship. We're
[4:17] going to praise. We're going to just
[4:18] enter in and we're going to be refreshed
[4:21] and filled with the spirit of God and
[4:23] and the word of God is going to speak to
[4:25] our hearts this evening and it's going
[4:27] to be a supernatural experience. That's
[4:28] the that's what's going to happen this
[4:30] evening. So, let's just commit this time
[4:31] to the Lord. Lord Jesus, we're so happy
[4:34] that we can come to you tonight, Lord,
[4:35] as brethren, Lord, and already feel your
[4:37] presence amongst us, Lord, where you
[4:39] said we two or three gathered in your
[4:40] name there are in the midst. So, we just
[4:43] thank you for meeting here with us this
[4:44] evening, Lord. Lord, and we just pray
[4:46] you bless this time. May you just anoint
[4:48] the service in a powerful way, Lord. May
[4:50] your spirit just fill this place, Lord,
[4:52] as it did in the book of Acts, Lord.
[4:54] When the disciples prayed, the building
[4:55] shook, Lord. May we have that sort of an
[4:57] experience here, Lord. Will you just
[4:58] come down and visit us in a powerful way
[5:01] this evening, Lord, may each heart be
[5:02] open to receive you, Lord, and to
[5:04] receive your word and just enter in this
[5:06] evening. Forgive us of every sin, Lord.
[5:07] And we just want to lay aside every
[5:09] weight, Lord, that easily besets us and
[5:10] just enter into your throne room this
[5:12] evening, Lord, knowing that you have
[5:14] made us worthy, Lord. We don't depend on
[5:16] us, but we we're so thankful, Lord, that
[5:18] that we depend on your shed blood, Lord,
[5:21] and your the way that you made for us,

[19:23] son
[19:27] to his
[19:30] child. He
[19:34] reconciled and parted
[19:40] from love of God. The love of
[19:45] God, how rich and
[19:48] good, how
[19:52] measulate and strong.
[19:57] It shall
[20:00] forever
[20:03] endure the saints and
[20:07] end
[20:10] there. 10 years of
[20:13] time shall pass
[20:17] away and earth be
[20:21] thrown and kingdoms
[20:23] [Music]
[20:24] fall when men
[20:28] go refuse to
[20:31] pray on rocks and
[20:35] hills and mountains. God's love so sure.
[20:40] God's love so
[20:42] sure shall still endure.
[20:47] All
[20:50] measureless and
[20:53] strong redeeming
[20:57] grace to Adam's grace.
[21:06] Saint, oh love of God, oh love of
[21:11] God, how rich and
[21:15] good, how
[21:19] measureless and strong.
[21:24] It shall
[21:26] forever more
[21:30] endure the saints
[21:34] and
[21:37] there could we with
[21:39] [Music]
[21:41] thee the ocean
[21:45] filled and were the
[21:49] sky of parchment
[21:53] Day where every
[21:57] store on earth the
[22:01] queen and every man
[22:07] prescribed by to write the love to write
[22:12] the
[22:14] love of God
[22:18] above would drain We
[22:22] all shed
[22:26] dry. Nor could the
[22:30] swirl contain
[22:34] no stretch from
[22:39] sky. Oh love of God. Oh love of God.
[22:46] How rich and
[22:49] good, how
[22:54] measureless and strong.
[22:56] [Music]
[22:58] It shall
[23:01] forever more
[23:05] endure the saints and end.
[23:13] Oh love of
[23:16] God, how rich and
[23:20] good, how
[23:22] me, how
[23:24] visionless and strong.
[23:29] It shall
[23:32] forever more
[23:35] endure. The saints and
[23:41] angels
[23:43] saw how great was that
[23:45] love. We were lost in sin, all far
[23:49] separated from God.
[23:52] He came down, became one of us, felt our
[23:56] pain, felt everything that we're going
[23:58] through, suffered like no man should
[24:00] have suffered just for me and
[24:03] you. 2,000 years later, we stand here as
[24:06] trophies to his
[24:08] kingdom. One man gave it all for us. So,
[24:13] let us give all to him tonight. Let's
[24:15] just bow in a word of prayer. Gracious
[24:17] heavenly father, if it wasn't for you,
[24:20] Father, where would we be? We just thank
[24:22] you tonight, Lord, that you took the
[24:25] time, Lord, you became a man, born in a
[24:28] manger, little baby. Father, anybody
[24:32] could have ended your life there, but
[24:33] prophecies needed to be fulfilled. You
[24:36] had to buy back what Adam lost. You paid
[24:39] dearly for it, Father. And we thank you
[24:42] for that great sacrifice for us, Lord.
[24:44] May your blood cover us all, Lord. And
[24:47] may we really accept Easter as it's
[24:49] coming forth, Lord. We all start
[24:51] thinking about not bunnies, Lord. Not
[24:54] little chocolate eggs, Father, but we
[24:56] really start thinking about what you've
[24:57] done for us. How great and how
[25:00] measurless your love and how strong you
[25:02] are, Father, that could reach down
[25:04] through every circumstance, wherever we
[25:07] were in the muck and miry clay. Lord,
[25:09] you came down and you took us out and
[25:12] you cleaned us up, Lord. Yes, it's a
[25:14] work in progress, my father, but you are
[25:16] great. And you said all that you have
[25:18] started, you shall finish. Father, we
[25:21] welcome you in. We ask, Lord, those ones
[25:24] that's sick and can't make it here
[25:26] tonight, Lord. We pray that you would be
[25:28] their healer tonight. The ones that by
[25:30] circumstance can't be here, Lord, we ask
[25:32] that you'll be their provider, Lord. And
[25:35] the ones that just don't have it in them
[25:37] at the moment and they just maybe going
[25:39] through a rough time, Lord. May you be
[25:40] their comfort, Father, for you on to
[25:43] display your attributes to us. And we
[25:45] ask that you would do that in the
[25:46] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[25:48] We invite you in tonight, Lord. Amen.
[25:51] And amen, we ask. Amen. Hallelujah.
[25:55] Sister Hannah, I see your
[25:57] back. This is weird. Every time I'm
[26:00] here, Sister Hannah is
[26:02] here. Amen. Thank you, musicians. You
[26:05] may be seated. You guys can stand. Or
[26:07] maybe go take your stand. So, I don't
[26:09] know what you say there. We're going to
[26:11] go tonight to Matthew 5. So, all get
[26:14] your Bibles open there to Matthew 5.
[26:17] I'll try not to keep you guys long
[26:19] tonight. I know it's a midweek special,
[26:22] but I thought we just have a bit of
[26:24] a something that the Lord laid upon my
[26:27] heart. And uh always uncomfortable to
[26:29] stand here. Never think
[26:32] um it's an easy job.
[26:38] I want to speak tonight on thy speech
[26:41] betrayeth
[26:43] thee. Very powerful little thing we have
[26:46] is this thing called the
[26:49] tongue. Gets me in and out of trouble
[26:51] and back into trouble very quickly. But
[26:54] I don't want to go too much down that. I
[26:55] just want to encourage you that there is
[26:57] a greater a greater plan that God has
[27:00] for us. And if you're a believer, guess
[27:02] what? your speech betrayeth
[27:05] you. No matter where you go, they know
[27:08] you're a believer. You don't have to
[27:09] worry about that. They know you won. And
[27:12] uh if you're unbeliever, guess what?
[27:14] Your speech betrayer for you. That's the
[27:16] end of the sermon. We can go home now.
[27:18] No, I'm joking. Hallelujah. So, let's go
[27:20] there to Matthew. So Jesus goes and I
[27:24] want to go a little bit back and uh
[27:28] Jesus goes up into the mount but before
[27:30] he goes up into the mount he does
[27:33] miracles and uh it's just the healing
[27:35] ministry of Jesus and and there where
[27:37] the miracles are there's a lot of people
[27:39] there's a lot of things going on and so
[27:42] if you see the multitudes behind them no
[27:44] that's not grass that's actually people
[27:46] because to get to the the biatitudes
[27:48] which he's going to give and brother
[27:49] Isaac wrote such a nice song about
[27:52] There was a many of people that followed
[27:53] him here. So I'll just go a little bit
[27:56] back just for it. Says, "And they
[27:58] followed him a great multitude." That's
[28:00] verse 25 of Matthew
[28:02] 5. But I'll just read that to you. A
[28:04] great multitude of people from Galilee
[28:06] and from the capitalists and from
[28:09] Jerusalem and from Judea and from beyond
[28:12] the Jordan. There was heaps of people
[28:14] there. And Jesus goes and he says, "And
[28:18] seeing they went up to the mountain, and
[28:21] when he said his disciples, he came unto
[28:23] them, and he opened his mouth, and he
[28:25] taught them, saying, blessed are the
[28:27] poor in spirit, for thes is the kingdom
[28:30] of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn,
[28:33] for they shall be
[28:34] comforted. Blessed are the meek, for
[28:37] they shall inherit the earth, and
[28:38] blessed are they which hunger and thirst
[28:40] after righteousness, for they shall be
[28:42] filled. Blessed are the merciful, for
[28:44] they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the
[28:47] pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[28:50] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
[28:52] shall be called the children of God.
[28:54] Blessed are they which are persecuted
[28:56] for righteousness sake, for theirs is
[28:59] the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye
[29:01] when men shall revile you and persecute
[29:04] you, and say all kind of manner of evil
[29:07] against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice
[29:11] and be exceeding glad for great is your
[29:14] reward. We've got a
[29:17] reward. Great is your reward in heaven.
[29:20] For so they pro prosecuted persecuted
[29:23] the prophets which were before you.
[29:26] Amen. May the Lord just um add his
[29:28] blessing to the word. You may be seated
[29:30] down.
[29:34] Um, I read this
[29:37] biatitudes
[29:39] because I think it's only fair. I can
[29:42] leave this one. I've got everything
[29:43] here. Now that when when God gave so
[29:47] much for us before he had to suffer and
[29:51] before he had to go through a lot of
[29:52] things, he laid a couple of things down
[29:55] to us believers and he said, "I like
[29:58] these type of people. I made heaven for
[30:01] people like this. He didn't say people
[30:04] that knew all the doctrines. He didn't
[30:06] say people that can preach you to sleep,
[30:09] that never makes a mistake. He He didn't
[30:12] say those things. He said the poor in
[30:15] spirit. He said they that mourn, you
[30:18] know, the ones that really going through
[30:20] the ringer sometimes, those people,
[30:23] heaven's for them. So when we think we
[30:26] get to Christ and we think it's all just
[30:28] a very easy road, it is not. It is not.
[30:32] It is a hard road and we're going to
[30:33] walk a hard road and we're going to
[30:34] fight many battles. Same as Joshua and
[30:37] Caleb that went through the land. There
[30:39] was many battles. God gave them
[30:41] everything, but there's battles. And we
[30:43] accept that. We're not going to back
[30:45] down for no devil. Battles may come,
[30:48] battles will go. More battles will come,
[30:51] more battles will go. demons will try to
[30:53] to to come in and and and try to push
[30:55] people aside. We just cast them out. We
[30:58] we have a different mindset as a
[31:00] believer. We don't really concentrate
[31:02] about the little battles. We worry about
[31:04] the war. It's about the end result. So
[31:07] our focus is not on earthly things and
[31:09] temporal things, but of heavenly things
[31:12] because remember he promised heaven to
[31:13] us. So that's where our focus is
[31:16] tonight. Amen. Or I pray it is. He says,
[31:19] "Rejoice in the Lord always." And again,
[31:21] I say, "Rejoice. Let your moderation be
[31:24] known unto all men. The Lord is at
[31:26] hand." Now, moderation, I went to Google
[31:28] it a little bit just to find out what
[31:31] does moderation mean. It's basically
[31:33] like your attitude. It's the way you
[31:35] conduct yourself. It is it's the
[31:37] gentleness and the kindness that's
[31:39] within you. That's your moderation.
[31:41] That's how I understand it. So God says
[31:43] you, you should be very careful how you
[31:46] conduct yourself. Let your moderation be
[31:49] known unto all men. So let what is in
[31:52] here be known. So So don't hide who you
[31:54] are. Let your speech betray you. Amen. I
[31:58] I'll go on with it. But when I read
[32:01] that, I thought, wow, it's it's so Jesus
[32:04] is so mindful that he goes, I want you
[32:06] to to act in a certain way that people
[32:08] know you're my
[32:10] follower and not not put on acting, but
[32:13] just be yourself.
[32:15] So when you be yourself, be yourself
[32:17] because the Lord is at hand. So there's
[32:19] a little bit of a warning there. He
[32:21] says, "Don't waste time. Let's get in
[32:23] there. The Lord is coming. He's here."
[32:26] He says, "Be careful for nothing, but in
[32:29] everything by prayer and supplication
[32:31] with thanksgiving, let your requests be
[32:33] known to God." So very crucial here. He
[32:36] says, "Everything," he says, "be careful
[32:38] for nothing, but everything by prayer
[32:40] and supplication." If you don't
[32:42] understand a brother or a sister, they
[32:44] confuse you a little bit or frustrate
[32:46] you, let everything in moderation. Let
[32:49] everything, your conduct, how you think
[32:51] about them, the thought that you're
[32:52] getting, put that under prayer and
[32:54] supplication with thanksgiving. Say,
[32:56] "Lord, thank you. I'm misunderstanding
[32:58] that brother."
[33:02] Why not? Because because something has
[33:04] been said that triggered something
[33:06] somewhere that's flaring up or
[33:08] something. You go, "Thank you, Lord,
[33:10] that that you you're letting the
[33:11] situation hit me. So, I'm just saying,
[33:13] "Thank you, Lord. I don't know how to
[33:15] handle it. That's why I'm asking you in
[33:16] prayer how to do this, but I'm going to
[33:18] give it to you. I'm just going to walk
[33:20] on." But even that brother that makes
[33:23] you so angry sometimes is there for you.
[33:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, so the the
[33:28] the attitude of a Christian is we just
[33:31] want God to live in our life. We just
[33:33] want to see the supernatural. We just
[33:35] want to carry on with his word. We we
[33:36] don't want to get held up, brother Moro,
[33:39] this is your word, with these little
[33:40] shenanigans. Hey, we don't we don't want
[33:43] to get sidetracked by everything that is
[33:45] here. We just want to walk with God. So,
[33:47] what God saying here is everything by
[33:50] prayer and supplication, thanksgiving,
[33:52] let your requests be made known unto
[33:54] God. Not to your neighbor, not to the
[33:56] brother or the sister or somebody else,
[33:57] to God first. So, so take that thing,
[34:00] put it back in God's hands, say, "Lord,
[34:02] I don't understand." And the peace of
[34:04] God that passes all understanding shall
[34:07] keep your hearts and minds through
[34:10] Christ Jesus. So see if we as believers
[34:13] first go God I don't understand brother
[34:15] Arman he's got a very big no nose and
[34:17] he's always scratchy and he always has a
[34:19] certain way in a certain temper and a
[34:21] certain certain forgive me anyways I was
[34:23] made this way but see if you take it to
[34:26] God would give you such a peace no
[34:28] matter what the preacher says no matter
[34:31] what the sister or the brother says it
[34:34] wouldn't bother you you're walking
[34:36] somewhere different you left this earth
[34:39] we sometimes so earthly bound found.
[34:41] We're not made to be on earth. We made
[34:43] to be up there. Spiritually minded is
[34:46] life. Carnly minded is death. So, so God
[34:49] don't want us as believers to be there.
[34:51] He wants us just to walk with him.
[34:53] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
[34:56] true, whatsoever things are honest,
[34:59] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[35:01] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[35:03] lovely, whatsoever things of a good
[35:05] report, if there be any virtue, and if
[35:08] any be praised, think on these
[35:11] things. Boy, we can waste a whole day
[35:13] about somebody saying something silly or
[35:16] some situation. You can entertain that
[35:19] situation the whole day, sometimes week,
[35:21] months, decades.
[35:24] That's not our focus.
[35:27] Whatsoever is good, whatsoever is pure.
[35:31] It's actually very easy. If you can deny
[35:34] this
[35:35] flesh and and and just keep contacting
[35:38] the Lord. It is that easy. And your
[35:41] sisters goes, "No, cuz I got 150,000
[35:45] thoughts, brother. You only have one."
[35:47] It's fine. But it is actually that easy
[35:49] because when you start going that way,
[35:52] that's where you remind yourself, sorry,
[35:53] God didn't make me like this. God said
[35:56] as everything that's pure, everything
[35:59] that's good. And that's where the battle
[36:00] happens is grabbing that thought and now
[36:03] taking that thought into captivity and
[36:05] go hold on this is not my thought. He
[36:08] says because we should discern these
[36:10] thoughts, capture it before it enters
[36:13] the big battlefield. Amen. Because once
[36:15] it enters this battlefield, men it takes
[36:17] a little bit longer. But but women, the
[36:19] moment it hits that battlefield goes and
[36:22] the whole lot. But men is just like, I
[36:24] go, what did I just think? That guy
[36:26] don't like me. We're a little bit more,
[36:28] you know, why would he say that? We But
[36:30] women goes, it goes back to another
[36:31] event to another event. No, no, no. And
[36:33] before they go, it's a big rabbit hole.
[36:34] Take that thought, catch it first. Is it
[36:37] pure?
[36:39] Is it good? Is it going to benefit you?
[36:42] If it ain't,
[36:44] done. Move on. Because whatsoever is
[36:48] good, whatsoever is pure, whatsoever is
[36:51] true, if he says, "My sister don't love
[36:54] me," that's not the truth. That's a lie.
[36:58] So, is it true? No, it's not. Put it
[37:00] down. Done. You can even do that. So,
[37:04] then Satan knows you had that thought
[37:06] because the Bible says, "Resist the
[37:08] devil and he shall flee." So,
[37:09] entertaining the thoughts is not
[37:11] resisting him.
[37:13] So you have to absolutely everything
[37:14] that comes your way as a believer, we
[37:17] just look at it different. We go, "Hold
[37:19] on. Is this going to add to my faith? Is
[37:22] this going to build some faith muscles?
[37:23] Is it going to give me faith here on my
[37:26] chest?" You know, is it going to give me
[37:27] something to to go closer to my brother
[37:30] or further away from my brother? Is this
[37:32] very thought going to separate or bring
[37:33] together? If it does that, if it's
[37:36] separating, if it's bringing a division,
[37:38] it's not from God. Cannot be. cannot
[37:43] be. He says, "On those things which you
[37:47] be both learned and received and heard
[37:49] and seen in me, do and then the God of
[37:54] peace shall be with you." So Jesus says,
[37:57] "I am the example." And we're going to
[37:59] look at him a bit. I am that example.
[38:02] And and because I'm the example, if you
[38:04] look at me, you'll make it through.
[38:07] You'll focus entirely on me, you'll make
[38:09] it through. not on
[38:12] opinions, not on anything else. Now, we
[38:14] know here's Peter and he says to Jesus,
[38:17] you know, Jesus says he will be
[38:19] crucified and they're going to they're
[38:20] going to crucify him and and now Jesus
[38:24] says to him, the will crow three
[38:25] times. You will you will deny me.
[38:29] And when he comes into the people and
[38:31] we're going to read a little bit about
[38:32] it. He says, "And Peter and Peter comes
[38:34] there to the place and the damel came to
[38:36] you and said, "Thou thou also was with
[38:39] Jesus of Galilee." So now she calls him
[38:41] out cuz he looks like a
[38:44] believer. So you go to Shikina Church,
[38:47] those weird people that always have long
[38:50] hair, long dresses,
[38:52] and look just different. You're that
[38:55] people. The first time I saw Sister
[38:57] Brunwin and and my wife saw Sister
[38:59] Bronwin, she looked different. We looked
[39:01] at her, we go Mormon. You know what did
[39:05] you say? She Mormon or Jewish or
[39:07] something like that. She looked
[39:09] different. So, she could really see
[39:11] she's
[39:12] different cuz everybody else around the
[39:15] world can't wait to take their clothes
[39:16] off. But you're just different. I'm
[39:19] sorry that we say these things, but
[39:21] you're different.
[39:23] God made you so. be happy about it. It's
[39:26] not a big thing. You're different. I'm
[39:28] different. I'm a different bunch of
[39:30] crazy than all the other crazies out
[39:32] there, but I'm having fun every moment
[39:34] cuz I'm happy with what God made me. You
[39:36] are different. You're supposed to be
[39:38] different. There's nothing wrong with
[39:40] that. I don't know who made that wrong.
[39:42] Where is it written that it's wrong? So,
[39:44] I can't have fun. So, when I I go to a
[39:47] public pool, I'm off my notes, but I'm
[39:49] going to say something. I go to a public
[39:50] pool in New Zealand and I've got long
[39:53] pants on a track shoot and I want to
[39:54] jump in the pool. Where's Josh? Can I
[39:56] get an amen here? Hey, they go, you
[39:58] can't swim in
[39:59] that. I just did. And I swim very fine.
[40:03] I grew up swimming. I'm actually a
[40:05] really good swimmer. I used to do it in
[40:07] shorts that was this long, but now I've
[40:08] got really long shorts. I can still
[40:11] swim or long pants. I don't know what
[40:13] you call it, but they're very long. But
[40:15] I I can do it. Why can't I do it? Oh no.
[40:18] The chemicals in the pool that was my
[40:20] wife might react to your
[40:22] pants. Oh, so they're different
[40:24] materials than the one that's just cut
[40:26] above the knee. Yeah. Wow. That changes
[40:31] everything. Why is it a problem? Have
[40:33] you ever thought about it? I like being
[40:35] different. Everybody else in this world
[40:37] can be different. We've got the
[40:40] HBQTV Z plus hashtags. Everything here
[40:44] this way, that way. They can do whatever
[40:45] they want. But I can't swim in a public
[40:48] pool with normal
[40:52] pants. What's wrong with this
[40:55] world? But I like being that way. So
[40:58] when he says to me, "I can't do it,"
[40:59] I'll go, "Well, then I'll just go home."
[41:01] Then I just go home. If you don't want
[41:02] me to swim in your pool, fine. I'll go
[41:04] home. Doesn't bother me. Still going to
[41:06] have fun in my house. Might not swim in
[41:08] the bath, but I'll do something else.
[41:11] Okay.
[41:13] But why should it be such a big thing?
[41:15] Why do we make it so big? It's a minor.
[41:17] It's like this lady telling Peter, "Hey,
[41:20] you've been with Jesus. Your dress code,
[41:22] you look like a
[41:24] Galilean. What's the difference?" Don't
[41:27] deny that. It's who you are. Praise the
[41:31] Lord. He made me crazy.
[41:33] Awesome. But he denied
[41:36] it. Oh, you know, sorry. It's the only
[41:38] pants I have in
[41:40] my my It's the only pants I
[41:43] have. Really? Yeah, man. No, I wear this
[41:48] because God wants me to wear it. You
[41:51] like it or not, I'm going to just do it
[41:53] anyways. My
[41:55] revelation, something God showed
[41:57] me. And when he gone to the porch, the
[42:00] maid saw him that he was there and this
[42:02] was a fellow that was with Jesus of
[42:04] Nazareth. Oh, hold on. This is it,
[42:07] brothers, because I'm picking you
[42:08] tonight. So, don't worry. Your buddies,
[42:10] they wear long pants as well. I saw them
[42:12] last week here. Yeah, we had the same
[42:14] discussion. Yep. They're pretty good
[42:16] brothers and guess what? They can swim
[42:18] as well. What does it matter? Oh, no.
[42:20] No. But you all hanging out the same
[42:22] thing. We believe in the same thing.
[42:25] You know, you you you look at the
[42:26] Jehovah's Witnesses out there. You can
[42:28] spot them a mile away. They've got a
[42:30] bicycle. They've got their black tie
[42:32] Bible under their arms. They're going
[42:34] everybody can spot
[42:35] them, right? You can spot them a mile
[42:38] away. You can see them coming up the
[42:39] road. Why? Because they're not scared of
[42:40] what they are. They're not ashamed of
[42:43] what God put them or where God put them.
[42:45] They just who they are. Praise the Lord.
[42:48] At least they have dignity to pray. I
[42:50] saw a bunch of Jehovah's Witnesses
[42:52] sitting across me in in a table in
[42:54] Portera. Four little four boys. I think
[42:57] Shantel was with me. There was one of my
[42:58] work buddies and they bowed their head
[43:01] and they prayed for their food and then
[43:03] they ate their food. And I thought that
[43:04] man can walk with God. Not scared to be
[43:07] who they are. Not denying Christ in
[43:09] front of everyone. This is who I am.
[43:11] Thank you, Lord. You made me thus. So,
[43:13] don't be ashamed of it. It's a It's a
[43:16] very very awesome place to be when you
[43:19] don't care about anybody else but what
[43:21] God thinks about
[43:22] you. So, he denies that. And then he
[43:27] says, "And after a while, it came unto
[43:29] him. They stood and they said to Peter,
[43:32] surely thou one of them, for thy speech
[43:34] betrayeth
[43:35] thee." And now you start saying what you
[43:38] believe. You know, I come amongst people
[43:41] and and we talk about the scriptures and
[43:43] they all want to use the prosperity
[43:45] gospel and and you bring a little bit of
[43:47] serpent seed in there or you bring
[43:49] something about, you know, there's seven
[43:51] seals and do you know that seven steps
[43:53] of ascension? There's actually more to
[43:55] your dress code than just normal that
[43:56] there's a deeper revelation into it.
[43:59] When you start talking that your speech
[44:00] betrays you, guess what? They walk away
[44:02] from you. They think you're
[44:04] crazy. They think you're crazy. Don't
[44:07] share your serpent seat with people.
[44:08] They think we're nuts. Yet, if you look
[44:10] in your Bible and you go to Genesis and
[44:12] you take your time and you read the
[44:14] account word for word, not what the
[44:16] Bible pictures show, it shows serpent's
[44:19] head. But God opened your eyes to it.
[44:23] So, don't be ashamed.
[44:25] So, I'm not I'm not hitting on Peter
[44:28] here, but I'm saying is God gives you a
[44:30] chance to stand for this message in your
[44:33] day. That's the privilege we have. It's
[44:35] not a burden. It's a privilege. They
[44:39] think we're crazy.
[44:41] Awesome. Amen.
[44:45] Now we get these
[44:47] guys. They're in the
[44:50] message. They love to kill with a
[44:53] letter. They know all the scriptures,
[44:55] all the
[44:56] quotes. And what happened is in all the
[44:58] years of being in the message. Now look,
[45:00] look, I'm very new in the message. I
[45:02] don't want to go and step on anybody's
[45:04] foot feet, but they've been so long in
[45:06] the message that they got used to
[45:09] it. They got used to the quotes. They
[45:12] got used to all the the the the the old
[45:15] legalistic state and the all the the
[45:18] hardness and there's no
[45:19] love. They
[45:21] hard
[45:24] hard. And what happened is they made
[45:27] such a denomination out of this message
[45:30] that it if the prophet of God was still
[45:32] here, he would be crying saying, "What
[45:34] have I done wrong?" I mean it in a
[45:37] sincerity. I came into this church and
[45:40] all I found was
[45:43] love. All I found was Christ. I saw
[45:47] people live Christ. I saw people make
[45:49] mistakes with Christ. I saw people stand
[45:51] up and make more mistakes and stand up
[45:53] again. But they kept walking with
[45:55] Christ. I saw a life on display. I
[45:58] didn't see quotes. I didn't see rules.
[46:01] Nobody came to my wife and said, "You
[46:03] better dress up,
[46:04] sister." Nobody came and put a pressure
[46:07] on us to conform to some some quote that
[46:09] the prophet gave because they got a
[46:11] quote and they based their whole life on
[46:12] it. It was the love of God displayed
[46:15] through people that brought us in. God
[46:18] had hands and feet and you are them.
[46:22] And no matter how many Bible stories or
[46:25] quotes or even verses in the Bible you
[46:27] can rehearse and tell me and write songs
[46:29] about and everything, show me your life.
[46:32] Cuz if I see the life, I can say I
[46:34] agree.
[46:36] But if you take this letter and you just
[46:38] cut people's heads off with it and you
[46:42] just kill and you just give me all the
[46:44] facts that nobody can know, then there's
[46:46] no life in that. That's not the life of
[46:49] Christ. That's not the image that we
[46:50] look when our Lord Jesus came down and
[46:52] he took the cross for us and he did so
[46:54] many other things for us. There's no
[46:55] life in that. That's just law. We're a
[46:58] long time out of the law. We are not
[47:00] under the
[47:02] law. So I'll just paraphrase. Two men
[47:06] went up and this Pharisee looked at the
[47:09] publican and he knew, hey, how many
[47:12] times do you walk into a church and you
[47:14] look at a brother or sister? You're
[47:16] like, oh mate, those guys
[47:20] You
[47:21] do sometimes. I
[47:24] do. That thought comes in a split
[47:26] second. You can't help it. But what are
[47:29] we doing with that
[47:30] thought? Oh, you know, Dave is not here.
[47:33] I can pick on him. Oh, here. There's
[47:35] Davey again. He's just makes it in
[47:38] before the song service. That's the
[47:40] thought that comes. Is that
[47:43] Christ? Come on. We are we having church
[47:46] here or what? I mean, Shannon is
[47:48] laughing there, but what are you looking
[47:51] at and him being five minutes late? Who
[47:53] cares? He's here.
[47:55] Last time I checked, he was in the world
[47:57] and then God brought him in. He's here.
[47:59] I see a miracle when I see David. Don't
[48:02] care what other people think. I hope
[48:04] he's off hunting or
[48:07] something. See, your family, we we we
[48:09] children of Christ. We don't have this
[48:11] hardness. So, cuz look at this guy's
[48:13] eyes. He says, "I am not like the other
[48:15] man. I'm not like him. I am I am I am
[48:19] fast twice a week. I pray I I I I. It's
[48:22] all about him in his little world. And I
[48:24] read the quote this way and I see it
[48:26] this way. And if anybody doesn't see it
[48:28] my way, out they go. I can't fellowship
[48:31] with him.
[48:34] That's not God.
[48:36] Sorry. That's a religious spirit.
[48:40] I never heard the prophet say, "I think
[48:42] this and I think that." I think he says,
[48:43] "God." He always pointed back to God.
[48:46] God loves you this way. God wants it
[48:47] this way. God, God, God, he gives glory
[48:49] to Jesus. Never said me. And see what
[48:53] happened with this man is the real
[48:55] sinner that we supposed to get. Cuz
[48:57] remember, I want to ask you all a
[48:58] question. It's a very honest question.
[49:00] Are we in the rapture?
[49:03] Have we left this
[49:05] earth? We're missing one.
[49:10] We missing one because if that one was
[49:12] here, we're gone. because we are looking
[49:15] for that final one so we can go home.
[49:19] So there's one. He could be sitting
[49:21] here. He could be out on the street. He
[49:23] could be there fighting with swords.
[49:25] There's one missing. This attitude is
[49:28] not going to bring the one in. Amen.
[49:30] It's going to push him out there. It's
[49:32] going to take him longer to come in
[49:33] because God has to bring him in. But he
[49:35] wants to use us as as brothers and
[49:37] sisters. Amen. Same as this. This woman
[49:41] caught in the very act of adultery. Boy,
[49:44] the Pharisees had a field game with this
[49:46] because now they had the law against
[49:48] this woman and they can go to Jesus and
[49:50] they can prove to him that this this
[49:53] must be
[49:54] killed. This woman must be
[49:58] killed because we're right. Brother
[50:00] Brandham said
[50:01] this. Church doctrine said this. Oh,
[50:05] conduct. He said this. They do that.
[50:07] They take the prophet's word and they
[50:10] kill with the
[50:11] word. Where's the
[50:13] love? I want to read this account to you
[50:15] because this touched me really hard this
[50:17] week. And I thought, you know what? May
[50:19] we never have this type of attitude. But
[50:21] I'll tell you what is our attitude.
[50:22] Don't worry, we're not finishing on a
[50:23] low. We're finishing on a high. Scribes
[50:26] and Pharisees bought unto um him a woman
[50:28] taken in adultery. And when they sat in
[50:31] the midst, they said to him,
[50:32] "Master, master,
[50:36] great, great
[50:38] master." Huh?
[50:40] Hypocrites. The prophet said,
[50:43] "Brother, you know, when he was here and
[50:45] you know, he went to South
[50:47] Africa, they do it. They come in
[50:50] humility. They come in such a soft
[50:51] nature, but inside of them, they want to
[50:54] kill. They don't want to catch someone
[50:56] to God. They want to kill.
[50:59] I want to stop your
[51:01] influence. This woman was taken in the
[51:03] act of very in the act of adultery in
[51:06] the very
[51:07] act. Now Moses in the law commanded us,
[51:10] brother Brandham said that that should
[51:12] that she should be stoned. But what do
[51:14] you say?
[51:16] They come with these trick questions to
[51:18] you. We spoke a little bit about
[51:20] tonight. I don't want to go too much
[51:21] into it, but they come with trick
[51:22] questions to you trying to catch you out
[51:25] because you're not doctrinally right.
[51:29] I'm not doctrinally right. I'm right
[51:31] with Christ. He's still leading. He's
[51:33] still teaching. I'm willing to learn.
[51:35] Are you? Or have you learned everything
[51:37] and have forgot everything as well?
[51:40] I'm glad I'm learning what they
[51:43] forgot. He said, "And they trying to
[51:46] tempt him and that they might accuse
[51:49] him." But Jesus took down. See, he
[51:52] became lower than them. Yeah. And he
[51:55] wrote with his finger on the
[51:57] ground and and and as he not heard them,
[52:00] he said, "But here it comes." So they
[52:02] continued asking them. They want this
[52:04] debate. And he lifted himself up and
[52:06] said unto them, "He that is without sin
[52:09] among you, let him first cast a stone at
[52:12] her." See, because he looked at her
[52:14] heart and he goes, "This is not about
[52:17] the adultery here. This is not about a
[52:20] woman making a mistake. This is you
[52:22] trying to catch me out of my words. This
[52:24] is you trying to prove that you're
[52:25] holier than thou. That because you're 25
[52:28] years or 70 years in the in the message,
[52:30] you know it all. And I'm just a leak and
[52:32] I know nothing.
[52:34] Well, if it's about what I know in the
[52:36] message is nothing, then guess what? You
[52:38] got it. I know nothing. But I know one
[52:40] thing. He saved me.
[52:42] I know a little bit more than you. He
[52:44] saved me. And because he saved me, he
[52:45] said he'll keep me cuz he cannot fail.
[52:49] And again he stooped and he wrote on the
[52:51] ground. And they that were convicted by
[52:54] their own conscience began to walk from
[52:56] the eldest to the
[52:57] youngest. But now Jesus looks up and he
[53:00] says to the woman, "Woman, where are
[53:02] thine
[53:03] accusers? Hath no man condemned
[53:06] thee?" So I want to ask you, is that our
[53:09] attitude? When we look at someone coming
[53:11] through the door, it looks like the cat
[53:13] dra dragged him in here, played him a
[53:15] couple of times and kicked him around.
[53:17] just looks like he's going through a
[53:18] real rough time. Or parents or or or
[53:22] people coming in and and they just have
[53:24] a little bit of pressure on them. Are we
[53:26] looking him with
[53:28] this? Huh? Knowingly did something wrong
[53:31] completely off the rails and they walk
[53:34] in the door. They hear they made it
[53:35] Sunday. They made it. Eventually this
[53:39] flesh dragged them into church. Do we
[53:42] have this? Say, "Hey, bro. Look around
[53:45] you. Do you see anybody pointing
[53:46] fingers?" No, you're
[53:49] home. What can happen when we have that
[53:52] attitude? That's the attitude of the
[53:54] bride. That's why Jesus came to the
[53:57] publicans. That's why Jesus was found
[54:00] with the harlots. Because his whole
[54:02] ministry, brother Ben, you nailed it
[54:03] tonight when you said it. That's his
[54:05] ministry is us. Is the sinner is the one
[54:08] that couldn't make
[54:10] it. That's why he came. But that's the
[54:13] heart of Christ within us. We cannot
[54:16] exclude anyone. We are definitely not
[54:18] exclusive. Brethren,
[54:20] he said unto them, "Go ye into the world
[54:23] and preach the gospel to every
[54:27] and Elise."
[54:29] Beautiful. So, hold on. Can you tell me
[54:32] what's a creature?
[54:37] Is it just humans?
[54:42] Every
[54:43] creature means if a wasp things you, you
[54:45] give him the gospel,
[54:48] huh? Come on. We speak to elements.
[54:52] Who Who's ever spoken to a storm? I did.
[54:56] It works. Brother Ben did. It works. I
[54:59] remember Papa New Guinea trip. Yeah.
[55:02] See, there's testimonies where God gave
[55:04] us the the spoken word. And this is what
[55:07] I want to master on to speak to all
[55:11] creatures. As far as I know, humans
[55:13] aren't the only creatures. There was a
[55:15] possum that went to brother Brandham and
[55:17] asked for prayer. And brother Brandham
[55:19] prayed for it.
[55:22] He he bumped into the hornets and they
[55:24] wanted to sting him and he just
[55:26] apologized and they went back in their
[55:27] nest. The bull in the field. This is a
[55:30] life that's been lived. It works.
[55:33] It works. There's a couple of sheep at
[55:36] my house. They don't want to listen to
[55:37] me, but I'll just keep preaching to
[55:39] them. Man, those things go everywhere I
[55:41] don't want them to go. I can see how we
[55:43] liken to sheep. Because if you ever want
[55:45] to see something get lost, the sheep. Oh
[55:48] dear. You put a fence up, they chew the
[55:50] fence. I've got a plastic fence. They'll
[55:52] chew through the plastic fence. I'm
[55:54] like, "Bro, don't go there. That's why
[55:56] the fence is there." But he wants to go
[55:58] there. Or she actually. M let's leave
[56:03] that. And I'm not lying. He that
[56:05] believeth and is baptized shall be
[56:07] saved. He that believeth not shall be
[56:10] damned. So who's doing the work? You or
[56:12] God? Who's doing the judgment? You or
[56:15] God? Don't worry if they believe or not.
[56:17] It's not your job. Pray for them. Have a
[56:20] burden for them. But that comes between
[56:22] them and God. Nothing to do in this
[56:24] church. We just preach it. They receive
[56:27] it. And if they receive it, praise the
[56:29] Lord. And if they don't, we preach it
[56:30] some more. And these signs shall follow
[56:32] them that believe in my name. They shall
[56:34] cast out demons. So what is your job,
[56:36] church?
[56:38] If you see that demon sinning on that
[56:41] demon of lust or that demon of
[56:42] depression or that demon of of just
[56:45] disobedience or whatever it is, you see
[56:47] it on on your brother or sister. What do
[56:49] you do? Do you go slap him, spray him
[56:51] through of holy water and say, "Get out,
[56:53] Satan." No.
[56:56] Love casts out demons.
[56:59] You love him first, then you worry about
[57:01] the demon on him. But sometimes we want
[57:04] to cast out the demon. We have no
[57:06] relationship with a guy. We don't even
[57:07] pray one day for him. And you want to
[57:08] cast that demon out. Never going to
[57:10] work. Never going to work. He'll sit
[57:12] right there cuz love cast that out.
[57:17] They shall take up serpents and if they
[57:19] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[57:20] hurt them. They said lay their hands
[57:22] upon the sick and that doesn't mean a
[57:23] box law and they shall
[57:26] recover. Sometimes Liam gets sick or
[57:29] Ruben gets sick and they lie in the bed.
[57:31] And I always remember when I was young,
[57:33] my mom would sit with me. I was a very
[57:35] mama's boy. Okay. My wife can testify to
[57:39] that. Yeah. And uh I would be sick and I
[57:43] got this massive headache and my lips
[57:45] will swell up and I'm just lying in bed
[57:46] and I'm really sick. And all my mom
[57:49] would do, she'll lay my her head hands
[57:51] right on my head like this. She'll just
[57:54] hold it there. She'll put it on my
[57:55] chest, not say a word, but that hands
[57:58] will be there until I fall
[57:59] asleep. Now, I believe a simple gesture
[58:03] like that in love will heal
[58:06] me. I don't have to pray some massive
[58:10] exorbitant prayer and try to get all
[58:12] heaven in the room. Lay your hands out
[58:15] of love, dedicate them to God. He'll do
[58:17] the rest. It's not your ability. It's
[58:21] your love. It's the love that God gave
[58:23] us and showed us. That's what
[58:25] heals every heart. You know what
[58:29] biatitudes? You know why Jesus could
[58:31] preach those
[58:32] biatitudes? Because he lived
[58:35] it. He lived it. He was the
[58:38] manifestation of the biatitudes. He was
[58:41] poor in spirit before he got crucified.
[58:44] before they took him up, he said, "Lord,
[58:47] I have such I'm so down. I want to give
[58:49] you the scripture." This is what he
[58:52] said. Give me a sec. He said here, "Oh
[58:57] father," he says, "My soul is
[58:59] exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death.
[59:03] Try he and watch with me." He's asking
[59:05] them. He's he's he's in his spirit. He's
[59:08] just sorrowful. He's got such a burden,
[59:11] such a heaviness on him. He understands
[59:13] the biatitudes when he preached them cuz
[59:15] he was living it. He was meek. No man
[59:19] like our Lord Jesus. So he's asking us
[59:22] can we be that same exp that same
[59:25] example? Because what happened here is
[59:28] this had to the Lord Jesus had to die
[59:31] for us to live. Now he is for us. We
[59:35] need to die so that others can live. But
[59:39] you need to die to yourself, your own
[59:41] ideas, the way you see things. You need
[59:44] to die to reasoning. You need to die to
[59:48] to making a preconceived idea of someone
[59:51] to these little filters and labels and
[59:53] all these things we put on each other.
[59:54] You need to die to that to getting
[59:57] offended or or getting wrongly done and
[1:00:00] holding a grudge. We need to die every
[1:00:03] day die. The Paul says daily die to
[1:00:05] self. But you need to die because our
[1:00:08] example
[1:00:10] died. See, we don't get whipped. Our
[1:00:13] beard doesn't get ripped out. We don't
[1:00:15] get m beyond only man. All he's asking
[1:00:19] us is, can you leave your own
[1:00:22] ideas and give them
[1:00:24] grace? Not
[1:00:28] law. So he lives that.
[1:00:31] He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:00:34] you, except the corn of wheat fall to
[1:00:36] the ground and die, it abideth alone.
[1:00:38] But if it dies, it brings forth much
[1:00:42] fruit." Much
[1:00:44] fruit. So if you stick with Jesus, if
[1:00:48] you walk with our
[1:00:49] Lord, you'll be fine. But walk with him
[1:00:53] first. Walk in the word. If you don't
[1:00:56] understand someone or something goes a
[1:00:57] little bit wrong or miss or some
[1:00:59] something preached over the pulpit, it
[1:01:01] hurts a little bit, just take it back to
[1:01:03] him. It's a very very simple thing. It
[1:01:05] works. I I do it a lot. People use
[1:01:09] exuberant languages and stuff like that
[1:01:11] and and I I see all the message terms
[1:01:14] being thrown around and I and they lose
[1:01:15] me and I don't understand. I sit in in
[1:01:17] the pew and I start praying and say,
[1:01:18] "Lord, I'm missing this. Can you please
[1:01:20] show it to me?" And he does. Because
[1:01:22] see, my focus is first take it back to
[1:01:24] God. then you'll be fine. He says, "He
[1:01:27] that loveth his own life shall lose it,
[1:01:29] and he that is life um that hateth his
[1:01:32] light shall keep his life on um life
[1:01:34] eternal." He says, "But if any man serve
[1:01:36] me, let him follow me, and where I am,
[1:01:40] there also be my servant be. And if any
[1:01:44] man serve me, um him will my father
[1:01:47] honor."
[1:01:49] Now he says my soul is troubled and what
[1:01:52] shall I
[1:01:53] say? Father save me from this hour. See
[1:01:57] he comes to a point where Lord just save
[1:02:02] me. Just just let this pass. He says but
[1:02:05] for this cause I've come into this hour.
[1:02:08] Father glorify thy name. Then a voice
[1:02:10] came from heaven saying I will glorify
[1:02:12] it and I will glorify it again. And the
[1:02:14] people therefore stood by. I want to
[1:02:16] bring you this account. and heard it
[1:02:18] said that it was a thunder and other
[1:02:19] said that an angel spoke to him says but
[1:02:23] Jesus answered and said this
[1:02:26] voice I hope you read between the lines
[1:02:29] here this
[1:02:31] voice was not but didn't come be for me
[1:02:34] but it came for your
[1:02:37] sakes I want you to realize that this
[1:02:41] message didn't just come for God it came
[1:02:44] for us
[1:02:46] this voice that was put on tapes. This
[1:02:49] ministry that is the truth introduced me
[1:02:52] to Jesus Christ. I am not ashamed of it
[1:02:54] and I will never be ashamed of this
[1:02:56] message because I've never seen the
[1:02:59] rules. I've never seen the legalism that
[1:03:02] went through in all these church ages or
[1:03:04] or these these these the years before. I
[1:03:07] didn't see it. I only saw God. I only
[1:03:11] saw love. And this message is true. And
[1:03:15] now is the judgment of this world
[1:03:18] because of this message. He says, "And
[1:03:21] there shall be and the prince of this
[1:03:23] world shall be cast out." If you really
[1:03:26] listen to brother Brandham's tapes and
[1:03:28] you read your Bible, you will never
[1:03:31] ever, I promise you this, never ever
[1:03:35] have a ought against a brother or
[1:03:37] sister.
[1:03:39] Never. Never. I was a year I worked with
[1:03:42] brother Isaac. I bingched. listen to
[1:03:44] tapes, if you can say binge watching,
[1:03:46] binge listening. I don't know what you
[1:03:47] call it. I listened to so many tapes. I
[1:03:50] used to listen sometimes three a day. I
[1:03:53] was just feeding off the message. Never
[1:03:55] ever did this message put me in a
[1:03:58] legalistic state. It's easily you can go
[1:04:00] that way. You can go very liberal, you
[1:04:02] can, but God brings you into the middle.
[1:04:03] Never ever did it get me to hate someone
[1:04:05] in church.
[1:04:08] In fact, it changed me so much that you
[1:04:10] became their servant rather than their
[1:04:12] master.
[1:04:14] So this message works. Don't take a
[1:04:16] quote and form your life on a little bit
[1:04:18] of scripture or a quote that you hurt.
[1:04:20] That is you'll you'll kill yourself
[1:04:21] right there. You'll become a
[1:04:25] denomination. He says if a brethren is
[1:04:27] taken over in fault, ye which are
[1:04:29] spiritual, we got lots of them. Restore
[1:04:32] such a one Bible study. Remember we did
[1:04:34] this in our Sunday school kids in the
[1:04:37] spirit of meekness.
[1:04:39] So if I'm wrong, please can you come to
[1:04:41] me and not hit me with all the
[1:04:43] quotes? Can you just come to me and say,
[1:04:45] "Brother, you're doing wrong. I really
[1:04:47] love you. I need you I need you to to
[1:04:50] just listen. You said something that
[1:04:51] really hurt my feelings." And I'll go,
[1:04:54] "I'm so sorry. This is the last thing I
[1:04:56] would ever want to do is hurt someone's
[1:04:58] feelings. Brother Mont, when you spoke
[1:05:00] about this, I don't totally agree with
[1:05:02] you on this. Can we have a chat about
[1:05:03] it?" I'm like, "Yes, let's talk." That's
[1:05:05] the way we as Christians talk to each
[1:05:07] other.
[1:05:08] We don't hold things for next week. We
[1:05:10] don't put something on the shelf to when
[1:05:12] I have time, I'll come back to it. We
[1:05:13] don't do those things. We go and fix it
[1:05:15] right now because it's so more important
[1:05:18] to have fellowship with you than to put
[1:05:21] a issue between me and you and a
[1:05:23] division. It's so important to stay in
[1:05:25] good fellowship with you and and love
[1:05:28] you all the days of my life to have a
[1:05:30] misunderstanding between a brother and a
[1:05:31] and another brother. I saw brother M and
[1:05:35] and
[1:05:36] um brother Ben, they had a
[1:05:39] misunderstanding, bro. They fixed it
[1:05:41] that same day. Correct. We fix it. We
[1:05:44] move on. We don't linger these things.
[1:05:47] We crack on with it. He says, "Bear ye
[1:05:50] one another's burdens and so fulfill the
[1:05:53] law of Christ. For any man that thinks
[1:05:55] himself to be something when he is
[1:05:57] nothing, he deceiveth himself. But let
[1:06:00] every man prove his own
[1:06:02] work, and then shall he rejoice in
[1:06:04] himself alone, and not in other. For
[1:06:07] every man shall bear his own burden. Let
[1:06:10] him that is taught in the word
[1:06:12] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[1:06:14] all good things. Be not deceived. God is
[1:06:16] not mocked. And whatsoever a man seweth,
[1:06:18] he shall reap. For he that sweth of the
[1:06:21] flesh shall reap of the flesh, that is
[1:06:22] corruption. But he that sweth of the
[1:06:25] spirit shall reap of the spirit life
[1:06:29] everlasting. So to be carnal minded not
[1:06:32] good to be spiritually minded you're
[1:06:34] doing good. You go to God first. He says
[1:06:38] let us not be weary in welloing for in
[1:06:41] due season you will reap and as if you
[1:06:43] don't faint. So brother Isaac, sister
[1:06:46] Shannon, how long did you pray for
[1:06:48] David? How many hours, how many days
[1:06:52] have you spent on your knees for your
[1:06:53] sons and your daughters?
[1:06:56] Many. Many. In due season, you shall
[1:07:00] reap what you
[1:07:02] sow. Sister Vanessa, same there. How
[1:07:06] many hours, how many days? Brother
[1:07:08] Kib, like let's let's where the rubber
[1:07:11] hits the road. You're praying every
[1:07:13] day. You know what? My mom and dad
[1:07:16] prayed for me and I met the Lord at 32
[1:07:19] years
[1:07:20] old. Never stop praying for me. Don't
[1:07:25] stop. Let us not be weary and welloing
[1:07:27] for in due season you will reap what you
[1:07:30] sow. You sow those seeds. I'll close
[1:07:34] with this. Our Lord was that seed that
[1:07:37] went into the ground. But one thing he
[1:07:39] taught us. Notice what harmony. Jesus
[1:07:43] never did anything until see the father
[1:07:44] do it and he showed him first harmony
[1:07:46] between God and Christ. John 5:19 it
[1:07:49] says all judgment is reserved received
[1:07:51] um reserved to Jesus. So will the bride
[1:07:55] um um so will the bride and he shows his
[1:07:58] word of life. He shows her so she
[1:08:02] receives it. She never doubts
[1:08:05] it. Nothing can harm her not even death.
[1:08:09] She's walking in a total different
[1:08:11] realm. He says, "For the seed be
[1:08:13] planted, the water will raise it up
[1:08:15] again." Oh, I can get a big hallelujah
[1:08:17] there. He says, "Here is the secret.
[1:08:18] Here's your secret, brothers and
[1:08:20] sisters. The word is in
[1:08:24] you. The word of God is in you and the
[1:08:28] mind of Christ."
[1:08:30] So, it's not just the
[1:08:33] word. We don't just kill with this. We
[1:08:35] don't just bring We have the mind of
[1:08:37] Christ. And the mind of Christ is the
[1:08:40] one that goes to the harlots, goes to
[1:08:42] the publicans, goes and sees beyond what
[1:08:44] happened, the circumstance, beyond the
[1:08:46] symptoms, and they look at the cause.
[1:08:49] They're a different kind of people. He
[1:08:51] says, "And she does it in his name. She
[1:08:54] has the dust, say of the Lord." So if
[1:08:56] you're praying for your sons and
[1:08:57] daughters, you have the dust, say of the
[1:08:59] Lord. It is within you. You're filled
[1:09:01] with the Holy Ghost. You believe that
[1:09:03] you can get healed. There's Brother Ron
[1:09:05] Spencer's testimony.
[1:09:07] It will happen. Do whatever you need to
[1:09:10] do. Fight whatever you need to do. Go
[1:09:12] wherever you need to do. Whatever it
[1:09:14] takes, but you have thus say of the Lord
[1:09:17] if you believe it because that's what
[1:09:19] the prophet says. It is germmitized. So
[1:09:21] the Holy Spirit waters it until it grows
[1:09:24] and it serves its purpose. So when you
[1:09:26] release that
[1:09:27] word and and sister Anna and us, we had
[1:09:30] a nice fellowship around this. When you
[1:09:32] release a word, remember, it will be
[1:09:36] like that. It's a powerful thing because
[1:09:40] if you're filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:41] God gives you that utterance, he comes
[1:09:43] behind your word and he will not let
[1:09:46] that word fail. Because see what he
[1:09:48] does. He says, look at the green, they
[1:09:50] will do the works of God, for it is
[1:09:52] himself in them continuing his
[1:09:55] word to fulfill. And he did completed in
[1:09:59] his days all things when he was there.
[1:10:02] He did not complete all when he was
[1:10:04] here, for it was not time
[1:10:07] yet. I'm going to close. Musicians, you
[1:10:10] can come up. Our work, our work is Jesus
[1:10:15] Christ in us. Our works is to rest. Let
[1:10:19] God minister through us to everyone.
[1:10:22] Amen. All the creatures, not just the
[1:10:25] bride, not just the chosen ones, every
[1:10:28] single one. If we're going to go to
[1:10:31] heaven, how many can we take with us? I
[1:10:34] ask you.
[1:10:36] Are we are we happy to come every
[1:10:37] service here and we only count 80 every
[1:10:41] service? Is that is that's not where we
[1:10:43] at. We want them all in. We don't want
[1:10:46] to give one to Satan. Amen. I said, "But
[1:10:49] why this this burdens upon me?" And I
[1:10:51] want to just explain it
[1:10:55] again is it matters what you say.
[1:10:59] And no matter how big your life is on or
[1:11:02] how long you've been in this message,
[1:11:04] you message kids that grew up in the
[1:11:06] message, I feel sorry for you some days
[1:11:10] because they sincerely think they've got
[1:11:11] it all
[1:11:13] together because they heard all the
[1:11:15] quotes. They they they seen a life with
[1:11:18] mom and dad that was always good. They
[1:11:20] think they're okay, but they've never
[1:11:23] met
[1:11:24] him. You're not
[1:11:26] okay. You need to meet him first.
[1:11:31] No matter how well trained you are in
[1:11:33] reversed in the message, you sisters,
[1:11:36] I'm telling you that. No matter if your
[1:11:37] dad is the
[1:11:39] pastor, no matter if your if your dad is
[1:11:42] a deacon or or a song leader in the
[1:11:44] church, you need to meet Christ for
[1:11:47] yourself. If you haven't met him,
[1:11:50] doesn't count nothing at the moment.
[1:11:52] You're still on base number one. Walk.
[1:11:55] Don't stop walking. But but don't let
[1:11:57] your speech betray you.
[1:12:01] You you you have to get out of this
[1:12:04] message thought of because I'm in the
[1:12:06] message. I'm in the rapture. It's
[1:12:09] nonsense. The message is not the
[1:12:12] rapture. Jesus Christ is the rapture.
[1:12:15] The Holy Ghost is the rapture. The
[1:12:17] message introduces you to Christ for
[1:12:20] your day. That's fine. You need the
[1:12:23] message, but you need Christ. And no
[1:12:26] amount of quotes ever is going to get
[1:12:28] you in the
[1:12:30] rapture. So if you think you're okay
[1:12:33] because you know the quotes, you're not.
[1:12:35] And I'm encouraging because I thought I
[1:12:38] was okay before I met Christ, but I was
[1:12:40] not. And when I started listening to the
[1:12:43] prophet for my day and he's placing me
[1:12:45] in time and I start seeing what time we
[1:12:47] are at, I got convicted and I got
[1:12:49] concerned. And then I thought, you know
[1:12:51] what? I need to change something.
[1:12:56] But brother Brandham introduced me to
[1:12:59] Christ, the living God. I saw miracles
[1:13:02] happen in this
[1:13:03] church. I saw miracles happen in my
[1:13:06] house. I had prayer meetings on Fridays
[1:13:08] and all those things. But I had to meet
[1:13:10] Christ
[1:13:14] first. Message children, don't become a
[1:13:18] denomination.
[1:13:20] come to church, listen to a tape, go on
[1:13:23] with your life, and not meet Christ. You
[1:13:25] will never change. You will stay the
[1:13:27] same. You'll be a very good
[1:13:29] person. You'll be a very good person.
[1:13:32] Message kids are some of the awesomest,
[1:13:34] nicest, mannered, beautiful kids this
[1:13:37] world will ever
[1:13:38] see. But without Christ, you're still
[1:13:43] nothing. I mean it nicely. So when we
[1:13:46] look at each other, may we see Christ in
[1:13:49] one another. May we may we have the love
[1:13:52] of Christ to look around the room, look
[1:13:54] in other churches. Look, I just want to
[1:13:57] say I'm tired of going to to camps and
[1:13:59] I'm tired to go to places and all I hear
[1:14:02] is
[1:14:03] critique. That's not God. My mom always
[1:14:07] used to say to me, and I'm off my notes,
[1:14:09] but there's a reason for it. May God
[1:14:11] back this up tonight.
[1:14:14] My mom used to say, "If you have nothing
[1:14:16] good to say to someone, be
[1:14:19] quiet." Because our job is to find the
[1:14:22] last
[1:14:24] one. That's why we're here. And we can't
[1:14:28] leave until we find the last
[1:14:31] one. But sometimes we get so entrapped
[1:14:33] in the we made it into the message. The
[1:14:36] people in our families look at our
[1:14:38] speech and it betrays us. They look at
[1:14:42] our life and it's contrary to what this
[1:14:43] message is. Yeah, we look the part but
[1:14:45] we don't say the words. We go through
[1:14:48] some
[1:14:50] motions. This message is life. Every day
[1:14:54] of my life, I'm
[1:14:55] happy. I'll tell you this. This is
[1:14:58] Listen to what I say tonight. It's not
[1:15:00] boring to be in Christ.
[1:15:03] You're not losing out anything, boys.
[1:15:06] This world has nothing for you that I I
[1:15:08] didn't have.
[1:15:10] But in Christ, it's pure. In Christ,
[1:15:15] it's good. In Christ, it's holy. It is
[1:15:19] It is a good
[1:15:21] thing. Outside of
[1:15:23] Christ, nothing
[1:15:25] good. Telling you now. Am I
[1:15:29] bored? You kids have worries about being
[1:15:31] bored. No, we're not bored. In fact, we
[1:15:33] beat the youth in basketball. It was a
[1:15:35] deadly game and we had some knees and
[1:15:37] elbows going there. But we had fun
[1:15:39] because we can do what the world does.
[1:15:41] We just don't do it like
[1:15:43] them. We don't have to stoop to the
[1:15:46] world's level. We're a little bit
[1:15:47] higher. See, God gave you the word. He
[1:15:50] gave you He gave you Christ in your
[1:15:51] life. You're a different being, man.
[1:15:53] Stop living under your
[1:15:58] privilege. Your friend at school that
[1:16:00] you pray for, Reuben, Liam,
[1:16:03] Josh, God has given you the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:07] speak the
[1:16:09] word cuz a demon ain't going to go out
[1:16:11] if you don't speak to it. You can't
[1:16:14] think it out of someone. You say, "Lord,
[1:16:16] I'm coming for my friends. In the name
[1:16:19] of Jesus Christ, I accept it. You've
[1:16:21] never failed. You will release them.
[1:16:22] Lord, I pray for them." And you start
[1:16:25] praying for them. And when they come and
[1:16:26] talk to you, you don't talk like them.
[1:16:29] You talk like Christ. The only way
[1:16:31] you're going to get that devil off of
[1:16:32] them if you give them the word, the pure
[1:16:35] word. You go to Satan's level, he'll
[1:16:38] beat you with experience. He's been
[1:16:39] there for 6,000 years. He'll beat you
[1:16:43] every time. But when your speech don't
[1:16:45] betray you and they say, "Oh, let's go
[1:16:47] do this or let's do that." And they
[1:16:49] challenge you. Even the ones in the
[1:16:50] church and you speak what God speaks,
[1:16:53] not not legalism. Just say, "No, you
[1:16:55] know what? God, I don't want to go
[1:16:56] there. God doesn't want me to go there."
[1:16:58] Now, your speech is testifying for what
[1:17:00] you're believing. That speaks more than
[1:17:03] brother Ben would stand you on a whole
[1:17:04] Sunday trying to get a sermon to
[1:17:06] someone. Cuz it's in fellowship where I
[1:17:09] grew. It's in fellowship where God got a
[1:17:12] hold of me. Ben, brother Ben preaches
[1:17:14] it. We walk out this door. We go sit
[1:17:16] down and God just comes on the scene and
[1:17:18] he brings a brother and he opens up more
[1:17:20] and more and more because why? Their
[1:17:22] speech didn't betray
[1:17:25] them. Because they were real
[1:17:29] believers. Amen.
[1:17:32] So just remember, you're these people.
[1:17:35] You are the poor in spirit. You are the
[1:17:37] ones that mourn for the abomination out
[1:17:40] in the
[1:17:41] city. You look at girls walking around
[1:17:43] half naked. Don't even had clothes on.
[1:17:45] There was a lady on the street corners
[1:17:46] of Wellington. She was in a She didn't
[1:17:48] have a jacket on. She had a a top on
[1:17:50] like this and a and a little skirt on
[1:17:52] like this. It looked like I don't know
[1:17:54] what was going on with her. She was
[1:17:56] getting so cold. The devil had her in
[1:17:58] such a state that she would walk in this
[1:18:01] little bit of fabric outside getting so
[1:18:03] cold holding everything together cuz
[1:18:05] it's so cold in Wellington. But she
[1:18:07] wouldn't put a jacket
[1:18:09] on. You must be crazy to get
[1:18:13] there. But see, I didn't look at the
[1:18:16] circumstance and go, "That girl is
[1:18:18] crazy." I started looking and I said,
[1:18:19] "God, please touch that sister."
[1:18:24] Because I used to be liking that
[1:18:27] sister, that type of girl. When I was
[1:18:30] still in the world, that was my taste.
[1:18:32] But when God made me a new creature cre
[1:18:34] creature, start looking at those people
[1:18:36] and I look
[1:18:37] different. That's your job.
[1:18:41] I see people fight in Oakuckland with
[1:18:43] brother
[1:18:45] John and brother John and I were
[1:18:47] standing on the corner and we're looking
[1:18:49] at this and there's a a a man and a
[1:18:51] woman down the street busy fighting with
[1:18:54] each other shouting at the top of their
[1:18:55] voices slamming doors and he drives
[1:18:58] after her and then he goes and he opens
[1:18:59] his door and he's fighting and it's
[1:19:00] swearing and cursing and everything and
[1:19:02] brother John he's a witness he's
[1:19:04] standing right next to me and he says
[1:19:05] brother Aland says what should we
[1:19:08] do I said No, brother John, I don't know
[1:19:11] what to do. He says, "We shall pray
[1:19:13] right now." We bowed our heads in the
[1:19:16] middle of the street, busy, everything
[1:19:18] going on. Started praying. He said,
[1:19:21] "Lord Jesus, come on the scene for those
[1:19:23] people." And he prayed with such
[1:19:25] conviction. He said, "Lord, may this be
[1:19:27] broken in the name of Jesus Christ." You
[1:19:29] can see how Satan came between husband
[1:19:31] and wife or or man and woman. I don't
[1:19:33] know what's the situation, you know. I
[1:19:35] said, "But break that in the name of
[1:19:36] Jesus Christ." It wasn't even 10 seconds
[1:19:38] later the thing stopped. They got back
[1:19:40] in the car and it was calm. What
[1:19:43] happened? What did the argument stop
[1:19:45] there? No. The supernatural came in cuz
[1:19:48] the son of God was standing there and he
[1:19:50] knew his position. That's us. We are the
[1:19:54] superheroes of this age. We don't need
[1:19:56] to to to try to dress up a certain way
[1:19:59] or or or try to act a certain toughness
[1:20:02] when we see something at fault. We have
[1:20:04] the heart of Christ and the mind of
[1:20:06] Christ to go and pray for that brother
[1:20:08] and
[1:20:09] intercede. You're a special type of
[1:20:12] people. We come to church, we can't just
[1:20:14] come and be pew
[1:20:16] warmers. It's not what we're here for.
[1:20:19] We're here to tear down the kingdom of
[1:20:21] Satan with love. Man, think about it.
[1:20:25] You're the coolest people on earth. You
[1:20:26] can look Satan in the eyes with love and
[1:20:29] go, "Be
[1:20:31] God. He has to go. Because if you look
[1:20:34] with love, you don't see the the the
[1:20:37] sinner. You see the demon on
[1:20:40] them. You love the
[1:20:42] sinner, but you deal with that
[1:20:45] sin. It's different. Now, Shikina, the
[1:20:49] last one needs to come in. What are we
[1:20:52] doing? Does our speech betray us?
[1:20:57] When we walk into your building or your
[1:21:00] workplace, you walk in there, do you
[1:21:02] say, "Brother, hey, good morning all."
[1:21:04] You go, "Hey, good morning. God bless
[1:21:09] you. How was your day?" "Oh, my husband
[1:21:12] is very sick. What's wrong with him?"
[1:21:15] "Oh no, he's got cancer. Can I come and
[1:21:18] pray for you? I'm a believer. I I can
[1:21:21] come and pray for you. It's my job." It
[1:21:23] says here, "Marching
[1:21:25] orders." No. Oh, no. We don't want
[1:21:27] prayer. I'm trying. I I I'm available.
[1:21:30] Here's my number. You ever if you change
[1:21:31] your mind, if doctors give him up, I'll
[1:21:34] come and pray for him. Do we do that? I
[1:21:37] think brother does that a lot. Huh?
[1:21:41] That's our job,
[1:21:43] man. We're not going to give one away to
[1:21:45] the enemy. Not
[1:21:47] one. That's our job. Amen.
[1:21:53] Um, brother Isaac, you can start playing
[1:21:55] a song then to sing and and maybe I'll
[1:21:57] just close in a word of prayer. I just
[1:21:59] want you to think about this. God has
[1:22:02] placed a very great army that's going to
[1:22:04] finish his work. He's going to finish it
[1:22:07] through
[1:22:09] her. You're sitting here
[1:22:11] army. Each one of you, you might feel,
[1:22:15] Lilia, that you're the maybe little
[1:22:18] littlest one in the school. Okay, hold
[1:22:21] on. You're the most powerful weapon God
[1:22:23] has placed in that place.
[1:22:26] Most powerful. You know that your
[1:22:28] friends don't have one chance if it
[1:22:30] wasn't for
[1:22:31] you. Not one chance, but they've got
[1:22:34] Lilia in their class. So, you can check
[1:22:37] them all out. You say, "Lord, start with
[1:22:40] A. Who's A? Aaron. We start with Aaron.
[1:22:43] And then B for Betty. And go for Betty."
[1:22:45] And you start praying for them all. and
[1:22:47] you start claiming them to God because
[1:22:48] guess what? You have a burden for the
[1:22:51] people that you love. And even though
[1:22:54] let's call who's who's a bully usually
[1:22:56] or Charlie. Charlie is usually a bully.
[1:22:58] You pray for him first. You say, "Lord,
[1:23:02] change Charlie's heart." You'll see what
[1:23:05] happens in your life. You'll start
[1:23:06] walking the supernatural. You'll start
[1:23:07] seeing miracles.
[1:23:09] Guys, are you filled with the Holy
[1:23:12] Ghost? Yes. Pray for them. I heard you
[1:23:14] pray for your brother.
[1:23:16] Many a
[1:23:18] times you remember the
[1:23:20] testimonies. Where's your
[1:23:22] brother? Amen. See what force you are.
[1:23:26] Did you give
[1:23:27] up? No such
[1:23:29] option. Amen. So let's just bow in a
[1:23:33] word of prayer and and we just say thank
[1:23:35] you Lord. Father, that you have made us
[1:23:38] such a beautiful,
[1:23:40] special person, Father, that when we we
[1:23:43] come into a situation, Lord, that we
[1:23:47] don't see the obvious, we see the
[1:23:50] potential, Lord, like those um
[1:23:52] Pharisees, they only looked at the
[1:23:54] circumstance. Oh, caught in a very adult
[1:23:58] act of adultery, Lord. They were so
[1:24:00] ready to crucify and to kill and to
[1:24:02] stone. Their hearts were full like
[1:24:04] stones, Lord. But you didn't make us
[1:24:07] that, Lord. You created us a different
[1:24:09] kind of being. One that went look at
[1:24:12] people and see that they're totally
[1:24:14] lost, Father. And then you put this
[1:24:16] burden upon us, Lord, to finish your
[1:24:19] work, Lord. But your
[1:24:21] burden, it's not heavy, Lord. It is
[1:24:23] light. Because all we want to do is
[1:24:26] introduce them to the life that you've
[1:24:27] introduced us to. And Father, I pray
[1:24:30] that you'll give us boldness and
[1:24:31] courage, Lord, to go forth, Lord, and
[1:24:34] speak like we should and pray for our
[1:24:36] food, Lord, and pray over our people
[1:24:38] that we know and and be Christians,
[1:24:41] Lord, and with a backbone and some some
[1:24:43] strength in us, Lord, rugged ones, Lord,
[1:24:46] and like like Daniel, Father, if I think
[1:24:49] about or Daniel, or I think about the
[1:24:51] three men in the fire, Lord, where they
[1:24:53] just went before the king and say,
[1:24:55] "We're not slow to answer thee, Lord,
[1:24:58] King will rather die before we bow our
[1:25:01] knees to some
[1:25:03] God. They they didn't go and try to save
[1:25:05] him. They just said what it is. It's
[1:25:07] marching orders. Lord, when we get to
[1:25:10] work and we hear about someone that's
[1:25:12] sick, Lord, you've placed us there for a
[1:25:14] reason. We can pray. We can heal. We can
[1:25:17] help. Lord, Father, but we ask that you
[1:25:19] would lead us in such a way that it will
[1:25:21] not come by feeling, Lord, but only by
[1:25:24] your word, Lord, and by fellowship with
[1:25:26] you, Father. Because Lord, we don't want
[1:25:28] to just go around and lay hands on
[1:25:30] everyone and pray for them and and make
[1:25:32] it all confusing. Lord, we want your
[1:25:34] will, the thus sayith the Lord. That's
[1:25:36] through the bride. We want to know which
[1:25:38] ones is the ones you want us to to go
[1:25:40] to, Father. And I pray that each one of
[1:25:43] us would realize that, Lord, tonight
[1:25:45] that you've placed a great great gift in
[1:25:48] our life. It's called the Holy Spirit.
[1:25:51] It's called you, Lord. that you've given
[1:25:53] us the gift of life that you've given,
[1:25:55] Lord, at the day of Calvary, Lord, when
[1:25:57] you laid your your life down for us,
[1:26:00] Father, so that you could come in the
[1:26:01] multimember body, Lord, and you can fill
[1:26:04] us up with your love and you can finish
[1:26:05] the work that when you were here on
[1:26:07] earth to save the s to heal the sick, to
[1:26:10] save the the ones that's lost, Lord, to
[1:26:13] give the blind their sight back, Lord,
[1:26:15] spiritually and naturally, Lord, we
[1:26:17] believe in both of them, Father, to to
[1:26:19] let the dumb speak, Father, You gave
[1:26:22] that to us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:25] Lord, may we go out and fulfill what you
[1:26:27] said in Mark 16, Lord, that we will go
[1:26:30] into all the world and speak to every
[1:26:33] creature, Lord. That we look different
[1:26:35] in who we are and and even see when a
[1:26:38] creature is in help, Lord, that our
[1:26:39] prayer would work. It was through the
[1:26:41] life of the prophet Lord that we see
[1:26:43] that the possum was healed Lord that the
[1:26:46] fish got its life back that squirrels
[1:26:48] came into existence that storms was
[1:26:50] broken Lord. It is a true testimony a
[1:26:53] wave offering Lord of what this message
[1:26:56] can produce when we go to
[1:26:59] Christ. Lord I pray Lord that you would
[1:27:02] give us that boldness and that strength
[1:27:04] to go and and to represent your kingdom
[1:27:07] as true stewards. Lord, if we haven't
[1:27:09] done it, I ask, Lord, that you would
[1:27:11] forgive us for that, Lord. And you would
[1:27:13] we just consecrate ourselves back to
[1:27:15] you, Lord, and say, Lord, we come, Lord,
[1:27:18] and we want to be your servants, Father,
[1:27:21] and we want to be lower than, Lord,
[1:27:23] anybody else, so that we can come inness
[1:27:26] and win souls to Christ. Lord, Brother
[1:27:29] Brandham said, and I wanted to put the
[1:27:30] quote up, but Brother Brandham said, you
[1:27:32] can preach hell, fire, and brimstone. It
[1:27:34] wouldn't change them because they got so
[1:27:36] lost in the world. But Lord, if we
[1:27:38] preach Christ, if we preach hope and
[1:27:41] love and and Lord, that you heal and
[1:27:44] you're a father, Lord, and and a
[1:27:46] redeemer, Lord Jesus, and we we come
[1:27:48] with love, Lord Jesus, you can get the
[1:27:50] preeminence in our lives, Lord. And and
[1:27:53] our speech don't betray us, Lord. And
[1:27:54] that and it does, Lord. It says that
[1:27:56] we've been with
[1:27:57] Jesus, Lord. You were lifted up and you
[1:28:00] drew all men to yourself, Father. So let
[1:28:03] us Lord just lift you up Lord so you can
[1:28:05] draw all men to you as well. We pray
[1:28:08] Lord. And if we haven't done it, we say
[1:28:10] Lord please once more give us that
[1:28:12] chance. Father lead us by your Holy
[1:28:14] Ghost and where we get that last one so
[1:28:16] we can go home. Father, I pray this in
[1:28:19] the mighty name of our Lord Jesus
[1:28:21] Christ. Amen and
[1:28:23] amen. Amen. Thank you, brother
[1:28:29] Isaac. Amen. Let's just um stand. Um
[1:28:31] this evening we'll sing

[1:30:07] washed my sins away. And he cast him in
[1:30:11] the bottom of the
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:14] sea. He picked me up and he turned me
[1:30:17] round. Set my feet on higher ground. Now
