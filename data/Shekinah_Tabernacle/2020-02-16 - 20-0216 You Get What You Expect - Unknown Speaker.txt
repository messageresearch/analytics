Jesus shall we then okey that you begin but anyway bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin all bring them [Music] I'll bring the little ones to Jesus I mean aren't you glad we can we can bring our little ones to the Lord even before the world could even get us the devil get us filthy hands on them maybe we can put them in the hands of our Lord Jesus Christ so I mean it's a great privilege to have Norma and Damona here god bless you it's wonderful to have you here so this is a wonderful day I mean faith victorious true amen praise the Lord what a name you know the I like to look into name definitions meanings we know faith faith as it denotes an unquestioning belief and complete trust in God I thought was interesting the the name faith became very popular among the 17th century Puritans now we know the Puritans they left the old world Europe to go to America to found a new nation to leave the oppression of the church systems to worship God and in spirit and truth I was thinking that's you guys you didn't know what you're looking for but God knew God knew why you're here it's not men that made you a believer God did he found a new life here his life an economic life for you life in him that means I thought that's very fitting and we know Victoria it means victory hallelujah this is in first John five and four you want to if you got your Bibles handy if not if you want to put that up on the screen first John five and in verse 4 it says for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so our faith gives us the victory over the world so I thought what a name for this little one I mean she's got a real faith a revelation in Jesus Christ and this is going to give her the victory and give her a body change hallelujah so you know we know the scripture has there's nothing in Scripture to baptize or sprinkle babies but as you know you know the little ones were given to Jesus and he would take them up in his hands and he would bless them and so since that's the scriptural way this is how we dedicate children to the Lord so and Melissa have little faith victorious terrific Amen what a little one praise the Lord for this new life let's bow our head shall we gracious father glory Lord we thank you dear God for this Lord this gift of love that's coming to the true egg home Lord as even as they would come to this work landlord may be looking for a bit of life but they found their bit of life in you Lord I believe this little one is just testimony of that Lord of her name Lord of faith victorious cheering oh god father Lord my hands are very poor substitute for yours but you're the same Jesus and Lord we lift her life and your presence asking law that you would give her a victorious walk even from just now our God makes you have such a faith Lord she may not be able to speak even comprehend what's around it but Lord makes you just know your presence Lord father may she just be so used to living in an atmosphere of your Holy Ghost there goddamnit calling from a young age dear Lord and father give us such a revelation such a faith Lord they will overcome this world that will paralyze whatever the devil try and put on her and drag her away Lord she'd walk a victorious walk Lord Jesus father then Lord we believe she's going to be one of those that will Lord walk with you will be not because you'll take them to glory far those which are alive and remain to the Lord we dedicate faith Victoria stirring into your hands Lord she belongs to you lord thank you for this love gift Lord we dedicate our into your care father in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you amen okay we're doing this I mean I mean pays a lot oh oh all right ma'am I mean god bless you

would be stopped we don't just have to hear a virus we don't just have a little virus live its course we have someone that can disrupt us life I bet so you know let's just remember them in prayer and let's just dedicate the service of the Lord shall we if you ever need you know we're just not here to go through a motion but if you don't need you just want to talk to the Lord about it as we pray gracious Almighty God Lord as we stand in your presence this morning with such Thanksgiving law because you took all our sins away you're the one who has redeemed us back to yourself Lord you're the victorious one that rose in conquered hell death and the grave and the devil is still defeated today as he was two thousand years ago when you roved Lord when you arose triumphant and father we just want to lift Lord Lord your your children and China Lord father everyone in China into your presence Lord by prayer father there's a lot of suffering going on because of this virus and Lord we know

may we all be covered in your blood just now father lord not just now but now for eternity O God granted dear Lord bless of service and Jesus Christ name Amen amen god bless you friends let's turn to judges chapter 8 and we're gonna also go to Luke chapter 18 but so I don't have a slideshow but if we if we just go to judges 8 and verse 10 that would be I want to I want to continue on the thought about standing on the knee nikka the enemy having complete dominion but I want to call this one if I can call it you get what you expect if you if you have come expecting something to criticize well I've already probably given you more than enough to criticize but God chosen his great wisdom to use the foolishness of preaching and he would give us all quirks in our humanity and now so you know for you just look beyond that today you know and let's just let's just really enter in and who has a need who has a real need this service could change your life forever I believe we don't just gather just to go through a religious motion but this this one moment you know we're gonna go through a lot of moments in the scripture where people's lives will change forever others weren't changed but others were so we want to be on that side of the margin of the ones that were changed forever so we got to let's go to judges and chapter 8 we're gonna read from verse 10 he says now this notice this is just after Gideon has won as great victory over the hosts of the east and your mighty things have been done but now notice us now zebah and zalmunna were were Krakow and there if you I don't know how to pronounce these names to just forgive me there's nothing you can criticize you can't read I know and their hosts with them about 15,000 men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east and there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword and Gideon went out by the way of them that dwell in tents on the east of Nova and a job better and smoked the host for the hosts was secure and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of myth Midian zebah and zalmunna and discomforted all the hosts and Gideon the son of joash returned from the battle before the Sun was up and caught a young man of the men of Zhukov and inquired of him and and he described under them the princes of Zhukov and the eldest heir of even threescore and seventeen men and he came unto the men of Zhukov and said Behold zebah and zalmunna with whom you did upbraid me saying other hands of zebah and zalmunna now on thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary and he took the elders of the city and the thorns of the wilderness and briars and with them he taught them in of Zhukov and he beat down the tower of pinyon and slew them into the city then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were they whom you slew at table and they answered as thou art and so were they each one resembled the child of a king and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the Lord loveth if ye had saved them alive would not slay you and he said aren't you Jo his firstborn up and slayed him but the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth let's go to Luke 18 in verse 35 and this is probably a more of a familiar scripture to you speaking of of blind bartimaeus it's a Luke 18 and verse 35 and these things will by the grace of God they'll tied together maybe I just got too much I want to give but I don't know we'll see how we go and that came to pass that as he was working I on to Jericho a certain blind man set by the wayside begging and he heard the multitude passed by and asked what it meant and they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by and he cried saying Jesus our son of David have mercy on me and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto Him and when he was come near he asked him saying what will they'll that I should do unto thee and he said Lord that I may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight I faith a save thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto God I mean you may bless I mean made a little Bliss's word you may have your seats this morning so I want to speak about you get what you expect now we must never never never have a preconceived idea of how church service will go we must never have a preconceived idea well this is we're gonna sing this long the song leader it's the song leaders he's gonna sing this certain way and he's gonna pray a certain way and they're gonna play a certain way then the preacher will get up he's gonna preach a certain way and he moves his hands a certain way and you know you know you know we should never have a preconceived idea how the church services goes I mean we have not you know we are not here just to go through the motion of having a service I trust you didn't just come here just to have Church I meant some of us probably though are already thinking about what's gonna be for lunch and what they must do tomorrow this coming weak no doubt some of us are already thinking about its stomachs and I say you don't ever go down that line of thought because lunch will come there will be something to eat tomorrow is going to happen unless the Lord takes us away tomorrow will happen right so don't worry about those things they will happen but there is a we must understand there is a big difference in coming to church and coming to church right there is a big difference between just coming here sitting going through the motion you know some of us come you know there's a certain way of doing things and you can still live below your privilege we're sons and daughters of God we're redeemed we're being washed in the blood all things are under our feet I mean we have the victory I mean but we so we don't want to live under our privilege just go through the motion you know some of us were thinking oh I just want to hear a good thought it's more than that I want to hear something new it's more than that I want to hear a lot of quotes more than that I want to sing my favorite songs it's more than that I mean but if you come with that expectation that is all you'll receive some of us just come expecting to hear what we've been fellowshipping about during the week is going to come over the pulpit it's more than that I mean it's more than just going through the motion I think we need our faith to be challenged I mean we should really step out you say well you know people have an expectation how things will go like camp people had an expectation some people really got what they needed others expectation was met but it wasn't what they really needed you know some people just expect well we're gonna have a big emotional time God's going to move in a powerful way it's got to be more than just God moving to you right blind bartimaeus would be sitting there you know against the wall there and he's trying to brother bran would dramatize it to make it more alive and you know you know he would say the brother bro yeah you're the blind Bartimaeus he would lean up against the stonework of Jericho there to warm himself because the Sun you know heat was absorbed into the wall and he'll be warming himself against the wall and he was blind but but before he went blind his mother would tell him of the great heroes of faith that walk through Jericho States she would tell him about Joshua and the mighty thinks Joshua did and how he stopped the Sun and the moon and how they walked around the walls of Jericho and they took the city and you know she would tell them about Rahab and the mighty thing she did by faith applying the token and gathering everyone under the message of the hour that they would receive eternal life and you know you know she would tell them about Elijah walking here and Elijah and all the mighty things God did but he only knew up to that point of God of history and many of us just know a god of history where we would go or brother Brown did this and you can maybe read in the scripture yes Jesus did that 2,000 years ago or maybe 50 years ago but what about today I mean he's not a historical god I mean the gospel does not make us good historians and then we know what good does a historical God do to us it does us no good whatsoever I'm in his but the Bible says he is the same yesterday today and forever that he does not change that he's the very much the same God back then as he is today and so he would be there and then you know we know where Jesus is there's always a whole bunch of noise and there were a lot of people that were gathered around here here was Jesus Christ the Son of man he was on his way to Calvary he had already walked he had died most most of his earthly journey here and he was on his way to Calvary and here was a man with a neat he said how does that apply to us we're at the last we're at the end of the seventh church age I mean Jesus Christ has been walking through his church as he's shown in the book of Revelation River at the end and now he's going to turn his attention fully to the Jews but before he does that the bride's going in a rapture I mean so here he is he's finishing his ministry through the Gentiles he's about to turn to the Jews just like Jesus had basically finished his earthly ministry and he's about to go to Calvary and here was a man who needed more than a nice church service here was the man that this was the last time God would walk through his City in this way he was never going to return in that form to Jericho he needed more than a nice idea he needed more than just his mama's stories of the Bible though those were good I mean but so he was there and when he heard this great noise he had began to ask the question what's going on what's going on and and then he was told as Jesus of Nazareth and he began to realize the stories that his mother told him about of God living in those people's days he began to realize thank God was now walking right in front of him and he began to realize I mean he was now about to step into a Bible story but now he was one of the main characters hallelujah is more than just him talking about someone he was now part of it and he began to cry out Amen Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me he was not gonna let this pass him by he was determined I mean he was something in him said that God that I worship can heal my eyes color and he began to cry out he didn't care what the others said they even told him to shut up but he would not shut up because he realized this is my opportunity I'm not going to let someone rob me I mean of what God can do for me now and that same son of man is walking in our midst even now I mean we have to recognize his presence and not just be anointed and enjoy it but get what we need many people you imagine going there where Jesus was who had been such a presence here was the fullness of God here baldly was now in flesh the Creator was walking around upon the earth more than a prophet more than a religious man he was God you imagine the atmosphere that he carries part of the atmospheric air imagine stepping into that presence many people stepped into his presence they didn't get what they needed you think about people like Pilate Pilate didn't find Jesus Jesus found Pilate but there it was as the governor of the area you know and because of he wanted to keep us standing in the political pressure he tried to wash his hands of Jesus he had two opportunities to fall at Jesus feet he had two opportunities his life could have been changed forever he heard about what Jesus had done it was noise through the city it wasn't down in the corner I say this message wasn't done in a corner either I mean God's alive how Louie's done incredible things in our day and we need to recognize he's done incredible things so so Jesus came to Pilate but he wasn't willing to he didn't get what he needed a lot of he say but he was a Roman scribes and Pharisees huh ground Jesus they knew the scripture really well then you're better than your own I write edits in the original language they knew how it was all meant to happen but they just criticized them they see it away with this fellow will keep our religion now brother Brahim sees an incredible statement this isn't this isn't my my if I can find it here Amen I'm already let's go back here no wait there we go he says this he says this and I will restore say at the Lord he says so if you want to get close to God just real close just get close to love just love God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind with all your strength just wrap yourself in a bundle of love who wants to be like that watch the man that you that you that didn't like you did you ever get around somebody you've seen nice people that you can't hardly stand to be around them now you know that's right I've seen people that maybe that you just love to be in their presence haven't you seen people like that he says do you realize that your sons of God the atmosphere and the air that you live in you create a situation around you that either draws or pushes away so the kind of atmosphere that you make at either draws or pushes away it's your attitude well what what do you mean by an atmosphere or kind of situation you create it's your attitude it's your attitude creates the atmosphere around you who's ever worked or gone to school or someone who's got a stink attitude always fussing and complaining and this is wrong get all everything's negative or they create an atmosphere around them they create an atmosphere cuz it's their attitude towards what's going on but who's also ever been to work with someone who been to school or someone who's just here but positive friendly helpful outgoing thoughtful they create an atmosphere and those two people can can be facing the same situation but it's their attitude towards what's going on will actually produce an atmosphere around them so their attitude a man will either draw or push away now I just ask the question now what about your attitude what about the atmosphere you create around you does it draw God on the scene I'm not talking about pushing away or drawing the world I'm saying does your atmosphere does it draw God down even in the service this morning I mean the attitude that you're looking at me worth amen either draw God on the scene you know church is an incredible thing I mean it's more than just going through emotion more than just hearing preaching but God can come down at a far greater way in services I mean there's been testimony after testimony people being healed people coming out of wheelchairs cancers going people receiving eternal life demons being cast out because they come to church hallelujah the Bible says forsake not the assembling of ourselves together so much more as we see that Day approaching why cuz when God's children come together and they begin to worship we begin to cry atmosphere god you're so good god is good all the time he put a song of praise in this heart of mine how good you are Lord you wash me of my sins you've set me free I mean I've been redeemed I'll be redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I'm going in a rapture hallelujah I'm it creates an atmosphere and God says I'm enduring that atmosphere high it's more than just angels gathering to worship God's free God steps down in the middle of their worship hallelujah how they because Jesus says where two or three gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them so he's between you and me he's between you and me he's between you and the person next year God's present and if we could just recognize his presence among us holy I believe what could change your whole life amen we should never ever diminish coming to church and the potential of what could happen because we know we're living in a day and age where all things are possible to them that belief and there is no cap on what we can believe all things are possible to them move to to them that belief amen so the atmosphere you create that I love draws God or pushes them away remember the scribes and Pharisees were religious people they weren't atheists they believed in Jehovah God but now that Jehovah God became flesh in Jesus Christ and their atmosphere was actually pushing him I mean but there were other blind people no doubt in Jericho and blind Bartimaeus was there he wouldn't have been the only case there would have been other beggars other blind but the atmosphere he created when he recognized he was stepping into the pages of the scripture and and his God was there at drew him and drew the Lord to him O God may we draw you may we draw you to where we are where you come and meet our needs may this be more than Church more than going through a motion or more than just having a may be a happy time look we want to draw you down I mean to where we are I tell you don't let the devil stop you don't let the devil stop you the devil tried to stop blind bartimaeus he anointed people to say be quiet don't call out to him just want you go by but he said no devil if you're getting opposition that's because there's a blessing for you to receive maybe if you're receiving opposition hears because the devil is trying to ward you off from what you need hallelujah Amen well how do I create an atmosphere that pushes them away we begin to think wins this man going to finish this is boring why do these people get excited it's all the motion really is this really just a motion why do mom and dad have to drag us to this place this is creating atmosphere in your mind that pushes them away man when I get older I'm out of here that pushes God away there's nothing satisfying in this world I mean we've all hallelujah I know the questions asked many times but you know for all of us that came out you know here's a question who was actually raised as a message believer here I mean as no parents now appearance not many not many then why is the majority of us who were in the world here if the world is so glorious because nothing out there can satisfy you say if I just get the right job on the right car in the right house and the right girlfriend on the right hobby I'll be satisfied Oh No you know maybe for a season but then the emptiness of it just just just you just realize the emptiness of it you can have all the money in the world but it'll come to an end haloo you see the guy who who who runs amazon east you know left his wife ran off with some other woman bought this big hundred and sixty three million dollar mansion wherever and you're done all the stuff there's nothing satisfied there's nothing satisfying in his life unfortunately he's trying to buy it with money and experiences and things and you know there's nothing satisfying there cuz you just go from one thing to another thing to another thing but those who meet Jesus it's more than a story those that really meet him it doesn't matter mimic godliness with contentment is if you have godliness and you'll content with the position you have member the world wants to make you a lot of things it wants to push you into a certain mold you know maybe it's a sports tower or rock star a movie star whatever it may be maybe just a very successful businessman or Kremen what's the push into a certain mold and this is how you have to be I say this is how we should be hallelujah I've met people Amen that have virtually nothing and they're the happiest people have ever met hallelujah because they're not looking for the big house and the big job and the big car and the big big big ears about that stuff I mean if you know him you have everything but if you don't know him you have nothing it's really that simple you say well I've got a bit of religion that'll just make you miserable I mean you've got to trade your religion for him and once you meet him I'm talking about more than just even more than just giving a confession of faith more than just repenting even more than getting baptized right but when you meet him amen it will satisfy like nothing else can satisfy hallelujah well how do you know that I've been there you all know my story I was out in the world I was lost as lost as lost could be I was written off probably by everyone in this room would would have written me off but he came this message came my way and the god I heard about came into out of history hallelujah so I don't want a kind of attitude that pushes God away I want one that brings him on the scene hallelujah because it's your response your response and what you talk about will either push him away or broke him close brother brand would tell the story of when he was he was out fishing with with a couple of a couple of brothers the woods boys they all they were they were formerly Jehovah Witness and they meet the Lord and and and they're out fishing and and they were talking about how how one was speaking to another about how they should go meet an older sister you know you know that you know that was belong to the Church of God and and and they said we ought to go and tell her that we got saved they're just fishing heavier conversation we should go tell her how we got saved and then and their brother had says you know there's just certain things that you can say we can say that just takes a hold with the Holy Spirit just certain things that pleases him right just right and when we say that thing I want you to notice well you say if we can just find what to say your word judges you your word condemns you or your word will bless you and unconsciously banks must have said the right thing that's banks would and and no more after he said that I was sitting in the back of the boat fishing with a fly line for a little bluegill fish to put one on the line for bait we'd run out of bait and I was just catching these little fish and putting them in the bucket for the truck line and when bank said that all of a sudden something struck me he said the right thing and the Holy Ghost spoke out and said thus saith the Lord you'll find in the next few hours will be a resurrection of a little animal and we know that little fishy came back to life when God came down so he said the right thing I'll say this if that's just fishing how much more in church I mean when God comes down and begins to anoint the ministry and anoint your life and you begin to respond to the word amen and something you can say how you respond can cause God to come upon the scene for you I mean we know the story of brother Branham when he was speaking when he would share the share the experiences about how he helped how the Lord challenged him that day on the scripture of whatsoever things ye say if he said to this mountain be thou removed cosna see it's yeah it'll happen if you believe and God challenged them he said what do you have Nieto he says well I'm squirrel hunting well how many do you want and then and then brother man took God at the challenge and by the creative power of God those squirrels were created and then now when he's relaying this story on a little farm there where where he was to actually to try and return an offering to the family because they are so poor and he felt so bad about them and their offering they gave and and brother bands relating the story and then the mother there at the farm sister Hedy right said that's nothing but the truth and God came down and said sister Hattie whatever you ask right now whatever you asked for you'll receive it and if you don't receive it call me a false prophet and so she sitting there under that anointing saying no what you're asked for you know because there were her old appearance her sister was in a wheelchair now poor people you know but maybe you could ask for a million dollars it'll fall in your lap but because she in her heart was the salvation of her two boys and those two boys were not even interested in what was going on and she said I want the salvation of my two sons and brother says I give it to you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and those boys who are laughing and snickering amen Kame fell on their lap of their mother gave their lives to Jesus Christ and became Christians why because she said the right thing it's more than a story our faith needs to be challenged we can't limit God we can't limit God you say well that happened to her and I'm not back there but the same Jesus is here that same resurrected one is walking among us we need to recognize his presence and not just recognize her but act on it hallelujah what is this got to do with the son of Gideon not killing those kings we'll get there we're just taking a journey amen so we've we got to respond the right way your atmosphere either push of away or draw Oh Lord may we draw you there was a little boy walking along there and Jesus was having a big meeting in their head no food and he he had a few loaves and a few fishes and maybe he was on his way to school or know where he was going but he he had this food and he's walking along and he begins to see a crowd and you know a crowd always draws a crowd so he begin there because people are nosy he begin to go see what's going on and he came unto the under the voice of the master he heard the Lord Jesus and in the Lord began to speak about yeah let's go send the people away that they can eat and the disciples begin to say but you know there's nowhere around where you're in the wilderness they'll faint on the way then something in that little boy said here's my lunch here's my lunch this is all he had and then the Lord took it cause he's the crater began to bless it and multiplied in it and it became just a more than just one little lunch but it fed 5,000 men and woman and children you know five thousand men and besides woman and children now he gave his lunch to the Lord and it feared a multitude I say this how much more if we give us whole your whole life to him I mean he's here more just to feed people I mean he's here more than just to you know feed people and nourish them physically how much more if you give you a whole life then what he could do in your lives I mean you could shake the world in your generation I mean we just heard the song this morning we are the generation the final voice of the final age it's got to become more than a song I want to challenge you this morning let God challenge you let him challenge your faith it's gonna be more than a song it's gotta be no more than just some not nice item it's gonna live it's got to become a living reality I mean where your life you don't have to go and sing that song but your life is where I'm power that chosen generation he chose me before the foundation of the world it's not my goodness I'm a Christian it is goodness and start my own let's not him that willful runs but God that's just mercy it's not even my will I would never want to be here a few years ago you would you wouldn't catch me in this place but God found me God found me hallelujah that's got to be more than a song so how much more if we could just give her whole lives not just a part of our lives the whole bit the whole bit to him what could he do see that's the thing and the disciples was a predestinated seed and the history of the world was changed because of those men history of the world history of the world was changed because the Apostle Paul he's one of the most famous people in history because he changed the world one man what about you you say well you're talking about a rapture being soon but it may not be I mean we should live like it's now but also we should live like this in a hundred years time we should plan for our future there's nothing wrong with that but don't get so caught up in earthly things but what about you what about you he say I'm just a little insignificant Peter was a fisherman he wasn't the celebrity of the earth he wasn't in the temple he wasn't part of the height yo Kev's is the high priests entourage you're the celebrity you would never have seen his name in the in the in the newspaper or some web site you know Peter goes and does this and he fishes here it catches this much it was not there but God saw him God saw him God used him God took the world with a little fisherman what about you he said but I'm a man I can't preach your life can soak the world there's one of the evangelists and I think it was George Whitfield I might be wrong but there was a there was a I think you know there's a sister there that couldn't walk and she would sit in a chair and apparently her testimony of how she conducted herself even under great difficulty not being able to walk saved many many people and they actually don't know if the pulpit or her chair was the greater witness to the world what about you what about what God could do in your life he say I'm waiting for something don't let the devil hold you back the son of Gideon was afraid to actually put his hand to the sword it was easy to watch his dad have the victory it was easy to watch the older generation have the victories but when he had to come to his place he was afraid it's how are you putting a lot of pressure let God press you sometimes pressure is good sometimes to be challenged as good you're the biggest problem in this country as we just she'll be right she'll be right mentality God has it all in control so yes she'll be right but not in the way New Zeeland says she'll be right our lives from the palm our names are in the palm of his hands engraved I mean we're part of him so it can't lose us so she'll be right hallelujah he can't lose part of himself but the thing is we can't just sit back and say well whoever if I'm predestinated I'll be there I'm not producing I won't be there never ever think that way if I am pre-decide to receive the full inheritance of God I want it now amen he said well and then the devil says now you not producer but the but jesus said all that come to me I'll no wise cast out if it's there without money or price wouldn't you want it hallelujah you know people who play lotto and I trust no one does here you know but but there's always you know it says comes the news that the jackpots been unclaimed do you not think people take the tickets and go see if the other winner do you think people don't do that because they think all this might be me now this is more than lotto yes I mean but but but when it's put before you you'll hear to stand on the neck of the enemy you're here to have a victorious war the raptures yours I'd go see if my ticket works I remember with the Lord your ticket always works cuz all that comes me or no wise cast out amen hallelujah along with the bladder chute you know these stories well but we're just gonna go here for a bit the woman with the bladder shoe 14 years she had this problem the doctors couldn't help her nothing wrong with doctors nothing could help her she needed more than a nice church service I mean she needed more she needed more than just you know another man to tell her something she needed that to be fixed she got to a point in her life where this must come to an end and when she heard that there was a man who was walking on the on the earth I mean that racer did that healed the sick I mean that that calm the storms something in her said I must get to him I must get to him and she pushed her all the throng of all the people she didn't care how they're behaving she didn't listen to the critic she didn't worry about anyone else she just got through just touched the hem of his garment she got what she needed she got what she needed it wasn't just another service that was her service I mean it should be the same thing with us this morning more than a service this is my service hallelujah hallelujah and she got what she needed there's a blonde girl in Memphis brother Brown was preaching down there there are segregation down in the south and she was a she was a colored girl and she lost her mama or her daddy and brother brems coming out of the whither meeting is and she's standing there crying out Dada Dada how are you she's blind she can't see and something in brother Brahim caused to caused him to go beyond the segregation line and and actually she actually put her put himself in her path so she she bumped into him sometimes we just bump into God but God actually puts himself on our pathway just kind of like today God's coming your pathway amen and so so she's walking along bunk bumps into him and then and then they begin to speaking and she begins to you know say I'm looking for my daddy and yo can you help me find you know help me find my daddy and and then he begins to ask pretending that he's not the one why are you here well yeah we heard on the radio that your your man got healed of us sites we got on the bus and we came here to the meeting and I've come here to be prayed for but where's my daddy and their brother max he says to her do you really think do you really think that this you can be healed and she just says to a mister you just give me to that preacher I'll get healed and I'll find my own daddy oh that's a face of a little girl remember you get what you expect this is not two thousand years ago this is this is in our generation right and then and then he said well actually I'm that preacher and she grabbed his lapels and began to cry Jesus Jesus heal me hallelujah and the conclusion of this thing was she didn't walk away blind I mean that was her meeting hallelujah that was her service because she got what she needed hallelujah there was the Catholic woman of Mexico when brother Aaron was down to Mexico and she had a little baby these are more than just stories don't just don't put it in history whatever you do this is God putting it before you I'm still the same I mean my blood still works salvation is still a reality the Holy Ghost is still present to receive I mean you're not living yo you're still living in Bible days that's why I was done to show you I'm alive and there was the Catholic woman and she she had a baby in and and the baby was sick and that morning she took him to the doctor the baby was dieter and the doctor told the told the mother no doubt trying to console her the best he could I'm sorry but your your baby's dead you got to go bury their baby something in her said no I'm not gonna be real and she wrapped it up and she went into that meeting and she was determined she was determined if I can just get this baby up to where that manners that's Jesus that he's been preaching about now I've seen do miracles he can raise this baby she didn't have a prayer card she'd have no way to get and she was trying to push her all the ashes on the Deacons you just a little woman she was determined that life must come back to my child the doctor said bear but she says no to live just a little Catholic well how much for you Jesus the Catholic woman how much were the Bride of Christ how much more those who know he's real who've experienced some real at minim hallelujah how much for you so she pushed through all the ashes everything yeah all that's going on and brother brems since the jack more says you just go pray for her because she doesn't know who I am and but then he saw a vision of the baby coming back to life he says they'll hold on bring her up here and they trying to brother BAM she does have a pre-cut now I've seen a vision oh it's different she comes up with a crucifix and Padre and all these things and you because he's Catholic and he sees nothing you don't need none of that picks the baby up against the pray who calls the baby to come back to life it was her faith it was her faith Amen her faith said the child will live and the baby was cold and did come back to life again and he gave it back to her hallelujah healthy strong and well that's more than a story we've had no a wall that was in the 50s we've had people come to our camps and they've had a decision they had to make as this message really true or am I just going to go to a Pentecostal church they come with this you know Bethenny read our first camp remember that she came with that burden on her heart and and this was she she brought God down to a showdown if you don't prove yourself to me in this camp I'm leaving God's grace God's grace to zeal X because when you actually I'll put it that this may be the wrong way to say it but if you challenge God at His Word he loves a challenge God are you really real he'll say I'll show you I'll show you you on my life I'm show you my word is true and she came to that camp and and and she had that burden on her heart I'll just say this she left knowing that this message is right Shiekh she left knowing that Jesus Christ is alive and this message is more than doctrine more than rights Jesus Christ alive today Halle and she's still I believe it today we're made more than just her do that we've had more but others came to the camp just thinking we're gonna have camp but she came with a need saying I must meet him in this time now say what about you this morning yeah I'm preaching to myself you just happen to be here I want more than just Church I want more than just nice sermons more than you saw that's a nice thought more than a nice thought I want more than that I want God to live I want the third pool to be full and in full manifestation he sell but the squeeze has got to come on whipping squeezes we're being squeezed I mentioned in the illness in the youth group this morning you know the Jews weren't one morning free in Europe the next morning and Auschwitz being exterminated as squeeze came on them a squeeze came on them and what was done in the physical to them spiritually we've done against the Bride of Christ and we are being squeezed what that sounds like a bad thing no no no it just brings out what's in you if the overcomers in you you'll overcome he says just watch the third Paul when that squeeze comes in what's done being done and temporarily well we come to the fullness of its power God wants to take you yeah this is not for preachers this is not just for preachers deacons musicians this is for everyone amen that God would live hallelujah now let's go he sees this here he says now every one of you not only ministers but all of you ought to pray for these people so people who are sick of need you don't know what God might do for you while you pray for somebody else what if you say the right thing here's a woman standing here she's so sick they have to hold her up what if your prayer would be the right thing just like bank said the right thing had he said the right thing what if you would say the right thing your prayer to cause God to come down and do something see it's not just one person this is the Church of the Living God amen now we come to Gideon son here get in I believe wanted the younger generation to have part of the victory then it wasn't just the adults no more it wasn't that now when I was thinking about young people and being a young person I'm not talking about just physically being young right so I'm not just talking about our youth I'm talk about everyone here you got to put you you got to draw your sword right this is not by association you'll get the victory you've got to address your enemy you've got to deal with them you've got to put him to death I've talked about spurts now remember yep so Gideon so he wanted the younger generation to have his hand in this victory but fear stopped them from killing a defeated foe remember the kings those two kings see it arise and slay us amen they they were already reconciled they had already come to the fact that they're going to die they had been conquered there was no way of escape for them they knew they had lost and they knew that they were going to die so they even instructed them saying arise and slay us that we read that now let's go no we didn't get that far let's go down back-to-back the judges ate again and we go to verse 21 we didn't get the verse 21 now remember the enemy has already said to Gideon that the people they slew that were relatives of Gideon they all look like children of a king and this is this is now the devil this is now the devil's testimony of the believers they all look like Kings children Kings have Dominion right they're the top not the bottom so he's saying oh this is the kind of people they were they were royalty and we are a rural nation a holy nation right a royal priesthood the Lord's made us thus so this is the kind of people they were but then he says that that he was afraid to slam because because he feared because he was yet a youth and then now listen verse 21 then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the manners so as his strength and Gideon arose in slough zebah and zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels neck so so they were actually calling kill us they knew that they were done you know the devil knows he's done you know the devil actually knows his time is coming to an end how many times when the devil is about to be cast out when Jesus was they said have you come to torment us before the time have you actually come before we know our times coming but have you come to torment us before that time that he knows his expiry date has come to an end he knows that he's gonna burn he fights it he fights it with everything that's worth in him but he knows it's going to happen now brother Ben would say I'm positioning the gate to the enemy after trial now we are more than conquerors churches amen we just walked right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated oh my I wish I was twice my size now maybe I feel twice as good we disputing worth a conquered enemy so the enemy that fights you has already been conquered he's already been defeated but you have to put him on his place I mean no wonder Paul could say when our building a block two choppers head office is o death where is your sting now show me where you can make me squirm and scream grave where is your victory and and you think you'll mold me out there I'll point you to an empty one over there and and I am in him and he he'll raise me up at the last day a defeated enemy we're disputing with a defeated enemy remember the devil still doesn't have the keys to his own house he'd still the yes has lost its sting the grave has no victory no more it still doesn't have a victory today amen we are just as victorious the bride is just as victorious now as she was then because the Lord is still the victorious one I mean so we're we are disputing with a defeated enemy now we read last week in Joshua chapter 10 where he called us captains when he took the five kings of the country there brought them out of the cave that they'll hold up and and they too and he told his captains to stand upon the neck of the enemy and then they hung them that killed them and he said thus shall it be he says fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies whom you fight so you will have total victory over all the enemies that you fight against that spirit that plagues you hallelujah you'll have victory I mean that unbelief that bothers you you'll have victory I mean those things that you know take your imagination off into really dark places you'll have victory over it if you're willing to kill it brother Bram said you're gonna kill your enemy or your enemy will kill you amen I'll say this with great absolutely with sadness how many people have we seen coming to among the believers and instead of killing the spirit that's beaten them down and getting rid of the thing they just hold it captive hostages are expensive to maintain right huh prisoners of war are actually expensive thing to look after and the propers if you hold something prisoner up again could be can begin to influence you again it can begin to whisper in your ear oh I've got the minion of this but it whispers in your ear it's not dead right it's not dead it still speaks to you and eventually if you can come under its influence again and it can drag you out back out into slavery how many people have we seen that happen to they know they've got to die to a certain thing but the problem is they still have an affectionate memory of what it you should do with them you gotta hate sin you gotta hate spirits if you if you slap all but I used to be something when I was under that anointing you'll never be free of it it will hold you captive even if you say you have a captive you have to hate the thing that dragged you got to hate your unbelief I mean you've got to hate the sin that drags you down you've got to hate your enemy brother Ram said the devil hates me I hate him too there are things we're allowed to hate and the devil's the thing we're allowed to hate right you ought to kill your enemy or your enemy will kill you and this is where the son of Gideon he had the opportunity kill them they've course does great damage remember these were the kings of Midian they were like grasshoppers you know they they ate the substance of Israel up they had dominion over them and now finally they're the the kings of that place that had plagued him for so long now their life was coming to an end and Gideon wanted to give the victory to his son son you can do it rise up and slay them remember their captive you know they can died but it's it's he was afraid because he had to put his hand to it more than the favorite preacher more than just reading the scripture more than listening to the message that's when you actually take that word and say Lord make it live in my life more than someone else's testimony but the problem is we always are afraid of the unknown even if that unknown can be deliverance it can be freedom it can be overcoming power it can be victory people can be afraid because we get comfortable and where we have been and we can explain away all but this and this and this and this is happening and this is why I'm this way and and we and we begin to look at other people and criticize them because of the state we're in and we try and validate our backslidden state because of how other people are remember it's you and God who cares of the whole world who cares if everyone else goes and goes back out of the world I said now I'm gonna walk with God the rapture is an individual affair it's not you and all of us sure the bride's gonna go in to click the body but it's you and God walking alone you've got to walk with Him doesn't matter what mama says daddy does whoever does what are you yes what about you oh but these people are going getting all worldly and excellent but what about you you know probably the scribes and Pharisees they always tried to outdo each other they would say the biggest praise and they would plan what they had pray write it down and all isn't that incredible and they would begin to go out don't pray out in public like the hypocrites or scribes and Pharisees do and they wore the biggest pious robes they give the biggest pious offerings and they're saying look at me and now comparing themselves with everyone around them but then when the real Murrah came when the word became flesh and walk among them they weren't willing to look in the mirror and see where they were oh that was them what about you why are you preaching this way we can't just continue going on amen we've got to have a meeting I'm preaching to myself we're gonna have a time we can't have the devil as a prisoner of war we're here to take no prisoners give no quarter I'm talking about against the devil not people I'm not talking about people I'm talking about spirits we are not here to put up with him for another second I mean when the jublee trumpet rang they had a right to put down what they are now walk free back to their adherents they don't matter where they're in what they are from they could walk out you say but I but the devil's got me here and all this and this no no don't worry about your comp just take your complexes put them at the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ if I can never overcome this who said I'll never be free who said who said who who tells you there do you think that God will say to you say sorry you're gonna stay in there stage I'm not putting anyone in in particular sorry you have to live with that oh I just had this to make me humble what a lie what a stupid lie but we rationalize in our mind why we have to live with the devil I'm sorry we are made to be a temple of God right we are the dwelling place of the Living God I mean where God fulfills his word that's what we built to be you say well why would you say that because to be a Christian is to be christ-like and you can't be a Christian unless the Lord Himself is in you he is the Christian and you a man isn't that right that's how you actually be a Christian he that's why he died on Calvary that here come and dwell in you and livers word out it's not us trying to do it it's him amen I feel the pain religious right now brother Aaron with some free food feeling pretty good but he had to rise up he had to take the sword himself but he is afraid if there is fear holding you back you've got to speak to that fear not someone else you are but this is how always been it comes a day with blind bartimaeus didn't stay blind he had a meeting the one what the blood issue didn't stay the woman with the blood issue the woman at the well didn't stay the woman at the well she had a meeting hallelujah what about you he said well I've been a Christian for many many many many many years for right now what about the joy and the fire and the passion to know him what about that all the joy of your salvation how good he is and how wonderful he is and you can be in church you can be by yourself and God just comes down and you have a glorious time and you just said so much in love hallelujah that's how it should be you say no that's just a nice idea really it's not just a nice idea I mean this is a marriage between us in Christ and it doesn't just stay with a honeymoon and become a working relationship it stays a honeymoon sure there's a lot of battle sure there are things you got to go through but he's holding you by the hand I would never let anything bog you down hallelujah you say oh you can't stay in that cloud night experience you just be challenged for a second oh no it's not really in that way he's sure have you experienced it do you know why the devil tells you those things because it's not him and God in a relationship he's the enemy it's young God in a relationship the devil doesn't even come into the equation but we give him so much room and we keep him prisoner what are we just come why don't we just come and say Lord I'm sick of us and you have to you have to kill them you got to rise up and slay it this thing that haunts you and bugs you for so long you've got to kill it you have to they say if I just get pray for done you've got to do the pray you have to rise up you have the faith now Gideon would it's amazing you know the Bible doesn't just show us the word doesn't just discern our hearts and reveal us the word reveals the devil and his heart there's many times where the devil as I said about yo Jesus would be there and the devil would speak out of someone say have you come to torment us before the time he knows he's got it coming it would say in revelations chapter 12 that when he's cast down to the earth he knows he has got great wrath because he knows he just has a short time if he knew if he actually didn't um if he didn't think he would burn in the lake of fire why would he just think he's got a short time he knows he's going to end up in that place he's fought the word all the way down through he hasn't stopped it he could not stop this word now amen brother Brown would say when I'm glad I got page numbers here we are see you see we have too many people do not die out to the diet discern and kill that spirits influence in their lives because they actually love or at least are affectionate towards that spirit you actually have to hate that spirit don't defend it see you come out of the world you cannot defend what you once were I was a ranked sinner I'm ashamed of what I did I wasn't proud of it but people are still proud of what they were what's because they still love the thing you actually have to hate that thing that once ruled you see Sampson had to be willing to die to destroy his enemies he had to be willing to die with those Philistines and the scripture says in Romans 6 and 7 for he that is dead is free from sin so if you're really dead and Christ lives in you you're free from sin it's more than just a nice word it's reality amen let me say this my friend I know I've said it but he says listen just once more Lord let me say this my friend you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you he says bring back the old fashioned prayer meetings old-fashioned repentance with a state where they stay to the altar till they were dead and finish with sin now how many times here is so Gideon as I said the scripture tells us it reveals the heart of the devil and Gideon would go down before his great victory with us 300 and Hermon and someone else would actually sneak into the camp of the nights to see what was going on and as they snuck there that night they heard two of the Midianites speaking and once it I had a dream and that dream was a cake of barley bread was rolled down into the camp it would strike a tent and the tent will fall down flat and then now Gideon did not have to work out what that meant because the other one would say well that's actually the sword that and and his fellow answered and said that is nothing else saved the sword of Gideon and thus the son of joash a man of Israel fall into his hand hath God delivered Midian and all the hosts this is judges 7:14 so this is he's to Midianites what has the dream the other one gives the interpretation saying actually our goose is cooked because God has already given our lives and all the hosts into this man's Gideon's hand so what happens the devil actually show the devil actually knew this is what's going to happen to me and it says it and as it was so when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshiped because he no doubt he's wondering well there's only 300 of us they're like grasshoppers upon the earth how're we ever going to defeat them but when he goes down any any and he realizes actually no they know their end the devil knows his end Joshua 2 and 9 when when the two spies go into rehabs house and Rahab begins to tell them now you just think about it you're the two spies you're look at Jericho their walls are so thick you can race chariots around them the big walls you would have seen their armies and their spears their shields in there and their soldiers you know on guard all these things no doubt you think how're we ever going to win this there's incredible feat if we ever do it but then that the Lord is going to show gonna show Israel the heart of the people in the city this is the heart of the devil he can look like a big boast and a big bluff and he can look so big and strong and powerful but in him his morale is shot he knows he's got it coming hallelujah member we are disputing with a defeated foe and it's a Rahab would begin to tell them of the morale of thee of the people in the city and she said unto the man this is Joshua turn nine I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you here they were with their big big city and their shields and swords and their army but their hearts fainted the terror of the Lord fell upon them and Rahab said because it's you that caused that to happen you know the devil believes in trembles do you know that you believe in one God you do well the Bible says but the devil also believes any trembles so he's trembling in his boots because he knows God is gonna fulfill his word and he's gonna burn he's actually trembling but he tries to put that upon you because he knows if you just take the word for yourself and you believe the word for yourself and you take it and you kill that thing out of your life he's powerless he's powerless so he tries to bluff us and say no you know just got to live with us and this is how it is near your mum was like this your dad was like this you know that you know because of your past you have to be like this soon he said and I've said that a lot but who said you've got to take the sword you got to kill it so all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you do you think they look like they was shaking in their boots when Israel was walking around the city with the ark and the trumpets and everything they would have been there trying to look like intimidating on the wall but their hearts had fainted they were actually in terror watching those rights carry the ark around the wall the devil is afraid of you doesn't matter how old you are how young you are how long you've known the Lord for the devil is afraid of you amen and as soon as we heard these things now I'm just dropping down to verse 11 when they heard about how the king of the emirates were killed the Red Sea was you know opened up and all those things as soon as we heard these things thou hast had melt neither did they remain any more courage and any man because of you for the Lord your God He is God and heaven above and an earth beneath but earth beneath you know when you begin to have a testimony service and you were going to testify what God did for you the devil hears it he was there he was cast out he knew he was there it happened I mean he doesn't say that didn't happen he knew it happened cuz he was there and their hearts actually melting saying we can not get control of these people no more Howell ooh yeah you think about his heart is actually melted because of you he said but he's he's a bluff no he's nothing but a big shadow I mean you know he said but he's powerful he's strong he's down a list of people no he's nothing but a bluff but you have to call his hand brother were seasoned witnesses he says the he says the reason you let him do it that's all he's just a bluff he has no legal right that's right if you've got an experience of God of the resurrection of Jesus Christ he strips Satan of every privilege he had and robbed him of everything he had took it away from you so he robbed him and stripped him and give the power to the church now go do the same things that I did that's right he took the sword out of Satan's hand and put it in your hand amen so he had to but the son of Gideon was afraid he wouldn't rise up and kill you no you keep reading the book of Judges someone else rises up and kills all the sons of Gideon and becomes the ruler what happened if this one stood up and said I'll do what the words telling me to do I'll kill these defeated foes we need courage we need courage you know brother Aaron makes a statement now and I'm just going to kind of come down to this he makes a statement you just put one or two good church members in a church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church more than forty revivals you could have let God challenge you this morning more than 40 revivals one or two good members in a church right a good cleanse member set in an example with a face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God and watch when somebody gets sick and they'll call that person to come pray or you might make fun of them and their tyre is deflated and so forth you might all this nonsense say but let death strike you one time you'll find out what them struggles begin to come who that real sincere person is in the church they've been I believe if there's a genuine desire for a revival God will send that genuine God will send that revival I mean it's it's but it's what you want you get what you expect you say you're just reaching way out there no I don't believe I am the scripture would say the scripture would say in in in Psalms 84 and 11 for the Lord God as a son and a shield the Lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly no good thing we say it together no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly no good thing now we have to recognize he makes us walk uprightly it's not you that's all I'm gonna be a Christian going to does no no his Spirit comes unto you and he's the Christian in your life he makes you just right he makes you speak right he makes you act right that's him in you so he's the one that causes us to walk uprightly this is no good thing will he withhold from them why do we put up with the devil why do we put up with circumstances amen why do we why do we just say well this is just how it has to be no good thing he said well they've gone off into the world they don't is shouldn't God no good thing just letting it just you know these words have been you know I was having fellowship with brother Emerson driving to brother Thompson's funeral and he brought up the scripture and I was just thinking God doesn't put anything he doesn't just this is not just filler he didn't just put the scripture in there just to say isn't it nice and put it on Instagram or on our fridge he's challenging you he put that in he put that in his word that someone someone's gonna believe it someone's gonna take God at His Word and say Lord this is my portion he follow me someone is gonna believe the scripture and someone is gonna anchor to someone's soul Lord you could not withhold the salvation of my family you could not withhold their Redemption you could not withhold nothing you said you withhold nothing no good things I mean salvation is a good thing redemption is a good thing hallelujah someone's gonna say yes Lord yes I'm gonna take you at your word see God loves us to take him at his word God loves it he put that in there you say well that's just you just reaching way out no no Mary would be sitting in a synagogue and the priest was inspired to go to Isaiah 9 and 6 and begin to read about the son being born and the Messiah and and and and and she heard that word in church and something gripped in her soul many heard that when Isaiah prophesied and I believe everyone who had a little girl maybe that age could have a child say our daughter is going to fulfill the prophets prophesy but God knew who would fulfill it and then there she was she heard that and anchored in her heart and she began to ponder on that Scripture and they would read about it her and him and I mean her and Joseph and and then she met the angel Gabriel that scripture was sitting here for about 800 years waiting for someone they men he said well but I'm not married but you're the Bride of Christ hallelujah says no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly don't take that lightly remember I'm preaching to myself if he said that he will not withhold a good thing well then you got to take or what all those good things are and say Lord you will not withhold this from me you'll not withhold it hallelujah but the thing is we we explain away things well this is just how it has to be and maybe they're not predestinated and maybe this who would say such a thing who would say such a thing I wouldn't put up with that kind of reasoning Oh they've gone so far they've said too much they've done it uh who cares about that I mean we should have it in our hearts if our family come along they're not safe something should be in a say Lord may there be such an atmosphere in my life I mean may make the atmosphere crying around me draw you him I mean for them hallelujah that they they step into an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost they begin to realize that God is alive and they give their lives you know many of us can sit in church for too long than just sit in church I mean without having a real experience and without putting the word into action member God loves us to challenge him at his word take it challenge God with his word God Lord Lord you said this you know brother on Spencer she had a testimony where he was he had a stroke he was in hospital and because of all you know he couldn't be in much lights as and darkness and the ward here ozone or the room and they'd go chicken with flashlights and so on and he said one why not there when he's when he's in this state the Lord came down he's praying the Lord came down to the room and a nurse came in and and and she she said to him mr. Spencer you are you awake yes ma'am you've been praying not a Christian yes ma'am said and and she said you know when I walked into this room I felt something different I've seen the people who have come in and visited you and so on and I've never been a Christian but I need Jesus and she knelt down next thing you know and and and and she asked him can you pray I'll pray here he is suffering from the effects of a stroke God comes down we have no excuse we have no excuse yes I am sick I've got this problem now if he can lie there after a stroke in a hospital and God can come down on the same color and someone and she and she gave her life to the Lord never been a church for never being a Christian because God lives how about you and I hallelujah and then when she gave her house the Lord walked out he said the symptoms of the stroke lift them we have and I look at that and that challenges me because I sit there in my pity party and all this is wrong and work as busy and this is going under editor and we can miss God coming and actually living in our day because of what we think we're going through Lord Jesus help me you say well that's that's that's him what about you the same Lord Jesus Christ that lives in his life I trust lives in your life lives in my life the same God he knows you should know as well that's the atmosphere we create around us well how do we make a nice atmosphere say nice things I was saying to the girls if you can't you know there's a saying if you have nothing good to say say nothing at all amen brother Rome would say this and and maybe I'll just close on this note he says there's some perfect faith he says he says let's just stand still for a minute let's just worship God in our heart think of it God he's here he's here who who identified himself as being the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever the word is sharper than a two-edged sword even a discerner of the thoughts and intents now we've come here what you've come here for and what your purpose of being here and who you are identify Jesus Christ to be Messiah and today it identifies some being the same Messiah yesterday today and forever the great physician who was here who said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but can believe that he can create squirrels who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it's my own faith that goes and does that my faith and what he challenged me to ask he challenged me to ask it and I received his challenge in the obedience to his word I asked it and it appeared he was challenged to say it and he says I accept God at his challenge I spoke it and it was there what about you what about you to take guard it is worse or are you afraid to draw your sword and kill your enemy I think we've lived with the devil too long we've lived in a backslidden state too long we've lived in a state of just just going through the motion of church and I'm in the message it means nothing unless that message lives in you it means nothing a man could just be a tag or a phrase or just another church this is not just another church they'll talk about the bride around the world where the Bride of Christ where the church and living God he says in my name now shall cast out Devils in the name of Jesus Christ he's talking to you not just talking to the preacher talking to you hallelujah he challenged he says he challenged me to ask it and I accepted his challenge no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly you have a problem he can relieve you of that problem the thing the arrests are worth you don't have to put up with it no more it's purely up to you what do you want out of this service I want God to sweep down that when we walk out of this the things that we carried in here we don't carry no more that's that's what I am expecting that's what I'm looking for but what do you want you say that's just sick and pull no that's third pull so it's got to be made flesh made manifested but what do you want let's bow head shall we you want to stand to be prideful we're gonna pray for everyone then if you want pray and come stand around the altar
