[43:13] spirit from me

[44:03] just a coincidence
[44:05] or random set of circumstances lord god
[44:08] but we believe it's your mighty hand
[44:10] lord that's directed us all here today

[44:56] name
[44:56] amen amen praise the lord okay um god
[45:00] bless you you can
[45:01] actually have your seats this morning
[45:04] i have got an opening scripture but my
[45:06] opinion scriptures kind of
[45:07] all coincide with my um slide and then i
[45:10] kind of just carry on from there so it's
[45:13] a little bit unorthodox
[45:15] how are you all this morning good
[45:19] very good who said very good brother ed
[45:23] i like that when you're a christian
[45:25] you're always good
[45:27] regardless of what the circumstance
[45:28] might be we are always good when we're a
[45:30] christian amen
[45:33] amen i just um yeah thanks dennis i
[45:36] leave it there
[45:37] um
[45:40] i've got a i've got to go quite fast
[45:43] this morning but i don't like to go fast
[45:44] straight away because i kind of
[45:47] like to get to know you you get to know
[45:49] me a little bit i settle in then we make
[45:51] a start so that's kind of
[45:52] how i do it so um
[45:56] i was thinking i was saying to shannon
[45:58] the other day actually
[46:01] i was like this is an odd sort of set of
[46:03] circumstances that i find myself in or
[46:06] like i i end up for the last sort of six
[46:09] weeks
[46:10] i've been up the front for with all
[46:12] sorts of stuff doing stuff
[46:14] now you all know me right i'm like a shy
[46:18] introvert loner
[46:22] that's true that's true that's what
[46:24] that's my natural man you know
[46:25] i'd rather be i was going to be a farmer
[46:27] that was what i was going to be
[46:29] and like go up in the bush and just farm
[46:30] and come down to church on sunday and
[46:33] go back up to the bush come down on
[46:34] wednesday maybe if we didn't live too
[46:36] far away
[46:38] that that's my ideal scenario you know
[46:40] but it didn't quite happen that way
[46:43] but i'm sure it felt like only six weeks
[46:45] ago i was up
[46:47] here preaching and then i think the next
[46:49] week i had to come up in song lead
[46:51] then i think the next week i think i had
[46:54] to run my grandmother's funeral
[46:56] then i think us then i think i had to do
[46:58] a wednesday night
[46:59] ministry thing then i had to song lead
[47:02] then i had to
[47:03] do the best man speech at my other
[47:04] brother's
[47:06] wedding essentially yeah then i'm up
[47:08] here this morning
[47:10] again and it's not really my style
[47:14] and if i suppose if people say you know
[47:17] not that i've got any critics but if
[47:18] critics were like oh why does he always
[47:19] go at the front
[47:21] i'll be like well i'm asking the same
[47:22] question you know
[47:24] i don't i don't know but anyway
[47:27] if you're called to do something though
[47:28] you've got to do it well that's
[47:31] in anything that we do we should do it
[47:32] well that's the way that a christian
[47:34] should be and especially for the lord if
[47:35] we're going to do something put effort
[47:37] in
[47:37] yes do it well don't don't do things
[47:39] half-heartedly
[47:41] do it well or don't do it at all you
[47:42] know and so
[47:44] regardless of all these thoughts that i
[47:45] think i think will have if i've been
[47:47] asked i want to put effort in to try and
[47:48] do it well
[47:49] you know i want to i want to do my best
[47:50] for the lord so so when i
[47:53] you know when i lay down and take my
[47:54] last breath i can think i did my best
[47:56] you know hey sometimes we try our best
[47:58] and we fail miserably
[47:59] who cares we tried our best that's all
[48:01] that we can do is try our best sometimes
[48:03] we try best and we succeed
[48:05] so now you all look like very
[48:08] intelligent people to me so i'm when i
[48:09] start this i'm going to go very fast is
[48:11] that okay
[48:12] i'm going to go fast all right because i
[48:13] have to go fast to get through this
[48:15] i said to brother andy last night where
[48:17] buddies you know so i can say this i
[48:18] said oh can you keep the song service
[48:19] not
[48:20] don't do it really short but don't do it
[48:21] long you know
[48:23] i was getting worried because it was
[48:24] like quarter past 10 and i'm thinking
[48:26] you haven't started the first sort of
[48:27] song yet you know
[48:30] but nonetheless we're here now so i'm
[48:32] going to go fast
[48:34] i'm starting okay this that my sermons
[48:37] often i just get one word then i have to
[48:38] try and
[48:39] think about trying to try and push
[48:41] something out of that one word and the
[48:42] one word that i got this time was
[48:43] surveillance
[48:44] surveillance and when you first thought
[48:47] you think how am i going to get
[48:48] five minutes out of the word
[48:49] surveillance you know but
[48:52] lord help me we we somehow figure it out
[48:53] and then now i'm thinking how am i going
[48:55] to get
[48:55] surveillance out in this short amount of
[48:57] time
[48:59] my scripture that i've got is proverbs
[49:02] 15 3 says the eyes of the lord are in
[49:04] every place beholding the evil and the
[49:06] good the eyes of the lord are in every
[49:07] place
[49:08] every place beholding the evil and the
[49:10] good now
[49:11] i've broken this down into a few
[49:12] different portions i've got the world
[49:14] under surveillance the church under
[49:15] surveillance and the bride under
[49:16] surveillance i've kind of broken it down
[49:17] so the first one i'm going to talk about
[49:19] is the world under surveillance
[49:20] and there's a trend at the moment that
[49:22] everything is now surveillance
[49:23] surveillance surveillance we are all
[49:25] under surveillance now this is now
[49:26] naturally speaking right we're all under
[49:27] surveillance that's just
[49:29] that's the modern world that we live in
[49:30] we're under surveillance and
[49:32] get used to it it's coming to a city
[49:33] near you more and more and more it's
[49:35] probably coming to
[49:36] the country near you more and more and
[49:38] more that's the way that this whole
[49:39] thing's going
[49:40] we're under surveillance and i'm just
[49:42] going to take you through a few natural
[49:43] things to sort of get our
[49:44] minds realizing that we actually live in
[49:46] an unusual time a strange time it's a
[49:49] time where
[49:50] human beings maybe pre-flood they may
[49:52] have had this sort of scenario but
[49:53] post flood because we don't know the
[49:55] technology they had there but post flood
[49:57] we haven't had this scenario before like
[49:58] what we are under now as human beings
[50:00] surveillance we're under we're under
[50:02] constant surveillance i'm just going to
[50:03] take you through a few of these
[50:04] more intense scenarios but we are this
[50:07] is all coming to a city near you so
[50:09] don't don't
[50:10] fret you'll have your turn to be under
[50:12] this sort of
[50:13] surveillance you know we must be special
[50:15] to be watched
[50:18] so china has a very good surveillance
[50:20] program they've got
[50:22] it's like a so they've got cctv cameras
[50:24] all over the place
[50:25] 250 million of these things that's a lot
[50:28] of cameras and they
[50:29] they and and they've got this awesome
[50:31] technology very good technology it's
[50:33] called facial recognition technology and
[50:35] they can process faces very very fast
[50:36] with these cameras so they're finding
[50:39] like people try and escape and they do
[50:40] test it within a couple of minutes they
[50:41] give someone 10 minutes to run away in a
[50:43] city and within
[50:44] you know within 10 minutes they found
[50:46] the person by us you know
[50:47] they recognize his face in one of these
[50:49] cameras and track him down so
[50:51] it's just there's a lot of surveillance
[50:53] very good surveillance going on they
[50:55] they keep a good watch on their citizens
[50:57] over there and
[50:58] everyone is tracked and everyone has now
[51:00] a number when you go there too there's
[51:01] not much cash in
[51:02] when we were there about two years ago
[51:03] it was all everything is qr code and
[51:06] whatsapp and alipay and everything it's
[51:08] all it's all going to digital currency
[51:09] because that's the
[51:10] for the surveillance um it's that's more
[51:13] the preferred method of um
[51:14] operating you know you have everything
[51:16] because then you have a digital id and
[51:17] then you're you they know who you are
[51:18] and
[51:19] now you pay with things with your face
[51:21] you know you just go and it scans your
[51:22] face and that's how you pay because your
[51:23] face is linked to your account and your
[51:24] account has got money in it
[51:26] and so it's so things like jaywalking
[51:29] you know you can't jaywalk a guy there
[51:30] said he he um
[51:32] he jaywalked and within about eight
[51:34] seconds of getting
[51:35] of jaywalking he'd got a notification on
[51:37] his i think it was whatsapp or alipay
[51:39] that he'd been caught jaywalking he had
[51:40] been fined and money had been taken out
[51:42] of his account
[51:43] that's done and dusted you know so
[51:46] that's very
[51:47] very good technology very good
[51:48] surveillance and now the police have
[51:50] there see
[51:51] google the west is a bit more against
[51:53] this stuff but it'll slowly come in it's
[51:54] just the way it's going to work
[51:55] but but the chinese just get it done you
[51:57] know and they have
[51:59] so so they have their sort of like
[52:01] google glasses but all this information
[52:02] is now
[52:03] so they can look at people and you know
[52:04] you'll come up who you are that's so and
[52:06] so
[52:07] this is their record and it's down to
[52:09] things like credit score and that so you
[52:10] you if you're a good or bad person you
[52:12] get rated you get a credit score and
[52:13] then if you're bad you kind of
[52:15] have bad things happen to you if you're
[52:16] good then you're okay that's
[52:18] that's there was a russian app it's not
[52:21] just in
[52:22] in china there was a there was a russian
[52:24] out years ago called
[52:25] find face and they would scan all sorts
[52:26] of faces and if you
[52:28] feel someone you're a bit shy to go and
[52:29] talk to you want to know who they were
[52:30] you could just use this app and you
[52:32] could
[52:32] take a photo of that person it would
[52:33] scan their face and then tell you who
[52:34] that person is and it would search for
[52:35] the whole database
[52:37] quite accurate it was very common in
[52:39] sort of the like 2015 and that
[52:42] it was called fine face i don't know if
[52:43] we like it was very big overseas
[52:45] but it sort of slowly went away
[52:47] somewhere but then the guys that
[52:48] developed it emerged with the russian
[52:50] government
[52:50] and and now they've been working on
[52:53] their own um
[52:54] facial recognition technology and that
[52:56] with the russian government
[52:57] so they they um one of one of the
[53:00] methods they you like for
[53:02] for when it was covered for the lockdown
[53:03] you know they they used a lot of this
[53:04] technology to they saw someone walking
[53:06] around oh that's johnny walking down on
[53:07] the street there you know get hold of
[53:09] johnny because it recognized his face
[53:10] but here they were so they for that
[53:14] for that sort of surveillance they were
[53:15] going to use um
[53:17] cc our mobile apps that track users
[53:19] locations cctv cameras
[53:21] qr codes mobile phone data and credit
[53:22] card records that's to just track if
[53:24] anyone is out and about when they
[53:25] shouldn't be
[53:26] we don't have the luxury of doing that
[53:27] here i was listening to something on the
[53:28] radio and they said
[53:29] overseas they just kind of get it
[53:30] whatever information they want private
[53:32] information but we are
[53:33] slightly more restricted here you can't
[53:34] just go and get that information
[53:37] publicly well how would i say this you
[53:40] can't tell people you just get the
[53:41] information
[53:42] they probably do get the information but
[53:43] you publicly can't say you get the
[53:44] information
[53:45] in these countries they just get the
[53:46] information and what are you going to do
[53:47] about it that's the way it works
[53:48] this is the amount of cameras you
[53:49] probably can't see there but the united
[53:51] united states actually has a lot they
[53:52] have a lot of the stuff as well it's not
[53:54] just
[53:55] these countries it's um the bigger
[53:57] countries are doing and everyone's
[53:58] trying to follow suit with this stuff
[54:02] china's got they they're about 250
[54:04] million now um
[54:05] america's got a hundred and oh no no
[54:09] sorry they've only got
[54:10] they've got 50 million but it's per
[54:11] capita because america's got less people
[54:14] but they got
[54:15] more cam um more cameras per capita but
[54:18] russia has got a lot of people so
[54:19] they're going to have a lot of cameras
[54:20] as well
[54:21] so they're that's proportionate this is
[54:23] just interesting technology that is
[54:24] changing the way that the world operates
[54:26] um
[54:27] starlink is a very interesting
[54:28] development um matt would know about
[54:30] this it's
[54:31] it's um the guy that did telstra what's
[54:33] his name he's elon musk he's doing this
[54:36] it's quite an awesome program when you
[54:37] think about it he's sending thousands of
[54:38] satellites into
[54:39] low earth orbit and they are they are
[54:42] picking up um
[54:43] internet and they are beaming internet
[54:44] down to the whole world this is what
[54:46] this program is about
[54:47] thousands and thousands of these things
[54:48] they're already up there you can already
[54:50] parts of the states you can log into um
[54:52] skynet and it's very fast very fast um
[54:56] um internet speed and it comes it being
[54:58] it's beamed down from all these
[54:59] satellites but there people are
[55:00] complaining because they
[55:01] they've got all these lights now beaming
[55:02] through the sky and it's kind of
[55:03] astronomers are complaining that you
[55:05] know these things are going to fill up
[55:06] the sky because they're low earth orbit
[55:07] so they are trying to do things
[55:08] but that's how many they want to have up
[55:09] there the whole place they want the
[55:10] globe covered because
[55:11] space is like the wild west still you
[55:13] know it's just no one really is in
[55:14] charge of it it's like it is the wild
[55:16] west
[55:16] at the moment and and i think all the
[55:18] rich guys are realizing this is our
[55:20] latest
[55:20] um you know it's like like this is the
[55:23] colonial style
[55:24] but into space you know cloning colonial
[55:26] era going into space and
[55:28] sending up these satellites and you you
[55:30] can um
[55:31] why did that was because they've already
[55:33] done deals with the military and things
[55:35] these these these satellites will have
[55:37] cameras on them as well
[55:38] to do their own little bit of
[55:40] surveillance at the same time as beaming
[55:42] down
[55:42] you know so everything is going to be
[55:45] you can't get away anywhere everything
[55:47] is watched all the time
[55:48] you can even now it's gotten to the
[55:50] point now if you want to watch something
[55:51] you can there are companies now that
[55:52] have satellites that you can just go and
[55:53] spy on things and i want to
[55:55] keep an eye on this particular area you
[55:56] start your account and pay them your
[55:58] monthly fee and you can watch
[55:59] any area in the world that you want to
[56:01] all the time you know that's
[56:03] that's this we live in a surveillance
[56:05] state everything can be
[56:06] under surveillance even things like your
[56:09] cell phone you know you're
[56:10] you can be you you're tracked all the
[56:12] time by your phone like your phone is
[56:13] always
[56:14] it's always sending out a little um i am
[56:16] here here here i am here i am all the
[56:18] time it's like
[56:19] it's walking around yelling out this
[56:20] little i am here and you know you've got
[56:22] all these cell towers and they're like
[56:23] oh
[56:24] who who's around me and they're they're
[56:25] listening for the i am here i'm here i'm
[56:27] here and
[56:28] and there's you know if you're further
[56:30] away your your shout is quieter if
[56:31] you're closer your shout is louder i'm
[56:33] here i'm here and then they get that
[56:34] data and it's like okay
[56:35] that phone with the unique every every
[56:38] phone and the phone itself
[56:41] and the sim card have a unique number
[56:43] worldwide so that's why you can ring a
[56:45] number and it will go
[56:46] where is that phone and it will say oh i
[56:49] just heard that phone yell at me over
[56:50] here it's over here okay we'll connect
[56:52] it to that number there
[56:53] it's all and you can ring someone now
[56:55] and they'll answer around the world
[56:56] anywhere because they're always yelling
[56:57] out to the cellphone towers i'm here but
[56:59] that information tells where you are all
[57:01] the time it's always saying i'm here i'm
[57:02] here you walk away i'm here now i'm in
[57:04] the middle of these two towers i'm here
[57:06] and it's and all this data gets kept and
[57:08] this data often gets used to track oh
[57:09] where it was so and so he was there okay
[57:11] because we
[57:11] it's called metadata and so we we
[57:14] we get tracked or we are under constant
[57:16] surveillance all the time
[57:19] we almost can't get away everything we
[57:20] do like we're like who's got email
[57:22] you'll probably have you know you start
[57:23] these free email accounts all your
[57:25] emails get read
[57:26] that's how these people make their money
[57:27] because then they they scan it and then
[57:29] keywords you know if you talk about
[57:30] things then they can do advertising this
[57:32] is now for money
[57:33] to make money out of you if you're
[57:34] typing in certain things now we're not
[57:36] so important that i want to read your
[57:37] emails because i want to know what
[57:38] you're up to we're not that important
[57:39] don't
[57:40] think we are very important it's but
[57:42] that being said if you want to be
[57:44] if anyone if the authorities want to
[57:46] they can get access to all of our stuff
[57:48] it's not
[57:50] yeah that's just this is the way that it
[57:53] works if you want to do digital stuff
[57:55] it's all there someone's got access to
[57:56] it even some of the encrypted stuff
[57:58] you're still
[57:59] people still have access to the actual
[58:01] the program itself you know the
[58:03] developers have a back door and it's
[58:04] just so all these programs they all get
[58:06] read
[58:06] one guy wanted to get some information
[58:08] out there i forget what it was about so
[58:09] he thought
[58:10] i'll send an email using this and this
[58:12] email
[58:13] he was exposing a it may have been
[58:15] something to do with the government
[58:18] it may have been elections i'm not sure
[58:19] what it was but he thought if i if i
[58:21] write in these keywords
[58:22] in my email i know this news company
[58:24] gets all that they get sent all the
[58:25] stuff and they
[58:26] any any kind of important stuff they
[58:27] look at it so um yeah and there was a
[58:29] follow-up the next down email had sent
[58:30] privately to a friend
[58:32] about oh we heard you're doing something
[58:33] but it was his email is being read and
[58:35] keywords being scanned
[58:36] and stuff that's the world we live in
[58:37] that's that's the way that it works we
[58:38] we get
[58:40] all these apps apps are even worse you
[58:41] know they you put on you put on um
[58:43] location
[58:45] like locations that is like yes activate
[58:48] my where i am so
[58:49] this that that app knows where you are
[58:52] all the time you activate um access my
[58:53] photos it can access all your photos
[58:56] all the time any of your photos on your
[58:58] phone it's accessible through this
[59:00] you sort of open the door and let the
[59:01] stuff in i put this one of tick tock up
[59:03] there because um
[59:04] tic dock is like essentially a chinese
[59:07] company you know and so
[59:08] all the americans are all upset they're
[59:10] trying to close this company down
[59:11] because you know oh it's
[59:12] it's bad but it's it's more the point of
[59:14] you know we can spy on our own citizens
[59:15] but you're not allowed to come and cut
[59:16] our grass you know because they're
[59:17] coming in and
[59:18] all the american data now they can track
[59:20] all these americans
[59:22] through their app you know so they're
[59:23] like this is not fair you know you're
[59:25] you're cutting out grass here that's the
[59:27] only reason why they didn't want them to
[59:28] they wanted to get rid of the app
[59:30] because it was you know
[59:32] they they wanted to do their
[59:33] surveillance i found this photo
[59:35] interesting this is
[59:36] this is our friend and he um so you see
[59:39] and people
[59:39] people i guess they weren't surprised
[59:43] but you know he had his
[59:44] he did this little photo but they looked
[59:45] in the background and he had her he'd
[59:46] had his camera
[59:48] with a um put a tape over his camera so
[59:50] that
[59:51] you know because he knows you always get
[59:53] hacked and people look at your camera
[59:55] your camera's probably like this camera
[59:56] here someone may be looking at me right
[59:57] now
[59:58] it's not it's just you're on your phone
[1:00:00] your phone's everywhere you pic like
[1:00:02] you could people can listen to what you
[1:00:04] say when your phone's not on everything
[1:00:05] it's not it's just
[1:00:07] we're under surveillance all the time
[1:00:09] we're not important that they look at us
[1:00:10] all the time people look at us but if we
[1:00:12] were we could be looked at very easily
[1:00:14] and i thought new zealand's not really
[1:00:16] like that you know we don't have all
[1:00:16] this facial recognition technology and
[1:00:18] we're all you know we're good old new
[1:00:19] zealand
[1:00:20] just kiwi blokes and girls you know
[1:00:22] relaxing out in the back
[1:00:23] and i saw these cameras come up by our
[1:00:26] road i was i thought they were speed
[1:00:27] cameras for a while but
[1:00:29] then i then i um last year an article
[1:00:32] came up on the news and it was
[1:00:34] this was um this information came out
[1:00:36] because i think
[1:00:37] radio new zealand had had asked for um
[1:00:40] professional information act like
[1:00:42] requested can you show us this
[1:00:43] information
[1:00:44] because this was essentially it was
[1:00:45] private because the police said it's not
[1:00:47] really irrelevant the public don't
[1:00:48] really need to know this but
[1:00:49] police have been this is august last
[1:00:50] year police have been setting up a nine
[1:00:51] million in the
[1:00:52] facial recognition system they can take
[1:00:53] a live feed from cctv cameras
[1:00:56] and identify people from it this will
[1:00:57] push new zealand into new territory for
[1:00:59] attracting citizens
[1:01:00] it will be run by a non-police contract
[1:01:02] the u.s firm data works plus and collect
[1:01:04] 15 000 facial images a year
[1:01:06] without expected to expand up to tenfold
[1:01:08] so here you go we're welcome to the
[1:01:10] party folks we've arrived
[1:01:11] you know we're here we we don't miss out
[1:01:14] on the fun
[1:01:15] i'm saying this lightly because you
[1:01:16] ain't going to stop it you know some
[1:01:17] people are out there trying to stop this
[1:01:18] and that it's
[1:01:21] it's just going to happen this is where
[1:01:22] it's going to be you're not going to
[1:01:23] stop but the christians aren't going to
[1:01:24] stop it it's just going to
[1:01:24] this is the way that it's going to
[1:01:25] happen but i want to say this is old
[1:01:27] technology
[1:01:28] it's old technology god's been doing
[1:01:29] surveillance for a long long time far
[1:01:31] before this stuff
[1:01:32] he's he's been doing his surveillances
[1:01:34] these guys are starting to
[1:01:36] read your mind in the sense of like in
[1:01:39] china they're now
[1:01:40] they are now taking images of your your
[1:01:42] face and your different moods and so
[1:01:44] they can tell what sort of
[1:01:45] mood you're in by your facial
[1:01:47] expressions and your body language now
[1:01:48] this person's in that sort of mood or
[1:01:49] that mood
[1:01:50] based on the data about you as it so
[1:01:52] it's building that now but
[1:01:54] the lord knows far more than that about
[1:01:56] us i want to read you the scripture here
[1:01:57] from genesis and it came to pass when
[1:01:59] men began to multiply on the face of the
[1:02:00] earth
[1:02:02] and daughters were born unto men that
[1:02:03] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[1:02:04] that they were fair and they took them
[1:02:06] wives
[1:02:06] all of which they chose and the lord
[1:02:08] said my spirit shall not always strive
[1:02:09] with man for that he also has flesh yet
[1:02:11] his days shall be 120 years
[1:02:13] there were giants in the earth in those
[1:02:14] days and also after that when the sons
[1:02:17] of
[1:02:17] when the sons came and unto the lords of
[1:02:18] men they bear children to them
[1:02:20] the same became mighty mighty men which
[1:02:23] were of old men of renown
[1:02:26] and it says and god saw that the
[1:02:28] wickedness of man was great on the earth
[1:02:30] god did a surveillance and that every
[1:02:32] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:02:34] was only evil continually
[1:02:35] so god's hearing all the stuff he's
[1:02:37] hearing all every thought imagine
[1:02:39] imagine god's thought when he looks when
[1:02:40] he when he listens in
[1:02:42] and he hears that the thought of every
[1:02:43] person's heart on the earth is evil
[1:02:45] continually all of their thoughts are
[1:02:46] just evilness
[1:02:47] that was what god what he heard when he
[1:02:50] did his surveillance
[1:02:51] the thought of their hearts were evil
[1:02:53] there was only one man and
[1:02:55] maybe his family that had nicer thoughts
[1:02:56] which was noah and he repented the lord
[1:02:58] they obeyed man on the earth and grieved
[1:02:59] him in his heart and the lord said i'll
[1:03:01] destroy man
[1:03:02] whom i have created from the face of the
[1:03:03] earth both man and beast and the
[1:03:04] creeping thing and the fowls of the air
[1:03:06] for repenteth me that i've made them but
[1:03:08] no i found grace in the eyes of the lord
[1:03:09] he would have been the only
[1:03:11] thing that wasn't like that i've got a
[1:03:12] quote from brother branham here and
[1:03:13] everything that there is today
[1:03:15] that is had today had
[1:03:18] that has had its beginning and
[1:03:20] everything that
[1:03:22] and everything that there is begun in
[1:03:23] genesis remember life began in genesis
[1:03:25] death began in genesis this is brother
[1:03:26] brown's going to talk about noah in this
[1:03:27] day
[1:03:28] death began in genesis and all thoughts
[1:03:30] began in genesis right and wrong all
[1:03:32] began in genesis if you study the
[1:03:33] scriptures real closely you'll find that
[1:03:35] even the isms and the cults of today had
[1:03:37] the beginning of genesis if you've just
[1:03:38] watched nimrod in the different ones in
[1:03:40] the scripture
[1:03:40] all the isms that we have today began in
[1:03:43] genesis now today they polish it up make
[1:03:45] it look like something else but it's
[1:03:46] still the old evil spirit if you watch
[1:03:48] the nature of it
[1:03:49] the way it acts we've still got the same
[1:03:50] thing going on today
[1:03:52] you know a few years ago when i was just
[1:03:54] a little boy i lived in the time of
[1:03:55] prohibition that's when they banned
[1:03:57] alcohol
[1:03:58] and they had old charlie barley corn
[1:04:00] they called him many of you can remember
[1:04:01] that hideous
[1:04:02] looking person his hat all caved in and
[1:04:04] his his shoulders stooped over in such a
[1:04:07] horrible looking critter he was that was
[1:04:08] charlie barleycorn
[1:04:09] but you know today he's become a
[1:04:11] polished up man he ain't no more
[1:04:13] the little brown juggernaut and and out
[1:04:15] on the corner where the red light
[1:04:16] district is he lives in a bumper and
[1:04:18] everybody's icebox but he's
[1:04:19] still charlie barleycorn just the same
[1:04:21] same old evil one
[1:04:22] me being my mind i was like who's
[1:04:24] charlie balikorn so he's actually
[1:04:26] i think he's actually john barley corn
[1:04:28] but charlie would have been you know
[1:04:29] just a name but
[1:04:30] it was a silly silly poem that this goes
[1:04:32] back like hundreds of years
[1:04:34] um robert burns actually tweaked the
[1:04:37] poem a little bit but
[1:04:38] it's actually john barley corn but they
[1:04:40] would have called him charlie tonight
[1:04:40] this fictional character about he's like
[1:04:42] a piece of barley and they
[1:04:43] they come and they slay john barley corn
[1:04:46] and then but john balicorn rises back up
[1:04:48] when they plant him
[1:04:49] and then he then he comes and they they
[1:04:51] do all these things to him it's it's
[1:04:52] making alcohol and then then they drink
[1:04:54] it and it's like
[1:04:55] john barley corn is this awesome guy
[1:04:56] after that you know it's just about
[1:04:57] getting drunk that's all it is like
[1:05:00] there i'll read you this these are just
[1:05:03] there's a lot of verses in the middle
[1:05:04] there were three kings in the east three
[1:05:05] kings both great and high
[1:05:07] and they had sworn a solemn oath john
[1:05:08] paligorn should die that's when they're
[1:05:10] going to harvest it
[1:05:10] they took a plough and plowed him down
[1:05:12] plod put clods upon his head and when
[1:05:15] they had sworn a solemn oath john
[1:05:16] barleycorn was dead and they say all the
[1:05:17] stuff it was very morbid it's all sort
[1:05:19] of evil about
[1:05:19] his blood drained and all these things
[1:05:21] it's very and then the last verse is
[1:05:23] where john barleycorn was a hero bold of
[1:05:25] noble enterprise
[1:05:26] for if you too but taste is blood which
[1:05:28] is the
[1:05:29] beer to make your courage rise to make a
[1:05:32] man forget his woe to heighten all his
[1:05:34] joy to make the widow's heart to
[1:05:36] sing though tear were in her eye
[1:05:38] nonsense
[1:05:40] but that's obviously a celebration of
[1:05:42] this you know so so that was what um
[1:05:44] this is the so in brother brown's time
[1:05:47] this john barley called charlie
[1:05:48] barleycorn was this awesome cool
[1:05:49] character you know that was
[1:05:50] but it looked like he was that guy in
[1:05:52] there looks pretty but brother brahms
[1:05:53] saying and now they're just
[1:05:54] now this guy's this awesome guy again
[1:05:56] john barleycorn is now he's not just
[1:05:58] this
[1:05:58] critter okay everyone and the bible said
[1:06:01] to god in the bible my spirit will not
[1:06:02] always strive with man and jesus said in
[1:06:04] matthew 26 as it was in the days of noah
[1:06:06] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:06:07] of man did you notice the spirit of god
[1:06:09] was striving with men not striving to
[1:06:11] know
[1:06:11] not men striving to know the spirit of
[1:06:13] god but it was the spirit of god
[1:06:14] striving to get
[1:06:15] to men and oh how paralyzed today the
[1:06:18] spirit of god is striving with man
[1:06:19] and i wonder if god doesn't think just
[1:06:21] about like he did in those times it
[1:06:23] grieved him that he even made man
[1:06:24] to see how rebellious man can be against
[1:06:26] his spirit and his program and his way
[1:06:28] of life
[1:06:28] for man men and women the way that god
[1:06:32] thought i think when he looked down at
[1:06:33] noah and that time is is he's getting to
[1:06:35] be the same way
[1:06:37] today as when he when his surveillance
[1:06:39] goes out he hears what's happening and
[1:06:41] he hears the thoughts
[1:06:43] of people's hearts evil continually i
[1:06:45] want to just i want to bring this up
[1:06:46] because this just shows the way mankind
[1:06:49] is like
[1:06:50] when covert started around the world
[1:06:51] alcohol sales in whatever region
[1:06:53] lockdown started went through the roof
[1:06:55] what did we all do when covert started
[1:06:57] we thought praise the lord we can have
[1:06:58] time to
[1:06:59] fellowship and read the word of god and
[1:07:00] study that's what the believers did
[1:07:02] what did the rest of the world do get
[1:07:04] drunk it's time to drink we can and
[1:07:06] alcohol's online alcohol sales just went
[1:07:08] up
[1:07:08] this is another graph going up this is
[1:07:10] this is online pornography
[1:07:12] as soon as there was a lock down in the
[1:07:13] country this pornography spiked in that
[1:07:15] country because that's just
[1:07:16] the thoughts of man and woman are evil
[1:07:18] continually
[1:07:20] god's privy to all this data he's got
[1:07:22] all this data
[1:07:23] he's got his own surveillance that
[1:07:24] surveils surveys everything
[1:07:28] now i want to carry on here and as it
[1:07:30] was in days of noah so she'll always be
[1:07:31] in the days of
[1:07:32] of the son of man they did eat they
[1:07:34] drank they married wives they were given
[1:07:35] a marriage until the day that noah
[1:07:37] entered into the ark and the flood came
[1:07:38] and destroyed them all
[1:07:39] eventually god's surveillance just said
[1:07:40] i've had enough of this
[1:07:43] another scripture hell is naked before
[1:07:45] him and destruction hath no covering
[1:07:47] there's no hiding from the surveillance
[1:07:48] of god there's no hiding
[1:07:50] i want to talk about sodom for a minute
[1:07:52] because there was surveillance that
[1:07:53] happened in sodom
[1:07:54] like i was also as it was in the days of
[1:07:56] lot they did eat they drank they brought
[1:07:57] they sold they planted their builder but
[1:07:59] the same day that lot went out of sodom
[1:08:00] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:08:02] and destroyed them all
[1:08:03] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:08:04] the son of man is revealed
[1:08:07] this day it's going to be like that day
[1:08:12] and the lord said because the cry of
[1:08:14] sodom and gomorrah is great
[1:08:15] because their sin is very grievous i
[1:08:17] will go down now and see whether they
[1:08:19] have done altogether according to the
[1:08:20] cry of it which has come unto me
[1:08:22] i'll go down to do my own surveillance
[1:08:23] to see exactly what's going on down here
[1:08:25] i've heard all the sinful things coming
[1:08:27] back to me but i want to go down and do
[1:08:28] some surveillance myself
[1:08:29] that's what god is saying and if not i
[1:08:32] will know and the men turned their faces
[1:08:33] from thence and went towards sodom and
[1:08:35] abraham stood yet before the lord now
[1:08:36] i'm going to segue just here a little
[1:08:37] bit
[1:08:38] just bear with me and two of them went
[1:08:40] into sodom and cried out this is brother
[1:08:41] branham against the sins of the city and
[1:08:43] it was just before the burning of the
[1:08:44] gentile world at that time
[1:08:46] just before the burning of the gentile
[1:08:47] world which is now all sodom parish
[1:08:49] right then just a few was pulled out lot
[1:08:51] and his two daughters his wife never
[1:08:52] made it she turned back
[1:08:54] how could i just like to have time to
[1:08:56] show that right now where the church is
[1:08:58] standing at that position
[1:09:00] i want you to notice now the church is
[1:09:01] in exactly the same position so what
[1:09:02] happened there was there was all this
[1:09:04] evil happening in the world
[1:09:05] and god sent three three angels firstly
[1:09:07] to abraham
[1:09:10] and then he sent three he sent and then
[1:09:12] two angels went down to sodom to
[1:09:14] do some surveillance to find out what's
[1:09:16] going on in sodom what's happening there
[1:09:18] we're gonna
[1:09:18] we're gonna see what's really happening
[1:09:20] in and that was that was in an
[1:09:22] in the actual type there but but in this
[1:09:24] day here i want to say this because this
[1:09:26] makes you realize
[1:09:27] this is an interesting time that we live
[1:09:29] in and the two angels that went down
[1:09:31] to sodom were billy graham and oral
[1:09:34] roberts that they went down to
[1:09:35] to the world to the world and to find
[1:09:37] out what's going on and to preach
[1:09:39] to do some investigation god sent these
[1:09:40] people there
[1:09:42] and they were good friends oral roberts
[1:09:43] and billy graham got some quotes here
[1:09:45] billy was the most generous man in the
[1:09:46] ministry ever met he accepted me as a
[1:09:48] brother he said he fell in love with my
[1:09:49] ministry
[1:09:50] i counted him the number one evangelist
[1:09:51] in the world we became very close
[1:09:52] friends and this is
[1:09:54] um billy graham by old roberts upon
[1:09:56] hearing oral robots passing in december
[1:09:57] 2009
[1:09:58] reverend graham said in part oh roberts
[1:10:00] was a man of god and
[1:10:02] a great friend in the ministry i loved
[1:10:03] him as a brother we had many quiet
[1:10:05] conversations over the years now these
[1:10:06] guys were very big in the 60s but billy
[1:10:08] graham was very big all the way through
[1:10:09] until he passed away but but this
[1:10:11] happened like
[1:10:12] these were big events there were massive
[1:10:14] crowds they they came down to say repent
[1:10:16] the same is what the angels said repent
[1:10:18] you know repent
[1:10:20] i just like this because i think it's
[1:10:21] good you know
[1:10:23] so but abraham there was a group that
[1:10:25] didn't hear that message they heard a
[1:10:26] different message and that was
[1:10:27] and that was abraham and his his his
[1:10:29] name is a-b-r-a-h-a-m
[1:10:32] how many is that one two three four five
[1:10:34] six seven i just like this so i thought
[1:10:36] i'll put it in here
[1:10:37] and so you know to the world church they
[1:10:39] get at graham g-r-a-h-a-m
[1:10:41] but we get a b-r-a-n-h-a
[1:10:44] we we it always works you know god's
[1:10:47] stuff always works
[1:10:48] william out w-i-l-l-i-a-m m-a-r-r-i-o-n
[1:10:52] 7-7-7 god slings just always work it's
[1:10:55] not it's it's like
[1:10:56] like like in the book of acts none of
[1:10:58] this was done in a corner this wasn't
[1:10:59] just secretly hidden away this was all
[1:11:01] out in the open this has all happened
[1:11:02] you know and now that's what's going on
[1:11:05] in that day just to show the last sign
[1:11:06] that abraham saw the elected group
[1:11:08] pulled out from sodom now don't miss
[1:11:09] this parable whatever you do the group
[1:11:10] that had been pulled out that wasn't in
[1:11:12] sodom to begin with
[1:11:13] but the two angels went down into sodom
[1:11:15] and when they got there we find lot
[1:11:16] and he found him in a bachelor in
[1:11:18] condition all homosexuals and
[1:11:19] perversions you know the story
[1:11:20] but there's one to stay with abraham
[1:11:22] that was elohim they preached the word
[1:11:23] down there
[1:11:24] they is down in sodom preaching the word
[1:11:26] smite then blind and they couldn't find
[1:11:27] the door that's what it is today there's
[1:11:28] so much confusion in the christian world
[1:11:30] today it's just
[1:11:32] no one knows where to turn i just put
[1:11:34] this on here there's a lot of these
[1:11:35] grasps but
[1:11:36] this just to reiterate this is what's
[1:11:38] happening in the world this is now this
[1:11:39] is only legalizing
[1:11:40] same-sex marriages but this is when you
[1:11:42] legalize it it just
[1:11:44] it attitudes change towards it and when
[1:11:45] attitudes change it's accepted and it
[1:11:47] just comes in and and
[1:11:48] in 2000 2000 not very long ago right
[1:11:51] 2000 even
[1:11:52] no places now it's just like it's the
[1:11:54] the race to the bottom
[1:11:55] you know who can who's le you know no
[1:11:59] one wants to be left carrying the can i
[1:12:00] was like we were the last person to
[1:12:01] legalize it you know it's just this
[1:12:02] there's a momentum but it's just it
[1:12:05] shows that
[1:12:06] mankind are going a certain way and
[1:12:08] that's that the world has been on
[1:12:09] surveillance and they've been found
[1:12:11] they've been found wanting for the ways
[1:12:14] of man are before the lord and he
[1:12:16] pondereth all his goings
[1:12:17] all of these ways of man no matter who
[1:12:19] you are i see these these great men
[1:12:21] think that they
[1:12:22] they and the great men in the earth and
[1:12:23] they're signing all these bills to
[1:12:25] legalize all these things into all this
[1:12:26] stuff and they think
[1:12:27] they're patting each other on the back
[1:12:29] and clapping and i think
[1:12:31] you're under surveillance your heart's
[1:12:33] going to be tried you know what you're
[1:12:34] thinking and you're you're you
[1:12:36] you won't this won't carry on that this
[1:12:38] moment won't go away for you this moment
[1:12:39] will stay forever
[1:12:41] it'll stay forever it's like all this
[1:12:43] data we've got everything's been
[1:12:44] recorded i'm going to get to that soon
[1:12:47] i'm going to move on to something else
[1:12:48] right you see these little pockets going
[1:12:50] through there they're called sources so
[1:12:51] forth people say
[1:12:52] that people so that well we better leave
[1:12:55] them alone he
[1:12:56] starts talking about flying saucers he
[1:12:57] says we better leave them alone hear all
[1:12:59] these people come up missing you say
[1:13:01] you don't hear from them they're
[1:13:02] standing there and then they're not
[1:13:03] there that's the way the rapture is
[1:13:04] going to be one of them will drop right
[1:13:06] down and this terrestrial
[1:13:08] body will take on a celestial body and
[1:13:10] they'll be
[1:13:11] hiding like here or boat there'll be
[1:13:13] neither hide here or bones left it'll be
[1:13:14] transformed in the moment of time
[1:13:16] dropping right out of space and taking
[1:13:17] home
[1:13:18] that we see all this going on now
[1:13:21] and the pentagon wandering painting are
[1:13:23] wondering about these lights in the
[1:13:24] mystic light and everything that they're
[1:13:25] seeing in the sky
[1:13:27] you've seen they had one here in the
[1:13:28] paper at jeffersonville this week and so
[1:13:30] forth the mystic light so
[1:13:31] oh they don't know what it is but listen
[1:13:32] little children is going to pick you up
[1:13:34] one of these days see don't worry
[1:13:35] remember jesus said as it was in the
[1:13:36] days of sodom
[1:13:38] what happened just before sodom god came
[1:13:40] down with some angels and they had an
[1:13:42] investigation judgment
[1:13:43] he said i've heard the cry that's that
[1:13:45] is so sinful so great i've come down to
[1:13:46] find out whether it's all together the
[1:13:48] truth or not that's right
[1:13:49] watch that main one that stayed with
[1:13:51] abraham could discern the thoughts was
[1:13:53] in his heart
[1:13:54] behind him that's that's us that's our
[1:13:56] group now when you look around just a
[1:13:58] little bit of notice see watch what it's
[1:13:59] doing it's the same
[1:14:00] thing today it's an investigation
[1:14:02] judgment i've always found it very
[1:14:03] interesting
[1:14:05] and me being me i like to look into it
[1:14:07] right this now this was last week i'm
[1:14:08] not going to play this audio but this
[1:14:09] was two weeks ago
[1:14:10] so american airlines pilots flying along
[1:14:12] and i think a news company
[1:14:15] intercepts their radio communication so
[1:14:16] this this was this was heard by an
[1:14:19] uh reporter and then he requested that
[1:14:20] he get the
[1:14:22] the recordings of it and then once they
[1:14:24] get the recordings they follow up and
[1:14:25] the airline says yes okay that happened
[1:14:27] we didn't know what it was but so this
[1:14:29] this pilot's going along he says do you
[1:14:30] have any targets up here we just said
[1:14:31] something go right over the top of us i
[1:14:33] hate to say it but it looked like a long
[1:14:34] cylindrical object that almost looked
[1:14:37] like a cruise missile type of thing
[1:14:38] moving really fast over the top of us
[1:14:40] that this happens all the time but
[1:14:44] i'll show you a few things the pentagon
[1:14:45] has officially released three short
[1:14:46] videos showing unidentified aerial
[1:14:48] phenomenon that had been previously
[1:14:49] released by a private company the video
[1:14:51] shows what appeared to be unidentified
[1:14:52] flying objects rapidly moving while
[1:14:54] recorded by infrared cameras
[1:14:56] two of the in two of the videos
[1:14:58] contained service members reacting and
[1:14:59] already how quickly their objects are
[1:15:00] moving
[1:15:01] so these guys are saying i've just got
[1:15:02] the photos but
[1:15:04] these guys are saying wow these things
[1:15:05] are moving very fast they they have
[1:15:07] trouble tracking them on the infrared
[1:15:08] devices and then they track this thing
[1:15:09] they're like what is this thing it's
[1:15:10] moving moving really fast you know
[1:15:11] they're
[1:15:12] these are so i put this stuff up because
[1:15:15] you know
[1:15:15] anyone can have a video of like a make
[1:15:17] it up but when it comes from official
[1:15:18] sources and
[1:15:20] recordings from aeroplanes and stuff and
[1:15:22] it's
[1:15:23] that it's released by official
[1:15:24] information act being released it's
[1:15:26] you know a bit more interesting than
[1:15:28] these other ones here but i want to
[1:15:30] bring it on to something because in the
[1:15:31] 60s about that time when brother branham
[1:15:33] was hearing all that stuff was happening
[1:15:34] was when the nuclear
[1:15:35] the activity around the nuclear um like
[1:15:38] the cold war was starting and it was a
[1:15:40] very active time in global politics and
[1:15:43] and and
[1:15:43] the development of these evil weapons
[1:15:45] that were going to destroy us and
[1:15:47] these these weapons were massive like
[1:15:49] what was being tested in the 60s 40s 50s
[1:15:52] 60s was game-changing
[1:15:55] like don't just think i was just they
[1:15:58] did some tests this is
[1:15:59] massive in the course of mankind we
[1:16:01] haven't been here before
[1:16:03] we have actually in noah's time because
[1:16:04] they blew themselves up there but
[1:16:06] 100 years ago we weren't here in this
[1:16:09] position that we're in now but we're in
[1:16:10] the world is in a very different place
[1:16:12] now
[1:16:13] these bombs are massive massive huge
[1:16:15] like they were
[1:16:17] a man started figuring out how to break
[1:16:19] the atom and make these massive bombs
[1:16:21] that were just
[1:16:23] the only purpose was destruction you
[1:16:25] know just huge things they test them in
[1:16:26] the desert they tested them in the
[1:16:27] pacific
[1:16:28] and then the russians started making
[1:16:29] them in the chinese everyone was making
[1:16:31] them
[1:16:32] and but in the the in the in the 40s
[1:16:35] you'll know this that obviously the
[1:16:37] americans dropped some on two cities
[1:16:39] um hiroshima and nagasaki but just awful
[1:16:42] like bomber whole city
[1:16:43] like just annihilated city and this is
[1:16:46] this was this is the bomb in its infancy
[1:16:47] you know a small bomb
[1:16:49] blow up a whole city this is just murder
[1:16:52] that's all it is
[1:16:52] these men women are children everyone
[1:16:54] was just i got some numbers i think they
[1:16:56] were
[1:16:58] actually about casualties were about two
[1:17:00] hundred thousand just
[1:17:01] drop fl fly there and drop this bomb you
[1:17:03] know and then and then there'll be the
[1:17:04] radiation fought out for years
[1:17:05] afterwards but
[1:17:08] i just want to point this out now i say
[1:17:10] this as a servant of the lord i believe
[1:17:11] that it could happen any time total
[1:17:12] annihilation it could start any time
[1:17:14] look
[1:17:15] as the days of noah that's how they
[1:17:16] throw the world out of its bounds in the
[1:17:18] days of noah
[1:17:19] you know it was atomic bombs we think oh
[1:17:20] we're the smartest guys in the room you
[1:17:22] know
[1:17:22] but you imagine if you erase all our
[1:17:24] history and it raise us and we've got to
[1:17:25] start a game from zero
[1:17:28] and you know then that that's
[1:17:30] essentially at the end of an hour's time
[1:17:31] the world was erased and it started from
[1:17:32] zero in terms of
[1:17:34] in terms of the knowledge they had but
[1:17:37] they had
[1:17:38] as according to brother around they had
[1:17:39] far more knowledge than what we have
[1:17:41] you know and people live for 900 years
[1:17:43] you can accumulate a lot of knowledge
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:44] pass on a lot of stuff so he was saying
[1:17:47] when they built the pyramids of springs
[1:17:48] and so forth we couldn't build it today
[1:17:50] if we had to gasoline power electric
[1:17:51] power won't build it but atomic power
[1:17:52] will so he's saying they actually had
[1:17:53] atomic bombs and that's what caused this
[1:17:55] i think they tried to send something out
[1:17:57] into the firmament because there was a
[1:17:58] firmament above the heavens that had
[1:17:59] water there
[1:18:00] and that's that's why the earth could
[1:18:01] grow oh that's another subject
[1:18:04] i want to i want to labor on this for a
[1:18:06] bit though because this is hope this
[1:18:07] doesn't scare the children
[1:18:08] don't be scared by this it's not really
[1:18:09] scary people if you're in the world you
[1:18:11] don't know what it is but we know that
[1:18:12] it's just
[1:18:13] it's god investigating because brother
[1:18:14] brown said people are seeing these
[1:18:15] lights around everywhere but he's saying
[1:18:16] they're just investigating judgment
[1:18:18] angels
[1:18:19] finding out what's going on in the world
[1:18:20] this guy robert hastings
[1:18:22] he he was he actually was in um
[1:18:25] his father worked at some of these camps
[1:18:27] so he was privy to some of the um when
[1:18:28] he was a boy he would go in there and
[1:18:29] help clean and things and he would
[1:18:31] see the data and when he was a young
[1:18:33] younger fellow he saw these some of
[1:18:34] these lights on the radar so he was
[1:18:36] that got him interested so he spent his
[1:18:38] life trying to figure out what are these
[1:18:39] things and why are we seeing them
[1:18:41] specifically around nuclear development
[1:18:43] camps you know
[1:18:44] and and because in the 40s and 50s and
[1:18:47] 60s when they started
[1:18:49] having all these facilities that made
[1:18:51] that were developing nuclear bombs
[1:18:53] it became commonplace that there were
[1:18:55] always these unexplained lights hovering
[1:18:56] around the place and
[1:18:58] just all the time there are hundreds of
[1:19:00] testimonies
[1:19:01] of these vehicles things
[1:19:04] lights coming in and they're saying
[1:19:06] these things aren't they're not human
[1:19:07] they
[1:19:08] they move really quick they drive around
[1:19:09] they do these things it's not normal
[1:19:10] stuff you know
[1:19:11] and so all of the sites actually had
[1:19:13] these reported and
[1:19:15] it was this was only like five years ago
[1:19:17] these guys managed to this guy
[1:19:19] he only went on data from people that
[1:19:21] worked in these institutions when they
[1:19:23] were younger
[1:19:23] and and that they could verify with
[1:19:25] official information release
[1:19:27] act so they could find out yeah this
[1:19:29] stuff this happened you know it wasn't
[1:19:30] just someone saying oh that's what i saw
[1:19:31] it was actually
[1:19:32] this is official stuff you know they saw
[1:19:34] something well i guess what i'm saying
[1:19:36] is
[1:19:37] these guys saw something and these are
[1:19:38] reports they they they say they were
[1:19:40] there they were at this camp they saw a
[1:19:41] light come over you know one guy they
[1:19:42] said
[1:19:43] it hovered over th this guy here i think
[1:19:45] he said he said
[1:19:46] a lot of the lights were red some of
[1:19:47] them were white some but this guy said
[1:19:49] they saw a red light
[1:19:50] it came it hovered over the camp it came
[1:19:52] down to the front gate hung over the
[1:19:53] front gate they didn't know what it was
[1:19:55] and i think this was the one he said at
[1:19:56] that time 10 of their missiles were
[1:19:58] disabled so they couldn't launch 10 of
[1:20:00] them they went into
[1:20:00] this is official stuff once it happened
[1:20:02] they the missiles turned off they
[1:20:04] and they so they're saying if if we
[1:20:05] wanted to if the if the if the president
[1:20:07] at the time said launch the missiles
[1:20:08] 10 of these things wouldn't launch they
[1:20:10] just got switched off and
[1:20:12] this guy here his testimony was this big
[1:20:14] long type thing went and it
[1:20:16] hovered over the camp and then it sort
[1:20:17] of just flew away
[1:20:19] down the drive you know just hanging
[1:20:21] around looking what this guy here is
[1:20:23] saying
[1:20:23] same thing he's here to hover over the
[1:20:24] silo pit that's where that that opens up
[1:20:27] and the missile comes out
[1:20:29] and he said it was bright enough the
[1:20:30] official thing was it was bright enough
[1:20:32] to light the solar cap you know they
[1:20:33] could it was light this
[1:20:34] light hanging around this guy here this
[1:20:36] guy here said they saw about seven of
[1:20:37] these lights just coming over and
[1:20:38] hanging over the fence
[1:20:40] all the time they were seeing this stuff
[1:20:41] that they they
[1:20:43] and they so much so they start an
[1:20:46] investigation official investigation
[1:20:47] what's all this
[1:20:48] because it was sort of more of a defense
[1:20:50] issue you know we've got things hanging
[1:20:51] around our
[1:20:52] this is our main form of attack we've
[1:20:54] got things hanging around what's going
[1:20:55] on
[1:20:57] when you think about it it's a massive
[1:20:59] event for mankind this stuff is being
[1:21:00] made
[1:21:01] it's huge it's not just oh they're just
[1:21:04] making a new car
[1:21:05] this this is preparing for the
[1:21:07] destruction of mankind
[1:21:09] happening in a few little camps you know
[1:21:10] this is massive stuff this is not just a
[1:21:12] small
[1:21:13] deal there was investigating judgement
[1:21:15] angels what what
[1:21:16] just just to show this i'm gonna this
[1:21:19] this is a big deal that's going on that
[1:21:22] this was a big deal for mankind
[1:21:25] well this was another one actually
[1:21:26] received a call from the they said
[1:21:28] this official one was a large red and
[1:21:30] orange light that's hanging around and
[1:21:31] it looks like a long tubular shape and
[1:21:33] it's flying over the camp official stuff
[1:21:34] and that was
[1:21:36] this one here this big i found
[1:21:39] interesting they were kind of red a lot
[1:21:40] of them i
[1:21:41] always thought they were white and
[1:21:42] sources but oftentimes they just
[1:21:44] describe light they don't describe i saw
[1:21:45] the shiny saucer they say i saw light
[1:21:47] and if there were openings in it they
[1:21:49] said i saw a light more light on the
[1:21:50] inside
[1:21:51] coming out of these it was just light
[1:21:52] because and
[1:21:54] and they just moved funny in the sky
[1:21:57] this guy here actually said
[1:21:59] he said that after one had
[1:22:02] all of it over he said one of their
[1:22:06] nuclear warheads went into launch mode
[1:22:08] he said as a object passed over the
[1:22:09] missile
[1:22:10] site we would start getting erratic
[1:22:11] indications on that missile the bad
[1:22:12] thing was we also
[1:22:13] got a launch indicator does that mean
[1:22:14] the launching integrator has been
[1:22:16] triggered
[1:22:17] he said yes that means that the launch
[1:22:18] that missile has received a launch
[1:22:20] signal now launch signals come from the
[1:22:21] they need codes from the president and
[1:22:23] that to come in but he said this thing
[1:22:25] the russians had the same thing the
[1:22:26] russians that their one was on
[1:22:28] launch signal for 15 seconds before they
[1:22:30] could stop it and they they report
[1:22:32] seeing the same thing these these lights
[1:22:34] coming over because they were developing
[1:22:35] at the same time
[1:22:36] china reported the same thing they were
[1:22:38] investigated there was an investigation
[1:22:40] going on
[1:22:41] and this was their official this was
[1:22:42] their um
[1:22:44] investigation not demanded right
[1:22:47] sightings of unexplained objects at
[1:22:48] great altitudes and traveling at high
[1:22:50] speeds in the vicinity of major us
[1:22:51] defense installations are of such nature
[1:22:53] that they are not attributed to natural
[1:22:54] phenomena
[1:22:55] or non-types of aerial vehicles they're
[1:22:57] saying something's going on here we
[1:22:58] don't know what it is
[1:23:00] but it's an investigation because man is
[1:23:01] about to blow themselves up and destroy
[1:23:03] mankind
[1:23:04] see now we are post that we are now in a
[1:23:06] world this has all happened
[1:23:07] this is where we sit this is phenomenal
[1:23:11] when you think about what's happened and
[1:23:12] where we are at as a
[1:23:14] world back in those days it was in the
[1:23:16] 50s and 60s the plan was if one launched
[1:23:18] a nuclear weapon then
[1:23:20] say russia did then or vice versa then
[1:23:22] the americans and the russians they all
[1:23:24] had a way of getting them they had
[1:23:25] planes and so they would have these
[1:23:26] lightweight bombs on the planes and so
[1:23:28] so they would
[1:23:29] the plan was okay if you launch one and
[1:23:30] it blows some us up somewhere we've got
[1:23:32] all these planes at airports ready to go
[1:23:33] and we can
[1:23:34] we'll we'll fly these things out it
[1:23:36] takes a couple of hours we'll reach
[1:23:37] russia and we'll bomb you and then at
[1:23:39] the same time
[1:23:40] the russians will be sending their
[1:23:41] planes across the states and over into
[1:23:43] europe you know to to bomb
[1:23:44] that and and this was a couple of hour
[1:23:47] you know
[1:23:48] so okay let's do this and a few hours
[1:23:50] later you're sort of dropping these
[1:23:51] bombs a couple of hours that was
[1:23:52] so it was a couple of hours then
[1:23:54] everything would be blown up
[1:23:56] and then they made this thing called an
[1:23:58] intercontinental ballistic missile
[1:24:00] basically a space rocket with a bomb on
[1:24:02] it this can get around the world
[1:24:04] around the other side of the world in 30
[1:24:06] minutes so it went from
[1:24:08] a couple of hours to 30 minutes you can
[1:24:09] annihilate countries off the map
[1:24:12] and now it even progressed further than
[1:24:14] that because now there's nuclear
[1:24:15] submarines that are out off the coast of
[1:24:17] both countries like the russians have
[1:24:18] theirs off the coast of america america
[1:24:20] has theirs off the coast of everywhere
[1:24:21] and these things are 10 minutes
[1:24:22] 10 minutes or so in the country this
[1:24:24] country's done 10 minutes that's how far
[1:24:27] we are from destruction 10 minutes
[1:24:30] we're 10 minutes like 100 years ago we
[1:24:32] weren't 10 minutes from destruction
[1:24:34] now we're 10 minutes that's the world
[1:24:36] that we live in today
[1:24:37] pinch yourselves we've arrived that's
[1:24:39] why these things were hovering around
[1:24:40] what's go you know what are you guys
[1:24:42] making
[1:24:44] and i just want to talk about this for a
[1:24:45] minute there's the two babylonians
[1:24:46] because we know this is going to get
[1:24:47] used to blow up
[1:24:48] the vatican this and and and
[1:24:51] la's going to go down in the in the
[1:24:54] and the kings of the earth who have
[1:24:55] committed a fornication lived

[1:24:58] and lament her when they shall see the
[1:24:59] smoke of her burning

[1:26:53] to christ let us pray dear god
[1:26:55] whenever my spirit is shaking my heart
[1:26:57] is dropping tear drops of of warning
[1:26:58] granted a god that men and women
[1:27:00] will not think of what i've said as a
[1:27:02] joke and that the church people will not
[1:27:03] think of it as something that was
[1:27:05] prejudiced or against them may they see
[1:27:06] lord it's in love thou embarrassed me
[1:27:08] record almighty god that up and down
[1:27:10] this coast i've went year after year

[1:27:15] truth thou knowest this vision of the
[1:27:18] bride is the truth i've took your
[1:27:20] name by it lord and said it was thus
[1:27:22] saith the lord and i feel that i am
[1:27:23] conscious lord of what i'm doing
[1:27:26] so i pray the lord in jesus name let the
[1:27:28] people shake themselves tonight and flee
[1:27:30] from the wrath that is to come for
[1:27:32] ichigo has rode over the doors and over
[1:27:33] the nations of black checkmark has come
[1:27:35] across it after his investigation
[1:27:37] the spirit of god is grieved away from
[1:27:39] it and awaiting the balances and found
[1:27:41] wanting the feast
[1:27:42] of king nebuchadnezzar has repeated the
[1:27:43] game with drunken parties and half
[1:27:45] dressed
[1:27:45] woman calling himself christians oh god
[1:27:47] of heaven have mercy upon a sinful world
[1:27:49] and a sinful people
[1:27:50] lord as we are tonight god i'm trying to
[1:27:52] stand in the breach and ask for divine
[1:27:54] mercy that you'll speak into this crowd
[1:27:56] tonight and call your bride to attention
[1:27:57] lord
[1:27:58] to march not by the sign of any creed
[1:27:59] but by the sound of the gospel of the
[1:28:01] lord jesus christ granted oh god let it
[1:28:02] be known this night
[1:28:04] that thou art god and thy word is truth
[1:28:06] while solemnly
[1:28:07] in the face of this people we call them
[1:28:09] to attention
[1:28:10] of thy word that was an amazing
[1:28:14] meeting and an amazing time and that was
[1:28:15] an amazing prophecy
[1:28:17] it was a it was a game changer it was
[1:28:22] now around the same time i'm going to
[1:28:24] move to this one now the church was now
[1:28:26] under surveillance
[1:28:27] that not only was the world on
[1:28:29] surveillance but the church the churches
[1:28:31] are under surveillance by
[1:28:32] the word of god the word of god is
[1:28:34] sharper than any two-edged sword and the
[1:28:35] word of god has got a way to go down
[1:28:37] into someone's heart and see what's in
[1:28:38] there
[1:28:39] and and and at the same time when all
[1:28:42] this is happening the the the church now
[1:28:44] has having its own surveillance by
[1:28:46] by the the word of god that's going down
[1:28:47] and speaking and it's
[1:28:49] and it's it's directed at people's
[1:28:50] hearts and the way people respond
[1:28:53] is what they are to the word of god it
[1:28:55] was
[1:28:56] surveying people's hearts and before
[1:29:00] that we had excuse the world had excuse
[1:29:01] because this
[1:29:02] surveillance down into the heart hadn't
[1:29:04] happened so the world the church had an
[1:29:05] excuse to be doing what they're doing
[1:29:07] but there's no excuse anymore because
[1:29:09] the word has come and it's it's surveyed
[1:29:11] the hearts i want to read this then the
[1:29:12] orthodox standing around the church
[1:29:14] remembers they said this man is
[1:29:15] beelzebub speaking of jesus well he's
[1:29:17] the chief of fortune tellers that's what
[1:29:18] biased
[1:29:19] was the chief of devils they thought it
[1:29:21] was a telepathy of some sort and jesus
[1:29:22] said you speak
[1:29:24] that word against the son of man it
[1:29:25] shall be forgiven you but when the holy
[1:29:26] ghost has come
[1:29:27] and you speak a word against it it will
[1:29:28] never be forgiven you neither in this
[1:29:30] world
[1:29:30] or in the world that is to come do you
[1:29:32] get that church it will never be
[1:29:33] forgiven thee in a
[1:29:34] a word against it do you do you
[1:29:36] interpret it when the holy ghost has
[1:29:37] come it shall do the same things
[1:29:39] there was an excuse then because jesus
[1:29:41] had not
[1:29:42] been glorified neither had the blood
[1:29:44] been shed but after that blood had been
[1:29:45] shed
[1:29:46] and sin was paid for man was left
[1:29:48] without an excuse god once winked the
[1:29:49] ignorance of men but in this day he has
[1:29:51] called all men to repent
[1:29:52] one word against it is unpardonable it
[1:29:54] will never be forgiven you in this world
[1:29:56] neither in the world to come to sin
[1:29:57] against the holy spirit
[1:29:59] and that's saying calling it that's
[1:30:01] turning down the holy ghost
[1:30:04] calling it an unclean thing and i want
[1:30:06] to just go into this
[1:30:09] and whoever speaks the word against the
[1:30:10] son of man that shall be forgiven them
[1:30:11] but whosoever speaketh against the holy
[1:30:13] ghost that shall not be forgiven them
[1:30:14] neither in this world
[1:30:16] neither in the world to come now there's
[1:30:18] an unforgivable sin
[1:30:20] but but i want to put it like this the
[1:30:23] word of god is a divider
[1:30:25] we think oh the word of god is this you
[1:30:26] know that's this great thing that brings
[1:30:28] everyone together it doesn't
[1:30:29] it's a divider it separates the sheep
[1:30:32] from the goats
[1:30:33] it divides and god has got a way of
[1:30:36] going to somebody's heart with his word
[1:30:38] and discerning what they are and and
[1:30:42] dividing them out if you're if you
[1:30:45] and they make their choice right but
[1:30:48] but it divides and i just want to read
[1:30:49] the scripture think not that i'm come to
[1:30:51] send peace on earth i'm not come to send
[1:30:53] peace but a sword
[1:30:55] for i am come to see the man at variance
[1:30:57] against his father and the daughter
[1:30:58] against his mother and the
[1:30:59] daughter-in-law against her
[1:31:00] mother-in-law
[1:31:01] and a man's foe shall be they of his own
[1:31:03] household he that loveth father or
[1:31:05] mother more than me is not worthy of men
[1:31:06] here that love a son or daughter more
[1:31:07] than me is not worthy of me
[1:31:08] and he that taketh not his cross and
[1:31:10] followeth after me is not worthy of me
[1:31:12] he that findeth his life shall lose and
[1:31:13] he that loses loseth his life for my
[1:31:15] sake shall find it
[1:31:18] now the word of god you you accept the
[1:31:21] word of god your life doesn't go
[1:31:22] rosy and suddenly everyone loves you
[1:31:24] probably half your family will turn
[1:31:25] against you
[1:31:27] that's the way that's what this word
[1:31:28] does
[1:31:30] that how it works friends turn against
[1:31:32] you it's
[1:31:33] it jesus he and he warned us
[1:31:37] that's going to happen i'm not going to
[1:31:39] make it all work out for you this is the
[1:31:41] way that it's going to happen for some
[1:31:42] of you
[1:31:43] now that's i'm just saying what the word
[1:31:44] of god says
[1:31:47] i want to show you when it divided and
[1:31:49] and it it separated and when jesus was
[1:31:51] here he said
[1:31:52] after he preached about you know if you
[1:31:54] drink my blood and that he started
[1:31:55] preaching these things
[1:31:56] many of his disciples when they heard of
[1:31:58] this they said this is a hard saying who
[1:31:59] can hear it
[1:32:01] when jesus knew himself that the
[1:32:02] disciples mermaid he said unto them
[1:32:04] doeth us offend you what and if you
[1:32:06] shall see the son of man ascending up to
[1:32:08] where he was before it is the spirit
[1:32:09] that quickeneth the flesh prophet of
[1:32:11] nothing the words that i speak unto you
[1:32:12] their spirit and their life
[1:32:14] and then i just come down a few verses
[1:32:15] and it says but there are some of you
[1:32:17] that believe not for jesus knew from the
[1:32:18] beginning
[1:32:19] who they were that believed and who
[1:32:21] should betray him and he said therefore
[1:32:23] said i unto you that no man can come
[1:32:25] unto me except they were given him of my
[1:32:26] father
[1:32:27] and then from that time many of his
[1:32:28] disciples went back and walked with him
[1:32:30] no more
[1:32:31] the word of god is a when it comes down
[1:32:34] it
[1:32:34] separates who is who because it has to
[1:32:37] be a way of separating who is who
[1:32:40] now we know the scripture here for it is
[1:32:42] impossible for those that are once
[1:32:43] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:32:44] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:32:46] the holy ghost and have tasted of the
[1:32:47] good word of god and the powers of the
[1:32:48] world to come
[1:32:49] if they shall fall again fall away to
[1:32:51] renew them again unto repentance seeing
[1:32:52] they crucified to themselves the son of
[1:32:54] god afresh and put them to an open shame
[1:32:57] for the earth which drinketh in the rain
[1:32:59] that cometh off the upon it bringeth
[1:33:00] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[1:33:02] received with blessing from god but that
[1:33:04] which beareth thorns and brides is
[1:33:05] rejected and is knight into cursing
[1:33:06] whose end is to be burned
[1:33:09] now we think oh if i if i don't do one
[1:33:12] thing i'm out
[1:33:14] it's not really like that if i can just
[1:33:17] make it because this the scripture is
[1:33:18] not
[1:33:19] although it is and it isn't it depends
[1:33:22] what
[1:33:22] seed is in you because that word has
[1:33:26] come to water the seed of god
[1:33:28] in people right so so that word will
[1:33:31] come
[1:33:31] now if what grows out of people is is
[1:33:34] that word then that's going to stay
[1:33:36] but if what comes up is a thorn
[1:33:40] or brian here that's not destined for
[1:33:42] the kingdom of god
[1:33:43] so that will actually that will enjoy
[1:33:46] the spirit of god
[1:33:47] enjoy all those things but the because
[1:33:48] the the thistle needs water as well it
[1:33:51] needs things that
[1:33:52] but it will not accept that word because
[1:33:53] it's not part of it
[1:33:55] and and when the word of god comes down
[1:33:57] it will it separates out
[1:33:59] the tears from the wheat it separates
[1:34:01] out these things
[1:34:03] and that's why this one says not
[1:34:06] everyone that comes unto me and says
[1:34:07] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:34:08] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:34:09] father which is in heaven many will say
[1:34:11] to me that thy lord lord have not been
[1:34:12] prophesied in their name and the no name
[1:34:13] of cast that devils in my name have done
[1:34:15] many wonderful works
[1:34:16] and then i was professed unto them i
[1:34:17] never knew you depart from a year that
[1:34:19] work iniquity
[1:34:21] that's the word of god separates out
[1:34:23] who's who
[1:34:24] the and the investigation has come down
[1:34:27] and it's it's separated and you can see
[1:34:29] the results of the separation the church
[1:34:30] is just going into darkness
[1:34:32] it's just and and some of the things
[1:34:36] every now and then to keep my i
[1:34:37] shouldn't say but to keep my blood
[1:34:38] boiling i just watch
[1:34:39] sort of all sorts of churches different
[1:34:41] things and just see what's going on to
[1:34:43] kind of keep a gage on
[1:34:44] i often say to shannon i'm going to do
[1:34:45] some research just to make sure the
[1:34:46] world's still falling apart
[1:34:48] yep that's still still on track i don't
[1:34:51] i don't want to make light of it but
[1:34:52] we have to sometimes yeah otherwise we
[1:34:55] go
[1:34:56] you know if my mind gets too intense and
[1:34:58] i go insane you know i've just got to
[1:35:00] i know it's happening for the eyes of
[1:35:02] the lord i want to move on for the eyes
[1:35:04] of the lord
[1:35:05] run to and fro throughout the whole
[1:35:06] earth to show himself strong on the
[1:35:07] behalf of them whose heart is perfect
[1:35:09] towards him
[1:35:10] now i'm going to move on a bit now the
[1:35:12] bride unsurveillance then i've got one
[1:35:13] more then we're done
[1:35:15] the bright under surveillance i couldn't
[1:35:18] for the for the lack of finding
[1:35:19] something
[1:35:20] better i just want to read this one
[1:35:21] because this was this was going to
[1:35:22] describe what i'm trying to say in a
[1:35:24] better context okay
[1:35:26] because the church has been under
[1:35:27] surveillance and they've you know it's
[1:35:28] happened that way but i just want to
[1:35:30] read you this and maybe some of the
[1:35:31] i also love these little tracks when i
[1:35:33] was a kid this is from jack chick
[1:35:35] he's just passed away he was in his 90s
[1:35:36] but he used to make these tracks
[1:35:38] and these outreach tricks and it's this
[1:35:41] guy
[1:35:41] he lived and then he died and then we
[1:35:43] pick him up here and it says now look
[1:35:45] i've lived a real good life i was no
[1:35:46] different than anyone else and the angel
[1:35:48] says everything's been recorded
[1:35:49] says next and then then it shows that is
[1:35:52] depiction of the
[1:35:53] now it's not exactly like this but his
[1:35:54] depiction of the great white throne
[1:35:56] judgment
[1:35:57] you know where they all stand and then
[1:36:01] and then this voice comes down says
[1:36:02] review his life yes lord and then this
[1:36:04] big screen comes up and it says this was
[1:36:06] your life
[1:36:07] now this will happen see this technology
[1:36:10] exists
[1:36:11] we we have all the cctv stuff you want
[1:36:13] to get someone in trouble oh we caught
[1:36:14] you on camera doing this you know was
[1:36:15] that you yeah so the police often use it
[1:36:17] or there is there did this do that
[1:36:19] one day everything is going to be played
[1:36:20] back everything
[1:36:23] and so this this this man's life began
[1:36:25] to get played back and he says look
[1:36:26] that's me as a baby does that mean
[1:36:28] everything i've ever done will be
[1:36:29] recorded
[1:36:30] there's me it's all been recorded it's
[1:36:32] all been under surveillance every single
[1:36:34] person's life and their thoughts and
[1:36:35] their motives and everything
[1:36:36] i'm looking forward to it actually
[1:36:38] because i've got a lot of questions
[1:36:39] about what happened
[1:36:40] in certain things i want to want to make
[1:36:41] light of it but each person is going to
[1:36:43] face this
[1:36:46] and then the screen starts playing and
[1:36:47] then he and then he sees stories and
[1:36:49] there there
[1:36:49] is a teenager and he's saying ha ha he's
[1:36:50] about to tell a dirty joke and this
[1:36:52] guy's thinking no don't say that joke
[1:36:54] here you know
[1:36:54] that was in the presence of god
[1:36:58] and then it and then it shows another
[1:37:00] one of him you know
[1:37:01] looking at a girl and thinking in his
[1:37:03] heart what he's thinking
[1:37:05] now his thoughts are being spoken it's
[1:37:08] even if his mouth was quiet his thoughts
[1:37:10] being spoken in this episode here
[1:37:11] and this is what will happen he says i
[1:37:14] remember that but no one saw me do it
[1:37:16] and as this played back every thing that
[1:37:18] he did in life is all played back and
[1:37:20] all his thoughts all his motives
[1:37:23] all of their intentions are played back
[1:37:28] there's surveillance and then he says
[1:37:31] well look there's me in church see i
[1:37:33] wasn't so bad
[1:37:34] and then the preacher's preaching and
[1:37:36] said for god so loved the world that he
[1:37:37] gave his only begotten son the host we
[1:37:38] have believed on him should not be here
[1:37:39] but heavy everlasting life
[1:37:41] and in his mind he's thinking i wonder
[1:37:42] who's winning the ball game or i wonder
[1:37:43] who's winning the rugby
[1:37:44] you know i wonder what i'm going to do
[1:37:46] later on and then the the
[1:37:48] preacher is still preaching and he's
[1:37:49] saying that if thou shalt confess with
[1:37:51] thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt
[1:37:52] believe thine heart
[1:37:54] that god who throws him from the dead
[1:37:55] thou shalt be saved and in his mind he's
[1:37:57] thinking i couldn't care less what time
[1:37:58] is it
[1:37:59] you know this is this is all going to
[1:38:00] play back and then he says jesus sat
[1:38:03] unto him i'm the way the truth and the
[1:38:05] life no man cometh unto the father but
[1:38:06] by me
[1:38:07] and he's walking away saying i don't
[1:38:09] need christ there's nothing wrong with
[1:38:10] me i'll make it my way
[1:38:11] and he's there thinking i must have been
[1:38:13] insane to turn that down
[1:38:15] but unfortunately this is going to be
[1:38:16] the journey the journey of
[1:38:19] many people but and the tracker says
[1:38:21] this can be your life
[1:38:23] and here here is this man as he's
[1:38:25] receiving the word of god and it says of
[1:38:26] course i believe the bible and i'm
[1:38:28] convinced that i'm lost i'm going to
[1:38:29] hell but what must i do to be saved
[1:38:31] repent surrender your life to christ
[1:38:32] acknowledge die for your sins and
[1:38:33] receive him as your savior
[1:38:35] and there's this man you know lord i am
[1:38:37] a sinner i repent of my sins and i will
[1:38:39] acknowledge it jesus
[1:38:40] i acknowledge jesus christ as my
[1:38:42] personal savior so he's
[1:38:43] he's accepting the lord and then it
[1:38:45] shows him of course his life
[1:38:48] is not always going to show like the
[1:38:49] bride will actually be judging the world
[1:38:50] but this is just for the purposes of
[1:38:52] this
[1:38:53] you know and showing him all the
[1:38:54] different things he did because he was a
[1:38:56] believer
[1:38:58] the reason why i'm saying this to you is
[1:39:00] because
[1:39:01] we are under a different administration
[1:39:04] in terms of surveillance and judgment
[1:39:07] right there are there are men and women
[1:39:10] out there that have
[1:39:11] rejected god whether in the christian
[1:39:13] circles or the non-christian circles and
[1:39:15] and they they essentially they can go
[1:39:18] through life sometimes
[1:39:19] seemingly not paying for any of the sins
[1:39:21] that they commit and you think wow this
[1:39:23] these guys just do anything they want to
[1:39:25] and they seem to just their life just
[1:39:26] goes a certain way and it gets blessed
[1:39:27] and everything happens and
[1:39:28] they seem to do anything that they want
[1:39:30] to they can't
[1:39:32] and it's not happening that way although
[1:39:33] it might seem like it but all of their
[1:39:35] sins are being stored up against the day
[1:39:37] of wrath
[1:39:37] there's a record of everything and it's
[1:39:39] just being saved up there's no there's
[1:39:40] no judgment here for it it's just
[1:39:42] saved up saved up against the day of
[1:39:44] judgment that's what's happening
[1:39:45] with them right but but we get the same
[1:39:47] surveillance
[1:39:48] our surveillance upon us is exactly the
[1:39:50] same but because we have surrendered our
[1:39:53] life to christ
[1:39:54] we get judged here on a regular basis
[1:39:58] we we we say we the lord pricks our
[1:40:01] heart hey you did that
[1:40:03] lord i was wrong we get we we get
[1:40:05] chastised we get that we we're under
[1:40:06] constant surveillance but
[1:40:08] my record of my life is not going to be
[1:40:10] played back or at least not the bad
[1:40:11] parts
[1:40:12] they've all been deleted see like like
[1:40:15] brother brown calls the justification
[1:40:16] it's justified never did it in the first
[1:40:17] place
[1:40:20] i can't explain how it works but i just
[1:40:22] want to say that
[1:40:24] the lord knows when i sin but he doesn't
[1:40:27] know when i sin if you know what i mean
[1:40:28] like
[1:40:29] like it's not going to be played back
[1:40:30] here as a record of me sinning
[1:40:33] but i can't just go through life and
[1:40:34] commit something yeah the lord's just
[1:40:35] forgiven me well
[1:40:38] well he saw me do it and he knows maybe
[1:40:40] i've got to change and say so i'm gonna
[1:40:41] it's a personal thing i have with the
[1:40:43] lord you know that's why this scripture
[1:40:45] here says
[1:40:46] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:40:48] should not be judged but when we are
[1:40:49] judged
[1:40:50] we are chasing of the lord that we
[1:40:51] should not be condemned with the world
[1:40:53] so the bride gets surveillance
[1:40:54] every day you're being watched your
[1:40:56] every motive your thoughts everything is
[1:40:58] being watched
[1:40:59] is being listened to and you're being
[1:41:00] judged and the lord is the the lord is
[1:41:02] as
[1:41:03] as then he comes and tells you it's like
[1:41:05] it's like david you know
[1:41:07] david is a type of this sort of way you
[1:41:08] know david david
[1:41:11] was with beersheba thought he did this
[1:41:13] thing then he had and then
[1:41:14] when she was pregnant he thought i know
[1:41:17] what am i going to do so he tried he
[1:41:18] tries to do this big cover-up scheme and
[1:41:20] get you rider come and
[1:41:21] get him drunk go back to his house call
[1:41:23] him back from the army go back to your
[1:41:25] house and then
[1:41:25] that he would be with his wife and then
[1:41:27] send him back to the field so then his
[1:41:28] wife could say oh this
[1:41:29] uriah was the father of the child but he
[1:41:31] said no i'm not going to go in there
[1:41:33] i'm going to my men are out in the field
[1:41:34] i'm going to sleep on the front porch
[1:41:35] who do you think told him to do that
[1:41:38] god he said no no you're not i'm going
[1:41:40] to make the circumstances so you can't
[1:41:41] cover this one up so god
[1:41:43] uriah probably always went inside but
[1:41:45] he's like you know what i just
[1:41:46] something about what happened last week
[1:41:48] and those guys out there i just can't do
[1:41:49] it i'm going to sleep on the porch
[1:41:50] and he tried to do it again get him
[1:41:52] drunk and he just he slipped on the
[1:41:53] porch then he went back and then
[1:41:54] so then david had him killed but
[1:41:58] you speak of surveillance then then the
[1:42:00] prophet nathan came back to him
[1:42:02] essentially play back the tape
[1:42:03] from god hey we've been watching you
[1:42:05] david this is what's happened
[1:42:07] yes here's your his and they played the
[1:42:08] tape we caught you but you know
[1:42:10] as a christian we just say caught me
[1:42:14] like david lord i repent i'm wrong it
[1:42:16] was me i repent it was me yeah
[1:42:18] do what you got to do i'm not running
[1:42:21] i'm not hiding i've surrendered
[1:42:22] i surrender them all that's it i repent
[1:42:25] but that's mercy see that the quote we
[1:42:28] read this morning i think on the word
[1:42:29] for the day that's
[1:42:30] actually mercy to be in that position as
[1:42:32] grace
[1:42:33] because could you many people did this
[1:42:36] many people did what david did god
[1:42:38] didn't go and see them about it
[1:42:40] because they didn't want them to they
[1:42:42] they but they will pay for it on the day
[1:42:44] of judgment they'll pay for all their
[1:42:45] sins but
[1:42:46] god has taken all our sins now he just
[1:42:48] deals with us personally his
[1:42:49] surveillance is
[1:42:50] just with us personally but it's grace
[1:42:53] it's grace
[1:42:55] for the eyes of the lord are over the
[1:42:56] righteous and his ears are opened unto
[1:42:57] their prayers but the face of the lord
[1:42:59] is against them to do evil
[1:43:00] now i'm closing with this one i want to
[1:43:02] take this now to a slightly different
[1:43:04] surveillance because it's not all like
[1:43:08] it's not all in a negative context of
[1:43:10] surveillance for thus saith the lord of
[1:43:12] hosts
[1:43:13] after the glory hath he sent me unto the
[1:43:15] nations which spoiled you
[1:43:17] for he that toucheth you toucheth the
[1:43:18] apple of his eye
[1:43:20] now i want to say that we are under
[1:43:22] surveillance from god in a good way to
[1:43:25] look after us
[1:43:27] and and amen i like a picture like this
[1:43:30] you know
[1:43:31] here's this see you are that person
[1:43:33] sitting in the carriage
[1:43:34] to god you're important you know
[1:43:37] important people
[1:43:38] who's got who here has bodyguards no
[1:43:42] well okay naturally speaking that you
[1:43:44] know we're not really it shows i'm not
[1:43:46] that important i don't have a bodyguard
[1:43:47] but the more important i get
[1:43:48] if i get to a certain level of
[1:43:50] importance i'll end up with a bodyguard
[1:43:52] because i'm important you know you've
[1:43:53] got to look after this guy we don't we
[1:43:54] can't let anything happen to this guy
[1:43:56] he's important
[1:43:57] i want to let you know that we're like
[1:43:59] that man or woman sitting in the
[1:44:00] carriage there
[1:44:01] to god we are important we are important
[1:44:04] and he's got we've got our bodyguards
[1:44:06] all the time
[1:44:07] all the time watching over us watching
[1:44:09] every move when we wake up in the
[1:44:10] morning we're being watched
[1:44:12] we're being protected we're under
[1:44:14] constant surveillance these men
[1:44:16] and women these great men and great
[1:44:17] women are under constant surveillance so
[1:44:19] that they stay
[1:44:20] alive nothing happens to them we've got
[1:44:22] far better surveillance than we're gonna
[1:44:24] we got a far better security team than
[1:44:26] these guys do
[1:44:27] way way better than this
[1:44:30] i'm just gonna do this and i'm gonna go
[1:44:32] back to that right because i just want
[1:44:33] to talk about this there is no
[1:44:34] temptation taking you but such is common
[1:44:36] to man but god is faithful
[1:44:38] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:44:39] above that which you are able but what
[1:44:40] was the temptation also make a way of
[1:44:42] escape that you may be able to bear it
[1:44:45] satan's people just go through hard
[1:44:48] things and they get ruined and the end
[1:44:49] is destruction and doom
[1:44:51] there's no out there's no it will get
[1:44:53] better it's just destruction and doom
[1:44:56] although we go through things god's
[1:44:58] intention for us is not destruction and
[1:44:59] doom
[1:45:01] so god's always watching us doesn't
[1:45:02] matter what trial you're going through
[1:45:03] what's happening he's always watching us
[1:45:05] he's always watching us and if it gets
[1:45:07] too hard you know that they have some
[1:45:09] spy going in and doing some sort of deal
[1:45:10] with somebody you know and like they're
[1:45:12] saying
[1:45:13] they're doing and then they say look
[1:45:14] we're watching you if it all gets a bit
[1:45:16] heavy we're going to come get you out of
[1:45:17] there
[1:45:18] you know we'll if the if the situation
[1:45:20] doesn't go as we plan and the baddies
[1:45:22] start to get you i'll
[1:45:23] you know you don't worry we'll take them
[1:45:24] all out we'll pull you out so you can
[1:45:26] just go in there and do your thing
[1:45:28] that's what it's like for us you know
[1:45:30] there's not a trial that we're going to
[1:45:31] go through that we're going to end up
[1:45:32] being annihilated and we cannot go
[1:45:34] through it and we're going to come out
[1:45:35] the other end just broken
[1:45:38] god as god is watching over us in every
[1:45:39] trial that if it gets to a certain point
[1:45:41] he's going to pull us out it's all right
[1:45:42] i'm going to make a way there's going to
[1:45:43] be an escape for you
[1:45:45] it's not going to ruin you none of your
[1:45:46] trials that you go through you think
[1:45:47] lord this is so hard
[1:45:48] it's not going to ruin you it's going to
[1:45:50] build you up
[1:45:52] the angel of the lord encamps around
[1:45:54] about them that fear him and delivereth
[1:45:56] them
[1:45:57] every single day we've got angels
[1:45:59] surveying we're under surveillance we're
[1:46:01] being watched
[1:46:02] not not to see what bad we do but to
[1:46:04] protect us to care for us
[1:46:06] god's watching our every move every
[1:46:07] single day well he shall give his angels
[1:46:10] charge over thee to keep thee in
[1:46:12] all thy ways they shall bear thee up in
[1:46:14] their heads lest thou dash life foot
[1:46:16] against the stone
[1:46:17] satan tried to twist that around but
[1:46:18] that's our scripture he's going to
[1:46:20] protect us in all our ways
[1:46:22] everywhere you go you go to work you've
[1:46:23] been watched watched over you go you're
[1:46:25] driving a car you're being watched over
[1:46:27] you go to you go to bed you're being
[1:46:29] watched everywhere you've been
[1:46:30] you you're being watched over so that
[1:46:32] god can look after us
[1:46:35] the lord bless thee you like this one
[1:46:37] and keep thee the lord make his face
[1:46:38] shine upon thee
[1:46:40] and be gracious unto thee the lord lift
[1:46:43] up his countenance upon thee and give
[1:46:44] thee peace
[1:46:46] that's this that's we want the
[1:46:48] surveillance of god his face to be
[1:46:50] shining upon us
[1:46:51] and and to be smiling and that's you
[1:46:53] know when we surrender our life to god
[1:46:54] and we just walk in his ways
[1:46:56] we've actually got the favor of god
[1:46:58] smiling upon us
[1:46:59] and and looking upon us with happiness
[1:47:01] my earliest memory
[1:47:03] when i was a little i think i was six
[1:47:05] months old my mother used to put me in a
[1:47:09] she had an old clothesline and she would
[1:47:10] hang the sheets on the clothesline
[1:47:12] and peg the sheets in and she would put
[1:47:14] me inside the sheet so
[1:47:15] imagine i was only a little guy six
[1:47:17] months old and i would lay in the sheet
[1:47:19] on the clothesline
[1:47:20] as she was pegging up the clothes i was
[1:47:22] six months old
[1:47:23] i remember this i remember looking up
[1:47:26] and seeing my mother
[1:47:27] smiling down at me looking at me in the
[1:47:29] sheet
[1:47:31] and i think i was six months old because
[1:47:33] she wouldn't be smiling at a
[1:47:34] three-year-old in there
[1:47:35] but you know but you know a little baby
[1:47:37] but i remember that and i i remember
[1:47:39] feeling so good at the time like man i'm
[1:47:41] well looked after
[1:47:42] i'm just life is awesome but i just
[1:47:45] remember thinking that i'm so
[1:47:46] safe i'm so happy because i saw my
[1:47:48] mother's smiling face looking down at me
[1:47:51] that's what it is like with god his face
[1:47:53] is
[1:47:54] looking down on us in love it's smiling
[1:47:56] upon us
[1:47:57] he's not out to do us harm he's actually
[1:47:59] smiling upon us to
[1:48:00] to look after us watch out for us and
[1:48:02] keep us in all our ways
[1:48:04] he's not out to do us wrong or to make
[1:48:06] our life bad he's out to look after us
[1:48:08] that's the
[1:48:08] that's and he's he's just watching us
[1:48:10] all the time i tell you what there's
[1:48:11] nothing like the favor of god and his
[1:48:13] blessing upon your life
[1:48:15] when you just when you know that he's
[1:48:16] looking at you and he loves you
[1:48:22] i've got two more stories that i'm
[1:48:23] closing there was a man praying and he
[1:48:25] wanted someone to come visit him and he
[1:48:27] this is a true story but i couldn't find
[1:48:28] it but i know it's a true story
[1:48:30] but i just couldn't find the actual
[1:48:32] information about it but i'll retell it
[1:48:34] to you the way that i heard it
[1:48:36] i think he was asking a man was going
[1:48:38] around
[1:48:39] and back in the olden times when men
[1:48:41] would walk around and he was going
[1:48:42] around ministering to people and
[1:48:44] maybe taking bibles and preaching to
[1:48:46] different areas remote areas
[1:48:47] and so he was walking down this big hill
[1:48:49] to go to this this man so
[1:48:51] so he got down to the bottom there and
[1:48:53] and the man at the bottom would have
[1:48:54] seen him
[1:48:55] far off and walking down and the man
[1:48:58] said
[1:48:58] oh where's the other you know where's
[1:49:00] your friend and this man says what no
[1:49:02] i'm by myself he says what no there was
[1:49:04] a they'll tell you when you were walking
[1:49:05] down the hill
[1:49:06] down the down there very bad rocky face
[1:49:09] there tell you there where's the other
[1:49:10] guy
[1:49:11] but it was the angel of the lord just
[1:49:12] walking with him the whole way
[1:49:14] he was by himself i just want to tell
[1:49:17] you this story
[1:49:18] i don't know why i want to share this
[1:49:19] but it's the story of my father and he
[1:49:22] was
[1:49:23] he was um we lived in the country
[1:49:25] growing up country roads like this you
[1:49:26] know and he had this old
[1:49:28] holden hq station wagon and his wife was
[1:49:30] stopped working so it got all
[1:49:31] the dusty road got dust on the
[1:49:33] windshield and he couldn't wipe it so
[1:49:35] when he was driving to work he drove up
[1:49:36] this road and the dust
[1:49:38] that was on the windshield when the sun
[1:49:39] came over the hill and shone on the
[1:49:41] windshield he couldn't see anything
[1:49:42] winding up this road and he thought i
[1:49:46] know the road well enough i'm just going
[1:49:47] to drive around and
[1:49:48] i know that this corner is here and that
[1:49:49] corner is there and this is how we you
[1:49:50] know we just drive up there
[1:49:52] and and then i think he may be whistling
[1:49:55] a song or something like that and he was
[1:49:57] driving up this hill i would have been
[1:49:58] about
[1:49:59] five at the time i suppose and he said
[1:50:02] as he was driving you heard a voice yell
[1:50:03] out in the car
[1:50:04] stop turn right so he jammed on his
[1:50:06] brake
[1:50:07] and spun his car right as soon as he
[1:50:09] heard that voice yell out and he
[1:50:11] and he and he did a skid like that and
[1:50:14] came across and he
[1:50:15] and he was unknowingly just about to go
[1:50:17] straight off this bank and
[1:50:19] this is a big kill like we're talking
[1:50:20] i'm not exaggerating the story you
[1:50:22] go down the bank you die sort of thing
[1:50:24] but you know angels were watching over
[1:50:26] him
[1:50:26] to keep him in all his ways who yelled
[1:50:29] out to him you know
[1:50:30] this guy's about to go off the bank tell
[1:50:32] him to stop
[1:50:33] you know he his time's not done yet tell
[1:50:35] him to stop
[1:50:36] we have that same thing one is satan
[1:50:38] doesn't do that for his people
[1:50:40] he doesn't do that the eyes of the lord
[1:50:42] are upon the righteous and
[1:50:44] his ears are open unto the cry this is
[1:50:45] my last scripture i'm going to read and
[1:50:46] then we're going to sing a song
[1:50:48] this is from psalms and i just want you
[1:50:49] to bear in mind everything that we've
[1:50:50] said
[1:50:51] oh lord thou has searched me and known
[1:50:53] me thou knowest my down sitting and my
[1:50:56] uprising
[1:50:57] thou understandeth my thought afar off
[1:50:59] thou compasseth
[1:51:01] my path am i lying down and are
[1:51:03] acquainted with all my ways for there is
[1:51:06] not a word in my tongue
[1:51:08] but o lord thou knowest it altogether
[1:51:11] thou has beset me
[1:51:12] behind and before and laid thy hand upon
[1:51:14] me
[1:51:15] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[1:51:17] it is too high i cannot attain unto it
[1:51:20] whether shall i go from thy spirit or
[1:51:22] whether shall i flee from thy presence
[1:51:24] if i ascend up into heaven thou art
[1:51:26] there if i make my bed and how behold
[1:51:28] thou art there
[1:51:29] if i take the wings of the morning and
[1:51:30] dwell in the outermost parts of the sea
[1:51:33] even there shall thy hand lead me and
[1:51:36] thy right hand shall hold me
[1:51:38] if i say surely the darkness shall cover
[1:51:40] me even the night shall be light about
[1:51:42] me
[1:51:43] yea the darkness hideth not from thee
[1:51:46] but the night shineth is the day
[1:51:48] the darkness and the light are both
[1:51:49] alike to thee for thou hast possessed my
[1:51:51] reigns
[1:51:52] thou hast covered me in thy mother's
[1:51:54] womb i will praise thee for i am
[1:51:56] fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:51:58] marvelous otherwise and that my soul not
[1:52:01] write well
[1:52:02] my substance was not hid from thee when
[1:52:04] i was made in secret and curiously
[1:52:06] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:52:09] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[1:52:12] being
[1:52:12] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[1:52:15] were written
[1:52:16] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:52:19] as yet there was none of them
[1:52:21] how precious are they thoughts unto me o
[1:52:23] god how great is the sum of them
[1:52:26] if i should count them they are more in
[1:52:27] number than the sand
