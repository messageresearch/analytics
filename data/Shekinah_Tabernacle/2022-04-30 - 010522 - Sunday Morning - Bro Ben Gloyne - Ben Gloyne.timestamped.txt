[44:01] tongues interpretation and you know he
[44:03] went and spoke to them one was a genuine
[44:04] christian the other one was a hypocrite
[44:06] and he just couldn't work this out and
[44:07] he was praying and god would you know
[44:09] god would open his bible and show them
[44:11] about the wheat and the tears and the
[44:13] you know the just and the unjust how the
[44:14] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[44:16] and the you know the rain falls on the
[44:18] wheat and the tears and they both grow
[44:19] by the same rain and you know and you're
[44:21] saying that yeah that those plants were
[44:24] representing people claiming to be
[44:25] christians that the wheat and the tears
[44:27] shout in the presence of the rain
[44:30] they shout in the prince of god you know
[44:32] i heard one preacher say years ago you
[44:34] know if you're a tear at least be a
[44:35] bible tear leash out you know but
[44:37] but you know i don't believe i'm looking
[44:39] at tears this morning but what i'm
[44:40] saying is that it's very easy to rejoice
[44:42] in camp it's very easy to be i'm a
[44:45] christian and be overcoming and you know
[44:47] it's like the every devil's under your
[44:48] feet and you're about to step into a
[44:49] rapture and you know god's moving in a
[44:51] powerful way it's easy to rejoice and
[44:53] shout in those moments and we need those
[44:55] moments we need god to come and stir the
[44:57] waters we need us we need him to touch
[44:59] us and change us and have those moments
[45:01] of you know when god comes down and
[45:03] maybe things we've been carrying for
[45:04] many years or months or weeks they get
[45:06] broken off our lives you know we need
[45:07] those moments we need those moments so
[45:09] i'm not in no way i'm just i'm not
[45:11] disqualifying those things i hate a
[45:14] powerless dead religion god does too i'm
[45:16] not here to go through some formality
[45:18] i'm not here just to fill time on a
[45:19] sunday morning i mean but we're here to
[45:22] be in the presence of god that god would
[45:23] supernaturally change us remember and
[45:25] see that the dynamics of the end time
[45:27] church will be a refilling of the holy
[45:29] ghost so there i'm in no way discounting
[45:31] those things maybe i lean too much on
[45:33] that side but i think that's a good way
[45:35] to lean
[45:36] amen because you just let god work and
[45:38] he'll put us in our position he'll bring
[45:39] the church order he'll do what he needs
[45:41] to do let him do the job remember we are
[45:43] his workmanship we're not our own this
[45:45] is not us trying to conform to the
[45:47] message our own humanity man has tried
[45:49] that churches have tried that they have
[45:51] miserably failed and we don't want to
[45:53] fail we want to we want to let god take
[45:55] control and take over our lives but what
[45:58] we need is a is a genuine experience
[46:01] that makes our everyday life different
[46:05] amen that's and i'm not saying we don't
[46:07] have that but uh but
[46:09] we need that
[46:11] brother i'm says in a hidden life in
[46:12] christ and the reason we're not getting
[46:14] anywhere today is because we've got too
[46:16] many dry eyed professions in church
[46:18] joinings lukewarm backslidden church
[46:21] members that's the truth we need more of
[46:23] the old-fashioned godsend saint paul's
[46:25] revival in the bible holy ghost power
[46:28] amen and breaking up to make people act
[46:30] different look different walk different
[46:32] talk different and be different and live
[46:34] different in their everyday life
[46:38] because remember christianity is not
[46:40] from a 10 to a 12 on a sunday and a
[46:42] wednesday from a 7 30 to 9 30 whatever
[46:45] time we have that's not christianity
[46:48] actually i'd say this is the lesser part
[46:49] of christianity christianity is an
[46:51] everyday rugged life where you're the
[46:54] same i trust you're the same here as you
[46:56] are in your work workplace or at school
[46:58] or at home you're the same person you're
[47:00] the same kind of christian everywhere
[47:02] you go
[47:03] jesus was the same on the on the sea of
[47:05] galilee as he was on mount
[47:07] transfiguration as he was in jerusalem
[47:09] as he was in nazareth he was the same
[47:11] kind of jesus he wasn't a different
[47:13] jesus he did not change his behavior how
[47:16] he you know what he did he didn't pull
[47:17] shady deals by himself you know when no
[47:20] one was around no one's sure so you know
[47:21] he didn't take shortcuts he was the same
[47:23] lord jesus everywhere he was amen and if
[47:27] he you know if if if he is the second
[47:29] adam
[47:30] and brother ram says that the identified
[47:32] masterpiece of god he's the first part
[47:34] of that masterpiece but the bride is the
[47:37] second even she's that part of that
[47:39] masterpiece and we're actually one
[47:41] should we not have the same kind of life
[47:43] because remember brother brahms i mean
[47:44] jesus said when the vine ever puts forth
[47:47] another branch
[47:48] it will produce the fruit right right ye
[47:50] are the branches and he's the vine now
[47:54] brother brahm says that denomination has
[47:56] been grafted in
[47:57] right so if you look you can actually
[47:59] see a piece where there's actually a
[48:00] graft line
[48:02] but brother ram says if the holy ghost
[48:04] ever puts forth another another branch
[48:06] it'll write another book of acts behind
[48:08] it so it's not a grafting of a different
[48:11] life or a different tree that's now
[48:13] living off the life of the vine it's
[48:14] that same vine putting forth a branch
[48:17] i mean so so the real believer is not
[48:18] grafted in
[48:20] we are part of the vine
[48:22] you can't see the differentiation
[48:24] between the vine and the branch the same
[48:27] life the same dna the same bark on the
[48:30] outside everything you can't see where
[48:32] it changes because the same who's ever
[48:34] seen grafting
[48:36] yeah
[48:37] my friend had an orchard this is back in
[48:39] gisborne they had a sheep farm and
[48:40] cattle but they had orchards in the
[48:42] valley and we did some grafting and you
[48:44] could see you could see where it you
[48:45] know
[48:46] but with the bride there's no grass mark
[48:48] because we're not grafted
[48:50] we're the same life
[48:53] the same life so if he was the same
[48:54] wherever he went
[48:56] we should be the same wherever we go
[48:59] amen because it's a rugged
[49:01] everyday life now
[49:03] it astounds me
[49:05] that we live in the greatest i'll say
[49:06] the greatest easiest country to live in
[49:10] brotherhood says there's a curse in soft
[49:12] living
[49:13] there's actually a curse in it
[49:15] but it's amazing that we have every tool
[49:18] to live a an easy life you know but yet
[49:21] people and but the problem with it is
[49:23] that it doesn't give a resolve
[49:26] it doesn't give a determination as i
[49:28] said the last time i was in png we went
[49:30] around the city dumping garoka and we
[49:33] got some firewood and these people
[49:34] they're not paid by the dump but they're
[49:36] they're looking for aluminium cans
[49:38] to to sell to get money to exist
[49:41] it's not a hobby it's this is their
[49:43] daily bread
[49:44] and they're not there moping around
[49:45] saying well it was me i hate my life and
[49:47] life is hard and poor me no they're
[49:49] happy they you know you drive past the
[49:52] market if i could dig up the video i
[49:53] could show you and they're waving how
[49:55] are you how are you doing good to see
[49:56] you they're happy people
[49:58] but but if you put a kiwi up in that
[50:00] kind of condition you put someone a kiwi
[50:03] up in the silver stream dump
[50:05] oh boy life is over
[50:07] life is horrible
[50:10] people are the same but it's the spirit
[50:13] upon them and it's their outlook that's
[50:14] different
[50:15] so now to me those kind of people are
[50:17] rugged people
[50:19] they are you know sure they may be in
[50:21] the bottom of the pile but they're not
[50:22] worried
[50:23] life's worth living
[50:25] life is worth it every day is important
[50:27] amen but you know we so we don't want to
[50:29] get conditioned by the soft living of
[50:31] this of this country now i'm not saying
[50:33] you have to go live in a shack to be a
[50:35] rugged christian no no we could be
[50:37] rugged christians you could be in the i
[50:38] don't know what the biggest houses
[50:40] fanciest house in new zealand is you
[50:41] could live in it
[50:43] you could be born in it live in it and
[50:44] be a rugged christian so it's not based
[50:46] on your circumstance and your and how
[50:48] many zeros you have in your bank and
[50:50] whatever no no no it's it's we should
[50:52] live a rugged life the holy ghost makes
[50:54] us rugged
[50:56] right he makes us rugged you know he
[50:58] doesn't make us a uh you know just a
[51:01] jellyfish you know we're not jellyfish
[51:03] we have backbone we have resolve the
[51:05] holy ghost has resolved right and he
[51:08] wants us to to to be a rugged kind of
[51:10] christian you know being a rugged
[51:12] christian means you can take some knocks
[51:14] and get back up you know you can you can
[51:16] actually weather some misunderstanding
[51:18] you can actually weather some even a
[51:19] falling out your brother ram says about
[51:21] the branhams he said they used to fight
[51:23] in the backyard all amongst one another
[51:25] but if someone else came in the front
[51:27] yard and started fighting they all
[51:28] gathered because i remember hey where
[51:30] where the same blood we're the same
[51:32] family sure i may not be able to stand
[51:34] my brother but hey if someone comes
[51:35] against him i'm on his side
[51:37] i mean and that's how we should be as
[51:39] believers sure we can fight in the
[51:41] backyard all we want but when the enemy
[51:42] comes
[51:43] when the enemy comes amen we're all
[51:45] united people
[51:47] amen united under one head hallelujah
[51:51] amen that's how we should be rugged
[51:53] christians
[51:55] amen so joseph now he had many days of
[51:58] monotony
[52:00] many days
[52:02] his life how did he find grace we we
[52:06] read there and um
[52:08] uh so i'm just trying to find it here
[52:10] where he found grace in the sight of
[52:12] potiphar
[52:14] we did
[52:15] we did read it
[52:17] verse 4 there in 39 he found grace now
[52:19] how did he find grace and part of his
[52:21] sight it wasn't that powerful or super
[52:23] spiritual and he just realized oh god's
[52:26] called him and he's gonna he's gonna
[52:27] save egypt he's gonna save my life one
[52:29] day and he's gonna gather his brethren
[52:31] and this is god's great plan and and
[52:33] christ is being revealed through the
[52:35] life of joseph he's a perfect type of
[52:36] christ no no he didn't have that kind of
[52:38] understanding but he saw joseph's
[52:41] conduct
[52:42] he saw the life that it because remember
[52:44] he just bought him as a slave it's just
[52:46] another commodity like a horse or a dog
[52:48] or a
[52:49] cattle whatever he it was just a tool in
[52:51] his hand to further his his household
[52:53] but then he saw how how joseph was
[52:55] conducting himself
[52:57] and how he was how how he was diligent
[52:59] in the small things brother man says
[53:01] it's the little things we leave undone
[53:02] of the problem not the big things it's
[53:04] the little things we leave undone and so
[53:06] and so he saw how he conducted himself
[53:08] how he treated the other servants how he
[53:10] treated his master how we how he was
[53:12] diligent and in the affairs placed in
[53:14] his hands see it's it's whatever's
[53:16] placed in our hand
[53:18] we should be diligent in it you say well
[53:21] you know i i'm just the guy that sweeps
[53:23] the floor you do a good job
[53:25] you be diligent sweeping floor he said
[53:27] well i just stand there and i don't know
[53:29] wave you know like the person who stands
[53:31] there came out on the mat and welcomes
[53:33] you you know i just do that job you do
[53:34] it real good
[53:36] you say well there's no purpose here i'm
[53:38] just going through the motions of life
[53:39] no you're not
[53:41] god wants to mold you
[53:42] and shape you in everyday living
[53:45] every day is important to god
[53:48] god doesn't say well i can't wait for
[53:49] the weekend yeah it's tuesday i've got
[53:51] monday itis or i'm on was it hump day
[53:53] wednesday or you know it's you know he
[53:56] doesn't think like that he's looking for
[53:58] character and he's going to mulder
[54:00] people into his character he's
[54:02] determined to do it but the thing is if
[54:03] we get all what's the point of tuesday
[54:05] and oh you know school what's the point
[54:08] of this assignment and no there's a
[54:09] purpose in it
[54:10] you say well i won't remember this i can
[54:12] guarantee you 95 of what i sat through
[54:15] university i cannot remember
[54:17] but there was a purpose in it
[54:19] right one we moved here because of a job
[54:21] but to this character in those things
[54:23] because god is looking for someone see
[54:25] his character he doesn't quit on a job
[54:29] he doesn't you know he doesn't say well
[54:31] this is too tough and you know what's
[54:32] the point and just throw it in no no he
[54:34] is he is he has resolved i think brother
[54:36] isaac preached it you know he has real
[54:38] resolve he's determined to see it
[54:40] through so you say well what's the point
[54:42] of learning this calculus you know
[54:44] trying to determine a object moving
[54:46] through three-dimensional space
[54:48] you may never use it in your life
[54:51] but it is so you get a bit of discipline
[54:56] because there'll always be something in
[54:57] life that's difficult
[54:59] you know and and but the thing is when
[55:02] you become an adult it's more your
[55:03] choice what's difficult and the thing is
[55:05] when you become an adult is your comfort
[55:07] zone becomes smaller because when you're
[55:09] a child your parents push you out of
[55:10] your comfort zone you're always going
[55:11] out of your comfort zone go to the
[55:13] school you should play this sport i want
[55:15] you to learn this oh you like violin go
[55:17] learn violin go to this person you know
[55:19] and and you're pushed out of your
[55:20] comfort zone all the time being a child
[55:22] you don't choose where you go on holiday
[55:24] what school you go to necessarily you
[55:26] know the hobbies you do and things
[55:27] you're kind of guided by your parents
[55:28] but you're always pushed out of your
[55:30] comfort zone but they've done they've
[55:31] done studies that people are happier
[55:33] when they're pushed out of their comfort
[55:35] zone because they're growing as a person
[55:37] they're actually their character is
[55:38] being developed but the problem is in
[55:39] this soft-soaked society that we live in
[55:42] is people's comfort zone can rapidly
[55:44] become very small
[55:46] and what happens is they don't grow
[55:48] as a as they now this is just on the
[55:50] natural side but even in these things
[55:51] our character is developed
[55:53] right so so our comfort zone rapidly
[55:56] gets smaller as we get older but we
[55:58] should never let it get so small that
[56:00] that you know something can upset your
[56:03] your life so easily
[56:05] we should never be so set in our ways
[56:08] when because many times as believers
[56:10] we've got to realize our comfort zone
[56:12] actually gets changed or we get pushed
[56:14] out of it because god wants to push us
[56:15] out of our comfort zone it's time for
[56:17] the next stage of your journey amen
[56:19] right joseph could never have become the
[56:22] man he was in pharaoh's house if he
[56:24] stayed there at his father's side as a
[56:26] spoiled favorite son right he had to be
[56:28] wrapped you say well that's a dramatic
[56:30] push out of a comfort zone god doesn't
[56:32] care
[56:34] because he has confidence in you and the
[56:36] seat he's placed in you he wants you to
[56:38] fly
[56:39] and he wants you to realize that you're
[56:41] built of the same material he's built
[56:44] out of just like mama eagle stirs up the
[56:46] nest because those baby eagles have got
[56:49] to realize that that that what they
[56:51] admire in their mother is actually in
[56:52] them
[56:53] you know they admire the power of her
[56:55] wings and how she can bring such good
[56:57] fresh meat to feed on and you know how
[56:59] she saws up and does incredible error
[57:02] you know aerodynamic you know movements
[57:03] and aerobatics and different things but
[57:05] the reason that their nest is stirred up
[57:07] is they need to realize i'm built on the
[57:09] same stuff
[57:10] i'm not lesser than mama i'm not i'm not
[57:13] a different kind of bird that can't do
[57:15] those kind of things actually it's in me
[57:17] it's within me to fly it's within me to
[57:20] soar it's within me to get my own prey
[57:22] and you know do those things and that's
[57:24] what god wants you to realize is you're
[57:26] built to the same material
[57:28] not a different material the bride and
[57:30] the groom are the same material
[57:32] amen so because remember that we are
[57:34] living in the time of the wedding of the
[57:37] lamb
[57:39] every church service is basically a
[57:41] proposal
[57:42] every sermon you hear is actually a
[57:44] proposal
[57:45] will you take me as your lawfully wedded
[57:48] husband that's what the lord is asking
[57:50] us
[57:51] will you in the good times in the bad
[57:53] rich or poorer sickness health till
[57:54] death do we pardon actually it's not
[57:56] that because we've got eternity you know
[57:58] because there's no separation with death
[58:00] between you and god remember death just
[58:01] changes our dwelling place we don't
[58:03] change who we are when we get on the
[58:05] other side that's why it's so vital you
[58:07] say one day i'll rejoice no today
[58:09] because who you are here is who you'll
[58:11] be over there
[58:12] you know we should never let i think it
[58:14] was actually um sister francis brother
[58:16] you know i'm your your grandma right was
[58:18] it francis yeah
[58:19] yeah so brother emerson uh ben's cousin
[58:22] stood up there at her funeral and and i
[58:24] thought it was such a blessed uh tribute
[58:26] he said you know that his grandmother
[58:28] never let her her physical limitations
[58:31] stop her serving god
[58:34] i mean so so we should never let our
[58:36] physical limitations that we perceive to
[58:39] stop us actually serving god
[58:41] amen so so it shouldn't be based on how
[58:43] well we you know sure if you're sick
[58:45] stay at home you know don't spread
[58:47] things but you know you get up and you
[58:48] have a bad day or you just have a bad
[58:50] morning don't let that stop you coming
[58:52] to church
[58:53] you know it's not based on well i just
[58:54] feel so good today and energized and
[58:57] though there'll be days when you don't
[58:58] feel that
[58:59] hallelujah but that shouldn't stop us
[59:01] serving god you know because remember
[59:03] our our walk with god should not be
[59:05] based on our our physical body you know
[59:08] eli eli got real fat he was the high
[59:11] priest
[59:12] and it was health issues
[59:14] were a big that was recorded because
[59:16] obviously his health became a problem
[59:18] and some people can get so fixated on
[59:20] their health we should be healthy okay
[59:22] we should be healthy yes
[59:24] amen this is not about growing the
[59:25] church this way
[59:27] right
[59:28] right we should be healthy but don't let
[59:30] that become your god don't let it become
[59:33] your fixation it should be nothing
[59:34] between my soul and my savior that
[59:37] should be your fixation look as
[59:38] everything is everything under the blood
[59:40] have i placed my whole life and my whole
[59:42] family all that i am and you know i said
[59:44] lord just just may there be no may there
[59:46] be no account not you know some people
[59:47] say keep a short account no i say keep
[59:49] no account
[59:50] there shall be nothing on that ledger
[59:53] amen
[59:54] so joseph proved himself to potiphar
[59:57] and that's how he found grace in the
[1:00:00] sight of potiphar now potiphar
[1:00:02] um we know he was just
[1:00:05] well let's just go back to joseph now
[1:00:07] joseph's whole life changed when he had
[1:00:08] those two dreams
[1:00:10] those were so ingrained into his soul
[1:00:14] he didn't know necessarily how the
[1:00:16] details of how it would be manifested
[1:00:18] but he knew it was going to happen
[1:00:20] so his whole life was now governed
[1:00:23] by those two dreams
[1:00:25] before that i don't know but after that
[1:00:27] his whole life was governed by those two
[1:00:29] dreams now those two dreams
[1:00:32] molded him in such a way
[1:00:34] that it didn't matter necessarily where
[1:00:36] he was if he was
[1:00:38] tied behind a camel of the ishmaelites
[1:00:40] going down to egypt or if he was in
[1:00:42] prison now all those things would have
[1:00:43] been traumatic events
[1:00:45] here your brothers which actually you
[1:00:47] know they're you're not having a good
[1:00:48] relationship with anyway because it says
[1:00:50] they couldn't even speak peaceably to
[1:00:52] them you know they just really disdain
[1:00:53] the guy
[1:00:55] and um you know but
[1:00:56] not you know we never he he would never
[1:00:58] have thought that his brothers were
[1:01:00] going to sell him to slavery
[1:01:01] and i doubt very much he would have
[1:01:03] thought they actually really wanted to
[1:01:04] kill him this was plan b
[1:01:06] and you know so there was a lot of
[1:01:07] trauma of those things in his life it
[1:01:09] would have been a great a great thing
[1:01:12] but yet he was so governed by those two
[1:01:14] dreams
[1:01:16] that
[1:01:16] i believe he could see that in everyday
[1:01:19] life he was stepping closer to the
[1:01:20] fulfillment of those two dreams
[1:01:22] amen now we have more than dreams
[1:01:26] we have a vindicated word
[1:01:28] amen and we have bible evidence of a
[1:01:30] holy ghost of the holy ghost moving in
[1:01:32] our lives
[1:01:33] proving that we're on our way to a
[1:01:35] rapture and actually we're in the
[1:01:36] rapture cycle already i mean because the
[1:01:38] lord himself has descended with the
[1:01:39] shout right that first thessalonians the
[1:01:41] rapture cycle has already begun because
[1:01:44] brother rahm said the shout is the
[1:01:45] message very clearly in the rapture
[1:01:46] sermon so so we are living in that time
[1:01:49] so we're living in the time of that
[1:01:50] fulfillment now but the thing is if he
[1:01:53] could live in such a way that two dreams
[1:01:55] govern his whole life
[1:01:56] how much more you and i that have had
[1:01:58] sermon after sermon message after
[1:02:01] message outpouring after outpouring
[1:02:03] revelation after revelation amen where
[1:02:05] he's revealed he's dropped into your
[1:02:07] heart you're the bride of christ you're
[1:02:09] made in my image you're my darling
[1:02:11] you're my beloved you're the you're the
[1:02:12] whole object of my love and attention
[1:02:15] and affection is you
[1:02:16] i mean that's what he's done hasn't he
[1:02:18] that's what he's shown you he chose me
[1:02:21] hallelujah
[1:02:23] amen that you know that's why the
[1:02:24] message came because he wanted to show
[1:02:26] you
[1:02:27] that you are the reason of his being
[1:02:30] hallelujah
[1:02:32] you know i know i've said it often but
[1:02:34] do you think we're going to be the only
[1:02:35] ones rejoicing around the throne
[1:02:37] our lord jesus is going to be rejoicing
[1:02:39] with us
[1:02:41] hallelujah because what he had in his
[1:02:42] mind is now material in front of him i
[1:02:45] mean where he thought of you at your
[1:02:46] best you know he knows exactly what
[1:02:48] you'll look like when you're on the
[1:02:49] throne he knows the age you know well
[1:02:51] you're what we think is h yo how will be
[1:02:53] our height our hair whatever you know
[1:02:56] it's like a great artist they have in
[1:02:57] their mind the inspiration to to to
[1:02:59] paint a painting or make a sculpture
[1:03:01] it's all in here
[1:03:02] but then it's got to come out
[1:03:05] amen and it comes out then they can
[1:03:06] rejoice what was in here now everyone
[1:03:09] can see it
[1:03:10] hallelujah it's the same thing with god
[1:03:12] and his heart was you
[1:03:14] redeemed made in his image
[1:03:16] amen and then now as we're walking with
[1:03:19] him the spirit man is being matured and
[1:03:21] growing that we're actually what's
[1:03:23] within us
[1:03:24] our maturity is actually matching
[1:03:26] what god saw before the foundation of
[1:03:28] the world so so eventually there'll come
[1:03:30] a time where we're not in time no more
[1:03:32] we're up in glory
[1:03:34] hallelujah and he comes out the wedding
[1:03:36] supper set
[1:03:37] and he comes out wipes away physically
[1:03:39] wipes away all our tears you don't need
[1:03:40] to cry a child no more it's all over
[1:03:43] hallelujah but he'll be rejoicing amen
[1:03:45] because the devil couldn't stop him
[1:03:48] i mean the enemy couldn't stop him what
[1:03:49] he purposed in his heart has there been
[1:03:52] been made flesh right now
[1:03:55] hallelujah so we won't be the only ones
[1:03:58] he's not going to be indifferent on that
[1:03:59] day
[1:04:00] you think we're excited for a body
[1:04:01] change he's real excited he's been
[1:04:03] waiting for i know how many eons of time
[1:04:05] when he first thought of you
[1:04:07] hallelujah before the foundation world
[1:04:09] he thought of you
[1:04:10] you know we're not just a number to god
[1:04:13] we are not just a number we are the most
[1:04:15] important object of his love and
[1:04:18] attention right now as you
[1:04:21] hallelujah
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:24] you know i love it where i just
[1:04:26] we'll come back to joseph but you know
[1:04:28] because it can be such a
[1:04:30] such a thing we can look at the great
[1:04:31] things like that
[1:04:33] but it's got to come down into our
[1:04:34] everyday life
[1:04:35] it should govern our everyday life
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:40] now
[1:04:42] he says in recognizing your day and its
[1:04:44] message he says now now i'm going to say
[1:04:46] something national force put israel in
[1:04:48] her homeland
[1:04:49] national force will put the church in
[1:04:51] the world council of churches
[1:04:53] but the power of god will put the people
[1:04:55] in the bride
[1:04:56] so it's not national forces economic
[1:04:59] effects whatever is going to put you in
[1:05:00] the bride
[1:05:02] it's not
[1:05:03] the prophet just told us
[1:05:06] so
[1:05:09] amen but the power of god i'll just
[1:05:10] repeat that because i like it but the
[1:05:12] power of god will put the people in the
[1:05:13] bride the world forces this way and the
[1:05:16] world forces that way but god forces
[1:05:18] upward the spirit of god which is the
[1:05:20] word of god my my word of spirit and
[1:05:22] life will put the bride in her place
[1:05:25] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:05:27] the word then she's in christ will put
[1:05:30] her in her place no national force will
[1:05:32] do it
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:33] you can take it up with malachi 4 if you
[1:05:35] don't believe that oh but the world's
[1:05:37] got to get a certain way and then then
[1:05:39] we'll be ready no no no no
[1:05:41] god puts us
[1:05:42] what is holding what is holding back the
[1:05:44] great tribulation
[1:05:46] it's not putin saying what is he going
[1:05:47] to do and wondering and how is this
[1:05:49] going to work out it's not america
[1:05:50] wondering how this is going to work out
[1:05:52] or nato or the eu no no it's actually
[1:05:54] because you're still here
[1:05:57] you are holding back chaos
[1:06:00] hallelujah you are but the world is
[1:06:02] falling apart because of you in the same
[1:06:04] token
[1:06:05] why because as the bride comes into
[1:06:07] order everything goes into disorder
[1:06:10] so
[1:06:11] it's not market forces which mean you
[1:06:14] can't buy
[1:06:16] jib it's you
[1:06:19] it's you coming into your position so we
[1:06:22] should actually expect the world to get
[1:06:24] worse because we're coming in line with
[1:06:26] the word more and more
[1:06:28] hallelujah and it's god putting you in
[1:06:30] line with the word with him more and
[1:06:31] more
[1:06:32] hallelujah so
[1:06:35] yeah
[1:06:37] praise a lot
[1:06:38] amen do you like to see the world
[1:06:40] falling apart no i don't i don't like to
[1:06:42] see people suffering things but the same
[1:06:44] token it was prophesied it has to happen
[1:06:48] that's why we should with prayer
[1:06:50] prayerfully find that last one so we can
[1:06:52] go home as the prophet said
[1:06:55] amen now no national force will do it
[1:06:57] but the national but the national force
[1:06:59] did drive israel to the homeland the
[1:07:01] national forces of the of the council of
[1:07:03] churches will drive every organization
[1:07:05] organization into it but the power of
[1:07:07] god will raise the bride and to glory
[1:07:09] out of it
[1:07:11] hallelujah
[1:07:12] amen so we can we can rejoice in that
[1:07:14] can't we
[1:07:16] now let no but it's it's interesting
[1:07:18] though like if we bring that into
[1:07:20] everyday life now
[1:07:21] brother brown makes this statement i'll
[1:07:22] just read this from questions and
[1:07:24] answers 54 he says now as i've often
[1:07:26] said
[1:07:27] i believe in the church here there's a
[1:07:29] row here and here lives mortal beings
[1:07:31] are talking about now dimensions
[1:07:33] and each one is a great
[1:07:35] color
[1:07:36] conglomeration of gaiety
[1:07:39] of blackness and and darkness mortals
[1:07:41] live in here this world
[1:07:43] but they are either influenced from this
[1:07:46] way or from that way
[1:07:48] you cannot be here a spiritual being
[1:07:51] sinner or saint without having an
[1:07:53] influence from the underworld or from
[1:07:54] the above world that's every man woman
[1:07:57] and child upon the earth
[1:07:59] if you are influenced from here
[1:08:02] you're from above
[1:08:04] you're celeste your body is waiting up
[1:08:06] here
[1:08:07] but if you're wicked and hypocritical
[1:08:09] and indifferent
[1:08:10] your celestial body is down here
[1:08:14] regardless of how much you think it's up
[1:08:15] there
[1:08:17] so
[1:08:19] because the fruit that you bear before
[1:08:21] people proves where you're from
[1:08:25] so you are here
[1:08:27] what you are somewhere else your life
[1:08:30] your life that you live here is just
[1:08:32] reflecting what your inheritance is when
[1:08:35] you leave
[1:08:36] here i think that's a big boom
[1:08:39] your life that you live here is just
[1:08:41] reflecting what your inheritance is when
[1:08:44] you leave here
[1:08:46] so
[1:08:47] if you're if your life is reflecting
[1:08:49] this world
[1:08:50] then then your inheritance is darkness
[1:08:53] right but if your life is reflecting the
[1:08:56] word of god
[1:08:57] then your inheritance is heaven amen so
[1:09:00] the life and you know what i love about
[1:09:01] right now is you can change your
[1:09:03] inheritance
[1:09:04] right you can actually turn down the
[1:09:06] devil's inheritance which is the lake of
[1:09:07] fire and you can sign up for god's
[1:09:09] inheritance because he said whosoever
[1:09:11] will let them come right so it's the
[1:09:13] life that you live is reflecting your
[1:09:15] inheritance amen so if so if you are not
[1:09:18] wicked if you're not hypocritical
[1:09:22] and you're not indifferent
[1:09:24] then your celestial body just using the
[1:09:26] prophet's words here is up there
[1:09:29] amen so that's why people can sit in
[1:09:31] church and be wicked hypocritical and
[1:09:33] indifferent but yet think they're up
[1:09:35] they're going up there that's why i say
[1:09:37] lord
[1:09:38] you know as he said by their fruits you
[1:09:40] shall know them
[1:09:42] may the fruit of our lives be him amen
[1:09:45] not
[1:09:47] a manufactured
[1:09:48] message culture
[1:09:50] amen we don't want to have some
[1:09:52] manufactured put on
[1:09:54] because it's very easy to to to put the
[1:09:56] denominations in that bracket but if
[1:09:58] it's just a manufactured message put on
[1:10:01] of just pretending god bless you brother
[1:10:03] god bless you as to how are you and
[1:10:04] dressing the part all those things but
[1:10:06] there's no life in here
[1:10:08] and you know
[1:10:10] and there's wickedness in here that's
[1:10:11] just a manufactured something we're
[1:10:13] never called to manufacture christianity
[1:10:16] a sheep does not manufacture wool they
[1:10:19] never ever have a quarterly meeting
[1:10:20] where they say this is our production
[1:10:22] this is the amount of feed we have this
[1:10:23] is more hours we've got to put in we're
[1:10:25] above budget below budget there's no
[1:10:27] budget you know
[1:10:29] no they don't have those kind of
[1:10:31] meetings they just live every day being
[1:10:34] sheep and the nature within them bears
[1:10:36] wool
[1:10:37] they can't help it you can't say sheep
[1:10:40] you know they they it's not a mind over
[1:10:42] matter thing
[1:10:43] a sheep can never have a meeting and
[1:10:45] they have one person your um you know
[1:10:46] the uh what do you call it a
[1:10:49] motivational speaker sheep stand there
[1:10:51] before the rest and say now now boys
[1:10:55] just get in your mind wool wool
[1:10:59] and this and they're standing maybe we
[1:11:01] said no i don't mean this is a joke but
[1:11:02] this is how ridiculous some people are
[1:11:04] you know you know and then and then we
[1:11:06] walk past the field and you know all we
[1:11:08] hear is ba
[1:11:09] ba
[1:11:10] and they're trying to you know trying to
[1:11:12] bear will no no it's a life this is more
[1:11:15] than mind over matter
[1:11:16] christianity is not mind over matter
[1:11:18] christianity is revelation
[1:11:20] where the lord drops his promises into
[1:11:22] your heart and you know it's going to
[1:11:23] happen it's not well i hope it works no
[1:11:26] no you know it works i mean so that's
[1:11:28] why if you need guidance in your life
[1:11:30] say lord i need revelation show me what
[1:11:32] i need to do amen show me where i need
[1:11:34] to go brother braham says that we should
[1:11:36] pray for revelation more than anything
[1:11:38] but do we pray for revelation
[1:11:41] lord and it's not to make this gray
[1:11:43] matter appear this big no forget that
[1:11:46] man's great matter has failed since the
[1:11:48] beginning of time since the fall so you
[1:11:50] know we need to pray lord reveal
[1:11:51] yourself in the situation show us away
[1:11:53] because when he reveals himself in a
[1:11:55] situation everyone can criticize what
[1:11:58] you're doing but you can take your your
[1:11:59] revelation back into the word and you
[1:12:01] can walk in peace
[1:12:04] irrespective of how people feel about it
[1:12:07] amen because we have to you know i pray
[1:12:10] we can walk in such a way that it's
[1:12:12] actually not us trying to do it we
[1:12:15] cannot not one of us can get into a
[1:12:17] rapture in our own ability
[1:12:20] it's god's ability but that doesn't mean
[1:12:22] we just sit back get fat and sassy as
[1:12:23] brother john and he said and you know
[1:12:25] forget about the whole thing no no we're
[1:12:27] going to push in as well we're going to
[1:12:28] give ourselves to it amen
[1:12:30] amen
[1:12:32] he says no i saw i'm just going back to
[1:12:34] this quote we are right now all just
[1:12:36] think of it we are right now glorified
[1:12:38] the prince of god born again believers
[1:12:40] for if this earthly tabernacle be
[1:12:42] dissolved we are we have one already
[1:12:44] waiting in glory not somewhere else
[1:12:46] right yonder already waiting now and
[1:12:48] these earthly bodies grown to be clothed
[1:12:51] upon with that immortality is that right
[1:12:53] sickness and aches and pains and
[1:12:54] disappointments and heartaches oh i'll
[1:12:56] be glad within that when the old pest
[1:12:58] house is closed up
[1:13:00] amen won't you yes sir we can go home
[1:13:03] that's right
[1:13:05] just we are grown to be clothed upon the
[1:13:08] spirits groaning oh when you look and
[1:13:10] see all the pains around about all the
[1:13:13] uh conglomeration stink and sin and
[1:13:15] mortal living deceit and everything i
[1:13:16] think oh god how much longer will it be
[1:13:19] now we've got to keep this very much in
[1:13:21] balance because sometimes when we so we
[1:13:24] should be burdened for this world
[1:13:25] we should sign cry for the abominations
[1:13:27] done in the city but at the same time we
[1:13:30] should be rejoicing full of glory and
[1:13:32] praise that he's redeemed
[1:13:33] redeemed us
[1:13:35] amen but the thing is if we get so
[1:13:37] caught up in the future we will miss the
[1:13:39] present
[1:13:40] we will miss the present if we saw one
[1:13:42] day one day it's gonna happen one day
[1:13:44] god's gonna pour us
[1:13:45] where are you in the bride's revival
[1:13:46] amen it's raining glory i'm the weather
[1:13:49] man i'll say it's raining what's going
[1:13:51] to happen tomorrow it's going to rain
[1:13:53] and the next day it's forecast until we
[1:13:55] go home
[1:13:56] it's raining if it's sunny where you are
[1:13:58] get out of the shade of unbelief and
[1:14:01] criticism and trouble whatever it is
[1:14:02] come into the reign of the spirit
[1:14:05] hallelujah amen amen so
[1:14:08] it's raining
[1:14:09] we have the revival we have the
[1:14:11] awakening who knows they're the bride of
[1:14:13] christ amen you've been awakened this
[1:14:15] word has awakened you it's not you that
[1:14:18] decided one day well i'm going to be mrs
[1:14:19] jesus today no no he already determined
[1:14:21] it
[1:14:22] amen but the thing is if we're always
[1:14:24] looking for tomorrow for a better day
[1:14:26] we miss today
[1:14:28] we shouldn't be always looking for
[1:14:29] tomorrow right now
[1:14:31] today should be the best day of your
[1:14:33] life
[1:14:35] oh but i was richer back then i had
[1:14:37] better tires back then i had less burden
[1:14:38] no no i'm not talking about those things
[1:14:41] trouble will be with us
[1:14:43] we have to work until these bodies are
[1:14:45] changed this is under the curse until
[1:14:47] this body's changed a lot of people want
[1:14:49] to get the spoken word that they don't
[1:14:50] have to go work
[1:14:52] we need a character development
[1:14:55] because i i'll be i'll just be frank
[1:14:57] honest i don't care about meals i want
[1:14:59] salvation for people
[1:15:00] that's all i'm interested in
[1:15:02] the stake will be there and gone and
[1:15:04] what i don't care about that i would
[1:15:05] rather starve
[1:15:07] and see my whole family and my extended
[1:15:09] family any you know colleagues whatever
[1:15:11] i'd rather see them come in and starve
[1:15:14] than be fat and sassy and see no one but
[1:15:16] enjoy a good wagyu
[1:15:18] that's spoken into existence who cares
[1:15:19] about those things those things will go
[1:15:23] but eternal life that's why haiti wright
[1:15:24] said the right thing that's right
[1:15:26] amen and that same anointing and the
[1:15:28] same faith is here that super anointing
[1:15:31] brother brown said that is here
[1:15:33] amen to change people's lives like her
[1:15:36] son's lives were changed i mean so
[1:15:40] we should look at everyday life
[1:15:43] we should be the same i'm maybe i'm just
[1:15:45] going around in circles but how we treat
[1:15:47] others
[1:15:49] should be we should treat a believer the
[1:15:51] same as a non-believer
[1:15:53] we should treat a believer the same as a
[1:15:55] make-believer now i'm not putting anyone
[1:15:58] in any categories not looking at anyone
[1:15:59] in particular so i'll just look at
[1:16:00] everyone at the same
[1:16:02] but we should treat everyone the same
[1:16:04] because jesus said if you love one
[1:16:06] another but don't love the sinner what
[1:16:08] reward do you have sinners love each
[1:16:10] other you know but if you can love the
[1:16:12] unlovable
[1:16:13] if you can treat the unlovable with the
[1:16:15] same love and respect as a as some godly
[1:16:17] man or woman or you know someone you
[1:16:19] love
[1:16:20] there's a reward in that and we are
[1:16:22] called to love the unlovable
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:25] you know it's easy to say oh divine love
[1:16:27] is here the caps are divine lovers here
[1:16:29] but it's got to put on flesh
[1:16:32] words are very cheap
[1:16:34] but actions you know
[1:16:36] they're not cheap
[1:16:39] amen so it's everyday life never ever
[1:16:42] think a day is just a wasted day as
[1:16:44] brother isaac preached a while ago on
[1:16:45] time a lot in time actually we a lot
[1:16:48] time to do nothing
[1:16:50] it's not you know it's not just
[1:16:51] something you can just you know if you
[1:16:52] further away you have a lot of that to
[1:16:54] frittering
[1:16:55] you know some of us are very good
[1:16:57] fritterers but let's not fritter no more
[1:17:00] okay because every day every day god is
[1:17:03] molding us every day god is shaping us
[1:17:05] it's through the monotony of what we
[1:17:08] call boring you know the problem with
[1:17:09] the the age we live in as you see
[1:17:11] people's lives on social media it's only
[1:17:14] highlights
[1:17:16] there's not the there's not the burnt
[1:17:17] coffee there's not the broken down car
[1:17:19] there's not another day at work there's
[1:17:21] not another same old problem or whatever
[1:17:23] this needs fixing all those monotony
[1:17:25] things no no it's the highlights look at
[1:17:27] where i am today all these influences
[1:17:29] and their staged photos of things and
[1:17:31] you know trying to say this is life no
[1:17:33] no it's not life
[1:17:34] that's actually just fake art
[1:17:36] that's all it is because it's not
[1:17:37] everyday life but the problem is that's
[1:17:39] pushed in front of people and they say i
[1:17:41] need to obtain to that but you can't
[1:17:43] obtain something that's not real
[1:17:46] because do you have a group of 30 people
[1:17:48] around you setting up those shots
[1:17:50] and millions of dollars to go to places
[1:17:52] and do those things
[1:17:54] is that everyday life
[1:17:56] no
[1:17:57] so why why try and live in a fantasy
[1:18:00] world when actually today's the best day
[1:18:02] and why is today the best day of our
[1:18:04] lives well if we could just realize i've
[1:18:06] been loose from the clutches of the
[1:18:08] devil by the blood of jesus christ i've
[1:18:10] been completely loosed i'm not i'm not
[1:18:13] in his pawn shop i'm not under his you
[1:18:15] know what i'm sure the devil can afflict
[1:18:17] our body and we get sick he can even
[1:18:20] afflict our spirit and we can be
[1:18:21] troubled in our mind but he can't touch
[1:18:23] that soul
[1:18:24] i mean he can't touch the real part of
[1:18:26] us that's actually hidden away in god
[1:18:28] hallelujah so today is the best day of
[1:18:30] my life i could be having the worst week
[1:18:32] ever but it's the best day of my life
[1:18:34] because i'm one day closer to him taking
[1:18:36] me away and he's doing something in my
[1:18:38] worst week of my life
[1:18:40] joseph no doubt when he got to the right
[1:18:42] hand and potiphar thought
[1:18:44] now here we are
[1:18:45] i've arrived he's the captain of the
[1:18:47] guard how high can you go
[1:18:49] he's made it
[1:18:50] we're in there all the potiphar he he
[1:18:52] came to a place in his life where all he
[1:18:54] knew was what he was eating in his next
[1:18:56] meal
[1:18:57] that's all he knew what he owned because
[1:18:58] joseph just had it all under his hand
[1:19:00] and nobody thought finally i'm ready
[1:19:03] but he wasn't ready
[1:19:05] because that wasn't the position that
[1:19:06] that god wanted him to be he need to get
[1:19:08] to pharaoh's right hand
[1:19:10] so he's there no doubt thinking i'm
[1:19:12] secure
[1:19:13] i've got my life sorted
[1:19:15] lord when are these dreams going to be
[1:19:17] fulfilled but he didn't realize he had
[1:19:19] to be in a dungeon
[1:19:20] forgotten for a couple of years before
[1:19:23] he came to his place
[1:19:26] you know we think sometimes we're ready
[1:19:29] who's had those moments i've had that
[1:19:31] moment
[1:19:32] i'm ready a lot just push the button
[1:19:34] dead in christ
[1:19:35] we're on schedule
[1:19:37] but god's schedule's different to our
[1:19:38] schedule
[1:19:40] we should not be so caught up in
[1:19:42] in our troubles
[1:19:44] and so tense about life and children and
[1:19:47] things you know
[1:19:48] the most powerful thing brother braham
[1:19:50] said is a committal to god
[1:19:53] it's a powerful thing when we can really
[1:19:54] commit our troubles and things to god
[1:19:56] that's a as he said it's one of the most
[1:19:58] powerful weapons placed in your hand
[1:20:00] when you actually commit them to god not
[1:20:02] just lord i give them to you but
[1:20:04] actually you got a string and you pull
[1:20:05] it back and say you know no you commit
[1:20:07] them
[1:20:08] and then once you've actually committed
[1:20:10] them to god you give thanks that the
[1:20:12] answer's on its way you give thanks that
[1:20:14] they're coming home you give thanks
[1:20:16] they're going to get saved because
[1:20:17] you've placed them in his hand
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:22] hallelujah that's what we need to do
[1:20:25] amen remember it's not our job to
[1:20:27] fulfill the word now this may sound
[1:20:29] wrong because we're here to fulfill the
[1:20:30] word but who's going to fulfill the
[1:20:32] promises of god in your life it's him
[1:20:35] it's not you yourself
[1:20:37] it's him it's our sure it's our
[1:20:39] obedience to the word but it's he the
[1:20:41] one that fulfills it
[1:20:44] amen so it's everyday life no
[1:20:49] hallelujah
[1:20:51] he says here and where i think pentecost
[1:20:53] failed
[1:20:54] now as i've said before
[1:20:57] i never put these things back there
[1:20:58] anymore i bring them into here
[1:21:01] because if you look through the bible
[1:21:03] i like to
[1:21:04] second kings is a great lesson for me
[1:21:07] because you see there's a cycle where
[1:21:09] godly kings they come to a spot
[1:21:12] and they either
[1:21:13] and they either we know every man has to
[1:21:15] fail sure and some you know and you know
[1:21:17] in some way but they get to a spot where
[1:21:18] they either stay humble with god and
[1:21:20] walk on or they're lifted up in pride
[1:21:22] thinking they can do anything because
[1:21:24] god has blessed them in the past and
[1:21:25] they fall into ruin like um um uzziah
[1:21:28] the king if i'm saying yo god blessed
[1:21:31] him so much he thought i can be a priest
[1:21:32] now
[1:21:34] i don't need to stay as just a king
[1:21:36] remember all the priesthood stop you
[1:21:37] have no right to offer sacrifices but he
[1:21:39] was so blessed by god he god in his mind
[1:21:42] i can do whatever i want and god will
[1:21:44] bless me
[1:21:45] but did he even even i think you know
[1:21:48] josiah godly king
[1:21:50] and then and then the egyptians are
[1:21:52] coming along and he just decides i'm
[1:21:53] gonna go fight them
[1:21:55] because he thought nothing could happen
[1:21:56] to me
[1:21:58] sadly he ended up dead
[1:22:01] so we can't just keep walking like
[1:22:03] everything i touch turns to gold
[1:22:06] we have to stay humble with our god
[1:22:08] we need to stay with a consecrated life
[1:22:10] no matter what stage of life we are we
[1:22:12] can't get complacent
[1:22:14] and just sit back and say well you know
[1:22:16] we can't live off our reputation
[1:22:19] reputation's just actually among men no
[1:22:22] and and the problem with the reputation
[1:22:23] is actually then a respect of persons
[1:22:26] comes in
[1:22:27] sure we respect what people have done in
[1:22:29] the past i'm not discounting what people
[1:22:30] have done or our testimonies we have but
[1:22:32] we can't just rest on our reputation
[1:22:35] like they did we've got to keep walking
[1:22:36] with god
[1:22:38] we need to walk humble with him he says
[1:22:40] and where i think pentecost failed now
[1:22:42] well what we need today is a consecrated
[1:22:45] life
[1:22:46] where you have to speak nothing god
[1:22:49] speaks in your place and he proves just
[1:22:51] what you are
[1:22:52] that's right the blood of jesus christ
[1:22:54] cleansing us from all unrighteousness
[1:22:57] then we have fellowship one with another
[1:22:59] the blood making us clean and holy
[1:23:02] we live
[1:23:03] so that we could walk up to any
[1:23:05] denomination a church or anything
[1:23:08] and say good morning my brother not a
[1:23:10] hypocrite he'd know it but with a true
[1:23:12] heart say how goes it with you and god
[1:23:14] today my dear brother like that and walk
[1:23:17] along talk with him have fellowship with
[1:23:18] him that's the way that's when you're
[1:23:21] getting salty
[1:23:23] so we don't want to ever approach anyone
[1:23:27] anyone so
[1:23:29] atheist
[1:23:30] agnostic
[1:23:32] whatever denomination doesn't matter how
[1:23:34] ridiculous you think in your mind we
[1:23:36] never want to ever think we're better
[1:23:37] than them
[1:23:39] we actually don't want to think well
[1:23:40] they've got nothing and i've got
[1:23:41] everything no god has everything
[1:23:43] and it was his supreme grace that
[1:23:45] reached out in his hand for you it
[1:23:46] wasn't you that decided i'm going to
[1:23:48] walk on the king's highway no god put
[1:23:50] you on the king's highway god cleansed
[1:23:51] you and put you on the king's highway
[1:23:53] and said walk up this way
[1:23:54] and then us you know
[1:23:57] one time no a couple of times me and my
[1:23:59] brother we were we were young 10 12
[1:24:01] around that age on my uncle's sheep
[1:24:04] station sheep and cattle station from
[1:24:05] the uh it's it's it's between wairua and
[1:24:08] gisborne the the the country you know
[1:24:09] not the coastal road the back road and
[1:24:11] they're like 500 sheep or whatever you
[1:24:14] know
[1:24:14] he gives us a quad bike and says now
[1:24:16] take the sheep up to that paddock along
[1:24:18] the road but we couldn't really fail
[1:24:20] because every gate was closed apart from
[1:24:21] the one they need to go into but all
[1:24:23] these sheep are walking along and then
[1:24:25] half the time you got to be walking
[1:24:27] along the ditches to get them out of the
[1:24:28] ditch and keep them on the road because
[1:24:29] they're walking oh there's grass here
[1:24:31] and they wander over here you're going
[1:24:32] this way but it's like this and they go
[1:24:34] eat over here and but we're going this
[1:24:35] way
[1:24:36] and it's the same thing with us
[1:24:38] we walk along the king's highway and
[1:24:40] then oh what's this over here and then
[1:24:42] we go like this and what's this over
[1:24:43] here we're just you know and and the
[1:24:45] great shepherd
[1:24:46] he's not behind us he's in front of us
[1:24:48] he's not hold on come this way
[1:24:50] don't get distracted by what you see in
[1:24:52] the world of what's going on over here
[1:24:54] or problems in the family or in the
[1:24:55] church no keep walking
[1:24:58] that's how we need to be
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:03] now now you can't do that just
[1:25:06] impersonating what's that being a real
[1:25:08] genuine how are you doing how's you in
[1:25:10] the lord talking with them being being
[1:25:12] real salty now you can't do that just
[1:25:14] impersonating you if you do it you're a
[1:25:16] hypocrite that's all if you do it just
[1:25:18] because you know it's a line of duty
[1:25:21] you don't do it at all
[1:25:23] so don't do it just because it's
[1:25:24] expected
[1:25:27] right stay before god until it's in your
[1:25:29] heart to do that
[1:25:31] then you're coming right with god do you
[1:25:33] believe that he says i believe with all
[1:25:34] my heart i think that's where the church
[1:25:36] has failed i think we've failed to bring
[1:25:39] love among us and to bring fellowship
[1:25:42] among the groups and things like that
[1:25:44] and we've tried to push ourselves into
[1:25:46] something that god has not ordained
[1:25:49] he hasn't ordained secretariat um
[1:25:52] i can't say the word but division i use
[1:25:54] that word
[1:25:55] you know he hasn't ordained that kind of
[1:25:56] thing he has an ordained well this
[1:25:57] church is better than that church now
[1:25:59] we're all the same the body of christ is
[1:26:01] the same around the world doesn't matter
[1:26:03] if where you go be the same spirit the
[1:26:06] same love the same revelation amen amen
[1:26:10] we are not this church is not better
[1:26:11] than any other church
[1:26:13] we should never get that in our mind oh
[1:26:15] we're special no no well the bride is
[1:26:17] special
[1:26:18] right we're all special to god
[1:26:21] we're the we're all the apple of his eye
[1:26:23] he doesn't have favorites
[1:26:26] we're all his favorite
[1:26:28] but you should have in your heart that
[1:26:29] you're his favorite
[1:26:31] that you know that should be how you are
[1:26:32] with god actually no i'm the apple of
[1:26:34] his eye i'm the favorite he loves me
[1:26:37] shouldn't you feel that way
[1:26:39] you know you should never think oh he he
[1:26:41] doesn't care about me oh i'm kind of on
[1:26:43] the out and out group of his bride and
[1:26:45] you know he he treats us all the same he
[1:26:47] loves us all the same amen
[1:26:50] amen so
[1:26:53] and things like that we've tried to push
[1:26:54] ourselves into saying that god has not
[1:26:55] ordained and i believe that if we would
[1:26:57] just walk back down the line to god and
[1:26:59] say god
[1:27:00] here i stand nothing all i have to offer
[1:27:03] you about my life but god i pray you'll
[1:27:06] let me live so that i'll find grace in
[1:27:07] your sight now now you're coming along
[1:27:10] getting pretty close to the kingdom
[1:27:11] that's right then you'll see a real
[1:27:14] healing
[1:27:15] meeting
[1:27:17] and this is when the great healing
[1:27:18] revival was going on
[1:27:20] is if we just walk along like that then
[1:27:22] you'll see a real healing meeting then
[1:27:24] you'll really see what what you're
[1:27:25] longing for because that's what they are
[1:27:27] longing for in that day i would love to
[1:27:29] see a real healing meeting but we have
[1:27:31] just more than just a healing meeting
[1:27:32] i'd love to see the holy ghost pour
[1:27:34] himself out i'd love to see people
[1:27:36] renewed in the holy ghost to see the
[1:27:38] word put on flesh in a greater measure
[1:27:39] to see the bride come to her full
[1:27:41] position to see the cycle because
[1:27:43] sometimes we're just caught in cycles
[1:27:44] the devil fights us
[1:27:46] and we beat him but then we come around
[1:27:47] the mountain again i'd love to see
[1:27:49] cycles broken i'd love to see the cycle
[1:27:52] of depression broken in people's lives
[1:27:54] people withdraw themselves feel sorry
[1:27:56] for themselves and pull away it's a
[1:27:57] spirit that's haunting them i'd love to
[1:27:59] see that broken i'd love to see the
[1:28:01] spirit of indifference broken and where
[1:28:03] people don't just go around the mountain
[1:28:05] and slay that same devil but they go
[1:28:07] around the mountain slay the devil and
[1:28:09] turn northward and go on
[1:28:11] that's what i would love to see
[1:28:13] amen where where
[1:28:14] overcoming power puts on its full
[1:28:17] manifestation
[1:28:18] amen that's what i want to see we're
[1:28:20] actually we walk so humbly with god
[1:28:23] that every devil is under our feet that
[1:28:26] we walk we gather together and the
[1:28:27] spirit is so strong
[1:28:29] that sin is just called out amen
[1:28:32] hallelujah that's what i'd love to see
[1:28:34] amen we're we're we're actually we have
[1:28:36] to go back and watch the service again
[1:28:38] because god just took over we didn't
[1:28:39] know what happened
[1:28:41] that's what i'd like to see
[1:28:43] amen where you know where we realize who
[1:28:46] we are
[1:28:48] because remember we don't just talk
[1:28:50] about the blood
[1:28:52] as an as an idea
[1:28:53] no no we have experienced the power of
[1:28:55] his grace in his blood
[1:28:57] hallelujah but you see now we've got to
[1:28:59] see him in everyday life
[1:29:02] monday god's going to be in monday he's
[1:29:04] going to be in tuesday he's going to be
[1:29:06] in that sore back problem he's going to
[1:29:08] be in that thing with a where the car
[1:29:09] doesn't start he's in that he's in there
[1:29:12] i mean when there's when there's a
[1:29:13] trouble and attention in the house he's
[1:29:14] in that tension he's not causing us the
[1:29:16] devil but he wants you to call call him
[1:29:19] on the scene i mean don't go by the
[1:29:21] carnal way of fighting it but let god
[1:29:22] come down and take over
[1:29:24] amen that's what he wants to do he wants
[1:29:26] he's going to be in tuesday
[1:29:29] if you lose your job he's in the losing
[1:29:31] of the job
[1:29:32] i mean if you're having financial
[1:29:33] trouble he's in there but you've got to
[1:29:35] see him in those things
[1:29:37] you got to be looking for him and every
[1:29:38] day remember
[1:29:39] god there's nothing with there's not
[1:29:41] monotony in god
[1:29:43] it's it's us because of our concept of
[1:29:45] time that we think this is just another
[1:29:47] week and another term and another year
[1:29:49] oh it's autumn again it'll be another
[1:29:50] autumn this could be the last autumn
[1:29:52] we're here
[1:29:53] we may not even get to winter and i say
[1:29:54] praise god because i'm a summer kind of
[1:29:56] person i like the sunshine
[1:29:58] amen so so everything that we
[1:30:02] everything we do we've got to realize
[1:30:03] actually no this is not a wasted moment
[1:30:06] even if you're relaxing that's not a
[1:30:08] wasted moment
[1:30:09] bring god into your relaxing
[1:30:11] bring him put your feet up on the chair
[1:30:13] god come sit down put your feet up on
[1:30:15] the chair too let's have a time
[1:30:17] hallelujah
[1:30:19] but if we get so tense and stressed
[1:30:21] about things now i've got to fix
[1:30:22] everything and how i'm going to
[1:30:23] manipulate this and work this situation
[1:30:25] here and how am i going to talk to this
[1:30:27] person i want them to say a certain
[1:30:28] thing this way to agree with me here no
[1:30:30] it's never going to work
[1:30:32] we're not called to be manipulators
[1:30:36] that's a whole sermon in itself we'll
[1:30:38] leave that maybe for next time
[1:30:41] hallelujah now
[1:30:44] i'm just going to read a few more quotes
[1:30:48] and then we're gonna
[1:30:50] now
[1:30:51] love and faith work hand in hand
[1:30:56] brother braham says in the message
[1:30:57] perfect faith
[1:30:59] he says now
[1:31:00] won't you love
[1:31:02] won't your love reach back to him and
[1:31:04] there's a love affair talk about you and
[1:31:06] god no matter what the situation is
[1:31:09] its circumstances is governed by this
[1:31:11] love that creates faith that god loves
[1:31:14] you and you love god
[1:31:16] so the circumstances is governed by this
[1:31:19] love that creates faith
[1:31:21] so it should never be
[1:31:23] a situation or circumstance that happens
[1:31:26] that the devil is allowed to come in and
[1:31:28] do something in your life that actually
[1:31:29] governs you that's right it should be
[1:31:31] your love and your faith should govern
[1:31:32] the circumstances it may not change the
[1:31:35] circumstances in terms of whatever has
[1:31:37] happened but it will change you in the
[1:31:39] circumstances you see peter when he was
[1:31:41] you know jesus is walking on the water
[1:31:44] and it's not a mill pond like some place
[1:31:46] you know the waves were going
[1:31:48] jesus is there i don't know what the
[1:31:49] swell is but you know the sea of galilee
[1:31:51] can get quite quite choppy
[1:31:53] and you know so here's jesus walking on
[1:31:54] the water they get all scared they think
[1:31:56] it's a spirit but then he calls him no
[1:31:57] it's me and peter says can i come out
[1:31:59] there too amen so he had faith and love
[1:32:02] and the one calling him to come out
[1:32:04] because because the lord said come so
[1:32:06] now
[1:32:07] the sea hasn't changed he's still on the
[1:32:09] boat he's still on the sea of galilee
[1:32:12] the circumstances have not changed one
[1:32:14] iota but he steps out upon the water so
[1:32:16] now he's in the same storm
[1:32:19] but he's keeping his eyes on the lord
[1:32:20] jesus
[1:32:22] right so his love and his faith because
[1:32:24] before maybe he's travelled by the boat
[1:32:25] how it's going to handle in the water
[1:32:26] but then he sees jesus walk out on the
[1:32:28] circumstance he says can i come too so
[1:32:30] he begins to walk and as long as he
[1:32:31] keeps his eyes
[1:32:33] on the lord he can walk
[1:32:36] but you see as soon as he stepped out
[1:32:38] the water didn't become calm the wind
[1:32:40] didn't stop blowing nothing changed and
[1:32:43] can be the like the storms of life can
[1:32:45] come in
[1:32:46] but he wants you to walk on the storms
[1:32:48] of life
[1:32:49] he's called you actually not to drown in
[1:32:51] them
[1:32:52] not to be trouble but just keep your
[1:32:54] eyes on the master and you can actually
[1:32:56] walk on the storm
[1:32:58] because you know we we want the storm to
[1:33:01] go away
[1:33:02] well i'll be honest i like st i don't
[1:33:04] like storms
[1:33:05] you know i like calm
[1:33:08] you guys like tornado chasers or what
[1:33:10] you know some of you like storms
[1:33:13] you know
[1:33:14] but the thing is if god only did that
[1:33:17] where's the character being formed
[1:33:19] where's the character being formed in
[1:33:21] that you see so because god is looking
[1:33:23] for character
[1:33:24] he's looking for his character and a
[1:33:26] people that's what he's looking for
[1:33:28] that's what he's interested in
[1:33:29] so he knows because all things work
[1:33:31] together for our good that those that
[1:33:32] love god and called according to his
[1:33:34] purpose what's that good that his
[1:33:36] character is molded in us we may not see
[1:33:38] it in the particular circumstance but he
[1:33:41] it's working for our good because it's
[1:33:42] moulding himself into us
[1:33:44] right so now
[1:33:46] many times we want the storms to be
[1:33:47] calmed but god wants character form
[1:33:49] dinner so he'll allow us to keep walking
[1:33:50] in the storm
[1:33:52] but then overcoming power that character
[1:33:54] starts to come out of us now if peter
[1:33:56] kept looking at the lord he would never
[1:33:58] start to sink but what i love about that
[1:34:00] story is as even though his eyes got off
[1:34:02] the lord and god on the storm he began
[1:34:03] to drown he began to sink you know peter
[1:34:06] says lord save me i'm i'm sinking and
[1:34:09] says immediately jesus put forth his
[1:34:10] hand and pulled him up
[1:34:12] hallelujah so we can actually get begin
[1:34:14] to sink in a storm but if we call out to
[1:34:16] the lord lord help me i can't cope with
[1:34:18] the storm it's too windy it's too
[1:34:20] stressful it's too troubling i cannot
[1:34:22] you know my heart is overwhelmed i
[1:34:24] cannot i cannot go through this anymore
[1:34:26] he'll grab you by the hand and pull you
[1:34:27] up that's it hallelujah
[1:34:30] amen so so peter wasn't the only one to
[1:34:33] walk on water once he walked on water
[1:34:34] twice because he walked on water with
[1:34:36] the law back to the boat
[1:34:38] hallelujah
[1:34:40] hey amen
[1:34:43] amen
[1:34:44] so
[1:34:45] circumstances governed by this love that
[1:34:47] creates faith that god loves you and you
[1:34:48] love god and you love one another and
[1:34:51] that brings the faith
[1:34:53] many people ask the question how do they
[1:34:55] know god loves loves me
[1:34:57] it's because he called you before the
[1:34:59] foundation of the world his love is an
[1:35:01] elective love brother brahm says the
[1:35:03] church age book many people think that
[1:35:05] god's love is like parental care love so
[1:35:07] that is parents want to keep their
[1:35:09] children from every scrape and bump that
[1:35:11] they could possibly get they want to
[1:35:12] keep them safe but god's love is not
[1:35:14] like that it's greater than that
[1:35:16] it's an elective love
[1:35:18] because he chose you before the
[1:35:20] foundation of the world he loves you how
[1:35:22] do you know you've been called before
[1:35:23] the foundational world because when the
[1:35:24] message came your way it transformed
[1:35:26] your life where the lord jesus christ
[1:35:29] was not a god of history no more he
[1:35:30] became a god of reality and he
[1:35:32] transformed your life even contrary to
[1:35:35] your own nature he changed you
[1:35:37] hallelujah that's how you know you're
[1:35:39] predestinated
[1:35:41] amen and that's how you know that he
[1:35:43] loves you
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:45] his love don't change
[1:35:47] his love is constant his love his love
[1:35:50] does not fluctuate it doesn't fluctuate
[1:35:52] by circumstances he doesn't look at you
[1:35:54] one day and say i love you you're great
[1:35:56] and the next day
[1:35:57] i'm not sure
[1:35:59] you know he doesn't his love doesn't go
[1:36:01] up and down like the tide his love is
[1:36:03] constant he cannot change if he's loved
[1:36:05] you he loves you if he's declared his
[1:36:08] love for you he loves you he does not
[1:36:09] change that love it stays
[1:36:11] so it's not based on performance not
[1:36:13] based on how we're doing or how we think
[1:36:14] we are his love stays the same
[1:36:17] hallelujah and his love is very great
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:22] praise the lord now now watch pure faith
[1:36:24] uh perfect faith is pure just as pure as
[1:36:26] love as see
[1:36:28] now when you love somebody you love your
[1:36:30] husband or you or or you love your wife
[1:36:33] there's no need of anybody telling you
[1:36:35] you don't because you do it and you know
[1:36:37] you do now i'd ask you how um how can
[1:36:41] you how can you prove you do it oh i
[1:36:42] prove it by the way i look to him
[1:36:45] see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal
[1:36:47] honest husband and that proves to me
[1:36:49] that i love my wife i love my husband
[1:36:51] see your life proves what you are amen
[1:36:54] the same thing christianity does see
[1:36:56] your faith you have confidence in one
[1:36:58] another it's pure it's something real
[1:37:00] that you can't show it to somebody else
[1:37:03] yet you've got it and your actions prove
[1:37:05] it and when you get pure unadulterated
[1:37:08] faith like your love is to your
[1:37:10] companion then you prove it by the way
[1:37:12] you act you ain't complaining no more
[1:37:15] you know it's done just walking along no
[1:37:17] matter what the thing look like what
[1:37:20] anybody else says
[1:37:22] you know it's happened you know that
[1:37:24] it's finished just as well as you know
[1:37:26] you love your husband as well as well as
[1:37:29] you know you love see love and faith go
[1:37:31] together their kin folks they love love
[1:37:34] produces
[1:37:35] faith
[1:37:37] that's why we should never ever let our
[1:37:38] love diminish
[1:37:40] it should increase for the lord
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:46] now i say two more quotes so i'm going
[1:37:47] to read one more because i've read one
[1:37:50] and then we're going to close i'm going
[1:37:51] to read this one
[1:37:57] i might read about more than it and
[1:37:59] and though you say well i wish i know
[1:38:02] the bible though i understand all the
[1:38:04] mysteries of god and still though i
[1:38:07] could do it and have not charity i'm
[1:38:09] nothing see you haven't got nowhere yet
[1:38:11] see the main thing is love god and
[1:38:12] humble yourself with it now surely after
[1:38:15] all these years on the field and around
[1:38:16] the world and seeing different people i
[1:38:18] ought to know a little bit about the
[1:38:20] gate to enter in it and if you want to
[1:38:22] get somewhere with god never let an
[1:38:25] arrogant spirit ever come around you
[1:38:27] don't let no malice come in now remember
[1:38:29] this in everyday life
[1:38:31] everyday life because because
[1:38:33] arrogant means to have
[1:38:35] having or revealing an exaggerated sense
[1:38:38] of one's own importance or abilities
[1:38:40] so if you put someone if you put a
[1:38:42] sinner down here and you put yourself up
[1:38:45] here you're being arrogant
[1:38:47] are they just cannon fighter they're
[1:38:49] just atomic fodder
[1:38:51] don't put someone in that category
[1:38:53] that's right i'll say this god will put
[1:38:54] someone in that category it's god that
[1:38:56] puts people where he puts people right
[1:38:59] but don't have that attitude oh they're
[1:39:00] just ashes they're nothing it's gonna
[1:39:01] you know they're going to the
[1:39:02] tribulation how do you know
[1:39:06] god loved you when you were actually
[1:39:07] unlovable
[1:39:09] right so how about the unlovable in your
[1:39:11] life can you love them and and have a
[1:39:13] burden for them and pray say lord may my
[1:39:16] life influence them in such a way that
[1:39:18] they want to turn towards you and serve
[1:39:20] you may they want what i profess to have
[1:39:24] because remember we are god's billboard
[1:39:26] we are god's advertising many people
[1:39:28] these days will never read this but
[1:39:30] they'll read your life
[1:39:31] you know people say oh i follow the
[1:39:33] message well then they'll say well what
[1:39:34] does your what does this message produce
[1:39:37] right and you that's what they're
[1:39:39] looking at they're they're not
[1:39:40] necessarily interested in doctrines and
[1:39:41] things no they want to see a life lived
[1:39:44] they want to see a gospel that's
[1:39:45] manifested
[1:39:47] amen
[1:39:48] so lord jesus help us because i'm
[1:39:50] putting myself very much in this
[1:39:51] practice and never let an arrogant
[1:39:52] spirit ever get around you don't let no
[1:39:54] malice come in no matter what anyone has
[1:39:56] done if they are wrong don't ever build
[1:39:58] a complex against that person
[1:40:00] see you must be kind and sweet remember
[1:40:03] god loves you when you're in sin and if
[1:40:04] the spirit of god is in you you love the
[1:40:06] other person when he's wrong see just
[1:40:09] pray for them and love one another
[1:40:11] amen and above everything love god and
[1:40:14] love one another and be humble with god
[1:40:16] and around one another and god will
[1:40:18] bless us it's a hard thing telling what
[1:40:20] he will do amen amen amen because
[1:40:23] there's no limit on god
[1:40:26] usually when a church begins to get in
[1:40:27] numbers and gets to getting a little
[1:40:29] bigger or something like that then they
[1:40:31] get away from the real thing
[1:40:33] the real thing we're 10 years old in
[1:40:36] june oh we've been here a while no we
[1:40:38] can't get away from the real thing
[1:40:41] amen
[1:40:43] do you know what brought these things to
[1:40:45] pass so i'm just going to read this and
[1:40:47] then and then i'm going to quit
[1:40:48] when i first started the lord appeared
[1:40:50] to me down the river and told me that as
[1:40:52] brother vale saw that i believe in the
[1:40:54] paper in canada many years ago with
[1:40:56] angel lord appeared on the river down
[1:40:58] there it was on associated press mystic
[1:41:00] light over local minister while
[1:41:02] baptizing you know what did that when we
[1:41:04] had a tent meeting just across the
[1:41:05] street a tent that seated about 2500
[1:41:08] people ministers come from everywhere
[1:41:09] said brother come here a minute i was
[1:41:11] just a boy oh just a kid he said how do
[1:41:14] you keep those people in one accord they
[1:41:16] love one another till till they um he
[1:41:19] says i haven't seen people love one
[1:41:20] another that's the lord that's what this
[1:41:22] church was established upon that godly
[1:41:24] brotherly love for one another i've seen
[1:41:27] them even shake hands with one another
[1:41:28] leaving the place and cry like babies to
[1:41:30] leave one another they loved one another
[1:41:32] that well and i could get to their house
[1:41:35] and visit them in times the bible was
[1:41:36] laying open and stained with tears
[1:41:38] coming at night time where fathers and
[1:41:40] mothers were gathered together and their
[1:41:41] little children around on the floor
[1:41:43] kneeling around and fathers and mothers
[1:41:45] on their knees crying and praying i
[1:41:47] stand at the door and wait and wait and
[1:41:48] wait and they didn't stop praying i just
[1:41:50] sit down on the steps and start praying
[1:41:52] myself waiting for them see that's what
[1:41:54] and they love one another they love one
[1:41:56] another we used to stand and sing that
[1:41:58] old song blessed be the tie that binds
[1:42:00] our hearts and christian love their
[1:42:02] fellowship of kindred minds is like to
[1:42:04] that above when we ascend apart it gives
[1:42:06] us inward pain but we shall still be
[1:42:08] joined in heart and hope to meet again i
[1:42:11] say this with great joy in my heart to
[1:42:12] christ many of them are sleeping around
[1:42:14] in the in these graves marked tonight
[1:42:17] waiting for that great resurrection
[1:42:18] where we'll meet together again let not
[1:42:21] that spirit ever depart from this place
[1:42:23] if it ever does then i don't care how
[1:42:25] eloquent your pastor might be how well
[1:42:27] he might bring the word of god the
[1:42:29] spirit of god i mean the word of god the
[1:42:31] spirit of god is grieved away see
[1:42:33] when
[1:42:34] when we can have all things in
[1:42:36] fellowship in common and love one
[1:42:37] another then god will work with us
[1:42:40] who wants that kind of church
[1:42:42] who wants that kind of life
[1:42:45] hallelujah
[1:42:47] amen but you see it's in everyday life
[1:42:49] these things begin to happen
[1:42:53] may we ever
[1:42:55] may we ever see
[1:42:56] god's hand in our lives every day
[1:42:59] may we never think well this is just
[1:43:00] another day another dollar another going
[1:43:03] through the motions it's not
[1:43:06] remember the problem is the devil wants
[1:43:08] us just to think it's just monotony and
[1:43:10] god's not doing anything because then we
[1:43:11] lose focus on the one we're living for
[1:43:14] right and if we lose focus on the one
[1:43:16] we're living for then we can't live for
[1:43:17] one another we can't be a blessing to
[1:43:19] one another
[1:43:21] so may we be like joseph amen and
[1:43:24] actually see
[1:43:25] every day has a purpose we're not here
[1:43:28] occupying time we're not here just
[1:43:30] sitting around doing nothing even if
[1:43:32] you're being a real mum god bless you
[1:43:35] brother am said that's actually an
[1:43:36] adopted position in the body is his
[1:43:39] mother
[1:43:40] right so that's actually someone fully
[1:43:41] adopted in the body of christ as being a
[1:43:43] mom
[1:43:44] many times you think i was going to be a
[1:43:46] songwriter a preacher whatever no no no
[1:43:48] mom
[1:43:49] that's powerful
[1:43:51] a mother in her position that's
[1:43:52] incredibly powerful
[1:43:54] hallelujah so you know you're changing
[1:43:56] another diaper wiping a nose feeding
[1:43:58] whatever getting up and helping your
[1:43:59] children at night or whatever

[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:55:14] hello brother ben just wants to say
[1:55:16] something
[1:55:21] we are going to try
[1:55:22] after
[1:55:23] consuming
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:49] is
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:56:01] yes
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:19] you want to see no i'm not going to sing
[1:56:21] sorry
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:30] it's very short and sweet
[1:56:32] um
[1:56:33] so halfway through the service
[1:56:36] i
[1:56:36] when i woke up this morning there was a
[1:56:38] scripture that that i was given
[1:56:41] and
[1:56:42] um
[1:56:43] and i thought oh okay because
[1:56:45] i've been dealing with my own personal
[1:56:47] strife and stuff and how to deal with
[1:56:49] all of that i thought okay well maybe
[1:56:50] it's the lord just telling me to calm
[1:56:52] down
[1:56:53] and um
[1:56:54] and then halfway through the service off
[1:56:57] i thought the lord said you need to read
[1:56:58] that scripture and i thought oh that's
[1:57:00] but do you want me to testify law do you
[1:57:02] want me to speak about this
[1:57:04] or you know some things that have been
[1:57:05] happening
[1:57:06] and
[1:57:07] it didn't you know didn't get an answer
[1:57:09] so i just left it and then i came again
[1:57:12] you need to just read that scripture
[1:57:13] that's it
[1:57:14] and i thought but it doesn't make sense
[1:57:16] i'll feel so silly
[1:57:18] and um
[1:57:20] then brother ben
[1:57:22] read his last two quotes and then it
[1:57:23] made sense
[1:57:25] so
[1:57:28] sorry i feel so nervous
[1:57:30] um
[1:57:32] so it's just very very simple but i felt
[1:57:34] like i was it's a if the lord was giving
[1:57:37] it to me it must be for other people too
[1:57:40] so it's philippians 2 verse 3
[1:57:44] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:57:47] vain glory but in lowliness of mind let
[1:57:50] it let each esteem other better than
[1:57:52] themselves
[1:57:57] [Applause]
[1:58:17] please line up
[1:58:18] there think it's uh
[1:58:21] brother ben if you ever seen the timely
[1:58:23] message
[1:58:25] it was today
[1:58:28] okay so
[1:58:30] this morning we started our class off
[1:58:32] and we rent out of matthew
[1:58:35] 22 verse 30
[1:58:38] they even remember today
[1:58:40] and it says there it says jesus said
[1:58:43] unto them thou shalt love thy lord thy
[1:58:45] god with all thy heart and with all thy
[1:58:46] soul and with all thy mind this is the
[1:58:48] first commandment and the second is like
[1:58:51] unto it thou shalt love thy neighbors
[1:58:53] their selves
[1:58:55] and these two commandments hang all the
[1:58:57] law and the prophets
[1:58:59] and what our sunday school lesson was
[1:59:01] about and i'm going to tease someone mr
[1:59:03] kira
[1:59:06] law and love
[1:59:08] law and love
[1:59:10] so i just want to say something god is
[1:59:12] telling us something
[1:59:13] that the law that we're under the law
[1:59:16] how we share it must be in love
[1:59:19] you know because remember when jesus
[1:59:21] came he magnified that law
[1:59:23] he says even if you're angry with the
[1:59:25] brother you committed murder
[1:59:27] don't do that
[1:59:28] and what we said this morning
[1:59:30] said we're here to love one another live
[1:59:33] for one another we are each other
[1:59:35] servant
[1:59:37] and if you see someone and you see the
[1:59:39] little one struggling we're here to help
[1:59:41] amen and i believe with all of my heart
[1:59:44] god is trying to tell us stay humble
[1:59:47] stay in position and keep loving one
[1:59:49] another
[1:59:51] still live under god's law he still has
[1:59:54] commandments we should keep it's fine
[1:59:56] yeah but don't kill with the letter amen
[2:00:00] you know
[2:00:01] like like ben and i i thank you for it
[2:00:04] jesus is walking in front of us and
[2:00:06] saying are you following along he ain't
[2:00:08] pushing us
[2:00:10] he's a gentleman yeah so guys sunday
[2:00:13] school lesson
[2:00:14] just what brother being said about hey
