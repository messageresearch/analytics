[6:22] it's always humbling when you come up
[6:23] here and you see people you love so much
[6:26] and you look over all the faces and you
[6:28] go i love that one
[6:30] i love that one
[6:31] i love that one
[6:33] all the memories
[6:34] that we build as time goes on
[6:37] we're just one family you know and it's
[6:40] why we come here is to worship him but
[6:42] it's also good to see familiar faces
[6:45] people that's in the same boat going the
[6:48] same direction
[6:50] you know
[6:51] some might be peddling and other might
[6:53] be just sleeping for that time and
[6:55] resting
[6:56] and others might be cooking for all of
[6:58] the guys that's peddling but we're on
[6:59] the same boat
[7:01] are we all going my way
[7:03] amen and i don't think anyone that's
[7:05] here tonight
[7:06] hearts desires not to meet the lord

[29:48] it's
[29:50] mark
[29:51] verse 4
[29:53] chapter 4 verse 37 to 41.
[30:09] this is jesus when he's
[30:11] out on the water in a boat and there
[30:13] arose a great storm of wind and the
[30:15] waves beat into the ship
[30:17] so that it was now full
[30:19] and he was in the hindu part of the ship
[30:21] asleep on a pillow and they awake him
[30:23] and said unto him master charist thou
[30:25] not that we perish
[30:27] and he arose and rebuked to the wind and
[30:29] said unto the sea peace be still
[30:31] and the wind ceased and there was a
[30:33] great calm
[30:34] and he said unto them why are you so
[30:36] fearful how is it that you have no faith
[30:38] and they
[30:39] feared exceedingly and said one to
[30:41] another
[30:42] what manner of man is this
[30:45] that even the wind and the sea obey him
[30:48] what manner of man is this
[30:52] and that's
[30:53] my topic this evening is what manner of
[30:55] man is this
[30:58] but it's also adoption
[31:01] so
[31:02] may bless your word lord and we just
[31:04] give you full control of the service now
[31:05] in jesus name amen you can take your
[31:07] seats um this evening it's good to be
[31:09] here it's good to be
[31:10] amongst um friends
[31:13] i find it very easy to talk with friends
[31:15] you know when you've got a good friend
[31:16] you can just go in there and you can sit
[31:18] down and talk and
[31:20] even if you don't talk it's just
[31:21] relaxing you know it's not there's no
[31:22] pressure and
[31:24] i feel that way this evening amongst
[31:26] this fellowship and i always do you know
[31:28] i feel there's no pressure we can just
[31:30] relax and
[31:31] um
[31:34] and i believe the lord's going to move
[31:35] in our midst tonight
[31:37] and i've got um
[31:39] i have intentions
[31:42] i have intentions declare that to
[31:44] declare that the lord is here
[31:47] and i have an intention to declare to
[31:49] all of you
[31:51] what the lord is going to do for all of
[31:53] you
[31:56] and i have an intention to let satan
[31:58] know that
[31:58] the greatest force that he's ever seen
[32:02] in his existence is coming upon him
[32:07] the greatest force he's ever seen
[32:10] and the existence of his time is coming
[32:12] upon him
[32:15] his kingdom is going to shake like he's
[32:17] never seen it shake before and he's not
[32:19] going to know what to do with it
[32:23] that's the program that we are in
[32:26] that's our program and that's his
[32:27] program
[32:28] and this is not made up to make you say
[32:30] amen but you're saying amen from your
[32:32] hearts because you believe it because
[32:34] you know this is what's happening
[32:37] this is the time that we live in and
[32:38] this is the season that we live in
[32:41] this is god's season for all of us and
[32:44] it's such an exciting time to be in and
[32:45] i want to declare to you all tonight
[32:47] you're on the winning team
[32:50] you're on the winning team and
[32:55] god is going to work through you like he
[32:56] never has through any other people on
[32:58] the face of this earth
[33:02] that's the truth
[33:04] when jesus went to the fit the wedding
[33:07] feast the wedding and they drank the
[33:09] wine
[33:11] and then at the end he turned water into
[33:12] why when they ran out of wine and the
[33:13] man said
[33:15] you've saved the best wine till the end
[33:18] usually you put it on at the start
[33:20] that's what this is the best wine has
[33:22] been saved for up for the end
[33:25] and
[33:28] satan's kingdom is going to shake like
[33:29] he's never known it
[33:32] and he's going to meet the most powerful
[33:33] people that he's ever met
[33:35] and he's going to meet a number of them
[33:39] and you are all them
[33:43] the world knows there's something
[33:44] happening
[33:46] the world knows there's something going
[33:48] on
[33:49] at the moment it's panicking
[33:52] you know when someone gets a bit scared
[33:55] maybe it's night time and they get a bit
[33:57] scared
[33:59] and they're on edge
[34:01] and they can't see anything
[34:03] and they hear something in the distance
[34:05] what do they do because they're on edge
[34:07] they panic
[34:08] what is that is someone there because
[34:10] they're already sensing something's
[34:12] happening
[34:13] something's happening something's going
[34:15] on they start to panic
[34:18] this covert thing is nothing
[34:20] but people are panicking
[34:22] because they know
[34:23] something is going on
[34:26] this world is a supernatural world it's
[34:28] not a natural world it's supernatural
[34:31] everybody knows there's something going
[34:32] on when they sit down it's just
[34:34] themselves in their thoughts they know
[34:36] there's something going on
[34:37] they know it's coming to a place where
[34:39] it's the end of all things
[34:42] people know
[34:45] and we
[34:47] know what is going on amen
[34:50] we are not walking in this confused
[34:53] and god has got a plan
[34:55] for you and for me
[34:57] a victorious plan
[35:00] none of you are here by chance you're
[35:01] not here because you just happen to
[35:03] stumble in
[35:05] you're part of the greatest force that's
[35:07] ever struck this world
[35:09] nobody
[35:11] no
[35:12] group of believers ever is going to have
[35:14] the power has got the power that you've
[35:16] all got ever
[35:18] in existence nobody
[35:20] it was promised now it wasn't
[35:23] although i was promised
[35:25] as a general promise
[35:27] when this
[35:28] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[35:30] of god will raise up a standard against
[35:32] it
[35:33] now that's not just making us feel good
[35:36] that's the way that this thing works
[35:38] that's the reality of what this is
[35:40] when the enemy comes in
[35:41] at its most powerful point god will
[35:44] raise up a standard more powerful than
[35:46] that
[35:47] more powerful
[35:49] that's what that scripture says when is
[35:51] the time where the most powerful forces
[35:53] come upon the church upon the believers
[35:55] when is the time
[35:57] now
[35:58] when all the demons were released when
[36:00] they're all around you you see
[36:02] satan all around you
[36:03] we're dwelling in satan's eden like we
[36:05] never have before all around us
[36:08] all around us people know it's like that
[36:10] too
[36:11] everybody knows us like that
[36:13] all around us but fear not amen
[36:17] you don't have to be scared there has
[36:19] been a standard raise up
[36:22] to combat and to easily
[36:24] defeat that enemy that's all around you
[36:28] easily
[36:29] do you remember
[36:31] who used to play computer games when
[36:32] they were small
[36:34] because they don't play them anymore
[36:36] we used to get cheat codes now and then
[36:40] and you just you can't beat this certain
[36:44] whatever it is
[36:45] and then
[36:46] your friend tells you i got a cheat code
[36:48] for that you just type on this and then
[36:49] you become invincible
[36:51] and you can just go in there and nothing
[36:53] they can do will harm you you can just
[36:55] go in there and you just beat them and
[36:58] it's like
[36:59] so easy it becomes boring
[37:02] you're like let's took all the fun out
[37:03] of it didn't i just walk in there and
[37:05] beat this person
[37:06] or this whatever this thing is you know
[37:08] that
[37:11] that's what we have
[37:12] we have a force so powerful
[37:15] that it becomes boring that we just win
[37:17] easily
[37:18] don't fear about all satan's
[37:22] what he's trying to do don't fear
[37:24] don't fear you don't have to fear at all
[37:26] there's a standard being raised up
[37:30] now more powerful than anything satan
[37:32] can throw
[37:35] he's got a real
[37:37] powerful force heading his way and it's
[37:40] you and it's me
[37:44] and we are coming into becoming adopted
[37:47] sons and daughters of god
[37:49] adopted
[37:53] okay
[37:54] now
[37:56] adoption
[37:58] when we talk about adoption
[38:02] i'm going to say i'm going to talk about
[38:03] this because
[38:05] you will know what i'm talking about but
[38:06] i just want to bring it through so we
[38:08] can talk about this
[38:09] because our
[38:11] understanding of adoption
[38:14] is you know you're not part of my family
[38:15] and i go to somewhere and i see a small
[38:17] child and i think i really like you and
[38:20] i will adopt you into my family then
[38:22] that child is not related to me
[38:24] whatsoever but i will adopt it in and
[38:25] then it will become
[38:27] my son or my daughter that's how we
[38:29] would think of adoption
[38:31] but
[38:33] there's a
[38:34] term called adoption that is not that
[38:36] type of adoption
[38:39] for us
[38:40] it's not that
[38:42] the true term of adoption
[38:45] that when brother branham was here he
[38:47] was preaching for everyone to come into
[38:49] that
[38:50] he was saying church you've lost your
[38:52] way you should be coming into adoption
[38:56] you should be coming into this place
[38:57] you've lost your way somewhere
[38:59] he was saying that now we realize it's
[39:01] for the bride
[39:03] this adoption is for the bride
[39:06] it wasn't for the whole church it was
[39:07] actually for the bride and i think he
[39:09] understood that as he went on
[39:11] it's for the bride now
[39:14] adoption
[39:17] can i stop here for a minute
[39:19] okay i'm going to start right way way
[39:20] back at the start all right
[39:22] and then i'm going to end up back there
[39:23] okay then i'm going to tell you
[39:25] something
[39:26] that i haven't told anyone before
[39:31] so we serve god you know
[39:33] but i want to take you through a bit of
[39:35] our christian walk that we go through
[39:36] we're all at different stages but we
[39:38] have a christian walk that we go through
[39:40] and
[39:41] the road is the same for every person
[39:43] they that's why pilgrim's progress
[39:45] struck such a chord because anyone could
[39:47] read that and realize well that's the
[39:48] same journey i took because it is a
[39:50] pilgrim's progress there is a road that
[39:52] we all take the lord leads us a certain
[39:53] way he has to do it he does it always
[39:55] the same way although the different
[39:57] people different circumstances generally
[39:58] it's it's there is the same path we all
[40:00] take
[40:02] it's it's like a tree a tree has to grow
[40:04] slowly god's got a way that it would
[40:05] grow that it would become strong and it
[40:07] he doesn't just have a tree shoot up
[40:08] overnight because he knows
[40:10] it's not going to be strong it's got to
[40:11] be slowly grow it's let its roots go
[40:13] down the wind blows it when it's small
[40:14] it gets a bit stronger when the wind
[40:16] shakes it gets stronger it grows so when
[40:18] it's big it can withstand powerful winds
[40:21] he doesn't just have it grow in this
[40:22] weak thing that falls over so god's got
[40:23] a system of doing things
[40:26] so we're all on our road
[40:28] as a christian
[40:32] and at one point in time we get a
[40:35] inkling maybe there's something else out
[40:36] there there's more to earth to life than
[40:38] what i'm doing at the moment you know if
[40:40] we didn't know god or if we didn't know
[40:42] god we maybe we're running away and we
[40:44] don't know whether we're going to serve
[40:46] him but at some point we decide to serve
[40:47] him we say
[40:49] some force i'm going to call it god the
[40:50] goodness of god causes us to want to
[40:52] serve and we say
[40:53] okay
[40:54] yes i will now that's the goodness of
[40:56] god that led us to repentance we say
[40:58] lord the path that i've been going down
[41:01] whether it be bad or really bad or not
[41:04] that bad at all because let's face it
[41:05] some of us were really bad some were not
[41:07] really that bad at all
[41:08] that's the truth right in terms of what
[41:10] we thought you know
[41:11] some of us didn't come to god with a big
[41:13] broken life
[41:14] we just said lord i just i just have a
[41:16] desire to serve you now we all had a
[41:18] broken life to some degree but you
[41:19] understand what i mean
[41:21] somewhere from here somewhere from there
[41:22] but we all come to that point
[41:24] and
[41:25] and a lot of people come to that point
[41:27] to want to commit their life over to the
[41:28] lord
[41:30] and then they start serving but what's
[41:32] the first thing that happens they get a
[41:32] bit of resistance
[41:34] and
[41:35] what happens to some of the people
[41:37] they fall away
[41:38] they get resistance they fall away
[41:40] and then
[41:42] but those of us that want to stay on we
[41:43] carry on and we say lord i'm going to
[41:44] carry on serving you you know the
[41:46] resistance comes the resistance says
[41:48] suddenly we can't be if we're young we
[41:49] can't be cool anymore because
[41:50] christianity is not
[41:52] not it's not generally accepted as
[41:55] we're not in the in crowd we're on the
[41:56] out crowd so young people have to
[41:58] suddenly grapple with this idea oh no
[42:00] i'm not going to be socially accepted
[42:01] anymore
[42:02] so what
[42:04] see in our mind we think so what as long
[42:06] as i'm accepted by god i don't care
[42:08] you know
[42:09] that's that's the way we we we get this
[42:12] pressure that our friends turn on us so
[42:13] what long as the law doesn't turn on me
[42:15] i don't care
[42:16] you know we we suddenly can't chase
[42:18] after money like maybe what we used to
[42:20] so what as long as the law's my provider
[42:22] i don't care
[42:23] we have different challenges
[42:25] we can't turn to things that we used to
[42:27] turn to for satisfaction we don't want
[42:28] that we just want the satisfaction from
[42:30] the lord see there's a price we all pay
[42:33] and the lord meets the lord asks
[42:35] everybody because he wants to see is
[42:37] this real what's in your heart are you
[42:38] going to pay the price that's why i went
[42:39] to the rich young ruler the rich ruler
[42:41] said i've done all these things from my
[42:42] youth you know i've kept all the
[42:44] comments i've done all this but he knew
[42:45] the thing in his heart was he wanted all
[42:46] his money
[42:48] so he had he hit the spot where he he
[42:50] thought this is where we will prove if
[42:52] you want to serve me or not by the thing
[42:53] that means the most to you and we all go
[42:55] come to that point all of us get quick
[42:57] get
[42:58] get pointed at that what is the thing
[43:00] that's the most important to you and
[43:01] will you be willing to give that up the
[43:02] same as abraham
[43:04] with a son what is the thing that's the
[43:05] most important to you will you be
[43:06] willing to give it up to serve me
[43:08] because that's what god wants
[43:10] is will you give up everything to serve
[43:12] me
[43:13] that's why when he came to the rich
[43:14] wrong ruler he said sell all your goods
[43:16] and give to the poor and come follow me
[43:19] you know
[43:20] and he went away sorrowful because he
[43:22] didn't want to pay that price
[43:24] see
[43:25] and we all get that choice and i believe
[43:27] you're all here because you paid that
[43:28] price the lord tested you on that one
[43:30] thing and you said
[43:31] yes
[43:33] now that's not the only thing you'll get
[43:34] tested on in your life
[43:36] but that's the most significant thing
[43:37] for you at that time enough to show that
[43:40] if if you're willing at that point in
[43:42] your life to surrender the most
[43:43] significant thing that shows that you
[43:45] will keep on doing it in other
[43:46] situations because
[43:48] from what you knew you were willing to
[43:50] surrender 100 from what you knew
[43:53] because we we walk on for two years and
[43:54] we think wow i thought i surrendered
[43:56] there now i've done all these other
[43:57] things
[43:58] but that didn't matter because at that
[44:00] point you surrendered all to what you
[44:02] knew right
[44:04] so you didn't get offended by what you
[44:06] had to sacrifice but what you had to
[44:08] what the cost was going to be you said
[44:10] no lord i'm going to carry on come on
[44:11] may like peter said lord we forsaken all
[44:13] to follow you
[44:14] he said come follow me i'll make you
[44:16] fishers of men he said okay threw his
[44:18] nets left his boat and left went
[44:21] that's what we do we need we say lord i
[44:23] want to serve you he says do you
[44:25] do you okay then do this
[44:29] and we say
[44:30] it may hurt us a bit but then there's
[44:32] always something more powerful than us
[44:33] that says i'll do it
[44:35] because we have a destiny to fulfill
[44:38] and that is to become adopted sons and
[44:40] daughters of god we have a destiny
[44:42] we have god has a plan and a purpose and
[44:44] he knows it in us lies that
[44:46] in us lies an adopted son or daughter of
[44:48] god that's what lies within us
[44:50] so then we serve god and then we start
[44:52] to have this thing called faith we think
[44:54] we understand why we can ask god for
[44:55] things because now we're feeling pretty
[44:56] good about ourselves and early in our
[44:58] christian walk we ask god for things and
[44:59] you know what happens we get them
[45:01] straight away
[45:02] we think wow
[45:05] i'm taking you on a journey right a
[45:07] christian journey
[45:08] we get it straight away and we hear
[45:10] young young people testify well i prayed
[45:12] for this one young
[45:14] man in australia he was at his work and
[45:16] he didn't like the radio always playing
[45:17] because they're blasting out this music
[45:19] in some factory he works and he said
[45:20] lord i just don't like that radio plane
[45:22] could you just make it turn off and then
[45:24] the radio stopped working and the guy
[45:26] that was always there trying to play it
[45:27] he was he's up there messing with this
[45:29] radio trying to get this thing going i
[45:30] think it didn't go for a couple of days
[45:32] you know until they maybe got another
[45:33] one but
[45:35] he had faith to believe if i can just
[45:37] ask god he was a new christian then i'll
[45:39] get it straight away
[45:42] right because now i don't want to put it
[45:44] like this but i have to put it like this
[45:45] when you're a baby a baby goes ah cries
[45:47] and they get what they want straight
[45:48] away or within a period of about five
[45:50] minutes because you they're just crying
[45:52] so much and they generally just want
[45:53] something simple watching some food
[45:56] or get changed or get put in bed you
[45:58] know they're quite simple things to look
[45:59] after they only want simple things
[46:01] and a new believer the lord treats him
[46:03] like that you don't you don't leave a
[46:05] new baby crying asking for something and
[46:06] crying and crying and crying you let him
[46:08] cry for a bit then you give it to him
[46:09] you know
[46:11] and that's the way it is for a new
[46:12] christian you get stuck straight away
[46:14] who's experienced that
[46:16] we started serving the lord and you'd
[46:17] ask the lord lord we need a place to
[46:18] live the next day you've got a place to
[46:20] live praise the lord and you're thinking
[46:21] man this is how it always works i just
[46:23] ask god for things and they just i just
[46:24] get them straight away but when you get
[46:26] it it increases your faith you think i
[46:28] believe this lord thank you
[46:30] i trust in you
[46:31] so then you're happy now the next stage
[46:34] comes on is
[46:35] one day you ask for something and you
[46:37] don't get it right and it's a bit
[46:39] confusing to you because you think well
[46:40] i've always just you know this is not
[46:43] really the way it's supposed to be i've
[46:44] always asked for things and i just get
[46:45] it straight away uh
[46:47] what's going on here you know and we
[46:49] start to
[46:50] question why didn't i get it did i do
[46:53] something wrong or god why aren't you
[46:54] hearing me you know we start to get like
[46:56] that but god doesn't want us like that
[46:59] he wants us if we ask we just wait
[47:02] he doesn't and he doesn't want to have
[47:03] to pamper to our every need
[47:06] or quickly i better get it to the more
[47:07] they'll cry
[47:08] that's called a spoiled child you know
[47:10] i'll get him what it wants so they'll
[47:11] cry you spoil people when you when
[47:13] they're like that you give them
[47:14] everything they want and they get so
[47:16] used to it so he has to get us out of
[47:17] that frame of mind and actually get us
[47:19] to a place where we actually have faith
[47:21] because
[47:22] if we just have faith when it happens
[47:24] then that's not real faith because it
[47:25] just happens
[47:26] we have to have faith when it's not
[47:27] happening and think it's all right it's
[47:29] going to be all right
[47:31] so now we go through the next phase of
[47:32] our walk now i need to interject here
[47:34] and say this is just our journey we all
[47:36] have our sanctification baptism
[47:39] um infilling of the holy ghost at
[47:41] different times i can't say you'll get
[47:42] yours here and you'll get yours you'll
[47:43] do that there it may be at the start
[47:45] that you get that in some experience
[47:47] like i believe shannon got hers and
[47:48] experience when she first met the lord
[47:50] just all and then happened then she got
[47:52] baptized then her walk
[47:53] her process began there other people
[47:55] that have maybe been brought up in
[47:56] church you know about the things of god
[47:58] that the things of god are not new to
[48:00] you so it's harder for you just to have
[48:02] this big light bulb experience well
[48:03] there's a god because you've been going
[48:04] to church for 15 years
[48:06] you're not going to suddenly think
[48:07] there's a god
[48:08] you're going to have to have some sort
[48:10] of other experience somehow and it may
[48:13] not be i want to say this that may not
[48:14] be a massive experience that you think
[48:17] well i it was here it may not be
[48:20] i don't know how god works he
[48:22] some people are not because they
[48:23] probably had that experience and that
[48:24] that's the way that god has chosen to
[48:26] work with you other people didn't know
[48:28] god and they meet god like brother andy
[48:30] there's a god wow i didn't know this you
[48:31] know it's different
[48:32] me i was brought up in church you
[48:34] couldn't surprise me with god when i was
[48:35] 15.
[48:36] i knew there was a god i just had to
[48:38] figure out god had to make his own way
[48:39] for me to surrender to him
[48:42] okay so when i'm talking about that
[48:43] process i'm not gonna this whole process
[48:45] i'm talking about your journey within
[48:47] how the process of
[48:49] being baptized and sanctified and
[48:50] receiving the holy ghost is all is going
[48:51] to be different for all of you it's it's
[48:53] not the same but the journey we go on
[48:54] through that is always the same because
[48:56] we have to become
[48:57] these these believers that are full of
[48:59] faith because that's our journey as
[49:00] faith
[49:02] so so we start asking for things and
[49:04] then we don't get them
[49:06] anyone had that
[49:08] and
[49:10] our life starts to go bad anyone had
[49:12] that
[49:13] and we don't know what's going on we
[49:15] don't know why
[49:16] do you throw it all out
[49:18] or do you say lord i don't know why but
[49:21] i believe you
[49:22] i don't know what's going on but i trust
[49:24] you
[49:25] right now if you haven't had that
[49:26] experience yet don't worry you'll get it
[49:31] you'll get it
[49:32] guaranteed
[49:33] everything will go wrong and you won't
[49:34] know why nothing will go right
[49:36] until you perceive it
[49:38] but have faith in god that's all part of
[49:40] your
[49:41] learning and your building and the
[49:42] molding of your faith because you must
[49:44] learn to trust in god above anything
[49:46] else
[49:47] and be at peace
[49:48] always be at peace that's what we must
[49:50] that's what god is trying to teach us to
[49:51] trust in him
[49:53] so we sometimes this phase is a long
[49:55] phase i've been up here song leading and
[49:58] maybe i even preached one day on a
[50:00] sunday and then i've been dragged into
[50:02] court on a monday
[50:03] and i think lord
[50:05] this is not even becoming of a believer
[50:07] and i'm sitting in the courthouse in
[50:09] lower heart waiting there for my hearing
[50:11] i'm thinking
[50:12] lord this is
[50:14] this is not really funny
[50:18] if the brethren knew i was here doing
[50:19] this
[50:20] this is not really what a believer does
[50:22] on monday
[50:23] in
[50:24] court some charges that that the lord
[50:28] knows
[50:29] i didn't do them or it's like oh why
[50:31] this is not i didn't i didn't purposely
[50:33] end up here
[50:35] i haven't done didn't go out to
[50:37] maim somebody or hurt them and then end
[50:38] up here because of you know it's you we
[50:41] don't know why but we trust in god
[50:44] and and
[50:46] but we have to learn to have faith in
[50:47] god
[50:49] and
[50:50] so you're going to go through that stage
[50:51] where everything is going to go there
[50:54] will be a time where things just won't
[50:55] go right for you whatsoever right
[50:57] but
[50:58] that's to mold your faith
[51:00] to mold and strengthen your faith
[51:02] because your faith has to be
[51:03] strengthened
[51:06] now
[51:08] you
[51:09] it's good there you know you're starting
[51:11] to get a bit stronger but
[51:13] but
[51:15] believers all through the ages have had
[51:17] been through this this is not a new
[51:19] journey
[51:21] this is not a new journey
[51:24] but
[51:26] i want to bring it now to
[51:28] the next step further after that after
[51:30] you've been through however many years i
[51:31] don't know what it is
[51:33] but for us because we live in the time
[51:36] that we live in
[51:37] for us here
[51:38] because there's such an onslaught of
[51:40] satan on every hand
[51:43] brother branham when he was here he said
[51:46] if i had a tv in my house i'll blast it
[51:48] out with a shotgun
[51:49] right
[51:50] now this is almost comical we've got a
[51:52] fridge with a tv on it
[51:55] in the fridge
[51:56] you connect your phone and you watch tv
[51:58] on the fridge
[52:02] you know he was talking about it in in
[52:04] the lounge now there's one in the
[52:05] kitchen
[52:07] on an appliance you get to keep food
[52:08] cold
[52:11] that's the world that we live in now we
[52:12] can laugh at that but through all these
[52:14] devices satan is coming in at every
[52:17] avenue
[52:19] and
[52:22] there needs to be a way that we rise up
[52:24] against that
[52:25] and and can combat that and overcome it
[52:27] easily
[52:28] easily
[52:30] there's got to be a way and there is
[52:32] there's an all-powerful god that's
[52:34] raised up a standard
[52:36] that we are going to defeat all of this
[52:37] easily
[52:39] all of the onslaught of satan from every
[52:41] hand all the fear that he's trying to
[52:42] put on at the moment all the confusion
[52:45] we're going to overtake that easily
[52:47] and the
[52:48] method that we have now which brother
[52:50] brandon was preaching when he was here
[52:51] is adoption
[52:53] as a placed son of god or a daughter of
[52:55] god
[52:57] a place son of god now jesus when he was
[53:01] on the ship
[53:02] he was
[53:05] he'd been preaching all day
[53:07] he was maybe a little hoarse he was
[53:08] tired when they got into the boat he
[53:10] thought i want to have a sleep
[53:12] i'm tired it's been a big day
[53:14] maybe he didn't eat all day maybe he
[53:16] just had some food that evening and went
[53:17] to sleep and he wanted to sleep
[53:21] and so he lay down in the boat and he
[53:22] went to sleep
[53:24] now satan thought oh here's my chance
[53:26] i'm going to drown him and his disciples
[53:29] in the middle of this sea so he started
[53:33] he can do this
[53:35] he started making the wind blow and
[53:36] everything and churning it all around
[53:38] and the sea was churning and the the
[53:40] disciples were starting to panic
[53:42] and they were trying to bail out the
[53:44] boat and put this sail in the right way
[53:46] and stare towards the right way that
[53:48] their sailing skills would tell them
[53:49] this is the way we've got to go now the
[53:50] wind's blowing this way turn this way
[53:51] there maybe they were disputing that a
[53:52] lot of them will fish them and they were
[53:54] boats when they they were figuring out
[53:56] how to do it and then they started to
[53:58] panic so much that they
[53:59] they were upset with the lord because he
[54:02] was with jesus because he was asleep in
[54:04] the boat they said master don't you care
[54:05] that we perish
[54:08] and he got up and he had a desire in his
[54:11] heart
[54:13] he knew a few things and and we need to
[54:15] catch this
[54:17] but i'm going to talk about this again
[54:18] he had a desire in his heart which was
[54:20] he wants to get some sleep yeah
[54:22] i'm tired i want to sleep
[54:25] he had another thought in his heart i
[54:26] have a desire to end up at calvary at
[54:28] this particular place
[54:30] that's my end not here
[54:33] right
[54:35] amen
[54:37] so he wakes up and he's he
[54:39] he wants to have a sleep he wants to
[54:41] sleep in a nice calm boat
[54:43] and he wants to
[54:45] the boat to
[54:46] gently drift to another shore in the
[54:49] morning he gets out and carries on that
[54:51] was his desire
[54:52] so then as a son of god what does he do
[54:56] he wait he gets out he stands up and he
[54:58] says rain stop wind stop
[55:02] that's right i'm going back to sleep
[55:06] right
[55:08] that's what he does
[55:09] he just says stop
[55:10] and he late
[55:12] then he lay back down and went to sleep
[55:14] the disciples said what manner of man is
[55:16] this
[55:17] what manner of man is this that even the
[55:20] wind and the waves obey him
[55:23] what manner of man what was he
[55:28] he was
[55:29] that was god in flesh
[55:32] a placed adopted son of god that
[55:36] had a desire so he just expressed it
[55:39] because what was happening was contrary
[55:40] to what he wanted to do
[55:42] and what he knew he was supposed to do
[55:43] so he just said when stop waves stop
[55:46] i'm going to sleep he was a place
[55:48] adopted son of god
[55:50] as are all of you
[55:53] amen
[55:54] you are the same if you were in the boat
[55:57] and you knew i've got to go to such and
[55:59] such a place
[56:01] and
[56:02] i'm actually quite tired
[56:05] an adopted son of god
[56:07] can stand up in the boat and say
[56:09] when stop waves stop i'm going back to
[56:12] sleep
[56:14] what manner of man is this
[56:17] see at that time there was one man
[56:18] causing trouble to satan's kingdom
[56:21] let me tell you there's going to be a
[56:22] lot of people causing trouble what
[56:25] manner of people is this
[56:27] because an adopted son of god is no
[56:29] different than god and flesh
[56:31] no different
[56:33] no different
[56:34] you're no different that's exactly what
[56:36] you are
[56:37] when jesus was walking along
[56:40] i just want to say one more but i'm
[56:41] going to carry on where jesus was
[56:42] walking along
[56:45] and there was a fig tree up ahead
[56:48] and he was hungry
[56:50] but it was about let's say folks come in
[56:52] the summer it was maybe it was like
[56:55] september and there were no figs on
[56:57] there because
[56:58] it wasn't the season for the figs
[57:01] but he walked past the tree he he did
[57:03] want some fruit though in his heart i
[57:04] want some fruit
[57:06] he saw the tree
[57:09] and for some reason
[57:11] i'll just say that for some reason he
[57:12] said no one's gonna eat any more fruit
[57:13] off you
[57:15] because he wanted some fruit there was
[57:16] none on there he just said no one's
[57:17] gonna eat any more fruit and carried on
[57:20] they went to the city did what they did
[57:21] they walked out the next day
[57:23] the disciples walked past the same fig
[57:25] tree and it was dead it was withering up
[57:28] and dying
[57:30] and they said
[57:32] he just spoke to that yesterday
[57:34] that no one's gonna eat any more fruit
[57:35] today we walk past and it's dying
[57:37] what manner of man is this
[57:40] what manner of man is this
[57:44] okay
[57:44] now i want to go back to the adoption
[57:46] idea right
[57:48] we go through this journey in our life
[57:50] in our christian walk
[57:52] and god tests us and tries us he tests
[57:55] and tries us
[57:56] because he wants to get us to a place
[57:58] where we have all authority and power
[58:01] everything
[58:03] he wants to get us to a place exactly
[58:05] like what he was when he was here that's
[58:07] that's his plan and purpose for us is
[58:09] what he was when he was here you tell me
[58:11] why it's any different
[58:14] you tell me why
[58:15] you tell me why if you wanted something
[58:17] off a tree you can and you were up
[58:19] i wouldn't say upset because i said i
[58:20] don't know why he did it no one will eat
[58:22] fruit off you anymore
[58:24] that tree will die
[58:26] or there'd be no fruit ever growing that
[58:28] tree ever again
[58:30] right
[58:32] now
[58:34] because adoption
[58:37] we go through this walk but god tests us
[58:39] and tries us because he wants to see
[58:42] is there characteristic like my
[58:43] characteristic
[58:45] are they going to act in situations like
[58:47] what i would act that's why we will go
[58:49] through hard things
[58:51] we'll go through challenging times
[58:53] we'll be tested in ways
[58:54] things like our judgment
[58:57] will be humiliated so we understand
[58:59] righteous judgment
[59:01] all of the pride will be beaten out of
[59:03] us because we have to understand
[59:04] righteous judgment we have to be humble
[59:07] god has to
[59:09] get us out the way so that he sees
[59:11] they're all out of the way
[59:13] he'll humiliate us in life if we're
[59:15] prideful he'll let us go through things
[59:17] to humiliate us to get that out of it
[59:18] whatever that thing is in us that that
[59:21] that if that got a hold of power
[59:25] then that would go the wrong way with it
[59:26] he has to get all of that out of us
[59:28] that's why the believer is going to go
[59:30] through hard things you're going to
[59:32] wonder why you you're going to be tried
[59:34] and tested like jesus said to
[59:36] that too that
[59:37] moses said to the church god said to
[59:38] moses look i've brought them these 40
[59:40] years to try them and test them and see
[59:42] what's in their heart
[59:43] and that's the process we're all going
[59:45] through
[59:46] as you're being tried and tested if
[59:48] you're not
[59:50] you should be
[59:52] now
[59:53] i'm going to get back to back
[59:56] god tries and tests us
[59:58] because the purpose to he wants that we
[1:00:01] have to get to
[1:00:03] not not we might get to what we are
[1:00:07] into
[1:00:08] i'm going to say into
[1:00:10] as an adopted son of god
[1:00:12] now they have a ceremony
[1:00:15] in this
[1:00:16] tradition the actual son is
[1:00:19] has a tutor which is and brother brown
[1:00:20] typed at the holy ghost but they have a
[1:00:22] tutor
[1:00:23] and they are taught and trained in all
[1:00:24] different things and the tutor goes back
[1:00:27] to the to the father and he says i've
[1:00:29] been seeing the sun the sun's been doing
[1:00:30] really good all the door's been doing
[1:00:31] really good they're doing this and this
[1:00:32] and this he says well that's good i'm
[1:00:34] happy with that that's good um yep keep
[1:00:36] going though because i've seen a few
[1:00:38] things so he goes back and he what he's
[1:00:42] doing is the the tutor knows what the
[1:00:44] father's character character is like and
[1:00:46] he knows what the father's intentions
[1:00:47] are and he knows how he runs his
[1:00:48] business
[1:00:50] he understands that
[1:00:51] and his job is to impart that same
[1:00:54] method characteristic and wisdom to the
[1:00:56] son that's his job or the daughter
[1:00:59] that's his job so he so this tutor will
[1:01:01] keep going
[1:01:03] and he'll keep training
[1:01:05] and the father is watching this
[1:01:07] happen and he's seeing his own
[1:01:09] characteristics coming to
[1:01:11] his son
[1:01:14] now his son's not in charge of nothing
[1:01:16] yet his son could ask father i need this
[1:01:18] could i get it i suppose you can yes
[1:01:20] here you go
[1:01:21] another day father i'm i'm you know i'm
[1:01:24] feeling really sick or might say that
[1:01:26] like i i would like to to buy this new
[1:01:28] horse may i can you give me some money
[1:01:30] to buy it yeah i guess you need a horse
[1:01:31] here's something okay
[1:01:34] he will ask for things
[1:01:36] right he will ask don't miss her see he
[1:01:38] will ask could i have this could i have
[1:01:40] that
[1:01:41] because he doesn't he doesn't own the
[1:01:43] father's wealth yet
[1:01:45] he's not
[1:01:46] the leader he
[1:01:48] his father is here he's here
[1:01:50] he asks
[1:01:52] could i have this could i have that
[1:01:54] you understand what i mean we asked lord
[1:01:56] could have this thought could i have
[1:01:57] that
[1:01:58] jesus didn't say lord may not eat from
[1:01:59] that tree he said tree no one will eat
[1:02:01] from you
[1:02:02] he got up to the boat and he said wind
[1:02:04] stop
[1:02:06] rain stop he didn't ask anybody
[1:02:09] because he was almighty god he just said
[1:02:11] stop
[1:02:12] he's in control of it all this is the
[1:02:14] father the father just say stop
[1:02:18] tree die that's what the father says he
[1:02:21] doesn't ask oh would that treat her who
[1:02:22] does he ask
[1:02:24] that's the apex of authority
[1:02:26] he's the apex of authority
[1:02:29] he doesn't ask anybody he says what he
[1:02:31] wants and it happens
[1:02:33] that's the way that it works
[1:02:36] now how are we any different
[1:02:37] when we come to the place of adoption
[1:02:40] how are we different than that
[1:02:43] no different
[1:02:44] we're no different
[1:02:51] so god
[1:02:52] at a certain point
[1:02:55] after been through all these things we
[1:02:56] decided to serve the lord we've said
[1:02:57] lord i'll give up everything and he
[1:02:58] knows we mean it we've gone through
[1:03:00] these trials and testings and all of
[1:03:01] these
[1:03:02] this prideful thing this that whatever
[1:03:04] it is in our life has been taken out and
[1:03:05] we've been tried and tested sometimes we
[1:03:06] don't know why but it's hard and it's
[1:03:08] listen to that
[1:03:09] don't worry about all that just keep
[1:03:10] going through it and at a certain point
[1:03:12] at a certain point
[1:03:16] at a certain point now
[1:03:19] now for all of us this is the bride's
[1:03:22] this is us
[1:03:23] at a certain point god looks at you
[1:03:26] he looks at you you you you
[1:03:29] he looks at you
[1:03:31] and he says
[1:03:32] i can see
[1:03:33] exactly that if you had all of my
[1:03:35] authority
[1:03:37] and all of my power
[1:03:39] if you had all of that
[1:03:42] at your disposal
[1:03:44] you'll do exactly as i would do
[1:03:49] if you had everything that i have
[1:03:51] what you speak
[1:03:54] goes
[1:03:56] every devil there were ten thousand
[1:03:58] devils
[1:03:59] ten thousand devils that were trying to
[1:04:01] sink that boat he just got up and spoke
[1:04:04] wind stopped
[1:04:07] rain stop
[1:04:09] why because he had absolute authority
[1:04:12] that's what i'm saying there's a force
[1:04:13] coming against the kingdom of satan that
[1:04:15] he's never encountered before
[1:04:17] when a people have absolute authority
[1:04:20] they just say stop
[1:04:22] they don't have to work themselves up
[1:04:24] and try and they say stop
[1:04:26] they don't even say it loud stop
[1:04:31] it's not about how loud i can go i'm
[1:04:32] going to go louder so you might be
[1:04:34] fearful of me no
[1:04:36] it's a position
[1:04:38] a positionally placed son of god has all
[1:04:40] the authority
[1:04:42] of god
[1:04:43] everything
[1:04:45] you don't have to ask
[1:04:48] you don't ask
[1:04:50] you say
[1:04:55] lord please stop this rain
[1:04:58] no no rain stop amen
[1:05:02] when
[1:05:02] brother branham
[1:05:04] was up the mountain
[1:05:07] he wanted to go hunting
[1:05:11] he got up the mountain he said to the
[1:05:13] brothers if it starts snowing you head
[1:05:14] back down because it's going to come in
[1:05:15] real fast and snow comes over we can't
[1:05:17] see nothing get out you'll be you'll be
[1:05:20] lost in the snow
[1:05:24] he was up there and it started snowing
[1:05:27] and he thought i better get back down
[1:05:30] but he had a desire to go hunting
[1:05:33] i've got a desire to hunt i'm
[1:05:34] disappointed i have to walk back down
[1:05:36] this hill
[1:05:37] because i came all this way to go for a
[1:05:39] hunt
[1:05:41] now god was for the hunt
[1:05:43] god was also for the hunt you know what
[1:05:45] i think it's a great idea you go for a
[1:05:47] hunt there
[1:05:48] he was for the hunt you go for a hunt
[1:05:51] god's for the hunt he's for the hunt now
[1:05:53] he's walking back down the hill not
[1:05:54] hunting something wrong with this
[1:05:56] picture
[1:06:00] god said there's something wrong with
[1:06:01] this picture
[1:06:02] go back up there you're hunting
[1:06:04] didn't you go hunting
[1:06:07] you want to go hunting
[1:06:09] so he walks back up the hill
[1:06:12] now this didn't happen so we can talk
[1:06:14] about it oh we serve a miraculous god
[1:06:16] this happened to show us
[1:06:18] who we are
[1:06:21] and what we have as positionally placed
[1:06:24] sons of god
[1:06:26] it wasn't to tell a story it's not i'm
[1:06:28] here telling you the story and we praise
[1:06:29] god because he did that
[1:06:30] although it's praiseworthy
[1:06:33] it's not for that
[1:06:35] and so we can understand this is us he
[1:06:37] stood there
[1:06:39] and god told him you can just tell that
[1:06:41] storm to disappear amen
[1:06:44] tell it to go so he said wind go rain go
[1:06:47] storm go
[1:06:48] you go away till i finish hunting here
[1:06:50] then you can do what you want after that
[1:06:52] you're free from my word
[1:06:54] you're free from the word that i've
[1:06:55] spoken when i finished here
[1:07:00] now what happened
[1:07:03] the wind
[1:07:04] the rain the clouds disappeared
[1:07:07] the snow it all stopped
[1:07:10] now
[1:07:12] now
[1:07:14] a positionally placed son of god if he
[1:07:16] has a desire
[1:07:18] can speak
[1:07:22] and that is what happens now that
[1:07:24] those things like with the
[1:07:26] squirrels i'll have a squirrel go from
[1:07:29] there to there
[1:07:31] he didn't ask for it
[1:07:34] he just said okay
[1:07:36] there to there and it went there
[1:07:39] a positionally placed son of god
[1:07:42] you know what you're saying
[1:07:45] you know what you're doing
[1:07:47] and what you say goes it's not
[1:07:49] it's not second guessed
[1:07:52] there's no committee that it goes to oh
[1:07:53] he said this shall we let it through
[1:07:56] shall we let this request through
[1:07:58] there's no committee it goes through
[1:08:00] a positionally placed son or daughter of
[1:08:02] god when they express a desire from
[1:08:04] their mouth
[1:08:06] it happens
[1:08:08] straight away
[1:08:10] it happens like they say it's going to
[1:08:12] happen because it came out of their
[1:08:13] mouth
[1:08:14] do you understand
[1:08:19] that's why elisha
[1:08:22] he had he had a touch of this and he
[1:08:24] cursed those boys
[1:08:26] and the bears went and got them
[1:08:30] that's why we're going to be tried and
[1:08:32] tested
[1:08:33] but
[1:08:36] when
[1:08:37] we our our program for all of us
[1:08:40] all of you
[1:08:42] you are this
[1:08:44] amen okay
[1:08:46] you are this
[1:08:48] this is what you all are
[1:08:51] i'm going to declare in jesus christ
[1:08:52] you're all adopted sons and daughters of
[1:08:54] god
[1:08:56] you are if you're not here if
[1:08:59] if you're not there yet
[1:09:01] you will be
[1:09:03] there's a ceremony that's going to
[1:09:04] happen with you with all of you
[1:09:07] a ceremony
[1:09:08] and god is going to say
[1:09:11] yes
[1:09:13] now is the time
[1:09:19] okay
[1:09:20] that's an occasion
[1:09:23] that's not something we make up that's
[1:09:24] an occasion that happens
[1:09:26] it's an event
[1:09:29] it's an event
[1:09:31] and it doesn't happen today and it's not
[1:09:32] here tomorrow it happens and that's you
[1:09:37] you're an adopted place son of god or
[1:09:40] daughter of god
[1:09:41] your life is never ever the same ever
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:46] ever i want to tell you a little story
[1:09:51] so
[1:09:52] the camp was a powerful time for me who
[1:09:54] had a powerful time at camp and i'm just
[1:09:56] gonna i'm gonna tell you the story that
[1:09:57] i'm gonna close
[1:10:01] the camp
[1:10:03] it was very powerful
[1:10:05] i got back from camp
[1:10:08] and i was on such a high
[1:10:11] that i didn't perceive how how much of a
[1:10:15] spiritual place i was in
[1:10:18] not to say that i'm anything it's just
[1:10:20] that there was a powerful presence of
[1:10:21] god at the camp
[1:10:22] and and i guess when you're just a
[1:10:24] bathing in it you you just
[1:10:26] it doesn't feel
[1:10:28] it feels normal because it's just been
[1:10:30] you're around her but i think when you
[1:10:31] go away and you're not around it it's a
[1:10:33] different you realize well i was
[1:10:35] actually and this this is quite an uh
[1:10:37] a spiritual time you know
[1:10:41] so
[1:10:43] and i'm going to declare something
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:48] this is a bit of a declaration of war to
[1:10:50] satan
[1:10:51] but you've got to lay out you've got to
[1:10:53] lay it out at some point so this is that
[1:10:54] we're going forward is it
[1:10:56] because this is the path we're all on
[1:11:00] this is not we're not just here to play
[1:11:01] we're not just here to
[1:11:03] you know come along
[1:11:05] we are the most powerful people in the
[1:11:07] face of the earth
[1:11:08] and satan's going to know all about it
[1:11:12] so
[1:11:15] after about two days i was three days
[1:11:17] whatever day it was maybe it was tuesday
[1:11:19] night we got back on maybe it was
[1:11:20] thursday night or whatever
[1:11:23] this has happened a couple of times and
[1:11:25] three or four times you know you
[1:11:26] in my life you just feel like i need to
[1:11:29] pray about something i mean you feel
[1:11:30] like to pray all the time but sometimes
[1:11:31] it just comes on strong and you
[1:11:33] you can't do anything you've just got to
[1:11:34] go and
[1:11:36] go and pray right you just gotta say
[1:11:38] lord
[1:11:39] you don't know why you just think i just
[1:11:41] have to
[1:11:41] there's something
[1:11:43] the lord wants to say something i don't
[1:11:44] know what it is now i don't want to
[1:11:45] appear like i'm spiritual
[1:11:48] but we all are spiritual
[1:11:49] and god can speak to each one of us
[1:11:51] doesn't matter how non-intellectual we
[1:11:53] are goggles but god speaks to all of us
[1:11:55] this is the way he deals with me he just
[1:11:57] puts this little feeling and i just have
[1:11:58] to go and
[1:11:59] lord and it's not made up i think i i'm
[1:12:02] going to try and make up this feeling
[1:12:03] and i don't think any of you do the same
[1:12:05] thing
[1:12:06] when you have your experience with god
[1:12:07] it's not made up it just happens a
[1:12:08] certain way
[1:12:10] and i was
[1:12:12] i didn't know what it was and i was
[1:12:13] sitting in in the office
[1:12:15] in my office and i sat down and and i
[1:12:17] had four words come to me
[1:12:19] that didn't make any sense at all and i
[1:12:21] wrote these words down on my phone
[1:12:23] because i thought that
[1:12:24] i would try and get away from the words
[1:12:25] and i'd just keep writing the words
[1:12:26] again this is strange words why would i
[1:12:28] write these four strange words
[1:12:30] so i just typed them into my phone and i
[1:12:32] sat my phone
[1:12:34] on my
[1:12:35] desk and i just started praying and just
[1:12:37] just meditating and
[1:12:39] forgot about the phone
[1:12:41] and
[1:12:42] it was a very powerful time
[1:12:44] because i was sitting there
[1:12:46] and
[1:12:48] i'm sitting there just
[1:12:50] not knowing about the phone and i
[1:12:52] this whole thing started happening
[1:12:55] this that out of the blue this whole
[1:12:58] lord i said that
[1:13:00] these thoughts started coming and like
[1:13:01] the lord is speaking because you're just
[1:13:02] in a and he's
[1:13:04] taken me through the process of adoption
[1:13:07] now make of what you want
[1:13:09] i'm sitting there and the lord showing
[1:13:11] me these things he says now is the time
[1:13:12] and he said he's saying
[1:13:14] it's hard to describe but something
[1:13:17] is dif something understands differently
[1:13:19] it just happens a certain way
[1:13:22] it just goes
[1:13:23] you can just
[1:13:25] and you understand he says
[1:13:28] this just happens once and then you're
[1:13:30] it you're never ever going to think the
[1:13:31] same again
[1:13:32] you can never do the same things you've
[1:13:34] ever done it life for you will never
[1:13:37] ever be the same
[1:13:38] this is happening and it's going to
[1:13:40] change your whole life
[1:13:42] you'll never be the same
[1:13:44] never
[1:13:45] and you start to get you you're thinking
[1:13:47] of this and he's saying and you then
[1:13:49] thoughts come and you start to think
[1:13:51] then what does that make me if i'm that
[1:13:53] then i can just speak things
[1:13:55] then how powerful does that make my
[1:13:56] tongue
[1:13:58] i'm thinking lord i'm thinking then you
[1:14:00] start to think of jesus you think when
[1:14:01] he was anything that's why he just said
[1:14:04] true uh fig tree don't grow anymore
[1:14:07] you understand the i think well i could
[1:14:09] do that i'm not saying and
[1:14:11] but you understand i see why he could
[1:14:13] just walk along and say that and carry
[1:14:15] on and it dies
[1:14:16] because that's what an adopted place son
[1:14:18] of god does
[1:14:20] and you start to understand this is why
[1:14:22] i've been going through all that stuff
[1:14:23] so that
[1:14:24] it's like how do i even open my mouth
[1:14:26] anymore how do i speak anymore this is
[1:14:29] such a powerful thing
[1:14:31] what i say
[1:14:32] goes
[1:14:35] right because what jesus said went is
[1:14:37] that correct
[1:14:39] now
[1:14:40] a place to adopt a son of god that has
[1:14:42] all the authority
[1:14:44] every single bit of authority of the
[1:14:46] kingdom of god what happens when he
[1:14:47] speaks a desire
[1:14:50] what is
[1:14:51] entwined in that desire
[1:14:57] everything
[1:14:58] all authority is in
[1:15:00] and when that word comes out
[1:15:02] what is that that comes into the
[1:15:04] existence of this natural realm
[1:15:07] what is that it's the third pull it's
[1:15:09] the it's the power of god it's the place
[1:15:11] adopted son of god just speaks
[1:15:14] um and
[1:15:16] i'm there thinking this is kind of a
[1:15:17] little bit
[1:15:18] i'm not thinking it's too intense but
[1:15:19] i'm thinking this is a strange thought
[1:15:22] and then i think lord i and i don't
[1:15:25] remember what i've written down the four
[1:15:27] words and i think lord what did i
[1:15:29] what did i write down
[1:15:30] i said maybe maybe there's something in
[1:15:32] there because i genuinely didn't
[1:15:34] remember god as my witness i didn't know
[1:15:36] what i wrote down i see maybe there's
[1:15:37] something in there that ties in with
[1:15:39] this because
[1:15:40] if it is i'll know this is from you if
[1:15:41] it's not i know i'm just
[1:15:44] don't know you know
[1:15:45] so i read my words that i wrote down
[1:15:48] that i
[1:15:49] i'm just saying i wasn't going to say
[1:15:51] anything about this but i'm just going
[1:15:52] to declare that he is here
[1:15:54] and that this is all of you and that
[1:15:56] this is that satan's got
[1:15:58] adopted sons and daughters of god
[1:16:01] heading his way
[1:16:03] with all the authority and the power of
[1:16:05] god
[1:16:08] so the first word i wrote down was grass
[1:16:11] i think lord i've just
[1:16:13] i've you know this is not making any
[1:16:15] sense the next word i wrote down was
[1:16:17] once
[1:16:18] the next word i wrote down was words and
[1:16:20] the last word was speak
[1:16:24] and it the lord's and this was i didn't
[1:16:26] know what grass meant but
[1:16:28] when i was having that experience the
[1:16:29] lord said this is just this just happens
[1:16:31] once
[1:16:32] life is never ever ever the same after
[1:16:34] this
[1:16:35] never you it doesn't
[1:16:37] that god doesn't think oh actually uh
[1:16:39] you did adoption thing the other day um
[1:16:41] yeah uh actually can we just backtrack
[1:16:43] on that i'll just grab the paperwork
[1:16:44] back and we'll i've decided to you know
[1:16:47] do it a year's time
[1:16:48] he doesn't do that
[1:16:50] it's once
[1:16:52] it doesn't
[1:16:53] and your life is never the same
[1:16:56] words because you start to understand
[1:16:58] the
[1:16:59] how powerful is this
[1:17:03] jesus when he was there he just spoke
[1:17:05] when god created the world
[1:17:07] he had a desire for some light
[1:17:09] he had a desire there so he said spoke
[1:17:11] out let there be light
[1:17:13] and there was light
[1:17:14] he didn't have to go to work
[1:17:16] didn't make it he just said let there be
[1:17:18] it was words
[1:17:20] and then speak we just
[1:17:23] we control everything by how we by what
[1:17:24] we speak
[1:17:26] not just
[1:17:27] not positive speaking but actually as a
[1:17:29] place adopted son of god
[1:17:32] right and i'm
[1:17:34] and i couldn't really talk for a couple
[1:17:35] of days i didn't say things yeah but i
[1:17:37] could talk a little bit but she wondered
[1:17:38] why i was going all funny
[1:17:40] because i thought lord this is hard how
[1:17:42] do you possibly engage with people like
[1:17:45] if this thing is so powerful
[1:17:47] how do we engage
[1:17:48] right
[1:17:50] you understand
[1:17:52] like if jesus was walking along
[1:17:55] and he said
[1:17:57] that house is such a silly house i wish
[1:17:58] that house wasn't there that house would
[1:18:00] fall down
[1:18:01] if he just
[1:18:03] like if he had a genuine desire it would
[1:18:06] fall down
[1:18:07] do you understand so it puts us in a
[1:18:09] predicament
[1:18:11] what of all this how do i engage how do
[1:18:13] i talk you
[1:18:15] can't even
[1:18:16] i still have to converse i've got things
[1:18:17] i've got to do i've got to deal
[1:18:19] day-to-day stuff how does this all work
[1:18:22] after a couple of days i went parked up
[1:18:24] at the river and i just looked down at
[1:18:25] the grass
[1:18:28] and i
[1:18:29] i thought you know we can i can probably
[1:18:31] just talk about the grass
[1:18:33] like it's just grass this grass is green
[1:18:35] the grass has to get mowed now and then
[1:18:37] the sheep eat the grass we pull out the
[1:18:41] grass
[1:18:42] you know it's a it's a subject that is
[1:18:44] just grass
[1:18:46] we we go to work we are involved in this
[1:18:48] so this piano is
[1:18:50] if i'm a piano sales person yeah this is
[1:18:52] piano it was a casio it's got this many
[1:18:54] keys
[1:18:55] it's you know
[1:18:57] it's
[1:18:57] black
[1:18:59] it costs two thousand dollars
[1:19:01] it's just
[1:19:02] it's just words it's just grass
[1:19:05] we can just converse like
[1:19:08] it's grass
[1:19:10] this here is a seat
[1:19:12] but if i had a desire in my heart for
[1:19:14] that piano
[1:19:17] and and and i
[1:19:21] and and it made it through
[1:19:23] and i thought i want that piano i could
[1:19:24] speak out
[1:19:25] i want that piano
[1:19:27] in my house
[1:19:28] now
[1:19:29] that's different because that's coming
[1:19:31] now from a desire
[1:19:34] right when god said let there be
[1:19:35] lightness because he had a desire for
[1:19:36] there to be light so he said let there
[1:19:38] be light but jesus would converse with
[1:19:39] his disciples how did you sleep you
[1:19:41] sleep well did you
[1:19:43] you know yeah have some of this would
[1:19:45] you like some i've just finished cooking
[1:19:46] this here would you like something it's
[1:19:47] just conversing it's just grass it's
[1:19:49] just factual things that
[1:19:51] because we have to still converse this
[1:19:53] is where i thought how am i gonna even
[1:19:54] operate in this world like this
[1:19:57] but as soon as we have a desire
[1:20:00] and
[1:20:02] we want it
[1:20:03] we can
[1:20:06] that's different because that comes from
[1:20:07] a desire and when that comes out
[1:20:09] that's now
[1:20:12] that's different than talking about that
[1:20:13] piano as black
[1:20:15] do you understand me it's different
[1:20:17] it's actually
[1:20:19] it's coming now from a place of desire
[1:20:21] and we can have it and not not not we
[1:20:23] can have it
[1:20:25] that's it
[1:20:28] and
[1:20:29] you think differently because when you
[1:20:30] when you think of something let's say
[1:20:32] jesus because he wanted to go to calvary
[1:20:34] and he was in the boat he could just
[1:20:36] speak his way there okay one stop rain
[1:20:39] stop i'm going over here
[1:20:41] we're the same because we know where
[1:20:42] we're going if we know what the lord's
[1:20:43] purpose is
[1:20:44] we just speak
[1:20:47] and he said
[1:20:50] that we had a certain issue and i said i
[1:20:52] thought no that this has got to be this
[1:20:53] way for this thing i'm trying to achieve
[1:20:54] for the lord i said that will be this
[1:20:57] particular way
[1:20:58] he said to me because he didn't know i
[1:21:00] haven't i've mentioned this to me said
[1:21:02] are you speaking that by faith or did
[1:21:03] god tell you
[1:21:05] just as a passing conversation and i
[1:21:07] said what's kind of the same thing
[1:21:11] but
[1:21:12] you understand because
[1:21:16] when you
[1:21:17] when you're fully surrendered to the
[1:21:18] lord and you serve the lord
[1:21:20] then you just speak it there's going to
[1:21:23] be like this and i'll tell you what to
[1:21:25] this day it's like
[1:21:26] that it's like that
[1:21:29] now
[1:21:30] this is not me
[1:21:33] this is us
[1:21:34] this is what brother branham preached
[1:21:37] this is this is all of us this is our
[1:21:40] journey
[1:21:42] satan thought he had trouble with one
[1:21:44] man jesus christ walking around
[1:21:47] he thought he had trouble that's why i
[1:21:49] say he's got a force coming against him
[1:21:51] that he is not going to know what to do
[1:21:52] with the most powerful force to hit him
[1:21:55] is on its way at the door
[1:21:57] and he's not going to know what to do
[1:21:58] with it why because i'm looking at about
[1:22:00] what 40 here
[1:22:03] 40 people that are just like jesus
[1:22:05] christ
[1:22:06] exactly the same
[1:22:08] exactly the same power exactly the same
[1:22:10] you are god and flesh
[1:22:12] placed adopted sons of god
[1:22:14] that's who you all are
[1:22:16] imagine that's why
[1:22:18] this that
[1:22:19] the song says there's a bride rising up
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:23] because
[1:22:24] they are placed adopted place sons and
[1:22:27] daughters of god
[1:22:28] that then
[1:22:29] don't have to fear anything
[1:22:32] don't worry about anything you just walk
[1:22:34] and if you know where you're going and
[1:22:36] something's not the way it should be
[1:22:39] what do you do
[1:22:41] lord make this this way
[1:22:46] yes kind of
[1:22:47] but why can't you say
[1:22:51] this is gonna be that way
[1:22:53] this will be that way
[1:22:55] that will be that way
[1:22:58] jesus said that when he was here this
[1:23:00] will be that way
[1:23:02] see
[1:23:03] now that we've now that we've brought
[1:23:04] this out satan's going to be all
[1:23:07] upset right but
[1:23:08] this is who you all are
[1:23:11] this is what brother brown's desire was
[1:23:13] for us to become placed adopted sons of
[1:23:15] god
[1:23:16] and he said to the church this is where
[1:23:17] you're all going wrong you're going off
[1:23:18] and all this other stuff you are all
[1:23:20] supposed to be here
[1:23:21] this is where you're all supposed to be
[1:23:24] then you realize it's actually for us
[1:23:26] so that's why i declare this is what is
[1:23:29] for all of us
[1:23:30] placed adopted sons of god you are no
[1:23:34] different
[1:23:34] than jesus christ walking on earth
[1:23:37] no different
[1:23:39] absolutely no different at all
[1:23:42] and you can't make it up you can't it's
[1:23:44] not that it's god and it's surrendering
[1:23:46] your life completely to god and god
[1:23:48] knows
[1:23:49] and he he i can see my son i can see
[1:23:52] myself in them
[1:23:55] now and that's it and
[1:23:58] life is never ever ever the same
[1:24:00] never because
[1:24:02] there's a difference between saying
[1:24:05] father could i have that over there
[1:24:08] versus
[1:24:12] i want that
[1:24:14] do you understand there's a there's a
[1:24:15] there is a difference these are not the
[1:24:17] same
[1:24:19] now
[1:24:20] when you're over here
[1:24:23] what chance does satan have i talked
[1:24:24] about the cheat code that i'm closing
[1:24:26] now what chance does he have
[1:24:28] he's going to be sitting waiting oh no
[1:24:30] what are they going to say
[1:24:32] we're going to try and get them this way
[1:24:35] when they find out what we're trying to
[1:24:37] do
[1:24:38] what are they going to say
[1:24:40] because satan's always trying to trick
[1:24:41] and sneak in and do things
[1:24:43] careful guys as soon as they see us
[1:24:46] we're done
[1:24:48] as soon as they find out our plan
[1:24:50] we're done
[1:24:52] because as soon as they speak
[1:24:54] it's all over it doesn't matter how many
[1:24:56] devils
[1:24:57] every think about this now is my last
[1:24:59] thought think about this
[1:25:00] every single devil in hell
[1:25:04] every single millions and millions of
[1:25:06] them could come against you
[1:25:08] everything the whole of the the kingdom
[1:25:10] of satan could come against you
[1:25:15] and you could just say
[1:25:17] go back
[1:25:18] amen amen that's right
[1:25:21] right
[1:25:22] it doesn't have to be all this there's
[1:25:24] the whole kingdom i'm going to need a
[1:25:25] couple of guys here
[1:25:26] now it doesn't work like that they were
[1:25:28] you understand yeah
[1:25:30] it doesn't work like that you just say
[1:25:32] you
[1:25:33] who are you
[1:25:36] and if you
[1:25:37] and you will speak what the desire of
[1:25:39] god is
[1:25:42] now that goes without saying right you
[1:25:44] can't you won't get there without just
[1:25:45] being able to then suddenly oh make this
[1:25:47] world make that it won't happen that way
[1:25:48] but
[1:25:49] it
[1:25:50] just like paul he was harassed by that
[1:25:52] lady for days days
[1:25:54] after a couple of days maybe the lord
[1:25:56] said okay tell her to go sit down go
[1:25:59] you know it's like that you don't just
[1:26:01] speak stuff you think
[1:26:03] man what i speak goes
[1:26:05] i'm not just gonna speak stuff i'm going
[1:26:07] to just you you wait you think lord
[1:26:11] when and then now and then you get a
[1:26:13] desire say this
[1:26:18] and you know when you say it that's it
[1:26:26] it's a cheat code i shouldn't call it
[1:26:28] that but it's just
[1:26:30] it becomes too easy and as the pressure
[1:26:32] comes on more you just
[1:26:34] if you get real hungry this is what now
[1:26:36] this is what i'm getting to know like if
[1:26:38] you get really hungry that's why you can
[1:26:40] just speak your dinner onto the table
[1:26:42] i desire some food i'm quite hungry
[1:26:44] and i don't believe i'm going to die of
[1:26:47] starvation because i believe i've got to
[1:26:48] go to the air to see brother sign so
[1:26:50] that's my calling and i'm quite hungry
[1:26:51] today
[1:26:52] and i'd like this for dinner you think
[1:26:54] that right so you think and if it gets
[1:26:56] through you think yes i can get that you
[1:26:57] just speak it and we'll be there
[1:27:00] dinner
[1:27:03] this is not a made-up story this is
[1:27:06] the force that satan's got coming
[1:27:07] against me trying to starve us out you
[1:27:09] know let's let's not let them get any
[1:27:11] food
[1:27:13] no we don't need to put supplies in our
[1:27:15] cupboard stack up on cans
[1:27:18] we've got the
[1:27:20] the manna from heaven
[1:27:22] the jesus feed the five thousand he just
[1:27:24] said okay pray for the food and and he
[1:27:26] said to them distribute the food
[1:27:29] we just we can say okay president line
[1:27:31] up
[1:27:32] amen
[1:27:35] seconds
[1:27:37] you see that's who we are
[1:27:39] that's that's the force that satan's got
[1:27:41] there is no angle he can come that he
[1:27:43] can get us
[1:27:44] and it's and this is just one person
[1:27:48] one person this whole kingdom cannot
[1:27:50] defeat one person
[1:27:52] one place adopted son of god they one
[1:27:55] person think of the trouble he's gonna
[1:27:56] have this whole bunch of them
[1:27:58] if you can't even defeat one
[1:28:00] single person
[1:28:03] that's what i said at the start he's got
[1:28:05] something coming on to his kingdom that
[1:28:07] he's never ever ever seen before in the
[1:28:11] existence of his whole time he's been
[1:28:12] here his whole miserable time and
[1:28:14] amongst this whole peril that he's
[1:28:15] trying to create the satan's eden
[1:28:18] right in the midst of that god raises up
[1:28:20] his standard and says here's my final
[1:28:22] operation
[1:28:23] here's my final force
[1:28:25] and it's more powerful than anything you
[1:28:27] can ever do
[1:28:28] when the spirit of when the enemy comes
[1:28:30] in like a flood the spirit of god will
[1:28:32] raise up a standard against it it's over
[1:28:34] all of the stuff
[1:28:36] and you just walk along humble it's
[1:28:38] going to be i'm going to read you one
[1:28:39] poem then i'm done
[1:28:41] this is the poem they wrote about
[1:28:42] brother brown and then i'm finished okay
[1:28:44] because here's here's the characteristic
[1:28:46] of an adopted son and i'm going to say
[1:28:48] daughter of god
[1:28:50] he's not a man of stature at all
[1:28:53] this is what the brethren wrote about
[1:28:54] him that knew him
[1:28:55] they wrote it and they put it on a
[1:28:59] read this and you'll understand this is
[1:29:00] what an adopted son of god looks like
[1:29:03] he's not a man of stature tall nor lofty
[1:29:05] in his way he sounds himself no trumpet
[1:29:08] as he goes from day to day has no desire
[1:29:11] for wealth or fame but none his place
[1:29:13] could fill he's just the way we want him
[1:29:15] our own dear brother bill
[1:29:17] he teaches us with faithfulness the
[1:29:19] undiluted word no fancy ways no love for
[1:29:22] praise just following the lord his
[1:29:24] speech is soft and gentle
[1:29:27] he raises not his voice except to cry
[1:29:28] against the wrong and then he has no
[1:29:30] choice
[1:29:31] never got a lot of learning from
[1:29:32] colleges and schools
[1:29:34] but he knows what's important and he's
[1:29:36] sure nobody's full
[1:29:38] for the knowledge he has given is
[1:29:40] eternal from above he has no creed
[1:29:41] except for christ in the law but
[1:29:42] sovereign love there was no great
[1:29:45] announcement to his lowly humble birth
[1:29:47] but to us he's the greatest man who
[1:29:48] lives upon the earth they don't mean
[1:29:50] outside of christ we count it more than
[1:29:52] privilege to know him as a friend we
[1:29:54] cherish all he stands for and will write
[1:29:55] to the end
[1:29:56] he says he's not a preacher he's modest
[1:29:58] as can be
[1:30:00] but get him in the pulpit and it isn't
[1:30:01] hard to see
[1:30:02] he was for ordained a prophet let men
[1:30:04] call it what they will god granted us
[1:30:06] great favor when they gave us brother
[1:30:08] bill
[1:30:10] now remember this is not stories this is
[1:30:12] reality he was that first wave she's
[1:30:14] offering amen he was the first one
[1:30:17] that's why he said
[1:30:18] wind go back to where you were for three
[1:30:20] days
[1:30:21] why because he's saying this is what the
[1:30:23] rest of the the crop is going to look
[1:30:25] like this
[1:30:28] that's it that's why that's that didn't
[1:30:30] happen that's why it didn't happen to
[1:30:31] tattoo so we say wow that was a great
[1:30:32] miracle no to show this is you
[1:30:36] squirrels go here cancer go
[1:30:39] to show this is you that was the wave
[1:30:41] sheath
[1:30:42] that's and that's all of us that's god's
[1:30:45] plan for all of you people here it's
[1:30:47] going to be the most fantastic
[1:30:50] series of years whatever
[1:30:52] it's going to be the most fantastic time
[1:30:54] the believers ever had and we all get to
[1:30:56] be a part of it
[1:30:58] and we're all on that journey it's going
[1:30:59] to be where
[1:31:01] the world is going to go to complete
[1:31:02] chaos
[1:31:03] and we're going to be having so much fun
[1:31:05] we're going to be just relaxing and
[1:31:07] enjoying you know just just walking with
[1:31:09] the lord it's going to be

[1:31:12] the greatest time that's why brother
[1:31:13] branham said lord i'd rather live now
[1:31:15] than any other time

[1:31:18] fear
