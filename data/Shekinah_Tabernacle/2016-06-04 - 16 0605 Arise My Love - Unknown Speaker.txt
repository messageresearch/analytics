amen it's great to have all the visitors here God bless you trust you feel at home God bless you you know I guess it's long weekend half everyone goes out and and half of the visitors come in so it's nice I guess but amen praise the Lord I was start from verse uh verse 10 we're just going to read down to verse uh verse 14 say the Song of Solomon Chapter 2 my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fear one and come away FL the winter has passed the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds has come and the voice of the turtle which is the turtle dos heard in our land the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with The Grapes give a good smell Arise My Love my fear one and come away oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs Of The Cliffs of The Rock and the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and our countenance is comely amen and we just go to Hebrews chapter 12 and um we're just going to read we're going to read from verse um we're going to read from verse 11 and we're going to read down to verse uh 24 I'm just kind of jumping in through this thought of of the Lord chastening his children but it says now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterwards it yith the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble knees uh and make and make straight paths for your feet least that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men in Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently Le any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of business springing up trouble you and whereby many be defiled least there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright for ye know how that afterwards when he had inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no peace uh place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears for ye are not come unto uh the mount which might be touched that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice uh they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded so as so if as much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye have come but ye have come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen may the Lord bless his word you may be be seated now I want to um I want to continue I've been we've been looking into the Song of Solomon Chapter 2 for for uh quite a few weeks now and we you know just a just a recap very briefly you know we see that uh when when when the Beloved speaks to uh you know so so when the bridegroom speaks to the bride and he says Rise up my love my fair one come away we see that there's a season there's a change in the season when he actually says now rise up and come away and and this is you see the winter is passed and now Springtime the rain is and the rain is gone the flowers appear on the earth sorry can you turn me down a little bit the flowers appear on the earth the time of singing has come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land and the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs and the vine the tender grapes uh which give a good smell so we understand Jesus would would would be asked three questions by his disciples you know when shall the temple be destroyed when is these things going to happen and when is the end of the world and and and Jesus answered those three things in Matthew 24 and 25 and and he said when you see the viig Tre put forth her buds you know that summer is not even at the doors and that generation shall not pass to all things be fulfilled so he begin to say when you see this fig tree put forth then we understand that in Prophecy the Fig Tree or figs uh in Prophecy is Israel because you read Jeremiah 24 and Jeremiah sees two baskets of figs one good and one bad and and God gives the interpretation of those two baskets and it's one part of Israel I mean they'll both be taken into captivity but the good figs are those of Israel that will come back into the land but the bad figs will just be scattered and will never return so in the Bible that we know the figs uh speak of speak of Israel so he says when the so the Fig Tree put forth the green figs and the vines uh unto the tender grape and they give a good smell so he's saying now when you see the Fig Tree put forth that that is when I'm going to say Arise My Love My Fair one and come away and we're living in that day we've heard a voice we've heard the voice of the bridegroom in this hour that's actually said rise rise up my love my fair one and come away and and we can see that that God has raised up his children above the things of the world Amen Once Upon a Time you uh you thought that you this is where you're from and this is where you lived and your your culture governed how you thought and you know everything was now and then and dolls sense and what you see and but then God came your way one day and you begin to realize that you know there's more to this life than just this life you know some people you know some people think that we're just energy yeah and then and then everything is just energy and then when you die you know you just go back into what this energy is then you may come forth as a tree or a bug or whatever next time cuz you're Just Energy but that is but that is quite frankly that's quite ridiculous because if we were just energy why are we not like all the rest of the animals you know you see like the you know like the gorilla or the even the chimpanzee 99.9% the same DNA as you but yet they build their nests and then they have children and then their children build the same kind of nests and then their children have the same kind of N and you know but man you know we go back a hundred years we didn't have these kind of Technologies you man is always improving itself there's a very different you know we are a very different kind of being it's because we have a soul amen I mean the chimpanzee doesn't have a soul or you know whatever you know even even like a salmon you know I was I was I was looking to this and you know salmon they they they they spawn in a river they go out to seea and then they and they can spend about seven years in in the ocean but yet the vast majority of them will come back to the same river they will spawned in and then they and then they'll spawn then they'll die then the hatchlings are Hatch and they'll go out to sea 7 years later they come back again and the cycle just keeps repeating itself that's just animal life amen we're not energy friends there's more to this world and I'm sure that's why you're sitting here today cuz you've realized there's more to this world there's more to this life than just this life we're not just a vapor that just disappears that's right amen when we're done so we have risen God God has caused you to rise above the things of the world am mean you you and maybe your who's not even a believer or maybe even just a nominal Church person you may face the same situation but you will look at it very different to the other person I mean cuz you've recognized that God's in control and not only that God is in control but he's ordained your steps and he's trying to mold you in a certain way and show you a certain thing just like job was on the ash sheep and after job was off the as sheep he realized I know my redeemer lives amen amen the trials of Life are meant to drive you towards God not drive you away from God that's why job could just stand there he didn't understand it you know God didn't come down to job and say well job the reason this is all going is because I had a Satan came up before me and I pointed you out to Satan he didn't point you out I pointed you out and I said you're a perfect man and then he laid down the challenge and I'm not afraid of a challenge so I said challenge except the devil he never explained it to him amen but yet all job job could just stand flat footed in his trial he didn't understand it he wasn't really that happy about it but yet God allowed all that to happen that he would say now I know my redeemer lives and in this flesh I shall see God and I will stand him on that day upon the Earth he didn't know those things before but afterwards he knew exactly who God was he said I've heard of thee but now I see thee he used to sacrifice a lamb he was he he did what God God commanded him to do but yet he didn't know God hallelujah but then he met the one he was sacrificing to got to be more than stories friends this word is not a story book this message is not just a bunch of tapes it's a living God revealed and he's not back in 1965 he's right here in 2016 amen he's a present help him time of trouble that's what the scripture tells me Hallelujah so now we have risen above and as as the bride Rises Satan is cast down Hallelujah because we are ascending to our rightful position in Christ and now to the so now Paul in the book of Hebrews if you read the book of Hebrews you know he's writing obviously to Hebrews he's writing to Jewish Believers that have come out of Judaism but he is but they have they have come out of Judaism but he's now calling them he always he's always admonishing them let us go on to Perfection you know let us go on you know he's always calling drawing trying to call them to a higher walk with God and you would think that they would not really need to be admonished this way because what they even had then was greater with than what they had under the law but Paul was constantly trying to tell them what you have is greater amen what you have is more what you have is more powerful what you have is greater you know it wasn't blood every year by a high priest that was a man now you have a living high priest an eternal high priest Jesus Christ and by one offering he Sanctified them forever which are you know mean perfected them forever which are Sanctified so he was he was saying what you have is greater now you can go into the holy of H H before you could never go into the presence of God like that am me he was admonishing them what you have is greater what you have is more and he did this because he had to show them now this is because you know it's like the simple illustration if a dog has a bone and you've got a fresh bone you don't take away the the bone he's chewing on just give him the fresh one and then he'll forget the old bone then you can take it away so they had to show them you have more now you just have to step into what God has done for you amen so he was consciously telling them that it was better the law he says he was contrasting in Hebrews what they had under the blood of bulls and goats the the levitical priesthood the outward Conformity the to the law was not as good it was inferior to what they had under the blood of Jesus Christ under grace he contrast everything to show that they have greater than what they did and now this this you think is obvious back then but now but we've come to another time where we are not living under a denominational understanding anymore we're not living under denominational age anymore but now God has revealed because the message reveals Christ in the scripture amen so now God had to come and he has pointed us back to the true word of God and he's trying to tell us now in this end time that God has restored the truth and power of His word amen so that as church has advanced Beyond Believers just living the same old life and every time they do something wrong they just say forgive me Jesus because that's what unfortunately the denominational world has reduced to that people just accept some kind of mental idea they say a sin is prayer but there's no change in their life and they live the same all kind of life but then they just say prayer Lord forgive me and then they just walk on but that is not what the blood of Jesus Christ does to a Believer amen amen so there must be a contrast and there is a contrast we must understand that the blood of Jesus Christ is not just a nice idea amen it's just not just a nice you know oh well I wasn't that need he died for me but there's power in that blood that was released and that power is still as great today as it was back then and it can transform you as it transform many other people and that is not ping the sky it's a living reality Hallelujah if we could just recognize what we have and what God God has done for you Hallelujah then we'd really Rejoice amen so now it's not just joining a church and being religious and knowing Jesus died for you just mentally but he a and and that he is a distant God someplace and he's only a god of History it is a CH it's not that anymore our brother bam did this but the same God is alive today people make a tradition out of what he did and sure it's wonderful what God did through that man but it's back there the same word he preached the same life that was in him is now in the bride amen cuz it's a same Lord Jesus Christ if he is the same yesterday today and forever he may change the way he appears but the core being of himself is the same amen so if he's the same then exactly what he did back there he'll do today amen so so it is but it is now a God that can that that transforms his people by his word and that he comes and dwells in you and gives you the power to overcome amen it's not just talking about it but it's actually seeing God take Dominion hallelujah amen so now we so we have to you know we have to recognize that you know I was thinking this is Queen's birthday weekend and we know this is the day we celebrate the Queen's birthday but to me it's it's it's significant because there's been a birth of another queen Amen in this age not talking about one person I'm talking about a people all over the earth a queen has been born we know all the past ages they're part of that number as well but there's a queen upon the Earth that not just not just looks at becoming but they become amen amen that they Paul would say that you would know as you are knowing it says in Corinthians that you shall know as you are knowing so there must come a time time where you know exactly as God knows you not what you think you are or what you know about yourself because many times that is vastly different to what he knows about you amen so you got to know how does I must know as I am known and this is this is not your desire this is God's desire I want you to know who you are what I've done for you that I place the devil under your feet amen that Dominion's been given to the children of the king amen amen right now yes sir Hallelujah now I said last Sunday Satan has been has uh you know Satan has cast out as a de as as the bride begins her Ascension and we can even see this because you know if you've become a real believer the devil has already been cast out amen he was once governing the Throne of your life but then God came along and cast him out he was dethroned Hallelujah and God took his position upon your throne amen so already the devil's been dethroned in your life amen you used to you used to be governed by what he wanted you to do and it tells us in it tells us in Ephesians chapter 2 he says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also you all had our we all had our conversation in times past I'm glad Paul puts himself in that verse as well we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together in Christ by Grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is God's doing amen you may be in the same kind of body but you're walking in a totally different realm Hallelujah so he has raised us up so Satan what is what is the purpose of the preaching of the word to cast out Satan amen that that that children are birthed into the kingdom and Satan is cast out because he must be cast out of every bride member amen because it's not just you know you know he must be dethroned Hallelujah and God must take the throne amen so it's so important now where God God would come to you and he and it doesn't matter you know you got to look at what you have been and what you are amen look at the effect of what has the word done for you and it may manifest in many different ways but what's the end result amen it's like a birth same woman can have just say three children for example and all the births could be very different some could be good some could be bad some could need medical intervention but a child's born what's the end result amen and so you going to see is is the life in me producing the life of Jesus Christ amen that's what you got to see that's the most important thing so now as I said uh you know as I read there in Hebrews chapter 12 Paul is saying you have not come to the mountain you know Mount Si with the law and God being distant from you you have not come to that place see he contrasting now you have not come to that place but you have come to Mount Zion amen the city am mean unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels now we understand that the so this is where this is where the bride has come to in this last day and we understand that that that Mount Zion God would say in Psalms 132: 13 he'd say for the Lord has chosen Zion and he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it so it's God's desire to dwell in Zion and we understand that Zion is not a not just a place in Jerusalem but it speaks of the bride of Christ because because um I think it was you know it's one of the Apostles in Acts chapter 7 he begins to preach from Moses down he says but but Solomon built him a house house speaking of the Living God he says how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me sayth the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hands made all things so he's saying that that that that that Earthly house was not the place of his rest he saying the the very soul of man is the dwelling place of God am mean that is the dwelling place so now when God says that I have chosen Zion and have desired it to be his habitation and saying this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I've desired it he's speaking that's his desire towards you amen that I have I have chosen Zion it's not it's not that the bride chooses him you know he chooses her amen him and his choosing chose you amen before the foundation of the world he chose you you know I was just thinking people say how do you know know my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life slam you know you have the lamb slam before the foundation of the world one simple thing you don't worship the Beast the scripture is very clear thou all will worship Him whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life how do you know I'm not one of them I don't worship the Beast I mean in my Deeds or my Doctrine or what I believe we've heard a voice in this day and we've been called out and it doesn't matter how how watered down they try and make Christianity to try and merge the whole thing together there's just something in me saying I don't want to go there because I've heard a voice that says come out of her and there's something in me that I just died and I yielded and I say yes Lord I'll come Hallelujah I trust I trust you've had the same experience amen so God has God has desired that Zion would be his habitation but we understand that there was another one who who has desired the same the same place because Satan wanted to get into the bride of Christ as well because Satan wants to be like the most high and to be like the most high now so so he wants to be worshiped and he is over the Earth but he wants to get place where he can go to the throne of God remember in the beginning he was the Cherub that covers so he was he was right there by God but then he was cast down and then and then he he he in Eden he wanted to get into the human race in order to get into Israel and they wanted to get into Israel in order to to get into the church and then he wanted to get into the church so he could get into the bride and he wanted to get into the bride because he knew the bride was going to the throne amen but so so he has he had a desire I'm going to dwell on her she shall not be yours but you shall be mine but God he's not afraid of a challenge he's not scared amen he doesn't shrink back and say oh Satan oh what am I going to do with this guy he created him as an instrument you got to understand Satan is an instrument in the hands of God he can do nothing until he gets permission from God he can do absolutely nothing he couldn't kill job am mean he couldn't the first time he goes up before God he couldn't even make him sick he couldn't even touch his body God gave strict parameters Satan you can only work within this and then he goes back and says look you know God says look he hasn't cursed you he said just because he's not sick yet then God gives him more parameters you can touch him but don't take his life amen and God it was actually Satan asking permission boss he would never call him boss but this is basically what I saying can I do this cu the boss is in charge amen he doesn't acknowledge it but that's basically what Satan does boss can I go do this and and he said yeah you can do this but not do this and we can see in the life of Job he could not overstep the boundaries that God gave him no matter how much he wants to no matter how much he would have tried that he just he literally cannot do it amen so God God allowed Satan to come against job amen and God knew he was going to do it and he wasn't getting a live stream as it was happening he already knew it was happening and it's the same thing with you why did this happen just rest in the fact God allowed it to happen to me God knew it happened remember God had confidence in job because job had confidence in the lamb that he offered and that's why he had confidence in job that's the same thing you you brother Bram says job didn't think he was righteous or thought he was perfect he had confidence in the lamb and if that could be a man who only just heard of God and had no idea who he was even though he is a wise man and he just had a had an animal to sacrifice how much more the bride of Christ how much more those who really know their maker they really know their father how much more them amen we can rest Hallelujah in the fact God is in control amen now so we have come we have come to the place where God dwells which is which is US unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels now this is very interesting because in the Old Testament there especially the Hebrews you know they had they knew what Moses did you know they had a lot of God of history and it was always like in Moses day or the Old Testament day was God above them that Jesus was Emanuel god with them but he didn't just want to stay with them he wanted to be in them and when you know I was thinking about how you know Peter James and John they knew fishing you know they knew what fishing was they knew what reading the Bible was they knew what the synagogue was you know they they uh knew that there was a messiah coming and they knew that you know one day there was a heaven and a and and the grave and you know they just knew those things but they're out there somewhere and then Jesus came and then he opened a whole new Supernatural realm to them that was already there amen the devil was still always there God was there the Angels were there they had no idea amen and so God began to open up a realm that was Far different to fishing and synagogue and Priests and scribes and Pharisees you know they saw Lazarus come forth they never seen a man riding in the grave come forth alive Al healthy and well they never seen a man stand on the brow of the boat and say peace be still am mean they never seen you know lepers cleans like that and all manner of diseases come out and a woman Touch the Hem of His Garment and you know be made whole and they never heard a man say in My Father's House of many mansions I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am you shall be also they had an idea about all these things but then Jesus God came and a great purpose he had them with them as he wanted to show what you see is such a small bit of life amen this is this is just a vapor the scripture tells us and people invest so much into this world and all the physical things hey we need to work and we need to provide and we need to have a house and we need to do those things but don't let it become your all in all always look at it as a means to an end always look at it that way and so God begin to you know Jesus begin to show them now that even even even he said when when when when they came into the Garden of Gethsemane Peter takes out a sword I'm going to defend the Lord and he and he tries to kill the guy and he cuts off his ear because he's not a swordsman and then Jesus just says to him don't you know I can call and get a whole Legion of angels amen he didn't know about Legions of angels Jesus knew about Legions of angels but but Peter had no idea I mean he's trying to open their eyes of understanding the spiritual understanding that life is more than these dimensions and these things we see you know this this world even if you take the spectrum of know your your light spectrum you take the whole Spectrum from The High Frequency to very low frequency the visible range is very small and this is the realm we operate in amen and we get so caught up in you know you know you see something go wrong and oh what's going to happen it's just such a little bit don't look at the little little but look to the Unseen amen we're called to look to the Unseen in this day and hour and then so this this innumerable company of angels this word innumerable is exactly the same word as as we would read about in in in Revelations chapter 9 where a 100,000,000 uh demons were you know released from the rivie frates this word innumerable is the same as that word thousand thousand just means it means it means uh it means actually a 10,000 by extension a myriad or an indefinite number so such a such a high number they didn't really have enough zeros to you know a word to really put it into a bill that's why I said inumerable company of angels so you know we have come the bride has come to a a walk with God where we recognize the Unseen realm was a lot more real than what we see here amen and the bride operates in a realm that is not by sight amen we we never confess what we see we confess what we believe Hallelujah am mean oh that's just denying circumstances no it's not it's confessing it's confessing the word I mean you may be sick but say by Stripes I'm Healed things may be going wrong but you may say he's my heavenly father he's my bridegroom he's my counselor he he has all things in control amen you see you you may see the family go Wayward but you say but the scripture says them and their seed will be there amen that's what you should confess amen are there are there's not Harmony in the home the peace that I give you not as the world gives amen you confess that don't never look at the symptoms look at the cause of the symptoms amen and it should always be well what's the cause it's not my sibling or my spouse it's the enemy amen remember the enemy is never one another never one another oh that person said this this person did this no no no no no no no no no no you got it all wrong amen it's the devil amen than you Lord because people really what they know amen and then you know you know why do I why do I preach what I'm preaching today well it's because some I was reading some things and some thoughts came into my mind and on my heart and now I put them on paper why do people respond to you certain ways because thoughts come in their mind and then they speak what they think is actually correct amen that's why you've got to take your thoughts and and and make sure they're subject to the word because the devil will give you a whole bunch of misinformation but you should take that shred it burn it throw it away and then and then speak the real stuff amen so we have come to an innumerable company of angels and so we are not alone in this walk I trust you have come to that realization God is here amen yo if Jesus says I will be with you even in you I that's a person and it's not speaking of just a little bit of me or maybe I just you know like people you know you know there's tragedies happen in the world and people say my thoughts are with you and my you know that's that's that's so cheap but he says I'll be with you I the person so everything he was when he was here in the days of his flesh he says I that same person will be with you Amen to everything remember all he was a he was the fullness of the godhead bod was in a man amen so everything God was he was walking in flesh and he says I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come to you in a little while the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me and in that day you shall know I am in the father I in you and you and me amen you would recognize that God is with you so therefore I and he also said we're two or three gathered in my name and that's not just saying the name of Jesus Christ I mean that's gathering around the truth of his word cuz he is his word and we've not just been called by his name I mean we've been we've been baptized in his name we've been named amen amen you understand what I'm saying we are gathered in his name because we've taken on his name amen and because we have the truth of his word so if he says where two or three are gathered there I am in the midst I can say everything Heaven is this is not just oh you're trying to say something to excite you it's real everything Heaven is is is right here everything Heaven is is with you in your home am mean if you and your spouse of Believers we're two or three gathered doesn't say on a Sunday morning or on a Wednesday or whenever you'd have a meeting where two or three are gathered there I am there I am in the midst so all healing is here all Deliverance is here all peace is here whatever to break whatever complex or whatever Deep thing that may be there the Physicians here hallelujah everything that heaven is is in this room right now amen I just this is what this says cuz there I'll be in the midst amen everything he is remember he's not he's not a part of God he is God Amen he's the full revelation of Jes you of God himself so everything God is is here creative power is here amen everything you have need of is in this room amen amen hallelujah just think about that oh if I just Touch the Hem of His Garment and he's here if I could just talk to him and he's here I have so many questions but he's here I don't know which way to go but he's here I got so I don't know which path to take he's here I have the sickness he's here amen I have this lingering thing I just can't get rid of and he's here hallelujah friends there I am in the midst what does that mean he's between you and me he's between you and the person next to you Hallelujah I he's far away up in heaven oh no no no no no no no he's not just up in heaven he's with you he's right here you got to recognize you brother had the experience the burden uh you I think it was a burden LIF and and God told him the never remember he said the never failing presence of Jesus Christ will be with you always amen and what is that the scripture I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee hallelujah amen amen now so this is so we there's a lot more for us than against us amen I'm not talking about just number of physical Believers that are alive there's a lot more for us than against us amen and even one will chase a thousand how about I just stop do you recognize what you have amen you got to recognize what the power that you have in you if the very creator of heavens and earth is in you but you see this mind you know the devil comes along he beats you down you get discouraged amen and you feel like you're going to well what you why did I just give up what is that going to do amen it's either slavery or total freedom amen which one do you want well I just feel so dis yeah I don't think I can make it you're not the one who's holding on god holds on to you remember I have desired Zion as my habitation amen amen he's desired it and his will is supreme above everything amen hallelujah amen you know and then you know the Devil comes along I'm just yeah I'm just going to jump to this this is an interview with sister Bruce who's heard this okay I'm just going to read this now and I'll maybe jump back now so he's having an interview with his sister and she's not feeling well I prayed constantly God wouldn't let you die cuz you're value to the church now I know you I know you're going to be all right sister Bruce I believe that with all my heart I believe with all my heart you're a real Born Again believer now Sister Bruce has come to brother Brown because she says um her words aren't aren't in this transcript but you listen to it she says but there's I just can't put my foot on the place where I know that I know that I met him okay and so she's come to brother bam Lord you know can you know the Lord will give you a vision and show me what's going on now but look at this I believe with all my heart you're a real Born Again believer sister Bruce um how he says when you get sick you get weary who gets weary yeah you're a nervous type person who's a nervous type person nothing wrong with that and you get things on your mind who gets things on their mind everyone gets things on their mind okay little bitty things I'll just keep my hand up if you uh it just keeps building up both ways yeah yeah you'll get someone on your heart you want to pray for them get up and pray for them you can't rest till you get that person prayed for yeah that's you Hallelujah then take it on the other side Satan might present something that you see you know uh uh and not this way see so he's saying that Satan might present something to you and you just can't shake the thing and it you know so he's saying that you're a nervous type person and you get things on your mind little bitty things and they just build yeah but God uses that when a burden comes for prayer but then Satan uses that against to to things to build and build and build and build and she cuz she's a nervous type person and that uses her to get get weary and worn out see God God doesn't matter what nature you have God will use it Satan will use it against you but you got to recognize when it's Satan working against you and God working for you Hallelujah now you're a nature and God works and Satan Works remember brother Bram saying sister Bruce I believe you're real Born Again believer so this is someone who's got the Holy Ghost you understand this is someone who's got the Holy Ghost now and God works and Satan works then when Satan tries to make you believe that you're not see you keep building this yeah so Satan will come along oh you don't have the Holy Ghost or you're weary and this is why you're weary and this is how things are and it just builds builds builds builds builds Hallelujah that's me see maybe this is right but don't look at yourself sister Bruce remember I'm fixing to pray for you I'm not worthy of that I think what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here now and well what would he do if he was sitting here he would lay his hands upon you and with his great faith see you'd get well well now I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him see must remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ blood and it's not Christ that's talking through to uh through us to God I mean I mean sorry and it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christians I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman I remember the thing that's what why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be alloted to you see he took your mistakes your desire is to serve him I'm just so glad he just goes to the a prophet just goes to the source your desire is to serve him all right that's what he died for so that you could serve him see your mistakes are not looked not a looted to you see he is your propitiation see remember if if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us the scripture tells us amen you're not a sinner see he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins became you because your desire is to serve him Hallelujah all right notice this ordinary human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being that was your nature natur it changed once but what changed it and she says you can hear on tape Christ and then he says there you are sister see that's it he that Hearth my words and believeth on that sent me eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment but is p ha past tense passed from Death To Life St John 5:24 Jesus speaking see you're not um you're a Christian sister Bruce I've watched your life I've watched you under Vision I know you're a Christian see not one spe amen he see he says I know you're a real believer but you see the enemy will work against you a certain way and God will work a certain way amen and you've got to you've got to look at now what is it producing what is your thought pattern producing does it produce peace does it produce greater love for God does it produce a closer relationship sh with your family does it create a better relationship with your brothers and sisters amen is that what your thought pattern produces does it you know does it produce a you know a closer walk to God or does it produce a separation from your family amen a selfishness amen a you know well you know a no real desire to serve the Lord anymore I mean what does it produce what is the root of bitterness a thought comes in amen and it and it begins to grow and what happens is that person becomes bitter I mean why because a thought is received and it begins to grow and so a person's thought pattern because of maybe what happened to them now causes them to become bitter amen he says do not let a root of bitterness grow in you because the devil will try and make you bitter about something amen but Jesus being our our example he just said father forgive them they don't know what they do I think I said maybe last Sunday Sunday before they knew what they were but if you look at what they're doing they planned what they did they it calculated it was planned and it was executed so we would actually think they knew what they were doing but Jesus recognized if they really knew that I was the Prince of Life they would never have crucified me like Paul said amen so you got to think about it someone something comes against you or you know maybe out or in the family whoever it is something comes against you there's a misunderstanding all kinds of things you've just got to really recognize you got to look Beyond and just say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing amen because if there's unforgiveness it only really affects you it doesn't affect the other person it's you amen I'll read this as well this is this is from the uniting time in sign is brother Brenham we're going down in um uh we're going down in Kentucky I just happened to come in that day that Mrs Weaver died and it just ride help brother Neville in that the funeral uh I do not try to say too much about it you know around people complaining around people complaining cuz I think one of the most horriblest things is to see a man or a woman that's constantly complaining I always thought God keep me from it see that weakens Faith all the time you know amen complain so he's saying complaining weakens your faith look at look at look at Israel going through the Wilderness they begin to murmur and complain and then when they came to Kadesh B they said we can't take the land why because it weakened the the the complaining of their situation weaken their faith oh if we could look beyond what we see amen that's why you don't you don't confess what you see don't even take it into account take his word into account amen and hold on to the word whatever situation you're in I always thought God keep me from it see that weakens Faith all the time you know um he says I know as you get older each people of us we're going to get something happened and something happened and I know those little things are going to keep accumulating that's as you get older they just got to but I think one of the most horrible things is for Satan to Crown some person's life as a crabbed old man or old woman you see this is what he wants to make you he wants to Crown your life as a crab dog man or he say one of the most horrible things and he says I hope I don't get to I I hope I don't get to that place I hope that I can bear it as my burdens and get to a spot where I want my life crowned with the glory of God his longsuffering gentleness peace meekness and filled with the Holy Spirit one of my main things that always hurt through my life has been a nervous condition I'm so glad the prophet was real amen that when I get so worn then I get real weary I get kind of feeling like nobody cares for you I'll just put both hands up you know and we're all we you have it too I just happen to real overdose of it you know and now it gets real bad sometime and I can't hardly it's tension and that's what does it and I get to a spot then that many times especially so many of those Visions you see it just gets me I look at a person I think this is a vision no no no yes is it or not not you see and you just don't realize what price goes with that so then you wonder then you get to thinking well you're then you get off your side and think well now what have I done here I'm 50 years old and I've done nothing for the Lord I'm getting old and oh my then you just get in what we call we used to call the blues some of you Brethren about my age remember what they used to call uh have the Blues pop used to talk about it and I wondered what he meant and I sure know now what he meant so then you get to feeling that way which is none of it true it's just you and you know it see you know it's you doing that why because it's your nature being used against you amen so you've got to you know don't let whatever you do remember we come to Mount Zion we've come to a unable company of angels amen we've come to the Living God so don't let don't let Natural Things of life you know don't let Natural Things of Life allow you to be crowned as a crabby old man or old woman amen because the way you go is the way you end up amen so things so you may begin to act a certain way but then when you get older it just gets greater whether you like it or not amen remember we have a promise that this this this guy has to be will be under subjection to the life that's within you amen amen that the Living God will take this flesh under subjection amen if you allow him we have that promise and so we have come to a place where the Eternal God Is With Us yeah that's what we read you have come to Mount Zion the living living wait let's you know into a numerable company of angels to the Heavenly Jerusalem amen and then and then as I said now that that word innumerable it means know it means a myriad a great number and so that is the same number as the 100,000,000 demons that are released out of the river Euphrates amen and we know that demon power has been released Amen in this end time as Revelations 9:1 and and that star fell from heaven which was Satan himself he fell and as I said you know when someone Falls it's because they've been pushed you know so they don't have any say they've just been pushed amen so he fell and then now as you read that he you it says that that that you know those demons were released and it says one W was passed and two come Hereafter and in the Bible a war is a World War amen so after World War 4 One what happens is now the Pit's open all this demon power comes upon the Earth and you can see it manifested amen because there's always a oh you say society's changed why has Society changed amen what is influencing the world that is different to what it was amen it's because there's more demon power loosed amen but as I said before there's more for us than against us amen and and as Elish I think Elisha or Elijah I can't remember when the syrians came to come get him and then his servant went out and saw the Syrian Army there and he prayed Lord open the open the boy's eyes and his eyes became open and there all the Flaming chariots and angels of the Lord all around now that didn't cause the angels to suddenly turn up they were already there they were already there but his eyes had to come open for him to recognize I'm not alone in this battle actually there's heaps more for us and against us Hallelujah you got to recognize that am mean that's why it says you've come to an innumerable company of angels and remember one will chase a thousand oh that's physical no no no no no no no that's actually spiritual now it was a natural enemy in the Old Testament but now it's a spiritual enemy that's why Paul says we don't wrestle against flesh and blood we're against principalities powers and wickedness in high places it says one will chase a th two 10,000 I'd like someone to do the one time Hallelujah that's a lot amen someone do the math sometime please but you see there's more for us and against us friends oh the world is so dark no to me it's so bright it's never been a day like this day where God has descended in such a way and lifted us up into Heavenly places Hallelujah so now we are here we have come to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven amen and so this is speaking now that that these ones that have come to Zion that they are written on the Lamb's Book of Life written in heaven amen and and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just being made perfect now many times we think of a judge as something negative but in reality a judge is a judgment is a positive thing because it's the same thing now when you know you know when that woman caught in adultery says she was caught in the very act you know the scribes and Pharisees dragged her before Jesus you know where was the man cuz the law said both had to come but they just brought the woman and then now here was the judge here was the Supreme judge standing upon the Earth the one who gave the law was standing in flesh and actually you know she uh you know he begin to ride in the sand because they were wanting to see what he would do he begins to ride in the sand he says let him that is without sin Let Him cast the first stone and they're all convicted of their own conscience they dropped their Stones they left and then now she said to her woman's accus and she says there's none Lord yeah read it called her he she called him Lord which wasn't just a sir she was saying God there's none Supreme capital l d That's the Supreme one amen she was dragged in front of the judge I you I trust you see what I'm saying she was dragged in front of the judge and that caused her to recognize this is more than a man amen this is more than a Prophet this is God in flesh amen and then so she was dragged in front of the Supreme judge and she and she was pardoned hallelujah amen so we think of a judge many times as just well there's a there's a sentence passed down the person's thrown in jail now there has to come a time where the bride is judged righteous amen where the you you brother tells a story that that that our judge became our attorney amen became our lawyer so the very judge the one that Wasing out case Hallelujah and the man Jesus Christ so here comes the judge but then comes our attorney and the case is thrown out Hallelujah you know really in reality can I just I'll just say it this way forgive me if this sounds wrong but God if you take it in a legal system he he he tampers with evidence he destroys evidence he's a crooked judge Hallelujah you know if you think about it because the devil says well I made them do this and I gave them this perverted birth and they had this Fallen nature and they did this and this and this with it out of their free will but then God says where is it show me where it is where did they do that oh but it was and and then the devil tries to find the file and the file's gone amen because of the blood of Jesus Christ When sin is confessed it falls into his blood amen falls into the bleach the prophet says and it and it's broken down but not only broken down because sin has to be destroyed so it goes on the head of the accuser amen and on that great day when he comes before the throne what you did in your flesh before you are forgiven he's actually held accountable because it was not actually your fault you were trapped into this body amen this Fallen body you didn't choose to come this way he made you come this way so he'll stand there you know just think Jesus Took the sins of the world up Calvary Hallelujah and then now here comes another being I'll say you know you this is just me just in Fellowship but you know to me now here comes another being with the sins of the world upon him and it's a judgment and it's on the and Satan can't get it off him hallelujah amen why you carrying all this Satan oh they did it no you did it amen why because the judge has judged you righteous Hallelujah the judge has actually said no you're pardoned Hallelujah am so now and to the spirits of just men made perfect now notice he doesn't say the bodies he says the spirits of just men he's not talking about this flesh now these bodies have to be changed but if there's a judgment now that you are righteous as God is righteous that means You' being made perfect Hallelujah there's a there's a sinless Perfection that not not that you have to achieve it you already have it hallelujah amen there's nothing holding me here oh but I feel weary and I feel down no no no no no no no don't bring that how you feel has nothing to do with your salvation faith and feelings are actually conflicting many many times amen and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling which speaketh better things than that of Abel now the mediator this mediator also speaks like a like an attorney or someone who gives out a will yeah so now Jesus so Jesus is the media the New Covenant so what he is now is he is the one so so he died he died for a you know this is this is a inheritance yeah but but if but if the person who has the inheritance is alive then the inheritance can't be given out normally it never happens so the person has to die and then he dies and then the contents of the will is given out amen so Jesus died not for himself but for you but then he rose again to ensure what he died for was given out out amen so now he is the mediator of the New Covenant so now he is now enforcing now what he died for so so for example you take Natural person just say if one of my you know just say if I had someone who was on life support but in his will was on life support you know he had given me a house okay so he dies yeah and now I get the house but it's actually not the guy who dies that makes sure I get the house it's the lawyer someone who actually has the qualifications to do it yep but Jesus didn't just die he rose again and he had because he's our attorney he's our lawyer he makes sure what he died that you would receive you would receive it Hallelujah you understand so that's why one day you're bumbling along maybe you just grew up in church doesn't matter one day you're walking in darkness but he hadn't his will to brother Santo sister Santo I have given the Rapture I've given dominion over sin I have cleared the charges Hallelujah they're going to be like me made in my image Lord and the likeness that that they will know me in the power of my resurrection and the likeness of my sufferings they will know peace that passes all understanding they joy and speakable and full of Glory they will know me as I am and they shall know as they are known amen they will walk with me like very few have walked with me they will walk with the Apostles of trod they will know the power of blood and they will know that is cleansing power they will know that I'm the same yesterday today and forever they will know my very mind amen they will know the secrets that in the back part of my mind they will know amen they'll know that they came from me and went back to me Hallelujah they'll know that I've taken the book and open the seals and given them their Redemption amen and they will know that this that Satan is cast down and they are lifted up and whatever else is there and so he ensured and then that's why he comes your way amen and this word this message came across your path that you would recognize this is what he died for Hallelujah you know this is not just taking on some mental Doctrine it sounds good and it makes sense no this is not what this message is about this is about calling people whose names are in the book am mean that they would know their inheritance Hallelujah that why that is why we have this message because God God took a prophet a proven Prophet a validated Prophet put him upon the Earth and said tell them the contents of the Willen hallelujah amen and it actually it wasn't brother Braham doing it he says I wanted to be a Trapper I never wanted this but God had to use a channel to speak it Hallelujah so that's why now he's the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel now Abel's blood all it could do was cry out for Revenge cry out for justice that's all it could do I mean here is a righteous man who has made you know he knew it was blood in the garden but his blood all it could do was cry out for you know cry out for justice but the blood of Jesus Christ speaks speaks far greater things than that because it doesn't just it doesn't speak out that way it speaks out of mercy and forgiveness and cleansing power amen and that's why had that there about sister Bruce because God doesn't see you amen that's why he told her it's he doesn't see you he sees his blood am mean he sees the atonement he doesn't see you and as I've said probably many times when you in the Old Testament here comes a man with a lamb and he's taking it as a sin offering as soon as that priest sees sees the man and the lamb he doesn't look at the man he says he says you go over there I need to inspect this and then he insects the lamb he doesn't expect the man he doesn't ask him some questions doesn't ask how he was and what he did and why he's here and what happened he looks at the lamb and then he looks at the lamb and then he thoroughly says once it's fine now I can offer the lamb Hallelujah God doesn't look at you the devil wants you to think that he looks at you he doesn't look at you he looks at the lamb that's why God said job was perfect because job offered the lamb and God accepted the lamb because God gave the lamb to be given amen that's why God doesn't look at you he looks at the lamb that you present which is Christ the word you understand amen and God doesn't look at you in your condition he looks at that lamb Hallelujah that's why Jesus when he arose he said to Mary don't touch me I haven't me I haven't ascended yet and he rose up and he was accepted he came back down and said Thomas they said handle me touch me put your hand in my side and feel the nail holes in my hands cuz he was accepted you understand it's not you being accepted because he has accepted you're accepted because he now you understand what I saying because he is is accepted you're accepted amen because he is not because oh I need to be you know it says we're accepted in the Beloved I think it says in Ephesians 1 because you're accepted in him because you've received him amen oh what about me just get into him cuz he has been received you understand hallelujah amen now I'll just I'm just going to close with a quote he says this so I can find it if I can't find it Well that's fine actually I can't find this oh it's right but he says now he says the blood of Jesus it cries out forgiveness and it gives pardon amen so when you really accept Christ God only sees the sacrifice that's why that's why I remember when brother baram he went into that um you it wasn't a bar your your your whatever it was and there were there was this old woman there and she was gambling things with theeman and and and um you know and they were smoking and she you know she's an old grandmother but she's trying to dress like she's 20 and he in his heart condemned woman you know she should know better and blah blah blah blah but then but then brother Braham had a vision now of the earth and there's a there blood barrier over the Earth sin like a dark streak would come off the Earth and it and and Jesus was hanging on the cross and it and it and it struck struck Jesus so it couldn't actually get to the throne of God Amen and so he began to see now that even even his sins did that because he's our barrier amen he's the one who who who stands in the gap for us amen and so he began to realize now you know that that because that is there for him as well and then his whole attitude changed towards the woman and then she spoke to him her to Christ right there amen and I say that all because he recognized there is a barrier amen there is a there is a blood barrier it's not it's not chemical blood you understand but there's a barrier amen that when you speak to God he doesn't see you he sees the he sees the offering in your place Hallelujah CU this is where we've come this is where we've come you know brother BR says in the church age book it's not works and the blood am mean salvation is not works and and the blood It Is by it is by the offering only am you're saved by grace remember works are just what you do because you love him and if it's out of love it's not works you understand because you're motivated by love amen so if you're motivated by love you just do it amen you it's like husband and wife why do you do things for each other because you're motivated by love amen and it's not well I did now you have to do this and I did this last week why you do it this week that's not how it works You're motivated by love amen it's the same thing you you know you live the Lord because you're motivated by love hallelujah amen let's just stand to our feet shall we we've come to a glorious Place hallelujah it's all his doing amen we have some musicians hallelujah amen do you love the Lord this morning amen amen isn't he good hallelujah amen let's um let's sing um I want want to sing um can we can we sing living you love me do you
