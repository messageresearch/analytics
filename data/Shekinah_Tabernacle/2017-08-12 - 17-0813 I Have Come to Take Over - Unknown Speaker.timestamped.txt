[54:50] consumed and Moses said I'll now turn
[54:53] aside and see this great sight why the
[54:55] bush is not burnt and when and when the
[54:58] Lord saw that he turned aside to see God
[55:01] called unto him out of the midst of the
[55:03] bush and said Moses Moses and he said
[55:06] here am I and he said draw not nigh
[55:08] Heather put off thy shoes from off thy
[55:11] feet for the place wherein thou standest
[55:13] is holy ground moreover he said I'm the
[55:16] law I am the God of thy father the God
[55:19] of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of
[55:21] Jacob and Moses had his face for his
[55:24] afraid to look upon God and the Lord
[55:26] said I have surely seen the affliction
[55:29] of my people which are in Egypt and have
[55:32] heard their cry by reason of their
[55:34] taskmasters for I know their sorrows and
[55:36] I am come down to deliver them out of
[55:39] the hand of the Egyptians and to bring
[55:42] them up out of that land
[55:43] to a good land and a large unto a land
[55:46] flowing with milk and with honey and to
[55:48] the place of the Canaanites and the
[55:49] Hittites and the Emirates the pigeon
[55:51] sites and the high bites and the
[55:52] jebusites that therefore behold the cry
[55:56] of the children of Israel has come unto
[55:57] me and I have also seen the oppression
[56:00] wherewith the Egyptians oppress them
[56:02] come now therefore and I will send thee
[56:05] unto Pharaoh that thou may us bring
[56:07] forth my people the children of Israel
[56:09] out of Egypt they mean to notice the
[56:14] angel of the Lord spoke to him out of
[56:17] the out of the burning bush just as
[56:20] we're turning to Colossians chapter one
[56:23] and he tells he tells Moses I have come
[56:28] down I'm sending you Colossians 1 and 12
[56:33] a read verse down to verse 21
[56:44] giving thanks unto the Father which has
[56:48] made us meet to be partakers the
[56:51] inheritance of the Saints and light who
[56:53] had delivered us from the power of
[56:54] darkness and hath translated us into the
[56:57] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[56:59] redemption through his blood even the
[57:01] forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[57:05] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[57:07] creature for by him all things created
[57:10] that are in heaven and that are on earth
[57:12] visible and invisible whether they be
[57:14] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[57:15] or powers all things were created by him
[57:19] and for him and he is before all things
[57:22] and by him all things consist and he is
[57:24] now notice his position he is the head
[57:26] of the body the church who is the
[57:28] beginning he was the beginning the
[57:30] firstborn from the dead that in all
[57:33] things he might have the preeminence for
[57:35] it pleased the father that in him should
[57:37] awful list well and having made peace
[57:40] through the cross through the blood of
[57:42] his cross by him to reconcile all things
[57:44] unto himself by him I say whether they
[57:47] be things in the earth or things in
[57:49] heaven and you who were sometime
[57:51] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[57:54] wicked works hath yet now had he
[57:58] reconciled amen
[58:01] may Lord bless us would you may have
[58:03] your seats this morning you take Moses
[58:12] here and we're to go through a few a few
[58:16] Bible characters and bring it on down to
[58:18] our present day because we know that God
[58:20] repeats himself you know there's a
[58:23] pattern laid out in the scripture if we
[58:25] can catch what he did before we can see
[58:27] what he's doing today and so as I said
[58:30] the my title this morning is I have come
[58:32] to take over and God now we see in we
[58:36] see in Exodus chapter 3 here that God
[58:41] came down and spoke to Moses in the
[58:43] burning bush and it says the angel of
[58:46] the Lord came and spoke to him there now
[58:49] when the when God comes in angelic form
[58:52] in this way there is a there is a change
[58:54] taking place where there is a
[58:57] people who were in slavery in the
[58:59] sisters they were in physical slavery
[59:01] they are in bondage in Egypt then God
[59:04] came down he said to prophet and he he
[59:07] came down and he will ship them to that
[59:09] prophet and he delivered his people
[59:11] and he was making a declaration Pharaoh
[59:14] these people are not yours they do not
[59:16] belong to you this is not their portion
[59:19] in life but I have come down you are not
[59:22] there you are not in charge of them I
[59:24] have come down to take over I have come
[59:27] to take dominion over my people I have
[59:29] come together than to myself I'm going
[59:32] to take them to their inheritance and
[59:33] this is what's going to happen and if
[59:35] you read the rest of Exodus you you find
[59:37] out that's exactly what happened yeah it
[59:39] doesn't matter what Pharaoh tried to do
[59:42] in the hardening of us heart in the and
[59:44] the rejection of what God declared he
[59:46] was doing in that season God still
[59:48] bulldoze through hallelujah God still
[59:50] had his way and so now he took over then
[59:54] they were once they were a bunch of
[59:55] slaves but then it was a few days after
[59:58] after this they were a people they they
[1:00:01] had an approach to God they could
[1:00:04] worship Him in spirit and truth and in
[1:00:06] that day they meant they were a nation
[1:00:08] under God so God was their head
[1:00:11] hallelujah witness like when when Samuel
[1:00:14] you know when the people came to Samuel
[1:00:16] there's a few generations down after
[1:00:18] this instance where where they said to
[1:00:21] Samuel you know we want a king and
[1:00:22] Samuel was very grief and he went to God
[1:00:25] and and God said to Samuel they haven't
[1:00:27] rejected you they have rejected me so
[1:00:29] they they they took human leadership
[1:00:32] over God's leadership but now so we are
[1:00:38] living in a time now we read in
[1:00:40] inclusions 1 there that you know that
[1:00:43] you're that portion of Scripture and
[1:00:44] brother bran would take Colossians
[1:00:46] chapter 1 and he would preach a sermon
[1:00:48] called crisis of mystery of God revealed
[1:00:50] and to me it's not a sermon it's a
[1:00:53] declaration he's he's telling you this
[1:00:56] is this is who Christ is and he has a
[1:00:59] three-fold plan and you're part of that
[1:01:01] plan amen
[1:01:03] and so now and part of that plan is that
[1:01:06] he would have preeminence over people so
[1:01:09] he has come now we understand
[1:01:11] in this day and age or since the fall in
[1:01:13] the garden that man has been under the
[1:01:16] Dominion of sin man has been under the
[1:01:19] Dominion of the devil we we were once
[1:01:21] Adam and Eve were gods of the earth but
[1:01:24] they forfeited their God ship amen
[1:01:26] through because of deceit but Adam knew
[1:01:29] exactly what he was doing he tried to
[1:01:30] redeem his wife he went with his eyes
[1:01:32] open she was deceived he was not
[1:01:34] deceived but they both fell in the
[1:01:36] transgression and so what happened is
[1:01:38] when after after our God Adam and Eve
[1:01:41] were god of the earth they forfeited
[1:01:43] their their right of that position and
[1:01:45] they felt and so Satan became the god of
[1:01:47] this of this world and that's why we
[1:01:50] have the famines and the storms and the
[1:01:52] sickness and all these things is because
[1:01:54] another agency came in and took over but
[1:01:57] God would not be defeated Amen he's
[1:02:01] determined now because he allowed the
[1:02:03] fall in order to express himself in his
[1:02:05] fullness we understand these things
[1:02:07] before before the fall he could never
[1:02:10] reveal himself as a healer because
[1:02:12] nothing was sick he could never reveal
[1:02:14] himself as Redeemer
[1:02:15] because nothing needed redeeming I mean
[1:02:17] he couldn't reveal himself as as a guide
[1:02:20] or an advocate amen because nothing was
[1:02:22] lost that needed guiding Amen or help
[1:02:26] were a comforter nothing needed
[1:02:27] comforting Adam and Eve didn't need
[1:02:29] comforting before the fall everything
[1:02:30] was going real good
[1:02:32] amen and so so he allowed it to happen
[1:02:35] to fully express himself because we have
[1:02:38] to understand oh I trust you know
[1:02:40] already that when when we gather around
[1:02:44] the throne there and you on the Book of
[1:02:46] Revelations it says that thou has
[1:02:47] redeemed us back to God out of every
[1:02:49] kindred nation and tongue when the lamb
[1:02:51] takes the book and we're in that scene
[1:02:53] we're in that scene and so that could
[1:02:57] never be lived out unless there had to
[1:02:59] be a Redemption Amen so in reality you
[1:03:02] say well I'm going through a lot of
[1:03:04] hardship in life God's doing you yo
[1:03:07] Satan's actually doing you a favor
[1:03:09] because the trial is coming that God
[1:03:11] could reveal himself to you then you can
[1:03:13] have greater confidence God if he
[1:03:15] brought me out of this thing you bring
[1:03:16] me out of that Holy have you gotten me
[1:03:18] through this trial you got me through
[1:03:20] this trial amen so now he came down God
[1:03:25] came down it wasn't Moses that was
[1:03:27] invading Egypt to get his people out it
[1:03:29] was it was God in Moses Moses had
[1:03:32] ambition member he was his parents
[1:03:34] believe by faith that he was going to be
[1:03:36] the deliverer they they believed it
[1:03:39] because they were praying they were
[1:03:41] seeking Lord it's been 400 years or
[1:03:43] whatever nearly 400 is you said you're
[1:03:45] sinned you send your sender deliverer
[1:03:47] and we're in slavery here
[1:03:48] come on fulfill your work they had a
[1:03:50] burden and then they had the son and
[1:03:53] they believed he was going to be him and
[1:03:55] they and you know the rest of the story
[1:03:57] you know his mother puts him in a in an
[1:04:00] arc you know in a basket that's that's
[1:04:02] watertight sends him down the Nile and
[1:04:04] he just happens to end up there and
[1:04:06] Pharaoh's daughters palace or wherever
[1:04:09] she's bathing you know and God ordained
[1:04:11] that to happen and then then God allowed
[1:04:14] it that his Moses mother actually was as
[1:04:16] witness and raised him now do you think
[1:04:19] do you think that Moses mother wouldn't
[1:04:21] have said anything to Moses as as she's
[1:04:25] raising him by faith she she sent him
[1:04:29] into the nut now I believe God will take
[1:04:32] care of this one I don't know how it's
[1:04:34] going to happen but it's going to happen
[1:04:36] and then so do you think she would have
[1:04:38] sit still no she would have poured it in
[1:04:41] you gonna deliver our people God's will
[1:04:44] danger to this job amen God's gonna come
[1:04:47] he's going to use you he promised our
[1:04:49] father Abraham I'm in that four hundred
[1:04:52] years and we're going to come out of
[1:04:54] this place we're being afflicted we're
[1:04:56] going to come out with a mighty hand and
[1:04:57] God always uses man hallelujah God
[1:05:00] always uses man and so she would have
[1:05:02] been telling him these things and he
[1:05:04] would have had an ambition I'm gonna
[1:05:06] deliver these people but the thing is
[1:05:08] they ambushed them without God is human
[1:05:10] ambition and human ambition always fails
[1:05:12] Amen you know if you have your own if
[1:05:15] you have your own desire I'm gonna do
[1:05:17] something I'm going to sort this out I'm
[1:05:18] gonna you know make these things work
[1:05:20] out just right if it's your own ambition
[1:05:22] it'll fail amen so Moses now he had to
[1:05:26] in order for God to come down and take
[1:05:29] over Moses had to become a prisoner
[1:05:32] Moses all of us forty years raised up in
[1:05:36] Pharaoh's Palace and all the military
[1:05:38] training and maybe
[1:05:39] battles he fought us because the royalty
[1:05:41] member in those days they were in charge
[1:05:43] of the army so he would have been the
[1:05:45] prince in charge of the army you know
[1:05:46] whatever campaigns they fought and
[1:05:48] whatever more that all had to come out
[1:05:50] of him
[1:05:51] that'll that all had to come out of him
[1:05:53] and that's why he spent forty more years
[1:05:56] on the backside of the desert imagine
[1:05:59] here's a guy he was he he he could have
[1:06:02] been the next Pharaoh living in a big
[1:06:05] massive Palace all these servants under
[1:06:08] him and then a few maybe a day or two
[1:06:11] after this he's on the desert he's on
[1:06:13] the road and then after having this big
[1:06:15] thing to look after all this government
[1:06:17] and there's all the politics and the and
[1:06:19] the palace and all the things going on
[1:06:21] in court and then maybe a few years down
[1:06:23] the road here he is he's got a bunch of
[1:06:25] sheep he's looking for water
[1:06:27] and he's having hardship on the backside
[1:06:29] of the desert and maybe he's hungry he
[1:06:31] was never hungry back there he could
[1:06:33] have just gone like this and the nicest
[1:06:35] meal could have come out you he he
[1:06:37] really didn't have a natural need here
[1:06:39] he isn't a tent and he's got a hot
[1:06:41] tempered wife all these things are going
[1:06:43] on Moses had to come out of Moses in
[1:06:47] order for God to come and take over now
[1:06:49] I'm gonna jump way to the end of my
[1:06:51] sermon that same God that came down and
[1:06:53] spoke to Moses comes down and dwells in
[1:06:55] you I mean because he's got to take on
[1:06:58] your human battle he's got to come and
[1:07:00] dwell in your life I mean that same
[1:07:02] angel of the Covenant I approved by the
[1:07:03] scripture comes and dwells in you
[1:07:05] Alleluia so now Moses had to God had to
[1:07:09] take Moses out of Moses and then he
[1:07:11] could use them
[1:07:12] brother Brown says and Paul a prisoner
[1:07:14] of Christ and 63 he says see see he
[1:07:20] became a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:07:24] he's his friends if we could only become
[1:07:26] prisoners he says I'd like to name a few
[1:07:29] characters here Moses he was born a
[1:07:31] deliverer and he knew that he was born a
[1:07:33] deliverer but before I say about Moses
[1:07:36] I'd like to try to make this statement
[1:07:38] God always has to take any man that will
[1:07:41] serve Him truly I say all woman to be
[1:07:44] his prisoner
[1:07:45] a man has to surrender every ambition
[1:07:47] he's got everything that he is
[1:07:49] everything his life has sold
[1:07:52] his body his will his ambitions
[1:07:54] everything else and become a complete a
[1:07:58] prisoner to Christ who is the word to
[1:08:00] serve God you might have to walk
[1:08:02] contrary to your better judgment maybe
[1:08:06] in a certain organization you might
[1:08:07] think that you could lift they could
[1:08:10] lift you up and give you something great
[1:08:11] that you might flesh but what deep but
[1:08:16] what do you find yourself you find
[1:08:18] yourself defeated after a while until
[1:08:20] God can get a man that's willing to
[1:08:22] become a prisoner to him God is looking
[1:08:25] for prisoners he's always done it you
[1:08:27] might search it through the scripture a
[1:08:29] man has to be a prisoner to Christ
[1:08:31] against anything therefore you cannot be
[1:08:34] connected with anything but Christ even
[1:08:37] your family your mother your brother
[1:08:38] your sister your husband your wife
[1:08:39] anybody you only connect them with
[1:08:42] Christ and him only then God can use you
[1:08:46] I mean then God can use you until then
[1:08:51] you can't going out sometimes I speak
[1:08:55] rough to people I'm trying to get see
[1:08:57] I'm trying to get you to cut loose
[1:08:58] you've got to have a starting place like
[1:09:01] I sometimes call about women bobbing
[1:09:03] they're here wearing these clothes
[1:09:04] holding maintaining their Christian
[1:09:05] profession you say that's a little thing
[1:09:07] well you've got to start somewhere so
[1:09:09] begin right there in your a BCC and cut
[1:09:12] loose from worldly looks anyhow and
[1:09:14] become a present of Christ and then just
[1:09:17] keep on cutting loose till finally the
[1:09:20] last lines cut loose then you're a
[1:09:22] prisoner then you've become Anna's grip
[1:09:25] you've got to get in his grip remember
[1:09:28] Satan gets people in the in his grip by
[1:09:30] deceit right by trickery but you have to
[1:09:33] consciously allow yourself to be placed
[1:09:36] in God's grip because he's a gentleman
[1:09:38] he does not enforce anything upon you he
[1:09:40] doesn't squeeze you through a pipe and
[1:09:42] cause you to overcome or or or cause you
[1:09:44] to become a believer
[1:09:45] it's his invitation and your acceptance
[1:09:48] of that invitation amen
[1:09:51] now Moses note he is born a deliverer he
[1:09:54] knew that and did you notice what the
[1:09:56] ambition that Moses had knowing that his
[1:09:59] mother had told him over there
[1:10:01] she was his nursemaid no doubt when
[1:10:03] Moses the little boy was born his mother
[1:10:05] said you know
[1:10:06] Moses when you're dead mm and I prayed
[1:10:08] constantly we noticed seen in the word
[1:10:11] it was time for the coming of a
[1:10:12] deliverer and we prayed Lord God we want
[1:10:15] to see that deliverer one night the Lord
[1:10:17] told us in a vision that you'd be born
[1:10:19] and you'd be the deliverer we wasn't
[1:10:21] afraid of the Kings commandment we
[1:10:23] didn't care what the king said then we
[1:10:25] know that you were born a deliverer now
[1:10:27] Moses we know that you couldn't that we
[1:10:33] couldn't bring you up right remember
[1:10:34] they'd been down there for hundred years
[1:10:36] in Egypt see and we wanted to get the
[1:10:38] right thing the right education the
[1:10:40] right training so I took you put you in
[1:10:42] a little arc and set you out into the
[1:10:44] Nile and I strained at the current
[1:10:46] taking that little light down through
[1:10:48] the reeds and rushes and brought it down
[1:10:50] miles away and turned it right into
[1:10:52] Pharaoh's Palace and his and Pharaoh's
[1:10:54] daughter was a no bathing pool and I'd
[1:10:57] note she would need a woman to raise you
[1:11:00] and in the end days of course they
[1:11:02] didn't have these babies two bottles to
[1:11:05] raise babies off so they have to have a
[1:11:07] witness and Miriam I sent her down and
[1:11:09] she stood there she said I know where I
[1:11:11] can find a witness and come and got me
[1:11:12] and Moses the doors are all shut honey
[1:11:15] you're 16 years old now you're going to
[1:11:17] be Pharaoh son and someday you're going
[1:11:19] to be the be the deliverer that's going
[1:11:22] to take the people out here Moses
[1:11:24] ambitions begin to grow I'll study
[1:11:27] mother I'll study everything I can you
[1:11:30] know what I'll do I'll study hard to be
[1:11:32] a military man and I'll know how to take
[1:11:34] these people out of here
[1:11:36] I'll be the greatest general or Bishop
[1:11:38] you know I'll know how it's done and
[1:11:40] I'll I'll take them out I'll get my PhD
[1:11:43] or LLD I'll do it and all those
[1:11:47] ambitions came to naught amen
[1:11:52] God had to take him and take because
[1:11:56] Moses had to be conquered first in order
[1:11:59] for Moses to be used in the way that God
[1:12:00] had him in his word Moses had to be
[1:12:03] conquered I mean God had to take over
[1:12:05] Moses as this alright this morning a man
[1:12:10] he's come to take over but God has
[1:12:12] always veiled God has always veiled
[1:12:15] here's Vowell dinner and a burning bush
[1:12:17] he spoke to Moses he has Valda
[1:12:19] by day in a pillar of fire by night Amen
[1:12:22] when when Israel's following him and it
[1:12:25] was the angel of the Covenant
[1:12:26] Alleluia and then when I'm prophet aways
[1:12:29] came when it when a prophet would say
[1:12:31] thus saith the Lord it was that the
[1:12:33] prophet speaking it was God taking a
[1:12:35] taking a human vessel and speaking his
[1:12:38] word through that human vessel Amen sir
[1:12:41] and then so God we understand when they
[1:12:43] when they built the tabernacle and the
[1:12:45] wilderness God was well behind bad your
[1:12:47] skin's and God was you know and then
[1:12:50] they built the temple and God was behind
[1:12:51] though he was veiled behind in the
[1:12:54] temple God was in there but God his
[1:12:57] purpose was never just to be in a
[1:12:59] building made by hands he says you know
[1:13:01] he says that God does not dwell in a
[1:13:03] place made by human hands but God dwells
[1:13:05] in the soul he would ask you Isaiah yo
[1:13:10] yo yo I I made the heavens you know
[1:13:14] you're a humans yo yo you're the earth
[1:13:16] is my footstool laws different things
[1:13:17] where you asked where is the place of my
[1:13:19] rest so I made all these things but
[1:13:21] where is the place of my rest and he's
[1:13:23] actually asking the question I made all
[1:13:26] things but where are my children I can
[1:13:28] have rest I can rest in them man but God
[1:13:31] wants to dwell in you is this all right
[1:13:33] God wants to dwell on you you are the
[1:13:35] place of his rest but in order to become
[1:13:38] the place of his rest you've got to be
[1:13:39] he's going to take over you take all of
[1:13:43] me don't let me go you know that song we
[1:13:45] sing amen
[1:13:47] take all of me and so then he comes down
[1:13:51] this go to Malachi 3 and 1 and I read a
[1:13:55] few scriptures
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:08] Malachi 3:1 God changes us form all the
[1:14:11] way down through the Bible we understand
[1:14:14] that there had to be a time when when
[1:14:17] God Himself would become flesh and he
[1:14:21] says here Malachi 3:1 behold I will send
[1:14:25] my messenger and he shall prepare the
[1:14:27] way before me and the Lord whom you seek
[1:14:30] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[1:14:33] the messenger of the Covenant whom he
[1:14:35] delighted and behold he shall come saith
[1:14:38] the Lord of hosts
[1:14:40] now this prophecy I'll see my messager
[1:14:43] he will prepare the way before me we
[1:14:45] understand that that was the Ministry of
[1:14:47] John the Baptist but you see the big
[1:14:49] part of that of the purpose of John's
[1:14:53] ministry was to point to the people the
[1:14:56] Lamb of God because the temple that it
[1:14:59] says the messenger now the word
[1:15:01] messenger in the Bible is the same word
[1:15:02] as angel so it says this messenger of
[1:15:05] the Covenant was the Angel of the
[1:15:06] Covenant that led Israel out of Egypt
[1:15:09] into the Promised Land and so they were
[1:15:12] looking he says he shall suddenly come
[1:15:13] to his temple
[1:15:14] now this temple speaking about is not
[1:15:16] the one that was built in Jerusalem but
[1:15:18] Jesus said his body was the temple a
[1:15:21] mint so when he came to the River Jordan
[1:15:23] to be baptized he says he was baptized
[1:15:26] by John and the Spirit of God descended
[1:15:28] upon him like a dove and a voice came
[1:15:31] out of here and saying behold this is my
[1:15:32] beloved son and whom I'm well pleased so
[1:15:35] the angel of the Covenant was coming to
[1:15:36] his temple Alleluia and Jesus would say
[1:15:40] it's not me that thought the works it's
[1:15:41] the father dwells in me he doeth the
[1:15:43] works so now God was veiled behind a
[1:15:46] human veil hallelujah but this veil was
[1:15:50] not was not born as inborn and sinned
[1:15:53] like we were amen but they but the
[1:15:55] you're the fool the sin the original sin
[1:15:58] was bypass and he was cradled in Mary's
[1:16:00] womb say he was born into the human race
[1:16:03] I mean like we are but he wasn't born in
[1:16:07] sin shaped iniquity come to the world
[1:16:08] speaking lives he wasn't born in a
[1:16:11] fallen condition all right okay
[1:16:13] sure his body age everything but he
[1:16:15] didn't have a fallen spirit
[1:16:17] you know like we do so here he comes now
[1:16:20] the same and then so what happened when
[1:16:23] Jesus came he begun to gather his
[1:16:25] children he began to gather as children
[1:16:28] and he was loosing them from the powers
[1:16:31] of darkness I mean there's a woman at
[1:16:33] the well there was Legion had a thousand
[1:16:36] odd demons in them this is a
[1:16:37] demon-possessed man who was naked among
[1:16:40] the tombs and you're in darkness he was
[1:16:43] he was under the bondage of Satan the
[1:16:45] scribes and Pharisees were were under a
[1:16:48] religious power and so Legion came to
[1:16:51] him and what was happening he is
[1:16:52] basically saying to Legion I've come to
[1:16:54] take over I've come to loose you amen
[1:16:57] from the powers of darkness that you
[1:16:59] would be my disciple you'd be one of
[1:17:01] mine and he began to gather the you know
[1:17:03] John and James and you know all the
[1:17:06] Apostles because member Satan must be
[1:17:09] dethroned Satan must be deferred and the
[1:17:13] end that the throning begins in use
[1:17:15] earlier the thirteen begins you know and
[1:17:18] you we could read in Daniel where Daniel
[1:17:21] saw the you know you know the image of
[1:17:22] the heat of gold and silver and brass
[1:17:24] and the iron and the iron and clay and
[1:17:26] that's the world powers to the end but
[1:17:29] then at the very feet of the iron and
[1:17:30] the iron of iron and clay and the feet
[1:17:33] becomes a stone cut down the mountain
[1:17:36] not made with hands which is Christ and
[1:17:38] it comes and strikes the image and the
[1:17:40] feet and the whole thing is reduced to
[1:17:42] powder and is blown away never to be
[1:17:44] seen again
[1:17:44] so there's it comes a time where the
[1:17:47] kingdoms of man become the kingdoms of
[1:17:49] God where it's not this man's world
[1:17:51] power anymore but God sets up his
[1:17:53] kingdom upon the year hallelujah and
[1:17:56] that happens that starts in the believer
[1:17:58] I mean where the spirit that is in the
[1:18:01] world
[1:18:01] amen as death row hallelujah
[1:18:04] where he's taken out of you like as God
[1:18:07] says I've come to take over I mean but I
[1:18:09] I do not make you slaves or I beat you
[1:18:11] around and make you do certain things
[1:18:12] but you become loved prisoners to me
[1:18:15] wasn't a glorious day when you became as
[1:18:17] love first Oh Lord take all of me you're
[1:18:20] so glorious you died on cross for me
[1:18:22] Polly you shed your blood I've been
[1:18:25] redeemed by you it's such an honor such
[1:18:27] a privilege to be one of yours
[1:18:29] hallelujah it's glorious thing sorry
[1:18:33] Satan has to be dethroned and so Jesus
[1:18:38] when together his disciples he was
[1:18:40] speaking to them he was revealing
[1:18:43] himself to them and they're cool Satan
[1:18:47] Peter didn't say Peter in the carnal way
[1:18:52] after the day of Pentecost he was a new
[1:18:55] creation amen
[1:18:57] yo same old body but a new man now lived
[1:19:00] in the body hallelujah the woman at the
[1:19:02] well she didn't stay the woman at the
[1:19:04] well glory to God I mean that's why you
[1:19:08] know the Apostle Paul says this one
[1:19:10] thing I do forgetting the signature in
[1:19:12] the past press on to the mark of the
[1:19:14] high calling he says this one thing I do
[1:19:15] and that's the one thing we should do I
[1:19:18] mean whatever we came from forget about
[1:19:21] it just rejoice that's not you anymore
[1:19:24] hallelujah
[1:19:25] be with me amen if God's forgiven you
[1:19:28] you should don't don't feel guilty
[1:19:32] are you with me I don't think guilt hold
[1:19:35] you down and oh this is what yeah the
[1:19:37] devil says you once did this and you did
[1:19:39] this and you willingly did this Jesus
[1:19:42] blood cleanses us from all sin Amen -
[1:19:46] don't just say Satan take your guilt
[1:19:48] away Amen the blood of Jesus has
[1:19:50] cleansed me Alleluia
[1:19:52] if God has made you a new creature in
[1:19:54] him he doesn't do that to throw you away
[1:19:56] the next day I mean he doesn't go I
[1:19:58] remember what you did you know cast you
[1:20:02] out he doesn't do that he knew what you
[1:20:04] did he knew what you did I mean but that
[1:20:08] didn't even come they didn't even come
[1:20:10] into his equation this equation is all
[1:20:12] that the father has given me will come
[1:20:14] to me and all that come to me on no wise
[1:20:16] cast out hilariously saying I have a
[1:20:19] certain number of people and even if
[1:20:21] even if anyone comes to me I'll no wise
[1:20:23] cast them out amen and I will dethrone
[1:20:25] Satan and I'll take over hallelujah he
[1:20:31] has come to take over friends
[1:20:32] this human battle this this life we live
[1:20:36] we're not called to do it alone we're
[1:20:39] not kalter just with our own
[1:20:42] two hands and this gray matter in here
[1:20:44] you know people rely they get self-help
[1:20:47] books how can I improve myself we're not
[1:20:50] called to improve ourselves by our
[1:20:52] nobility we're called to just let go and
[1:20:54] let God have his way
[1:20:56] amen you can't never it can't be true
[1:21:00] there's been a lot of battles in history
[1:21:02] that have gone pear-shaped because
[1:21:04] there's been two generals in charge amen
[1:21:08] the Battle of Waterloo nearly went
[1:21:09] really bad for the British in there and
[1:21:12] their allies against Napoleon because
[1:21:14] there's more than one there's a few
[1:21:16] battles like that you can't be in charge
[1:21:20] in Jesus being charged at the same time
[1:21:22] it's either you or him I mean because it
[1:21:25] can't be because the Lord member the
[1:21:27] Lord will take as much as you can give
[1:21:29] him you know he was invited into Simon
[1:21:32] the Pharisees house he was invited in he
[1:21:36] came he he wasn't given preeminence in
[1:21:39] the life he was made fun off but he
[1:21:42] still took what he was given they meant
[1:21:44] he was he was invited he was there his
[1:21:48] feet weren't washed but he still he
[1:21:50] still came inside you know he still yah
[1:21:52] was found in there he wasn't greeted he
[1:21:55] wasn't anointed a new robe wasn't put on
[1:21:57] him but he was still there he was happy
[1:22:00] to take just that little part and it's
[1:22:02] the same thing but that wasn't taking
[1:22:04] over amen
[1:22:06] that wasn't taking over he was just
[1:22:08] there you know maybe just a draw code
[1:22:12] for for other people in the feast
[1:22:14] because of Simon's you know he wanted to
[1:22:16] have a real fancy do it's a he just took
[1:22:20] but Jesus still went they meant he
[1:22:24] wasn't in charge but when the woman came
[1:22:27] when that woman came with alabaster box
[1:22:30] hallelujah she placed herself under his
[1:22:32] feet I meant you saying take control
[1:22:35] take me over God hallelujah
[1:22:39] and Jesus said maybe just just mention
[1:22:42] these words so I'm gonna I've got one
[1:22:44] thing to say to thee hey I came here I
[1:22:47] was invited my feet are unwashed still
[1:22:49] on your fancy couch well you know I
[1:22:52] wasn't greeted with a kiss I'm a very
[1:22:55] welcome but this
[1:22:56] woman why did why don't we invite Jesus
[1:22:59] to come this is why we invite Jesus come
[1:23:02] but this woman since I've been here
[1:23:04] she's anointed my feet she's washed her
[1:23:07] washed my feet with her tears dried them
[1:23:09] with her hair has towels I said this
[1:23:11] woman who though her sins were great
[1:23:13] Allu you her sin so many amen
[1:23:17] I now washed God Alleluia and he says to
[1:23:23] her here's the fountain of Mercy you
[1:23:26] your sins are being forgiven amen and
[1:23:29] these Simon the Pharisee in his heart
[1:23:33] saying if this man was really a prophet
[1:23:35] he wouldn't have this one come and wash
[1:23:38] his feet but here was the body you see
[1:23:41] remember we said that he is the head she
[1:23:43] was part of the body she placed herself
[1:23:46] she said Lord I'm not I'm just yeah
[1:23:51] you're in charge I want you to take over
[1:23:53] my life and and Simon the Pharisee nough
[1:23:57] spread was saying there's no way if if
[1:24:01] this prophet really knew if he was
[1:24:03] really a prophet he would never have
[1:24:05] allowed her to even touch him and that's
[1:24:08] the same way the devil looks at you he
[1:24:11] with me it's the same way the devil
[1:24:13] looks at you
[1:24:14] he looks at the Union says there's no
[1:24:15] way this great holy God member Satan was
[1:24:18] he anointed cherub that covereth
[1:24:20] he knows what it's like to be in the
[1:24:21] presence of God he knows the glory of
[1:24:24] heaven and but he looks at you and he
[1:24:28] says there's no way this could be the
[1:24:29] body I mean there's no way that you
[1:24:32] could be part of the body
[1:24:33] yeah when you're when Paul was writing
[1:24:36] writing the book of Colossians saying
[1:24:38] that he is the head and the body is the
[1:24:40] church he no doubt probably would have
[1:24:42] read that and said no there's no way
[1:24:44] these people he's writing to could be
[1:24:46] the body look what they came out of I
[1:24:48] mean look at the state they were in
[1:24:51] Alleluia but one thing Satan you I was
[1:24:54] once and charged in but then I got cast
[1:24:56] out Laura to God I mean because God came
[1:25:00] and took over now
[1:25:02] and it Moses his day under the blood of
[1:25:05] bulls and goats God could anoint someone
[1:25:08] and the
[1:25:09] inspiration would strike them but then
[1:25:11] it would leave again but then so so
[1:25:14] that's why Moses now when when God would
[1:25:17] speak thus saith the Lord through Moses
[1:25:18] it was God speaking
[1:25:20] but then the inspiration left because
[1:25:21] under the blood of bulls and goats God
[1:25:23] could not dwell in him permanently amen
[1:25:26] so that's why Moses you know Moses was
[1:25:29] Moses when God wasn't speaking through
[1:25:31] him all right God could not dwell in
[1:25:34] there because the blood of bulls and
[1:25:36] goats could not cleanse the person could
[1:25:38] not cleanse the temple in order for God
[1:25:40] to come into our Linnet right so God was
[1:25:42] with them but not in them and you know
[1:25:47] and the old test was God above us and
[1:25:49] then when Jesus was Jesus was born he
[1:25:51] shall call his name Emmanuel meaning God
[1:25:54] with us but that wasn't God's final
[1:25:56] destination he couldn't just be with us
[1:25:58] people he had to be in his people
[1:26:00] Alleluia
[1:26:02] so that's why under the blood of Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ now he cleanses the believer a me
[1:26:06] by one offering not by two but by one
[1:26:09] offering here said that he is you know
[1:26:11] perfect at them forever that were
[1:26:13] sanctified and so he goes from being
[1:26:16] with us to in us a mint so for an order
[1:26:20] for God to take over now he has to come
[1:26:22] and dwell in you he has to he has to be
[1:26:25] on the throne of your heart I knew glad
[1:26:29] if he is say Lord you've taken over
[1:26:32] Laura to God now the Apostle Paul was a
[1:26:38] man of ambition he would say I believe
[1:26:41] it's in the book of Galatians that on
[1:26:42] heaven he says I was a Pharisee of the
[1:26:44] Pharisees
[1:26:45] the man had ambition he wanted to be the
[1:26:48] next maybe high priest or you know one
[1:26:50] of the great men and his ambition had
[1:26:53] allowed him to climb up a certain way so
[1:26:55] he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and
[1:26:57] the high priest had such confidence in
[1:27:00] him that he actually allowed conceived
[1:27:03] of Paul take these letters of authority
[1:27:05] and go bind the Christians that you find
[1:27:07] in Damascus they had confidence and Paul
[1:27:09] but Paul was a prisoner to the wrong
[1:27:12] thing amen god never ordained Paul to be
[1:27:17] a prisoner to that Pharisee religious
[1:27:18] system and so when Paul was on the way
[1:27:22] to Damascus
[1:27:22] he meant the same one that Moses meant
[1:27:25] hallelujah he made the same one Gideon
[1:27:28] me he meant the same on Abraham meant
[1:27:31] hallelujah he meant this yah he meant
[1:27:34] the same one all the way down through
[1:27:35] the scripture because it was a great
[1:27:38] light shone about him and he looks up as
[1:27:41] his who are you lord
[1:27:42] now this world really have stumped him
[1:27:44] because he would look at the Christian
[1:27:46] saying this is a cult this is a sick
[1:27:49] this is no way dissident this is the
[1:27:52] fulfillment of the promises of the Old
[1:27:54] Testament if the Messiah really came you
[1:27:56] know the a stairway would have came out
[1:27:59] of heaven he would have walked right
[1:28:00] down to the high priests saying Here I
[1:28:01] am
[1:28:02] he didn't come according to what I
[1:28:03] believe it should be but this light
[1:28:06] spoken said I am Jesus whom you
[1:28:08] persecute now I think I've seen it
[1:28:11] before but the Apostle Paul never went
[1:28:14] hunting a pillar of fire to persecute
[1:28:17] that and thrown into prison he was he
[1:28:19] was after the Christians and he was
[1:28:22] persecuting them but because Jesus dwelt
[1:28:24] in them he was persecuting God oh my
[1:28:28] it's a silly thing to do but hasten his
[1:28:30] blinding Amen and he was an unbelief
[1:28:34] religious as he was he was walking in
[1:28:36] unbelief and so now Paul after this
[1:28:39] moment he became a prisoner to Jesus
[1:28:41] Christ and so all of Paul's and bishops
[1:28:45] you know Paul was a very influential man
[1:28:48] not like not in the same bracket as
[1:28:51] Moses Bing Bing potentially the next
[1:28:53] Pharaoh but here's a very influential
[1:28:55] man but he had to forsake all those
[1:28:58] things he says I counted all but dung
[1:29:00] that I may win Christ hallelujah
[1:29:03] they say that's an incredible statement
[1:29:05] to have I trust that's your heart too I
[1:29:08] mean you've counted all but done take
[1:29:11] this whole world but give me Jesus
[1:29:12] because there'll come a time where where
[1:29:15] the last breath is breathed the last
[1:29:17] heart beat is beaten and then what and
[1:29:20] then where do you go so he says he says
[1:29:24] Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:29:28] now let's go to let's go to Ephesians
[1:29:32] three and one I just want to read a bit
[1:29:34] of this chapter
[1:29:36] I knew glad he's come to take over we're
[1:29:41] gonna get through this okay Asians three
[1:29:44] and one for this cause i paul the
[1:29:52] prisoner of jesus christ for you
[1:29:54] gentiles and you why is here
[1:29:57] Alleluia for you have heard of the
[1:30:00] dispensation of the grace of God which
[1:30:02] was given me to you would how that by
[1:30:05] revelation he made known unto me the
[1:30:07] mystery as I wrote a 4-time in a few
[1:30:10] words whereby when you read you may
[1:30:12] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:30:13] of Christ which in other ages was not
[1:30:16] made known unto the sons of men as it
[1:30:19] has now revealed unto his holy apostles
[1:30:21] and prophets by the spirit that the
[1:30:25] Gentiles should be fellow ears of the
[1:30:27] same body and partakers of of his
[1:30:30] promise in Christ by the gospel wherever
[1:30:33] I was made a minister according to the
[1:30:35] gift of the grace of God given unto me
[1:30:37] by the effectual working of his power
[1:30:39] and to me who am less then least of All
[1:30:43] Saints is this grace given that I should
[1:30:45] preach among the Gentiles the
[1:30:47] unsearchable riches of Christ and to
[1:30:50] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[1:30:52] of the mystery which from the beginning
[1:30:54] of the world hath been hid in God who
[1:30:57] created all things by Jesus Christ to
[1:30:59] the intent that now unto the
[1:31:02] principalities and powers and heavenly
[1:31:04] places may be known by the church the
[1:31:06] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[1:31:09] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[1:31:11] Christ Jesus our Lord and whom we have
[1:31:13] boldness and access with confidence by
[1:31:16] the faith of him wherefore I desire that
[1:31:18] you faint not at my tribulations for you
[1:31:21] which is your glory for this cause I bow
[1:31:23] my knees and to the father of our Lord
[1:31:25] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:31:28] heaven and earth is named that he may
[1:31:30] grant you according to the riches of his
[1:31:32] glory to be strengthened with might by
[1:31:34] the spirit in the inner man that Christ
[1:31:36] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[1:31:39] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[1:31:41] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[1:31:44] what is the breadth and the length and
[1:31:45] the depth and the height and to know the
[1:31:47] love of Christ which passes know
[1:31:50] that you may be filled with all the
[1:31:53] fullness of God so the Apostle Paul is
[1:31:56] saying that there were things that were
[1:31:57] hidden now I've been declared amen and
[1:32:02] we understand that when you'd say that
[1:32:05] the Gentiles should be the fellow is of
[1:32:07] the same body and partakers of his
[1:32:10] promise in Christ by the gospel now it's
[1:32:13] an incredible thing where you could just
[1:32:14] take a few where where God would hide it
[1:32:18] in the Old Testament with you know with
[1:32:21] with Jacob blessing the sons of Joseph
[1:32:24] that the blessing that shirt of God to
[1:32:26] the older went to the younger through
[1:32:28] the cross hallelujah and we're where
[1:32:32] Joseph himself would take a Gentile
[1:32:33] bride and and everyone would be sent
[1:32:37] from him and he'd reveal himself to us
[1:32:38] to his brethren me and Joseph we know as
[1:32:41] a type of Christ and so you know God is
[1:32:45] revealing just in that little thing I'm
[1:32:47] going to take a Gentile bride to myself
[1:32:49] remember husband and wife they become
[1:32:51] one flesh I mean they became the same
[1:32:54] body right see so he's just showing
[1:32:56] there that I'm gonna take Vic
[1:32:58] God Himself is gonna take a Gentile
[1:33:00] bride and she's gonna be up in the
[1:33:02] palace when I'm gonna reveal myself to
[1:33:04] my Jewish brethren glory to God
[1:33:06] hallelujah and so there's just a few
[1:33:09] things like that you take you take Boaz
[1:33:11] and Boaz taking Ruth and and Salman
[1:33:14] marrying Rahab and you're all those
[1:33:17] different types and shadows God is
[1:33:19] revealing down through there this is
[1:33:21] what I'm going to do now you look at you
[1:33:24] look at Rahab for instance though let's
[1:33:26] just take Ruth remember when God comes
[1:33:29] to take over you come into a different
[1:33:30] kind of economy you come into a
[1:33:33] different order Ruth was a Moabite us
[1:33:36] out of the covenants of God completely
[1:33:39] because she wasn't born in Israel she
[1:33:42] was a widow with nothing but then now so
[1:33:45] so her her the way she was living near
[1:33:50] her being a destitute person you know
[1:33:53] just just scrounging around gleaning in
[1:33:55] the field that tried and find some grain
[1:33:57] for for herself and for her
[1:33:59] mother-in-law that was what was
[1:34:00] governing her life that's what she once
[1:34:03] was
[1:34:04] but then now here comes someone else
[1:34:06] boys and it may be a bit strong but he
[1:34:09] could basically see it to work I've come
[1:34:10] to take over I'm going to deliver you
[1:34:12] from this widowhood I mean we're not
[1:34:15] even part of the covenants of God I'm
[1:34:18] going to take you from this widowhood
[1:34:19] I'm gonna unite myself with you because
[1:34:21] I love you
[1:34:22] that's that's the greatest thing a man
[1:34:24] why did Jesus die because He loves us
[1:34:26] amen jesus loves me this I know for the
[1:34:29] Bible tells me so
[1:34:31] and it's flourish when it goes from just
[1:34:32] more than ink on paper to our living
[1:34:34] reality hallelujah and then so because
[1:34:37] of the but the loves of boys head
[1:34:40] basically he said I'm going to take over
[1:34:42] you're not going to be a widow with
[1:34:44] nothing I'm going to bring you into the
[1:34:46] covenants of Israel hallelujah that now
[1:34:49] you you'll receive the promise I mean
[1:34:52] that you didn't have under your first
[1:34:53] your your first night to your first
[1:34:55] identity I'm going to give you a new
[1:34:57] identity I'm going to make you mrs. Boaz
[1:35:00] hallelujah
[1:35:01] mighty man of wealth and it's the same
[1:35:03] thing with us we're under the powers of
[1:35:05] darkness
[1:35:06] we're like a widow with nothing
[1:35:08] spiritually speaking I mean by spiritual
[1:35:11] things are all the matter I'm in you
[1:35:14] can't take anything with you I can't
[1:35:17] take these clothes with me I can't take
[1:35:20] my smartphone with me I can't take
[1:35:24] something that people strive for for
[1:35:25] years
[1:35:26] you can't take it with you so I mean
[1:35:30] it's given to you for a season the Lord
[1:35:33] giveth the Lord taketh away and he
[1:35:35] taketh away it doesn't mean issue no
[1:35:37] joke you know he says the Lord gives the
[1:35:40] Lord takes away blessed be the name of
[1:35:41] the Lord so he was just saying I don't
[1:35:44] know what's going on but blessed be his
[1:35:46] name Amen he didn't say oh my life has
[1:35:50] gone all sideways because I've done
[1:35:51] something he just rejoice a well the
[1:35:54] Lord gives just like children they just
[1:35:56] loaned to us for a season then
[1:35:58] eventually they grow up and you got to
[1:36:00] pass them off Alleluia and you know just
[1:36:05] like anything in life life is but a
[1:36:06] vapor but her ruse just like us now we
[1:36:13] will once outside of the Commonwealth of
[1:36:16] Israel the Bible tells us not
[1:36:17] even part of the covenants of God but by
[1:36:20] the blood of Jesus Christ he brings us
[1:36:22] in hallelujah so once we were you know
[1:36:26] once we were under the Dominion of our
[1:36:29] culture or the national spirit or you
[1:36:33] know our level in society once we were
[1:36:35] that's why we have all things in common
[1:36:38] Amen it's like we're talking to brother
[1:36:41] Joe's ahe's in Angola and he's talking
[1:36:45] about a so he's a believer he is once
[1:36:47] here in Wellington once upon a time
[1:36:48] haven't spoke to him in like six years I
[1:36:51] think anyway so he is saying he's a mess
[1:36:54] of Pentecostal church here in Angola
[1:36:55] just just near where they are thousands
[1:36:57] of people but they have to have a
[1:36:59] service for every different language
[1:37:01] because this group doesn't like this
[1:37:03] group and this group doesn't like this
[1:37:04] group so they can't just have Church
[1:37:06] together what's happened so that's not
[1:37:09] right but in Christ we're all we have
[1:37:12] everything in common amen in Christ we
[1:37:16] have more things in common with maybe
[1:37:18] your childhood friends or someone you've
[1:37:20] basically grown up with amen because
[1:37:23] we're at one spirit we're one mind one
[1:37:25] heart one a call hallelujah where once
[1:37:29] upon a time maybe we want to talk to
[1:37:31] each other because of racial prejudice
[1:37:33] or whatever more maybe would never had
[1:37:35] fellowship but now we have all things in
[1:37:37] common
[1:37:39] glory to God why because he came and
[1:37:44] he's taken over all right is that okay
[1:37:48] now so Paul wants us to know now what is
[1:37:53] the Fellowship of this mystery that God
[1:37:56] now to the intent and now that unto the
[1:38:00] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:38:01] places might be known by the church the
[1:38:04] manifold wisdom of God so God wants us
[1:38:06] to know he wants us to know a few things
[1:38:09] I meant that we are not now go go listen
[1:38:12] to Christ a mystery God revealed if you
[1:38:14] haven't recently goal doesn't do it
[1:38:16] again but we have to understand now if
[1:38:20] God has come to take over he is in
[1:38:23] charge of all things right this is not
[1:38:26] member this is not a chess match between
[1:38:27] us and the devil between God and the
[1:38:29] devil this is not a chess match
[1:38:31] if I do this and he'll do this and I'll
[1:38:33] take this and he'll do this and he may
[1:38:34] take this it's not this God has a will
[1:38:37] God has an intent right here's a will
[1:38:40] are you with me
[1:38:41] it may be quite hot in here but don't
[1:38:43] fall asleep on me I mean remember God
[1:38:46] has a will he says all of the father has
[1:38:48] given me will come to me and all the
[1:38:50] country I'll no wise cast out and
[1:38:52] there's a certain number of seats around
[1:38:55] the wedding supper table and but God
[1:38:57] uses imagery like this through your for
[1:38:59] us to understand and everyone's place
[1:39:01] everyone has to be at their place
[1:39:03] hallelujah so he so he has to come now
[1:39:06] come down into time dwell himself with
[1:39:09] her people to show to Satan even with
[1:39:12] what you did in the garden my redemption
[1:39:15] is more powerful amen it's greater he
[1:39:18] following me I mean that I can come and
[1:39:20] dwell in the human people that I will
[1:39:22] take dominion over them by love and they
[1:39:25] will defeat you I mean I will defeat you
[1:39:28] as I cast you out of heaven you all
[1:39:30] buddy you will be defeated upon the
[1:39:32] earth you say well God doesn't dwell the
[1:39:35] people yes he does it's got a let's go
[1:39:40] to 1st John 4 and 2 Jesus literally
[1:39:46] dwells in people he literally not just
[1:39:50] not just mentally like a mental idea God
[1:39:53] literally comes to out and dwells and
[1:39:55] people that's why you should be able to
[1:39:57] look at what you once were and once you
[1:39:59] once loved and once enjoyed and
[1:40:02] everything and see now you're a
[1:40:04] different person you know I've seen
[1:40:06] people receive the Holy Ghost and they
[1:40:08] look different just the countenance in
[1:40:09] their face something's happened to them
[1:40:11] hallelujah Amen why because someone else
[1:40:14] has stepped into the house
[1:40:16] si si si hereby we know the Spirit of
[1:40:19] God we just want sorry we just want
[1:40:21] first to everybody know ye the Spirit of
[1:40:25] God every spirit that confesses that
[1:40:27] Jesus Christ is come and the flesh is of
[1:40:31] God now this is not a play of words it
[1:40:34] does not say has come or will come as
[1:40:38] present tense now come I meant every
[1:40:41] spirit that says that he is come and
[1:40:43] flesh well what pleasure
[1:40:45] that you say well he he we're not there
[1:40:49] in the days when he was walking around
[1:40:51] in in his body but then he would take
[1:40:54] care of people redeem them and they
[1:40:56] become the body of Christ upon the earth
[1:40:58] amen so this is still he's the same
[1:41:00] yesterday today and forever
[1:41:02] he just changes his Vail Amy just like
[1:41:05] went from pillar of fire to to
[1:41:07] Tabernacle in the wilderness to Temple I
[1:41:09] meant then he went to a living temple
[1:41:11] and then he took living stones he took
[1:41:14] people hallelujah God went
[1:41:17] he says program says God is like a big
[1:41:18] contractor he's talking about your body
[1:41:20] and the elements of the earth but you
[1:41:22] know there he goes into Israel he's
[1:41:24] looking for stones he's looking for
[1:41:27] people the Builder build a temple
[1:41:29] hallelujah is just like how how how
[1:41:32] Jesus knows the samples they went to the
[1:41:34] temple and in the end in the you know
[1:41:38] the disciples say look at these stones
[1:41:40] how goodly of these stones and Jesus
[1:41:43] really if he could really tell them it's
[1:41:45] a we said this is nothing this is going
[1:41:48] to be come to nothing but really he
[1:41:50] should have said and looked at them and
[1:41:52] said look at these stones hallelujah
[1:41:55] look at these stones and they look at
[1:41:57] themselves say what are you talking
[1:41:58] about I'm a person isn't you a part of
[1:42:00] the body you to be part of my dwelling
[1:42:03] place amen in a chosen stones shaped
[1:42:06] stones hallelujah because it's like a
[1:42:09] contractor they get a material then they
[1:42:10] build the building and here you are I
[1:42:13] might be jumping around but I trust this
[1:42:15] means a little bit to someone here you
[1:42:17] are you may look at yourself saying
[1:42:19] there's no great value to me but God
[1:42:21] would say look at the stone however I
[1:42:23] place it in the body place it in the
[1:42:26] temple are you were following me I mean
[1:42:29] I know exactly the part you're going to
[1:42:31] be in shape you by my word holy a place
[1:42:35] you where you should be placed
[1:42:37] Alleluia it says as Jesus Christ as the
[1:42:39] chief Cornerstone he wasn't a piece of
[1:42:42] masonry as a person he's God himself
[1:42:46] earlier how could these stones are you
[1:42:49] must be how how good these stones are
[1:42:52] I'm looking at you a Peter says that we
[1:42:54] are living stones lively stones
[1:42:58] I mean we're built up into the house of
[1:42:59] God the temple of God tell Lewis this is
[1:43:02] that Jesus has come and flesh so God has
[1:43:06] veiled in people today amen you say this
[1:43:09] is very elementary now you've got to
[1:43:11] understand who's in charge of your
[1:43:13] battle who's in charge of your battle
[1:43:15] because it's not God with us of God
[1:43:17] above us as God in you Christ in you the
[1:43:19] hope of glory hallelujah who's in charge
[1:43:22] now so he is come in human flesh now
[1:43:28] brother Browns speaks I don't believe I
[1:43:30] have the quote here but he speaks about
[1:43:33] this bride coming of Christ I'm jumping
[1:43:36] probably we're heated myself but he
[1:43:38] speaks about this bride coming of Christ
[1:43:40] now that is not a scary thing to me as
[1:43:45] we said that you know Jesus's come in
[1:43:47] human flesh so there has to be a part of
[1:43:50] us coming as God manifested in you amen
[1:43:54] and if God is you know who dwells in
[1:43:58] this thing by your fruits you shall know
[1:44:01] them you know so what is manifesting
[1:44:05] where once upon a time I would never
[1:44:08] come into a place like this and now here
[1:44:11] I am and now I love to be gathered with
[1:44:13] you people I love their fellows but
[1:44:15] probably once a world time Oh PO we
[1:44:17] probably wouldn't be friends because we
[1:44:20] like different things well what's
[1:44:21] happened something else has moved in
[1:44:23] amen brother
[1:44:25] yeah yeah it's like brother Bernie said
[1:44:27] yo he be he'd be there at the platform
[1:44:29] because no let's go to revelations
[1:44:32] chapter 10 okay so we went from just
[1:44:34] just very quick overview remember pillar
[1:44:37] of fire there in the burning bush then
[1:44:40] built the tab back in the wilderness God
[1:44:41] comes and dwells in it God reveals
[1:44:43] himself as many different forms through
[1:44:45] the Old Testament and then then he comes
[1:44:48] here's his prepared sacrifice the word
[1:44:50] became flesh and dwelt among us the
[1:44:52] angel the Covenant came in 12 in Jesus
[1:44:54] Christ right and then that body went to
[1:44:57] Calvary and then that same one came down
[1:44:59] the day of Pentecost like a rushing
[1:45:02] mighty wind pillars of fire came and
[1:45:04] dwelt in them
[1:45:04] God separate himself into the body right
[1:45:07] and then that life goes forth now that
[1:45:11] is that is what God has done and every
[1:45:16] time when God would reveal himself he
[1:45:17] says I've come to take over come to take
[1:45:20] over your human battle I've come to
[1:45:21] deliver you that's the pattern so now if
[1:45:25] we go to revelations chapter 10 it comes
[1:45:27] a time where there is a fulfillment
[1:45:32] where everything that Jesus died for
[1:45:36] would be manifested remember he didn't
[1:45:39] just die just to forgive us he died to
[1:45:42] restore man back to its original
[1:45:43] position as God's over the earth as
[1:45:46] having dominion over wherever they live
[1:45:49] now that doesn't mean you kick the mayor
[1:45:52] out of the city and say now I'm in
[1:45:53] charge your boy because I'm a son of God
[1:45:55] that's not what I'm talking about
[1:45:56] but everything so everything the devil
[1:45:58] tries to tries to push at you and make
[1:46:01] you be bound down by that is not that is
[1:46:03] not incharge you but it's under your
[1:46:05] feet amen whatever circumstance doesn't
[1:46:09] matter you know it makes it that your
[1:46:12] faith is unwavering okay where it can be
[1:46:15] instantly God can do something or it can
[1:46:17] be years but your faith is still I know
[1:46:19] in whom I have believed the promise is
[1:46:22] on its way
[1:46:23] hallelujah is that right now
[1:46:28] it comes a time so he's got revelations
[1:46:31] 10 and 1 and I saw another mighty angel
[1:46:35] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:46:37] cloud and a rainbow upon his head in his
[1:46:39] face as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:46:43] pillars of fire and he had in him a
[1:46:45] little book open and he set his right
[1:46:48] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[1:46:49] the earth and he cried with a loud voice
[1:46:51] as a lion roth and when it when had
[1:46:54] cried seven thunders uttered their
[1:46:55] voices now we're just going to stop
[1:46:56] there a little bit so look John John
[1:47:01] sees this mighty angel come down from
[1:47:03] heaven now the rainbow we know there's
[1:47:06] all symbolic but this is Christ
[1:47:08] descending right with a book that's come
[1:47:12] open so everything that Adam lost now
[1:47:15] has been open because the Lamb was
[1:47:17] worthy to open it right Ana and a
[1:47:20] rainbow represents the Covenant just
[1:47:23] like a Noah's day God put the
[1:47:25] in the sky to remind him not to remind
[1:47:29] you but to remind him when I see that
[1:47:31] sign
[1:47:31] I will it reminds me I'll not cover the
[1:47:34] whole earth with water and so this is a
[1:47:37] covenant angel coming down this is
[1:47:39] Christ ascending and he has and so his
[1:47:43] face is it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:47:46] pillars of fire now we're so the pillar
[1:47:50] of fire always represents God in a form
[1:47:53] now where is the pillar of fire today
[1:47:57] I'm just yeah in us right so now if the
[1:48:02] pillar of fire is in you then this
[1:48:04] Angeles descended and where is this feet
[1:48:07] today where is this body
[1:48:08] hello body how are you amen to this
[1:48:12] mighty angel had me but this is not a
[1:48:13] doctrine this is a reality right just
[1:48:17] like Moses Moses them go down to Egypt
[1:48:18] to teach some things or I want to take
[1:48:21] you to Mount Sinai because I'm going to
[1:48:22] teach you some doctrine it was more than
[1:48:24] that it was God came down I'm going to
[1:48:27] deliver my people I'm going to create an
[1:48:29] approach that they could have fellowship
[1:48:31] with me but I can't walk walk among men
[1:48:33] but because it was the blood of bulls
[1:48:35] and goats it was always a separation
[1:48:37] between them and God but by the blood of
[1:48:39] Jesus Christ he's not just with us he's
[1:48:41] in us Alleluia see he comes the covenant
[1:48:44] anthesis Christ this is the Holy Ghost
[1:48:46] coming right you say well what is
[1:48:51] different between this and the book of
[1:48:53] Acts well in the book of Acts the book
[1:48:55] was still sealed
[1:48:56] I meant they had dominion but I remember
[1:48:59] if you look at the Ephesian age they
[1:49:01] aimed at the high calling in Christ but
[1:49:03] they relaxed and they drifted and the
[1:49:06] church would eventually drift and go
[1:49:08] down into the Dark Ages right but they
[1:49:10] were victorious the same Holy Ghost that
[1:49:12] dwells in there must well in you that's
[1:49:14] why brother Graham says this modern
[1:49:16] church today they don't want any
[1:49:18] screaming crying acts 2:38 youngins
[1:49:21] around miserable creatures she thinks
[1:49:24] they are but that's the only kind that
[1:49:26] the word can bring forth he says an
[1:49:29] invisible union of the bride any so so
[1:49:31] what is he saying about that he says
[1:49:32] that's that is the day of Pentecost that
[1:49:35] same God comes and dwells in you
[1:49:37] hallelujah
[1:49:38] that's what
[1:49:39] we shouldn't be afraid to just let go
[1:49:40] and let God have his way Amen hallelujah
[1:49:43] it's a glorious thing you say well
[1:49:46] you're going for emotion no emotion
[1:49:48] comes with it but you've got open the
[1:49:50] door of your heart you're gonna let him
[1:49:52] step in Alleluia so now he his feet are
[1:49:56] as pillars of fire and that Dolph's
[1:49:58] member this anointing that came down
[1:50:00] didn't go away when the prophet went
[1:50:02] away write this it sinners word that's
[1:50:06] released upon the earth and that every
[1:50:08] one that believes the word the same
[1:50:09] angel comes to them one day an angel
[1:50:12] came broke away these chains this angel
[1:50:15] came hallelujah amen giving the promise
[1:50:19] now everything Adam lost I'm going to go
[1:50:21] in to restore remember this message is
[1:50:24] more than God seen a prophet God seen a
[1:50:25] prophet it's now I'm going to take your
[1:50:28] people and I'm going to place them where
[1:50:29] they should be in heavenly places that
[1:50:31] everything that the devil can do and
[1:50:33] trust you is under their feet earlier
[1:50:35] because he's come to take over glory to
[1:50:39] God now and he set one foot upon the sea
[1:50:43] and upon the earth now if you read the
[1:50:47] Book of Revelations there's two powers
[1:50:49] that come out of the come out one comes
[1:50:52] out of the sea people people's
[1:50:53] multitudes nations and tongues as the
[1:50:55] sea I mean which is the Roman Church and
[1:50:58] all of its daughters that power comes in
[1:51:00] one that comes out of the earth this is
[1:51:01] America everything out of there that
[1:51:05] means all this culture and religion that
[1:51:07] has come up it's under your feet amen
[1:51:12] very very simply everything the devil
[1:51:14] has devised is under the Brides feet
[1:51:17] hallelujah that means we don't need to
[1:51:19] war against these things as in like this
[1:51:22] is not trench warfare like World War one
[1:51:24] this is not what this is about
[1:51:26] I'll build my bunker I'll build my
[1:51:28] trench I'll build my fortifications and
[1:51:30] try and hold on to here though we're
[1:51:31] expanding this is blitz creek hallelujah
[1:51:35] but this is what has been to be
[1:51:37] everything every promise that's why
[1:51:39] that's why Peter was told upon this rock
[1:51:42] I'll build my church the revelation of
[1:51:45] who he is you can't you can't give
[1:51:47] someone a revelation God has to give it
[1:51:49] to the person that's like faith you can
[1:51:51] you can
[1:51:52] Phaethon you can say believe all things
[1:51:54] are possible but faith is a no so it's
[1:51:57] not a hope so
[1:51:58] when Abraham took Isaac up to sacrifice
[1:52:00] and to give him back to God he wasn't
[1:52:03] saying I hope he comes back alive he had
[1:52:05] a revelation I was dead and I received
[1:52:07] as one from the dead even if I plunge
[1:52:09] the knife into his body he's going to
[1:52:10] come back
[1:52:11] amen those faith faith is that you know
[1:52:14] why brother brems is in perfect faith he
[1:52:17] says don't come up with his prayer line
[1:52:19] unless you've got perfect faith it's
[1:52:21] isn't that sermon that that perfect
[1:52:23] faith is you know something's going to
[1:52:24] happen I mean that is perfect face when
[1:52:28] you know something's going to happen
[1:52:29] it's not a hope so
[1:52:31] let your hopes to become a no source let
[1:52:34] us sink down into your heart that's like
[1:52:36] brother Brahim says about applying the
[1:52:38] token create the atmosphere they'll drop
[1:52:41] right into it I meant and you've got to
[1:52:44] believe for your house it's just the
[1:52:47] same faith you apply to yourself you got
[1:52:50] to believe for them well the faith you
[1:52:52] had for yourself or something anchored
[1:52:53] in saying I know it was the blood I know
[1:52:56] it was the blood for me as it come that
[1:52:58] way it's not oh I hope he dodged me it's
[1:53:00] I know you did it's becoming a reality
[1:53:02] and then so when you have that same
[1:53:05] faith for your children for your family
[1:53:07] it's like I know they're coming I know
[1:53:10] they're coming hallelujah let it become
[1:53:14] I I know they're coming when how why or
[1:53:18] when and how I don't know I know they're
[1:53:20] coming amen that's why Abraham he
[1:53:23] staggered not at the promise of God was
[1:53:25] strong giving praise because he knew
[1:53:27] Isaac was going to come how when well
[1:53:32] winners really well how actually cuz
[1:53:33] though I did know though old dog grandma
[1:53:35] grandpa amen but he knew that Isaac was
[1:53:39] going to come it was a no so now so
[1:53:45] brother Brahim says and the breech
[1:53:50] message he says speaking of what we just
[1:53:52] read there in Revelations 10 he said
[1:53:55] that angel comes at a time when the
[1:53:58] seventh angel messengers upon the earth
[1:54:00] he says he is upon the earth of time of
[1:54:03] that coming that's what he says
[1:54:05] so he's saying that so and he identifies
[1:54:07] himself as Malachi 4 so he says that he
[1:54:10] is upon the earth
[1:54:11] when this mighty angel descends what he
[1:54:13] says and brother Browns not here anymore
[1:54:16] he fulfilled the scripture perfectly to
[1:54:18] that ministry that means he's here Jesus
[1:54:21] here not in his physical body we got to
[1:54:24] meet that in the air right we are
[1:54:26] changed and go to meet him in the air
[1:54:28] but everything God is as present upon
[1:54:30] the earth hey hell is opened itself up
[1:54:33] upon the earth from this day all of
[1:54:35] heaven is here you read revelations
[1:54:37] chapter 9 it says the bottomless pit as
[1:54:39] open speaks about one woe and second woe
[1:54:41] yo 1st and 2nd were that's First World
[1:54:43] War Second World War
[1:54:45] it opens up around that time but then
[1:54:47] the first word of revelations 10 and 1
[1:54:50] is and I saw another mighty angel come
[1:54:52] down so hell is open itself up upon the
[1:54:55] earth and then heaven comes down
[1:54:58] hallelujah we're not in this battle
[1:55:00] alone member I've come to take over I've
[1:55:02] come to take over this battle Alleluia
[1:55:05] and he who has a book open in his hand
[1:55:07] now if we keep reading so seven thunders
[1:55:12] uttered their voices and when the seven
[1:55:15] thunders had uttered their voices I was
[1:55:16] about to write and I heard a voice from
[1:55:18] heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:55:20] things which the seven thunders uttered
[1:55:22] and write them not so John heard it
[1:55:25] buddy but it said seal it up right and
[1:55:29] the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:55:31] scene upon the earth lifted up a hand to
[1:55:33] heaven and he swear by him that liveth
[1:55:35] for ever and ever who created heaven and
[1:55:38] the things that there on earth and the
[1:55:39] earth and the things that therein are
[1:55:41] and the sea and the things that therein
[1:55:42] are that time should be no longer and
[1:55:45] that would actually no longer means
[1:55:46] there shall be no more delay now we just
[1:55:50] read beforehand that Christ created all
[1:55:52] things
[1:55:52] so he's swearing by himself I'm gonna
[1:55:55] wrap this up I'm gonna wrap this up they
[1:55:58] shall be no more delay so so if that's
[1:56:01] what he's calling for he's going to do a
[1:56:04] quick short work upon the earth and he
[1:56:06] has where he's fire he's found his
[1:56:08] children he's still finding them they've
[1:56:10] come out of Darkness out of the bondage
[1:56:12] of this world amen he's taking over
[1:56:15] Satan's been dethroned out of their
[1:56:17] lives and I'm speaking
[1:56:18] just yeah us as well Alleluia and he's
[1:56:22] lifted them up to be joint-heirs with
[1:56:25] himself Alleluia and then not not only
[1:56:28] that but season first even but in the
[1:56:30] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:56:31] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:56:34] of God should be finished as he has
[1:56:36] declared to servants the prophets
[1:56:39] so these thunders that were sealed up in
[1:56:41] the time of John it says that these
[1:56:43] mysteries shall be known of the days of
[1:56:45] the voice of the seventh angel and
[1:56:47] brother Baron Moses in 1964 what is the
[1:56:50] revelation of the seven thunders the
[1:56:52] seven seals he says yes they are
[1:56:54] Amen so in the so in the word itself as
[1:56:58] all the mysteries of the book amen and
[1:57:01] so that now gives us a power where we
[1:57:05] will not aim at and relax like the first
[1:57:08] stage because there's power in the word
[1:57:10] we understand that it says in Hebrews
[1:57:12] one and chapter one that says that he
[1:57:16] made all things right this fondant says
[1:57:21] Hebrews 1 and verse 3 that we're going
[1:57:25] for time we okay who being the
[1:57:29] brightness of his glory and the Express
[1:57:31] image of his person and upholding all
[1:57:33] things by the word of his power now it
[1:57:38] doesn't say by the power of his word it
[1:57:39] says by the word of his power so when
[1:57:41] God releases his word he releases a
[1:57:44] power in that word right just like in
[1:57:47] the Old Testament there was a word that
[1:57:49] was released through the law and one
[1:57:51] will chase a thousand till chase ten
[1:57:53] thousand you dwell in the land you know
[1:57:55] you push out all the enemy you will
[1:57:56] dwell in your inheritance now that
[1:57:59] didn't give them overcoming power over
[1:58:01] sin because the sin nature was still in
[1:58:03] them right
[1:58:04] but then when Jesus came and he released
[1:58:06] the word he died on the cross for us
[1:58:08] amen a release of power now that would
[1:58:11] take some nature out of the believer and
[1:58:13] give God would have dominion over them
[1:58:15] right and that so by the power of that
[1:58:19] word people could now live above sin
[1:58:21] glory to God amen and so now he is open
[1:58:26] because brother brown people would say
[1:58:27] to them well of the seven seals are you
[1:58:29] gonna write another book that you've got
[1:58:30] a you know is it out
[1:58:31] the Bible says no it's sealed in the
[1:58:33] Bible it's all it's all from cover to
[1:58:37] cover right so now when so so when the
[1:58:40] message now releases the power that we
[1:58:43] will not be we will not go down into
[1:58:45] death like former ages or denominator
[1:58:48] and become a system but the life of God
[1:58:50] will be manifested in our people amen
[1:58:53] that will overcome all things now part
[1:58:56] of the remember a restoration means all
[1:58:59] things that restores it's not just the
[1:59:01] truth of the Bible is restored perfect
[1:59:04] home life is restored perfect marriages
[1:59:07] are restore perfect relationship between
[1:59:09] husband and wife is restored
[1:59:10] amen between children Alleluia the
[1:59:13] family unit that's part of the
[1:59:15] restoration glory to God now if that is
[1:59:20] the case he's come to take over because
[1:59:22] he's going to enforce everything in the
[1:59:24] document he's going to make sure it's
[1:59:27] lived amen it's like a peace treaty or a
[1:59:30] declaration of war what's the good of
[1:59:32] signing those things make it into an
[1:59:34] official document if you don't enforce
[1:59:36] what's in there that means nothing right
[1:59:39] so God has opened this word in this day
[1:59:41] and he is going to enforce now the
[1:59:44] contents what I have written and I'll
[1:59:46] release to you in this end time it's
[1:59:48] going to be lived out that's why he has
[1:59:51] come to take over because it's not us we
[1:59:53] cannot manufacture a Christian life I
[1:59:55] mean a sheikh does not does not
[1:59:58] manufacture wall at bears wall by the
[2:00:01] life that's in it
[2:00:02] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[2:00:04] you and I we're not called to
[2:00:06] manufacture it people have tried and
[2:00:08] they have blown up and failed I mean but
[2:00:11] it's types of people that do not
[2:00:13] manufacture the message but they bear it
[2:00:15] the life lives out of you and that's why
[2:00:18] you died on Calvary I want to take my
[2:00:20] life and put it in you and it's not by
[2:00:23] what you think you are it's what I've
[2:00:25] done that's why we've got to forget the
[2:00:29] things that are in the past that's one
[2:00:31] thing I do put that on your fridge find
[2:00:33] that scripture I think I have it in here
[2:00:34] somewhere
[2:00:35] yeah Philippians 3 and 13 because guilt
[2:00:40] bank guilt holds people back
[2:00:42] forget the guilt
[2:00:44] he cleans this of all things he with me
[2:00:48] I'm just gonna finish with this me but
[2:00:50] he say well how can he take over I'm in
[2:00:51] the state this is what I've done I
[2:00:53] member everything I did forget those
[2:00:55] things
[2:00:56] Paul said he blaspheme which is the an
[2:00:59] you know an unforgivable sin blessed
[2:01:03] fiend he said he said I was once a
[2:01:04] blasphemer he says this one thing I do
[2:01:08] so it doesn't matter you say well I
[2:01:10] failed here my family's gone this way
[2:01:13] this has happened
[2:01:14] my relationship with what Evers gone
[2:01:16] this way this one thing I do put this on
[2:01:20] the fridge you say well I feel so guilty
[2:01:23] no he died to take your guilt away
[2:01:25] taking my sin my cross my shame rising
[2:01:28] again I bless your name your my all and
[2:01:30] all this one thing I do forgetting those
[2:01:33] things which are behind who has a few
[2:01:36] things behind forget them this is this
[2:01:40] is good instruction and reaching forth
[2:01:44] unto those things which are before
[2:01:46] what's before me there's a body change
[2:01:49] once before me the salvation of my loved
[2:01:52] ones and family what's before me
[2:01:54] hallelujah look at that's why we don't
[2:01:57] we don't look at all these exceeding
[2:02:00] precious promises we spend so much time
[2:02:04] looking at all the exceeding negatives
[2:02:07] that aren't actually even allotted to us
[2:02:09] you know you get into a mindset of
[2:02:12] negative things and all this will never
[2:02:13] happen you know how's this gonna work
[2:02:15] and you know who's been there hello
[2:02:20] you're not meant to surround yourself
[2:02:21] with those things find every exceeding
[2:02:25] precious promise in the Bible just go
[2:02:28] from Genesis to Revelation amen
[2:02:31] and write those down they'll take a long
[2:02:37] time you've got a lot of them that go do
[2:02:40] it I do you because those are the things
[2:02:43] that we're reaching forth
[2:02:44] what are we reaching for those things
[2:02:46] which are before what are they every
[2:02:48] problem I mean how do you know you say
[2:02:52] well I don't know if those things are
[2:02:53] for me heavy have you looked at them
[2:02:57] this now clear some musicians to come I
[2:03:00] don't I don't you know I don't want to
[2:03:01] continue on a beam I've been long enough
[2:03:03] I think but we don't want to just look
[2:03:07] at this and casually just kind of read
[2:03:10] it through or even the message itself by
[2:03:12] the Browns thinking about this the
[2:03:14] vindicated you know Christ our heat chip
[2:03:18] is here he's paid the price he's raising
[2:03:20] up the head he says all the body in the
[2:03:22] devil can't standard he says the
[2:03:24] headship is here which is Christ he's
[2:03:26] uniting himself with a with the people
[2:03:28] with the body there's been a uniting
[2:03:30] this message unites Christ and you amen
[2:03:34] we are not ain't we we're not a
[2:03:36] dismembered body we've become one now if
[2:03:41] that's so and the Bible says but you
[2:03:43] have the mind of Christ with that so I'd
[2:03:46] say Lord I want to look at what what
[2:03:49] belongs to me in here hmm
[2:03:51] I mean look at what belongs to me in
[2:03:54] here and say Lord this is mine yeah I
[2:04:02] mean okay lipstick give me this mountain
[2:04:04] mm-hmm
[2:04:05] Joshua said remember the same the same
[2:04:09] God that spoke to Moses spoke to Joshua
[2:04:12] he says I've come to take over a forest
[2:04:15] sir against us no but I come as to kept
[2:04:17] them to the Lord's house and this Joshua
[2:04:18] saying I want that I want that promise
[2:04:23] amen and Joshua says it's yours you can
[2:04:29] have it and Joshua took it and he loved
[2:04:32] it amen
[2:04:35] how much more us say well me but time we
[2:04:43] always think but I've looked at these
[2:04:46] things for years don't worry forgetting
[2:04:49] the things that you're in the past now
[2:04:51] it's the time now is the season well
[2:04:54] then how do I get it that I lost mine
[2:04:56] make sure your will is dead amen because
[2:05:00] if you do it out of a will you can't
[2:05:02] step out of the boundaries of the word
[2:05:04] so you can't say I want this but is it
[2:05:06] in the word for me amen
[2:05:09] well there's not a haphazard walk
[2:05:11] God is very deliberate in his work and
[2:05:13] his walk and there's a protection in
[2:05:16] those things amen let's just and I'm
[2:05:19] just gonna but look into the script he's
[2:05:24] come to take over how's this see if
[2:05:26] we're gonna work out he's come to take
[2:05:27] over if someone else has taken over then
