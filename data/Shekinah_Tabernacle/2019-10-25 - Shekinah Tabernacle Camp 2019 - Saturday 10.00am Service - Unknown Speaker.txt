[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I feel like I'm in good company and I see I see a lot of familiar faces actually I know most of you if you few maybe that I haven't met but it feels really nice to see to see friends and to see believers to look out in the crowd and see see fellow laborers in the gospel to see the see redeemed ones the ones that the Lord's redeemed the ones as Lords the Lord loves and to see Christ and each one of you because that's what we that's what we look to we look to thee the unseen we don't really look at the scene like the sky here is the scene you know he makes a lot of mistakes and he messes up he does all these things but you know it's the unseen it's Christ's enemy hopefully that you can see cuz that's perfect that's great most of the time he's not overly great now and then I get it perfect but not often maybe you guys have more success than me but you know that's the that's how we overcome as believers with each other as when we see Christ in each other and we deal with the Christ and then in each other rather than the flesh you know everything just is just really really easy it's really found that it's not that hard you know the Christian walk is not hard when you just surrender to Christ and they live live very very easy you won every battle any circumstances just you know even when it's raining it's the sun shining when you work with Christ I mean so I'm just gonna open a prayer blessing that's just open a prayer first you can just stay seated Heavenly Father were so grateful that we can be here gathered here this morning Lord we are under

resting place all rested up right you want to get their exhaustion leave it all on the field man fight hard [Applause] go please and this song is called can you hear his voice I've put it into the system it should come up hopefully on the screen it's a song I wrote a few years ago and just it's been on my heart all week basically the song and then just some of the things that brother was ministering yesterday was in there as well and because we all got decisions to make all the time and to me that's the most important one is I want to know the Lord's mind I want to hear his voice in in my decisions I make and and there were some things in the ACA as well you got a die to yourself basically in what the Lord Jesus had to overcome was his own will and the will of men so you can have all these voices saying things but you got to listen to God's voice apart from all these other voices whether it's your own voice or someone else's voice and yeah so that and it might not be the most popular thing you know but praise the Lord him he came to be a servant of all that was what the Lord came for and and I think that's part of what we are here to do so yeah that's there was the inspiration of the song many years ago [Music] [Music] I mean find favor with God any men I mean it's just a nursing one or two worship songs before I invite brother beam up here this morning you deserve the [Music] and [Music] and [Music] [Music] you're like right [Music] Rico so great there is no one else like you there is no one else like you [Music] there [Music] [Applause] [Music] we can

people this morning my lord I praise well worship our lives or we give you thanks my lord Rock right now watch my Lord Jesus hallelujah glory hallelujah one atmosphere here I believe the Lord is going to do something special this morning and say Lord do what you want with me hallelujah Amy unless your Signet chorus just as brother cadre counts may God bless you all this is brother cadre caps in the pool for this morning [Music] to worship the Lord Jesus Christ he may have God has given us another day to be in divine presence and I pray you take full advantage of it amen you know it's good to be in camping and the camp atmosphere but most of all we want to see Jesus a man like Paul said we want to know him in the power of his resurrection he meant I don't want to just say I came to camp in camp was nice but I want to leave with something of God in my life maybe I want to leave with an increase a man again we thinking God for all of you and all of your prayers I feel good amen and my God is a healer and he has to fulfill this word God cannot lie and God cannot fail amen so I'm believing by the time we leave this camp my voice is gonna be stronger clearer amen you know let's just pray and we'll get into the Word of God a man if you have on his protocol question acknowledge to the Lord by uplifted hand amen let's pray Lord father truly you are awesome in this place and father we would ask ourselves where or what would we be if it wasn't for the grace of God nor we know without a shadow of a doubt most of us wouldn't be here but Lord you saw fit before the foundation of the world to play something divine presence Lord Lord to show us who we are and Lord not only that Lord reveal who you are to us so solo we thank you for times like this when we gather together with like precious faith in the presence of a supernatural being Lord and Lord God we pray father that you will just increase your presence on the reality of your presence Lord God that you will just prove yourself Lord as we gather around your word Lord Lord you let your word know it manifest itself in the hearts of the believer Lord in the minds and the spirits of the believer Lord that we would know that Christ was with us as we saw joined in his place Lord and Lord God will be careful to give you all glory all honor Lord Lord whatever we have is because you gave it Lord nor that none of us come with the mindset to be seen but know the only one we want to see as you know the only voice we want to hear is your voice so lord we pray father you would just be what you are and that's God just be God to us Lord for we are the clay and you're the Potter Lord and I'll continue to shape and mold us to the image of your mind and Lord make this meeting make this service today personal to the hearer Lord you know they understand what the Spirit is saying and all we give you all honor and glory and praise in a wonderful name of Jesus Christ the church amen they may have you have your Bibles let's go to First Samuel First Samuel amen it's maybe kind of late but brother when did y'all get a chance to plug up the monitors the floor monitors did y'all get a chance to get them going give me a little juice amen First Samuel chapter 16 and I'm gonna kind of read the scripture and then I'm gonna kind of go back with us a little bit after I get going by the grace of God first time he was 16 and let's not reading at verse 13 then we go to Matthew 7 the Bible says in first time year 16 chapter I mean verse first time in 16 verse 14 no that's not at 13 then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward and Samuel rose up and went to Rhema but the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him and Saul's servant said unto Him behold an evil spirit from God trouble at thee now look once the Spirit of God left Saul he didn't have to say anything the people around him saw that the evil spirit was on him now he saw his life begin to testify what kind of spirit was on him let's go to Matthew 7 Matthew 7 and verse 15 the Bible says beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves he shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns and fakes of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them a mail-order blessed reading of his word you can have your seats pretty I'll bear with me this morning I don't want to take my time and just deal with this by the grace of God cuz I want I want you young people to see the life this is my subject the life of the Spirit the life of the Spirit now we know that we are trying means there are three things that make us up as humans and that's children of God would you have a body a soul in the spirit but I like to call it in the correct order you have a soul spirit body but I don't necessarily want to deal with your soul and I don't want to deal with your body but I want to deal with your spirit this morning because if I could say it like this the nature the life of your soul if you're a child of God that's already self it's already settled God already knows who you are now you may be living in sin but that does not change the seed within you honey if you're a child of God one day it's going to connect with the word and the true representation of your soul is gonna come out honey but I want to deal with that in between ground the spirit honey and not let's say your body because your spirit is that place that controls your body honey and you your thought processing your actions and all these things it shows the life of what's going on inside and I want you to understand I want to be really playing today that there are only two spirits two spirits holy good and evil holy and unholy righteous and unrighteous honey there's no in-between ground even you're serving God or you're serving the enemy your life will tell me what kind of spirit is motivating you and your spirit is very important because even right now if you get in the right spirit you hear God but the wrong spirit motivates you you won't even hear what God is saying Church first things first the Bible says they that worship Him must worship in what spirit and truth why spirit and truth because of the vs. fnatic says because God is a spirit so you know a lot of times you know in my my son used to play football one thing they used to do before they come out they get together in a circle and they start chanting you know they start what they say they will start getting in my rights for the game what are they doing they're getting in the spirit of the game you know they're trying to block out everything they may have heard that this other team is really great and they beat all the teams 40 to zero but they're trying to get in the spirit to say that's not gonna happen to us they're gonna get in the spirit we are with us and we are not losers so they're trying to get their minds right by getting in the right spirit and I'm telling you it's very important that you get in the right spirit hug because what if I was to come out here today and I was just no matter what your experience is I look at you and I say man you're going to hell doesn't matter what you do you're going to hell that'll affect you because words have power you know what I like talking I like using games and sports for analogies you just take the the greatest rubber pair you got you know and he comes out he gathers the team he's hey guys hey guys hey mate you know what mate we're gonna get our butts whooped today but we're gonna go out here and take that with him what would that do for his team he's the best plan he's telling everybody else that we're gonna get whipped what would that do for the spirit of the team it would literally take the life out of the whole team if the best player they got doesn't have any courage but what if he comes out and he says hey mate we are unstoppable hey mate we're gonna beat this team like they've never been beat before and did he begin to rally and everybody rallies behind him what is he doing he's he doing that by his spirit but I want you to understand that your spirit represents a life you can come to church you can sing and you can do all these things but if your spirit ain't right we'll be able to feel the life behind your song y'all know me but everything there's a spirit you know I was one who didn't buy my girls Barbie dolls no there's some life behind Barbie and just in case you don't understand let's look at Barbie a little bit swimsuit Barbie catwalk Barbie disco Bobby girlfriend Bobby some kind of Filth Barbie is always representing a man so you imagine when you buy Barbie that the spirit behind that doll gets on your daughter and you wonder why she wants a bathing suit you wonder why she wants jewelry and necklaces and high-heeled shoes because she's looking at catwalk Bobby you wonder why she wants a boyfriend because she's the girlfriend of King there is life behind everything but if I can look at when God anointed David you know the Bible says that that death Samuel went down to the house of Jesse and he said hey you know God told me to come down here because the next king is in your house so you whole life is gonna change the way we live is don't change how closings gonna change everything about us is gonna change our name my reputation everything's gonna change cuz I'll son my son it's gonna be a king just hearing about his son being a king jesse was happy why because he knew the life of that spirit he knew the life behind of a king what it means to be a king he had Dominion yet subjects yet rulership yet power all these things he had authority with His Word and just hearing that one of his boys was going to be a king he called sassy to get in the spirit and what was Jesse doing Jesse was getting in the spirit of being the father of a king Wow he wasn't even a king but he got excited because he was a father looking even know which boy was but all he knew probably was dead the anointing always there now where's my boys hey says hey go get this one go get down she got the first one probably tall dark and handsome he comes out there just ready to be anointed I wish some of you young kings and queens here was ready to be anointed I wish you will recognize or realize who you are that you are royalty that there is a life behind your seat give me a little bit more but now Church you you look first son he comes out and he stands there ready to be anointed I wonder if there's anybody in here ready to be anointed ready to be anointed Josh the anointing is he not are you ready for the anointing the Bible already says that we are royalty with Kings who were children of the Most High God no don't you do it don't you do it he might look like he's anointed he might look like the son of a god he's dressed right he has the right statue but I refuse him why because it's spirit ain't right look he was in the same house as David he had the same upbringing of David honey honey but he couldn't meet the criteria of the life behind that anointing God was going to anoint somebody earlier whose life can demonstrate the spirit behind the anointing so he's refused he brought it walks out I came to church for this and sat down it ain't nothing happened next brother comes out oh I want you to understand all these boys had an expectation all these boys were polish saying oh it's my turn it's my turn the staining of the horn it's my turn to be anointed they didn't go in there with a spirit saying it's not me they went in there saying oh it's my turn it's me what about you this morning can you have an attitude that says maybe it's me today Lord maybe I'm the one maybe I'm the chosen one maybe I'm the chosen one and the only thing that's gonna tell me that I'm not the chosen one is if God refuses me but Church another brother come same thing haven't refused fuse and then God had to tell Samuel because I think Samuel was probably getting a little discouraged because he knew God told him to go down there now I want you to understand this what's happening in Davis house has never happened before the last time God told Samuel to go anoint somebody it happened verbatim and that was so there was nobody else to strive with or anything God said go down in anointing and Samuel went down he anointed Saul David and Saul was anointed by the same message they were anointed by the same messenger so you don't tell me I don't care all the foolishness going on about this message this message is true young people listen to me this message is true we don't worship brother Branham we worship the god of brother Branham so I don't care what they say by the Prophet it's too late he's introduced me to Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] hello so don't get caught up in nonsense this message made me who I am today cuz I didn't know God my spirit wasn't right but my mom got converted into this message and she brought this word back home to a house full of sinners and all of us are saved now hallelujah this message what is the message hey man Paul said and this is the message that we preach stop making the message brother branham brother Branham is not the message the message is Jesus Christ young people I want to bring you I want to introduce you to the message of the hour in the message of the hour is Jesus Christ hallelujah risen not crucified risen and he's alive to take he's still saving he's still encouraging he's still healing even though for the Brenneman's cold the message remains true hallelujah [Applause] [Music] and when you catch the life of the Spirit you realize that you are the message you the revelation of this hour you are the manifestation of what the Prophet preached where was the mighty God unveil he was unveiled in his church [Applause] the Prophet preached one in a million I'm looking at it the prophet priest the contest is going on in us the message is a person no no we're not some fanatical group and we're not we're not making a stand to fight against whoever no we love God we appreciate God's prophet but now it's my turn [Music] now it's our turn brother branham has scripture hallelujah yes scripture telling who he is and what he must do hallo revelations 10 7 but the book was opening there's more scripture to be fulfilled Revelation scene 7 is him and that has expired expired finish done kaput Ouma the prophet has come and go but now the rest of the scripture has to be fulfilled revelations in 8 to 11 now must prophesy again you must prophesy again what does that mean you must testify about Jesus Christ all over again [Applause] hallelujah but your spirit had to be right you're not gonna get there with the worship of a man you know I had to tell my kids they did things for me out of respect certain things they did they come to church and they look right they did everything right and when we will sit down and have half devotional family time we just have a one-on-one and I talk to them and ask them things about their life and they say well dad I don't answer that I don't know disrespect you I told my oldest Curtis I said look I appreciate you respecting me I appreciate you not wanting to do things oh yeah that you're doing in my sight I appreciate that you know that is that's love that means holy that they respect you they know what you have is real early so when your child is confessing to you that ain't the time for you to get super religious and condemn them to hell that's the time for you to hold their hands and say son daughter I got your back I got your back I don't care what the church people say about you you are my child and I believe that you are his child and God can bring us through this we've done people make mistakes we bring them before the whole congregation and confess your false confess tell me what that means god never makes a public spectacle out of his people God is a God of love he's a God of grace and he don't put us before the church so we can be embarrassed because you think about it if God was magnified the most righteous person in here will see something wrong with your life he magnified the preachers the Deacons the song leaders or whatever whoever you think is young people whoever you think is more spiritual than you trust me he has a repent every day I have to repeat I have thanks God for forgiveness it's the grace of God keeping me so don't you never feel unworthy by your struggles just get your spirit right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the devil will come and accuse you I want you to tell the devil yeah I did it but confer gave me yeah I'm cutie but the grace of God sets me free come on somebody come on somebody do you know what crisis the enemy will come young people holy adults you come and condemn you by your actions God honey never chose us about what we were going to do he chose us about what we're going to be he didn't choose me based upon my strength or based upon my knowledge or based upon how great my mind is he chose me because I came from him and I go back to him he chose me because why you can see this representation down inside of me even when I was in the nightclub I had the gene of God inside of me that young man that got up and testified even though he had problems with his flesh he was watching pornography he still had the gene of God inside of it there's no amount of sin that can stop you from coming into what God has for you so stop looking for a pity party they follow your knees is the Lord here am i anoint me anoint me to be the ruler you designed me to be anoint me right now I can close right here I goes right here if you just get in the spirit of the word right here in this moment and receive God in your life right here they don't take our preaching for God to deal with us [Applause] what I love about God he knows we're gonna fall short he knows we're gonna make mistakes that's why he gave his blood so when the devil comes hunting us he comes running to you saying you did this he comes trying to tear down your character what's your name says Chloe imagine the devil comes to God last night she was watching some things she should have been watching and because Chloe has accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as her Savior God listened to the devil and did he says I don't hear nothing you sing what are you talking about talking about you don't see Chloe like I see Chloe I see Chloe redeemed by the blood of the Lamb it doesn't matter what your mind says it doesn't matter what people may say all you need to know is that God has already made a way for you to be what he wants you to be whoo yeah yeah I did wrong but God fixed it oh yeah not by power not by might but by my what spirit save the Lord yeah I can feel it you know what's happening right now I want you to do I want you to realize we're all three of you to realize that Satan does not belong in your mind he does not belong in your ear that's that way he's scripturally placed the Bible says he belongs under your feet that's where he under your feet so you did it in spirit you dance on the devil you stop on the devil you stop on your home's you stop on saying you stop on unhappiness stop listening to a lying spirit if Satan comes to you and tell you that you're not a daughter of God all you can do is tell lies [Applause] anything he can say is the exact opposite of the truth so he says you're not a child of God he's lying that must mean I am a child of God [Applause] the Lord is worthy I said the Lord is worthy I said the Lord is worthy of all the praise of all the worship of all the hand clapping there's a life there's a spirit in here this morning they may read something to you oh my put that quote up starting at verse 53 paragraph 53 hallelujah in the message of oneness of unity listen I want you to catch this he says now when the meetings going on is there a meeting going on so what I'm saying hallelujah was not just for 1958 not just for 1958 Minister Brennan Harley but 2019 Minister Deeks are we having a meeting I want you to realize will you catch the message in the right tone it's really prophecy God has gave us instructions on how to defeat the devil he's given us instructions on how to have a good meeting listen she says now in the meetings going on and evil spirits in the meeting that spirit is almost harmless until it can catch somebody that it can work through the devil is harmless unless he got somebody in here to use now I don't know about you but he's not gonna use me he's not gonna use me my life belongs to God he's not gonna use me hallelujah so I have the ability to make the devil powerless we can make the devil in every evil spirit powerless this morning you can make him powerless on this side of the room you can making powerless on this side of the room and on that side of the room I want you to look at your neighbor look at your neighbor and tell your neighbor he's not gonna use me he's not who you speak he's not go use me I said the devil is not gonna use me [Applause] hallelujah oh gee I want somebody to patent a feet bet your feet you hear that sell that's the sound of Satan's neck in stunting that's the sound of triumph that's the sound of victory that's the sound of deliverance that's the sound of a mighty army of God coming forward that's the sound of the Bride of Christ he's not gonna use me [Applause] don't you look around you see all these people only feet dancing and shouting there's something going on in there spirit if you don't feel what we feel there's another life trying to get controlling you because if the Spirit of God lays on you God loves to be worshipped you can't help but worship [Applause] because God is the object of worship [Music] somebody say hallelujah hallelujah somebody say hallelujah [Applause] listen there's some things I want to call before I get out of here but I want to put the service in your hands I wanna put your life back in your hands stop saying the devil made me do it he can't make you do nothing you don't want to do he can't make you do nothing you have to give him permission he is almost harmless until he can find her get something to work through listen then when it can work through it certainly do damage because it's an evil spirit so Satan can get in your spirit is definitely going to do damage because it's evil so he knows if he can get you to believe that you're lost get you to believe that you're a homosexual or you're a lesbian when you begin to get that stuff in your spirit it will do damage why because there's an evil spirit since we're here let's address it these spirits are traveling around the world you got all these different communities you know and they say you can't talk about this you can't talk about that well if it's in the Bible I got a right to talk about it [Applause] fathers let me help you out don't succumb to the pressure when your boy comes in he says I don't know my identity if your boy comes he says well dad I don't know you know I kind of look at guys and I think I like guys sometimes I look at girls and I just don't know what's going on with me you know what I want you to do I want you to grab your boy by the hand I want you to pull them up I want you to put them in the mirror and say son look in the mirror what do you see what do you see when you look in the mirror what do you see do you see a man or a woman what you see is what you are God can't make no mistakes [Applause] you don't have to wonder about what you are or your feelings and all these things all you need to do is see the reflection of the image you look in the mirror you see a man I'll tell you you're a man the only thing that's happening is seining is trying to pervert your mind he's trying to give your spirit to get you to believe something that you did not see about what you feel God is not a God of feelings bunch of nonsense [Applause] I got to hit the spirit I'm feeling but you take sexual you know in the states they were fighting against bathroom means ridiculous you say buddies why's that ridiculous because you take a lesbian who gets all her rights to be able to go to the men's bathroom it does she feel liberated when she get in there no all of her mind when she gets in that bathroom she has a reality check because although she fought to be able to do what to me and do because she feels like a man when she gets access to that bathroom by the agent and she gets in there she uses it just like a woman so even though the enemy is telling her you're a man she's still hungry represents a woman that shows that the enemy is lying to her she don't feel liberated I'm going to use it like a woman that shows she's living a lie same thing with a man I keep going I get to go in the bathroom with the other girls and then he gets in there and he's looking for a stand up stall Wow cuz his mind didn't change the reality of who he is [Applause] and mothers what you need to do when your daughters come to you and they say Oh mom I'm so confused I don't know I got I got so many good girlfriends and I think I'm just falling in love with Becky preaching and a girl is telling me I'm a lesbian I say did you hear what you just said you told me the devil is telling you you're a lesbian not God God would never tell you you're something that you're not God can only tell you truth that's why when God comes he says your holy nation arroyo bristle your fearfully and wonderfully made that's what we're doing this morning cuz last night you was kind of tight but yous making your choice holy but I want you to drive your stake down today and I want you to refuse to be used by the devil I want you to stop looking at your past and look at your future they say well sis why do you say you but my girlfriends are always there for me they comfort me in my time of hurt my time of loneliness snap out of it that's what a good friend is supposed to do they're supposed to be there when you're hurting they're supposed to be there in your time of need but you're not supposed to freshly fall in love with him you're supposed to fall in love with that I believe she's married to a man will not be used by the devil I'm sorry don't blame this on me y'all pull it listen he said trying to find somebody to work through and when it finds somebody to work through it can do good I said the Holy Spirit just like the devil needs somebody to work through he says and the Holy Spirit is here trying to find somebody to work through the Holy Spirit is looking for somebody to use the Holy Spirit is looking for somebody now you can say I want to be used I want to be used by the holy spirit Here I am God have your way with me see the two spirits their motives objective watch how it is watch their works watch their fruit then you can see what spirit is on you right now in this service you can tell what kind of spirit is on you by the fruit you're bearing as I preach that's the Holy Ghost that's the Holy Ghost moving in the room that's the Holy Ghost that's the Holy Ghost I said that's the Holy Ghost I see the fruits I feel the fruits that's the whole ego that's the Holy Ghost you know what that was all those years ago that healed you from being able to eat dairy and swallow dairy that promise is still true today let him use you he's still the same god I want to be used [Applause] don't you feel how the Holy Ghost is electrifying [Applause] [Music] some of y'all wanna cut loose but you're holding it somebody out feel the joy you feel the expression of the Spirit of God moving but you're still trying to control it do you like the way let God have you let God have you this morning thank God have you just monitor stop trying to control the spirit Oh God still small voice yes but in that scripture before he got to that still small voice he was an earthquake the Bible says and God begins to move and there was an earthquake and God began to move and there was a fire and God began to move and there was a mighty rushing when so it was God moving that caused the earthquake it was God moving that called the fire it was not moving that caused the mightier in of rushing wind holy it was God he did all that to get to the still small voice because that was how he wanted to speak to Elijah but to Moses he was a fire on mouth sorry I he was an earthquake and on the day of Pentecost [Music] he was a mighty rushing wind [Music] so yeah I love the since my voice but I also like a earthquake I also like a fire I also like a rushing wind cuz out of that is God moving in the midst of his people [Applause] hallelujah listen 57c the two spirits their motors objectives watch how it is watch their works watch their fruit then you can see what spirit is on you now I don't know about y'all but I feel something more [Applause] I feel something on me oh yeah and it don't make me wanna do wrong hallelujah I feel something on me that wants to express him hey listen he says you are motivated by spirit if you have no spirit you are gay so if you have no emotion you have no excitement for the word of God that means the life of the Spirit that's on you is dead you are dead there's no life in you but if you can rejoice but if you can give God praise but if you can celebrate him the prophet the prophet said that science and one just automatically follow the believer I don't have to do nothing brother Stu there just already behind me signs and wonders are behind me this morning everywhere I go the supernatural is behind me because they automatically follow the believer I feel some delivers behind me I feel some salvation behind me I feel some joy behind me I feel some healing behind me oh this is so feeling this atmosphere because most of New Zealand halia or even Oakland have a history lesson it was developed and built on top of earthquakes I mean on top of volcanoes with standing on volcanoes so that might mean that might mean is time for an eruption it's time for the rug hug time for the final foul listen take me to UM take with you no more than fifty to believe in God starting at paragraph 201 listen before I close already everybody pay attention listen this is the prophet speaking prophecy he's telling us exactly what happens in service and the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 let's start with stop don't read no more look at me how many of you over 12 so you have no excuse God can deal with you at the age of 12 years old so if you're older than 12 you have no excuse listen he says the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old because a spirit hung over me hey devil so if you are not safe today is because it's a devil hindering you I want to make this real plain you're sitting in church right now and you don't want to give your life to God I'll tell you you're being entertained by a demon you're dancing with an evil spirit the only thing that can keep you from coming forward with God is an evil spirit and if you're sitting here and you have no desire for God oh you think that's just a bunch of emotion it's evil spirits hanging over you remember remember I said I didn't want to deal with your soul or your body I want to deal with your spirit right here at 12 years old he still was a prophet being anointed by an evil spirit at 12 years old he still was the prophet of the age [Applause] come on let's play some Connect four what's your next move it's time to make your choice remember if you choose wrong in monopoly you're gonna go to jail I'm one of those people hallelujah I let God leave me so when I play I bow on I buy everything about my joy back about my piece about my children by my job my house about everything so you step on my property it's whatsoever I see you playing with me you were getting to roll everything you because while we were playing I made the right choice he'll or something back especially for this moment God is he'll back a bride especially for this moment especially for this last generation the /search age God has held back and my role was too loud just beside me she was shouting my ears nope can't blame nobody else you're over 12 you hit the age of accountability you can't blame it on nobody else if you walk out of here without the Spirit of God in your life you're testifying [Music] remember God is so good look how this Tynan with the message last night and I can't do things like that is the Lord see he's giving you an opportunity to be filled as you make your choice he's giving you opportunity so that he may empower you so if you walk out of here you know a devil hanging over you with all your reasoning if you with the opportunity to be able to accept God right now without money without price all you have to do is say I accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Savior Lord fill me with the Holy Spirit [Applause] but if you walk out of here and you say I feel so unworthy that's the good part about grace you know you're not worthy but God does it anyway that's what he's told [Applause] [Applause] please don't turn the blood Hallowes remember we said when it comes to the devil we all said I will not be used so if you saying right now you're trying to wheezing yourself out of this quote you know and you think that brother getting up talking about pornography he was the only one know what God was doing he was addressing the spirit and he wanted a little all you other boys know that you too can be delivered [Music] and remember huh you will be so gullible sometime it's not just the boys the girls are doing the same thing oh yeah they own their phones doing the same stuff pornography does not have boundaries why do we bother here with that same condemnation because the spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer that's what he's trying to do he's trying to tell some of you you got where do you get about 30 you get about 30 you'll be all right you couldn't done everything you wanted to do let me say like this if you make it to 30 she I love to have the kind of life spiritual life that my momma had young people can you imagine staying in a house with somebody that's gonna tell you your next move before you do it y'all my mom would come up to me and say boy God gave me a vision or dream that he was gonna do such and such and such and I hear what she said and go do exactly what she said well because God was showing her in my life let me take you in my world I love it I can't remember a time when I was robbed with my mom this is after I had cancer after I God healed me from cows unravel her in the car was riding through parkland she's driving real slow driving so slow let's get on let's go get this I know she's sometimes you look at your parents you wonder what they doing just be a little patient you know we riding and next thing you know coming through the parking lot and a car just backs out she sounds low brakes like she knew that calls me to back out and I'm sitting there like and she says thank you Lord that was the car I was supposed to hit God has mothers and fathers who are looking out for you they're standing in the gap because there are things that you're supposed to hear for their plans I'm putting up barricades so much I would say mama please ain't you got three other kids don't you dream about dental chair vision by death she said yeah but right now is your time Church hi my brother right above me he was a rat phonetic rights and rights of music back when we had the booming systems yet fifteen in the back of his car you can hear him miles away before you got to the help it would be like oh you come dick she can't pray she kept watching she's got playing see what worried about the rap music she was worried about the promise the promise had huh the Holy Ghost is unto you and on to your children [Applause] Church he was the kind of person when the new album came out he was down at the store before it opened up very technical radios I remember one time yeah oh jukebox hooked up in his car he's a bad boy now the church and one day one day I wasn't there but my mom told me honey one day he came to her with a crane and crates and crates full of music and he came say hey mom huh he got all my music I don't need this no more what was it he saw in life we saw in life we saw God rap the hot skin we saw the Holy Spirit using somebody listen he says wait a little while that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of capability if you hear today you've been in these meetings these kind of meetings before or even in your church the reason why you're not saved is because a devil hung over you coat it if you walk out of here and you don't feel the persons of God in your life there's a demon give up give up to say lord help me cuz I can't help myself [Applause] listen any spirit you got in the crowd and that hovered over you and kept you hanging and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got his right mind but what wants to do right but there is something won't let you do right is that right the congregation says that's the devil [Applause] Christ paid your healing and your salvation [Applause] come on magician something too close come on recess I'm closing now say that to say if you're here and you feel like you got struggles with distance struggles with that and and all these things going on let me tell you something God purposely gave me this message cuz he knew you was gonna be here with all your struggles with all your doubts with all your unbelief God still came to tell you you belong to him you are his child and God still in all of your imperfections with all your doubts with all your mistakes God still came with a word of grace saying let me use you does anybody want to be used don't walk out of here before I close another scripture the Bible says when a house is garnished and swept and clean and the unclean spirit is cast out he says that spirit earlier goes through Dry places seeking rest so the devil is no good without a house once you make that confession that demon has to leave has to leave once you make that confession he has to leave then you say Lord I invite you into my life your house is no good empty cause the devil are go seeking dry places you go seeking places holy areas in your life that you're unhappy with and you come back if your house is not protected [Music] I want you to realize God and I'm not boasting I'm not gonna give the devil credit but I must say something and I want y'all to know how great my god is I used to listen to rap music I used to do all the things in the world I used to club but one day one day I invited Jesus into my life one day it was more than just a church service it became a reality and I accepted the Lord as my savior and God came in and God began to kick everything else out he can't grab music he kicked us out he kick all the sinful things I didn't do it God did it and he's still the same God today they can do it for you will not be used by the devil I will be used by God I'll be
