[38:13] see if that slideshows going I mean I
[38:23] trust everyone's had a good week happy
[38:27] birthday brother Martin look a 10 we're
[38:32] going to read verses 9 downwards to eat
[38:35] do we have that going should be open
[38:45] if not well we just do it old school and
[38:47] read from our Bibles so we gonna look 8
[38:51] don't worry if it's not there it's not
[38:53] there let's go to Luke 8 in verses 9 and
[38:57] we're gonna read down to verse 15 so
[39:02] Luke 8 and verse 9 there's a parable of
[39:04] the of the sower look a didn't own and
[39:11] there's disciples
[39:12] oh wait something's happening Oh we'll
[39:15] just read it and his disciples asked him
[39:17] saying what might this parable be
[39:19] speaking of the parable of the sower and
[39:22] he said unto you it is given to know the
[39:24] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to
[39:27] others in parables seeing they might not
[39:30] see hearing they might not understand
[39:32] now the parable now we're doing over
[39:37] here
[39:38] okay now the parable is this the seed is
[39:41] the word of God those by the wayside are
[39:46] they that hear then the devil cometh and
[39:48] taketh away the words out of their
[39:49] hearts least they should believe and be
[39:52] saved and they on the rock well that
[39:56] doesn't quote sorry about the formatting
[39:59] and they on the rocker they which hear
[40:01] receive the word with joy and these have
[40:04] no root yet for a while
[40:06] belief and in times of temptation fall
[40:09] away and they which among the thorns are
[40:12] they which when they have heard go forth
[40:15] and are choked with cares and riches and
[40:19] pleasures of this life and bring no
[40:22] fruit to perfection but that on the good
[40:25] ground are they which in an honest and
[40:28] good heart having heard the word keep it
[40:31] and bring forth fruit with patience and
[40:35] we're just going to read another
[40:36] scripture from Luke if we go back to
[40:37] Luke chapter 4 this may seem a bit
[40:44] unrelated but we're just gonna I'm just
[40:45] gonna read this here and Jesus this
[40:49] after Jesus has been baptized by John
[40:51] and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[40:54] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[40:57] spirit into the will
[40:58] being forty days tempted of the devil
[41:01] and in those days he did eat nothing and
[41:03] when they were ended he afterward
[41:06] hungered and the devil said unto him if
[41:08] thou be the Son of God command the stone
[41:11] that it be made bread and jesus answered
[41:14] him saying it is written that man shall
[41:16] not live by bread alone but by every
[41:19] word of God now we know his tim-tim that
[41:22] a couple of times but the same time we
[41:23] won't read them when it comes down to
[41:25] this first and when the devil had ended
[41:28] all the temptation he departed from him
[41:31] for a season a season he didn't just
[41:35] quit he came back made a little Bliss's
[41:38] word you may have your seats this
[41:39] morning in the presence of the Lord
[41:40] what do this this may seem very unusual
[41:44] but I mean maybe some unusual scriptures
[41:47] for you I want to go but I yeah I heard
[41:49] a I heard a message from from overseas
[41:51] on the power of the third Pole and I
[41:54] heard the last part of it this week and
[41:56] it really struck me and I wanted maybe
[41:58] I'm not going to repeat what was said
[42:00] but I want to have try and bring it this
[42:02] way you know we have the greatest weapon
[42:04] that's ever been you know you see in the
[42:07] natural there's an arms race between
[42:09] America and between Russia and China
[42:11] there's an arms race going on with their
[42:13] intercontinental ballistic missiles and
[42:15] different things that they are
[42:16] developing there's an arms race one is
[42:19] trying to outdo the other but in the
[42:21] spiritual realm
[42:22] there is no arms race because we have
[42:24] the greatest weapon it cannot be
[42:26] improved upon it cannot be fashioned a
[42:28] bit better it cannot be made better in
[42:30] any way it is the greatest weapon and
[42:32] you can go from this side of the
[42:34] universe I don't know where we are in
[42:36] the universe in terms of up and down
[42:38] left or right but you go to one inch to
[42:40] the other searched every planet searched
[42:42] every star searched every galaxy
[42:43] searched every wherever and every
[42:46] dimension you'll not find a greater
[42:49] weapon than what we have received amen
[42:52] it doesn't need improving right we have
[42:54] the latest technology holy and it is the
[42:57] best this word we have received is the
[43:00] greatest weapon and it will defeat Satan
[43:03] any place any time anywhere hallelujah
[43:07] and the Prophet told us that the message
[43:10] the entire message
[43:11] in time conditions right every time
[43:15] there's an end time comes upon the earth
[43:17] there's an end time the day of Noah the
[43:18] word he received meat in time conditions
[43:20] what he and his house was saved the the
[43:23] door was open to all anyone could have
[43:25] gone in amen
[43:27] but the people who decided to go and
[43:29] wind in and they were saved hallelujah
[43:30] and every time there's a junction is a
[43:33] change in time the word comes and it
[43:35] meets the challenge of the day I mean so
[43:38] we don't need to be worried what we're
[43:40] facing this weapon we have this word of
[43:43] God we have received is the greatest
[43:46] weapon hallelujah now brother Brown says
[43:50] I'm just gonna you know I'm gonna read
[43:56] this I'm just gonna go from here
[43:57] sorry so brother Branham speaks and
[43:59] looking away to Jesus and he's speaking
[44:02] about the manifestation of the third
[44:04] Pole now we know the third pole is the
[44:05] opening of the word but whenever the
[44:07] word comes open a power is released amen
[44:11] we understand every time the word comes
[44:13] open and any age it comes open a powers
[44:15] released for the believers that receive
[44:17] that word will manifest the promise of
[44:20] the age you go back into Moses as day
[44:22] they were all slaves as Rael was all
[44:24] slaves but a word came open right a
[44:27] promise came open it was no longer a
[44:29] prophecy but now was becoming lived in
[44:31] front of them that Israel would not stay
[44:33] in Egypt they will go to their
[44:34] inheritance of the promised land and
[44:36] when the word came open it gave them
[44:38] power to receive their inheritance right
[44:41] God said God said I will drive them out
[44:44] little by little amen I'll fight the
[44:46] battles but you have to go in and
[44:47] possess the land right but it was God
[44:49] fighting for them hallelujah Caleb was a
[44:52] slave Joshua a slave but the word came
[44:55] open they heard more than Moses the man
[44:57] they went caught up in the humanity of
[44:59] Moses they heard the voice behind the
[45:01] voice they recognized this was the God
[45:03] of Abraham was now working in their day
[45:05] and they received that word and it gave
[45:07] them power caleb was 84 years old he
[45:10] says I'm 84 years old but I have the
[45:13] same strength as I did the day I came
[45:14] out of Egypt now give me my mountain
[45:17] hallelujah and it should be the same
[45:19] thing with you and I we should say God
[45:21] give me my mountain
[45:23] my inheritance I don't just want to run
[45:25] around I don't want to just wander
[45:26] around I want what you have in your word
[45:29] for me I don't want to sit back anymore
[45:31] I'm happy to see other people receive
[45:33] their inheritance but give me my
[45:34] Mountain hallelujah
[45:37] why because the word came open what is a
[45:39] revival and Awakening and The Awakening
[45:42] is to the promise of the age hallelujah
[45:45] it's just like the you know the galaxies
[45:47] the Sun Moon and stars out there it's
[45:50] only been in this you know well a couple
[45:53] of hundred years but especially these
[45:55] last modern era where we can see beyond
[45:58] our galaxies into the far reaches of
[46:00] space and they can you know but the
[46:02] stars are always there the moons are
[46:04] always here the planets were there
[46:05] they're discovering planets around stars
[46:08] because they have the technology to see
[46:10] them they were always there but man has
[46:14] developed the optics to see it and it's
[46:17] the same thing the promises are here
[46:20] right the word this is the full
[46:22] revelation of Jesus Christ right it's
[46:24] been there the whole time but God had to
[46:27] send a prophet with the prophet optics I
[46:29] mean to actually show you this is what
[46:31] you're looking at I said it just
[46:32] presuming saying well I guess it means
[46:34] this is maybe this will happen
[46:35] I mean God sent some optics in this day
[46:38] so we can look into the word he says
[46:40] this is what the promises are this is
[46:42] who you are in Christ this is where
[46:44] you're going hallelujah amen
[46:48] people have been looking through the bar
[46:50] looking at the Bible for 2,000 years
[46:52] wondering what it means it's like they
[46:54] look up at the stars what does this all
[46:56] you know what is this all here did they
[46:58] get the right optics and they see it
[47:00] hallelujah
[47:01] now he sees about the manifestation of
[47:04] the third pole because of when the word
[47:06] as I said when the word comes open to a
[47:08] people it releases a power you see on
[47:10] the day of Pentecost Jesus preached for
[47:12] three and a half years and the word that
[47:14] he sowed into the disciples I mean god
[47:17] quick in that word and then at birth the
[47:19] book of Acts church hallelujah where the
[47:22] people were not bowed by the pressure of
[47:23] the age they are not bad by the
[47:25] political pressure or the religious
[47:27] pressure the threats of man they weren't
[47:30] worried about that they said who should
[47:31] we please your God it's very simple
[47:34] if God's fall showing us this
[47:37] and it's changed our lives it's not just
[47:39] empty words but it's a reality to us
[47:41] what are we gonna do tell me
[47:45] hallelujah as I said last week Mary was
[47:51] the only one there when the angel spoke
[47:53] to her it didn't validate her testimony
[47:57] hallelujah but a testimony manifested
[48:00] she had the child she had the Christ
[48:03] child and the vindication she had the
[48:05] Christ shoulders the Upper Room happened
[48:07] God came down and filled his people
[48:09] hallelujah
[48:10] so you know it's whenever the word comes
[48:13] open and now the seven thunders that
[48:15] were hidden john was commanded not to
[48:17] write them in the days of the voice of
[48:18] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[48:20] sound them it all that the mystery of
[48:22] God should be finished so it's no longer
[48:23] a thunder it's a voice I mean when Jesus
[48:26] was upon the earth and he said Gluck
[48:28] yeah I've glorified thy name and here's
[48:31] a voice from heaven saying I've
[48:32] glorified it now glorified again some
[48:35] heard of thunder some heard a voice I
[48:37] mean so those who the Thunder they
[48:39] didn't understand it but those who heard
[48:40] the voice understood it right there's no
[48:42] longer a thunder no more I mean it's a
[48:44] voice we know what the scripture says
[48:48] hallelujah so when it comes open it
[48:51] produces a power it releases a power to
[48:54] those who believe it it will produce
[48:56] what it's promised to do it's a brother
[48:58] Branham says now and so when he speaks
[49:00] about the vindication of the third pole
[49:02] he speaks about the tumor being spoken
[49:04] out of his wife side causes that to
[49:07] disappear yeah the squirrels to be
[49:09] created the storm to be spoken out of
[49:12] existence is afoot you know the fish you
[49:15] know the life to come back into the
[49:16] little fish I mean his five deals five
[49:18] what he call it vindications of the
[49:21] spoken word okay now any season if
[49:26] Christ lives in me this isn't looking
[49:28] away to Jesus and if Christ lives in me
[49:30] the works of Christ you'll do right it's
[49:34] it's got to be and what does Christ the
[49:37] word he said if you abide in me my word
[49:40] in you then ask what you will it'll be
[49:43] done because the word is in there
[49:46] just needs the light and the light makes
[49:48] it live so now I'm going to say
[49:50] something to you
[49:51] now that I haven't see it all along and
[49:54] that is the thing that we have looked
[49:56] forward to for so long at least many
[49:59] years four or five years maybe longer
[50:01] the third poll has now been vindicated
[50:03] and I'm sure you know what it is now
[50:06] remember that they'll never be an
[50:09] impersonation of that cuz it can't be
[50:11] see it cannot be now it's in existence
[50:15] and I have I am warned of this that soon
[50:18] right at this time now it's just
[50:20] happened so it could identify its
[50:23] presence among you see but it but it
[50:26] will not be used in a great way until
[50:29] the council begins to tighten up and
[50:31] when it does the Pentecostals and so
[50:34] forth can almost impersonate anything
[50:36] that can be done but when that time
[50:39] comes when the squeeze comes down then
[50:42] you'll see what you've seen temporarily
[50:44] will be manifested in the fullness of
[50:48] its power hallelujah so a tumor if I
[50:54] knows the story amen his wife meet he
[50:57] had a had a tumor they went to the
[50:59] doctors you know it started to get
[51:00] bigger and bigger and bigger got to the
[51:02] size of a grapefruit and then brother
[51:04] bran wasn't even where she was she was
[51:06] going to go to the surgery she were and
[51:08] then the power God came down upon the
[51:10] Prophet and and and under an inspiration
[51:13] he just said Lord when the surgeon goes
[51:14] to cut mate disappear and the surgeon
[51:17] goes to cut and then the tumor
[51:19] disappeared amen and he was all
[51:22] mystified looks at the x-rays again
[51:24] looks at her where's it gone a tumor the
[51:26] size of a grapefruit is not a small
[51:28] thing I mean but God came down and
[51:31] caused that God moved upon the Prophet
[51:34] right to speak the word and the tumor
[51:38] disappeared that's like the same with
[51:40] the storm
[51:41] the storm was spoken her existence the
[51:43] scrolls were created many things happen
[51:45] whatever he said that's just a temporary
[51:47] manifestation but when the squeeze comes
[51:50] down you know we're living in that time
[51:53] amen our you know where we are living in
[51:57] the time there's a there's a religious
[51:59] persecution there's a pressure come on
[52:01] what's it the squeeze is tightening down
[52:04] as I've said about the Jews they didn't
[52:07] wake up one day they were walking on the
[52:09] street nothing wrong the next morning
[52:10] they wake up in Auschwitz no there was a
[52:13] squeeze there was a progression of
[52:15] events and they were getting tightened
[52:17] down and then eventually there in the
[52:18] Holocaust they were in the concentration
[52:20] camps and that was just a natural
[52:22] squeeze amen
[52:24] but we're living in a time of a
[52:26] supernatural squeeze where demon powers
[52:28] released I mean to try and make us
[52:30] disbelieve the word to try and make us
[52:32] shut up to try and make us sit down to
[52:35] try and make us compromise to try and
[52:37] make us quit to try make us give up our
[52:39] Lord Jesus I mean but I say this bride
[52:41] will not be bound she will not be been
[52:44] she will not be she will not cower I
[52:46] mean because we're like we've been
[52:48] restored to the original and the
[52:50] original said what's better sorry please
[52:52] go out a policeman I'm going to please
[52:54] God I'm in the same God that called me
[52:56] out of being a drunk at university I
[52:58] mean is the same drivers lead me today
[53:00] police I will not bow I will not let it
[53:03] become common to me I'm going to press
[53:05] the battle hallelujah and it should be
[53:07] the same thing with you and I this word
[53:09] should make us thrill us more we should
[53:12] love for more we should rejoice it
[53:14] anymore and should never become common
[53:16] and she never just become casual or
[53:18] something we've always done but as word
[53:20] should be richer it should be greater it
[53:22] should be stronger it should be more
[53:24] wonderful hallelujah
[53:27] shouldn't it be their way well I've
[53:29] heard it all all before now God's going
[53:31] to quick in it he's gonna make it alive
[53:33] because it was alive to you you may hear
[53:36] it a million times but there millions
[53:38] Tom will be greater than the first time
[53:40] hallelujah just like hearing a baddy
[53:42] died on Calvary I need some mana to hear
[53:44] brother our mind otherwise I'm gonna
[53:45] blow I mean amen well it's like it's
[53:49] like when you hear about the cross has
[53:51] it become common to those who know it
[53:53] happened for you I mean that when you
[53:55] know he really died for you it's not
[53:57] just a story it's not just a nice idea
[54:00] it's not someone's enthusiasm but you
[54:03] know he wins for you hallelujah
[54:05] it's not common it's not something that
[54:07] you just know it's a reality
[54:10] hallelujah please help me home and I
[54:12] need something
[54:13] Oh amen I'm not gonna tell you to be
[54:18] quiet
[54:19] by the way hey this is a heartfelt
[54:21] religion you say this is just all
[54:23] emotion love is an emotion but you have
[54:27] the love and it produces the emotion
[54:29] right it's not just an empty feeling
[54:31] it's a reality brother Ram said I
[54:34] believe in a heartfelt religion I do too
[54:37] hallelujah love love is a substance it's
[54:41] something real hallelujah amen so now if
[54:45] we are we are living in a day we have to
[54:47] come to a come to a conclusion amen if
[54:51] God be for us who can be against us if
[54:55] God be for you who can be against you
[54:58] nothing can be against you nothing can
[55:01] stop you if God is for you it's God for
[55:03] you what did he die whew yes he died for
[55:06] me
[55:06] did he redeem me within he's for me can
[55:08] he heal me yes he's for me hallelujah if
[55:11] God be for us who can be against us I
[55:13] meant God is not some angry angry
[55:16] godless wanting to punish you how there
[55:19] many times things go funny in our lives
[55:21] we think all God's just angry at us
[55:22] God's not angry
[55:23] what's God angry at job God was pleased
[55:25] with Jove he's a perfect man is known
[55:28] else like him upon the earth he's a
[55:30] perfect man holy and God was pleased
[55:32] with Jove and he allow the trial to come
[55:35] because God knew that Joubert confidence
[55:38] in the land hallelujah and that's why
[55:41] God allows things to come against us
[55:42] just like Jesus the fullness of Godhead
[55:45] bodily was in him here was all of heaven
[55:48] was in a man and Satan comes in tempts
[55:51] them you know that's why God moves and
[55:54] the Devils on our case well that
[55:56] scriptural pattern we shouldn't be
[55:58] surprised
[55:59] he gets filled with the full all of God
[56:02] comes and pours into him after he gets
[56:03] baptized and then the spirit leads him
[56:05] out to be tempted hallelujah and then
[56:08] sometimes the devil comes against us we
[56:10] go oh what's going on these things have
[56:12] to be shouldn't be surprised
[56:14] hallelujah if our bridegroom had to
[56:18] enjoy the same things we will endure the
[56:20] same things
[56:22] hallelujah I wouldn't worry I wouldn't
[56:27] worry too much now so he says when the
[56:31] squeeze comes down that which has been
[56:34] you've seen temporarily can you turn
[56:36] that down a little bit our month will be
[56:38] manifested and the fullness of its power
[56:42] friends we don't just talk about the
[56:45] Lord he's not just something we talk
[56:47] about Christianity is not just something
[56:50] we talk about it's a life it's a
[56:53] manifestation of God that's what real
[56:56] Christianity is we don't just talk about
[56:58] them we really have what we talk about
[57:01] I mean we actually possess everything
[57:03] he's given to us hallelujah
[57:06] and that's why we can't leave the devil
[57:07] push us around no more don't be pushed
[57:10] around by some spirit and when you tell
[57:12] that spirit to get out you have the
[57:14] right the Bible says the weapons of our
[57:17] warfare are not carnal but mighty
[57:19] through God to the pulling down of
[57:21] strongholds
[57:22] I mean we're anointed to tear the
[57:24] devil's Kingdom down holy and we are all
[57:27] danger terrors Kingdom down I mean
[57:29] that's your job description in this day
[57:31] you live for him and you care to live
[57:34] for God and care the devil's Kingdom
[57:35] down hallelujah amen
[57:38] we are told when the weakest of
[57:41] Christians who's a Christian today I
[57:43] just put up my hand if I as you who's a
[57:46] Christian this who's a Christian hello
[57:49] Christians when the weakest of
[57:51] Christians gets on their knees doesn't
[57:54] even say em praise amen brother Brown
[57:57] said the kingdom of Hell shakes
[58:01] we we kind of you know we think we're
[58:03] like a bunch of athletes how's my stance
[58:06] how's my personal best how's my
[58:07] nutrition how's all these things going
[58:09] on and we look at our performance oh but
[58:12] I'm feeling weak in faith well when the
[58:14] weakest of Christian gets on their knees
[58:16] he didn't say when the strongest or the
[58:18] one who's feeling the best or the one
[58:19] who's prime the best or when the weakest
[58:22] amen so I can say well I'm a weak
[58:25] Christian hell still shakes pal still
[58:29] shakes hallelujah and I want to see how
[58:32] shake hallelujah
[58:34] realize here's the ark angels Archangels
[58:38] with God
[58:39] never put a foot wrong stood loyal
[58:42] hallelujah they have a conversation with
[58:45] God but then now you begin to pray and
[58:48] you begin to call upon upon your your
[58:51] lover your bridegroom your husband and
[58:54] God has to say them shhh
[58:56] my daughter is talking to me my sons
[58:59] talking to me how I swear all right I
[59:02] gotta listen to what they've got to say
[59:04] hallelujah because you under the blood
[59:07] of Jesus Christ have more authority with
[59:09] God then the Archangels in heaven
[59:13] hallelujah hallelujah because the blood
[59:15] has lifted you up his redemption has
[59:17] lifted you up this word has lifted you
[59:20] up I mean to be in joint ear with him
[59:22] hallelujah that's what we are that's
[59:25] what the Bible says in joint heirs with
[59:27] Christ what does a joint ear mean it's
[59:29] not someone who's down here and he's up
[59:31] here
[59:31] no he lifts us up that we joint with
[59:33] co-equal with God he's how head sure but
[59:37] he lifts us up that's just like a real
[59:39] husband a real husband does not treat
[59:42] down his wife that's a man who's under
[59:45] the law amen and I'll say this as well
[59:48] a real you know there's been studies
[59:50] done that a man if he looks at at all or
[59:55] he looks at a half-naked woman sexy
[59:57] dressed the same parts of his brain I
[1:00:00] activated so what's happening
[1:00:02] subconsciously he is looking at that
[1:00:05] woman the same as Justin at all and this
[1:00:08] is what this modern society has done to
[1:00:10] a woman stripped her off that man looks
[1:00:13] at them subconsciously says they're just
[1:00:15] tools are you following me so man that
[1:00:19] your strausser's
[1:00:20] wife out onto the street like that
[1:00:22] what's he actually saying you're just a
[1:00:23] tool I don't actually value or treasure
[1:00:26] you amen this is free I'm just throwing
[1:00:30] it out there
[1:00:30] butBut yeah butBut they've shown it I
[1:00:33] mean because many times you know it's
[1:00:37] the liberal as is just as bad as illegal
[1:00:39] I mean but those who really love the
[1:00:41] Lord
[1:00:42] if you really know him what is your
[1:00:44] heart now Redemption its redemption to
[1:00:46] your family your whole focus what
[1:00:48] Scott's focus upon the earth you helliya
[1:00:51] his whole focus upon the earth is you
[1:00:53] redeemed amen you are the reason perlier
[1:00:56] that he's brooding on the earth you're
[1:00:58] the reason he said the message you're
[1:00:59] the reason he caused people to go
[1:01:01] through great hardship that this would
[1:01:02] be translated I mean that you'd received
[1:01:05] the word for yourself holier that you
[1:01:07] would know him you were his focus upon
[1:01:10] this earth and he has not called you to
[1:01:13] be a downtrodden woman he has not called
[1:01:15] you to be a second-class citizen in the
[1:01:17] kingdom he's not interested in a bunch
[1:01:19] of servants as a bride he wants a wife
[1:01:21] he wants someone to be joint heirs with
[1:01:23] him hallelujah that's why he's called
[1:01:26] you so now if that is God's focus is

[1:03:56] focus sure we've got a we've got to work
[1:04:00] right we're going to get an education
[1:04:02] we're going to do all these things but
[1:04:05] don't let it define you don't let that
[1:04:08] be your defining thing many people have
[1:04:10] been defined by their work and what's it
[1:04:12] done for them when they've gone from
[1:04:13] this world to the next world but others
[1:04:15] have been destitute downcast whatever
[1:04:17] more and the Bible says of whom the
[1:04:19] world is not worthy that's how great
[1:04:21] they were the world wasn't worthy of
[1:04:22] their presence Howell ouya Amen so now
[1:04:27] what we need to do so now when the
[1:04:30] squeeze comes on what you've seen
[1:04:31] manifested temporarily will be
[1:04:34] manifested in the fullness of its power
[1:04:37] so now yeah and yeah yeah I was I was
[1:04:40] very more thinking about those words the
[1:04:42] fullness of its power
[1:04:43] so not just something a little bit it's
[1:04:45] the fullness of it now you say well
[1:04:48] where is that power that powers in you
[1:04:51] if the Holy Ghost is in you man I just
[1:04:56] pray I just look at your face I say Lord
[1:04:58] give them such a assurance not because
[1:05:02] it's not about what I say I mean it's
[1:05:05] not like it's by jury and I'm the judge
[1:05:07] saying well you're in you're out that's
[1:05:09] not how it works man wants to know I
[1:05:10] either bribed a do you think on the
[1:05:12] bride or not the bride that's irrelevant
[1:05:13] that's what God is
[1:05:16] that's what God says to you amen
[1:05:19] it's when God comes first he says you're
[1:05:21] one of them you're one of mine I mean
[1:05:24] that's what the Bible says you've got
[1:05:26] it's an individual walk between you and
[1:05:27] God hallelujah but I just pray Lord give
[1:05:31] them all such an assurance I mean they
[1:05:33] can be going through the worst trial
[1:05:35] that they've ever yo ever going through
[1:05:37] but they're rejoicing hallelujah
[1:05:40] they're just happy I mean this they're
[1:05:42] so glad you say how's things going on as
[1:05:44] well naturally it's going terrible
[1:05:46] everything imagine it's happening and
[1:05:49] you thinking it worse I haven't finished
[1:05:52] but but I know in whom I have believed I
[1:05:56] mean I know who is called for me I know
[1:05:59] who's my redeemer I know he's purchased
[1:06:01] my salvation I know I'm been set free
[1:06:04] I'm free indeed
[1:06:05] holy I know that the blood has paid my
[1:06:07] price Amen I'm on my road to heaven
[1:06:09] sphere land that's how it should be holy
[1:06:13] should have been that way Amen so that
[1:06:16] power because remember I'll get there
[1:06:19] but the thing is though remember what
[1:06:21] was in the disciples there there they
[1:06:25] are the good and honest hearts
[1:06:26] Judas heard the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:06:28] - but he what he didn't have a good
[1:06:31] Nonna's heart he got offended hey man he
[1:06:34] got offended and he went and did his
[1:06:36] thing but there they were they were the
[1:06:39] prepared ground they're hearing words
[1:06:41] from a man that they'd never heard
[1:06:42] before
[1:06:43] not a man spake like this man hallelujah
[1:06:46] and then finally now this is just me but
[1:06:48] it's like God saying well I'm not just
[1:06:51] going to plant I'm gonna produce a crop
[1:06:53] then I'm going to really show them
[1:06:55] what's been sown unto them I mean it now
[1:06:58] it's not just gonna be just following me
[1:07:00] and seeing what I do I'm gonna show them
[1:07:02] the same life that was in me as in them
[1:07:04] hallelujah and then they go to the they
[1:07:06] go to the Upper Room friends we can ever
[1:07:08] Pentecost every day hallelujah
[1:07:10] hallelujah brother BAM see a man can be
[1:07:13] so drunk on the spirit ago he can be
[1:07:14] drunk on the Spirit of God every day of
[1:07:17] his life until God takes him home
[1:07:20] hallelujah so you cannot have one sober
[1:07:22] moment haha hallelujah amen
[1:07:30] really really hallelujah
[1:07:34] don't put God in a box that's why we
[1:07:36] shouldn't put God in the Box when we
[1:07:38] come to service every nor even when we
[1:07:40] open the scripture I mean listen to the
[1:07:42] message don't put God in a box well I've
[1:07:44] read their scripture before read it
[1:07:46] again
[1:07:46] I've heard their message before read it
[1:07:48] again it'll speak something new to you
[1:07:50] and will quicken something you do
[1:07:52] hallelujah let's not put God in a box
[1:07:55] the rest the world has got him figured
[1:07:58] out they think I mean but God just goes
[1:08:00] you can't box me hallelujah do you think
[1:08:04] you do you think you've experienced it
[1:08:05] at all this is not about more hallelujah
[1:08:08] all those who great meetings are hold on
[1:08:10] you wait you wait amen
[1:08:14] so we can't just put God in the box we
[1:08:16] should be saying Lordan you're the
[1:08:18] all-powerful Almighty God and you've
[1:08:22] decided and you have decided to come
[1:08:24] down identify yourself of me have your
[1:08:27] way do what you want
[1:08:29] hallelujah but it's the devil that tries
[1:08:31] to put God in a box and clamp down and
[1:08:34] try make us to be quiet try and make our
[1:08:37] mind to be distracted on other things
[1:08:38] hallelujah we're going to kick him out I
[1:08:42] don't I don't live my life out of fear
[1:08:45] of the devil amen why should we do that
[1:08:49] we should live our lives out of love of
[1:08:51] God amen
[1:08:55] so now there they are they come up to
[1:08:57] the upper room God comes down and then
[1:09:00] God's going to show them now I'm going
[1:09:02] to show you what's in you and then the
[1:09:04] pressure comes on the pressure comes on
[1:09:08] here Simon Peter pressure comes on in
[1:09:11] pilots judgement Hall he curses and
[1:09:13] denies the Lord pressure came on now
[1:09:16] here's the same one and it's not just
[1:09:19] seed laying dormant and soil it's now
[1:09:21] coming to life I mean because now the
[1:09:23] light struck that see other because he
[1:09:25] is in the upper room God came down is
[1:09:27] now in him and God's going to show this
[1:09:29] is what sin you know and and he just
[1:09:30] stands and says well what should we do
[1:09:32] to please God or please men you tell us
[1:09:35] and they get beaten in another place and
[1:09:37] they go out they rejoice hallelujah
[1:09:40] thank you Lord that we've been beating
[1:09:42] on your account now that sounds a bit
[1:09:45] weird doesn't it but God is we are a
[1:09:48] bunch of oddballs to the world I mean we
[1:09:51] are a bunch of oddballs because because
[1:09:54] the devil in his mind saying let's just
[1:09:55] intimidate them let's put pressure on
[1:09:57] let's drag them before the same counsel
[1:09:59] that crucified their so-called Messiah
[1:10:01] and we'll make them Bend and they just
[1:10:04] went in there and said well I'm sorry
[1:10:07] you're too late I'm sorry I'm sorry we
[1:10:12] just we had the prot the promise of the
[1:10:14] Prophet Joel happened to us God has
[1:10:18] poured out a spirit
[1:10:19] he's now in me hallelujah you're too
[1:10:22] late you can't say Jesus wasn't our
[1:10:24] Messiah because his blood works because
[1:10:26] now he's in me I mean the God you claim
[1:10:28] to serve us now and me hallelujah they
[1:10:31] were too late and that's why they didn't
[1:10:34] bow and then they went and then they
[1:10:36] breathing out threatenings upon them I'm
[1:10:37] kind of mixing up all the persecution go
[1:10:39] read the book of Acts the early part and
[1:10:42] then and then and then they come and
[1:10:44] they have a prayer meeting
[1:10:46] they didn't sit around and talk about
[1:10:48] what the enemy tried to do to them they
[1:10:50] just prayed hallelujah because they're
[1:10:52] talking to the real one who could help
[1:10:54] them and God came down and fill the
[1:10:57] plane filled them again shook the place
[1:10:59] and they went out with boldness
[1:11:00] hallelujah amen aren't you glad that's
[1:11:04] why I think that's why we come to church
[1:11:06] isn't it
[1:11:07] I come for a refilling hallelujah I care
[1:11:10] for another baptism one baptism many
[1:11:12] fillings the Prophet says so I've
[1:11:14] received a I've been baptized and the
[1:11:17] Holy Ghost but I want to refill it I
[1:11:20] want my cup to be overflowing I want to
[1:11:23] be drinking from my saucer hallelujah
[1:11:26] cause my cup overflows that's what I
[1:11:28] want to be like amen so God will allow
[1:11:32] the devil to put that pressure on to
[1:11:34] show what was in the disciples I mean
[1:11:36] it's the same thing with the squeeze and
[1:11:38] this current climate we're in the
[1:11:40] squeeze coming down is to show what's in
[1:11:42] you that's all it does it proves what's
[1:11:45] in you
[1:11:46] it doesn't actually activate what's well
[1:11:48] love many people look for the squeeze
[1:11:50] and say well when the squeeze comes in
[1:11:52] God's really get a pour a spirit out
[1:11:54] no it just shows what's already in you
[1:11:56] I'll put it that way it's just showing
[1:11:58] what's already in you amen
[1:12:00] the Spirit is moving God is pouring
[1:12:03] himself out hallelujah
[1:12:06] it's merely showing what's in you amen
[1:12:10] so now this you say well we've got to
[1:12:13] wait for it to get real bad first and
[1:12:14] then it'll be manifested the fullness of
[1:12:16] its power no I say now I say now what
[1:12:20] are we waiting for
[1:12:21] what are we waiting for hallelujah
[1:12:24] you're following me now brother Brahim
[1:12:30] see see it's in divine love I'll put
[1:12:33] this one up we'll see how the if not
[1:12:35] I'll read it sorry about the I tried to
[1:12:38] squish it too much now you've got to
[1:12:41] create an atmosphere and your faith will
[1:12:44] do it they were all in the upper room
[1:12:46] with one Accord then suddenly there came
[1:12:48] from heaven as a sound of a Russian
[1:12:50] mighty wind
[1:12:51] the atmosphere was right it takes an
[1:12:54] atmosphere to do anything you know the
[1:12:56] regular procedure to hatch chickens is
[1:12:58] to put them under the hen but get the
[1:13:00] egg in the right atmosphere it'll hatch
[1:13:01] anyhow listen brother if a man loves God
[1:13:04] and the right kind of an atmosphere he
[1:13:07] could get into it'll produce newborn
[1:13:09] babe just as certain as I'm here it's
[1:13:11] the atmosphere that counts let this
[1:13:13] little handful of people sitting here
[1:13:15] tonight and I'll say this morning get in
[1:13:17] the perfect atmosphere watch what takes
[1:13:19] place there will not be a feeble won't
[1:13:21] one an hour much the cripples will walk
[1:13:23] the blind will see the Deaf will hear
[1:13:24] the dumb will speak without prayer or
[1:13:27] anything it's the atmosphere that's how
[1:13:30] 5000 was healed at one prayer in Africa
[1:13:32] when they seen the Lord do something it
[1:13:35] created our atmosphere and they stepped
[1:13:38] into it there's the pool when the waters
[1:13:41] is running right he's talking about the
[1:13:43] Pool of Bethesda this is this the
[1:13:44] atmosphere that does it hallelujah
[1:13:48] that's why it's important that's why
[1:13:51] it's important when we come to church
[1:13:53] we're ready I mean we don't have to wait
[1:13:56] for the end of service now I'm in a good
[1:13:58] condition we're really in a good
[1:13:59] condition
[1:13:59] we're prayed up with Carsten every
[1:14:02] imagination is the salt itself above the
[1:14:04] Word of God I mean we turn the other
[1:14:06] cheek to our family whatever
[1:14:07] going on and you've got to come to a
[1:14:09] conclusion well it's Saturday night
[1:14:11] that's why this trouble at Sunday
[1:14:13] morning that's why it's trouble it's
[1:14:15] Wednesday night that's why there's
[1:14:16] trouble in the family why cuz the devil
[1:14:18] starts workin ever hard day but for me
[1:14:21] the hardest days I have is Wednesday
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:25] Saturday can be pretty hard to not
[1:14:28] always I'm not at work but you know
[1:14:30] Saturday night why what's happening the
[1:14:33] devil is trying to get us trouble that
[1:14:35] when we come to church our minds all
[1:14:37] like scrambled eggs right we don't know
[1:14:39] what's going on because we've got all
[1:14:41] this going on right but let's just push
[1:14:44] it to one side that's why I'm trying to
[1:14:47] get you to I said Lord may they enter in
[1:14:49] you begin to enjoy the service a little
[1:14:52] bit say Amen a few times there's an
[1:14:55] atmosphere will be created around you I
[1:14:57] mean where God will come down god
[1:15:00] inhabits the praises of his people
[1:15:02] hallelujah
[1:15:03] you ever thought about that God inhabits
[1:15:05] your praise Amen and and that is that is
[1:15:09] from your heart hallelujah so you want
[1:15:11] God to come around you just begin to
[1:15:13] praise him a little bit thank you thank
[1:15:16] you Lord for saving me thank you thank
[1:15:19] you Lord for setting me free
[1:15:21] once I was lost now I am found
[1:15:23] hallelujah I'm glory bound thank you
[1:15:26] thank you Lord for saving me what's
[1:15:29] happening you begin to praise him and
[1:15:30] then your mood begins to shift how they
[1:15:33] go maybe it'd be all grumpy and twisted
[1:15:35] up he's forgetting to sing some the
[1:15:37] Bible says to sing spiritual Psalms sing
[1:15:40] songs in your heart sing them to one
[1:15:41] another
[1:15:42] why because you create an atmosphere
[1:15:43] yeah music has great power it brings two
[1:15:47] spirits either God or the devil I don't
[1:15:49] want the devil I want God right I want
[1:15:52] him that's why you gone to the mall do
[1:15:55] you go anywhere this it's like you're in
[1:15:57] a club somewhere what's going on I'm
[1:16:00] buying I'm buying veggies what you know
[1:16:03] it's just so weird isn't it really
[1:16:05] because normally it's like all the music
[1:16:07] fits the place now now it's just the
[1:16:09] same music everywhere that's pretty
[1:16:11] weird
[1:16:12] and maybe you even thought about it some
[1:16:14] of you looking at me like what you
[1:16:15] talking about
[1:16:15] but you know it's just it's like you're
[1:16:17] in this it's like I'm back in some scary
[1:16:19] club with all these lights and stuff go
[1:16:21] like I used to back in the hungry I'm
[1:16:24] glad that day is not here anymore
[1:16:26] and that guy died hallelujah but you
[1:16:29] know but why is that cuz there's an
[1:16:31] atmosphere trying to be created amen
[1:16:34] and spirits actually dwell in places
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:39] just like the first first place we
[1:16:41] rendered here there was a demon spirit
[1:16:42] in the place
[1:16:43] I won't tell the whole testimony but we
[1:16:45] came to a point where said this is not
[1:16:47] right we cast a thing out we had perfect
[1:16:49] peace after that everything was fine and
[1:16:51] the day we move out a neighbor said are
[1:16:53] you the woman who used to rent that
[1:16:55] place she was using it as a brothel
[1:16:58] so those deeds that she was doing
[1:17:01] brought that spirit into the place well
[1:17:03] if that's the case on the bed what about
[1:17:05] the real what about on the genuine sign
[1:17:08] the deeds you do Amy we'll bring a spoon
[1:17:11] unto a place
[1:17:12] hallelujah that's why when we come home
[1:17:14] it should be just such a peace may the
[1:17:17] devil remember he had any left him for a
[1:17:19] season so the devil doesn't just wave
[1:17:21] his white flag and say well well they're
[1:17:23] the Lord's now I quit I'll find someone
[1:17:26] else to bully no he tries to come back
[1:17:28] but as I said the reason but but now
[1:17:31] there's a resistance I trust is a
[1:17:34] resistance in your life wholly aware the
[1:17:36] devil used to come in and he'd just ride
[1:17:38] you like Seabiscuit you know he'd just
[1:17:41] do whatever he wanted because you were
[1:17:43] his slave but then there's a revolution
[1:17:46] you rose up and you realize who you
[1:17:48] really were and now the devil comes
[1:17:50] against you and now he tries to come in
[1:17:53] but you just but the strong man in the
[1:17:54] house I'm it keeps the door shut and if
[1:17:57] he keeps knocking the strong man goes up
[1:18:00] and punches him in the face and sees him
[1:18:01] on his way hallelujah
[1:18:03] is that right guess why we're not all
[1:18:05] the devil's on my case well what are you
[1:18:07] doing about it I mean the same blood he
[1:18:12] think oh if the Prophet was here he
[1:18:13] would pray the same blood that redeemed
[1:18:16] him the same Holy Ghost that was in him
[1:18:18] as in the bride right the very same one
[1:18:21] the very same one that was in our
[1:18:23] Messiah
[1:18:23] as in you the very same God amen your
[1:18:30] brother I'm said if you had a shadow of
[1:18:32] the power of God
[1:18:34] you can do anything amen you have their
[1:18:39] very crater that's it let there be Sun
[1:18:40] Moon and stars isn't you we don't
[1:18:44] believe in a Trinity or two lords or you
[1:18:47] know the Holy Ghost is not different to
[1:18:49] the crater he is the creator a man he is
[1:18:53] our Lord Jesus right so the same one
[1:18:56] that created all things now comes and
[1:18:58] dwells and you amen so now so all power
[1:19:02] where is all power I need to get to the
[1:19:04] text I want to read well I'll get to it
[1:19:06] now but you know all power where's all
[1:19:08] power if God is in you all powers in you
[1:19:12] and you have the authority remember it's
[1:19:14] not your parrot says power but you have
[1:19:17] the authority to use it
[1:19:18] just like a little bitty policeman
[1:19:21] two-by-four maybe as wide as he is tall
[1:19:23] he can you know he can be tripping over
[1:19:27] his uniform but he has the authority
[1:19:30] I'll say because we have a countrywide
[1:19:33] police force of the whole country behind
[1:19:35] him and he can be this big and be the
[1:19:39] skinniest runt is how he got and no one
[1:19:41] knows but he's a policeman you know how
[1:19:44] did I get in I don't know but I'm a
[1:19:45] Christian hallelujah that's the main
[1:19:48] thing doesn't matter whatever ability I
[1:19:51] thought I may have it's not our ability
[1:19:52] now it's God's ability that's the only
[1:19:54] thing that counts and everyone has to
[1:19:57] listen to that policeman because he has
[1:20:00] the authority of the country behind him
[1:20:02] all the power of the state is behind the
[1:20:05] policeman and if anyone tries to
[1:20:07] challenge him he can call back up
[1:20:11] hallelujah amen he can call back up we
[1:20:17] have backup amen all of heaven is behind
[1:20:22] you you have the best backup right don't
[1:20:26] just escalate it you know even one angel
[1:20:31] do you know what you have you know what
[1:20:35] this word this this word they talk about
[1:20:37] hypersonic missiles and a you know
[1:20:38] atomic hydrogen bombs hypersonic
[1:20:40] missiles we've got more than that I mean
[1:20:44] I'm not worried about that let them
[1:20:46] build them go for it
[1:20:48] knock yourself out we have a better
[1:20:50] weapon what we don't need to live in
[1:20:52] fear
[1:20:53] Oh intimidation listen listen this you
[1:20:55] know there's always been a timid ation
[1:20:57] against the believer when Martin Luther
[1:20:59] protested the Catholic Church do you
[1:21:02] think they just hit oh he must oh we
[1:21:04] don't like what he's saying so we'll
[1:21:05] just let him go
[1:21:06] no they wrote pamphlets they you know
[1:21:09] they they spread through their social
[1:21:12] media did it faze him no the just shall
[1:21:17] live by faith
[1:21:18] I've been justified by faith I don't
[1:21:20] need to do those things that just shall
[1:21:22] live by faith giving John Wesley the
[1:21:24] Anglican Church didn't rejoice in his
[1:21:26] experience when he heard the book of
[1:21:28] Romans being read and it warmed his
[1:21:29] heart
[1:21:30] aurorae exposition on the book of Romans
[1:21:32] by Martin Luther it warmed his heart he
[1:21:34] did they weren't rejoicing he had to go
[1:21:36] open-air preaching they weren't happy he
[1:21:40] just pressed on do you think the
[1:21:42] original Pentecostal church not even was
[1:21:45] rejoicing some bishops in America said
[1:21:47] it was the last vomit of Satan and they
[1:21:49] told that they told their congregations
[1:21:51] about it did it face them no they just
[1:21:55] went on now if that's speed all the way
[1:21:58] through just like Paul comes to some
[1:22:01] place in the book of X and and and the
[1:22:04] Jews asked him or they said what is the
[1:22:06] sect of Jesus that ever at spoken evil
[1:22:08] against spirits do not die by their
[1:22:18] fruits you shall know them
[1:22:21] amen so if they had pressure if they had
[1:22:25] hardship and now this is the most evil
[1:22:27] of all the ages all the evil of the ages
[1:22:30] is heaped up into this H all the glory
[1:22:32] of the past ages is heaped up into this
[1:22:34] age do you think we're just going to
[1:22:36] walk you know everything's peachy
[1:22:39] economies going well the world's going
[1:22:41] fine and we take a rapture we don't have
[1:22:45] any trouble no no no no we're gonna let
[1:22:51] you look at you look at um you know so
[1:22:54] we shouldn't be surprised because the
[1:22:57] devil knows who you are
[1:22:59] if they'll be who who identified the
[1:23:03] Messiah more in Jesus's day it wasn't
[1:23:05] the scribes of Pharisees who had the who
[1:23:08] had the quotes of the prophets and who
[1:23:10] actually say yes he should be you if
[1:23:11] they actually sat down with the
[1:23:12] prophecies and say yeah he matches and
[1:23:16] he's got a supernatural ministry to
[1:23:17] vindicate that he matches no it was the
[1:23:21] it was the demon spirit saying thou art
[1:23:23] the Son of God have you covered two
[1:23:25] minutes before the time they knew who he
[1:23:26] was and sometimes people look at you and
[1:23:30] you can see it's not them looking at you
[1:23:32] is something else who's experienced that
[1:23:38] before amen
[1:23:40] demon power looks at you because they
[1:23:42] know what you are and are they happy no
[1:23:46] because God said he's going to have a
[1:23:48] bride all that the father has given me
[1:23:51] will come to me and all that come to me
[1:23:54] I'll no wise cast out so as soon as that
[1:23:57] God Jesus said that God said that Satan
[1:24:00] saying I'm going to stop it not all
[1:24:03] that's given to you are going to come to
[1:24:05] you
[1:24:05] that's his ambition but God just says no
[1:24:09] I'm not gonna let you win hallelujah but
[1:24:13] that's why we have a lot of pressure and
[1:24:15] hardships because it has to be this way
[1:24:17] you know people seem Noah building the
[1:24:20] ark maybe the first day he talks about
[1:24:23] how bad the world is he had a lot of
[1:24:24] sympathizers you're right this world has
[1:24:27] got evil it's got bad and then maybe he
[1:24:30] lays the keel and they begin to see how
[1:24:32] big it is maybe something we're going to
[1:24:34] say okay we'll go with you then
[1:24:38] eventually as the thing gets built
[1:24:41] people begin to pull themselves away
[1:24:43] because as the word was getting more
[1:24:46] made manifest that's when the devil
[1:24:48] senses criticism greater and greater and
[1:24:51] greater Jesus starts his ministry look
[1:24:54] at this young rabbi who's raised up
[1:24:56] multitudes their healing miraculous
[1:24:59] taking place he begins to open the word
[1:25:02] up
[1:25:02] I'm my father or one what happens now
[1:25:06] that's when the sympathised wind to pull
[1:25:08] away eat my flesh drink my blood unless
[1:25:11] you do this you don't have eternal life
[1:25:13] you wanna have eternal life eat my flesh
[1:25:15] drink my blood oh don't say that
[1:25:18] too late he said it he didn't explain it
[1:25:21] not at all I mean he walked with him no
[1:25:24] more so it no was yes so it's the same
[1:25:27] thing today when the wood becomes
[1:25:29] manifested hallelujah that's when the
[1:25:34] persecution comes on more because God is
[1:25:36] manifesting himself and bride for a men
[1:25:39] and a bride has begin to see Ordos see
[1:25:42] who she is
[1:25:44] amen you know it's like this this
[1:25:49] country wants to have or the world once
[1:25:52] a you topic society with there's no
[1:25:54] racism the only way that can happen is
[1:25:57] if they become believers that is the
[1:26:00] only way it can ever happen
[1:26:03] amen just like brother and poem brother
[1:26:05] ed one around my dinner table talking
[1:26:07] about the what peace and reconciliation
[1:26:08] commission or whatever thing in South
[1:26:11] Africa after the apartheid fell I said
[1:26:14] the only way you could ever actually
[1:26:15] have that happen and it's your the right
[1:26:18] way as if believers around with the
[1:26:20] peace and reconciliation amen isn't that
[1:26:23] right so the only way that there will be
[1:26:25] a new topic society is when we're in the
[1:26:27] Millennium there won't be racism in the
[1:26:29] millennium but there's no carnal man
[1:26:31] there's no national spirits living it's
[1:26:33] just God living hallelujah isn't that
[1:26:36] wonderful and that's why we can look at
[1:26:38] each other and say they're bright this
[1:26:40] is the word this is the word this is the
[1:26:42] word doesn't matter where we have come
[1:26:43] from we've come from heaven that's why
[1:26:45] we have all things in common
[1:26:47] hallelujah I mean but hey I'm just glad
[1:26:54] we're going now so it's the atmosphere
[1:26:57] we won't ever right atmosphere one
[1:26:59] atmosphere of faith not an atmosphere of
[1:27:02] doubt atmosphere of faith hallelujah
[1:27:05] that's why I say no the Lord is able to
[1:27:07] deliver are they three Hebrew children
[1:27:10] they just said to King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:27:12] they had a good atmosphere of faith
[1:27:14] around them if God delivers us praise
[1:27:17] the Lord if not what we're not gonna bow
[1:27:19] throw us in we won't be careful how
[1:27:22] we'll respond this is our answer I mean
[1:27:24] then what happened the angel your God
[1:27:26] came down
[1:27:27] the fire had fellowship with them that a
[1:27:29] glorious time why cuz that hemisphere of
[1:27:32] faith amen now this power saw so the
[1:27:37] power of the third Pole Amen is
[1:27:40] manifested in the right atmosphere of
[1:27:42] faith now I want to say this the brides
[1:27:46] heart has been turned back to the
[1:27:48] original faith right we have been turned
[1:27:51] back amen
[1:27:53] we have been turned back to the original
[1:27:55] faith hallelujah so now so so we're not
[1:28:00] waiting for it to happen
[1:28:02] Malachi 4 has turned our hearts amen
[1:28:05] has he turned your heart I was my heart
[1:28:08] was in the world and unbelief wherever
[1:28:11] it was but then God the voice turned it
[1:28:13] I got anointed that voice to my heart I
[1:28:15] meant and he turned me back to the
[1:28:17] original faith of the fathers Alleluia
[1:28:20] so now in order for this third pulp for
[1:28:25] the for the manifestation of this third
[1:28:27] pull power amen
[1:28:29] we have to have the right atmosphere of
[1:28:31] faith and I believe we have it but
[1:28:33] that's why the devil tries to pull us
[1:28:35] into an argument or into unbelief or to
[1:28:38] doubt it's because he's trying to break
[1:28:39] us out of that atmosphere I mean but we
[1:28:42] Isis like brother brain with the maniac
[1:28:44] that came in front of front of him on
[1:28:46] the platform in Oregon and I was at
[1:28:47] Tommy Osbourne was in the meeting I
[1:28:49] believe it was all or one of the bitten
[1:28:51] spiders ministry greatly and that big
[1:28:53] demon-possessed man came up a final
[1:28:55] brother Brahma says I'll tear you limb
[1:28:56] from limb and spit in his face and you
[1:28:59] know cursed him and all these things and
[1:29:01] what was he trying to do he was trying
[1:29:03] to get brother Branham to come out of
[1:29:05] being in a spiritual atmosphere down
[1:29:08] into a carnal atmosphere and if he did
[1:29:10] that then he would have been torn limb
[1:29:12] from limb I mean but bro Brown kept
[1:29:14] himself in a spiritual atmosphere and
[1:29:16] because he did that and he actually felt
[1:29:19] sorry for the man because he saw the man
[1:29:21] was in a cage of demon power no one
[1:29:23] wants to see someone demon possessed I
[1:29:25] trust you don't Amen so he felt sorry
[1:29:29] for the man and in the man said know
[1:29:31] what yeah and then and then and then God
[1:29:33] spoke through brother barons head
[1:29:34] because now you have challenged the
[1:29:37] spirit of living God you'll fall at my
[1:29:38] feet and in the man said oh sure
[1:29:40] whose feet who's full on who he went to
[1:29:43] punch him he fell down it you know pin
[1:29:44] brother hands feet to the floor so and
[1:29:47] policemen or whatever had to drag him
[1:29:48] off his feet and then begin to start
[1:29:50] preaching now as I sang or continued on
[1:29:53] now I was saying faith is the substance
[1:29:55] and Samba going to get healed here and
[1:29:57] healing just begin to break out over the
[1:29:59] whole service why because the head devil
[1:30:02] Amen in that place was defeated he
[1:30:05] following me the heaven hid devil was
[1:30:08] defeated there and then once the he won
[1:30:10] was defeated than the other ones lost a
[1:30:12] grip and then people gonna rise up on
[1:30:14] faith I mean and we're healed and
[1:30:16] delivered hallelujah he say well that
[1:30:19] was the prophets ministry we are a
[1:30:21] continuation Elijah continued Elijah's
[1:30:25] ministry right the same anointing that
[1:30:28] was on Elijah was on Elijah but in a
[1:30:30] double portion I mean to the same the
[1:30:33] same ministry the prophet head is now in
[1:30:36] the bride hallelujah so now he say well
[1:30:40] what's that got to do with us I said
[1:30:43] this we keeping a spiritual atmosphere
[1:30:44] of faith a mere we you know we want to
[1:30:48] seek Jesus come on the scene hallelujah
[1:30:51] who wants to see Jesus come upon the
[1:30:52] scene I mean more than just well going
[1:30:54] through the motions but God does
[1:30:56] supernaturally come down I mean in
[1:30:58] deliver and to heal and to redeem I mean
[1:31:01] that's what I want to see this is what
[1:31:03] the Bible teaches me amen
[1:31:06] I'm expecting it shouldn't we expect the
[1:31:09] supernatural to take place I mean we
[1:31:11] don't you know you say well where's this
[1:31:15] in the scripture there was a surfer
[1:31:17] nation woman amen
[1:31:20] her daughter was tormented by a devil
[1:31:23] she came to Jesus I don't have it up
[1:31:26] there but she comes from saying saying
[1:31:29] thou son of David have mercy on me he
[1:31:33] ignored her didn't it didn't it didn't
[1:31:36] stop her faith she knew if she can just
[1:31:40] get him to say the right things I mean
[1:31:43] then that girl will be delivered the
[1:31:47] girl wasn't with her she was somewhere
[1:31:49] else she comes to say that's our David
[1:31:52] have mercy on me Jesus didn't answer
[1:31:53] word
[1:31:54] god help me help me this Gentile faith
[1:31:58] is coming
[1:31:58] I mean Gentile faith is coming on the
[1:32:01] scene because she has a Gentile Lord
[1:32:03] help me and then she and but then he
[1:32:06] said well it's not meat for the
[1:32:08] children's bread to be given to the dogs
[1:32:10] so Jesus called her a dog that didn't
[1:32:13] just that didn't change her change her
[1:32:15] attitude she said truth Lord but crumbs
[1:32:17] still come down to the table underlined
[1:32:19] and then the dogs eat it up hallelujah
[1:32:21] and and he was pleased with that
[1:32:23] response he said gone fine and then what
[1:32:26] you believe you shall receive it and she
[1:32:28] went home and found her daughter totally
[1:32:30] healthy and well that demon left her
[1:32:33] hallelujah that is the power of the
[1:32:35] third Paul I mean that is the private
[1:32:38] third Pole hallelujah that's why we
[1:32:40] should have such an atmosphere and
[1:32:42] attitude around us God you've done it
[1:32:44] before you're the same one today you're
[1:32:47] not a different God you haven't
[1:32:49] diminished in power

[1:32:52] way or God I have a need
[1:32:53] Lord I need you to come upon the scene

[1:33:05] get an answer
[1:33:06] oh are you following me she her faith of
[1:33:11] course Jesus on the scene to save her
[1:33:14] daughter hallelujah we don't need
[1:33:18] squirrels to be spoken into existence
[1:33:20] that would be cool I don't need it
[1:33:23] I don't need a blizzard find out there
[1:33:26] today I'm not interested in those things
[1:33:28] that's just God showing that this word
[1:33:30] has power over nature cuz it's the
[1:33:32] crater himself amen that's just why he's
[1:33:35] you're showing the message just as the
[1:33:37] creator speaking through a man amen
[1:33:41] well we have healing we have salvation I
[1:33:44] mean we have the devil on our case amen
[1:33:50] trying to steal our joy trying to upset
[1:33:54] us trying to make us sick amen
[1:33:58] we don't have to put up with it we have
[1:34:00] to come to a case therefore I'm done
[1:34:02] with you
[1:34:02] and when you come back again no I
[1:34:05] haven't changed I'm still done and then
[1:34:08] he comes back again don't you learn
[1:34:10] devil the devil don't learn amen he
[1:34:14] ain't learning you gotta kick him out so
[1:34:17] she came and she got what she needed
[1:34:20] hallelujah
[1:34:22] the woman with the blood issue seen oh
[1:34:24] if I can just touch the hem of His
[1:34:25] garment I'll be made whole she was made
[1:34:27] whole hallelujah and we can still touch
[1:34:30] him by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:34] now that's just going still well here we
[1:34:38] are I gotta see where I am Jesus says
[1:34:43] here in Matthew he sees when Jesus came
[1:34:47] to the coasts of Caesarea Philippi that
[1:34:52] we don't um he asked his disciples
[1:34:55] saying who do men say that I the Son of
[1:34:57] Man am and they said some say thou art
[1:34:59] John the Baptist some Elias other
[1:35:02] Jeremias or one of the prophets he saith
[1:35:04] unto them but whom say ye that I am and
[1:35:07] Simon Peter answered said thou art the
[1:35:09] Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:35:12] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:35:14] blessed art thou simon barjona means
[1:35:16] Simon son of Jonah for flesh and blood
[1:35:19] has not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:35:20] father which is in heaven and I say unto
[1:35:23] thee thou art Peter and upon this rock
[1:35:25] I'll build my church and the gates of
[1:35:27] Hell shall not prevail against it and I
[1:35:30] will give unto thee the keys of the
[1:35:31] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[1:35:33] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:35:36] heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose
[1:35:38] on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:35:41] now we know that the rock that the
[1:35:45] church is built upon is the revelation
[1:35:47] of Jesus Christ what has been revealed
[1:35:50] who to mean say that I am what's been
[1:35:52] revealed to them well you're one of the
[1:35:53] prophets but who do you say that I am
[1:35:56] what's been revealed to you you are the
[1:35:58] Christ you are the Messiah
[1:36:00] Alleluia are the Word made flesh less
[1:36:03] than an hour Simon bar Jonah for flesh
[1:36:05] and blood has not revealed this to you
[1:36:07] man has not given you this revelation
[1:36:09] but my father in heaven has given you
[1:36:12] this revelation and upon this rock I
[1:36:14] will build my church the rock of
[1:36:17] revelation of the word whereas not in
[1:36:20] here
[1:36:21] it's revealed in here amen and when it's
[1:36:24] revealed in here no man can take it from
[1:36:27] you no argument can take it from you
[1:36:29] because you've met Messiah Alleluia and
[1:36:33] then he says I will give you the keys to
[1:36:36] the kingdom and what you bind on earth
[1:36:40] shall be bound in heaven what you loose
[1:36:42] on earth shall be loosed in heaven this
[1:36:45] is the power given to the church
[1:36:47] hallelujah yes I'm saying now we've got
[1:36:50] to take our authority take our badge of
[1:36:53] believer and start waving it around
[1:36:56] amen start using what we're given
[1:36:58] instead of cowering in the corner saying
[1:37:00] all the devils on my case and putting up
[1:37:02] with conditions in our body and
[1:37:04] lukewarmness and laziness and you know
[1:37:06] just being caught up in lady ousia and
[1:37:08] hobbies and stuff we're gonna kick it
[1:37:10] out
[1:37:10] what is the first place now life should
[1:37:13] be his word you know it's not a
[1:37:15] revelation for us together as a church
[1:37:17] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:37:19] together for as much as you see the time
[1:37:21] approach you don't need a revelation
[1:37:23] it's in the scripture just like baptism
[1:37:25] is in the scripture right holiness
[1:37:27] living is in the scripture you don't
[1:37:28] need a revelation it's in the word
[1:37:30] hallelujah and we see the Day
[1:37:33] approaching
[1:37:33] we should forsake not the assembling of
[1:37:35] ourselves together whereas God could
[1:37:37] come down and touch us and change us and
[1:37:40] mold us hallelujah glory to God so you
[1:37:44] know so this now this is standing orders
[1:37:48] why do we let the devil run rampant in
[1:37:50] our thoughts why do we let him run
[1:37:53] rampant in our imagination and our
[1:37:55] reasoning or our conscious living under
[1:37:57] fear we are not called to live under
[1:38:00] fear we are not called to live under
[1:38:03] fear we are called to live under divine
[1:38:05] love hallelujah if people are motivated
[1:38:08] by fear you've got to fall in love with
[1:38:11] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:38:13] we're motivated by love amen
[1:38:16] you know if someone came to me for
[1:38:19] example and see it about Christine you
[1:38:22] know she's mean and she's nasty and
[1:38:25] she's critical and she's you know it
[1:38:27] doesn't listen she did this the other
[1:38:28] day and she's like this I said hold on

[1:38:36] like she's not like anything you've just
[1:38:38] described because I'm in a relationship
[1:38:40] with her I'm married to her hallelujah
[1:38:43] but if I just heard about her and I was
[1:38:45] never married to her maybe I could say
[1:38:47] well maybe that was true
[1:38:49] but because I'm married to her
[1:38:52] any criticism my damn luck but I know
[1:38:54] her character I know what she's like
[1:38:56] right because I'm in a relationship

[1:39:02] there I seen I said no I don't believe
[1:39:03] what you're twisting that's not her

[1:39:09] the same thing with the Lord Jesus
[1:39:10] Christ same thing with his messenger

[1:39:36] have to try and work out things and make
[1:39:38] it no one day I was reading Peter and it
[1:39:40] wasn't Peter to someone it was Peter to
[1:39:43] me in 2007 a personal book and all the
[1:39:46] way and the whole Bible became a new
[1:39:48] book to me why because I entered into a
[1:39:50] love relationship with the author of the
[1:39:52] book hallelujah and it's got to be the
[1:39:55] same thing with you I trust it is I mean
[1:39:58] when you have people come along and they
[1:40:00] say all kinds things to hold on no no no
[1:40:03] no I know the Lord I know his character

[1:41:52] midst of them see saying if to agree on
[1:41:55] anything that's a big anything is a lot
[1:42:00] of things if you thought about it I'm

[1:42:25] you say I agree I'm with you in this
[1:42:27] prayer I'm with you in this need not
[1:42:29] just mentally with something in your

[1:42:56] naughty the dog is if it's trained it'll
[1:42:59] obey your voice

[1:43:03] that's a discredit to a dog I think it
[1:43:05] is but you know you know but he has to
[1:43:09] obey your voice the devil has to obey
[1:43:11] you that's why we shouldn't put up ways

[1:43:37] God had seen the prophets and they
[1:43:39] refused and they had failed and when
[1:43:41] Adams race was backed up against the
[1:43:42] backboard of eternity and there they was
[1:43:45] standing there and doubt and fear and
[1:43:47] trembling and Satan's great army
[1:43:49] marching on sickness and ignorance the
[1:43:51] superstitions and things was taking them
[1:43:54] from from side to side
[1:43:55] there was one step down out and heaven
[1:43:58] screamed to the Angels I'm going down to
[1:44:00] the earth I'm going to save Adams race
[1:44:02] there you'll see it what will you do he
[1:44:04] came to earth he lived thirty three and
[1:44:06] a half years three and a half years he
[1:44:08] preached he looked over the earth till
[1:44:10] he found the very midst of the deepest
[1:44:12] dark fear of man and that was death he
[1:44:14] went to Golgotha plays every spear of
[1:44:16] death into his own heart there he died

[1:44:52] shall recover hallelujah the greatest
[1:44:55] weapon that was ever put in the hands of
[1:44:57] man as the Bible to be backed up with
[1:45:00] the Holy Ghost that Christ died at
[1:45:02] Calvary to free his church from
[1:45:04] superstitions and fear and doubt and
[1:45:05] trembling he lives today he rose from
[1:45:07] the dead he's alive tonight hear ye
[1:45:10] well Elise the greatest weapon is the
[1:45:12] Bible backed up by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:45:15] and that's why it's so incredible in
[1:45:17] this hour we don't just have the
[1:45:18] mechanics of the word but the dynamics
[1:45:20] comes down they need to make the word
[1:45:22] live holy that it manifests itself is

[1:46:38] one that can heal you he's the one
[1:46:40] that's responsible for this
[1:46:41] amen he's the one who's responsible to
[1:46:43] his word if I be lifted up I'll draw all
[1:46:45] men unto me
[1:46:46] oh I preached from the pulpit wherever
[1:46:48] you are lift them up give them to the
[1:46:50] people hear ye him now I'd imagine when
[1:46:53] the trial come up this is from thy seed
[1:46:55] shall possess the gates of his enemies
[1:46:57] now imagine when a trial come up what's
[1:46:59] the first thing a child of God has for a
[1:47:01] refuge when trials comes the greatest
[1:47:03] weapon those ever put in the hands of
[1:47:05] mankind is prayer now brother brems is
[1:47:08] the greatest weapon as a few things amen
[1:47:11] they all tie together hallelujah we've
[1:47:14] got to use them the greatest weapons
[1:47:16] ever put into hands of mankind is prayer
[1:47:18] it changes everything can we repeat that
[1:47:22] it changes if
[1:47:24] thing it even changed the mind of God
[1:47:27] one times he told his prophet to go up
[1:47:28] and tell the king he was going to die
[1:47:30] and the King turned his face the wall
[1:47:32] said lord I beseech you to consider me I
[1:47:34] have walked before you with a perfect
[1:47:36] heart I need 15 years longer and God
[1:47:38] spared his life fifteen years longer
[1:47:39] prayer changes things what does the
[1:47:45] devil try and stop us doing praying why
[1:47:49] cuz prayer changes things hallelujah
[1:47:55] amen now Jesus spake a parable about the
[1:48:00] unjust judge you spake a parable and
[1:48:02] theme to the scene this is why we should
[1:48:04] keep pressing in don't be discouraged
[1:48:07] don't just sit back and say well you
[1:48:09] know this is a problem with this day and
[1:48:11] age it's instant you know you sit around
[1:48:14] have a conversation some random fact
[1:48:16] comes up I don't know you google it you
[1:48:18] know this is but God isn't that way we
[1:48:22] read in the very beginning that the word
[1:48:23] brings forth fruit with patience right
[1:48:27] into that honest and good ground amen
[1:48:30] but you know it's an instant instant
[1:48:34] thing I mean I mean this world is
[1:48:35] instant many times with God is not
[1:48:37] instant that doesn't mean we should just
[1:48:40] quit
[1:48:40] you follow me we're gonna keep pressing
[1:48:43] on hallelujah see why are you saying
[1:48:46] these things we've got to keep an
[1:48:47] atmosphere of faith the right atmosphere
[1:48:50] around us because if God doesn't seem to
[1:48:52] answer straightaway and we say well
[1:48:54] maybe we didn't maybe he doesn't hear us
[1:48:56] or your doubt begins to come and what
[1:48:58] happens the atmosphere changes it
[1:49:00] changes from atmosphere of faith to
[1:49:02] doubt but we're called to only belief
[1:49:04] and he spake a parable on theme to the
[1:49:07] sin that men always ought to pray and
[1:49:10] not to faint saying the other deals in a
[1:49:12] city a judge which feared not God
[1:49:14] neither regarded man and there was a
[1:49:16] widow in that city and she came unto him
[1:49:18] saying avenge me of my adversary for he
[1:49:21] would not for a while but afterwards he
[1:49:23] said within himself though I fear not
[1:49:25] God nor regard man yet yet because of
[1:49:30] this widow trouble with me I will avenge
[1:49:32] her at least by her continual coming she
[1:49:35] weary me and the Lord said hear what the
[1:49:37] unjust
[1:49:37] sayeth and shall not God avenge his own
[1:49:40] elect which cry out day and night unto
[1:49:44] Him
[1:49:44] though he be along with them I tell you
[1:49:47] that he will avenge them speedily
[1:49:49] nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
[1:49:51] shall he find faith on the earth and the
[1:49:54] answer to that last part should be yes
[1:49:55] he shall curse Here I am
[1:49:57] and because he has put the faith the Son
[1:49:59] of God in my heart he will find faith
[1:50:01] upon the earth I mean best way you know
[1:50:03] when the devil's on our case and he says
[1:50:06] if this unjust judge would avenge the
[1:50:08] widow shall not God avenge us when a
[1:50:11] demon spirit comes it's sickness comes
[1:50:13] against us
[1:50:14] I mean mind battles comes against us
[1:50:16] trouble comes into the home shall not
[1:50:18] God avenge us shall not he deliver us
[1:50:21] shall not he cast the enemy out even if
[1:50:24] we crying to him day and night
[1:50:26] hallelujah yeah there's a big difference
[1:50:28] between praying and praying through a
[1:50:30] man you got to pray through sometimes
[1:50:33] it's short time sometimes it can be a
[1:50:34] long time I mean but I trust you know
[1:50:36] when you pray then that piece just comes
[1:50:38] down he has heard my petition the answer
[1:50:41] is on its way
[1:50:43] hallelujah and you have confidence lord
[1:50:45] I know you know the blood puts us back
[1:50:47] on speaking terms it puts us back on
[1:50:49] speaking terms with God the blood does
[1:50:51] hallelujah so we just go have conference
[1:50:54] father you hear my prayer hallelujah you
[1:50:57] know what I'm going through you're
[1:50:59] mindful of my situation amen so our God
[1:51:04] so we have to be like this amen
[1:51:08] the devil's on our case we go on his
[1:51:11] case now I want to read now this I want
[1:51:19] to read this let's struck me this week
[1:51:22] the resurrection of Jesus how do you do
[1:51:26] lady now this won't hurt you it's the
[1:51:28] Holy Spirit but such a wonderful
[1:51:30] anointing oh how dark it turns around
[1:51:33] this woman standing before me I see her
[1:51:36] moving in and some to her doctor's
[1:51:39] office Hospital but they keep shaking
[1:51:41] their head they don't know what's wrong
[1:51:42] with her that is right but he does know
[1:51:45] your main trouble is a nervous this is a
[1:51:48] nervous age this is a nervous age
[1:51:51] amen there's more people who are nervous
[1:51:53] now than there's ever been why cuz the
[1:51:56] nervous age it's a spasm like in the
[1:51:59] nerves it just causes you to feel
[1:52:01] horrible all the time they can't find it
[1:52:05] because it's a devil and the instruments
[1:52:07] won't show a spirit but he might have
[1:52:10] had from the x-ray but he can't hide
[1:52:12] from God looks right through him you
[1:52:14] believe obviously she says yes I do come
[1:52:17] here Oh Jehovah in the name of Jesus the
[1:52:19] Son of God
[1:52:20] your beloved doctors has tried to find
[1:52:22] them but he said but he can't hide from
[1:52:24] you come out of the woman thou evil
[1:52:26] spirit that's doing this thing in Jesus
[1:52:28] name rebuke thee and may she go on peace
[1:52:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:52:38] we feel amen
[1:52:40] there we okay many times I base how I
[1:52:43] will my walk on how I feel but it's the
[1:52:48] devil trying to rob us of our victory
[1:52:51] because the devil he can get into your
[1:52:54] flesh got into her nerves right he can
[1:52:58] get into our spirit realm what but he
[1:53:01] can't touch that soul I mean he cannot
[1:53:03] touch your soul if your soul is redeemed
[1:53:06] it's redeemed hallelujah how you feel in
[1:53:09] your spirit and your flesh does not

[1:53:22] devil can't take that from you he can't
[1:53:24] rob you of it I mean but sometimes we
[1:53:27] get sick or we have a spiritual trouble
[1:53:29] in our in a spiritual realm then we
[1:53:31] begin to say are we really believers do
[1:53:33] we really have the victory amen and our
[1:53:36] souls we have the victory
[1:53:37] we shouldn't be tossed to and fro by how
[1:53:40] we feel amen
[1:53:42] the devil takes our emotions and beats
[1:53:44] us around all day if we let them we feel
[1:53:48] down well I don't feel like praying well
[1:53:51] I don't feel like listening I don't feel
[1:53:53] like coming to church why cuz we're feel
[1:53:54] down and we pandering to our flesh and
[1:53:56] how we feel well I feel tired I tell you
[1:53:59] what if I came to church winner when I
[1:54:02] never felt tired I probably never be
[1:54:04] here

[1:54:08] don't we shouldn't let these things rob
[1:54:09] us he's following me
[1:54:11] I mean we're gonna press in a mint but
[1:54:14] yeah we can feel like we're gonna take a
[1:54:16] rapture the next moment we're down
[1:54:18] crash bang and we think well what's
[1:54:20] happened to us
[1:54:21] it's the devil trying to rob you of your
[1:54:25] victory you've got to recognize it as
[1:54:27] such amen
[1:54:29] why am I feeling Moody while I feeling
[1:54:31] down let's boil it down Satan
[1:54:36] amen you got to kick him out
[1:54:39] hallelujah you say well does that you
[1:54:43] know because remember we're not gonna go
[1:54:45] in a rapture based on a feeling of
[1:54:47] euphoria we're not taking your body
[1:54:50] changed because we all feel some great
[1:54:52] euphoric feeling the modern church has
[1:54:55] taken music and it's built people up in
[1:54:58] such a way that they feel such a
[1:55:00] euphoric feeling in their services and
[1:55:02] people think that they're having they're
[1:55:05] actually having communion with God and
[1:55:07] God's changing them just based on that
[1:55:08] feeling in the music Amen but that is
[1:55:13] not faith brother Baron speaks against
[1:55:16] intellectualism and what and but he
[1:55:20] doesn't just speak about intellectualism
[1:55:21] isn't just in the mind he speaks out in
[1:55:24] two lectures I'm just in your spirit
[1:55:25] realm so people just go up on emotion
[1:55:28] only with no faith behind it
[1:55:30] that's intellectualism I mean any see
[1:55:33] how they beat on the drums they get all
[1:55:35] worked up and excited he says that's
[1:55:36] just intellectualism people working in a
[1:55:38] spirit realm trying to fake a religion
[1:55:41] that's not faith following me you see
[1:55:45] the prophets of bale they danced around
[1:55:46] the altar it's not working what do we do
[1:55:49] they begin to cut themselves well they
[1:55:51] trying to they're trying to bring out a
[1:55:53] physical feeling trying to try to
[1:55:56] stimulate the flesh by cutting
[1:55:58] themselves what happens with music in
[1:56:01] the modern church they're trying to
[1:56:02] stimulate the flesh by the music amen
[1:56:07] isn't that right but we don't go by that
[1:56:10] that's not faith it's intellectualism
[1:56:14] amen
[1:56:15] real faith is God revealing his word to
[1:56:17] you
[1:56:18] amen I don't I'm not going in a rapture
[1:56:20] cuz I'm going to feel it in my emotions
[1:56:23] let's go to Hebrews 11 let's just let's
[1:56:27] just read this and then I'm gonna read
[1:56:28] one more thing and then I'm gonna you
[1:56:32] make it hard to quit let's go to let's
[1:56:35] go to Hebrews 11 and we read from verse
[1:56:45] 33 sorry it's not up on the board so you
[1:56:48] go to Hebrews 11 so it's not there it's
[1:56:50] in there now I just want to just before
[1:56:57] we read this this is what I want to
[1:56:59] emphasize here notice the state of these
[1:57:01] people okay I want you to notice the
[1:57:04] state of these people just as I are you
[1:57:07] there say I mean when you are there in
[1:57:09] Hebrews 11 you can't talk about your
[1:57:12] neighbor or maybe if you're looking but
[1:57:15] you know Hebrews 11 and verse 33 who
[1:57:23] through faith
[1:57:24] this is the mighty faith chapter
[1:57:26] hallelujah who through faith subdued
[1:57:28] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[1:57:32] promises stopped the mouths of lions
[1:57:35] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[1:57:39] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[1:57:41] were made strong waxed valiant in fight
[1:57:45] turned to flight the armies of the
[1:57:47] aliens woman received their dead raised
[1:57:49] to life again others were tortured not
[1:57:52] accepting deliverance that they might
[1:57:54] obtain a better resurrection others had
[1:57:57] trial of cruel mockings and scourgings
[1:58:00] yah more bonds and imprisonment they
[1:58:02] were stoned they were sawn asunder with
[1:58:04] tempted were slain with the sword they
[1:58:06] wandered about in sheepskins and
[1:58:08] goatskins being destitute afflicted
[1:58:11] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:58:15] worthy they wandered in deserts and
[1:58:17] mountains and dens and caves of the
[1:58:19] earth this is these are these are the
[1:58:23] people that the world is not worthy of
[1:58:25] it doesn't say they walked around with
[1:58:27] euphoria and we're rejoicing and
[1:58:30] everything was fine all the time
[1:58:31] and those had a glorious walk and
[1:58:33] nothing face them did we read that I
[1:58:35] didn't see that in there and so what we
[1:58:39] do is we have this idea it's gonna be
[1:58:41] some euphoric thing is going to come and
[1:58:44] nothing's going to bother us and but
[1:58:47] we're still human ah I think I'm pretty
[1:58:50] human so we still built the same way as
[1:58:53] everyone else but there's a seed in here
[1:58:56] that's been quickened by the word of the
[1:58:59] stage by the Holy Ghost and it's now
[1:59:01] come to life and it's living hallelujah
[1:59:04] bursting I got the same spirit realm the
[1:59:07] same same body as a any other man so the
[1:59:12] devil works in that realm to make us
[1:59:14] think we're not actually sealed into the
[1:59:16] kingdom in our soul you following me but
[1:59:20] that's what but I read that to say we
[1:59:23] not don't expect some euphoria sure
[1:59:26] there's moments of euphoria I'm not
[1:59:27] saying we should always be down and I'm
[1:59:30] told me to do them inflicted and you
[1:59:31] know it's not it's not always bad and
[1:59:34] that you know we should be following me
[1:59:37] I'm not trying to say we should be down
[1:59:38] and sad and armor I'm so glad I concern
[1:59:42] with you you know how's your walk pretty
[1:59:45] bad you know no it's wonderful it's
[1:59:49] glorious
[1:59:50] it's full of rejoicing hallelujah joy
[1:59:54] unspeakable full of glory we have those
[1:59:56] moments but the down moments do not take
[2:00:00] away what God has done right it doesn't
[2:00:03] rob us or take us away from what God has
[2:00:05] done a meant just because I feel down
[2:00:07] doesn't mean I don't believe anymore
[2:00:09] amen it doesn't mean my faith is gone no
[2:00:13] it's the devil trying to get me to think
[2:00:15] I don't believe or I have some kind of
[2:00:17] unbelief that's robbing me of the
[2:00:19] victory amen we got a we just got a
[2:00:24] walk-on but we're worried see your
[2:00:28] trouble is it's nervous and many times
[2:00:31] people went up in front of brother Brown
[2:00:32] and they had a nervous condition he
[2:00:35] never said they weren't Christians amen
[2:00:38] it's a nervous condition that got upon
[2:00:40] them and that's all they were was
[2:00:41] focusing upon that hey if you're if we
[2:00:45] put up with the devil what happens in
[2:00:48] the mind the devil pants a thought in
[2:00:50] your mind oh brother so-and-so do this
[2:00:53] will sister saw soda there's no what
[2:00:55] happens now you begin to be focused upon
[2:00:57] that and you become a prisoner to
[2:00:59] something that's probably not even real
[2:01:02] what's happening now you now focus upon
[2:01:04] that and now your emotions begin to
[2:01:07] manifest based on what you're thinking
[2:01:09] you know you think of a maybe I'll put a
[2:01:13] picture up you think of one of the most
[2:01:14] stressful days you've had you begin to
[2:01:17] think about long enough your body will
[2:01:18] begin to manifest itself because of the
[2:01:21] memory right or the greatest day you've
[2:01:24] had
[2:01:24] you're going to think about it long
[2:01:26] enough imagine your body will begin to
[2:01:28] matter if your emotions will manifest
[2:01:29] based on your memory right so the devil
[2:01:32] puts a thought in your mind your body
[2:01:34] will get the manifest based on their
[2:01:36] thought and we penned it to it we spend
[2:01:40] too much time maybe okay I spend too
[2:01:42] much time listening to the devil well
[2:01:45] you're looking at me like man who's this
[2:01:48] guy heat these up and he's brick you
[2:01:50] know why do we put up with his nonsense
[2:01:54] but that's why people get such a nervous
[2:01:56] condition because the devil comes in and
[2:01:58] yes we're gonna it's just a demon power
[2:02:00] trying to rob you of your health rob you
[2:02:03] of your joy robbed you of your peace I
[2:02:05] mean you gotta kick it out why do we
[2:02:08] live in fear oh this could happen well
[2:02:10] who says it could happen you know don't
[2:02:15] take a thought of tomorrow tomorrow take
[2:02:16] care of itself you know God's eyes on
[2:02:20] the sparrow I know he watches me and
[2:02:22] we're we're worth more than many
[2:02:24] sparrows and brother Brown tried to put
[2:02:26] a more of a you know add to that and say
[2:02:28] one soul is worth more than ten thousand
[2:02:30] worlds that's more than many sparrows
[2:02:33] hallelujah we shouldn't be too worried
[2:02:37] easy for you to say no we shouldn't be
[2:02:39] worried
[2:02:39] what are we get worried about things put
[2:02:42] it at the foot of the cross and move on
[2:02:44] and the devil you know what the devil
[2:02:45] does he says oh you dropped this tries
[2:02:47] to give it back to you are you gonna say

[2:02:55] have made it for me you know yes I

[2:03:13] I made it yeah he did
[2:03:14] I put a lot of thought into this for you
[2:03:17] he did how do you
[2:03:20] I've been thoughtful it's not I'm not
[2:03:22] accepting it you got it we got to come
[2:03:26] to a place where we just say no Satan
[2:03:28] knew now I just finished with this you
[2:03:35] can go but you can change it to the
[2:03:37] other song thing now it's really I
[2:03:39] didn't put it up here now brother Bram
[2:03:40] he has a vision of of a of a Mamba snake
[2:03:44] he see and this is from this is just
[2:03:47] from a paradox in 61 he says then comes
[2:03:50] the Mamba he's deaf he's so fast who you
[2:03:53] can't see him he goes over the top of
[2:03:56] the weeds and propels himself with the
[2:03:58] back of his towel just a swoosh and he's
[2:03:59] gone hits you in the face usually stands
[2:04:02] up high and strikes hard who seen a
[2:04:04] Mamba hopefully not in real life that'd
[2:04:06] be scary maybe some of you have but I
[2:04:08] just on YouTube or whatever man you
[2:04:11] should see them and when he hits you
[2:04:13] you've just got a few breaths till
[2:04:14] you're finished see to see don't only
[2:04:16] paralyze gets in the bloodstream it gets
[2:04:18] the nerves and everything you just die
[2:04:20] in a few seconds
[2:04:21] they're native boys and track boys eg
[2:04:23] say Mamba and they but the hissing it
[2:04:25] run scream that's death just in a few
[2:04:27] seconds see that's when one hits you and
[2:04:29] here he was on the high-waist now he's
[2:04:31] having a vision you know we're walking
[2:04:32] the highway it's a narrow way within the
[2:04:34] highway so now he's saying now here's
[2:04:36] this Mamba this devil on the highway
[2:04:38] right I thought well this is it so I
[2:04:41] looked at him and he looked angry at me
[2:04:43] and he licked his tongue and here he
[2:04:45] come and when he got real close to me he
[2:04:47] would run up fast and then he'd get
[2:04:49] slower and slow and just quiver and stop
[2:04:51] and then something would hold him off he
[2:04:55] wouldn't he couldn't bite me he would
[2:04:57] turn around on the other side try to
[2:04:59] approach from this side and he'd go back
[2:05:01] and get a start and swish right towards
[2:05:03] me get slower and slower and slower and
[2:05:04] then to a stop and when he would then he
[2:05:07] would shake like that and move back he
[2:05:08] couldn't strike me then he turned and
[2:05:10] looked at my friend and
[2:05:13] he went after my friend I see my friend
[2:05:15] just running way in the air and over him
[2:05:17] and over and over trying and the thing
[2:05:19] was striking out I thought oh if ever
[2:05:21] had some it'll be instant death no
[2:05:24] wonder everybody's so scared cause when
[2:05:27] this thing hits you it's instant death
[2:05:29] and it was just striking at him like
[2:05:31] that and I threw up my hands and said Oh
[2:05:33] God have mercy on my brother I said if
[2:05:36] that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill
[2:05:38] him and just then the serpent turned to
[2:05:40] me and when I said that it looked at me
[2:05:43] again and a voice from above me said you
[2:05:45] have been given power to bind him the
[2:05:48] worst of any amen and I said well God
[2:05:52] what must I do he said there's one thing
[2:05:55] you must do you must be more sincere see
[2:05:57] you must be more sincere I said well God
[2:05:59] forgive me for my own unseen serie T and
[2:06:03] let me have sincerity and when I raised
[2:06:05] up my hands again to meet him there was
[2:06:07] a great something come over me just
[2:06:09] lifted me up seemed like my whole body's
[2:06:11] was charged with something and I looked
[2:06:13] at the serpent and when he started
[2:06:15] towards me he couldn't do it yet and I
[2:06:18] see it Satan in the name of the Lord
[2:06:20] Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent
[2:06:23] a blue smoke flew out of him and he
[2:06:25] curled up like a capital S backwards at
[2:06:27] your ensign and it means buying this one
[2:06:31] and anything below him because he was
[2:06:34] the worst blue smoke flew out of him and
[2:06:37] his tail choked choke his own self to
[2:06:41] death round his head and there was a
[2:06:43] backward S and and s is like conjunction
[2:06:45] as he choked her to death
[2:06:46] and the brother was free and it went
[2:06:48] over and I meshed on it and I'm asked on
[2:06:52] it I mean I said now I've got to find
[2:06:55] out about this because it's a vision and
[2:06:57] I had it and I had on the other thing it
[2:06:59] turned like this it looked like a handle
[2:07:01] like a glass handle of a picture just
[2:07:03] like solid crystal I said think of it
[2:07:05] how quick that blue smoke was life and
[2:07:07] everything I had left at all the
[2:07:09] elements and it turned to glass and then
[2:07:11] a voice said again you can unbind him
[2:07:13] also and I said then Satan that I might
[2:07:16] know I unbind you and when it did he
[2:07:18] started coming back to life again
[2:07:20] wriggling I said I bind you back in the
[2:07:22] name of Jesus Christ and when it did the
[2:07:24] Chris the smoke flew out of him again
[2:07:27] and he choked them so I read that about
[2:07:28] you have the power to bind and to loose
[2:07:31] he says well you know but then when I
[2:07:34] always hit the bit where you've got to
[2:07:35] be more sincere I say the brightest
[2:07:38] sincere I mean I just say this this is
[2:07:42] just my little this is just me and
[2:07:43] fellowship now many times we read you
[2:07:46] have to be more sincere and we think now
[2:07:48] we have to get somewhere before we have
[2:07:50] it
[2:07:50] but brother Brown said help me forgive
[2:07:52] me my own sincerity make me more sincere
[2:07:54] and then he had the powder bind and
[2:07:56] loose so it's just a simple prayer Lord
[2:07:58] make me more sincere forgive me for my
[2:08:00] own sincerity I don't want to be on
[2:08:02] sincere I want to be more sincere that I
[2:08:04] can bind the devil the most powerful and
[2:08:07] the ones all underneath them I mean that
[2:08:09] my brother can go free I mean that this
[2:08:11] spirit will not affect anyone around me
[2:08:14] but it will be bound it will be
[2:08:15] ineffective will be disabled hallelujah
[2:08:19] we have that power we have that power to
[2:08:24] day hallelujah that power is in the
[2:08:27] Bride of Christ I mean we have the
[2:08:30] authority to bind the devil just like
[2:08:32] Moses you know you know I've seen it
[2:08:34] before Moses went in before Pharaoh
[2:08:35] Pharaoh his honest crown was a Cobra you
[2:08:39] go look at their crowns of Egypt and
[2:08:41] because he was considered a God and so
[2:08:44] now here comes he comes Moses with her
[2:08:46] stuff he throws it on the ground it
[2:08:49] turns into a snake he picks it up it
[2:08:52] turns into a stuff and he can do that as
[2:08:54] much as he wants binds and looses and
[2:08:56] Moses is telling Pharaoh he's actually
[2:08:59] telling the devil I have power to loose
[2:09:01] you I have the power to bind you
[2:09:04] I can loose you when I will I can bind
[2:09:06] you and I will you can't stop me you
[2:09:08] cannot stop me nothing you can do will
[2:09:11] stop me let my people go and that was
[2:09:14] God speaking through Moses and first
[2:09:15] person let my people go
[2:09:17] still got the power to bind and the
[2:09:19] powder loose and it's the same thing
[2:09:21] friends with you and I we have the power
[2:09:24] to bind the devil and the power to loose
[2:09:26] the devil whenever we will you just got
[2:09:28] to speak the word don't be afraid to
[2:09:31] speak the word talk to the Lord about it
[2:09:33] tell the devil to get out hallelujah
[2:09:36] amen whoa I've got to feel something no
[2:09:39] you got to believe it
[2:09:40] you got to go by what you believe
[2:09:42] because the devil always beats us down
[2:09:44] when you don't feel like enough faith
[2:09:46] and then you can't speak it well no I
[2:09:48] don't go by my feelings you know I've
[2:09:51] had times and I've prayed fella I'm
[2:09:53] gonna take a rapture but then I've had
[2:09:55] times when I've prayed
[2:09:56] I felt dead as a post and gods moved
[2:09:59] amen we had little Annelise little
[2:10:02] newborn she had she had a real bad
[2:10:04] tongue tie needed not just a snip in the

[2:10:08] round her tongue we just prayed I felt
[2:10:11] dead as a post Lord before the end and
[2:10:14] she's book done to go to the hospital to
[2:10:15] get it done I said Lord before the
[2:10:18] surgeon cuts her tongue may he not find
[2:10:20] a tongue tie what's their defect I
[2:10:22] thought did as apposed I wasn't on cloud
[2:10:25] nine and feel like I was gonna take
[2:10:26] rapture as we asked Christine takes her
[2:10:29] into the surgery going into the surgery

[2:10:38] die here and there was a tanked idea
[2:10:42] very strong tongue tie I felt did as
