you don't you just love to sing his Praises amen we'll have some testimonies now anyone that's up for it I know Andre wants to share something so we'll start with you [Music] Andre good morning it's lovely to be here again today um just something that was really that was revealed to me during last last um Sunday sermon and it was just so amazing and it just blows me away every single time when I think about it um I think if you would all agree last week's sermon was a bit of a reprimand me putting us right where we need to be putting us where the Lord W the Lord is a jealous God and it was just so amazing while Ben was saying something and he was saying um I can't quite remember what he said but he said that we need to we need to leave it we need to let go of this certain thing and at that moment when he stopped Andy said God have mercy on us and it was just so amazing how God is putting us right but he's covering us with his mercy and I just every time I think about it it's amazing it it's just amazing that his Mercy is setting us right just every time when we surrender he will cover us with his Mercy cuz that's what he wanted and I just wanted to share that with you guys hallelujah amen is there anyone else that would like to share praise the Lord um it's good to be here um I came here looking for answers and um sister Tony Anne who is my daughter-in-law said to me I bet you'll get answers when you go down there and last night the lord well this morning the Lord vot me I put about 27 minutes past two or something and I was awake for a couple of hours so I got my answer um and it was really simple and I know that everybody every saint of God is in the same um situation that we are suffering persecution for righteousness sake and I my answer was this I will defend my name you defend what I have given you so you defend what the Lord has given you you defend it you defend it with your life if need be but he will defend his name so oh I was really blessed I praise the Lord amen [Applause] amen I know I've shared this with some of you but I just want to encourage everyone uh when we just moved here for those that don't know we were burgled and at the time when we were burgled there were two things I prayed for the Lord to give back to me and that was my jewelry because it was just sentimental it's not something you can replace and they' stolen the hard drive with my boys crawling for the first time and walking for the first time and that's just stuff that you can't get back ever so um it was my prayer the couple of days afterwards I'd been cleaning the house and they' left the jewelry box in my passage cupboard with when they were looking for more bags and that so I got my jewelries back and I was like oh okay just the photos and I even wrote a letter into the newspaper and I asked the people please if you have it just bring the hard drive I don't care about anything else but that never happened so two years on Mom's now visiting and um her and Dad have decided to leave her laptop with me and so we were looking at photos the other night of her holiday and she's got stuff saved on her computer of my boys crawling and walking and do you know that I didn't even realize the Lord had actually answered my prayer had to drop that thought in my head and said but you prayed for this two years ago and I'm giving it back to you and it wasn't how I imagined it at all but I have some of my stuff back and I just want to praise the Lord for answering prayers in ways we don't always understand and not even in a time frame that we' expected in so thank you to him amenah [Applause] anyone else yes um I'll just quick I won't go up there because I bad enough here um my uh you know how we take prayers and we take prayers from our extended family back home and one of the prayers that we prayed for at a prayer meeting was for my mom um I don't know if you remember that she didn't really like her job she was a tax collector and she hated it she'd have to turn up at people's places in the country and um tell them that you know you're going to lose your farm and you know it's not a fun job I could imagine and um so anyway so we we prayed for a job for her and you know you think you I just love that song the lord loves Paradox cuz he works ways that we don't know about anyway so she stayed there at this job and we were praying for I was praying for another job and you know and um anyway so she stays there then people get um laid off so she has to take over two other people's jobs that she normally doesn't so she's getting overworked um and anyways long story short she um this year just recently it's been going on for a couple months now but um they same job but now she's an admin and she works from home so and and she gets paid what she's supposed to get paid and she's got a yeah she loves it so um praise the Lord she he's oh he's an answering prayer God [Applause] amen okay before I left to South Korea I was kind of a depressed you know all the pressure from work and the house it was kind hard for me but one of my sister she's primary school teacher she told me when you come to South Korea you will be different so I kind of hope of my you know thing and after that I came back from South Korea really God is so good to me and then I feel so happier and even though a lot of pressure from I me work because I have to do kind of work after during one month but you know I so Rejoice you know in the Lord and I feel so you know happy and even though just you know I mean even though I'm actually my stuff said oh Hanah you look different and you're so joyful so praise the Lord God is so good to me and they even though in South Korea my family so you know actually they fed me very well so actually kind of I put on my weight on but except that you know I can see their love and passion towards to me and then I can see the light of God moving to South Korea as well so praise the Lord thank [Applause] you that's wonderful and then of course aliser isn't that great isn't that wonderful we've prayed so long for that and what did the judge say one of the most extraordinary cases that she seen amen our Lord doesn't do halfway amen that's right KY [Applause] Kelly so Alis will be watching this so this he us to do this next week um so basically um you know he got taken down to two years which was huge anyway just from his effort and I know from the Lord as well cuz the word miracle was used quite a lot so um that's what it was really um but never before someone's been taken down to two years jail time and never been given home detention so it truly was exceptional and it truly was the Lord and um this is no denying it so um hopefully aliser can give us a really good testimony next week and but thank you all so much just seriously it's just amazing that's wonderful [Applause] you m our kids you saw America right in front of your eyes that's awesome Amen let's [Music] stand

it's a wonderful day just a reminder we've got the uh Sunday school meeting afterwards and then there's the uh band practice for uh for Harmony and everything directly after that um if you have your Bibles handed you want to turn with me to Genesis chapter 1 and we'll go to verse 26 now I'm going to go to Isaiah chapter 14 so it says in Genesis 1 and 26 I me everyone's there it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so Man created so God created Man In His Image uh in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and he blessed them and said unto them be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over all the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so God has commanded you will have dominion let's go to Isaiah 14 Isaiah 14 and and from verse 9 I'm glad the scripture is always true for us and our enemy amen hell from beneath is moved for to meet Thee I mean moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it has raised up from their Thrones all the kings of Nations all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy vials the worm is spread under the and the worms cover thee how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground that did US weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon on thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble and that shake Nations that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats so I want to um continue uh in our thought of of uh what what men want but I really want to take it now the the other way is that uh God wants you to know who you are and God wants you to know your position we read there in Genesis chapter 1 that man was given dominion over the Earth so he was made a God over the Earth we understand that God is God of the universe but he he he allowed man to have dominion over his creation which is the Earth but through the fall Satan uh Satan dethroned man and now Satan is the god of this world the scripture says about the God of the God of this evil age has blinded people and you know it speaks about uh in in in Ephesians and we'll read it later about how he's the prince of the power of the year he he where one time Adam had control over all things Adam lost that God part of himself and he was now a slave to you know Satan but I just want to say from the get-go where you know if you're wondering where I'm going with this service it's very simple the and you the powers of hell are not were not ordained to be your master they were not ordained to be your lord angels are servants amen angels are servants doesn't matter if they're fallen or if they're not Fallen Angels were created to be the Servants of man amen amen to to be the Servants of God so Satan and his angels were never ordained to have dominion over man but man was ordained to have dominion over the devil amen so that's where I'm going that's basically what I'm going to say in a nutshell so I just but I want this to Anchor in because you got to understand the blood of Jesus Christ you know we were not created to be slaves of Darkness we were not created to for because the thing that rules us is our Lord and it can be God or it can be Satan but I just say from the get-go Satan was never ordained to be your lord he was never ordained to be your king he was never ordained to be in charge of you but you were ordained to be in a place higher than him amen here is the we we'll read in Ezekiel he's anointed cheer of that cover he was the right-hand man of God so to speak he was an archangel but he was lifted up with pride in his heart and he was cast down but so he was he was right up there but servants are never in the same category as as the family of the king that's right they're not even in the same category they cannot become family they cannot become blood relation to the king the children must be born of the king he they must come out of the king and if they've come out of the king the his DNA is in the children amen and it's because there his DNA in the children that makes them royalty Hallelujah and we ourselves and our Humanity there's nothing good in us but in our souls there's a part of God I mean there's a gan seed God put there before the foundation of the world and because that part of him was placed in us before the foundation of the world he can't lose a part of himself he cannot lose a part of himself that's the one impossibility as he cannot lose a part of himself Jesus said all that the father has given me has already given me will come to me and all that come to me are no wise cast out and we know the words of Jesus never fail he says Heaven and Earth may pass away but my word will never pass away so if he said all that have been given to me will come they're going to come Hallelujah now we read in so in Acts chapter 3 well I'll just say this before I read the scripture we understand we're in a time of restoration where this Fallen uh Adam's Fallen race is being placed back to where it should be in its position so we're in a and and in this time of restoration it's not just the truth of the scripture being restored but is the believer's position in Christ is being restored and Peter spake in Acts 3 and 20 and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began so there must be a restoration of a people back that Satan has no dominion over them but they have dominion over Satan oh hallelujah amen and we just happen to be living in that day and hour amen amen you turned up at the right time amen hallelujah to enjoy the full benefits of Calvary you turned up at the right time amen hallelujah hallelujah now we we have to understand a few things brother Brown tells us in in in the in the message pardon in 63 he says when man sinned in the Garden of Eden he crossed a great CM separating himself from the Eternal one man at that time was eternal with God he had no sickness sorrow or death man was not made to die yep hell was not made for man hell was created for the devil and his angels and not for mankind because they were created on Earth to be Sons and Daughters of God amen amen so we were not made man was not made for hell man was not made to be lost man was made amen hell was created the scripture tells us for the devil and his angels it was created for that purpose and that purpose alone and it wasn't made for mankind now but when man sinned and stepped across the boundary line between right and wrong he separated himself from God leaving himself no way back he was totally lost he could not come back because he had sinned but God rich in Mercy accepted a substitute because he had said the day you eat thereof that day you die and God's justice and Holiness required death because it's his word and he must keep his word in order to be God the love that he had for the human race and yet had to see them separated from him and the fellowship that he had with his children in the Garden of Eden and that heartbroken condition that he that he had to be in all that time because his word said the day you eat thereof the day you'll die then we can rely upon this whatever God says is true it must come to pass God cannot take his word back because he's infinite he's Eternal and his first decision is uh alltime decision he doesn't have to take back because he learned more about it so what he declared will be will be now in Ephesians 2 and 1 Paul Paul begins to uh tell the Believers there of their previous condition that they were once uh they were sorry my let's just go to Ephesians 2 and 1 so man remember after after Adam fell man has been under Dominion of devils it has been whether we like it or not man was has come into a fallen condition you know and we have been under Satan has become the Lord but he was never meant to be the Lord of mankind am mean that's why you've got to you've got to when when when sickness strikes you all sickness is from devil you know you know you know from Satan or or you become to be wward in your walk and you know you get a you your your your temper may rise or you may get unforgiveness in you or bitterness or whatever it may be you've got to recognize that is from that is from the devil and he's trying to become your ruler and your master because those things will lead you in a certain way and it becomes your Lord amen amen and so but you've got to recognize those things were not ordained to lead you you were meant to be the head and not the tail you are meant to be the boss and he has to be under your feet amen amen we have you God has ordained he says my bride will be join ear with me the scripture tells us we join is with Christ and if he's ordained the bride to be in that position she's going to be in that position and no power in Hell nothing on the earth or under the Earth can stop her Rising amen nothing can stop you rising to your position but you must recogn eyes of God's ordained me to be thus I'm going to be thus and nothing can stop it Amen brother Bram he you know he gave the testimony he saw a vision about two years before it happened of a of a boy that was killed in a car accident and he described it how was a foreign kind of dress and a very mountainous kind of country and he and he prayed for the boy and he came back to life and then when he was in Finland the whole scene came back to him and he said you could line every devil up in hell and it wouldn't stop that boy coming back to life cuz God ordained to come back to life am amen if that's just for Natural Life to Come how much more amen the bride of Christ coming to her position it has to happen there's nothing can stop it happening that's right Hallelujah but Satan will do everything he can but you've got to recognize he's not your lord sickness is not your lord temp is not your lord unforgiveness is not your lord bitterness is not your lord lust is not your lord whatever it may be that's that's you know some some addiction I've got Cravings whom the son has set free is free indeed when God took alcohol from me I never had a craving since that day till now amen amen thank you Lord hallelujah so you know we have to recognize these things have been ordained to be under our feet Hallelujah now and you have he quickened who were dead and trespassed and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year that that's the spirit that now work work in the children of Disobedience among whom also you all had our conversation which is Manner of Life and Times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and has raised us up together and made us sit made us sit together in heaven ly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of yourselves for it is a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen if you've been ordained you're going to do it amen Hallelujah so he's saying that one time we walked according to the prince of the power of the air so we it was our Lord Satan was our master and so he was on he was on the throne of our heart but then but then what happened is one day the word came your way and the preaching of the true word of God dethroned Satan out of a person's life and then God becomes becomes your ruler and your Lord amen hallelujah so so the preaching of the Gospel the you know is to Dethrone Satan from every heart that will that will want to kick him out cuz you've got to agree to get rid of him amen if you hold on to him and and and and defend him well he's not going to be dethroned but if you see him for what he is and recognize Satan you're not meant to be my Lord and Master I was created to worship God I was created to be for God to be my head Hallelujah that's what we're created for are we not amen if we you know if you recognize that then then Satan must go that's right Hallelujah so and one times past he was our Lord but now he's not our Lord that's right one times we walked according to what he made us do but now we do not that's right amen because someone else is taking up residence and nothing is greater than our God Amen Hallelujah now that's what he that's what was uh that's what has happened I trust it's happened to you amen amen then then in Galatians it says that we were you know we were under tutors and governors until the time appointed to the father is Galatians 4:1 even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption or placing of sons and this is the hour where the Sons and Daughters of God receive their placing or adoption amen because if you look at that Greek word it means a placing and adoption is a placing amen it doesn't mean that you were not relation to the father amen because it says in the scripture because you were Sons he sent forth the spirit where you cry Abba Father because you were not because you became amen you know we have to really I I I trust this really mean something to you a little bit you know we don't become Sons and Daughters of God because we accepted oh Jesus you died for me the reason you accepted and he and he transforms your life is because you were amen he saw through the space of time he knew when you wouldd be born he says there's my child there's my son there's my daughter and Now's the Time acceptable where I'm going to meet them and they're going to recognize that this is not their family their natural family even you know but their real parent is me amen the real parent is me I'm their father I'm their mother I birth them into the world Hallelujah that's why it's so such a powerful thing when when when something in you says I know I'm a child of the king am I know I'm I you know and it's not a mental thing but something in your soul says I know Lord Jesus you birth me forth I'm part of you amen we have the same DNA not natural DNA now but in our souls amen amen that's right if you're a child of the king you cannot unbecome a child of the king amen and if you I put it the other way I don't believe I'm talking to anyone here but if you're not a child of the king you never will be but if all that come to me no wise cast out amen hallelujah so what security so we don't become wait and because you are Sons God sent forth the spirit of a son into your hearts crying Abba Father or my father my father wherein Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a in the a of God through Christ how be it then when you knew not God you did service unto them which by Nature are no Gods so you serve something we all serve something there was actually not meant to be a God but we we put ourselves under the thing and did obedience to it and it became Our God amen amen by but now after that you you have known God or rather known of God how turn you again to the weak and bigly elements wherein you desire again to be in bondage so Paul is saying you are Sons he made you Sons why are you turning back and serving a religion amen CU they try to mix the LA in with Grace remember Grace is a Divine influence upon the heart to to live the word that's what Grace is amen amen God's Great Grace like Lord I'm Bound free me and he frees you that's his grace Lord help me I want to serve you and he and he anoints you and and now you can serve him amen it's his ability Hallelujah I'm glad that's the case Hallelujah now that's why in this hour there's in Zechariah there's a scripture it says we will bring forth the head headstone where C Grace Grace unto us amen cuz when Christ comes to cap off his church the Believers when they see the head Stone coming down and he's come down upon many he's kept many but when you see him come down what's that that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost I me but when you see him come down all you can cry is Grace Grace amen that's not yeah I deserved it all you say is Grace Grace with shoutings amen with glory and Thanksgiving Hallelujah glory to his name now this whole world this whole all of nature is in bondage to to to Darkness that's why nature is falling apart because Satan has got into Fallen man and has caused us world to fall apart like it is that's why people don't like it but the truth is man is inherently evil yes that's right man in his Fallen condition is inherently evil if man was inherently good we would have a Eden upon the Earth we would have a millennium cuz we have the technology to eradicate all all poverty we have the ability to feed every mouth amen we have the ability to eradicate diseases where they say oh it's such an epidemic but the drug companies hold back things people are dying in third world countries and rich people in the west are saying no I'm not going to give you the drug they could synthesize it they could do it we spend a lot I spent a lot of time University studying synthetic chemistry how they make how they produce drugs but they what they do is companies they put a copyright or a patent on a certain molecule and that means other companies can't come and just change a little bit to perhaps improve it and it's stuck like that and they won't just make it open source if man was inherently good it would become open source how's your billion dollars profit awesome but you're killing you're allowing people to die and people are starving the world produces more food than it needs but yet we have famine countries will spend billions of dollars on weapons that can wipe out hemispheres and yet we have poverty what is wrong cuz man is under the Dominion of Satan that's right amen man is under that dominion and so but it says in Romans 8:16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen and if children then ears and ears of God and Joint ears with Christ if so be that we suffer that we may also be glorified together for I reckon the sufferings of this present time so I need to go to the this is go to Romans 8 I have a confession the color ink and my printer ran out I can't see half the [Music] words that's all right God Marches On amen amen 8 and 16 so not creation itself is is waiting for us to come to our position it says for I reckon the sufferings of the present time wait where are we and if okay yes for so Verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature which is that word is creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God or the revealing for the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and to the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body so the whole creation is groaning and waiting waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because it's looking for Adam to return it's looking for Adam and Eve to return and take their position and we happen to be living in that hour amen amen so we read there that Satan uh so just just backtracking so Satan desired to become like the most high he wanted he wanted to become like God and it says in the scripture the God of this evil agees blinded the people so he has his his intention there before the foundation of the world to become like the most high has become manifested but that is not the end of the story there's always a to be continued and the final chapter of the story is that he will be cast down amen amen into the pit you know down into hell into the sides of the pit and we read the scripture there that they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee so it doesn't say everyone will see him but they that see him and we see him in this hour amen cuz we see his workings we can identify now that's the devil that's the devil that's the devil you know because the word has come to EXP expose Satan's workings that's why brother said with the opening of the seals he says we're just stripping him down we're exposing him so you can see what he was doing in Genesis you can see in the middle of the Bible and you can see at the end of the Bible yes I mean you can see from Calvary to now the workings of Satan and how he's uh Bewitched the whole world and we can look at those things and say that's just the devil veiled you know he you know he's he he's hidden an open view or you know Plain View but the world gets caught up in all these different things but we can see it for what it is and it's not conspiracy cuz it's in the scripture amen that's right amen so these whole things so that's not the end of the story but he will come down to nothing he will fall from his position he exalted himself above he says I'll make my throne above the stars of God but that would not be his final resting place but his final resting places will be a lake of fire amen but we have to uh there has to be a group of people that in their lives cast down Satan now this is the age of the dethroning of Satan this is the age of the casting down of his kingdom amen this is the age of where Satan is under the feet of the believer in every fcet amen amen amen that is this is the hour we're living in where where the bride of Christ has dominion over her enemy yes sir you know we read in Genesis the first prophecy of jesus' coming was the seed of the woman will bruise the head the seed of The Serpent and that was the first promise of Jesus coming in the flesh to undo everything The Serpent and the devil thre the serpent did and so now we must understand one thing the husband and the wife are one amen so what the husband is the wife is what the wife is the husband is because they're identified together you know a it's very you know simple if you think about it a male dog and a female dog have the same kind of character istics amen monkey and monkey you know everything male and female they have all the same kind of characteristics so if God is looking for a people he'll be looking for a people that have the same characteristics as him the same way as him so now if the husband if the man is a serpent Bruiser amen if the husband is the one who is a devil defeater amen who who prove his dominion over Satan and all the Devils under him over nature over death over everything sickness that was what he demonstrated in the days of his flesh Hallelujah that's why I read the scripture he was demonstrating I'm God in flesh and I have dominion over you Satan I can bind you I can loose you I know I say it many times but Moses was a type of the seed of the woman you know as a shadow and he came into he you know he you know he came into Egypt Egypt was a superpower of the of the world Pharaoh believed he was God the Pharaohs believed they were God so was Satan and pharaoh and God in Moses and he came there the first thing he did is he cast down his rod and became a serpent I believe it would have become a cobra because the Cobra was the emblem of the Pharaoh and he and he loosed him and then he picked that you know and then he picked out by the tail Aaron did and it became a rod and he was demonstrating to Satan I can loose you I can bind you I have dominion and then he said and then Pharaoh said I won't let your people go so God said I'm just going to reain curse upon you I'm going to curse your Gods that's why the curses fell on the night and he brought the Flies and he brought the flogs and the Darkness and all those things he was demonstrating every God you have exalted I have brought down that they would know that God is God hallelujah and he delivered his people but it wasn't just the end of it now after 40 years in the wilderness a generation Rose that's right and they believed that they weren't slaves and they believe they were the promised ones and they believe they were the sons and daughters of God and they believe they could take the land and that same God that delivered them out of Egypt now Came Upon a generation hallelujah hallelujah hello generation and they took land and they and they broke down Jericho and they defeated the enemy and Joshua standing there said Sun stand still Moon stand still until we defeat our foes what was that now God inspiring a man never been written before but he inspired to do it he felt led to do it nature obeyed the voice of a man under the blood of bulls and ghosts Hallelujah wasn't even a prophet just a man in his position and if that was the case under the blood of bulls and goat how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ amen how much more those who become join ear with Christ the Old Testament Believers were not join ear cuz they're under the blood of bulls and goats they could never animal blood you with me animal blood could never elevate a people above sin it just covered their sin so it could never raise them up but the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't just cover sin it annihilate sin it annihilates your past it annihilates your first birth the you know the court of Heaven has no record of of anything you've ever done I mean once you come under the blood of Jesus Christ and by coming under that now well how do you come under that the spirit of God comes into you well how do I do that you give a full surrender every facet Lord take me and make me thine amen and that lifts you up now so you're a joint ear Hallelujah so here's the first Adams that was just in type that's why the prophets could come and Elijah could stand there on Mount carel and Just sh down you know kill all the old uh prophets of baale and do what they did they did great exploits amen amen cuz that was now the serpent Bruiser was coming down am mean David could take full possession of the promised land but that was just in Shadow and then now the the real serpent Bruiser Jesus Christ came and he didn't just have dominion over a natural enemy but Satan Was Defeated amen all the devils in hell you got to remember if the head Devils defeated all the ones under them are defeated and that day on Calvary when when when the Stinger of death was yanked out of his side amen youo the devil was no he would have been rejoicing I finally got him I couldn't get him when he casted me out of here I had a legion of people and one of his children but they got cast out you know he just said a word and they had to go but now I've got him he's hanging there and then death came this big buzzing bee coming around with it Stinger saying and he's probably no doubt saying I'm going to enjoy this one I enjoy putting it into Moses I enjoy putting it into Joshua and King David and all those ones but now I'm really going to get one I'm going to enjoy it and he what you know how the devil does he likes to relish things you know but then he put the stinger and then an invisible hand came he couldn't pull it outall remember when a bee rips a your rips a stinger out it begins to die Hallelujah it begins to die amen and now our Prophet your Prophet told you Satan is like an animal with a broken back after Calvary have you ever seen an animal with a broken back it has no control it has no control Hallelujah now if that was the if that was the groom I'm going to read some things he says this now God this is from it's the rising of the Sun God has never separated the bride from the groom yet this speaking on Calvary so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one the same word the the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom came and he uh and he wouldn't be for the bride and when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards um the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said should be in these last days you following me don't she have to return through Malachi 4 don't you have to be manifested like it was in the days of Sodom don't the word world have to be exactly like this isn't these things a perfect identification of God made known to us so he says the word that speaks for the groom speaks for the bride see here here's the first Adam had dominion over everything he did perfect Dominion amen amen he was he was tired in a boat back of a boat all those Devils because remember the devil controls mhm the weather that's why we have the typhoons and all these terrible things so he's asleep in the back of a boat weary from the meetings he's had all the Devils swore th drown him now we'll get him and now there was a power battle who really made who really made nature who really made nature and so and so here's the devil believing he's in control whips up a big storm the disciples are scared but they have Jesus in the boat with them hello disciples how are we today and then so they got all scared but then they woke him up we'll perish and he just says peace be still he didn't say B he said peace be still and the winds and waves had to obey him the creation the you the creation had to obey the voice of the Creator and God was demonstrating I made this that's right because the thing that you know the one that makes it is in control so he was demonstrating devil you didn't make this this is not yours this is mine I'm showing on you know showing I'm in control how much more now that's the he had Dominion over death he had dominion over all manner of disease every every disease and he had dominion over nature amen and he had dominion over his own flesh amen hallelujah amen if that's for the bride how much I mean for the groom how much more the bride amen by his sacrifice on Calvary it elevates her into a position remember we're not called to be servants we're not the devil's slaves amen amen we're not called to be the devil's slaves if you're a slave to the devil you're out of your position let this be a change in position service amen and so we're not ordained to be those things but he's ordained to be under us amen the same thing now this is in the rising of the sun again as well speaking of Elijah's bones and then Elijah and Elisha the quickening power was still on them bones when there was no Bones still on job there wasn't a spoonful of dust left of his body but the quickening power was still there if this spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he'll also Quicken your mortal body notice quickly you say oh I wish I Liv back you live in a better time now if you I see you putting down some scriptures 1 Thessalonians 4:16 notice how beautiful and the saints that are sleep in Christ will God will bring with them saints in the grave resting like Elijah was some like Elisha was some of them uh some of them will be quickened some will be taken some will be in the grave they'll go and the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air the quickening power on the living the quickening power on the dead amen amen to those who already dead in Christ there's quickening power upon them that same spirit is upon us amen the same quickening power presented in both of these prophets Elijah and Elisha that same quickening power look their names are almost the same Elisha and Elijah see the bride and the groom one of them is Mr Jesus represents Mr Jesus the other one is Mrs Jesus see amen almost the same Elijah see how represented there now Elisha was taken up I mean Elijah was taken up in the Rapture so the same The Same Spirit that was upon Elijah Came Upon Elisha amen and that is a that that represents Elijah represents Christ and Elisha represents us that's it and elishah did twice the amount of Miracles as Elijah did amen but the same life that was on him was on Elisha Hallelujah and Elisha the same God did the same things in the same ways amen amen and he's saying it's the same thing as you the bride and I mean the groom and you amen now there's a modern events made clear by prophecy I happen to believe what he say that's why I'm reading these things these things are powerful because we have to something has to click in us saying that we're he's made us joint ears yes joint ears so everything he did we fall a too amen so if he had Dominion If he if he conquered hell death in the grave because of a joint a we fall a to it amen hallelujah amen notice now they had done to him just exactly what the prophet said they would do just as they would doing just as they are doing in this very same day in the Lan age if you want to look at it read Revelations 3 blind naked and don't know it when he begins to reveal himself in the seed form again the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride just the bride and the groom is the same Flesh and Blood the same Ministry the same things doing exactly what he done so he's saying the same thing you read about in the book of Acts and in the gospels you will demonstrated again that same life producing the same life will be back again with the same Ministry amen the same things doing exactly just what he done and we see it around the world I mean we as a people coming to their position Satan is being Dethrone hallelujah amen I trust you can identify you can identify with what God is doing not that yester you would just agree with it but you see your life is in unity with what's going on Hallelujah now you say well I'm just a little old me but you got to see what Jesus has made you what what you ordained to be amen what are you ordained to be cuz if he's ordained you to be a certain thing you have to be it because all of all of Heaven is behind you coming into your position nothing can stop nothing in this hour can stop his kingdom come Hallelujah it's like a you know brother B tells a story about a little policeman 2x4 little guy with a badge he says the policeman doesn't have the power to stop the traffic but he's got the authority to stop the traffic because all the city is behind that policeman if that's just a little bit of policeman with a natural law behind him how much more are people Redeemed by the blood where all of Heaven is behind that person I mean we may not have the power but we have the Authority amen God when you became a Believer God gave you the badge of a Believer and all you have to do is hold up that badge and say Satan amen I'm a Believer that's right see this this is the Seal of the king the king of Heaven that cast you out Hallelujah and he has to obey your voice that's right I believe it I mean let's go to Revelations chapter 12 just here's a reason why I'm repeating myself I really want this to sink in you got to you got it's not just singing dominions being given to the family of the king something's got to Anchor in I have dominion I have the authority every devil must be under my feet amen Angels were never made to take your place amen angels have nothing to do with Redemption they when when we're gathered around the throne or even now when we sing about redemption in the blood they don't know what we're talking about they may know oh yeah that happened and we saw that happen there but they don't know what it's like to be redeemed Jesus never died for Angels God never became flesh for Angel's Redemption he came for your Redemption amen he came to redeem his family back to the position they meant to be in right amen that's right so they won't know we we dwell in a position that Angels know nothing about you mean even Gabriel and the archangels and all those incredible yeah they don't know what we are they're just servants they're not part of the family whole totally different category and if Satan was created as the anointed Cher that cth as he says in Ezekiel he's just a servant yeah that's right he knows he knows nothing of the position we in you and I are in now amen that's right Revelations chap 12 and verse 7 now we sorry just before we read this we understand that God made all the Angels before there was anything he made angels to worship him and then Lucifer and his in his heart iniquity was found but before that he preached to the angels and some of them believed his lie and fell with him yeah that's why and those angels those fallen angels are demon Spirits that's right yeah that's right and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was there Place found anymore in heaven right and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuses them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives until the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitant of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time so Satan elevates himself there's war and he's cast down and then now he's come down to the Earth so the battle goes from an Angelic battle down to the realm of human being but there's a people upon the Earth he was defeated in heaven he is cast down to the Earth but there's a people that overcome him by the blood of the lamb and and the word of their testimony and he's defeated here amen I'm in that number I can't sing but not in that blood wash number you in that number Hallelujah there's a people this scripture must become manifested that's right amen and we understand that through Through the Ages it has but it has to come to a final you know it has to come to a finality amen where there is a people a final living generation that overcome him by the blood of lamb and the word of their testimony you say well our testimony is not just what God has done for us but we are to testify or give witness that God's word is true amen so everything that is contrary to his word you got to cast down am mean you got to take God at his word doesn't matter what situation we may be in but is to give testimony that his word is right because if you begin to testify of things that are not his word then Satan come in and have dominion over you you see it's in first I think it's in first or second Kings you know there's the king of Israel and there's the king of Judah or whatever it is one's Ahab and Elijah's prophesied that the dogs will lick this man's blood he's going to die he's been he and he's brought out to this battle and he's got 400 prophets and the he and and they all of One mind and one Accord prophesying go up and take ramoth Gilead the Lord's given it into your hand remember ramoth gillad was a part of his Israel it's God's given ground the enemy had taken the ground and they're all getting excited they were they were having a real time and the head the head Prophet made two horns made a sign and begin to say with these you'll push out the enemy that sounds pretty good but then now Micaiah was there and then I think it's Jehoshaphat I think he was the good King he says don't you have just one more he says there is one more but he you know but he always Propet you know you know prophesies against me I hate him and the other king says don't let the king say so go get him so now we're going to see we're going to see now who has Dominion this is where it comes down to Everyday Life who has Dominion now and then so a guy goes and gets him he says you say what these like these Prophet said them we have Fellowship again this Prophet says I'll only say m says I'll only say have you pronounce his name I'll only say what God puts in my mouth he comes along and he praise God comes upon him and he says now okay now tell us what God told you go up the Lord's given you the land and Ahab says don't you see always prophesies against me he says now I saw heaven and God was saying how can we get Ahab to come and and die because the words of Elijah have to be fulfilled and then a lying Spirit comes out from Hell says I'll get into them they don't know the word basically they don't know what's prophesy of the day and hour in which they live and a lying Spirit came down upon them and they are enthus and they anointed now what was what was their lord just then amen lying Spirit that's right that's why you've got to take your thoughts and everything got to be subject to the word of God Amen they were Israelites they were prophets but they were led the wrong way that's right and so and we know the outcome and the head Prophet was so angry he smacks the other guy in the mouth when did the spirit of God come out of me and go unto you and then the king Ahab says take this man feed him water of affliction and bread of Affliction put him in prison till I come back then that Prophet looked at that King King ABAB says if you ever come back again the Lord has never spoken to me amen cuz he says I see Israel scattered like sheep without a shepherd on the Hills amen and it happened exactly because the word of Elijah had to be fulfilled amen so we have to you got to really think about oh you're I'm enthused about something the world gets enthused have they ever anointed their American Messiah yeah you see on YouTube all the all the church leaders praying for him and things you know before he became president they have they have theyve selected their Messiah and the word's got to be fulfilled amen but what about us there has to be there has to be people that overcome him by the blood of lamb and the word of their testimony amen there has to be and we I trust by God's grace that we are part of that number amen amen because Satan he was cast out of Heaven he was defeated there he has to be defeated here amen and there has to be the Battle Is Now put on human flesh amen that's right amen Jesus gave instructions in the end of Mark 16 go into all the world and preach the gospel and these son shall follow them that believe you cast out Devils speak with you tongues if you drink any deadly thing it shall not harm you you know that was the instructions that was that is the gospel in action so he says go into all the world and Dethrone Satan out of every life that will believe preach it to Every Creature but everyone that believes Dethrone him and that's our standing orders that's what we're ordained to do amen amen just bear with me a bit longer okay you got to recognize I just it's got to punch home an addiction something of the flesh something that is robbing you of your walk with God that is not ordained to be your ruler amen oh but I but I love the Lord and I you know and I'm religious don't don't let him rob you of your walk because you're not ordained to be his slave he is ordained to be under your feet amen amen brother brah says here and unbelief does not hinder God but today we have the privilege of coming beyond the Angels because Jesus never died for angels angels are servants and by the blood of Jesus we are Sons and Daughters says in the angel of God in 48 he says now we unworthy Mortals have been bought to be Sons and Daughters of God to be fellow citizens I get to shouting notice into that realm where even angels can't come you say Angels yes sir we're Sons and Daughters angels are servants that's right servants cannot go to where Sons and Daughters will go they cannot enter into that relationship for their servants and we Sons and Daughters amen who has more power before God what uh what is an angel and Angels a servant is right there his servants what are you his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then yes am you thought about a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side The Sinner that's been saved by grace is more Authority in heaven than the Archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son a son has more Authority than a servant of course we forget what we are that's right amen we forget many times what made us what we are Hallelujah after we become what we are then we forget how we got here that's why it's so important things begin to go Wayward think back on where God has brought you and think back on what he's done for you amen now there's a Scene It says now we read there in in in Revelations 12 that the accuser of the Brethren is cast down so there was a time now where Satan Heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ so there was that time where Adam was in that position but then he fell and Satan took that position and that's why we see all the Carnage around us but then now by the blood of Jesus Christ now there's a dethroning of Satan and the believer comes into his or her true position in Christ where we are we read there in Ephesians he made us he has made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen so our position in Christ of being in Heavenly places is not a feeling oh I feel like I'm in Heavenly places and yes we are but it's talking about your position so when a son now when a when a son or daughter is adopted or placed in the family they are placed in a certain position by the authority of the father that's right he says what they say is as good as me saying it that's right what they do is as good as me doing it all the power I have I give them all the authority to use all the power I have and they become placed in their position position now once that person is in that position I do not believe they can become a slave or I mean a servant under tutors again they stay in that position amen they are plac in the family and they're and their name on the check is as good as the father's name amen and so if that is the case now being in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus is a position that God has placed us in it's not a feeling that's right so if you've been placed in that position you're in that position amen and so if God has made us joint ears with Christ in our walk with him we don't become joint ears and not joint ears we don't become the bride and they're not the bride and the bride they not the bride and the bride and not the bride but sometimes we're walking along and everything's going well we're the bride we're Rapture Ready you know but then they then then we get onto a gravel patch on the road and things begin to go sideways and we think Lord are we ever going to get there amen remember it's a maturing in the walk absolutely but when the spirit of God falls into your life and it's not just a confession but you see his word become manifested in you in every way what's happened now you become Rapture Ready but now he's maturing you that's right as long as life is in there and remember the life in you will never will never come go against the word of God that's right that's right and so Satan now he came in religion in in Ezekiel he's the God of this world so he wants to be worshiped but there has come to a place now where where where he once was standing in heaven and he could go before the father's throne and be an accuser just like in the days of job he went up there before the Throne of God you know Job chapter 1 and so he was the accuser because he stands there and he accuses he he he tells everything you have done and he accuses you to God because God knows God uh Satan knows that God is a god of his word and we're Sinners God has to come to a place where he just wipes it off he knows it that's why he always tried to get Israel to fall because knew if Israel fell then God would have to take them out of the land that's right and so he's there accusing day and night you I'm going to be done soon okay but there has to come a time when the accuser of our Brethren is cast down where he has no access anymore to to accuse the Sons and Daughters of God and and and and you know and and tell it to God Amen now there's a scene which is very interesting where when we go to Revelations chapter 5 and chapter 4 we are taken into John is taken up into the throne room up into heaven and he begins to describe everything that's there he sees the throne he sees the cheram around the throne he sees the 4 and20 Elders he sees the host of Heaven there but there's one one person that is not there amen there is one person that is not allowed to be there anymore there is no devil there that's right there's Satan is not there and it's because at the time of the taking of the book amen at the time of the taking of the book now Satan is cast down the accuser of the Brethren is cast down amen you say what does that mean the taking of the book it's where everything that Adam lost couldn't go into the hands of Satan the title deed to the Earth it couldn't go into a slippery hand so it went back to the original Creator and it waited there for a man to come to lay claims on the book and to restore everything back amen and when John was lifted up he looked around he saw no man was you know there was a call a strong Angel Mighty Angel stood there and said who's worthy to take the book loose the seals thereof and John's looking cuz he knows he's not worthy that's right amen he saw the Angels the Angels were sinless they would have been worthy but they weren't man that's right they're different they're just servants a son has to come oh Hallelujah a Kinsman has to come Amen to redeem the family back from being slaves to back to their position so he looked around he couldn't see he begins to weep because he knows a Kinsman must come it's a law in the word a Kinsman has to come and restore and he can't see the Kinsman anywhere it begins to weep but then he says weep not and you an elder comes don't weep John the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed Hallelujah and he looks he he's advancing from the eternities in he looks he sees a lamb coming Hallelujah he saw the Lord Jesus you advancing out wounded bleeding amen he has prevailed and overcome hallelujah amen hallelujah he's been standing there as a intercessor but now he's but he's always an intercessor remember because he's still our intercessor but he's left he's left that kind of role in that way but he still is an intercessor but now he comes wait maybe I should um explain that when John looked at him he saw a lamb but he was the lion but to John he's his lamb he's a sacrifice and he's not just a dead sacrifice but he is also the priest he's also our intermediary which is a priest's work he's our intercessor so because he's liive forever more he is the sacrifice but he is our intercessor he is our priest he was made as a high priest after the order of bzdc so he but he was in an intercessory role but now he's come to change his role but he still is an intercessor amen I'll put it this way it's like well I just always use Christian as an example when she was born in her was to be a sister but she had no siblings but in is to be a sister in is to be a mother but she can't be a mother she's a little girl in to be an auntie but she has no nieces or nephews to be an auntie but then as time goes on those attributes are being able to be expressed amen because now Sharon was born now she can be a sister yeah that's right amen and then then we get married now in her was to be a wife but she couldn't be a wife as a little girl there's no husband now we get married now she's a wife she's still a sister she's still a daughter but now another part of her life is manifesting amen amen and now we have children now she's a mother in her was to be a mother but she couldn't be a mother there has to come to a process of time now she's a mother just like our lord Jesus in him was to be a sacrifice to be a lamb to be our you know you know to be our healer Our Redeemer Our God everything but certain times when he can manifest those things remember je Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new so in him was to be a person that would in him was to be a lamb but he wasn't a lamb in the Old Testament he gave animal lamb but he was the lamb but in him was to be a God's provided sacrifice but then he came now and his name was changed from Jehovah to Jesus when the angel you shall call his name Jesus is saying Jesus means Jehovah savior Jehovah's salvation so now God made flesh is going to manifest God's salvation to the Earth amen because he's changing what he's doing amen so in him now so he comes out when John turns to look he doesn't see a lion he sees a lamb amen but it's all about what relationship he is to you because a a Lon he means a judge a king he's going to rule the world with a rod of iron but the bride when the bride sees him amen she sees a lamb Hallelujah she sees God's provided sacrifice she sees the high priest she sees her intercessor sees the intermediary she sees Mercy amen hallelujah so now but in the scene Satan's not there and he comes and he takes the book because now he he purchased our Salvation on Calvary but now he's going to enforce what he paid for that's right and what he paid for was Adam's fall and race coming back to their position and he releases The Inheritance because only he's worthy to take it and it's amazing because in one instance remember John is the type of the Bride one man he is a symbol in the book too that's right he's a symbol in the book yeah that's right so John John is a symbol of you remember the Book of Revelation is the bride's book true these things aren't mysterious anymore they be made plain and so now John in one instance he wasn't allowed to even look at the book you read Revelations 4 and 5 but then in Revelations 10 after the book is open and it comes down he's been called to become one with the book to eat the book and then speak out its contents amen hallelujah well what is that contents the contents of the book is everything Adam lost has been restored so that means your dominion over the Earth amen over nature amen and because Jesus has dominion over hell death in the grave and all the works of Satan that's included in it too amen amen because if I if I have true just like you have a everyone who owns property if there's a squatter in the place you don't have full Dominion but but the Le your legal right is you have a legal right to kick that squatter off because it's your ground amen that means you have true Dominion so anything that tries to come into the ground you have the legal right to to call the police or kick them out yourself however you want to do it but that person must leave that's right amen amen so by us being restored back to what Adam was we have the same legal right now to have dominion over Satan when he tries to work the Earth amen hallelujah amen is this all right you you have to see we have dominion Satan is under our feet am amen so at the taking of the book Satan is cast down the accuser of the Brethren is cast down because now everything that Satan could accuse the believer of has been stricking has been been strucken off thank you Lord amen amen and we happen to be living in that day and now Hallelujah now this is Dominion you say well I don't you say well I don't have that kind of authority yes you do yes amen amen the scripture tells us in Corinthians it says we believe therefore we speak amen it says in Romans 10 that faith speaketh on this wise the word is neither even in thy heart and how do you cast down Satan you have to speak the word amen be inspired and speak the word and then Satan has to obey your voice amen he had to obey Jesus's voice he had to obey you know and if the bride and the groom do the same thing then the spirit of God in the bride means the bride has the authority to cast Satan out cast him down to put him in his place amen amen but every believer has that Authority it's not just a five-fold Ministry or the Elders of the church amen a sinner that's just coming and being redeemed has the same Authority amen hallelujah has the same power amen that's why we can stand in our homes and cast Satan out we change the atmosphere wherever we are Hall the enemy tries to creep and we can kick them out Hallelujah we have that Authority it's time to exercise our right yes right hallelujah it's a god-given right amen we have more power than Satan himself amen Satan's been stripped of all power he's just a bluff amen it's time to call Satan's hand in every situation amen hallelujah because you'll come to find out he really is a bluff amen that's right amen he really is a bluff in every situation Hallelujah but it's up to us now are we going use our god-given Authority or we just going to shrink back and let him and let the devil have his day amen amen no I say no let's be militant that's right amen against Satan that's right Hallelujah cuz we have the authority and if the Bride As I said a while ago if the groom had Dominion the bride has the same Dominion amen we have the right we have the power in the name of Jesus amen amen amen I'll just leave it there but you got to remember servants are not the same as Sons and Daughters Angels were made to be servants the devil and his angels are servants they're under you yes amen so if he is trying to deril your life and trying to take Dominion he's out of his place and this is the day and hour where everyone comes into their position amen the bride comes into her position Satan is cast down into his position that's right amen this is the hour it has to happen amen hallelujah there in Revelations 9 it says I saw a star fall from Heaven amen which was Lucifer he had the key to the bonless pit but he fell that's right Hallelujah the devil is falling in this hour but the bride is not falling but she's ascending amen we have some musicians to come otherwise I'll stand here and I'll just repeat myself all day but I want to do it no no you got to I just trust it really means something yes brother oh but I'm sick oh this is happening in my life I have no peace or joy you have to acknowledge you have to come to realization this is Satan's doing and he's he's a servant he's not a son and daughter he has to listen to my word he's out of his place hallelujah amen amen the devil tries to drag family away you got to recognize devil you must go the day has come where the believer is no longer the devil's whooping boy amen hallelujah amen can we just sing that song again uh in jesus' [Music] name Hallelujah this is a time of casting down
