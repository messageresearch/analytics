[40:30] Matthew five and I want to go just a
[40:32] little bit before that you can leave the
[40:34] verse up on the screen there but let's
[40:36] start over here in verse 11 I was just
[40:38] so blessed by by this verse here verse
[40:41] 11 reads like this says blessed are ye
[40:43] Amen we'll take that tonight blessed are
[40:46] ye when men shall revile you and
[40:48] persecute you and shall say all manner
[40:49] of evil against you falsely for my sake
[40:52] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[40:55] is your reward in heaven for so
[40:57] persecuted they the prophets which were
[41:00] before you and I believe we stand in
[41:02] that scripture amen and then it says
[41:04] here as we see on the screen verse 13
[41:06] you are the salt of the earth not you
[41:09] might be Amen it says that you are the
[41:13] salt of the earth for if the salt have
[41:15] lost his savour wherewith shall it be
[41:17] salted it is thenceforth good for
[41:20] nothing but to be cast out and to be
[41:22] trodden under the foot of men and again
[41:24] notice that this statement that the Holy
[41:26] Spirit's making here it says you are the
[41:29] light of the world amen and tonight we
[41:31] just take that by faith right a city
[41:34] that is set on a hill that cannot be hid
[41:35] any man we just want to thank the Lord
[41:37] for the reading of the word tonight you
[41:39] may be seated
[41:40] neither do no men in verse 15 goes on
[41:44] neither do no man do men light a candle
[41:46] and put it under a bushel but on a
[41:48] candlestick Amen like the the
[41:50] candlesticks in the tabernacle right to
[41:52] be lit for a reason
[41:54] to shine and to
[41:55] manifest something amen and it giveth
[41:57] light unto all that are in the house let
[41:59] your light so shine before men that they
[42:02] may see your good works and glorify your
[42:04] father which is in heaven I mean I
[42:06] believe the Lord's trying to say
[42:08] something to us and I believe you know
[42:09] we've come a long ways in the message
[42:12] you know we have we have heard all the
[42:14] sermons preached we've seen all the
[42:16] signs we've seen the miracles my brother
[42:18] and sister but tonight we're sitting
[42:19] here in 20 and 20 in it and and in my
[42:22] mind I want it I want us to go back and
[42:23] say Lord what was your intended purpose
[42:26] and sending us your word what was what
[42:28] was the purpose what was your heart's
[42:30] desire in giving us an open book amen
[42:33] showing us our names in the last book of
[42:34] life and you know these things are great
[42:36] my brother system we can explain
[42:38] histories and we can talk about the
[42:39] doctrines and all these things but there
[42:41] was an underlying purpose in all these
[42:43] things there's a reason why God sent us
[42:46] a prophet in our day there's a reason
[42:48] why he pointed our hearts back to the
[42:49] original word amen because there's to be
[42:52] a salt amen now I'm a simple kind of
[42:56] preacher so I like to find the word and
[42:59] find it there's a power in its
[43:01] simplicity amen
[43:02] I like something that I can take home
[43:04] and apply in my life amen so but I want
[43:06] you to have your spiritual thinking caps
[43:08] on you know we're taking a lot of
[43:09] messages and putting them together like
[43:11] crisis as a mystery of God revealed and
[43:13] these things you know and and but I want
[43:15] you to think of it from this angle
[43:16] tonight what is salt most of us had
[43:19] dinner before coming to the service amen
[43:21] I trust in the end you feel you feel
[43:23] good and you had a nice meal but you
[43:25] know it's it's something if you if you
[43:27] have a nice steak or you have some pasta
[43:29] or whatever you may have eaten tonight
[43:30] and you know it just doesn't have enough
[43:32] salt right you know that that meal it's
[43:36] just not exactly the way it could be
[43:37] right it's not at its full potential
[43:39] right let's say the chef completely
[43:42] forgot to put salt on your meal right
[43:43] you know it's just no good right it's
[43:46] not the same experience right and you
[43:49] know don't you know it's okay right we
[43:52] can just be honest tonight right we're
[43:54] human
[43:54] right we like things to taste good and
[43:56] and you know when we smell it it has a
[43:58] certain smell to it and and the room
[44:00] fills with a certain aroma and you know
[44:02] we start eating on that steak and man
[44:04] it's just you know that chef really
[44:06] knows how to apply the salt and you know
[44:07] it's just
[44:08] perfect right the seasoning and you know
[44:10] it's good right then we enjoy our meal
[44:12] and you know and I believe that's what
[44:14] the Bible is saying here he's saying you
[44:15] are the salt what is what is it Lord
[44:17] telling us tonight my brother and sister
[44:19] you are the salt amen you are the light
[44:23] now think about the things going on in
[44:24] the world there's an assault against the
[44:26] things that we loved and hold dear in
[44:28] our hearts there's an assault against
[44:30] our families amen come on it I hope it's
[44:32] not just in Canada right you know
[44:34] there's an assault against the Word of
[44:36] God there's an assault against our
[44:38] health there's an assault against our
[44:40] marriages amen and then the Bible turns
[44:42] around says but you are the salt of the
[44:44] earth amen you are you are the light of
[44:47] the world if you ever read what the
[44:49] Bible says about Mount Zion who we are
[44:51] right he says we are the joy of the
[44:53] whole world
[44:54] you know and then we message believers
[44:57] you know we walk around and praise the
[44:59] Lord I'm a message believer and you know
[45:01] nobody talked to me and our children are
[45:03] scared to go to high school or public
[45:04] schools you know and we're scared to go
[45:06] to the malls you know because of the
[45:08] influence is out there but we are the
[45:10] salt we are the light have you ever you
[45:13] know walked into a dark room if nobody
[45:16] here has done that right walk into a
[45:18] dark room and turn the light switch on
[45:21] how much power does that darkness have
[45:23] over the light huh is there a wrestling
[45:25] match going on between the light and the
[45:27] darkness know that light flees in the
[45:29] presence of light and that's I don't
[45:32] want us to start recognizing like the
[45:34] Prophet said when the bride sees when
[45:36] she knows who she is a meant that we we
[45:39] hold the pure word we've been restored
[45:41] to the original faith a man with a
[45:44] living God my brother sister is living
[45:46] inside of on me greater is He that is in
[45:48] us than he that is in the world salt you
[45:52] know just maybe give it a little bit of
[45:53] black background here salt is a very
[45:55] important part of our lives okay now we
[45:57] in the modern world we live in you know
[45:59] we take these things for granted so let
[46:01] me just show you a couple of things here
[46:03] but salt is very important you know that
[46:06] you cannot have life on this earth
[46:08] without salt you cannot have life on
[46:12] this planet without salt you know that
[46:15] the annual global production of salt is
[46:18] around two hundred million tonnes
[46:21] every year every year 200 million tons
[46:25] of salt is made you know that people
[46:28] used used it for canning and artificial
[46:31] refrigeration to preserve food for the
[46:33] last hundred or so years salt has been
[46:37] the best-known food preservative I want
[46:39] us to just log these little things back
[46:41] in our minds right salt has been the
[46:43] best-known food preservative just
[46:47] remember that right you are the salt of
[46:49] the earth right salt has been the
[46:51] best-known food preserve preservative
[46:53] especially for meat right and for many
[46:58] thousands of years right it's a
[46:59] preserver of food it's used to keep food
[47:02] from corrupting from going bad right you
[47:06] are the salt right we are what keeps the
[47:09] word from going corrupt amen okay it's
[47:14] also used to season food amen
[47:17] what is what does that mean to season
[47:18] food right is to enhance the flavor to
[47:23] enhance the flavor you are the salt of
[47:25] the earth right we are here to enhance
[47:28] the flavor you know my brother and
[47:30] sister this message that we have is a
[47:32] light to this world we need to start
[47:34] looking at it in the right from the
[47:36] right angle
[47:36] hey man it's not something to be hidden
[47:38] or something to shy away from as we've
[47:40] seen you know people criticize it and
[47:42] come against it don't worry about those
[47:43] things that you know that's all meant to
[47:45] be there that has to be there for us to
[47:47] have the right flavor amen
[47:50] for it to bring forth the right
[47:51] character and the right light all those
[47:53] things have to be you know let the word
[47:55] be fulfilled my brother and sister don't
[47:56] shy away from those things but don't
[47:58] forget right we are the salt what we
[48:01] have amen enhances the flavor amen that
[48:04] can you imagine not having the salt man
[48:08] isn't it amazing you know you know and I
[48:11] said it many times you know I don't know
[48:12] where it would go without this message
[48:14] where else would I go what denomination
[48:16] could I possibly sit in right where that
[48:19] food has been enhanced with that kind of
[48:21] flavor where the stimulation and the
[48:23] dynamics are there and the power of the
[48:26] word can strike a seat in the heart they
[48:28] met and bring something to life
[48:30] [Music]
[48:31] in other words salt is used to influence
[48:34] other things you the Bible is telling us
[48:38] you are the influencer not the enemy
[48:40] amen
[48:42] think about that for a moment so our
[48:44] kids going to school right we going into
[48:47] the workplaces right we don't walk in
[48:49] there and go hope nobody sees that I'm a
[48:50] Christian no we are the influencer and
[48:53] then we have we have Dominion and power
[48:55] we have authority we have the headship
[48:58] of Christ in our lives
[49:00] amen we don't have to back down from
[49:03] anything my brother and sister we have
[49:04] faith Amen that it can overcome any
[49:07] circumstance think about it tonight I
[49:10] want you to go to work tomorrow a
[49:12] different person amen
[49:13] go driving down the street a different
[49:16] person Amen I'm the salt of the earth
[49:17] let me influence somebody today
[49:20] amen let me enhance somebody else's life
[49:23] let me let me encourage somebody today
[49:25] let my light shine Lord amen
[49:29] salt has power power to keep power to
[49:35] maintain you know God says that I will
[49:37] maintain their cause if God maintains
[49:41] something I mean it's it's maintained
[49:43] amen
[49:44] but he said salt is is a power to keep
[49:47] something it's to maintain something
[49:49] it's to preserve yeah amen think about
[49:52] what we are my brother and sister amen
[49:54] you know we're the Bride of Christ right
[49:55] we are the maintain right we are to
[49:57] preserve we are to enhance we've got a
[50:01] job to do you know don't look back to
[50:03] the prophet and Wow look at the Prophet
[50:05] and look at the Prophet and look at the
[50:06] Prophet no he was the wave sheaf Amen he
[50:09] was there to show us what the rest of
[50:11] the harvest was gonna look like amen
[50:13] it has the power to influence oh I love
[50:16] that but now notice salt the only way it
[50:20] really has power over anything is if it
[50:22] comes in contact with it it has to come
[50:27] in contact
[50:28] amen we don't just live a sheltered
[50:30] little life and you know we do our own
[50:31] little things no to have an effect right
[50:34] to be the salt to really have an effect
[50:36] to have an impact right you've got to
[50:37] come in contact with something else you
[50:40] got a have you got you can have meat
[50:42] sitting on the table right
[50:43] and he can have the salt sitting over
[50:45] there and you can talk about the meet
[50:46] write the word and you can talk about
[50:48] the the holy ghost writing talking about
[50:50] the salt and those things in the
[50:51] dynamics you can talk about the
[50:52] mechanics over here but until those two
[50:54] come together they really mean nothing
[50:56] word without power right weird without
[51:00] the demon dynamics right you gotta have
[51:02] both both those things have got to come
[51:04] in contact so they can influence and
[51:06] have an effect upon one another let God
[51:09] have an impact of my life let God let
[51:11] the Holy Ghost salt amen have an
[51:13] influence in my life there's an
[51:18] interesting scripture and it's not on
[51:19] the screen I'll just read it out to you
[51:21] it's in second Kings two and nineteen
[51:23] and we know the who Elisha types but
[51:26] notice this here that the men of the
[51:28] city said unto Elisha behold we pray
[51:30] thee the situation of the city is
[51:33] pleasant as my Lord sayeth but the water
[51:36] is not and the ground is barren okay so
[51:39] there's no life in the water right and
[51:41] the ground is barren right now who do
[51:43] they come to they come to Elisha okay
[51:47] and he said bring me a new crews amen
[51:51] bring me a new crews and put salt
[51:53] therein and they brought it to him and
[51:56] he went forth unto the spring of the
[51:57] waters and cast the salt in their right
[52:00] and said thus saith the Lord I have
[52:03] healed these waters the salt was having
[52:08] an effect on the waters right in a place
[52:12] that was barren where the the water
[52:14] could not bring forth life amen
[52:18] just poured a little bit of salt into
[52:20] the waters and it had an effect amen
[52:22] it had an influence upon the waters thus
[52:24] saith the Lord I have yield these waters
[52:26] they shall not be from hints from thence
[52:28] any more death or barren land so the
[52:31] waters were healed on to this day
[52:34] according to the seiya saying of Elisha
[52:37] think about then can can I have an
[52:40] effect upon my family
[52:42] can I have an effect or an influence
[52:44] upon my own life upon my co-workers
[52:47] lives he's saying you are the salt of
[52:50] the earth now now we're going back to
[52:51] the examples of what salt does amen now
[52:54] salt does the same thing for Elisha how
[52:56] much more
[52:57] should salt do something in our lives
[52:58] and in our families our co-workers our
[53:01] churches huh
[53:03] it has great influences on water salt
[53:06] right on food and on the air but I want
[53:09] you to notice the enemy you know me in
[53:10] those days the Bible days they figured
[53:12] out that if they destroyed an enemy
[53:14] right now notice this there's a use of
[53:17] salt here as they destroyed the enemy
[53:19] and they pushed him off the land right
[53:21] they would leave the lands and come and
[53:24] go back to their own lands but you know
[53:25] the enemy would would come back into
[53:27] their land and then they would grow
[53:29] crops again and carry on so what they
[53:30] started doing is when they destroyed an
[53:32] enemy they poured salt on everything
[53:35] right pour salt on everything and what
[53:38] does that do it destroys the land okay
[53:41] it just it just it makes it so that that
[53:43] land will never bring forth food for the
[53:45] enemy ever again right and that's what
[53:47] we need when the Holy Ghost takes over
[53:49] our lives on brother and sister and
[53:51] drives out the enemy in our life right
[53:52] we need to cover it with a salt amen we
[53:55] are the salt right oh all embodying salt
[53:58] right and if there's not a patch of salt
[54:00] that gets what the enemy can come in
[54:01] riding it can regrow some things that
[54:04] you don't like right then you got to
[54:05] destroy the enemy again it'll become a
[54:07] yearly cycle of driving out the enemy
[54:09] right but if you want to keep the enemy
[54:11] from coming back right from taking over
[54:13] your spots taking over your land right
[54:15] taking over your complexes or habits
[54:17] whatever it is you got to cover it with
[54:19] salt then the enemy has no reason to
[54:22] come back he can't live on your land
[54:24] anymore amen he can't grow anything amen
[54:27] he's lost all the ability to have an
[54:29] influence in your life because of the
[54:31] salt that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[54:35] in our lives huh that enemy has no
[54:38] say-so
[54:39] he has no effect he has no influence
[54:41] upon your life amen why because we are
[54:43] the salt of the earth huh the enemy
[54:46] cannot find ground that he can put his
[54:49] words into remember this Eve right it is
[54:52] made differently right she's the
[54:54] restored Word cannot be tampered with
[55:00] I'll give you a scripture here just so
[55:04] you can see it this evening and
[55:06] Abimelech fought against the city all
[55:08] that day and he took the city and slew
[55:09] the people that was there in
[55:11] and beat down the city and sewed it was
[55:13] salt right destroyed the land so the
[55:15] enemy could not come back and take root
[55:19] again now notice you're also with the
[55:22] offerings in the Old Testament salt was
[55:23] very important
[55:25] Leviticus two and thirteen says in every
[55:28] oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou
[55:30] seasoned with salt
[55:31] how many offerings right every offering
[55:35] had to be presented with salt they
[55:37] needed to be seasoned with something in
[55:39] other words when we come to worship the
[55:41] Lord and we come to give the Lord of our
[55:43] time and we come to church or whatever
[55:45] we want to do and we give a sacrifice to
[55:47] the Lord it has to be seasoned with salt
[55:49] there has to be an influence there there
[55:51] has to be something that you can present
[55:53] to the Lord don't just do it just in the
[55:56] mechanics of it Amen but bring it with
[55:58] some salt some flavor amen hallelujah
[56:02] neither shalt thou suffer the salt of
[56:04] the Covenant of that God to be lacking
[56:07] from thy meat offering with all thy
[56:09] offerings thou shalt offer salt amen
[56:14] hallelujah the meat cannot be offered
[56:18] without the salt salt was cast into the
[56:23] burden offerings amen
[56:24] Ezekiel 43 24 and thou shalt offer them
[56:28] before the Lord and the priest shall
[56:30] cast salt upon them and they shall offer
[56:33] them out for a burnt offering before the
[56:35] Lord even the burnt offerings required
[56:37] salt if something very important about
[56:41] salt amen salt was part of the incense
[56:44] Exodus 30 and 35 and thou shalt make it
[56:48] a perfume a confection after the art of
[56:51] the epochal tempered together pure and
[56:54] holy that tempered together is to say
[56:55] salted the incense or perfume types the
[57:00] prayers of his people regarding this
[57:03] verse here notice here it it means that
[57:05] their prayers they are savory and
[57:08] acceptable to God they are pleasing amen
[57:11] in all sacrifices salt was used and
[57:14] every spiritual sacrifice of ours should
[57:17] be seasoned with the same it is to be
[57:19] provided for those uses in the temple
[57:22] without fail okay now the Lord
[57:25] we need salt for our offerings okay so
[57:28] he provides the salt okay we don't
[57:32] manufacture the salt all right
[57:34] Ezra six and nine and that which they
[57:37] had need of both young bullets and Rams
[57:40] and lambs and for the burnt offerings of
[57:41] the God of heaven wheat salt wine and
[57:44] oil according to the appointment of the
[57:46] priests which were at Jerusalem let it
[57:48] be given them day by day without fail is
[57:52] not what the Lord does for us he he says
[57:55] to his angels write his ministering
[57:57] angels let it be given to them in every
[57:58] Church age and every day at every
[58:00] challenge at every turn Amen every
[58:02] dispensation let there be solved and let
[58:05] them be meat let there be offerings that
[58:06] all these things be provided in their
[58:08] hour of need amen
[58:10] without fail numbers 1819
[58:15] all these heave offerings of the holy
[58:17] things which the children of Israel
[58:19] offer unto the Lord have I given thee
[58:21] and my sons and my daughters with thee
[58:22] by statute for ever it is a covenant of
[58:26] salt God made a covenant of salt with
[58:31] the people I know it sounds funny right
[58:34] but the Lord uses those types and things
[58:36] right so that we can really see what
[58:37] he's trying to say you know there's a
[58:39] covenant of strength right there's all
[58:41] sorts of covenants that the Lord's make
[58:43] that the Lord makes right Sampson had a
[58:45] covenant of strength right with his hair
[58:48] right but notice here he makes a
[58:49] covenant of salt with his people forever
[58:53] before the Lord unto thee right kind of
[58:55] like acts 2:38 this promise this
[58:57] covenant of salt right is unto thee and
[58:59] I children amen this is good for
[59:01] everybody right hallelujah let's get
[59:06] back to you are the salt of the earth
[59:07] right this is what we open up with this
[59:09] evening says that there are two very
[59:12] important roles here pointed out by the
[59:15] scriptures and this is a sermon that
[59:17] Jesus was preaching on the mount right
[59:18] now remember the the one role there is
[59:21] to be the light of the world a light
[59:22] that would be viewed from all over the
[59:24] world it's not hidden but it's seen it's
[59:27] visible in other words it's it's made
[59:30] manifest it's revealed okay this the
[59:33] other role is the salt of the earth okay
[59:36] so we have two roles that we we fulfill
[59:38] salt is that which preserves life as we
[59:41] were saying that which goes out like a
[59:43] river and influences and spreads out
[59:46] okay salt is only useful when it's salty
[59:50] that's not very complicated all right
[59:52] I'm just making the statements here
[59:54] right
[59:55] salt is only useful when it's salty the
[59:57] warning here that the scripture tells us
[59:59] is that if it loses its savor all right
[1:00:03] if it loses its saltiness it becomes
[1:00:05] bland and boring okay
[1:00:08] I've ever been in a message Church and
[1:00:10] it's like man this is really boring I
[1:00:12] would never bring my friend here right
[1:00:14] right or your life you know you go to
[1:00:17] school and you know I can't do anything
[1:00:18] can't have any fun right because I'm a
[1:00:20] message believer right what are you
[1:00:23] telling your friends right what what
[1:00:25] kind of a life is that that's miserable
[1:00:27] right you know I grew up in the message
[1:00:29] I've been around the message I know the
[1:00:31] message you know well I've seen all the
[1:00:33] different things in the message I mean I
[1:00:35] have lived around the message okay I was
[1:00:37] born in it and everything okay
[1:00:39] and I love it I absolutely love this
[1:00:42] walk with the Lord okay
[1:00:43] and I was happy to go to high school and
[1:00:45] tell my friends about the word and the
[1:00:47] things we see in the word you know and I
[1:00:49] wasn't I wasn't weird about it I didn't
[1:00:51] tell everybody and look down on
[1:00:53] everybody I'm a message believer and you
[1:00:55] know you need to come up to our level
[1:00:56] was never like that okay it's like I
[1:00:59] have something special and the Lord has
[1:01:00] done something special for me in my
[1:01:01] heart how can I help you
[1:01:03] right how can I help you and how was
[1:01:05] your life and you know how's your family
[1:01:07] and you start encouraged people around
[1:01:09] you you know we used to have prayer
[1:01:11] meetings at high school okay this is a
[1:01:13] total public high school okay and it was
[1:01:15] there was not a Christian school there
[1:01:17] was no Christian influence of any kind
[1:01:18] but you know we found a group of kids in
[1:01:21] the school that wanted a prayer meeting
[1:01:22] so at lunchtime we went in at prayer
[1:01:24] meetings right and today I found out
[1:01:27] that one of them is a pastor right and
[1:01:30] we're and we have friends you know and
[1:01:31] actually look look at our Lord does
[1:01:35] things okay so now this pastor right
[1:01:36] this friend of mine we were really good
[1:01:38] buddies he's not a pastor of the man
[1:01:40] that left a message okay and now we're
[1:01:43] connected right now it's just amazing
[1:01:46] how God does things right but we are the
[1:01:47] salt right that's what I'm trying to say
[1:01:49] we am
[1:01:50] influence will have an effect upon
[1:01:51] people around us right and it's exciting
[1:01:54] for me it's exciting to see how the Lord
[1:01:56] uses us and to see how we influence
[1:01:58] lives and how we can make somebody
[1:02:00] else's life better right you know that
[1:02:03] there's children out there and a
[1:02:04] complete identity crisis and God's due
[1:02:08] to a school he sends you to a mall he
[1:02:11] sends you to a Sports Complex or
[1:02:14] whatever it might be or a job place he
[1:02:16] sends you there and he sees you as the
[1:02:18] light of the world he sees are dying in
[1:02:20] a lost person or he sees a sick person
[1:02:23] or or or you know a needy person but but
[1:02:26] he sends you right you are God's hands
[1:02:30] you are God's contact point right we had
[1:02:35] a man in our church he was getting sick
[1:02:37] and and anyway he ended up in a hospital
[1:02:39] and Enys and his leg was really bad and
[1:02:42] I went to visit this man and this
[1:02:44] brother and you know his leg which is
[1:02:46] swollen up right and and he was just
[1:02:48] saying you know well I'd you know the
[1:02:50] doctors have no idea what's going on
[1:02:52] with his leg they don't know what
[1:02:54] happened to him you know and but you
[1:02:55] know there he is and they're just
[1:02:56] holding him in the hospital you know the
[1:02:58] Lord knows how to order our footsteps
[1:03:00] right because we are the salt okay now
[1:03:02] he's laying there right and so okay
[1:03:04] we'll just pray for the man and the
[1:03:05] brother and and the life goes on and the
[1:03:07] next day I guess it was about the next
[1:03:09] day or so another man comes into the
[1:03:11] hospital and they put him in the bed
[1:03:13] next to him there and this man is dying

[1:03:25] to him and he and it starts talking to
[1:03:27] him about God and Jesus Christ in these
[1:03:29] things and you know this man starts
[1:03:31] opening up to him right and before you

[1:04:45] my goodness better keep going here let's
[1:04:52] not lose our savor let's not lose the
[1:04:55] saltiness when it does that it becomes
[1:04:57] bland and boring in other words it
[1:04:59] becomes useless and ineffective and
[1:05:02] there's nothing as sad as an ineffective
[1:05:05] Christian you know you get someone
[1:05:08] saying I'm a message believer I'm a
[1:05:10] Christian and they just have the
[1:05:11] nastiest attitude right that's an
[1:05:14] ineffective Christian okay or there's no
[1:05:17] love right everywhere they go and you
[1:05:20] know sometimes you'll know a message
[1:05:21] believe or a Christian right and you
[1:05:23] know I'm just being real open and honest
[1:05:25] I hope that's okay brother standing
[1:05:26] right but you'll know somebody and maybe
[1:05:28] even in the same workplace and you have
[1:05:29] a testimony right that you're trying to
[1:05:31] uphold and everybody says wow you know
[1:05:33] this guy where does he come from right
[1:05:35] he's not like you
[1:05:36] right and why are you guys so different
[1:05:38] right he's a message believer you're a
[1:05:40] message believer you know he brings a
[1:05:41] reproach to what we believe or she right
[1:05:45] let's not let's let's not just say that
[1:05:48] we are Christians let's not just say
[1:05:50] that we're message believers but let's
[1:05:52] have the impact this has a life behind
[1:05:54] that testimony it's one thing to say it
[1:05:58] but it's a whole nother thing to be
[1:05:59] living this message okay like I said
[1:06:02] I've seen a lot in the message I've been
[1:06:04] around for a long time I've grown up in
[1:06:06] this thing but it's a whole different
[1:06:07] story my brother and sister to be living
[1:06:10] this message has been given to us
[1:06:12] it's one thing to quote it and say it
[1:06:14] and and and go into the mysteries and
[1:06:17] all those things but when you see who it
[1:06:19] is
[1:06:19] amen and you've become a part of it and
[1:06:22] you become a partaker of the divine
[1:06:23] nature amen now we're talking right
[1:06:27] hallelujah for salt to lose its savour
[1:06:31] it means that it has been diluted right
[1:06:36] that's a quick way to get salt to lose
[1:06:38] it savers just run water over it for a
[1:06:40] long time
[1:06:41] right and you know I think that's what a
[1:06:44] lot of people are going through is there
[1:06:46] is the message has come under attack
[1:06:48] right and then people get nervous so
[1:06:50] what do they do automatically right they
[1:06:52] say well maybe the dumb denominations
[1:06:54] aren't that bad maybe maybe we should
[1:06:56] love everybody more maybe we should be
[1:06:58] you know more inclusive right maybe we
[1:07:00] should be right because now we're we're
[1:07:03] afraid to offend people we want to you
[1:07:06] know my brother sister we've never we
[1:07:07] must never compromise with the word okay
[1:07:11] now that doesn't mean to seclude people
[1:07:13] right it's not on anybody everybody has
[1:07:19] a right to the life and the love of God
[1:07:21] okay everybody but we should never
[1:07:24] compromise
[1:07:25] don't ever dilute what we old we are
[1:07:28] message believers we have the pure
[1:07:30] unadulterated Word of God that is our
[1:07:32] strength amen that's our long-hair right
[1:07:35] that's our headship that is that is the
[1:07:37] power in our lives is the pure Word of
[1:07:39] God don't ever compromise with a word
[1:07:42] okay but you mingle you can fellowship
[1:07:47] you can do all those things but never
[1:07:49] never compromise with the word as soon
[1:07:53] as you do that my brother sister you
[1:07:54] lose your savor okay hallelujah for it
[1:08:02] to be diluted is to make it weak this is
[1:08:06] the warning that we are in this world
[1:08:08] but we are not of it thus being careful
[1:08:12] not to become contaminated by thus
[1:08:14] losing our effectiveness as being the
[1:08:17] salt of the earth according to the
[1:08:20] scriptures those are the two facts about
[1:08:22] the believer
[1:08:24] of the world we are the salt of the
[1:08:27] world Bible says this here
[1:08:32] Matthew 9:15 salt is good yeah praise
[1:08:36] the Lord but if the salt have lost
[1:08:37] saltness wherewith will ye season it
[1:08:40] have salt in yourself can't say it any
[1:08:44] more clear than the Scriptures amen and
[1:08:46] have peace one with another the Bible
[1:08:48] here requires that we are in possession
[1:08:51] of salt okay within ourselves like the
[1:08:55] five wise virgins right they were in
[1:08:58] possession of the oil okay to be the
[1:09:01] salt of the earth you must have it you
[1:09:05] must have it to be a message Lee it must
[1:09:08] have Christ living on the inside amen
[1:09:11] you can't fake this okay and as we go on
[1:09:15] we're going to see it more and more okay
[1:09:16] I've seen message pastors that have been
[1:09:18] bouncers for 30 years right leave this
[1:09:21] message what did they have right you
[1:09:23] gotta have Christ on the inside that's
[1:09:27] the thing that's gonna count amen you've
[1:09:28] got to be born again in other words to
[1:09:33] be a Christian you must have the Spirit
[1:09:34] of Christ in you you can't fake this
[1:09:37] okay otherwise you just have a religion
[1:09:40] this element is what weight is what will
[1:09:43] influence our lives it's a type of the
[1:09:46] Holy Spirit working on the inside of us
[1:09:48] it's the seasoning power that brings the
[1:09:50] flavor out of our life it is what the
[1:09:54] believer seasons his life was so that
[1:09:56] all that come near him will be
[1:09:57] influenced in turned by his life
[1:10:00] you know the whole token message is
[1:10:02] based around this principle prophet says
[1:10:05] you want to see your family get saved he
[1:10:06] says you just bring him into your home
[1:10:07] and he says and you just create an
[1:10:09] atmosphere right just an atmosphere what
[1:10:12] is that to have a life that is
[1:10:14] influencing upon them huh just living a
[1:10:18] life of love of peace right oh my
[1:10:22] goodness my brother and sister it's
[1:10:24] amazing I love it because you know this
[1:10:26] puts all of us in to the picture huh
[1:10:29] it's not based on the preacher right
[1:10:31] it's not just the Deacons not just the
[1:10:33] trustees or just a song leader any one
[1:10:35] of us have this power
[1:10:37] any one of us is a candidate tonight
[1:10:45] let your speech be always with grace
[1:10:49] seasoned with salt that you may know how
[1:10:52] you ought to answer every man huh that
[1:10:56] is to say as salt makes meat savoury to
[1:10:59] the palate right so grace is the salt
[1:11:02] that makes our lives and our interaction
[1:11:05] with people pleasant and effective let
[1:11:09] your speech always with grace be
[1:11:11] seasoned with salt prophet says isn't a
[1:11:16] message why are people so tossed about
[1:11:17] the veil is dropped
[1:11:18] they don't even hear it they're in
[1:11:20] they're coming to life amen
[1:11:22] yielding buds talk to them a little
[1:11:24] while and you'll see there's an odorous
[1:11:26] shape about them their conversation is
[1:11:28] seasoned with salt not talking about
[1:11:30] their neighbor or try to fuss about
[1:11:32] something being done this way or that
[1:11:35] way but their conversation is of Christ
[1:11:37] and of his glory that's where they lay
[1:11:40] yielding a freshness right yielding a
[1:11:43] freshness think about that yielding
[1:11:48] bringing forth fruit every day there
[1:11:53] live seasoned with a spirit of God
[1:11:55] bringing forth fruits that are pleasing
[1:11:56] unto the Lord says when the Church of
[1:12:00] the Living God gets to a place of get
[1:12:03] out of this little old isms and the
[1:12:05] sensations until it can display the real
[1:12:08] genuine love of God then you'll be the
[1:12:11] salt of the earth that'll create a
[1:12:12] thirst in the heart of the sinner
[1:12:15] that'll make him want to be like you
[1:12:17] right but notice that get out of the
[1:12:19] isms and all those things it's amazing
[1:12:21] that grudges right complexes bad
[1:12:25] feelings right
[1:12:26] having aunt one with another all those
[1:12:28] little separating things right the
[1:12:30] things that make us not get along with
[1:12:32] each other so well right all those
[1:12:34] little things the human things right you
[1:12:36] know that they dilute our of our salt
[1:12:39] they dilute our effectiveness huh praise
[1:12:47] the Lord
[1:12:53] prophet says we got a great product here
[1:12:56] huh
[1:12:57] but we're approaching the public wrong
[1:12:59] with it too much
[1:13:00] making us isolationists see it'll sell
[1:13:05] itself just live it see you are the salt
[1:13:09] of the earth and salt as long as the
[1:13:11] savers in the salt it'll save if it
[1:13:13] makes contact but if it's lost its savor
[1:13:16] no matter how loud we shout down here
[1:13:18] how much we jump up and down there's got
[1:13:20] to be a life out here that backs that up
[1:13:24] huh
[1:13:25] there's got to be a life my brother and
[1:13:27] sister and I think that's so good for us
[1:13:30] as the bride Lord let me be pleasing
[1:13:32] unto you let my life be marinated with
[1:13:35] with your Holy Spirit amen they live
[1:13:37] wherever I go let me have an effect
[1:13:40] don't you want that amen it's nice we go
[1:13:43] to church on Sunday and we go to church
[1:13:45] on Wednesdays and you know we have
[1:13:46] prayer meetings and all these things and
[1:13:48] but there's so much more right there's
[1:13:51] so much more what about Monday and
[1:13:53] Tuesday and and Thursday and Friday
[1:13:55] right all the other days of the week
[1:13:56] where that's where we live most of our
[1:13:58] life amen
[1:14:02] we go to church so that we can be
[1:14:05] strengthened and encouraged right from
[1:14:06] our lamps a little bit more so that when
[1:14:08] we go to our workplaces go to school on
[1:14:10] Monday we can have an effect right we
[1:14:13] don't live from Sunday to Sunday
[1:14:15] maintaining our little like existence oh
[1:14:19] my hope this is all right tonight salt
[1:14:26] can look like salt but if it isn't salty
[1:14:28] it's good for nothing right it's only
[1:14:30] useful upon upon contact right God uses
[1:14:33] our hands our lips we are his
[1:14:35] ambassadors we are as witness to this
[1:14:37] world message identification and you'll
[1:14:41] notice a lot of these quotes tonight's
[1:14:42] are also after the seals okay if
[1:14:45] anybody's curious about that salt saves
[1:14:47] when it contacts and we must be God's
[1:14:50] contact we are his point of contact amen
[1:14:52] so the Prophet said it we're good with
[1:14:54] that amen but as salt is a saver if it
[1:14:58] contacts she says you have a piece of
[1:14:59] meat here and a barrel of salt there
[1:15:01] you've got to get them together the salt
[1:15:03] to the meat or the meat to the salt to
[1:15:05] preserve the meat that's the way it is
[1:15:07] we
[1:15:07] I get the believer with the unbeliever
[1:15:10] that's right you've got to get them into
[1:15:13] the church do you get them into the
[1:15:15] salty bunch of people Amen you know that
[1:15:18] salt the Prophet says here it goes on
[1:15:19] it's not on the slides but he says he
[1:15:21] goes on he says that salt makes a thirst
[1:15:25] doesn't it and if you eat salt you get
[1:15:27] thirsty and God wants his church so
[1:15:30] salty till the whole world will thirst
[1:15:32] to be like them
[1:15:33] just thirsty and thirsty just think oh
[1:15:36] if I could only live the way that woman
[1:15:39] lives in the in the Bible right if she
[1:15:41] ain't the most sweetest peaceful person
[1:15:43] never out of humour never fussy right
[1:15:46] she's always kind trying to do something
[1:15:48] to help somebody else right why she's a
[1:15:51] credit to any man's Church what a
[1:15:53] testimony out there huh fellowship by
[1:15:57] Redemption says the Bible said that you
[1:16:00] are the salt of the earth and this salt
[1:16:01] can only save when it comes in contact
[1:16:04] with a spoiling earth the or the earth
[1:16:06] is spoiling it's rotten and you know
[1:16:08] that and the salt must come in contact
[1:16:10] with the earth and if it'll be gone that
[1:16:13] it's groaning for the manifestation of
[1:16:15] the sons of God hallelujah message hear
[1:16:23] him he says it's time for the church
[1:16:24] today to be manifested and instead of
[1:16:28] that we're drawing little lines like
[1:16:30] this and we have these little campaigns
[1:16:32] and these little doctrines and these
[1:16:35] little denominations that separates us
[1:16:38] how can God ever pour his spirit on such
[1:16:42] as that when he loves the Methodists he
[1:16:44] the same as he loves the Baptist or you
[1:16:47] Pentecostals or all the children brought
[1:16:49] the same by the bought by the same blood
[1:16:51] but we are the ones drawing the lines
[1:16:55] think about that statement tonight we
[1:17:00] look at people a whole lot different
[1:17:01] everybody is a candidate to the full
[1:17:04] open Word of God everybody has a right
[1:17:08] to come into Christ and now if the other
[1:17:15] fellow draws a line you just live right
[1:17:17] along his line right you be the salt
[1:17:21] we'll make him thirsty if you'll be the
[1:17:23] salt you are the salt of the earth and
[1:17:25] salt if it contacts it saves right and
[1:17:27] think we're getting that principle now
[1:17:28] right he says then salt creates a thirst
[1:17:31] and people were thirst when they see you
[1:17:33] living the life that you should live as
[1:17:35] a son and daughter of God so all we have
[1:17:38] to do is be salty right God makes the
[1:17:41] other person thirsty
[1:17:44] the important thing tonight is to have
[1:17:47] the salt live a salty life a life filled
[1:17:50] with the savour of Christ the love of
[1:17:52] God amen so we find that the more we go
[1:17:56] into these things and you'll even see
[1:17:57] this in questions and answers in the
[1:17:59] seals and the Seventh Seal all these
[1:18:01] things you start seeing the Prophet
[1:18:02] really focusing on on the life a hidden
[1:18:04] life with Christ he says a solid sane
[1:18:08] stable Christian right in the middle of
[1:18:11] the road right not over in fanaticism
[1:18:13] and not over here on starchiness right
[1:18:15] in the middle of the road right there
[1:18:20] it's an epistle known and read of all
[1:18:22] men and the message God keeps his words
[1:18:24] the Prophet says it like this jesus said
[1:18:25] you are the salt of the earth but the
[1:18:27] salt can only be a saver as in contact
[1:18:29] so you have to make contact in your life
[1:18:31] is the best thing to make contact with
[1:18:34] anybody your life okay he says I'd
[1:18:39] rather you lift me a sermon then preach
[1:18:42] me one any time the rest of the world
[1:18:47] will the same thing
[1:18:50] prophet says and behold I stand at the
[1:18:52] door and knock if you're the salt of the
[1:18:54] earth then you've got to live such a
[1:18:56] life you where you're a written epistle
[1:18:59] till all men will know what you are no
[1:19:03] matter what you profess to be you know
[1:19:05] they say this right this person is a
[1:19:09] Christian right he says your life speaks
[1:19:11] so loud I can't hear your testimony huh
[1:19:15] what kind of a life doesn't look like
[1:19:18] think about it tonight and you know well
[1:19:21] we're thinking about it might as well
[1:19:22] think about our own lives what does my
[1:19:24] life look like out there that it's so
[1:19:28] loud it doesn't matter that I profess
[1:19:31] what I am they can see from a distance
[1:19:34] this
[1:19:35] is the Bride of Christ this man is a
[1:19:37] believer 1964 the Prophet says I've got
[1:19:43] to live that example says Christianity
[1:19:48] ain't what you say it's what you live
[1:19:51] what you do it's an example amen
[1:19:55] you are the salt of the earth you are
[1:19:58] the salt of the earth hallelujah praise
[1:20:02] the Lord
[1:20:04] prophet says and when we lose our
[1:20:06] influence as a father as a mother as a
[1:20:12] Christian as a businessman as a minister
[1:20:14] when we lose our influence with people
[1:20:17] now we can be very popular in the line
[1:20:19] of the world and go along with the world
[1:20:20] but I mean as we represent Christ right
[1:20:24] when we lose our influence as that how
[1:20:27] can we blend in with a day when God is
[1:20:29] so against this day right now notice he
[1:20:33] though he pulls out a few roles that we
[1:20:35] all have okay that his father's right so
[1:20:38] it's not just about being a Christian
[1:20:40] it's not just being a what we profess
[1:20:42] writers to be a message believer right
[1:20:44] we we have responsibilities as all right
[1:20:47] as husband's right in the Bible and the
[1:20:50] message has been very clear in our
[1:20:52] conduct our order the way we treat one
[1:20:54] another right so he's saying that all
[1:20:56] those little roles right all those
[1:20:57] things right are important in our lives
[1:20:59] don't neglect being a proper daddy in
[1:21:02] your home don't let let being a mother
[1:21:04] to your children right that's all part
[1:21:06] of being a salt of the earth it doesn't
[1:21:08] mean that a mother neglects her duties
[1:21:10] at home and goes out there and starts
[1:21:11] quoting quotes to everybody and you know
[1:21:13] she's some religious fanatic out there
[1:21:15] that's not being the salt the salt is
[1:21:16] being in her role being in her place
[1:21:19] right remember that that woman that was
[1:21:23] praying for a husband to be saved and
[1:21:25] the man was at the bar right and he said
[1:21:27] man you come to my house I'll show you a
[1:21:28] Christian Ryan brings those men home
[1:21:31] right her life saved those men just the
[1:21:34] life on display amen
[1:21:36] what about the bride my brothers Chris
[1:21:39] brother and sister think about it
[1:21:41] tonight you know we go we go through our
[1:21:43] trials we go hardships people make fun
[1:21:45] of us like that husband threw his plate
[1:21:47] on the floor like that
[1:21:48] what kind of an attitude would we have
[1:21:50] how would we react to those kind of
[1:21:52] things
[1:21:52] amen but our attitude just the just the
[1:21:55] attitude she had brought salvation to
[1:21:57] those men and then we say Lord we're
[1:22:00] praying for our families were praying
[1:22:01] for people to come back into the message
[1:22:03] we're praying for people to be saved in
[1:22:05] our church and all these things but
[1:22:07] God's saying but you're the salt of the
[1:22:09] earth I've given you all the power and
[1:22:11] dominion over these things I've made you
[1:22:13] a mother a father I've given you so many
[1:22:15] opportunities where you can live a life
[1:22:17] before these people lord help us hey
[1:22:23] give us strength to live a life to
[1:22:26] recognize what God's called me to be to
[1:22:28] be let me be the right kind of father to
[1:22:32] my children let me be the right kind of
[1:22:34] husband to my wife a meant something
[1:22:36] when that when the world looks at that
[1:22:37] they say wow what is that right and they
[1:22:40] come and ask you you say well you know
[1:22:42] it's not me right it's the lord and
[1:22:44] savior's it's you know it's God who
[1:22:46] lives in me right if it was me you know
[1:22:49] I would not be like this right amen but
[1:22:52] praise the Lord for His grace right by
[1:22:54] His grace I can treat my wife the right
[1:22:56] way by His grace I can run my house the
[1:22:58] right way and you know and then they go
[1:23:00] wow I want the part of that grace hmm
[1:23:08] skip a few things here message the Queen
[1:23:15] of Sheba says we are the salt of the
[1:23:20] earth and if the salt is still got its
[1:23:22] savour in it and contacts it is a saver
[1:23:25] but if the salt has lost its strength if
[1:23:27] our testimonies are so irregular and one
[1:23:30] day we're up and the next day we're down
[1:23:31] and this this way we're believing in the
[1:23:34] next we're not how can a sinner man find
[1:23:37] anything from us huh so how do we combat
[1:23:42] that how do we not do that right prophet
[1:23:47] says he says we must take our stand for
[1:23:50] God you see you must come to a place
[1:23:52] where you just decide Lord I believe you
[1:23:54] right that's the beginning right he says
[1:23:56] if you must believe that he is
[1:23:59] you have to stand for God you have to
[1:24:01] come to a place in your life where you
[1:24:02] say okay I'm

[1:26:44] I was just an electrician just uh just

[1:26:48] ordinary day and I'll never forget it
[1:26:50] you know it's just working and it was it
[1:26:52] was kind of a really stressful job and
[1:26:54] one day I showed up super early I was
[1:26:56] there around 6 o'clock in the morning
[1:26:58] that's super early to you and I'm
[1:27:00] walking up there's a long wooden walkway
[1:27:02] up into a kind of a wooded area at a big
[1:27:05] log home on an Eagle Harbor right it's
[1:27:08] just a gorgeous place but you know I'm
[1:27:09] walking up there and you know I'm just
[1:27:11] just this humble little electrician
[1:27:13] right working for this millionaire right
[1:27:15] and walking up this hill and I've got my
[1:27:18] hand I'll never forget even though the
[1:27:19] smells and the sensations I mean God
[1:27:21] knows how to purse
[1:27:22] analyze it huh and I remember running my
[1:27:24] hands up the grains of that of that
[1:27:25] would the of the hand rail going out and
[1:27:28] all my tools and stuff and you know I'm
[1:27:30] just going out it's just an ordinary day
[1:27:33] huh just an honor day thinking about the
[1:27:36] job and then it was like the next moment
[1:27:39] I felt like somebody was there no just
[1:27:42] somebody was there you didn't speak to
[1:27:43] me in an audible voice or anything but I
[1:27:45] knew that my savior was standing with me
[1:27:48] in that place he was walking with me he
[1:27:50] was letting me know Chris I know about
[1:27:52] your needs I know about your troubles
[1:27:54] and your family in your church all these
[1:27:56] things I'm with you I you've got me on
[1:27:58] your side amen it's my hand in your hand
[1:28:00] I'm with you huh and you'll never forget
[1:28:04] moments like that but you've got to be
[1:28:06] willing you've got to be consecrated you
[1:28:08] gotta say Lord let me be salty Lord
[1:28:10] created me a clean heart Lord show me
[1:28:12] your ways huh we've gotta be willing to
[1:28:15] die to ourselves die to our opinions die
[1:28:18] to all the outside influence it's not
[1:28:20] amazing that every time a question comes
[1:28:22] up we go to Google or Siri or write you
[1:28:25] think they've got the answers to those
[1:28:27] things they don't have a clue and
[1:28:29] there's a thousand voices out there but
[1:28:32] there's only one voice that will bring
[1:28:34] satisfaction to your heart
[1:28:45] Sweeper
[1:28:46] this little brine it's gonna stir up the
[1:28:48] young ones the old ones amen
[1:28:50] it might not be like the first second
[1:28:52] pull but it'll be a word bride huh
[1:28:54] she'll be right in the middle of the
[1:28:56] road he'll understand the word she'll be
[1:28:58] able to discern she'll have the power of
[1:29:00] the word in her mouth amen
[1:29:01] she'll have character I believe that you
[1:29:06] know prophet had a vision about you said
[1:29:08] about those young couples I think it is
[1:29:09] right young people that was sitting
[1:29:11] there in the meeting right and then he
[1:29:13] says the day kind of wore on and they
[1:29:14] started getting a little restless and
[1:29:16] then he said they started leaving
[1:29:17] I mean he's saying don't go right I'm
[1:29:19] getting to the climax right and we're
[1:29:20] getting to the good stuff right but
[1:29:22] there they were hungry so that you know
[1:29:23] he said it's okay right he said it's
[1:29:25] okay you're leaving for food right but
[1:29:28] he says they will be back those young
[1:29:30] people right they'll be back in the
[1:29:32] evening time in the evening shadows
[1:29:34] they'll come back and I believe that's
[1:29:36] where the bride is we're here
[1:29:38] amen we're here my brother and sister
[1:29:40] this is our day mmm the salt of the
[1:29:47] earth huh we are the salt of the earth
[1:29:50] think about that the strength of the
[1:29:56] Holy Spirit should be in every member of
[1:29:58] the church
[1:29:58] what do you mean strength the power of
[1:30:01] the Resurrection the life that Jesus
[1:30:03] gave for the church should be operating
[1:30:05] in every member of the body the strength
[1:30:08] of salt will only save if it contacts
[1:30:10] but it must contact if the church gets
[1:30:12] that burden on their heart to contact
[1:30:14] somebody get somebody say then the
[1:30:16] strengths coming back into the church
[1:30:18] again and into the people there's a
[1:30:22] beautiful quote you know look this up
[1:30:24] sometime
[1:30:25] where the Prophet says that we are his
[1:30:28] speaking about God right
[1:30:30] we are God's earthly strength if we
[1:30:37] underestimate ourselves we really do we
[1:30:40] really live way below our privileges we
[1:30:43] are the earthly strength of God
[1:30:46] hallelujah amen the Lord sees in our
[1:30:52] lives
[1:30:54] as reform 14 now because we have
[1:30:57] maintenance from the king's palace I
[1:30:59] want to leave this here with you this
[1:31:01] evening that maintenance right remember
[1:31:03] salt is a preserver it's what keeps it's
[1:31:06] a it's something that provides for okay
[1:31:09] that maintenance there that word evils
[1:31:11] salt okay we have salt from the king's
[1:31:15] palace it's those words if you go look
[1:31:17] them up right that maintenance is salt
[1:31:19] or like salary not vegetable sorry but
[1:31:24] salary like money okay you will get a
[1:31:26] salary from work right and that's what
[1:31:28] provides for your house that is the
[1:31:30] buying power for your needs the word
[1:31:35] salary comes from an ancient word
[1:31:37] meaning salt money that's what the word
[1:31:41] salary comes from now we're gonna take
[1:31:42] our salaries with a whole different look
[1:31:44] when it's salt money okay it's referring
[1:31:49] to a day when the Roman soldiers
[1:31:51] allowance for the purchase of salt was
[1:31:54] okay so they would give them enough
[1:31:57] money for the salt in their allowance
[1:32:00] okay so it kind of evolved and the word
[1:32:03] became salary someone who earns his pay
[1:32:06] is still referred to as being worthy of
[1:32:08] his salt right don't know if you ever
[1:32:12] had someone say that to you okay but
[1:32:14] he's worthy of his salt we have
[1:32:17] maintenance from the king's palace god
[1:32:21] gives us an allowance right he gives us
[1:32:24] a salary right day-to-day right all
[1:32:28] right praise the Lord
[1:32:29] I'm gonna close with a by John notices
[1:32:35] seen here ought ye not to know that the
[1:32:37] Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over
[1:32:40] Israel to David forever even to him into
[1:32:43] his sons by a covenant of salt so God
[1:32:47] made a covenant with abaya right with
[1:32:49] Judah in the kingdom of Judah right with
[1:32:52] a covenant of salt in other words that
[1:32:54] covenant will never be breaking it's
[1:32:56] permanent it preserves it maintains okay
[1:32:59] it protects it's it enhances right
[1:33:02] there's nothing that anybody can do to
[1:33:05] take that covenant away
[1:33:06] okay God has made a covenant right of
[1:33:10] salt that is in other words he made a
[1:33:12] perpetual covenant never to be made void
[1:33:17] right it's called so because salt
[1:33:21] preserve corruption so God made a
[1:33:24] covenant with a buyer and those men okay
[1:33:26] now goes in another place in the
[1:33:29] scriptures talking about the same thing
[1:33:31] he shall build a house for my name and I
[1:33:33] will establish the throne of his kingdom
[1:33:35] for ever okay he's talking about this
[1:33:37] covenant of salt right that he made
[1:33:40] first kings again says nevertheless for
[1:33:43] David's sake that the Lord his God give
[1:33:45] him a lamp in Jerusalem to set of his
[1:33:48] son after him and established Jerusalem
[1:33:50] now in second chronicles 13 and 5 we see
[1:33:54] the power of this covenant of salt
[1:33:56] coming to affect Abijah the king of
[1:33:59] Judah remember how the kingdoms are
[1:34:02] divided into two there was two tribes
[1:34:04] over here in ten tribes over here right
[1:34:06] two tribes was was Judah and then ten
[1:34:08] tribes was Israel right we know these
[1:34:10] things but notice King the king of Judah
[1:34:13] by juh stands there with these four
[1:34:16] hundred thousand men you can go read
[1:34:18] about this battle in second chronicles
[1:34:19] thirteen five 400,000 men ready for war
[1:34:23] okay now that's a lot of men but Israel
[1:34:26] had twice as many had eight hundred
[1:34:28] thousand
[1:34:32] pretty bad odds okay now who in their
[1:34:35] right mind would take on an enemy that
[1:34:37] is twice the size of yours huh but
[1:34:41] remember the only thing that that
[1:34:42] Abijah had above them was a covenant of
[1:34:45] salt now I'm trying to show you the
[1:34:46] power of that binding covenant that God
[1:34:49] makes with you does it matter if say if
[1:34:54] the enemy showed up with a hundred and
[1:34:55] 1.2 million soldiers did would it matter
[1:34:58] if they showed up with chariots and all
[1:35:00] sorts of weapons and things I mean it
[1:35:02] just doesn't matter these guys have a
[1:35:03] covenant of salt okay that's the that's
[1:35:07] the dividing factor that is that is the
[1:35:09] deciding factor I mean that is what he's
[1:35:11] going to separate these two armies is
[1:35:12] this covenant Yeah right most leaders in
[1:35:18] a bi disposition would think again
[1:35:19] before fighting an army twice its size
[1:35:21] yet he seizes upon the opportunity to
[1:35:24] warn Israel right so Abijah goes to
[1:35:28] Jeroboam right and he and he warns them
[1:35:31] reconsider attacking because of the
[1:35:34] divine covenant I'm under right he
[1:35:37] imagined what Jeroboam was thinking like
[1:35:39] are you nuts we are twice as strong as
[1:35:42] you right we got this field covered with
[1:35:44] army with an army amen that is twice as
[1:35:47] big as yours we are gonna defeat you and
[1:35:49] you're telling us to be careful yeah why
[1:35:52] right well because we have a covenant of
[1:35:54] salt right right where we have a promise
[1:35:57] huh God's given us his word hmm
[1:36:05] reconsider attacking because God has
[1:36:07] given us a divine covenant with Judah
[1:36:10] and it's based upon salt he said should
[1:36:15] you not know right should you not know
[1:36:18] he can go read this in that chapter he
[1:36:21] asked that the Lord God of Israel gave
[1:36:23] the Dominion over to Israel to David
[1:36:25] forever don't you know this that the
[1:36:27] kingdom belongs to us he's given us the
[1:36:29] kingdom forever that he's going to
[1:36:31] establish it forever and you think
[1:36:33] you're gonna bring your army here and
[1:36:35] drive us off this place amen come on we
[1:36:37] thought in a we've got a covenant we're
[1:36:39] God's people right this is what I'm
[1:36:42] saying we don't cower for the devil
[1:36:44] we don't move off the battlefield
[1:36:46] because of the enemy huh we have a
[1:36:49] covenant and our covenant is a covenant
[1:36:51] of salt the promise was not given just
[1:36:58] to David and his kingdom forever but to
[1:37:00] his sons Israel didn't heed the warning
[1:37:03] and it and as a result 500,000 of
[1:37:07] jeroboams men died that day huh that is
[1:37:12] the this is interesting now notice we're
[1:37:14] talking about a covenant of salt I think
[1:37:15] the Lord is trying to tell us something
[1:37:17] that is the largest single-day slaughter
[1:37:20] in history to this day no five hundred
[1:37:26] thousand in one day we we saw in a
[1:37:29] museum today about Gallipoli right I
[1:37:31] mean it is tragic what happened there it
[1:37:33] is it is a mess huh it's like a hundred
[1:37:37] twenty thousand or something but over
[1:37:39] like an eight month period right this is
[1:37:41] five hundred thousand in one day what do
[1:37:44] you think our children do when they go
[1:37:46] to school what do you think your
[1:37:47] brothers do when you're going to work
[1:37:49] huh you're you're to breaking down
[1:37:51] strongholds destroying the enemy left
[1:37:53] right and center the Lord goes before
[1:37:54] you're setting ambushment against the
[1:37:56] enemy huh we are wreaking destruction
[1:37:59] everywhere we go amen
[1:38:01] think about it because of a covenant
[1:38:06] that we have now consider what an army
[1:38:11] of the New Testament would do an army of
[1:38:15] spurs filled believers walking in the
[1:38:17] power of the salt covenant hallelujah
[1:38:23] amen let's stand to our feet tonight
[1:38:32] what I encourage you to start looking at
[1:38:34] who you are don't let the devil tell you
[1:38:38] who you are he is is he can only lie
[1:38:41] okay he said is the father of lies okay
[1:38:45] which means that's where lies come from
[1:38:47] he that's all he can do if he opens his
[1:38:48] mouth is lying okay he says he cannot
[1:38:52] tell you the truth okay
[1:38:53] so anything he says just throw it out
[1:38:56] okay
[1:38:57] but I want you to start considering what
[1:39:00] he says about you what is what does the
[1:39:02] Lord say I am huh that we have not the
[1:39:06] spirit of fear right with all this virus
[1:39:08] stuff and everything going on around
[1:39:09] there a brother/sister we don't have a
[1:39:11] spirit of fear but we have the spirit of
[1:39:14] power and of a sound mind God's given us
[1:39:19] his peace his strength his joy and all
[1:39:22] these things belong to you they belong
[1:39:26] to you he doesn't want you to be
[1:39:27] confused or he doesn't want you to be up
[1:39:30] and down and right he doesn't want you
[1:39:32] to be unhappy you want he wants to
[1:39:34] empower your life he wants to fill you
[1:39:37] with his spirit his nature he wants you
[1:39:39] to see the power of is of what he can do
[1:39:42] in your life huh
[1:39:44] but we've got to be willing we've better
[1:39:46] come before him and say Lord let thy
[1:39:48] will be done I believe in you I believe
[1:39:51] this message I believe that you sent a
[1:39:53] prophet huh I believe all these things
[1:39:56] might I don't have a problem with those
[1:39:57] things I'm not ashamed to say those
[1:39:59] things huh I've seen it any man I've
[1:40:02] seen the power of those things in my
[1:40:03] life you can't you can't explain that
[1:40:06] away from me but you have to come to a
[1:40:08] place where you shut out all the outside
[1:40:10] voice and say Lord it's you I want your
[1:40:13] voice in my heart then you see things
[1:40:16] start to change he'll open things up in
[1:40:18] the message that that nobody has told
[1:40:20] you before trust
[1:40:23] because Mercy's new every morning it's a
[1:40:26] living book my brothers to this Bible it
