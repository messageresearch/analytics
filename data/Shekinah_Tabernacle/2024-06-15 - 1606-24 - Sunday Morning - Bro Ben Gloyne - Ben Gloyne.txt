========================================

[Music] praise the Lord hello welcome to church this morning it's great to be here how are you you you look you look some of you have changed your seats too you're making me very [Music] confused promotion yeah I I I looked over and I when I was at the back and I thought man who's that couple who's that who are those people sitting in my seat and then um in my row I mean and then brother Kubin leaned over to him and he to me and he said looks like Brother Bruce has got a [Laughter] promotion so let each esteem another better than themselves so you can take my seat I'll take the lower seat hey no we as long as we're in in the house of God that's that's what matters you know we at the front or the back it's our heart and our worship towards the Lord that that matters you know we we can sit at the front and get nothing and we can sit at the back and just enter in and praise the Lord you know based on the state of our heart so um I believe we've all got a good heart um towards the Lord this morning you know we were we we went to this um I took the young fellas to this um rugby game last night and um I seen still over the years my interest in rugby went from here when I was a young fell to sort of below zero now that I'm an older fell you know but but young fellas maybe it's still a bit interesting to them but you know I was there were crowds and crowds of people heading there and we were going through the massive Humanity as we were being funnel into the stadium um but you know we I had my tickets on my phone and at certain places like you get to the gate and you can when when you scan the the um phone on the um monitor at the gate then the gate opens you can go in so I had I had the tickets to get in and I could scan one and scan the boys in and then then ite there where I'm sitting and I didn't know where I was sitting or how it was all going to work but I knew if I just sort of follow all the signs there's a seat reserved in that stadium for me somewhere I've got a ticket and I've got a seat in there you know and if someone else was in my seat I could have said H hey this is my seat here I've got the I've got the ticket that's my seat you know and as as that was happening I thought you know we've got a seat in glory I was rejoicing as I was walking thinking I've got and the ticket is the Holy Ghost you know when we've got the down payment there's a seat and Glory that's reserved for me when I crossover I can I scan it the gate opens for me and I go and I find my seat at the table somewhere and you've all got a seat at the table if you've got the ticket of the Holy Ghost you've got a seat at that table amen so that's the that that's the that's the big that's the big seat we want you know these other seats uh we lost our team lost you know sad but you know my team the Lord Jesus we never lose we're on the winning team every every game's a win so let's um let's stand this morning and just commit the service to the Lord and pray that the

to have all the visitors here this morning God bless you God bless you welcome amen great to have you here with us amen who's happy to serve the Lord be a Christian be in the house of the Lord today amen praise God let's go to uh The Book of Ezekiel um Ezekiel uh 37 and verses 11 down to verse 14 and then we're going to uh yeah we're just going to read here amen amen says here uh Ezekiel in a vision has been taken to a valley of dry bones exceedingly dry this earlier part and um this is the house of Israel spiritually speaking he says then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say notice what these bones are saying bones are dried our hope is lost we are cut off from our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God behold oh my people I'll open your Graves and cause you to come out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord that I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I will place you in your own land then shall you know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord amen amen to me that's a tremendously powerful piece of scripture amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning if you ever a need you just want to raise your hand before the Lord he knows all of our Lives everything that's going on every situation we're so thankful we can cast our cars upon him this morning gracious Heavenly Father we are so thankful we can truly sing from experience that Holiness has a name and it's Jesus Redemption has a name and it's Jesus salvation has an name and it's Jesus and that's your name you're the king of kings and Lord of lords and as we bow our heads this morning we just pray dear God may you come father may you have preeminence in every life may you cover us in your blood Lord have your way Lord touch every heart do what only you can do father reach down lord into every life Lord For Your Glory and do what you need to do we love you we thank you we can present ourselves into your presence this morning saying Lord we love you with all our hearts forgive us of our sins our trespasses our iniquities Lord cleanse us of our secret faults father and may you have your way Lord we commit Our Lives into your hands Lord as as we remember those who couldn't be here today may you be their abundant portion as well for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to speak about can these uh can these Dry Bones live yeah now I just want to really focus on you know we have a word of restoration this morning we know that this message fully restores it doesn't patch up we don't not have a religion we have a true relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ God himself no this is not some conforming to some rules no this is God wanted to restore his word in this day he wanted to restore a true spiritual relationship between God and man that's the purpose of this message coming in the end time now notice how Ezekiel when he would when he would be showing these even maybe let's just go to the first part of the I don't have all of Ezekiel 37 here but but but look at the look at this the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in theid of a valley which are full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and low they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest now there come situations in life where where where God asks a question can this be revived can this be restored can life come back into the situation can it be restored back into a Time of joy and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and life in the body once again and but some things that we look at humanly with our eyes and we think how can this how can this live again it's been you look at these bones as as Ezekiel said they were very dry this wasn't even a um a a valley of Flesh uh uh people had just been killed you know it hadn't just been a battle or even Lazarus 4 days in the grave kind of a condition these these these bodies had rotted the bones were dry there was no life there was no moisture there was nothing now this is speaking of a spiritual condition of a people right am mean so so even even some situations or people in life if I can put it this way there's a doubt can creep into our hearts how could they live again how could they be restored again how can how can because remember I mean I don't know if these are real bones or not but just for argument sake they were once upon a time they were alive once upon a time they had voice they had life in their body blood flowing through their veins they had they were walking in the fullness of God the power of God was moving in their lives they were walking in Joy amen but they death came in somehow and the enemy came in somehow and now they're in this kind of condition and you know and and as Ezekiel would see the house of Israel in this condition and God asked him the question can these bones live now God already has the answer but he wants our answer to be his answer amen cuz he already saw them alive as a great Army standing on their feet with the spirit of God living in them once again he saw them in that God saw them in that condition but he needed someone upon the Earth to see the same way he saw he needed a he needed see you look at Ezekiel he was a prophet of God he saw he saw the Throne of God and the four living creatures that cherums around the throne he saw great scenes of you know God's majesty and power but then when God showed him the spiritual state of his people he said I don't know Lord you know he asked can these bones live he says oh Lord God thou knowest so basically saying I don't know God but you know and and so God would God would tell him you know to prophesy to these bones and there would be a restoration process of of the bones coming together so there' be connections be you know senu would come and ligaments and muscle and all these things but even it came to a place where they were just a bunch of bodies on the field but the Breath of Life the Breath of God had to come into them and and and um Ezekiel was instructed prophesy son of man and so brother Bram would say in the restoration of the brid Tre he'd speak about ezekiel's dry bones in the end of that service and he'd say prophesy son of man so a word would be released to bring a restoration so not just a not just an outward looking of a Christian amen not just the right way of dress and different things but there the Holy Ghost the life of God would come into a people that they'd stand up and be a great Army once again so these people were once alive but now they are dead but there would come a restoration and this is what happened we know that you know you on the day of Pentecost God had a living Army upon the Earth you know they were you the church was not in the state of like these dry bones of a separation of Bones and no life and nothing moving just dead on the field but you know so so they were alive but then the enemy came and you know through different processes and finally there was a dark age but God and then even maybe if we could look back in that time we see before Luther and the reformation and even you know different ones before him would' say how could how could God ever restore now I want to parallel this to us right now in 2024 because sometimes we look at situations in life and say how can this come how can God you can restore these things it's been look these bones these bodies have been here too long this person's been in this state too long amen spiritually dried up on a field an open field no life in them and nothing and how could they be restored but God wants to restore amen God wants to raise our faith to believers word for the impossible amen that are people that you know I'll just I just going to jump down to the scripture and we're going to come back here but you know Hallelujah the Bible says a brother offended is harder to be one than a strong City and their contentions are like the bars of a castle now a city a strong City can still be conquered someone with resentment and hurt and pushing against the truth actively fighting against God they can still be won over am the longest Siege in history I Google it was about 23 years in Morocco the Spanish had a fortress there and they are defending against the Moroccans eventually the Moroccans took the city but it was 23 years of a Siege the Moroccans wanted that City back they were determined we wanton our land back we want our city back eventually they won the thing you know and some PE you know sometimes we've got to look at people and say the enemy may have made them a valley of dry bones they may be they may be they may be fully against the word of God but if God has dropped the Revelation in our hearts that they're coming then you will lay us The Siege prise the Lord amen you're determined that you're going to kick that unbelief out that God through you is going to kick that unbelief out if it's a revelation to you amen then you'll be determined not just a an emotion not just a nice idea but when it becomes a revelation amen then then we can be so determined in the trial that God is going to fulfill his promise in his season amen so here are these you know we understand that the Lord Jesus would speak about the Pharisees and say outwardly you may appear righteous but inwardly you're nothing but a bunch of Dead Man's Bones of all uncleanness so they were people walking around talking they were religious they had their worship but yet inwardly there was no life in them they were like this field of dry bones and you know it had become the accepted Norm that the Pharisees and the Sadducees this was the way to work worship God but they were like in this condition but there had to be people that would come out of those tombs come to life again be restored to walk with God because if you look at Israel even you know they came out of um came out of Egypt they were under the pillar of Fire by Night A Cloud by day God moved in power they were they were a living Army but then Traditions came in unbelief came in and they became this valley of dry bones but God said I will restore and this is the same thing in this day that individually we must be restored back to the power of Pentecost again back to the book of Acts again back to where God lives in his church fulfilling his word again it's no longer just conforming to a message and a nice idea and going to church but God comes and lives inside amen because we got to realize me the Pharisees were anointed Jesus cuz he wasn't a Pharisee see and people just want to swap ideas religions like when brother bam he was in India once and and he was invited to a some big Temple and all the major religions of India were there representatives of you know the siks and the James and the Buddhists and the Hindus and Muslims different ones all the major religions and they all got up and they spoke about how great their religion was yeah we're going to clear a flu okay unclogs on pipes we're going to get to that actually so my notes anyway but you see he was he was uh brought to this big Temple or whatever and all these different religion were there of India and they would they would you know get up and they' say how great their religion was but how little Christianity was and one by one they would they would you know say these things and brother Braham got up and he said you know gentlemen you've told me how great your God is and how wonderful your religions are and how little Jesus Christ really is but you know I'm inviting you tomorrow we're having Church you all know we're having a meeting tomorrow I want you to come to this meeting and then so brother Braham was preaching about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ how he is God made flesh and he's the he's the true and living God and then they had a prayer line now we know the gift in brother braham's life is God himself would step into him and he would see visions of people's needs and troubles and different things and there was a prayer line but before the prayer line brother brah had a vision of a man who was a sun worshiper totally Stone Blind by staring at the sun and God would restore his sight there on the platform so he had Revelation this man's going to get a sight back and then so when this man came up and everyone could see he was blind didn't need any discernment you know to see what was his problem his eyes were totally white cuz he was he spent so long humanly trying to please a God and this is the problem people can be a bunch of Dead Man's Bones humanly trying to please God so he was trying to do something how can I get peace with this deity I'm trying to worship and so he'd stare at the sun he went totally blind and now so as this man was standing in front of him brother Bram addressed all the religions there cuz all those men who told him the day before how how Jesus Christ was nothing and their religion so good were there sitting there in the meeting and he said gentlemen there's no wonder you know you know we we can see this man is blind now if your God is the god the creator of heavens and earth who made all things let him come and restore this man yeah and they sat as still as Church mice and brother BR would explain look all you want to do is make this person just say if he's a Buddhist you want to make him a Jane or if he's a Jane you want to make him a Hindu or you know you just want to change his thinking and brother brah said we have the same problem in America all the Baptists want to make all the Pentecostals Baptist and all the Pentecostals want to make everyone Pentecostal and they just want to change their thinking but we're not here to change people's thinking we're here to that God would give them a transforming power of a birth and a change of a life amen and then he prayed for the man and as he was getting halfway through the prayer his eyes were restored he ran out of the place seeing amen because because brother BR said look I can't give him back his sight but Jesus Christ can amen he's here to give him back his sight and the reason reason he could stand there and make that challenge and do that is because he had a revelation that his eyes were coming open amen so if you have a revelation someone's not going to stay dry bones you're going to beseech that castle I mean you're going to with all your prayers and and you know your motivation is going to be lord they're yours where's the entrance into this where's the where's the where's the tunnel where's the what do I need Lord to get in and and and and and restore them sir amen because you see we do not need emotion amen we do not need emotion amen it's yours my brother amen amen we do not need emotion amen David got to a place in his life where where he went through an emotional roller coaster he came back to Zig lag he's he's living in a time of a great a great season where he's about to be made King because Saul had just been killed in battle and then they come back they had escaped having to fight for the Philistines and you know would have been such a relief to be to be to be let go from the battle but then when they come it's amazing when who who's ever seen a house on fire who's ever realized it's not your neighbor's house it's your house different feelings come through your mind you know I remember standing in primary school this is in gisburn one we Beach primary school and I looked out a classroom window and there was a big mass of fire in the direction of my house thankfully it wasn't my house but a whole bunch ofo saying is that our house it could be our house now David and like like brother imp Paul as well he would have gone from maybe it's a neighbor to to know it's definitely me and then they come back to zigg lagac so all this emotions going on you know and then they they wept until they had no more power to weep not just him but all the men with him because they lost all their families the amalekites had come burnt Zig lag and taken all their families away and no doubt so so they had a lot of and it says David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters yeah so he did not need emotion in this moment he did not need a nice feeling he was going to get them back he needed Revelation it had to go from Beyond a high to a revelation because emotions just like these ones before this he would have felt relieved he doesn't have to fight with the Philistines against against Israel but then he sees his house on fire and he sees his family gone he would have gone through a lot of different emot but he did not need an emotion to know it was God was going to give them back he needed a revelation he needed a direct word from the Lord hallelujah because David knew God had given them God had given him his family that's right David knew that his wives were part of him but then but he had to see he encouraged himself in the Lord his God Amen and then David said to Aba the priest ahit your son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod and and ABA brought them hither the EA of David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all amen so it went from an emotion to a revelation and that Revelation overcame all the fear all the worry all the doubt all the trouble cuz it was anchored in his heart he was going to recover all without fail there wasn't a maybe you'll get it maybe you'll get half your family you're going to get them all so he could pursue after his enemy he could pursue with determination with Zeal with Thanksgiving with praise because God had shown him they were coming right and if we could stand in every test in that in that state I mean where the word of God goes from a nice idea to a reality I mean then we can walk with confidence you see God doesn't walk want us to walk wondering if the promise will happen he wants us it to be revealed into our hearts and then we can walk into it no it's already done cuz our God is a god of Revelation not nice ideas not emotion see this world is built on emotion do not Build Your Walk On Emotion build your walk on Revelation of the word amen because your emotions will lie to you feel yes it's here but when God anchors it into your heart amen doesn't matter how you feel it's going to come hallelujah amen that's why we must pray for Revelation more than anything not nice feelings not nice see feelings will come with revelation David's feelings would have changed God just told me we're going to get men be of good cheer you heard the word of the Lord we're going to get our families back God's revealed it to us let's go get them so his emotions would have changed but him pursuing was not based on his his emotions his pursuing was based on Revelation amen amen and we are a people of Revelation amen we are Christians by re God has revealed himself to us that's why we're Christians amen even if you really you're lost God has revealed that to you amen and he's revealed that to you that you can give your life to him and receive his atoning blood amen so we must have we must have amen Revelation in every circumstance amen especially in this day and age of of of every human senses being just being maxed out feelings of you know you Elation and emotion and different highs and lows and you know the you know the human psyche and the human temperament has been so manipulated to control amen that's why things are so captivating it's the reason why things on your media and different things are so addictive because it Taps into I think they call it brain hacking it's actually a term how do we hack people's brains to make money off them and use their time and everything why as the human psyche has being manipulated but God doesn't want to do it that God doesn't work that way God brings Revelation by his word and that's how we walk am mean as I already said this book revelation is the consummation of the scriptures it's even placed exactly right in the cannon of the scriptures at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hears it as blessed it's the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy this is why the devil wants us to add or take away from revelation do you add your own thoughts your own feelings you mix it in with that Revelation and then it becomes added or taken away from it distorts it but if you take God simply at his word and say God reveal me reveal you to me on your word alone amen then that will give you prevailing power amen it is that simple there is nothing as such prevailing power is the revelation of the word amen that that is more prevailing than trying work things out it's more more prevailing than getting a collection of facts and finding a conclusion and and humanly reasoning things out no if we have Revelation amen then there's nothing as prevailing as that amen and if we have Revelation that these Dry Bones will live amen whatever situation you may look at someone say they're very dry how could they ever live how could they I can't even remember the time they once in the prin of God living they can live again amen those bones can live if it's revealed to you they're going to live amen that's why God had to get Ezekiel Amen to look at those bones like he looked at those bones am me he wanted see Ezekiel when he first saw the bones he was looking at this is impossible Hallelujah God says can these bones live he says oh Lord thou knowest so basically he's like I don't know I have no idea Lord humanly it's impossible but with God nothing's impossible amen so that's why we must look at things say God let me look at everything through your eyes not through my eyes through your eyes may I look at everything not through my culture but through your culture oh God through your word Lord Jesus not by my upbringing not by my social standing whatever I think I am may I look at everything through your eyes oh God Amen then if we can look at everything through his eyes amen I believe we'll see the miraculous amen I believe we won't quit am me I believe discouragement will not be a a thing that will rule us I mean the devil will try and discourage see maybe Ezekiel looked discouraged when he saw the bones I I believe very much that you know David was very discouraged when he saw Zig lagac burning but that wasn't the end of the story amen so Hallelujah see we must have a motivation that bones will live again amen not just not just not just flesh coming on to people not just people being justified and Sanctified cleansed up but the Holy Ghost comes and lives in that person amen that's the that's the that is the cural that is actually the cural of every family problem is more of the god the holy ghost moving in lives amen that is the cure all that's the thing that will fix everything everything else is but a Band-Aid amen but but the Lord him coming in flesh dwelling in you changing see God wants to make us a living Army yeah I mean see it starts from the inside out see many times we just want we want others to be made alive what about us amen now I'm oh yeah well let's just jump down to this amen I like pictures why do you eat spreads not just physically if it's too much but what you eat see out of the Abundant of the heart the mouth speaketh right so this this is a this is a um you beer eating honey out of a pot and we know brother Ram tells a story he was hunting once and you know he came back and there was a came back to his tent and there was a couple of Cubs and a mama bear and they basically just trashed the whole thing looking for something to eat and you know you know the mama bear saw him and you know you ran off and called the Cubs one of the Cubs came but the other one just wouldn't move and brother Bram was looking uh looking at this Cub and was very aware of where the mother was and didn't want to get between them and you know all all he saw was the back of the cub and this Cub had his actually had his hand in his molasses jar and was putting his hand in and licking in he all covered and all covered and you know molasses and sticky and all these things and and the mama bear finally I think either called to the cup went and grabbed it and took them off into the bushes and then then the mama and the other Cub started licking on the one that was covered in molasses I mean so what was on the Cub spread to the family I mean what the Cub was eating spread to the family right so if you're eating doubt and discouragement and just tension and anxiety and social media and ideas that's going to spread that negative atmosphere is going to spread to the family it's not going to be a sticky good old molasses am mean joy joy joy kind of meal time no but if you feed on the word of God mean if you feed on his goodness mean it will spread it will have an effect am mean you can't help it if you just see if you're eating on the right thing saying Lord I'm not just eating for myself but Lord I'm believing in faith this is going to spread to my family it's going to change the atmosphere of my life not just my own thought pattern and what's going on in here but it's going to spread through the whole house Hallelujah so I say the more we eat the stickier we'll get Hallelujah and you know like a yeah it's amazing like a toddler you know you say don't touch the walls and they just kind of it's amazing how efficient they are they'll touch every surface they can yeah it's amazing man they're they're efficient and talk about productivity there there there through the roof when it comes to making mess what if we were like that with God we're all covered in his goodness hallelujah we're just kind of every every everything we come in contact with we're kind of leaving a trace there amen I think we should be that way oh but the bones are too dry C no never look at your situation that is too hard for the Lord amen never look at that see we got to look to the end of the way now let's just go back to this here now think of some night when life is finished Jesus finally comes and we go to meet him in the air and that great table is set 100,000 miles long and across there the old Veterans of the field sitting there looking across the table to each other see there my brother my sister sitting there we're just are bound to shed a little tears once in a while when I reach across a table and take one of them by the hand the tears of joy rolling down our cheeks and then the king and his Beauty will come out and walk down the table and wipe the tears away from our eyes let that be our motives and having meetings and gathering together and talking about him hallelujah oh that's just for church no that should be everyday life what is your motive when you talk to someone what is your motive when you speak to your family it should be I'm going to take you by the hand on the other side of the wedding supper table one day I mean when life is done and we're we're gathered on the other side I'm looking to you there I'm not looking to your situation here I'm not looking at Dry Bones here I'm looking to you fully formed over there amen now I'm not just saying well yes over there it'll happen no the Miracle's got to happen this side I mean it's got to come a miracle here for that to happen here but it should be our motivation should be you know this is this is our motive for our meetings and gather gathering together and talking about him the Lord that the Molasses would spread that they' get sticky too right amen let that be what uh be what we think of him to meet him that night look friends don't look at things right here look at the end if I had to look at things right here in front of me I'd be a discouraged person but I never look here I watch the end now if a prophet could say that if he's looking here he gets discouraged but he's looking to the end how much more you and I because let's be honest we can look at here and now and be very discouraged we can be troubled we can be worried we can be anxious by what we see here but if we look to the end and say Lord give me a revelation of the end give me a revelation of who's going to be there in the end that my family's going to be there in the end I mean then you won't look at the here and now but revelation will say you may see this with your eyes but the eyes of Faith see there amen and revelation will override what you see here and now you say well you don't know the situation I'm going through Ezekiel Saw a valley of dry bones right he saw a valley of dry bones Lazarus was four days dead in the grave don't be cynical about trouble don't be cynical well God's not going to do it our how no see these bones were said our hope is lost our hope is lost I say our hope is not lost hope is expectation with pleasure the Bible says you know no Our Hope see what was their hope their hope would be that they'd be living in Israel as a redeemed people but because they fell into the state then the bones are actually saying to Ezekiel basically no our hope is lost we we are cut off from our parts we've been separated from fellowship we're been isolated and all these things we can't you know we can never overcome these things that's what bones say dry bones but hear ye the word of the Lord amen don't don't have that kind of a testimony no matter what you're going through say no God can restore prise the Lord amen so our hope is not lost see Lazarus was 4 days dead in the grave but you see Jesus was there but he told Mary and Martha roll the stone away and Mary or Martha even paused and said but Lord he stinketh it's been he's been four days in the grave but they had to they had to put their faith into action right they had to put their faith into action so they had an option they could either sit there mourning and crying in the house or they could go to the master that they did but just getting to the master wasn't the end of the story right he they they took him because because Jesus asked them where have you laid him so they are taking Jesus to their problem right they're not leaving him out in the field somewhere they they're bringing him to where the problem is right but then Jesus says now you roll away the stone so now don't just sit there but put your faith into action I mean believeing because remember they pushed the stone away but then they had to believe the resurrection and the life was going to call him forth right they did it in faith but they're completely depending on his voice Hallelujah speaking to Lazarus and him coming back from the grave amen and this is this is how we must we must look at every circumstance amen that sure we do it in faith but we must rely on his word bring it to pass amen hallelujah amen you see the Bible I mean brother Braham says that you know we're having a h life crisis it seems like home life is running out into shallow water and to me this is like ezekiel's dry bones is all separation you know the devil hates this is not rocket science or or anything flashbang amazing but the devil hates families he hates relationships he hates them he hates marriage he hates real parent children relationships he hates a family unit working because a family unit working is a is a is is a symbol of God and his family so it's just reflecting a true family is reflecting what God is with his family in heaven right so God loves family the devil hates family so of course he's going to try and bring us into a home life crisis where there's separation there's no Unity right and maybe maybe we have that going on it doesn't mean it has to stay that way you know oh it used to we used to do this B we used to pray we used to have these family altars we used to but now we got too busy rebuild the altar amen restore God wants to restore these things just because you lose something it doesn't mean it's gone forever it just means you own it twice right you had it once you get it l then you get it back now it's twice yours amen now it's your now it means even more to you I believe when David got his wives and his children back they would have meant more to him than they did before that he loved them he cared for them but when they were lost and then God restored them by his grace he could have said you're twice mine now Hallelujah so God can restore anything don't don't say no we're dried up our hope is gone it's been too long no nothing is hopeless nothing is helpless amen you see but you see someone's got to put faith into action amen you say but I've tried that say Lord reveal it to me make me perseverant amen make me perseverant Lord you're going to get resistance amen let's be honest of course you're going to get resistance cuz the devil don't want the pillar of fire moving in your house he doesn't want the angels of the Lord visiting your house no he wants you to be watered off and trouble in your mind and just just a prisoner but God doesn't want you that way amen that's why I say hear ye the word of the Lord amen these Dry Bones can live praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord now you see Elijah on Mount carel would restore or rebuild the altar of the Lord which had fallen down the scripture says if I have it here I think Elijah say he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name now the stones he built now the altars we we build he say how long was that altar left uh unattended the word doesn't say and let's be fair I mean I mean let's just say don't worry about the length of time as as as the Lord would say in the Book of Joel I will restore all the years that the pal worm the Locust the caterpillar the can worm ha eaten says I'm going to restore all those years some maybe maybe someone who heard the prophecy of Joel said it's been it's been decades that those years it's decades God's got to repay he'll repay it he'll rebuild it he'll restore it right so what stones are we using for our altar because remember you've got to put your sacrifice on something Elijah took specific stones and he rebuilt the altar of the Lord see what are we what are we worshiping upon fear worry uncertainty or the revelation of the word of God what what altar are you building is it frustration is it anxiety don't don't put your sacrifice on those kind of stones amen that's right but the stones should be stones of testimony amen see see family alar or or Walking with God it's not a going through the motions kind of a thing it's not a I remember having to go to Anglican Chapel three times a week at boarding school where you stand up and you repeat something you sit down you pray this you just go through the motions of a religious service no but but but worship of God is not just going through the motions it's got to be heartfelt it's got to be it's got to be in Your Heart Lord I Want To Worship You Lord I want to serve you so what are the stones you're placing your sacrifice on are they stones of testimony Hallelujah you ever think about where God found you I know I probably say this every Sunday but but keep your testimony alive amen keep it fresh in your heart don't let it become moldy and stagnant in the corner keep your testimony fresh keep it alive keep it vibrant may be so impactful to you some people say man that testimony is a blessing to me but it should be a greater blessing to you because you're in it amen God found you God called you amen so it should be our worship should be based on stones of testimony amen that God has called me even just a call of God is a supernatural work I mean you could praise God all the way into the Rapture because God called you Enoch walked with God how would that would have start God would have said Enoch won't you walk with me Hallelujah where you going today honey God called me for a walk Glory hallelujah amen praise the Lord God saved me his blood is more than enough Hallelujah that takes all the worry and saying see to to realize or to have that Revelation that his blood is more than enough amen that takes all the negative confession out it takes all the our hope is God no my hope is restored because his blood is more than enough amen as the Philippi and jila was told remember the Lord the Lord revealed himself to the Philippi and Jailer he asked Paul and Silas what must I do to be saved and of course the the the Lord revealed and said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved am me because as soon as salvation comes into you you care for those who are around you amen so believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved yeah amen Deliverance Stones healing stones that the Lord Jesus Christ he is the Lord God Almighty that's a good Stone to build worship on Amen see he rebuilt the altar he put the sacrifice on according to the word of the Lord by Revelation see the Revelation he received in his heart prevailed over everything that prophets of Baal would do the intimidation the noise the worship whatever they're going through it didn't move Elijah a bit cuz he had reev before he went up the mountain amen and we know the rest of the story The Fire fell Hallelujah the fire fell and I say this is a very pyromaniac kind of a religion we have we love fire around here hallelujah if you're a fire bug you spiritually now you've come to to to the right place amen because we need the fire of God Amen we need his fire to move amen because when as fire moves people are restored amen healing comes revelation comes Deliverance comes amen but he doesn't want us just to come to church and experience the fire he wants you to be on fire amen that when you go into your house you're like that bear cub covered in molasses amen it doesn't matter the reaction you get you're still licking you're still enjoying the goodness of God am mean that the goodness of God is far greater than the resistance you get you got to realize if you get resistance you got to realize oh a Siege is on a Siege is on and I'm the attacker I'm not the defender right a Siege is on and what's going to happen that Siege is going to be a victory on God's side amen you got to keep that in your mind keep that in your heart Lord you're on the offensive when you see the devil wearing his head that's cuz God is on the offensive yes sir Hallelujah don't let it turn around make you think oh yeah I'm on the defensive no God's made a move now the devil's responding amen a castle is besieged now the now the Defenders are going to respond but the main thing is we're not stuck in the walls hiding no we're saying Lord this one's yours amen hallelujah amen rebuild the altar praise the Lord because we must realize brother B asked this question do you believe with all your heart the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always he's always there where his word is the Angel of the Lord the same one that led Israel out of Egypt into the promised land the same one that visited the prophets down through the Old Testament into the New Testament because Jehovah of the Old Testament the angel of Lord is Jesus Christ of the new we know that right but he accompanies his word always am me so if his word is in your heart he's going to accompany you amen if his word has been hid in your heart not opinions not the doctrines of man not religion but the word of the Lord God is put in here by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then the angel of the Lord will accompany you amen and the Lord says in his word that the angel of the Lord en encamps about those who fear Him and delivers them all amen so you got to realize that you're not alone you're not a dry bone helpless in the field saying how can I live no you're a living bone you're a live more than a bone you're a living person amen you've been restored so now the angel of the Lord accompanies you wherever you go amen sure you'll find trouble but trouble's not in you you got to realize trouble doesn't belong to you peace Belongs to You amen the joy of the Lord as Nehemiah would tell the children of Israel don't be don't be discouraged don't be sorry the joy of the Lord is your strength hallelujah hallelujah why is the joy of the Lord my strength because he's revealed to me the end he's revealed to me this person's coming in he's revealed to me that my children are coming home amen that's why the joy of the Lord is my strength because the the more I rejoice in the Revelation he's given me the stronger I become Abraham rejoiced in the Revelation given to him it was revealed to him Isaac's coming that's it amen he grew stronger in faith cu the Revelation became greater than his five senses what he heard what he saw what he felt it was greater than the the than the confession of Sarah amen and he had a revelation that Isaac's coming through her not through someone else through her so he kept the spiritual atmosphere around him brother Bram said amen even on the plains of memory Dusty hot not like the well watered Plains of Sodom all these things Sarah was a bit fussy he yeah you know brother r with dramatized but Abraham had a revelation my spouse needs a visitation that was that was his Revelation so every morning maybe got up and said Lord may my life match that Revelation that how I treat her how I treat my servants my conduct the atmosphere that I carry Lord I Surrender myself to that Revelation that you can fulfill it amen what cuz his eyes were at the end his eyes weren't in the circumstances that he was living in hallelujah amen and what did that do that that Revelation prevailed over the deadness of his body prevailed over the deadness of her womb prevailed over her unbelief amen because she had to come to a place where she judged the Lord faithful who had promised what what happened her heart turned from unbelief to Faith right and and how did that happen well the Lord came down in Genesis 18 had a you know visited Abraham in a body of Flesh with two angels in flesh as well and and Abraham was being spoken to by the Lord the Lord said to him according to time of life you're going to have the promised son we know time of life is a woman's thing not a man's thing that was not Abra Abraham's visitation that was Sarah's visitation right but Abraham because he loved the Lord and God had revealed it to him he just focused on that Revelation is this okay am me because God wants us to reveal he wants to reveal his word to us that we're not walking or or treating others conducting Our Lives by what we see taste feel smell hear imagine all those things but we're conducting our life by the revelation of the word amen amen praise the Lord now God now the most important thing is don't respond in kind Sarah became fussing upset living on the plains of memory brother BR would dramatized while miss lot has got all the nice Caravans went down to Sodom and all these clothes and all these nice things and you know why are we living here and all these things and you know but Abraham was there because of Revelation it wasn't a human reasoning that he lik the desert that he was there no it was because of Revelation but did not respond in kind right you should never fight back as it's given to you because that's just the devil dragging you down onto his ground and you'll never win carnally you never spiritual battles are never won carnally they're never won in arguments they're never won in fussing they're never won in fighting they're never won trying to prove your point they're never won that way they're won spiritually am mean cuz the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're not human understanding they're not human wisdom they they're not human arguments they're not just m you know manipulating emotions that's not how our Warfare is won but it's mighty through God our weapons to the pulling down of strongholds so never respond in kind it's never tit fortat okay you should never be that way as as um because remember you got a revelation I trust you have they're coming home okay so don't respond how they're treating you amen 1 Peter 3:9 not rendering evil for evil or ring for riling but contr wise blessing knowing that ye are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing amen so you shouldn't render evil for evil just like brother Braham gave the testimony and and and I think it's Tommy Osborne different ones were in that meeting they in Oregon there and you know brother br's preaching about faith as a substance and then a big demon-possessed man came up on the platform and he was youo swearing at brother BR saying I'm going to tear you limb from Limb and the police will there different things but brother said no leave him alone this is a spiritual Affair and the man came up on the platform now remember brother Brown was a trained boxer before he met the Lord so he knew how to use these right but there's on the platform this man is way taller than you know you know way bigger and this man spits in his face and curse them all these different things the devil's trying to get the prophet to respond in kind right but he realizes he realizes that that it's not him being challenged it's the spirit of the Lord being challenged amen right it's not his Humanity being challenged and his reput no it's God being challenged so if God's being challenged let God answer the challenge right and so so so this man said to brother BR I'm going to tear you li from limb and then and you know and then and then and then the prophet said no you're going to fall at my because you've challenged the spirit of the Living God you're going to fall at my feet and the man said I'll show whose Feet's going to fall on who and he went to try and punch him he just spun around and and and fell right at brother Ram's feet why because he didn't respond in kind let us not respond in kind right let us respond spiritually amen amen because knowing that ye are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing what is that blessing salvation's come to my house Deliverance has come to my house eternal life has been imparted isn't that the blessing you want isn't that the thing you want to see amen so don't render evil for evil or railing for railing but contr blessing knowing that ye are there unto called and that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his evil uh his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no G amen let him rescue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensure it amen right I think Lord help us amen this is how we should be why because we're looking to the end we're not looking at the situation we're in amen we're looking Beyond with eyes of Faith amen a soft answer turneth away wrath but G previous words stir up anger see what does a what does a Spirit want to do it wants to jump on you and then it just wants to fight cause you to fight right jumps one to another yeah that's what it wants to do in a home bring in Strife this this trouble comes then that Spirit jumps on this person because of how they react because remember the devil wants emotions to rise in order to open a door that he can enter in right you look at it this is why music and stuff is so popular you know your entertainment these days because it's such an emotional thing that causes people to subconsciously let their guard down that that Spirit can get into them right and that's the same thing with fighting same thing with trouble and strife that that that Spirit wants to jump on the other person and it will affect people differently but Can Be The Same Spirit right that's right so a soft never let never let your emotions overrule you say God help me keep my emotions in check lord it's not them doing this Lord It's pain it's it's something but whatever it is we're going to take it Lord you're going to take this Lord You're Going to overcome this thing Lord Jesus I can't do it I've tried who's tried let's be honest we've all tried but we failed right because we tried right but when you let God do it through you it's a totally different thing amen when you allow the Lord to do it amen hallelujah but you see God is more than able to do it amen David knew that Goliath was going down by Revelation they were there 40 days and 40 days stuck in that Valley because of Goliath and a boast of one giant one giant they stuck and they were stuck in their own inheritance it was in Judah that that that that the Philistines and and Israel were camped there and Goliath would come out for 40 days saying bring me a man to fight they were stuck in their own inheritance they weren't on the Devil's Ground they were on their own ground but they were stuck in this in this what what do you qu marrow or whatever you call it just a stalemate but then one one young man had a revelation and it was the Revelation that broke broke the spell broke that Toe Hold right it broke the whole thing see if you're if you're in a stalemate you just see things don't change you got to say Lord I need Revelation amen I need Revelation Lord because we're not meant to be standing still especially in our own inheritance there should not be a devil coming at you all the time about a promise saying this is not yours and if it's really yours deal with this and do this and no no the promise is yours but if you're stuck you say God give me a revelation how to down this thing he will show it to if you really want to know see people can get used to living in trenches they can complain about trenchfoot and different kind of things but you can get people adjust to many different scenarios of living right but we should never get just accustomed to living there in trenches just trying to you know no the land is ours the word is ours right hallelujah amen so David had a revelation see see the rest of the soldiers brother say believed it could be done but it's just a mental belief but David it was revealed to him your slingshot those stones one of them's going in his head and you're going to use his sword to cut his head off it was revealed to David before he got to the battle Lord right so why he knowed what he believed he had that little old slingshot wrapped around his fingers like this and away he went to meet Goliath around and around and around well he said I had five stones e s u s what was in five fingers f a i t h Faith wrapped up in Jesus amen uh there he went brother I'm telling you it sent the rock to The Killing place and down went Goliath you know what happened then the Israelites took courage and away they went they cut Philistines Plum to the walls it just takes one person just takes one person that's got enough courage to step out and say it's right God said so brother uh uh brother yeld down to Goliath and your whole family will go to cut and Philistines the first thing you know I mean when you really take instead of just taking doubts and situations and and and reasoning no you take God at his word god you want to come visit me in my house Lord you said that your angel comes and visits people reveal that to me Lord Lord get me in condition for a visitation that that my family can have a visitation amen let's Lord change my heart that there's nothing everything becomes unclogged amen that all the worries and anxiety leave that God that you get my my heart in condition we can't get our hearts in Condition it's not us doing a fstep plan you know put on this kind of worship music and sit here and have your favorite mug and your favorite View and the great coffee no it's just Lord change as I'm going through my day Lord Lord Change My Heart Lord speak to me in the car speak to me shopping speak to me at work Lord speak to me where I'm here Lord Lord talk to me Lord I love you Lord begin to sing praises to Him worship Him according to who he is yeah he's not AR boy he's the Lord God Almighty right he's the king of kings the Lord of lords amen and then what will that do that will cause a courage and where does that courage come from Revelation amen amen then you'll see the family rally I believe this this is just me I believe there can be a change right by rev Revelation drops in one person's heart hallelujah amen it's like we were um we were listening to Brother John Andy this is in lockdown this is in Co times you with you FBF and you know he said he said the angel of the Lord still visits houses remember that angel and I thought Lord come visit my house something in me said yes absolutely that happens absolutely the presence of God Comes Down Changes the whole whole atmosphere touches everyone in the house absolutely God does that and then we were in prayer during that time God came down Hallelujah everyone knew God came down what the angel Lord visited our house spoke to spoke to the girls saying I am calling you I know what you're thinking about as you lay on your bed at night I am calling you give your life to me and I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost that's what they are thinking about right but it's a visitation of the Angel you say oh God can't do that in my house yes he can yes he can if he can visit Paul in a jail and give him most of the New Testament he can visit you and your first world problems am mean he can visit you in your trouble amen so never ever think no I'm not that I'm not that spiritual no actually all spiritual people that's right that's I'm not super spiritual actually we're all super spiritual why because God has called us God has God has called you that you walk with him he doesn't meet you one time and say there you go off you go now I'll see you at the end and then he gets a car and goes to the finish line and waits for you at the end no he's with you the entire time right he can visit he still visits people's houses you know in the New Testament there's new there's more and Angelic visitations than there are in Old in the short span that it's recorded there's more Angelic visitations there than there are such a great frequency of them are they still Angels they're not just sitting up in heaven saying well well the Millennium is going to be neat Lord can I finally go no they are still visiting the Earth amen the blood of Jesus Christ puts us back on speaking terms with God Amen that there's nothing between our soul and our savior so God wants us to he wants us to invite him into our lives yeah to be under expectation that God will come down in the house and touch I mean Christine could stand up and give heaps of testimonies of when they were young 20 years old young person her and Melanie and everyone's praying and her brothers would be they' have prayer meetings in their room God come down and mighty ways and her brothers would be sleeping on the outside of the door just to be near that presence and they knew well the next morning they get up and say God came down didn't he last night didn't they say things like that they all knew when God visited the house he still does it we don't have to move to Tang to enjoy those things no where his people are he is amen you say well life has changed now things are more busy busyness doesn't no never ever put a limiting factor on when God can visit you amen Daniel Daniel had a very high pressure role in in in Babylon he was he was the president of the presidents and under the king all these things high pressure but yet God still visited him yeah amen Paul was chained to a Roman soldier for a long time that's right he got this amen well I'm not a church age messenger you're the bride of Christ sry amen you're the bride of Christ God can still come and talk to you just like he talk to the Apostle Paul he can reveal his word to you like he did him amen amen so we cannot say that there's no my situation is is outside the ability of God reaching down he can reach down further than you can look cup amen like the Apostle Paul would I mean sorry Ezekiel looked at those bones and said no this is way too far down and God said no no no no no I'll show you I'll show you amen the Lord praise the Lord Brother R says I believe that all the lines are getting unclogged uh you know clogged up with all kinds of doctrines theologies and all kinds of stuff unbelief it's been handed down from generation to generation amen he says I believe the lines are getting unclocked amen amen he says your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit you have a little conscience and little feelings and little Sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just a little Sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it so that's why when when you read the word when you hear a testimony hear preaching whatever it is or hear a song I wish we had the lyrics of the song that you sung Stephanie it's powerful amen you'll either accept those words or in your mind will say no it's too hard or no it can't happen for me I would get that and just throw that away and say God you can do all things for me if you're going to change this body and take me into Glory you can do everything else less than that amen you can do remember because because it'll be the greatest Divine Healing will be these bodies being transformed and not just to be made young again and get old but to be transformed he's going to change these atoms right that's the greatest thing of Divine Healing that's going to sweep the world is going to be the change in the body now if he has already given us the faith for that he can do everything else underneath it amen there is nothing too hard for the Lord I'm not talking things up this is just how it is oh yeah I believe it amen see you see your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends God let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the doors or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind Clos itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come and it blows out it blows the rest of the stuff out amen so your reason can be clogged up with and your memories because of disappointments and heartaches of the past and your conscious all these things but when you lay those things aside and say God you said so amen the spirit of the word comes and it'll blow that stuff out amen every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that that's true hallelujah amen so we maybe we're just going to finish right there with that but can these bones live can your situation be restored absolutely amen can it be back to better than what it was absolutely God said I will restore all the years that the Locust pal will can can all the caterpillar have eaten I will restore all of them amen then what do I do just get sticky feed on the word of God and enjoy it and say Lord what I'm reading what I'm listening Lord may it come unto me and change my life and then may it spread to my family so may it change the atmosphere in me and then may you now change the atmosphere in my home and no matter what resistance I get Lord I'm not looking at the resistance I'm looking at the End Amen I'm I'm not looking at the here and now you know the kickback I'm looking at the end the Lord because you've got to believe that the life that comes into you his life will make a difference right and it does but you would have confidence in it that it's going to impact those around you amen so let's have the musicians today I'm just going to finish there but God will
