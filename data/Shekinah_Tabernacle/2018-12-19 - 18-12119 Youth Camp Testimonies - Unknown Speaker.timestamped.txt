[11:24] [Music]
[11:26] a man made the words that one okay comp
[11:32] list you can have heavier seats this
[11:34] evening I mean it was there yeah the
[11:57] got a master on the sound s counselor
[11:59] down okay we are good to go
[12:06] so I am testing one picked up the
[12:10] children what day was a um Monday night
[12:14] so we meet here in the and at the front
[12:17] here and I think I've got about an hour
[12:19] and a half of destiny's from tubing and
[12:23] autumn and they were sort of fighting to
[12:26] get in you know that's fun
[12:28] winder would start a story and in the
[12:30] other one that would trigger something
[12:31] to the other one just a year this happen
[12:33] is sort of shun him often it was they
[12:44] had a lot to say so yeah let's uh let's
[12:52] have a testimonial to yeah and we've got
[12:58] the mic already so whoever wants to I
[13:05] wasn't at the camp
[13:07] [Laughter]
[13:20] so I have to backtrack before Kim so you
[13:24] all understand what happened there Kim
[13:26] I've been going through a period recited
[13:28] attacking me and saying oh life so good
[13:32] you must not have the Holy Spirit's you
[13:34] know so no attacks everything's awesome
[13:37] and then after they prior to the camp
[13:40] probably the first week I started
[13:42] thinking about it's a big drive down and
[13:46] why don't you get into a car accident
[13:48] you know like who's gonna look after
[13:50] your kids and would you love the Lord if
[13:52] you were crippled or would you like the
[13:54] Lord if you were in a bed and just like
[13:56] a whole lot of thoughts about what could
[13:58] happen driving down and then I thought
[14:01] of what if me and our man post died in a
[14:04] car accident driving down and so always
[14:07] the nights at 12 o'clock I was in my
[14:09] room and I was writing on a piece of
[14:11] paper if anything had to happen to our
[14:13] minds and tell us to be Hooven and
[14:14] Liam's Tuvok and just like kind of
[14:16] having something in place in case this
[14:19] actually happened because it was the
[14:21] Viet why I was really scared like it was
[14:22] like quite a fear you know and um I
[14:26] didn't I don't think I took it as an
[14:28] attack from Satan at that time so I
[14:30] thought it might be the Lord's trying to
[14:31] prepare it making me you know prepare
[14:33] yourself prepare you should have things
[14:35] in place in it so I'm I definitely bite
[14:38] you we prayed for protection win with me
[14:40] in a run to know ask the girls to pray
[14:41] and I didn't tell them how nervous I
[14:43] actually was to drive down and at one
[14:47] point we were on a passing line and our
[14:49] Munt had overtaken a truck and it was
[14:51] spiced for me to go as well and so I put
[14:54] my foot on the accelerator and I started
[14:56] going and the next thing this truck just
[14:58] cut cut us off and thankfully the Lord
[15:01] just obviously helped don't know how
[15:03] exactly it happened but I managed to get
[15:05] back behind the truck again and the
[15:07] girls will cut freaked out but again I
[15:08] didn't really let them know how freaked
[15:10] out I actually was because you know you
[15:12] also know the brother Branham says when
[15:13] you fear stuff than it normally becomes
[15:15] a reality and so when we got to camp I
[15:17] was so thankful haha we prayed in the
[15:20] car and you know and I didn't think much
[15:22] about it and then the one night brother
[15:24] Andrew was actually preaching in the
[15:27] first thing he took me on about was not
[15:29] having that faith in the Lord and
[15:30] having the fear and so I would help I'm
[15:33] quite convicted about that I was like oh
[15:35] sorry Lord and then he kind of just
[15:37] opened it up because I didn't know what
[15:38] it was until then and so he was like oh
[15:41] so Satan would have woken up on Thursday
[15:43] morning and be like oh oh they came
[15:46] happening oh he didn't get it cancelled
[15:49] you know we were supposed to do this and
[15:51] this didn't happen and they did it and
[15:52] he's like okay no no and he called all
[15:54] the Imps together and he's like you were
[15:56] gonna go and do this and you are gonna
[15:58] do this and I corner me but we said
[16:00] appertaining he in one day he said or he
[16:04] sent him to behave a car accident so
[16:06] that I wouldn't get him and it just all
[16:08] came together at that point and I was so
[16:11] thankful that the Lord heard my prayer
[16:13] and didn't look at my disbelief and why
[16:15] my fears but hurt my priest and kept her
[16:18] safe and God as they despite what the
[16:20] enemy was trying to paint so I praise
[16:22] God for he's he's just awesome he's
[16:25] completely wonderful
[16:28] [Applause]
[16:38] god bless the church I first would like
[16:42] to say thank you to our Lord and our
[16:44] Savior Jesus Christ
[16:45] for just working in our lives as
[16:49] individuals he does things for us that
[16:52] we don't know we don't expect but he's
[16:56] there for us so praise God for what he's
[16:59] doing in our lives each one of us comes
[17:01] our own way and sometime a hard way
[17:06] sometimes easy way so life throws us all
[17:09] this hard knocks and whether we accept
[17:11] it or we don't accept it he's there with
[17:14] us so he's fighting the battle before
[17:16] even we can enter into the battle to
[17:17] make us free so yes I just want to thank
[17:21] the Lord for ways brought me in ways
[17:23] placed me in my church life in my home
[17:26] life with my family with my family here
[17:30] as well he breaks down or breaks down
[17:33] everything that's in front of us that we
[17:35] put up we put up so it breaks all those
[17:38] walls was a wonderful weekend
[17:43] started on witness day from our church
[17:45] after prayer meeting the enemy tried to
[17:49] drop us down as well so my wife and my
[17:52] family weren't here with me on the plane
[17:53] meeting on witness day vo remember
[17:55] everyone was tired
[17:57] everyone weren't sure what they were
[17:58] doing he was throwing darts at all
[18:01] different angles but I was ready for the
[18:04] camp so I was standing in the gap for my
[18:08] family we loaded the trailer it started
[18:11] here got home locks didn't work ran
[18:15] around till midnight finding the locks
[18:16] for the trailer locked everyone's gear
[18:18] all our lovely ladies ball gowns in and
[18:21] all that locked it up kept it safe slept
[18:24] for about two hours got up and I was
[18:26] ready to go get all my family up oh it's
[18:29] too early you said four o'clock well

[18:38] we drove safely picked up Rebecca from
[18:44] fielding and we shot it through armand
[18:47] was behind our hour and a half so they
[18:50] would selli i'd like to thank our pasta
[18:58] our church congregation and sister
[19:01] Chantal my wife for making it possible
[19:07] for all of us to get big as a church as
[19:10] a youth group going together as no one
[19:15] left behind so when we came if we look
[19:18] at our past our life one was left behind
[19:22] one was in one weren't sure where they
[19:24] are but it works now as a body working
[19:27] together no one's left behind
[19:29] so we wherever we needed this we got the
[19:32] support pastor stepped in he made it
[19:35] work I said to Hennelly
[19:37] smile at David oh I don't want to tell
[19:39] you she's not coming but she smiled at
[19:42] David and we went hey David hey so
[19:45] they've cut it for everyone to go and it
[19:47] was so wonderful so I go to the I got to
[19:51] the camp which was a extremely long
[19:54] drive and I agree with you we got the
[19:57] but everything changed
[19:59] so I was having wonderful time of
[20:00] fellowship by the time brother Armand
[20:01] King and lots of more people were
[20:03] turning up we met
[20:05] youth from Australia Vanuatu
[20:10] Christchurch Auckland
[20:13] you know it was just wonderful you'd
[20:16] come together first days but no one's
[20:19] talking like we're finding our way but
[20:24] the Auckland Church I showed us
[20:27] something no matter who you are from no
[20:31] matter what your age is no matter what
[20:34] you know what nationality or what
[20:38] anything that's gonna put up a wall they
[20:42] showed us how the world breaks down they
[20:44] loved and it's received everyone with
[20:47] the biggest welcome I've ever seen from
[20:50] the pastor to the youngest they received
[20:53] each one of us it was the respect the
[20:56] love they welcomed us with open arms
[20:59] and then brother Armand we had the
[21:03] opportunity to drop off the pastor
[21:06] taking the services
[21:09] okay what's his name what's his name
[21:15] talk know what his name so I said David
[21:18] he said something else name but when we
[21:25] caught me we don't know they cited now
[21:29] to be with this pastor driving him along
[21:32] not knowing how young he is and how the
[21:36] Lord is using him and you know what we
[21:39] in forward to know and we got him in the
[21:42] car and brother are mine was like
[21:44] popcorn but couldn't stop talking just
[21:50] always so excited just to be in the
[21:53] presence we were so excited you know
[21:56] like it's like how you said when it when
[21:59] we came on Monday we were so excited all
[22:02] right
[22:03] and I'm trying to get a word in but our
[22:06] mind is there and when either one our
[22:08] man is trying to get a word in
[22:09] so we were like fighting for the time we
[22:11] had with him in the car
[22:13] okay so we left the pastor and we got so
[22:18] that Thursday night but I mother I had
[22:21] time because the families were coming
[22:23] install or the uterus coming in from all
[22:25] over so there was not much happening on
[22:29] the Thursday evening so we had a meal
[22:31] the music right
[22:34] so we had a meal and we went back to our
[22:37] cabin which was separate from all the
[22:39] youth so we had space away from them so
[22:41] we left them to do what they need to do
[22:42] we found ourself a spot and we got a
[22:47] bench and we showed out and gave us time
[22:51] to bond we won and I could talk to each
[22:56] other comfortably had no problems I can
[22:58] talk to other brothers here but this was
[23:00] special for us
[23:01] we spoke things that we needed to speak
[23:04] about we shared with each other as to
[23:07] what the Lord is doing
[23:08] where is he bringing us how is he taking
[23:10] us through the journeys that we're going
[23:12] through through the trials that we're
[23:13] going through and we were so excited to
[23:16] share those things with each other and
[23:17] we shared for part of quite a few hours
[23:20] too late that evening and then we both
[23:22] had to pass and go go to our rooms which
[23:25] was right next to each other so I could
[23:27] have spoken like through the door but
[23:29] yeah electric Autobahn sleepy was but
[23:31] tired
[23:31] and then the Friday service started
[23:36] Friday service okay we set up the place
[23:39] for Adam and I were early we were on
[23:40] site so we helped the Deacons there to
[23:42] set up tidy up do boots and pieces get
[23:45] everything ready so when they come in is
[23:46] not a rush the average church is a
[23:49] little bit different they very relaxed
[23:52] very relaxed so they'll do things in
[23:54] their time and I think we got a little
[23:57] bit order so we want everything done
[23:59] prior so everyone comes they comfortable
[24:01] but all the league stuff I put together
[24:04] makes this big bonfire all right so we
[24:08] hug them out and we we got into this
[24:10] service on Friday night so we're waiting
[24:11] for our pastor who was driving so I'll
[24:14] pass her left work and four or five
[24:15] o'clock drove from Wellington just to
[24:18] come and support each other the Shepherd
[24:23] was there to come and support his
[24:25] children which was fantastic to see and
[24:28] so unfortunately he came at a few
[24:32] minutes past 12:00 and we just got out
[24:34] of the service so we started there about
[24:38] 7:00 we got out of 12 all right so we
[24:41] were lucky
[24:43] the service started and I thought ah you
[24:47] know it's a first service we will just
[24:49] enter in break the ice talk to different
[24:51] people
[24:52] you know pink again pink again he opened
[24:59] his mouth
[25:00] the minister opened his mouth he readies
[25:02] few words from the Bible and he started
[25:06] he came with a loaded machine gun and he
[25:09] had ammunition in cases he just got in
[25:23] he knew exactly who needed what he was
[25:31] in your face to tell you what you needed
[25:32] if you missed out turn around
[25:35] you see he would this aisle to the
[25:38] middle aisle to the outside he went
[25:40] around to let everyone know the Lord is
[25:43] speaking to them directly
[25:44] I mean the Lord is using him to speak to
[25:48] you so he came up to you you never said
[25:50] anything
[25:52] but he came up to you so you know that
[25:54] he was speaking directly to you if you
[25:56] didn't know you're speaking directly to
[25:57] you let me tell you he was speaking
[25:59] directly to you alright how Lord is so
[26:03] wonderful he knew every need in the
[26:06] church every youth that was they came
[26:09] with some kind of question some burden
[26:14] some unanswered prayer that they thought
[26:18] to be prayed for before but didn't get
[26:19] answered he broke down every wall
[26:24] Friday night service turned into Sunday
[26:28] service with a call for a prayer line
[26:30] there was no prayer line called the Lord
[26:33] came down the devil was at the door the
[26:38] lights went off but that sound and the
[26:41] lights on the stage didn't go let's came
[26:43] on went off again thunder and lightning
[26:46] where the Lord was kicking this devil
[26:48] right out he had knows no place to stand
[26:52] we walked out the church at midnight
[26:55] drenched but everyone it was we needed
[26:59] that water to come and wash us we were
[27:02] on fire in the church and when we came
[27:04] out he just gave us a cleansing and we
[27:08] walked through that and we never said Oh

[27:12] straight to the dining hall we're all
[27:13] excited we want to share what can he do

[27:17] I'll tell you every thing that I went
[27:20] there for I've got an abundantly but
[27:25] everyone and I shared intimate things

[29:04] lovely Lord that we self we need to
[29:08] bring that liquefier home we need to
[29:12] start the revival here in our church for
[29:15] what I've seen the Lord do in Auckland I
[29:18] know the Lord is doing it here but we

[30:54] can tell you every one of our children
[30:57] got something from those services when
[31:02] I've seen that I knew for myself we can
[31:06] let go now
[31:06] because the Lord has got you I'm so
[31:09] proud to see how children entering him
[31:12] pulling on that word receiving that word
[31:14] and chewing it and eating it up and just
[31:17] having fun being themselves being free
[31:20] having the Liberty to praise having the
[31:22] Liberty to worship and having the
[31:24] Liberty to just pull on the Lord's word
[31:27] and use it because if we were there and
[31:31] we didn't get nothing out of it then we
[31:35] actually lost we went all that way for
[31:39] no reason and I didn't see that David I
[31:44] saw you as well Hannah I saw you the you

[32:40] who drove up like without you guys

[32:46] there and for me I was too scared to
[32:51] raise up my hand and set up the church
[32:54] but after being me I was just free and I
[32:56] was able to do all of that I gave my
[33:00] life thank God for coming down you know
[33:24] these all those services and only thing
[33:28] for the bin for letting us all go yeah
[33:31] all our parents for letting us go to and
[33:35] it was just great we had the freedom to
[33:37] put up our hand stand up yeah on Friday
[33:43] night um the service was some massive um
[33:47] Hebron was standing up everyone got the
[33:50] Holy Ghost if they wanted it and the
[33:56] lights cut off but we still praise God
[34:00] yeah Brandon was free and it started to
[34:06] bring and thunder and um after that
[34:09] around left and um I walked all the way
[34:12] to my cabin by myself but I wasn't
[34:14] scared like I was walking in the pitch
[34:18] black white wasn't skipping sin you
[34:20] caught rows with me and yeah
[34:25] [Applause]
[34:36] I've been listening to all these
[34:38] testimonies that I've been feeling I
[34:40] should go up but I shouldn't scared okay
[34:43] well I've got a testimony to share and I
[34:45] want to share it tonight so on the
[34:48] Thursday we arrives and you kind of get
[34:51] to know everybody you know these new
[34:53] people that's a bit awkward and then on
[34:56] the Friday you're expecting a great day
[34:58] it's gonna be awesome
[34:59] it's just one news no it wasn't that way
[35:04] or Friday for me I expected too much and
[35:07] altogether the day wasn't really as good
[35:10] as I expected it to be and so when the
[35:13] service came I wasn't expecting a lot
[35:15] and so you know you sit down you pull
[35:19] out your notebook
[35:19] write down the date the pasta he gives
[35:22] this title you write it down and then
[35:25] you sit down and you prepare to listen
[35:32] you weren't just listening you are
[35:35] standing up you are shouting you're
[35:37] screaming you're screaming as hard as
[35:39] you could and you couldn't hear yourself
[35:40] everyone else behind you and at the end
[35:43] of the service
[35:44] you kind of got tired of having this yes
[35:46] sit down stand up sit down amen sit down
[35:51] yeah so you just put down your notebook
[35:53] and you stood up and you just stood
[35:54] there so I think a lot of skinny people
[35:58] went down to that camp well he preached
[36:05] on a lot of things that I was struggling
[36:07] with and my main reason for going to
[36:11] camp was to get the Holy Ghost because I
[36:13] felt that I didn't have it and I really
[36:14] wanted it yes well I got it
[36:21] [Music]
[36:24] I was standing and I was raising my
[36:26] hands and it was the pasta
[36:29] he has gone off because he was tired he
[36:32] started spitting up in the first 10
[36:33] minutes of preaching to us it was that
[36:35] it
[36:35] that's much he just gave it all to us
[36:38] and he didn't hold back which was a
[36:40] place in because if he'd held back I
[36:41] wouldn't have received what I did and
[36:44] then I saw Naomi up at the front and she
[36:48] was jumping up and down and screaming
[36:50] and praising the Lord so I moved between
[36:53] the cheers oh by the way I would have
[36:56] said at the back but I've been told that
[36:57] you could only sit between anywhere
[37:00] between the first and the third run so I
[37:03] chose the second road on the first night
[37:07] and I saw Naomi on the first time I say
[37:11] I sort of pushed the cheese aside like
[37:13] gave her a hug let us thought you know
[37:16] I'm up here I'm enjoying myself I might
[37:18] as well stay up here so I stayed and
[37:22] they started singing and then I don't
[37:28] know how it happened five minutes
[37:30] afterwards I found myself on my knees
[37:32] praising God and you know you kind of
[37:36] feel bit self-conscious after I was
[37:40] shaking after the first five minutes of
[37:42] being up there you know you look kind of
[37:44] that way and you keep on frankly you
[37:46] look that way this there's nobody there
[37:48] I mean you look around you everyone's
[37:52] behind you on the knees screaming and
[37:54] praising God and it's just such a
[37:56] blessing oh I mean well I can't remember
[38:01] I just I was praying yes
[38:03] and then I feeling came down on me and I
[38:09] knew that I never needed to want the
[38:11] Holy Ghost again because I had it and
[38:15] that's a bit of a thing but I ran around
[38:18] the church scraping because I was a it
[38:22] was a listen coming to me
[38:25] it wasn't listening for me the villian I
[38:28] just enjoyed it so much and I've never
[38:30] ever regretted it and use the power did
[38:33] cut out and the the Thunder and the
[38:36] lightning and it was just it was amazing
[38:39] the way that God worked it's just
[38:40] wonderful and yes that's my destiny
[38:47] [Applause]
[38:57] before the camp some of you may know
[39:01] that we had a bit of the trial it was on
[39:06] the Tuesday night that um we couldn't
[39:09] all go and I know the devil was trying
[39:12] to take us and our family and trying to
[39:15] rob us from all of us kissing on the
[39:20] Wednesday night wasn't able to service
[39:25] but I was just praying and just it was
[39:29] so good because we were all able to go
[39:32] and just be free and so grateful and yes
[39:38] on the way up there yes I was praying
[39:42] for protection just trusting the Lord
[39:44] and when that happened when sister
[39:47] Chantel was talking about how we
[39:49] couldn't overtake we were yes shocked in
[39:52] but I just could see the hand of God
[39:54] just watching over us nothing could stop
[39:57] us going to that camp and for me that um
[40:00] the whole camp was a recharge yeah for
[40:05] us it's still hard but the fire still
[40:10] going I mean this might be my last camp
[40:16] before
[40:24] God's given everything I needed
[40:27] but that Andrew was talking about family
[40:30] curses and breaking family cycles Oh
[40:33] like that that's for us you know yeah
[40:39] and also forgiveness as well I had a lot
[40:45] of things built up it was quite a
[40:49] struggle but it was just that love that
[40:53] you could have for those who keep
[40:56] persecuting you even though your loved
[40:58] ones like yeah just thank the Lord that
[41:04] he got every need and I'm just so happy
[41:11] just thinking about the camp before oh
[41:13] it's just screaming inside oh so happy
[41:23] everything and put all your prayers you
[41:44] and I just want to thank also brother
[41:46] Ben and God for letting me go to camp
[41:56] like it's the past oh it's pretty
[41:59] I just get so excited and you just come
[42:04] sit down amazing it's like what I just
[42:14] needed just feel free you just you don't
[42:20] care by yourself anyway just think about
[42:22] it god
[42:23] like I was just amazing like the way God
[42:27] came down I also loved I'm at the end of
[42:33] the services like you got a chance to
[42:35] just praise the Lord and done something
[42:42] [Applause]
[42:56] hello everyone
[42:59] he had a great camp with lots of new
[43:02] faces lots of new people people from
[43:05] Salman Vanuatu he is pretty cool
[43:08] there was always generally like a lot of
[43:10] stuff to do they are quite like that
[43:11] like you weren't sitting down doing
[43:13] nothing and um I think one of the most
[43:16] favorite things I liked better was I'm
[43:19] at the Friday service when I was
[43:24] preaching all the lights turned off and
[43:26] all the people that were like shy and
[43:28] stuff they will some like praising God
[43:30] and everything yeah that's great hey
[43:34] that's pretty cool
[43:36] thank you I get excited
[43:48] amen praise the Lord like I made a list
[43:53] but I'll try to go for it fast okay God
[43:57] is so good are you so good that seed
[44:04] inside you remember what he said nobody
[44:07] can take it away so the whole camp theme
[44:10] is have you received the Holy Ghost but
[44:12] see that seed inside you they will
[44:14] cannot take away it's there it's just a
[44:17] time where the water falls and the Sun
[44:19] shines on it and it starts growing so if
[44:22] you don't feel you have the seat
[44:23] remember God place today you cannot
[44:25] place a day God places a day it's his
[44:28] work and it's a finished work okay so I
[44:32] just wanted to say that because that's
[44:33] what I've gone out of thing it starts
[44:36] with a burden brother bean we love you
[44:39] okay and we love you you do what you do
[44:43] and we'll keep on praying for you
[44:46] because it's someone that stands in the
[44:48] gap remember what that pastor ndred save
[44:51] is someone that stands in the gap and as
[44:53] a burden for the children that gets so
[44:56] much done behind the scenes that they
[44:58] can just forget about themselves
[45:00] as the testimonies sin and just worship
[45:03] our God
[45:04] and exactly that brother Cuban our
[45:06] church members they was prayer put into
[45:09] this thing this didn't just happen this
[45:12] was preordained by God this meeting was
[45:15] different and if you wanted to be set
[45:18] free he was there but remember he did
[45:21] not stay at camp he did not stay at camp
[45:25] because that pastor didn't come
[45:26] introduce a car of yesterday and he's
[45:29] not introducing a God of tomorrow but
[45:31] he's introducing a a prison guard right
[45:33] now okay
[45:34] so didn't stop the brother Andy you were
[45:40] preaching on walking on water we were
[45:42] walking on water okay if I ever said
[45:45] I'll keep this taste of money
[45:47] the Friday brother Cuban says I
[45:49] shouldn't go in and mix him there were
[45:51] the kids because it is for the children
[45:54] and we know parents they so so we
[45:57] basically just took the kids thing and
[45:59] you know as me I always want to be part
[46:01] of the kids and always want to get stuck
[46:03] in you know and and just because that's
[46:04] just my gift and brother Cuban wants
[46:07] when he sees that we just don't do it we
[46:08] now have to respect him let's take em
[46:10] and I want to say thanks while I'm on
[46:12] that for brother Andrew and brother
[46:14] Freddy and brother Ferdie and brother
[46:18] steward a brother Tazewell and rather
[46:21] Zion they're worthy they were brothers
[46:23] that were just they to serve the
[46:26] children and they were amazing at it and
[46:28] I've learned so much but I don't want to
[46:31] take away from this testimony so I could
[46:33] play with the children because I I see
[46:35] something I don't like and and I want to
[46:38] go and try to help so I thought I go and
[46:41] try to do God a favor now cuz I'm gonna
[46:43] now show them that there's all the
[46:45] brothers and we got the young brothers
[46:46] and all those things and I'm just gonna
[46:48] go play so we do play and somebody
[46:50] leaves the water-bottle day and I don't
[46:51] see it and as I grab the ball to turn
[46:54] around a step on the bottle and my toe
[46:55] folds under the bottle and with my white
[46:58] going over I step on my whole foot and
[47:00] and my whole big toe all the way down to
[47:04] two a year at the breech just it's just
[47:07] raked I knew exactly the moment I did it
[47:10] I knew like when you stepped on your on
[47:12] your knee you know this is not good so I
[47:15] try to shake it off I said no it's not
[47:18] and I'm Lord I just think you and I keep
[47:19] on walking and the very next step I try
[47:22] to stick my foot gives in and I know
[47:23] it's done I've hurt myself so brother
[47:26] Cuban comes and he sees me limping and
[47:28] this is just a deacon and I want to
[47:30] share this because these rules God
[47:32] sometimes put things in order for us not
[47:34] to go around him and I walk and buy the
[47:36] cumin goes what happened with you I said
[47:38] I know I just hurt my foot but I'm all
[47:40] right he said but I told you not to go
[47:42] there and it's true because I wasn't
[47:45] supposed to be there because God wanted
[47:47] us to fellowship that night so that what
[47:50] we fellowship the Buttkicker could come
[47:52] over the pulpit the next day and it was
[47:55] perfect brother Kimmy knows God is my
[47:58] witness it was perfect it was like
[48:00] brother Andrew was sitting between me
[48:02] and Cuban and even chatting with so that
[48:06] the night they said we're going to take
[48:08] the workshop for next day and we're
[48:09] gonna make it a bit earlier and they
[48:11] kind of just threw me into this workshop
[48:12] and I found myself with brother el ray
[48:15] and now we're giving this workshop and I
[48:18] open my computer and my whole
[48:21] presentations gone
[48:22] and I'm like oh Lord you know cuz it's
[48:26] just gone and I thought ah well anyways
[48:29] I'm gonna just say it as it is and I say
[48:32] it is it isn't I leave at thee and I
[48:33] speak about worship and I speak about to
[48:36] worship God in spirit and truth and they
[48:39] brother Andrew brings it out any sermon
[48:40] and he says you have to worship God in
[48:42] spirit and truth and this is very
[48:44] important and by the Ellroy cause I felt
[48:47] a bit like I was all over the show and I
[48:48] walked out of the there listen and I say
[48:51] to brother El Rey these words I said I
[48:53] just think I just kind of missed it a
[48:55] bit ugly I'm sorry because don't you
[48:57] worry you just do what God tells you to
[49:00] do you see ya and it's all he said and
[49:02] he had a sermon and I want you guys to
[49:04] hear it and he said remember when he
[49:06] says God picks up a glass and he cleans
[49:09] the glass and sanctification and in the
[49:13] glass is clean and he falls it with the
[49:14] Holy Ghost and he puts it into all and
[49:16] to work but only when he falls that he
[49:18] can put it into work so he's speaking
[49:20] about this and yet comes brother and
[49:21] when he preaches this very thing
[49:23] confirmation this is the night after
[49:24] that the next morning so God has in mind
[49:27] is the reason these things happen and
[49:29] then he said this thing and it make
[49:31] really have because he being jumped out
[49:33] of his seat ran from the one side of the
[49:36] truth to me to tell me this did you hear
[49:39] that he was speaking of brother Arawa
[49:41] okay so before we wait this is my
[49:45] testimony solo on a really shame I
[49:47] wanted brother either one to drive with
[49:49] us I wanted to go to either one and say
[49:51] it I love you and I know you love the
[49:53] children why don't you come with and we
[49:55] can feel if ship they just come with
[49:56] anyways and and Chantal asked me why
[50:00] don't you just ask anyone because you
[50:01] know he loves it and this is the truth
[50:03] so help me God is my witness and I say
[50:06] to Chantal and so I just leave it for
[50:08] now that very same day that was just a
[50:11] company I want to go with so we only had
[50:28] that seat left see Andrew had to be
[50:31] there but see he had to be there as well
[50:33] because I'll tell you this story
[50:35] anyone stood in this church and we've
[50:37] got it on tape and he said I was
[50:40] listening to that song undefeated he
[50:43] says and all I hear there is he was
[50:45] under this feet and he is under this
[50:47] feet and then he said if you're the skin
[50:49] on the pink of the tour did you say that
[50:51] was it your did it
[50:52] so the past away the unfurls brother
[50:54] Anderson I'm the skin on the toe the
[50:57] pinky under the the lift on that scheme
[51:00] this is the little Eve little toe it's
[51:02] just but I want to tell you one thing
[51:04] Satan is still under my feet and it
[51:09] could be a tough tough buddy which is
[51:10] good enough I will just help
[51:11] and so I hurt my foot really bad and I
[51:14] can't stand I can't walk I can't even
[51:16] put it in a shoe but you know what the
[51:17] preaching starts I'm sitting in the che
[51:19] and my foot like this and that's so man
[51:22] and it just feels frobbie
[51:24] and they're all dancing and I stand up
[51:25] and you you like jump on the one you
[51:27] know but you don't you know you can't
[51:29] really use it but you know what I sit
[51:32] down and he starts preaching and my foot
[51:34] goes numb you know when you're getting
[51:35] injection from the doctor and it all
[51:37] goes just numb you're just my foot feels
[51:40] like that the moment the preaching
[51:41] starts and I find myself as brother can
[51:44] be jumping behind the
[51:45] and running and my foots not hurting
[51:48] this much now I want to ask you what is
[51:50] that but now it's telepathy but when I'm
[51:55] in the service that doesn't matter and
[51:57] it's not adrenaline it's not interested
[51:59] because it happens before I get excited
[52:01] not when I get excited right so there's
[52:04] a difference and then and then just the
[52:08] last thing he said this he came up the
[52:12] first service and he said I want to play
[52:14] you guys a song and he said he played
[52:15] the song of one of her church member
[52:18] they buy them late and he says table we
[52:20] are through yeah and I promise you that
[52:24] Kemp said it for us all all our youth we
[52:27] say devil we are through god bless you
[52:31] and I thank you that the Lord has done
[52:33] so much days much more but I would talk
[52:35] the whole night if I do there but I want
[52:37] to say brother beam we pray for you and
[52:39] we thank you for everything you do for
[52:41] us and we see it he doesn't let the
[52:59] devil win it's amazing what can happen
[53:12] when we are all in one mind one Accord
[53:17] hot I experienced that at the meeting
[53:21] it's amazing when we can all get like
[53:24] that how the presence of the Lord can
[53:27] come down me the highlight was beautiful
[53:33] just having such a Liberty such a
[53:38] freedom to raise not a hand half way not
[53:43] one hand up that way but both both hands
[53:50] screaming shouting not worried who's on
[53:53] the Left who's on the right falling on
[53:57] the knees

[54:02] never ever seen something so incredible
[54:04] so amazing
[54:06] lives have been changed completely the
[54:10] Holy Spirit is seen on your faces I just
[54:16] stand amazed at the things that the Lord
[54:18] has done this weekend not only did he do

[54:26] refilling for me so wonderful he didn't
[54:29] forget clearance as well and also he's a
[54:32] personal God so what he did for me was
[54:36] Sunday was my University so anyway the
[54:41] best thing we had to services so that
[54:45] after the preaching I was going to I
[54:48] wasn't going to shake the brother's hand

[54:53] ranged he was hiring he was panting no

[59:06] worship and she just randomly took off
[59:10] because you could feel the presence you
[59:12] think it wasn't a joke it wasn't like
[59:14] something that was planned or rehearsed

[59:32] things I could say but it's just it's a
[59:34] lot it's you can I don't know where to

[59:40] looking forward to something another
[59:42] camp happening um next year or even yeah
[59:46] next year cuz this year's ended yes so
[59:48] next year yeah
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:59] I know it wasn't at the camp but oh and
[1:00:29] and then as a parent you know um you
[1:00:33] just know the supernatural and you know
[1:00:35] it this earth is a battleground and you
[1:00:38] want the most for your children in life
[1:00:40] is to the Lord that they give them their
[1:00:43] life over to the Lord and they get their
[1:00:46] riches in heaven you know and they they
[1:00:48] just give them so oh and just a gift of
[1:00:52] eternal life and then to hear a heinous
[1:00:54] testimony oh I was so blessed
[1:00:59] Oh what can you say you know what grace
[1:01:03] and um I was telling her um when she
[1:01:07] told me I was like oh you know make sure
[1:01:10] to write it down and um and tell people
[1:01:14] you know and and it even rekindled a
[1:01:17] fire in my own self time um you know cuz
[1:01:20] you give your testimony so often and you
[1:01:22] get you you tell people that don't
[1:01:24] necessarily want to hear so you kind of
[1:01:26] get a little bit quiet about it and um
[1:01:29] it was really neat I was hi dad
[1:01:31] pointment today and I was I'm just in
[1:01:33] prayer and stuff and and before their
[1:01:35] appointment and I had this appointment
[1:01:36] in this this guy was sitting down and
[1:01:40] you know I had to give him information
[1:01:42] and stuff out of discs and things and um
[1:01:45] and I don't know how we got on the
[1:01:47] subject but I said are you a Christian
[1:01:49] and I
[1:01:51] not to tell me he was but I felt the
[1:01:53] presence of the Lord so strongly I
[1:01:54] started crying at this office and their
[1:01:57] hates the people not like oh I'm sorry
[1:02:00] I'm so emotional I do this at church I
[1:02:02] just feel the presence of the Lord and I
[1:02:03] go you must be a Christian he goes yes I
[1:02:05] am and he had also many computer
[1:02:08] glitches all we did was testify the
[1:02:10] whole time about Lauren I was so blessed
[1:02:12] and I had another thing I was blessed
[1:02:14] about was that day you left the children
[1:02:17] and I we were so blessed we had a little
[1:02:20] devotions and it was so when you were
[1:02:23] telling me the testimony about the car
[1:02:25] traveling we prayed that the Lord would
[1:02:27] put that same angel that was trying to
[1:02:30] stop Balaam you know with the donkey
[1:02:32] that big evening angel soared and we're
[1:02:34] praying put those angels around the cars
[1:02:37] you know and we just knew the Lord was
[1:02:40] with you and protecting you and yeah and
[1:02:42] I also ever think our pastor and the
[1:02:44] pastor's wife oh I'm just so thankful to
[1:02:48] the Lord Jesus we're bringing us here
[1:02:50] and it's such an amazing amazing family
[1:02:54] of God go please well yes I just felt
[1:03:06] like testifying and my high points as
[1:03:10] well as sister Vanessa was our young
[1:03:12] people the move of the Holy Spirit I
[1:03:17] have seen outpourings of Holy Spirit
[1:03:20] before this mother first time I have
[1:03:21] witnessed things like this and when it
[1:03:26] happened in the camp I knew what was
[1:03:29] happening the way I saw the Holy Spirit
[1:03:33] move with Hannah it's not something you
[1:03:35] don't make it up because the message was
[1:03:40] going on
[1:03:41] and once you're struck by the Holy
[1:03:43] Spirit there's no stopping
[1:03:50] you know at a point you know when the
[1:03:53] fire was I could not believe it that we
[1:04:13] have the opportunity to have such an
[1:04:15] experience to know that it's not man
[1:04:17] it's not us trying to work up something
[1:04:20] it doesn't work but when the Holy Spirit
[1:04:23] descends himself yeah that's nothing you
[1:04:26] can do about it there's no invitation
[1:04:28] there's no me making anything it just
[1:04:30] moves you so I'm really really happy
[1:04:33] that you were surrender to the Lord you
[1:04:36] know you went to be meeting with
[1:04:38] prepared hearts to hear and to take in
[1:04:41] the world you didn't sit in the seat of
[1:04:43] discomfort yeah you were there to
[1:04:46] worship that was the reason why the most
[1:04:48] visited here and I encourage you to keep
[1:04:51] on holding on keep on keep the fire okay
[1:05:05] you can close it before I just after I
[1:05:12] struggled men I wanted to be there I you
[1:05:17] can feel sorry for me but that's alright
[1:05:20] that's alright the Lord knows I I was I
[1:05:24] was there was a jealousy I watched those
[1:05:26] video clips of the half a heart I didn't
[1:05:29] want to even engaged in it because I
[1:05:31] knew but now this coming through this
[1:05:34] pulpit or this microphone I've I've led
[1:05:38] and I've been through multiple games I
[1:05:42] cannot tell you how many from South
[1:05:44] Africa I've been a little boy when my
[1:05:46] dad had to go through his spiritual walk
[1:05:49] and I was going along and I did my butt
[1:05:52] and all under this thumb and didn't
[1:05:54] national wing and everything I've done
[1:05:56] my own camps and New Zealand and in
[1:05:58] South Africa done it was Rodney seal
[1:06:00] I've done it with John William Davidson
[1:06:02] I've done it with heaps you do not you
[1:06:06] do not enter into a Friday night service
[1:06:10] or what I've heard now it cannot only be
[1:06:14] emotion and I was not there but from
[1:06:18] this I know
[1:06:19] thus saith what I know it is true I know
[1:06:22] that there was a movement thank you that
[1:06:25] you brought this back for us thank you
[1:06:27] that we can rejoice in what this is what
[1:06:30] any parent would love to see if you
[1:06:33] asked me in 2007 what would I want for
[1:06:35] my children would be rock star or a
[1:06:38] rugby player or something like that for
[1:06:40] the highest accolade I just want them to
[1:06:44] be filled with the Holy Ghost all I want
[1:06:47] all I want and it came over now and you
[1:06:50] can buy boys what we talked about last
[1:07:02] night
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:11] that's the Lord
[1:07:14] that's the Lord and it's trials after
[1:07:24] trials and then the Lord had to keep me
[1:07:27] busy because I had to be here and
[1:07:35] there's more testimonies to come the the
[1:07:40] the fellowship that's going on in the
[1:07:42] nerdier house is good awesome
[1:07:45] alright so they will come something from
[1:07:47] there and we serve a living God yes now
[1:07:54] you can come across it's just a real man
[1:08:05] they can cry okay so this is my this is
[1:08:09] the finish of it okay
[1:08:11] I made some more notes but I try to
[1:08:15] finish because I know we need to do the
[1:08:16] play one thing one thing that stood out
[1:08:21] and that's what they slogan was at the
[1:08:24] camp
[1:08:24] it says if it is to be it's up to me and
[1:08:29] if it is up to me it is to be so if God
[1:08:33] started that work a man is gonna finish
[1:08:36] that work and I want to encourage you
[1:08:38] youth do not leave that lick a fire they
[1:08:43] too much happen okay we have no excuse
[1:08:47] to push this battle yeah we have no
[1:08:50] excuse one thing I learned from that
[1:08:52] faster then I myself to come board is if
[1:08:56] you stand back for the devil he will
[1:08:58] take that ground but if you go straight
[1:09:00] anew his face he has to go cause when
[1:09:02] the light shine darkness has to
[1:09:04] disappear so all I'm asking you this is
[1:09:07] not a feeling this is not an emotion I
[1:09:09] want to ask what happened they just
[1:09:11] carry all right there's no way that they
[1:09:14] will can steal that because the the
[1:09:16] pastor said on the first night is a
[1:09:18] devil we are through so that means we
[1:09:20] are through yeah that doesn't mean your
[1:09:22] barrel is gonna stop that just means
[1:09:24] it is a done work and just keep walking
[1:09:26] okay so you have no excuse to stand in
[1:09:29] this juice and not raise your hand to
[1:09:30] your Lord because if you've done it
[1:09:32] there's the same Liberty hair same
[1:09:35] Liberty and its effect was what you reap
[1:09:40] you will saw when you sow you will reap
[1:09:41] so if you want a blessing in church go
[1:09:44] get your bliss no excuse okay god bless
[1:09:46] you and you know what I'm worthy you
[1:09:49] worthy I promise you we count these
[1:09:53] things that we face the monies that we
[1:09:54] can be the whole night busy with yes and
[1:09:56] I know we got to do the play but
[1:09:58] everyone in this church was they
[1:10:00] everyone was they it was special and
[1:10:04] I'll never forget and I encourage you
[1:10:05] youth if you ever can go to a youth camp
[1:10:08] or a camp a family camp don't even not
[1:10:11] go because it does give you some and
[1:10:15] look forward to it but that youth camp
[1:10:17] is still here that same God climbed in
[1:10:20] the car with us and we're still here so
[1:10:24] let's have a revival guys please
[1:10:26] everybody
