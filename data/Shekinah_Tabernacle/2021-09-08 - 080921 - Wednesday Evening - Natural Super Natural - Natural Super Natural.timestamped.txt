[38:12] and all speak with tongues and they come
[38:14] in those that are unlearned or
[38:15] unbelievers will they not say
[38:18] that ye are mad
[38:19] but a full prophesy and there coming one
[38:22] that believeth not or one unlearned he
[38:24] is convinced he is convinced of all he
[38:26] is judged of all
[38:28] and thus the secrets of his heart made
[38:30] manifest and so falling down on his face
[38:32] he will worship god and report that god
[38:34] is in you of a truth
[38:37] amen you can take your seats this
[38:38] evening
[38:42] and
[38:44] the
[38:45] thought that i have on my heart
[38:47] this evening it's it's a very very
[38:48] simple thought
[38:51] and
[38:53] it's
[38:56] i'm calling it a natural
[38:58] supernatural a very natural supernatural
[39:03] because
[39:04] all of us here are supernatural people
[39:07] [Music]
[39:08] we're we are
[39:10] not natural people by any stretch of the
[39:11] imagination we are a very supernatural
[39:14] people and that's just normal for us
[39:17] it's not
[39:18] unusual or
[39:19] hard or anything like that we're
[39:21] actually a supernatural people
[39:23] we're not
[39:24] we are not natural so that's my
[39:27] if that's my message of exhortation to
[39:30] you this evening it's that regardless of
[39:31] what you might think in your mind you
[39:32] are
[39:33] you are you all are very supernatural
[39:35] people
[39:36] and you're you're you've got this thing
[39:38] called faith that is very powerful
[39:41] and it works outside of all that you can
[39:43] see and
[39:44] you are very powerful supernatural
[39:46] people and take that really take that on
[39:48] board because that's that's the truth
[39:50] this is not just something we make up
[39:52] and we kind of feel good about ourselves
[39:54] when we talk about it this is a reality
[39:56] that we live is supernatural so that's
[39:59] going to be my theme tonight is
[40:01] it's just supernatural i'm just going to
[40:02] talk about it in a relaxed way because
[40:04] it sometimes we get too worried about
[40:06] things and we
[40:07] we
[40:08] make things up too high that we don't
[40:10] think we can quite attain to them
[40:12] but it's not really that hard it's all
[40:15] very very quite simple just relax and it
[40:16] just all happens it's very quite normal
[40:18] that's the
[40:19] time that we're living in you know
[40:21] we look around us and we don't know what
[40:22] to make of the situation that we see
[40:24] around us you know there are all these
[40:25] different trains of thought and time
[40:26] will tell what this whole
[40:32] situation is right we don't know time
[40:34] will tell what it is maybe just a
[40:36] passing fed
[40:37] maybe this maybe that
[40:40] all i know is this we're at the
[40:41] basically at the last chapter of of of
[40:43] humanity
[40:45] something's going to happen
[40:46] we're in the closing chapter and i'm
[40:48] glad that the the important for us is
[40:50] that we are going from
[40:52] natural to supernatural from earthly to
[40:55] heavenly
[40:56] from mortal to immortality that's the
[40:59] journey we're on so regardless of all
[41:02] the stuff you know that we we doing all
[41:03] this sort of carry on don't worry about
[41:05] it don't worry a thing about it our
[41:06] journey is from natural to supernatural
[41:09] that's the that's the path that we're on
[41:11] you know and and it's not going to be a
[41:13] surprise that we end up further and
[41:14] further down that path that we we we are
[41:16] eventually going to be so far down that
[41:18] we just our bodies just change one day
[41:20] we just
[41:21] this earth can't hold us anymore it just
[41:22] it gives up i give up i can't hold you
[41:24] no more
[41:26] this immortality this mortality shall
[41:28] put on immortality so so don't worry
[41:30] about all the stuff you see around you
[41:31] that's the don't worry about that
[41:33] program our program we know what our
[41:34] program is it's that we're on a we're on
[41:36] this journey from we're on a journey out
[41:38] of here that's uh it's our program
[41:41] so
[41:43] i'm gonna just say a few stories about
[41:45] something that that intrigues me and it
[41:47] should intrigue you too when you think
[41:48] about the situations like this
[41:50] i got this picture here and i'm gonna
[41:52] just
[41:55] you'll know what the story is when i
[41:56] tell you it was it was brother brandon
[41:58] when he
[41:59] prayed for the boys in finland so he's
[42:02] he's in finland and then they're driving
[42:04] around with some brothers on a
[42:05] missionary trip and they they drive down
[42:06] a hill and and then they see there's
[42:08] been a terrible accident and a couple of
[42:10] boys had been run over by a
[42:12] i think it was a
[42:13] some sort of ford motor car 1935 ford
[42:16] had spun around and it is these
[42:19] i think the story goes that these boys
[42:21] were used to horses and buggies and that
[42:22] and they weren't used to these cars
[42:23] going so fast down the road that they it
[42:25] caught them by surprise and then this
[42:27] guy had one of them and
[42:28] hit the other boy so
[42:30] and that this isn't the picture but just
[42:32] to
[42:33] put it into our reality if you sometimes
[42:35] hear these things on tape and you think
[42:37] wow
[42:38] it seems so far away but it was just
[42:40] would have just looked like something
[42:41] like this as a car accident you know
[42:43] after marvel that elijah the prophet
[42:45] drove in a motor car
[42:47] you know and
[42:48] and went to mcdonald's if they had
[42:50] mcdonald's back then and you know
[42:54] he did all the he didn't just walk
[42:55] around in a in a sheepskin and eat
[42:58] locust elijah came here and did the
[43:00] things that we do
[43:01] heard music when he went into the mall
[43:03] saw everything he was here and he turned
[43:06] up here and saw this here
[43:08] and
[43:10] and the the brothers there were quite
[43:12] taken back by the situation and the
[43:14] brothers that were with
[43:15] brother branham because they had sons as
[43:16] well and they were overcome with emotion
[43:18] about it and brother branham looked over
[43:20] there and
[43:22] and he was just wondering what to do and
[43:24] you know thinking sad what if that was
[43:25] my boy and those sorts of things and
[43:27] i'll just pick it up here he says and as
[43:29] i started to turn around i looked in
[43:30] front of the little boy i felt something
[43:32] go
[43:34] i said maybe that's just my sympathy for
[43:36] the little fellow
[43:39] i started to make it another step and
[43:40] something went
[43:42] i waited just a moment i turned around i
[43:44] said
[43:45] let me see that boy again
[43:47] and they pulled back the the coat that
[43:49] they had laying over him because he was
[43:50] laying there dead
[43:52] and he said i've seen that boy somewhere
[43:55] i said ask those ministers if he's been
[43:58] in
[43:58] the church if he's a member of their
[44:00] church any of you guys know this boy he
[44:02] looks familiar to me maybe he's been
[44:03] through the prayer line or something
[44:06] they said no he said has he ever been in
[44:07] the prayer line brother lindsay said no
[44:08] he said i
[44:11] no he said i've seen him somewhere but i
[44:13] don't know where
[44:15] i don't know where i've seen this little
[44:16] boy before
[44:18] then he looked around and he saw a bunch
[44:19] of rocks
[44:22] i looked around and i saw them big rocks
[44:23] piled up laying there i said praise god
[44:25] i know where i saw him
[44:30] i said brother moore get your bible
[44:32] brother lindsay said what's the matter
[44:35] brother branham i said look at the
[44:36] folder the leaf in your bible
[44:39] so who's got an actual bible here
[44:41] so imagine if you were with them and and
[44:45] 10 years ago
[44:47] you were brother brown's friend 10 years
[44:48] ago had said to you whoever many years
[44:50] it was write down that i'm going to see
[44:52] the boy he's going to be raised back to
[44:54] life there's going to be rocks around
[44:55] all these certain things you've you've
[44:57] written it down thinking this is
[44:58] interesting i wonder what's going to
[44:59] happen here so imagine you then you open
[45:00] your bible and you read the fly leaf
[45:03] and he said
[45:05] that's the that's the
[45:08] little boy that's going to be raised be
[45:10] raised from the dead
[45:12] brother moore ran over to the car and
[45:14] got his bible and he opened it up and it
[45:16] said brown hair
[45:17] brown eyes about eight years old
[45:20] poorly dressed crippled being mashed by
[45:23] an accident a rocky land
[45:26] i said brother branham that's it i said
[45:28] that's him amen
[45:31] now
[45:34] now this situation ought to really
[45:36] intrigue us
[45:37] beyond belief
[45:40] but i say not beyond belief because we
[45:41] believe
[45:44] but this is an outstanding situation
[45:47] when you stop and think about the
[45:48] magnitude of what just happened here
[45:52] how on earth
[45:55] could someone know the future
[45:58] how on earth
[46:01] when you start to compre try and
[46:03] comprehend that understanding
[46:07] then you ask yourself then what of all
[46:08] this
[46:10] how did how did somebody know that
[46:13] situation there
[46:15] has it already happened
[46:17] or is someone just going to orchestrate
[46:18] it so it happens
[46:21] what is going on here
[46:25] think deeply about this this has got to
[46:27] be the most intriguing thing because we
[46:29] would say well we don't know what's
[46:30] going to happen tomorrow
[46:34] but
[46:35] what's going on here then
[46:39] then where is tomorrow
[46:41] where is it all
[46:43] where does it exist
[46:46] what are we in
[46:47] something happened here where somebody
[46:49] said i'm going to see this sometime in
[46:51] the future and if if this is all true
[46:53] then this something very very very big
[46:56] is going on here
[46:57] massive like it should throw our world
[46:59] into chaos wow there is something more
[47:02] to all this than than
[47:04] than what i can see
[47:05] how on earth could somebody possibly
[47:07] know the future when you think about
[47:08] that
[47:09] what is the future then what what are we
[47:11] in
[47:12] is this a movie
[47:14] is it a movie are we just playing it out
[47:19] how does all this work
[47:22] think about it this is
[47:23] this is massive
[47:25] like and even david
[47:27] and i don't think i've gone on for that
[47:28] long enough but
[47:31] what is what are we in friends what is
[47:33] this all
[47:34] this is not a natural according to this
[47:36] situation here this is not natural
[47:40] this is not an this is not natural
[47:42] there's something
[47:44] outstanding in existence here because
[47:47] somebody knows the future
[47:50] how can how can i fathom that lord in my
[47:52] mind how can somebody know the future
[47:54] when we have never been there yet and
[47:56] where does this whole thing exist then
[47:58] where is it all what what of all this
[48:00] that we're in
[48:02] we're a supernatural people
[48:03] we're living in a supernatural space
[48:06] we're not this is not natural then this
[48:08] is this is not just oh we don't know the
[48:10] future are you sure
[48:14] it's not what we think it is
[48:16] this is this is outstanding
[48:19] absolutely outstanding and david when he
[48:21] wrote in the psalms he said oh lord thou
[48:23] has searched me and known me thou
[48:25] knowest my down sitting am i not rising
[48:27] they understand this my thoughts are far
[48:29] off
[48:30] before they get to me you know what they
[48:31] are how is that possible
[48:35] that's outstanding
[48:37] now compass is my path am i lying down
[48:40] and i'd acquainted with all my ways for
[48:42] there is not a word in my tongue but lo
[48:44] oh lord thou knowest it all together
[48:47] before a word comes in my tongue you
[48:48] know what i'm going to speak
[48:53] thou has to set me behind and before and
[48:56] lay down hand upon me such knowledge is
[48:58] too wonderful for me that is too high i
[49:00] cannot attain unto it
[49:04] and you stop thinking
[49:05] this is too much for me to think about
[49:09] when you think about that notion of time
[49:11] though that somebody knows
[49:14] the future there then what exactly is
[49:16] this thing that we're in what is all
[49:17] this
[49:20] now if i give you see the mouth of two
[49:22] or three witnesses in a court if you
[49:24] bring forth a whole lot of witnesses
[49:26] then you have to acknowledge okay
[49:27] something's going on here if they all
[49:29] collaborate you know say the same thing
[49:32] these things
[49:33] should be out these are outstanding
[49:35] events that we should just go wow there
[49:37] is
[49:39] we are very supernatural friends but
[49:40] there's not a natural occurrence we are
[49:42] not if you think if we thought we were
[49:44] natural think again
[49:46] we're involved in this sort of stuff
[49:48] this is not natural we're very very
[49:50] supernatural we're all very spiritual
[49:52] people that's that's who we are
[49:55] don't let satan lie to you and say
[49:57] you're natural you're not
[49:59] no way friends you're very supernatural
[50:01] that's that's actually who we are
[50:03] and the more i'm living my life and just
[50:05] walking with the lord the more it's just
[50:06] becoming very very normal wow i'm just a
[50:08] supernatural person and i don't think
[50:11] normally
[50:13] you know half of my decisions are based
[50:14] on a feeling and it's not rational i
[50:16] don't weigh it up
[50:18] it's a feeling i just feel that to do
[50:20] that
[50:21] you say oh you shouldn't go on feelings
[50:22] well
[50:24] of course we have our thought you know
[50:25] is it right or wrong with that sort of
[50:27] stuff you know but i'm talking about
[50:28] whether you should do something or not
[50:29] like i go on how i feel why because i've
[50:32] got the holy ghost in me
[50:34] if it just feels natural i don't feel
[50:36] any sort of turmoil about the decision
[50:39] okay then we're all relaxed about it we
[50:41] can just carry on
[50:42] i just feel alright about it
[50:45] i know for a fact when something is
[50:46] wrong i feel like i just feel funny
[50:48] about it i don't
[50:49] why because there's something something
[50:51] in me is just
[50:52] saying don't go just don't go that way
[50:54] don't do that
[50:56] so don't do it i'm like i don't know why
[50:58] it seems like such a great thing it's
[50:59] everything's
[51:00] in line but i just don't want to do it
[51:03] why because i'm supernatural not just
[51:05] natural i don't just wad up naturally
[51:07] yes that ticks all the boxes then i go
[51:09] and do it that's not how we operate
[51:11] we don't do things like that
[51:13] we know someone that knows the future
[51:15] and he just knows that's not the right
[51:17] way so we just
[51:18] and it's not like a hard thing i'm not
[51:20] we don't have to be overly spiritual to
[51:22] do that we just have to be a christian
[51:24] because that's what that's our that's
[51:25] how we operate we we we just that's how
[51:28] our life is it's not we don't we're not
[51:30] governed by natural things we're
[51:31] governed by spiritual things that that's
[51:33] that's who we are
[51:34] so this one here these brothers are
[51:35] camping with brother brenham
[51:38] you guys will know the story i just like
[51:39] the picture on your left
[51:42] i just think it's amazing that a man's
[51:43] profile can be carved into a rock
[51:47] or that the word eagle could be written
[51:48] in a rock
[51:50] when was that written there how did
[51:52] those courts did they
[51:54] did god just write it in the order the
[51:55] courts just
[51:57] after the some volcanic activity did it
[51:59] just all sort of turn a certain way and
[52:02] did it form naturally or spiritually
[52:03] like
[52:04] the ten commandments the bible says god
[52:06] just wrote in the rock
[52:08] with his finger
[52:10] but was that did he right in the rock
[52:12] eagle with the quartz or did he
[52:14] did they just flow a certain way and
[52:16] then when the rock snapped off you know
[52:17] did it it broke in the right place
[52:22] why because we're all supernatural
[52:23] people this stuff just happens
[52:26] and they were camping these
[52:28] and then the whirlwind came in brother
[52:29] branham dived away and you know the
[52:31] story and he said
[52:33] and then he said to the brothers there
[52:35] judgment's going to strike the west
[52:36] coast
[52:38] so here's these here here are these
[52:40] christians
[52:41] and the prophet of god out in the
[52:43] camping
[52:46] something happens and then he says
[52:48] at some time in the future judgment is
[52:50] going to strike the west coast and he i
[52:51] think he throw a rock
[52:53] yeah
[52:57] now that was a supernatural event not
[52:58] normal like you'd think
[53:01] normal people natural people would say
[53:03] you guys are strange
[53:05] i think i'm done with this camping trip
[53:06] i'm out
[53:07] supernatural people think judgment is
[53:09] going to strike the west coast
[53:11] okay and then what happened
[53:14] yeah there was a massive earthquake and
[53:16] alaska tsunamis and that and judgment
[53:18] struck the west coast that's what
[53:20] happened
[53:22] that that
[53:24] that's an unusual situation how did he
[53:26] know yeah it was he a size what do they
[53:29] call a seismologist
[53:31] was he reading the graph so like you
[53:33] know the people try and predict
[53:34] earthquakes and they no one actually
[53:36] knows they say oh according to them it
[53:37] hasn't been one for 200 years so we're
[53:39] about two for one here and then what
[53:40] happens way over there they're like oh
[53:41] yeah well that one was kind of due
[53:44] nobody knows
[53:46] they're getting it right more and more
[53:47] and more though you know why because the
[53:50] bible says that these things would
[53:51] increase in the last days so they're
[53:52] like i told you there was going to be
[53:53] one well yeah no we told you
[53:57] because
[53:59] somehow or another the history it's
[54:01] already happened history has already
[54:03] been
[54:04] the future has already been for some i
[54:06] don't know how it works but it's already
[54:07] been
[54:08] it's already happened work that one out
[54:10] i can't work it out
[54:12] but somehow or another it's happened
[54:16] this one was another one
[54:19] this is slightly different but it's this
[54:20] this is this was i think it was the
[54:22] meeting in mexico where
[54:24] the
[54:25] ladies baby had died at nine o'clock in
[54:27] the morning and you can just picture
[54:28] this crowd i just wanted to give you the
[54:29] picture because you can imagine where in
[54:31] the back of the crowd somewhere there's
[54:32] a lady with a baby yeah wrestling
[54:35] through the crowd you know and you can
[54:36] you could see maybe this commotion
[54:38] weaving its way through the crowd and
[54:39] all the brothers are trying to stop this
[54:41] woman from
[54:42] getting up to the front you know and all
[54:44] the deacons are down there you know and
[54:46] then they're going up to brother adam
[54:47] and saying
[54:48] and there's this lady just she's really
[54:50] trying to get up here and we're trying
[54:51] to stop her and we we just can't
[54:53] manage to stop her
[54:55] and then you know there and brother
[54:57] branham
[54:59] because he's just naturally doing this
[55:00] thing he said oh just brother moore she
[55:02] doesn't really know me she doesn't know
[55:03] who we are you just go down there and
[55:04] she'll think you're me and just pray for
[55:06] her and you know like it probably
[55:08] happens all the time just because she
[55:10] wasn't in the prayer line he was
[55:11] managing the prayer line
[55:12] you know he
[55:14] he
[55:15] just doing what he always doesn't know
[55:17] you just go and quickly deal with it
[55:18] just pray for her
[55:20] and then
[55:22] he
[55:23] then brother brown saw a vision
[55:27] he saw sometime in the future a baby
[55:29] alive
[55:31] that's outstanding
[55:35] and this is a and then then he said hang
[55:37] on wait a minute bring the baby up to me
[55:40] then he prayed for the baby and this
[55:41] dead baby came back to life
[55:45] it was very supernatural this is not
[55:46] normal how many dead people just babies
[55:49] just come back to life
[55:50] generally speaking a baby dies you sign
[55:52] the death certificate which i think the
[55:54] doctor did
[55:55] sign the death certificate and then
[55:57] you notify the family the extended
[55:59] family you have the funeral and that's
[56:00] naturally what we do
[56:02] but in this occasion the baby came back
[56:04] to life and but before that there was a
[56:06] vision shown
[56:07] in the future this baby will be alive
[56:10] who knew who knew that like who knew
[56:12] with in the future that would be like
[56:13] that
[56:14] this
[56:15] this is mind-boggling now this is the
[56:17] last one i've got of this little
[56:18] sequence i don't know why i put this but
[56:19] i just found this interesting brother
[56:21] branham said i see a hood of death over
[56:24] that lady she's gonna die
[56:26] so someone took a photo and this was
[56:28] back before photoshop and there was a
[56:30] hood over the lady
[56:32] that's supernatural
[56:34] like
[56:34] this is quite normal this is actually
[56:36] normal stuff this is this is us this is
[56:38] what we deal in
[56:40] we deal in supernatural we're not
[56:42] natural
[56:46] so now this scripture here says and they
[56:48] went forth and preached everywhere
[56:50] the lord
[56:52] working with him and confirming the word
[56:54] with signs following
[56:57] you know why they did that
[56:58] because they were supernatural people
[56:59] just like us you know that's just what
[57:01] they did it was just a normal thing
[57:03] it's it's not a hard thing you know we
[57:07] we sometimes think the supernatural is a
[57:08] hard thing it's not a hard thing just
[57:10] relax just
[57:12] this is what we deal in this is how we
[57:13] operate we we don't we don't live see
[57:16] the problem the problem in this society
[57:20] the biggest problem that we have
[57:22] is scientific knowledge
[57:25] and an understanding of logic
[57:27] now
[57:28] brother branham was never against being
[57:31] um increasing your intellect to
[57:33] understand something when he when he
[57:35] spoke against education it was never
[57:37] that he didn't he liked educated people
[57:38] that would that could study about a
[57:40] certain subject and become
[57:43] enriched by it and also enrich other
[57:44] people's lives through their knowledge
[57:45] of that subject
[57:47] he was against logic
[57:50] putting limits and making
[57:53] spiritual people into natural people
[57:56] because that's what education can do if
[57:58] you study it
[58:00] let's say you study to be a doctor
[58:01] you're educated but
[58:03] this is what you will come out with
[58:04] say
[58:06] i have this injury or you tell this
[58:08] person you have this into your condition
[58:09] and
[58:10] it will only get fixed naturally to a
[58:11] certain point then after that nothing
[58:13] can be done in a
[58:15] let's say
[58:17] you've got one leg
[58:19] and the other your other leg's gone you
[58:20] know
[58:21] we can make your prosthetic leg or do
[58:23] something but
[58:24] your leg will technically never grow
[58:26] back
[58:26] it's not possible for the cells to join
[58:28] and everything and to create another leg
[58:29] if you had a little
[58:31] scratch maybe that will grow you that
[58:32] could be healed but your leg could never
[58:34] be healed or you may have a
[58:36] some sort of mental condition or some
[58:38] other condition you know this is the
[58:40] truth and they tell you this
[58:41] you cannot be
[58:44] healed past a certain point like
[58:46] because it's scientific it's a fact
[58:49] now
[58:51] you understand this that we've got to
[58:53] get away from this because it's not a
[58:55] fact
[58:56] you see it's not actually a fact but
[58:58] this is what brother brown was against
[59:00] in this society we get taught so much
[59:02] logic that we now take this as fact like
[59:06] and it it hinders us from we we then
[59:10] the satan tries to make us natural
[59:12] people he tries to make us natural
[59:15] we don't think like this
[59:18] we don't think like this like
[59:20] what would we say we say i've got this
[59:21] injury but i but i can just be
[59:23] healed completely of it no problem at
[59:25] all there's no it's no problem it's not
[59:27] a big deal see we've got to we're
[59:29] because we're a supernatural people
[59:33] you believe that that's
[59:34] that this is who we are we're not
[59:36] natural we don't we don't believe this
[59:39] we don't we don't we're not natural now
[59:42] if we were supernatural how would we
[59:43] think
[59:46] oh this i tell you why i think this this
[59:51] that's not me
[59:54] and my three two wayward brothers and
[59:55] our friend she's actually got one leg
[59:57] that girl always had one leg uh
[1:00:01] still friends with her actually today um
[1:00:03] this is me back when i was
[1:00:05] not doing what i should be doing
[1:00:08] but the reason why i gave you this is
[1:00:09] because in this situation here something
[1:00:11] happened to me when i was like look like
[1:00:12] this you know god
[1:00:15] god's big bigger than all this that we
[1:00:17] that we see
[1:00:19] i shouldn't say this but
[1:00:22] my brother won't mind me saying he was a
[1:00:24] he was a bad influence on me my older
[1:00:25] brother he's a good guy now
[1:00:27] he was i never wanted to do dumb things
[1:00:29] but he always was and he wouldn't drag
[1:00:31] me into it
[1:00:33] i was never into it he just i never said
[1:00:35] let's go and do this he always would do
[1:00:36] the dumb stuff and drag me in so
[1:00:38] after a while i said not doing it but
[1:00:40] anyway
[1:00:42] he got me into
[1:00:45] smoking different things
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:48] i tell you this for a story because i
[1:00:50] you wonder you think
[1:00:52] you wonder why i think this is not a
[1:00:53] natural occurrence i've had things
[1:00:55] happen to me where i think okay this is
[1:00:56] definitely not natural you can't you
[1:00:58] couldn't tell me that i'm i'm that
[1:01:00] there's nothing else here so
[1:01:03] we got
[1:01:07] okay we so he got all this marijuana and
[1:01:10] he was smoking it all day and i was
[1:01:11] about 14 or 15 whenever i was 16 he was
[1:01:13] giving it to me all day
[1:01:15] and then by the evening he said i'll do
[1:01:17] one more and i was
[1:01:19] done and he was like let's do one more
[1:01:21] like oh okay and then we went to bed and
[1:01:24] and
[1:01:25] it was strange because inside my body it
[1:01:28] felt like it was shaking my arm was
[1:01:29] still but inside was shaking
[1:01:31] funny you know i would sit down it would
[1:01:33] go inside me
[1:01:36] it's the strangest thing any sort of
[1:01:37] drug never worked for me i just never
[1:01:39] the lord kept me from a lot of stuff
[1:01:41] because i'd never enjoyed any of it ever
[1:01:43] and it would shake him and i was laying
[1:01:45] in bed not knowing what to do and then
[1:01:46] so i woke up my brother i said man i'm
[1:01:48] like
[1:01:49] and so my body's shaking it's going all
[1:01:50] funny
[1:01:52] and we tried all sorts of different
[1:01:54] things
[1:01:55] i tried running on the spot you know to
[1:01:56] try and get out of it and then that
[1:01:58] didn't work we tried all sorts of
[1:02:00] other things in the room we used to live
[1:02:01] outside in this little batch
[1:02:04] outside behind the house
[1:02:06] so it's about midnight to 11 o'clock and
[1:02:08] i was like maybe try hosing me down with
[1:02:10] some water
[1:02:12] so
[1:02:13] so he's got this hose you know and he's
[1:02:16] outside hosing me down with this water
[1:02:17] to try and snap me out of the this thing
[1:02:19] that i was in
[1:02:21] worked for about 30 seconds and then i
[1:02:22] just got cold and shaking so i was
[1:02:24] shaking on the outside and the inside
[1:02:26] after that
[1:02:27] and and
[1:02:28] nothing worked you know
[1:02:31] and we went back around to outside of
[1:02:32] the
[1:02:33] little batch outside
[1:02:36] then i said to my brother bro let's pray
[1:02:39] and i put my arms around him
[1:02:41] looking like this you know he probably
[1:02:42] looked like that i put my arms around
[1:02:43] him
[1:02:44] and i may have told this before but this
[1:02:46] was the strangest thing i started
[1:02:47] praying for a friend that we used to
[1:02:48] hang out with you know pray for chris
[1:02:50] fowle and i felt
[1:02:51] this love in my heart for this guy chris
[1:02:54] it's the strangest thing
[1:02:57] thought but i just really love this guy
[1:02:59] lord just help my friend chris i think i
[1:03:02] prayed for two people then him
[1:03:04] not even thinking about the
[1:03:06] the shaking situation right and then
[1:03:08] and then
[1:03:09] in an instant something went from our
[1:03:11] head to our feet and went
[1:03:13] like that and we were completely sober
[1:03:15] both of us come completely straight like
[1:03:18] and we you can imagine we're sort of
[1:03:20] arms around each other and then because
[1:03:21] i i put my arms around him when i was
[1:03:22] praying and then when it happened we
[1:03:23] went
[1:03:25] and we both looked at each other and he
[1:03:26] said i said are you straight he said are
[1:03:30] and
[1:03:32] and we were instantaneously
[1:03:34] right
[1:03:36] you can't tell me this is a natural
[1:03:37] world that we live in
[1:03:39] because i go through those situations
[1:03:41] and i think okay say whatever you want
[1:03:43] to say
[1:03:44] tell me that
[1:03:45] they tell me all these impossibilities
[1:03:48] i experience that
[1:03:51] you can't convince me of it i didn't
[1:03:52] hear a story from somebody i i went
[1:03:56] something my whole brain this all of
[1:03:57] these chemicals got taken out of my body
[1:03:59] in an instant they just went gone and i
[1:04:01] was completely sober
[1:04:03] you there is more to life than that
[1:04:06] we're supernatural people we're not just
[1:04:08] we're not natural
[1:04:10] like this sort of stuff no human knows
[1:04:12] what will happen tomorrow who's told you
[1:04:13] that before
[1:04:15] that's not true amen that's not true
[1:04:18] whoever told you this is telling you a
[1:04:19] lie
[1:04:21] many
[1:04:22] see christians know what's going to
[1:04:23] happen tomorrow
[1:04:25] we we know what's we can easily be told
[1:04:27] what's happened tomorrow
[1:04:29] and we think of it as like a big
[1:04:32] god can pull out tomorrow like he can
[1:04:33] yesterday
[1:04:35] it's all just laying there it's not like
[1:04:36] oh you want to know tomorrow oh it's
[1:04:38] gonna be quite hard it's all land there
[1:04:40] just like see we can pick out the past
[1:04:42] very easily
[1:04:44] the future is no harder than the past
[1:04:46] it's all laying there
[1:04:47] it's just this blockage we have that oh
[1:04:49] no we don't know
[1:04:51] you know
[1:04:53] think about it it's it's all laying
[1:04:54] there it's not like it's hard to get
[1:04:56] it's like not like god's only got access
[1:04:57] to i or you've got two more not to make
[1:05:00] a light of it but you know like it has
[1:05:02] to all just be laying there
[1:05:04] it's all just laying there it's that the
[1:05:06] future in the past are all just as easy
[1:05:08] to access
[1:05:11] to god now to a supernatural being why
[1:05:14] not to us that's that's what
[1:05:16] that's that's the sort of people that we
[1:05:18] are we it's not this thing that we can't
[1:05:20] attain to it's only because we get told
[1:05:22] no one knows actually i can be told
[1:05:24] when's the next lockdown i could just
[1:05:25] ask god
[1:05:26] guys there's going to be a lockdown on
[1:05:28] the 28th of october so if you're
[1:05:30] planning on doing anything
[1:05:31] i'll probably borrow your stuff first if
[1:05:33] you want to do jobs at home because
[1:05:34] we're being locked down on 28th you know
[1:05:36] get to the shops by it all because
[1:05:37] you'll be you're going to be down for a
[1:05:39] month right and then locked in happens
[1:05:41] on the 28th
[1:05:42] well no that's how we operate
[1:05:45] we don't have to
[1:05:47] that's super that's that's normal for us
[1:05:49] you know
[1:05:51] that's why i read you the scripture at
[1:05:52] the start you know someone
[1:05:54] we can say we've got all these things
[1:05:56] which is nice but you know we're a
[1:05:57] supernatural people people get affected
[1:05:59] by the supernatural like that thing that
[1:06:01] happened to me it affected me you could
[1:06:03] tell me uh you could
[1:06:05] tell me a lot of things but just have
[1:06:07] that one occurrence happen to me and i'm
[1:06:09] convinced there's something else out
[1:06:10] there that's bigger than me
[1:06:12] you know
[1:06:13] that's why they said if you have an
[1:06:14] unbeliever come to a church and you're
[1:06:16] all speaking in tongues and he's going
[1:06:17] to think these guys are quite strange i
[1:06:18] don't know what's going on here and i
[1:06:20] don't believe i'll come back
[1:06:21] but you have someone prophesied of that
[1:06:23] person and say yeah you're so-and-so and
[1:06:25] you come from here and maybe
[1:06:27] and you you you in your car you've got
[1:06:28] this sitting in your car
[1:06:31] he knows no you've got this sitting in
[1:06:32] your glove box and you just bought it
[1:06:34] from the shop this morning you put in
[1:06:35] your glove box
[1:06:37] that man is going to say okay
[1:06:38] something's going on here
[1:06:41] he's going to go to work the next thing
[1:06:42] say guys you might think i'm strange and
[1:06:45] i usually never talk about this but i
[1:06:46] went to the church yesterday and they
[1:06:48] told me all the stuff that they knew
[1:06:49] nothing of this is strange he's not
[1:06:51] going to be ashamed like where'd you
[1:06:52] guys say oh just
[1:06:53] you know
[1:06:55] he's going to be like look say what you
[1:06:56] want
[1:06:58] that
[1:06:58] was you know you use this world to tell
[1:07:01] that was out there man whatever but
[1:07:03] it's going to affect him
[1:07:05] and he's going to say god's there
[1:07:06] something's going on there there's some
[1:07:08] there's something lurking in their midst
[1:07:10] as soon as they're looking but there's
[1:07:11] something in their midst that's that's
[1:07:13] just beyond all this they're not just a
[1:07:15] bunch of people walking around and
[1:07:16] singing a few songs somebody else is
[1:07:18] there that i didn't see but they told me
[1:07:20] stuff and they told me the secrets of my
[1:07:23] heart and it says they will bow down and
[1:07:25] worship god and think god is here
[1:07:27] that's what we have that's us
[1:07:30] that's what people will encounter when
[1:07:31] they come here because we are a
[1:07:32] supernatural people we can tell them hey
[1:07:35] just be careful this week on wednesday
[1:07:36] when you go to that job you're going to
[1:07:37] see this person here that accents them
[1:07:39] just be careful oh really
[1:07:41] wednesday that week there's an accident
[1:07:42] that happens well lucky i was standing
[1:07:44] back because i was on the lookout
[1:07:46] how did they know well that's actually
[1:07:48] what we do
[1:07:49] this is god
[1:07:51] we're a supernatural people we
[1:07:53] we don't believe this
[1:07:54] you understand we're not
[1:07:56] this is not true just like
[1:07:58] a leg can't grow back that's not
[1:07:59] actually true
[1:08:01] don't believe that that's not true
[1:08:04] we know it can happen tomorrow and and
[1:08:06] we can know somebody's passed way way
[1:08:08] that down that they know nothing of we
[1:08:10] can tell them what it is
[1:08:11] that's the god that that's that's
[1:08:15] and that's not just limited to a few
[1:08:16] people paul said covet to prophesy i
[1:08:18] would that you all would prophesy
[1:08:19] that all of you will prophesy
[1:08:22] i would that you all would not just a
[1:08:23] few of you that you all would
[1:08:25] and i'll read that scripture shortly
[1:08:28] you can't see that that's a possum on a
[1:08:30] road it's night time
[1:08:33] i'll tell you another story this is i
[1:08:34] just want to tell you a few of these you
[1:08:38] so i'm driving from tauranga to gisborne
[1:08:41] it's late at night eleven or twelve
[1:08:43] o'clock
[1:08:44] and i'm heading into the gorge i don't
[1:08:46] know if you know gizmo you gotta go into
[1:08:48] this deep dark gorge you know and then
[1:08:49] you get out the other side and you're in
[1:08:50] gizmo and you're there for another three
[1:08:52] years before you leave again
[1:08:53] because no one wants to go through the
[1:08:55] gorge or the other way is another gorge
[1:08:56] so
[1:08:57] you never
[1:08:58] when you come out the other way from the
[1:09:00] from gizmo on the other side when you go
[1:09:01] out to the gorge and into um opportunity
[1:09:04] you kind of get out to the open you're
[1:09:05] like wow the world you know the feeling
[1:09:07] wow
[1:09:08] it exists you know
[1:09:11] but so i'm driving back
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:15] i'm starting to feel real funny i'm like
[1:09:17] i'm just i'm feeling strange something
[1:09:19] in me is
[1:09:20] swirling up i'm thinking maybe it's
[1:09:21] because i'm tired but i'm thinking now
[1:09:22] i'm feeling really funny about something
[1:09:25] and then something starts saying okay
[1:09:26] there's going to be someone on the side
[1:09:27] of the road you've got to stop and
[1:09:30] when you see them on the side of the
[1:09:31] road you've got to stop this is about 12
[1:09:32] 30 1 o'clock midnight
[1:09:34] and
[1:09:35] you know we've got the my wife's in the
[1:09:37] car and little children in that and it's
[1:09:38] kind of raining
[1:09:39] and i'm thinking to myself if i see
[1:09:41] anyone i'm not stopping like i'm just
[1:09:43] carrying on man i'm going to stop
[1:09:45] and then i'm just thinking and then i'm
[1:09:46] driving along and i think okay lord i
[1:09:48] just feel strange about this if this is
[1:09:49] you then round one of these corners have
[1:09:51] a possum come on the road
[1:09:53] because and if you know possums when
[1:09:55] it's raining they don't really go out
[1:09:56] they stay in the trees you know so went
[1:09:58] around the corner and there was a possum
[1:10:00] on the road to quickly swerve to not get
[1:10:02] it i think i may have told this before
[1:10:03] but
[1:10:04] i just want to let you know this because
[1:10:05] we're we're not natural people this was
[1:10:08] so i drive a bit further and then i see
[1:10:10] uh hazard lights on the right in this
[1:10:12] car park area
[1:10:14] somebody says stop stop i'm like man i'm
[1:10:16] not stopping
[1:10:17] no
[1:10:19] no
[1:10:21] this is it's late i'm probably just
[1:10:22] thinking that the possum may have been a
[1:10:23] fluke i'm just going to carry on
[1:10:26] right so i'll carry on
[1:10:28] i'll carry on and then and then we get
[1:10:30] to work the next morning and i and we i
[1:10:33] go oh we um
[1:10:34] just you guys that this young christian
[1:10:36] guy started working for us i'm like oh
[1:10:38] here's so-and-so
[1:10:39] where is he's not at work this morning
[1:10:41] because it was a sunday right and this
[1:10:42] is a monday morning
[1:10:43] and my other mate was like oh no he um
[1:10:45] he was driving back from tauranga late
[1:10:47] last night and they broke down in the
[1:10:48] gorge and he was on the side of the road
[1:10:49] so they had to stay the night there
[1:10:52] it was him
[1:10:55] like
[1:10:57] oh really
[1:11:00] the person the lord said stop i'm not
[1:11:01] gonna jump come in the car drive you
[1:11:03] back to gizzy but i carried on but
[1:11:06] you go through those situations you
[1:11:07] think okay there's something more to
[1:11:08] this than what we can see this is not
[1:11:10] this is not normal you know we're not a
[1:11:12] normal people this is another one i had
[1:11:14] this trailer in this concrete mixer once
[1:11:16] and it was late at night and i really
[1:11:17] needed some money gizzy as well and i
[1:11:20] was like right i'm going to advertise
[1:11:21] both of them
[1:11:23] i've advertised them on the local buy
[1:11:24] sale exchange and then somebody said to
[1:11:27] me sell the concrete don't sell the
[1:11:28] trailer
[1:11:30] strange but and then it was about 11
[1:11:32] o'clock at night and someone texts me
[1:11:33] about the trailer or rung me or who rung
[1:11:35] me i think he rings at 11 o'clock at
[1:11:36] night i didn't think nothing of it oh
[1:11:38] yeah yeah okay and i arranged to meet
[1:11:40] this guy that run me 11 o'clock at night
[1:11:41] with the trailer the next day but all
[1:11:43] along i think you don't sell the trailer
[1:11:46] then
[1:11:47] then i was
[1:11:48] even when i was getting the trailer on
[1:11:49] in the morning i pulled around and
[1:11:51] smashed the light on i was like oh man i
[1:11:53] probably shouldn't be selling this
[1:11:54] trailer anyway
[1:11:55] and and i went drove all the way to town
[1:11:57] to meet this guy no one turned up at the
[1:11:58] location i'm like this is a waste of
[1:12:00] time the guy wasn't even there
[1:12:02] so i drove back
[1:12:04] it turned out i actually bought a stolen
[1:12:05] trailer
[1:12:07] and because it was all painted right and
[1:12:08] then i actually just think about now i
[1:12:10] actually got it back to the right for
[1:12:11] loner later on so
[1:12:13] the lord had me give it back to him but
[1:12:14] then
[1:12:15] i was like okay that and then the next
[1:12:17] day i put a silly price on this concrete
[1:12:19] mixer and then these guys just turned up
[1:12:22] out of the blue i kind of come get the
[1:12:23] mixer they run on a saturday morning
[1:12:24] this is i think a few days later they
[1:12:26] didn't even look at it they're like oh
[1:12:27] here's the cash where's the mixer
[1:12:29] you know and they took it away i'm like
[1:12:32] okay because god says sell the mixer
[1:12:34] keep the trailer like that's how we
[1:12:37] operate that's quite normal you know
[1:12:39] these are this is how we do things we
[1:12:42] we we don't weigh it up all this is
[1:12:43] worth this much trailers worth that much
[1:12:45] if i probably sell this and that maybe
[1:12:46] that could use that you know we don't do
[1:12:48] it like that we just we're supernatural
[1:12:50] we just get told what to do we just
[1:12:52] you know that's how we operate with this
[1:12:54] and this is
[1:12:55] this is quite normal i'm just going to
[1:12:57] tell you this
[1:12:59] this is not my story but i know i
[1:13:00] couldn't find the story but i know i'm
[1:13:02] pretty convinced it's a true story i may
[1:13:03] have even told it here but i like the
[1:13:04] story
[1:13:05] a man is praying for a bible
[1:13:07] lord
[1:13:10] i want a bible but i need some money
[1:13:12] because he was a bible salesman this is
[1:13:13] in the 1800s the bible salesman going
[1:13:15] around this man says lord i really want
[1:13:16] a bible i think he may have heard a
[1:13:18] knock on the door or whatever might have
[1:13:20] happened and there was a coin
[1:13:23] he went outside no one was there and
[1:13:24] there was a coin on his
[1:13:25] doorstep
[1:13:28] and
[1:13:29] he knew the bible salesman was coming
[1:13:31] past and that was enough to buy himself
[1:13:32] a bible so he didn't know who it was but
[1:13:34] he maybe thought his neighbor dropped
[1:13:35] him off dropped it off to be nice
[1:13:37] and so the bible salesman comes to his
[1:13:39] house
[1:13:41] and
[1:13:42] the guy says praise the lord i was you
[1:13:44] know
[1:13:45] knew you were coming and i actually he's
[1:13:47] a
[1:13:47] dollar for the your bible
[1:13:49] you know and then he gave him the bible
[1:13:51] and the
[1:13:51] the bible salesman said i was the same
[1:13:53] dollar because it was his dollar because
[1:13:55] i gave this dollar to the boat man down
[1:13:57] there when i came across the river
[1:14:00] and the guy said to him
[1:14:01] what boat then
[1:14:03] there's no boat man there sure
[1:14:05] well i said i got a cross i gave it to
[1:14:06] this boat man and i gave him this dollar
[1:14:09] see
[1:14:10] where was the boat from who who brought
[1:14:12] him across right
[1:14:14] probably the boat got created and there
[1:14:16] was an angel just brought him across
[1:14:17] got the dollar put it on his step
[1:14:20] carried on
[1:14:21] just another day in god's office that's
[1:14:23] how and in the christian's office that's
[1:14:24] how
[1:14:26] that's how we work
[1:14:29] i got this picture here because
[1:14:34] you know
[1:14:36] i won't talk about this but here for
[1:14:38] long and i'm just gonna almost done but
[1:14:39] i just
[1:14:41] if something
[1:14:42] let's say a man's leg this man here has
[1:14:44] got no leg right
[1:14:47] this that grows back someone prays for
[1:14:48] him his leg grows back and you've got
[1:14:50] this before and after photo right
[1:14:53] that should be enough to make the whole
[1:14:54] world stop in their tracks
[1:14:56] every news media in the world put it up
[1:14:59] and say look people
[1:15:02] it should make great men of the world
[1:15:05] stop what they're doing
[1:15:07] look into this scientist everyone and
[1:15:09] say
[1:15:10] what's going on here
[1:15:12] tell me what's going on
[1:15:14] like
[1:15:15] how did this person's leg grow back can
[1:15:17] anybody here tell me
[1:15:19] get
[1:15:20] give me bring me all your knowledge
[1:15:22] bring me everything how did here's a
[1:15:24] photo of before and after he's no leg
[1:15:25] here's a leg i want someone like men
[1:15:27] that are in charge of running the world
[1:15:29] should say i want some answers about
[1:15:30] what's going on here something's going
[1:15:32] on here
[1:15:34] you understand like this is like
[1:15:36] they should say this is
[1:15:38] we can't just carry on living what's
[1:15:40] going on here
[1:15:41] like
[1:15:42] we can't just pretend there's something
[1:15:44] unusual happen here could you explain to
[1:15:47] me what happened
[1:15:48] all the doctors everyone would say
[1:15:50] uh we've actually got no idea how this
[1:15:52] this is not possible you say okay well
[1:15:54] then that's one thing we got this is not
[1:15:56] possible because it happened so what do
[1:15:57] we do with that information then
[1:16:00] who does the impossible
[1:16:02] you know
[1:16:04] one miracle should convict the whole
[1:16:05] world they should be like wow we we need
[1:16:07] to actually find out who did this
[1:16:10] what the like the pharisees you know
[1:16:15] they were arguing with he should have
[1:16:16] been healed on the sabbath day
[1:16:20] pinch yourself somebody just
[1:16:22] a blind man could now see
[1:16:24] but you know the bible said they could
[1:16:26] do nothing they could say nothing
[1:16:27] because the man was standing in the
[1:16:28] emergency of blind man he was hey guys
[1:16:30] uh all you're fussing i can actually see
[1:16:36] you're missing the point i can see
[1:16:40] but
[1:16:43] this should make the whole humanity the
[1:16:45] whole of humanity stop in their tracks
[1:16:47] and say what is going on here
[1:16:50] really when you think about it like
[1:16:52] this this this should be the most like a
[1:16:55] human body part growing back should be
[1:16:57] the most outstanding event in the
[1:16:58] history of mankind
[1:17:00] forget about some sort of thing we can
[1:17:02] make and do and send the satellite up we
[1:17:03] we know how to do that we've done it all
[1:17:05] and we've worked it out scientifically
[1:17:07] worked out this one yeah it's incredible
[1:17:13] i'm just going to close with these few
[1:17:14] scriptures and this is the one that i
[1:17:16] read at the start but just now now
[1:17:18] thinking about it with the way that we
[1:17:19] are
[1:17:20] if therefore the whole church become
[1:17:22] together in one place and all speak with
[1:17:24] tongues and they come and those that are
[1:17:25] unlearned or unbelievers will they not
[1:17:27] say that ye are mad but a full prophesy
[1:17:29] all or actually all
[1:17:32] don't
[1:17:33] don't limit yourself if all
[1:17:37] all
[1:17:38] everybody we're all supernatural they
[1:17:40] think oh no i'm just quite natural no
[1:17:42] you're not fact check you're not natural
[1:17:45] amen you're not you're supernatural you
[1:17:47] don't
[1:17:49] you believe in what i just told you
[1:17:51] you're very supernatural you're strange
[1:17:53] you know
[1:17:54] hey bring it on i enjoy this like
[1:17:56] brother braham said leave me alone i
[1:17:57] feel happy this way you know
[1:17:59] that's that's what we are
[1:18:01] but you see strange makes a difference
[1:18:03] supernatural makes a difference
[1:18:05] because we keep on reading but if all
[1:18:06] prophesy
[1:18:08] all prophesy
[1:18:09] and you come in one that believeth not
[1:18:11] or one unlearned
[1:18:13] it could be well educated but he's
[1:18:14] unlearned
[1:18:16] scientist but unlearned that actually no
[1:18:18] no all you're learning
[1:18:20] you're bound there's actually a
[1:18:21] supernatural god out there
[1:18:24] he is convinced of all
[1:18:26] because you see once he experiences that
[1:18:28] you're gonna
[1:18:30] argue him out of it they knew what was
[1:18:32] in my glove box of my car and nobody
[1:18:34] else did
[1:18:36] he'll never be unconvinced of that
[1:18:38] argument ever in his entire life he'll
[1:18:40] go to the grave thinking something
[1:18:41] happened in that little church i went to
[1:18:44] something told that that wasn't normal
[1:18:48] you could have told him many things
[1:18:49] he'll argue reason them away but he'll
[1:18:51] never he or she will never ever reason
[1:18:53] that away their entire life
[1:18:56] he is convinced of all he is judgeable
[1:18:57] and thus are the secrets of his heart
[1:18:59] made manifest and so falling down on his
[1:19:01] face he will worship god and report that
[1:19:04] god is in you of truth
[1:19:07] god was there
[1:19:08] what did you do on the weekend i went to
[1:19:09] church with one of my friends and god
[1:19:11] was there amen
[1:19:16] closing scripture wherefore brethren
[1:19:17] covet to prophesy and forbid not to
[1:19:19] speak with tongues let all things be
[1:19:21] done decently and in order
[1:19:24] and i just want to close with this last
[1:19:25] thought now
[1:19:26] that was the last slide
[1:19:30] and i don't know where this thought came
[1:19:31] from but maybe it's i won't labor on it
[1:19:33] too long but you know
[1:19:35] we sometimes think that we are sort of
[1:19:36] moved on from all this stuff you know
[1:19:39] i don't know in my mind i've never been
[1:19:41] able to rationalize that i'm like
[1:19:43] why
[1:19:44] it would be like saying you know you've
[1:19:46] got this fantastic car in the garage you
[1:19:47] know like it's the most awesome car
[1:19:49] you've ever had
[1:19:50] and you say
[1:19:52] i'm just going to go to the shop
[1:19:54] so you're going to take the car no i
[1:19:55] think i'll walk
[1:19:57] how far is it how about 10ks oh well do
[1:19:59] you like walking no
[1:20:02] but you know i'll walk
[1:20:04] why you've got this thing parked in your
[1:20:06] garage like
[1:20:09] you're gonna walk like we've got all
[1:20:11] this stuff we're a supernatural people
[1:20:13] you think we're gonna oh no i wouldn't
[1:20:14] know about that dang i got this car here
[1:20:16] man i'm not gonna leave that parked in
[1:20:19] the garage
[1:20:20] we we we
[1:20:22] in god as a bride we move we just
[1:20:25] we move on we keep the car and we go
[1:20:26] further more places you know
[1:20:28] we we don't
[1:20:30] this this stuff convinces people's
[1:20:32] hearts they come in and say they say god
[1:20:34] was there
[1:20:35] whereas there are supernatural people
[1:20:37] there's something going on in that
[1:20:38] fellowship god was there
[1:20:40] and this is not just fellowship this is
[1:20:42] the way you live your life too like
[1:20:44] you know what's going to happen tomorrow
[1:20:46] you know the season you're in
[1:20:48] you know the way your life's going you
[1:20:50] know the promises and you know how it's
[1:20:51] going to happen sister hannah you knew
[1:20:53] what was going to happen with your visa
[1:20:56] you knew it
[1:20:57] you weren't hoping it you knew it
[1:20:58] because somewhere along the line god
[1:21:00] told you you're going to get your visa
[1:21:02] that's what happened it wasn't like oh i
[1:21:04] wasn't sure about that that was a bit
[1:21:05] dicey
[1:21:06] you knew you were going to get your visa
[1:21:08] because god told you you're going to get
[1:21:09] your visa that's why you just did all
[1:21:11] the things you needed to do
[1:21:13] you don't just walk along not knowing
[1:21:14] what the future's going to be you know
[1:21:16] the future you know the promises and you
[1:21:17] can watch them come to pass in your life
[1:21:20] that that's how
[1:21:21] that's what you are that's what everyone
[1:21:23] in here is you're not
[1:21:24] you you don't just live and not know
[1:21:26] anything that's going on you know you
[1:21:28] know it all
[1:21:29] and the more you accept that the more
[1:21:30] you can just start to live like that and
[1:21:32] say well i just yeah i understand all
[1:21:33] this i know this i just said oh
[1:21:37] it's like
[1:21:38] i had
[1:21:42] little davey no goes through his little
[1:21:43] seasons
[1:21:46] and he i think he may have just turned
[1:21:47] 17 and i just got this thing to say you
[1:21:49] know and his because he was sort of in
[1:21:51] his brain he was going along with all
[1:21:52] these lies and that hitting heading in a
[1:21:54] certain direction
[1:21:55] and i said your 17th year
[1:21:57] all those things are going to be
[1:21:58] uncovered satan's going to all the
[1:22:00] god's going to uncover all those little
[1:22:02] lies that have been plaguing that have
[1:22:03] been leading you in that way god's going
[1:22:05] to start to undo all those
[1:22:07] and then the 18th year is going to be
[1:22:09] different it's your 17th year that's
[1:22:11] what it's going to all slowly be undone
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] and i told him he thought i was crazy
[1:22:18] that's what's going to happen
[1:22:20] 17th year and
[1:22:22] he might be watching
[1:22:24] almost
[1:22:26] and he was
[1:22:27] about a week ago
[1:22:31] i kind of
[1:22:32] feud i was like man
[1:22:35] his 18th birthday is coming
[1:22:36] up and you know we don't want to get to
[1:22:39] doubting but sometimes we just you know
[1:22:41] watch out when you get tired or
[1:22:42] something you know you know that when
[1:22:43] you get be careful of those things when
[1:22:45] you get tired when you get worn and when
[1:22:47] you get physically worn
[1:22:48] and brother brandon even said that's
[1:22:50] when satan comes in when you get like
[1:22:51] that just relax don't do anything don't
[1:22:52] think about nothing just maybe go to
[1:22:54] sleep or don't don't dwell on things
[1:22:56] because
[1:22:57] you'll then
[1:22:59] in a weakened mental state you'll then
[1:23:00] maybe slip into a bit of a moan and then
[1:23:02] when you do that same song ah so you
[1:23:04] didn't really believe after all i just
[1:23:05] say no i do i was just tired
[1:23:11] yeah yeah and then
[1:23:13] then i write a song
[1:23:15] you might have heard me say that but
[1:23:16] this is really what i think
[1:23:18] i write as song to the opposite and i
[1:23:20] said this is my confession
[1:23:22] um
[1:23:23] it was coming up and
[1:23:25] and i was getting it down i was like
[1:23:26] lord you know i know that's what's going
[1:23:28] to happen because that's the business
[1:23:29] we're in right we know what the future's
[1:23:31] going to be we just
[1:23:32] we just know what it's going to be like
[1:23:34] we know how it's going to end up we
[1:23:35] we're not walking in darkness we're
[1:23:36] walking in light
[1:23:38] and and god can tell us what's going to
[1:23:40] happen tomorrow the next week or season
[1:23:42] that's how we operate that's that's how
[1:23:43] life works for us
[1:23:45] that is just very normal this is not
[1:23:47] like this is not new stuff for us this
[1:23:49] is normal
[1:23:50] and
[1:23:52] and and
[1:23:54] i was like well i just i just want to
[1:23:56] see i just want like i know that was
[1:23:58] what you were going to do and he was
[1:23:59] almost about 10 18 i'm like i've seen a
[1:24:01] lot of things you know
[1:24:03] and then
[1:24:06] i'd ask them if you wanted to work for
[1:24:07] us again different bits and pieces over
[1:24:08] time it was always
[1:24:10] doing this doing that
[1:24:11] and then
[1:24:12] i was like i just randomly thought i'll
[1:24:14] send them this text out of the blue do
[1:24:16] you want to why don't you
[1:24:18] work
[1:24:19] for us and move live at home
[1:24:22] you send me a text back and maybe i will
[1:24:25] and i just say this because
[1:24:27] the day before on his last day of his
[1:24:29] 17th year he moved back home so when you
[1:24:32] woke up on his 18th birthday he's living
[1:24:34] at home
[1:24:35] and um
[1:24:36] i'm thinking to myself okay this this is
[1:24:38] i think this is a different season now i
[1:24:40] believe this is a different season what
[1:24:42] are the odds you know
[1:24:43] like
[1:24:45] and then it's going to go another way
[1:24:47] it's not going to be an easy you know
[1:24:48] the the lord's working but i think
[1:24:51] i look back i look i think there's
[1:24:53] something in there i didn't plan it that
[1:24:54] way i didn't really think it was as i
[1:24:56] knew it was his birthday but i didn't
[1:24:57] plan anything like that i just sent him
[1:24:58] any and so
[1:25:00] it felt like okay the first day he wakes
[1:25:02] up on his 18th birthday he's back home
[1:25:04] and now i can start to
[1:25:06] but
[1:25:08] that that it wasn't really a surprise
[1:25:10] because i was like no something it's
[1:25:11] going to be different somehow that was
[1:25:12] the 70th year then the 18th year is
[1:25:14] going to be different
[1:25:15] and then when you wake up on the 18th
[1:25:17] the first day of the 18th year and you
[1:25:18] think okay that guy's in the room there
[1:25:19] this is different he wants to work again
[1:25:21] this is different
[1:25:22] but that's how we operate
[1:25:24] that's how we that's how we as
[1:25:26] christians
[1:25:28] that's just another day for us
[1:25:30] it's another day for you we're all just
[1:25:32] very supernatural
[1:25:34] if you think you're natural never think
[1:25:35] that again
[1:25:37] go on your feelings
[1:25:38] oh no i should go on feelings now go on
[1:25:40] your feelings i shouldn't say that too
[1:25:41] loud because you've got to have a bit of
[1:25:43] temperance with it but
[1:25:45] try it you know try it
[1:25:48] this is this is the god we serve you can
[1:25:50] just
[1:25:51] hear him hear his voice speak to you and
[1:25:54] and he can tell you things
[1:25:56] and he knows the future just like he
[1:25:57] knows the past it's not a big deal here
[1:25:59] you want to know what's going on lord
[1:26:00] what's going to happen here he can tell
[1:26:01] you what's going to happen there
[1:26:04] just like you can tell the past he can
[1:26:06] tell the future
[1:26:08] sister jenny knows the future that's why
[1:26:10] she sings these songs
[1:26:12] because that's the future she says it's
[1:26:13] all going to be all right because she
[1:26:14] knows that it's going to be right she
[1:26:16] knows this is why it's all going to work
[1:26:18] out and it'll work out as she thought it
[1:26:19] would because god said it's going to
[1:26:20] work out this way
[1:26:21] that's
[1:26:22] that's not we're just happy when it
[1:26:24] comes to passport like i just knew it
[1:26:25] knew this would be this way
[1:26:27] that's how it works let some stand
