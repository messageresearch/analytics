[25:01] things and I just think he's wonderful
[25:03] to meet our every need all the time in
[25:06] different ways and just last this week
[25:09] on I was just um at work and all of a
[25:13] sudden I felt a real stinging pain in my
[25:15] foot like in my my foot and as I had to
[25:19] walk around up and down and doing things
[25:20] and I was like how am I going to enjoy
[25:22] this day it was just a funny strange
[25:25] pain and um and that was all morning and
[25:28] then I went to lunch and
[25:29] I prayed for my lunch for my food and
[25:31] somehow prayed for my foot at the same
[25:33] time I didn't really think to I went
[25:36] back to work and worked the whole day
[25:37] and didn't realize my foot was no longer
[25:40] painful at all so at 2 30 or 3 o'clock I
[25:43] realized I had no pain at all after that
[25:46] prayer was made and I thank the Lord for
[25:48] his healing

[43:10] morning in Jesus Christ's name we lord
[43:13] we're commit ourselves into your hands
[43:15] for your glory amen
[43:17] amen God bless you friends you can have
[43:19] your seats this morning I'd like to if I
[43:21] could take a subject I'd like to talk
[43:22] about the impact of life now I'm not
[43:25] talking about the impact of natural life
[43:27] and the cares of this world I'm not
[43:28] talking about that kind of impact I'm
[43:30] talking about the impact of Supernatural
[43:31] life you know the life of God when it
[43:33] impacts us amen because nothing can
[43:36] remain the same after it's come into its
[43:38] presence nothing can be nothing can stay
[43:40] the same amen I'm not just talking about
[43:42] people I'm talking about death will get
[43:44] there as well talk about Satan
[43:45] everything nothing can stay the same
[43:47] once it's been impacted by eternal life
[43:50] amen is the as as John would say in
[43:54] first John this is that which we have
[43:55] from the beginning which we have heard
[43:57] which you have seen with our eyes which
[43:59] we have looked upon and our hands have
[44:01] handled the word of life for the life
[44:03] was manifested and we have seen it and
[44:05] be a witness and shown to you that
[44:08] eternal life which was with the father
[44:09] was manifested unto us that which we
[44:12] have seen and heard declare we unto you
[44:14] that we also that ye Also may have
[44:16] Fellowship without and truly our
[44:17] fellowship is with the father and with
[44:19] his son Jesus Christ and these things we
[44:22] write unto you that your joy may be full
[44:24] amen says not that your sorrow would be
[44:26] magnifiers that your joy would be full
[44:28] amen so life always conquers death
[44:32] yes sir many times we think death
[44:34] conquers life because you know sadly his
[44:36] time with Terry you know we'll bury our
[44:39] loved ones and our parents and different
[44:40] ones and you know but and we think so
[44:42] death is one but death does not win I
[44:44] mean but life conquers death always
[44:46] light conquers Darkness always amen
[44:49] that's the reason why amen the darkness
[44:51] has to fleece because light shines
[44:54] I mean the only reason that we have
[44:55] night is because there's the absence of
[44:57] the Sun and it's on the other side of
[44:59] the Earth but when the when the when the
[45:01] earth orbits around the Sun amen we come
[45:03] into you know face to face with the
[45:05] sunshine amen Darkness has to flee and
[45:07] because darkness is the absence of light
[45:10] amen but it's the light that pushes the
[45:12] darkness I mean it's not the darkness
[45:13] that pushes the light and it's the same
[45:15] thing in this day in the spiritual it's
[45:17] not the darkness I mean it pushes the
[45:19] light amen pushes the word of God to a
[45:21] side no it's actually the light pushes
[45:23] the darkness together amen it brings a
[45:25] friendship between those who normally
[45:27] wouldn't be friends I mean like Herod
[45:29] and pilate became friends because they
[45:30] crucified the Lord Jesus people would
[45:32] never have nothing to do with each other
[45:34] they they become they have Fellowship
[45:36] because why the light was pushing the
[45:37] darkness together but I'm so thankful
[45:39] that we are not the darkness we are the
[45:41] light today I mean where God is pushing
[45:43] us to himself amen drawing amen where
[45:46] where the cherubims amen after Adam and
[45:48] Eve foul actually drove the you know
[45:49] kept the way of the Tree of Life to keep
[45:51] people away from the Tree of Life now
[45:52] those anointings that come upon on the
[45:54] earth to drive us into the tree of life
[45:56] I mean that we could be partakers of
[45:58] Life Hallelujah
[46:00] I'm so thankful that life has an impact
[46:03] Amen in the greater the force the
[46:05] greater the impact amen I say we've all
[46:07] been impacted by eternal life today I
[46:10] trust you can look back in your life and
[46:11] say once upon a time you weren't
[46:13] impacted by eternal life but eternal
[46:15] life was looking for you amen and he
[46:17] found you and changed your life
[46:19] Hallelujah and I trust even in this
[46:21] service this morning amen life will
[46:23] impact us will impact me amen you know I
[46:26] was thinking about the um you know the
[46:28] convention we're going to in Auckland
[46:30] yes you know it's the first convention
[46:31] that Brother Andy and and Brian myself
[46:33] were in Hallelujah and it was a
[46:35] Monumental occasion in my Christian walk
[46:37] and maybe I'm just a bit nostalgic Lord
[46:40] I want to have that same kind of
[46:42] experience again Lord it was in 2009 but
[46:45] you're the same God in 2023. Hallelujah
[46:48] I remember remember going to those
[46:49] services and I turned up late the
[46:51] deacons put me at the front of it this
[46:52] is me for the rest of the camp I didn't
[46:54] care about who was behind me Hallelujah
[46:56] God was in front of me and I was focused
[46:57] on them and we had such a jubilee time
[47:00] zone I pray we'll have that experience
[47:02] even here amen next Sunday you'll have
[47:04] such a resurrection moment amen because
[47:06] God has got everywhere God's children
[47:08] gather amen it's not about the
[47:10] specialness of the speaker or the size
[47:11] of the crowd it's the size of our God
[47:13] that comes down amen touches us
[47:15] personally Hallelujah so I mean I'm
[47:18] looking for a grand time but I but I'm
[47:20] looking for a grand time this morning I
[47:22] mean I'm so thankful we can say life has
[47:24] impacted us amen God has come in contact
[47:26] with us amen and we've never been the
[47:29] same Amen brother bam says from that
[47:31] time he says and there is a place where
[47:34] a man can come to a time that will
[47:35] change him forever for Eternal he will
[47:38] he that will come to me I'll no wise
[47:40] cast out said Jesus amen man can come to
[47:42] God in his whole Eternal destination has
[47:44] changed and a man can meet God he could
[47:47] never be the same anymore you can't make
[47:49] God never remain the same person you was
[47:51] if you turn away from him you'll be a
[47:53] worse person than you was but if you
[47:54] receive him you've got eternal life and
[47:56] he'll raise you up for the last day by
[47:58] his promise amen so I'm so thankful even
[48:00] if we may have turned him down in the
[48:01] past we can come back to him I mean he
[48:03] can restore all the years the enemy has
[48:05] taken from us he says I'll restore all
[48:07] the years the Palm worm Cancun locus of
[48:09] caterpillar to you know have eaten you
[48:11] know I'm so so I'm so thankful amen that
[48:14] we can come back to him amen and we can
[48:16] be impacted by eternal life in the right
[48:18] way amen like the two thieves on the
[48:20] cross you know they were impacted the
[48:22] wrong way actually God manifested in
[48:25] front of them actually drove them away
[48:26] from him because they were caught in the
[48:28] anointing of the scribes and Pharisees
[48:29] making fun of the Lord amen but one had
[48:32] another look amen he said father he said
[48:34] Lord remember me when you come into my
[48:36] kingdom when you come into your kingdom
[48:38] amen he says today you'll be with me in
[48:40] Paradise so because remember both
[48:42] thieves were making fun of the Lord like
[48:43] all the rest but one had another look
[48:45] amen so so initially amen life was
[48:49] impacting them actually drive their
[48:51] attitude towards life was driving them
[48:53] away from God but then he looked again
[48:55] his attitude changed and brought him
[48:56] into Paradise Hallelujah so I'm so
[48:59] thankful God's merciful amen there's
[49:01] life in the body There's Hope Hallelujah
[49:03] so we're not hopeless or helpless Mo but
[49:05] God is here amen
[49:09] praise God
[49:10] Hallelujah
[49:12] amen because remember we all walked one
[49:15] time according to the prince of the
[49:16] power of the year the spirit that now
[49:18] worketh in this in the children of
[49:20] Disobedience we all had our conversation
[49:21] our manner of life that way doesn't
[49:23] matter if we're raised in church or came
[49:25] out of the world we all walked according
[49:27] to the anointing anointing of the enemy
[49:29] amen and we and we fulfill the lust of
[49:32] our flesh fulfilling the desires of our
[49:34] fleshion of the mind and we're by Nature
[49:36] the children of Wrath even as others
[49:37] this is from Ephesians 2. amen but then
[49:39] one day life came amen but God Richard
[49:42] Mercy amen for his great love when he
[49:45] loved us even when we were dead and sins
[49:47] has quickened us together with Christ by
[49:49] Grace we are saved amen has raised us up
[49:52] together made us sit together in
[49:53] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[49:55] that's why I say no one can be the same
[49:57] once they've been in the presence of God
[49:59] Amen no one can walk away the same as an
[50:01] impact amen there's a force of life and
[50:04] which impacts us because once we were
[50:06] dead we may have had natural life in our
[50:08] bodies I'm not talking about that kind
[50:09] of life being impacted by that life I'm
[50:11] talking about eternal life I mean being
[50:13] impacted by his life amen where one time
[50:16] we were dead friends I trust this place
[50:18] this blesses me Hallelujah we can
[50:20] Rejoice you know we we have the greatest
[50:22] thing to celebrate we have life to
[50:24] celebrate eternal life amen and we
[50:26] didn't earn it we didn't we didn't work
[50:28] it out it found us we weren't looking
[50:30] for life life was finding us amen
[50:33] praise the Lord
[50:36] hallelujah amen so let's look at a few
[50:39] people that have been impacted by life
[50:41] Hallelujah let's take a journey through
[50:43] the scripture amen Enoch if he could
[50:45] stand here and say you know I was 65
[50:47] years old sure I was from a good lineage
[50:49] and I could talk to Adam and Eve and I
[50:51] you know all the testimonies for the
[50:52] Believers down through amen but I just
[50:55] had mortal life but when I was 65 years
[50:57] old I Heard a Voice and that voice said
[50:59] will you walk with me and then I decide
[51:01] I'm going to walk with that voice I mean
[51:03] that was the voice of God I mean the
[51:05] ones that you know I heard testimonies
[51:07] of of the great Creator God who made all
[51:09] things but then I heard the voice that
[51:11] spoke let there be sun moon and stars
[51:13] and that voice said come and walk with
[51:15] me amen so so I begin to walk with God
[51:18] and then when I came into trials they
[51:20] said walk with me through the trail Once
[51:22] you walk with me because it's an
[51:23] invitation every day will he walk with
[51:25] him amen so Enoch was invited every day
[51:27] the Lord would say come walk with me
[51:29] today he said I love to walk with you
[51:31] Lord amen so so he got into trials but
[51:34] he walked with God Amen through
[51:36] temptation God walked them through the
[51:38] Temptation amen through hardship amen he
[51:41] walked with God I mean like brother bam
[51:42] says that there's trouble comes up in
[51:44] church walk with God Amen if sickness
[51:46] strikes you walk with God Amen of this
[51:48] financial difficulty walk with God
[51:50] trouble at home walk with God Amen to
[51:52] every time those things would strike
[51:54] Enoch God would say walk with me through
[51:56] the trouble I mean don't stay in the
[51:57] trouble walk with me through the trouble
[51:58] because I want to show myself in this
[52:00] trouble amen there's a reason why all
[52:03] things come upon us is that God wants to
[52:05] show life Hallelujah he wants to show
[52:08] his life eternal life I mean not
[52:10] fighting and fussing and stewing and
[52:12] trouble that's just natural life but
[52:14] eternal life will turn the other cheek
[52:16] eternal life or love the unlovable
[52:18] eternal life will want the best for one
[52:20] another amen eternal life is not selfish
[52:23] Hallelujah
[52:26] amen so you know yeah you know Enoch
[52:29] would come through rejection God says
[52:31] walk with me through the rejection amen
[52:33] through sickness through trouble and
[52:34] then one day I walked all the way there
[52:36] I walked all the way home with that
[52:37] Voice Hallelujah I walked with him and
[52:40] he took me home into Glory why because
[52:42] life impacted Enoch that same life has
[52:45] impacted you and I friends it's more
[52:48] than a story amen he's alive this
[52:50] morning
[52:52] Hallelujah why because Enoch was
[52:54] impacted by life and he is so impacted
[52:56] by life it changed his whole Eternal
[52:58] destination it wasn't just a Sunday
[53:00] morning or a Wednesday or even reading
[53:02] the Bible from time to time and impacted
[53:04] his whole life that he walked with that
[53:06] voice her loots are so amazing God came
[53:09] down in the garden after the fall amen
[53:11] and they ran from that voice but
[53:12] something and he knocks it I want to
[53:14] walk with that voice I learned the same
[53:16] thing with you and I friends I trusted
[53:18] something in you I want to walk with the
[53:19] voice of God I don't just want to talk
[53:21] to him I want him to talk to me I want
[53:23] him to have Fellowship in my sufferings
[53:24] and my pain and my hardship and my
[53:26] trouble amen that I'm not alone
[53:28] we're not alone this morning friends
[53:30] amen we're not alone
[53:33] Hallelujah let's just let's just knock
[53:35] one thing to one side people say I'm not
[53:37] worthy for God to walk with me get that
[53:39] idea out of your head amen God makes us
[53:41] worthy amen he became the lowest of the
[53:43] low I mean to lift up the lowest and to
[53:46] the highest place I mean even he went to
[53:48] the lowest city in the world Jericho I
[53:50] mean and the shortest man in that
[53:52] shortest in that last city had to climb
[53:54] a tree to look down on the Lord to see
[53:55] him for who he was That's How Low our
[53:57] lord Jesus became amen so how God Amen
[54:00] don't worry about your worthiness it's
[54:01] his worthiness I mean it's what he has
[54:03] done that's what that's all that matters
[54:05] it's not what you think about yourself
[54:06] it's what his word says about you amen
[54:09] and this word does not say that we're
[54:10] lost and wretched and miserable naked
[54:12] blind amen full of sin that's not what
[54:15] this word says about me or you this word
[54:17] says you're worthy this word says you're
[54:18] being washed in the blood this word says
[54:20] he's made a way for you this word says
[54:22] your righteousness he is righteous it
[54:24] means we're going to take him at his
[54:25] word say yea Lord I believe what you've
[54:27] said about me I believe your testimony
[54:29] God about me
[54:31] well that's how we should be this
[54:33] morning amen don't don't listen to your
[54:36] own testimony take God's testimony about
[54:38] you
[54:40] but don't you know my failures and false
[54:42] god knows them more than you know about
[54:44] them and God doesn't hold them against
[54:45] you Hallelujah so why should we hold
[54:48] those against ourselves I mean let's
[54:50] take another one let's take job job
[54:52] working up against standing and say you
[54:54] know I was I was a wise man God give me
[54:56] great wisdom God blessed me with cattle
[54:58] and land and family and all these things
[55:00] and I had everything and yet you know
[55:03] and and and I heard about this great God
[55:05] that that that required a lamb sacrifice
[55:08] so I so so I'd sacrifice a lamb I even
[55:11] sacrificed it for my children and you
[55:13] know pre-adventure they had sinned or
[55:14] done anything wrong and you know but
[55:16] then one day one day I came into a great
[55:19] trial of my life where I lost everything
[55:21] in a day I lost my children I lost my
[55:23] life you know I lost my sheep and my
[55:25] cattle and everything I lost it all amen
[55:27] but there was something in me because of
[55:29] the Lamb Hallelujah now that sacrifice
[55:31] what it was pointing to
[55:34] came and talked to me and I was impacted
[55:37] by eternal life
[55:38] where once I was just wondering where
[55:41] where do we go when we die what happens
[55:43] you know I see the resurrection in
[55:45] nature I see everything around you know
[55:47] trees come back life comes back but
[55:49] where does man go we put man in the
[55:50] grave where does he go but then life
[55:53] came and impacted my
[55:55] eternal life came on the scene
[55:57] Hallelujah and then because of that I
[55:59] can stand and say no I know my redeemer
[56:01] liveth Hallelujah and he shall stand at
[56:04] the latter day upon the Earth and though
[56:06] my skin worms destroy destroy this body
[56:08] yet in my flesh I'll see God why could
[56:11] he say that because he was impacted by
[56:12] life amen eternal life came his way amen
[56:16] here since Sarah he was a sincere
[56:18] believer brother Ram said the reason he
[56:19] is a perfect man is because he trusted
[56:22] in the blood of the Lamb that's what
[56:24] made him perfect friends and that's the
[56:25] same thing with you and I it's not our
[56:27] ability
[56:29] it's not how smart we are how righteous
[56:31] we think we are it's our are we fully
[56:33] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[56:35] amen because remember and and I'll get
[56:38] it get to it to the end of the service
[56:39] but you know the Christian Walkers based
[56:41] on rest the Christian Life is rest it's
[56:44] not struggling fussing and trouble it's
[56:46] rest Amen to but but you can only rest
[56:49] if you're fully trusting for the blood
[56:51] for everything Hallelujah you can't you
[56:53] know because what happens is we get to a
[56:55] stage where we get to worry about now
[56:57] you know subconsciously we think it's
[56:59] our works and the blood will Merit
[57:01] anything from God but no it's the blood
[57:03] alone Hallelujah
[57:07] praise the Lord
[57:09] amen
[57:11] and in job because he was impacted by
[57:13] life he says but I know the way but he
[57:15] knows the way that I take and when he
[57:17] hath tried me I shall come forth as gold
[57:20] Hallelujah I mean he is impacted by life
[57:24] amen and then when he is impacted by
[57:26] life that life said God told him now you
[57:29] go pray for your friends now you go off
[57:31] of forgiveness you you you be the priest
[57:34] for them when they've been telling a lie
[57:36] about what life really is the impact of
[57:38] Life saying your secret Synod job you've
[57:40] done all this wrong he had to go pray
[57:42] for his friends and then God turned his
[57:44] captivity but why could he do that
[57:46] because he's impacted by life I mean he
[57:48] wasn't impacted by arguments or religion
[57:50] or or misunderstandings he was impacted
[57:53] by eternal life that's why he could
[57:55] forgive his friends for lying to him
[57:56] about who God was because remember they
[57:58] were preaching to job this is why this
[58:01] has happened and this is why this and
[58:02] now we're using all religious arguments
[58:04] they were preaching a false gospel to
[58:06] him and then God came on the scene said
[58:08] what they're saying is lying this is
[58:09] what the truth is but because but you've
[58:11] got to pray for them because my wrath is
[58:13] turned against them but because he was
[58:15] impacted by eternal life he could
[58:17] now how about you and I friends
[58:19] can we if we've been impacted not just
[58:22] impressed impacted I mean Something's
[58:25] Happened there's been a life-changing
[58:26] moment one day we're going this way now
[58:29] we're going that way with god what
[58:30] happened there was an impact amen a
[58:33] force greater than death a force greater
[58:35] than our pride a force greater than our
[58:37] Humanity impacted us and now we're
[58:40] walking with the Lord
[58:41] Hallelujah I trust that's happened to
[58:43] you yeah I'm just giving you your
[58:45] testimony back to you this morning
[58:46] because we've got to realize the victory
[58:48] remember Calvary was a victory the
[58:50] resurrection was a victory and now we
[58:52] are the beneficiaries of that Victory
[58:54] Amen in 2023. Hallelujah we can walk in
[58:58] Victory now because of what he has done
[59:00] for us that's all that matters
[59:03] Hallelujah
[59:05] amen we're closer to God he's closer
[59:07] than your next breath amen
[59:10] Hallelujah amen If Abraham could stand
[59:13] here and say amen he was like any other
[59:15] ordinary Man actually him and his family
[59:17] his forebeest came out of the Tower of
[59:19] Babel they were Idol worshipers they
[59:21] were he was just like any other man but
[59:24] one day God called him by the way I'm
[59:26] saying there was nothing special about
[59:27] Abraham but God called him that's what
[59:28] makes the difference and same thing with
[59:30] you and I there's nothing special about
[59:31] you and I but God called us that's what
[59:33] made the difference in our lives what
[59:35] happened is so one day he thought this
[59:37] is where I'm from this is my family this
[59:39] is where I should be I'm from the ear of
[59:41] the chaldees this is who I am he was
[59:43] only impacted by natural life with that
[59:45] thinking right but then God came down
[59:48] and called him say get from at this land
[59:50] I'll take you to another land what
[59:51] happened
[59:52] eternal life impacted him and then we he
[59:55] began to walk with God and then he began
[59:57] to look for that City whose Builder and
[59:59] maker is God he walked upon the very
[1:00:01] land where that city is going to come
[1:00:03] down he was so sure it was there
[1:00:04] somewhere why because he was impacted by
[1:00:07] eternal life hallelujah amen he met the
[1:00:11] king of that City
[1:00:13] okay
[1:00:15] excuse me amen he met the king of that
[1:00:17] City he was so impacted by eternal life
[1:00:19] Hallelujah
[1:00:21] that he looked for that City I'm trust
[1:00:23] you've been impacted that same way I'm
[1:00:25] just a pilgrim and a stranger what's
[1:00:27] going on in the world it's going to chew
[1:00:29] itself up Let it chew we've we've got
[1:00:32] another calling we've got a high and
[1:00:33] holy calling this hour we're not here to
[1:00:36] be caught up in what's going on in the
[1:00:37] world it'll do what it'll do it'll
[1:00:39] fulfill what it's meant to fulfill amen
[1:00:42] but let's fulfill the word that's
[1:00:43] allotted us I mean to be a living
[1:00:46] witness in this end time that people
[1:00:47] would see actually we have something
[1:00:49] different and it's not because we're
[1:00:51] putting put on suits and ties and carry
[1:00:53] a Bible no but there's a writ there's
[1:00:54] life
[1:00:55] because why we get impacted by life that
[1:00:58] that life will impact others through us
[1:01:00] Hallelujah
[1:01:02] amen
[1:01:05] amen if Moses could stand here
[1:01:07] he'd say I knew the promise I knew I was
[1:01:10] going to be the deliverer my mother
[1:01:12] would whisper it into my into my ears
[1:01:14] when I was young you're going to be a
[1:01:16] deliverer God answered our prayers give
[1:01:19] the testimony when he was born God kept
[1:01:21] you safe in the Nile God brought you
[1:01:23] here into Pharaoh's household not that
[1:01:25] you'd become fair but you'd deliver our
[1:01:27] people because you are the answer to
[1:01:29] prophecy that's why you're being raised
[1:01:31] up as a deliverer just like we are
[1:01:33] actually an answer to prophecy this
[1:01:34] morning amen God prophesied of a bride
[1:01:37] and here we are the answer that prophecy
[1:01:39] I think it's got to be a fulfillment
[1:01:41] amen but then he said you know I I was
[1:01:43] just impacted by reasoning and learning
[1:01:46] though I knew the quotes I knew the
[1:01:48] scriptures I knew all those things I
[1:01:49] knew my position in it but you know I
[1:01:51] was just impacted by natural life and I
[1:01:53] tried to do it in my own strength
[1:01:56] but then I just killed one Egyptian and
[1:01:57] ran for my life but then when I was 80
[1:01:59] years old
[1:02:01] eternal life impacted me I was I was
[1:02:03] just raising my father-in-law's sheep
[1:02:06] I thought this is all it was for me this
[1:02:08] is this is all life was I mean but then
[1:02:10] eternal life came down in the form of a
[1:02:12] burning bush and impacted me in such a
[1:02:14] way and I learned more about God in
[1:02:17] those five minutes than I did the 80
[1:02:19] years of my entire life those I don't
[1:02:22] know what my mother taught me was true
[1:02:24] though all those things were true but I
[1:02:25] needed the one who gave the prophecy to
[1:02:27] come live in me and fulfill the prophecy
[1:02:30] amens the same thing with you and I
[1:02:32] friends there's many promises in the
[1:02:33] scripture but we need him the quickener
[1:02:35] of the word I mean they're coming
[1:02:36] quicker in our lives and bring it to
[1:02:38] past hey Mr this is then I was impacted
[1:02:40] by eternal life now I was no longer my
[1:02:43] own I was a prisoner to love divine and
[1:02:45] I went down into Egypt amen you know
[1:02:48] many times we think of it's just death
[1:02:50] coming to Egypt no it was actually Life
[1:02:52] coming in but a pharaoh would have just
[1:02:54] received that life Hallelujah they would
[1:02:57] have been a Powerhouse a greater
[1:02:58] Powerhouse than they were but God raised
[1:03:00] him up to show his mighty hand but it
[1:03:03] was life to the Israelites amen I'm so
[1:03:05] thankful in this Exodus it's life to you
[1:03:07] and I it's not death
[1:03:09] praise God it's life to whosoever will
[1:03:12] amen and then he was so impacted that he
[1:03:15] that he followed the Lord now let's just
[1:03:17] come to Elijah I'm just jumping through
[1:03:19] a few here
[1:03:20] Hallelujah I'm just I'm just jumping
[1:03:23] through a few here Elijah Elijah would
[1:03:25] say I was just a farmer I was just a man
[1:03:27] of the Wilderness but that I was
[1:03:29] impacted by life I just wanna I'm just
[1:03:31] going to repeat this through the
[1:03:32] scripture going on a journey because I
[1:03:34] trust it means something to you amen so
[1:03:36] Elijah was impacted by life
[1:03:39] amen he fed me when there was a drought
[1:03:41] amen he gave me victory in the face of
[1:03:43] Baal and all of his prophets amen he and
[1:03:46] and and I'm so thankful that he didn't
[1:03:48] answer my prayers when I was under the
[1:03:50] juniper tree aren't you glad that he
[1:03:52] doesn't answer all your prayers Abraham
[1:03:55] no I mean I mean Elijah prayed with all
[1:03:57] of his heart Lord take my life I'm just
[1:04:00] like my fathers he had no idea there was
[1:04:02] a chariot right he had to take one day I
[1:04:05] mean he was praying a country to the
[1:04:07] will of God for his life and God didn't
[1:04:10] answer that prayer aren't you glad
[1:04:11] sometimes we get so torn up and stressed
[1:04:13] we're praying and God I'm useless God I
[1:04:15] can't maybe it's just me God yeah I you
[1:04:17] know I can't overcome I'm never gonna
[1:04:19] and he doesn't listen to that because
[1:04:21] because Elijah says I'm just like my
[1:04:24] father's he wasn't just like his fathers
[1:04:26] he heard the voice of God Amen he
[1:04:29] followed God he's you know when the
[1:04:30] altar was there the sacrifice was there
[1:04:32] was covered in water I'm out come he
[1:04:33] says Lord I've done all this according
[1:04:35] to your word what if his fathers
[1:04:37] followed the word none of them followed
[1:04:38] the word they were following Baal and
[1:04:40] all the stuff but see he wasn't like his
[1:04:42] fathers and he wasn't built like his
[1:04:44] fathers because he was unique in his
[1:04:46] generation because he had to go on a
[1:04:47] Rapture so he wasn't like his fathers
[1:04:49] but he says Lord I'm just like everyone
[1:04:51] else no
[1:04:54] no we're not God's made us different you
[1:04:56] and your Humanity may feel the same but
[1:04:58] we're not all the same amen God's
[1:05:00] ordained a different path for you and I
[1:05:02] if we go by the way of the Grave or the
[1:05:04] dead in Christ arise first you win if
[1:05:06] you go you know if you're alive your
[1:05:08] body's changed you win so either way we
[1:05:09] win
[1:05:11] Glory Hallelujah
[1:05:15] Hallelujah and I was so impacted by his
[1:05:18] voice that when I got down
[1:05:20] to the end of my road he sent down a
[1:05:22] flaming Chariot to take me home while he
[1:05:24] was impacted by eternal life
[1:05:26] Hallelujah now we know we know life and
[1:05:29] death can't dwell together
[1:05:31] amen well I'll come to that later
[1:05:33] actually amen let's bring King David
[1:05:35] here
[1:05:36] amen David could say you know I was a
[1:05:38] young man
[1:05:40] and then I came into contact with life
[1:05:42] life impacted me amen when I came before
[1:05:44] the prophet Samuel Vindicated Prophet
[1:05:46] for his age amen and he anointed me amen
[1:05:49] and he said the spirit of God was with
[1:05:51] me from that day on I was impacted by
[1:05:53] that anointing amen just like the bride
[1:05:55] of Christ is impacted by the anointing
[1:05:57] of the word in this day Hallelujah he
[1:05:59] says now as a Shepherd before that but
[1:06:02] then the Lord became my shepherd
[1:06:04] say we were impacted by life it leads us
[1:06:07] it doesn't just throw us off into a
[1:06:09] corner but no his life leads us his
[1:06:12] presence goes before us amen he
[1:06:14] surrounds us he's within us amen he says
[1:06:16] I was I was a Shepherd but then the Lord
[1:06:18] became my shepherd amen he became more
[1:06:21] than life to me amen sure I played the
[1:06:24] heart before that but it was different
[1:06:25] when I play after he after I was
[1:06:27] impacted by eternal life because he came
[1:06:30] down to enjoy the song Hallelujah you
[1:06:32] may not be able to sing like nothing but
[1:06:34] you just sing from your heart one time
[1:06:35] and God will come and enjoy that song
[1:06:38] Hallelujah I mean it was my joy he was
[1:06:41] my peace I went through great struggles
[1:06:43] in the wilderness in great trouble and I
[1:06:45] was on the run and so much distressed
[1:06:47] but he was I was so impacted by him he
[1:06:50] said I was going to stand on the throne
[1:06:51] one day and I knew that that promise was
[1:06:54] true because I was so impacted by that
[1:06:56] anointing earlier I went through great
[1:06:58] trouble and great hardship Hallelujah
[1:07:00] but he became my peace and my joy and my
[1:07:03] strength amen as long as I stayed close
[1:07:06] to him I won every battle amen why
[1:07:08] because life remember death could not
[1:07:11] stand in the presence of life amen
[1:07:13] remember that lion and that bear
[1:07:14] represented death just a natural death
[1:07:16] but life conquered that death amen
[1:07:19] Goliath represented death but life
[1:07:21] conquered death hallelujah amen life cut
[1:07:24] death head off and carries it as a
[1:07:26] trophy Hallelujah so as long as I stay
[1:07:29] close to him
[1:07:30] I won every battle because he was my
[1:07:33] shepherd and a true Shepherd will defend
[1:07:35] his Sheep amen they won't let any War
[1:07:37] for devil nothing coming amen so a true
[1:07:39] Shepherd fights amen for us amen but
[1:07:42] when I did stray
[1:07:44] he came after me
[1:07:46] because it's not just see see it's not
[1:07:48] just when we're on the path that we
[1:07:50] appreciate life that's impacted us when
[1:07:52] we stray off the path remember all sheep
[1:07:54] they've gone astray there's always
[1:07:56] moments that oh walk where we wander off
[1:07:58] and do things we shouldn't wander off
[1:08:00] into amen but our Shepherd leaves the 99
[1:08:02] and he goes after the one
[1:08:06] amen he says I did stray but he came
[1:08:09] after me he didn't leave me in that
[1:08:11] backslidden state when I took Bathsheba
[1:08:13] and killed Uriah and covered up all the
[1:08:14] sin no God doesn't leave us in those
[1:08:16] things if we've been impacted by life
[1:08:18] remember he saves us to keep us amen so
[1:08:21] he doesn't let us wander off too far he
[1:08:23] wants to bring us back on the track way
[1:08:24] because he is our Shepherd aren't you
[1:08:27] glad we have a Shepherd this morning
[1:08:28] amen if we get cold and lukewarm and
[1:08:32] formal and distant detached God doesn't
[1:08:34] leave us in that state he comes after us
[1:08:36] amen that's why David could say surely
[1:08:41] goodness and mercy shall follow me over
[1:08:43] days of my life and I'll dwell in the
[1:08:45] house of the Lord forever he knew that
[1:08:47] from experience because when it says
[1:08:49] goodness and mercy shall follow me that
[1:08:51] follow means actually to pursue after it
[1:08:53] means to hunt down so it's not just it's
[1:08:55] not just following from a distance
[1:08:57] following from behind and you're up
[1:08:59] there and it's back here no God God's
[1:09:01] mercy and his goodness that follows us
[1:09:04] actually pursues us and actually
[1:09:06] overtakes us and apprehends us and
[1:09:08] brings us home aren't you glad that we
[1:09:10] can be impacted by life like that
[1:09:12] hallelujah what a victory we have
[1:09:14] friends what a victory is one you and I
[1:09:17] amen when in our natural selves there's
[1:09:19] not there's nothing in this person that
[1:09:22] actually hungers after God it's a
[1:09:24] supernatural longing that God puts in US
[1:09:26] amen it's not us that decides you're
[1:09:28] going to be a Christian one day it's God
[1:09:29] it's God put something and you say my
[1:09:32] child I need your attention I want you
[1:09:35] to be impacted by my life not in a
[1:09:37] negative way but in a positive way
[1:09:41] Hallelujah
[1:09:43] Hallelujah when I went off the path is
[1:09:46] goodness and mercy Hunted Me Down
[1:09:48] and then I could say Lord Blood Out hide
[1:09:50] hide thy face from my sins Lord blot out
[1:09:53] all my iniquities created me a clean out
[1:09:56] our Lord and your right Spirit Within Me
[1:09:57] cast me not away from thy presence take
[1:10:00] not thy Holy Spirit from me because
[1:10:01] there's something when you get impacted
[1:10:03] by eternal life you never want to leave
[1:10:04] that place you never want to leave that
[1:10:06] presence you just want to be there
[1:10:08] forever if you can just live the rest of
[1:10:09] your days exactly in that moment you'd
[1:10:11] be the happiest person in all the world
[1:10:13] but I'm so thankful that that presence
[1:10:16] isn't contained to a building or a
[1:10:18] moment in a car or a moment at a house
[1:10:20] wherever he found you but his presence
[1:10:22] goes with you even into the trials of
[1:10:25] life even to the cares of life God's in
[1:10:28] there amen God doesn't just give make us
[1:10:30] overcome us when there's no trouble no
[1:10:32] he wants to show you you can be the
[1:10:34] busiest person with the biggest family
[1:10:35] but yet you can be Victorious and walk
[1:10:38] in peace Hallelujah
[1:10:40] I'm so glad for that aren't you friends
[1:10:43] Hallelujah
[1:10:46] amen but then one day my shepherd came
[1:10:48] to me the one last time
[1:10:50] he says I'm going to lead you David
[1:10:53] and then David asked them where are we
[1:10:54] going Lord are we going to go to gilgal
[1:10:57] we're going to go to Ramos Gilead and
[1:10:58] we're going to go to some place and
[1:11:00] Israel says no I'm going to take you to
[1:11:02] eternal
[1:11:04] that's where life leads us
[1:11:06] Hallelujah because it's not just a
[1:11:09] Shepherd a natural life it's that moment
[1:11:11] it's that moment when our last breath
[1:11:14] leaves our body or when these when these
[1:11:17] bodies are changed that's the moment
[1:11:18] that counts remember we're living for
[1:11:20] that moment aren't we we're like you
[1:11:23] know like brother Bosworth you know he
[1:11:24] was dying brother Brown went in to see
[1:11:25] him he says when was the best moment of
[1:11:27] your life brother bosworthy says right
[1:11:29] now because in a few moments the one
[1:11:32] I've Loved let's go to walk through that
[1:11:34] door and take me home I trust you feel
[1:11:36] that way this morning I feel that way
[1:11:38] I'm looking for that moment that's what
[1:11:40] we live for the one who died for us the
[1:11:43] one who cared for us through life when
[1:11:45] we couldn't we when we couldn't meet it
[1:11:47] when we couldn't come to ends meet we
[1:11:49] had no food God provided I mean we're in
[1:11:52] trouble and hardship God provided it can
[1:11:54] seem such a natural thing but it's God's
[1:11:56] unseen hand guiding people to look after
[1:11:58] you Hallelujah when you wanted to throw
[1:12:00] it all away life is impacted you in such
[1:12:03] a way says you can't throw me away
[1:12:04] because I won't throw you away
[1:12:07] Hallelujah
[1:12:11] praise God
[1:12:12] Hallelujah say he was led to Eternal
[1:12:14] pastures green why because he's impacted
[1:12:17] by life
[1:12:18] Hallelujah
[1:12:21] Hallelujah now we look at we look at
[1:12:23] ones like the woman at the well I'm so
[1:12:25] glad life interrupts Natural Life
[1:12:28] I'm so glad we can you know sometimes we
[1:12:30] think this is just me for the rest of my
[1:12:31] life and I've been going through the
[1:12:33] motions day after day week after week
[1:12:35] you know like Hershey you know she had
[1:12:37] five husbands she's living with another
[1:12:38] man all this trouble but then life had
[1:12:40] to impact her because life said I have I
[1:12:43] need to go by the way of Samaria and if
[1:12:45] he really explained it to his disciples
[1:12:47] he said I have a gene seed I have an
[1:12:49] attribute and Samaria I'm in the outside
[1:12:52] may look all mad up but down on the soul
[1:12:54] is part of me I must go by part of me
[1:12:56] amen so he goes by the well he begins to
[1:12:59] reveal himself what was happening life
[1:13:01] was impacting I mean at first they had a
[1:13:04] religious conversation because she
[1:13:06] wasn't quite getting it yet I mean yes
[1:13:08] our fathers worshiped here and did this
[1:13:10] and this is what churches like and blah
[1:13:12] blah blah blah blah but God wants to go
[1:13:14] beyond that and then he wants to reveal
[1:13:16] himself saying that's why he reveals the
[1:13:18] secrets of our hearts he speaks to our
[1:13:20] hearts what he's trying to get us to see
[1:13:22] it's Messiah speaking amen it is life
[1:13:25] impacting you and I
[1:13:27] Hallelujah I'm so glad I'm so glad even
[1:13:30] if our eyes get callous God makes them
[1:13:32] soft again that's what I've been I've
[1:13:34] been praying this week
[1:13:36] soften my heart with oil Lord maima I
[1:13:39] think it's like Keith Green said Lord
[1:13:40] May the skin of my heart be like a baby
[1:13:42] skin soft and pliable that even the
[1:13:45] smallest touch can touch me impact me so
[1:13:48] greatly I mean this world has become
[1:13:50] callous but we don't have to become
[1:13:52] calloused and the reason the world
[1:13:54] becomes callous is they don't know the
[1:13:55] answer out I mean that's why we get
[1:13:58] frustrated and we get hardened because
[1:13:59] we don't see the way out but he's our
[1:14:01] way out Hallelujah so may we never
[1:14:03] become hardened
[1:14:07] Hallelujah
[1:14:09] amen there she was I mean I was impacted
[1:14:12] by life I was so impacted by life that
[1:14:15] when he said he was Messiah something of
[1:14:17] me said that's exactly the truth and I
[1:14:19] ran into the City and told everyone
[1:14:21] about it why I was so impacted I mean my
[1:14:24] life was changed I didn't think I had
[1:14:25] any future but now I have a future
[1:14:27] Hallelujah then I went to the upper room
[1:14:30] and that same one that spoke to me came
[1:14:32] and dwelt in me now it became the inside
[1:14:34] voice now it became the inside teacher
[1:14:37] now it became the inside guide I trust
[1:14:39] he's done the same thing with you and I
[1:14:41] friends this morning he's not just
[1:14:43] externally speaking to you but he's in
[1:14:44] here amen witnessing the word is Right
[1:14:47] witnessing that he is the way the truth
[1:14:49] and the life amen that he becomes the
[1:14:51] inside Shepherd Hallelujah
[1:14:53] praise God
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:58] I mean Legion was in tombs
[1:15:01] he started off he didn't start off that
[1:15:03] way but he ended up that way
[1:15:05] it's amazing when you listen to Brother
[1:15:07] Bear and preach about your from that
[1:15:08] time people start you know they just say
[1:15:11] one lie being a child and there's
[1:15:13] something in them says don't lie to your
[1:15:14] parents but then they lied and they turn
[1:15:16] into a compulsive liar and believe their
[1:15:17] own life and their worlds fall apart
[1:15:19] just starting from one thing and then so
[1:15:22] so Legion started off that way something
[1:15:24] small but then one one Spirit entered
[1:15:27] him maybe lying another one lust Envy
[1:15:30] Strife Pride all these things then he
[1:15:33] had a whole Legion of demons in him amen
[1:15:36] but life was going to come to show it
[1:15:37] doesn't matter how fortified a person is
[1:15:39] doesn't matter how much the Devil May
[1:15:41] Garrison a person's life they can be
[1:15:44] complex to their eyeballs and then to
[1:15:45] the ceiling they can have all kind of
[1:15:47] doubt and flusterations and demons
[1:15:49] running their life but remember death
[1:15:52] cannot stand in the presence of life
[1:15:54] amen death cannot hold life Hallelujah
[1:15:58] so then the Lord crossed the sea just
[1:16:00] for one
[1:16:01] I'm so glad he crosses the sea for one
[1:16:03] he crossed the sea for me Hallelujah
[1:16:06] that's my king amen
[1:16:08] Hallelujah
[1:16:12] praise the Lord and then life came to me
[1:16:15] so impacted by that life he was freed he
[1:16:17] went back to his family amen normal
[1:16:20] health is strong and well
[1:16:22] Hallelujah now I'm so glad life goes
[1:16:24] beyond Dimensions it's not just
[1:16:26] affecting these Dimensions you know
[1:16:28] Lazarus if he could stand it you're
[1:16:29] saying you know as a friend of Jesus
[1:16:31] he'd been in our home before there's
[1:16:33] nothing like his presence but I started
[1:16:35] to get sick and at first we got doctors
[1:16:37] and we you know we thought you know it
[1:16:39] was okay but I was getting worse and
[1:16:40] worse and I was even we even sent for
[1:16:43] Jesus to come Mary and Martha I was just
[1:16:45] on my bed and I couldn't I was barely
[1:16:47] conscious and they would but I would
[1:16:48] hear them say it's okay we call for
[1:16:50] Jesus he's going to come and we prayed
[1:16:52] and he's going to come we believe you
[1:16:53] know sometimes we think God doesn't
[1:16:55] answer our prayers
[1:16:57] but God answers our prayers I mean he
[1:16:59] doesn't answer always how we want him to
[1:17:01] answer but he answers our prayers amen
[1:17:03] so there he was and he found himself in
[1:17:06] Paradise he had died he's in fellowship
[1:17:08] with Abraham Isaac and Jacob all the
[1:17:10] Believers down through amen Ruth and
[1:17:13] Hannah and Tamar and different ones
[1:17:16] but then he heard a voice
[1:17:18] because remember life and death cannot
[1:17:22] stay in the same place
[1:17:24] amen death must always give way to life
[1:17:26] brother Graham says we see him here on
[1:17:29] Earth as a conqueror we see him stand
[1:17:31] here by the side of the grave and
[1:17:33] Conquer death in that man his soul was
[1:17:35] four days journey I don't know where he
[1:17:37] was neither do you but wherever he was
[1:17:39] he conquered and brought it back
[1:17:41] corruption knew its Master amen and the
[1:17:44] soul of this man had been dead and come
[1:17:46] back and lived again in a mortal body
[1:17:48] and sat at a table and eat and never a
[1:17:51] man could do that before he was God's
[1:17:53] Mighty pardon me conqueror and sickness
[1:17:56] he never preached a funeral death
[1:17:58] couldn't stand in his presence how could
[1:18:00] death and life dwell together they can't
[1:18:02] do it that's the reason today brother
[1:18:03] when the church is Born Again of the
[1:18:05] spirit of God death and life can't hold
[1:18:07] together something takes place Christ
[1:18:10] comes in and conquers our passions he
[1:18:11] conquers our desires he conquers all
[1:18:13] that's ungodly about us and because he
[1:18:16] lives we live also he conquers
[1:18:18] everything that's ungodly he already did
[1:18:20] it it's laying in our hands just to
[1:18:23] receive hey man so so Lazarus was four
[1:18:26] days in the grave
[1:18:28] but then he heard the voice of the
[1:18:29] master he's having Fellowship of Abraham
[1:18:31] Isaac and Jacob having a wonderful time
[1:18:32] but then he heard the master call him by
[1:18:34] by name he says I've got to go
[1:18:36] Hallelujah and actually his voice made
[1:18:39] him move dimensions
[1:18:41] made him change worlds just like the
[1:18:44] voice of God in this generation will
[1:18:46] cause us to go from this world to the
[1:18:48] next World Hallelujah why because the
[1:18:51] the voice of God has power in it to make
[1:18:54] people change from this Dimension to
[1:18:55] another dimension hallelu we've already
[1:18:58] received that voice
[1:18:59] amen that transforming power it's
[1:19:01] already Within You by the baptism of the
[1:19:03] Holy Ghost hey man it's not something
[1:19:05] external it's more than just a voice on
[1:19:07] tape no it's a voice behind the voice
[1:19:09] amen the quickener of the word that
[1:19:11] makes it live in our lives
[1:19:13] Hallelujah
[1:19:15] amen now let's ask his enemies oh I
[1:19:19] really enjoyed this I hope you enjoy it
[1:19:21] too let's ask his enemies let's call
[1:19:23] death up
[1:19:24] let's call death to testify and he's got
[1:19:27] to tell the truth
[1:19:28] Hallelujah you have death could stand
[1:19:30] here and say I had Adam I had Adam's
[1:19:33] Fallen race all the way down from Adam
[1:19:35] and Eve every one of them I had my
[1:19:37] Stinger and I put my Stinger in them
[1:19:40] pulled it out and they died
[1:19:43] and they've had a sting and I was
[1:19:45] unconquerable nothing could none of the
[1:19:47] prophets all the great prophets though
[1:19:49] they though they doubt you know you know
[1:19:51] they beat up my you know your your
[1:19:53] demons in trouble and cast me out and
[1:19:55] did all these kind of troubles
[1:19:56] everywhere but yet they came to their
[1:19:57] last breath
[1:19:59] I stuck them
[1:20:01] Hallelujah and I had Victory out of
[1:20:03] every one of them amen only Elijah and
[1:20:06] Enoch
[1:20:08] got away
[1:20:10] but all the others I got them didn't
[1:20:12] matter how righteous holy whatever they
[1:20:14] thought they were I got them but then
[1:20:16] this man came
[1:20:18] he's born and he's born in Bethlehem
[1:20:21] he didn't look like much I thought he's
[1:20:22] just like all the rest of them I'll get
[1:20:24] him one day
[1:20:25] but then he would speak and the dead
[1:20:27] would come back to life again but I
[1:20:29] thought that's fine I'll get that one
[1:20:30] anyway because hey they came back to
[1:20:32] life but they all have to die I'll still
[1:20:34] have them eventually Hallelujah
[1:20:37] but then they came to a point
[1:20:39] when finally a howling mob Cried Out
[1:20:42] crucify him and then he was he was
[1:20:44] condemned to die by pilate pilate washed
[1:20:46] his hands but you can't wash the blood
[1:20:48] of Jesus Christ off your hands by
[1:20:50] fobbing it off amen you've got to get it
[1:20:52] on your heart that's the only way you
[1:20:53] can get it off your hands how do you get
[1:20:54] the blood on your heart give your life
[1:20:56] to him amen so then now he was he was
[1:20:58] condensed that they they put a crown of
[1:21:00] thorns on his head he was mad more than
[1:21:02] any man I thought oh clock's ticking I'm
[1:21:04] gonna get him I'm gonna get him he's
[1:21:06] caused all kinds of trouble too to to to
[1:21:08] to my boss Satan and you know all of all
[1:21:10] the emps and hell and all this trouble
[1:21:12] he's got a lot of trouble to my team I'm
[1:21:14] gonna get him I've got the last say
[1:21:16] that's what death would say I have the
[1:21:17] last say and then now I see him I'm you
[1:21:20] know buzzing around him because I know
[1:21:21] his time is short and then now he's
[1:21:23] carrying that cross up Calvary and then
[1:21:25] the bloody you know he loses so much
[1:21:27] blood out of his body that it was a
[1:21:28] couple of spots on his row but just went
[1:21:30] to one big bloody mass
[1:21:32] he's carrying the cross up and then they
[1:21:35] and they crucify him and put him up
[1:21:36] there I think now is my time
[1:21:38] now's my time and then he said into my
[1:21:41] into into your hands father I command my
[1:21:43] spirit
[1:21:44] and then I went to sting him and I
[1:21:47] thought this is going to be the most
[1:21:48] satisfying sting
[1:21:50] ever it was satisfying to sting Adam
[1:21:53] and Eve because they had eternal life no
[1:21:55] Fowler now I can get them
[1:21:56] and then all the prophets but this one I
[1:21:59] was looking forward to this one but then
[1:22:01] when I put my Stinger in unseen hand
[1:22:04] came and grabbed the Stinger I tried to
[1:22:06] pull it out I tried to be free but then
[1:22:09] it ripped out and now I don't have a
[1:22:11] stinger no more amen I can never be the
[1:22:14] same death would say I can never be the
[1:22:16] same now because I can never get my
[1:22:18] Stinger back death would say I have been
[1:22:20] impacted
[1:22:23] by eternal life I've been empty death
[1:22:26] was impacted by life that day on Calvary
[1:22:28] amen he could say I can never recover
[1:22:31] from this
[1:22:33] I could never recover from this I could
[1:22:35] never grasping her back I can never buy
[1:22:38] another one that is irreplaceable and I
[1:22:41] can never you know we think man we were
[1:22:43] impacted that day when he found you and
[1:22:45] I my life could never be the same uh
[1:22:48] trust you can say my life can never be
[1:22:50] the same and now death can say my
[1:22:53] existence can never be the same because
[1:22:55] of that down Calvary many times you
[1:22:57] think what did it do to you what did it
[1:22:59] do to him
[1:23:01] Hallelujah Hallelujah to the lamb
[1:23:04] Hallelujah
[1:23:07] oh my
[1:23:08] and now for 2 000 years
[1:23:11] I've tried to sting people
[1:23:15] and some people are afraid when they die
[1:23:17] that's normal but now there's a
[1:23:18] different class of people on the Earth
[1:23:22] that Apostle Paul caused me a lot of
[1:23:23] trouble
[1:23:24] I'm going to torment this guy because
[1:23:26] all I can do is Buzz now I can't sting
[1:23:28] all I can do is Buzz so he buzzes around
[1:23:31] the Apostle Paul
[1:23:33] I've got him in a dungeon he's hungry
[1:23:36] he's cold he's chained to a guard I'm
[1:23:39] just tormenting him because that's all I
[1:23:41] can do nowadays
[1:23:42] and then and then I inspire
[1:23:47] I Inspire Nero to condemn him to die
[1:23:50] because I just want him off the scene
[1:23:52] and then now then now the orders come he
[1:23:55] hears it through the his his prison bars
[1:23:57] Paul we're going to cut your head off
[1:23:59] can you hear the grinding of the ax on
[1:24:01] the on the stone pool it's got your name
[1:24:04] on it now I think now I've got him he's
[1:24:07] going to start shaking in his boots it's
[1:24:08] been all bravado it's been all bravado
[1:24:10] until now but then he would stand and
[1:24:12] say death where's your sting Graver is
[1:24:15] your Victory thanks be to God that gives
[1:24:17] us a victory I mean I've got a crown of
[1:24:19] life amen waiting me on the other side
[1:24:22] and not only me but all those that love
[1:24:24] his glorious appearing amen and now I
[1:24:26] just don't understand he goes to the
[1:24:28] chopping block he puts down his head
[1:24:30] willingly he's got a smile on his face
[1:24:32] because he realized in a few moments
[1:24:34] Halu the one he met him on the road to
[1:24:37] Damascus amen that life has so impacted
[1:24:40] him it's gonna take him to Glory
[1:24:42] Hallelujah and he died in Victory and I
[1:24:45] don't understand it it's not right this
[1:24:46] is death speaking now because we
[1:24:47] understand it right
[1:24:49] and I've tried this thing and I've tried
[1:24:51] to do the same for 2 000 years I fed
[1:24:54] them to Lions but they went willingly I
[1:24:57] tortured them but yet they rejoiced amen
[1:24:59] I I I killed their children in front of
[1:25:01] them I did all kinds of horrible things
[1:25:03] but yet but yet I could not make them
[1:25:05] fear death anymore why because God takes
[1:25:07] away the fear of death amen if you have
[1:25:10] a fear of death this morning let him
[1:25:12] take it from you let him settle it
[1:25:15] because he settled it that down Calvary
[1:25:16] while he go to Calvary he says I want my
[1:25:19] children to know
[1:25:21] you don't need to fear death
[1:25:23] you don't need to fear hell you don't
[1:25:24] need to fear judgment I took her that
[1:25:26] down Calvary amen that you can go up
[1:25:28] into Glory so you don't need to fear
[1:25:30] death Hallelujah and then now so so
[1:25:33] death has never been the same again
[1:25:37] he's never been the same all he can do
[1:25:39] is Buzz around
[1:25:41] and torment us in our minds try to
[1:25:44] but then when you think of that day that
[1:25:45] life impacted you
[1:25:47] Hallelujah remember God doesn't just
[1:25:49] meet us one time and that's it and now
[1:25:51] you work it out no life so impacts us
[1:25:54] and then he guides us like Enoch like
[1:25:57] David like all the Believers down
[1:25:58] through that like Paul he guides us all
[1:26:00] the way down
[1:26:02] amen now what can we say about this
[1:26:04] thing I'm just wanting to come to my
[1:26:06] closing remarks here this morning
[1:26:09] what can we say about this what should
[1:26:11] this do to us if we really look it in
[1:26:14] the face and say our lord Jesus is taken
[1:26:17] care we've been so impacted by eternal
[1:26:20] life remember it's not emotionally how
[1:26:22] you feel what's happened in your soul I
[1:26:24] mean what's actually your life has
[1:26:25] changed Direction what's happened life
[1:26:27] has impacted you
[1:26:28] so what can we say to this now if life
[1:26:31] saw impacted all the Believers down
[1:26:33] Through the Ages
[1:26:35] that it has kept them it has guided them
[1:26:38] it has healed them it has watched over
[1:26:40] them what about you and I this morning
[1:26:43] what about today
[1:26:45] amen if we could if we could you know
[1:26:47] death could say he was never the same he
[1:26:49] thought he had the Lord Jesus
[1:26:51] but death could not hold him the grave
[1:26:53] could not keep him amen hell could not
[1:26:56] contain him amen he emptied out paradise
[1:26:58] but he wasn't going to stay in Paradise
[1:27:00] amen because remember they all died
[1:27:02] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:27:03] wondering they were impacted by the
[1:27:05] blood of bulls and goats but now the one
[1:27:07] remember that was pointing to the real
[1:27:09] blood and that was given on Calvary amen
[1:27:12] so now that life could impact them in
[1:27:14] its fullness Hallelujah so death could
[1:27:17] not hold him the grave could not keep
[1:27:19] him nothing could contain them
[1:27:20] Hallelujah
[1:27:22] and he did all that because of his love
[1:27:24] towards you and I amen when Adam and Eve
[1:27:27] fell in the garden Love Came chasing
[1:27:29] them amen that's why the voice of God
[1:27:31] came down in the garden to find us
[1:27:33] because he knew something had happened
[1:27:34] he knew they had fallen he wasn't
[1:27:36] surprised but what happened love came
[1:27:38] down into the garden amen and loved
[1:27:41] clothed him and lambskins
[1:27:43] I mean then they walked out of they
[1:27:45] walked out of Eden
[1:27:47] with a shadow pointing to a redeemer
[1:27:50] because the seed of the woman was going
[1:27:52] to come and under everything right amen
[1:27:54] so so love
[1:27:55] cover this in amen and then now what
[1:27:59] happened on Calvary that was God's love
[1:28:01] manifested amen God so loved the world
[1:28:04] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:28:06] whosoever should believe in him should
[1:28:07] not Pierce but have eternal life
[1:28:09] everlasting life that was God's love
[1:28:12] Hallelujah
[1:28:14] and when we can and then we can say now
[1:28:16] when the love of God I mean when God's
[1:28:19] life finds us
[1:28:21] we can say the love of God has found us
[1:28:25] like the Welsh Revival
[1:28:27] and we'll sing it at the end they would
[1:28:29] they would write a song Heroes love us
[1:28:31] as the ocean
[1:28:33] loving kindness is the flood that was
[1:28:35] that was the song written out of the
[1:28:36] Welsh Revival because they realized that
[1:28:39] love had found them or life they had
[1:28:41] been impacted by eternal life and now
[1:28:43] that was their response to what had
[1:28:45] happened I'd say that you know here is
[1:28:47] love because they realized they had
[1:28:49] found love they had found rather the
[1:28:51] love of God had found them
[1:28:54] praise the Lord
[1:28:56] amen so now what does this what does
[1:28:58] this all do to us when we take all this
[1:29:00] into consideration what does it do amen
[1:29:03] I trust that we can now realize
[1:29:06] that they that the Christian faith is
[1:29:09] based solidly upon rest and I thought
[1:29:12] that's why I come to this point our
[1:29:15] whole walk because when you receive the
[1:29:16] Holy Ghost you enter into rest right and
[1:29:18] that rest is the true baptism of the
[1:29:20] Holy Ghost so at first you're stressed
[1:29:22] you're worried you're trying to do
[1:29:24] things trying to please God your own
[1:29:25] strength and this and pray this much and
[1:29:27] listen this much and do all these things
[1:29:28] this much but then when you meet and
[1:29:30] when life impacts you just like the
[1:29:33] Apostle Paul he was trying to do
[1:29:34] everything in his own strength as a
[1:29:35] Pharisee
[1:29:36] insincerity right but then he entered
[1:29:38] into rest on the road to Damascus amen
[1:29:41] he realized what it was like to cease
[1:29:42] from his own works it was now life was
[1:29:45] now doing the work through him living
[1:29:47] the Christian life amen so he realized
[1:29:49] now that the Christian walk of faith is
[1:29:52] based solidly upon rest I mean that's
[1:29:55] right amen it's not see a Christian is
[1:29:58] not tossed about
[1:29:59] a Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:30:01] place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume
[1:30:04] and worry about things amen a Christian
[1:30:06] rest it's all over it's all finished for
[1:30:09] the believer at Calvary this is from why
[1:30:10] people are so tossed about I mean that's
[1:30:12] right oh sickness may come in
[1:30:13] disappointments but a Christian's at
[1:30:16] rest knowing this that God's able to
[1:30:18] keep that which he has performed knowing
[1:30:21] that no matter what the thing is and how
[1:30:22] it looks there's neither sickness sorrow
[1:30:24] death there's neither starvation or
[1:30:26] anything then can separate us from the
[1:30:28] love of God that's in Jesus Christ Our
[1:30:30] Lord we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship
[1:30:33] toss any way she wants to The Anchor
[1:30:36] Holds amen so so I believe his whole
[1:30:39] life now is is based upon rest amen CeCe
[1:30:43] win a Believer comes in contact with
[1:30:45] life with God himself he rests in God's
[1:30:49] ability to keep his word and to fulfill
[1:30:51] it in their lives amen you rest it's not
[1:30:54] how's this going to work and no no you
[1:30:56] rest in his ability see that's why we
[1:30:58] enter into rest because it's no longer
[1:30:59] us trying to do it it's now him doing it
[1:31:01] in US amen
[1:31:04] amen so now when you come into it's like
[1:31:06] brother Ben when he spoke about Anna
[1:31:08] because because we could come down go
[1:31:09] down into the temple sorry
[1:31:12] sorry
[1:31:16] Anna was impacted by life she was all
[1:31:20] blind prophetess but life came her way
[1:31:21] saying I'm in the temple here right now
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:25] and brother bam says you can't be in
[1:31:27] spiritual contact with God and ever
[1:31:29] doubt anything he said in his word
[1:31:31] why because you've come in contact with
[1:31:33] life
[1:31:34] amen so so when you when you come into
[1:31:37] this rest now you rest in his ability to
[1:31:40] keep his word and to fulfill it in our
[1:31:42] lives amen we rest in God's leadership
[1:31:45] to guide us through all troubles and
[1:31:47] trials a resting on those things I mean
[1:31:50] you can rest in his leadership because
[1:31:51] he is our Shepherd amen we rest in God's
[1:31:54] Deliverance to set us free from every
[1:31:56] trap of the devil amen from every
[1:31:59] complex pain fear and worry we rest in
[1:32:02] God's Deliverance his power amen and
[1:32:05] that's why he died on Calvary to release
[1:32:07] us from all bondage amen from all all
[1:32:10] sin all Pride all trying to be the big
[1:32:13] shot all trying to be this and that
[1:32:14] whatever it is he set us free from all
[1:32:16] those things
[1:32:18] we rest in God's provision to provide us
[1:32:21] all of our needs amen we rest in God's
[1:32:25] power to save our families
[1:32:27] praise the lord we rest remember we're
[1:32:28] resting doesn't matter what's happening
[1:32:30] on the outside we're resting in God
[1:32:32] you're able to keep your word amen God
[1:32:35] just like you're able to put food on the
[1:32:36] table you're able to save our families
[1:32:38] amen we rest in his ability to do what
[1:32:42] we think is naturally impossible
[1:32:45] amen sometimes we think there's no way
[1:32:47] it could ever happen but no we rest in
[1:32:48] his ability
[1:32:49] amen we rest in God's we rest in the
[1:32:53] power of God's blood amen we are saved
[1:32:56] by the blood alone are you resting in
[1:32:58] that amen amen
[1:33:02] see it's not it's not the blood
[1:33:03] salvation is not the blood and our good
[1:33:05] works that's what the Methodist had that
[1:33:07] idea because they were armenianism
[1:33:09] because of yeah churches swung to
[1:33:12] Calvinism just if you if you're there
[1:33:14] you're there not there in their extreme
[1:33:15] predestination and so it was swung the
[1:33:17] other way but now we've come back into
[1:33:19] the middle of the road
[1:33:20] amen amen so we're resting in the power
[1:33:23] of God's blood alone amen we plead the
[1:33:26] blood see when we come into trouble what
[1:33:27] do you do you plead the blood Lord I
[1:33:29] need your blood to cover me Lord I need
[1:33:31] the power of your blood to come into my
[1:33:33] life in a greater way amen Lord we have
[1:33:35] sickness in the body Lord what do you do
[1:33:37] you plead the blood
[1:33:38] however he leads you remember he's the
[1:33:40] Healer ultimately if he uses doctors
[1:33:42] music prayer whatever it may be but
[1:33:44] still he's the Healer but you'll be led
[1:33:46] right amen see so someone who's not
[1:33:49] resting in God's power
[1:33:50] thinks they have to inject their own
[1:33:52] works and to Merit anything from the
[1:33:54] Lord
[1:33:55] that's not resting
[1:33:57] see humans always want to do what they
[1:33:59] can do
[1:34:00] but no we should be resting in his
[1:34:02] ability what what does that mean I just
[1:34:04] don't need to read the Bible and I just
[1:34:05] quit no you seek his face
[1:34:07] with all your heart you love him with
[1:34:09] all remember worship is not singing Only
[1:34:12] worship is a life
[1:34:14] how we treat our families should be a
[1:34:16] worship how we treat one another should
[1:34:17] be a worship how we treat the people on
[1:34:20] the street it should be a worship
[1:34:21] well giving glory to God and everything
[1:34:24] we do
[1:34:27] amen so we don't want to try and we
[1:34:29] don't need to earn anything God's paid
[1:34:32] it all see Calvary paid paid for every
[1:34:34] promise
[1:34:35] Hallelujah amen but we must rest in his
[1:34:39] ability to bring his word to pass
[1:34:41] amen see it's just like Moses when he
[1:34:44] was put in the put in the ark you know
[1:34:46] in the nail put in that little Reed
[1:34:48] basket
[1:34:49] Amen Brother Bear says it's like little
[1:34:51] Moses out there looking up towards the
[1:34:53] Starlet skies at night when the wind is
[1:34:55] blowing and Howling across the places
[1:34:56] the old dial jumping and crocodiles
[1:34:59] going near the basket Hallelujah safe
[1:35:00] and protected standing between there was
[1:35:03] an atonement between him and all the
[1:35:04] gals and heavy winds and the dead that
[1:35:06] the devil could send nothing could upset
[1:35:08] that little Ark he floated right on
[1:35:10] through I can see it great I can see the
[1:35:12] great holy spirit standing above it I
[1:35:15] can see the angels of God sitting near
[1:35:17] with their sword straw no sir nothing's
[1:35:19] going to touch it I can see the devil
[1:35:21] trying to sink the ark up there and Noah
[1:35:22] singing Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross
[1:35:24] whatever it was all the devils and Hell
[1:35:26] couldn't take it because it was built
[1:35:27] according to God's instructions there's
[1:35:29] an atonement made between judgment and
[1:35:31] mercy that's every believer today no
[1:35:33] matter how hard it may seem how hard
[1:35:35] life may seem as long as you're in
[1:35:37] Christ Jesus there's nothing present
[1:35:39] there's nothing future can can reach
[1:35:41] your soul and separate us from the love
[1:35:42] of God in Christ Jesus amen the devil
[1:35:44] will turn every gal and Hell loose on
[1:35:47] you but God has got an atonement
[1:35:49] standing between you you'll float every
[1:35:51] wave you'll go through every alligator
[1:35:53] bed so just like Moses taking from the
[1:35:56] Nile there he went through alligator
[1:35:58] beds all kinds of troubles but there was
[1:36:00] you know brother dramatizes God says
[1:36:02] Gabriel stand on this Ark amen if any
[1:36:04] crocodile comes just go kick him in the
[1:36:06] nose and he puts Angels down every
[1:36:08] either side of the nail aiming to
[1:36:10] protect Moses to get him to where he
[1:36:12] needs to go amen now if God can look out
[1:36:15] after a baby and an alligator infested
[1:36:17] nail can't he protect us on life's
[1:36:20] journey through this demon-infested
[1:36:22] world Amen because remember he knows
[1:36:24] where we're gonna go right so we can
[1:36:26] trust in him doesn't matter how bad
[1:36:28] you're like who's in like National
[1:36:30] Geographic you know you see like a river
[1:36:32] or you see a lake
[1:36:34] there's more crocodiles in there than
[1:36:36] water
[1:36:37] have you seen that it's like man
[1:36:39] are you sure there's a lake here all I
[1:36:41] see is crocodile right now Moses could
[1:36:43] have literally gone over all of those
[1:36:47] he wasn't going to get eaten he had to
[1:36:49] get to the pharaoh's Palace
[1:36:52] Hallelujah because God remember it's not
[1:36:54] because his mother said Lord may he get
[1:36:56] this because God said I I'm going to put
[1:36:58] him there I'm going to nothing can
[1:37:01] change what I've said it's the same
[1:37:03] thing with you and I we can be literally
[1:37:04] walking on alligators
[1:37:07] the devil's right we can be literally in
[1:37:09] the worst part of the river
[1:37:11] this is this is the place you don't go
[1:37:13] swimming but yet somehow we find
[1:37:14] ourselves God's led us into this
[1:37:16] infested place
[1:37:18] we as safe as safe can be
[1:37:20] oh yeah we can rest see can we rest in
[1:37:24] his protection remember nothing can harm
[1:37:26] us to God nothing can take us from this
[1:37:28] world into God's purpose is done amen
[1:37:31] doesn't matter what comes against us
[1:37:33] nothing can take us to God's purposes
[1:37:34] done hallelujah so we can rest we can
[1:37:37] rest in his protection we can rest in
[1:37:40] his leadership we can rest in his power
[1:37:42] to save and deliver amen we'll go
[1:37:45] through every alligator bed but we won't
[1:37:47] stay there
[1:37:48] oh Lou so I've got to read a few more
[1:37:49] here
[1:37:51] see he says in an absolute and to me
[1:37:54] it's a very powerful powerful service
[1:37:56] because he takes in the absolute one of
[1:37:58] them he'd take nothing can separate us
[1:38:00] from the love of Christ
[1:38:02] nothing he says now that becomes an
[1:38:04] absolute when you when life impacts you
[1:38:07] you realize that nothing can separate
[1:38:09] you from the love of God
[1:38:10] nothing can
[1:38:12] Hallelujah amen so now he says here
[1:38:16] he says now without controversy first
[1:38:19] Timothy 3 16 great is the mystery of
[1:38:21] godliness for God was manifested in the
[1:38:22] flesh scene of angels received up into
[1:38:25] Glory he was God come to take the
[1:38:26] sinner's place yes sir and when God
[1:38:28] raised him up on the third day for our
[1:38:30] justification therefore exalted at the
[1:38:33] right hand of the Majesty on high he is
[1:38:34] an intercessor to make intercessions for
[1:38:37] our weaknesses as we confess it to him
[1:38:41] and die out to ourself placing his word
[1:38:44] placing his word back in us the promise
[1:38:46] and our faith makes the world live
[1:38:48] because Christ is in us the quickener of
[1:38:51] the word amen so when his life comes
[1:38:53] into US was that we get the faith of God
[1:38:57] does that mean amen but what happens is
[1:38:59] he now quickens the word in our lives he
[1:39:02] says how I wish the church could see
[1:39:04] that all arguments and strife would be
[1:39:06] over that would be the Supreme Court
[1:39:08] that's the North Star Hallelujah that's
[1:39:11] the end of all Strife that's the end of
[1:39:12] all questions I mean that's the end of
[1:39:15] everything God said so that's the
[1:39:16] absolute tie yourself to it Paul said
[1:39:19] there's nothing present nothing future
[1:39:20] death sickness nakedness Peril nothing
[1:39:23] can separate us from that we're tied to
[1:39:25] an absolute for me to live as Christ to
[1:39:28] die is gay nothing else holds but that
[1:39:30] there this that is the absolute amen so
[1:39:35] when we come to that place we realize
[1:39:36] that he is our absolute that he puts a
[1:39:39] faith in our lives to Quicken his word
[1:39:42] in our lives and he makes intercession
[1:39:45] on our behalf what happens then all
[1:39:47] arguments and strife should be over all
[1:39:51] worry all trouble should be over because
[1:39:54] why he is making indecision on our
[1:39:56] behalf that's what life does life
[1:39:58] intercedes life and deceits amen
[1:40:02] Hallelujah and he comes and quickens his
[1:40:04] word in our lives and makes it live
[1:40:07] amen so therefore all argument and
[1:40:09] strife would be over if we could just
[1:40:11] see that maybe I've maybe I've a lack of
[1:40:14] language to to to put it across but if
[1:40:16] we had such faith in God I believe we do
[1:40:19] if we're such rest in him
[1:40:21] then all of it and then we've been
[1:40:23] impacted by life well not all arguments
[1:40:25] are Strife be over yeah am I going to
[1:40:27] make it am I not going to make it am I
[1:40:29] going to well has life impacted you has
[1:40:32] his word impacted you
[1:40:34] well then all Stripes should be over
[1:40:37] amen well then what do you do now walk
[1:40:39] in Victory
[1:40:40] walk in Victory in life
[1:40:42] why because death is swallowed up in
[1:40:45] Victory amen that the Stinger of death
[1:40:47] is gone we can walk free amen he's taken
[1:40:50] all fear out of our hearts you say well
[1:40:51] I'm afraid don't be caught up in fear
[1:40:54] the Devil Went no look at what God has
[1:40:56] done amen look at his promises amen he's
[1:40:59] look at his love towards us he hasn't
[1:41:01] put us on the earth to condemn us no
[1:41:03] he's put us on the earth to redeem us
[1:41:05] because we're part of him and if we
[1:41:08] realize we're part of him that we could
[1:41:09] just Rejoice say thank you for this
[1:41:11] thank you for Easter thank you for
[1:41:13] Calvary thank you for your atoning blood

[1:41:45] blood I mean don't look at what you see
[1:41:46] with your natural eye don't be caught up
[1:41:48] in fusses in discontentment and trouble
[1:41:50] look at his promises I mean rest in his
[1:41:53] ability amen his ability will get us
