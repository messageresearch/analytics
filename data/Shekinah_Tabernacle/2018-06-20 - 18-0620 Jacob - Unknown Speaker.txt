thank you for Isaac I may praise the Lord it's good to see everyone here tonight amen there's glad to be a Christian hallelujah amen if you got your Bibles handy let's go to I mean let's go to the book of Genesis Genesis chapter 28 I read from verse 10 now I've been reading through the through the Bible from the beginning and I mean it's been it's been a blessing Genesis 28 verse 10 this is Jacob after he flees from from Esau his brother after he's got the birthright seized and Jacob went out from Beersheba and went towards Haran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the Sun was set and he took up the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a letter was set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham my father and and the god of Isaac the land were upon their last to thee will I give it and to thy seed and to thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and all thy and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places where thou goest and will bring there get into this land for I will not leave the until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of amen licious bow heads at a word of Prayer gracious father we're so thankful Lord for your supernatural presence Lord we thank you that this Christianity that we so love it's not a natural religion of idols and stone and wood and man's ideas of man's theology but it's a supernatural faith Lord and we so glad it's been Lord that faith that was once delivered to the Saints has been restored to us father what a praise you Lord this night as we gather here Lord I pray father would be like Jacob here on the way to to his father's kindred Lord how heaven opened father and he saw a vision of you in a dream and Lord it became more than just a law it became something very special to him father Lord heaven open to him Lord I pray father that Lord as we have this time together Lord may heaven open father Lord we know we do not wait Lord we walk by faith and not by sight so father may you quicken our faith Lord increase our faith Lord to take you at your word and father may you be at those who couldn't make it tonight Lord be there portion you just want to commit the service into your hands Lord just Lord manifest yourself among us for your glory father we commit the service into your hands and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends you may you may have your seats I mean it's great to have the Clifford's back a man praise the Lord trust he had a good time to the West amen so I'd like to if I could entitle this anything I want to talk about heaven opening and our walkers by faith and not by sight now we have Jacob here here he is just you know he's had to flee from everything he knew because in him was the he wanted the birthright you know his name Jacob means supplanter and he was willing to do anything he had to do to get the birthright he could he knew it was more than just a natural blessing I mean he knew it was more than just a natural blessing but there was a supernatural element tied into that birthright and he was willing to even forsake himself you know we won't read it but if you go read the previous chapter you know he dresses up like his brother Esau cuz Esau was the eldest eldest son and the birthright always went to the firstborn so he wasn't even entitled to anything but he knew that you know something enemy said I must get this and so he was willing to deny himself I meant he he knew he wasn't worthy he knew he wasn't even you know entitled to this birthright maybe like we may feel we're not worthy of heaven we're not worthy of being a believer I mean but we don't need to look at ourselves but all we need to do is deny ourselves amen and come amen come to the Lord and say Lord I want the birthright I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost I want God to come down and live in me they mean so so he dressed up like his older brother who by natural birth should have received it and he any and he comes into the presence of us of his brother you know of his father and his father Isaac was a prophet I mean God visited him he knew God so a prophet now a prophet only knows what God tells them just like Elijah with the Shunammite woman the Shunammite woman's son has died you know I think maybe he got sunstroke because he happened to feel this is our my head and he gets taken back laid on the bed and he dies and and so but that but the mother of that Sun the Shunammite woman she said I've got to get to the Prophet because he was the one who said I would have the son now I have the son I meant and then Surnow now Elisha sees the shooter might woman coming and he doesn't know what's going on he says to a servant i don't know God hasn't told me and then and then as soon as you know a woman gets a hold of that property holds on to him I mean I won't let you go hallelujah so so now we must be like Jacob Jacob just like us old of all the brother he he he put on his older brothers clothes you know he dressed like him he denied who he was his his his blood and father who God could have told him at any time this is actually Jacob even he says to him you sound like Jacob but you feel like Esau I assure you Esau he says and Jacobs voice I'm Esau amen so so he denied himself he says no I'm not I'm not the one who's not worthy I'm the worthy one he took on as you could say his older brothers righteousness your take on the Lords righteousness come to him say I am worthy I'm entitled to this Aliyah what he wanted and at anytime God could have said to his father this is Jacob but yet he came anyway he's willing to override his fear cast aside his fear cast aside his own self worth of not even being able to get it he didn't he cast down his own identity took on his brother's identity and got the birthright but Esau was a natural man he wasn't you know he was hungry you know I was thinking it you know when I read this yesterday here's Esau he comes into the camp you know he's so hungry he feels like he's gonna die there wasn't just you know him his brother and his parents in that camp it was a big camp he could have got food somewhere else right buddy but he esteemed it so lightly the birthright he says just give me some food what's the birthright worth me you know and he and he just sold it for a mess of pottage right he esteemed it so lightly we don't want to esteem God dwelling in us lightly I mean the promise of heaven lightly walking in victory lightly we don't want to steep those things lightly I mean so he sold his birthright and he and he couldn't get it back and then Jacob received the birthright now when Jacob received the birthright heaven opened to him after this he never had this kind of dream before until after he received the birthright heaven came open where it was more than his father story of you know Isaac maybe telling telling him when his father Abraham took him up the hill you know to sacrifice him on the altar or whatever more it became more than his father story became his testimony amen and we know Christianity is this an experience right it's not a knowledge or learning in this experience because the same God that was there in Genesis is the same God today I mean he's the same one we can meet we can they meet him we can meet him and that's the very reason he died she had his blood upon the earth that had reconciled us to him hallelujah so heaven came open to him did he think about this before this dream he was running to his father's you know family they're on the run and all he saw was natural things but then it's very different when you when you say yes I'm a believer but then when God comes down quick that faith vindicates your faith to you that's a very different thing because here comes Jacob he's he's on the run and then God gives him this dream and he says I'll give you this land you'll return to this place again and I will not leave thee until I have done that which I've spoken to the off there's what we just read in verse 15 I will not leave you till I've done this promise hallelujah and and we can we can take that same scripture and God is here present because he will not leave his bride until he has fulfilled everything he has spoken of her I mean so a victorious walk I will not leave thee until I've given you a victorious walk overcoming power that's why you got to look at the life behind the belief and because many people have different kind of belief but it's dead I mean but those where the life lives that's where you want to take notice Jesus didn't speak like any other man he didn't speak like the scribes and the learn at once he spoke in parables and mysteries and different things but God was manifested through that life hallelujah he says all not leaves in I I will not leave until I have done that which I've spoken to the earth I trusted that that means something to you I mean when you see the things you may be facing he didn't know what he was going to find it as it is at his relatives place he didn't know when he'd be you have to return and face Easter again he didn't know what he was going to find but God said I'll not leave me till I will do it what I've spoken to the earth hallelujah and you know this is how I walk should be amen there's brother brand preached a sermon wisdom verses verses faith he talks about the devil's reasoning wisdom verses faith the devil tries to reason yay hath God seed and man tries to reason but God just gives faith he quickens his word remember this is a supernatural gospel we serve a supernatural God and we have a supernatural word and there's a supernatural walk and we're going to a supernatural heaven amen this is what generally the supernatural religion it's not a natural religion I mean this this message is not a natural message it's a supernatural message this is a supernatural book this is a supernatural book and God gives us children faith to manifest the promise in this word hallelujah where where Jacob had to fulfill his portion of the word and now the bride many thousands of years later I don't know how long they will fulfill her portion I mean where you've got to recognize your hair to manifest the promise word for the day Jesus says for this cause I've come into the world hallelujah he knew who he was that's why when the devil came against them I mean the devil was defeated it is written the word says it is written devil comes back it is written the word says it's also written the reason he could stand upon that word is because in you who he was he knew he wasn't just from Nazareth or from Galilee or he knew wasn't Joseph's and Mary's son he was God in flesh he was the Word made manifest he knew he was the son of God that's how he could overcome right and God wants you and yes he's in Corinthians it says that that we would know as we are knowing right that we would know as God knows us amen that you know it's not just us stumbling into something you know but God in His great mercy NUI you would be knew how old you'd be your condition you would be and the mind battles you may have or whatever more he doesn't he wasn't worried about that in you and you'd steered you right as an unseen hand was steering you to a particular point in life because he wanted to get your attention Amen the woman of the world she had to be at the world she had to be in that condition because Jesus had to go by that way hallelujah you're the man in the terms he had to be there the maniac had to be in the terms in that condition hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad that God God for Danes our life he knows where we walk he knows the mountains we go through the valleys whatever it is he knows where we go hallelujah amen he knew that Mary Magdalene would have seven Devils in her it didn't bother him because he knew he had the power to get her out amen and that's why you know the devil he thinks he's the best warden in the world best best jailer Supermax security prison that's nothing to God you want to see the Great Escape we've escaped hallelujah and we're not just running into the trees we're running into heaven hallelujah oh you know we're just not running into the wilderness trying to escape the the you know the hounds of hell and the prison dogs and the gods or whatever more we're going up into glory hallelujah do you know where your destination lies I trust you dress has been anchored in your soul there's a rapture for me this body's going to be changed doesn't matter what state it may be our may be a tetraplegic in a wheelchair in a moment of twinkling of an eye all get out of that wheelchair hallelujah amen so we have to we have to have such confidence friends this Bible this word that we believe is a supernatural word this is a supernatural faith this is not a natural faith I mean we're now Jacob he had a visitation of heaven and that changed his life because before that he was just worrying about his brother and maybe where he was and I don't know how many days journey it is he's just caught up in natural things natural things but then heaven opened to them and then when heaven opens to someone that's all that matters because it gives me gives your faith where you can walk by that faith you don't walk by sight and what my candle man may say in their understanding I'm not walking like that I'm walking by faith hallelujah because we walk by faith and not by sight Amen I'm so glad we walk that kind of way so now you know I I was y'all be thinking this past week if we could just look past the curtain a time amen it would change our entire lives right where heaven is not way up beyond the Milky Way in some place it's present I mean where where God is here his angels are here the redeemed awaiting I mean they're waiting for us to take our place and take a rapture because without us they're not made perfect not made complete hallelujah if we can just look past the curtain of time I think would blow away a lot of cobwebs hallelujah and that's why God comes and he visits us any any any quickens his word hallelujah makes it alive amen he anoints you hallelujah what is that that's beyond the curtain of time reaching down that's eternity reaching to you trying to get you your Jesus was walking along he said who touched me there's a woman who had a blood a shooter if I could just touch the hem of government who touched me we need to actually flip it around and say who touched me right because once upon a time I was I was in the world I was lost I was undone I had to go to Anglican Church Presbyterian Church different kind of church at boarding school didn't do me any good but one day I heard a voice holy and something gripped me and I should have really said who touched me who's got a hold of my life it wasn't me it wasn't what I wanted to do I didn't want it I wanted my first kid to lose my friends are scared to lose whatever I thought I had but you anyway you know but something touched me what touched me and you've got to go back to those kind of moments and think who touched me who touched me when I heard that voice who touched me when the wood became open what touch you it wasn't man wasn't just your this is culture or something that seems a little bit better nicer kind of religion knows Almighty God I mean he is still the High Priestess touched by the feeling of our infirmities and sometimes we don't even know what we need hallelujah something touched me and made me whole amen you know the real vindication of the Resurrection the upper room the book of Acts church God came they didn't walk out of the book of yo you know then walk out of the upper room with an argument a polis had an argument he proved from the scripture that Jesus was the Christ there's an ex 1819 but then it took the Apostle Paul to comments and bring him in to present truth you know he was a devout Jew he was a believer but he only had this much he only had a natural understanding then the Apostle Paul's comes to him have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed we haven't heard about this Connor what are you talking about a Holy Spirit coming and dwelling in a people manifesting his word I mean through we haven't we haven't heard of this well how he baptized under John's baptism that was goodness day but God's moved on and they'll rebaptised enable Lord Jesus Christ they laid hands upon them and God filled them hallelujah those a vindication that's there was the vindication that Jesus was the Christ because the same life there was in him was down them I mean what's the vindication this is actually not man's writing as they close the author that wrote this book comes and lives in you hallelujah that's the vindication you want to see the proof people want to look at science it's all very well no this becomes flesh that's the real proof you want proof Christianity is real this manifest hallelujah contrary to people's cattle ancient country to their understanding contrary to what they were God comes and lives in me amen oh yeah isn't that right isn't that right there's a supernatural gospel it's not a natural gospel Paul said I do not come to you with man's wisdom right man's wisdom and understanding he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he could have put it all together just real nice pieces I don't come to you like that I come to you empower and demonstration of the Holy Ghost because the gospel is not word early but power partly a powder overcome the devil powder cast them out I meant powder overcome this flesh holy a powder overcome that's in nature you're born with a man to heal the sick raise the dead word or maybe that is the gospel we have hallelujah and we've got to lean upon that right we've got to depend upon him hallelujah do you think his his Jacob he said it was a fearful place to be but now is Almighty Jehovah's with me it would have changed them it would change you well nuts change you the God that my father spoke about now my god I don't worship by association now I can really worship now I can really praise him cuz he's come down and said I'll do this for you I'll manifest my word through you you're the one who's going to fulfill the prophecy you're gonna be part of my me coming down into flesh hallelujah and now he comes and looks at you you know this bride is a supernatural bride hallelujah have you looked at yourself I mean you gotta say I'm a supernatural believer I mean I'm not a natural de kado believer i'm a supernatural believer cuz it was a supernatural God that got a hold of me hallelujah Amen and he's not a one-time experience kind of God constant fellowship I've been rejoicing to myself about their constant fellowship we're not like the high priest if I repeat myself to say he's getting old constant fellowship I'm in the high priest win and once a year with the blood and fair and tribulation if I don't do this just right over and sprinkle this on here just right if I don't walk just right I'm gonna die and we don't come in haphazardly saying what's up pop of God and you know we come in with reverence do we walk with reverence we should walk with reverence hallelujah but now it's not just once a year and then go out and wasn't that wonderful that's always don't go out of the curtain children don't go out he doesn't want you to go out and to thee and to the and to the inner Court of the outer court around to the world he wants you to dwell continually in his presence hallelujah that's what he wants that's why he died hallelujah amen Allu you Jacob but Jacob had to come to a place jacob had to be changed in a visitation but he had his nature had to be changed right and that's what has to happen many times like we never camp experience and then we leave that camp experience but you got to state it till you changed right so more than just being anointed one time but they said it just being an auntie comes and dwells in you right so here's Jacob and he gets his wives and he you know gets all you know you know he goes to us you know his um family's house father's house gets married you know this does everyone know Sunday school does everyone know your Bible you know the story but then he comes back he comes back to his inheritance but he's still Jacob he's still a supplanter he's got to be changed if he wants to dwell in his inheritance he can't be a supplanter because we're not here to supplant we're here to rule right we're not a squatter right we're not here just to squat you know just to other so I'm gonna try and get this and cheat some out of it no this is mine right but in order for that to be our nature has to be changed right so he had to come to a point where he had to let go of everything you think his brother's across the river with I can't forgive me if I'm not sure it was 200 or 400 men off the top of my head they're armed he's got an army the last time he saw this brother II his brother wanted to kill him when his father died he chief me he cheated her he cheated his brother and now he's coming back hasn't seen him for I don't know how many 14 years or however long it was seven years for one wife seven years for the other and then he doesn't know what's going to happen God gets you in a spot god knows how to get you to it's you and you have nothing to hide behind and you've got a because they send his wife yo-yo he tried to bribe his brother I'll see in livestock and yeah I know who that'll work because he's got a big army he's probably got a lot of livestock I said my family's I said my wives and children before me you know to uh maybe maybe he'll feel sorry for me we seized his own family but they no but then he was going to cross the river himself and God meet him and he wrestled with God I won't leave let you go till you bless me this was Jacob he needed he knew he needed something to dwell in the land right he needed a change and so he wrestles with God all night I'll not let you go till you bless me and then so now God touches his leg changes how he walks Holly it changed his walk upon the earth I don't know how uh supplanter walks I'm not gonna try but then after after God touched his leg changed his name you know more you're no longer Jacob I'm not gonna call you church anymore I'll call you bride hallelujah what could he touch anymore brother brass is the first he'll show you understand you no longer church I'm going to call you bride hallelujah and so he changes the name from Jacob to Israel prince with God hallelujah royalty I'm in a son in the kingdom hallelujah amen and that's and that's why you know it's so amazing when Elijah is on Mount Carmel he praise you're the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel didn't say Abraham Isaac and Jacob Abraham Isaac and Israel hallelujah the Prince hallelujah amen and so that's what he does with that that's what he has to do with you I trust he's done that Amen that he's changed you change your walk change how you walk upon they're not I'm not talking about a natural you can have the same stride or the same limp or whatever you have I don't know same spring not talking about that but it's your your Christian walk upon the earth he has to change that he's got to change your identity right because when you think of a name you think of a life you think of Moses what do you think about ten commandments Mount Sinai plagues in Egypt all those things think of Jesus you think of our Lord hanging on Calvary the Apostle Paul you think of missionary journeys you know because the life is identified in the name so that's why I had to change his name from Jacob to Israel right to change his life like Abraham to Abraham Sarah - Sarah right had to change their names because God so I'm gonna change you you're gonna live a new kind of life Alleluia and so he has to do the same thing with us and then finally he comes across the river everything's been stripped of him he actually has to let it go wrestles with God he's now changed then meets his brother as a changed man here comes the prince this place Allu you I mean where the natural carnal church has no dominion over him anymore he still has fellowship with them he saw was the carnal natural man Jacob or now his role as a spiritual man but now he has dominion he's a prince with God and his whole life was different that's what has to happen that angel remember this Jesus Christ is not a collection of ideas the truth is not just a collection of ideas the truth is a person the person is Jesus Christ he is I am the way the truth and the life he's a person right we have to meet him I mean that's why we have church that we can meet him I mean that's why we have a Wednesday because we've come through a few days we need a judge hallelujah and it's so wonderful because because a believer is like a genuine a genuine electric socket a genuine why that electricity can go through and we're plugged into the sauce amen we're where God says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen I'm your father amen hallelujah I'm your Redeemer amen amen amen he sees his word when he when he shows us would you say Amen I'll take care of you Amen all right something and you should say Amen something not this thing oh you know down here yes I'm your Redeemer yes I'm your comforter yes I'm your guy yes I'm your counselor yes if any counseling sometimes he'll give the counsel hallelujah he'll guide your steps don't look at what you see look to him the devil will try and distract you he says look at this look at this look at this yeah just like a huzi or yo-yo Elijah's um servant comes out the morning the Syrians are around the city he panics he's looking at natural things so this has men with weapons natural men with natural weapons and he's with a supernatural prophet that knows a supernatural God that that that has done the same anointing that was on you think about Elijah comes to the King King Ahab king ahab because there's the gerardis got a trouble around the land try and find pasture for his for his animals and then Elijah meets them then then I have seriously you know wonder this brought this trouble you're the one who's troubled Israel he's a man one man he's a king you are the one who's troubled this land o king bring you bring you and bring your priests of bale Tam to Mount Carmel we'll see who is God what man nothing goes he comes up Mount Carmel he just lays it down he's not afraid we shouldn't be afraid we shouldn't be afraid of the devil's challenge don't be afraid of Devil's bush doesn't matter how how naturally it may seem hey sit now I'm gonna challenge you you you worship you worship or your prophets of bile all of your man-made theology you worship here then I'll worship the Lord God and don't be between two opinions the one who answers with the fire the one who wants to a supernatural fire he's God Holies the prophets of bail you all know the story don't you class you should read your Bible I trust you do anyway so you know they worship and they and they built the altar and they dancing around 450 of them or 400 and they're and they're worshiping and and Elijah is not intimidated he just makes fun he will all maybe it'll work no he knows he's the god of fire I mean he's the he knows who it is and he says cry little louder maybe he's sleeping maybe pursuing maybe he's doing something and they cut themselves they get all trying and try and get the flesh excited cut themselves and dance and it does no good then he rebuilds the altar of the Lord that had fallen down so the scripture says he revolts the altar you'd have to ride altar I don't care about having some marble Catholic also I want a real altar I mean that's built with rocks of Revelation and he puts the revelation in right places the baptism this is the Godhead this is the way this had to be sanctified this overcoming life this is there's more faith as you're older this is where we're he rebuilds the altar puts down the wood takes to sacrifice amen you gotta become a sacrifice and then and then even to show that my God is supernatural because we've had a drought remember this you know they better drop pour water on I don't know where they got the water for him but they poured a lot of water on and it filled the trench roundabout and then he prays Lord God of Israel Abraham and Isaac I've done all this according to thy word and if the people would know that your God in Israel and thou has turned their hearts back again the fire fell and he wasn't surprised because he did it according to he saw a vision and the vision lived out hallelujah he wasn't surprised it happened the God who answered by fire was the real God and it's the same one today we it's not just a it is a supernatural fire it's the Holy Ghost and fire right and the God and he has answered by that fire right he has answered by that fire I mean I trust you when you read acts 2 you can say I'm one of them that same God came and dwelt in me and he still abides in me hallelujah is not someone else's story I mean not just a one time thing all the time God is in me all the time hallelujah he's answered by fire do we know that that testimony I show you can say I've seen that God he's changed my nature he's birthed me into the kingdom I've been born again not just reformed burst hallelujah see a baby is a baby in a tummy back there it's living in that kind of life but that'll be birthed and it'll grow a whole different kind of life hallelujah it'll do things that knew nothing about in the womb that's like carnal man they know nothing of spiritual things hey you know and then God comes and birthed you you know it's the fun that you couldn't yo you can share testimony but if you could only convey the reality you say and you can bang the reality oh that's supernatural oh yeah that presence that comes down we've had we've had experience we had we've had meetings but we were yeah God come down and you could literally point with your eye he comes down and then he speaks and it happens how lujah that same God is still here I mean they same God sees through this and this and this and happens exactly that way and when people come in contact with that God it changes them he changes them I mean that's what we need not just to do better no be transformed Amen be birthed into the kingdom and you'll find a life that's in you living a very different just like you know my you know most most women have cravings and they want to protect the life that's growing right and and what they may be their food changes things they once loved they can't have and things they couldn't stand now it's all they want because there's a life from them dictating to them this is what I need right and it's the same thing when God comes in and then you begin to realize you begin to walk a bit different yeah I'm gonna look after this life I want this life to grow I don't want it to be stunted I don't want to stagnate I want it to grow fully growing I want to take in vitamins hallelujah not just not just deadly and if I want it to be anointed I want the whole buffet and the seven course seven sealed menu because I want a life to grow olia that's why you know we are the bride is actually sending the world is descending it's falling this world is falling apart that's why that's why we get now you know you first meet the Lord you start growing and then the reason you get more horrified at how bad the Woolsey is because you're going like this is you this is the world the world's going down and it's a bigger Gulf and you get more shocked hallelujah because of the life and you changing how you were amen yeah I'm so glad we can be love prisoners to Jesus Christ right we can be real genuine prisoners where even if we want to do saying something and you says no don't go there I remember being at university there was a there was so I needed to get some money out for a youth camp there are two ATMs on campus one was one was broken the other one was round by the pub I used to frequent way too often I meet the Lord I go to the one that's broken well I don't know what's broken to us on the other side of campus I'll use this one and then it wasn't working so I'll go to the other one I start walking to the other one right by the front door of the pub now I've been delivered of alcohol so I wasn't scared I wasn't saying help me Lord help me help me help me no if he takes the desire it's gone and you can't try and you know there's nothing in you wants it so how can you it's gone that's victory that's deliverance it's not a seven-step Steven 7 step program to overcome its God hallelujah and then so I start walking around there - whether we're the pub wasn't it and the and the other ATM and the voice said God said I do not want to go there he doesn't say you don't want to go they sees I don't want to go there yes Lord I'm not gonna take you there Olu yeah amen and he's the same God today we serve a personal God we serve a personal Living God and it's not just for me it's for everyone right we are all the same in Christ hallelujah amen amen now we have to the Bible says you know we have so many exceeding precious promises and I did say we get the devil tries to distract us if we take our eyes off the Lord and put it on carnal things or natural things if we put our eyes on those things we take our eyes off him and that's what the devil wants you to do he wants you to be distracted what about this and this and this look at this it can just be situations in life my help cometh from the Lord my help doesn't come from me right my help my help doesn't come from me this guy got himself in a lot of trouble and if he has his way he'll continue to get himself in trouble because it you know made on a sheep farm man sheep we are sheep hallelujah we are sheep and if we just decide well I'm gonna be a lone sheep you'll find yourself in someplace and you won't know the way back but the Lord says my sheep know my voice I know my sheep by name my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow right and so it goes beyond so when the devil comes along with us reasoning yes a no that is not the voice of my shepherd amen do you know you know if you know someone's voice really well you know their heart behind that voice right you know their intent behind their voice and it's like the Lord he says my sheep know my voice I'm gonna close with this thought he knows my sheep know my voice is stranger they will not follow right and so they intimately know that voice and they will not follow a stranger I'm just rewording basically what does he bow wants you to you have to have confidence do you know the voice of the shepherd as the ship had come and got you as I said a while ago what touched me what touched you that was the voice of the Shepherd I mean more than just audible Jesus Jesus preached the multitudes how many of them did a grip Amen hit 5,000 then he preaches John Sexy's ended up with just the apostles and one Judas he says it's just a twelve of you one of you is a devil but Peter said to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life it gripped them they all heard the same words but because it is one of the Sheep something in them said this is my shepherd I know his voice I'm not a smart man oh it's just a fisherman that doesn't matter I know the voice of my shepherd he says to whom shall we go thou have the words of eternal life in Jesus and say well done you pass the test he said don't you know I've chosen you one of you is a devil he didn't say which one it was at that time but they were grouped where are we gonna go we have nowhere else to go I'm following this one because he's the great Shepherd hallelujah and it has to be the same thing if God did that in the beginning of the Jin told the sensation he came down and called the Sheep he will do that at the end and I contend he has done that supernatural voices spoken in this day hallelujah amen have you heard the Shepherd's voice have you heard this vindicated manifested amen let's have the musicians please we have a supernatural God amen where they keep our eyes on him hey man he'll lead us through amen amen amen do you believe it hey man do you love him hey man will you serve Him amen amen amen isn't
