[24:29] Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Amen. Praise
[24:33] the Lord. Thank you, brother Josh. Thank
[24:36] you, musicians. God bless you all this
[24:38] evening.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; How are you all? You doing good?
[24:42] &gt;&gt; That's good. It's good to see you all.
[24:43] Just while you're standing, um
[24:47] let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews 10
[24:50] and the 35th um verse.
[24:56] Oh, it's not that one.
[25:02] Hebrews 10:35 says, "Cast not away
[25:05] therefore your confidence
[25:08] which hath great recompense of reward."
[25:12] Amen. May God bless his word. You can
[25:14] take your seats uh this evening.
[25:18] I had a funny thought.
[25:20] There was a brother that um
[25:23] so I've heard that preached an entire
[25:26] service without asking the congregation
[25:29] to sit down. He sort of forgot to tell
[25:30] him to sit down. So and I guess they're
[25:33] all too polite to say anything. So they
[25:36] all stood up through through the whole
[25:37] service until he finished. And I think
[25:40] he realized at the end and at the end he
[25:41] said, "Well, hey, I have to stand up the
[25:42] whole service, so you might as well
[25:43] too." [laughter]
[25:45] But I got one up on him.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[25:50] &gt;&gt; They they he they had to stand the whole
[25:53] service on two legs.
[25:58] But I get to stand on one leg. Um it's
[26:02] good to be here. It's um I I've got a
[26:04] I've got a little thought that I that
[26:06] I've just had brewing in my mind and
[26:08] it's a it's this thought called
[26:10] confidence.
[26:12] Who likes having confidence?
[26:15] &gt;&gt; I like people with confidence.
[26:17] You know, some people get a bit annoyed
[26:19] by, say, some young fellas that are a
[26:20] bit sort of think they're all this and
[26:22] that. But I I actually quite like them.
[26:24] I like a young lad. I like people with
[26:26] confidence.
[26:27] I I prefer that over someone that that's
[26:29] a bit shy and doesn't want to do
[26:30] anything and pulls back cuz I I don't
[26:32] think that's healthy. I think it's
[26:33] healthier for a human to just to be out
[26:35] there and be be trying. At least you can
[26:37] It's probably a bit easier to pull
[26:39] someone in rather than it is to get
[26:40] someone to
[26:41] &gt;&gt; to come out. And um it's even been in my
[26:45] walk with the Lord. I've always had a I
[26:48] guess you could call it an agreement
[26:50] when I had those two dogs when I was
[26:52] just a new Christian. One was a one was
[26:53] called Mercy, one was called Wood. And
[26:57] Mercy would be very shy with everything.
[27:01] It wouldn't want to do things. It
[27:02] wouldn't want to hop in the car. It
[27:04] wouldn't want to go for a run. It would
[27:05] be very cautious. And the other dog wood
[27:07] was the opposite. It would just do
[27:08] anything. It saw water. It dived in. It
[27:10] saw the van. It jumped in and everything
[27:12] like that. And I I guess I preferred the
[27:15] more boisterous dog than the one that
[27:16] didn't do anything. So I said to the
[27:18] Lord, "Well, in my Christian walk, I'm
[27:19] just going to go for it. And if you want
[27:21] to sort of stop me and direct me another
[27:23] way, you can. But in the meantime, I'm
[27:25] going for it.
[27:27] [laughter]
[27:29] So I've kept my agreement and he's kept
[27:31] his. [laughter]
[27:33] But it it works." All right.
[27:36] I want to read you some scriptures about
[27:38] about confidence.
[27:41] David said it's better to trust in the
[27:42] Lord than to put confidence in man.
[27:46] It's better to trust in the Lord than to
[27:48] put confidence in princes
[27:51] because he's saying of and and Solomon
[27:52] says for the Lord shall be thy
[27:54] confidence and shall keep thy foot from
[27:56] being taken. We can have confidence in
[27:59] this God that we serve. That confidence
[28:01] means you can rest assured. You can sort
[28:03] of be a bit brash if you're confident.
[28:04] You can be a bit a bit slightly arrogant
[28:06] if you're confident. You know, if you're
[28:08] in a situation if someone like someone
[28:10] if they've if they're about to enter a
[28:12] fight and there's only two of the other
[28:13] guys and there's one of them and about
[28:15] 30 of his mates, that man is real
[28:17] confident.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; You know, cuz regardless of the what
[28:19] happens in his little fight, he knows
[28:21] that ultimately I'll get my friends will
[28:23] jump in and help me out. So, he he's got
[28:25] a he's maybe a little too overconfident,
[28:27] but that's the confidence we can have in
[28:28] the Lord that that we serve a big God
[28:30] that regardless what happens, he's
[28:31] always going to be there for us. we can
[28:32] have confidence and that's the God that
[28:34] we come to tonight is a we want to be
[28:36] confident in him and confident in his
[28:38] word and and be confident.
[28:40] John says, "Beloved, if our heart
[28:42] condemn us not, then we have confidence
[28:44] toward God."
[28:45] &gt;&gt; So when we approach God, if we know,
[28:47] Lord, I've I am not a secret sinner.
[28:49] There's nothing I'm doing that I that I
[28:50] know that's displeasing you. I can have
[28:52] confidence towards you and my sins are
[28:54] forgiven, but I know I'm not I'm not
[28:55] purposely going out of my way to I know
[28:57] you've said this, but I go and do
[28:58] something else. You I've got confidence,
[29:01] Lord. My my heart doesn't condemn me.
[29:02] Therefore, I've got confidence to come
[29:04] into your presence. I've got confidence
[29:05] to talk to you. I don't have to be
[29:06] ashamed. You know, sometimes we we're if
[29:08] we do something wrong and we got to go
[29:10] and see the person, we're slightly
[29:11] ashamed. We say, "Look, I'm sorry I did
[29:13] this." And we're ashamed. It's a human
[29:14] trait. And it's a good trait. But, you
[29:16] know, it's nice when we can come to to
[29:17] God with confidence. Although, if we
[29:19] repent of our sins, then we can that the
[29:21] moment we do, we can come with
[29:22] confidence [laughter] to the Lord. the
[29:24] same Paul says in whom we have boldness
[29:27] and access with confidence by faith of
[29:30] him. So because we have this faith in
[29:32] the Lord, we can have confidence when we
[29:33] access him. We don't need to be shy or
[29:35] hold back. We can have confidence to go
[29:37] into the presence of God. It says, and
[29:39] then he says, for we are made partakers
[29:42] of Christ if we hold the beginning of
[29:44] our confidence steadfast unto the end.
[29:46] As Christians, we've got a lot of
[29:48] confidence.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; We've got a lot of confidence in the
[29:50] word of God. We've got a lot of
[29:51] confidence in his promises. We've got a
[29:53] lot of confidence in his dealing. And
[29:54] Paul's saying, don't ever lose that
[29:56] confidence.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Hold on to that confidence. I think when
[29:59] we're first new Christians, we've got a
[30:01] lot of confidence, but things can happen
[30:02] in our life. They can we can get
[30:03] setbacks and different things. And if we
[30:05] don't watch it, we the devil tries to
[30:07] rob us of our confidence.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; But Paul's saying, hold your confidence
[30:10] steadfast to the end. That the God that
[30:12] you served when you began is still the
[30:13] same God you serve when it's all over.
[30:15] So, and and his word is the same. He's
[30:17] never changed his mind on you. Don't
[30:19] ever lose your confidence in the Lord.
[30:21] Always be confident in the Lord. He
[30:22] always loves you. He always cares for
[30:23] you. He's always got your best interest
[30:24] at heart. Always be confident in the
[30:26] Lord. And that's what Paul's telling us.
[30:28] Hold your confidence steadfast into the
[30:30] end. And that's where this scripture
[30:31] comes in. Paul admonishes us again. He
[30:33] says, "Cast not away therefore your
[30:35] confidence which have great recompense
[30:37] of reward." There's a confidence. If we
[30:39] have a reward in Christ, there's a
[30:40] confident there's if we have confidence
[30:42] in Christ, there's a reward that comes
[30:44] with it.
[30:46] I want to go through a few things of why
[30:48] we're so confident and why I'm so
[30:51] confident. Why? Why? I've got this
[30:52] confidence because
[30:55] through the devil trying to rob
[30:57] something from me, I've realized I've
[30:58] got a lot of confidence in the Lord.
[30:59] I've always been confident in the Lord.
[31:01] And I think you would be the same if
[31:03] you've got something in you that loves
[31:04] the Lord. You've always been confident
[31:05] in the Lord. You've been confident that
[31:07] he's going to provide. You've been
[31:08] confident that he's going to undertake.
[31:10] We call it faith, but it's also
[31:11] confidence. You know, we've just got
[31:12] this confidence that makes us move
[31:13] forward and keep going. And we're
[31:15] confident. We We're not shy to make
[31:17] decisions for the Lord because we're
[31:18] confident that he's going to undertake.
[31:19] We just we've got this air of confidence
[31:21] about us. And I want to say that I just
[31:25] want to bring us through a few things of
[31:26] why we're confident. And and one thing
[31:28] I've got confidence in confidence in is
[31:30] I've got confidence that God made the
[31:32] heavens and the earth.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; I look at the stars. I have confidence
[31:35] in that. I say, "Lord, you made this.
[31:36] You made all this creation." Then I then
[31:39] I look a bit closer and I see the
[31:40] intricate nature of some of the things
[31:42] that he's made.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; And I begin to trust. I I have more
[31:47] confidence in him because I think if God
[31:48] can make these intricate little things
[31:50] and make them all work very well, he can
[31:52] work out my life. I've got I'm confident
[31:54] in the Lord's ability. I'm confident in
[31:56] his ability to orchestrate things. I I I
[31:59] I've seen some of his handiwork. I'm
[32:00] confident he can do the same thing on
[32:02] me. I'm confident he's not just going to
[32:04] get take my life and make a mess of it.
[32:05] I'm confident he's very intelligent.
[32:07] Yeah.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; And and and then when I But then I'm
[32:10] also confident that at one point in time
[32:12] where there was no man, I'm I'm
[32:14] confident that in God was was this
[32:16] desire to express so many things.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he was like that. I'm
[32:20] I'm He wasn't just sitting there
[32:21] thinking I I don't want to know anybody.
[32:23] I'm just happy here by myself. I'm alone
[32:25] or up in the bush. I took a lot of flack
[32:26] for that statement last week.
[32:29] [laughter]
[32:30] Um I've got a Shannon's was up in the
[32:32] bush with me.
[32:34] Okay. [laughter]
[32:36] Okay. They just correct it. Okay. Hey,
[32:37] just in case I I think I missed that
[32:39] very important factor. Boy, was I in
[32:41] trouble when I got home, man. [laughter]
[32:44] So, it was Shannon and I, but and the
[32:46] children. [laughter]
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Nah,
[32:52] stinking old dogs.
[32:55] No, the dogs. Okay. Um, but I'm
[32:58] confident God wasn't like me. I'm
[32:59] confident that that he he desired to
[33:02] have fellowship. He desired to express
[33:04] himself.
[33:05] And and then I'm confident that that's
[33:07] why he decided to make man
[33:09] &gt;&gt; because he wanted to actually express
[33:10] himself and have some sort of fellowship
[33:12] and not just be there alone with his
[33:13] thoughts.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; I'm confident God was like that. So then
[33:16] over the course of time I'm confident
[33:17] that God created man.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he came down he
[33:21] thought he made the earth and then he
[33:23] creation came the birds the different
[33:25] things and then he made man and he was
[33:27] and I'm confident he was very happy when
[33:28] he finished making man because it says
[33:30] he looked at man and he said it's very
[33:31] good.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; It's good. I'm happy with my creation.
[33:34] And it was like it was like the the best
[33:36] of his handiwork went into man. And and
[33:37] and
[33:38] &gt;&gt; and then I'm confident that that when
[33:40] God would go down in the to the garden
[33:42] in the cool of the evening, I'm
[33:43] confident that he enjoyed it.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he didn't sit up
[33:47] wherever he was and think, "Ah, it's the
[33:49] evening again. I've got to go down
[33:50] again." [sighs] I'm confident it wasn't
[33:52] a it wasn't a burden for him. I'm
[33:54] confident he wanted to go and do it. He
[33:56] wanted to come down and fellowship with
[33:58] man. He it was he was it was such an
[34:00] enjoyable experience for him. I'm
[34:02] confident that God was like that. I'm
[34:03] confident he was looking forward to the
[34:05] meeting.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; And and I'm confident that when that
[34:08] when Eve was deceived and when Adam went
[34:11] the same way and I'm confident that God
[34:13] was sad at the situation.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; I'm confident he was disappointed in
[34:17] terms of he doesn't get that same
[34:18] fellowship they used to have.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; I'm confident he he wasn't just like ah
[34:22] there that that that saga is finally
[34:24] over because I was getting tiresome
[34:26] fellowshipping with these people.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; I'm confident he didn't think that.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; I'm confident he enjoyed fellowship. I'm
[34:31] confident he was sad. But then I'm
[34:34] confident that in his mind in his mind
[34:37] even though he had he had pushed man out
[34:39] of the garden and he had had shut the
[34:41] way to the tree of life. I'm confident
[34:43] that this was part of a greater plan
[34:44] that he had to and already when that had
[34:47] happened, he he was already making a
[34:48] plan to bring man back. It was part of
[34:51] his God has got such a way of doing that
[34:53] that even though things might look bad,
[34:54] they're working out for some better plan
[34:56] like like Joseph, you know, we if we
[34:58] just take Joseph's story of his brothers
[35:00] throwing him in the pit in isolation, we
[35:02] would think that's a very bad situation.
[35:04] That's a bad story. And yet on the grand
[35:06] scheme of everything, it was a great
[35:07] story and
[35:09] &gt;&gt; and and you you wouldn't take it back.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; If you took if you looked at it in its
[35:14] just on its own, you'd say, "I would
[35:15] stop that situation. I wouldn't let his
[35:17] brother throw him in there. Let's not
[35:18] have that situation cuz it's a bad
[35:19] situation. But God in his great mind can
[35:21] just his mind is bigger than our mind.
[35:23] He's very good and he he can take things
[35:25] that like this situation here that look
[35:27] bad and make it even to to an even
[35:29] greater thing where where man actually
[35:31] had a better fellowship with God after
[35:34] everything was said and done than what
[35:35] they did before it was all said and
[35:37] done. I'm confident that's the God we
[35:38] serve. I'm confident he's always got a
[35:40] plan. and it looks like maybe his plan's
[35:42] been thwarted or maybe something's gone
[35:43] wrong, but I'm confident he he's never
[35:45] up he he's never worried about it's not
[35:47] going the way that he thought.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; I'm confident.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Then I'm confident even though even
[35:52] though man was in the state where they
[35:54] were separated from God, if if man so
[35:56] desired even in that situation that he
[35:58] could begin in his heart somewhere to
[35:59] call out to God and I'm confident God
[36:01] would answer.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Even though there was a separation, God
[36:04] would still answer. There was still some
[36:05] way that man could communicate with this
[36:07] God. God didn't just turn his back
[36:09] completely and think, "I don't want
[36:11] anything more to do with you." I'm
[36:12] confident God, if he saw a heart
[36:14] somewhere that desired God, that God
[36:16] would somehow somewhere meet them some
[36:18] way and begin and talk to them somehow.
[36:21] That's why I'm confident that there was
[36:22] a man called there was a man called Job
[36:24] that that Job just loved this God so
[36:26] much that God could talk to Job or or
[36:28] Enoch. Enoch was supposedly cut off. The
[36:32] the the don't forget the the the tree of
[36:34] life. The tree the way to the tree of
[36:36] life was still blocked. And yet Enoch
[36:37] walked out of here and walked into the
[36:39] kingdom of God. So I'm confident that
[36:41] God had such a desire to fellowship that
[36:43] Enoch some way somehow just wanted to
[36:45] meet God. And he just he he and Enoch
[36:49] just cried and called out to God and God
[36:52] answered somehow someway even amongst
[36:53] even though there was this chasm God
[36:55] bridged the chasm somehow. So that that
[36:57] if any any anyone somewhere wanted to
[36:59] meet God I'm confident that God will
[37:01] respond to their the cry of their heart.
[37:03] Yes sir.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Then I'm confident that one day God met
[37:06] this man called Abram. And he said to
[37:08] Abram, I'm going to make you a great
[37:10] nation. And he said he said look up at
[37:12] the stars. I'm going to make your
[37:13] offspring like the like the stars you
[37:16] can see in the heavens. That's that's
[37:17] who your off that's the amount of
[37:18] offspring you're going to have. And I'm
[37:19] going to make a I'm going to make a
[37:21] great nation out of you. And he I'm
[37:23] confident God gave that promise to
[37:24] Abraham to Abraham.
[37:27] Then in the course of time, I'm also
[37:29] confident that that this promise looked
[37:30] like it wasn't going to go anywhere cuz
[37:32] all of Abraham's whole entire lineage
[37:34] became slaves in Egypt. But I'm
[37:36] confident that wasn't the end of the
[37:38] story
[37:39] &gt;&gt; because remember, God had made a promise
[37:40] and I'm confident that God keeps his
[37:42] promises. He doesn't just say it to
[37:43] Abraham and then maybe 400 years down
[37:45] the track realize thinks, "Oh, I didn't
[37:47] maybe this hasn't gone the way that I
[37:49] thought. You guys haven't been as good
[37:50] as what I thought. I'm going to go back
[37:51] on my promise." He didn't go back on his
[37:52] promise to to Abraham. Even though it
[37:54] looked like everything was bad and the
[37:56] promise was not going to happen, I'm
[37:57] confident God was going to keep his
[37:59] word.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; And and then I'm confident I'm confident
[38:03] that God led the children of Israel out
[38:06] of bondage with a mighty hand.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; I'm confident. And I'm also confident
[38:10] that they didn't walk through a sea of
[38:12] reeds.
[38:13] [laughter]
[38:15] &gt;&gt; And if they did, it would have been a
[38:16] greater miracle than if they walked
[38:17] through a deep sea.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz God managed to drown the the might
[38:21] of the world, the most majestic,
[38:23] powerful army in existence. He managed
[38:24] to drown them in a sea of reeds.
[38:26] [laughter]
[38:28] Someone's telling the story wrong.
[38:29] Either these guys were no good. They
[38:31] went a very powerful army and they were
[38:32] amateurs to die in a sea of reads. Or it
[38:34] wasn't a sea of reads. [laughter]
[38:37] or or otherwise God was just so powerful
[38:39] he could drown them in the sea. But I
[38:40] believe an east wind blew and it blew
[38:42] and blew and blew. You know that that
[38:45] you know if you do that if you blow wind
[38:47] so fast it actually can make things turn
[38:48] to ice. And if you can blow if you blow
[38:51] air fast enough that's why when you're
[38:53] flying an airplane ice particles build
[38:54] up on the outside because it's because
[38:56] the wind blows so fast. And when an east
[38:58] one blew it just blew and blew and blew
[38:59] and it could actually build up big ice
[39:00] walls and the children of Israel could
[39:01] walk across and then when he let the
[39:04] when he let um Pharaoh and all his army
[39:06] across the ice walls just came crashing
[39:08] down. I don't know if that's a
[39:09] scientific explanation but it can
[39:10] happen. Either way, I believe and I'm
[39:13] confident that God drowned all the all
[39:15] the Egyptian army in the sea.
[39:19] And then I'm confident that that to this
[39:22] this particular people. Now, there were
[39:24] many people that God spoke to in the
[39:25] world, but he just decided I'm going to
[39:27] work it this way that this particular
[39:29] people that he began to express himself
[39:32] to the children of Abraham.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; And now, it wasn't I'm confident it
[39:35] wasn't just for them like, oh, this is
[39:37] no one else can be a partaker of this.
[39:39] I'm just talking to these these people
[39:40] are no more. But I'm confident he was he
[39:43] was speaking although he was speaking to
[39:45] them. He was speaking to all of us. He
[39:47] was speaking to mankind. He just chose
[39:49] this particular group of people that I'm
[39:50] going to do it through. I'm going to
[39:51] start to express who I am. I'm going to
[39:53] start to express myself. And then he
[39:56] gave them he start he gave them what
[39:57] they called the law. I'm confident he
[39:59] gave them a law. But then I'm also
[40:01] confident that he said there's a way
[40:03] there's freedom from this law. Yeah,
[40:05] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he just didn't give
[40:06] them a law and say now now you can't
[40:08] keep it. Now you're done and goodbye
[40:10] race. But I'm confident that he he said
[40:13] there's a although there's a law and
[40:15] you're breaking all the time, there's a
[40:17] way that you this there's a way that the
[40:18] penalty can be undone. And if you if you
[40:20] take a lamb, this penalty can can be
[40:22] undone. But I'm confident that he wasn't
[40:24] just speaking in some Middle Eastern
[40:27] desert somewhere talking to these people
[40:28] about a little lamb and then it was just
[40:30] a a sideeshow that he tried to do to
[40:33] give give himself a bit of
[40:34] entertainment. But I'm confident that he
[40:36] was speaking of himself.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; He had he had a greater purpose in mind
[40:39] when he began to tell them take a lamb.
[40:41] He had a greater purpose because he
[40:43] wanted to show eventually you're going
[40:46] to take me. I'm going to be the lamb.
[40:47] I'm going to come here like this little
[40:48] lamb is but I need to show you first
[40:49] what I'm going to do. I'm going to come
[40:51] here and be that lamb and I'm going to
[40:52] I'm going to pay the price for you just
[40:54] like I'm showing you. This is going to
[40:55] pay the price of that sin. I'm going to
[40:57] pay the price for your sin. I'm
[40:58] confident that's why he was doing it.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that's why he met Abraham.
[41:02] That's why he made all this effort for
[41:04] the to the children of Israel. I'm
[41:05] confident he did that for me
[41:06] &gt;&gt; because he wanted to show me that he's
[41:08] the lamb of God that takes away my sins.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that throughout the
[41:12] ages, it doesn't matter what the
[41:14] children of Israel did. Doesn't matter
[41:15] what the priests did. Doesn't matter
[41:17] what the scribes did. It doesn't matter
[41:18] how they messed up his whole religious
[41:19] plan. He didn't mind. He just kept on
[41:22] with his plan anyway. He kept on sending
[41:24] prophets saying, "I'm about to come.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come. Unto us a son is
[41:28] given. Unto us a child is born." I'm
[41:30] confident he just carried on.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Even though they took the law and they
[41:34] did all these things with it and they
[41:35] they looks like it was always all messed
[41:37] up and it looked like there was no way
[41:38] this whole thing's going to carry on.
[41:39] And yet God, I'm confident he didn't
[41:41] worry about that.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; I'm confident he didn't give up. He just
[41:44] carried on. Then I'm confident that one
[41:46] day there was a woman called Mary that
[41:48] knew no man. man that was a virgin. I'm
[41:51] confident that the Holy Ghost
[41:52] overshadowed her one day and she
[41:54] conceived seed in her that was of the
[41:56] Holy Ghost.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that this was a this was a
[42:02] worldchanging
[42:04] event that took place that that God
[42:06] Almighty came down and connected with
[42:08] Earth one in in in the womb of Mary. And
[42:12] I'm confident that in her womb was the
[42:14] son of God.
[42:16] When we understand the magnitude of
[42:17] that, it makes us shake ourselves to our
[42:19] core to realize that that just this is
[42:22] this is God visiting man here. This is
[42:23] not just a nice story, but it's God
[42:26] visiting man.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident then that that in in
[42:29] in a in a stable in Bethlehem that this
[42:32] this man called Jesus was born. That a
[42:35] very unannounced birth. It seemed like
[42:37] it wasn't even very significant. Yet,
[42:38] there was a son of God.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; I'm confident there was a son of God
[42:41] born there. And and and I'm confident
[42:44] that that the angels were so excited
[42:45] they had to tell somebody. They were so
[42:47] excited about the son of God arriving
[42:49] that they the the best people they could
[42:51] find were shepherds. And they went and
[42:53] told the shepherds, "I bring you glad
[42:54] tidings. I I bring you good news. The
[42:57] son of God, God is with man." I'm
[43:00] confident that's what happened. I'm
[43:01] confident this wasn't a story, a a
[43:04] madeup story, but I'm confident that's
[43:05] what happened. Right.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; And then I'm confident that Jesus of his
[43:10] own free will
[43:11] &gt;&gt; just his whole purpose of being here and
[43:13] he knew it from when he was born was I'm
[43:15] going to pay the price. I'm going to die
[43:16] for I'm going to die for all of my
[43:18] people.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that when he was led
[43:21] up to the cross that he did it of his
[43:23] own free will that at any point he could
[43:25] have said no.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; I'm confident the Romans had no say in
[43:27] this matter.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; I'm confident cuz he said you'd have no
[43:30] power over me except it were given you.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; God had all the power and he chose to
[43:34] pay the price of our sins. I'm confident
[43:36] of that because he did that because he
[43:38] loved me because he loved you. I'm
[43:39] confident that's the God that I serve
[43:41] &gt;&gt; and that's that's that's who walked up
[43:44] that hill and that's who paid the price
[43:46] for our salvation. And then I'm
[43:47] confident that when he died,
[43:49] &gt;&gt; he didn't have any sin.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; So the the the penalty of death that
[43:55] that grabs on to this thing called sin.
[43:58] I'm confident it had nowhere to grab
[44:00] hold of him. It tried to grab him yet it
[44:02] couldn't grab him anywhere. So, I'm
[44:03] confident he went down to the the lower
[44:05] regions of hell, the deep the deepest
[44:07] the darkest place and got the keys of
[44:09] death and hell and he walked back
[44:11] victorious with it. I'm confident that's
[44:13] where he went. And I'm also confident
[44:14] that when he was laying in the tomb that
[44:17] he that his body didn't see corruption
[44:19] like when you David catches a pig and
[44:21] you skin it and you put it in the fridge
[44:22] and it it lasts maybe after 3 or 4 days.
[44:25] That's why they they let meat age cuz it
[44:27] starts to break down. It technically
[44:28] goes rotten and it gets softer and
[44:29] softer as it breaks down. I'm confident
[44:31] he didn't his body didn't break down
[44:33] when it was dead in the tomb. I'm
[44:34] confident it didn't see corruption. It
[44:36] didn't just start to rot and break away,
[44:38] but it saw no corruption. And I'm
[44:40] confident that before it did, the life
[44:42] of God came back into it and he rose
[44:43] back from the dead and there was an
[44:45] empty tomb. I'm confident of that. And I
[44:47] believe you're confident of that, too.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that he said, "If I
[44:52] go, I'll come back to you by my spirit.
[44:54] I'll I'll I'll cleanse you of your sins
[44:56] and I'll send my spirit back upon the
[44:58] earth and I'll come and dwell in you and
[45:00] I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost and
[45:01] I'm confident that Jesus Christ is alive
[45:03] forever more. I'm confident that he rose
[45:05] from the dead and he's alive forever
[45:06] more. I'm confident of that cuz I've
[45:09] I've met him. I'm confident. And then
[45:11] I'm confident that he kept his promise
[45:12] and the same spirit that was in him
[45:15] &gt;&gt; was p we was poured into the church.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; We have a confidence. I know that's what
[45:20] happened. They didn't just sit there and
[45:21] nothing happened. They sat there and the
[45:23] power of God came down and it filled
[45:24] each one in the room and they spoke with
[45:27] tongues and prophesied and there were
[45:28] and you could see actual pillars of fire
[45:30] in the building because the spirit of
[45:31] God was there fulfilling fulfilling the
[45:33] promise that was spoken of the prophet
[45:35] Joel.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[45:38] I'm confident that that's what happened.
[45:40] And I'm confident that when Peter came
[45:42] out to speak that he didn't just uh
[45:44] rattle off some words that that he
[45:46] thought would be good at the time, but
[45:47] they said to men and brethren, "What
[45:49] must we do to be saved? what must we do?
[45:52] And I'm confident that Peter under the
[45:53] inspiration of the same God that was
[45:55] that made the earth said to the people,
[45:57] "Repent and be baptized in the name of
[45:59] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[46:00] sins, and you shall receive the gift of
[46:02] the Holy Ghost." I'm confident that
[46:04] wasn't Peter speaking.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that was the spirit of God
[46:07] speaking through Peter. And I'm
[46:09] confident if we go the same way, we can
[46:10] get the same result. If we follow the
[46:12] formula, we get the same result today
[46:14] because it's the eternal word of God.
[46:16] And I'm confident now that that men and
[46:17] women could we can surrender our life
[46:19] over to the Lord. We can repent. We can
[46:21] be baptized. And we can we can receive
[46:23] the spirit of God and walk in newness of
[46:25] life. I'm confident of that. That's
[46:27] that's the confidence I have that if
[46:29] someone comes whomsoever will let him
[46:30] come and he can he can be you can be
[46:32] changed, renewed, and refreshed and and
[46:33] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Then as time went on, I'm confident
[46:37] there was a man called Saul that hated
[46:38] God. That that no, he loved he loved
[46:40] what he thought was God, but he hated
[46:41] this Jesus. And he was going around
[46:43] trying to persecute the church and he he
[46:45] hated the whole idea of what they were
[46:46] trying to do. But I'm confident one day
[46:49] that God met him.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; That that this man was going in such a
[46:53] direction that he he thought he was
[46:54] fighting the good fight of faith and
[46:56] serving God and yet he was fighting
[46:57] against God. But I'm confident that God
[46:59] met him and turned his life around and
[47:01] he said, "Who are you?" And a light
[47:03] spoke and said, "I'm Jesus whom thou
[47:05] persecutest." I'm confident that
[47:06] happened.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; I'm confident. And then it I'm confident
[47:10] that that that God, the great almighty
[47:12] God, began to speak to Paul and to
[47:15] reveal things to Paul that that he'd
[47:17] revealed to no man
[47:18] &gt;&gt; to that point. I'm I'm confident he
[47:20] began to speak to this unworthy vessel,
[47:22] this man that hated him.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; God in his great mercy decided to use
[47:25] somebody that hated him
[47:27] &gt;&gt; to turn him around. That's why Paul
[47:28] could say, "I'm the least of all the
[47:30] apostles." He meant it.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Show me any other records where any of
[47:33] the other apostles are so against the
[47:35] Lord. They were just doing their thing,
[47:37] fishing, doing bits and pieces, and he
[47:39] went and called them. They were living,
[47:40] you could say, reasonably okay,
[47:42] respectable sort of lives. Here was Saul
[47:44] hated Jesus, hated Christians. He was
[47:46] doing everything he could to persecute
[47:48] them. But, but I'm confident that God in
[47:50] his great plan begin to work through
[47:52] Paul and speak things. And I'm confident
[47:54] then that the things that Paul spoke
[47:56] were not just a mere man speaking, but
[47:59] they were thus sayaith the Lord,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; that they were the word of God. That it
[48:03] was God speaking through Paul. And as
[48:05] Paul would write letters, it wasn't just
[48:06] Paul writing letters, but they were the
[48:08] infallible word of God when he would
[48:10] write it. We have we have our Bibles
[48:12] here today still that as a result of
[48:14] this situation where God spoke to Paul.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident then that that man
[48:20] could take that and and take the word of
[48:22] God and and
[48:24] use it whenever he would desire. But but
[48:26] I'm confident that throughout the ages
[48:29] as when Satan started to impersonate and
[48:32] this one here when Satan started to see
[48:34] what God was up to and begin to
[48:35] impersonate Christianity, begin to
[48:37] impersonate the ways of God, begin to
[48:40] put us put a substitute up, he begin to
[48:42] to copy it and and offer another way
[48:45] that wasn't the way. I'm confident that
[48:46] there were people that still knew the
[48:48] right way. Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; And as these as Satan began to take over
[48:51] the Christian movement more and more, he
[48:53] he began to take control of Christendom,
[48:56] the very thing that was supposed to be
[48:57] God, as Satan un as he unpacked how the
[49:01] whole thing worked, he learned the the
[49:02] phrases. He learned the the songs, he
[49:04] learned this, he learned that to to
[49:06] impersonate Christianity, and then he
[49:08] began to take over and and men and women
[49:10] that didn't have the spirit of God were
[49:12] were tricked and were fooled. And then
[49:14] this and then Satan began over time
[49:17] Satan began to run the Christian church
[49:19] &gt;&gt; and that the and and Paul the Pauls of
[49:22] this world, the Holy Ghost people were
[49:24] of none effect and and the few that were
[49:27] left would begin to be put to death. But
[49:30] I'm confident that even in that
[49:32] &gt;&gt; God gave power to the believers all
[49:34] through the age to overcome. No matter
[49:36] what came against them, if they were
[49:37] thrown into the lines, they had power
[49:38] there to overcome. If they were
[49:40] wallowing in the dark ages, he gave them
[49:42] power to overcome. I'm confident that
[49:44] God didn't just leave his people and
[49:45] disappear. But I'm confident that that
[49:48] he gave them what they needed in that
[49:49] hour to overcome. I'm confident he gave
[49:52] these people what they needed to
[49:53] overcome.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that even through the
[49:56] dark ages when it when it would when it
[49:58] seems like if a searching man or
[50:00] searching woman would knock on any
[50:01] church door to try and find God, they
[50:03] wouldn't find him. Because Satan had
[50:06] taken over the virtually the whole of
[50:08] Christendom. So every church door you
[50:10] knocked on would lead you down the wrong
[50:11] path.
[50:12] God was nowhere to be found because
[50:14] Satan had done such a good job of
[50:15] impersonated impersonating it and taken
[50:18] over the whole thing to where whole
[50:19] continents were taken over by the church
[50:21] was run by Satan. But I'm confident God
[50:24] didn't want it that way.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that God would wanted a
[50:27] man or woman if they went to a to the
[50:29] house of God that they could find God.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; They they wouldn't knock on a door and
[50:33] and be led down and say this prayer and
[50:35] hold these beads in your hand and do
[50:36] this sort of stuff and do penance and do
[50:38] that. I'm confident he didn't want that.
[50:40] He wanted them to meet the living God
[50:41] the same way that he wanted that he said
[50:43] in the book of Acts 2.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; So then I'm confident he had a plan.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just going to leave it. He
[50:48] wasn't just going to say, "Well, let's
[50:49] just leave it. Satan's taken over the
[50:50] whole thing." But he sent men with a
[50:52] message that had courage
[50:54] &gt;&gt; to stand up against a whole continent.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; This is like Moses went up to a whole
[50:58] army. Martin Luther stood up against a
[51:01] whole continent, against probably the
[51:04] most powerful force in the world. He
[51:06] stood up and he he said, "No, it's not
[51:08] going to be like this." And that wasn't
[51:10] him thinking, "Oh, I'm just going to go
[51:11] out and give these guys a hard time."
[51:13] I'm confident that was the spirit of God
[51:14] in him desiring that that this thing
[51:17] will be pushed away and the spirit of
[51:18] God could begin to move into the people
[51:21] again. I'm confident it was a work of
[51:23] God. And and and this worked. I'm
[51:25] confident it worked and and men and
[51:27] women began to now find access. The just
[51:29] shall live by faith. They began to find
[51:31] access again back into the kingdom of
[51:32] God. They didn't have to do all these
[51:33] things. They could just believe. Yeah.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; But even over time as they started to go
[51:38] a bit loose, I'm confident God sent more
[51:39] people. He sent John Wesley to
[51:41] straighten things out and to to keep
[51:43] pulling his people out to pull them up
[51:45] higher because he wanted us back to
[51:46] where we were in the book of Acts.
[51:48] That's I'm confident that's where he
[51:48] wanted us. He didn't just want us
[51:50] halfway.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; He wanted us back. And then over time,
[51:54] as man did does, we all seem to get
[51:56] formal and we just started making all
[51:58] these so many rules and everything in
[52:00] the church. We became so formal. And
[52:01] Sister Robin knows all about that being
[52:03] in the what is it? the Dutch Reformed
[52:06] Church and things where it's just it's
[52:07] just a formal occasion that the the the
[52:10] you know the the the whole battle you
[52:12] think this seems so pointless the whole
[52:14] battle that Martin Luther waged and the
[52:16] end result is some formal
[52:20] &gt;&gt; little gathering that they just sing
[52:22] about two songs and then the the guy
[52:24] comes up and reads word for word off
[52:26] here and then he says his friend they
[52:27] all go home and you think and and that
[52:29] whole fight was fought for that
[52:31] &gt;&gt; it God wanted man to worship him in
[52:33] spirit and in truth where you're alive
[52:34] to Christ. The word of God's burning in
[52:36] your heart, you're filled with the Holy
[52:37] Ghost. That's what God desired. Not just
[52:39] coming dead wood. He wanted life. And
[52:41] that's what he So God didn't just stop
[52:43] and go, "Oh, that's what it is." He kept
[52:44] on pressing on until he got life. And
[52:46] and as men got way, way too formal, God
[52:49] decided, I'm just going to come down.
[52:50] I'm just going to fill a whole bunch of
[52:51] people with the Holy Ghost, and let's
[52:52] get this [laughter]
[52:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I shouldn't
[52:56] Let's stir this up a wee bit. Let's get
[52:59] this started. Let's turn Let's Let's
[53:01] turn over things a little bit. and on a
[53:03] little a little corner building where
[53:04] where there were just a couple of simple
[53:06] men and women that were just there
[53:07] praising God anyway that they knew how
[53:09] banging on some old guitar and
[53:10] tambourine. One of them would have had a
[53:11] tambourine that the spirit of God fell
[53:13] in a place called Isuza Street and it
[53:15] came down and they they didn't know what
[53:16] happened but it was the spirit well they
[53:18] knew it happened but it was just like we
[53:19] weren't expecting this when we came to
[53:20] church today but the spirit of God came
[53:23] because God wanted to keep on moving in
[53:25] the people and keep drawing people to
[53:26] himself. He wanted people to be filled
[53:28] with the spirit and and he he didn't
[53:30] want people just sitting around formal.
[53:31] That's and that was half of the battle
[53:33] that brother Brandham had even with his
[53:34] mother-in-law because she was used to
[53:35] formality. She's saying, "Who are these
[53:37] guys that are banging on tams and
[53:38] dancing around?" That's not the way we
[53:39] do it. That is the way you do it. If you
[53:41] want to do it that way, it's just that
[53:43] she was so used to being bound all her
[53:44] life sitting down and doing a 20-minute
[53:46] this and two songs. But God didn't want
[53:48] it that way. If that's if that works for
[53:50] you and you're filled with the spirit,
[53:50] good. But he he wants you to be free and
[53:52] serve him and walk with him. But even
[53:55] amongst all that, even amongst all that
[53:57] like the the the the move of God, even
[54:00] in that it started to get all organized
[54:01] and started to go fanatical and then so
[54:03] then you even had seems like more of a
[54:05] chasm. You had fanaticism and all sorts
[54:07] of stuff going off on this way and you
[54:08] had formalism. They almost started to
[54:10] fight each other and go separate ways.
[54:12] So you'd think, well, the church was
[54:13] even more it's it's even more messed up
[54:15] than it was in the first place. But God
[54:18] didn't leave it that way.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; God didn't want it that way. He wanted
[54:21] people that could worship him in spirit
[54:22] and in truth.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So he sent a man called
[54:25] William Brandham that that came with a
[54:26] word to point us back to the original
[54:28] faith to lead us in spirit and in truth
[54:31] to to show if you if you need a bit more
[54:33] spirit, you need more spirit. If you
[54:34] need more word, you need more he brought
[54:36] the two together. He says stick down the
[54:38] middle of the road. It's spirit and it's
[54:39] truth.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You you can worship God on Sunday,
[54:42] praise the Lord. And then during the
[54:43] week, live a holy life. And this is how
[54:44] you do it there. This is and this is how
[54:46] you approach God. And he just begins to
[54:47] unfold everything.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And and we're confident that that's the
[54:51] that that he was sent from God. And
[54:53] we're confident that that the the the
[54:55] gospel that we the Jesus that we follow
[54:59] is the same Jesus that met Paul. We're
[55:01] confident of that because in this day
[55:02] and age there are many Jesuses that are
[55:04] going to speak to you. There's a there
[55:06] are many Jesuses on offer. It's not all
[55:08] the same. There are many on offer. You
[55:10] can't be naive and think, oh no, there's
[55:12] just one way and that's it. And if for
[55:13] someone calls on the name of the Lord,
[55:14] there's just one. Well, that's what they
[55:16] would have said back at the beginning.
[55:17] And then it turned out that the whole
[55:19] Christianom got taken over by this wrong
[55:20] spirit because Satan loves to
[55:22] impersonate and take over. And he's
[55:24] going to try and do the same thing
[55:25] today. And many of the people that
[55:27] that's why Jesus says there'll be many
[55:28] false ge false Christ will arise. False
[55:30] anointed ones and will deceive many say
[55:32] come here. He's over here. He's over
[55:34] there. But and what right do we have to
[55:36] say? Well, I've got it. You haven't got
[55:37] it. I can't just say in my mind I've got
[55:39] that. I've got it cuz I'm me and I'm
[55:41] right. That doesn't that's not the
[55:42] basis. But we can look back in the word
[55:44] of God and we can we can look and we
[55:46] think the same word that he preaches
[55:48] Paul preaches.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; We can look and think, well, you know
[55:50] what? If Paul came and preached in this
[55:52] pure, you'd all be saying amen the same
[55:53] as you say amen to me.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; You'd all be saying amen. There are many
[55:56] churches that Paul would go and preach
[55:58] and no one would say amen. And by the
[55:59] end of the service, they wouldn't want
[56:00] him back.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; So you think, what spirit is that church
[56:02] of? But I'm confident that the word that
[56:04] we've heard was from the same Lord Jesus
[56:07] that's that that walked here. It's from
[56:08] the same Lord Jesus that rose again. Was
[56:10] from the same Lord Jesus that met Paul.
[56:12] was the same Lord Jesus that spoke all
[56:14] through the ages. That's the Lord Jesus
[56:15] that we follow because we've got
[56:17] confidence. We can look back in the word
[56:18] and think, well, he said the same thing
[56:19] as this one. It's the same. It's of the
[56:21] same spirit. And I'm confident then that
[56:23] that because we're the bride of Christ,
[56:25] we I'm confident I can see this world
[56:27] erupting into chaos and it's going to be
[56:29] burnt. But I'm confident that I'm going
[56:30] to be taken out of here before any of
[56:32] this happens. I've got a confidence
[56:33] because that's what he said is going to
[56:34] happen to me.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I've got a confidence that I'm not going
[56:37] to go through the tribulation and have
[56:38] to go through that way. But I've got a
[56:39] confidence that I'm his.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; And I've also got a confidence that I
[56:44] that that the living Christ is amongst
[56:46] us today.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I've got a confidence of that. It's not
[56:48] just a it's not just a good story to to
[56:50] make people feel good, but I've got a
[56:52] confidence that God's working God's
[56:54] working now the same way that he was
[56:56] back then. And I've got a confidence
[56:57] that he's that he's risen from the tomb
[56:59] and that he's working in hearts and in
[57:01] lives. And I want to bring it closer
[57:02] home. I'm confident that I'm confident
[57:04] that we have a pastor that's been called
[57:06] by the spirit of God and speaking the
[57:07] word of God and a and a a wife and a
[57:10] family that love the Lord that that are
[57:11] anointed by the same Holy Ghost that
[57:13] anointed Paul, the same Holy Ghost that
[57:15] anointed Peter. I'm confident that we
[57:16] serve the same God and that the same God
[57:18] is dwelling them. I've got a confidence.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; We got to bring this down to home. We
[57:22] have confidence. I've got I I know in
[57:24] whom I have believed and I know what
[57:26] he's done. And I can be confident in his
[57:27] work. And I'm confident that the present
[57:29] all around me are filled with the Holy
[57:31] Ghost and that are that are the royal
[57:32] seed of Abraham that are that are the
[57:34] sons and daughters of the living God
[57:36] that are the BRIDE OF CHRIST. I'M
[57:37] CONFIDENT that you all are. It's not
[57:39] just a story. I'm confident. I'm I'm
[57:41] confident that that I can come to you
[57:43] and ask you to pray and I'm confident
[57:44] God hears your prayers.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; I'm confident you pray for me and
[57:47] hopefully you're confident I pray for
[57:48] you and we we edify each other. I'm
[57:50] confident you love me and you're
[57:52] confident that I love you.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; I'm confident I only think good about
[57:54] you. And I know you only think good
[57:56] about me. And I'm confident that if you
[57:58] ever get a thought this opposite to
[58:00] that, I'm confident you'll fight it away
[58:01] cuz you're a son and daughter of God
[58:03] &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost. And you
[58:04] don't want any schisms in the body. You
[58:06] don't want any division. You just want
[58:07] the love of God to be reigning in this
[58:10] place and to be serving and praising the
[58:11] Lord. We don't want to
[58:13] &gt;&gt; turn our eyes off to some little little
[58:15] drama over here that waste our time. We
[58:17] just want to focus on the Lord and keep
[58:19] moving forward in the Lord. Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident then that that as that
[58:23] that we know we hear the voice of the
[58:25] Lord then that you have an individual
[58:26] walk with the Lord that each and every
[58:28] day as you walk, I'm confident the Lord
[58:30] is leading you.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Each and every day he leads you. You
[58:33] wake up, you speak to him, and he
[58:34] directs you and you know that and I'm
[58:36] confident that you know where you're
[58:37] going.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I'm confident you know the path you're
[58:39] taking. You may not know everything, but
[58:41] I'm confident that you understand. I'm
[58:42] confident the Lord is showing you what
[58:44] you need to know. And and he's your he's
[58:46] your shepherd. I'm confident of that.
[58:48] And I'm also confident that because we
[58:50] know this God like how we do that, we're
[58:52] different.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; We don't have to live our life like what
[58:55] the Gentiles live their life.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said, the Gentiles, they
[58:59] save, they do this, they do that, they
[59:00] buy, they do all those things. I'm
[59:02] confident that that's not the way we
[59:03] live our life cuz we serve a different
[59:05] we serve not the God of this world, but
[59:07] a an eternal God. I'm confident that we
[59:10] make funny decisions sometimes. I'm
[59:12] confident of that because I look at our
[59:14] forefathers, the the children of the
[59:16] book of Acts. What did they do? They
[59:17] sold everything and just wanted to serve
[59:18] the Lord cuz they were oddballs. I'm
[59:20] confident that they just put the Lord
[59:21] first. Nothing else. They didn't care.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that. That we're all
[59:25] like that. We don't think normally.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; We don't think normally.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; We're not logical half the time.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; But we're not SUPPOSED TO BE. I'M
[59:35] CONFIDENT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
[59:36] &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus SAYS, "TAKE NO THOUGHT for
[59:38] tomorrow."
[59:39] &gt;&gt; How foolish AND NATURAL THINKING IS
[59:41] THAT? TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW.
[59:43] Aren't I supposed to plan everything?
[59:44] Well, according to God, you're not.
[59:46] That's right.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Because we SERVE A DIFFERENT GOD THAT
[59:49] LEADS.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "JUST BE CONFIDENT IN ME."
[59:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; I'll lead you. I'll provide for you.
[59:54] I'll sustain you. I'LL DIRECT YOU. JUST
[59:56] HAVE CONFIDENCE in me.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; We're oddballs. We're different. I don't
[59:59] know being an oddball. Leave me. I'll
[1:00:01] feel better this way.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; It's more fun. I HAVE A MORE EXCITING
[1:00:04] LIFE.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE around
[1:00:05] the corner. Imagine planning everything
[1:00:06] and then you die. It's boring.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; We live an exciting life cuz we can hand
[1:00:11] it over to the Lord and you never know
[1:00:12] what's around the next corner.
[1:00:15] THERE'S GOOD STUFF. THERE'S great stuff.
[1:00:16] Lord, there's so many good things around
[1:00:18] the next corner. You just don't know
[1:00:19] what's coming up when you trust in God.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; It's a far more exciting life anyway.
[1:00:22] You He makes us the most exciting people
[1:00:24] that there is.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that man and woman can
[1:00:27] have a sincere relationship with with
[1:00:29] the Lord and just meet God and and live
[1:00:31] a powerful supernatural life. That the
[1:00:33] spirit of God can flow through them and
[1:00:34] their life is supernatural. It's not
[1:00:36] natural. It's supernatural. I'M
[1:00:38] CONFIDENT THAT YOUR life is
[1:00:39] supernatural. You don't just live a day
[1:00:41] and it's boring. the supernatural God
[1:00:43] dwells in you and he manifests through
[1:00:44] you and he does things through you and
[1:00:46] there's things around in your life that
[1:00:47] are happening. There's supernatural
[1:00:48] things that happening in your life and
[1:00:49] in my life cuz that's the God we serve.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that I'm confident that my
[1:00:53] life's in the palm of his hand that that
[1:00:55] it doesn't matter what I go through.
[1:00:56] Whether it's up or down, it doesn't
[1:00:57] matter. My life's in the palm of his
[1:00:59] hand. I'm all right. It's all right. It
[1:01:01] doesn't matter if it looks like it's
[1:01:02] good or bad. I'm all right. My life is
[1:01:04] in the palm of his hand. Another verse
[1:01:06] says, I'm the apple of his eye.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He can never not see me. You can never
[1:01:10] not see the apple of your eyes. there.
[1:01:12] It's you.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; I'm confident that I'm the apple of his
[1:01:15] eye. And I'm confident that he's he's
[1:01:17] always watching over me. He's always
[1:01:18] keeping me like a like a son. If there's
[1:01:20] a group of children in our park, you
[1:01:21] always know like when you're a father,
[1:01:23] you always know where your child is.
[1:01:25] Where's my where are your children? If
[1:01:26] you go to someone who your children,
[1:01:27] they're like, "Oh, there's one there.
[1:01:28] There's one there. There's one over
[1:01:29] there." Cuz a mother or father knows cuz
[1:01:31] their eyes are upon them. And I'm
[1:01:33] confident no matter where I go, whatever
[1:01:34] crowd I'm in, the Lord knows where I am.
[1:01:35] He's looking over me. Isaac's there.
[1:01:37] Shannon's there. Christian's there.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Josh is there.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lat's here. I'm not going to say
[1:01:43] anymore cuz then I got to say everyone.
[1:01:44] And then then if you miss one person,
[1:01:46] they'll think, "Lord, why didn't he call
[1:01:47] me? Am I not one of yours?" You're all
[1:01:49] one of his.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; I'm confident THAT NO MATTER WHAT WEAPON
[1:01:53] IS FORMED against me, no matter what
[1:01:55] scheme the enemy has, no matter how much
[1:01:56] he goes to the realms of darkness and
[1:01:59] plans and schemes to bring me down, I'm
[1:02:00] confident that none of them will work on
[1:02:02] my life. I'm confident that he might
[1:02:04] come right up to the the battle line and
[1:02:06] maybe throw a rock or do something, but
[1:02:08] I'm confident that none of it ultimately
[1:02:10] will avail. I'm confident that we'll all
[1:02:12] be brought to N. No weapon formed
[1:02:13] against me shall prosper.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm confident no matter what I go
[1:02:16] through, I won't I won't go through
[1:02:18] anything more than what I'm able. I
[1:02:20] won't be tested above what I'm able. I
[1:02:22] won't go through some sort of hardship
[1:02:23] and it just breaks me down to where I'm
[1:02:25] finished. I'm confident and I serve a
[1:02:26] God that's loves me more than that. I'm
[1:02:28] confident and I'm confident for you,
[1:02:30] too. Regardless of what you're going
[1:02:31] through, you might think, "Lord, I can't
[1:02:32] take this anymore." If you're taking it,
[1:02:34] you can take a bit more of it.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; And he knows that. But I'm confident
[1:02:39] through every storm, through every
[1:02:40] trial, I'm confident that I'm going to
[1:02:42] come out better. I'm going to come out
[1:02:44] more, have a character that's more like
[1:02:45] Christ. I'm confident of that
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; because that's the God that I serve. And
[1:02:49] I'm confident that the Lord's thoughts
[1:02:51] towards me, his thoughts of love and his
[1:02:54] thoughts of goodness and his thoughts of
[1:02:55] kindness and his thoughts of mercy and
[1:02:57] compassion and grace
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and peace
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and more than the sand on the seashore.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; David said, "If I number them, they're
[1:03:04] more than the sand ON THE SEASHORE." I'M
[1:03:05] CONFIDENT OF THAT.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT GOD'S THOUGHTS
[1:03:09] OF GOODNESS TOWARDS me are innumerable.
[1:03:11] They're like the stars when I look up in
[1:03:12] the heaven. I think every one of those
[1:03:14] thoughts is a thought of is God's good
[1:03:16] thought towards me. I'm confident of
[1:03:18] that. I'm confident that when when we
[1:03:20] wake up in the morning, regardless of
[1:03:22] what happened yesterday, if we failed to
[1:03:23] the worst thing we could ever do, if we
[1:03:25] say, "Lord, I'm sorry." We can wake up
[1:03:26] the next day and that we can wake up
[1:03:28] with a newness of life.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; We can set everything behind us. No
[1:03:31] matter how messy it was, no matter how
[1:03:32] bad it was, we can set it all BEHIND US
[1:03:34] AND I'M CONFIDENT. GOD GIVES US A NEW
[1:03:36] DAY AND SAYS, "WALK FORWARD IN A NEW
[1:03:37] DAY."
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; WALK FORWARD IN CONFIDENCE. DON'T DON'T
[1:03:40] LOSE YOUR CONFIDENCE. If you mess up all
[1:03:42] day, don't worry. You ask for
[1:03:43] forgiveness, you move forward. YOU WALK
[1:03:44] ON IN CONFIDENCE.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; I'm confident. That's who we serve. And
[1:03:48] I'm confident God wants us to do that
[1:03:50] with each other every morning.
[1:03:51] Regardless of what you did last week, I
[1:03:53] don't care. You're you're walking with
[1:03:54] the Lord. It's a new day. It's a new
[1:03:55] week. It's a new Wednesday. It's a new
[1:03:56] Sunday. We're not pushing anyone down.
[1:03:58] We're not holding anyone back. I'm
[1:04:00] confident you feel that way towards me
[1:04:01] cuz I feel that way towards you.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; We're confident because we want we all
[1:04:05] want each other to grow because I'm
[1:04:06] confident God wants the same thing. He
[1:04:08] doesn't he doesn't want to hold
[1:04:10] something over us to push us down. He
[1:04:11] wants us to grow and he doesn't want us
[1:04:13] to do it to each other. He wants us just
[1:04:15] to encourage each other and edify one
[1:04:16] another and build one another up. And
[1:04:19] I'm confident that Satan's trying to
[1:04:21] steal my confidence.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; But I'm confident he's not going to get
[1:04:24] it. [laughter]
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord said, "Cast not away
[1:04:31] therefore your confidence which have
[1:04:33] great recompense of reward." I'm not
[1:04:35] going to cast away my confidence. And
[1:04:36] I'm confident that you won't either. All
[1:04:38] this confidence you have in the Lord,
[1:04:40] even to everything I've said tonight,
[1:04:41] you've said amen because you've got so
[1:04:42] much confidence. every from from the
[1:04:45] from cover to cover in the word OF GOD.
[1:04:46] YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; The and even the the HOLY BIBLE COVER,
[1:04:50] YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN THAT. YOU'VE
[1:04:52] GOT CONFIDENCE IN THE WAYS of God.
[1:04:53] You've got confidence in his dealings.
[1:04:55] If you didn't have confidence, you
[1:04:56] wouldn't be here. But you have
[1:04:57] confidence. And you've got that because
[1:04:59] you're a son of God. And that's an
[1:05:00] inheritance of the the children of God
[1:05:02] is that WE WE HOLD OUR CONFIDENCE
[1:05:04] steadfast to the end. We're always
[1:05:05] confident. We never lose confidence. We
[1:05:07] never let Satan rob us, but we're
[1:05:09] confident.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you a little story real
[1:05:11] quick?
[1:05:13] when Okay, I'm just going to change
[1:05:16] change gear a little bit. Okay, then I'm
[1:05:18] done. We
[1:05:22] wanted to share just a couple of things
[1:05:23] about being
[1:05:26] this is now more in our natural life.
[1:05:27] You know, when we when we walk with the
[1:05:29] Lord, it's nice sometimes we know where
[1:05:32] we're going and sometimes we don't know.
[1:05:34] But it's nice it is nice to have
[1:05:36] confidence to know where you're going,
[1:05:37] especially if you're trying to do
[1:05:39] something for the Lord. Like like
[1:05:40] brother Brandon said, you know, if you
[1:05:42] want to be a missionary in some place,
[1:05:45] he said, you better know, or in other
[1:05:46] words, you better be confident that
[1:05:47] you're called there because Satan's
[1:05:48] going to meet you when you get off the
[1:05:49] plane and test your confidence. You sure
[1:05:52] you should be here? He's going to throw
[1:05:54] everything to to to shun your
[1:05:56] confidence. I had many quotes about
[1:05:58] brother Bram saying that we should have
[1:05:59] confidence in the Lord and we should
[1:06:01] have confidence in our pastor and
[1:06:02] confidence in one another. We got to
[1:06:04] have confidence and and oh, one thing I
[1:06:07] forgot too was God's got confidence in
[1:06:08] us. Yes,
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; I should have put that in. God has got
[1:06:11] confidence in us.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Like he had confidence in Job.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; So much so that he one day bragged about
[1:06:17] him.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Job was just doing his thing and God
[1:06:20] open
[1:06:22] I don't want to make all this but he
[1:06:23] opened up his big mouth cuz he was so
[1:06:24] proud. [laughter]
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Oh Satan, by the way, have you
[1:06:29] considered my servant Job?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; He was so proud of him. Have you
[1:06:32] considered him? [laughter]
[1:06:35] cuz he had confidence in Job that no
[1:06:37] matter no matter what Satan threw at
[1:06:39] Job, Job would continue to serve the
[1:06:40] Lord. God had a confidence in him and
[1:06:42] God's got a confidence in you.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; He sits up there and one day when the
[1:06:45] devil walks past, he says, "Oh, have you
[1:06:47] considered my servant Shannon?" Satan,
[1:06:49] have you considered my servants?
[1:06:52] God's got a confidence.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:06:58] I'm probably talking about this film
[1:06:59] stuff cuz I'm a little bit I'm not far
[1:07:00] off making it, right?
[1:07:03] And and in our walk, we like to know. We
[1:07:05] like to we're not always, even if we
[1:07:08] think we know, we don't always know, but
[1:07:09] we like to we like to have confidence
[1:07:10] that we do know, you know, where we're
[1:07:13] going and what we're doing. And I was
[1:07:16] doing this film stuff's always been an
[1:07:18] effort and I didn't really want to most
[1:07:19] of the time I don't want to take too
[1:07:22] much of a risk on it because I don't
[1:07:23] want to drag anyone else into the whole
[1:07:25] thing. So, so sometimes it gets too much
[1:07:27] and I think, right, I'm just not going
[1:07:28] to do anything. I think I made I made um
[1:07:31] finished off making a bunch of those
[1:07:33] music videos. Then I made the hacker.
[1:07:34] Then I thought I'm not going to make
[1:07:35] anymore. This is like I'm kind of
[1:07:36] sucking away too many people's too much
[1:07:38] too much time and money and things from
[1:07:40] everyone. I'm just going to just going
[1:07:40] to leave it. Not going to do anymore.
[1:07:42] It's just a natural thought, you know,
[1:07:44] you don't want to be a burden. I don't
[1:07:45] want to, you know, put strain on people
[1:07:47] or anything like that. And then I got to
[1:07:49] praying one night and I had this thought
[1:07:51] in my mind that that's what what I was
[1:07:52] going to do. And I guess I was praying
[1:07:53] to tell God that's okay for me to do
[1:07:54] that. You know, sometimes we go into
[1:07:56] prayer to ask God to convince him to
[1:08:00] convince him to say what give us the
[1:08:03] answer that we want to hear. [laughter]
[1:08:06] But Shannon gave me a good quote the
[1:08:07] other day and and you all know it's, you
[1:08:08] know, Brother Vers when we go to prayer,
[1:08:10] we don't we don't change God's mind, God
[1:08:13] changes our mind.
[1:08:16] So I was there and then I I in prayer I
[1:08:18] kept on getting this word crystal. I was
[1:08:20] just praying and then the word crystal
[1:08:21] would come and um you know I think
[1:08:25] that's such a strange word to get
[1:08:26] crystal and then when I finished praying
[1:08:27] the uh I just had this thought the Lord
[1:08:30] said go and go and search the message
[1:08:33] and read I told someone the other day it
[1:08:35] was the 14th but I think it was the
[1:08:36] seventh but they're both the same anyway
[1:08:38] but I think it was the seventh if the
[1:08:39] person listening it was was one of those
[1:08:41] two I think it was the seventh because
[1:08:43] he said read the seventh time it talks
[1:08:45] about crystal now I didn't know about
[1:08:46] crystal or anything I was thinking a
[1:08:48] crystal that isn't a rock and it's like,
[1:08:51] you know, that's when I think crystal.
[1:08:52] Is that what you think? Yeah. Like in a
[1:08:54] rock. So,
[1:08:57] so, so I I but I'm thinking about films
[1:08:59] and not doing anymore and stuff like
[1:09:00] that. So, I I go to the seventh one and
[1:09:04] I think, oh, that's interesting because
[1:09:05] the six before that are talking about
[1:09:07] the Uram and Thum. But this sixth one
[1:09:11] says, Brother Brandon says, I can prove
[1:09:14] right now. Do you want me to paraphrase
[1:09:16] it? He's saying, "I can prove to you
[1:09:17] right now that there's radio waves and
[1:09:18] there's television waves coming through
[1:09:19] this building right now. They're all
[1:09:21] coming through." He says, "But
[1:09:22] essentially saying, but you can't
[1:09:24] capture them. You can't see them because
[1:09:26] you need a crystal that's going to
[1:09:27] capture that radio wave or that
[1:09:29] television wave and then bring that
[1:09:31] thing that you can't see and it's going
[1:09:32] to come through the crystal and push it
[1:09:34] out to reality. You need a crystal to do
[1:09:36] that." And I read that and then the Lord
[1:09:38] spoke and he said, "I have asked you to
[1:09:40] be a crystal, which is take these
[1:09:42] stories in your head and bring them out
[1:09:43] to reality and you're doing everything
[1:09:45] but you're supposed to be a crystal. You
[1:09:47] know, you you'll be the one that
[1:09:48] captures all those things that are
[1:09:49] flying through and make it." So I
[1:09:51] thought, "Okay, I'll make another one."
[1:09:52] So I made another one. Then I didn't
[1:09:54] want to make any more after that. Then I
[1:09:56] went same thing, not not make any more,
[1:10:00] but not be a burden.
[1:10:02] This is maybe years later. I'm just
[1:10:04] showing you about the confidence we can
[1:10:05] have in the Lord, you know, cuz I'm I'm
[1:10:06] confident. Like if the Lord said to me,
[1:10:08] "Oh, you need to be a crystal." I would
[1:10:11] say, "Yeah, but that's just could be my
[1:10:12] brain thinking." But I can't make up I
[1:10:14] get this word and I read it the read the
[1:10:16] seventh time and it says that. I can't
[1:10:18] make that up. The sixth time talks about
[1:10:20] something else, the eighth time about
[1:10:21] something else. I can't make that up. So
[1:10:22] that gives me confidence. Okay, I can't
[1:10:24] make that up.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Like it's I didn't know it was there and
[1:10:29] I didn't think the thought. It just came
[1:10:30] in my brain then I followed it and it
[1:10:32] said that. So therefore, I think, okay,
[1:10:33] Lord, I think you're speaking because
[1:10:34] I'm confident that's how you speak
[1:10:37] and I can sense the spirit of God.
[1:10:40] So then I get this other one years
[1:10:41] later, I get the same thing and I'm
[1:10:43] thinking about and I get this word tide.
[1:10:46] Tide and I think it's such a strange
[1:10:47] word. Why am I getting this word tide?
[1:10:49] Tide. And I'm thinking about something
[1:10:51] about the tide coming in. And I'm
[1:10:52] thinking if there's some something about
[1:10:54] tide, I can't really nothing really no
[1:10:56] deep revelation comes about the tide. So
[1:10:58] I'm thinking, okay, there mustn't I'm
[1:11:00] just thinking things. And then just as
[1:11:01] I've finished my prayer, the Lord said,
[1:11:04] "Go and read in the message and read the
[1:11:06] 14th time that the word tithe is
[1:11:07] mentioned." So the first time is the
[1:11:09] seventh. This one is the 14th. So you
[1:11:10] know, you go to the message search and
[1:11:12] you type in the word ti tied and you go
[1:11:13] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and you get down to
[1:11:16] 14, which is here.
[1:11:20] And brother Brandon was praying and he's
[1:11:21] saying um he's saying about the um
[1:11:28] he says but as we see our nation rolling
[1:11:30] under the tide of judgment he's praying
[1:11:31] he said and we see across the sea yonder
[1:11:33] black arms yellow and brown reaching out
[1:11:36] crying for mercy our hearts are full and
[1:11:39] stirred within us and may the people who
[1:11:41] was to look to this picture this coming
[1:11:44] Sunday if you terry may they catch the
[1:11:45] vision.
[1:11:47] So, and I think to myself, this is so
[1:11:49] strange because I'm I'm referring this
[1:11:50] to movies. And I think, what are the
[1:11:52] chances of the seventh one? And brother
[1:11:53] Brandham is praying for a movie that's
[1:11:54] going to be shown and praying that
[1:11:56] people would catch the vision. So, I
[1:11:57] think, what's he talking about? So I go
[1:11:59] to the start of the sermon and it
[1:12:00] happens to be brother um
[1:12:03] Osborne and he had just been to I think
[1:12:05] it was Nigeria and he had and the Lord
[1:12:08] had done powerful things there and that
[1:12:09] they had taken a film crew there and
[1:12:10] they had documented this this over there
[1:12:12] and they they' made this film about it
[1:12:14] edited it all together and cuz they had
[1:12:16] they had a lot of money that that was
[1:12:18] one of those people. So he edited it
[1:12:19] together and he he and it's like a it's
[1:12:22] a it's a testimony and the people are
[1:12:23] healed and all sorts in it but it's a
[1:12:25] it's a film that they used for to to to
[1:12:28] um
[1:12:30] yeah just that that that lives could be
[1:12:32] touched and I kind of thought what were
[1:12:34] the odds if the cuz I'm thinking I don't
[1:12:36] want to make films anymore then the law
[1:12:37] refers me to this this place where in
[1:12:39] the message he says tide and then it's
[1:12:41] about a it's about it's about this I
[1:12:43] don't know how many times can you know
[1:12:45] of many brothers or people that he
[1:12:47] talked to that made films
[1:12:49] And like in the whole message there
[1:12:51] probably might be this one. Then there
[1:12:52] might be the time when he said um I went
[1:12:54] and watched the ten commandments because
[1:12:55] he got an invite to watch that or some
[1:12:57] of the I think he may may have even been
[1:12:59] the filmmaker but there weren't many
[1:13:01] times where he said oh lord may you
[1:13:02] bless this film and and I just and the
[1:13:04] word tide was in the same sentence and
[1:13:06] then the lord said read that one there.
[1:13:09] I don't know maybe I'm going crazy but I
[1:13:10] don't think I am because every time I go
[1:13:12] like that the lord always seems to get
[1:13:14] some sort of movie thing.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you one more?
[1:13:17] Okay. So,
[1:13:21] two things with the film I'm making.
[1:13:24] I was in two minds. I thought, I don't
[1:13:26] know if I want to do it. But then I and
[1:13:29] I wasn't even even after all these words
[1:13:31] and everything, I was still like, I
[1:13:32] don't know if I want to do this whole
[1:13:34] film thing. Just not sure. So,
[1:13:38] I said to the Lord, "Okay, Lord, what
[1:13:39] I'm going to do, I'm going to I've got
[1:13:42] to I have to know if you want me to do
[1:13:43] this because this is a massive venture.
[1:13:44] So, I've I've got to know. I can't just
[1:13:46] like walk in this haphazardly. I've got
[1:13:48] to be confident. That's what I was
[1:13:49] trying to find from God. Lord, I've got
[1:13:51] to be I won't take too much more of your
[1:13:52] time. I've got to be confident. And you
[1:13:54] should be the same in the things you do
[1:13:55] for the Lord. Lord, I've got to be
[1:13:56] confident.
[1:13:58] Now, you can call me crazy, but this is
[1:14:00] what I did. Okay?
[1:14:02] You'll call me, you will call me crazy,
[1:14:04] but I didn't have enough to do this big
[1:14:06] film. I had enough to make small films,
[1:14:08] short films. I could make those. So, if
[1:14:10] I did some sort of sign, Lord, if this
[1:14:12] comes to pass, make a short film. I can
[1:14:14] do I could I had the means where
[1:14:16] businesses I can make a small one that
[1:14:17] was I could achieve that but a big one
[1:14:20] is a whole different kettle of fish you
[1:14:21] you can't
[1:14:23] I couldn't do a big one I knew I
[1:14:24] couldn't do a big one there is no way
[1:14:26] this is going to happen right no way
[1:14:28] it's going to work I cannot do it and I
[1:14:31] thought I need to have some big sign I
[1:14:33] need to see the hand of God in a way
[1:14:34] that I can't deny it that's just what I
[1:14:37] needed I just I've got to have
[1:14:38] confidence similar to what um the uh
[1:14:42] what's the man's name um that did the
[1:14:45] fleece. Um
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Gideon. Yeah. So it was it was sort of
[1:14:48] like a fleece, but this was a big
[1:14:49] fleece. So I said, "Lord, I'm just going
[1:14:51] to push play on this film and I'm going
[1:14:56] to push play and if it all happens, I'm
[1:14:59] going to know you're with me cuz I don't
[1:15:01] have an I don't have the means to do it
[1:15:02] right now, but I'm going to set
[1:15:03] everything up and I'm going to get this
[1:15:06] whole thing in motion." And there's
[1:15:07] going to be two outcomes. One is I'm
[1:15:09] going to get to a point where I'm going
[1:15:10] to look like the biggest idiot in the
[1:15:11] whole wide world. Yeah.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; And I knew it. Otherwise, Lord, you're
[1:15:15] going to undertake, right? They were the
[1:15:17] two cuz we're talking hundreds and
[1:15:19] hundreds of thousands. It was like,
[1:15:20] okay, this is and and people, it's going
[1:15:22] to be a big disaster. But I thought,
[1:15:24] Lord, I call me crazy, but I kind of I
[1:15:27] can't make this work. So, so that's what
[1:15:29] I did.
[1:15:36] But I I can't remember if this incident
[1:15:39] was before that or after that. Okay.
[1:15:43] I think this was after that, but I'd
[1:15:45] already made a decision. We're going to
[1:15:46] push place. I booked all the crew,
[1:15:47] booked everything, and we went for it.
[1:15:48] Now,
[1:15:50] I'm pleased to announce that the Lord
[1:15:52] supernaturally provided everything just
[1:15:54] one after the other. It was like you
[1:15:56] couldn't write about it. It was just
[1:15:57] like I just couldn't believe how it was
[1:15:58] all unfolding
[1:16:00] till Satan came and hit it. But while I
[1:16:03] was in that time of like, oh, should I
[1:16:05] do this? Should I not?
[1:16:07] I was driving my old car, my my card
[1:16:10] down along the motorway on the um going
[1:16:12] into the city and then it suddenly went
[1:16:14] and it wouldn't drive anymore. It turned
[1:16:16] off. And you remember where we used to
[1:16:18] have the Thanksgiving dinner uh lunch in
[1:16:20] that hall there, right? It's actually
[1:16:22] where we pull off in here, I think.
[1:16:23] Yeah, it is. Yeah. Where we pull off if
[1:16:25] you're coming from upper hut. So I my
[1:16:28] car stopped on the motorway and but I
[1:16:29] was still rolling at 100k and I thought,
[1:16:32] man, I got to roll off the motorway
[1:16:33] somewhere. So that that left was coming
[1:16:34] up. So, I went left, then I managed to
[1:16:36] roll up the hill, and then I went right.
[1:16:38] And then instead of going down to where
[1:16:39] we had the Thanksgiving, I went left and
[1:16:41] I managed to roll up that little bur and
[1:16:42] rolled down to the river. Then I parked
[1:16:44] up by the river and I stopped there and
[1:16:47] I thought, well, that's okay. We're here
[1:16:48] now. [laughter]
[1:16:51] So, so I got out and I was just thought
[1:16:54] this is interesting. When you're a
[1:16:55] Christian, you kind of you always think
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; either this is nothing or this is
[1:16:59] something, you know, just just wait and
[1:17:00] see. Maybe I'm just maybe my whatever.
[1:17:03] But you you're always conscious because
[1:17:04] because we we're confident that we're
[1:17:06] supernatural beings. That we're
[1:17:07] confident we serve a supernatural God.
[1:17:09] So we don't just walk through things not
[1:17:10] thinking. We think about things.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Call me crazy, but that's what we're
[1:17:13] supposed to do. We think. We we we we
[1:17:16] sense and if it's nothing, we think,
[1:17:17] "Oh, it's nothing." But if it's
[1:17:18] something, we know it's something. So
[1:17:20] then I was about to I thought I rang up
[1:17:22] Shannon said, "Oh, can you come pick me
[1:17:23] up? My my I've broken down. Come pick me
[1:17:25] up from this certain place." And I then
[1:17:29] I begin to walk down to the I sort of
[1:17:31] walked down to the river to throw a
[1:17:33] stone in or something, you know, as you
[1:17:35] do. And I walked to the gate and I
[1:17:38] started walking along the grass b along
[1:17:40] the grass sort of bit down to the river.
[1:17:42] And I walked about five steps and
[1:17:43] something said to me, "Go back to the
[1:17:45] gate where you started and count your
[1:17:47] steps down to the river."
[1:17:50] Oh, I got So, you know, you I've got
[1:17:53] nothing else to do. So, not that I
[1:17:56] thought that'd be think, you know, you
[1:17:58] that was a strange thought, but I'll
[1:17:59] just, hey, I'll do it. So, I went back
[1:18:00] to the went back to where the gate
[1:18:02] started and I just walked. Normally, I
[1:18:03] would just walk count 1 2 3 4 5 6. So, I
[1:18:08] and I just walked and there was a there
[1:18:09] was a an a little it was grass, but
[1:18:12] there was a dirt track going down to the
[1:18:14] river that you could see. So, I just
[1:18:16] followed the dirt track around to the
[1:18:17] river. 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74
[1:18:24] 75 76 77 and at 77 my feet were on the
[1:18:28] edge of the riverbank and the number
[1:18:32] step number 78 I was in the river
[1:18:35] and when I got to that point it's kind
[1:18:38] of like you know when the Lord you just
[1:18:39] know when the Lord just speaks and you
[1:18:40] know what it means it's like the Lord
[1:18:41] said jump in the river was in flood this
[1:18:43] was June the Lord said jump in it's
[1:18:46] going to be a rocky road but you're
[1:18:47] going to make it through like you jump
[1:18:49] in that stream, you're going to be up
[1:18:50] and down and but you're going to you're
[1:18:51] going to make it through 78. Jump in.
[1:18:55] And I can't tell you if that was before
[1:18:58] after I said to go for it, but it may
[1:18:59] have been afterwards and give me more
[1:19:01] confidence. But
[1:19:03] later on when I was when I was in a bit
[1:19:06] of a depths of despair cuz Satan chucked
[1:19:07] everything he had at me to stop the
[1:19:08] whole thing. Looked like it was dead in
[1:19:09] the water. I thought, was I going crazy
[1:19:11] that day when I did that thing at the
[1:19:12] river? Was I maybe I was just going
[1:19:15] crazy. So, I actually went back there
[1:19:17] and and thought, I'm going to retrace my
[1:19:19] steps just to give myself a bit of
[1:19:20] confidence. Did Did it Did it happen? I
[1:19:22] took a video. Do you want to watch a
[1:19:23] video?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, no, you don't. Okay.
[1:19:28] [laughter]
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Does now I we need the sound. So, I've
[1:19:32] asked brother Matt if he'll make the
[1:19:34] sound work. Okay. If I do that Oh, will
[1:19:36] you play it on your system? Yeah. Okay.
[1:19:38] Okay.
[1:19:54] Where'd the sound go?
[1:19:57] Pause. Pause. We need the sound. It's
[1:20:00] for added effect.
[1:20:02] You got to know the steps, man.
[1:20:04] Otherwise, you I could be making it up.
[1:20:07] [laughter]
[1:20:10] How would
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; I say it?
[1:20:14] I just And the reason why I'm showing
[1:20:15] this to you is because we want to have
[1:20:16] confidence in God. We we we're confident
[1:20:18] that God's with us. We're confident we
[1:20:20] serve a supernatural God.
[1:20:22] Not yet.
[1:20:24] I'm confident this will work.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I'm confident in Brother Matt. Who's
[1:20:30] confident in Brother Matt?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Like whenever we have problems, tech
[1:20:33] problems, we're confident Matt will
[1:20:34] solve them. [laughter]
[1:20:41] just while they're just messing with
[1:20:43] that. Just pause it. Um I'll just tell
[1:20:45] you the outcome. I'm pleased to announce
[1:20:48] that my my
[1:20:51] um fleece that I put out, I said, "Lord,
[1:20:53] if you're with me, then then I'm going
[1:20:55] to do this thing and it's going to I'll
[1:20:57] finish it." So, in about 3 weeks, it's
[1:21:00] going to be finished. And and the Lord's
[1:21:01] done some drastic things to make it
[1:21:03] finish. So, it gives me a confidence.
[1:21:05] Yes.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; I think Lord, I'm confident that that
[1:21:07] I'm confident in your dealing. I'm
[1:21:09] confident in your dealings with with us.
[1:21:11] And
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; and and I'm confident, Lord, that I'm
[1:21:13] not just like as Paul said, following a
[1:21:16] cunningly devised fables, but I'm
[1:21:17] confident I'm following the Lord.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; And and
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; cuz Satan's going to try and attack our
[1:21:22] confidence and anything you try and do
[1:21:23] for the Lord, and brother Ben would have
[1:21:25] experienced this. No doubt many times
[1:21:26] Satan's attacked his confidence. Oh, you
[1:21:28] can you can't be a pastor. You're no
[1:21:29] good. No, just give up. Walk away.
[1:21:31] Whatever. Christina, look, maybe the
[1:21:32] Lord's not with you because you're
[1:21:33] having all these things happen to you.
[1:21:34] They're trying to just trying to shun
[1:21:36] their confidence. Don't lose your
[1:21:37] confidence. The Lord's with you.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; But that's what Satan does. And you'll
[1:21:41] be the same in your life. You know, as
[1:21:43] you're trying to serve the Lord and it
[1:21:44] doesn't look like things are going your
[1:21:45] way, Satan's going to try and make you
[1:21:46] uncomfort. We going there?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:50] But I only this only just I only
[1:21:52] probably be talking about it because
[1:21:53] this dawned on me like maybe a month ago
[1:21:55] when I you know, Satan was still at me.
[1:21:57] I'm like, "Hang on a minute. My fleece
[1:21:59] that I put out like 5 years ago, it's
[1:22:01] it's here."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Well, that's that's what I
[1:22:04] asked for and that's that's
[1:22:07] what I got.
[1:22:10] I just want to show you this one video
[1:22:11] then I'm then I'm done.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; No, bro. I want audio.
[1:22:21] Can you um
[1:22:23] Does it play? Um
[1:22:32] um what if I go Okay, what if I do this?
[1:22:34] I've got another plan.
[1:22:39] Just wait. I might be able to We both
[1:22:40] push play at the same time. Watch this.
[1:22:44] Um yeah,
[1:22:47] it's this one here.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try Okay. You ready? At the
[1:22:54] start. Go back to the start. I just turn
[1:22:57] this up.
[1:23:00] You 3 2 1. You ready? At the start.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to have started yet.
[1:23:06] Three, two, one.
[1:23:09] All right. I'm going to try and
[1:23:10] duplicate this. So, there's a I started
[1:23:12] from here. And there's a natural track
[1:23:14] around there that just sort of covered
[1:23:16] in there, but that's the way that I
[1:23:17] went. Okay. Let's try this. Ready? 1 2 3
[1:23:22] 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 20
[1:23:33] 21 22 23
[1:23:36] 26 27 28 29 22
[1:23:40] 63 127

[1:23:59] 63 64 65
[1:24:03] 69 71 72 73 74 75 6 78's
[1:24:15] in there.
[1:24:29] from there.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Call me crazy, but that gave me
[1:24:34] confidence
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; cuz I didn't make that up. I didn't make
[1:24:37] up that the car would break. I didn't
[1:24:38] make up that somebody said walk down
[1:24:40] there and take the steps. I didn't make
[1:24:41] it up. I just But I have a confidence
[1:24:43] that I serve a dynamic living God. And I
[1:24:46] have a confidence that you do, too. And
[1:24:48] I have a confidence that we're the bride
[1:24:50] of Jesus Christ and the Lord is doing
[1:24:51] supernatural things in our midst. I've
[1:24:53] got a confidence. That's that's the sort
[1:24:54] of people that we are. So, let's have
[1:24:55] the musicians up. We'll just sing um
[1:24:57] we'll just sing one. Let's sing a fast
[1:24:59] song. Oh, when the saints go marching
