Um thank you brother Isaac for making that available as well. Thank you musicians. Well played. Well, well played. Can we give us hand of applause for them? [applause] Amen. All glory and honor and praise to our king. Amen. Okay, I'll start my little countdown to remind me. Can we um can we open uh our Bibles and we'll we'll read from John 4 23 and 24. while you getting there. Um, Jimmy, if you only knew, where are you now? If you only knew the songs that you picked and how you open with Psalms 150, just stay with me tonight. This is this is excellent how the Lord orchestrates things is it's incredible. And I thought I'm going to give this up because uh brother Ben asked me a while ago uh for the message and I gave him my theme and I go maybe the Lord's going to change it on me now that I said it. But um thank you Lord for for sticking and and uh letting me prepare for this. If you're all uh in your Bibles uh John 4:23, say amen if you're there. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. And then I think I just accidentally put verse 25 there. The woman say unto him, I know that Messiah come of which is called Christ. and she asked her when and and he just says you are speaking to him. &gt;&gt; This is him. You may take your seats tonight. Um may the Lord bless the reading of his word and encourage you all. My theme tonight is worship. Um it is a very simple thing to preach on or to minister on. Um but it is so profound and it can go very deep very quickly. So, um, if you would bear with me, I'll have I've got a few slides, kitties. I've got a few pictures. There we go. We started with a picture. Um, but I I just felt I wanted to to lay a bit of a foundation of of where does worship fit into our lives as believers? Um, where does music fit in? I've had these two main themes, and we'll jump uh between them a little bit. So, I just wanted to color in the picture of of what is worship? what is worship for us. So the first thing you would know me being um having English as a second language uh I need to go and find the definition of worship and worship is a reverent honor and homage paid to God or sacri personage or to any object regarded as sacred. So there's the first question is like okay so who are we worshiping? &gt;&gt; What are we worshiping? adoring reverence or regard excessive worship of business success. I've seen that in some of my family's life where ambition takes over. They make their first million and they start to go, "Oh, it took me two years to get to this million. Maybe another two years and I can have two million. Maybe another four years and I can five million." And that takes over their lives and that am ambition becomes a worship. And typically, there we go, the synonym is idolatry, adoration, homage, and honor. An object of adoring, reverence, or regard. And then from the Strongs or from the um from the Greek um worship in um in the Bible is pro proc to crouch. And now it's talking about and please bear with me here. It's it's it's it's falling face down or prostrate in adoration. A physical act of lowering oneself in a humble submission with an attitude of utmost adoration or respect. So please keep that in mind because the natural meets the spiritual. If we're talking about and and if that is what the word is saying, what are we doing then spiritually? If this is a a physical act um this was very very nice just the continuation of it has been metaphorically described as the kissing ground between believers the bride you me and Christ the heavenly bridegroom um while it's true so it suggest the willingness to make all necessary physical gestures of obesence obeisance again I had to go and look up what is this obeisance Then all these new words, brother N. What's happening here? But I've got you. I've got you. It's a movement of the body made in token respect and submission. Bow. After his there's a example after making his obeasance, he approached the altar. So there's that form of respect again. Um, so with this in mind, where have I seen worship and where have you seen worship? Uh, the easiest thing to reflect back to is our recent camp. So, who've had it who's had a tremendous time at camp? &gt;&gt; I mean, um, as my theme was for the camp and my prayer was, Lord, make it profound. Make it something that's everlasting. And um by these examples I'm going to give you, I saw worship in the 99 sheep and I saw it in the one lost sheep. I saw it everywhere and that was that was just really beautiful. It came together so nicely and sometimes it's a privilege to be a deacon. We can see a lot of things and um from the back and and this is now all positive. So my first example was a brother that called was was called to the front and was asked forgiveness on behalf of those that hurt not knowing what is happening in the heavenly in in the heavenly realm. So there was so much movement and and that that moment was so so profound when brother John just called him up and how that came together and he he didn't know. I he probably still doesn't know but it was profound that it happened at our camp and that it happened in in such a way. Um the Lord's been pressing on my heart to to do to to to act on the same thing. Um where people are let's say cultures of past of historical like us coming from South Africa where where my forefathers hurt and I want to step in that gap and say but I want to ask for forgiveness on their behalf. They didn't know what they were doing. I you know so it will come. it will come and the Lord will place it on my heart. Another example was a new brother in Christ. It was so lovely to see this transformation within a couple of days. He was starting with his walk with the Lord and how the Lord just opened up his storehouse of this agape love. All of a sudden, he receives this, you know, healing and restoration of his soul and he's seeing it and and he wants to show it now by a embrace, by a hug, you know. He couldn't wait to to embrace us and to say, "I love you." you, you know, it was just overflowing and and and and there's no way he could have put it on. There was no way that um that was just, you know, uh a camp thing or a emotional thing. So I really treasured it and and I'm and I'm praying uh fervently for that brother that he stand fast in faith. Then one of the highlights was the the two sisters stomping on Satan's head with victory in their countenance. I couldn't I I cannot I cannot take away that picture. Now maybe from the flesh the the girls would go, "Oh my my my and I didn't look that nice." But what I saw was victory. What I saw was overcoming power. What I saw was the reality of the Holy Ghost in their lives. And they, as I said before, I won't change it. They were leaving earth. They were in a different space, in a different environment in that moment. And and I and I thank the Lord that I could walk past at that point and and see something like that. I said, "That is true worship." In my mind, I said, "Lord, that's worship." Now, this theme was going on already in my in my head. But when I saw that, the Lord was gracious enough to say that if you wanted to see worship, there's worship. That's worship. [snorts] And then a lot of people probably don't know the minister, brother John Andes on Sunday afternoon was physically literally the last person to leave the sanctuary. He was overwhelmed is one of the words that came to mind. I went in into the minister's office and just made sure, is he all right? Do you need a drink? Is he okay? And and he was just almost flabbergasted. He was just in awe and and and enjoying this presence of God. He just didn't want to let it go. I just that's what his face told me. And I I again, it's such a privilege to see those moments. And no, I'm leaving this building, but the minister, he's still staying. The minister is just so so in awe of the presence of the Lord in that environment. So well done to you all of you, not only the musicians, but setting that atmosphere of worship and so that the Lord and the Holy Ghost just lingers and just you know can can can um can minister back to a minister back to a preacher. That was beautiful to see. Now the next I I went now and that that's my what what does the what does the prophet say about worship? Um and he says a lot about worship. Um, now that we have the reality of camp and how how I think worship looks like, I wanted to see if that doveetales what what brother Brandham sees. And here in the sermon he they are singing. So there's always some song um uh relation or or the the the the sermon is done, the message has been given and then now they you know start singing a bit bit of a chorus and then this the scene is set. The the the the time for worship is now and that's what he's saying here. So they singing this song for this bright city John was going down and right at the bottom he says don't you just love him? The message is over now. This is worship. We don't come to church just to hear the message. We come to worship. Just forget about the person next to you. Just worship him. Oh, how beautiful. How wonderful. Just just tell him. You don't have to tell him loud. Just tell him in your heart, I love you, Lord. Forgive me of my sin. Oh my. So then when I went on to this journey and that's why I said such a profound little theme that it just took me. So please bear with me. This is just I found it as gold. So I'm I'm sort of ministering to myself here. And then where where's he's singing again, you know, there at the cross where I where he took me and glory to his name. And then he switches and he goes, "Oh, I just love this way. I love to worship God in quietness in like this." Now he's singing and then he's going um God in quietness like this. If you listen to the sermon, you know, there's the people are singing and praising the Lord, but it drops down. There's there's a penny drop. It's it's it's something that's got some real meaning to it. Just feel that something is near. What happened at the altar call when those sinners accepted Christ? The angels raised up from their seats. So they they observe true worship now as well. See what's make you feel this way. This is worship. When the soul is worshiping God, the the word has gone forth. See the Holy Spirit is blessing and watering now. And then the song continues again and he just goes into that uh our heavenly father as the beautiful sacred presence of the Holy Spirit now standing here blessing his children. Many times many times he has to correct them. For every son that cometh to God must first be chasened and tried. Receive child training and reproofs. No exceptions everyone. But when we endure the correction of our father, then it health through forth the present and pleasant fruit. That's just so beautifully put. I pray God that you'll just let each child know that. Not go away. Just kind of imagine that. Let them know that this is your blessings to them. &gt;&gt; The sincere milk of the gospel pouring down in their soul. Milk and honey out of Canaan's land. new wine to stimulate in their faith worshiping and this is now referring back to that prostrate is hearts bowed before thee the spiritual hands up tears running down cheeks quietly reverently worshiping and I just oh I can go on and on and on how the Lord's just um blessed me with with the quotes and then there's a are we here now Yes. Oh God, I'm so happy. I just love you so Lord. I want to express to you my feeling. You see now like all of that says the message has been given. I'm giving you the message and then the message will stop and and you will start as as I told the other day start regurgitate on it and and in your mind um you you you you relaying this back to the Lord. Lord what I what am I grasping from this? What is in it for me? What do I need to take away from here? And and in that moment, that that's where you're now starting to to reflect, starting to praise the Lord, starting to enter into worship where you go, Lord, I'm nothing and you are everything. What more can I give so that you can come in? And that we will get to now. expressing that every uh the very adoration of my heart that I adore thee, thou matchless one. I love thee. Beautifully put. And then uh this is this is now where uh almost there. Yeah. U second to last quote I think for now. Now with our heads bowed quietly. Now this is worship. The message is over. No one leaves. Just be quiet. Let's worship. The message is the correcting. Now think over now what you've done, what you should have done. What made you what you are today? What makes you condemned today is because you did something yesterday or what will it be tomorrow? Now this is critical. Make it right today and you'll be free tomorrow. See, you must make a choice. How can you do it? By faith. I now let loose of everything. Now that is basically surrendering. That is saying Lord I cannot I cannot hold and and if you go into the world if you if you work like me and and and some of the brothers here some of you young ones already in in a workplace situation it's it's selfish. It's hard. It's confusing. as people that got a short temper and and you know we're not we're not receiving it there. So we need to say well they can't make it. They're not making it. I'm seeing it. I don't want to be that. Lord come into my life and make make yourself h everything in me. I now let loose and someday I'm going to go over there. Amen. And here's a little the the next one is the little segue. So um you know sometimes I I do appreciate some numbers and when I looked at the numbers I go oh this is slide 17 is the next one. 17 for me is a new dispensation means it's a direction change of a different angle and this is just how the Lord led it to be in my in my little slight black pack back. God likes to be worshiped. And when you worship him, it isn't exactly singing a song as we do, but singing it in the spirit of worship. You see, then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back. Now, I've written here theophony. That's when you when you bump into, you know, you you hear the brushing of the angel's wings. There's just you are in a different realm and you don't know what's going around you. You you've left earth as I as I talked about. And that was that was critical because that's um that's the turning point now for where where I want to lead to and one of the main things that we shouldn't misunderstand about worship and that is music. Now music is not worship. I'll just put it out there. But it is a very powerful tool that gets us into an atmosphere of of of worship. Now let's be clear. God created music, &gt;&gt; right? It comes from him. The original seed, the original sheet music. It is him. Okay? He made it in the simplest form to be the simplest form to enter in in an atmosphere of worship. But with the original, there comes perversion. And the heavenly songs and rhythms change to the to the contrary. And some of the examples I was thinking about is if you go if you ride the train to work and back, what do you see? All the people sitting on their little headphones, you know, not talking to each other. Very antisocial in this social media age. Um it's sometimes even in my house. Um, not that that's wrong, but do you think they're all listening to gospel music on the train? &gt;&gt; I think not. Now, but and as as as I'll get to it now, that's they feeding on it. And whatever that music is is driving him to some sort of atmosphere of worship, worship of something contrary, right? So, we all with me say amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. And everyone is seeking after their own little fix, right? So there's a chemical reaction that happens in you when you listen to music. I'm not going to go into depth. Someone else a bit more competent can do that, but it's called dopamine. It's a little, you know, little get getter upper and um and people feel good when they listen to music. It's just a it's just a scientific fact. So, I wanted to uh drop this in here that uh a few like a little testimony of music and my life before Christ and and sort of where I'm now. Someone told me once that um when I asked them actually, ironically, why are they constantly listening to music? Can't they just sit in silence? Now, I would go and walk in the in the in the field. I would go on a hunt. I would, you know, and I I enjoy the silence. I I love listening to God's creation, smelling the fresh grass, maybe smelling a deer if it's close by, but um I I enjoy the silence. I don't have to have headphones. Sometimes they they drive in their cars with the headphones on. And for me, I I just Is that safe? You know, so for me it was easy to to switch off to pause to to to hear the Lord in his creation, but they said no, I can't be left with my own thoughts. So I thought that is incredible that they need to keep on this listening to music or getting them on some sort of segue so that they don't think about their own thoughts. What a dangerous dangerous spot that you are in. So yes, few testimonies of of music and how music can cause the atmosphere and will uh believe it or not if you look at my stature. One time I was gming. I was uh I was heavy in the in the weights department and I wanted to be the strongest in the gym and lifted a lot of things. Do you think I listen to opera music and what what was blaring in my ears? uh a little classical or maybe even jazz. No, no, no, no, no. You wanted to, you know, lift heavy stuff. So, it's heavy metal or it's um and it's rock or whatever, you know. So, I always wanted to Now, here was the ironic bit and that's probably the how the Lord created me. I sweat a lot. So, headphones on my ears or in my ears that just didn't work. So, I would sneakily go to the reception and say, "Hey, can you play this or can you have this little, you know, CD going?" so that I can, you know, pump my jams and and uh yeah. So, how how I had to use that and rely on that to to, you know, get me into that zone where I can lift all the things I want to lift. And then the car I uh London can testify to this. I would have people um maybe you won't know, but we called it CDs. This is this nice little thing, little silver thing, you know, and it spins around. Um, it's awesome if you put it in the microwave. I didn't give you that advice, but um, take all the old CDs that's non- gospel and throw it in the microwave for 12 seconds. Um, I would I would write these little CDs so you could write your own music and I and I would have these little themed it said on the thing. I didn't write the songs. I said this is the theme. So adrenaline rush or smooth or cruisy or road trip, you know, that was my theme. So I would always write these little and that puts you in that atmosphere of, you know, so use that there. I I would lay with I had a Walkman. I don't think of you know Walkman, little Sony Walkman. Uh when I was in service here for Christ, we had long days and I just wanted to chill, you know, just had your shower. Now you're back in this bunk bed and everyone's snoring at the top. So, putting in the headphones and just listening to um one of my favorites was um how lovely is your dwelling place, oh Lord Almighty. I don't know if you know it but better as one day in your house and a thousand elsewhere. And that's sort of what I I enjoyed with it. So now the gospel is now creeping in, you know, now good music is there, but there's still, you know, lively little Christian rock and all that that sneaks in because it sets that atmosphere, right? Um, at that moment, it just let me forget about everything. Doesn't matter which the what the atmosphere or what the music or the style or the theme was. I would just all my situations and and problems or what I were dealing with would just disappear for that for that moment. Now, it made me wonder where did this perversion come from? Where did it all go wrong? You know, we had music. God created music for us to enter into worship. Where did it go all wrong? And we do find it in the scriptures, believe it or not. Isaiah 14:11, "Your pomp has been brought down to sh which is the depths which is uh which is hell along with the music of your harps. Maggots are your bed and worms your blanket." This is a different um translation. I think it's a Berean translation and I thought just that that that is is quite descriptive and it's very interesting that brother Jimmy read Psalms 150 talking about harps talking about the um trimble uh tabret and I've got it now you'll see uh it it just dovetales so wonderfully because David's talking about the original &gt;&gt; praise him with this &gt;&gt; we he gave us this creativity this creative power to make this but don't Use it for the perversion. Don't use it for the bad. &gt;&gt; Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus. Now, king of Tyrus here is referring to Satan within that king. The the the the the prophet talks about Tyrus didn't live in the day. You'll see now this sayaith the Lord, thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. See now that perfect in beauty. There's a countenance talking about here. Thou has been in Eden, the garden of God. So Tyrus was clearly not in Eden. That's why we're referring to Satan which is in him in the garden of Eden. Every precious stone was thy covering. Now he names all of it. Sardius, topaz, diamond, barrel, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle and gold. So you see now this brightness, this countenance, this this perfect in beauty. Look at me. Okay. And then the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes. Now, interestingly, lots of the other translations go towards workmanship, as in work with the till, work with instruments or implements. But we're talking here about about musical um apparatus, tablets, and of thy pipes was um prepared in thee in the day that thou was created. Just show you. Hey, and then the power of music. I want to talk about the power of music. music does evoke uh a sense of wonder and awe for lots of people. Now, this is Daniel Leventon, neuroscientist at McGill University, who scans the brain of people while they're listening to tunes, right? Music does evoke Oh, sorry. Uh some of it is still mysterious to us, he says. But what we can talk about are some neural circuits or uh networks involved in the experience of pleasure and reward. Remember that pleasure and reward. We imagine uh why do I feel this way? Why is this music teaching me what is vast and mysterious? Music allows us to feel these transcendent emotions. He says right emotions like awe which stimulates the brain into a sense of wonder help the current epidemic of our times which is loneliness. Kelner says with music we uh feel we're part of community and that has a direct effect on health and being which is crucial to survival. That could be why music plays such a powerful role in many religions, spirituality, and rituals. He says now, the power of music in the wrong hands. And I've got a few, just a couple of examples. There's a vast amount of examples out there of individuals that's using music uh in the wrong way. So, it started off beautiful. It started off correct. It started off clean and pure, but perversion sets in. Talking about Katy Perry. Anyone knows Katy Perry? Oh, how do you know them? Huh? Okay, we'll pray for you. Eh, before the world knew her as a hit maker uh of the her songs, Katie was just a California girl with a dream and a gospel background. Born into a conservative family, her first notes were sung in a church pew. Not packed stadium, she released gospel album into her teens. But deep down, she was meant for more than just a choir stand. Yes, she was meant for more. She was meant to be a godly lady dressed prop appropriately, standing in a pew next to her uh her children, showing them uh being a role model of what the the stature of a perfect woman should be. that was meant for more. But no, she had this little thought of uh hey, I'll just sell my soul. I'll just give up because powerful music and changed into which atmosphere of worship is this leading me. Right. And there it all started with good intentions. Another example, Jimmy, guess what we sang tonight. So you know this song. When this life is over, I I know I'll see your face. Every night I pray, every step I take, every move I make, every single day, every night I pray. It sounds okay. Sounds okay. Do anyone know this song? That's good. Thank you. Ah, we do. We do. Okay. Fish, I also I I knew this song before I researched it. Um, it's Puff Daddy. You probably don't know who's Puff Daddy because he's changed his name 700 times. He's now P Diddy and he's in trouble. Yes. So now he steals songs. He steals the original. And by the way, the other bit, Every Night I Pray, Every Step I Take is also stolen from another musician. Not godly, but it shows you where it starts and where it transcends to and where Okay. I won't go into too much of that. I don't want to be negative. It's not all negative, but God gives warnings. And do we heed to these little signposts and as as we are tonight? And one thing that stood out and sort of that is one of the first things I put into this thought was was a guy called Don Potter. Some people would know this. Uh Don Potter is from Morning Star Ministries. He's an old fellow now. So this is this is probably 90s I would think. Facing the wall. Facing the wall. Now this is what he said what the Lord talked to him. I've spent many years trying to entertain people and later lead them into the praise of the Lord Jesus. In the middle of leading praise one night or day. I believe the Lord uh uh uh said, "Go home and play until you discern my presence." I did this by facing the wall and playing the guitar. At first, I could only play a few minutes before the desire to entertain crept back in. After a year, after one year, I could play for hours and never realize it happens. You know, never realize that I want to entertain or want to. And look at this. The pleasure of the Lord was better than any reward I had ever ever received. So, I just wanted to flick back quickly to remind you of what uh what music does. Where is it now? Oh, sorry. I think I was I was reading it from here. So from here it said that music um we can talk about some neural circuits of networks involved in the experience of pleasure and reward and the pleasure of the Lord was better than any reward I'd ever ever receive. And that I got for free this afternoon when I said oh I said this and and this tied in. So praise the Lord. Praise the Lord for that. So, someone heeded to that call. Someone heeded to that warning and say, "Hey, hang on. I'm using this powerful tool for the wrong thing. I'm going into worship, but worshiping what? Something contrary to what the Lord's created it for." And this is just a a friendly uh reminder. It's not to, you know, tap anyone over the uh over the fingers or anything. It is for me as well a very good reminder because what goes in will come out. What are you feeding on? The white dog or the black dog. Be very um attentive. What are you listening to is taking you where? It's taking you to what you know is it is it down memory lane? Is it is it into history? Is it away from the Lord? You would know this. &gt;&gt; Um be honest with yourself. And in closing, I um I wrote down just a few things that that I wanted to to leave with you when we are and while we are going into into prayer tonight that what or who is your God? So remember I said I gave you the the the definition of what's worship, right? And worship we can go back. What is worship? But God, the word God is an object of worship. So what is your God? That's why I'm saying it in this way. And what what what are you what are you worshiping? So this God, what do you worship? Are you are you worshiping in spirit and truth? What are you worshiping when you are at church? Are you here just to sing a song or hear a message or are you here to worship? Now that comes from brother Brandon. That comes from his message. He says we we we can't just be here to sing a song, clap clap a few hands and uh and and and and and listen to the message. It needs to go beyond that. So whatever has been given to you by the Lord, what are you what are you feeding then on and what what are you doing with it when it when it's when it's in you and it's and it's and it's pricricked your heart. So worshiping in spirit and in truth, what's the spirit and what is truth? Um it is sort of rhetorical. you would know this, but I wanted to leave it with you so that you can go into your prayer closet and and talk to the Lord and and just adore him as as brother Brandham said here in one of his quotes um and and and worship him. And where and when do you worship? Now, because we we we we read there what is worship? If I if you wanted to, I'll just give you a reverent honor and homage pay to God in this case. Let's pay to to Jesus Christ our our savior that died on the cross, right? Um to fall, to crouch, a humble submission with an attitude of adoration. You can do that anywhere. &gt;&gt; It is not just at church. It's not just at home. It's not just in your prayer closet. Is when I get in the car six o'clock in the morning driving to work, I'd put on a tape. Maybe I do. Some days I just drive in silence. It's the most beautiful time and the Lord placed something in me or I start to just yo Lord, thank you for this wonderful day. I see the birds chirping and everything and everything is going well. You're looking after my family. Praise you. I'm I'm busy worshiping, right? Um I I was uh another example in in at camp early in the morning. So, we go and tidy up the uh the auditorium and do a bit of a freshen up and check the bathroom. So all that in that in that I'm thinking oh how how wonderful was last night what was what was said again what did I see what did I observe what came in and I stopped and I and I and I and I and I was up with my hands I said Lord you are a magnificent he hasn't left that presence he hasn't left now and went to sleep he's there he's waiting for us again so that atmosphere was set that was beautiful because now I know in my in myself. I'm busy worshiping and it's 5 seconds and I walked I was going over the bridge and there was something that pricked me again. I go, "Oh man." Started singing, started rejoicing, you know, Psalm 150. Praise him. Praise him anyway. You can praise him. You know, make him your adoration. So you can worship him anywhere. Anywhere. Anywhere. Children, anywhere. Don't wait for church. Worship him anywhere. all these little songs that you sing. Maybe I can give a little testimony. Hopefully hopefully Daniel won't mind. Um he said uh he's walking past and u was it your nose? There was something that just irritated him and he goes, "Satan, I'm tired of you and just, you know, just get out." And but in the in the I'm busy. And he just walks and minutes go by. I go, "Is that what I heard?" You know, he was just, we would say in Africans, he was dropping him eight. He was just putting him in his place right there, right there, just in his in his conversation, in his walk. I go, "That's right. Amen." And I'm clip art. Amen. You know, all loud, but no one's there. I go, "Praise the Lord." That's that's for me. That's worship. That's that's realness. And that's when when revelation and the penny drop. So, thank you so much for your time. Let's let's go and stand. Let's have the musicians which can lead us into an atmosphere of worship. Praise the Lord. Uh I don't have a song. Do you have a song, Jimmy? Um I I actually contacted Sister Latab because I wanted to have a specific song was playing in my head the whole week and I forgot she's in Oakuckland. So uh that didn't didn't help. Oh, we can actually sing. Um can we do the raise a hallelujah? Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; H you you want to sing it? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Jimmy did well.

Are we worshiping ourselves, worshiping our ego, worshiping a religion, or worshiping the Lord God Almighty, the living word? Amen. Praise the Lord. You know, I think it was King Jehoshaphat. He um you know, the enemy who was out, he was well outnumbered. They were going to be uh destroyed, but they he brought all of the people to Jerusalem. They prayed and and God spoke through someone saying, "You go out. I'm going to I'm going to give you the victory. What did he do? He sent out singers first. That's why we can sing a raise a hallelujah. The prince of our enemy. Amen. We worship. Then you bring you put God in control of every situation. Amen. So, praise the Lord.
