[38:47] me a
[38:48] fancy kind of computer thing here so i
[38:51] got new toys but i you know
[38:53] god bless you uh malachi 3 and 6.
[38:57] for i am the lord i change not
[39:00] therefore ye sons of jacob are not
[39:01] consumed but from that part i'll say
[39:03] i for i am the lord i change not he
[39:06] can't change
[39:07] and then hebrews 13 8 i know this
[39:10] everyone should
[39:11] be able to just speak it without even
[39:14] turning to it but
[39:16] amen we uh maybe maybe let's just let's
[39:18] just read this one
[39:20] together shall we jesus christ the same
[39:23] yesterday and today and forever amen
[39:26] should we do that one more time jesus
[39:28] christ
[39:28] the same yesterday and today and forever
[39:32] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[39:34] this word you may have your cease
[39:35] tonight
[39:36] and i want to um i was i was um
[39:40] i didn't read the article necessarily
[39:42] but it was on the bbc there's an article
[39:44] speaking about how to function in times
[39:46] of uncertainty
[39:47] and this is truly an uncertain time but
[39:49] you know
[39:50] this is the natural world trying to give
[39:52] advice how to function
[39:53] in times of uncertainty but you know we
[39:56] really know how to function in times of
[39:57] uncertainty
[39:58] amen but i want to i want to really just
[40:01] if all you get out of this service is
[40:02] that god can't change and he doesn't
[40:04] change well that's really where i'm
[40:05] going to go
[40:06] but you know i'm so thankful we serve a
[40:08] god that cannot change
[40:09] and he does not change he does not
[40:11] change his word whatever he spoke he
[40:13] does not deviate does not change one bit
[40:15] his word is his word he does not back up
[40:17] on any promise
[40:18] amen but he's fully invested his whole
[40:20] him whole self behind every promise
[40:22] amen in his word so brother ram says in
[40:25] the message hearing recognizing acting
[40:27] on the word of god in 1960
[40:29] he says now that is always has been
[40:31] always will be god's program
[40:33] god cannot change his program because he
[40:36] makes his program perfect
[40:38] because it's part of him so his program
[40:41] is a part of him
[40:42] and and when you see his program you
[40:44] should be able to see his character
[40:46] within his program so for example his
[40:48] program is redemption
[40:49] because he is a redeemer his program is
[40:51] salvation because he is a savior
[40:53] and his program is healing because he's
[40:55] a healer and his program is to be a
[40:57] father to the fatherless he is a father
[40:59] i mean to be a comforter because he is a
[41:01] comforter right i mean to be a redeemer
[41:03] amen to
[41:04] to to also be a judge because he's going
[41:06] to judge the devil in his works
[41:08] amen because he's a judge amen amen and
[41:10] his program
[41:11] is salvation because he's a savior he's
[41:13] a lamb he's a high priest
[41:15] you see all of his nature is manifested
[41:17] in his program
[41:18] now brother braham tells us this is an
[41:20] um this is from the
[41:21] ephesian church age in the church age
[41:23] book um
[41:25] this is brother man spoken uh speaking
[41:27] about how he picked the messenger for
[41:29] for each age but he says the key given
[41:32] to me of the lord whereby i was
[41:34] able to determine the messenger for each
[41:36] age as a most scriptural one
[41:38] in fact it might be called the keystone
[41:41] to the whole bible
[41:43] it is the revelation that god never
[41:45] changes and that his ways are
[41:47] unchangeable as he is
[41:49] in hebrews 39 it says jesus christ the
[41:51] same
[41:52] yesterday today and forever ecclesiastes
[41:55] 3 14 and 15
[41:56] i know that whatsoever god doeth it
[41:58] shall be forever
[41:59] nothing can be put to it nor anything
[42:02] taken from it
[42:03] and god doeth it that man should fear
[42:06] before him
[42:07] that which hath been is now and that
[42:10] which is
[42:10] uh which is to be hath already been
[42:14] and god require that which is past here
[42:16] it is an unchanging god with unchanging
[42:19] ways
[42:20] what he did at the first he will have to
[42:22] keep on doing until it is
[42:24] done for the last time there will never
[42:26] be a change
[42:27] apply that to the church ages the kind
[42:29] of man that god chose for the first age
[42:31] and how god manifested in that man's
[42:33] ministry would be an example for
[42:36] all other ages what god did in the first
[42:38] church age is what he wants to do in
[42:40] all other ages now we find now we know
[42:42] exactly from the word
[42:44] which was recorded by the holy spirit
[42:46] how first the the first original church
[42:49] was founded
[42:50] and how god manifested himself in her
[42:52] the word can't change or be changed
[42:54] because
[42:54] the word is god john 1 1 in the
[42:57] beginning was the word and the word was
[42:59] with god and the word was god
[43:01] to change one word of it as that eve
[43:03] brings death a sin and death
[43:05] even as it says in revelations 22 if any
[43:07] man
[43:08] shall add unto these things god shall
[43:10] add unto him the plagues that are
[43:11] written in this book
[43:12] if any man shall take away from the
[43:14] words which are
[43:16] the words of the book of this prophecy
[43:18] god shall take away his part out of the
[43:20] book of life
[43:21] and out of the holy city and from the
[43:22] things which have written in this book
[43:24] that's what the church was at pentecost
[43:26] is the standard that is the pattern
[43:28] there is no other pattern no matter what
[43:30] the scholars say
[43:31] god has not changed that pattern what
[43:33] god did at pentecost he has to keep on
[43:36] doing
[43:36] until the church ages close so god can't
[43:39] change
[43:40] i mean so the same god that's been
[43:42] through history is the same god today
[43:44] you know
[43:44] you'd say it was brother braham's battle
[43:46] cry was jesus christ the same
[43:49] yesterday today and forever he wanted
[43:50] the people to say he's still the same
[43:52] he hasn't changed time hasn't changed
[43:54] him you know different
[43:55] you know different society hasn't
[43:56] changed him he's still the same god
[43:58] and his word is still the same now as i
[44:01] said in the beginning that that god
[44:03] manifests his character in his program
[44:05] so
[44:06] he is a sacrifice he is the lamb he is
[44:09] the propitiation for our sins
[44:11] now it says in hebrews 9 that this is
[44:13] the blood saying this is the blood of
[44:15] the testament which god hath enjoined
[44:16] unto you
[44:17] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[44:19] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[44:20] the ministry
[44:21] and almost all things are by the law
[44:23] purged with blood and without shedding
[44:25] of blood
[44:26] is no remission so there must be a blood
[44:28] shed in order
[44:29] for there to be a remission of sin now
[44:31] that word remission means a cancellation
[44:33] of a debt
[44:34] a charge or a penalty so the penalty
[44:36] just gets canceled i mean it gets taken
[44:38] away hallelujah
[44:39] i mean so that's what the shedding of
[44:41] blood does now now some might think well
[44:44] you know seeing is believing
[44:47] but seeing is not believing many people
[44:50] saw him die on calvary
[44:51] but they didn't become believers many
[44:53] people saw him multiply the bread and
[44:55] the loaves and you know do many
[44:57] mighty acts but it didn't make him
[44:58] believers i say even in this day
[45:00] they saw god do incredible things i mean
[45:03] we're even even even church historians
[45:05] said that william brown's ministry
[45:07] was the spare head of the post-world war
[45:09] ii healing revival
[45:10] many people saw many things but it
[45:12] didn't make them believers but you know
[45:13] so
[45:13] seeing is not believing but it's
[45:15] actually when god gives us
[45:17] an ear to hear as down through the
[45:19] church ages to him that hath an
[45:20] ear let him hear what the spirit says to
[45:22] the church now we know that that air is
[45:24] not an audible ear
[45:26] i mean but it's actually in the soul
[45:28] there's something there's an ability to
[45:29] hear the word and to receive it
[45:31] amen and that's why that's what set the
[45:33] apostles apart from the scribes and
[45:35] pharisees as they had
[45:36] they were ordained to hear i mean they
[45:38] heard
[45:39] physically the same words but the
[45:42] disciples heard it in a different way
[45:44] that describes them pharisees because
[45:45] the reason is
[45:46] that that their that their response to
[45:48] the word one group said this is messiah
[45:50] and the other group said this is
[45:52] beelzebub two very polar opposites one
[45:54] is the chief of devils and one is god
[45:56] manifested in the flesh the messiah so
[45:58] you know it's it's it it's given to a
[46:01] people
[46:01] to hear amen blessed are your ears for
[46:04] they hear
[46:05] and your eyes that they see hallelu the
[46:07] things that you see in this day
[46:10] i mean to sing is not believing because
[46:12] some people think well
[46:13] if only you know i wasn't in pilot's
[46:15] judgment hall when he took those stripes
[46:17] so how could i know
[46:19] that you know by his stripes i'm healed
[46:21] or i wasn't there on golgotha when he
[46:23] died for me
[46:24] so you know how do i know that he really
[46:26] how did it you know how do i know that
[46:28] he really did it
[46:30] you know the simple fact is if if you've
[46:33] been given an
[46:34] heir to hear then then what what
[46:36] happened there on that day
[46:37] is attributed to you remember jesus had
[46:40] so many names in the book of la
[46:42] land's book of life and when he when he
[46:44] went up calvary he had those names on
[46:46] his heart
[46:48] hallelujah remember remember he came he
[46:50] shall be called jesus
[46:51] he shall save his people from their sins
[46:54] amen so he had your name
[46:56] the joy set before him was you redeemed
[46:58] hallelujah so when he went up calvary he
[47:00] had
[47:00] you on his mind going up the hill i mean
[47:03] so
[47:04] now now in the old testament when we
[47:07] look at the shedding of blood for the
[47:09] remission of sin
[47:10] we know that the high priest once a year
[47:12] took the blood into the holy of holies
[47:14] very few people saw the high priest walk
[47:16] in
[47:17] and i'm not talking even into the holy
[47:19] of holies because he was the only one
[47:20] that went in but even into the inner
[47:21] court
[47:22] very few people saw him there very few
[47:24] people saw him you know take the blood
[47:26] and walk in but after he came out after
[47:30] sprinkling the blood so no one actually
[47:31] physically saw him sprinkle the blood on
[47:33] the mercy seat
[47:34] it was only him and god but then when he
[47:37] came out
[47:38] there was a blowing of a trumpet amen
[47:41] and everyone who heard the jubilee
[47:43] trumpet because the blowing of that
[47:44] jubilee trumpet is connected with the
[47:46] blood being offered on the mercy seat
[47:48] i mean so as those who heard the trumpet
[47:50] they had to believe
[47:52] that the blood was now offered on their
[47:53] behalf they had to believe it because
[47:55] they heard the trumpet then they had to
[47:57] act on what they heard
[47:58] and how they acted on it is they didn't
[48:00] have to be slaves anymore they could
[48:01] drop what they were doing they could
[48:03] return to their inheritance
[48:04] so they had to hear it then they had to
[48:06] act upon that trumpet hallelujah
[48:08] and it's the same thing now today as we
[48:11] have had a pure gospel trump oblong
[48:14] it is not a trumpet of creation dogmas
[48:16] of man it is not
[48:17] bible school theology amen but it was
[48:19] thus saith the lord being spoken in this
[48:21] day
[48:22] amen revealing jesus christ you and i i
[48:24] mean that's why we can listen
[48:26] look into the message we know not every
[48:27] word is thus saith the lord brother
[48:29] brown
[48:29] said it wasn't although saith the lord
[48:31] he says so much as a human but then so
[48:32] much but it's the god but
[48:34] right but within the message is the
[48:35] revelation of jesus christ the full
[48:37] revelation of jesus christ
[48:39] hallelujah so it's those who have been
[48:40] given an ear hear it
[48:42] hear it hear it really what it is they
[48:44] hear beyond a voice of a kentuckian
[48:46] hallelujah carry all those things and
[48:50] they hear god
[48:51] amen i love it where where it says about
[48:53] jesus jesus did not speak
[48:55] a high form of hebrew with fancy words
[48:57] says the common people heard him gladly
[49:00] he spoke very simple kind of hebrew or
[49:02] whatever language he was speaking in
[49:04] amen it's the same thing in this day god
[49:07] doesn't speak in high
[49:08] fandangled words he speaks in the common
[49:10] language of the people i'm glad i'm a
[49:12] common person
[49:13] i can hear the lord gladly hallelujah
[49:16] hallelujah
[49:18] amen so so on this day we've had this
[49:20] jubilee trumpet
[49:22] amen and it's been blowing and and we
[49:25] have been the beneficiaries of that
[49:26] trumpet
[49:27] amen amen and so here we are living in a
[49:30] season where you know we can't go back
[49:32] 2000 years
[49:33] and see jesus die right we can't go back
[49:37] you know
[49:38] i don't know how many nails they claim
[49:39] were driven in his hands and feet that
[49:41] around the world
[49:42] it wouldn't do any good if we had all
[49:43] the nails in the air you know all those
[49:45] things
[49:46] but uh but the life that was in that
[49:48] blood now
[49:49] that was in the lamb of god that life
[49:51] came out of the blood brother brown
[49:53] tells us that's the token the holy ghost
[49:55] and now that life comes into the
[49:57] believer when they hear that gospel
[49:59] trumpet that life comes in when you hear
[50:01] that word
[50:02] hallelujah that life comes in and then
[50:05] now our freedom begins to take place in
[50:07] the believer's life
[50:08] hallelujah just like someone who is a
[50:10] slave there and you know
[50:11] you're in israel it could have taken
[50:13] them a few days to return back to their
[50:15] possession
[50:16] but as soon as they heard that trumpet
[50:17] they drop what they're doing and they
[50:19] begin to walk
[50:20] begin to return home although it's the
[50:22] same thing with you and i i mean we are
[50:24] walking
[50:25] into a perfect image of god i mean sure
[50:27] it doesn't matter how we start off it
[50:29] doesn't matter how you start off it's
[50:30] how you finish
[50:31] that's the main thing and if you ever
[50:32] design your heart for god that's all god
[50:34] really looks at
[50:35] amen the desire what you want to be amen
[50:39] hallelujah so we have a high priest
[50:42] so as i said very few people saw the
[50:44] high priest in the old testament walk
[50:45] into the tabernacle
[50:47] now i say even fewer no one saw jesus
[50:50] go up and off the blood and glory amen
[50:54] you know when he revealed himself there
[50:56] you know mary and the woman went to the
[50:58] tomb the tombs open and
[51:00] you know mary's broken-hearted and
[51:02] wondering where he's gone
[51:03] and you know sees jesus but jesus
[51:05] doesn't make himself known to her and
[51:07] she thinks he's a gardener and says you
[51:09] know tell me where you've taken him and
[51:11] i'll carry him away
[51:12] and then he he just speaks her calls her
[51:14] by name mary
[51:16] and her eyes come open it's you lord
[51:18] you're alive
[51:19] but then he says to her don't touch me
[51:22] because i need to ascend
[51:24] i need to ascend to my god and to your
[51:26] god to my father and your father
[51:28] hallelujah i love that because it shows
[51:31] me where
[51:32] god reveals himself to his children
[51:34] hallelujah
[51:35] so he had to be he had to go up into
[51:37] glory and then he came back down so he
[51:40] went
[51:40] up he was accepted came back down then
[51:42] he said to thomas
[51:44] touch my hand put your hand in my side
[51:46] touch me
[51:48] hallelujah well how do i know that he
[51:50] took the blood he
[51:51] yo yo he took his own body as an
[51:53] offering up there on my behalf
[51:55] because the holy spirit's upon the earth
[51:57] the proof that he died for you and i as
[51:59] the upper room happened
[52:00] amen and the proof that he died for you
[52:02] and i as the upper room happened to you
[52:04] i mean see he's not a historical god
[52:06] it's wonderful look at the god of
[52:08] history but he's not just a god of
[52:09] history he's the god of the presence
[52:11] i mean that's why i rejoice when you
[52:13] think about what god did in the
[52:14] prophet's ministry
[52:15] it thrills my soul number one approved
[52:18] proves that jesus christ is alive
[52:20] but number two it makes me rejoice
[52:22] because that same god back there is the
[52:23] same god here
[52:25] hallelujah the same god that cast out
[52:27] devils raised the dead healed the sick
[52:29] spoke tumors out of existence spoke
[52:31] storms out of existence brought life
[52:33] brought salvation by the spoken word
[52:35] that same one
[52:36] amen it's right here hallelujah you know
[52:39] the prophet's ministry was not seen for
[52:41] us just to sit around and talk about his
[52:42] testimony
[52:43] even though that's all very good it
[52:45] builds faith right but god didn't send
[52:47] it just for us to talk about what god
[52:48] did in william brown's life
[52:50] no god displayed himself on this day
[52:52] saying children this is what my
[52:54] this is what my blood achieves this is
[52:55] what an open book achieves a son of god
[52:58] in his position have been having
[53:00] dominion over the all powers of hell
[53:02] amen and his own body hallelujah amen
[53:06] hallelujah i'm glad we're living in this
[53:07] time this is
[53:09] 20 21 hallelujah praise god i'm alive
[53:12] today
[53:14] amen hallelujah amen
[53:18] amen hebrews 4 and 14 saying
[53:22] then that we have a great high priest
[53:23] that passed into the heavens jesus the
[53:25] son of god
[53:26] let us hold fast our profession for we
[53:29] have not in high priest which cannot be
[53:31] touched with the feeling of our
[53:32] infirmities
[53:33] but it was in all points tempted like as
[53:36] we are yet without sin
[53:37] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[53:40] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[53:42] and find grace to help in time of need
[53:46] hallelujah what what do you mean coming
[53:49] boldly when someone comes in boldly they
[53:51] just push the door open
[53:53] remember he wants us to come that
[53:55] doesn't come arrogantly he actually
[53:57] wants us to come into his presence
[53:59] amen but we have the right to come in
[54:01] boldly because he made a way
[54:03] it's not you making your way he made the
[54:04] way hallelujah
[54:08] hebrews 9 and 12 neither by the blood of
[54:10] bulls and calves but by his own blood he
[54:12] entered in
[54:13] and once into the holy place having
[54:16] obtained eternal redemption for us
[54:19] hallelujah i mean for if the blood of
[54:22] bulls and of goats and the ashes of a
[54:24] heifer sprinkling down clean sanctifiers
[54:25] to the purifying of the flesh
[54:27] how much more shall the blood of christ
[54:29] who through the eternal spirit offered
[54:31] himself
[54:31] without spot to god purge your
[54:33] conscience from dead works to serve the
[54:35] living god
[54:36] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[54:38] the new testament
[54:39] that by the means of death for the
[54:41] redemption of the transgressions that
[54:42] were under the first testament
[54:44] they which are called might receive the
[54:46] promise of eternal
[54:48] inheritance you know what i love about
[54:50] this oh i'm not even
[54:53] it's all what he's done it's not what
[54:55] i've done it's what he's done
[54:57] hallelujah it's what he did it's what
[54:59] his his achievement
[55:00] is the thing to worship his achievements
[55:03] what we should be glorifying
[55:04] amen and he doesn't say your achievement
[55:08] it's actually his achievement it's his
[55:10] achievement in our lives that matters
[55:13] hallelujah amen
[55:18] amen this message is the gospel is the
[55:20] gospel trumpet in this hour because it's
[55:22] the truth of the scripture
[55:23] this message reveals jesus christ in the
[55:25] scripture to me
[55:28] amen this message is sounding around the
[55:32] world
[55:34] and we know and and we know that we feel
[55:38] the pull of his spirit in our lives
[55:40] i mean and that pull of his spirit in
[55:42] our lives is the life that was in the
[55:44] lab now moving and dwelling in our
[55:46] hearts
[55:47] hallelujah you know it says in isaiah 53
[55:50] and 1
[55:51] who hath believed our report to whom is
[55:53] the arm of the lord revealed well
[55:55] the answer very simply is those who
[55:57] believe the report the arm of the lord
[55:58] is revealed to
[55:59] amen so if you believe the report the
[56:01] almond lord's revealed to you
[56:03] hallelujah amen so if you truly believe
[56:06] the word of god then the strength in
[56:07] that word is revealed to you
[56:09] amen so for example you know you know
[56:12] you believe that the lord died for you
[56:14] on calvary
[56:16] the strength of that cross thou comes
[56:18] into your life redeems you
[56:20] changes you amen amen you believe the
[56:22] report that the book's come open
[56:24] amen hallelujah then you're on your way
[56:26] amen then you know this
[56:27] you know that every promise of god opens
[56:29] up to you amen you need healing but you
[56:31] believe he's a healer then the arm of
[56:32] the lord's revealed to you and you're
[56:33] healed
[56:34] hallelujah that's right i believe amen
[56:37] so the answer
[56:38] is those who believe the report for them
[56:41] is the arm of the lord revealed
[56:43] amen you can take that through the
[56:44] scripture joshua and caleb they believe
[56:46] the report
[56:48] amen and they and caleb got his mountain
[56:50] the arm of the lord was revealed to him
[56:52] hallelujah and he's sitting here
[56:56] and then he used to think of another
[56:57] great story this is this is blind
[56:59] bartimaeus his mother was sitting on the
[57:01] porch
[57:02] facing off to jordan she'd say
[57:03] bartimaeus just right down here less
[57:06] than half a mile
[57:07] just below the ford in the month of
[57:08] april where all the snows had melted in
[57:10] the river
[57:11] was way up here in the valley god led
[57:13] his people to the other side
[57:15] and then opened up the way and came
[57:16] across jordan on dry land
[57:18] and he would think of them stories he'd
[57:20] say but alas
[57:22] wonder what happened to that great god
[57:24] our priest tell
[57:25] us that the days of miracles is past
[57:27] those things can't happen no more
[57:29] that's what the trouble is today we have
[57:32] too much of that thing that god was
[57:34] but is it now the bible says he's the
[57:37] same yesterday today and forever
[57:39] just as much god today as he was then
[57:41] and he always will be god
[57:42] if he ever was god he will always be god
[57:45] he cannot die
[57:46] he cannot get old he cannot change his
[57:48] mind he cannot make
[57:49] new decisions on things he's already
[57:51] made decisions on
[57:52] hallelujah so if he made a decision i'm
[57:55] going to meet my children in 2021
[57:58] or whatever year that you met the lord
[58:00] he made a decision in whatever year
[58:02] i'm going to meet my son or my daughter
[58:04] i'm going to save them holy i'm going to
[58:05] redeem them he can't change his decision
[58:08] hallelujah amen
[58:11] amen he's already made decisions on his
[58:13] first decision was right
[58:15] and has to forever be right or he made
[58:17] the wrong decision when he made it
[58:19] see he has to ever keep with his first
[58:21] decision
[58:22] he's perfect infinite and cannot change
[58:25] oh what a consolation we must have
[58:27] anybody seeking god must have that firm
[58:30] consolation
[58:31] that god cannot change hallelujah so god
[58:35] cannot change
[58:36] you know i'm so thankfully cannot change
[58:39] amen as i said before god's program is
[58:41] part of him
[58:42] so because he is a god of deliverance
[58:45] and mercy
[58:46] then he must provide a place of safety
[58:48] for the believer to be hidden away in
[58:50] to escape the judgments that's going to
[58:52] strike right because he's a god of
[58:54] deliverance and he's a god of mercy
[58:56] amen so noah found grace in the sight of
[59:00] god the bible says
[59:01] amen and god told him that he was going
[59:04] to flood the earth so
[59:05] so god said to know the end of all flesh
[59:07] is has come before me for the earth is
[59:09] filled with violence
[59:11] through them and behold i'll destroy
[59:12] them with the earth make thee an
[59:14] ark of go for wood rooms thou shall make
[59:17] in the ark and thou shalt pitch it
[59:18] within and without with pitch
[59:20] and this is the fashion which thou shall
[59:22] make at the length of the ark shall be
[59:24] 300 cubits
[59:25] the breadth of it 50 cubits and the
[59:27] height of it 30 cubits a window shall
[59:29] they make to the ark
[59:30] and in a cubit shall thou finish it
[59:32] above and the door of the ark thou shall
[59:33] sit and the side thereof
[59:35] with the lower second and third story
[59:37] shall thou make it and behold
[59:38] i even i do bring a flood of waters upon
[59:40] the earth to destroy your flesh
[59:43] wherein is the breath of life from unto
[59:45] heaven and everything that is in the
[59:46] earth shall die
[59:47] but with thee i'll establish my covenant
[59:50] and thou
[59:51] shall come into the ark thou and thy
[59:53] sons and thy wife and thy son's wives
[59:56] with thee i mean what a consolation it
[59:58] must have been for noah this is not just
[1:00:00] for you this is for your family yeah
[1:00:01] i mean this way of escape that i've told
[1:00:03] you to build is not just for you
[1:00:05] it's for your children remember he so so
[1:00:07] he so he so he was given the dimensions
[1:00:09] of the ark
[1:00:10] and included in those dimensions were
[1:00:12] the fact that his family was coming in
[1:00:14] hallelujah i mean so what a consolation
[1:00:16] that must have been that the lord showed
[1:00:18] him
[1:00:18] that his wife and children and and his
[1:00:20] daughters-in-law
[1:00:21] were part of the promise as well amen
[1:00:23] just like it says in acts 2 and 38 39
[1:00:26] the apostle paul would say for the
[1:00:28] promises unto you amen
[1:00:30] amen if you repent be baptized everyone
[1:00:32] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:33] remission of sin you shall receive the
[1:00:35] gift of the holy ghost
[1:00:36] for the promise is unto you and to your
[1:00:38] children all that are afar
[1:00:40] off even as many as the lord our god
[1:00:41] shall call so so if you have repented
[1:00:44] you've turned from your sins amen you've
[1:00:46] yo yo start to walk with god baptized in
[1:00:48] his name
[1:00:49] receive the holy ghost then the promise
[1:00:51] is not just to you but it's to your
[1:00:53] children
[1:00:54] it's for you hey if it's for you it has
[1:00:55] to be for your children i mean it's for
[1:00:57] those who are far off a prodigal has
[1:00:59] gone far away from god
[1:01:00] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:01:02] call hallelujah i mean he doesn't back
[1:01:04] up on that
[1:01:05] he doesn't back up on that promise he
[1:01:07] gave the promise he knew the trouble of
[1:01:09] the age he knew the
[1:01:10] difficulty he knew the opposition he
[1:01:12] knew that there would be a multitude of
[1:01:13] devils released in this hour
[1:01:15] they had never been upon the earth he
[1:01:17] knew that they'd be here but he knew
[1:01:18] this promise would stand
[1:01:20] and he knew he'd stand behind the
[1:01:21] promise of the word hallelujah
[1:01:23] amen so i you know he doesn't change now
[1:01:26] noah
[1:01:27] had to then put his faith into action
[1:01:30] and his boys and their wives had to
[1:01:32] believe him as well because it was
[1:01:33] actually a faith
[1:01:34] walk to get into the ark just like it is
[1:01:37] today the ark of christ jesus
[1:01:39] amen so they had to and then so to me
[1:01:41] what he did is he just took the
[1:01:42] blueprint
[1:01:43] he put it before his children he took
[1:01:45] the blueprint here it is
[1:01:47] this is the way to safety this is what's
[1:01:49] going to carry us from this world to the
[1:01:51] next world
[1:01:52] hallelujah and their hearts would turn
[1:01:54] to faith by faith now being warned of
[1:01:56] god of things not
[1:01:58] seen as yet moved with fear prepared an
[1:02:00] ark to the saving of his house
[1:02:02] by the which he condemned the world and
[1:02:04] became heir of the righteousness which
[1:02:06] is by faith amen now we know the ark
[1:02:08] represented christ
[1:02:11] and to me it had two functions and it
[1:02:13] was built a certain way
[1:02:15] number one it was a place of safety for
[1:02:18] those
[1:02:19] um yeah yo for them that they wouldn't
[1:02:22] die with those who didn't believe
[1:02:24] this is a place of safety number two it
[1:02:27] transported them into another world
[1:02:29] that's what the ark did it took them to
[1:02:30] another world and number three well this
[1:02:33] is the the
[1:02:34] the design features the arc is
[1:02:37] actually designed for maximum stability
[1:02:40] naval architects say that the ratio of
[1:02:42] the length and the width and the height
[1:02:44] to the arc
[1:02:45] is a perfect dimensions for a stable
[1:02:47] boat
[1:02:49] so it's a place of safety it's it it'll
[1:02:52] transport them to another world and it's
[1:02:54] built for maximum stability
[1:02:57] i mean see it wasn't built to be the
[1:02:59] fastest monohull hydrofoiling boat
[1:03:02] it wasn't built for that kind of thing
[1:03:04] it was built to be stable
[1:03:06] and it said hallelujah so it's the same
[1:03:08] thing with our lord jesus christ amen
[1:03:10] amen he is a place of safety if you're
[1:03:13] sealed to the day of your redemption
[1:03:14] you're safe
[1:03:15] doesn't matter what the devil does to
[1:03:16] this body you can be as sick as a dog to
[1:03:18] the day
[1:03:19] the lord takes you home but if your soul
[1:03:21] is sealed into the kingdom
[1:03:22] it don't matter what god i mean doesn't
[1:03:24] matter what the devil does to this body
[1:03:26] your soul's going to its final
[1:03:27] destination which is glory hallelujah
[1:03:30] so it's a place of safety amen and it
[1:03:32] transports
[1:03:33] it transported them to another world you
[1:03:36] say what kind of world well
[1:03:37] you know we know that the atmosphere of
[1:03:40] the world they went into was different
[1:03:42] to the atmosphere they came out of
[1:03:43] remember it was the same earth
[1:03:45] and we know when all is said and done
[1:03:47] the new heavens and new earth and you
[1:03:48] that
[1:03:49] we're going to be on this earth it's
[1:03:50] going to be renovated holy fire's going
[1:03:52] to burn it off all the devils and
[1:03:54] everything of you know that's not if
[1:03:55] god's going to be burnt away but this
[1:03:58] earth is going to be the one we're going
[1:03:59] to live on heaven is going to be upon
[1:04:01] the earth
[1:04:02] hallelujah so now they were transported
[1:04:05] from from the andaluvian world and we
[1:04:07] know that when the
[1:04:08] when when god flooded it there was the
[1:04:10] fountains of the deep opened
[1:04:12] and the windows of heaven opened and and
[1:04:15] scientists say that you know the
[1:04:17] atmosphere of that world before the
[1:04:18] flood was very different to this one
[1:04:20] it was more of a uniform temperature all
[1:04:22] the way around that's why
[1:04:24] you know in the polar regions they have
[1:04:25] found tropical plants and different
[1:04:27] things that used to grow
[1:04:29] because because how the how the
[1:04:31] atmosphere was it was just a uniform
[1:04:32] heating of the
[1:04:33] heating of the earth but then into the
[1:04:35] new world they went and it was different
[1:04:37] kind of atmosphere it was the
[1:04:38] world that we live in today and then
[1:04:41] when when when
[1:04:42] our ark takes us from this world even
[1:04:44] just into the millennium
[1:04:46] there's going to be a different
[1:04:47] atmosphere there won't be no devil there
[1:04:50] hallelujah he'll be bound a thousand
[1:04:52] years we'll have no attempt to then
[1:04:54] amen then even after that he's going to
[1:04:56] be burnt up and we're just going to keep
[1:04:58] living on
[1:04:59] hallelujah so the atmosphere is going to
[1:05:01] be really be different amen
[1:05:02] amen it's going to be an atmosphere of
[1:05:04] perfect love it's going to be atmosphere
[1:05:06] of peace and joy there's never going to
[1:05:07] be a bad day bad thought bad
[1:05:09] no trouble is going to be there trouble
[1:05:11] can't enter that place
[1:05:12] i mean unbelief can't enter into that
[1:05:14] place i mean sickness can't enter
[1:05:16] into that place it's just perfect health
[1:05:18] perfect peace amen perfect love
[1:05:20] that's not the only thing amen and
[1:05:22] that's why brother ram said about going
[1:05:23] beyond the curtain of time he says
[1:05:25] whatever you do get perfect love
[1:05:27] well what is perfect love the holy ghost
[1:05:28] himself if you have him on the inside
[1:05:31] the inside of you you've got perfect
[1:05:32] love
[1:05:34] hallelujah amen so
[1:05:37] it transported them from one world to
[1:05:39] another just as our ark is going to
[1:05:41] transport us
[1:05:43] all they had to do is get in the ark
[1:05:45] they didn't have to paddle
[1:05:47] they didn't have to set any sails they
[1:05:49] just had to get in
[1:05:50] hey hallelujah this old chipper zion it
[1:05:53] knows where it's going
[1:05:55] hallelujah amen and it's designed for
[1:05:58] maximum stability that's what the lord
[1:06:00] wants us to be he wants us to be stable
[1:06:02] christians
[1:06:03] even in times of trouble and and you
[1:06:05] know he wants us to be stable in our
[1:06:06] walk with him
[1:06:07] not not teetering to and fro not
[1:06:09] double-minded but just just
[1:06:10] fix it fixed fixed on his word amen his
[1:06:14] word declared it i believe that that's
[1:06:15] settled that just praise the lord
[1:06:20] he says but the god of all grace who
[1:06:22] hath called us unto his eternal glory by
[1:06:25] christ jesus
[1:06:26] after ye have suffered a while make you
[1:06:28] perfect establish strengthen and settle
[1:06:31] you
[1:06:32] hallelujah what's god's plan for my life
[1:06:36] he wants to make me perfect establish me
[1:06:38] strengthen and settle me
[1:06:40] hallelujah amen i like that too amen
[1:06:45] so they were taken it was the same earth
[1:06:49] but it was different just as after the
[1:06:51] millennium you know
[1:06:54] after the you know you know there's the
[1:06:56] there's a nuclear war in different
[1:06:57] things then you
[1:06:58] you know then there's the millennium
[1:06:59] then we're going to the new heavens and
[1:07:00] new earth
[1:07:01] you know it's the same earth but the ark
[1:07:04] will take us there
[1:07:05] amen hallelujah i mean you know i love
[1:07:08] this really
[1:07:09] that's all the lord it's all him
[1:07:12] this this whole thing beginning to end
[1:07:13] is jesus christ
[1:07:15] it's not jesus christ and me it's him
[1:07:17] it's just him it's all the lord
[1:07:19] hallelujah it means that christ is our
[1:07:22] ark by one spirit we are baptized into
[1:07:24] that one body
[1:07:25] into that ark whether we be jews or
[1:07:27] gentiles whether it be bond or free
[1:07:29] we've all been made to drink into that
[1:07:30] one spirit
[1:07:32] amen so the ark made them secure from
[1:07:35] the judgments
[1:07:36] the ark didn't sink didn't matter what
[1:07:39] was buffeting didn't matter what was
[1:07:41] going on outside
[1:07:43] they were fine that was a good cruise
[1:07:44] ship to be on
[1:07:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:50] amen now brother graham says and feast
[1:07:52] of the trumpets 1964 you see
[1:07:55] uh you say the church has to go through
[1:07:57] the persecutions for the perfection of
[1:07:59] it
[1:08:00] the blood of jesus christ perfects the
[1:08:02] bride amen
[1:08:04] amen a man who chooses a wife don't put
[1:08:07] her through a lot of punishment
[1:08:09] he's already found grace too with her
[1:08:11] she has found grace with him
[1:08:13] he engages to her and if anything he'll
[1:08:15] keep her from
[1:08:16] every place to turn her hand his grace
[1:08:19] is so great upon them
[1:08:22] maybe we should stagger around a bit
[1:08:23] what's happening i've got grace great
[1:08:24] grace upon me
[1:08:26] hallelujah and so it will be upon the
[1:08:28] bride and so it is on the bride we
[1:08:31] are unworthy creatures deserving of hell
[1:08:33] but as grace
[1:08:34] holds us through it how are we going to
[1:08:36] get through
[1:08:37] ladies here his grace is going to hold
[1:08:39] us through it
[1:08:40] hallelujah look at how many lost and
[1:08:42] blind how many how many sinners were in
[1:08:44] the world the hour i got saved god saved
[1:08:46] me for a purpose
[1:08:47] and i'm determined by his will to do
[1:08:49] that purpose i don't care what anything
[1:08:51] else goes i want to do what he says
[1:08:54] hallelujah amen in the first exodus
[1:08:59] the blood was applied on the door in
[1:09:00] lintel
[1:09:02] i just love it how where where moses
[1:09:06] is told when i see the blood
[1:09:09] i'll pass over you didn't matter
[1:09:14] you know he didn't say when i see the
[1:09:16] israelites in the house i'll pass over
[1:09:18] them when i see the blood
[1:09:20] that's all he's looking for amen he's
[1:09:22] not looking at us remember red through
[1:09:24] where
[1:09:25] red is white amen so we may have sinned
[1:09:29] but he looks at through the blood of
[1:09:30] jesus christ and he doesn't see it
[1:09:33] hallelujah and not and you know
[1:09:36] so when i see the blood i'll pass over
[1:09:38] you you know what i love about confess
[1:09:40] sin it's not attributed to you and i
[1:09:43] yeah
[1:09:44] it's put on the head of the accuser
[1:09:46] because what happened in
[1:09:48] eden there was a judgment who did this
[1:09:49] there was adam and eve in the serpent
[1:09:51] and it all boiled down to the serpent
[1:09:54] which was the devil embodied in him to
[1:09:56] do what he did
[1:09:58] and so now all god is giving a foretaste
[1:10:00] to the devil this is how it's really
[1:10:02] going to end up
[1:10:03] great white throne judgment who calls
[1:10:05] this and they'll go down and down and
[1:10:06] down and down and down and down and down
[1:10:08] him and then he can't look this way
[1:10:10] there's no one else behind him
[1:10:12] you're going to help people try oh you
[1:10:14] know this guy no no there's no other guy
[1:10:15] there it's him
[1:10:17] and he has to give an account for all
[1:10:19] this he's done
[1:10:20] and he can't dodge nothing he can't slip
[1:10:23] out of it no way
[1:10:24] he'll pay for every one of them amen
[1:10:26] hallelujah
[1:10:28] hallelujah amen when i see the blood
[1:10:31] i'll pass over you
[1:10:33] i'm so thankful we can apply that short
[1:10:34] token today
[1:10:36] that token is the life of god the holy
[1:10:38] ghost is our token today
[1:10:40] amen and when he sees his own life in
[1:10:42] you i'll pass over
[1:10:43] the death angel can't strike that place
[1:10:45] hallelujah
[1:10:47] so not only did he give a blood barrier
[1:10:50] during a time of
[1:10:51] judgment and deliverance there to israel
[1:10:54] but there was light in their dwellings
[1:10:57] he says in exodus 10 22 23 and moses
[1:11:00] stretched father's hand towards heaven
[1:11:02] and there was a thick darkness in all
[1:11:04] the land of egypt three days
[1:11:06] they saw not one another never rose from
[1:11:08] his place for three days but all the
[1:11:10] children of israel had light
[1:11:11] in their dwellings gross darkness covers
[1:11:14] the people isaiah
[1:11:16] doesn't say that but i rise and shine
[1:11:18] for thy light has come
[1:11:19] so there was gross darkness upon the
[1:11:21] egyptians but in the
[1:11:23] in the hebrew houses they had light in
[1:11:26] their dwellings
[1:11:28] i mean we have light and our dwellings
[1:11:30] i'm not talking about natural light now
[1:11:32] i'm talking about supernatural light
[1:11:34] hallelujah and we can see the path we
[1:11:36] should take
[1:11:37] i mean sure the world's falling apart
[1:11:38] there's confusion everywhere you go on
[1:11:40] the news confusion
[1:11:41] and this is going on and this and you go
[1:11:43] here this and
[1:11:44] you know you try and look at the
[1:11:46] left-wing news the right-wing used to
[1:11:47] get it you know but it's all just you
[1:11:49] know
[1:11:50] but there's one sure place hallelujah
[1:11:54] there's one short place that's god's
[1:11:55] word
[1:11:57] hallelujah you know we're seeing or we
[1:11:59] have already seen but it's just becoming
[1:12:01] apparent where it says in revelation 13
[1:12:03] speaking of america you know coming out
[1:12:05] of the earth and speaking like a lamb
[1:12:07] i mean like a lamb but they spake as the
[1:12:09] dragon and we have seen it already turn
[1:12:12] even years ago it happened where they
[1:12:13] speak exactly like the dragon speaks
[1:12:15] but now we're seeing the manifestation
[1:12:17] of it i mean we shouldn't be surprised
[1:12:19] by the things we see upon the earth
[1:12:21] even you know we know we'd live in a
[1:12:23] time where there'd be earthquakes in
[1:12:24] diverse places we've had a lot of those
[1:12:26] around here
[1:12:27] i mean there'd be famine there'd be
[1:12:29] pestilence
[1:12:30] this is all part of the beginning of
[1:12:32] sorrows i remember we have a place of
[1:12:34] safety
[1:12:35] it doesn't matter if people it doesn't
[1:12:36] matter if you get sick and die if you're
[1:12:38] sealed away you're going to go to be
[1:12:39] with the lord
[1:12:40] right so we shouldn't fear nothing that
[1:12:41] comes upon the earth
[1:12:43] whether it be famine earthquakes
[1:12:45] pestilence whatever it is
[1:12:47] amen our lives are in the rock of ages
[1:12:51] hallelujah so they had light in their
[1:12:53] dwellings we have light in our dwellings
[1:12:55] yes
[1:12:56] amen amen even
[1:13:00] even paul would say in in in colossians
[1:13:02] remember god
[1:13:03] is a god of deliverance and to deliver
[1:13:06] something you snatch it from destruction
[1:13:08] and you carry it away
[1:13:10] hallelujah and our souls are on the road
[1:13:13] to destruction
[1:13:14] didn't matter how good we are didn't
[1:13:16] matter if we raised in church or not
[1:13:17] amen but our souls are on the way to
[1:13:19] hell
[1:13:20] but then the lord delivered every one of
[1:13:22] us hallelujah
[1:13:24] i'm glad he found me don't you amy
[1:13:26] colossians 1
[1:13:27] 12 and 14 12 to 14 giving thanks unto
[1:13:30] the father
[1:13:31] which has made us uh meet to be
[1:13:34] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:13:35] saints in light
[1:13:37] you know all i see these days he's made
[1:13:40] us something
[1:13:42] he's made us worthy
[1:13:46] which has made make it personal
[1:13:50] which has made me meet to be partakers
[1:13:52] the heroes of the saints of light
[1:13:54] he did it who did this you know
[1:13:57] sometimes you can see a big
[1:13:58] you know i walk into some
[1:14:01] three little people's bedroom it's like
[1:14:03] hurricane goes through
[1:14:05] and you say who caused this you know and
[1:14:08] and i'm not the cleanest guy in the
[1:14:09] world either you know
[1:14:10] don't get me wrong but you know but
[1:14:12] normally something goes wrong it's like
[1:14:13] who did this
[1:14:14] what about when something goes right who
[1:14:16] caused this hallelujah it's like you
[1:14:18] know our lives our lives were chaos
[1:14:21] and then they came under came into order
[1:14:23] into order with the word of god and you
[1:14:25] could ask
[1:14:26] who caused this who caused these people
[1:14:28] who causes transforming power who change
[1:14:30] these people and god just says as is my
[1:14:33] doing save the lord
[1:14:34] hallelujah amen because he's made me
[1:14:38] meat
[1:14:39] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[1:14:41] the saints in light
[1:14:44] who allowed you in he did and if he
[1:14:46] allowed me and you can't boot me out
[1:14:48] and the devil can't kick me out either
[1:14:50] he'll try sure but also uh
[1:14:52] excuse me you're not allowed this is vip
[1:14:56] you're not on the list get it security
[1:14:58] get this guy out of here
[1:14:59] yeah hallelujah now
[1:15:02] we know god is not a god of lies
[1:15:06] it's impossible for him to lie it is
[1:15:09] just not in his being to lie he cannot
[1:15:11] lie
[1:15:12] it says in hebrews 6 it says wherein god
[1:15:16] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[1:15:18] ears of promise
[1:15:19] the immune ability of his council
[1:15:21] confirmed it by an oath
[1:15:23] that by two immutable things in which it
[1:15:26] was impossible for god to lie
[1:15:28] we might have a strong consolation
[1:15:31] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[1:15:33] upon the hope set before us
[1:15:35] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:15:37] soul both sure
[1:15:38] and steadfast and which entered into
[1:15:40] that within the veil
[1:15:42] so he it is impossible for god to lie
[1:15:45] he cannot lie impossible
[1:15:49] and we know a white lie is the same as a
[1:15:51] lie
[1:15:52] just a little remember the serpent told
[1:15:54] 99
[1:15:56] truth to eve but that one percent error
[1:15:59] made it a lie
[1:16:00] yeah hallelujah isn't that right you
[1:16:03] know the devil when he came to quote the
[1:16:05] scripture
[1:16:06] to jesus didn't give the whole scripture
[1:16:10] where where he is told cast yourself
[1:16:13] you're on the pinnacle of the temple
[1:16:15] and then and then you know the devil
[1:16:16] told the lord
[1:16:18] throw yourself off because the angels
[1:16:20] have charge over thee
[1:16:22] but the rest of that scripture if you
[1:16:24] read it he doesn't quote the whole thing
[1:16:26] so it became a lie look because it
[1:16:29] wasn't the whole truth
[1:16:30] it was just a part of it was omitted so
[1:16:32] it became a lie that's why we need the
[1:16:34] whole scripture
[1:16:35] we know we need the whole council of god
[1:16:37] and what do we have in this day in this
[1:16:38] matches
[1:16:39] the whole council of god that's right
[1:16:41] hallelujah
[1:16:42] so god cannot lie so now if god spoke
[1:16:45] something
[1:16:47] the intent it was spoken and has to come
[1:16:49] to pass
[1:16:50] he doesn't dilute his promises down he
[1:16:53] doesn't change his promises
[1:16:55] he doesn't draw back from his promises
[1:16:57] what he said would happen
[1:16:59] will happen amen he cannot change his
[1:17:02] word because of culture
[1:17:04] technology political climate situations
[1:17:08] change he can't and he won't
[1:17:10] he can't change it amen there has never
[1:17:13] been a scripture
[1:17:15] where god has had to take his word back
[1:17:17] because it couldn't be fulfilled
[1:17:20] you just think about all the history of
[1:17:21] the world six thousand or however many
[1:17:24] years where god has been giving promises
[1:17:26] to his children
[1:17:27] there's not a single time where he said
[1:17:30] i'm sorry
[1:17:30] i i i didn't mean it that way so i was
[1:17:33] just a bit over dogmatic telling you in
[1:17:35] that fashion no no
[1:17:36] what he says he backs up and he does
[1:17:39] amen he said there's never been a time
[1:17:41] in the history of the world and there
[1:17:43] never will be
[1:17:44] where god has to take his word back
[1:17:46] because it couldn't be fulfilled because
[1:17:47] of conditions
[1:17:48] amen he did not have to apologize to
[1:17:51] abraham
[1:17:52] and tell him sorry you actually can't
[1:17:54] have isaac right
[1:17:55] he didn't have to do that amen he did
[1:17:58] not have to tell moses
[1:18:01] during all the opposition that he had
[1:18:03] from pharaoh
[1:18:04] and even when he got to the red scene it
[1:18:06] looked like it was going to be just a
[1:18:07] slaughter
[1:18:08] he didn't have to go to moses and say uh
[1:18:11] sorry moses
[1:18:12] i lead you wrong you know i'm just going
[1:18:14] to go to pharaoh and say
[1:18:15] sorry you know no no he didn't back up
[1:18:18] he did not back up one but remember he
[1:18:20] made every molecule in the ocean
[1:18:22] he made every part of this world he can
[1:18:23] just speak and
[1:18:25] it could defy every law hallelujah
[1:18:28] god cannot make a mistake amen amen
[1:18:33] his ways are perfect hallelujah
[1:18:36] and if his ways are perfect and he can't
[1:18:38] make a mistake
[1:18:39] then he'd never made a mistake saving
[1:18:41] you
[1:18:42] and it should be real personal shouldn't
[1:18:44] it you know i'm not just talking about
[1:18:45] all the world itself no we're talking
[1:18:46] about you and i
[1:18:47] yeah so he never made a mistake saving
[1:18:50] you
[1:18:51] hallelujah he's got a purpose
[1:18:54] and god it's amazing you know some
[1:18:56] people have like a niche kind of job
[1:18:58] you know a certain situation arises
[1:19:01] that's when they really step to the fore
[1:19:04] god specializes in the impossible he can
[1:19:07] do everything else but this is where his
[1:19:09] niece just seems to
[1:19:10] come to the forefront where humanly we
[1:19:12] think it's impossible
[1:19:13] there's no way this can happen you look
[1:19:15] at them at the red sea
[1:19:17] there's really a red sea and it wasn't
[1:19:19] the reed sea like some people try and
[1:19:21] say just a sea of reeds no it was the
[1:19:23] red sea and it was a sea
[1:19:27] right it wasn't just a little inlet
[1:19:28] there was the sea and they were stuck
[1:19:30] there god told them to walk there
[1:19:32] amen but you know but it's when but god
[1:19:34] wanted to display
[1:19:36] his power to them in their lives that
[1:19:38] they would see when they are facing the
[1:19:40] impossible that's when god comes on the
[1:19:42] scene
[1:19:42] and he manifests his promise hallelujah
[1:19:48] amen see it's when the believer
[1:19:52] looks like they're all against the wall
[1:19:54] all hope is gone
[1:19:56] any window of escape seems to be closed
[1:19:59] that's when he comes on the scene
[1:20:01] hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah
[1:20:07] amen now this is probably taking a
[1:20:09] segway but uh here we go
[1:20:12] now brother brahma says in looking at
[1:20:13] the unseen
[1:20:15] he says we put so much emphasis and so
[1:20:18] much concern about natural things
[1:20:19] and so little about the spiritual thing
[1:20:22] and i said for instance coming through
[1:20:23] this room right now is television
[1:20:25] pictures
[1:20:26] there's wi-fi going through this room
[1:20:28] all kinds of stuff
[1:20:29] and i said you have to show me the
[1:20:31] picture oh he said of course it hits the
[1:20:33] crystal
[1:20:34] and then and then tubes and so forth and
[1:20:36] it shows the picture so this man is he's
[1:20:38] talking
[1:20:38] you know debating with this man about
[1:20:40] different things and this man
[1:20:42] says well this is how television lights
[1:20:44] up
[1:20:46] but i said there's man in the united
[1:20:49] states and i said
[1:20:50] you're picking him up over here coming
[1:20:51] through the air that you can't see
[1:20:54] he said but we can prove it because
[1:20:56] here's the picture showing it's over
[1:20:58] there
[1:20:58] and there's a sending station to prove
[1:21:00] that it's here
[1:21:01] right amen so he's saying no the proof
[1:21:04] that that's really happening over there
[1:21:06] is because
[1:21:07] because the signal is being transmitted
[1:21:09] here and you can see it on this device
[1:21:11] amen and then so brother braham says yes
[1:21:14] and we can prove it too
[1:21:15] for in glory we have a risen savior who
[1:21:18] sends it forth
[1:21:19] and the holy spirit reveals it and makes
[1:21:22] it positive
[1:21:23] that's why i said in the beginning we
[1:21:24] have spiritual ears to hear so
[1:21:26] god is in glory he sends his word he
[1:21:29] maybe use a preacher's voice or or
[1:21:32] or the voice of the prophet or the
[1:21:33] written word but he sends it forth it's
[1:21:36] anointed to your heart
[1:21:37] and then he proves that it makes it
[1:21:39] positive
[1:21:41] amen therefore we've got a sending
[1:21:42] station and a receiving station that's
[1:21:45] correct
[1:21:46] god in heaven who knows all things can
[1:21:48] so put a gift in his church that he can
[1:21:50] magnify it and reflect himself through
[1:21:52] it
[1:21:53] now don't just put that on the prophet
[1:21:56] we'll have a gift of faith
[1:21:58] for god to reflect himself through and
[1:22:01] say
[1:22:01] things which is absolutely impossible by
[1:22:03] scientists to prove see
[1:22:05] we don't walk by things uh we don't walk
[1:22:07] by things
[1:22:09] uh we do see we walk by things we do not
[1:22:12] see
[1:22:13] now moses wrote the first five books the
[1:22:16] old testament
[1:22:19] okay i'm sure that wasn't controversial
[1:22:25] that was the first time that we have
[1:22:27] that that the word was written down
[1:22:29] before that it was just oral
[1:22:33] given that that we're aware of now this
[1:22:36] is the first time man is told to keep
[1:22:38] the word
[1:22:39] and to meditate upon it and joshua
[1:22:42] in the first chapter god tells joshua
[1:22:45] says only be thou strong and very
[1:22:46] courageous
[1:22:47] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:22:50] to all the law
[1:22:51] which moses my servant commanded he
[1:22:53] turned not from it to the right hand or
[1:22:54] to the left
[1:22:55] that thou mayest prosper wherever though
[1:22:58] goes
[1:22:58] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:23:00] out of thy mouth but thou
[1:23:02] shalt meditate there in day and night
[1:23:03] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:23:05] to all that's written therein
[1:23:07] for them thou shalt make thy way
[1:23:09] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[1:23:11] success
[1:23:12] now joshua would come to the end of his
[1:23:15] life and he would tell them in joshua 23
[1:23:18] and verse 6
[1:23:19] be therefore very courageous to keep and
[1:23:22] to do all that's written in the book of
[1:23:23] the law of moses that you turn not aside
[1:23:26] there from to the right hand or to the
[1:23:29] left
[1:23:29] that sounds like what god told them but
[1:23:32] he's passing this down
[1:23:33] because they had to really catch god is
[1:23:35] his word
[1:23:37] amen god has his word and if we follow
[1:23:41] if we're following the word we're
[1:23:42] following god but if we deviate out of
[1:23:44] the word then we're not following god
[1:23:45] anymore
[1:23:47] amen so now you may ask the question
[1:23:51] what has that got to do with god
[1:23:54] being unchangeable well it's simple
[1:23:57] when he gave the promise because he is
[1:24:00] that promise he can't
[1:24:02] change the promise so that promise if it
[1:24:04] stood true
[1:24:05] for the believers thousands of years ago
[1:24:08] that promise is still true today
[1:24:10] amen so we can look into the scripture
[1:24:13] now if
[1:24:14] if he saved anyone on the basis of faith
[1:24:18] then he'll save another person by faith
[1:24:20] right if he saved one person by faith
[1:24:23] you have to save
[1:24:23] if he saved the philippian jailer by
[1:24:25] faith he said believe in the lord jesus
[1:24:27] christ thy thy house shall be saved
[1:24:29] and his house came in because he
[1:24:30] believed on the lord jesus christ you
[1:24:32] know many times you know i don't have
[1:24:34] the quote on me but brother brahm says
[1:24:35] many times we
[1:24:36] tell people what not to do when we
[1:24:38] should tell people what to do
[1:24:40] yeah and that and and he says that what
[1:24:43] to do is believe on the lord jesus
[1:24:45] i mean because faith works out has has
[1:24:48] an outworking
[1:24:49] brother ram says um i don't have it here
[1:24:51] but there's another quote on him but he
[1:24:53] says now
[1:24:54] you take that sword of faith and you
[1:24:57] chop your way through the darkness
[1:24:59] sometimes you may just be able to chop
[1:25:01] your way through that then you get
[1:25:02] salvation
[1:25:03] but then you can chop again and you can
[1:25:05] get sanctification
[1:25:06] he can chop again and receive the
[1:25:08] baptism of the holy ghost and chop again
[1:25:10] if you're sick you get healed you just
[1:25:12] keep chopping
[1:25:13] with that faith you say i don't have
[1:25:15] strength to wield the sword
[1:25:17] well i love it how you know there was
[1:25:19] that man in the bible he had a son with
[1:25:21] the
[1:25:21] spirit of epilepsy on him and the
[1:25:23] disciples couldn't cast him out and
[1:25:25] you know and then and then jesus asked
[1:25:27] the man do you believe
[1:25:29] he says lord i believe help my unbelief
[1:25:32] and the lord didn't rebuke him that he
[1:25:35] confessed he had unbelief
[1:25:37] because if you ever go to lord say lord
[1:25:39] help me
[1:25:41] it's his character to help yes it's his
[1:25:44] character to enable especially when
[1:25:45] it's according to his word absolutely
[1:25:48] say lord i see a promise in your
[1:25:49] scripture i want to see it manifested in
[1:25:51] my life
[1:25:52] lord help lord i believe help my
[1:25:54] unbelief and he will take you to that
[1:25:56] faith
[1:25:58] hallelujah that that promise will be
[1:26:00] manifested
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:02] so it's all good that's just win-win-win
[1:26:06] this is a win-win situation and a
[1:26:07] win-win-win situation
[1:26:09] amen you may think i'm too positive i
[1:26:12] don't think we can be positive enough
[1:26:15] look what the lord has done for us how
[1:26:16] can we you know how can we be negative
[1:26:18] about any of this
[1:26:19] hallelujah amen but we now
[1:26:23] what i love about the lord not changing
[1:26:25] is if he was a god of history he's still
[1:26:27] the same god today
[1:26:29] and if he's the same god today he'll do
[1:26:31] the same things today
[1:26:32] i mean so if he healed or delivered in
[1:26:34] the past he'll do the same thing today
[1:26:36] hallelujah we have absolute confidence
[1:26:38] that he is still the same today
[1:26:41] amen brother brown would speak about
[1:26:43] jarius he says when does god dwell in a
[1:26:45] body called jesus the son of god
[1:26:48] when he was called on the scene called
[1:26:50] out of history the god who could raise
[1:26:53] the dead in the old testament
[1:26:54] bring back the life of a dead boy
[1:26:56] through a prophet that god cannot die
[1:26:59] he is god for eternity that baby laying
[1:27:02] on the bed stretched out this is dries
[1:27:04] his daughter and little jarius knowing
[1:27:06] that the schunemite got her baby back he
[1:27:09] began to see
[1:27:11] i've seen this before i've read about
[1:27:13] this before
[1:27:14] he found himself in the scripture amen
[1:27:17] he found himself this is just like the
[1:27:19] shunammite
[1:27:21] and god raised that little yo yeah god
[1:27:24] raised the shunamites
[1:27:25] boy back to life my daughter is in the
[1:27:27] same category
[1:27:28] she can be raised back to life as well
[1:27:30] amen and searching through he had heard
[1:27:32] of some man the man that claimed to have
[1:27:34] the power
[1:27:35] that was jesus of nazareth who they all
[1:27:38] hated but he called them on the scene
[1:27:41] for he was the closest representative he
[1:27:43] could find of god at that day a god of
[1:27:45] the living god
[1:27:46] and when he was called on the scene and
[1:27:49] the historical god was called up he
[1:27:51] acted the same way he did when he spoke
[1:27:53] to elijah
[1:27:54] on that dead baby hallelujah and so
[1:27:57] jarius went searching for a god of
[1:27:59] history he knew he was somewhere now
[1:28:01] remember
[1:28:02] he is the high priest could be touched
[1:28:03] by the feeling of our infirmity
[1:28:05] hallelujah he's that same one that same
[1:28:07] one with a woman with the blood and she
[1:28:09] just touched the hem of his garment and
[1:28:11] she was healed
[1:28:12] well by faith we can touch the hymn of
[1:28:13] his garment how many times brother brown
[1:28:16] would have meetings and he would call
[1:28:17] someone out in the audience and say
[1:28:19] who did they touch i'm 20 30 feet away
[1:28:21] from there they said they touched the
[1:28:22] high priest
[1:28:23] but the high priest was revealing
[1:28:25] himself through the prophet and because
[1:28:26] the son of man was being revealed
[1:28:28] i mean and that same son of man is being
[1:28:29] revealed through the bride ministry
[1:28:32] that's you and i by the way hallelujah
[1:28:34] so that same high priest can be still
[1:28:36] touched
[1:28:37] that same high priest can still speak
[1:28:39] that same high priest can still deliver
[1:28:41] can still heal can still fill with his
[1:28:43] presence
[1:28:44] amen because he's the same god hardly
[1:28:47] i'm so thankful we do not serve a god of
[1:28:49] history
[1:28:50] hallelujah i'm sure we can all have
[1:28:51] fellowship on this one he's alive
[1:28:54] amen he's living i mean he's president
[1:28:56] 2021 to guide us through the darkness
[1:28:59] i mean we don't have to worry a single
[1:29:01] day of our lives because he's got it all
[1:29:03] in control
[1:29:04] amen he had it in control when he
[1:29:06] commissioned moses to go down into egypt
[1:29:08] he had it in control where moses was
[1:29:10] talking to pharaoh he had it in control
[1:29:11] in the first place the second plague the
[1:29:13] third flag
[1:29:13] all the plagues he had in control when
[1:29:15] they left egypt he had to control when
[1:29:17] they crossed the red sea
[1:29:18] handed in control when they came to the
[1:29:19] bitter waters he only control when they
[1:29:21] came to mount sinai he under control
[1:29:23] when they went through moab he added
[1:29:24] control when they crossed the jordan he

[1:29:28] control when they took ai
[1:29:30] he had to control when they took the
[1:29:31] whole land he had it in control

[1:29:36] days of gideon hallelujah out of control

[1:29:40] controlled during
[1:29:41] saul's souls kingship davis kingship
[1:29:43] sullivan's kinship he added in control
[1:29:45] all the way down
[1:29:46] he added control when john the baptist
[1:29:48] was here when he was in flesh he really
[1:29:50] had it in control
[1:29:51] he had the church under his control of
[1:29:52] the day of pentecost and he still has a
[1:29:55] bride under control
[1:29:56] i mean and he's in control of every
[1:29:58] situation i mean we don't need to worry
[1:30:01] he has it all in control i mean sarah
[1:30:03] had to come to a place because of a
[1:30:05] visitation
[1:30:06] she judged him faithful that he was able
[1:30:08] to do the promise
[1:30:11] hallelujah and we are that same woman
[1:30:13] hallelujah
[1:30:14] hallelujah maybe you've been waiting for
[1:30:17] a promise amen but the visitation's on
[1:30:20] hallelujah remember she was in the
[1:30:22] brother abraham said i was listening
[1:30:23] today he said you know

[1:30:29] were living on the plains of memory it
[1:30:31] wasn't the well-watered plains of sodom
[1:30:33] and so the cattle didn't have enough
[1:30:35] food and you know the wells were going
[1:30:36] dry and

[1:30:41] you know um sarah saw lots wife and her
[1:30:45] fancy dresses that they had inside him
[1:30:47] all these different things but
[1:30:48] abraham was under expectation hallelujah

[1:30:54] visitation was on its way
[1:30:56] that the king of glory was going to come
[1:30:57] meet him hallelujah and so he just kept
[1:31:00] himself in a spiritual atmosphere i know
[1:31:02] i said it on sunday but you know
[1:31:04] the more the trouble comes it's the
[1:31:06] devil trying to rob you of the
[1:31:07] visitation of the angel

[1:31:23] god
[1:31:24] why because god is the devil trying to
[1:31:26] block a visitation
[1:31:28] i remember we just keep walking with god
[1:31:30] remember the god who gave the promise is
[1:31:32] the same god that manifests the promise
