[22:26] the gates of the palace which are
[22:28] pertain to the house and for the wall of
[22:30] the city and for the house that I shall
[22:32] enter into and the King granted me
[22:34] according to the good hand of my god
[22:36] upon me then I came to the governor's
[22:38] beyond the river and gate in the King's
[22:40] letters now the king had seen captains
[22:42] of the army and horsemen with me
[22:44] when sanballat the horror night and
[22:47] Tobiah the servant
[22:49] and Emma not heard of it it grieved them
[22:52] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[22:56] seek the welfare of the children of
[22:59] Israel a means this is bow heads in a
[23:03] wood of friends
[23:05] gracious Lord Jesus Lord we truly do
[23:07] give you all the glory and all the honor
[23:09] this morning Lord want to thank you Lord
[23:12] for your mercy upon us lord thank you
[23:14] that your mercies as your scripture says
[23:16] are new every morning we sort of pray

[23:48] your way in our lives Father in Jesus
[23:50] Christ then we pray amen amen god bless
[23:54] you all you may have your seats this
[23:55] morning I want to UM you know if I can
[24:00] take a time of the miss may seem very
[24:02] unrelated to the scripture we just read
[24:04] I want to speak about God is searching
[24:06] out honest hearts today now we read
[24:09] through the admire where Nehemiah was
[24:10] given you know he had a burden for his
[24:12] people and he and he and he got given
[24:15] letters from the king as we just read to
[24:17] to go to Jerusalem and and he was given
[24:19] authorization to to all of the you know
[24:23] wood and stone and anything he had need
[24:25] of it would be placed in his hand and
[24:26] and here here he comes in an hour of
[24:30] restoration where we're you know
[24:32] Jerusalem as has fallen down and it's a
[24:35] city without walls and you know but but
[24:38] you see the enemy now whenever God
[24:40] begins to do something it makes the
[24:42] enemy mad and I'm actually happy when
[24:45] the devil's mad because if the devil's
[24:46] mad it means that we are doing something
[24:48] against his kingdom I mean so don't be
[24:50] too worried if you know if the devil's
[24:53] raging you know the reason the devil's
[24:55] raging is because you have something
[24:56] that you know you have something that he
[24:59] wants but you're not well
[25:00] to give it to because you're not you're
[25:02] on your you're bought with the price
[25:03] which is the blood of Jesus Christ now
[25:05] now what I'll just show you a picture of
[25:07] so I've just kind of gone to this habit
[25:09] of showing pictures but here is a here's
[25:11] a you know who can see this picture of
[25:13] all these ruins here can even see that I
[25:15] mean so this is not Jerusalem exactly
[25:18] I'm not sure where these ruins came from
[25:20] but you know this is kind of kind of
[25:22] like you know you know if we could go
[25:24] back to nehemiah's day and we you know
[25:26] he would come down into Jerusalem and he
[25:28] began to survey the city and see the
[25:30] state it was then when he found it you
[25:32] know this is how I kind of maybe would
[25:33] have been you know all the stones are
[25:34] pulled down you know it just looks like
[25:36] a bunch of rubble a bunch of mess a
[25:38] bunch of rubbish I mean but but he had
[25:40] in his mind I mean a city to be rebuilt
[25:43] and you know we see that he had here he
[25:45] came a man now that was seeking after
[25:47] the welfare I mean of of the city
[25:51] Jerusalem I mean if we know that this is
[25:54] just as type where I could say just a
[25:56] shadow of our Lord Jesus you know
[25:58] because he is the he is the wise
[26:00] masterbuilder you know he is the builder
[26:02] of his church you know we know that the
[26:04] scripture tells us that we are lively
[26:06] stones living stones built into the
[26:08] house of God I mean who knows that I
[26:09] mean who knows you're a bit of the
[26:11] building I mean by once were you
[26:13] baptized into the body of Christ
[26:15] ami and so you know so I saw here it is
[26:17] now that you know Jerusalem is torn down
[26:19] it's it's it's in rubble but he comes a
[26:22] man who is seeking after the wealthier
[26:24] of the city and and as soon as this
[26:26] happened you know the enemy begin to be
[26:28] mad but I just want to emphasize the
[26:29] fact that he comes a man to seek after
[26:32] the city's welfare and I'll just say
[26:33] that you know you know God God has come
[26:36] down in this in time not to look at a
[26:38] physical building I mean of stone or
[26:41] gold or wood but he's looking you know
[26:43] he's looking for a people who are made
[26:44] and shaped and his image in the image of
[26:46] his word I mean and he's come to seek
[26:48] after your welfare now I just want to
[26:53] just point out though you know when we
[26:55] you know when the Lord came I mean and
[26:57] you know the days of his flesh he began
[26:59] to call different ones and you know he
[27:01] was actually calling stones he is
[27:03] calling butts award he is cool he was he
[27:05] was cool and material I mean for his
[27:07] temple that he was going to come dwell
[27:08] and you know we you know after he came
[27:10] out of the wilderness there
[27:12] to his 40 day temptation he went any and
[27:15] he went and got the disciples he began
[27:16] to call stones I mean he begin to call
[27:19] bits of the building of the mystical
[27:21] body of Christ he began to call Peter
[27:23] James and John II seem to come following
[27:25] me he found Matthew I mean he found he
[27:27] you know he found different ones and he
[27:29] was coming to seek he came to seek after
[27:32] the welfare of his house I mean seek the
[27:34] welfare of his people you know keep this
[27:38] in mind I mean that you know just like
[27:40] when Nehemiah found Jerusalem it was in
[27:43] this condition it was torn down it
[27:45] wasn't built it wasn't look you know you
[27:47] know it was you know it was in rubble I
[27:49] mean you're the enemy came in had burned
[27:51] it had destroyed it I mean in your head
[27:53] you know it had 70 years of you know
[27:56] barely being inhabited you know
[27:58] different you know your your animals
[28:00] would have lived in the ruins and things
[28:02] begin to grow and there was no order of
[28:04] a city anymore was just a bunch of
[28:05] rubble I mean and this is how the Lord
[28:07] found us hallelujah doesn't matter where
[28:10] we came from you know you take you take
[28:11] Matthew the tax collector you know he
[28:13] had a you know he had a good government
[28:15] job and even though everyone hated him
[28:17] but you know maybe actually he'd say he
[28:19] had everything but his life was in
[28:21] trouble I mean his life was a bunch of
[28:23] rubbish or he wasn't in his possession I
[28:25] mean you take Zacharias you know he was
[28:28] up the tree and you know you know I mean
[28:30] you know as xes rather you know he was
[28:32] he was there and you know here - all
[28:34] this money and wealth and things but but
[28:36] he was you know he was torn down I mean
[28:39] he was a stone that was just laying in
[28:41] the rubble but you know but then the
[28:42] Lord our you know you're the great
[28:44] builder of his church I mean he begin to
[28:46] call stirrings and it's amazing where
[28:48] God God finds us and you know it's not
[28:51] thing the thing is we have to look at
[28:53] it's not where we came from it's where
[28:55] we're going to and the reason we're
[28:57] going to his mind we would end up you
[29:03] know it's just so I love the story of
[29:05] you know the thief on the cross and I
[29:08] may deviate around a little bit but
[29:10] we'll get somewhere we'll start
[29:11] somewhere we'd somewhere else but you
[29:13] know I love the story of the thief on
[29:15] the cross because you know God God finds
[29:18] us in all different places and not
[29:20] surprised at the place he finds us they
[29:21] meant he knows exactly where
[29:24] we'll be and and he'll know exactly our
[29:26] condition that we'll be in I mean when
[29:28] he finds us and we have to just kind of
[29:31] you know I want to kind of build from
[29:32] from Wednesday if I can I mean because
[29:35] you know we've come out of I trust some
[29:37] spiritual of Christians your senior
[29:40] Christian services you know we've we've
[29:42] gone into our ethic and we've you know
[29:44] and we've and we've got the treasures
[29:45] out and we have you know your we've gone
[29:48] down home level four lockdown and we're
[29:50] not locked down no more and now we're
[29:52] rejoicing amen I trust as I look out the
[29:55] screen I trust you can say I did you
[29:57] know that today I may not come back to
[30:00] my first love but they know the devil
[30:02] you know it's just like when Nehemiah
[30:03] came to look at Jerusalem it might need
[30:05] to be mad because the devil doesn't want
[30:08] us built up you know he doesn't want us
[30:09] rejoicing he doesn't want us walking in
[30:11] victory but he wants our lives to be a
[30:13] bunch of wreckage amen but I'm glad the
[30:16] one that's building us is five grand the
[30:18] one that's trying to tear us down I mean
[30:20] I'm I'm glad that thee and the one
[30:22] that's trying to build us I mean his
[30:24] purposes I will have a bride she will
[30:26] live be without spot or wrinkle I mean
[30:28] she will be as righteous as I am
[30:30] righteous amen and we need to recognize
[30:32] that he's already made us thus we're
[30:34] just stepping into that Emma tell him I
[30:36] made her as he's called he's also
[30:38] justified him he's justified he is
[30:40] already glorified tells us so you know
[30:43] we're just walking I mean yo into
[30:46] victory hallelujah
[30:47] I think the warranty has the victory
[30:49] amen he won the victory for us
[30:51] hallelujah you know um amen so you know
[30:56] I love thee you know I love the story of
[30:59] the thief on the cross because you know
[31:01] in one account and you know you read the
[31:05] accounts of Jesus's crucifixion and one
[31:09] of them in Matthew 27 and and I think
[31:12] it's a mark as well that says that both
[31:14] thieves railed on him says he's a
[31:17] Matthew 27 41 likewise also the chief
[31:20] priests mocking him with the scribes and
[31:22] elders said he saved others himself he
[31:24] cannot say excuse me he being the king
[31:28] of Israel let him come down from the
[31:31] cross and we will believe him he trusted
[31:33] in God let him deliver him now if he
[31:36] will have a
[31:37] we'll have him for he said I am the son
[31:39] of God it says in verse 44 the thieves
[31:42] also were crucified with him cast the
[31:44] same and his teeth so there's the
[31:47] account that boast thieves
[31:49] you know railing against Jesus they get
[31:51] caught in the atmosphere what's going on
[31:53] they begin to accuse them and all these
[31:54] different things but then it says in
[31:57] Luke 23 where there's the with is the
[32:00] repentant thief
[32:00] and there's the unrepentant thief so so
[32:04] in Luke 23 says that one of the
[32:05] malefactors which was the thieves which
[32:08] were hanged railed on him saying if thou
[32:11] be Christ save thyself and us but the
[32:14] other answering rebuked him saying dost
[32:16] not thou fear God seeing thou art in the
[32:19] same condemnation and we indeed justly
[32:22] for we receive the due reward for our
[32:24] deeds but this man had done nothing
[32:26] amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord
[32:28] remember me when I come us into thy
[32:31] kingdom
[32:32] and we know Jesus great words back to
[32:35] him his response was with yo today
[32:37] you'll be with me in paradise so there
[32:40] was a point in time when twenties were
[32:42] worth speaking your rallying against
[32:45] Jesus saying if you're the Son of God
[32:47] you know save us and yourself and do it
[32:49] you're caught up and what the scribes
[32:50] and Pharisees were doing but then they
[32:52] but then that repentant thief remember
[32:54] God knows where we are
[32:56] God knows where we are and and he wasn't
[32:59] surprised where he found us yo our Lord
[33:02] Jesus wasn't surprised that he found
[33:04] that thief on the cross right here he
[33:06] would be there I mean we believe in the
[33:08] predestination of God don't we you know
[33:10] so he was the thief on the cross was
[33:13] predestinated I mean to hang in that
[33:15] place I can even say he was previously
[33:17] to have the life he lived I mean that
[33:20] God would get him there I meant that
[33:22] with me when the mercy seat was on
[33:23] playing for your Calvary he would look
[33:25] again I mean the first time he looked at
[33:28] Jesus he just made fun of him off you're
[33:30] really the self god save yourself and
[33:32] save us but then he looked again and he
[33:34] saw more than a man mean there he saw
[33:36] his lamb hanging there he saw the Lord
[33:38] of glory hanging there
[33:39] I said lord I mean remember me when you
[33:41] come into your kingdom
[33:42] hallelujah and we know that his
[33:45] confession what he said I mean that
[33:47] actually gave him salvation hallelujah I
[33:50] mean and we have to recognize I mean
[33:53] it's our faith revelation faith real
[33:56] faith I mean that actually makes us
[33:58] righteous I mean you know so the reason
[34:02] I'm going on from Wednesdays because you
[34:04] know we are where we had a lockdown
[34:05] where rejoicing but then the devil wants
[34:08] to hold our past he wants to hold you
[34:11] know he tries to get a toehold anywhere
[34:12] you know you know he's like someone
[34:14] who's seen someone who who who like free
[34:16] climbs up crazy big cliffs who see men
[34:18] you know the devil's caught a lot and in
[34:21] our lives he tries to find a toehold at
[34:22] a foothold in a you know hand hold it in
[34:25] your any crib as he can get in our lives
[34:27] and you know then he tries to hold on
[34:28] but but we have to recognize I'm in the
[34:31] blood of Jesus Christ
[34:32] you know washes us clean that he has no
[34:34] claim on our lives whatsoever I mean he
[34:37] has no hold upon us
[34:39] mm oh but we need to recognize I mean
[34:42] what the Lord has done for us and then
[34:43] walking and hallelujah I mean that's
[34:46] where I'm trying trying to go today I
[34:48] mean I mean so so here was that people
[34:50] on the cross now we know that the
[34:52] scripture tells us that when Paul looks
[34:55] at Abraham he looks at yo your abraham
[34:59] believed God and his face was imputed
[35:01] unto him for righteousness so so he saw
[35:04] you know but in James looked at Abraham
[35:07] and James wrote down his abraham's works
[35:10] and he said that was imputed forever
[35:12] Isis now there's not a contradiction in
[35:15] the scripture brother Bram tells us but
[35:17] but the Prophet tells us that that Paul
[35:20] was writing what God saw with Abraham
[35:22] which was his faith and then James was
[35:25] writing what man saw from Abraham which
[35:26] was his works Amen so I saw both of them
[35:29] we know tie together but so we must
[35:32] understand it awfully I think I preached
[35:34] all those years ago now but you know
[35:36] every believer through the scripture has
[35:38] works amen
[35:40] I think when you look at the thief on
[35:42] the cross he may say well how can he
[35:44] have works
[35:45] I mean his hands are Pinto across this
[35:47] feeder Pinto across I mean he only has a
[35:49] few more
[35:50] look how can he have works well actually
[35:52] his works were actually the same works
[35:54] as he bought house in the scripture as
[35:56] his condition works I mean what he spoke
[36:00] I mean what he believed was now
[36:02] manifested out of his mouth as his cloth
[36:04] when you remember me when you come into
[36:06] your kingdom saw his confession was his
[36:09] works Amen so he believed God right and
[36:13] it was impeded then for righteousness
[36:15] amen so as a confession actually made
[36:18] him was a manifestation that was his
[36:20] works I mean you say well is that all we
[36:23] have to do is just walk around and
[36:24] confess the Word of God no I'll say this
[36:27] if the thief wasn't on the cross he
[36:28] would have been in the upper room yes
[36:30] sir I mean he would have been baptized
[36:32] named the Lord Jesus Christ he would
[36:33] have received the Holy Ghost I mean he
[36:35] would have been walking with the
[36:36] disciples I mean that's all he can do
[36:39] but I'll say this that your confession
[36:40] as the beginning and in now your life he
[36:43] lived as a manifestation of your
[36:45] confession
[36:45] yeah I mean it just follows your
[36:47] procedure that's why it's very important
[36:49] that that from our hearts we agree with
[36:52] the word I mean we confess the word
[36:54] hallelujah we don't confess our
[36:56] condition mention of Jerusalem I think
[36:59] when it's there in Nehemiah stained
[37:00] kitchen imagine if it could speak I mean
[37:04] it's confession when it's rubble you
[37:06] know I just pull imagine what would it
[37:07] say let's say we're rubble we got burned
[37:10] down so many years ago the enemy just
[37:12] walked over us and destroyed us and you
[37:14] know this is what's happened we're in
[37:16] this condition and shows us and this is
[37:18] how you know I guess we'll stay like us
[37:20] but that's not what God saw of Jerusalem
[37:23] I mean because because what Niemeyer's
[37:25] eärnur than Ezra's bird and those ones
[37:27] burdened to rebuild it I mean they
[37:29] didn't see just a building project they
[37:31] saw a city rebuilt and this is for the
[37:34] temple in its glory I mean they saw the
[37:35] priest you know manifesting you know
[37:37] you're afraid you're in their office
[37:39] they saw the worshippers come and they
[37:41] sought the singers sing Alleluia I mean
[37:43] I saw the armies of the city on a hill
[37:46] hallelujah
[37:47] that's what they saw I mean and that's
[37:49] what they had in their mind and yes yes
[37:51] just how God works through his word God
[37:53] begins to project a vision to us how the
[37:56] evening is a project a vision to us I
[37:58] mean we're
[37:59] you know you know we're not a bunch of
[38:00] rubble we're not just something that
[38:01] throws around and burns and does what it
[38:03] wants but we're the children of the
[38:05] Living God of Jerusalem they didn't just
[38:09] were added to that wordy they just had
[38:11] to come out of the rubbish and be put
[38:13] back in the wall hallelujah the sons and
[38:17] daughters of God by the new breath now
[38:22] the Signum ations because she were sons
[38:24] I mean he gave us the Holy Ghost
[38:26] hallelujah
[38:27] so we do become anything by the new
[38:29] birth that's just a manifestation of
[38:30] what we are I mean the devil beat you
[38:34] down sank now you notice own I mean I'll
[38:36] say I'll say we are sons and daughters
[38:38] of God I mean this word has become a
[38:40] living reality to us in the scripture
[38:45] and first Corinthians chapter 1 and
[38:48] verses 17 and 18 you know because people
[38:52] people get so worried about how sincere
[38:54] they are or how not sincere they are and
[38:56] you know they mi sincere enough am I not
[39:01] sincere enough I wanna be more sincere
[39:03] and happier and basically they just
[39:05] standing still and they can't really get
[39:07] out of this prison because the devil
[39:09] uses our own sincerity against us yo you
[39:12] know people ponder do I take the word
[39:14] seriously enough do I take it too
[39:16] seriously under my seat and people just
[39:19] stand in the space been there
[39:22] I mean but you know I like the scripture
[39:27] in 1st Corinthians 1 and 17 and 18 for
[39:31] Paul is saying for Christ see me not to
[39:32] baptize but to preach the gospel not
[39:35] with wisdom of words least the cross
[39:37] cross of Christ should be made of none
[39:39] effect for the preaching of the Cross is
[39:43] to them that perish foolishness but unto
[39:46] us which are saved it is the power of
[39:49] God so now you gotta look at your
[39:51] attitude yeah right Amy
[39:54] to them that perish the preaching of the
[39:56] Cross is foolishness it doesn't mean
[39:59] anything it has no value it has not
[40:00] merit I am as just a foolish empty bunch
[40:03] of silliness you know it has no value it
[40:05] doesn't mean anything to them that's the
[40:07] key
[40:08] the Pickers right people say mi sincere
[40:13] my not sincere yo you look at your
[40:14] attitude towards the word remember
[40:16] brother Ram said the right mental
[40:17] attitude towards any promise of God will
[40:20] cause it to come to pass think that's
[40:22] received in the holy gosh I'll say
[40:24] that's even going in a rapture I mean
[40:27] God looks at me but God puts that
[40:28] attitude in us but you know so we don't
[40:30] need to beat ourselves up are we sincere
[40:32] enough well here's the question as the
[40:35] preaching of the word foolishness to you
[40:38] that means you're not going to perish I
[40:41] mean you to reach others that's what
[40:43] Paul say am I gonna make it am I not
[40:46] gonna make it well what's the attitude
[40:47] of your heart not just up here but
[40:49] what's the attitude in here as the the
[40:51] cross fall is just David I say if it is
[40:54] that means you've been a Pierce but you
[40:55] don't have to stay that way
[40:57] remember the devil thinks it's
[40:59] foolishness because he couldn't see how
[41:01] God could become a man to become the
[41:03] loss of the Lord in order to redeem man
[41:05] back up into glory he could not
[41:07] understand that program because the
[41:09] devil's full of pride he think you know
[41:11] you know Heat
[41:12] there's no humility in him he could not
[41:14] understand how the God who created all
[41:15] things even credit himself could because
[41:17] I love I mean could walk with common man
[41:22] amen
[41:23] I mean could die on the cross in their
[41:25] place he does not understand how God
[41:27] could do this but the devil does not
[41:28] know not what love really is I mean but
[41:33] to us which are saved it is the power of
[41:35] God I mean so so this is a good
[41:38] indication if you've really met the Lord
[41:41] because the preaching the crossed out is
[41:42] the power of God hallelujah
[41:44] so you see that this power and the word
[41:46] to change and you see this power in the
[41:47] woods deliver you you see this power on
[41:49] the word to place you a man in your
[41:51] position in Christ hallelujah I mean so
[41:54] I like don't you hallelujah I love this
[42:02] where you know God is looking for honest
[42:05] hearts he's looking for honest stones
[42:06] and and he knows where those stones are
[42:09] now I just want to go to just a couple
[42:12] if I can let's go to our let's go to
[42:17] this one
[42:18] maybe our Lord Jesus was looking for
[42:20] stones and he knew where they were
[42:23] this is just a picture of the woman at
[42:25] the well I love and how God calls these
[42:28] kind of people does it mean you know you
[42:32] know I'm in that number that blood wash
[42:33] number Halim I remember as I seen it
[42:36] doesn't matter where it came from
[42:37] I mean it's wat who we are in God's
[42:39] thinking so so Jesus went before the
[42:43] scene and on how he dressed you know
[42:45] bimba this is just a your drawing
[42:47] someone drew try to make it yeah but yo
[42:49] he said I need you by the way of Samaria
[42:51] and the reason he needed to go there is
[42:53] because there was a stone he was seeking
[42:55] out there well clear there was a man
[42:56] standing upon the u.s. that was seeking
[42:58] out the welfare of the people
[43:00] I mean so there he was and remember when
[43:03] he seeks out our welfare when he was
[43:05] looking for the woman at the well for
[43:06] her welfare
[43:07] he wasn't looking at oh I need to give
[43:09] her a bigger house I need to give her a
[43:11] put it in a jar baby on eater you know
[43:13] our baby just give her some kind of nice
[43:15] I need to give her a new pot for the
[43:16] whelmed maybe need race you know that's
[43:18] not the kind of welfare then he looks
[43:20] for he's looking for our spiritual
[43:22] welfare yeah we know in the room is too
[43:25] well for us people it's not just a
[43:27] partial welfare it's a full welfare
[43:29] benefit hallelujah I mean I'm in full
[43:32] benefit so so here it is and he's coming
[43:35] to find the woman at the well he knew
[43:38] where she was he knew where the slipping
[43:40] stone walls amen and you know they were
[43:42] going to talk back and forth and then
[43:45] finally she says you know we we know
[43:47] we're Messiah cometh he'll do all these
[43:49] things and now here's the Builder and
[43:51] flesh and and he begins to reveal
[43:54] himself to the stone and he just says to
[43:57] her he that speaks of thee MP and then
[44:01] program said that the light that would
[44:03] struck the seed and she came to life and
[44:20] I'll say the light strikes the seed
[44:22] nothing can put it out I mean nothing
[44:25] hallelujah I mean because maybe the Lord
[44:28] kind of seemed well welfare even in this
[44:30] time when the world
[44:31] we have this lockdown and we have all
[44:33] these things going on you know the
[44:35] Lord's here to see how wealthy people
[44:37] the Lord us doesn't come and check up on
[44:39] us hey doing today and then go home
[44:40] there's not how God works I'm still with
[44:43] us every day looking after us protecting
[44:46] us guiding us comforting us we were in
[44:49] trouble
[44:50] I mean he knows the burdens we carry
[44:52] hallelujah you know if he's here to see
[44:54] Kelly
[44:57] now he's another one and I love the
[45:00] story anymore where's the here we are
[45:05] this is a picture of Mary at the tomb
[45:08] hallelujah she goes to the tomb she
[45:13] finds it - you know the stone all the
[45:15] way you know no doubt in her mind before
[45:17] the scene that you know that yo she is
[45:19] go with the other woman that you're
[45:20] bringing spices to thee to the - maybe
[45:23] now try and think in their minds how are
[45:25] we going to talk to the soldiers that
[45:26] they'll lead us in you know because
[45:28] there's a Roman guard around them how
[45:30] we're gonna convince them that yes
[45:31] unseal the - medicine and you know I
[45:34] don't know what they're thinking in
[45:35] their mind but that's thinking we're
[45:36] gonna anoint a dead body I mean but they
[45:38] weren't there but but in God's mind s I
[45:40] don't know you're not gonna come see a
[45:42] dead body and here to see a resurrected
[45:44] Christ hallelujah
[45:46] I mean so there she washes or troubled
[45:47] bimba even in this time of trouble the
[45:50] Lord came to seek the welfare of his
[45:52] people
[45:52] I mean that his disciples wouldn't stay
[45:55] troubled they once they worried in this
[45:58] resurrection hour remember they were
[46:00] living in the greatest week brother Brad
[46:01] Caesar in history the death burial
[46:04] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[46:05] the greatest week in history said it was
[46:08] and here they were their will has fallen
[46:10] apart the one they loved was hanging on
[46:12] a tree dead a man crying out for mercy
[46:15] my God my God wash out for sake of me
[46:17] then they hastily wrap his body up put
[46:19] it in the tomb you know the disciples
[46:21] hid themselves away in her you know in
[46:24] an upper room and all these things were
[46:25] going on there well that falling apart
[46:27] yeah but I just want you to recognize
[46:30] young your brother Brad sees it so well
[46:32] we see us he wasn't just it wasn't just
[46:35] three it's that day he was four yeah we
[46:39] know and and Jesus Jesus so there's
[46:43] Jesus the two thieves and they were
[46:44] with Judas and we see now Jesus
[46:48] he took the repentant thief who had
[46:51] faith to heaven Judas took the
[46:55] unrepeated feat thief who had unbelief
[46:58] to hell so Jesus claims us and took his
[47:01] Judas took his until cares to his place
[47:05] but you see his here's the thief on the
[47:07] cross he had faith Lord remember when
[47:09] you come into your kingdom that was
[47:11] imputed to him for righteousness and he
[47:13] ended up in the same place that Abraham
[47:16] Isaac and Jacob did I mean he didn't do
[47:19] money exploits I mean he didn't do
[47:20] incredible things but he saw the lamb he
[47:23] saw the word manifested in his day and
[47:25] that was imputed to him for
[47:27] righteousness hallelujah he ended up in
[47:30] paradise and that's the main thing I
[47:32] didn't you know we struggle sometimes
[47:34] are we are we living a Christian life
[47:36] you know are we pleasing the Lord and
[47:38] because we love from me what a pleasing
[47:39] but you know you know somehow you know
[47:42] that kind of thought pattern puts us
[47:43] saved or partially saved a lot saved a
[47:47] man whose yeah this is okay I'm glad
[47:51] it's not just makes you know but you
[47:53] gotta wrestle in this kind of thing but
[47:56] actually God sees your faith I mean he
[47:59] sees you can you know he sees your faith
[48:01] he sees your faith that's a PITA to try
[48:03] justice hallelujah I mean so here she is
[48:07] now now we're just coming to the picture
[48:09] that I've got the air and and you know
[48:12] so they come to the tomb the stones are
[48:14] all the way there's no soldiers around
[48:15] you know all you know this is all going
[48:18] on and then she's wondering where what's
[48:20] happened so number one they are still
[48:24] brokenhearted that dear Savior the
[48:26] Messiah the yes but now they have
[48:29] another bit of anguish where's his body
[48:31] gone because in the Jewish and the
[48:34] Jewish religion so they used to believe
[48:37] that the body should be whole I mean
[48:39] because it will literally come out of
[48:40] the grave right so that's why they
[48:42] didn't believe in burning bodies in
[48:44] cremation and all those things they
[48:46] believed the body had to be buried whole
[48:48] but now is his body gone where's this
[48:52] one with their you know it's
[48:55] it's tough enough that they Messire is
[48:57] near to the tomb but now he's another
[48:59] piece of anguish but where is his body
[49:01] and then she's weeping there standing
[49:03] and then the Lord is standing behind a
[49:06] resurrected glory amen and then he says
[49:09] woman why are you weeping and she needs
[49:12] to say you know she thought he was a
[49:15] gardener and said have you taken him
[49:17] that I can go and carry him away you
[49:19] read it in John she wanted to carry his
[49:22] body away
[49:23] hallelujah but she wasn't mean to
[49:25] Carraway I did fall need me to run with
[49:28] a resurrected Christ the Lord with the
[49:33] seek the welfare is people in a time of
[49:35] trouble and you know we are in the same
[49:38] kind of resurrection cycle I mean just
[49:41] as they were did my brother Brian would
[49:43] preach the sermon
[49:44] Mondavi to make clear my prophecy and he
[49:47] goes to Luke chapter 24 and he begins to
[49:50] read about the - on the way toward - I
[49:52] forgot the term and what he is saying is
[49:54] he's saying these modern events who's
[49:57] living a modern event here we are I made
[49:59] clear by the prophecy which is Luke
[50:01] chapter 24 oh that's a prophecy so if
[50:05] it's a prophecy there has to be a people
[50:07] that live that fulfill the prophecy so
[50:11] what's in the prophecy the crucifixion
[50:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean they try
[50:15] and seal them away behind preaching
[50:17] dogmas of man I mean behind that term
[50:20] and then what else is in the prophecy
[50:22] the believers that again themselves to
[50:24] this Living Word this one they rejoice
[50:26] in that he remains back like this man
[50:29] and he's done incredible things and you
[50:30] know if rallied to him but now he's
[50:32] crucified and and the whole world that
[50:35] seems is falling apart and they don't
[50:37] know what's going on big trouble
[50:39] hello that's not a night oh wait here we
[50:43] are I'm in but then that's not the end
[50:46] of the picture in the Lord comes in
[50:48] another form that same one before years
[50:51] crucified it's now alive again and he
[50:54] walks with him and he opens the
[50:57] scripture everything concerning himself
[50:59] beginning from Moses he sees think of
[51:01] Matthew 24 - the way to run away so fast
[51:05] and he begins to preach them the
[51:08] scripture thus say the scripture is
[51:10] fulfilled in your is I mean but but they
[51:13] don't recognize that the one that
[51:15] fulfilled the scripture is walking with
[51:17] them oh yeah but he went with them all
[51:20] the way to Emmaus
[51:21] opening the scripture and it's exactly
[51:24] the same thing with you and I friends up
[51:26] our Lord isn't dead
[51:28] he's risen I mean he's walking upon the
[51:32] earth he's come to seek out hallelujah
[51:34] and he with you or he is going with you
[51:38] and he's opening this book Rory's in a
[51:45] bunch of history and a bunch of rules
[51:46] and invites a love letter and he's
[51:50] hoping the word I mean not just a show
[51:52] where he is in the scripture but to show
[51:54] you the scripture you know I was I was
[52:00] thinking you know I watch this is a few
[52:02] weeks ago now our first find about these
[52:04] kind of thoughts you know I was watching
[52:06] brother Bissell's testimony being read
[52:08] out just the first part and I was
[52:10] sitting there at work and such a humble
[52:12] sweet feeling came over me where he was
[52:15] you know it's amazing how the Prophet
[52:17] would would would go and you know he'd
[52:20] have a discernment line and he'd say now
[52:22] this is like Jesus at the wall and the
[52:24] woman at the well or this is like the
[52:27] Lord coming to a bruh Haman Sarah you
[52:30] know you know he'd speaking about the
[52:32] two going into Sodom and all those
[52:34] things we see but what about the royal
[52:35] seed you're waiting for a sign as well
[52:38] and then he'd go down to you know
[52:40] speaking about how the Lord was sitting
[52:42] there and your two angels are in flesh
[52:44] as they were talking to Abraham and then
[52:47] Abraham would say you know I mean I mean
[52:49] the Lord would ask we're sure thy wife
[52:51] and the and Abraham would say to him
[52:54] she's in the tent behind you and then
[52:56] our poem says now I'll turn my back to
[52:58] the person and he's trying to get the
[53:01] people to actually see you know he's not
[53:03] doing it as a show but he's trying to
[53:05] get the people to see that same God back
[53:08] there back in 1965
[53:18] just about discernment I'm talking about
[53:21] God taking the scripture yeah this is
[53:24] where I wanted to come to at this point
[53:25] is that it's one thing it's it's only to
[53:30] me now it's an incredible thing where
[53:33] God would come and show you in the
[53:34] scripture and it's more than you working
[53:37] it out it's more than you trying to find
[53:39] a Bible character that fits your
[53:40] situation but you're reading through the
[53:42] scripture and God says that's you that's
[53:47] you
[53:48] it means just like you know you had the
[53:51] term reading of the resurrection and
[53:53] these Mary they're troubled and God
[53:55] comes down really he can do it comes
[53:58] down says you're married hallelujah I'm
[54:02] still here
[54:03] amen I'm alive I called you by name I
[54:06] mean this message just called you by
[54:08] name and then recognized I'm not dead
[54:11] I'm not back 50 60 years ago I'm not
[54:14] 2000 years ago I've been 2020 and even
[54:18] gonna say you're married and no one's
[54:20] told you he told you David's life and
[54:25] God says you're David
[54:27] he literally transports you I wish I
[54:30] could put this in words but I trust you
[54:31] understand website he literally takes
[54:33] you put you in those in that scripture
[54:36] and it's like David's not called baby's
[54:39] called Ben thank you to wear maybe
[54:45] Hannah was crying before the temple your
[54:47] private full the tabernacle crying for
[54:49] birth for life to come out of herself
[54:51] halogen and your and the Lord let's we
[54:54] put you on this and your henna Rebecca
[54:59] maybe Isaac whoever it might be down
[55:00] through the scripture God will take you
[55:02] Chris had that experience and what he's
[55:06] doing he's trying to say that as you are
[55:08] that person as I was gone to them on God
[55:12] to you because that's the thing the
[55:22] Prophet that it over and over again
[55:24] trying to get the people to see the same
[55:26] one is here and it started
[55:29] Stein's glory as the Stars I said were
[55:35] predestined to life there's nothing
[55:36] special about us didn't work this out
[55:40] didn't earn this thing because I was
[55:42] good bid or whatever no God saw the
[55:45] Stars laying in the field playing in the
[55:47] earth he saw you where you were
[55:49] whenever you were born he knew you'd be
[55:50] there hallelujah and he saw the Stars
[55:52] anytime to see you welfare I didn't work
[55:56] in the muck and mire and he didn't one
[55:58] you in a bunch of rooms hilarious he's
[56:00] not gonna take these studs because
[56:01] they're about in my mind I'm gonna pull
[56:03] them in the building of my body
[56:05] hallelujah and so when he came to this
[56:14] generation huh that's why that's why I
[56:16] believe the Prophet laboured so I'm not
[56:18] saying that this is like the woman at
[56:20] the well indecent
[56:21] should I say the same things happening
[56:24] today more than a gift more than just
[56:27] the supernatural but as God Himself
[56:29] coming to a generation and and he begin
[56:32] to cool that generation because he was
[56:33] looking for stones he's looking for
[56:35] parts of the building I mean it just
[56:38] like those ones when Jesus came the
[56:40] first time the illiterate the outcast
[56:42] light Legion or all the water of the
[56:44] well or Mary Magdalene who ever was I
[56:47] mean Peter James and John he came to
[56:49] those stones and there's something in
[56:51] those dogs saying I'll be placed in the
[56:53] building because it's a choice member
[56:56] God you know God doesn't forces in the
[56:58] body of Christ I mean he's not a bully
[57:00] he's a gentleman you have to concede I
[57:03] mean will you be placed in the building
[57:04] you say yes Lord I'll be placed in the
[57:06] building how'd he get place in the
[57:08] building repainted me baptized am i Lord
[57:10] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[57:11] gift of the Holy Ghost you'll be placed
[57:13] in the building I mean so he found us in
[57:20] this generation oh we can see I trust
[57:24] that you know when he takes you under
[57:26] the scripture and he shows you who you
[57:28] are in here because what's he been doing
[57:32] now what's he been doing now walking
[57:34] with us in these these decades he's been
[57:38] opening the scripture and showing
[57:41] everything concerning
[57:43] but Sonata themself but showing you in
[57:46] the scripture I meant to show you the
[57:50] same God I was to David I'll be to you
[57:52] the same God I was to Hannah
[57:55] I'll be to you the same motto was to
[57:58] Isaac I'll be to Solomon I'll be to use
[58:03] the same God I was to to remit care or I
[58:06] mean to see I mean the same God I was to
[58:09] Peter James and John I'll be to you
[58:10] hallelujah
[58:11] I mean the same things that you're the
[58:14] same thought I was to Rahab all be to
[58:15] you hallelujah
[58:21] no but yeah I like how the Prophet puts
[58:25] things now remember now I won't have
[58:29] time I don't think to read all the
[58:31] scriptures but if you're going to say
[58:33] Romans and and and Hebrews different
[58:35] places where Paul is writing he says
[58:37] that Abraham was justified by his faith
[58:39] and not only him but also all those that
[58:42] are the ears of the promise yes I mean
[58:45] as their faith that justifies us now
[58:47] talk about God revealing you know his
[58:49] faith to you right real faith I'm not
[58:52] doing my - human faith I know about real
[58:53] faith Amy so now he sees this doesn't
[59:00] show us the father
[59:02] he sees the reason our sins are covered
[59:05] by the blood he says blood is a danger
[59:07] sign to us read is a danger sign to us
[59:09] but it's also a sign of redemption it's
[59:12] a red streak of blood wine that's way
[59:15] all the way through the Bible you can
[59:18] take red and look through read it red
[59:20] and it looks white who's done that
[59:23] amen
[59:25] though your sins be as scarlet God looks
[59:28] through the blood of Jesus they're white
[59:30] as snow hallelujah
[59:32] he don't see sin any more when you've
[59:35] confessed your sins and took the blood
[59:37] of Jesus he says sin problem is over I
[59:41] mean God is looking for a red and you
[59:44] look whiter snow I want to say this
[59:47] because I like it when you've confessed
[59:49] your sins and took the blood of Jesus
[59:51] sin problem as Arva
[59:56] the problems I'm up halleluja whackers
[59:59] goddess looking through red and you look
[1:00:01] whiter start now
[1:00:04] I can find this now as I see if we're
[1:00:06] going to jump around a bit so we're
[1:00:07] going to jump around a bit more
[1:00:08] but maybe the Lord's come to seek our
[1:00:10] welfare now when we talk about being
[1:00:12] covered by the blood now I love the
[1:00:16] definition of the word covered it means
[1:00:18] past tense only it's happened in the
[1:00:20] past
[1:00:21] I mean covered now it means to put
[1:00:24] something on top of or in front of
[1:00:27] something in order to protect it or to
[1:00:30] conceal it yeah I mean so now sorry so
[1:00:33] when the blood was put on the doorposts
[1:00:35] and the lintel there on the Israel
[1:00:37] you're the Hebrew children's houses
[1:00:39] there you're you're in in Egypt before
[1:00:43] the Passover it was to protect them or
[1:00:46] to conceal them I mean so so when the
[1:00:49] Death Angel came and I think it was
[1:00:50] brother Jason walk and see this and it
[1:00:52] just bless my soul so much when he said
[1:00:54] you know when the Death Angel came over
[1:00:57] Egypt and and he would come to a house
[1:01:00] and had the blood on the doorpost and in
[1:01:02] his testimony his confession was I see
[1:01:05] the Blood I can't go in there
[1:01:06] I mean that was that was that this
[1:01:08] Angels you know testimony of the
[1:01:10] believers under the bloody sea like to
[1:01:11] see the blood I can't go and there are
[1:01:13] contact the first form hallelujah and as
[1:01:16] and it's exactly the same I mean in the
[1:01:18] South at when people are truly under the
[1:01:20] blood that's actually the death angels
[1:01:22] confession I'll say no no they did then
[1:01:24] you but the devil's confession I see the
[1:01:26] blood may be the devil's gonna testify
[1:01:29] but they will kiss the Flies of the
[1:01:31] bride to Pilate Jesus enemies do not
[1:01:35] find no fault in this man
[1:01:36] well then within the enemy now testifies
[1:01:39] of us saying I see the blood elio I
[1:01:42] can't get in there I see the black hole
[1:01:46] testimony of you as soon as I see the
[1:01:48] blood and we know that the blood the
[1:01:51] blood is applied when the Holy Ghost
[1:01:52] come into our life right I mean we know
[1:01:55] that token today just like Israel had a
[1:01:57] token I mean the token today is the Holy
[1:02:01] Ghost believe it so now so the devil
[1:02:05] when he testifies of you
[1:02:06] my trying to think try to make you think
[1:02:08] many things about yourself and none of
[1:02:10] them are good I mean isn't that right he
[1:02:14] never tells you that you're victorious
[1:02:15] and you and your gods proud of you and
[1:02:18] you're gonna make it and you know rules
[1:02:19] well if you're just overcoming you never
[1:02:22] ever tells you those things anyone likes
[1:02:25] me and I'm accepted and you know I'm um
[1:02:27] y'all just fit into the body of Christ
[1:02:29] and everything's like he never tells you
[1:02:31] those things you always tells you that
[1:02:33] you're not accepted no one likes you
[1:02:35] God doesn't love you God doesn't know
[1:02:37] you you don't know God you never
[1:02:39] overcome is it just me now he tells us
[1:02:43] things okay I'm glad all my friends and
[1:02:46] understand me today I mean so so he
[1:02:51] never tells you good things now but his
[1:02:54] testimony he may tell you he may put
[1:02:56] those thoughts in your mind but if he
[1:02:58] was really honest and I don't think the
[1:03:00] people really can be honest but just
[1:03:01] happy was he would say his tears I would
[1:03:04] say would be I see the blood I see these
[1:03:09] people are covered I see these people
[1:03:12] are covered by the blood now remember to
[1:03:14] cover something means um it's covered in
[1:03:16] order to protect it or to conceal it
[1:03:18] right Nima is a man that has come to
[1:03:22] seek our welfare that is the Lord Jesus
[1:03:24] Christ I mean so obese time to see how
[1:03:26] seek our welfare meaningless must come
[1:03:29] to protect us or to conceal us
[1:03:32] hallelujah so now something's covered
[1:03:35] now this just so I'm just kind of gone
[1:03:37] away with the where's the mouse gone
[1:03:39] let's go to another picture now so he
[1:03:42] came he came to protect now this is when
[1:03:48] I think I've covered now I think of
[1:03:49] flood waters this may seem a bit now

[1:03:54] cyclone I'm not sure how many years ago
[1:03:56] but you see you see that place is
[1:03:58] covered by water

[1:12:49] such a such
[1:12:51] love for people we share such a love and
[1:12:56] a concern for people and it should be
[1:12:59] such the spirit of Christ on us I was
[1:13:02] thinking because we're like like we're
[1:13:03] reading through the Psalms and you know
[1:13:07] many of the Psalms you know that your
[1:13:08] David will praise the Lord but they'll
[1:13:09] say basically cut my enemies off destroy
[1:13:11] them you know almost you know and and I
[1:13:14] was thinking you know we do have enemies
[1:13:17] in this life we do have critics and I
[1:13:21] think it's brother on speeds a seat you
[1:13:22] know you know everyone should have a
[1:13:24] critic because in order to be a great
[1:13:27] piece of art you have to go through the
[1:13:28] hall of critics before you can be in the
[1:13:30] Hall of Fame so so we'll have critics
[1:13:34] but to me when we read in the Psalms
[1:13:39] about David saying yo yo hey you're
[1:13:41] asking there's enemies being cut off and
[1:13:43] you know and you know that other people
[1:13:45] are either out outrightly against you or
[1:13:48] even suddenly against you it should you
[1:13:51] know trying to destroy your influence or
[1:13:53] whatever it should immediately throw us
[1:13:55] into intercession on behalf of that
[1:13:57] person do you mean I mean that's what it
[1:13:59] should do and should ever be in they
[1:14:01] deserve it I mean we all deserved help
[1:14:04] we all deserve it and but God Richard
[1:14:07] mercy found us watch this and I've
[1:14:09] redeemed us to himself and it wasn't my
[1:14:12] choosing it wasn't your one day I woke
[1:14:14] up said I'm gonna be righteous now right
[1:14:16] you know none of us have had that
[1:14:18] decision I'm just gonna be holy and I'm
[1:14:20] gonna be washed in the blood you know it
[1:14:22] no it was God's mercy
[1:14:24] you know God actually chose yeah but the
[1:14:27] man speaks in the church age book about
[1:14:29] God's sovereignty he says that be a
[1:14:31] whole other book in itself he just
[1:14:32] mentions it but you know it was actually
[1:14:34] God's choosing I'm gonna wash you on the
[1:14:37] blood I'm gonna make you in my image
[1:14:40] it wasn't our choice memorize not having
[1:14:43] a will offer on earth but God to show us
[1:14:44] mercy I mean sir and then even brother
[1:14:48] Aaron says he says you know we we
[1:14:50] wouldn't even wish we wouldn't even wish
[1:14:51] Helen out we shouldn't wish hell on our
[1:14:53] worst enemy or even the tribulation I'll
[1:14:55] say whenever we read about those cross
[1:14:57] things in the Psalms to me I mean we
[1:14:59] should be crying up an intersession for
[1:15:02] those who may be against us
[1:15:04] by doing it right and now brother Graham
[1:15:06] sees in the Uniting time and sign he
[1:15:09] says and I don't want to say too much on
[1:15:11] you know about people complaining
[1:15:13] we shouldn't be complainants yeah
[1:15:15] because I think one of the hardest
[1:15:19] things is to see a man or a woman that's
[1:15:21] constantly complaining is one of the
[1:15:24] most horriblest things is a man or woman
[1:15:27] is constantly complaining so we
[1:15:28] shouldn't be complaining amen
[1:15:31] why don't we got to complain about I'm
[1:15:33] not close on
[1:15:34] I mean witness when the service ends oh
[1:15:37] they'll be starting to eat they'll be
[1:15:39] lunch
[1:15:39] I've got a roof over my head I mean and
[1:15:43] even if I didn't have any of those
[1:15:44] things
[1:15:45] I have eternal life and it's all the
[1:15:48] matters y'all think brother Isaac said
[1:15:53] we never eat pizza while there I say
[1:15:55] what's the worst of good they could have
[1:15:56] to me I could die why is it such a bad
[1:15:59] thing I'll go to glory I think you have
[1:16:02] a dish wishing you want to die but you
[1:16:04] know what's the worst thing that could
[1:16:05] happen
[1:16:07] my soul is sealed away I'm covered by
[1:16:10] the one hallelujah we have to complain a
[1:16:15] bit
[1:16:17] hey I've always thought so I'm just
[1:16:20] reading the quote again I've always
[1:16:21] thought God keep me from it see that
[1:16:24] weakens faith all the time you want to
[1:16:27] weaken your faith complain that's what
[1:16:30] he's saying
[1:16:31] yeah I don't have it on the screen but
[1:16:33] it's there it's playback the front but
[1:16:34] anyway I can I can see that tears and
[1:16:36] uniting time inside 1963 see it weakens
[1:16:39] faith all the time you know I know as
[1:16:41] they get older each one of us we're
[1:16:43] going to get something happen and
[1:16:45] something happened and I know those
[1:16:47] little things are going to keep
[1:16:48] accumulating then as you get older they
[1:16:51] just got to but I think one of the most
[1:16:53] horrible things is for Satan to crown
[1:16:56] some person's life a crabbed old man or
[1:16:59] an old woman you see I hope that I don't
[1:17:04] get to that place I hope that I can bear
[1:17:06] it my burdens and get to a spot he says
[1:17:09] I want my life crowned with the glory of
[1:17:12] God his long-suffering gentleness
[1:17:16] meekness and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:20] he said well how do I become a crab dog
[1:17:22] man or old woman he started some with
[1:17:25] young people who are in that condition
[1:17:26] they start something and it becomes a
[1:17:29] habit to complain about everything
[1:17:31] yes and then the devil just annoys that
[1:17:33] person's life but all they see now is
[1:17:35] through something's wrong something's
[1:17:37] wrong here I don't know I don't know one
[1:17:39] guard on the subject but here we are you
[1:17:41] know something's wrong over here and
[1:17:42] this is wrong and this is not right and
[1:17:44] this is how she be this and it just
[1:17:46] weakens their faith all the time and
[1:17:48] eventually it just becomes like a
[1:17:50] subconscious habit my brother Andy any
[1:17:52] preachers are just become so pioneer
[1:17:54] subconscious then everything is wrong
[1:17:56] it's negative it's bad it's never right
[1:17:58] enough oh I wish you could be this way
[1:18:00] and you're living in some nostalgia idea
[1:18:02] that if he really was there way to be
[1:18:03] good month and what happens and he's
[1:18:05] become this crabbed old man or old woman
[1:18:07] I said Lord Jesus help us ever to be a
[1:18:10] bunch of complaining it has always beat
[1:18:13] and everything give thanks that's how it
[1:18:19] could be I mean I'll just amen
[1:18:25] now I'm just gonna read two more
[1:18:28] scriptures in the anvil and then and
[1:18:31] then we're gonna in Hebrews 6 verses 10
[1:18:33] to 12 for God is not unrighteous to
[1:18:36] forget your work and labor of love which
[1:18:39] he have showed towards his name and that
[1:18:42] he have ministered to the Saints and do
[1:18:44] minister Emma God is not unrighteous to
[1:18:47] forget your work he doesn't forget what
[1:18:49] we do know that we're trying to get a
[1:18:52] reward and we desire that every one of
[1:18:56] you do show the same diligence to the
[1:18:58] full assurance of hope unto the end
[1:19:00] may it be not slothful but followers of
[1:19:04] them that through faith and patience and
[1:19:06] hear the promises you know it's not in
[1:19:10] my notes but I was looking last night
[1:19:12] at the word guile and the word guile
[1:19:16] isn't just someone who deceives and
[1:19:19] things but it's actually people are
[1:19:20] slothful
[1:19:21] it's actually got quite a broad
[1:19:23] definition and I read that I said lord I
[1:19:26] don't want to have guile take all the
[1:19:27] guile out of me
[1:19:28] take a look all out of me I mean we
[1:19:32] should mix getting you know we should be
[1:19:34] in this lockdown we should be changing
[1:19:36] some heavens you know we should be using
[1:19:42] this time as an opportunity to change
[1:19:44] your habits change our change our prayer
[1:19:47] life change our walk with God I mean we
[1:19:49] should be you know we should be trying
[1:19:53] to change everything that that when the
[1:19:54] lockdown ends we don't just go back into
[1:19:56] the same rut that we came out of a man
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:00] a man came in and then he sees an x-15 8
[1:20:04] & 9 and I'm just gonna finish this in
[1:20:06] the end and this is where I started with
[1:20:08] you're the thief on the cross and also
[1:20:10] you know how his his heart his
[1:20:13] confession was his works and by that he
[1:20:17] received salvation and God which North
[1:20:20] the hearts is x-15 8 and 9 and God North
[1:20:23] the heart spared the witness giving him
[1:20:25] the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us
[1:20:28] and put no difference between us and
[1:20:30] them purifying their hearts by faith
[1:20:36] amen
[1:20:39] we went as many times that our hearts
[1:20:42] pure had they been washed in the blood
[1:20:44] of lamb well there has a purified by
[1:20:46] faith well how did that happen with the
[1:20:48] jinn does it you know they're talking
[1:20:50] about the Gentiles well this just got to
[1:20:52] Cornelius house for a second he's
[1:20:54] praying he's seeking God an angel comes
[1:20:57] to him and says go go get Peter and
[1:20:59] Joppa he'll tell you the words of
[1:21:00] eternal life he begins to gather his
[1:21:03] people around there under expectation
[1:21:05] then he comes one that's carried the
[1:21:06] Holy Ghost carrying the word for the
[1:21:08] hour he begins to preach to them they
[1:21:11] believe what he says and while you and
[1:21:13] because they believe what he sees while
[1:21:14] yet Peter spake these words the Holy
[1:21:16] Ghost fell upon him like it did on the
[1:21:18] day of Pentecost yeah I mean they
[1:21:21] believed the word they received it that
[1:21:22] the right mental attitude towards it
[1:21:24] that wasn't foolishness to them they
[1:21:25] weren't perishing they were saved they
[1:21:27] made us the power of God unto them
[1:21:29] hallelujah and they received the Holy
[1:21:31] Ghost and what happened
[1:21:32] beautify their huts amen hello exactly
[1:21:36] it's exactly the same with you and I and
[1:21:40] I'll be washed clean I say well do you
[1:21:41] have a heart of faith for the whole Word
[1:21:45] of God not just four bits in the Word of
[1:21:46] God
[1:21:47] remember this message is to actually
[1:21:49] restore respect to faith the faith of
[1:21:51] this I enter the whole Word of God
[1:21:54] maleate not just a parts of it but to
[1:21:56] the whole thing you know like for
[1:21:58] example Peter sit on that that Pentecost
[1:22:00] repent be baptized name Lord Jesus
[1:22:02] Christ I use this little strategy
[1:22:04] because the most obvious one but then
[1:22:06] people take Matthew 28:19 and Jesus is
[1:22:08] baptized in the name of the Father Son
[1:22:09] Holy Ghost and a lot of people say well
[1:22:12] I'd rather take the words of Jesus about
[1:22:14] the words of Peter
[1:22:15] now to me that's unbelief because they
[1:22:19] don't have faith in the full word of God
[1:22:21] I mean but those who provides have been
[1:22:25] returned to the faith of the fathers
[1:22:26] also actually that is Jesus speaking
[1:22:29] Matthew 28:19 is the same Jesus speaking
[1:22:31] through Peter that's not Jesus's words
[1:22:34] and then this Peters words down here the
[1:22:37] same ones speaking in Matthew train
[1:22:38] times it's the same one speaking X 338
[1:22:41] the same thing with Paul's writings you
[1:22:43] know I've had people say to me all that
[1:22:45] was his Paul's opinion that's not
[1:22:46] important but impulse in every all
[1:22:49] Scripture is inspired by God
[1:22:51] other translate translations that says
[1:22:54] all Scripture is god-breathed right so
[1:22:57] so those hearts that we turn to faithful
[1:22:59] actually say yes this is not God's Word
[1:23:02] and in business man's opinion this is
[1:23:04] all pluses normal oh yeah that's all the
[1:23:08] Word of God so how do you know your
[1:23:12] heart has been purified by faith you
[1:23:14] actually brother Gramps in this is a
[1:23:17] sign you have the Holy Ghost you say
[1:23:18] Amen you're lucky I ain't mean to every
[1:23:20] word of God all your emotions
[1:23:22] necessarily because you could be the
[1:23:24] other wood can be correcting something
[1:23:26] and your emotions will be upset but the
[1:23:28] young you say Amen that's true and you
[1:23:31] last died your most and you just take
[1:23:32] the word yeah I'm changing amen
[1:23:37] but anyway there's a man who's come to
[1:23:40] seek out well fear no more Jesus Christ
[1:23:43] himself was coming the South they see
[1:23:45] our welfare so don't be troubled don't
[1:23:48] worry he's here walking with us I mean
[1:23:52] to make sure our spiritual welfare as
[1:23:55] exactly as he intended it to be
[1:23:57] hallelujah which is covered covered by
[1:24:00] the blood hey men oh god bless you all

[1:24:07] the service over back to the Chocolate

[1:24:10] remembered in prayer just want to raise
