greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and I thank the musicians and Brother David and when I saw the pastor when I came I my jump was my heart was jumping for joy that the pastor is doing the songs tonight and I was excited but be that as it means thank you brothers and sisters the Lord bless you while we're standing without any waste of time let's just read a scripture and I wanted to ask you a question like brother Isaac always do says is everyone okay tonight is everyone happy you look happy and smiling on your faces yes I'm following my brother's footsteps amen let's read Genesis chapter 1. and then we'll read verse three to four oops sorry I thought I put it on airplane but I have not are we all there and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness that's what God did let's read Ephesians 5 8. Ephesians 5 8 then I will I will I'll then ask you to sit down the book of Ephesians once you are there just indicate by saying amen amen you know that song that says my Bible and I how many knows that's all my Bible and I it's like it's your friend your Bible is is personalized at to a point where you know when you put things in the house you can't put nothing on top of it it's your friend you know no one must touch your friend it's like it's like a person yeah in book form amen let's read Ephesians chapter 5. 8 2 verse 8 9 and 14 I believe the word says for ye where sometimes Darkness you wear Darkness not you were in darkness you were Darkness and for this sorry where am I now five and eight let me finish verse eight my apologies for ye were sometimes Darkness but now I.E light in the Lord you are now light in the long term Walk and Walk as children of light you you are the children of the light tonight you are it's not me who's saying these brothers and sisters it's the Bible it says you are the children of the light I know a child of a dog is a dog are we getting it let's read this um nine yeah for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth verse 14. therefore he said awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light Heavenly Father we can never never call thy name enough I'm just asking Lord that you just take over Lord I'm just a human being full of many many mistakes Lord maybe some of my mistakes my brothers and sisters they know them but father you are the perfect god without mistakes and I pray father that Lord you just take over the service set me aside Lord take your children's hearts Lord and make them their receptive vessels take this service Lodge to honor your name to give glory and praise unto your name because you said by the foolishness of preaching you will save men you also said father when we are gathering in your name even if it's two or three Lord you said you will be there we are holding on that weight father tonight your children have left everything they have left their homes they've taken money and put in their cars for petrol they've taken their time load to come here this evening I believe you've got something in store for each one father bless the service as we commit into your hands in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the church says amen please have the comfort of your seeds and thank you brother Ben for this opportunity my brother as I always say you know that I'm just I'm I'm I'm a spare you know and a spare wheel is the will that comes when all other four wheels one of them has got a scored a slow Punjab we remove and put it on that one so we're just gonna have a quick uh the word of God is never small but we are just gonna have a snack tonight who's ready for a snake every dessert a dessert so we're gonna have it because on Sunday you had a full meal full meal I really enjoyed myself on Sunday and I heard that sermon on Sunday that it was a continuation of Wednesday I don't know if any of you caught it me I hate it and I went back to the tape to the sermon and I listened I hear the pastor saying oh on Sunday maybe I'll talk about the Rapture I said oh that's why did you get it maybe you missed it but uh let's continue I want us to today also to read that scripture the Thessalonians ye are the children of light the Bible reiterates this yeah and the children of the day you are you are the children of the day right we are not of the night no of Darkness I've always asked myself a question and I've always asked myself a question why God at the beginning when he was creating oh sorry brother Ben I said I was going to start with my testimony I'll reserve it I'll postpone it and I thought I would have received a footage of the of the of the accident so that I could show you pictures but I haven't but I'll I'll just remind me once I get it so that I can give God the glory and the honor but tonight not yet but we want to talk about children of the light which is you I've always wondered why if the if everything that was dark there was nothing there was emptiness only the spirit of the Lord was hovering upon the space why did God start by saying let there be light why didn't God say start by saying oh okay let me start let there be a first why didn't God say okay you know what let there be first um lent I want to land first why didn't God say okay let there be the mass and and all Jupiter first I want those planets first why didn't God said didn't say okay let there be water first God could have done that why so God started by saying in verse three let there be light he is the light you know the song Walking Dead so invest three he says let there be light and there was light and God saw the light the question is what is light maybe let's just take a short description what is exactly what what is light I don't know if this is light this thing I don't know if it's light of course in our human description this is light but I've got some sense to doubt that that is this is a true light system system would why I'm saying this is because look this comes as a result of some science and what we discovered and we connect the wires and we do this okay and we make like but what is the true light nowadays I hear about the end that when they transmit information they use this optic is it fiber fiber wires you know that light travels in those and can transfer information faster and clearer I was reading somewhere they say light is the more light you have the more light comes it's actually the more information you discover the more light you get is the more you the more clearer you see maybe maybe if I bring light more light I'll see things that I was not seeing under this light here because light is so powerful and is so powerful that the more light come you know I always like this sister Naomi's dream she said she was dreaming but I'll just give you a snapshot in that dream the angel of the Lord was coming he forgive me my sister if I'm not I'm paraphrasing if I'm not saying it correctly in that dream when the light of the Lord the angel was coming because she had a burden and the angel she said the closer that light of the of the of the Angel comes closer the clearer she could even see things that she didn't know she could even understand better he didn't need anyone to tell her anything she just understood the clothes that that light came to her the guilty as she this the more sinful and she said no no no because light is so powerful I don't think if this light comes you just bring it here close to me I'll even see him my sins this one yeah yeah that's what I'm saying it's not like but the True Light is Jesus Christ he is the actual True Light he's the light of the and then he says you are the children of the light and I agree with him because everything came out of the light ah everything when he said let there be light you'll see as we go along what happened to that thing someone removed when when he said let there be light and everything came from the light the True Light is the light when when it comes in your life you change yeah when it comes in your life you see you you understand things that other people don't understand that is Jesus Christ himself huh so this is just a maybe this just types the spiritual but it's not it's not the real light yeah have you ever seen a photocopier they know they use light to make a photocopy until they get someone to certify a true copy light just goes and on paper and burn in bed light they use light to do thorough operations you know in a surgery room they use light is so it's so Sarah so precise is light that when they operate you it can cut you know carefully and clear they use it so what what is like then um what is light so light I don't know how to describe it but you'll see as we go along you'll hear what the prophet says now having said that you are the children of the light are we agreeing that we are all children of the light in other words we are the light are we together the issue is this we need to come to the point of getting back to where we used to be from the beginning and that process is called to be born again because you'll see you you you were here right then something happens in the process then you are now here but you need to get back to where you were before that process is called to be born again because you you want to go back to where you were your original state okay you'll follow me now you'll follow me this is now what the prophet explains to us that at the beginning or even before the beginning there was this thing called this great thing not I don't want to say time that was before time it's called eternity you can think of it as a great big circle where there was no time there was no meanness or seconds it was just there so that's why there's no break in that big circle it was just on and on and on I can't even say on and on because on starts somewhere it was just a big circle you can't even say clockwise because clockwise is clockwise is that you know it's time that was eternity it was it's something that you cannot imagine how how really it functioned it was there the Bible says there was nothing only the spirit of God was sitting right but in the process God wanted to think he started to think and then he said okay there are things inside me that I need to bring out yeah when he thought in that process of thinking you came you came he thought about Andy he thought about sister Maggie he thought about brother Jimmy sister Christine's sister Jenny sister Naomi and if I don't call you he also thought about you thought about Jesse he thought about Isaac he thought about sister he thought about everyone he thought about you individually listen he said okay I want to be a savior you know the story then he brought this thing called time and then the only thing about time is that it's just a loop from that big thing that we spoke about it's just a little Loop it has got a start and it's gonna finish you know that much you know time has got started and finish even when we say come at what time we've got a meeting from there to there can't have a meeting forever there's a Time Time started at the beginning when God started and it's gonna have an end that's why we say time shall be no more there shall be no more time can you imagine that no more time whatever we think we know we know we think that little yellow Loop who is that pointer like I like to point in teaching so that now that thing called time we are actually us right now maybe there almost at the end of that Arrow just where it points there because it's finishing right we are there at the very right there where it touches eternity that's why thank you Papa time is blending into eternity we are there you see there from the start it moved and now we are there we are just just two minutes Maybe now he created that as as as he started this process here as he started he said let there be light right I'm not saying that is how the light appeared I just I was just looking for a way to describe or to convey a message he said that let there be light and then there was light a man called gigloo he said light came running 386 out of the mouth of God laughs have you ever watched that video of the Indescribable so fascinating because he practicalize it he made you our little little small mind because what happened is that when when we were brought into time we were brought to the lowest form we were brought to the lowest our grandmother helped the devil to bring us to the lowest the slowest slowest form imagine taking 48 hours to travel from here to South Africa that's too slow and that's why we were brought we were brought to just from from paraparaumu to here I must take one hour or 30 minutes and our cars are trying to go fast and our airplane thing but we are still tours cannot take it we were brought to the slowest now in our initial where we were in the mind of God in eternity things were too fast light travels at a very enormous I believe that the word of God even travels faster so now we God created it and then that was the beginning okay fine then Light Came and then there it is can you see it I'm not saying that's the one but can you can you can you imagine at the beginning when God created and there was light okay and then over the process of time we have been taught and we have seen this light manifesting itself for us weak human beings to see we who are his children trapped in this flesh to see that oh this is actually us over a period of time God has now showed us and have you ever seen any of those pictures have you ever seen God being photographed the prophet says that's not my picture yeah yeah I just happened to be there yeah it's not my it's not his picture that Halo there imagine light just came right this man here Moses this is supposed to be Moses he saw some form of Fire Light but this one was not Ben it was not consuming the tree he saw it and then and then he looked and then he went and he spoke to the light and the light spoke back to him and Paul that light came and struck him can you see Paul he's there can you see him children who can see Paul what can you say look that that can you see that light when he was underground and he asked questions who are thou Lord how can you say to the light how can you talk to the light I can't just talk to this thing now right now listen to what the brother Brandon says there so now the Bible teaches us that the logos went out of God and I might say all all the the god becoming his first body form when the logos went out of God that was the first visible part of God to us to see to be able to say oh that's the light oh that's air that's this that's this and everything came out of that logos now listen to this the next paragraph but then the logos that went out of him became a little logo Halo of light a little Hollow of light let's see it playing Yonder like a child maybe before the doorstep of the father and now I can see him he moves over there and he draws into his his memory he prepares a plan in his mind in his mind and a it draws a picture of what the world should be shipping how the world you are here as part of this world in flesh right he thought about you how your genes are going to be how you're thinking your hair straight and your everything and your emotions he planned everything to the detail to the Iota to the DOT and the planners can you is unfathomable isn't it now and then and then he says and then he said I'm here him I hear him say Let There Be can you see I hear him say Let There Be what light right and and and an atom broke Yonder and when he did the son came into existence and began to Will she bent for millions and millions of years after a while I see a clinker fly off of it what is it the first star that flew from the sun he watches it fall for a few million years and stop this is time now we are now we are here we are now into that area it's time now all together millions of years is called time now let's go there to the next slide Slide the father covered all the space before time the father covered everything right then he covered everything and then and then this God became body bodilized I like English it became bodilized down to the logos it became a body called logos and I can hear him say let there be light and then atom blah blah blah okay I want to jump quickly to the next paragraph then the logos came down and was made flesh [Music] um when did the logos come in was made flesh am I looking at the logos right now or let's say let me make it softer for you am I looking at part of the logos do you believe that you are part of the logos I believe I'm part of the logos now the cruel in the quality of scene that's that's where I took that sermon there now standing back there again Moses seen him who the logos Moses seen him and he saw the hind part of him and said looked like the back of a man the logos that went from God this is so wonderful isn't it and that is who SE children you are you I'm trying to explain to you to remind you to motivate you to refresh you that you are children of the life that's what I'm doing tonight I'll talk about being born again afterwards I'm just trying to refresh your memory that you are the children of the light in case you are starting to forget in case you just you're studying to doubt you are the part of what was there when God created when God said let there be light because you were in Jesus Christ and then he came and he was crucified and the Bible the prophet said that the bride was there with him who's the bride so so they need to come a point having said all these things and the creation you know because what resulted now is that God decided okay I'm gonna make this one called f he he made all those things that came out and everything in the universe and he was looking at measuring it as a mind look at this one let me reduce the speed for this one and then he will say ah you know and he was saying you like his son logos himself the Son of God Jesus Christ was sitting there like maybe a little child William playing with those dinosaurs of his and then then from there he make them talk he make them huh so that's what God that's how the creation was but then he came specifically to this one that one that we are looking at and then he said okay I'm gonna make this special one the planet f and he carefully made it and he made it and designed it everything put all the minerals and everything and then he created Our Father Adam and he put him there as we know creation today of the earth that's what he did there then time went on and on and on and on and here we are today at the end now now we want to go back right because time is getting finished when time is finished what are you gonna do because whether whether you are ready or not time is getting finished look you must be born again in order for you to not I'm talking about uh being born again remember the man called Nicodemus let's read about you Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily you know this word very I went and checked it absolutely absolutely I don't know about the best way to say Brother David seriously seriously all right uh what was another heavy English with brother that is stronger than absolutely which means for for sure I say unto you Nicodemus except a man is born again a human being he cannot see the kingdom of God one what does verse 4 says this one says you cannot see it right seeing to me talks about the Revelation the understanding huh it talks about seeing that you are now being called in the kingdom of God hmm you can't see it if you are not born again verse 4 Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto you accept amen be born again of born except a man be born of water one and of the spirit two he cannot enter into the kingdom of God this is the things that you know brothers and sisters but it seems to me that many times if this is not suitable to you maybe to the young believers maybe to the youth maybe to the young people please just understand just be patient with me maybe one of them can catch it maybe we left them behind at the spot where they only got baptized and they never went there because here he says accept amen be born again with water and the spirit right so it means just being baptized in water alone is not enough are we together and there's no use to be born again in water if you're not going to be born by the spirit they go together right Marvel note that I say unto you must be born again because this is so seriously seriously seriously Nicole you must go tell them except you are born again with water and the spirit now many times people get born up to this up to the water some go maybe a little further and just just allow the touch of the spirit in their soul in their Spirit here just in the spiritual realm and you feel excess and energized and you feel wow I'm A Daughter of Zion hey I'm full of the spirit be born again the personal description here he said and you did it was it brother Ben I can't remember who someone did that I'll give you a new heart to give you a new heart and you know the Bible says out of the heart the mouth speakers we think using our hearts okay I know our minds but the bigger decisions that we make this is the real guy I don't know if they change a heart and they put another heart Dr Chris Barnard and put another heart what happened maybe that's not that hard that the Bible is talking about maybe it's the soul that's what we're talking about perhaps that God gives you a new heart in inside there it gives a new spirit and it will become a new person completely no more just on the periphery on the spirit and you feel oh I love my brothers I love yes and are you born again hmm what is a new bell to be born again is something Way Beyond this Natural Life Way Beyond just reading the Bible and it's true it's important to read the Bible why Beyond just Gathering here together and smiling at each other whether we mean it or not but the issue is is Way Beyond all those things is beyond way way and even applying the scriptures I believe that the new birth is something beyond that even though how well you might mean it I believe something that the new bed is far beyond your good intentions and your thoughts Minds is beyond that and no matter how much that we try to think we are right in saying a Creed or joining a church you will still you are still what you wear until you are actually born again of the spirit of God I'm not trying to to say that you are not born again I'm trying to say that the Pastor said we must take stock the Lord Jesus I hate him the Lord Jesus on Sunday speaking through him that help you let's take stock they ask them are you born again yes have you received the spirit since you you believed then they said No Heaven said oh you haven't because the process is that you must baptize and receive so okay tell me which baptism will you use did you use yeah let's rather start there because two of them it's no need for me to pray for the spirit now because you haven't received it well let's start by grade one yes zero how were you baptized okay do you believe yes how are you baptized uh in the baptism of John back to the water because because if they go together now there's some things got to happen and that's the new bed that new bed is an experience you know there's no University in the whole world or any Academia or Institute or professor who will teach you an experience and there's no one who can come to you Dave and take your experience away yeah hey so therefore and and this experience this experience I'm talking about it's not an experience where you're gonna say you know you know brother India I've got 40 years experience that's not well dude that's that's the way that that has got to do with my skills my abilities my this what what that's I've got an experience it's true but an experience in the Lord have you experienced the new birth since you believe I can hear that yes shakana started in 2011 and everything we are 10 years old now going for 12. have you been born again by the spirit amen now process of the new birth normal natural bed types the spiritual one all things that are natural did I hear correctly brother Ben all things all things of the natural is types of the spiritual all things that means pretty much you can take like they say here in New Zealand I'm like a kid now pretty much pretty much you can take everything that you see here physically and find something in their spiritual that types it pretty much you can do that you can actually because he says all things on the natural that is why always always said put on your spiritual jacket now ah put on your spiritual foreign I'm nothing zero you know that program called zero I don't know why they can say such a useful program of accounting and managing books Isaac they call it zero if they should have just said million to show that but don't look at what when someone is preaching here put on your spiritual jacket when you deal with your brother put on your spiritual jacket when you deal with God's children be very careful be very careful because you are dealing with the children of the light and the light can cut you if you are not careful you are dealing with a dangerous commodity nobody will sell it for you they can do nothing they can only harness and harness it and bring it in solar light but they will never finish it it is the only resource that I know that you can take one candle and light a billion other candle sister terrorism without it being

to this bed there's an approach and and and to be to be to approach this birth you have to go through a process just like anything that lives anything that lives again you've got to die first that's the that's the process that's the point about this new bed sister honey this is the process about this birth that you must die fast wife or cousin I don't want to keep on calling others and then I I never had him calling sisters happy you must die first in order to live are we in agreement are we together brothers and sisters so that's what he says it says that that's the process it doesn't

you are a daughter of light you me and you must come to our real manifestation of who we are and we must die first this site this thing must die yes what must die now he says here you've got to Recon yourself so guilty in the presence of God until because look you were born guilty before you even started to open your little mouth you were already a guilty little baby and then you come to a point the part of that process not that you must always be sitting there feeling guilty you accept the guilt and you accept that Lord Now kill me because you are a One Creation a human being born in sexual desire here on Earth and now you are now a creation born by the spirit when you are born again your thoughts are dead your thoughts oh yes I did there's this thoughts that I don't want to die do you know them these thoughts that don't want to die there are an impediment they are an obstacle towards me reaching my fullest potential of who I am they are maybe just a few more kilometers I'll be there just a few more attempts to to surrender myself before the Lord but the thoughts man they keep on disturbing me this evil thoughts or human thoughts they don't want to die no come come to the sacrifice remember to be born again is to have that extreme laugh and know that we pass from Death unto life we have the abundance of life that and the Abundant Life is that overflowing something that God put into a human being hey my brothers and sisters this is a serious business it's not of whether I'm the one saying it or brother Ben this is a serious deal if you miss this deal the child in finishing the Pastor said to us let's take stock and I agree let's take stock or maybe I should do this first before I read for you can I play this brother Ed do you know if I can play this at first sleep Talia I want to show you and I want to bring you a minister someone special and international minister to hear you know to here listen it's just a clip one minute top one clip number one please listen carefully every weight that he says because he's responsible for you he's responsible he's gonna answer before God that minister sorry brother I I should have warned you first my friend I apologize to the technical team and while they are sorting that out those clips are very short you can open your Bibles to Timothy second Timothy three they're wrapping up with that one huh is it there listen listen carefully just listen to what you say please volume top top notch volume sorry brother just rewind for me please just start again I want you to listen carefully sorry sorry my dear friend is the volume up Ah that's fine but we can hear please open your ears okay let's go and and maybe on Sunday I will preach European I don't know but you know we're gonna die out we're not here just to be wounded you know the Bible says present yourself a Living Sacrifice that means you're going to get fully on the altar not just a hand not just a foot Hallelujah I'm sorry I did this and you know you got to get all on the altar you're going to take all your religious ideas throw it in the bonfire of God's word let it burn out of you that you can walk in fullness of the word of God Amen Hallelujah if I shout too much well you'll get distance and and sorry sorry not just the head do you hear that brothers and sisters the process of dying is your responsibility and a God has got the responsibility to renew you and give you the new okay they knew you but the process of dying you have got to come and lay yourself on the alt fully not just the food that's what he's saying for the new bed to be born again you must die after all everything that lives something died yeah after all so so it's a process let's click the next one thing because I'm done anyway I'm finished and I'm hoping to be on time I just want you to be short and straightforward did you hear that clip carefully do you like it do you like it I I I played it over and over and as I said Lord if I have not fully died is it my me or what Lord bend it kill it listen to that one who appreciate him brother Ben it's not about a man who write God forever and ever amen eons of time until eternity everyone will walk you know all other people walk everyone in the name of his God depression bipolar schizophrenia grudges well my parents did this to me my friends did this to me my culture did this to me you know resentment Pride Envy malice Strife whatever it may be everyone walks in the name of their God but we won't walk in those names I mean because we're not identified by that you know some people are full of Pride we're not identified with that I mean some people are envious and jealous and all those things that's the god that they worship because the thing that affects you most in your everyday life that's your God that's it it's not about coming here twice a week no who's your god from Sunday to Sunday to Sunday to Sunday WHo Hallelujah so there is a reason why the Lord say those things among us God is warning us it may not be you but it may be someone else remember we are a body the entire body must go home you don't want to be the channel of the devil waking and disturbing the bride yeah from reaching his fullest potential there is a reason why these things are mentioned Among Us search me Lord me start with me Lord if you find yourself the word of God preaching and you don't think of yourself you need to die last one final that's the final that's only brother I put you on the spot that was the best I could do to take his copyright I'm just going to make a Quantum Leap from here to the fruits of the spirit companies do a stock tank yeah I told you he's ever had to do a stock take at work you're doing everyday things you're you know your daily schedule that you've been given a either a spreadsheet or a computer a big bit of paper do a stock tank Hallelujah and you're like oh can we just open everything so it's not you know and stop but you can't do that all though anyway you have to do a stock take but a stop take is necessary because you see what inventory you're carrying not what you think you possess what you actually possess and this is very very important because we need to do a stock take once in a while we need to make inventory of our life and see what is in our warehouse our warehouse not a physical Warehouse a warehouse hey man right because you'll have something on this list you could say Amen thank you so much I know you can go home and listen to this but it's always nice to sit together on the table and eat together isn't it that's what I'm trying to do to put put on the table and we eat it together you know you even learn to eat faster you learn the techniques of grabbing the best side of the table because you know Sister Priscilla set up the table and now I'm are you positioning yourself or you go there by Sister Chantel they say big table when you get there you find there's a big table with things on top you need to position yourself because otherwise you might lose the best part so I'm just bringing this to to say brothers not to joke or or laugh or but but just to try to re-emphasize that hey there is a reason why the spirit of God brings these things among us because when you left home you prayed right and you asked God to to come in in his fullness and God came and preached and said these things so we don't want to be like a kid if you take stock take there are things that you find in there that some of them are what you call breakages some of them are things that were someone just opened a packet and steal something and go it's short you can't sell it anymore some of them have expired when it does when you do expect a real stock take and you take this is still in a good condition we are actually going to put the price up this one is an old model we are going to send it back to the supplier ah this one we're just gonna put it under the shelf for clearance it must go with the Devil it must go if they don't want it take it to where they give people things for free go I don't want this one not in my warehouse in my warehouse I want all the products that are Sharp that I have the best models for my client and they don't sell cheap I didn't buy them cheap they came at a big cost price took him the real logos light to to come and wear Flash and die that's a big price man it's not a price for you young people to come here and joke and play and the thing that we are here to play you're making it very difficult for the parents a new parents you're also making it difficult for being soft I'm sorry to say that but we don't want children delinquency we also don't want parental delinquency children according to the Bible yeah because you cannot take the weight of God and that that brings a big question have you been born again yourself because let me tell you you cannot teach me how to drive if you don't know right can you I'm sorry this is I want to allow you to teach me you must show me your license and how many years of experience have you been driving then I said okay okay teach me my girl what do we do what is this again this okay because you have been driving for so long and I've Got Confidence now parents are we dead right come on because if you die you you could means you are a new person then you are able to take this young person and lead him in the process of New Birth because you have been there I'm challenging parents yeah you young people close your ears yours is coming now parents it it is our responsibility God is going to ask you a question when your daughter did this what did you do I'm checking my file of stock I don't see a record of your prayers here did I say don't come in and pray to me for your daughter when your son did this and this and you knew about it what did you do oh Lord I prayed how many times once and oh Lord help me Lord help my son and you think God is God is a serious God yeah he everything that God does he's serious yes he's a wonderful God but every God does not do certain things joking no everything that God does is serious about it and he means business everything we've got time to joke and so I'm sorry until the Bible correct us and say hey even when you talk watch your language evil communication brings what so we must not be mixed up with the world and people can confuse us it must be very clear I'm finished let us forgive me if I've heard you but the key is about being born again okay I'm finished now if it's okay can I read the second Timothy you know it if I don't read it promise me that you'll go read it at home I don't want to put you on a spot but because of time will you just go home and reread second Timothy chapter he says perilous times are going to come brothers and sisters you know what is the meaning of the word perilous evil and he says in those perilous times which is now you're going to find men who are reprobates you know what is they reprobate like a vagabond someone who a mule is you can't change a mule we are living and on a daily basis with those Spirits here that means we've got to be very careful we've got to take ourselves when it comes to our life our new birth everything must be serious that's 10 brothers and sisters may the Lord bless you are everything that I've told you I know you know it it's just a refresher to say let's go and and check because we are not cheap children we have been purchased with a higher price we have been patches with a very expensive price therefore you have to know who you are if you don't understand who you are ask God to give you the revelation of the magnitude of Who You Are so that you can know yourself and approach yourself and your lord accordingly are we together please go home and read second Timothy for me or for the Lord and said Lord when you read all those dangerous things say Lord don't remove if this is near me not even in me next to me if it's in my family my friend my whoever next to me remove it I don't want to come across those spirits of reprobates read it is scary let's not just say our stock is all right don't worry about stock our stock we buy quality only don't we don't need a stock tank you need a stock take and you need it regularly can the musicians come please and then we will sing a song tell us all that I wanted to share with you about you Children of the light ah you have been bored with a great price First Once you come to that realization of Who You Are then you go through that process and if you're already there it's okay just take stock and help the next person who is not there yet into thy presence we come you know the song not by the wax we have done by this and I Grace our Lord into that okay let's let's take it one kilo into thy presence we come that's the one oh not by the word we have done [Music] but by the grace thy Gray [Music] into the presence we come maybe there's a different tune that you sing it here locally maybe huh no okay we'll lend it some other time we've got thousands of worshiping songs let's sing a the one that says this is your house Lord come into hell right you know that one this is your heart to be happy for that is thank you lead us you know Back Where I Come From sisters in the floor hold mics to lead us and to sing because quite often we ministers don't know how to sing very few ministers like brother Isaac you know can Minister and sing at the same time but many of us we don't know what is it let's go my sister you know assistant this is your heart oh this is yours you know it honey [Music] just lose our eyes [Music] oh [Music] [Music] this is I realize that I give the songs that we're going to know here but this is a powerful and wonderful song that you can just be in the spirit and be reverent and then we're going to pray um and I don't know brother Ben if there was any prayer requests that were given it was not a primary oh I mean I should have won at least one other 50 minutes okay that's thank you for the India let's just sing um I'm no longer I'm no longer [Music] I am a child of God [Music] honestly [Music] [Music] use [Music] all Deliverance oh my enemy [Music] will be who I am I am a child oh I'm no longer I am [Music] who I am from eternity [Music] oh my name I've been born again [Music] [Music] [Music] oh you are no longer [Music] Hallelujah just for a second just for one quick second if it's okay my wife just want to give you a quick testimony if it's all right and then then we can close the prayer and we can go home is that acceptable so I'm not just allowing here because [Music] the mic I mean maybe we can just sit for a little bit [Music] God bless you and as I was sitting there I wasn't too sure whether I should share this testimony or not but I just kept on feeling the bed and that says maybe it can encourage someone so if we go back to 2021 May the 30th you'll remember that I was at the back there I tried picking up a baby and then somehow something happened to my back I don't know what happened I cannot explain it to this day but it took about three months for the pain to be normalized in about six months for me to get to a full healing so yesterday in the morning when I tried waking up I opened my eyes I realized that I cannot move I couldn't stand up from the bed and at that point in time my husband had an appointment with Sister Barbara early in the morning so he was gone already I'm alone in the room and there is nothing that I can do [Music] I Only Could rely on trying to remember all the techniques that I was taught when I was at the hospital as to how you can manage to roll in order to come out of bed I rolled out I stood next to the bed but it took me about an hour to manage to roll out of the bed and then I stood I cannot walk there is nothing I can do then the devil will then bring the fear then I'm thinking is this going to take three months again to get healed is this pain going to take again six to seven months for me to be normal again I could not accept it I said Lord I'm not going to allow this pain to control me [Music] don't know what she got it but there is no way I'm even going to take seat leaf [Music] I stayed in bed for some time until my husband came back from the from Starbucks clinic and then I explained to him then I asked him to pray with me then he he was already late for work I knew that while he's busy working he'll continue with with praying then I eventually managed to get out of bed I prepared myself I found the kids already busy schooling I told them if you're busy with your school can you please pray for me I'm not well at all but I decided I'm not taking sick leave I'm not going to allow this to control because if I knew I triggered it I would at least zoom on to the problem and deal with it then I went and continued working I didn't even tell my manager anything only when I was about to log off I said to her I've had this issue I'll monitor it tomorrow if there's any more problems I'll let you know but for now I'm not taking any leave I'm continuing then I kept on praying about it I was struggling I went to sleep again it was even more painful than in the morning but I told little that you're not continue playing as well I'm not going to let this control me then the last thing when I went to sleep I was busy thinking Lord you are a miracle working God I believe you can help me then I went to sleep this morning when I woke up I thought I was dreaming because there was not a single pain and then I got out of bed I tried walking I realized I can walk I walked back I realized I can walk my husband slept late because he was busy preaching but at that time I couldn't say Let Me Wait for him to wake up I said to him a miracle has happened I've been healed I can walk again and then I just couldn't hold it in me I just had to share this testimony that God is still a miracle working God just just hold on to his promises whatever you're going through he will come through for you [Applause] [Music] the devil is a liar brothers and sisters he's a liar and a father of Lies amen let's just stand we're going to pray now and then we're going to go home amen I was supposed to finish at 22. I I am failing to manage time pray for me if there's a need in your heart before God you see this you hear this song have no fear you are no longer a Slave fear is I'm going to pray for you as we close the service in prayer but I know that I know that I know that God has already given you your request [Music] lifted up by faith your hand let's Close Our Eyes let's be reverent don't look to the sight or the right or the left just be reverent before God and lift up even if even if it's in your heart God can see it our heavenly father Lord Jesus Christ we we want to come before you reverently Lord Lord we we don't have the best ways father to express it but Lord we want to tell you that you are awesome you are wonderful you are beautiful you are good Lord you are a you are a wonderful god father and we appreciate what we have done for us Lord what we have done for us Lord no one will ever could have done it for us but you Lord and we love you for that father we appreciate you for choosing us father we thank you for the service tonight Lord father God if there's anything that I've said that is amiss you are the great teacher Lord you go father God please and straighten it up in the house of your children and let us move forward in this war getting towards the mark of the High Calling God in getting towards the Finish Line together in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ my father my god there are needs Among Us hands are raised Lord mine is up to because Lord if there's anything that still need to die in my life I need you to kill it completely so that I can be fully fully dead and alive in you and my father my God I pray for my dear brothers and sisters yellow each one of us have got a journey that we have chosen there's a root and a plan towards achieving our Redemption towards achieving our full potential there's a route that you have set for each one I pray that father God you prepare us and run us through that route according to your perfect plan take your children back home safely Lord may you provide for them their needs provide for them Lord their requests they are lifting hands because they are putting them in your hands they leave them there for you to provide some of them are not here tonight Lord maybe they are you chooping bless them too Lord provide for them Lord Jesus Christ bless them wherever they are Lord God let the the point where they are sitting also be filled with their spirit of the Living God blessed father God our children our young people as we see the times are getting more perilous and Lord maybe one day when there are mothers and fathers maybe we won't be there if the lotteries but father we pray that the Holy Spirit can prepare them now for that time prepare them now Lord to set up the foundation for the young little girls and boys for the time to come if you Terry my Lord we don't want them to prepare when they are already in marriage we don't want them to prepare Lord when they are already facing a problem want them to prepare now lay a foundation solid one for them and help the parents too Lord I am one of the parents Lord help us father to come with you Lord in your presence so that we can be able to lead with your spirits that's my desire tonight we commit the service of the Lord into your hands we say father God may you just keep it until we come to meet again on Sunday Lord if you Terry bless our pastor and his wife and the family bless our deacons Lord bless all our office bearers father God bless our Sunday school teachers make us a body that pleases you and Oasis in the desert we thank you my Lord and we commit the service back into your hands by faith now with Thanksgiving in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen amen now now brother we need a homegoing song fast is everybody happy for the indices I must teach you which one do you want brother okay I thought he was saying oh brighten the corner oh where you are brighten the corner where you are my brother brighten the corner where you are brighten the corner where my sister brighten the corner where are you that's all right where you are bright and the corner where you are up right in the corner my sister [Music] [Music] that's all that's all the song is about wherever you you are tomorrow and now when you go brighten that corner with the presence of the Lord I think we are dismissed every other David but we can just finish it off as we go home yeah and it's a bright tender we are dismissed [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] all right [Music] here [Music] come on [Music] is over are you good bye [Music] foreign [Music] Fly Away [Music]
