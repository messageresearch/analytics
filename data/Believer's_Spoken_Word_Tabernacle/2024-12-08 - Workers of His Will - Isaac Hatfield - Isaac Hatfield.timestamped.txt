[36:35] if you have your Bibles this morning and
[36:38] we'll go straight to the word thank you
[36:39] musicians we want to turn to the Book of
[36:42] Matthew chapter
[36:44] 7 and then uh we just want to say thank
[36:48] you to each one of you have prayed for
[36:49] our family and my wife and uh the Lord's
[36:53] done such a work and she's doing much
[36:55] much better and then we wasn't able to
[36:58] bring him today but doing much better
[37:00] and we just want to say thank you for
[37:02] all the prayers and all the thoughts
[37:04] amen we just have a little thought this
[37:06] morning out of Matthew 7 and we want to
[37:08] start in the 18th
[37:10] verse uh down to the
[37:14] 29th and it says a good tree cannot
[37:17] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[37:20] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
[37:23] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[37:25] fruit is heed down and cast into the the
[37:27] fire wherefore by their fruits you shall
[37:30] know them and not everyone that saith
[37:33] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[37:35] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[37:39] will of My Father which is in heaven and
[37:43] many will say to me in that day Lord
[37:45] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[37:48] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[37:50] in thy name done many wonderful works
[37:52] and then I will profess unto them I
[37:55] never knew you depart from me ye that
[37:57] work iniquity therefore whosoever
[38:00] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[38:02] them I will liken him onto a wise man
[38:05] which built his house upon a rock and
[38:08] the rain descended and the floods came
[38:10] and the winds blew and beat upon that
[38:12] house and it fell not for it was founded
[38:14] upon a rock prise God and everyone that
[38:16] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[38:19] them not shall be likened unto a foolish
[38:21] man which built his house upon the sand
[38:23] and the rain descended and the floods
[38:25] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[38:27] that house and it fell and great was the
[38:29] fall of it and it came to pass when
[38:31] Jesus had ended these sayings the people
[38:33] were astonished at his Doctrine for he
[38:36] taught them as one having Authority and
[38:39] not as the scribes amen you may have
[38:41] your seats this morning may God bless
[38:44] the reading of the word and we just want
[38:45] to take a little thought out of that
[38:47] passage on workers of his will workers
[38:51] of his will and and just to take a few
[38:55] things amen not to hold you long this
[38:57] morning morning but some things that
[38:58] have been speaking to my heart out out
[39:00] of this area of Matthew 7 and and and to
[39:03] see these two classes of people that
[39:06] would come on that day and he said not
[39:08] everyone that saith Lord Lord but it's
[39:10] he that doeth the will of my father and
[39:13] there would be a people that would come
[39:14] and that would come under a rebuke that
[39:17] he said I never knew you depart from me
[39:19] ye that work iniquity and so we want to
[39:22] um be careful to mention that throughout
[39:24] the whole Bible we realize that there's
[39:26] two classes amen and you can see it here
[39:28] in Matthew 7 that he talks about a good
[39:31] tree and a corrupt tree amen and you can
[39:33] see he talks about you know a false Vine
[39:35] and a True Vine or a wise man and a
[39:38] foolish man or you know a wise virgin
[39:41] and a foolish virgin and you see it all
[39:43] throughout uh scripture and here uh that
[39:46] there would be two classes and one that
[39:48] doeth the will of the father and one
[39:49] that would be a worker of iniquity and
[39:51] and in Matthew 25 it also talks about
[39:54] how there would be a separation like a a
[39:56] shepherd separ Ates his sheep from his
[39:58] goats amen that on that day you know
[40:00] there'd be a separation the sheep from
[40:02] the goats or or maybe you're familiar
[40:04] with the wheat from the tears that there
[40:06] would be a separation that that that one
[40:08] would be gathered to be burned and one
[40:10] would be gathered into the barn of the
[40:12] farmer so we realize that maybe
[40:15] sometimes these these Spirits manifests
[40:18] in different ways but we want to bring
[40:20] it down to those two the two seeds those
[40:23] two Vines amen that that go throughout
[40:26] the whole word but the one we want to
[40:28] talk about first is that class of
[40:29] workers of iniquity and he would say
[40:32] many would come and he would say I never
[40:33] knew you depart from me ye that work
[40:35] iniquity and I think my uh what would it
[40:38] be like to to to to try to serve the
[40:40] Lord and to try to work for the Lord
[40:42] your whole life and spend a whole life
[40:45] amen trying to Labor uh uh um so to
[40:47] speak for the Lord and then on that day
[40:49] you would hear rebuke depart from me ye
[40:52] that work iniquity and brother Brandon
[40:53] would begin to tell us of course that
[40:55] that's where the disappointment will be
[40:57] you know it it won't be the drunkard or
[40:59] The Bootlegger or The Prostitute that
[41:01] will be disappointed on that day but it
[41:03] it'll be the multitudes that would fall
[41:05] under that religious spirit to think
[41:08] that I've got a right to be here because
[41:10] of my works and because I did this and
[41:12] because I did that amen and that very
[41:16] few would be saved and so brother
[41:17] brandom's telling us that you just be
[41:19] one of them because in Matthew 7 it also
[41:21] tells us that it would be a Straight
[41:23] Gate and a narrow way that would lead on
[41:26] to life and few there would that would
[41:27] find it and me and brother brandham
[41:30] tells a dream that his mother had that
[41:33] brother brandham was standing besides
[41:34] this highway and there was three steps
[41:36] that led up to the highway and and
[41:38] brother Brandon thought how beautifully
[41:40] that represented his ministry of the
[41:42] three steps of justification
[41:44] sanctification and the baptism of the
[41:46] Holy Ghost and there come a woman that
[41:48] was going to try to get on this highway
[41:50] but she was wearing high heeled shoes
[41:52] and brother Brandon begins to tell her
[41:54] sister you can't walk this highway like
[41:56] that and so she would try to get on the
[41:59] highway and walk the highway but as it
[42:01] got narrower and narrower she would
[42:03] begin to to fall off and and his mother
[42:06] described the horrible screams and
[42:08] things because because she was trying to
[42:10] walk the highway the narrow way without
[42:12] keeping every word of God she may have
[42:15] been obedient to every word except for
[42:17] one but this narrow way that the
[42:19] Christian walks and mean it requires an
[42:22] obedience to the word of God and mean it
[42:24] requires an adherence to the word of God
[42:27] BR Amen to walk this narrow way that
[42:29] leadth onto life amen that's the age
[42:32] that we're living amen amen as that
[42:33] Capstone begins to come closer and
[42:35] closer it becomes as brother Brandon
[42:37] would call it a honed age amen it's a
[42:41] narrow way amen but but the believer can
[42:43] walk in that way amen and so he would
[42:46] say it's a straight gate in a narrow way
[42:49] and that there would become come some
[42:51] that would come on that day and they
[42:53] would say I've done this and I've done
[42:55] that but brother Brandon would say that
[42:58] he said he said now these people claim
[43:00] they done it but they did not do it
[43:02] because that's right for he said I never
[43:04] knew you they just claimed they had done
[43:06] it he said like somebody going down to
[43:08] the bank and saying I you know I wrote a
[43:11] check out of your bank brother brandom
[43:13] and brother Brandon say I checked the
[43:14] bank it's not true you said you did it
[43:17] but you didn't actually do it and here
[43:19] they were claiming that they had done
[43:21] all these great things amen but it
[43:23] showed that there was something missing
[43:24] because he said I never knew you some
[43:26] something something's wrong somewhere
[43:28] along the line amen you you you were
[43:31] impersonating maybe something am mean
[43:33] but you weren't actually doing it amen
[43:36] and it shows uh in this age Amen brother
[43:39] Aaron uh many times you see if you look
[43:42] into uh sometimes you see people trying
[43:44] to get views I mean everyone nowadays is
[43:47] trying to do social media and and do
[43:49] anything to get views and attract
[43:51] attention so they'll go into restaurants
[43:53] and they'll pretend like they work there
[43:55] and they'll pretend like you know it's
[43:57] just another day on the job and and try
[43:59] to work until someone discovers that
[44:01] they don't actually work there and and
[44:04] they'll they'll try to impersonate
[44:05] police officers you you'll see videos
[44:07] about howy they they find somebody in a
[44:09] police car and they realize that they're
[44:10] not a they're not a police officer at
[44:12] all me but but it's an
[44:15] impersonation and and they could spend
[44:16] their whole day working at Wendy's or
[44:18] they could spend their whole day trying
[44:20] to pull people over but at the end of
[44:22] the day uh they'll come and and and they
[44:24] won't get a paycheck for that because
[44:26] they were in impersonating that they
[44:28] they weren't right to begin with they
[44:30] they they had on the the uh maybe the
[44:33] uniform and the badge but but they
[44:34] didn't have they were never hired they
[44:36] didn't come the provided way because
[44:39] they started wrong amen and that's the
[44:41] that's the thing that we don't want to
[44:43] Misses we don't want to start wrong
[44:44] because brother brand said you know you
[44:46] can go down to the 10- cent store and
[44:48] get a uniform and a badge and put it on
[44:50] and try pretend like you're in in the
[44:52] Army but but unless you have the the
[44:55] papers am mean to prove that you have
[44:58] the confirmation and mean then the
[45:00] uniform won't do you no good and a badge
[45:02] won't do you no good but you got to get
[45:04] the confirmation of the commission amen
[45:07] and that's what the believer has to do
[45:08] today you got to get your papers amen
[45:11] there in the first coming when Jesus
[45:13] come back on the day of Pentecost amen
[45:15] he was telling them he was commissioning
[45:17] them before he ever left the Earth amen
[45:20] that that they would go into all the
[45:21] world and preach the gospel and they
[45:23] would lay their hands on the sick and
[45:24] they shall be healed amen but before
[45:27] they were to go they were to go up to
[45:28] Pentecost and receive the confirmation
[45:31] of the commission and get the Holy Ghost
[45:33] that would that would that would lead
[45:34] them and guide them and amen and anoint
[45:37] them to do what they were commissioned
[45:38] to do and that's what the believer has
[45:40] to do this morning me is get the
[45:42] confirmation I mean you don't want to
[45:43] start wrong amen you want to come God's
[45:46] provided
[45:47] way amen for for brother Brandon would
[45:49] tell us you know if you jerk a gun amen
[45:52] just a thousandth of an inch Amen
[45:53] brother Aaron at 100 yards that's going
[45:55] to it's going to get farther off and
[45:57] farther off the longer that bullet
[45:59] travels and so that's why you want to be
[46:01] on the mark am me we read in Matthew 7
[46:04] about the wise man and the foolish man
[46:06] amen they both built a house is that
[46:08] right brother Paul they both built a
[46:10] house but the problem was the foolish
[46:13] man didn't start right he started on the
[46:15] wrong foundation and he built it upon
[46:17] the sand am mean he did just as much
[46:19] work am mean but at the end of the road
[46:22] amen he didn't have anything to show for
[46:24] it because he didn't start on the right
[46:26] foundation
[46:27] amen and that's why it's so important to
[46:29] start on the right foundation to get
[46:31] started right Amen to come God's
[46:34] provided way amen and get your life
[46:36] established on the right foundation
[46:39] because if you take an apple tree and
[46:41] you plant it in good ground it will
[46:43] produce apples amen and if you see
[46:45] somebody that desires to see a living
[46:47] God and somebody that that wants to see
[46:49] if this message is real and there's a
[46:51] desire in their heart and if you plant
[46:54] them upon the right foundation then they
[46:56] have the ability to grow and produce
[46:58] what the word said they could produce
[47:00] amen but if you just plan them off in
[47:03] the wrong condition amen that then it
[47:06] takes away the Life Source for them to
[47:08] be able to thrive and be what God said
[47:11] they could
[47:12] be and that's how many of these started
[47:15] brother brand say how these workers of
[47:16] iniquity maybe they they got off in a
[47:18] little fleshly idea amen and how many
[47:21] first of all how many believers do we
[47:23] have here this
[47:24] morning amen so this category doesn't
[47:27] apply to you so just bear with me for a
[47:29] minute okay just just help me out we're
[47:31] going to get to your portion here in a
[47:33] minute amen but this is this is the the
[47:35] workers of iniquity okay so they started
[47:37] wrong maybe thinking that they could
[47:39] just earn a meal ticket and go and
[47:41] preach the gospel maybe thinking that
[47:43] they they just come under an emotion or
[47:45] some sort of a a Personal Agenda and
[47:48] they went out under that kind of
[47:50] inspiration amen but but the but what is
[47:52] Iniquity iniquity is to know to do
[47:54] something brother Shane and not to do it
[47:57] am mean and so here they are it's not
[47:59] that they didn't know right but they
[48:00] just weren't willing to do it mean and
[48:03] brother BR would tell us that every man
[48:04] knows that he ought to be born again
[48:06] every man knows that he needs to get the
[48:08] Holy Ghost but the problem is they would
[48:10] begin uh to put a shame upon the true
[48:13] gospel and make fun of the true
[48:15] experience of God and so because of
[48:17] their because of their image or because
[48:19] of politics amen people would begin to
[48:22] begin to shy away from the true word of
[48:24] God am mean because it didn't match
[48:26] their denomination taught or it didn't
[48:28] match the the the the what they had for
[48:31] their lives am mean maybe they wanted to
[48:33] climb in the denomination become a great
[48:35] preacher or Pope and they couldn't do it
[48:37] if they adhered to the word of God so
[48:40] instead knowing better they would
[48:42] instead choose to go a different way
[48:45] amen instead of just adhering to the
[48:47] word of God and that's the mistake and
[48:50] that was Israel's mistake am me brother
[48:52] Dave in the wilderness because what was
[48:54] the problem was when they stopped
[48:56] marching according to the word of God
[48:59] that's when they started wandering amen
[49:01] and when the Christian stops marching in
[49:03] line with the word that's when they
[49:05] start wondering maybe this is right
[49:07] maybe that's right and they begin to get
[49:09] their eyes on other things and if you're
[49:11] not careful you'll wander in the
[49:12] wilderness for years and years amen but
[49:15] you should just stay in line with the
[49:17] word and if you just keep marching in
[49:19] line with the word it'll take you where
[49:22] you need to go with God Amen you can
[49:23] March through justification you can
[49:26] March through the Wilderness but you're
[49:27] not meant to stay there you want to keep
[49:29] marching all the way to the promised
[49:31] land and that was what that that was
[49:33] where Israel made their mistake because
[49:36] it's not them brother Brandon would say
[49:38] not all that say Lord Lord but the one
[49:40] that doeth the will of my father not he
[49:42] that starts it's he that finishes
[49:44] there's no shortcuts you're disqualified
[49:47] at the end of the race no shortcuts you
[49:49] must come just the way the scripture
[49:51] said amen and and that's the overcoming
[49:54] class that's the ones that's going to be
[49:56] the finished
[49:57] amen not just to start right but you got
[49:59] to start right amen but you also want to
[50:01] finish right amen so all the while amen
[50:04] you just want to keep your eyes on the
[50:06] end of the road and keep walking with
[50:08] this word amen this Christian walk amen
[50:10] it's like that boy riding the bicycle I
[50:13] mean he he didn't look to the left or to
[50:14] the right he just looked to the end of
[50:16] the road and it took him where he needed
[50:18] to go amen but brother Brandon would
[50:21] talk about uh uh in 1 Corinthians 10
[50:23] it's talking about here these children
[50:25] of Israel and it's says moreover
[50:27] Brethren I would not that you should be
[50:29] ignorant how that all our fathers were
[50:32] under the cloud and all passed through
[50:34] the sea and were all baptized onto Moses
[50:37] in the cloud and in the sea and did all
[50:39] eat the same spiritual meat and did all
[50:42] drink the same spiritual drink for they
[50:44] drank of that spiritual rock that
[50:46] followed them and that rock was Christ
[50:48] but with many of them God was not well
[50:50] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[50:53] wilderness and brother Brandon would
[50:55] begin to say he permitted it but but he
[50:56] wasn't pleased with them you know here
[50:58] they were in the wilderness God was
[51:00] feeding them Mana God was taking care of
[51:02] them but they begin to complain they
[51:04] begin to look back to the garlic of
[51:07] Egypt they they said maybe we should
[51:09] have never left maybe maybe we should
[51:11] have just stayed where we were life
[51:13] wasn't so bad in Egypt after all and
[51:15] they begin to murmur and complain and
[51:18] God permitted them to partake of these
[51:20] wonderful Supernatural things but he
[51:22] wasn't pleased with them and they were
[51:24] overthrown in the wilderness and and
[51:26] brother Brandon begins to preach this in
[51:28] Corinthians book of correction that that
[51:30] that we want to check up we want to make
[51:32] sure we're right though we've partaken
[51:34] of the blessings though maybe some even
[51:36] sat in the meetings of the prophet and
[51:39] and God permits wonderful things but you
[51:41] want to make sure that your life is
[51:42] lining up with the word of God Amen for
[51:45] we're at the time of battle and we don't
[51:46] want to be overthrown at the time of
[51:49] battle but it's a checking up time Amen
[51:51] to make sure your life is is lining up
[51:54] with every word of God that that that we
[51:56] want to go on with the word and mean we
[51:58] don't just want to go on with the word
[52:00] and then stake down our tents and say
[52:02] Lord You've you've done so much for me
[52:04] I'm happy right here but you want to you
[52:06] only want to stick down your tents
[52:08] enough that the next day when the pillar
[52:10] of fire moves on you can move with it
[52:12] anden you don't want to get so so so
[52:14] pinned down in your Christian experience
[52:16] amen that as God begins to reveal his
[52:18] word to you that you can't allow it to
[52:20] change you and transform you amen amen
[52:23] like like how a new wine must get in the
[52:26] flexible skin amen and the key to
[52:29] Revival brother Brandon would tell us is
[52:31] flexibility Amen to have enough
[52:33] flexibility in your Christian walk amen
[52:35] that that you can be corrected and you
[52:37] can be changed and you can allow the
[52:39] word to begin to dig out things in your
[52:41] life that don't belong there and call
[52:43] you into higher places amen amen that
[52:46] that that you don't put a period upon
[52:48] your understanding but you just put a
[52:50] comma and and and brother DAV it's not
[52:52] that the message is going to change
[52:54] because it's the word of God Amen but
[52:56] your understanding as you begin to grow
[52:58] in the revelation of the word you may
[53:00] see something that you may have thought
[53:02] something was a certain way and then
[53:04] years later you realize it wasn't just
[53:06] exactly that way amen and sometimes you
[53:08] have to have the humility to admit I was
[53:11] wrong and the Word was right and Lord
[53:13] I'm willing to change my ways to walk in
[53:16] the revealed word for my day amen but
[53:19] but here these these children of Israel
[53:21] come up to the borderline in Hebrews 6
[53:24] says it is impossible for those who were
[53:27] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[53:29] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[53:31] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[53:34] word of God and the powers of the world
[53:36] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[53:39] them again unto repentance sing then
[53:40] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[53:42] aresh and put him to an open shame and
[53:46] then Hebrews 10:26 for if we sin
[53:48] willfully after that we have receive the
[53:51] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[53:52] no more sacrifice for sins and here
[53:56] brother Brandon would begin to explain
[53:58] this and there's a powerful quote and I
[54:00] believe it's question and answers on the
[54:01] Holy Ghost about this Hebrews 6 anden
[54:04] but but basically amen this doesn't
[54:06] belong to the believer this doesn't
[54:09] apply to the the the born- again
[54:10] believer this is this is speaking of a
[54:12] borderline believer this is speaking of
[54:15] somebody that come up right to the
[54:16] border and they partook of the Holy
[54:19] Ghost as it fell upon them they maybe
[54:21] even experienced the anointing and they
[54:25] tasted of the good work word of God and
[54:27] and mean they come so close to it that
[54:29] they tasted of it brother Shane but but
[54:31] they didn't receive it amen but they
[54:33] weren't willing to walk in it as brother
[54:35] Brandon would say about you know how
[54:37] many preachers would sit in their
[54:38] studies and prepare for their sermons
[54:40] and run across scriptural truth that
[54:43] would rebuke their congregation but but
[54:45] they weren't willing and they didn't
[54:46] have the courage to stand out against it
[54:49] and mean he even would say that the sins
[54:51] of Sodom vexed lot's righteous soul but
[54:54] he wasn't willing to call out against it
[54:56] amen and here he's showing that amen
[54:58] there would be some and brother Brandon
[55:00] preaches a message one time called God
[55:02] had explained and and there had been a
[55:05] bunch of ministers that had set a trap
[55:07] for him and were trying to pin him on
[55:09] his Doctrine and things but the Lord
[55:10] showed him what was going to happen so
[55:12] he goes down there and he preaches God
[55:14] had explained and he had ministers come
[55:16] up to him and say that that was the best
[55:18] thing I've ever heard and and there was
[55:21] we we've got 50 or 70 ministers that
[55:23] want to come down and get re-baptized
[55:25] and brother brand would say how many of
[55:27] them showed up not a one of them amen
[55:29] because God in his grace and mercy would
[55:32] reveal a path that they could walk in am
[55:34] me but because of their denominations
[55:36] and their Creeds a mean they wouldn't
[55:38] show up and walk in the word of God am
[55:40] mean and Jude would tell us that there
[55:42] would be men of old for for ordained to
[55:45] this condemnation am mean turning the
[55:47] grace of God into lishness am mean and
[55:50] brother BR say what is lishness it's to
[55:52] know truth but refuse to walk in it amen
[55:55] God and his grace would bring a message
[55:58] to this generation am me but ministers
[56:00] would refuse to to walk in it amen
[56:03] because it didn't fit the mold of their
[56:06] church or their system oh my but but but
[56:10] but that's why the Christian walk am
[56:12] mean it matters what side of the Border
[56:14] you're on am mean there is a group of
[56:17] borderline Believers that refuse to
[56:19] cross over I mean there is a place you
[56:21] can come in the Christian walk that if
[56:23] you're not careful you'll have just
[56:25] enough religion to make you miserable
[56:27] and you're just enough religion to try
[56:29] to avoid going to hell and mean and
[56:32] that's a miserable place to be amen but
[56:35] if you just cross over that line just
[56:37] that little border right there just move
[56:39] from one side to another am me you'll
[56:41] enter into a world like you never knew
[56:43] am me you'll still have bitles there's
[56:46] still Giants in that land amen but
[56:48] you're fighting it's your land it
[56:49] belongs to you amen and it becomes a joy
[56:52] to serve the Lord it becomes a reality
[56:55] that you are called of God and mean that
[56:58] you belong in this land that God's
[56:59] placed you in this land and you have a
[57:01] right you're a Son of God and the
[57:03] daughter of God Amen and God has
[57:06] predestinated you to be a part of it
[57:08] amen we don't want to live on the other
[57:10] side of the Border Amen on that side of
[57:13] the Border maybe you could fall away but
[57:15] on this side amen you're sealed under
[57:17] the day of your Redemption Amen on that
[57:19] side you look at you look at us bunch of
[57:22] people and call us a bunch of holy
[57:23] rollers and Fanatics and brandom mites
[57:25] but if you ever cross that Veil you
[57:27] won't do that no more but you'll say I'm
[57:30] one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad
[57:32] that I can say I'm one of them and I am
[57:35] glad to be called a heretic amen for the
[57:37] Lord I'm glad to be a fanatic if it
[57:40] means I'm a fanatic for the Lord amen
[57:43] but outside of that Veil they can't see
[57:45] it their eyes are blinded but cross over
[57:47] that Veil one time oh and it'll become a
[57:51] reality this word will become uh uh
[57:54] something great to you something
[57:55] something beyond what you could ever
[57:57] understand in your
[57:59] intellectual abilities on the other side
[58:01] of that border am mean and if you are on
[58:04] the other side of that border it doesn't
[58:06] mean you're a worker of iniquity it just
[58:08] means you need to cross over amen cross
[58:10] over amen where the man is always fresh
[58:14] am mean where the there's honey and
[58:15] there's wine and there's grapes amen oh
[58:18] and it's a beautiful land amen but
[58:21] outside of that land there would be some
[58:24] second Timothy would tell us that would
[58:25] have a form of godliness but would deny
[58:28] the power thereof just as fundament just
[58:32] as fundamental brother Brandon would say
[58:34] maybe just as correct in their teaching
[58:37] amen and they maybe teach the second
[58:39] coming and they teach this and they
[58:41] teach that amen but but but as a form of
[58:45] godliness they might be very religious
[58:48] amen and go to church and be preachers
[58:50] even amen but they deny the power
[58:52] thereof amen putting their own
[58:54] interpretation to the word
[58:56] amen and refusing amen the power of the
[58:59] word amen amen and and and sometimes I I
[59:03] think maybe even as young people or
[59:06] around this message if you're not
[59:07] careful sometimes you look out at at
[59:10] maybe even denominations and and you see
[59:12] that they teach things that you believe
[59:15] and sometimes you think well what really
[59:17] makes us different than them they
[59:19] believe in the second coming Amen in the
[59:21] hour that we're living in in the
[59:23] condition of the world amen amen almost
[59:25] every Al Christian is looking for the
[59:27] coming of the Lord because they
[59:29] recognize the hour and me say what what
[59:31] really makes us different from them but
[59:33] although they might have a form of
[59:35] godliness amen and many of them deny the
[59:37] power thereof amen and that Veil is what
[59:40] separates you from the world it's that
[59:43] power that makes us different than the
[59:45] rest of the world am mean that power to
[59:47] come into the building and change hearts
[59:49] and lives am mean the reality of this
[59:51] word not just a dead letter but the
[59:53] person of the word Jesus Christ to be
[59:56] welcome in our midst and we don't deny
[59:58] the power thereof brother Dave we
[1:00:00] welcome the power thereof because we've
[1:00:02] entered behind the veil and we've come
[1:00:04] into a relationship with the power and
[1:00:07] it's the power of the word it's Jesus
[1:00:09] Christ that comes into our midst amen
[1:00:11] and comes on Thursday nights and Sunday
[1:00:14] mornings it begins to speak to your
[1:00:16] heart because the word is still a
[1:00:18] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:00:20] the heart amen that's what makes us
[1:00:22] different we have the power of the Holy
[1:00:24] Ghost amen the Risen savior has come
[1:00:27] amongst us am mean the the Le toan world
[1:00:31] has blocked him out he's standing
[1:00:32] knocking at the door but they don't let
[1:00:34] him in but the bride has let him in and
[1:00:37] said come in and commune with me come in
[1:00:39] Lord I want to have fellowship with the
[1:00:42] power of this word Lord I don't want
[1:00:44] anything in me that's contrary to you
[1:00:46] and I know it'll take more than the
[1:00:48] Creed to take it out am mean but the
[1:00:50] power thereof I mean it doesn't take a
[1:00:53] 10-step program to fix a life but the
[1:00:56] power thereof can change it in a moment
[1:00:58] in the twinkling of an eye it can it can
[1:01:01] convert a soul and mean it can take drug
[1:01:03] addiction out of your life it can take
[1:01:05] pornography out of your life it can give
[1:01:07] you an overcoming power oh but you've
[1:01:10] got to invite the power thereof to be a
[1:01:13] part of the church to be a part of your
[1:01:16] life am mean you'll never do it with
[1:01:18] just a form of godliness it's the power
[1:01:21] thereof amen for I like how brother
[1:01:23] Wayne says it about men Ministry
[1:01:26] sometimes he said some are uh uh some
[1:01:28] are called some are sent and some just
[1:01:31] got up and
[1:01:33] went because maybe they had a a certain
[1:01:36] feeling or a certain unction or somebody
[1:01:38] said that they would pay for their
[1:01:40] Seminary school so they got up and went
[1:01:43] but they never went like Moses did to
[1:01:45] the back side of the desert and got
[1:01:47] converted am mean that they would be fit
[1:01:49] to preach this gospel they just got up
[1:01:51] under some Seminary or some theology oh
[1:01:54] and how harmful it can be amen for
[1:01:57] somebody to use this word behind a
[1:02:00] sacred desk to try to present their own
[1:02:03] ideas under their own ability without
[1:02:06] that sacred calling mean brother Brandon
[1:02:09] even sometimes wouldn't preach something
[1:02:11] for years because he didn't know if it
[1:02:13] was exactly right just yet you see how
[1:02:16] that nature was in a profit that when he
[1:02:18] would hunt squirrels he'd have to be
[1:02:19] right on the mark and how that rolled
[1:02:21] over into his ministry that it would
[1:02:23] have to be right on the mark amen but
[1:02:25] others would get up and just shoot Any
[1:02:27] Which Way and just maybe hope that one
[1:02:30] time it'll hit oh but how harmful how
[1:02:33] many lives have been hurt how many
[1:02:35] churches have been broken am me because
[1:02:37] they just got up and went oh my I I I
[1:02:41] think uh brother Paul that what if today
[1:02:44] we had a urum and thumb sitting in the
[1:02:46] Church of God and every sermon would
[1:02:49] have to flash or it wasn't right and
[1:02:51] every every prophecy would have to flash
[1:02:54] or it wasn't right amen amen maybe it
[1:02:56] would weed out some of the the nonsense
[1:02:58] that would would would come into
[1:03:01] denominations amen but we do have a
[1:03:03] uraman Thum it's the word of God and we
[1:03:06] can compare every scripture we can
[1:03:08] compare every sermon we can compare
[1:03:10] every prophecy and say either it flashes
[1:03:13] or it don't oh my amen I believe in in
[1:03:17] true called men of God and true called
[1:03:20] Christians amen not a bunch of
[1:03:23] impersonators amen that would try to get
[1:03:25] up without or papers amen like the man
[1:03:28] that would try to get into that wedding
[1:03:30] supper but he didn't have his wedding
[1:03:32] garment amen he he he got there but he
[1:03:35] didn't come the right way uh he didn't
[1:03:37] come God's provided way he didn't come
[1:03:40] through the door and get his wedding
[1:03:42] garment to get into the supper and
[1:03:44] there's only one door there's only
[1:03:47] there's only one way there's only one
[1:03:49] spirit that 1 Corinthians 12:13 would
[1:03:52] say by one Spirit we are all baptized
[1:03:54] into one body and there's one provided
[1:03:57] way and it's God's way Amen in Genesis
[1:04:02] Cain Jesus uh the Lord would even come
[1:04:04] down and maybe try to give Cain another
[1:04:06] chance to say if you just did it like
[1:04:08] your brother Abel you would you would be
[1:04:10] doing okay but Cain would say no I want
[1:04:13] my way but Cain's way was not God's
[1:04:16] provided way and so it would never work
[1:04:20] and so only God's provided way will work
[1:04:23] in this hour and many would maybe come
[1:04:26] and say well well because I've spoken
[1:04:28] tongues I have a right to enter and mean
[1:04:32] because I prophesied have not we cast
[1:04:34] out Devils have not we done this and
[1:04:36] that amen but Paul would tell us though
[1:04:39] I speak with tongues like men and angels
[1:04:41] though I do this and though I do that
[1:04:43] and mean but if I have not charity I am
[1:04:46] nothing I mean and friends I just
[1:04:49] believe the message of the hour if
[1:04:51] that's okay I mean this feels like a
[1:04:53] sister Church to me so I just believe I
[1:04:56] have full Liberty to preach the message
[1:04:58] anden so whatever brother brandom taught
[1:05:00] we believe in it we believe in the gifts
[1:05:02] we believe in the power of God Amen we
[1:05:04] believe in all of it from cover to cover
[1:05:07] it's nothing but the truth we're not
[1:05:09] here to add or take away amen but we are
[1:05:12] workers in the kingdom of God and when
[1:05:14] as workers God gives us a tool belt of
[1:05:17] the gospel and we've got our pliers and
[1:05:19] we've got our wrenches and our
[1:05:20] screwdrivers and we've got our hammer
[1:05:23] and me and if we want to do father's
[1:05:24] will you better not get rid of your
[1:05:26] Hammer you better not get of rid of your
[1:05:28] wrench because you don't know when you
[1:05:30] might need it amen so so we we would not
[1:05:33] get rid of the gifts we would not I mean
[1:05:35] I don't believe a a True Believer has to
[1:05:38] choose choose between gifts and the word
[1:05:40] or I don't believe a Believer has to
[1:05:42] choose between emotion and the word amen
[1:05:45] we just want it all and me if it's in
[1:05:47] the word we want it all if brother
[1:05:49] Brenham taught it we want it all amen
[1:05:52] amen but here these would come in and
[1:05:54] say but just because because I spoke in
[1:05:57] tongues that I have a right to enter but
[1:05:59] but Paul would begin to tell us that
[1:06:01] amen lest you have the giver am mean you
[1:06:03] can have all the gifts but you must have
[1:06:05] the giver am mean and when the giver
[1:06:07] comes in am mean it'll bring a
[1:06:09] conversion am mean and that's what you
[1:06:11] have to have in your Christian walk is a
[1:06:13] conversion to change something from old
[1:06:16] to new otherwise that amen they get the
[1:06:19] cart before the horse amen and think
[1:06:22] that just because amen those the you
[1:06:25] know Brandon would deal with it and a
[1:06:27] mean so many times with the Pentecostal
[1:06:29] group mean because they would preach
[1:06:30] speaking in tongues as the evidence and
[1:06:32] all those things so he's showing that
[1:06:34] that's not the true evidence amen but
[1:06:37] the true evidence of the believer amen
[1:06:39] he would begin to tell us would be to
[1:06:41] receive the word for your day amen to
[1:06:44] show that there's got to be a
[1:06:46] conversion because when brother Brandon
[1:06:48] went beyond the curtain of time and mean
[1:06:50] he would say I mean this is this is the
[1:06:53] Holy Ghost this is perfect love nothing
[1:06:56] will enter here without it amen and so
[1:06:58] that's why a Believer must be converted
[1:07:01] and until God can come in your heart and
[1:07:03] God is love and that love begins to grow
[1:07:07] into your life am me amen that that
[1:07:10] character begins to grow into your life
[1:07:12] amen because that love cannot be
[1:07:15] impersonated amen so that's why amen
[1:07:18] they would show up on that day with just
[1:07:20] maybe I mean maybe an outward expression
[1:07:24] but no love in their heart but but but
[1:07:26] when you've got that love in your heart
[1:07:28] you know it comes from God because Satan
[1:07:31] cannot impersonate that love oh and the
[1:07:34] scripture says in 1 John 4:8 he that
[1:07:37] loveth not knoweth not God for God is
[1:07:41] love amen so here amen these workers of
[1:07:44] iniquity would fall under that rebuke I
[1:07:47] never knew you amen but it wasn't only
[1:07:50] that God never knew them but here the
[1:07:52] scripture saying he that loveth not
[1:07:54] knoweth not God
[1:07:56] so not only did God never know them they
[1:07:58] never truly knew God because they never
[1:08:01] had love they never had God in their
[1:08:04] hearts which is love amen and the Bible
[1:08:07] would begin to tell us if you love me
[1:08:09] keep my Commandments I mean and what was
[1:08:12] the problem with these workers of
[1:08:13] iniquity was they were disobedient to
[1:08:15] the word of God they refused to keep the
[1:08:18] Commandments of God Amen and so how
[1:08:21] could they truly love God and not keep
[1:08:23] his Commandments amen but they were come
[1:08:25] some into the Earth that would be
[1:08:27] children of Disobedience amen
[1:08:29] disobedient to the revealed word of God
[1:08:32] Amen refusing to walk in the
[1:08:34] Commandments of God am mean and how
[1:08:37] would we know them brother Dave mean by
[1:08:39] their fruits you shall know them I mean
[1:08:41] because the rain's going to fall on the
[1:08:44] just and the unjust and mean now we're
[1:08:46] getting somewhere with this okay just
[1:08:47] bear with me the rain's going to fall on
[1:08:49] the just and the unjust amen but a good
[1:08:52] tree cannot bear corrupt fruit and a
[1:08:54] corrupt tree cannot bear good fruit and
[1:08:57] mean and some people sometimes it seems
[1:08:59] like they get so tangled up in that area
[1:09:01] because they'll go to a youth camp or
[1:09:03] something and they'll see somebody get
[1:09:05] under the anointing and then go out and
[1:09:07] live a contrary life and they'll just
[1:09:09] want to throw the whole thing away but
[1:09:11] that was one of the first things brother
[1:09:13] random learned when he come around the
[1:09:15] spirit of God in Mishawaka was that the
[1:09:17] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:09:20] and those two could stand up you
[1:09:21] remember it one could speak in tongues
[1:09:23] one could interpret and one could be a
[1:09:25] real Christian and one could live uh
[1:09:28] with multiple wies and he would say how
[1:09:29] could it be and mean but the rain's
[1:09:31] going to fall on the just and the onjust
[1:09:34] but by their fruit ye shall know them oh
[1:09:37] here we're getting something brother
[1:09:38] brandom says then I knew the truth of
[1:09:41] the camp meeting in the vision the Lord
[1:09:43] showed him a vision of that parable of
[1:09:45] the sewer how there would W come one
[1:09:47] sewing the seed and another would come
[1:09:49] behind him sewing the seed and the wheat
[1:09:51] and the tears would both Rejoice amen
[1:09:53] say praise the Lord under the an oting
[1:09:56] and he's saying the parable of the sewer
[1:09:58] and the seed the sixth chapter of
[1:10:00] Hebrews and the evident manifestation of
[1:10:03] spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all
[1:10:05] became wonderfully clear oh don't you
[1:10:08] like when it becomes wonderfully clear
[1:10:11] he says the swer in white was the Lord
[1:10:14] the sewer in Black was the devil the
[1:10:16] world was the field the seeds were
[1:10:19] people elect and reprobates both partook
[1:10:22] of the same nourishment water and Sun
[1:10:24] both prayed both received help from God
[1:10:27] for he maketh his son and Rain to fall
[1:10:30] on both good and evil and although they
[1:10:32] both had the same wonderful blessing and
[1:10:35] both had the same wonderful
[1:10:37] manifestations there was still one great
[1:10:40] difference they were of different seed
[1:10:43] amen and he said now also was the answer
[1:10:45] to Matthew 7 and he reads amen about the
[1:10:48] workers of iniquity and he says Jesus
[1:10:50] does not deny that they did the mighty
[1:10:53] works that only the Holy Ghost going
[1:10:55] accomplish by way of man but he did deny
[1:10:58] ever knowing them he says these weren't
[1:11:01] backsliders these were Wicked
[1:11:03] unregenerate unregenerate reprobates
[1:11:06] these were the seed of Satan oh my and
[1:11:09] mean you know what that tells me me
[1:11:11] because sometimes in your Christian walk
[1:11:13] you're going to make mistakes and
[1:11:15] sometimes you might even backslide amen
[1:11:17] but amen but that doesn't make you a
[1:11:19] worker of iniquity amen sometimes you
[1:11:21] get such a complex amen when somebody
[1:11:24] preaches about a about the wrong seed
[1:11:26] and you say is it me is it me Lord and
[1:11:28] mean but it had nothing to do with you
[1:11:31] and mean it was never in you to be a
[1:11:32] worker of iniquity for brother brandom
[1:11:34] said they tasted the good Reign from
[1:11:36] heaven but to begin with they were wrong
[1:11:38] to begin with their objectives wasn't
[1:11:40] right their motives wasn't right and
[1:11:43] mean you see they weren't right from the
[1:11:44] beginning am mean but that am me
[1:11:47] sometimes you you wonder maybe if am I a
[1:11:49] worker of iniquity but the truth is you
[1:11:52] don't even know what it would be like to
[1:11:53] be a worker of iniquity you don't even
[1:11:55] know what it's like to have the wrong
[1:11:57] motive and objective am me because am
[1:12:00] mean from the beginning the seed of God
[1:12:02] dwelt inside of you and it separated you
[1:12:05] and see it comes down to the seed these
[1:12:08] were not a backsliders these were seed
[1:12:10] of Satan amen that come on that day amen
[1:12:13] and we and we're cast out from the
[1:12:15] presence of God Amen but the true seed
[1:12:17] of God Amen will not be cast out on that
[1:12:20] day am me because am mean from the
[1:12:22] beginning am mean the seed of God dwelt
[1:12:25] inside of you oh you say what Hey
[1:12:28] Brother Shane maybe sometimes you think
[1:12:29] one day I I'm just going to fall one day
[1:12:32] everyone's going to find out that I'm a
[1:12:34] failure one day one day the Pastor's
[1:12:36] going to realize I'm just a hypocrite
[1:12:38] and I'm just like a Judas amen but under
[1:12:41] the identification of the word you can
[1:12:43] look the devil in the eye brother
[1:12:45] Brandon say it wasn't so from the
[1:12:48] beginning and it was never in me to be a
[1:12:50] Judas it was never in me to be a
[1:12:52] backslider and mean that that would be a
[1:12:54] worker of iniquity it was never in me
[1:12:57] and mean to betray the Lord it was never
[1:12:59] in me to disbelieve this message and me
[1:13:02] because from the beginning the seat of
[1:13:04] God was planted in my soul and called me
[1:13:07] Amen to believe the message of the hour
[1:13:10] it wasn't so from the beginning amen
[1:13:13] because you are defined by the word amen
[1:13:16] and you cannot beat your type oh my see
[1:13:20] if Judas is your type then you're not
[1:13:22] going to be able to beat it am me but if
[1:13:24] the Lord is your type if Abraham is your
[1:13:27] type if Moses is your type then you
[1:13:29] cannot beat your type you can't be
[1:13:32] something different than what you are
[1:13:33] brother Aaron but what God has called
[1:13:35] you to be that's what you are that's
[1:13:38] what you were and that's what you're
[1:13:39] going to be tomorrow that's what you're
[1:13:41] going to be next week I'm saying there's
[1:13:43] a seed that dwells in the heart oh
[1:13:47] brother Brandon would say am mean that
[1:13:49] your anointing tells on
[1:13:51] you amen that's his that's the he says
[1:13:54] he says your anointing tells on you
[1:13:56] whatever your spirit is moves you you're
[1:13:58] motivated by a spirit anden and
[1:14:02] sometimes maybe when you were young
[1:14:03] brother Paul you would try to do
[1:14:05] something and you would try to get away
[1:14:07] with something and say uh yeah mom I did
[1:14:09] take out the trash and and then maybe
[1:14:11] Ben comes along and say no he didn't I I
[1:14:13] saw him I had to take it out he didn't
[1:14:15] do it you see it's something that told
[1:14:17] on you amen and your anointing tells on
[1:14:21] you amen you say oh I'm never going to
[1:14:23] make it oh I'm just a failure amen but
[1:14:26] there's an anointing upon your life amen
[1:14:29] why are you still here amen what brought
[1:14:31] you to church this morning what's kept
[1:14:33] you through all the trials and the
[1:14:35] heartaches what's anchored your soul
[1:14:37] Beyond the Veil and mean your anointing
[1:14:39] tells on you and mean your lips
[1:14:41] sometimes you even get discouraged and
[1:14:42] you begin to confess the wrong thing but
[1:14:45] then that anointing begins to pick you
[1:14:46] up and say you're a liar that's not the
[1:14:49] truth you're a Son of God you're a
[1:14:51] daughter of God you came from God and
[1:14:53] you're going back to God and you never
[1:14:56] did it in the first place oh your
[1:14:58] anointing begins to tell you out and
[1:15:00] mean you begin to confess the devil's
[1:15:02] lie and me but the devil's lie doesn't
[1:15:04] Define you the word of God defines who
[1:15:06] you are oh we're living in a day where
[1:15:09] everybody's got to have their pronouns
[1:15:11] and say I'm a he or she or this or that
[1:15:14] amen but I don't care what you say you
[1:15:16] are I mean I want to know what are you
[1:15:18] are you a boy or are you a girl because
[1:15:20] what you say you are doesn't really
[1:15:22] matter and me brother Wayne would begin
[1:15:23] to tell the church the other today about
[1:15:26] objective versus subjective truth and
[1:15:28] you can look at this pulpit and you can
[1:15:30] say it's a closet you can say it's a
[1:15:32] door I mean from your subjective point
[1:15:35] of view you can say whatever you want
[1:15:37] but it doesn't really change the
[1:15:38] objective truth is that this is a Pulpit
[1:15:41] am mean and the devil would try to am
[1:15:43] mean from his point of view tell you
[1:15:45] mean that you're going to fail and
[1:15:47] you're never going to make it am mean
[1:15:48] but that doesn't change the objective
[1:15:50] truth about your life but the truth is
[1:15:53] amen that you are a son of God God that
[1:15:55] you are a seed of God Amen that the
[1:15:57] Rapture is for you am mean the
[1:15:59] Millennium is for you amen and you are
[1:16:01] not defined by the devil you are defined
[1:16:04] by the word of God and so when the word
[1:16:07] says you are loosed you are loosed when
[1:16:09] the word says you're anointed you're
[1:16:11] anointed when the word says you're an
[1:16:13] overcomer you're an overcomer and mean
[1:16:15] whatever the word says about you that is
[1:16:17] the definition over your life oh my amen
[1:16:21] your your your complexes don't Define
[1:16:23] you your mist Stakes don't Define you oh
[1:16:27] glory amen because we all make them but
[1:16:29] they don't Define you you see when
[1:16:32] Abraham's commentary was written by Paul
[1:16:35] amen and when Paul would write about
[1:16:36] Moses Moses and Pa Abraham they made
[1:16:39] mistakes am mean Abraham would lie Moses
[1:16:42] would make mistakes even kill a man uh
[1:16:45] under his own abilities a mean but when
[1:16:48] Paul wrote their commentary he would be
[1:16:51] like Abraham who stagger not at the
[1:16:53] promise of God but was strong in faith
[1:16:56] giving glory to God and mean what
[1:16:58] defined Abraham it wasn't his mistakes
[1:17:01] and mean Paul defined him as a man of
[1:17:03] Faith a hero of Faith who staggered not
[1:17:07] at the promise of God but was strong in
[1:17:10] faith giving glory to God oh and your
[1:17:13] mistakes do not define you oh and me
[1:17:18] brother brother Wayne would preach a
[1:17:19] while back on identification and he
[1:17:21] would say when an Eagle Falls it doesn't
[1:17:24] change the the species amen a fall
[1:17:28] doesn't change the species a mistake
[1:17:31] didn't am mean he wasn't an eagle one
[1:17:33] day and a chicken the next brother and
[1:17:35] mean he was and mean when he fell he was
[1:17:37] an eagle and when he got up he was still
[1:17:39] an eagle and mean he never was a chicken
[1:17:41] to begin and he wasn't never going to be
[1:17:43] a chicken and mean and you are not a
[1:17:45] bride member one day and a worker of
[1:17:49] iniquity the next day mean but you are
[1:17:51] what you are and mean when you ever
[1:17:53] recognize what you are you'll realize
[1:17:55] that your mistakes don't change who you
[1:17:57] are your faults don't change who you are
[1:18:00] your your your failures don't change who
[1:18:02] you are Church you are the pure virtuous
[1:18:05] sinless bride of Jesus Christ and you
[1:18:08] came from the mind of God oh and despite
[1:18:11] everything else that's who you are
[1:18:14] despite the fall the eagle was still the
[1:18:16] eagle oh and brother Brandon would say
[1:18:19] that this man learned that science says
[1:18:21] that a bumblebee should never be able to
[1:18:23] fly me but brother Brandon would say I
[1:18:26] guess the Bumblebee didn't listen to
[1:18:27] what science had to say because he flew
[1:18:30] anyhow and they would say that the days
[1:18:32] of Miracles are passed but brother
[1:18:34] brandham didn't listen to what they had
[1:18:36] to say because the word had already
[1:18:38] defined that he was the same yesterday
[1:18:41] today and forever amen and so you got to
[1:18:44] stop letting the devil Define who you
[1:18:46] are but you say despite what science
[1:18:49] says despite what the devil says I am an
[1:18:52] eagle I am the bride despite despite
[1:18:56] what the devil says I like that word
[1:18:58] despite it means without being affected
[1:19:00] by or without taking any notice or being
[1:19:04] influenced by not prevented by amen you
[1:19:08] know what that means amen the Lord amen
[1:19:11] that's called me to preach this gospel
[1:19:14] that means that I'm a preacher despite
[1:19:17] whether it's a good sermon or a bad
[1:19:19] sermon amen my feelings will definitely
[1:19:22] maybe change me if it goes good if it
[1:19:25] goes bad I mean you're going to feel it
[1:19:27] but despite that it doesn't change that
[1:19:30] I'm a preacher and me and the pastor may
[1:19:33] have good days and bad days and up days
[1:19:36] and down days but despite that it
[1:19:38] doesn't change that he's the pastor and
[1:19:41] me you think well I just feel like I
[1:19:43] made a mistake and and one day the
[1:19:45] Lord's just going to open the Earth and
[1:19:47] swallow me up because of my stupidity I
[1:19:50] me well if daythan and cor was your type
[1:19:52] maybe but if that's not your type then
[1:19:55] you can forget about it am mean because
[1:19:57] it doesn't change what God thinks about
[1:20:00] you am mean because your identity is
[1:20:03] stronger than that it comes from the
[1:20:06] word of
[1:20:07] God oh you might have this is Sunday so
[1:20:10] amen tomorrow might be a little rough
[1:20:12] sometimes those Mondays Amen brother Ben
[1:20:14] they're just Mondays that's all you can
[1:20:16] say Amen but I'm going to tell you what
[1:20:18] despite what tomorrow
[1:20:20] holds I can tell if you can identify
[1:20:23] yourself in this Bible as a Christian
[1:20:26] then I don't care what tomorrow holds I
[1:20:28] I know what you're going to be you're
[1:20:30] going to be a Christian I mean I really
[1:20:32] don't know what next week holds if we
[1:20:34] have a next year I don't know what it's
[1:20:36] going to hold but I can tell you you're
[1:20:38] going to be a Christian next year you're
[1:20:40] going to be an overcomer next year
[1:20:42] because despite what the devil's going
[1:20:44] to throw at you amen your identity
[1:20:46] doesn't change because you have been
[1:20:49] defined oh you are defined by the seed
[1:20:53] that lays inside of you amen you are not
[1:20:55] defined by the outward conditions you
[1:20:58] are defined by the seed and so that's
[1:21:01] why we can spend amen laying a
[1:21:04] foundation for the workers of iniquity
[1:21:06] but then if you could ever recognize who
[1:21:08] you are in the scripture and if you
[1:21:09] could ever realize that that is not you
[1:21:12] and me then you can let off the pressure
[1:21:15] and and look the devil and tell him I
[1:21:18] know who I am am I I I know what I am
[1:21:23] and it's not going to change
[1:21:25] amen because it's anchored in the mind
[1:21:27] of God Amen but this would be a
[1:21:31] time amen that we could know what these
[1:21:35] seeds are that we could know what these
[1:21:38] Spirits are a prophet could come and
[1:21:40] begin to identify him to us begin to
[1:21:42] show us uh you know he would begin to
[1:21:44] tell us that if the church only knew its
[1:21:46] position and it will one day then the
[1:21:48] Rapture will go is that right brother
[1:21:49] Alex me so so the prophet would begin to
[1:21:53] reveal amen
[1:21:55] who this bride is and that she's been
[1:21:57] called out of denominations Amen in only
[1:22:01] one book brother Brandon would say
[1:22:02] there's only one book that reveals who
[1:22:04] you are where you came from and where
[1:22:05] you're going and so as the as as we're
[1:22:08] in this age where the Lord's revealing
[1:22:10] who we are and mean and also revealing
[1:22:13] to us what this other Spirit would look
[1:22:16] like and so in second Thessalonians 2
[1:22:20] and 3 it says let no man deceive you by
[1:22:23] any means MH for that day shall not come
[1:22:26] except they coming a falling away first
[1:22:28] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:22:31] of predition who opposeth and exalteth
[1:22:34] himself above all that is called God or
[1:22:36] is worshiped so that he as God sth in
[1:22:39] the temple of God showing himself that
[1:22:41] he is God remember ye not that when I
[1:22:44] was yet with you I told you these things
[1:22:46] and now you know what withholdeth that
[1:22:48] he might be revealed in his time now
[1:22:51] brother brandom takes that and shows
[1:22:53] that it would be revealed at the
[1:22:54] breaking of the seals and mean that this
[1:22:57] man of sin would be revealed in his time
[1:23:00] and that would be at the breaking of the
[1:23:01] seals and so he said we we would know
[1:23:04] exactly what it was and he say who is
[1:23:06] this man of iniquity who is this man of
[1:23:09] sin this fellow that's a working
[1:23:11] iniquity but he would be revealed in his
[1:23:13] time and so this is in the first seal
[1:23:16] and and this seal is just beginning to
[1:23:18] break open that that white horse rider
[1:23:20] was not Christ but it was the Antichrist
[1:23:24] and showing that this man of sin this
[1:23:27] workers of iniquity amen was beginning
[1:23:30] to be revealed as that Antichrist spirit
[1:23:33] that would come into the into the age
[1:23:35] and so in verse 7 it says the mystery of
[1:23:38] iniquity doth already work only he who
[1:23:41] now lth will let until he be taken out
[1:23:44] of the way and so he says deceivers you
[1:23:47] see deceiving the people often to
[1:23:49] something um see but only he God that
[1:23:54] leth will let until the church Christ
[1:23:58] the bride be taken out of the way and
[1:24:01] then shall that Wicked be revealed whom
[1:24:03] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:24:04] of his mouth destroyed with the
[1:24:06] brightness of his coming even him whose
[1:24:08] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:24:10] with all power and signs and lying
[1:24:12] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[1:24:15] unrighteousness and then that perish
[1:24:17] because they receive not the love of the
[1:24:18] truth that they might be saved and
[1:24:20] brother BR says with all deceivableness
[1:24:22] of unrighteousness deceive deceiving
[1:24:24] people by unrighteousness so here comes
[1:24:26] this class of deceivers trying to
[1:24:29] deceive people by unrighteousness and
[1:24:31] them that perished and then he says not
[1:24:34] this bride so them that perish but it's
[1:24:37] not going to be this bride now them
[1:24:39] that's looking for such a thing because
[1:24:41] they receive not the love of the
[1:24:43] truth so he showing us that the mystery
[1:24:46] of iniquity does already work amen who
[1:24:49] is this man of iniquity who are these
[1:24:51] workers of iniquity am me showing that
[1:24:54] there was this seed of Satan this
[1:24:56] Antichrist spirit that began to come in
[1:24:58] and work in workers of iniquity and try
[1:25:01] to deceive amen the true bride amen that
[1:25:04] there would come false Christ that there
[1:25:06] would come false prophets amen and that
[1:25:09] they would deceive the very elect if it
[1:25:11] were possible amen but of course brother
[1:25:14] Brandon would tell us amen that it's not
[1:25:16] possible that those whose names on the
[1:25:19] L's Book of Life would not be deceived
[1:25:21] and and then brother Brandon would
[1:25:23] actually tie it back to that Hebrews 6
[1:25:25] just like it would be impossible for
[1:25:27] them to be renewed amen that that
[1:25:29] there's a bride and it's impossible for
[1:25:31] them to ever be deceived amen because
[1:25:34] you are the word amen so if it were
[1:25:36] possible amen but you've been built to
[1:25:38] withstand amen amen amen that other seed
[1:25:42] that that that that seed of iniquity
[1:25:44] that would try to penetrate this age
[1:25:46] amen but brother Brandon would tell us
[1:25:48] that that he knows that if the people
[1:25:49] get the true revelation of the true
[1:25:51] church and what she is and what she
[1:25:53] stands for that she can do the Greater
[1:25:55] Works and she will be an invincible Army
[1:25:58] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:26:00] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:26:03] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:26:05] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:26:07] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:26:10] her amen so here brother brandom's
[1:26:12] saying I just want to read this one more
[1:26:14] quote here to to to to to bring this out
[1:26:17] he said now I said a moment ago that the
[1:26:19] false Vine came into full fruition in
[1:26:22] this age her fruit would mature and
[1:26:25] ripen that is correct this evil spirited
[1:26:28] Church full of iniquity will be revealed
[1:26:31] as the mustard seed that grew into a
[1:26:33] tree where in Lodge the fowls of the air
[1:26:36] at her head will be the Antichrist the
[1:26:39] mystery of iniquity and then he says all
[1:26:42] this is true brother Dave and then he
[1:26:44] says and if this is true then it must
[1:26:47] also be true amen that the bride church
[1:26:50] WIll mature and her rightness shall be
[1:26:52] an identification with her Lord by means
[1:26:56] of the word and her head who will come
[1:26:58] to her is the mystery of godliness which
[1:27:01] indeed is Christ amen you got to
[1:27:04] recognize amen where you belong in the
[1:27:06] scripture sure there's a mystery of
[1:27:08] iniquity sure Satan is coming Amen to to
[1:27:12] totally embody himself amen as an
[1:27:15] antichrist spirit amen but at the same
[1:27:17] time there's another mystery it's the
[1:27:20] mystery of godliness and you've got to
[1:27:22] recognize where you're head ship belongs
[1:27:25] amen Satan is not your head amen but
[1:27:27] your head amen is the mystery of
[1:27:29] godliness your headship is the word is
[1:27:31] that right brother amen you come under
[1:27:33] the headship of this word amen and you
[1:27:36] recognize amen that God was made flesh
[1:27:39] amen and while Satan is trying to
[1:27:41] inhabit fleshly vessels amen and become
[1:27:43] incarnate in his army oh there is
[1:27:46] another Army rising up anden God has
[1:27:49] come down and been made flesh in a bride
[1:27:52] body picking up some workers of his will
[1:27:55] picking up an army that would withstand
[1:27:58] this Antichrist Spirit an army that
[1:28:00] would only adhere to the word of God and
[1:28:03] Me Say what is all this about what is
[1:28:06] all this about iniquity and workers of
[1:28:08] iniquity and Mysteries of iniquity and
[1:28:11] cups of iniquity what's it all about you
[1:28:14] see in in in in in the first Exodus they
[1:28:18] had to wait until the amorites cup of
[1:28:21] iniquity would be filled because they
[1:28:23] were going to inhabit at the land but
[1:28:25] until the cup of iniquity would be
[1:28:27] filled amen then then God wouldn't drive
[1:28:30] them out but once it was filled then it
[1:28:32] would become time for Exodus oh and we
[1:28:35] are living in another age amen where
[1:28:37] it's Exodus time for the Bride of Jesus
[1:28:40] Christ amen and we're just waiting while
[1:28:42] that Gentile cup of iniquity is being
[1:28:45] filled am mean and we're waiting brother
[1:28:47] dayve for that last seed to come in amen
[1:28:49] amen what's it showing what's it all got
[1:28:52] to do with us this revealing of iniquity
[1:28:54] and Mysteries of iniquity am mean mean
[1:28:57] it don't have anything to do with you am
[1:28:59] mean because while Satan's coming down
[1:29:02] incarnate amen the scripture says only
[1:29:06] God he that lth will let until he be
[1:29:09] taken out of the way D so what does all
[1:29:11] this show to us friends it shows that
[1:29:13] it's Exodus time it shows that it's time
[1:29:16] where God's going to take a bride out of
[1:29:18] the way and me and you will not have to
[1:29:20] stand the Judgment with those workers of
[1:29:23] iniquity amen but you will be in
[1:29:25] Paradise amen enjoying a wedding supper
[1:29:28] amen with the Lord himself the power
[1:29:30] thereof will pick you up off of this
[1:29:32] Earth and change your mortal body in the
[1:29:35] moment in the twinkling of an eye you'll
[1:29:37] no longer be in this old Earthbound
[1:29:39] condition and me but while Satan's
[1:29:41] having his time in the tribulation I'll
[1:29:44] be in glory celebrating eternity with
[1:29:46] the Saints of old because I came from
[1:29:49] God and that's where I'm going back to
[1:29:51] oh this bride doesn't go through the
[1:29:53] tribulation and the blood of Jesus
[1:29:56] purifies this bride oh Hallelujah he
[1:29:59] stood my tribulation on Calvary
[1:30:02] tribulation is in my past and Rapture is
[1:30:04] in my future because he bore it for me
[1:30:07] at Calvary oh friends you might be
[1:30:11] guilty of iniquity you might have been
[1:30:13] born in sin you might have been shapen
[1:30:15] in iniquity but that doesn't make you a
[1:30:18] worker of iniquity oh my but while he
[1:30:22] laid there on that cross brother Shane
[1:30:25] and he was wounded for your
[1:30:26] transgression he was bruised for your
[1:30:29] iniquity and you will not have to stand
[1:30:31] the Judgment with those class amen
[1:30:34] you're of a different seed and the
[1:30:36] destination of this seed is eternity the
[1:30:39] destination of this seed is Paradise oh
[1:30:43] hallelujah it's the mystery of the
[1:30:46] translation of the seed of God Amen
[1:30:49] someone would come and ask brother
[1:30:51] Brandon one time cuz in Matthew 8 said
[1:30:54] the children of the Kingdom shall be
[1:30:55] cast out into outer Darkness where there
[1:30:58] shall be weeping and nashing of teeth
[1:31:00] and they would say is that the same as
[1:31:03] casting them out of the mind of God and
[1:31:06] brother Brandon would begin to answer
[1:31:07] the question and be like well you're
[1:31:09] referring to the wedding supper now and
[1:31:11] he begins to show well the children of
[1:31:14] the Kingdom always refers to Israel and
[1:31:17] me and so begins to answer this question
[1:31:20] and mean and and brother Brandon would
[1:31:22] preach to us that under those 70th weeks
[1:31:25] of Daniel that there would be a
[1:31:27] Reconciliation for iniquity for Israel I
[1:31:31] mean because you see iniquity is to do
[1:31:33] wrong right and you know to do something
[1:31:34] and you don't do it and at the cross I
[1:31:37] mean they were guilty because they they
[1:31:40] crucified their Lord amen but what the
[1:31:42] difference was amen was amen for Israel
[1:31:45] they didn't do it willingly amen but God
[1:31:48] blinded them amen that you might receive
[1:31:50] life amen is that right brother amen so
[1:31:53] God blinded them that us Gentiles might
[1:31:56] have a chance to receive the message
[1:31:58] amen and so they will have a space where
[1:32:01] reconciliation for iniquity will be made
[1:32:04] and brother Brandon begins to answer
[1:32:06] this and say no amen it's not what he's
[1:32:09] talking about they won't be cast out of
[1:32:11] the mind of God because he cannot forget
[1:32:14] Israel amen and you remember what the
[1:32:17] rebuke was to those workers of iniquity
[1:32:19] and mean it was I never knew you depart
[1:32:22] from me ye that work iniquity and I
[1:32:24] begin to thank brother Dave ma if he can
[1:32:26] never forget Israel what about this
[1:32:29] bride mean and mean you're worried that
[1:32:31] one day he's just going to rebuke you
[1:32:33] and say I never knew you depart from me
[1:32:36] but how could he forget you and mean
[1:32:38] when he came when you came from the back
[1:32:40] part of his mind and mean when he put
[1:32:42] your name on the L's book of life before
[1:32:45] the foundation of the world what about
[1:32:46] it brother Aaron I was there I was there
[1:32:49] as a Son of God shouting for Joy amen
[1:32:52] when the morning started are sing for
[1:32:54] Glory and we saw the Plan of Redemption
[1:32:57] God putting some names on the Lamb's
[1:33:00] Book of Life by the spoken word and when
[1:33:02] he spoke his name that he would be the
[1:33:04] lamb slain from before the foundation of
[1:33:07] the world he spoke my name with his and
[1:33:10] so I can read Matthew 7 and I can know
[1:33:13] that worker of iniquity doesn't apply to
[1:33:16] me because he knows me he knows me he
[1:33:20] knew me before the foundation of the
[1:33:22] world Amen our mother might forget her
[1:33:24] suckling child but how could he forget
[1:33:27] us whose names are engraved on the palms
[1:33:30] of his hands and mean what about it amen
[1:33:32] that a god rich in Mercy that somebody
[1:33:35] could step into a prayer line amen and
[1:33:37] in a moment they could put their sins
[1:33:39] under the blood amen and in that moment
[1:33:42] a prophet couldn't even call it out
[1:33:44] because it was forgotten it was under
[1:33:46] the blood and that same mind of God can
[1:33:50] never forget you amen he can forget your
[1:33:53] sins in a moment amen but how could he
[1:33:56] forget you his children who came from
[1:33:58] the back part of his mind who were his
[1:34:01] before the foundation of the world Oh my
[1:34:04] he would say I know the thoughts that I
[1:34:06] think towards you thoughts of peace and
[1:34:08] not of evil to give you an expected end
[1:34:11] and how could he be thinking about you
[1:34:13] and thinking about an expected end for
[1:34:15] you if he never knew you but he would
[1:34:18] say I called you amen and your future
[1:34:20] was clear amen and you're going to make
[1:34:22] it because because you're my
[1:34:25] seed oh hallelujah hallelujah amen what
[1:34:29] about amen see you started
[1:34:32] right because you started in the mind of
[1:34:35] God oh my you started right you were
[1:34:39] there when the worlds were formed Amen
[1:34:42] in John 6 would say all that the father
[1:34:44] giveth me shall come to me and him that
[1:34:47] cometh to me I will in no wise cast out
[1:34:49] for I came down from heaven not to do my
[1:34:52] own will but the will of him that sent
[1:34:54] me you see it's not all that saith unto
[1:34:58] me Lord Lord but he that doeth the will
[1:34:59] of the father and here he says and this
[1:35:02] is the Father's will which ha sent me
[1:35:04] that of all which he hath given me I
[1:35:07] should lose nothing but should raise it
[1:35:09] up again at the last day oh he's got a
[1:35:13] purpose and he will not lose a one of
[1:35:16] his amen those prodal that you're
[1:35:18] worried about he will not lose a one of
[1:35:20] his amen amen sometimes you might make
[1:35:22] mistakes but he will will not lose a
[1:35:24] want of his sister and me amen he cannot
[1:35:27] lose those Eternal attributes that came
[1:35:29] out from him oh but we want to do the
[1:35:33] will of the
[1:35:35] father that's what Christ Christianity
[1:35:39] is would be to do the will of God and so
[1:35:42] brother Brandon would tell us that this
[1:35:43] is the Father's will this is his word
[1:35:46] and his will is his word and then he
[1:35:49] would say in uh true and false Vines
[1:35:51] this is the Father's will that used to
[1:35:54] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be
[1:35:56] born again you see this is the Father's
[1:36:00] will that you should do his word and if
[1:36:04] you I mean if you want to be a worker in
[1:36:07] the kingdom of God you don't just want
[1:36:09] to be found working without purpose you
[1:36:13] want to be found working in the will of
[1:36:15] God and Father's will is to be born
[1:36:17] again amen it it Marvel not that I say
[1:36:20] unto you you must be born again am me
[1:36:23] except a born man be born again he can
[1:36:25] in no wise and see the kingdom of God
[1:36:28] Amen it's not something that you work
[1:36:31] amen friends it's something that's Born
[1:36:33] Into You am mean me without that new
[1:36:36] birth every effort is in vain am mean
[1:36:38] because am mean you could make every
[1:36:40] effort you could do every effort you
[1:36:43] could be a a a a a Christian to a tea as
[1:36:46] far as Works go but that's not Father's
[1:36:49] will father's will is that you be born
[1:36:52] again and because that is God's program
[1:36:55] of acceptance and mean God's program is
[1:36:57] that you come under the blood and be
[1:37:00] born again and mean here these group
[1:37:02] would come on that day and say have not
[1:37:04] I done this and have not I done that and
[1:37:08] look at me and look at my successes and
[1:37:11] look at my righteousness and my
[1:37:13] Prosperity but that is not God's program
[1:37:16] God's program of acceptance was to get
[1:37:18] under the shed blood I I I can imagine
[1:37:21] that maybe in the first Exodus that
[1:37:23] there would be some that that would
[1:37:25] maybe I mean refuse to follow the
[1:37:27] command of Moses the prophet because
[1:37:30] they might think well I I'm a good
[1:37:32] Christian and I'm an Egyptian and and
[1:37:35] I'm a priest and I'm this and I'm that
[1:37:37] so I don't need under the blood I mean
[1:37:39] I'm good enough amen I can survive these
[1:37:42] plagues amen but but there was another
[1:37:44] class of people that were hid away under
[1:37:46] that token and when they were hid away
[1:37:49] under the shed blood and they were safe
[1:37:51] and that's what God recognized is God
[1:37:53] only recognizes the token amen it's not
[1:37:57] have not I done this and have not I done
[1:38:00] that amen but it it's my hope is built
[1:38:03] on nothing less than Jesus blood and
[1:38:06] righteousness nothing in my arms I bring
[1:38:08] simply to thy cross I cling and mean
[1:38:11] it's God's provided way it's the shed
[1:38:13] blood and mean why was Cain rejected and
[1:38:16] Abel accepted because Abel got under
[1:38:19] God's program and he got under the blood
[1:38:22] I mean why was Rahab accepted and
[1:38:24] pardoned and me why were the children of
[1:38:26] Israel amen safe under that token
[1:38:29] because it was God's program it's not
[1:38:32] your righteousness that's right amen
[1:38:34] that's a good thing it's not our
[1:38:36] righteousness amen sister Anna Maria
[1:38:38] it's not our it's not our righteousness
[1:38:40] will get us nowhere with God I mean
[1:38:42] because we could come to the Lord and
[1:38:44] say I quit smoking I quit drinking I
[1:38:47] quit Dancing out in the world anden and
[1:38:50] he could just stand there and say okay
[1:38:52] well that sounds great great you did it
[1:38:55] you did it that that's your works but
[1:38:57] what about me what what can I do for you
[1:38:59] and you can say I I'm very righteous and
[1:39:02] you can bring all your righteousness to
[1:39:03] The Altar and say Lord I I've done all
[1:39:06] this and I'm a good Christian and I read
[1:39:08] my Bible every day and I pray amen but
[1:39:10] am mean that's what you do that's your
[1:39:12] works but am mean what God does for you
[1:39:15] is Grace that's the shed blood and mean
[1:39:17] you are not saved by works but you are
[1:39:20] saved by grace through faith not of
[1:39:22] Works let's any man should boast and
[1:39:25] mean and mean none of us have a right to
[1:39:27] boast our own works this morning but the
[1:39:29] only thing we can boast upon is the shed
[1:39:31] blood of Jesus Christ oh and it's a good
[1:39:35] thing you can get away from that
[1:39:37] Armenian bondage am me that one day and
[1:39:40] mean because maybe you forgot to read
[1:39:42] that bi your Bible that day that you're
[1:39:44] going to go to hell somehow and mean
[1:39:45] because you forgot to pray that night or
[1:39:47] you fell asleep while praying and now
[1:39:49] you you think that God's going to just
[1:39:51] condemn you and throw you away and but
[1:39:53] if you're a Son of God you're still a
[1:39:55] Son of God Amen if you've got the blood
[1:39:57] over your life amen then you make a
[1:39:59] mistake just repent and move forward and
[1:40:02] mean you got to stop letting the
[1:40:03] condemnation hold you down for days and
[1:40:06] weeks and months and me put it under the

[1:40:15] much time I mean but forget those things
[1:40:18] which are behind and let's press towards
[1:40:20] the mark of the high calling and we say
[1:40:22] I've done this and I've done done that

[1:40:37] condemnation you live under faults and
[1:40:39] failures and mean and you're you're
[1:40:41] you're so wore out and mean because
[1:40:43] you're trying to attain perfection in
[1:40:45] your own Works am mean and the scripture
[1:40:48] would tell us to be therefore perfect
[1:40:50] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:40:53] if you're trying to attain that in your
[1:40:55] own works you'll drive yourself crazy
[1:40:58] but Perfection comes from the shed blood
[1:41:01] and you can make a mistake brother Alex
[1:41:04] and there is still a perfect blood
[1:41:06] pumping for you daily and me that you
[1:41:08] can get under that shed blood and you
[1:41:10] are still perfect because there's a
[1:41:12] perfect blood amen that he shed for your

[1:41:18] me this far and so why would I trust
[1:41:21] them to carry me through and me it's
[1:41:23] exhausting it's exhausting I mean you
[1:41:27] you if you try to do it upon the program
[1:41:31] of your works right you'll never attain
[1:41:34] it you'll never I me if you're waiting
[1:41:37] to accept the promises of this message
[1:41:41] if you're waiting to move into higher
[1:41:43] Heights with the Lord because you're
[1:41:45] still making mistakes amen then who is
[1:41:47] going to claim these promises who is
[1:41:50] going to possess this amen Amen brother
[1:41:52] Paul I maybe you've got your angel wings
[1:41:54] but I don't have mine yet I still make
[1:41:57] mistakes amen you might never make a
[1:41:59] mistake amen but I do so I need the
[1:42:02] blood amen and we all make mistakes to
[1:42:04] tell the truth aen but if you get under
[1:42:06] that shed blood then you can accept the
[1:42:09] finished work at Calvary because it's
[1:42:11] not based upon your goodness it's based
[1:42:13] upon the shed blood amen and what he did
[1:42:16] for you and he already paid for every
[1:42:18] promise so you don't have to work it up
[1:42:20] to try to earn it just put everything
[1:42:22] under the blood and begin to accept the
[1:42:24] promises of God oh my you can begin to
[1:42:28] claim them you can come boldly Before
[1:42:30] the Throne of God and ask abundantly
[1:42:32] that your Joys might be full am mean you
[1:42:35] can seek and you shall find you can
[1:42:37] knock and it shall be open it it might
[1:42:40] be opened onto me it shall be opened
[1:42:42] onto you I mean you can you can seek the
[1:42:45] Lord and you have a promise that you
[1:42:47] shall find them but you say well maybe
[1:42:50] maybe because this mistake maybe because
[1:42:52] of what I did last last week amen that
[1:42:55] promise isn't going to come to pass amen
[1:42:57] isn't the blood powerful enough Amen to
[1:43:00] purge those sins away that you can move
[1:43:03] on you can get out of that rut and mean
[1:43:06] you don't have to stay there forever and
[1:43:08] mean the power there of Amen is hereen
[1:43:11] that can change your life that you don't
[1:43:13] have to stay in that rut of addiction
[1:43:15] you don't have to stay in that cycle of
[1:43:17] failure constantly amen and mean there
[1:43:20] is a power that can give you the ability
[1:43:22] to overcome that thing oh my it's God's
[1:43:27] program it's and it don't change amen if
[1:43:30] you ever accept God upon the basis amen
[1:43:35] if if God's ever healed somebody amen
[1:43:38] and you come upon the same basis that he
[1:43:40] seals somebody before he's Duty bound to
[1:43:43] his word to meet you on that same basis
[1:43:46] and so if you ever find God's program
[1:43:49] then you know that if you come God's
[1:43:51] provided way he's Duty bound to his word
[1:43:54] to meet you upon that program amen and
[1:43:58] if God has ever accepted somebody before
[1:44:01] you can come that way and say Lord amen
[1:44:03] how do I know I'm going to be accepted
[1:44:05] amen
[1:44:06] because the first fruits of the
[1:44:09] Resurrection our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:44:12] Christ went to Calvary as our sacrifice
[1:44:15] and he was accepted amen and so if
[1:44:18] you're in him you can have the
[1:44:20] confidence that you're going to be
[1:44:21] accepted amen amen that you can have the
[1:44:24] confidence that if the Same Spirit
[1:44:26] dwells in you it shall also Quicken your
[1:44:29] mortal bodies that he came up as the
[1:44:31] first fruits and was waved and me and
[1:44:34] his life was accepted then that same
[1:44:37] life inside of you brother Brian can be
[1:44:40] accepted oh my but what about let's
[1:44:42] bring it a little bit farther to our day
[1:44:44] anden brother Brandon one time went
[1:44:46] beyond the curtain of time and he's
[1:44:48] beginning to to meet all of the saints
[1:44:50] that had gone before and he's saying uh
[1:44:53] these aren't all bandoms are they said
[1:44:54] no these are your converts and then
[1:44:56] brother Dave he would begin to say well
[1:44:58] will Paul's group have to stand and be
[1:45:00] judged and they would say yes and he
[1:45:02] would say well then Glory I preached
[1:45:05] exactly what Paul preached and amen that
[1:45:07] group would cry out we are resting on
[1:45:09] that amen and then the the that voice
[1:45:12] would begin to tell them and if you are
[1:45:14] accepted on that day and and and it's I
[1:45:18] believe it's in the rejected King and it
[1:45:19] says and you will be and mean then you
[1:45:22] will present am mean these converts as
[1:45:24] the trophies of your ministry and mean
[1:45:27] you see God's program is to get under
[1:45:29] the blood and me you see the program for
[1:45:31] today is to get under this message of
[1:45:34] the hour and mean because we've already
[1:45:35] had a prophet go beyond the curtain of
[1:45:38] time and say I preached what Paul
[1:45:40] preached and if you are accepted on that
[1:45:42] day and you will be then he would
[1:45:44] present us with him as the trophies of
[1:45:46] his ministry so what do you got to do in
[1:45:49] this hour to be accepted get in the
[1:45:51] program of God amen and if God's program
[1:45:54] is the blood then get under the blood
[1:45:56] and if God's program is the message then
[1:45:59] get under the message and start working
[1:46:01] in the program of God oh my it's God's
[1:46:05] program and me and brother Brandon would
[1:46:07] say that that's the way we always Escape
[1:46:10] is following God's
[1:46:12] program mean and God's program in the
[1:46:15] day of Noah was to get in the ark and
[1:46:18] God's program and the to the children of
[1:46:20] Israel was to get under the token and
[1:46:22] God's program today is to get under the
[1:46:26] message of the hour brother BR said
[1:46:28] we're not to come together to talk about
[1:46:30] the message we are come together to get
[1:46:32] in the
[1:46:33] message can I hear it amen and the
[1:46:36] message is Christ he is the word that's
[1:46:38] right we're to get into it get beneath
[1:46:40] it and me brother brand would say the
[1:46:42] church ought to get in God's program
[1:46:44] then the church will move all right he
[1:46:46] would say and sooner we can get to that
[1:46:48] the better the church will achieve the
[1:46:49] purpose of God when we get to God's
[1:46:52] program and mean we're not trying to get
[1:46:54] into our own program now we're trying to
[1:46:56] lay aside our program that we might get
[1:46:58] in God's program uh we don't want your
[1:47:00] program we don't want my program we amen
[1:47:03] I I I believe I can speak for your
[1:47:05] pastor this morning this church wants to
[1:47:07] get under the program of God and me
[1:47:09] because he's a Believer and mean and I'm
[1:47:11] a Believer and you're Believers and we
[1:47:13] have a desire Lord what is your program
[1:47:16] that we might get under it and and if
[1:47:18] his program for today is the message of
[1:47:20] the hour then we ought to get under the
[1:47:22] message of the hour and me you see
[1:47:24] brother Braham tells about that
[1:47:25] Lighthouse and those birds would come
[1:47:27] and try to beat the light out he said
[1:47:29] when they should have just used it to go
[1:47:31] to safety instead they beat their brains
[1:47:33] out trying to put the light out it's
[1:47:36] said oh how they today instead of trying
[1:47:38] to beat this message out they should be
[1:47:40] using it to go to safety am mean and you
[1:47:43] see they're trying to write articles
[1:47:45] about this message they're trying to
[1:47:47] print things and and build websites
[1:47:49] about this message but if they would
[1:47:51] just recognize that it's God's program
[1:47:53] of Escape for this hour am mean they're
[1:47:55] working they're really working but
[1:47:57] they're not working they're not
[1:47:58] accomplishing anything for the kingdom
[1:48:00] of God because they're working against
[1:48:02] God's program instead of for God's
[1:48:05] program and under God's program and in
[1:48:07] God's program today and mean is to
[1:48:09] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:12] and mean we're not meant to be led by
[1:48:14] man we're meant to be led by the Holy
[1:48:16] Spirit and God places men in his church
[1:48:19] that he might lead through them but he
[1:48:21] is the leader and mean I believe God's
[1:48:24] program is still to to to to to be
[1:48:26] dressed in Holiness and mean it might
[1:48:29] not be popular today but I still believe
[1:48:31] it's God's program and you know God's
[1:48:33] program is still that his word might
[1:48:35] come through a prophet in Amos 3:7 that
[1:48:38] he would do nothing until he reveals it
[1:48:40] first to his servants the prophets oh it
[1:48:43] might not be popular but it it's I
[1:48:45] believe it's popular in this church
[1:48:48] because it's God's program you see am
[1:48:50] mean they would try to uh brother would
[1:48:53] say that that's part of God's program
[1:48:55] preaching is his program oh my I mean
[1:48:58] there's a lot coming against preachers
[1:49:00] in this hour am mean saying we should
[1:49:02] just press Play Amen but what's God's
[1:49:05] program I hear a prophet says preaching
[1:49:07] is his program and he says God has so
[1:49:09] arranged it that his program cannot move
[1:49:12] without you and I and as long as we're
[1:49:15] not doing what God leads us to do we're
[1:49:17] paralyzing his program oh but when the
[1:49:20] church moves by the anointing of the
[1:49:22] Holy Ghost then we are in God's will
[1:49:25] doing his program amen amen amen we want
[1:49:28] the church to move along this morning
[1:49:30] but we've got to get in the program of
[1:49:32] God am mean so that the church might
[1:49:34] move along mean I don't want to be
[1:49:36] guilty of paralyzing the program of God
[1:49:39] everybody say Lord what have you called
[1:49:41] me to do what's your program for my life
[1:49:44] what's your will for my life what does
[1:49:46] this message say and how can I operate
[1:49:49] as a worker in the will of God to do the
[1:49:51] program of God and I believe it's God's
[1:49:54] program and mean I believe it's God's
[1:49:56] program to worship him oh you see
[1:49:59] there's a lot that would try to come
[1:50:00] against true worship in this hour and
[1:50:03] and the devil would try to use Satan's
[1:50:05] program to Rob worship from the Lord or
[1:50:08] to try to get people off in either
[1:50:10] formalism or fanaticism but I believe
[1:50:13] there's a bride and me that's walking in
[1:50:15] the program of God that worship God in
[1:50:18] spirit and in
[1:50:20] truth oh brother BR said when the Holy
[1:50:22] Ghost comes into the church and wants to
[1:50:24] bless the church people set just as cold
[1:50:26] and starchy that's the same thing the
[1:50:28] Pharisee did too busy with other things
[1:50:30] we got too much to do we're afraid we'll
[1:50:33] interrupt something don't worry he says
[1:50:35] you won't interrupt nothing when you're
[1:50:36] entertaining Jesus you'll be right in
[1:50:39] the program of God you might be out of
[1:50:41] man's program but you'll be in God's
[1:50:43] program when you're entertaining Jesus I
[1:50:46] think it's about time we get out of
[1:50:47] man's program and man trying to tell us
[1:50:50] what we should do and how we should
[1:50:52] worship
[1:50:53] and we could read this quote but don't
[1:50:55] read that quote and we can worship God
[1:50:56] this time but not that time and I say
[1:50:58] let's get in the program of God and
[1:51:01] worship God in spirit and truth and be
[1:51:03] the the the children he's called us to
[1:51:05] be oh friends I've been commissioned
[1:51:08] Amen to let everything that have breath
[1:51:10] praise the
[1:51:11] Lorden like that woman washing his feet
[1:51:15] amen that had an elbow through a bunch
[1:51:16] of of Pharisees and and Prestige and in
[1:51:21] denominational order to get to Jesus
[1:51:24] amen but brother Brandon would begin to
[1:51:26] say Amen that people get so worried
[1:51:28] about
[1:51:29] order me and he would begin to tell them
[1:51:31] I I hope they can get out of order long
[1:51:33] enough to get
[1:51:34] saved amen and and Satan's program
[1:51:39] trying to lock the people down until
[1:51:41] they're scared to hardly make a move
[1:51:44] amen amen but but you've got to break
[1:51:46] out of Satan's program to get into God's
[1:51:48] program and get saved and Worship the
[1:51:51] Lord oh I'm not talking about true order
[1:51:54] I'm talking about Satan trying to rob
[1:51:56] God of his worship and God of his praise
[1:51:58] amen and Satan always tries to twist
[1:52:01] God's program am mean because I believe
[1:52:03] it's God's program that that that men
[1:52:05] and Brethren ought to dwell together in
[1:52:07] unity amen and Satan of course would try
[1:52:09] to twist that and try to to bring in a
[1:52:12] world Council of churches and try to
[1:52:14] bring in a false Unity me but of course
[1:52:16] God's program of Fellowship is under the
[1:52:18] shed blood amen but under that shed
[1:52:21] blood Amen brother would say God has a
[1:52:23] program and that program is written in
[1:52:25] his word and his word said we should all
[1:52:27] be one all together not divided
[1:52:30] divisions and fusses and stews but we
[1:52:32] should be one Christ prayed that we
[1:52:35] would be one and he said this will all
[1:52:36] men know that you are my disciples when
[1:52:38] you have love one for the
[1:52:40] other oh my I believe it's God's program
[1:52:44] amen uh of course Satan would try to
[1:52:47] twist it into a false Unity but I
[1:52:49] believe brothers and sisters can dwell
[1:52:51] together in unity
[1:52:53] amen oh well sir you know you get wrong
[1:52:56] sometimes you get hurt but I believe
[1:52:58] that there is a way and that we could
[1:53:01] get the differences behind us and mean
[1:53:03] that that that we could leave the
[1:53:04] arguments at the door and mean I I don't
[1:53:06] believe I believe we want to be workers
[1:53:08] of his will not just a bunch of Fighters
[1:53:11] and mean not just getting up trying to
[1:53:12] fight with each other and fight with our
[1:53:14] neighbors and and fight with this church
[1:53:16] and that church and this pastor and that
[1:53:18] Pastor I mean but we want to be workers
[1:53:21] in the will of God Lord what can I do to
[1:53:23] help my brother and sister Lord what can
[1:53:25] I do to build him up Lord I don't want
[1:53:27] to talk bad about him Lord what can I do
[1:53:30] to try to help get them out of the rut
[1:53:31] that they're in they made a mistake but
[1:53:33] I don't want to spread it all over the
[1:53:35] church Lord what can I do can I pray for
[1:53:37] them can I go and get the pastor and
[1:53:39] talk to them Lord what can I do am me I
[1:53:41] don't want to do something to to fight
[1:53:43] against the will of God and and try to
[1:53:45] tear down and break up fellowship and
[1:53:48] and hurt somebody Lord I want to provoke
[1:53:50] my brothers and my sisters onto love and
[1:53:52] onto good works I I want to encourage
[1:53:55] them Lord amen to get back up and keep
[1:53:57] fighting cuz we need them in the program
[1:54:00] of of God we want to be about father's
[1:54:05] business
[1:54:06] amen as we bring it to a close here you
[1:54:10] see we can learn to
[1:54:12] follow the beat of the
[1:54:14] word praise the Lord because when you
[1:54:17] conf find God's program then you can
[1:54:20] stop you you you sometimes you feel like
[1:54:22] you're working and you're working but
[1:54:24] you're not getting anywhere you're not
[1:54:25] accomplishing anything but you check
[1:54:28] yourself Lord am I in your program and
[1:54:30] when you can find the program of God and
[1:54:32] you can follow the beat of the word man
[1:54:35] so when the word would say in Hebrews
[1:54:36] let us labor therefore to enter into his
[1:54:39] rest so you say what am I supposed to do
[1:54:42] am I supposed to labor or am I supposed
[1:54:43] to rest I mean but it's follow the beat
[1:54:46] of the word that's you labor when it's
[1:54:49] time to labor and then once you enter
[1:54:52] you rest when it's time to rest if
[1:54:54] you're seeking the Holy Ghost you repent
[1:54:57] and you be baptized but then you don't
[1:54:59] have to just beat an altar to get it
[1:55:02] from God he said repent be baptized and
[1:55:04] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:55:07] Ghost so you can find begin to find the
[1:55:10] channel of God that you can work and
[1:55:14] accomplish you see uh uh when Jesus come
[1:55:18] on the scene there would be many that
[1:55:20] would be baptized under repent
[1:55:22] repentance under John's baptism but then
[1:55:25] there come another time where they had
[1:55:26] to go and get re-baptized because they
[1:55:29] had to go get baptized in the name of
[1:55:30] the Lord Jesus Christ and today you
[1:55:33] could be baptized a thousand times under
[1:55:36] repentance and and and work and work and
[1:55:38] work but you're not accomplishing
[1:55:40] anything because that's not the word for
[1:55:42] this day you could try to go get
[1:55:45] purified under the blood of BS and goats
[1:55:47] and go out and sacrifice BS and goats
[1:55:50] all day long but God God has already
[1:55:52] sent a savior and shed his blood and
[1:55:55] entered in once and for all for your sin
[1:55:58] so so so it it would be work and vain it
[1:56:01] it it wouldn't be the program for today
[1:56:03] and and so today we're living in an
[1:56:06] astronaut Age and and you could try to
[1:56:09] get to the Moon with a horse and buggy
[1:56:13] but you're going to get pretty
[1:56:15] frustrated you could even try to get
[1:56:17] there with an airplane and you could fly
[1:56:19] around all day long trying to break into
[1:56:21] that orbit and but good luck getting to
[1:56:24] the Moon because that's not the program
[1:56:26] for this day you got to get in the
[1:56:29] spaceship and so you see
[1:56:32] me maybe some maybe not right now but
[1:56:35] maybe in the summertime you go to cut
[1:56:37] your lawn and you could go out there
[1:56:39] with a pair of scissors and you or you
[1:56:42] could take a herd of goats out there or
[1:56:44] you could try to one of those little SC
[1:56:46] things and try to cut your grass but
[1:56:48] it's going to be a lot more work but
[1:56:49] we're living in the age of the right
[1:56:52] riding lawn
[1:56:53] mower amen so you can take you can take
[1:56:57] your scissors out there and you can work
[1:56:58] all day long brother but instead of
[1:57:01] working you can just pull out your
[1:57:02] riding lawnmower and begin to ride on
[1:57:06] the on the word for this day
[1:57:09] amen and it reminds me of that Paul
[1:57:12] Raider me trying to cut down that tree
[1:57:15] and getting tired and getting weak and
[1:57:17] running out of strength am me but that
[1:57:19] voice of the boss would tell him Paul
[1:57:21] why don't you just roll it down to that
[1:57:23] River over there and start riding on it
[1:57:25] anden you see you can work and work and
[1:57:27] work and get so frustrated anden but why
[1:57:30] don't you just start riding on the
[1:57:32] program of God and Me in the program of
[1:57:34] God and mean you could try to pull
[1:57:36] yourself up by the bootstraps to get
[1:57:38] into this Rapture amen but if the same
[1:57:40] spirit that dwells in you quickens your
[1:57:42] mortal body it shall Quicken your mortal
[1:57:45] body I mean you could try to you could
[1:57:47] you you could fret and stew and fuss all
[1:57:50] day long about your children amen but
[1:57:52] the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:57:54] Christ and thy and thy house shall be
[1:57:56] saved amen so instead of working and
[1:57:58] working and working just get under the
[1:58:00] program for go for of God oh and begin
[1:58:04] to follow the beat of the word you you
[1:58:06] you could try to keep yourself day in
[1:58:09] and day night day in and uh uh and day
[1:58:13] out amen but when God seals you with the
[1:58:16] Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that sealed
[1:58:19] you anden brother Brandon would say uh
[1:58:22] uh what is this the seal first thing it
[1:58:25] shows is a work that has been completed
[1:58:27] a completed work the next thing it shows
[1:58:29] is ownership and the next thing it shows
[1:58:32] is security keeping it so you can try to
[1:58:35] keep yourself but get in the program of
[1:58:38] God and you get the Holy Ghost and it'll
[1:58:41] keep you you won't you you you won't
[1:58:43] have to do it in your own ability just
[1:58:45] it's the program of God oh my brother B
[1:58:49] said I believe the honest in heart wants
[1:58:50] to see something real
[1:58:52] words are fine but will that word work
[1:58:55] if God made a promise of healing will it
[1:58:57] work if he made these promises will it
[1:59:00] work he said the things that I do shall
[1:59:01] you do also and more than this cuz I go
[1:59:03] to my father would it work well I'll
[1:59:07] tell you this it worked for Jesus and
[1:59:09] mean because brother Brandon would tell
[1:59:11] us the word was in the word right the
[1:59:14] current was in The Wire and this bride
[1:59:17] is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:59:20] and brother Brandon would tell us the
[1:59:22] word is in the bride in the mind of
[1:59:25] Christ to know what he's once done with
[1:59:27] his word amen and and so as as the
[1:59:30] musicians come brother brandom said
[1:59:33] Satan's wire had no current in it it was
[1:59:35] dead Creeds it it won't current now you
[1:59:38] see on the on on the Temptation on the
[1:59:40] mount and mean Satan used scripture
[1:59:43] against the Lord and the Lord would
[1:59:45] respond it is also written and so it
[1:59:48] says it's the same wire Jesus used the
[1:59:50] father's word Satan used the father's
[1:59:52] word Satan was Satan Jesus was God
[1:59:55] that's the
[1:59:56] difference see it comes down to those
[1:59:59] right there those two seeds he said
[2:00:01] that's the true one is the Creed the
[2:00:02] other one is the word one is true and
[2:00:05] the other one is false one will produce
[2:00:07] it and the other one can't produce it do
[2:00:09] you get it same kind of wires now that's
[2:00:12] exactly right same
[2:00:14] wires Hebrews 2 we just got or Hebrews
[2:00:16] 4:2 we just got it like denominational
[2:00:18] like denominations Say by wisdom see
[2:00:20] denominations by wisdom says this the
[2:00:23] days of the current is passed you see I
[2:00:27] I if it's wired up wrong it will never
[2:00:29] work right you you could take a good
[2:00:31] wire and plug it in a bad outlet and you
[2:00:33] won't get no life I mean but if you
[2:00:35] could ever get it wired right I mean you
[2:00:37] you could ever get that word restored
[2:00:40] and placed in the bride and she's got
[2:00:43] the right ground she's grounded in
[2:00:44] Christ her faith is rooted and grounded
[2:00:47] in the word then it will produce what it
[2:00:50] said it will produce I me the word will
[2:00:52] work you see brother Brandon preached
[2:00:55] the message trying to do God a service
[2:00:57] without being in the will of God and he
[2:00:59] began to show that David tried to bring
[2:01:02] the
[2:01:03] ark back but he consulted the captains
[2:01:07] of hundreds and thousands and not the
[2:01:09] prophet Nathan that stood in the midst
[2:01:12] and so it was a true Revelation but it
[2:01:14] was wrong because it it wasn't God's
[2:01:17] channel for that work and so brother
[2:01:21] Brandon would begin to tell us that the
[2:01:22] word of the Lord sometimes he said you
[2:01:25] have to put it in the right place or
[2:01:27] it's not the will of the Lord see though
[2:01:29] it's the word of the Lord but he said
[2:01:31] let that soak deep and you'll get a
[2:01:32] general conception of what I'm trying to
[2:01:33] say and begins to show that it it a
[2:01:38] church couldn't place he said now he
[2:01:42] never does nothing except he first
[2:01:43] reveals it to his servants the prophet
[2:01:44] so he said there's no church no
[2:01:46] Methodist Baptist Pentecostals or
[2:01:48] anything else can ever put this church
[2:01:50] into the bride it'll have to be the
[2:01:52] answering of Malachi 4 for God to send a
[2:01:55] prophet to be revealed
[2:01:57] to so here it was here we were like
[2:02:02] Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison
[2:02:05] Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity
[2:02:08] amen is that right but it it wasn't
[2:02:10] doing no good until they discovered how
[2:02:13] to harness it and make it work and put
[2:02:17] lights throughout this building so there
[2:02:19] had to be a Thomas Edison come along
[2:02:21] yeah begin to harness it and say I'll
[2:02:23] put this wire here and I'll put this
[2:02:25] wire here and this wire here and this
[2:02:27] ground here and then boom there's light
[2:02:31] amen and brother Brandon would come
[2:02:33] along and here they are those
[2:02:35] Pentecostals begin to discover the power
[2:02:38] of God but they would just blow it all
[2:02:41] off as Steam they weren't interested in
[2:02:43] Father's work they weren't about the
[2:02:46] father's business and mean they instead
[2:02:49] of taking that and making it work they
[2:02:51] would blow it all off a steam maybe they
[2:02:54] would get a hold of that anointing and
[2:02:55] say well let's go empty all the
[2:02:57] hospitals and let's go do this and that
[2:03:00] but they didn't maybe take the time to
[2:03:02] really say Lord what is your will what
[2:03:05] is father's business for this message
[2:03:08] amen but we could find that father's
[2:03:11] business would be to see this word be
[2:03:14] Vindicated Amen in a people Amen to
[2:03:17] vindicate Malachi 4 to vindicate Luke 17
[2:03:20] to vindicate in the word for this day
[2:03:23] that somebody wouldn't just blow it all
[2:03:25] off as Steam but somebody would get that
[2:03:27] word inside and begin to channel it that
[2:03:30] it could work so a prophet comes on the
[2:03:32] scene and he says you know since I was
[2:03:34] young I I've always believed you know in
[2:03:37] the power of God and there's enough
[2:03:39] power in this building right now but the
[2:03:40] thing of it is can we find the right
[2:03:43] wire to current it to you and he would
[2:03:45] begin to say in all my time searching
[2:03:48] wires I've only found two wires that'll
[2:03:50] bring the power of God visible and
[2:03:52] Divine Healing and things and he said
[2:03:54] it's two wires it's love and it's faith
[2:03:57] will bring the power of God visible you
[2:03:59] see the power exists already in this
[2:04:01] building but a prophet would come along
[2:04:03] and say here you are if you just connect
[2:04:06] this and if you just get love and if you
[2:04:08] just get Faith it'll make that word work
[2:04:10] it'll produce healing it'll produce
[2:04:12] salvation and a Prophet come along and
[2:04:15] here was a church that had begin to
[2:04:17] receive the pouring out of the spirit
[2:04:19] and a prophet begin to place it and say
[2:04:21] here you are and me a a pastor you go to
[2:04:24] this position and a a prophet's in this
[2:04:26] position and and a pastor doesn't tell a
[2:04:29] prophet what to do and an evangelist
[2:04:31] doesn't tell a pastor what to do and
[2:04:32] what was going on a church was beginning
[2:04:34] to be placed wires were beginning to be
[2:04:37] placed here and here and all of a sudden
[2:04:40] oh there's a bride on the earth that
[2:04:42] this message is not just a form of
[2:04:44] godliness but the power thereof begin to
[2:04:47] explode and all a sudden the lights come
[2:04:49] on oh there's a bride amen that's about
[2:04:52] the father's business and the word works
[2:04:55] for her because the word is in the word
[2:04:57] the current is in the wire amen
[2:05:00] producing a
[2:05:01] bride oh that could be a worker in his
[2:05:04] will could we stand our feet this
[2:05:07] morning oh we don't want selfish
[2:05:10] motives we just need some real
[2:05:13] workers that'll get under this
[2:05:17] message and and keep the sayings of this
[2:05:19] message you see wise man built his house
[2:05:23] upon a rock and there come one day a
[2:05:26] rich young
[2:05:27] ruler who had kept all the Commandments
[2:05:30] of God but when he come to a junction
[2:05:32] where he was standing before the word
[2:05:33] and the word said forsake all and sell
[2:05:36] all that you have and give it to the
[2:05:38] poor take up your cross and follow me
[2:05:40] then that saying was too hard for
[2:05:43] him but there was another Rich Young
[2:05:45] Ruler named Moses who accepted the
[2:05:49] leadership of the word and when he come
[2:05:52] down to the end of his Road brother
[2:05:55] brandom talked about that Rich Young
[2:05:56] Ruler he said when he come to down to
[2:05:57] the end of his Road there was nowhere to
[2:05:59] step he'd refuseed leadership but when
[2:06:02] Moses come down to the end of the road
[2:06:05] he said he talks about how his
[2:06:06] leadership was right there his
[2:06:08] leadership The Rock and he could step
[2:06:10] right onto that rock Christ oh and when
[2:06:13] there was no
[2:06:14] Egypt when there was no task Masters
[2:06:17] when there was no more bricks and straw
[2:06:20] still there will be a Moses because
[2:06:23] Moses accepted the leadership and he was
[2:06:27] built upon a rock and me and we have
[2:06:30] received a leadership in this hour amen
[2:06:34] and it brother brandom me he spoke not
[2:06:37] as the scribes but as one having
[2:06:40] Authority and me because it was more
[2:06:42] than a man it was the son of man a son
[2:06:45] of man revealing the son of man a word
[2:06:48] of authority that has come into our AIDs
[2:06:50] that if we'll just keep the sayings of
[2:06:53] this word I believe it's the leadership
[2:06:55] that'll get us beyond the curtain of
[2:06:57] time I believe it's the leadership
[2:06:59] that'll get us there on that day that's
[2:07:01] right say Lord I don't just want to keep
[2:07:03] the easy sayings I want to keep all of
[2:07:05] the sayings I don't just want to keep
[2:07:07] some of them but when it really Pricks
[2:07:09] my heart when it really Cuts deep I want
[2:07:12] to keep those ones too Lord and maybe we
[2:07:15] could just all bow our heads just as we
[2:07:17] close in
[2:07:18] prayer believe we need some real workers
[2:07:22] like David's mighty men that would be
[2:07:25] about the father's
[2:07:26] business that his his least desire would
[2:07:30] be our Command say Lord if you want
[2:07:33] somebody to believe every word here am I
[2:07:37] Lord Lord your least desire is my
[2:07:39] command if you want somebody to to to
[2:07:42] forgive and ask for forgiveness here am
[2:07:44] I Lord if you want somebody Lord to
[2:07:47] stand and preach the gospel unashamed
[2:07:50] and not add or take away here am I Lord
[2:07:53] Lord I want to be a worker in your will
[2:07:56] Lord maybe I've got off the road but I
[2:07:59] want to Center myself back in the will
[2:08:01] of God oh and the Bible brother Brandon
[2:08:04] would tell us that whosoever shall keep
[2:08:05] all these Commandments and do these
[2:08:07] things will have a right to the tree of
[2:08:09] life amen so don't be weary and
[2:08:11] well-doing
[2:08:12] now's not the time to be weary and well
[2:08:15] doing but as the
[2:08:17] prophet would have that because you have
[2:08:19] chosen the narrow path in the heart
[2:08:21] harder way thou has walked of your own
[2:08:23] choosing but it would tell them you have
[2:08:25] picked the correct and precise decision
[2:08:28] and it is my way and because of that
[2:08:31] momentous decision a huge portion of
[2:08:33] Heaven awaits thee Oh My on that day I
[2:08:37] believe there will be a people who won't
[2:08:39] hear the words depart from me ye that
[2:08:42] work iniquity
[2:08:44] iniquity and me but enter into the joys
[2:08:46] of the lord well done good and faithful
[2:08:49] servant
[2:08:51] and when brother brandom
[2:08:53] said as we as every eyes closed and
[2:08:57] every head is
[2:09:00] bowed he he in the Ephesian Church age
[2:09:02] he says if God had that against this
[2:09:04] church he's got it against that one too
[2:09:06] because you left your first love I've
[2:09:09] got it against you I have something
[2:09:10] against you that's my complaint you once
[2:09:12] had a great time but you let the world
[2:09:14] begin to creep in and you got to acting
[2:09:17] a little formal you're still holding my
[2:09:19] name you're still doing the things
[2:09:20] that's right you got a lot of patience
[2:09:22] and so forth and you labor you're like a
[2:09:24] mule you just labor and work he says my
[2:09:27] my my see you've left Grace and Faith
[2:09:30] and power to swap it for labor and works
[2:09:34] well I tell you brother brandom I help
[2:09:35] every widow woman I can well that's a
[2:09:38] good thing I commend you for that but
[2:09:40] where's that first love you once had
[2:09:42] where's that Joy you used to have as
[2:09:44] David once cried oh Lord restore to me
[2:09:47] the joy of my salvation where's them all
[2:09:49] night prayer meetings and tears on your
[2:09:51] cheeks my goodness the Bible's even
[2:09:53] Dusty got cobwebs on it you read old
[2:09:56] love stories and news and things and
[2:09:57] things that oughtn't to even be allowed
[2:09:59] to be published and put out for a trash
[2:10:02] can and we Pentecostal people picked
[2:10:04] them up and just Loft over them like a
[2:10:06] bunch of flies on a garbage can he says
[2:10:08] that's right oh mercy what we need is
[2:10:10] back to our first love back to
[2:10:14] Pentecost amen maybe that's where am me
[2:10:17] your desire this morning
[2:10:19] Lord I want to be a
[2:10:22] worker but Lord I I've let distractions
[2:10:25] get in my way I maybe I I've got a
[2:10:28] little away Lord and I pray Lord that
[2:10:31] you restore the joy of my
[2:10:33] salvation Lord that you restore the
[2:10:35] first love I I I've got to where it's
[2:10:38] just works just going through the
[2:10:40] motions sometimes it feels like and Lord
[2:10:43] I want to get back that
[2:10:44] feeling I want to get back that where
[2:10:47] the presence of God comes down in my
[2:10:49] home in my car
[2:10:53] amen God bless the hands let's
[2:10:56] pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[2:10:58] for your mercy and your grace this
[2:11:01] morning Lord what a wonderful
[2:11:03] congregation
[2:11:04] father Lord it just so wonderful Lord to
[2:11:07] preach this word to them Father just
[2:11:11] Lord what a great caliber of
[2:11:13] people and father each one of us Lord
[2:11:16] desire to be closer to you
[2:11:18] Lord sometimes we get off the beaten
[2:11:20] path we we get distracted with work Lord
[2:11:24] we're workers and sometimes we get
[2:11:26] distracted with the work father but may
[2:11:29] we never forget Lord that you want us on
[2:11:32] the altar Lord you want our time Lord
[2:11:35] you want our fellowship you want our
[2:11:38] worship Lord may we never get so
[2:11:40] distracted with the
[2:11:42] emotions of the work Lord that we fail
[2:11:45] to give you the praise and the the honor
[2:11:48] that you deserve Lord and we begin to
[2:11:50] lose sight Lord your presence becomes a
[2:11:52] little distant from us father I pray
[2:11:54] that you restore Joy I pray you restore
[2:11:58] close walks Lord with each individual
[2:12:00] Lord that's my desire a closer walk with
[2:12:02] you father Lord we want to start right
[2:12:06] if there be one in here this morning
[2:12:08] that's not Lord maybe they're not even
[2:12:10] got on the right foundation maybe
[2:12:12] they're Lord not even got the Holy Ghost
[2:12:15] but father I believe Lord there's not
[2:12:18] Lord there's no better time like now
[2:12:20] than to start right
[2:12:23] Lord sometimes it looks so daunting
[2:12:25] father this Christian walk seems
[2:12:28] like Lord we see the pastor and it seems
[2:12:31] like he's so far in a walk but Lord how
[2:12:36] did he get there Lord he had to take the
[2:12:38] first step and then he had to take the
[2:12:40] second step and by the leadership of the
[2:12:45] message of the hour it could take him to
[2:12:47] where he's at and father maybe there's
[2:12:49] one here this morning
[2:12:52] that needs to take that first step maybe
[2:12:55] some need to take that second step that
[2:12:57] third step but Lord May everyone no
[2:13:01] matter where they're at help us Lord
[2:13:03] that if we just follow the leadership of
[2:13:06] the program of God for this day Lord I
[2:13:10] believe it'll take us all the way
[2:13:12] home may you grant it Lord and bless
[2:13:14] this congregation today in the name of
[2:13:16] Jesus
