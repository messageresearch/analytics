[38:55] 12:8
[38:58] the Bible says but now hath God set the
[39:00] members every one of them in the body as
[39:03] it hath pleased him and if they were all
[39:06] one member where were the body but now
[39:09] are they many members yet but one body
[39:13] and the eye cannot say unto the hand I
[39:15] have no need of thee nor again the head
[39:17] to the feet I have no need of you nay
[39:20] much more those members of the body
[39:22] which seem to be more feeble are
[39:25] necessary and those members of the body
[39:27] which we think to be less honorable upon
[39:30] these we bestow more abundant honor and
[39:33] our uncomely parts have more abundant
[39:36] comeliness for our comely Parts have no
[39:38] need but God hath tempered the body
[39:40] together having given more abundant
[39:42] honor to that partch which lacked that
[39:44] there should be no Schism in the body oh
[39:47] yes Lord but that the members should
[39:49] have the same care one for another amen
[39:53] could we also read Ephesians chapter 3
[39:55] before we pray
[39:56] [Music]
[40:06] Ephesians chapter 3:
[40:12] 8-9 he says uh unto me who am less than
[40:17] the least of All Saints is this Grace
[40:19] given that I should preach among the
[40:21] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[40:23] Christ and to make all men see what is
[40:26] The Fellowship of the mystery and here's
[40:29] where I want to take my text this word
[40:31] Fellowship is often translated as
[40:34] economy it's a word that means it speaks
[40:36] of an interchange it speaks of a of a of
[40:39] sort of a group experience where
[40:40] everybody contributes and everybody
[40:42] receives it's the economy of the mystery
[40:45] so I'd like to preach this morning on
[40:46] God's economy Amen to make all men see
[40:49] what is the fellowship or the economy of
[40:51] the mystery which from the beginning of
[40:54] the world hath been hidden God who
[40:55] created All Things by Jesus Christ amen
[41:00] let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord I I
[41:03] pray Lord as we look into your word this
[41:05] morning Father you just come amongst us
[41:08] Lord and I just I just feel in my heart
[41:11] Lord that you got something very
[41:13] specific Lord you want to accomplish
[41:16] this morning Lord I I feel the push I
[41:18] feel the drive Lord of your purpose
[41:20] today I pray Lord you would just connect
[41:23] the dots today Father we're helpless in
[41:25] our human Lord to cause anything to
[41:28] happen today but Lord we're just fully
[41:30] trusting in your spirit to Quicken The
[41:32] Word of Life father Quicken our ears to
[41:34] understand Lord anoint us we pray that
[41:36] Lord we could just have a Clear Vision I
[41:38] pray Lord if there'd be someone here
[41:40] today Lord battling father with those
[41:42] thoughts of insufficiency Lord
[41:45] insecurity Lord uh uh uh uh inferiority
[41:49] father Lord may you just Minister by
[41:51] Your Word until each one of us Lord
[41:53] would leave this place with a boldness
[41:55] father knowing where we stand stand Lord
[41:57] in your purpose and your predestinated
[41:59] calling for this day Lord knowing that
[42:01] each one has value in your economy Lord
[42:04] we just commit ourselves we commit this
[42:06] service to you in the name of Jesus
[42:08] Christ amen amen God bless you as you're
[42:10] seated today amen good to be with you
[42:13] again last time we were together uh a
[42:16] few months ago I was ministering on uh
[42:19] on it's not robbery and if you if you
[42:21] don't remember that I don't blame you
[42:23] that's been a few months longer than I
[42:25] usually remember what's been preached
[42:26] lately but but uh this is a little bit
[42:29] of a part two to that thought and along
[42:31] in those lines and and uh just to recap
[42:34] that for a moment we find that that uh
[42:38] that there's this great mystery amen
[42:40] that's unfolding right in this present
[42:42] day amen right in this Leo ofan age
[42:45] there is a there is a there's this great
[42:47] drama that God has has instituted and
[42:50] and uh and God we find us changes Mass
[42:53] from ages to ages to uh tell this great
[42:55] story of redemption and acted out and
[42:58] caus us to just to just uh be able to
[43:01] receive the revelation of of what was in
[43:03] his heart and and uh and and and his
[43:06] love for for his Fallen sons and
[43:08] daughters and his desire to restore us
[43:10] back to fellowship it's a it's a great
[43:12] drama and and and and Christ is
[43:14] revealing this drama amen but today he's
[43:17] masked not in a messenger not in a
[43:20] prophet not in the body that he walked
[43:22] the shores of Galilee but today he's
[43:24] wearing the mask amen of individual
[43:27] human beings in this time amen that were
[43:30] predestinated to stand here you were
[43:32] predestinated to sit here in church this
[43:34] morning Amen to receive the revelation
[43:37] of this message it would open your eyes
[43:38] to realize that you're not just
[43:40] witnessing this drama but you're
[43:41] actually playing it out because God the
[43:44] great actor is getting behind the mask
[43:46] of your life of your body and he's and
[43:49] that what you are experiencing in your
[43:51] Christian Life is only is is further
[43:54] unveiling the mystery that was in him
[43:55] before the foundation of the world is
[43:57] that right amen it's a mystery amen but
[44:00] it's a many-membered mystery and it's a
[44:02] and it's unfolding in many lives and
[44:04] many situations and many people amen
[44:06] that God is revealing himself through
[44:08] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and
[44:10] that's the that's the full revelation of
[44:12] this message is not just God revealing
[44:14] himself in in a prophet or the ministry
[44:17] amen of a Kentucky hillbilly but but but
[44:20] uh he's got some Ohio Hillbillies amen
[44:22] and and he's got some farmers and he's
[44:24] got some Factory workers and he's got
[44:25] some mothers and he's got some engineers
[44:27] and he's got some maybe he's got some
[44:29] lawyers even amen that that that he has
[44:31] called and he has chosen them for this
[44:33] day so that he could amen the things
[44:35] that he thought in his mind before the
[44:37] foundation of the world could become a
[44:38] spoken word reality in this day amen and
[44:41] that is what you were called to be you
[44:43] are called to be the Fulfillment of the
[44:45] mystery of God Amen this mysterious
[44:48] purpose that he had in his mind before
[44:49] the foundation of the world Amen are we
[44:52] on the same page there amen amen and so
[44:55] that makes you as an individual a very
[44:57] very special person and it makes the
[45:00] role that you play in the kingdom of God
[45:02] very very vital and very very important
[45:04] because this mystery we find in the
[45:06] scripture amen is going to be an economy
[45:09] amen it's going to be an economy and and
[45:12] the uh uh you know we live we know
[45:14] naturally how the way that we think of
[45:16] an economy you know we're we're living
[45:17] in one wherever human beings are
[45:20] gathered together there's an economy
[45:21] right there's a there's a sell there's a
[45:23] trade and there's a there's a buy and
[45:25] there's a sell and amen and and there's
[45:27] there's an interchange you know that and
[45:30] you'll find that you know uh you cannot
[45:32] separate yourself from it right you
[45:34] can't you can't just decide well I'm
[45:36] just G to I'm just going to you know
[45:37] forget the whole economy I'm going to go
[45:39] start a homestead somewhere and you know
[45:41] I'm going to grow all my own food and do
[45:42] all those kind of thing no somewhere or
[45:44] later you're going to find something
[45:45] that you lack isn't that right amen
[45:47] sooner or later you're going to have to
[45:48] run down to Walmart and get something
[45:50] for your little Homestead or or you're
[45:52] going to have to pay taxes to somewhere
[45:54] you can't get away from it right amen
[45:56] because that's it it takes everybody to
[45:58] make an economy work you know when you
[46:00] get into your car somebody had to mine
[46:01] the ore and somebody had to refine the
[46:03] iron and somebody had to drill the oil
[46:05] and somebody had to put it together and
[46:07] somebody had to do the paint job and
[46:09] somebody everybody had to contribute
[46:11] something is that right amen and you've
[46:13] got to work and you've got to earn and
[46:14] you've got to be part of this thing so
[46:17] that's the great thing about an economy
[46:19] participation is not an option amen and
[46:22] that goes for naturally speaking but
[46:23] that's spiritual too brother sister
[46:25] particip ipation in the economy of the
[46:27] mystery of God is not an option it's
[46:30] going to take you it's you can't just
[46:31] sit around and be a consumer amen you've
[46:34] got to supply something Amen to the
[46:36] economy of God you're you're raised up
[46:38] for a purpose you don't just come you
[46:40] God didn't just raise you up to sit in
[46:42] church and hear singing and hear
[46:44] preaching and consume teaching and
[46:46] consume Ministry and consume gifts amen
[46:49] but he called you to be part of this
[46:51] assembly Amen to be to live in this time
[46:53] and have the spirit of God within you to
[46:55] make you part amen of the revelation of
[46:58] the mystery of God there are things that
[47:00] he put in you and he and he instilled
[47:02] them there amen and he took little
[47:04] little pieces of his mystery and he hid
[47:06] it in individual lives amen so that when
[47:09] we would come together every joint would
[47:11] Supply and it would create the body of
[47:13] Christ living on the earth fulfilling
[47:15] himself and revealing himself oh my amen
[47:18] participation not an option brother
[47:20] sister brother BR said that you you you
[47:23] say me yeah no you were a son or a
[47:26] daughter of God before there was a moon
[47:29] stars or a molecule amen you were Sons
[47:32] and Daughters of God because you're only
[47:35] a physical manifestation of the
[47:37] attributes that were in God at the
[47:39] beginning amen for there's only one form
[47:42] of eternal life and that was you before
[47:45] amen that was you before amen the only
[47:48] form of eternal life you were in the
[47:50] image of God you were made and he said
[47:52] you were manifested for the glory and
[47:54] the fellowship ship of God hallelujah
[47:58] amen and therefore as sure as your Gene
[48:01] had to be in your father before your
[48:02] natural birth he said your spiritual
[48:05] Gene it had to be in God because you're
[48:08] an expression of the attributes of his
[48:11] thoughts before the foundation of the
[48:13] world Amen I like what brother Bram says
[48:16] right here he says no way around it
[48:19] there's no way around it participation
[48:21] is not an option brother sister amen
[48:23] when God thought you in his mind before
[48:25] the foundation of the world and chose
[48:27] you in himself amen then there was no
[48:30] helping it there was no avoiding it you
[48:32] might have fought with it you might have
[48:33] ran from it amen but there was an
[48:35] appointed time and an appointed place
[48:37] when what was in God's mind would become
[48:39] spoken word and he would Quicken it to
[48:41] pass in your life and make you part of
[48:43] the revelation of who he is you're not a
[48:46] nobody you're not just a consumer you're
[48:48] not called to just be a benchwarmer
[48:50] you're part of the revelation of God
[48:53] hallelujah amen no way around it you've
[48:56] got to be part of the unveiling amen and
[48:59] especially in this day you can't get
[49:01] around it brother sister sooner or later
[49:03] what is in you has got to be manifested
[49:06] because the seventh Angel's message is
[49:08] to reveal the whole
[49:11] mystery the whole mystery amen amen it's
[49:14] the so we're living in that time we're
[49:16] living in the big reveal amen It's the
[49:18] final unmasking every single attribute
[49:21] has got to be revealed manifesting time
[49:23] one way or the other whatever seed is in
[49:25] you is going to prove itself it's going
[49:27] to bear fruit amen oh my but brother
[49:30] sister amen there was a mystery to be
[49:33] revealed in this end time and do you
[49:35] realize that the that the ministry of
[49:37] the seventh angel was to reveal all the
[49:39] mysteries of God Amen but see just the
[49:42] Seven Seals and the third pole and the
[49:44] right water baptism and the revelation
[49:45] of the godhead that wasn't all the
[49:47] mystery that was in God Amen but you
[49:49] know there were many attributes that
[49:51] were in him at the beginning one of them
[49:52] was named Ry Hernandez Hallelujah don't
[49:55] you you believe that brother Ray I
[49:56] believe that I believe that God had an
[49:58] attribute in him before the beginning
[50:01] now right now it does not yet appear
[50:03] what Ray Hernandez will be but it's more
[50:05] clear now than it was at the beginning
[50:07] amen cuz it's been spoken hallelujah
[50:10] amen there was an attribute called
[50:11] Nathan Ericson now Nathan Ericson is not
[50:13] what he ought to be Nathan Ericson's not
[50:16] definitely not what he wants to be amen
[50:18] but neither am I used to be what I used
[50:20] to be but I'm becoming what I was amen
[50:23] because there was a picture in the mind
[50:24] of God and he forsaw me he forsaw you he
[50:27] knew what he wanted to get out of you he
[50:29] knew the purpose for which he would
[50:30] raise you up amen it was a mystery then
[50:33] but it's not a mystery now brother
[50:35] sister and the sooner or later we wake
[50:37] up to what this message is trying to get
[50:38] across amen and I realize that it's not
[50:41] just a revelation of Doctrine it's not
[50:43] just a revelation of what church you
[50:45] should belong to or what prophet you
[50:47] should listen to but it is the
[50:49] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[50:51] the individual Hallelujah where he
[50:54] become where he reveals himself to you
[50:56] that you have been raised up in this day
[50:58] amen to unveil an attribute of the
[51:01] mystery of God Amen and what we didn't
[51:04] know about God yesterday we know a
[51:06] little more today because it's been
[51:08] spoken and it's being lived out right in
[51:11] front of us in brothers and sisters and
[51:13] even in ourselves what a beautiful
[51:16] message amen hallelujah the mystery
[51:19] revealed now brother Bram said now the
[51:21] lamb he begins to explain that there's a
[51:24] time of intercession right amen and and
[51:27] how the lamb is he's at that throne and
[51:30] he's pleading and pleading the blood you
[51:31] know and and and and he's doing a work
[51:34] of intercession amen for for everyone
[51:37] amen but you see he's still he's still
[51:40] on The Mercy Seat he's still on The
[51:42] Mercy Seat why amen you ever ask
[51:44] yourself I preached many times you know
[51:46] you got to think sometimes what are we
[51:48] still doing here Jesus Christ died for
[51:50] our sins 2,000 years ago he shed his
[51:53] blood for all sin for for all mistake he
[51:56] don't have to come back and die again
[51:57] with by one sacrifice amen he has ripped
[52:00] the veil amen and restored us back amen
[52:03] it's it's it's a it's a perfect
[52:05] sacrifice so why 2,000 years later are
[52:08] there are we still here and time's still
[52:11] going on and world events are circling
[52:13] around us what's it all about brother
[52:15] sister a mystery amen because when Jesus
[52:17] Christ walked the Earth and even when he
[52:19] hung on the cross the mystery wasn't
[52:21] finished then it wasn't finished when he
[52:23] went to the Grave amen but when he fell
[52:25] down on the day of Pentecost and begin
[52:27] to in inhabit amen individual
[52:30] Tabernacles with with aspects or
[52:33] attributes of his glory when he busted
[52:35] that Pillar of Fire up and put it into
[52:37] men and women age after age building
[52:39] back to what the Bride of Jesus Christ
[52:42] amen amen like Eve was a mystery in Adam
[52:44] the bride was a m mystery in him but
[52:47] we're living in the day amen when the
[52:49] mystery amen is finished it's open it's
[52:53] revealed you say what was God thinking
[52:55] about before the foundation of the world
[52:58] look in a
[52:59] mirror
[53:01] hallelujah hallelujah amen so he's doing
[53:04] a work of intercession for all these
[53:06] years why because the mystery never
[53:07] stopped
[53:08] unfolding amen and it hasn't stopped yet
[53:11] brother sister because brother Bram said
[53:13] as long as there were names on that book
[53:16] he said there he knew there were names
[53:18] in there that were put there from the
[53:20] foundation of the world and as long as
[53:22] those names have never been manifested
[53:24] on Earth as yet he had to stay there as
[53:26] an intercessor as long as there was one
[53:28] name that had never been declared Christ
[53:31] had to stay there as an intercessor and
[53:33] take care of that name Hallelujah
[53:36] there's no way around that brother
[53:37] sister if you're on his book you're
[53:39] going to have to be expressed amen
[53:42] you're going to have to come forth
[53:43] that's why he couldn't come 2,000 years
[53:45] ago that's why he didn't come in 1977
[53:47] cuz there were more names on the
[53:50] bookall amen but here we are amen the
[53:53] bride the the literal spoken word seed
[53:57] bride Hallelujah and he said Christ
[54:00] stays there as an intercessor to take
[54:02] care of that name I'm so glad about that
[54:05] that he takes care of those names
[54:06] brother sister he takes care of you he
[54:09] takes care of me not cuz we deserve it
[54:11] not because we return the favor with a
[54:13] perfect religious life but because of a
[54:17] Eternal thought that was in his mind you
[54:18] can't be separated from him amen if you
[54:21] were in his mind that you're in his mind
[54:23] for eternity all of God's thoughts are
[54:25] Eternal and if you and if you were
[54:28] divorced from him he would not no longer
[54:30] be a perfect God so he's jealous that's
[54:33] why he's jealous over you that's why
[54:35] many things you didn't deserve amen amen
[54:38] like they say uh Grace is when you don't
[54:41] deserve something and but you get it
[54:43] anyway Mercy's when you did deserve
[54:45] judgment but you didn't get it amen
[54:47] there were things we didn't deserve
[54:48] things we did deserve amen but grace and
[54:51] mercy has kept you and watched over you
[54:54] why amen because the mystery of God has
[54:57] got to be told it's got to be revealed
[55:00] amen if we could tap into the spirit
[55:02] behind this message then we would see
[55:04] the Zeal of God to perform this amen we
[55:07] would begin we would understand more
[55:09] clearly what it is that drives us to him
[55:12] amen what it is that what the passion in
[55:14] the heart of God to see himself revealed
[55:17] and manifested in individual lives we
[55:20] would understand more his love for us if
[55:22] we would just listen to his word and
[55:24] realize amen that every name every
[55:27] name's got to be manifested every seed's
[55:29] got to be bear
[55:31] fruit Hallelujah no way around it amen
[55:35] so you can't be a halfway you can't just
[55:38] be halfway in this message halfway
[55:40] out a this is an Allin this is a this is
[55:43] to the end my friend amen it's got to be
[55:45] manifested it's got to be fulfilled
[55:48] Hallelujah there's there's a there's a
[55:49] sovereignty of God behind it taking us
[55:52] to our destination you say oh brother
[55:54] Nathan I made a mistake I got out in the
[55:56] permissive will of God brother Bram said
[55:58] amen that the permissive will of God
[55:59] will always come back to glorify his
[56:03] perfect will amen you think you're
[56:05] strong enough in your humanity and your
[56:07] error and your failure and your weakness
[56:09] to get past the grace of God Amen the
[56:11] grace of God is an omnipotent Force amen
[56:14] and it is driving driving driving down
[56:16] through the pages of History so that the
[56:18] mystery of God could be fulfilled and
[56:21] revealed in this end time Hallelujah he
[56:25] won't lose a
[56:26] one he won't lose one of those names you
[56:29] got to realize amen what this is all
[56:32] about friends amen you you if you're one
[56:34] of his children he's taking care of that
[56:36] name see this message isn't just about
[56:38] joining a church it's not about putting
[56:40] your name on a book somewhere amen you
[56:42] got to get a revelation by this message
[56:44] that your name's on that book amen and
[56:46] by that Revelation you realize amen that
[56:49] you're the spoken word of God uh a word
[56:53] is a thought expressed amen we're taught
[56:55] these things amen but that's the problem
[56:57] is that we talk about it talk about it
[56:58] talk about it but this is a reality my
[57:01] friends we can talk talk talk about well
[57:03] we got the word the word the word amen
[57:05] we have the word amen but don't you
[57:07] realize you're the
[57:09] word amen you're the word you've been
[57:11] expressed there's a purpose behind it
[57:13] amen there's something that was sent for
[57:14] and it won't return
[57:16] void it's got to be manifested brother
[57:19] sister brother Bram says notice the word
[57:21] had to be manifested and when the word
[57:23] had to be manifested he said God always
[57:25] sends a prophet to manifest that promise
[57:28] because the word of the Lord comes to
[57:29] him he talks about Moses was called to
[57:31] the job and nobody else could do it
[57:34] Hallelujah nobody else can do it amen
[57:38] hallelujah I I I I just feel led to
[57:41] Branch off here for a minute see the
[57:42] word has got to be manifested amen let's
[57:45] let's just uh let's just understand that
[57:47] clearly today that God sent a message
[57:49] into this world Amen not just to not
[57:51] just to gather a new following not to
[57:53] just be a new church to join but to
[57:55] manifest something actually to manifest
[57:58] someone Amen to to manifest itself amen
[58:02] and so the message when it's taught
[58:04] right preached right amen when it when
[58:07] it's when it's carried right when it's
[58:08] believed right it manifests itself and
[58:11] that manifestation is the Vindication
[58:14] that it was the word of God Amen and so
[58:18] what we want to know is that we are
[58:19] manifesting the word so we say well you
[58:21] know we got all the word on on uh uh uh
[58:24] we got all word on on on the real
[58:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost and what it
[58:27] looks like and what it feels like and
[58:29] what it should be amen but at the end of
[58:30] the day friends amen do we have an
[58:32] atmosphere in the church where a young
[58:34] person amen can get the baptism of the
[58:36] Holy Ghost amen we say well we can we
[58:39] can take the word we can teach
[58:40] deliverance we can explain it all you
[58:42] know we can we can we can put it in its
[58:44] right priority you know Rejoice not that
[58:46] devils are subject to you but your names
[58:48] are written on the land's book of life
[58:49] but at the end of the day friends can we
[58:51] manifest the word and get the people
[58:53] delivered that are bound amen or else
[58:55] what are we doing here on Sunday morning
[58:56] amen we say well you know I got this
[58:58] quote and that quote on worship and this
[59:00] quote on that quote on what songs you
[59:02] should sing and this quote and that
[59:03] quote on Dancing in the spirit amen but
[59:05] can you Worship in this church amen do
[59:07] they dance in the spirit in this church
[59:09] amen that's the question can we manifest
[59:12] the word can at the end of the day is
[59:15] there a real manifestation that goes
[59:17] with it and because if it's a word of
[59:19] God it'll speak for itself God will God
[59:22] is his own interpreter God will bring
[59:23] his word to pass
[59:25] amen so we look for him to fulfill it
[59:28] amen but if there's no fulfillment then
[59:30] we begin to say well what are we missing
[59:32] here and usually what we're missing is
[59:34] amen the understanding amen that it's
[59:37] not a mystery up here somewhere being
[59:38] revealed but it's a mystery right here
[59:41] amen that it's an individual experience
[59:44] of the Revelation manifestation and
[59:46] fulfillment of the prophetic word of God
[59:50] hallelujah amen and nobody else can do
[59:53] it if God called a person for a job to
[59:55] do brother Bram said no one can take its
[59:57] place he said there's no one can take
[59:59] your place with your
[1:00:03] peculiarity now we're all peculiar is
[1:00:06] that right I know some of us more than
[1:00:09] others but see there's nobody can take
[1:00:12] your place there's nobody can take your
[1:00:17] peculiarity hallelujah amen brother Bram
[1:00:20] says now brother BR you know this is a
[1:00:22] prophet who can get real honest about
[1:00:25] his
[1:00:26] complexes amen and and uh and and his
[1:00:28] inner feelings and things he gets real
[1:00:30] honest with us he says how often I've

[1:00:35] place my or how I would like to take
[1:00:38] Billy Graham's place there would be
[1:00:40] somebody like that but you know what
[1:00:41] brother Bram said he said I can't be
[1:00:43] Billy Graham but neither can Billy
[1:00:45] Graham be me amen I can't be Oral
[1:00:48] Roberts but Oral Roberts can't be me and
[1:00:51] he said you are each one set in God's
[1:00:54] economy just for its place one will Fast
[1:00:57] all the time and commune with God
[1:00:59] another one will cast out Devils cuz
[1:01:00] this one's fasting but it's the whole
[1:01:02] body of Christ working together that's
[1:01:05] the unity amen that's the unity we're
[1:01:07] looking for amen it's not to make me the
[1:01:09] same as that one or that one the same as
[1:01:11] me it can't be that way but let me
[1:01:13] fulfill my role amen let you fulfill
[1:01:16] your role and it makes the body of
[1:01:18] Christ Living acting and doing
[1:01:20] Hallelujah friends like just like see

[1:01:31] and fasting and praying and fasting I
[1:01:32] praying I've never cast out one
[1:01:34] devil and he says well sister that's not
[1:01:37] it he said you're supposed to do the
[1:01:39] fasting and praying so that I can cast
[1:01:42] out the

[1:02:02] see when you realize that you got a
[1:02:04] place in the body of Christ what it
[1:02:05] should mean to you is amen it should be
[1:02:07] so special to realize that nobody can
[1:02:10] take your place amen and that if you're
[1:02:12] peculiar if you're unique amen if you're
[1:02:15] one of a kind amen then it's only

[1:02:19] wanted a one in a million he wanted a
[1:02:21] one in a billion Amen to take their
[1:02:23] place in the body of Christ and fulfill
[1:02:25] their purpose amen so that when you put

[1:03:05] I share with our young people you know
[1:03:08] that that that that for our young people
[1:03:09] to realize you know because I know what
[1:03:11] it is to be a young person amen I went
[1:03:13] through my teenage years and I know what
[1:03:15] self-loathing is and I know what it is
[1:03:17] to hate who you are and wish you were
[1:03:19] somebody else and wish that you were
[1:03:21] different and have all those complexes
[1:03:23] and insecurities and inferiorities and
[1:03:25] all those things I went through that
[1:03:27] brother sister I didn't always feel this
[1:03:28] way amen but when the message opened up
[1:03:30] to me amen it became such a revelation
[1:03:33] amen tell you know what it's not
[1:03:35] Christian To Love Yourself Christians
[1:03:37] don't love themselves right but a real
[1:03:40] true Christianity amen you can love

[1:03:45] revelation of purpose in your life God's
[1:03:47] choosing of you amen God's election of

[1:03:52] trade places with anybody
[1:03:55] amen I love being Nathan Ericson I love
[1:03:57] doing what I was called to do amen why

[1:04:17] you are an
[1:04:18] authentic amen you are a you are a
[1:04:21] one-of a kind creation of God's
[1:04:23] expression and God doesn't do anything
[1:04:26] halfway God doesn't make halfway
[1:04:28] preachers he doesn't have make halfway
[1:04:30] mothers he doesn't make halfway deacons
[1:04:33] he doesn't have make halfway worshippers
[1:04:35] he don't have make halfway singers God
[1:04:37] doesn't do anything halfway amen but
[1:04:39] whoever he calls amen he perfects and he
[1:04:43] glorifies and he positions and he uses
[1:04:46] woo Hallelujah he reveals himself
[1:04:50] through you amen I know I've already
[1:04:53] preached this here but I'll call it to
[1:04:54] your remembrance that brother brandham
[1:04:56] said he said that God wants to uh he
[1:04:59] wants to dwell with you with your
[1:05:02] temperament and we say my
[1:05:06] temperament you know I live with this
[1:05:09] guy I I don't know about that he said
[1:05:11] with your temperament he wants to do the
[1:05:14] kind of things he would do through you
[1:05:15] he wants to think the kind of thoughts
[1:05:16] that he would do through you you know
[1:05:18] where immediately our human Minds go we
[1:05:19] go to the humanity we go we go look we
[1:05:21] look at the flesh we look at the
[1:05:23] unworthiness that's immediately where
[1:05:25] our minds goes but brother Bram says I
[1:05:27] know it sounds awful but it's
[1:05:30] right but it's right oh brother sister
[1:05:34] Hallelujah he said you're each one set
[1:05:35] in God's economy just for its place one
[1:05:39] fasts and communes another one casts out
[1:05:41] Devils but it's the whole body of Christ
[1:05:44] working
[1:05:45] together brother Braham said your name
[1:05:47] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:05:49] before the foundation of the
[1:05:50] world and he said the color of hair you
[1:05:53] have have the color eyes you have the
[1:05:57] stature that you're in God didn't want
[1:05:58] you to be tall Brother
[1:06:00] Ray he chose the stature that you're in
[1:06:03] he said God seen you before the
[1:06:04] foundation of the world and he seen you
[1:06:08] a human being like you are now I know we
[1:06:11] think we than God spun the wheel and
[1:06:12] there was a big list of names he spun
[1:06:14] the wheel and
[1:06:15] went and you and and you just got lucky
[1:06:18] and he chose you by a lot no friends God
[1:06:21] had a picture of you in his mind amen a
[1:06:23] perfect picture you before the
[1:06:24] foundation of the world he knew he he
[1:06:26] designed you he knew what you would look
[1:06:28] like he knew the things that you would
[1:06:30] go through he knew what you would face
[1:06:32] all these things were contained in the
[1:06:33] forn knowledge of God Amen but the
[1:06:36] election of God wiped away all your
[1:06:38] cuckle BT p and the predestination of
[1:06:41] God has secured your future amen you're
[1:06:43] contained he thought of you he holds you
[1:06:46] he numbered you he chose you hallelujah
[1:06:49] what a beautiful thing amen right down
[1:06:52] to the color hair you would have if you
[1:06:53] got
[1:06:54] and the color eyes that you have and the
[1:06:56] stature that you're in he saw all of
[1:06:58] that friends amen he he he he saw you in
[1:07:01] that for knowledge he said put that one
[1:07:03] on my book that one's going to stand the
[1:07:07] test Hallelujah put that name on my book
[1:07:11] not so you'd be like everybody else or
[1:07:13] that you would conform to some some
[1:07:14] other image but that he could perfect
[1:07:17] himself in you perfect the Revelation in
[1:07:20] you to a Perfection that another and no
[1:07:23] other human being could manifest it the
[1:07:25] way you can manifest it cuz it's just to
[1:07:28] you as an
[1:07:30] individual friends if that really sinks
[1:07:33] down amen you'll stand with security
[1:07:35] like you've never known in your life
[1:07:38] amen that he designed you I just I love
[1:07:40] this quote about he picked your the
[1:07:42] color your eyes and your hair and all
[1:07:43] those kind of things you know I grew up
[1:07:44] hearing brother Ron Spencer preach youth
[1:07:47] meetings you know in that era where he
[1:07:49] would go to youth camps and things I've
[1:07:51] heard brother Ron read preach me this
[1:07:53] quote probably a couple hundred times
[1:07:56] but you know it takes a little while
[1:07:58] took me a little while to believe it a't
[1:08:00] that right and that's why these things
[1:08:01] bear repeating sometimes because it
[1:08:03] takes us a little while to really
[1:08:05] believe it friends but I would just say
[1:08:07] Lord don't let me leave this place
[1:08:09] without a firm grasp amen without a
[1:08:12] revelation a Rock Amen something
[1:08:14] Anchored In My Soul Brother Nathan's
[1:08:16] talking about me that there's a higher
[1:08:18] power Amen in this universe that fornew
[1:08:21] me he saw me he designed me he's
[1:08:24] selected me and he has filled me and
[1:08:26] spoken his word into me to make me a
[1:08:29] revelation of the whole thing and my
[1:08:31] part in the Symphony of God is
[1:08:33] important Amen brother Bram he remember
[1:08:36] unveiling God he talks about that that
[1:08:37] bail maker and how you know he he said
[1:08:41] uh each Bell has got to ring different
[1:08:42] from the other you know and you mix them
[1:08:44] different some have some have more iron
[1:08:46] some have more steel some have more
[1:08:48] brass just to get just the
[1:08:50] right amen just to get the he knows the
[1:08:53] noise noise he wants to get out of it he
[1:08:55] knows the tune he knows how to shape it
[1:08:57] he knows how to put you through the fire
[1:08:59] Amen to get that sound out of you that
[1:09:01] he wants that's what all the trials that
[1:09:04] we go through it's all just shaping all
[1:09:06] those fiery you know the fiery
[1:09:07] environments amen and things that we
[1:09:09] have to pass through amen Fire Can't
[1:09:11] extinguish fire but what he's doing is
[1:09:14] amen he's shaping us he's molding us
[1:09:17] amen cuz he wants to get a sound out of
[1:09:19] you and it won't sound like the pastor
[1:09:21] it won't sound like the Deacon but it'll
[1:09:24] harmonize amen it'll fit the scale amen
[1:09:28] it'll put you right in the same
[1:09:29] Symphony he even says he bred this one
[1:09:32] to that one he bred this one to that one
[1:09:34] can you think about your grandfather's
[1:09:35] grandfather's grandfather and the wars
[1:09:37] that they went through and famines and
[1:09:39] plagues and all those kind of things and
[1:09:41] accidents that could have happened to
[1:09:42] them and those near misses and
[1:09:44] near-death experiences and they wondered
[1:09:45] what it was all about but God knew what
[1:09:47] it was all about he knew maybe in a 100
[1:09:49] or 200 years amen that the seed lion
[1:09:51] would have to come to produce his
[1:09:53] instrument amen his his his his
[1:09:56] Masterpiece amen and then he would take
[1:09:58] that Masterpiece which is you and he
[1:10:01] knew how to shape it he knew how to
[1:10:02] knock the rough edges off of it he knew
[1:10:04] what what temperature of fire that you
[1:10:06] could take amen just to get the right
[1:10:08] ring out of you amen I make you part of
[1:10:11] the Symphony of God till he said Till
[1:10:13] brother Bram said he got exactly what he
[1:10:16] wanted now if that could settle in today
[1:10:19] you say what brother Nathan I'm this I'm
[1:10:21] that I'm that he got he gets exactly
[1:10:23] what he
[1:10:25] wants oh trust him friends he knows amen
[1:10:29] amen he know exactly what he wanted you
[1:10:32] say well you know you you so you're in
[1:10:34] this Symphony of of God now some people
[1:10:37] are playing that lead violin you know
[1:10:40] somebody somebody they got the trumpet
[1:10:42] solo and then there's another guy he
[1:10:45] sits there for two hours and then he
[1:10:48] pulls out the triangle and hits it one
[1:10:51] time but brother sister it's not a
[1:10:54] symphony it's not a symph symphony if he
[1:10:57] misses that beat amen and that's what it
[1:10:59] really that's really what true
[1:11:00] Christianity is you're not trying to be
[1:11:02] the best you're not trying to be the
[1:11:03] lead man you're not trying to be in the
[1:11:05] spotlight all the time it's just say
[1:11:06] Lord lead me by your spirit and don't
[1:11:08] let me mobat amen would just let me be
[1:11:11] right on Queue and do what I'm supposed
[1:11:13] to do and fulfill my purpose and be what
[1:11:15] you called me to be amen then I'm just
[1:11:17] as much a part of this beautiful
[1:11:19] Symphony amen as the one who's in the
[1:11:21] spotlight as the one who gets the
[1:11:22] attention the one who gets the Applause
[1:11:24] amen but it means just as much amen if
[1:11:28] God wanted you to play that triangle
[1:11:29] then he'll get what he wanted see the
[1:11:32] problem is we look in the mirror and we
[1:11:33] don't see what we want amen but see God
[1:11:37] is getting what he wanted amen again and
[1:11:40] who is this mesic brother Braham says
[1:11:41] your eyes your stature whatever you was
[1:11:45] you were in his thinking at the
[1:11:46] beginning and the only thing that you
[1:11:48] are is
[1:11:50] expression after he thought it he spoke
[1:11:53] it and here you
[1:11:56] are I just love that he thought it he
[1:12:00] spoke it and here you are he you say
[1:12:04] brother Nathan I don't know about this I
[1:12:05] don't know about
[1:12:06] that I got this problem I'm going
[1:12:08] through that issue I'm into these
[1:12:09] circumstances oh friends he thought you
[1:12:12] and he spoke you and here you are amen
[1:12:15] so just let the word of God do its thing
[1:12:17] just trust that seed that's on the
[1:12:19] inside of you amen just keep it in the
[1:12:21] right atmosphere it'll grow it'll push
[1:12:23] out it'll bear fruit God will make it
[1:12:25] beautiful in his time hallelujah it's
[1:12:28] not it's not it's not just nothing it's
[1:12:30] not just our words and our Ambitions
[1:12:32] it's the word of God and it does not
[1:12:35] return void but it shall accomplish that
[1:12:38] which he sent
[1:12:39] it and brother Bram says God is
[1:12:42] Sovereign in his choosing did you know
[1:12:44] that he said God is Sovereign who was
[1:12:47] back there to tell him a better way to
[1:12:48] make the world who would dare to tell
[1:12:50] him he was running his business wrong
[1:12:53] you think than God doesn't isn't in
[1:12:54] control of this
[1:12:55] economy amen he knows how to run the
[1:12:58] business friends and as I've preached
[1:13:00] many times some of you would have tried
[1:13:01] to tell them some of us would have tried
[1:13:03] to tell them well you should it should
[1:13:04] be this way it should be that you should
[1:13:06] add a little more you should add a
[1:13:07] little more of this a little more of
[1:13:09] that oh no he knows the recipe amen he
[1:13:12] knows what he's doing he knows how to
[1:13:14] run his business so why is it that we
[1:13:16] always put what we think over what God
[1:13:20] thought amen come on friends and your
[1:13:23] daily life amen when you rather you
[1:13:25] listen to a voice of condemnation
[1:13:28] instead of a word of forgiveness a word
[1:13:30] of justification but we'd rather take
[1:13:32] our thought of condemnation amen we'd
[1:13:34] rather take you know God gives us a
[1:13:36] thought of purpose he gives us a word of
[1:13:38] purpose of calling of glory amen and we
[1:13:41] would rather take a complex we would
[1:13:43] rather listen to our thought of
[1:13:45] inferiority oh friends amen we got to
[1:13:48] stop putting our thoughts amen above
[1:13:50] what he thought amen but oh just to know
[1:13:53] amen what this message was sent to
[1:13:54] identify to you amen you it's an eagle
[1:13:57] scream to you when you get a revelation
[1:13:59] of this message you're hearing from
[1:14:00] Earth the opony and it's telling you
[1:14:03] don't worry little son don't worry
[1:14:05] little daughter don't worry little Eagle
[1:14:07] you came from
[1:14:09] me and you'll accomplish the purpose you
[1:14:12] got all you're my son you're my daughter
[1:14:13] you've got all of my
[1:14:15] potential Hallelujah you're his thought
[1:14:18] friends so you're Eternal you're special
[1:14:20] you're
[1:14:22] powerful Hallelujah brother Bram says
[1:14:25] that power that you have in you now it
[1:14:27] could make a new
[1:14:28] world that's a reality it could make a
[1:14:31] new world Amen because we're always
[1:14:33] thinking of our thoughts of well you
[1:14:34] know this one's big and I'm little and
[1:14:36] that brother he's got a great gift and I
[1:14:38] don't and this and that Amen brother
[1:14:41] Braham said that God doesn't have little
[1:14:43] weak spots and big heavy spots that are
[1:14:45] powerful now not everybody's going to
[1:14:47] speak a new world into existence amen
[1:14:50] see that power is in you but that's not
[1:14:52] what it's given for
[1:14:53] is that right you know if God gave us
[1:14:55] everything we ever prayed for you ever
[1:14:58] just think about that you know it would
[1:15:00] take us about 2 and a half minutes to
[1:15:01] rip this planet apart with with
[1:15:03] enforcing our will amen but see but
[1:15:06] there's so much power in you that
[1:15:08] whatever he inspires you to do amen then
[1:15:11] then With God all things are possible
[1:15:13] and you can do all things through Christ
[1:15:15] who strengthens you amen there's nothing
[1:15:17] that can stand in the way of the purpose
[1:15:19] God has for you but your purpose won't
[1:15:22] be my purpose and my purpose won't be
[1:15:24] your purpose it'll be what he raised you
[1:15:26] up for amen the reason he spoke you into
[1:15:28] existence but see there's no little weak
[1:15:30] spots that's in our thinking it's not in
[1:15:32] God's there's no big heavy spots that
[1:15:34] are powerful he said the least little
[1:15:36] touch of God is omnipotent that means
[1:15:39] all powerful the god that's in you
[1:15:41] brother if you got you say brother
[1:15:43] Nathan I got the littlest Mark of deity
[1:15:45] in me I got less Holy Ghost than anyone
[1:15:47] else in the body amen I'm just the skin
[1:15:50] on the bottom of the little toe well
[1:15:52] praise the Lord you're right down where
[1:15:54] the action is you're the closest one to
[1:15:56] the foot of the devil amen all powers of
[1:15:58] hell are beneath you if you're in the
[1:16:00] body of Christ you're not half powerful
[1:16:03] you're all
[1:16:04] powerful omnipotence is in you
[1:16:08] Hallelujah glory be to God Amen
[1:16:13] Hallelujah he said he's seen something
[1:16:15] to me he's seen something in you he had
[1:16:18] a reason to save you oh my think about
[1:16:22] this he said look at the people that are
[1:16:23] unsaved today look at the millions he
[1:16:26] could have took beside you oh if that
[1:16:29] don't humble you down but he took you no
[1:16:32] one can take your place you're in God's
[1:16:35] economy nobody can do it that's his love
[1:16:38] to you Hallelujah that's God's economy
[1:16:42] now now God's economy God's ways are are
[1:16:45] higher than our ways his thoughts are
[1:16:47] higher than our thoughts so to we have
[1:16:49] to we have to be retrained by revelation
[1:16:52] we got to to be reprogrammed to think in
[1:16:55] terms of God's economy because this mind
[1:16:56] will never do it this carnal mind is
[1:16:59] enmity with the plan of God it cannot
[1:17:00] see purpose it cannot see value it
[1:17:03] cannot see predestination it can't see
[1:17:05] those things all it can do is measure by
[1:17:07] human measurement amen so see you got to
[1:17:11] you got to learn to think in terms of
[1:17:14] God's economy can we just slow down
[1:17:16] teach on that for a minute God's economy
[1:17:18] now now see we live in a natural economy
[1:17:22] amen and it everything has a
[1:17:24] value we think about that concept of
[1:17:27] value you know it's a a powerful thing
[1:17:29] to think about how it's value and not
[1:17:31] just value but relative value relative
[1:17:34] value in other words this thing will
[1:17:36] have this price and this thing will have
[1:17:38] this price this this organ and this
[1:17:39] piano each have a value they have a
[1:17:41] price and one is more than the other
[1:17:43] probably the piano amen it's it's got a
[1:17:46] higher value than that one and so you
[1:17:48] know yeah this thing has value but when
[1:17:50] you compare it to the piano it it's not
[1:17:52] as valuable
[1:17:53] right it's relative it's all in
[1:17:56] comparison is that right amen and and
[1:17:58] and our society that we're Liv in the
[1:18:01] the world that we're raised in is
[1:18:03] obsessed with relative value it's
[1:18:06] obsessed amen with worth it's obsessed
[1:18:09] with these things it's baked right into
[1:18:10] our human nature now if like I said just
[1:18:13] teaching now if it's all right but you
[1:18:15] know uh uh uh you're take a you ever
[1:18:17] take a economics 101 in school and some
[1:18:20] of you kids are going through high
[1:18:21] schoool and college and thing you sit
[1:18:23] through economics 101 they first thing
[1:18:24] they explain to you is about you know
[1:18:26] they're talking about currency and value
[1:18:28] and barter and a barter economy and they
[1:18:30] say oh way back sometime you know they
[1:18:33] didn't have money hadn't been invented
[1:18:35] yet so they would just barter and this
[1:18:37] guy would say well I got a cow and I'll
[1:18:39] trade my cow for your 10 chickens you
[1:18:41] know and I got a camel and I'll trade it
[1:18:42] for your daughter or whatever and and
[1:18:45] and so and and the barter economy and
[1:18:47] then eventually you know they figured
[1:18:48] out they could come up with this thing
[1:18:49] called money that would represent and
[1:18:51] that and then that you know that took
[1:18:52] the the place of a burter economy and
[1:18:54] you know this very interest to me it's
[1:18:56] very interesting you might not care just
[1:18:57] take it for what it's worth but there's
[1:18:59] never been in all of history and
[1:19:01] anthropology and archaeology and all
[1:19:03] those studies they don't know they don't
[1:19:05] actually know of any society or
[1:19:08] civilization that ever existed that
[1:19:09] didn't have money that didn't have
[1:19:12] currency that didn't have this concept
[1:19:15] right at the root of it of value and
[1:19:18] things need to be bought and things be
[1:19:20] do you know what that tells me that
[1:19:22] tells me that this this value idea is
[1:19:24] not just you know some cerebral thing
[1:19:26] that that that some some something that
[1:19:28] you know some arbitrary thing that we
[1:19:30] just invented one day but the concept of
[1:19:32] value the thought of value goes way down
[1:19:35] deep to the roots of the human heart
[1:19:38] I'll tell you goes way back and I
[1:19:40] believe it goes all the way back to the
[1:19:41] Garden of Eden amen when Adam had
[1:19:44] something of Great Value but it was lost
[1:19:47] friends and ever since Adam lost the
[1:19:49] garden amen there's been something a
[1:19:52] desire at the in every human heart they
[1:19:55] know that they're Fallen they know they
[1:19:57] need redeemed they know they're unworthy
[1:19:59] and they need to be bought back every
[1:20:01] human being intrinsically knows that
[1:20:03] they they are unworthy and that they're
[1:20:05] of and they're undervalued and that they
[1:20:08] need to be redeemed amen whether it's
[1:20:10] it's conscious or subconscious or at
[1:20:12] whatever level to be human amen is to
[1:20:15] doubt your own value is to know that
[1:20:17] you're unworthy it's to know that you
[1:20:19] need Redemption can you see that amen
[1:20:22] but see and that's why in this in the
[1:20:25] economy of this world Amen you'll always
[1:20:28] come up lacking listen young people in
[1:20:30] this world no matter what you achieve
[1:20:33] amen no matter no matter what you are no
[1:20:35] matter how attractive how talented how
[1:20:37] successful you are in this life you will
[1:20:39] be compared and I know the pain uh uh I
[1:20:43] know the pain of uh of being a young
[1:20:45] person being compared to this one and
[1:20:46] being compared to and comparing yourself
[1:20:49] and feeling like you're of no value and
[1:20:52] feel feeling unworthy that's human
[1:20:54] nature to be under that and you'll
[1:20:56] always be compared you know that you can
[1:20:58] you could just make up your mind one day
[1:20:59] I'm going to be a great piano player and
[1:21:01] you just sit down and every day you
[1:21:03] practice put in 10 hours a day of
[1:21:05] practice practice for 20 years and and
[1:21:07] just hit the ceiling of your potential
[1:21:09] as a piano player and sure enough
[1:21:11] there'll be some 8-year-old in China on
[1:21:16] YouTube who can just play circles around
[1:21:18] you and no mat see you're going to be
[1:21:21] compared and you're going to come up
[1:21:22] lacking in this life but God's economy
[1:21:25] glory to God God's economy doesn't look
[1:21:28] at relative value at all it does not
[1:21:31] compare you it does not hold you up it
[1:21:33] does not it does not it does not measure
[1:21:35] you against a standard God's economy
[1:21:38] doesn't look at relative value God's
[1:21:40] economy looks at Eternal value amen and
[1:21:43] and eternal value is all one all of One
[1:21:45] Price amen it's eternal life amen
[1:21:48] there's only one eternal life it's deity
[1:21:50] it's God Amen your part of him or you're
[1:21:53] not but if you are then you're of
[1:21:56] Eternal
[1:21:57] value Eternal value amen and and and and
[1:22:01] eternal value doesn't measure it doesn't
[1:22:03] compare you don't come up lacking you're
[1:22:06] identified in him in his life in his
[1:22:09] nature in his attributes his substance
[1:22:12] Oh Glory friends Hallelujah you're not
[1:22:15] uh you're not measured by what other
[1:22:17] people think about you in this economy
[1:22:19] Amen in God's economy amen you're
[1:22:21] measured by your con connection to
[1:22:23] eternal life amen I I believe I preached
[1:22:25] this before but it Bears repeating in
[1:22:27] this economy in this human world we have
[1:22:30] inflation oh yeah we got currencies and
[1:22:32] we got markets and things and you got to
[1:22:34] go down and pay $12 for a dozen eggs and
[1:22:37] and eggs aren't worth
[1:22:38] $12 the value doesn't match the price
[1:22:41] but that's the price that has to be paid
[1:22:43] because of because you know because of
[1:22:44] all the crazy stuff that happens in our
[1:22:46] economy amen but see in God's economy
[1:22:49] there's no inflation the value is the
[1:22:52] price
[1:22:53] I said the value is the price amen and
[1:22:55] if you're a recipient of the grace of
[1:22:58] the sacrifice of the blood of God then
[1:23:01] your price your value your worth is the
[1:23:04] life of God's own son the blood of God
[1:23:07] was shed for you that's your value it's
[1:23:09] not inflated oh he didn't get ripped off
[1:23:13] God knew the price and he knew the value
[1:23:16] he would receive back and he considered
[1:23:18] it worth and the great thing about
[1:23:20] eternal value is it only if one of us if
[1:23:23] Just One of Us in this building if Just
[1:23:25] One of Us in this
[1:23:27] world was part of his thinking at the
[1:23:30] beginning then he would have died he
[1:23:32] would have walked up that hill and
[1:23:34] carried that cross and hung on that tree
[1:23:36] for one for one amen cuz it's Eternal
[1:23:40] value to him without it he's not God
[1:23:43] without you he's not perfect he is not
[1:23:45] complete until the story of redemption
[1:23:47] is fully manifested and revealed and he
[1:23:49] can reconcile you to himself he would
[1:23:52] have died for
[1:23:54] one he would have done it you say for me
[1:23:56] brother Nathan just for you just for you
[1:24:00] amen oh my amen you think do you think
[1:24:03] God shed his blood out of
[1:24:05] obligation no sir he shed his blood
[1:24:09] because of
[1:24:10] Desire because of desire you see Eternal
[1:24:15] value so what I'm preaching to you is
[1:24:17] not just some kind of a feel-good Joel
[1:24:19] hting kind of a you know just a a some
[1:24:22] kind of a a mega churchy Veggie Tales
[1:24:24] kind of a water down you know oh you're
[1:24:26] very special and and you know God loves
[1:24:29] you so much friends because it's not
[1:24:32] catch this now it's not because I love
[1:24:34] you as a human being and in my human
[1:24:36] love I assign you value because we're
[1:24:38] fellow Christians and we Fellowship
[1:24:40] Church to church not that I assign you
[1:24:42] value no in God's economy you are value
[1:24:47] you are value and if I stopped loving
[1:24:49] you and if brother Samuel stopped loving
[1:24:51] you and if your family stopped loving
[1:24:52] you and if the world rejects you amen
[1:24:54] you are still valuable you are still
[1:24:57] worthy amen why because God counted you
[1:25:00] worthy amen when he came to hang on that
[1:25:02] tree and shed his blood for you amen
[1:25:04] it's his desire it's his will it's his
[1:25:07] evaluation of
[1:25:09] you amen then why do we argue with the
[1:25:11] blood of Christ amen why would we
[1:25:13] disrespect his grace amen by by arguing
[1:25:17] and holding up our thoughts of
[1:25:18] insufficiency and our thoughts of guilt
[1:25:20] and shame throw it all away brother
[1:25:22] sister and accept the evaluation that
[1:25:25] God has offered you accept your Eternal
[1:25:30] value accept
[1:25:33] Grace Hallelujah you are value you are
[1:25:37] value amen no matter how great or small
[1:25:40] anyone around you is no matter what you
[1:25:42] see we see Great Men great women we see
[1:25:44] we see great things and we see big eyes
[1:25:46] and little use we see all those things
[1:25:48] don't look at that friends that's all in
[1:25:50] the human way of thinking but if we
[1:25:52] could really see God's
[1:25:53] economy amen when we would never doubt
[1:25:56] our
[1:25:57] value you know brother Braham said
[1:25:59] trying to do God a service he said
[1:26:01] sometimes great guys get together and
[1:26:03] you hear him say oh great so and so and
[1:26:05] great so and so our great you know this
[1:26:07] great one that great one he said don't
[1:26:09] ever do that there's no great ones Among
[1:26:12] Us there's only one great one and that's
[1:26:16] God we are brothers and sisters he said
[1:26:20] I don't care if you're pastoring a
[1:26:21] church that's got five people in it that
[1:26:23] don't make you little that makes you a
[1:26:24] brother amen he said God doesn't have
[1:26:27] little children and big children he just
[1:26:29] has children they're all the same amen
[1:26:33] he said and God himself came from the
[1:26:35] ivory palaces of Glory to become one of
[1:26:37] us now who's the big one amen not come
[1:26:40] down here to take the form of a priest
[1:26:42] but a servant and he washed the very
[1:26:44] clay that he created the feet of his
[1:26:46] Apostles and others now who's great
[1:26:49] friends and see in our way of thinking
[1:26:51] we think well this this is this message
[1:26:53] it's all about great brother so and so
[1:26:54] and great brother so- and so and this
[1:26:56] great church and that great ministry and
[1:26:58] that great program and great great great
[1:27:00] all friends amen but what's really great
[1:27:03] is just to be part of this thing what's
[1:27:05] really great is to be a brother or
[1:27:07] sister Amen in the body of Christ part
[1:27:09] of this great Eternal mystery that's
[1:27:11] unfolding there's only one rank in the
[1:27:14] body of Christ that's footwash
[1:27:17] flunky and no matter how big you are how
[1:27:19] small how rich how poor amen how how
[1:27:22] famous how unknown whatever you are
[1:27:24] brother sister amen there's one rank in
[1:27:27] the body and that's footwash flunky amen
[1:27:30] because brother Braham said this Holy
[1:27:31] Ghost it'll make a silk suit hug Shear
[1:27:34] sear sucker trousers amen it'll take a
[1:27:36] brother or sister from any class from
[1:27:38] any race from any background whatever
[1:27:40] tradition you came out of friends Amen
[1:27:43] in this message we are one amen and we
[1:27:45] can embrace one another and be one with
[1:27:47] another in Christian love amen and there
[1:27:50] will always be nonsense there always be
[1:27:52] politics there will always be fighting
[1:27:54] amen but beyond all that friends there's
[1:27:56] a message hallelujah amen there amen the
[1:28:00] great assessor has come down amen with
[1:28:02] an open book of evaluation this ain't no
[1:28:05] Kelly Blue Book amen but this is this is
[1:28:08] the L's Book of Life and he opened it to
[1:28:11] us in this age and showed us our name
[1:28:13] Hallelujah he said you're a part of me
[1:28:15] you're my blood red ruby Hallelujah
[1:28:18] you're the ultimate symbol of value to
[1:28:21] me for you are my bride your bone of my
[1:28:24] bone your Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my
[1:28:28] spirit Power of my
[1:28:30] power Hallelujah see that's the way that
[1:28:33] we got to think now now listen amen now
[1:28:36] brother brandom himself uses we'll use
[1:28:38] that phrase he'll say our great brother
[1:28:39] so and so or one of the great generals
[1:28:41] Among Us and and things like that and he
[1:28:43] would use us saying so so don't get the
[1:28:45] idea that it's not like God doesn't have
[1:28:48] those kind of men it's not like God
[1:28:50] doesn't have you know Ministries that
[1:28:51] are known Ministries that are unknown
[1:28:54] Ministries that travel Ministries that
[1:28:55] don't travel amen people with great
[1:28:57] recognized talents people that people
[1:29:00] people that aren't as recognized some
[1:29:01] are in the spotlight some are not amen
[1:29:04] that's how the body's made up amen shall
[1:29:06] the head shall the ear say to the foot I
[1:29:07] have no need of thee amen it's not going
[1:29:09] to all be the same and the reason these
[1:29:12] things are put in the word amen is not
[1:29:14] to just change the order of it but to
[1:29:16] change our evaluation of it it's not
[1:29:18] that we're all the same in the body of
[1:29:20] Christ but we're all valued the
[1:29:24] same we're all valued the same that's
[1:29:26] why the Bible said the ones that we
[1:29:28] think we think they of less honor we
[1:29:31] bestow more abundant honor and the want
[1:29:34] parts that look uncomely we consider
[1:29:37] them oh my that they are more beautiful
[1:29:40] amen so so you can't hold this
[1:29:43] revelation of go of in jealousy because
[1:29:46] if they got any jealousy in you amen
[1:29:49] then you're right back in the realm of
[1:29:51] of relative to Value amen Petty
[1:29:54] jealousies and things because daythan
[1:29:55] and cor could preach what I'm preaching
[1:29:57] and they say well Moses he's trying to
[1:29:58] make himself big something and everybody
[1:30:00] looks at Moses and everybody everybody
[1:30:02] talks about his ministry and they never
[1:30:03] talk about me you know and and oh he
[1:30:06] Moses thinks he's such a big shot and
[1:30:08] those Petty jealousies would actually
[1:30:09] prevent the Revelation meanwhile you got
[1:30:11] a Joshua he says yeah let Moses be the
[1:30:14] greatest man he could be let me sit at
[1:30:16] his feet and that's why Joshua could be
[1:30:19] a successor and why Joshua could
[1:30:21] accomplish his purpose friends amen cuz
[1:30:24] you can't receive this Revelation in
[1:30:26] jealousy can you see what I'm saying
[1:30:27] amen so big so don't take this as a amen
[1:30:30] when you when you when you get a
[1:30:31] revelation that everybody in the economy
[1:30:34] of God has valued the same and hasn't of
[1:30:37] purpose of equal value don't use it to
[1:30:40] attack your brother don't use it to tear
[1:30:42] down your sister it shows you got don't
[1:30:45] have the Revelation yet amen but it
[1:30:47] makes us hold up our head and stand up
[1:30:49] strong amen and say I am part part of
[1:30:52] this thing amen I am called to be part
[1:30:55] of the revelation of the of the mystery
[1:30:57] I can accept headship I can accept
[1:31:00] Ministries amen might go further than me
[1:31:02] and do more than me but like I said I
[1:31:03] like to be Nathan Ericson and I like to
[1:31:05] be what God called me to be and do what
[1:31:07] he called me to do that's what I like to
[1:31:09] be and I'm thankful amen just for his
[1:31:11] calling for his grace and I can see the
[1:31:14] value I can see the value and I don't
[1:31:16] depend on what anybody else recognizes
[1:31:19] or what anybody else thinks isn't that a
[1:31:21] beautiful place to live imagine free of
[1:31:25] jealousy free of of what everybody else
[1:31:27] thinks free of scrutiny free of
[1:31:30] comparison free of oh my free of
[1:31:34] judgments and dramas and all those kind
[1:31:36] of things oh friends this truth will set
[1:31:39] you
[1:31:40] free amen this this look friends who
[1:31:44] could preach adoption like brother
[1:31:45] Brandon maybe I've already preached this
[1:31:47] here uh like I said we might repeat some
[1:31:49] things I just go in the way I feel to go
[1:31:51] but brother Brandon think about it now
[1:31:53] if you that if if if God had come down
[1:31:56] in the 1960s to any of these great
[1:31:58] charismatic leaders you know all these
[1:32:01] televangelists and divine healers and
[1:32:03] all these guys that were raising up God
[1:32:04] could have went to any of them and said
[1:32:06] I chose you in this age and you're going
[1:32:08] to preach the mystery you're going to
[1:32:10] open up the mystery of adoption to the
[1:32:12] world you're going to be the one you're
[1:32:14] going to be one who preaches the
[1:32:15] manifestation of sons and what would it
[1:32:18] have been what would have been for any
[1:32:19] of those guys I won't name names but you
[1:32:21] know what it would have been it would
[1:32:23] have been a
[1:32:24] worldwide media
[1:32:26] phenomenon it would have been that guy
[1:32:28] would have been on TV all around the
[1:32:30] globe emptying out hospitals and walking
[1:32:31] on water and doing all those things you
[1:32:35] know there would have been no place for
[1:32:37] you there' have been no air time for me
[1:32:40] or for you no friends amen but God sends
[1:32:44] a prophet to preach the revelation of
[1:32:46] adoption and he preaches the series on
[1:32:49] adoption and he says look if you're a
[1:32:50] farmer if you're a housewife if you're a
[1:32:53] factory worker if you're whatever you
[1:32:55] are just be the best best thing that you
[1:32:58] could be just be you and and he said and
[1:33:00] your positional placing makes you part
[1:33:03] of this great adoption amen and you're
[1:33:05] manifesting the attribute of God that's
[1:33:07] in you in a way that nobody else can do
[1:33:09] and you're irreplaceable what a
[1:33:11] beautiful message friends there's room
[1:33:12] for you in this message there's room for
[1:33:15] me amen there's room amen it's not all
[1:33:17] great ones amen it's not all spotlights
[1:33:20] but it's just a daily Christian Life
[1:33:22] knowing that everything that you're
[1:33:23] going through and everything that you're
[1:33:25] facing and the story that is unfolding
[1:33:27] in your individual life is a part of the
[1:33:29] Great drama amen it's a it's an
[1:33:32] indispensable
[1:33:34] Irreplaceable
[1:33:36] amen uh invaluable part of the economy
[1:33:41] of God brother br's preaching on that
[1:33:43] strippling David what that means to our
[1:33:45] young people that's you know don't let
[1:33:48] anybody despise your youth amen don't
[1:33:50] let anybody well you say say well
[1:33:51] brother Nathan I might not be young in
[1:33:53] years but I'm young in the kingdom of
[1:33:54] God I only got saved a year ago or a
[1:33:57] month ago and don't let anybody despise
[1:33:59] your youth amen oh my friends amen just
[1:34:02] live for Christ you got a purpose in the
[1:34:04] church like the one who sat there 50
[1:34:05] years and some people sit in a church 50
[1:34:08] years and they never do anything for the
[1:34:10] Lord and so you say well I just got here
[1:34:13] but oh friends we'll get to those 11,000
[1:34:15] workers in a minute but let me read this
[1:34:17] beautiful quote from great warrior David
[1:34:20] brother Bram they he's dealing with this
[1:34:22] he says well brother brandom I wasn't
[1:34:24] called to be a preacher he said you
[1:34:26] might be called to be a housewife but
[1:34:28] you got your position in Christ by the
[1:34:30] Holy Ghost you're just as much David as
[1:34:33] the rest of them was hallelujah amen
[1:34:36] friends amen I know I know I I I I
[1:34:40] understand somewhat what it what it is
[1:34:42] to be a woman that believes this message
[1:34:44] to be to be a girl or to be a woman or a
[1:34:46] real lady of God Amen and I I I know you
[1:34:49] don't get treated right sometimes I know
[1:34:51] that you you don't get appreciated even
[1:34:52] by brothers and sisters sometimes you
[1:34:54] feel undervalued amen many all of you
[1:34:56] felt undervalued at some point or
[1:34:58] another just cuz you're a woman amen but
[1:35:00] just to see this message amen that that
[1:35:03] if you're called to be that housewife
[1:35:04] you're just as dripping with the
[1:35:06] anointed oil amen as every Prophet
[1:35:08] priest amen everyone in the five-fold
[1:35:10] ministry to think if we could just get a
[1:35:12] revelation amen of our position of our
[1:35:15] calling Amen to think that God if we
[1:35:18] could just see it right to see that God
[1:35:20] has raised up women in this time amen
[1:35:22] that he could fly them in the face amen
[1:35:24] of the enemy coming in like a flood and
[1:35:26] make you the banner of his Holiness and
[1:35:29] example of real Christian character of
[1:35:31] what a feminine amen attribute of God is
[1:35:34] supposed to look like the Fifth Gospel
[1:35:36] the word made flesh Hallelujah nobody
[1:35:40] can take your place not in God's
[1:35:43] economy Hallelujah every joint supplies
[1:35:47] so nobody in this body is without a
[1:35:50] purpose hey amen so you can't just be a
[1:35:55] consumer every joint
[1:35:58] supplies you can't just be like in our
[1:36:00] natural economy you can't just sit on
[1:36:01] your couch all day and eat
[1:36:03] Cheetos got to go to
[1:36:05] work got to go to work amen you got to
[1:36:09] supply something you've got to
[1:36:11] contribute something to this world Amen
[1:36:13] it's the same in God's economy you can't
[1:36:15] just be a consumer and praise God you
[1:36:17] don't have to be amen God didn't call
[1:36:20] anybody to the bright of Jesus Christ
[1:36:22] just to warm up you and never do
[1:36:23] anything for the Lord but he called each
[1:36:25] one with a unique amen and a and a
[1:36:28] purpose of Great Value you say well this
[1:36:31] one's got that H that one received that
[1:36:33] that's what the parable of the talents
[1:36:34] is all about one gets 10 one gets five
[1:36:37] one gets one the way we count we think
[1:36:39] we think uh we think well if I only get
[1:36:41] one then what's the point oh well don't
[1:36:43] bury that thing amen Faithful is he he
[1:36:46] that's faithful with little God gives
[1:36:48] much is that right and so the problem is
[1:36:51] not not with the word it's not with your
[1:36:52] calling it's with our attitude about it
[1:36:55] amen say well I wanted to be this and I
[1:36:58] wanted to be that oh friends I'm just
[1:37:00] glad I'm in this
[1:37:05] thing what is the mystery behind this
[1:37:08] message it's Christ in you amen so the
[1:37:12] mystery is amen is not what's being
[1:37:15] revealed to your life what's being
[1:37:17] revealed through your life that's the
[1:37:19] real mystery what do do Christ what does
[1:37:22] Dei look like in you I want to know I
[1:37:25] want to see it oh friends and we're
[1:37:26] seeing it more day by day Hallelujah you
[1:37:31] look at those 11th Hour workers you know
[1:37:33] and we know the story it was the ones
[1:37:35] that came last they got the same reward
[1:37:38] the ones who came right at the end so
[1:37:39] some guy's been working all day you know
[1:37:42] how you'd feel you've been working all
[1:37:44] day long you get a hundred bucks and a
[1:37:46] guy showed up five minutes before
[1:37:48] closing he gets a hundred bucks
[1:37:52] amen and it seems unjust amen that's how
[1:37:56] that's how it looks to be part of this
[1:37:57] layout of seeing bride in 2023 the
[1:38:01] prophet came 60 years ago and we're
[1:38:02] living in overtime we think amen and and
[1:38:05] we're looking at this and and just just
[1:38:07] let this unfold to us now but see the
[1:38:10] master he says I'll call whoever I want
[1:38:13] to call and I'll pay him whatever I
[1:38:15] think they're worth amen he he said he
[1:38:18] said you look you be content it's many
[1:38:20] are called but few are chosen those that
[1:38:23] God has chose he promised a wage he
[1:38:25] promised a wage you said oh brother
[1:38:27] Nathan it's
[1:38:28] a this is a bride age then there should
[1:38:31] be a bride wage there should be a bride
[1:38:32] manifestation there should be a movement
[1:38:35] there should be something going
[1:38:36] on let me maybe go at it this way you
[1:38:40] know what I hope I'm not repeating
[1:38:41] myself again but but but I heard
[1:38:44] something one day just stuck with me
[1:38:47] brother where uh it was one of those
[1:38:49] times in the economy when there the UN
[1:38:51] employment rate was really high nobody
[1:38:52] could find a job you know and uh a
[1:38:55] little different from right now but it
[1:38:56] was one of those times and and uh and I
[1:38:58] heard somebody saying Well everybody's
[1:38:59] saying there's no work there's no work
[1:39:02] brother bill there's no work out there
[1:39:05] no work for me he said but when you look
[1:39:07] around at the world bridges are falling
[1:39:10] apart little kids are going hungry
[1:39:13] people are homeless there's Wars there's
[1:39:15] famines there's sickness there's all
[1:39:16] this stuff there's plenty of work to be
[1:39:18] done in this world he said there's just
[1:39:20] no jobs
[1:39:21] and so the moral of the story is never
[1:39:23] confuse a job with work friends now
[1:39:27] that's so that's so spiritual don't you
[1:39:30] ever think just because you're not a
[1:39:31] deacon or because you're not a preacher
[1:39:32] or because you don't have a a position
[1:39:34] in the body of Christ or because people
[1:39:36] don't recognize or people don't
[1:39:37] acknowledge what you're doing amen we we
[1:39:40] need some people that don't care about
[1:39:41] any of that but somebody who cares about
[1:39:43] the work he said the the the harvest is
[1:39:47] great but the workers are few what we
[1:39:49] got is a lot of employees amen we got a
[1:39:51] lot of people around the kingdom of God
[1:39:53] not my job not my job not my job but is
[1:39:56] there somebody who just wants to work is
[1:39:59] there somebody who cares about the work
[1:40:01] cares about the cause somebody who says
[1:40:03] I don't care if I go unrecognized I
[1:40:05] don't care if I never get my five
[1:40:06] minutes in the spotlight but let me do
[1:40:08] something for the kingdom of God God let
[1:40:11] me make a difference God let me let me
[1:40:14] let me change it for the better let me
[1:40:16] leave this message better than it was
[1:40:18] when I got here let me do something for
[1:40:21] you Lord let me
[1:40:22] work oh that's burning away in my heart
[1:40:27] friends I I want to do a work for the
[1:40:32] master I want to do a work friends and
[1:40:35] if we if we believe this message right
[1:40:38] amen there's a work for you to do and
[1:40:40] nobody can take your place and nobody
[1:40:43] can be a substitute for you Hallelujah
[1:40:46] you say there's no time brother Nathan
[1:40:47] the Lord might come tomorrow there's no
[1:40:49] time they had time to work you know
[1:40:51] there was time to work in brother
[1:40:52] brandom's day my parents had time to
[1:40:54] work my grandparents had time to work
[1:40:55] but you know I mean the look at what's
[1:40:57] happening in the world and look at
[1:40:59] Russia and look at all this and I
[1:41:00] there's no time for me brother Nathan
[1:41:02] we're out of time brother Bram said he
[1:41:04] said if I knew the Lord was coming
[1:41:06] tomorrow but my roof needed fixing he
[1:41:08] said when the Lord came back I'd be up
[1:41:10] there hammering on my roof amen and
[1:41:12] friends that's what I want to be that's
[1:41:15] what's in my heart I know the Lord could
[1:41:16] come tomorrow but there's time I believe
[1:41:18] there's time there's not much time but
[1:41:20] there's time amen for me to do something
[1:41:22] for him there's time for me to fulfill
[1:41:25] my purpose there's time young man
[1:41:27] there's time young woman amen don't sit
[1:41:30] around amen and wait oh my oh my there
[1:41:34] something there's something in my heart
[1:41:36] today surging in the rain saying God
[1:41:39] don't let me miss my opportunity amen
[1:41:41] don't let me waste the prime of my life
[1:41:43] let me do something for the kingdom of
[1:41:45] God let me do something not for the
[1:41:48] recognition not for the relative value
[1:41:51] but for the Eternal purpose of God cuz
[1:41:55] one day that's the only thing that'll
[1:41:56] matter
[1:41:58] anymore one day all our evaluations and
[1:42:00] all of our comparisons and all of our
[1:42:02] relativity will all perish and all that
