uncertainties and uh a lot of things that we have not expected and don't expect but what's what's important is that you know where you stand in him that's that's that's what's key and so we are just grateful to God for his Mercy in this hour that he would he would make known the path of life for us he would make himself known in this hour that he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen and he is our refuge amen he's all that we have need of in this life amen we just want to go to the Lord in prayer uh as we PR prepare to turn to the word tonight and um I just want to I know it's already been mentioned here on the when the requests were taken up regarding to continue to keep uh brother Carmelo in prayer I was there uh I was there this afternoon just right before they did the dialysis and was able to just to pray with him and to talk with uh with him and sister Carmen and so we want to continue to keep brother Carmelo in prayer um the Lord would just continue to minister to him he was in a lot of lot of pain I know others have been there and I want to say that uh that's that's wonderful when I as I heard that too and uh he has been in a lot of pain so you know we don't know we don't know is is it the time for for brother Carmelo only god holds that but the thing that we do know is this right here is that we look at you know where the heart the soul the life of the individual and you know just like as I told the family before I said you know we've stood and we've I for over the times in the years when I've went there to visit brother Carmelo and just to times just to speak with him and bring it around to a place to where that where as an individual just to have that peace with God and uh that's where that as in our lives we can we can ask for no more it's the word that we we we present by a witness in our heart in our life you know it's that's all that God asked of us to do and then if faith will take a hold and to believe and to take a hold of that well that's where we we rest in that word so we just ask that You' just continue to keep him in prayer and um that the Lord would just be merciful to our brother and uh also tonight I going to minister here with a prayer cloth on uh for for brother Brian Jr he has a a fever here that's uh come up again and you know he's been battling for it's been on and off for uh a few months and different things you know not knowing what you know is it sickness is it flu or is it what and so tomorrow morning they're going to do a CT scan and uh but I just you know when I received that there this morning and I just we're we're not going to accept anything you know we're we're going to stand on the promise of God you know and if nothing wrong with the CT scan uh that's not any weakness of Faith remember when uh Israel was to go into the land God could have just sent them on into the land but instead God said go ahead and get a CT scan go ahead and get the MRI and let's see let's see where we need to direct the prayers to so that's how when we when we go to get tests you know we we understand that when things come about you know we we're praying and we're looking to the Lord God is more than enough amen so we just want to hold our brother up in prayer and I ask you to join with me as we go to the Lord in prayer before as we get ready to turn to the word and okay so we want to remember also the Bosley family in prayer as well they there's sickness there and their home so we want to remember them as well amen and I know there's many other requests that you have on your heart we've already made those known but we want to take everything before God in prayer and just ask the Lord to just move for these needs in a special way he knows how to do it you know he he only We Stand upon his word and we we the Bible said if two or three agree as touching any one thing it shall be done God knows how to do it God knows exactly how to do it we stand there upon the word he doesn't need us to to tell him we just we go to him in prayer and faith believing and just let God just direct it amen right where it needs to go our heavenly father Lord as we just come before you Lord this evening what a privilege it is Lord that we can call upon your name and we can come before the throne of grace Lord Lord we're so grateful Lord Jesus for that tonight Lord I don't know what I would do without you lord oh God you are the answer for every need in every situation Lord You're the stabilizer of Our Lives Lord and now Lord you see the different needs throughout the body many

for Duty have your way father we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you tonight amen uh if you could would you turn with me to job 23 and uh as you're turning there there was an email sent out as well for the upcoming Fellowship dinner um on the Sunday February 18th and that'll be at the Heritage Presbyterian church that was sent out last week and then brother Shane sent an update to that today um as well and that you know with uh for brother joshu and sister Sharon we it's going to be a regular Church Fellowship dinner but we're going to have a table and have things there for uh just some housewarming gifts and what you would F on your heart uh to bring them so we'll have a table that's there it's an opportunity for us as a as a body of Believers some of of you went to the Gathering uh they had back in um the was it the end of December or the 1st of January I think over there in Cleveland for brother joshu some of you got a chance to go and uh but this will allow us as a whole uh assembly just to be able to uh have some time and just to not only fellowship with one another but also there with uh brother joshu and sister Sharon and I I just think it's U it's just lovely to have them here with us amen and um so in verse 13 of job 23 we want to uh begin reading job said but he is of one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence when I consider I am afraid of him for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face now remember those last three verses we read it's not God that has troubled him but God has permitted Satan to afflict joob I want you to think of this we can look at this within in this portion of scripture and we know that job doesn't come to this Revelation to the end and uh I'll let you be seated in the name of the Lord Jesus you know that you know that brother brandham remember brother brandham will take us and being what a privileged people we are in this end time to see how God has kept his word of promise promise he said that he would send to us Elijah the prophet and I want to say it like this I don't know for you maybe as I said before there's many other things I look at and I I've often many times I I just pondered when I would look at it of how that the prophet would tell us in many times you know brother Brandon would preach on job just specifically and then other times he would it would be interwoven through the message no matter what message you're listening to I know my redeemer liveth I want you to think of it in this way that sometimes when you read how brother Bram will say that even in the message I've heard but now I see it would say that it would seem as though that when brother Bram says that well brother brandham is saying that that glorious revelation of I know my redeemer liveth and he's really expressing that that that's something that job come to clear at the end and yet you say well it's in job 19 but I want to reme I want to remind you amen that not only did Our Redeemer rise that Easter morning but Our Redeemer has risen in the last days amen and you can see all the way through the Book of Job I I just some things keep bubbling over that I when I look through the Book of Job I see from Genesis all the way to Revelations I see the see the ages you see the seals you see all those things within all of that and how that when you recognize that it's God that has it all in control and I'm I'm grateful for that glorious revelation of Jesus Christ to us personally in this hour to know that he's got it all in control that he's the same he's the same God he's ever mindful of all that you and I have need of in our lives it wasn't it wasn't God as they was saying in these three verses that was troubling job but it was Satan that had gained permission and I want you to think of this you know we can look at it one way and say well how could job have thought that well remember job there was such a strength in Revelation that it so gripped his life till job knew the Hedge and the protection and the comfort that was about his life he knew his life was in God's hands he knew that there was nothing greater and there was nothing could take him away from God so to think and to look what has taken place what has happened where the his children are gone and all these things are happening and and to be able to look at it and realize that hey there is nothing that can penetrate the realities of God and truly in that of job's Soul job had it it was a type of what you and I would receive that is very true that Revelation that was there in job's heart no matter what could come and no matter the situation even when God would allow the Hedge to be relaxed and allow Satan to come in to begin to afflict job it could not separate job from his God and that's what's more important than having everything else we we all all of us like to have the everything go just right in our life we like to have things set just right in our home and all of us that's that's that's a part of us we and I believe I I want to say it like this even as Believers and as Christian s where the peace of God has touched your life you are lovers of Peace you love peace as a matter of fact the Bible says follow peace with all men the Bible would say live as peacely as you can because it's within your heart as a Believer you desire peace uh you know if you desire turmoil then you you might want to say Lord I I need a I I you know I I need a real visitation from The Prince of Peace himself but every life you desire that of a real of peace and so when job this would come about no wonder it would take him by surprise job even job did not have the understanding and the privilege that you and I have on this side of Calvary and with a word to be delivered to you and I and listen even though a word had laid here for Generations you realize the prophet would actually have to stand and in the midst of brandom Tabernacle address when even brother devil was in a car accident when the gun went off also in brother bram's face and brother Bram would have to address the congregation and says when things happen like this it doesn't mean that a person has sinned it means is this God is allowing a situation to take place to Tri us now I'll tell you if but it begins as we've said over and over for a Believer the first thing when anything comes along in our life I believe that not only it should be I but I believe it is the desire of a Believer we want to know where we're standing with God because we know as a Believer the Bible said he has freely given us all things and so we want to we always want to ensure that we are in that channel that the prophet called being justified in what you're asking for and to be able to stand there in the midst of this moment and say Lord I have stood upon your word everything that has been done I've followed your word if there's something that needed to be made right I have made that right Lord I've called for the Elders of the church I've been Anointed with oil confessed our faults Lord now I'm just Lord I'm standing this is your word that you gave us and I'm standing here Lord awaiting on the inspiration to drop for the word that you have given us and then we can stand there with a real a real assurance and that's uh when I look at this with job and where job is standing uh job is standing on on Solid Ground in his walk with God God but brother Brown tells us like this in I have heard but now I see he said but job had something wrong with him and he couldn't get the inspiration on him and it was worrying him anybody ever at Times wondered what's going on maybe only five of you ever worried that way I I mean I have what's going on sometimes in situations will take place what's happening what what's what's taking what's going on what's taking place you begin to examine your life whether it's the church whether it's family whatever you you begin to take it and examine your own life and so with job job was used to receiving inspiration from God now I don't know if job received inspiration daily I don't know if it was weekly or if it was monthly but at any point job had a connection with God where God would talk with him and the inspiration of the word would be given to job and So within it whatever that span of time and then then with what was taking place job could get no inspiration now I want you to think about this job actually would receive inspiration from God to be able to minister to others that were in the marketplace he would receive inspiration to minister to others that were around him God would release inspiration but for his own situation job had no inspiration at this moment and so because of that it was worrying him and look how brother Braham says this when you get in that kind of a fix that's when the enemy moves into every friend nearly you got now when we look at this of the thought I I'd like to speak once again tonight on that thought on why should I worry and we look at worry itself giving it it's actually to give away to anxiety or unease allow one's mind to dwell on difficulty or troubles to cause annoyance to to cause to feel anxiety or concern and no doubt maybe there's someone here tonight or some of us tonight that could look at that and say yep that's describing the feelings right now that could be going through me or it's describing feelings that have went through you because at some time or another we've all been worried or you can say concerned now I want to just say this right here tonight maybe before I make a step further that there is such a thing as a Godly worry you know when we look at it you would think a Godly worry how can that because worry would not be something that God would put on us but yet the prophet tells us that any Godly parent will have a Godly worry for their children they will have and so when you translate worry worry means concern now what matters when brother B say that it matters as to what a parent will do if a parent actually begins to take it so personal as though they're the ones to save them in other words they have got to be the ones to do the work and they've got to do and then then that worry it goes from being Godly to being ungodly because to be Godly worried is to go about it in the right way is to put it before God In Prayer to plead the blood over it and to say Lord help me to live such a life that will cause such a thirst Lord may you deal with them on their pillows at night Lord may you keep them Lord God keep them Lord from scars and things on their life may you Lord take a hold of their life may they come to know the same peace that you've given me Lord deal with them Lord you know their makeup you know how they're made up Lord you know Lord Jesus what it will take now father you're the same one who's got a hold of my life and I have got confidence in you you said that I could take this same token and have the confidence of what you've done in my life that you'll do the same miraculous Supernatural miracle in their life that you did in mine now that's taking it and keeping it as a Godly worry when we're praying over it but when it becomes something that we make exceptions and compromises and doing everything we can uh that goes outside of God's word and to where it actually begins to get us physically down then we've got to say wait a minute here it's moving from a Godly worry to ungodly youbody know what I'm talking about brother BR said even in the message he says that he had to catch himself because he saw the conditions of the world and how it was going and brother Bram said I have become I had become so worried he said that I almost had a breakdown two or three times and I had to realize and come back to what God had said in his word I mean who wouldn't be concerned you know if you're not concerned about your loved ones if you're not concerned about one another if you're not concerned about your brother and sister then then there's something wrong there's something a matter because there ought to be that desire on the inside I I don't believe that it's in any way that ifin our lives we just say well if they're predestinated they'll make it in and the reason you say brother samel how can you say it in that way because God's not flippant God himself when he predestinated us but he has made a way all the way God in other words you'll find that God was active to bring about what was needed to spark in our life that seed that he had swn there oh yeah so God just didn't say well if it'll be you know Cas sah sah that's not the attitude of God that's not the attitude of a Believer neither is it for you and I that I have to be the one and we get frustrated because we see I'm reaching out and they're going this way that that that's not of God either you you don't need to get frustrated with it just bring it right back into the word and say Lord I cast all of my cares upon you now my second Timothy 1:7 that's not even here in my notes but 2 Timothy 1:7 For God now I want you to watch this in the scripture for God hath not given us the spirit of fear so anything remember fear and worry It Works hand in hand with doubt and so forth so if anything that would come in that way that would work Upon Us in that negative way that never came from God so he's not given us the spirit of fear fear is uncertainty fear is torment but this is the spirit that God has given us of power of love and of a sound mind notice the contrast one works to unsettle the other works to settle yeah this is so when we look at here in the scriptures of Romans 8:15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father oh I'm so grateful for that aren't you amen I'm I'm grateful that not only can did he break the chains of sin and unbelief and doubt but I'm glad that he's still the same God that breaks the chains when fear or worry would want to go into such a way that it would actually affect our lives I'm grateful that God moves right around he gives us the strength to realize I do not have to operate in bondage to that of worry you say well why would that be because worry can affect our health worry itself can actually affect decisions you will make it will affect things in life and you know the enemy would love nothing more than to do that than just to plant a thought and then you start thinking upon that thought you dwell upon that thought I want you to remember every thought comes from a source every thought thoughts are not just random words that are flying in the air of people that all of a sudden had extra letters from a text or an email and they just show sh them out in into cyers space but every thought comes from a source and this is why the Bible said beloved try every Spirit try every thought you and I as Sons and Daughters of God we are given to Reign and Rule as Sons and Daughters of God by having the authority and jurisdiction over our lives to bring every single thought into judgment and I'll just tell you like this if there's a thought that's not willing to come to judgment and it seems like it's fighting it's very much so like that one of that person who had that robe appearing that would come there before those Believers and the believer said this seems very real seems very Supernatural it was a supernatural event but they said come and stand before Martin no sir that guy did not want to stand before Martin they said whether you want to or not you are coming to stand before Martin and when they brought him before Martin just as much as that robe supernaturally had appeared in the presence of Martin it supernaturally disappeared now it wasn't that Martin himself was anything but he recognized the authority of the word are you hearing me so you and I as a Believer we have an authority and matter of fact an admonition to bring every thought subject to The Obedience of Christ my I'll tell you when we will we will do that it will save us a whole lot of trouble so this of worry and how when we look through the scriptures of there of a discernment and we want to have that where the spirit of God will help us and give us discernment because when we look at you know many of you you think about even uh displacement you know you think think about having a cup and you feel that cup to the water to the brim with water now if I were to give you a handful of ice you would look at that and say Brother Sam hold on hold on hold on hold on careful I need to pour some of this water out well why do you need to pour some of that out because if I don't when you put that load of ice in there it's going to displace a lot of water that's in there because the ice forces it out and I'll tell you right now we can sit here we could join hands and say don't worry don't worry don't worry but there's one thing that God knows that you and I have need of more and more and more in our life we need more of the love of God because when we receive more of God's Divine love I'll tell you it's like taking you know that cup like that it might be filled with water but when God's love is coming down it brings into our life a displacement of worry it does amen that's real casting off is't it the Bible said perfect love casteth out all fear and I love that in the scripture that phrase casteth out it means to actually if I were to take this and just throw it and I don't care where it lands in other words I'm no longer worried don't you love the word of God now I want you to look at this I read this quote to you last week but I want to read it as we're looking at this of a of a spirit and how Spirits would come around in that of worry because remember job himself the Bible or brother BR tells us in three kinds of Believers and I've read this quote to you over and over but he said as long as Satan could make J believe it was his God doing it he had job whipped now that thought wasn't coming from God but and the thought itself job was standing against his friends that said you're a secret sinner job Knew by the word I've done everything that the word has asked for me to do I'm standing righteous but he could not understand why is this happening so Satan just takes a moment to interject a thought remember how brother Bram talks about cancer to me it's absolutely phenomenal when brother Bram will talk about cancer he said it starts out with a little bruised cell and he said through that little bruise cell then a little life enters in there and begins to live off of the bloodstream isn't it amazing how Satan is an opportunistic he'll take when bruising has come spiritually Even in our lives offenses and everything else and he will come in listen Satan doesn't care if you've lost a loved one he'll see that oh that's an opp opportunity time and he will move right in with something that's so contrary to that to do what try to work and hinder and bring us down is that right Satan he's and that's why brother Bam could say in greatest B fault he said Satan oh that vile enemy he said he he'll light right into a child he'll light right into anyone he don't care Satan doesn't care how beautiful the baby is he doesn't even care how bad the situation or maybe things of of what has gone through with the family Satan does not hold off at that time but he will try to find some sort of a little bruise or something he can move into to interject a thought and then we can just start dwelling on that thought and a boy after a time it's like a baby that starts developing in the womb right and it has different ways it gives birth in our life but I want you to watch how this of a spirit the true and false Vine brother Ram says now this woman she's standing near she has a real dismal funny Spirit watch how he describes this it's a spirit of worry and fearful she's all nervous and upset and she's bothered a lot with a nervous Condition it's about a condition of her body that she's worrying about she's planning on an examination at a clinic kind of a hospital clinic Affair for cancer it's a cancer that you're worried about so it isn't so much that she's worried about the clinic it's what test that she's going to be tested for and how that that in itself can get right you realize when there's certain diagnosis of charts I think listen this is just this isn't gospel it's just brother Samuel's thoughts but I think sometimes when some you know we have all this access to our medical records now you can get in if so and so has just tested you and done blood work you know you can get into your chart and if you're not careful you'll become the own interpreter of those results and you didn't even go to you didn't go to one Medical School you didn't go to one class at all and you're sitting there trying to read that that's true and if you're not careful your pro your appointment might not be for two weeks later but you have made adjustments in your own life just based on what you've read in that report and you're not even qualified to read that report that's so true but you see what it is look in this age so much information is given to us and sometimes friends sometimes the information we have I'm glad that there's certain things that we're able to access into and tap into and I think about you know the the the kids and things like that I remember when I used to have to go to the library and stay in there when I do reports and everything else and then it got to a place of my I can sit right there and I can have access to all the research that I need to do and bring it right in to the same channel but yet at the same time the Bible tells us that as that as Generations would go on we get smarter wiser and weaker and the information sometimes that we have that is at our fingertips the things that then we look at and think oh my oh oh my goodness oh oh could this be and yet then oh and you know we listen friends sometimes when a report comes our way listen don't ever let the devil try to wear you out for having any sort of a worry and you go get a test or the worry about well I don't know what this result listen you have a high priest who's touched by the feeling of your infirmities you can say Lord I'm not qualified to read these results but you already knew it was there and if there's something that's there you're still my healer if it's not you're still my healer Lord I am going to commit my life completely and this situation into your hands and if you find troubled then find find a brother sister somebody else around you husband and wife say hey let's go to prayer about this cuz we're not going to let this dominate our life so it should sometimes we do respond upon concerns now brother BR said in regarding to this woman you were praying before coming and it was revealed to you as you were praying that if you would come here and I would pray for you that they'd find no cancer one thing that she did that was absolutely the right thing to do was pray that was the right thing to do instead of worrying about it and you know going to this one going to that one going to this one going to that one oh I don't know and those things can be fearful Hey listen the word cancer itself it carries a tormenting Spirit matter of fact any disease or sickness to it it carries a tormenting Spirit but to see that with this right here that even when that itself that word could be mentioned but notice how this little lady did she went to God In Prayer friends I believe this with all my heart I have found this in my own life it's things that continually that even when I feel in a moment of worry I have to be reminded of this there is no other source I know that I appreciate my wife I love my wife her and I have wonderful Fellowship together but there's nobody that can minister to what I have need of when I am worried like the Lord now God can use her and he has used her many different times to minister to me even when I have been worried but I would say this right here do not become resting upon other people make the the Lord your Refuge because God knows what you have need of now this is where we we come as children of God in Mark 16:1 17 the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now I want you to think brother bam will take this scripture and remember he talks about Paul of how that Viper came up in that when Paul was getting firewood and that Viper came up and laid hold on Paul and the Bible tells us that Paul shook it off into the fire brother Brown will take that and he'll you know TI he'll bring it in with that of how that Paul was not going out to be a snake Handler but Paul was going about his what would be a task at that time to get that wood and he said what when that when that latched on that Viper remember how all the people to the island gathered around and they're just watching at him I mean looking at him you know and just waiting to see him fall over cuz they knew what a bite and what Venom that Viper had but Paul had shook it off into the fire now you know these are things when brother R will say it like this he'll take that of the Viper he'll take that and say when you're actually cooking your eggs he said and that grease pops out of the pan and it hits your it hits your hand he said and you quickly go and grab that bottle of I don't know what the stuff's called I don't really know how to pronounce it but whatever it is to put on that burn he said it's not the grease that burns you it's the fear that burns you figure that one out why don't you it's a fear that burns you what was it with Paul if Paul would allow that that that particular that serpent to have get to him and get in his mind Lord have mercy you'd read a different story is that right but it wasn't that Paul was a superhuman oh brother Samuel he was a prophet of God let me remind you the prophets were subject to like passion such as we are is that right you're in the line of duty something comes along like this you can say Lord you are my healer now notice they C in my name they shall cast out Devils what that tells me is there will be Spirits Devils it tells me that there will be encroachments of the enemy but God has commanded us us to cast him out and you know what that is that's acting just like him of what he did in heaven when Satan beginning begin to act up in heaven he cast him out he didn't ask him to leave hey hey Mr Lucifer do you think y'all could go ahead he cast him out and that's what this word cast means to cast out drive out send out to command or cause one to depart in haste and to reject with contempt and cast off for a away greatest batt ever fought Satan's Army brings diseases and God's Army is commissioned to cast them out there you are every time Satan throws any on you onto you God's Army is to cast him out so anytime any sickness or disease comes on you God's Army is commanded to cast him out now watch that's the very technique that God used Satan used the army of Destruction to disbelieve God's word and set him up a better Kingdom than Michael had and God cast him out God's method how many want to use God's method God's method is cast out the evil cast down reasoning cast down Superstition cast down Google I'm sorry cast down worry cast down diseases cast down sin amen yes you're here's how you can do it you're above it Resurrected in Christ Jesus setting in Heavenly places with every devil under your foot if he starts to stick his head in there that's the privilege you have as being a child of God filled with the spirit of God that every devil is under your foot Hallelujah it doesn't matter if he comes to stick his head in there that has nothing to do with it it's where you have authority to cast him out are you hearing me but in our mind sometimes we have that that thinking of casting out as instantaneously sometimes it is sometimes it is sometimes right where hands are being laid on it's cast out right while the preaching you realize right while the preaching of the word goes on there are devils that are being scattered well well the word's being preached unbelief is being cut away is that right diseases sicknesses being healed what is it we're battling Spirits that's why when we come here we are not not coming here to a picnic this is a Battleground it's a war we are coming here once again to declare in a war on Satan's kingdom noce he says you are dead and your life is hid what is dead you're dead to your senses you're dead to your conscience your own human will would say yes I guess I but you're dead to your reasoning dead to all those things and you are buried in the name of of Jesus Christ and raised with him and wherever he is there you are also he raised above every principality power is that right he did the Holy Ghost inside of you is not the third person of the godhead it's the same portion of the same God Who Rose on that Easter morning and he sent back the Holy Ghost you listen you didn't need the fullness you received your portion and your portion was a enough to whip every devil out of hell that portion of your inheritance was enough to overcome Satan's kingdom and you to stand victorious in this hour even as we read in this quote when your own human will would say I guess anybody ever have to battle with that human will anybody have to crucify him daily well I do I got both my hands up I've got to crucify that human will listen this is one of the reasons not only for Redemption that God become human become one of us but God himself he begin to experience the Bible said he learned obedience by the things that he suffered why because to obey the word is not always something that feels good neither is it something that is always going to be pleasing or comfortable for the flesh but to obey the word of God is greater than any sacrifice we could make with the flesh it's to obey the word of God and he learned obedience by the things that he suffered what was it nevertheless not my will thine will be done brother BR tells us there he says in Hebrews 5 he was heard even with strong tears and crying in that he that he had cried in that he had suffered and brother B said here he was contending with himself that shouldn't be no who do you contend with who do I contend with right this this right here on the outside this is not the deity this is not this is only like this this screen or this wall that's what this is it allows the invisible to be made visible Hallelujah right but I always you know think about what if we had graffiti road all over this wall well you could still project it same thing on now on that screen back there but it wouldn't look just right so our duty is Lord I want to keep this house this it's a past house but I want to keep my life such in a place to where the image of Christ is projected without compromise notice brother B says what happened to him one of them doubters got in heaven God kicked him out and what did he say to the soldiers that's raised in Christ how many of you Soldier Hallelujah when a devil comes along kick him out cast him out don't ask him to leave cast him out brother B tells us in 1965 ashamed he's talking about his own self he said I feel like it's got to a place with me to where I'm asking the devil would you mind to leave he said but that is not what God has called me to do God has called me to cast him out amen doesn't mean through indifference it does listen because devils are not cast out by cruel and indifferent living the way that Satan is overcome is by the love of God pulsating in our Our Lives amall is that right notice 1 Peter 5:7 casting all your care this word care means anxieties and worries casting all your care upon him for he carth for you now watch how brother brandwood bring this he says in the message expectation he said you've got something on your mind that you're worried about you're upset I see something hanging near you you you're upset about something aren't you you're worried now I said be honest with me it's something you're worrying about here it comes it's concerning childbirth you're afraid of a miscarriage which being pregnant don't worry go and Jesus Christ probably what follow make you well he said let's say praise be to God to Jesus Christ let's give God praise like this the people glorify God now he said said goes on to say he's here to make well to heal to do all things the reason I kept holding on with the lady I try not to hold on those people too long if I see one thing I just let it go but the lady was stumped when I said she was worrying about something and I noticed then and I seen what she was worried about and I went ahead till her faith got confirmed how many of you are glad I know I'm thankful I'm glad that God just don't pass me on by but God will hold me right here amall I'm glad that God will take a man of God move him off his notes if need be hold me right here till my faith is Right Lord hold me right here Lord till everything is just right Glory he knows what what we're concerned about he knows what our worries and we're standing here not because we want to keep our cares but I want to cast on my care upon him for he carth for you notice he says sometimes you have to talk longer than others but of course that lightens brings the crowd down and may have to cut it off short and be reverent now he said all right lady talking to the same sister everybody be reverent you are blessed my sister don't you fear you only have faith now why would brother randam tell her this don't you fear because he knows that Satan is going to be right there to come back and try to poke it around again she sees a little something that's out of the way feels a little something that's out of the way with her pregnancy and immediately the enemy would want to move in and say it could be this ah it could be this now I don't think I'm the only one that that old sloot's tried to do that to that's right you are blessed my sister don't you fear you only have faith don't let nobody put nothing else in your mind you're going to be all right now let me just say if this if this was me which I believe many of us maybe we haven't been called out just like that but the spirit of God has dealt with our heart right in the midst of a service maybe you've been at prayer at home maybe listening to a message and the spirit of God has spoke like that right in our hearts right then don't turn around and turn to the Earthly worldly measures of carnal reasoning but brother Samuel I've got to have a test on her I've got to have this but you're not turning around and looking at it and going to entertain fear or doubt or I'm going to go and see what so and so says and I'm going to give I'm going to go check out and see what my my cousin's cousin you know who's a nursea a nurse Tech and see what she has to say about it why don't you just take it to Dr Jesus because even if nurse Tech so and so knows this and knows that it will never bring you peace but there is a place where we can go to and that's him that's even when you can't get a hold of brother Samuel you can't get a hold of nobody else you have an access 247 a hotline to Jesus yes sir now watch this in questions and answers part one brother bman I I want to just I want to just read this when we're looking at this of effects of how that Satan would desire just to take even certain circumstances of life and as we said use a circumstance of life to then interject worry and then ultimately to tear us down watch how brother Bram and question answerers 64 dear brother brandham my wife and I were separated she is suing me for a divorce she's not a Christian and I believe the message and I want her to be saved brother say ain't that really nice that's a real Christian spirit and believe what must I do we also have two boys and they signed their your name brother brother R's brother look let me tell you she's going to sue you for a divorce that's Satan you shouldn't do that but if you're a Christian and done nothing in the world to hinder that woman then it's Satan doing that he's only trying to tear you up now why would brother Bram say that because in order to minister the remedy if there's anything that man has done in not standing steadfast as he ought to as a Real Son of God he's got to be able to he's got to make that right in order to experience a real release in this hour come on friends this is why brother Bram says this brother Bram talks about it you know and he I I preach that message on he careth for you and dealing with principles of Deliverance remember brother Bram says he was up in Bellingham New York he said I had people come through the prayer line and they came through the prayer line and he said after they came out of the prayer line he said here they were he said the next day or two with the same condition going on in their life brother R said I thought what in the world is going on he said but what the angel of the Lord told me he said you bring those people up there and you have them to repent of what's wrong in their life brother BR said what it was this is very powerful he said what it was when they came across there in the presence of the Angel of the Lord it took the condition away but because they weren't right in their heart it allowed Satan to move back in wow wow brother Bram takes a whole month of 63 and he deals with this whole principle and he's even looking from previously in his ministry to understand why are the people unstable now why is what I want you to see is because if you're a Christian and done nothing in the world to hinder that woman then it's Satan doing that he's only trying to tear you up now watch this if she's one of God's elected she'll come to it if she's not she's not worth worrying about if you worry watch this if you worry it'll break down your health and that's what Satan wants to do wow he's working I know at you so you just commit the whole thing to God and go right on serving God just as happy as you can be God will take care of the rest of it now this going to be important I don't know what happened with this man but if this man ends this moment this service with a butt he'll carry this from now on he has to be able to accept God's word listen friends there's no greater remedy than the word of God I I I I don't believe we need listen I I appreciate other books I appreciate other things I'm not against brother BR said anything that helps is of God is helps is Godly but I look at it and I think Lord has put promise after promise and God in this generation would allow things like this to be recorded it could have stopped right after brother randam got done preaching but I thank God for these situations that are mentioned in here why for you and I to draw strength from because I'm not standing as as this man stood no doubt there's many of you is not standing in the same shoes that this man is standing in but we all have or are or will experience worry in some form or another and to remember no matter what it is Satan's objective is to try to tear you down why cuz if he can get you down in your Tabernacle in your spirit in your mind you're not effective that's right is that right oh my God will take care of the rest of it all that the father has given me will come to me get down on your knees look at this I'll pray with you or anything I'll pray over the matter and just say I always love this when when the prophet just gives us the words to pray just say Lord God I love her she's the mother of my children and say I just commit the whole thing to you Lord I want them saved you know I do but I can't go no further she's going to divorce me and I haven't done nothing if I have reveal it to me I'll go make it right I'll do anything then commit it to the Lord and just let it alone just let it alone go right on living just as nothing had ever happened and God will take care of the rest of it now if you ask ask me and expect me to explain how that happens I can't explain that but I do know this that I have experienced things that to me it's It's Supernatural of things that I have worried carried as burdens and then just in that moment to where it's been committed to him and and you just you feel a peace about it oh you you feel a you feel a I don't know how it's going to come out but hey there's a peace about this let me tell you I would rather have that peace than for God to come down and tell me this is going to happen this is going to happen this is going to happen why cuz I might get worried between that this is going to happen this is going to happen this is going to happen but if God deposits a fresh deposit of Peace regarding a situation what will it do it will dissolve or displace my worry that's so good yes sir yes sir now can I have just a few more moments watch this I want you to watch this effects here let me read a few scripture a few verses or out of the message quotes brother BR says you're suffering with many things 1950 one thing that you're real nervous you're weak and your strength well he said here it is it's a stomach trouble that you have now what's caused this sister is a nervous condition so she has a stomach trouble but the cause of it is a nervous condition now you see one thing about God God will not just give you and I and I'm grateful he won't just take care of what is it that's trouble because there's probably every one of us at times we've had certain things to Lord I need a real touch from you and sometimes what God touches Us in the infirmity in our body is not really the cause that's good right but God has a way to go down to what's causing it that's why brother Brandon would say over and over he carth for you he cares do you care in 1963 brother Brandon would repeat these things over and over he says we know the Cure the answer is Christ but we've got to find the call cause of it we got to find the cause of it now watch he says what's caused this sister is a nervous Condition it's a peptic ulcer in your stomach it causes pains and souring of the stomach and unrest and sometimes you think you have heart trouble but that's not heart trouble you're talking about an MRI who yes sir quit worrying about that usually when you lay down you'll have that that's a gas on your stomach stomachs pressing against your heart it isn't heart trouble your heart's all right now I believe God's going to make you well sister do you believe it with all your heart he has made you well there it is it's gone see

distressed you believe me as God's servant you believe that this Spirit the spir this is spirit of God is here now if I shall touch you you'll get well oh you're an awful deep thinker aren't you sister got a weary Spirit too always worrying about things that's good you haven't got no business to be maybe I should just come right down here y'all want to come up here and read this quote to me I'm I'm not the only one in here am I no no sir you see friends when I'm studying the message of the hour when I'm listening to it I'm not just studing and say how can it be for this one look I this word it comes to examine my life it's God ministering to our lives together collectively don't ever think that a minister is one who's up here and ministering to these sorry people down here God works with experiences in the man's life to be able to minister with compassion Lord You're an awful deep thinker aren't you sister got a weary Spirit too always worrying about things you haven't got no business to be you're nervous upset watch this caused you to have acid in your blood which has give you arthritis wow wow wow now he didn't just say I'll tell you what that arthritis go take some ibuprofen take three of them drink lots of water with it make sure you take something on your stomach ain't nothing wrong with ibuprofen Motrin leave whatever it is but notice sometimes the things that we're treating are coming from a different Source we're saying God heal me of my arthritis God heal me of my stiffness God heal me of this and yet what's causing it is worry I tell you what you cannot there ain't no amount of money you could pay for this kind of MRI that's right Absolut well the devil ain't got a place to hide with this oh my let me let me finish out here Proverbs 18:10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous walk into it runthe and is safe yes sir the name of the Lord is who he is it's his word being revealed he is our source our Avenue of strength I don't want to just look at it when he makes himself known I want to run run into him that's right Isaiah 32:1 Behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock hallelujah in a weary land now do you notice he didn't say and a man shall take away all of those conditions but he said this is what he'll be to you Hallelujah he'll be your covert he'll be your shelter when you're dry he'll be as rivers of water glory be to God oh my no wonder the prophet could say in letting off the pressure he said no matter what takes place Christ is our refuge and when we come to him we can let off the pressure you can quit worrying about well if I die what's going to happen to me what's going to happen to the wife what's going to happen to the husband what's going to happen to the children just come to Christ and let off the pressure all he give us all things all things are ours by Christ so just let the pressure off and the only way you can do it oh goes on to say somebody could give you a million dollars and it would build up pressure you'd be worrying I wonder if so and so they they're probably thinking I need to give them something they're they're probably thinking that I should I should what would that cause worry worry worry but in this incredible of what the Lord Jesus will give you will actually take away your worry that's right and as we can where we will open up and you let him be our source it'll displace worry in our life it'll be like a that those handfuls of ice cubes coming down in that cup and the water just going out and pretty soon when I hand you the cup you say well there's only a little bit of water in here well why is that because the ice cubes have displaced it oh I pray to God that there be such a such a filling of the love of God move down our life Lord displace every fear every worry every doubt every concern let it come down lord God and displace all of my worry you love him tonight the world goes to many different resources to let off their worry matter of fact the world drowns it right they'll go they'll spend money that they don't even have they'll go down and they'll do things to themselves and their bodies and they got to wake up tomorrow morning and face the same exact things right but there's a place you see as as I was telling the young people there on Friday we're not exempt brother Bram says pressure makes the good act this way makes the bad act this way makes the rich act this way makes the wrong act this way pressure itself he says it'll cause us to act out if things that we have to go and say forgive me I I didn't mean to say it that way what is it it's pressure but there is a place that you and I have access to and if you've never found him and let him become your place of Refuge to where that the worries about what are people going to think about me what is this going to be where you can come to have a place in Christ you've got a place to let off the pressure a place to where everything is settled it doesn't mean that we know what tomorrow holds and and this is going to happen and that that's that's not it that's not what faith is Faith is trusting God faith is now right now this is God's will for the moment I'm just going to abide in this moment and when the next step is shown I'll step there faith is now I'll stand there and I going to keep standing and I'm going to keep walking in his promises you don't you to love him yes sir can I read one more quote to you brother Bram said he Saidi met a woman here some time ago in a 10-cent store she was 60 years old and looked about 30 years old I said how do you do it sister how do you do it sister she said brother Bram I've got two sons that's doctors that's older than you are and honest to goodness she didn't look over 30 years old she said here is what it was when I come to Christ I was about 12 years old I said down and thought about it and I studied other religions but when I found the true one she said I come to Christ and took my case my soul my all to him and she said I've never had a worry since now he promised I love this now he promised to take care of all my troubles and said if he's not big enough to do it I know I'm not big enough to do it so

complexities of our life that have nothing to do with a doctor's report at all but yet father in your grace you come down and as your Prophet said You Dig It All Out Of Us Lord thank you Lord thank you for your mercies Lord Lord I'm so thankful Lord we can see your presence working we sense it in our lives Lord God how you're moving and you're helping us you didn't take away the Tempest you don't take away the dryness but you said I'll be just what you have need of in every situation when the wind is strong I'll be your shelter when there's a time of weariness in the land I'll Be Your Shadow thank you Lord when there's dry times I'll be your River of Life Lord Jesus you are all things to us Lord Lord Oh Lord I'm so glad I'm so glad to be in this city of Refuge I'm so glad to be in

our way but we've got a place in you Lord where we can let off the pressure you Lord Jesus how we thank you Father for your mercy I pray that if there's one Lord that's not experienced that release May they Lord recognize tonight there is a place of release for them Lord where they don't have to carry around the load of sin they don't have to look over their back but God they can stand in a place where the grace of God moves down and begins to lift all the burdens of sin to begin to lift all the condemnation and begin to reveal in a more greater way who they are always were as a son and daughter of God lord Jesus no wonder your Prophet could say when a man or woman has been born again by the spirit of God and he would say this as he was holding a little baby dedicating it at the altar he said when we have been born again we are more innocent than one of these babies that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ being applied in her lifeall it brings back and reveals innocency it reveals Lord and the pressure is let off how thankful we are for it Lord I pray that God May there not be one Lord that would leave out if there's a worry and they're worried about tomorrow worried about this worried about that Lord may they valuate if they're not in you where they need to be then they should be worried but worried Lord and a concern to say Lord I want every part of my life even my big toe I wanted under the blood nothing out outside of the blood because under the blood it's safety it's safety like your Prophet said that howling of that Death Angel could come through there and he said that little boy would look up at his daddy and say daddy is it going to be all right yes son it's fine because we have done what Jehovah told us to do we have applied the blood but daddy I'm your firstborn ain't I yeah but but didn't it say that he was coming for the firstborn that's true my son but there is one you see that blood Hallelujah there's one that's took your place so that you might live and go free yes Lord Death has already come to this house the Lamb's blood speaks peace Lord we thank you tonight for your mercy thank you Lord for your grace to live and walk in this hour as a son and daughter of God to live in Victory Lord I pray tonight if there's anything that Lord would be troubling any mind or any Heart Lord right now father any report or something Lord that would want to bring worry to your children I pray tonight God May Lord Jesus may that be dismissed Lord in the name of Jesus Christ if it's a worry Lord about getting into that place of Refuge then I ask that you wouldn't let that up Lord but I pray that God any anything other than that for a child of God is standing here fully in you may you Lord dismiss every worry in the name of Jesus Christ go with us Lord we pray we love you and we thank you tonight Lord thank you for your mercies thank you for Lord speaking to our hearts once again help us Lord to act like you did over there in heaven

around the thought wants to bring anything into our mind we've got a right to cast him out help us Lord I pray may we take your word above every thought above every feeling because your word is true
