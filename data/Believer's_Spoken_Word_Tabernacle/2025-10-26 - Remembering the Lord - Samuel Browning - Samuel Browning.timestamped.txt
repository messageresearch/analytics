[27:43] Overcome every test and trial, guiding
[27:47] me constantly.
[27:49] [Music]
[27:51] Hallelujah. Giving me victory.
[27:57] Oh, he is my reality.
[28:02] for something keeps holding me.
[28:08] Oh my. Oh, Satan lay before me
[28:15] his temptation.
[28:21] It was his desire
[28:24] to steal away my faith.
[28:31] But aren't you glad this morning that
[28:33] thou have found inside
[28:37] that hidden revelation.
[28:42] Oh, it was a strength I needed to keep
[28:48] me in his grace.
[28:52] And I can testify that something keeps
[28:55] holding me.
[28:58] Oh hallelujah.
[29:00] [Music]
[29:02] For every day that I cease
[29:06] faithfully
[29:08] to overcome
[29:10] my trial.
[29:14] Oh, he's guiding me constantly
[29:20] giving.
[29:23] Oh yes, Lord. Lord, you are my reality.
[29:28] I know that son.
[29:32] Oh, hallelujah. Let's sing this now.
[29:34] Jesus keeps holding. Oh, Jesus keeps
[29:37] holding me. Yes, Lord. Oh, every day.
[29:44] Hallelujah, Lord.
[29:49] Thank you, Jesus.
[29:51] Hallelujah.
[29:53] Oh, thank you for being a faithful
[29:54] father and friend to us, Lord. You are
[29:57] guiding me constantly.
[30:01] Oh yes, giving me the victory.
[30:07] Lord, you are my reality.
[30:10] I know Jesus is holding me. Amen. As
[30:15] brother Samuel comes, let's sing that
[30:16] just one more time. Oh, Jesus keeps
[30:19] holding me.
[30:24] Every day I see
[30:29] he's helping me faithfully
[30:33] to overcome
[30:35] my trials.
[30:39] Oh, he's guiding me constantly,
[30:44] [Music]
[30:46] giving me victory.
[30:50] Oh, he is a reality.
[30:55] Jesus keeps holding me
[31:01] for he is our reality
[31:07] which Jesus keeps holding
[31:10] me.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:16] [Applause]
[31:17] [Music]
[31:19] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you just love him this
[31:24] morning? So thankful for his mercy.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; That song such a has such meaning in it.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. To our lives. We're so thankful
[31:35] for God's grace
[31:37] this morning. And just want to invite
[31:40] you if you'd like to stand and u we'll
[31:42] go right into the word.
[31:46] So, so thankful to have each and every
[31:47] one of you here. Amen. God bless you and
[31:50] good to see some of you that were away.
[31:52] Good to see you're back home.
[31:55] Amen. It's always good to be together.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; I want to read
[32:01] very um familiar place of scripture that
[32:04] we would read from in that of communion.
[32:09] And uh I actually had a different way I
[32:13] was going to go with a thought and then
[32:15] yesterday morning real early the Lord
[32:17] just just changed it. So
[32:22] I believe that God is mindful of our
[32:24] needs. Don't you? I believe he is. And
[32:26] so I just we just want to draw from him
[32:28] because he's the one that can help us.
[32:31] Let's look here in the scripture 1
[32:33] Corinthians 11. And
[32:36] I know it's a little bit of a scripture
[32:38] reading and maybe we'll just read these
[32:40] first few verses together and then we
[32:43] will uh have our seats and I'll finish
[32:45] reading.
[32:47] Amen.
[32:50] For I have received of the Lord that
[32:53] which also I delivered unto you, that
[32:57] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[33:00] he was betrayed, took bread. And when he
[33:03] had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[33:06] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[33:10] broken for you.
[33:12] This do in remembrance of me."
[33:16] After the same manner also he took the
[33:18] cup and when he had sucked, saying,
[33:21] "This cup is the new testament in my
[33:25] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[33:29] it in remembrance of me."
[33:33] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[33:34] prayer.
[33:38] Lord Jesus,
[33:42] we love you, Lord.
[33:47] It's the greatest privilege of our life,
[33:49] Lord.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; To be able to serve you, Lord.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Father, we we did not know who we were.
[33:58] We didn't know you, Lord.
[34:01] Father, sometimes through glimpses,
[34:03] Lord, that maybe wherever we started our
[34:05] journey at, oh God, you mean so much
[34:10] more to us this morning.
[34:14] Oh God, you're more than than life to
[34:17] us. Lord,
[34:19] &gt;&gt; you've given us life, Lord.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; You're our strength, Lord. Oh God, how
[34:25] we are so thankful that you found us,
[34:28] Lord, and you brought us to yourself.
[34:31] We so appreciate your mercies, Lord. I
[34:35] pray, God, may your blessing, Lord, just
[34:37] continue upon this service. May you come
[34:40] and just deliver the word to our hearts
[34:44] Lord. May our lives be Lord just
[34:48] encouraged Lord in your presence and may
[34:50] we see you Lord.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord. Father if our vision Lord
[34:56] has become cloudy, may you come Lord
[34:59] this morning and may we see Lord just a
[35:02] fresh vision of you Lord. Oh God, would
[35:06] you just grace us Lord with your
[35:08] presence this morning in each of our
[35:10] lives and may you come Lord here in this
[35:13] service Lord and just Lord fulfill every
[35:17] single need and every request upon every
[35:20] heart, every Lord Jesus desire Lord that
[35:24] we would have in you. May you just come
[35:27] in a special way here this morning Lord.
[35:30] We give ourselves to you, Father, and
[35:33] ask that you would forgive us, Lord, of
[35:35] our shortcomings, Lord. And we pray,
[35:38] heavenly father, may your grace now just
[35:41] move among us in a special way in Jesus
[35:44] name. Amen. May God bless you as you're
[35:47] being seated.
[35:54] Paul would go on in verse 26 and say,
[35:57] "For as often as you eat this bread
[36:01] and drink this cup, you do show the
[36:03] Lord's death
[36:06] till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall
[36:09] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[36:11] Lord unworthily
[36:13] shall be guilty of the body and the
[36:15] blood of the Lord. But let a man examine
[36:19] himself, and so let him eat of that
[36:21] bread, and drink of that cup. For he
[36:24] that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily,
[36:26] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[36:28] himself, and not discerning the Lord's
[36:31] body.
[36:33] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[36:35] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[36:38] would judge ourselves,
[36:40] we should not be judged. But when we are
[36:43] judged, we are chasened of the Lord that
[36:46] we should not be condemned with the
[36:48] world.
[36:50] You know, when I read those verses of
[36:52] scripture in 31 and 32,
[36:55] you see God's mercy that he has equipped
[36:58] us to be able to judge ourselves.
[37:03] And yet there's times that when you
[37:06] think of his faithfulness that where
[37:10] u for whatever reason maybe something
[37:12] has built up in our life and we
[37:16] don't want to deal with it and the enemy
[37:18] wants to put fear of when you if you
[37:21] would deal with that or shame but you
[37:24] know God Satan's always busy with trying
[37:27] to try to stifle that about our lives
[37:31] because it's because of his spirit in
[37:34] our life that allows us to be able to
[37:36] really judge ourselves correctly.
[37:39] And if we fail to to do that, God
[37:44] doesn't leave us. His presence would
[37:46] pull back from us. But God is going to
[37:48] see to it that every one of his
[37:50] children, every one of us are brought
[37:53] back in line and in harmony with his
[37:55] word,
[37:56] you know, and so he'll he'll bring
[37:58] correction our way. There's things, you
[37:59] know, that he can bring different
[38:01] permit. I'll say permit of different
[38:04] things. But when he permits those
[38:05] things, torments and other things like
[38:07] that, that's all for our good to bring
[38:11] us back in line in harmony with him
[38:14] because God made a way that there is
[38:17] nothing, no nothing anymore in our life
[38:20] that should reign above him.
[38:24] And he made a way through the shedding
[38:25] of his blood to where that even he would
[38:27] deal with so personally in our lives of
[38:30] even things that we maybe have never
[38:32] thought of or we are would ponder and
[38:35] wonder of how can I do this or why do I
[38:38] respond this way or why is this and God
[38:40] you know it's the mercy of God to even
[38:42] bring you to that place to realize that
[38:44] you're not your situations or whatever
[38:47] in your life are not irreparable
[38:50] &gt;&gt; because when when when when brother Bram
[38:52] tells when he redeemed us as the kinsman
[38:55] redeemer, he redeemed it all.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; And so God, your situation or my
[39:00] situation, your complexes or my
[39:02] complexes or anything that you would
[39:05] deal with, all of those things, those
[39:07] become opportunities that God brings us
[39:10] to for his grace to step down in our
[39:13] life. And then it adds to your testimony
[39:16] of what God's overcoming grace that not
[39:19] only what he started in your life and
[39:21] how he moved down in your life, you
[39:23] surrendered to him, but then even in
[39:26] that to continue to surrender to his
[39:29] divine working in our life in order that
[39:32] his will can be done in our lives. I'm
[39:35] glad there's been many projects that
[39:37] I've started, I've I've got into, and
[39:40] I've realized I was way over my head.
[39:42] There's things that all of a sudden then
[39:44] you need, you know, you need to call on
[39:45] a professional. But I'm so grateful that
[39:48] God, he doesn't need to call on anyone
[39:51] else.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; There's not one of our lives, there's
[39:54] not one situation, I don't care where
[39:56] it's at, where he has to look to
[39:58] anywhere else. And neither do we.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; He is the allsufficient God.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; And he in everything. You can say it in
[40:06] this way. And sure, we sometimes we we
[40:08] look and we have situations in our life
[40:11] and and and it does it brings us within
[40:14] that place of conviction. That is true.
[40:16] But I want you to understand that he
[40:18] within all of the attributes of who he
[40:21] is. He has everything covered for your
[40:23] life.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; And he manifest himself just like the
[40:26] seven compound redemptive names of
[40:28] Jehovah. Those were not just manifested
[40:31] when there wasn't a crisis. But as a
[40:33] matter of fact, that's when he
[40:34] manifested who he was was when there was
[40:37] a crisis. Was when there was a situation
[40:40] such as I don't feel I can go on or a
[40:42] situation when Israel was at their end
[40:44] in the middle of a battle. But God would
[40:46] step in and reveal himself to them. And
[40:49] he didn't just do that for them, but he
[40:51] did that for us. And how many times has
[40:54] he revealed himself in so many different
[40:56] ways to us in our lives? And that's his
[40:59] loving care over our lives. So how how
[41:04] what a precious thing to be able to come
[41:06] together here uh this morning. Paul goes
[41:09] on to say, "Wherefore, my brethren, when
[41:11] you come together to eat, terry for one
[41:13] another. It's considering one another
[41:15] and praying for one another." And Lord,
[41:18] don't let my brother or sister do
[41:19] anything that would be wrong. And Lord,
[41:21] help my brother. Help my sister. Lord,
[41:23] give them grace even as they would stand
[41:25] here. Lord, don't allow the enemy to
[41:27] torment them. Lord and trouble them
[41:29] because when sins have been confessed,
[41:33] they are put under the blood.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; And that's not just something we use
[41:37] lightly. But John would even write under
[41:39] the inspiration and say, "My little
[41:41] children, I write that you sin not."
[41:44] &gt;&gt; But if we sin,
[41:47] &gt;&gt; we have an advocate
[41:49] &gt;&gt; with the father.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, you're not left without
[41:53] a way back.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:58] Yes, sir.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; He is our propituation.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; And the propitation of the entire world.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; He's the all of it. That's why I think
[42:10] when brother Brandham said he could have
[42:12] wrote in his word. I was wounded for
[42:14] William Brham's transgressions. I was
[42:17] bruised for William Brandham's
[42:18] iniquities. He said, but I'm glad that
[42:20] he didn't write my name in there because
[42:22] I could have had a question. Is it me?
[42:24] The William Brandom he's talking about.
[42:27] But but he mentioned whosoever will.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; And when he wrote that in the word, it
[42:31] becomes so personal to you to where
[42:33] &gt;&gt; you see your name in the word. He was he
[42:36] was bruised for Brian Hannah's
[42:37] transgressions. He was wounded for Dave
[42:40] Crest's iniquities. He the chastisement
[42:43] of of his peace was was laid forth for
[42:46] Roseanne Campbell. It was it becomes
[42:49] personal because then you're reading the
[42:50] book and the book itself you become like
[42:53] the little woman down in Memphis. You
[42:54] begin to look in situations and say,
[42:57] "God, as Yosha, my woman, where's your
[43:00] prophet?
[43:03] &gt;&gt; You're a prayer answering God. And and
[43:05] this is who I am." You see, this is what
[43:07] it brings us. He's brought us into the
[43:10] very pages of the word. And so, we see
[43:12] his word as a love letter to our lives.
[43:15] And so when we want to just take this
[43:18] here just for a moment on remembering
[43:20] the Lord and and brother Vanom he he
[43:23] makes this um uh statement here which I
[43:26] think is so clear when we look at where
[43:29] Paul was dealing with the Corinthian
[43:32] church and no doubt this had been laid
[43:34] out about communion the early church
[43:36] they understood this but yet Paul being
[43:39] a church age messenger he's not just
[43:42] dealing with the truth but now God works
[43:44] works to bring what is the real
[43:46] substance and the heart and the motiv
[43:49] motive and the objective and how
[43:51] everything should be. You know, that's
[43:53] that's how God works in our life. God
[43:56] just doesn't want us uh to go through
[43:59] the motions of anything. But anytime
[44:01] that God moves with and deals with our
[44:04] life, he's wanting our heart. Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; He's wanting our heart because when he
[44:09] can get get a get our heart and get our
[44:11] heart in line, let me just tell you the
[44:13] word, it has a free channel to come to
[44:16] pass
[44:16] &gt;&gt; because our heart, that's the whole
[44:18] thing. And that's why that constantly
[44:20] within our heart, we have to guard our
[44:23] heart and and constantly watching over
[44:25] that. And this is where Paul would write
[44:27] to the to the believing church in that
[44:29] time. And he and and he would deal with
[44:31] them because they were coming and and
[44:33] when it talked about the Lord's supper,
[44:36] those previous scriptures, they were
[44:38] coming there and they were they were
[44:40] eating as though a meal and taking the
[44:43] bread and eating it as though it it it
[44:46] just to be full and and drinking, you
[44:48] know, of the wine. And so they were they
[44:50] were drunk. And you can imagine the um
[44:53] how Satan loves to ridicule things. And
[44:56] you can imagine the posts that would
[44:58] have been on Instagram of the Corinthian
[45:00] church. And oh my, here this church is
[45:03] supposed to be so spiritual. Look at
[45:05] them coming out drunk and staggering and
[45:08] oh, but Satan, he he likes to do that,
[45:11] you know. But you know, God has a way
[45:14] that God comes to straighten things out
[45:17] to bring us right back in line. And you
[45:20] know if if God himself does not stop or
[45:25] unbelief or all of the ridicule doesn't
[45:27] hinder him then I pray God don't let us
[45:30] get focused on that but let us just
[45:32] focus on him.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Let us be focused on what God thinks.
[45:36] And I mean even above your own thoughts
[45:38] of yourself say God let my thoughts be
[45:41] so saturated with your thoughts Lord.
[45:44] And brother Brandham picks this up and
[45:46] he picks it up in the discerning of the
[45:48] body of the Lord. And he says, "Now our
[45:50] eternal destination is not altogether
[45:52] determined by what we see and what we
[45:55] hear, but it's determined on what
[45:58] discernment we have of what we see and
[46:01] what we hear." He said Paul was not
[46:04] disputing with them for taking the
[46:06] communion. Their act was right, but
[46:10] their discernment was wrong. For taking
[46:13] the Lord's supper is the commandment of
[46:15] the Lord, but to take it unworthily, not
[46:17] discerning the body of the Lord, is
[46:20] where the wrong would lay. So, how the
[46:23] prophet and how Paul was bringing it is
[46:25] that they were failing to discern their
[46:29] lives according to the word. So they saw
[46:32] something that was laid out as as an
[46:35] ordinance that is to be followed just
[46:38] like water baptism, just like washing of
[46:40] feet. And they were they were doing that
[46:43] but failing to discern their lives
[46:47] according to the word of God. And so
[46:50] with it's beyond like what we see or
[46:53] what we uh hear. Discernment takes us
[46:56] beyond this realm. And you might say,
[46:58] well, if I'm looking at my own life, but
[47:00] you see it, discernment takes us to
[47:03] where we're allowing the word to examine
[47:06] our own heart, our own life, and just to
[47:09] comb through our lives. And so it's even
[47:11] on the approach that they would come
[47:14] because when we would discern or judge
[47:16] our lives and I don't believe that God
[47:18] wants us just to wait until you know a
[47:21] couple times a year or where it's just
[47:23] communion but I believe that's the real
[47:24] victory of our lives as believers and
[47:27] and and we're living in a day a time
[47:31] where uh we are bombarded like no other
[47:34] time before. We are living in a time
[47:36] where things work to so desensitize us
[47:40] there. You're living in a time where
[47:42] there is uh the pressure is greater now
[47:45] than it's ever been.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; That's not discounting what the other
[47:49] what the early church and those went
[47:51] through. But this is a greater hour. Let
[47:53] me just say it like this. The pressure
[47:56] is different now than what it was in the
[47:59] 70s.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; It's different than what it was in the
[48:03] 80s. It's it's the things have changed.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Seasons have changed. Even seasons in
[48:10] the word. And so within that that
[48:14] discernment, Lord, I need discernment
[48:16] for this moment. I need discernment for
[48:18] this hour because I just don't want to
[48:21] be doing the right thing because I could
[48:23] do the right thing and do it in the
[48:25] wrong way. But I want to be I want to be
[48:27] found correct in your word.
[48:31] And I think there's no greater, you
[48:33] know, thing that we we all can
[48:35] fellowship on this. We all have been in
[48:37] those places and we feel pretty good and
[48:39] we should. God brings us along in our
[48:42] walk with him. But there's nothing like
[48:44] getting in his presence and then the
[48:46] word begins to move and to deal with our
[48:49] life and to discern our hearts. And you
[48:51] know what that is when that's taking
[48:53] place? Brother Bram says you're closer
[48:55] to the burning bush than what you think.
[48:57] He said when God begins to deal with
[49:00] your life and he said the word is coming
[49:02] so personal. He said that's not the
[49:04] throne of judgment way off. He said
[49:06] that's the throne of mercy right here.
[49:08] And it's God's spirit working out and
[49:10] dealing with our life and drawing us
[49:12] into places. And you know, the whole
[49:13] reason that God comes that way is not to
[49:16] shame us, not to make us feel bad, but
[49:19] God wants us to to to to be free and to
[49:23] live with not only uh uh I want to say
[49:26] with a conviction, but to live in real
[49:28] liberty of what he's called us. He does
[49:30] God God absolutely does not like when
[49:33] anything gets into his temple, one of
[49:35] his children, and is there and and and
[49:38] is is causing things to go array. He he
[49:41] he paid the price. We are his. We're
[49:43] bought with a price. We belong to him.
[49:45] He, as a matter of fact, the prophet
[49:47] says he resents anything taking over in
[49:50] his temple.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Now, they weren't discerning the body of
[49:59] the Lord. And the body of the Lord,
[50:02] well, the physical body, the corporal
[50:05] body, that that's that's been raised up
[50:07] to the throne. God was the body that God
[50:11] used to God created that body to come
[50:14] down in order to redeem us. And God took
[50:16] that body up as a memorial and it's
[50:18] there as a testament and seated there on
[50:21] the throne. And to know that within the
[50:24] body of the Lord that we're talking
[50:26] about is the mystical body of Jesus
[50:29] Christ. In other words, it is the
[50:32] spiritfilled
[50:34] children of God. that God where God has
[50:37] brought everyone of his children and
[50:40] what part we are in the body we can't be
[50:43] nobody else's part that's why that we
[50:46] can't live back in the feet back in the
[50:48] thighs even in the chest we can't even
[50:51] live back in the days of Pentecost
[50:54] &gt;&gt; we can't even live now we're not even in
[50:56] the eye age that that the eye time it's
[50:58] eagle time that's true but the last
[51:00] thing that was to enter the body is the
[51:02] intelligence
[51:04] &gt;&gt; so we so we must move within that and
[51:06] the only way the intelligence could come
[51:08] is because God had eyes upon the earth
[51:11] and instead of the eyes being divided he
[51:13] said if thine eye be single thy whole
[51:14] body shall be full of light. So if the
[51:17] whole body is to be full of light then
[51:19] it means that here God has built his
[51:22] body of believers down through the ages
[51:26] &gt;&gt; all the way through it's been the
[51:27] building and the assembling of the body
[51:30] of the Lord.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; That's true. Many would walk right right
[51:34] past and overlook uh the body of the
[51:36] Lord because as far as in our flesh,
[51:39] we're no different from anybody else. We
[51:41] as I mean, we may dress different. We we
[51:43] according to God's word, we take those
[51:45] things off. But as far as uh having uh
[51:47] difficulties and and things that we deal
[51:50] with, we're we're no different than
[51:51] anyone else. We deal with that. We're
[51:53] not exempt from that. But what it is is
[51:55] that we have an access to a place that
[51:58] brings us to uh h
[52:02] an overcoming and an encouraging through
[52:04] those times and to lift us in in our
[52:07] lives to to manifest. We we his glory we
[52:11] we have an access to the grace of God or
[52:14] to the throne of God by the grace of
[52:16] God. And so, you know, when we consider
[52:19] this in our lives that really what Paul
[52:22] as he was bringing the the people to of
[52:26] this in this in this walk or in this
[52:28] moment, you know, we're looking at human
[52:30] v and human vessels. Our vessels, as
[52:32] Paul would describe it, are earthn
[52:34] vessels,
[52:37] &gt;&gt; frail,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; weak. Brother Rem tells us in perfect
[52:42] strength. He said, he says, "If we make
[52:45] it to heaven," he says, which I believe
[52:46] we will, he says, "We're going to stand
[52:50] among some of the weakest people that's
[52:53] ever been."
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's it's our concept of weakness,
[52:57] cuz no one likes to be called weak,
[53:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's that's insulting,
[53:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:03] Um but you see weakness in God's
[53:07] thinking is so much greater
[53:10] &gt;&gt; than what it is in our thinking. In our
[53:12] thinking that's humiliation,
[53:15] &gt;&gt; but yet God allows that humiliation is
[53:18] actually the breaking down of our
[53:21] strength. That's why the prophet said
[53:23] many times we're too strong.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; That's defense. That's a defense
[53:27] mechanism. That's part of how we're and
[53:30] we have to understand that. That's
[53:31] something that when the Holy Spirit has
[53:33] come, he doesn't strip that out of us.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:37] &gt;&gt; But what his coming has brought us to
[53:41] is to the realization
[53:44] is I was always a son of God.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I was always a sheep.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I've always been a one of his.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; That's why there's things that's been
[53:54] different. And then then then we can
[53:56] draw from him our shepherd as he will
[53:59] lead us into green pastures. He knows
[54:02] the nutrients we need and he's already
[54:04] laid the nutrients out in his word.
[54:07] David said he has prepared for me a
[54:12] table
[54:13] &gt;&gt; in the presence of mine enemies.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's right.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; We're coming to the table of the Lord.
[54:20] And as the people of God, we can say he
[54:24] is my Lord.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; He's my Lord. That that's just not
[54:28] something of a of a figure of speech,
[54:30] but he is my Lord. And we've been
[54:32] brought to the table of the Lord. He has
[54:35] prepared. What are you saying, brother
[54:37] Samuel? God has prepared what you and I
[54:40] have need of even for this moment, for
[54:43] this generation. When God sent his word
[54:47] into this generation, God sent a word
[54:50] that the overcomers, those who desire
[54:54] and have a longing not just to be part
[54:56] of status quo, not just to go along. And
[54:59] even when you feel like I I feel like
[55:01] giving up, I I can't do this or I can't
[55:04] go on another step. And then God steps
[55:06] in in that moment and brings us to a
[55:09] place and says, "Look, all I need for
[55:11] you to do is surrender your weakness.
[55:15] He doesn't he doesn't strongarm us
[55:19] &gt;&gt; because that only cause the strength to
[55:21] build up.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; He knows how to disarm us in his
[55:25] presence.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; So that then what? Weakness can be
[55:29] surrendered. And when weakness is truly
[55:31] surrendered where we say, "Lord, I can't
[55:34] I can't do this. Lord, I'm not able. I
[55:37] Lord, I I need your strength." And that
[55:39] goes on in our life. God brings us to
[55:41] those times and then that's where he
[55:43] pours himself in
[55:46] &gt;&gt; and he'll use himself.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, why doesn't he do it all
[55:52] at once? Because character is not a
[55:54] gift.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; It's a victory.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; And he's interested in molding us, not
[56:00] overwhelming us. He's interesting in
[56:03] building us up.
[56:05] And this is why Paul would write
[56:08] or brother Brandon would pick this up
[56:10] and he says these Christians were taking
[56:11] communion and not living the life. And
[56:14] Christianity is an experience and a
[56:16] life. And he said these Christians was
[56:18] just living any kind of life and making
[56:20] a poor profession. And that's why Paul
[56:23] said many are are sick and weakly among
[56:25] you and many are sleep. You know,
[56:26] brother Brandham actually picks that
[56:28] scripture up and he actually says, "This
[56:30] is why sometimes God will take people
[56:32] home even prematurely
[56:35] because sometimes they've allowed things
[56:36] to go on and not deal with it."
[56:40] &gt;&gt; That just I I never ran across that
[56:42] until here this morning. That's not to
[56:44] bring fear in our lives. I mean, Brother
[56:46] Brandham showed us Brother Bram showed
[56:48] us that in the Hebrew series when he
[56:50] dealt with Saul,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham brings that brother up.
[56:55] you're familiar with. He mentions it a
[56:57] few different times. Brother Ramsay,
[56:59] Brother Ramsey got so discouraged,
[57:00] Brother Brandon went in his garage where
[57:03] he worked as an automotive,
[57:05] Brother Ramsey. And he began to talk to
[57:07] him. He said, "I don't serve the Lord no
[57:08] more, Billy."
[57:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; He'd become discouraged,
[57:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:15] You see, Satan, listen, this is where we
[57:20] we have to say, "God, give me the
[57:24] strength to turn my eyes to you."
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz I tell you, when you look at when
[57:28] you look at flesh all the way across,
[57:30] when you look at flesh, listen, friends,
[57:32] our flesh disappoints one another.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; I don't even have to leave my home that
[57:37] there's no doubt that I've disappointed
[57:39] my wife. My wife's disappointed me.
[57:40] Likewise with the children. And then
[57:42] even here among the body of of
[57:44] believers, it's different when you know
[57:46] if you go from here and you go visit a
[57:48] church, you're not you're not when you
[57:49] visit, you don't see the weaknesses.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; But when you get within a family and you
[57:57] get among you see that and God you say
[57:59] why does God permit that? God permits
[58:02] that to work out and to bring us to a
[58:04] place to say wait a minute. He's not
[58:06] saying that that a person isn't wrong.
[58:09] That's not it at all. God will allow us
[58:11] to see wrong and even to be wronged.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Why would he allow that? Is because God
[58:19] is interested in bringing out that
[58:21] attribute in our life of even not only
[58:23] of that of forgiveness of where well I'm
[58:25] just to display forgiveness. No, it's
[58:27] even deeper than that. That God is
[58:29] working in our lives to bring us to that
[58:32] character and to that image for full
[58:34] adoption for the capstone to set down
[58:36] upon our life.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the capstone setting down
[58:41] upon our life, that's what we're being
[58:42] drawn. You see, there's a power that's
[58:44] drawing us up.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That's why this message it it listen,
[58:49] there's realms below. The prophet said
[58:51] three realms below that are constantly
[58:52] trying to pull you down.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; We live here in the middle. Then there's
[58:56] three realms pulling you up, right? You
[58:58] have representation that's pulling you
[59:00] up. So this message that God has sent is
[59:03] not a message to pull you down. Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; It's a message to lift you up. It's a
[59:09] message to cause you to look up. It's a
[59:11] message of the revealing of Christ on
[59:13] character, Christ on life, Christ on
[59:15] nature. That's why the real opening of
[59:17] the book, the taking of the book. You
[59:20] want to know what it is? It's not It's
[59:21] not a symbol. It's Christ taking your
[59:24] life.
[59:25] [Applause]
[59:27] &gt;&gt; It's God taking a bride body.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; It's not words. It's not letters. It's
[59:33] not chapters. It's lives.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And where so many things tried to ride
[59:40] through your life and innocency and and
[59:42] then war came in and then death came in
[59:45] and then in a ride even of trying to be
[59:48] undercover and all of those things. But
[59:50] God in himself coming down in our life,
[59:54] he exposes the trail of the serpent.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; He exposes, you know what he does? He's
[1:00:00] interested in taking the cover off of
[1:00:02] Satan. Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; And you know what it does? It locks you
[1:00:06] and I in to him who is our absolute
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; because he knows my children if they
[1:00:13] recognize this characteristic and he'll
[1:00:16] just take the cover off you'll see it
[1:00:17] for what it is.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing in our lives.
[1:00:21] That's what he's doing in our lives.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; He's got confidence that his children
[1:00:25] will always side with the word because
[1:00:26] we're a part of the word. That's right.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; And so this is why that brother, you
[1:00:35] know, he says we who call ourselves
[1:00:37] Christians have no right to take the
[1:00:39] communion unless we are living above a
[1:00:42] reproach of the world. We have no right.
[1:00:44] The communion are for those who are
[1:00:46] living right as an example of
[1:00:47] Christianity. So remember Paul was
[1:00:50] dealing with them because their act of
[1:00:54] taking communion was right.
[1:00:58] But their discernment was wrong.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; The Catholic Church,
[1:01:05] they come and they call their
[1:01:08] sacraments.
[1:01:09] They come and they're taking with the
[1:01:13] hope they will be forgiven.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; That's not that's not what this is.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; We're not taking this with a hope. We
[1:01:24] come remembering what he has done.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And and I'm not talking just back on
[1:01:32] Calvary, but we remember what he's done
[1:01:35] in us.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; We remember the lives that we once
[1:01:40] lived.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And we no longer live them. We no longer
[1:01:43] desire them.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I feel pulled
[1:01:48] sometimes with certain desires. But here
[1:01:50] the discernment of the word says there's
[1:01:52] pulls and things within your flesh. But
[1:01:54] to show what's on the what's on the very
[1:01:56] throne of your heart is when you have
[1:01:58] fallen short quickly. It's oh God
[1:02:01] forgive me.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; What is that? It's the same spirit of
[1:02:06] God that brought him down in the garden.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you he's not coming
[1:02:14] down to your life. He's already dwelling
[1:02:16] there by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:02:20] Hallelujah.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. It brings discernment in our
[1:02:25] lives.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just something going
[1:02:32] through the motions. And so I want to
[1:02:33] just say this to you. You are a
[1:02:36] testimony
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; as you're coming even through here.
[1:02:40] You're a testimony. You see, God would
[1:02:44] have different things to be done with
[1:02:47] Israel. Remember when they left the land
[1:02:49] of Egypt, he told them, "Keep the
[1:02:50] Passover. Let it be a memorial." When
[1:02:52] they crossed the the Jordan, he had them
[1:02:55] bring stones from that was in the Jordan
[1:02:58] and bring those stones and put them on
[1:03:01] land. Let me just tell you something.
[1:03:03] You and I were buried beneath death.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Our lives were hidden,
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; but God opened up the way and brought us
[1:03:14] out.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And our lives are
[1:03:17] testimonies.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Where were those stones set up at Gila?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Not only have we died to self, but we've
[1:03:25] been circumcised from the things of the
[1:03:27] world. I don't want anything to do with
[1:03:29] the world. The tie, the yoke back to
[1:03:31] Egypt has been broken.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not become a better person. I'm a
[1:03:36] new man.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation by his working. Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, I have testimonies, but I am a
[1:03:44] testimony.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; I am a witness. You are a witness.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And you when you come, you're
[1:03:51] remembering what he has done for you.
[1:03:54] The prophet says, you know, he says, you
[1:03:56] don't want to make it just something
[1:03:58] common. He says, but remember that it
[1:04:00] was his grace and his mercy and that
[1:04:03] alone that gives you the only hope you
[1:04:06] have. No matter what you could ever do,
[1:04:08] there's nothing nowhere that can anyways
[1:04:10] come near what Christ did for you.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're a testimony. This is
[1:04:16] why Paul, think about this, standing in
[1:04:18] this wicked city of Corenth.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; And here they were. This this must have
[1:04:25] had to have been a word that was dropped
[1:04:28] within this moment.
[1:04:30] Know you not that the unrighteous shall
[1:04:32] not inherit the kingdom of God. Be not
[1:04:34] deceived. Neither fornicators,
[1:04:36] idolattors, adulterers, effeminate,
[1:04:38] abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
[1:04:40] thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers,
[1:04:43] extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom
[1:04:46] of God. And such were some of you.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Then we we were there.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Paul's letting them know that look where
[1:04:56] God brought you from. Yes. Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And no doubt I wonder if some of them
[1:05:01] were setting in their mind and how the
[1:05:02] enemy can try to trouble in their mind
[1:05:05] and you know it was when God first got a
[1:05:07] hold of your life. Could could it really
[1:05:09] or is this something that from my past
[1:05:11] or or is could God really do it? And yet
[1:05:14] you know the reality is burning in your
[1:05:16] life and you look at it sometimes in
[1:05:18] your mind comes back to the vileeness of
[1:05:21] once you where you once lived but where
[1:05:23] you once lived
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; was not who you were.
[1:05:29] Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that?" It's
[1:05:31] different now.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; It's different now.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; You're not just living a different life.
[1:05:37] You have no taste for those things.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Those are the things that could get you
[1:05:41] off your pillow at night. Say, "Oh, God,
[1:05:44] if it hadn't been for your grace,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; where would my life have been, Lord? I
[1:05:49] may not even have been here. I wouldn't
[1:05:51] have known you. Oh, God.
[1:05:58] But you're washed,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; sanctified, justified in the name of the
[1:06:03] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; There's no remembrance of as far as
[1:06:11] desires that have lingered there. And
[1:06:13] that's so God has freed our lives from
[1:06:15] those things. And that's why the prophet
[1:06:17] said, "As long as you're trusting in
[1:06:20] what you do, you're not remembering what
[1:06:23] what he's done for you." Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] Let me let me just read as he places
[1:06:29] this here.
[1:06:31] He says, "If I can forget what I was and
[1:06:34] remember what he is, if I can remember
[1:06:37] Jesus, if I can remember him at the
[1:06:39] cross, if I can remember what he done
[1:06:41] for me, I can remember the hour that he
[1:06:44] washed away my sins. Give me the Holy
[1:06:47] Spirit to guide me. Then I'm lifted
[1:06:49] above everything that holds this earth.
[1:06:52] I'm lifted above every earthly thing
[1:06:54] into heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:06:56] where I can fellowship with him there in
[1:06:59] his presence forgetting what I ever was.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Forgetting all my sins and everything
[1:07:06] because they're in the sea of
[1:07:08] forgetfulness.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; That's just something so special about
[1:07:12] the presence of the Lord.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; It is. Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Forgetting all my past, forgetting
[1:07:18] everything. And remember that he made me
[1:07:20] his own
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; by his own death. He took my place and
[1:07:25] that had not a right to go nowhere but
[1:07:27] hell. He took my place and lifted me
[1:07:29] from hell. He went there for me and he
[1:07:32] lifted me up by his grace abundance
[1:07:35] until now. We are sons and daughters of
[1:07:38] God and we sit in heavenly places in
[1:07:40] Christ Jesus ever rejoicing and
[1:07:43] remembering him who brought us safe this
[1:07:46] far and with pulsating faith in our
[1:07:48] souls pressing us.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; And by his grace will take me on.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; It's not you pressing.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; It's what's behind you.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; That's what's important. It's who's
[1:08:04] behind you. Yeah.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, heaven is behind you.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; God is behind you. You know why? You're
[1:08:12] a part of him. You're a part of his
[1:08:14] word. And he is the amen of his word.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; It's life in you. Oh, you may get down,
[1:08:22] but you can't keep resurrection power
[1:08:25] locked up.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; There's not a Roman seal big enough.
[1:08:30] There's not a situation too great.
[1:08:32] There's not an anxiety. There's not a
[1:08:34] depression. There's not no matter of
[1:08:37] failure that can keep a child of God
[1:08:40] back from their promises.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; He is the quickener.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; He is the resurrection power. Oh, glory
[1:08:49] be to Jesus Christ.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We are the body of the Lord.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. This is why that even
[1:09:02] in the scriptures when we think of this
[1:09:05] being the body of the Lord and Paul
[1:09:08] would you know refer to this of how this
[1:09:10] cup of blessing that we bless is it not
[1:09:13] the communion of the blood of Christ the
[1:09:15] bread which we break is it not the
[1:09:17] communion of the body of Christ for we
[1:09:20] being many are one bread and one body
[1:09:23] for we are all partakers of that one
[1:09:25] bread his life has come that was divided
[1:09:31] his his his he became sin who knew no
[1:09:35] sin. He the bread. Remember, he told
[1:09:38] them, "I am that bread that came down.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; I'm the true bread." True bread. You're
[1:09:44] a man. But they miss seeing one day what
[1:09:46] it was spoke of. The bread is life.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I'm the lifegiver.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I'm your sustainer.
[1:09:54] What I was back there in Egypt was only
[1:09:56] a type of of where it spoke of my coming
[1:09:59] that I would become the sustainer in
[1:10:02] your life.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; But though sometimes feelings can fail
[1:10:07] us, but he never does.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we feel the anointing so great
[1:10:12] and at other times we don't, but he is
[1:10:14] still right there.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you nor
[1:10:17] forsake you." Even when we have failed
[1:10:20] him, he doesn't fly off into eternity.
[1:10:22] The prophet said that that dove just
[1:10:25] goes up on just a little limb
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; waiting on us to become a lamb again to
[1:10:30] welcome him back.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is he is Lord. I'm going
[1:10:41] to say he is Lord. And this is why that
[1:10:43] when we can see the scripture Paul said
[1:10:46] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord
[1:10:49] but by the Holy Ghost. You are a
[1:10:52] testimony of what God has brought you
[1:10:55] from from all of your family tree, from
[1:10:57] all the strains. And there ain't no
[1:10:59] family tree no better than the other.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of home you came
[1:11:03] out of. It ain't good. We're not here to
[1:11:05] glorify family trees cuz you search very
[1:11:08] long, you're going to find every family
[1:11:10] tree was in a mess and we all needed
[1:11:13] God.
[1:11:16] Sometimes maybe those who might you look
[1:11:18] at and say, "My this was messed up and
[1:11:20] this is messed up." But I'll tell you
[1:11:22] what, God knows there's those that are
[1:11:24] looking and are longing and there's a
[1:11:26] desire for deliverance.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; But we all stood in need of redemption.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; So you know when you look at it in your
[1:11:37] life, he now has become exalted in your
[1:11:42] spirit. That's right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; He's been exalted above everything of
[1:11:46] the past. He's been exalted above every
[1:11:49] desire. I want you to understand you.
[1:11:51] This exalting doesn't stop.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he had put all
[1:11:57] things under his feet.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; It didn't say it will be. He has
[1:12:01] already.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Right. When Paul is asserting there the
[1:12:06] deity of Jesus Christ through the book
[1:12:08] of Hebrews, he firmly declares in the
[1:12:11] opening chapter who it was in the
[1:12:13] prophet who has spoke upholding all
[1:12:15] things by the word of his power that
[1:12:16] when he brought his only begotten into
[1:12:18] the world, he addressed the angels, thou
[1:12:21] shalt worship him. And Paul moves on
[1:12:23] into that chapter and speaks and says,
[1:12:26] we see not all things yet,
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; but we see Jesus.
[1:12:34] You may not see everything that you're
[1:12:36] praying about now, but you see Jesus.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, he's the one that's
[1:12:41] going to bring it to pass.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He's upholding all word, his word.
[1:12:47] Upholding it by the word of his power.
[1:12:49] Upholding means snatching away. He's
[1:12:52] He's the one that is coming and he's
[1:12:54] catching us away. It's a word that is
[1:12:56] catching you and I away. And you know
[1:12:58] what he's doing? He's given you and I a
[1:13:00] vision to be able to see the end that
[1:13:02] it's finished.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; But sometimes through this part of the
[1:13:06] journey,
[1:13:08] we can get discouraged.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; We can get weary.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; We can experience
[1:13:16] misjudgment,
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; being misunderstood.
[1:13:20] And God knew that all along through this
[1:13:24] journey of coming back into what he had
[1:13:26] in the back part of his mind. and what
[1:13:28] God is calling you and I back to, he
[1:13:30] knew that throughout this time, just as
[1:13:33] much as we would need healing in our
[1:13:36] body,
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; and he does that to encourage us,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's that's the evidence
[1:13:42] of the resurrection
[1:13:45] just as much as his presence comes by
[1:13:48] and it'll encourage us when you feel
[1:13:50] like you're at your last point.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I can't go another step.
[1:13:57] and the enemy's on your shoulder and
[1:13:59] say, "Yeah, why? You really don't have a
[1:14:02] lot of oomph right now anyhow.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just wait and throw in the
[1:14:06] towel? I mean, look, look at all the
[1:14:07] trouble. Look at everything." And you
[1:14:09] look And you know what? Let me just tell
[1:14:11] you something.
[1:14:13] He's not lying.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; He's not lying. All right.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; When they came and they poked at
[1:14:23] Nehemiah and they said, "Huh, these
[1:14:26] walls, it's nothing but a pile of
[1:14:29] rubbish."
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; They weren't lying.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; But it's how you're looking at it.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; This is why we need divine help.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; God knows and knew we would get
[1:14:41] discouraged. And this is why we need
[1:14:43] divine assistance.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And God knows just how to encourage you
[1:14:47] and I. And he encourages you and I
[1:14:49] through the renewing of our vision. And
[1:14:51] even as we come into his presence and
[1:14:54] here we are setting and maybe it just
[1:14:56] seems like in the devil feels like he's
[1:14:58] got every channel blocked off. Man, I've
[1:15:00] got them. I I've got everything blocked
[1:15:02] off and you know I've got them feeling
[1:15:04] condemned because they're feeling this
[1:15:06] way and yet they feel justified for
[1:15:08] feeling this way. And Satan just feels
[1:15:10] like he's got everything within a web
[1:15:12] and tied up and he's moving in for the
[1:15:15] kill. But what he underestimates
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; is the Lord Jesus,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; he said, "I've got a rote in the palm of
[1:15:26] my hand.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; You're not in his mouth
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; cuz he spews that others out, but you're
[1:15:33] written in his hands."
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're in the right hand and
[1:15:39] oh, the right hand, we feel his power.
[1:15:41] We feel the invigorating of his
[1:15:43] presence. And then there's other times
[1:15:45] here it's a left hand where God is
[1:15:47] working and we don't know what's
[1:15:48] happening. We don't know what's taking
[1:15:49] place and we're looking to God. Lord,
[1:15:51] Lord, do you still love me? Lord, am I
[1:15:53] am I called? And Lord, am I one of
[1:15:54] yours? And all of that. You say, why
[1:15:57] would that be? It's God breaking down
[1:15:59] our will.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; It's God peeling back the covers. It's
[1:16:05] God just taking You You want You want to
[1:16:06] talk about an example of one who's just
[1:16:09] letting things just deflect off of him?
[1:16:12] That's almighty God. You remember Bill
[1:16:14] Ram tells us in the message he said if
[1:16:16] they in Israel after the blood had been
[1:16:18] applied he said if one of them would
[1:16:20] have looked at that and said do you
[1:16:22] think do you think that that's going to
[1:16:25] work he said that would have been an
[1:16:26] insult
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; to Jehovah and he said anytime when God
[1:16:30] has given us a word he said and then we
[1:16:32] question it it's an insult
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; to Jehovah
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; you think the enemy wouldn't have come
[1:16:39] oh well you've brought insults and you
[1:16:41] think God you think that keeps him at
[1:16:43] distance. God knows we are but flesh.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; I'm
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; trying to get to my point here this
[1:16:49] morning. He knows we are but flesh.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; He's he brings us along and he
[1:16:54] understands that. I want you to think
[1:16:56] about it. If somebody gave you and I
[1:16:57] that kind of an insult,
[1:17:00] huh? What you saying? Call somebody
[1:17:02] else.
[1:17:06] Do you really think that this countertop
[1:17:08] do you really think? Do you really
[1:17:08] think? Do you really think anything? But
[1:17:10] not God. See, God did God does not
[1:17:13] argue. God doesn't argue. Oh, God, help
[1:17:16] us.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; He stands there and he just peels back.
[1:17:22] He peels back one layer. He's peeling
[1:17:25] back another layer. And you know what it
[1:17:26] all is? He's uncovering you.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He's uncovering me. Because those things
[1:17:31] that are covering over is actually
[1:17:33] what's causing the wrong expression out
[1:17:36] of our life. It's kind of like a a a
[1:17:40] corn that has a rock over it. It'll try
[1:17:42] to grow around that corn,
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; but you got to move that rock. And see,
[1:17:46] you can't defeat the seed from coming
[1:17:47] forth. But what Satan wants to try to do
[1:17:50] is put those rocks and put covers and
[1:17:52] and then you're growing way out here.
[1:17:53] But God God in his mercy, he is mindful
[1:17:56] to remove what's hindering.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; That's why we need patience.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Patience with one another
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; part of the body.
[1:18:07] patience and oh God help me. Because you
[1:18:10] see what it is, we've been there.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; See, God brings us through things to
[1:18:14] also reflect in our own lives. We we are
[1:18:16] his victory. It's Christ. It's his word
[1:18:19] that's triumphant. Is always causing us
[1:18:21] to triumph. Let me just drop this here.
[1:18:24] I got a few more moments.
[1:18:27] The Bible says that here he is that a
[1:18:31] king shall reign in righteousness and
[1:18:33] princes shall rule in judgment. And a
[1:18:36] man shall be as an hiding place from the
[1:18:42] wind. It wouldn't be that the wind would
[1:18:44] stop, but there's a place where we can
[1:18:46] get out of it.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; A covert
[1:18:51] from the tempest, the howling and the
[1:18:53] swirling and the and the and all of that
[1:18:55] of the greatness of storms. There's
[1:18:57] there's a place he shall be as a covert
[1:19:00] as, look at this, rivers
[1:19:03] of water.
[1:19:05] one source but many streams,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; many rivers.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; This is why it's a many membered body.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have just one one one
[1:19:16] assembly, but they're outposts
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; all around the world. But you know what?
[1:19:22] It's not it's not uh many different
[1:19:24] water sources, but it's waters of one
[1:19:27] river.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a voice of many waters.
[1:19:32] It's Christ that is working as rivers of
[1:19:35] water in a dry place.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; You ever been in a dry place?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I have.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Been in a dry time?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sure.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; The prophet, matter of fact, he says God
[1:19:46] will allow a dry season to come to test
[1:19:49] what our reaction is going to be.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And listen,
[1:19:54] we can't we can't throw off on Abraham.
[1:19:56] We all been guilty. We We're trying to
[1:19:59] because you know what it is? We're
[1:20:01] trying to sometimes recreate
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; past experiences
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; and because we feel safe in past
[1:20:09] experiences
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and we feel like, oh, if I can just get
[1:20:13] back to that past experience. And really
[1:20:15] what God is saying is that was only a
[1:20:18] stopping point.
[1:20:21] It was just a station while on your
[1:20:23] journey.
[1:20:25] See, that's why the prophet tells us
[1:20:27] when he takes us through the revealing
[1:20:30] of Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and he
[1:20:32] says, "The church of the living God is
[1:20:34] not called to a station in this hour."
[1:20:38] But we go back to stations where we felt
[1:20:41] comfort. Oh, how I felt the power of
[1:20:43] God. How I And that was a station. God
[1:20:46] is no less now, but it's how God is
[1:20:49] working now. where we need discernment
[1:20:52] in order to dispel discouragement.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because if we're
[1:20:57] looking for and expecting the wrong
[1:20:59] thing, then it only adds to our
[1:21:01] discouragement because ah this is ah
[1:21:04] this isn't going listen.
[1:21:07] Don't feel lonely. John himself got his
[1:21:10] eye filmed over.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, here he come and
[1:21:14] says go ask him if he's the one or do we
[1:21:18] look for another. He had such a
[1:21:20] supernatural experience. He's the one
[1:21:23] who saw the light, heard the voice, but
[1:21:26] even in the midst when things weren't
[1:21:28] happening the way he thought they ought
[1:21:30] to be happening.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; How many times in our lives
[1:21:35] where things aren't happening the way
[1:21:37] that we thought? Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; I just told my wife just yesterday we
[1:21:41] were fellowshipping was out driving a
[1:21:43] little bit just getting out and I said
[1:21:45] I've watched things God do things that I
[1:21:48] said it's brought me to a place now
[1:21:50] where I'm expecting God but I'm not
[1:21:53] looking for it to be done in a certain
[1:21:55] way. I said because God through
[1:21:57] everything through family through the
[1:21:59] church through every So what I've
[1:22:01] witnessed is it's just been God and only
[1:22:03] thing I can step back and say is he's
[1:22:06] sovereign.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:08] I said is that even in my ignorance, God
[1:22:11] had us to be in the right position to be
[1:22:14] able to see him. Brother Sam, you take
[1:22:16] any credit for that? None. None. Because
[1:22:20] even in our surrender, we're not even
[1:22:22] that big.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; We need his grace.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; We need his presence
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; because it's in his presence where he
[1:22:31] dismisses fear. It's in his presence
[1:22:34] where he removes the intimidation of
[1:22:36] vulnerability. in his presence. And he
[1:22:38] might work service after service after
[1:22:40] service, but he's got an objective in
[1:22:42] his mind. He's not the author of
[1:22:44] frustration. He's got an objective in
[1:22:46] his mind. And he knows what he's working
[1:22:49] at in our life and in the lives of
[1:22:51] others,
[1:22:54] but it's us.
[1:22:57] And see how Satan will work on that with
[1:22:58] us. Because listen, let me just tell you
[1:23:00] something.
[1:23:01] You and I are built
[1:23:04] to be productive.
[1:23:06] Do you see how Satan has come in even in
[1:23:08] this hour and he's taken things? There's
[1:23:11] never been a higher time of depression,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; anxiety
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; than any other time. But I also want you
[1:23:17] to understand is you have to also look
[1:23:20] at all of the things that are around us
[1:23:22] and you're being exposed to and
[1:23:24] bombarded with.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; And it's things that you look at and you
[1:23:29] see, you know, you know, you see young
[1:23:31] people. I I'm not Let me just tell you
[1:23:32] something right now. You'll never find
[1:23:34] from here me looking down on anybody. No
[1:23:37] matter what your situation is, I want to
[1:23:39] see everybody helped.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something, friends.
[1:23:42] There's certain ways and certain things
[1:23:44] that I can pray about even with people
[1:23:46] in prayer lines because I've been
[1:23:47] through some of those places. I may not
[1:23:50] have been into the the depth that others
[1:23:52] have been through and things like that
[1:23:53] and experiencing anxiousness in that
[1:23:55] degree, but I've experienced it enough
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; to where when I can stand in panic and
[1:24:00] things like that where I can stand in
[1:24:02] and my heart breathes for that just like
[1:24:04] God's done things in your life where you
[1:24:06] can pray for somebody like I could never
[1:24:08] enter in.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; But you've been bombarded.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Things are all around us. Right?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, you you see things, you see, oh,
[1:24:19] this one and and I understand there I
[1:24:21] understand there there's fake stuff. Oh,
[1:24:22] they're going here on vacation and this
[1:24:24] one's getting married and this and that.
[1:24:25] And you you think our young people don't
[1:24:27] feel that pressure and then and then
[1:24:29] it's and then we find the the part that
[1:24:32] oh, I'm just going to take a little
[1:24:33] break from coming in from work and I
[1:24:36] watch this little video on fishing or I
[1:24:38] watch this little and before you know it
[1:24:40] and then you find even like with young
[1:24:42] people because young people don't have
[1:24:43] that they're not in that place of
[1:24:45] discernment yet and then things just
[1:24:47] start rolling and you know what ends up
[1:24:48] happening? Let me tell you what all
[1:24:49] behind that because I'm not I'm not
[1:24:51] getting into the specifics of watching
[1:24:52] this or watching that. What I'm getting
[1:24:53] down to is is that everything that Satan
[1:24:55] is wanting to do is devalue.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When you when I show
[1:25:02] I I didn't I think I showed you pictures
[1:25:04] of when I walked right next to where it
[1:25:06] used to say eagle in white lettering.
[1:25:10] That eagle writing in white lettering in
[1:25:13] quartz is no longer there.
[1:25:16] that hasn't been there for a long time.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because people chipped it
[1:25:21] out of there.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Right now, what what I'm trying to say
[1:25:30] is when you consider that right there,
[1:25:33] even how that that would be done in that
[1:25:35] way, how that Satan wants to deface the
[1:25:39] gospel.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; He wants to deface and take away from
[1:25:44] the realities. He wants to devalue. So,
[1:25:47] let me just tell you something. When you
[1:25:48] see different ones that might be
[1:25:49] battling and listen, let me just tell
[1:25:51] you something. Through this
[1:25:51] congregation, you can't go by what you
[1:25:54] see out here.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Just because a person is smiling here
[1:25:58] doesn't mean there's not trouble down
[1:26:00] here.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And they're not a Pharisee. They're not
[1:26:04] an actor. But let me just tell you
[1:26:05] something. As Paul Rder said, he said,
[1:26:07] "Ministries are good actors."
[1:26:11] So I'll just you could just put it on me
[1:26:13] that sometimes if you really seen the
[1:26:15] ball of nerves and where we were at and
[1:26:17] and different things and seeing what you
[1:26:19] know as I'm looking at it and my I don't
[1:26:21] see too much but you know just what what
[1:26:24] I feel like and I've been praying and
[1:26:25] looking to God and my only see you know
[1:26:27] here I just I know just scripture I know
[1:26:29] this part and then there's other times
[1:26:31] man where the whole outline together and
[1:26:32] what you don't you don't see the ball of
[1:26:34] nerves but you know what God does those
[1:26:36] things to bring us to trust him. Sure.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; And then the enemy wants to tell you,
[1:26:43] "Brother Samuel's got it all together.
[1:26:46] He's cool and cool as a cucumber.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; My wish I could be like that." No. No.
[1:26:51] You don't want to be like me. You want
[1:26:53] to be like Jesus.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, turn your eyes on
[1:26:57] him.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Because the only thing that I'm trusting
[1:26:59] in is him.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting in him. I That's what I'm
[1:27:03] looking to. You say, "How can we be
[1:27:05] positive?" Because even in the times
[1:27:07] when negativity is all around and
[1:27:09] discouragement, it's because he is
[1:27:12] positive.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Can I have just a moment?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; I want to say he's our oasis.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet called our daily life as we
[1:27:31] go through, he said sometimes the
[1:27:32] deserts of life.
[1:27:36] the hot, the heat of trial, and the
[1:27:38] prophet says it's on those backside of
[1:27:39] the deserts where righteous men are
[1:27:43] molded.
[1:27:45] But yet
[1:27:46] those deserts can be hot
[1:27:49] and dry,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Man, you know, sometimes there's things
[1:27:54] that in the midst of deserts and so
[1:27:56] forth, sometimes you can start seeing
[1:27:59] things and what you're seeing is not is
[1:28:02] not real.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Why? It's the conditions. It's not the
[1:28:07] person. It's conditions. And they start
[1:28:09] seeing miragages,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Start imagining things.
[1:28:14] It's a time for all of that to flourish.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I don't think Brother Dave really likes
[1:28:21] me.
[1:28:24] I don't think Sister Roseanne really
[1:28:26] likes me. I don't think Sister I don't
[1:28:28] think Sister Reed I don't think she
[1:28:29] really calls me. I don't even think she
[1:28:31] cuz she started calling me brother Sam
[1:28:33] and I'm not Sammy no more.
[1:28:36] You you you you you understand. Come on
[1:28:38] friends. I can come right down here on
[1:28:40] the carpet. I I'm preach I'm preaching
[1:28:41] right with you this morning. I'm
[1:28:43] preaching right with you. Sister Rita.
[1:28:45] Don't take that to heart.
[1:28:47] Sister Rosanne don't take it to heart.
[1:28:48] No. Don't it's an example. Okay. Don't
[1:28:51] imagine anything.
[1:28:53] But when it's dry it's easy. That's
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; right. It's like even sometimes when we
[1:28:58] get hangry,
[1:29:00] don't look at nobody. Don't Don't
[1:29:03] There's people in here I won't even look
[1:29:04] at right now. Don't look at nobody. And
[1:29:07] you get to that place, you realize,
[1:29:09] wait, it ain't even that person. It's
[1:29:10] the conditions in their body. Their
[1:29:13] blood sugars dropping a certain way. And
[1:29:15] you might say, "Well, brother Samuel,
[1:29:16] the Holy Ghost." Yes, the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost also is not going to
[1:29:22] be the regulator of our blood sugar.
[1:29:24] That's right.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not going to make us a
[1:29:26] peanut butter sandwich.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not going to give us a
[1:29:30] bag of Jolly Ranchers.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; That's
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; right. We have to do those things.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; We have to understand our own
[1:29:39] weaknesses.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's not being uh
[1:29:44] weak. It's being strong in the Lord.
[1:29:47] It's governing this temple
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; and realizing I'm in a desert place. I'm
[1:29:53] in a dry land. I need nourishment.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; The prophet called this. He says it's
[1:30:05] like he says we're coming to take the
[1:30:08] communion. He says this is like it is
[1:30:11] this is what this is. We're representing
[1:30:13] as we come here of what he is to us.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He said every time we come together
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; as a body he's our oasis. Now, let me
[1:30:22] just tell you something. If you don't
[1:30:24] need refreshment, he's not going to be
[1:30:27] that.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; But we need refreshing.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, let me just let me just
[1:30:35] drop my heart to you. Even in times that
[1:30:37] I thought, man, I felt good. I felt
[1:30:39] this. But then God would bring a word
[1:30:41] right down and that word come through my
[1:30:43] life. Oh, deal with my heart.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; It was a time of refreshing.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; You know what it did? What the
[1:30:51] refreshing did is it reccalibrated my
[1:30:54] vision.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It it dealt with taking Samuel's
[1:30:58] thoughts, which I thought, hey, this is
[1:31:01] lined up, man, where this is going. And
[1:31:03] God comes right down and he won't just
[1:31:06] say just tell us. But he tells us
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; and you realize, oh, oh, forgive me,
[1:31:14] Lord.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And even to us that that's a
[1:31:18] refreshing of where he brings us to it's
[1:31:21] an oasis. And there's there's three
[1:31:23] things that the prophet talks about this
[1:31:25] oasis within these messages. And I'm
[1:31:28] just going to display those and then let
[1:31:29] me just let me just bring them up and
[1:31:31] we'll we'll close.
[1:31:34] It's for the wounded.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Wounds,
[1:31:42] sure, we experience things externally.
[1:31:46] We experience things out there,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; but there's no wounds like the wounds
[1:31:52] that come in the house of your friends.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And God, let me just tell you something.
[1:32:05] God God is mindful to deal with those
[1:32:09] wounds.
[1:32:11] He doesn't he doesn't diminish the other
[1:32:14] person, but what he does is it's because
[1:32:16] that that's not going to help. It'd be
[1:32:18] like it, you know, it'd be like your
[1:32:19] child showing up and they're talking
[1:32:20] about what's going on with work and then
[1:32:22] all of a sudden you just jump right in
[1:32:24] with them.
[1:32:27] That doesn't help because they don't
[1:32:29] even have direction on how do I deal
[1:32:32] with adversity?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; See, they it's a teachable moment.
[1:32:38] And so to even to walk through there
[1:32:39] because number one, we weren't even
[1:32:41] there. We we don't understand. Maybe
[1:32:43] there's something the way that they
[1:32:44] done. They don't even see what they've
[1:32:45] done. And you have to you're working
[1:32:47] with them. And that's that's how God God
[1:32:49] deals with our life. God just doesn't
[1:32:51] remember, he's not a doty grandfather.
[1:32:53] God just doesn't jump in. And a matter
[1:32:54] of fact, many times we find the things
[1:32:56] that we feel that we're right. You just
[1:32:59] stay in his presence a little while.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; There you go. And God allows you to
[1:33:03] reflect and you begin to realize, "Oh, I
[1:33:06] see how that person could have took that
[1:33:08] that way.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; God, forgive me.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive me. I didn't I didn't see
[1:33:14] our intentions can be ever so good."
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Can be ever so good.
[1:33:22] But sometimes our intentions,
[1:33:24] those things can be so misunderstood
[1:33:27] because we're not allowing it to be
[1:33:29] fully guided. You say, "Brother Samuel,
[1:33:32] you mean God would allow mistakes and
[1:33:35] things?" I don't like making mistakes no
[1:33:37] more than you do.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm just telling you, it's not about
[1:33:39] a pride thing. I I don't want You don't
[1:33:42] like failing. You don't like failing
[1:33:44] people.
[1:33:47] It's like when there would things come
[1:33:48] up on a test and here I would be and I'd
[1:33:50] be walking around where they're taking
[1:33:51] the test in April, the big standardized
[1:33:54] test and I'd look, oh,
[1:33:56] and over the years you get to that spot.
[1:33:58] You're a how did I let how did I how did
[1:34:00] I overlook that? So, you know what you
[1:34:03] do? You take notes
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; for the following year.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to come back and do
[1:34:08] the same thing and expect a different
[1:34:10] result. That's insanity.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? I'm just bearing my
[1:34:15] heart with you this morning. We're we're
[1:34:16] in a place of oasis.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; I've been wounded. You've been wounded.
[1:34:21] But I'm not going to say that we just oh
[1:34:22] well, we just we just sit around. No,
[1:34:24] there's a way. There's a way God has a
[1:34:26] ministry to wounds because he doesn't
[1:34:28] want us to remain wounded because when
[1:34:30] we're wounded, we then become vulnerable
[1:34:33] to wound other people.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; My first dog that I had, Brock, he he's
[1:34:39] one of his his nails was I don't know
[1:34:41] what he did, biting or whatever. It runs
[1:34:43] in the family, I guess. And it came off.
[1:34:45] And he had just that quick sticking out.
[1:34:48] So I thought, I'm going to get clippers.
[1:34:50] I'll help him out. Brock was as gentle
[1:34:54] as a day is long.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Those of you know you were there with
[1:34:57] him.
[1:34:59] But in that moment when I went to go for
[1:35:01] that thing, he he kind of snapped at me.
[1:35:06] My brother said, you know what my
[1:35:07] brother said? I said, dear, what do I
[1:35:09] do? He said, "Just put him in his cage."
[1:35:13] And he said, "When he when he's in
[1:35:14] there,
[1:35:16] he'll figure it all out. He'll he'll
[1:35:18] take care of it." Let me just tell you
[1:35:19] something. When there's wounds in my
[1:35:22] life and your life, it ain't been me
[1:35:24] that's figured it all out.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what it's been is when
[1:35:28] we can just get into his presence
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; and say, "Wait a minute, devil. I don't
[1:35:33] need your interpretations
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; cuz you have you have caused me to
[1:35:37] misjudge and misrepresent things all
[1:35:40] down through my life
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; and things that I felt that was exactly
[1:35:45] so real.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; But I don't need this because that's
[1:35:51] what's caused all of that and built that
[1:35:53] up my life. But Lord,
[1:35:56] help me to see. Lord,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; see what you're doing is you got to get
[1:36:00] like that prophet called that wound. He
[1:36:01] said that's like that wounded deer where
[1:36:03] where the enemy's tried to take chunks
[1:36:05] out. There might have been a lot of
[1:36:06] chunks. There might have been chunks
[1:36:08] through relationships, chunks through
[1:36:10] jobs, chunks through bosses, chunks
[1:36:12] through family, a lot of things, right?
[1:36:14] Even here.
[1:36:16] Well, so and so said this to me and so
[1:36:18] and so said did this to me. I'm not
[1:36:20] excusing anything. But what I am saying
[1:36:22] is is that here we are in a place in our
[1:36:25] humanity and God allows these things.
[1:36:27] And oh, how it should bring us to a
[1:36:29] place to say, God, how I need to stay
[1:36:32] under the blood.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Because it's just like you get out from
[1:36:37] under the blood, you're like a person
[1:36:39] that ain't ate.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; It's true. The prophet told us in the
[1:36:43] message of shame. He said when you are
[1:36:45] out of God's presence, you become
[1:36:47] prickly like a cactus. He did not say
[1:36:50] you're no longer a son and daughter of
[1:36:52] God. He's letting you know the source of
[1:36:54] your strength is in his presence. Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's in his presence where there's
[1:37:00] real memory.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Because it's in his presence,
[1:37:06] and I'm talking about his presence
[1:37:07] that's come and changed your life.
[1:37:09] Listen, the prophet tells us, he said,
[1:37:12] it wasn't an emotion.
[1:37:14] It wasn't something like that. It wasn't
[1:37:16] that you shouted or you He said, "That's
[1:37:18] not what it is." He said, "But your
[1:37:19] remembrance has got to be deeper to
[1:37:21] where you remember his presence of what
[1:37:24] he's done for you, where he brought you
[1:37:26] from."
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Sam, no, I'm not where so
[1:37:29] and so is. Don't look where so and so
[1:37:31] is.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; But remember where he brought you from.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; It's you're his testimony.
[1:37:41] Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; If he can just get to that lifegiving
[1:37:45] source, the blood stops,
[1:37:48] the bleeding stops,
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; misunderstood.
[1:37:58] Prophet picks this up with this oasis
[1:38:01] and he takes us to the well of Bellar
[1:38:04] Rohi. Oh, I don't know if I've
[1:38:05] pronounced that right, but he said here
[1:38:07] was Hagar. You see, brother happens to
[1:38:10] be able to pull that up and bring that
[1:38:12] as a type even to our life in that
[1:38:15] he said when things
[1:38:18] we've only been we've only done what
[1:38:20] we've been expected to do and asked to
[1:38:22] do. He said that's all Hagar did. And
[1:38:24] when Hagar did all of that, she couldn't
[1:38:27] understand why am I being put out of the
[1:38:29] camp?
[1:38:31] The prophet said she didn't. He said and
[1:38:32] that's why you know he says you don't
[1:38:35] understand why you've been you know
[1:38:37] there at the world and and among your
[1:38:39] job and among other places and why is
[1:38:42] there things that seems like you're
[1:38:43] being excluded why is there things that
[1:38:46] is coming around in that way the prophet
[1:38:48] said it's a misunderstanding
[1:38:50] you're being misjudged they because why
[1:38:53] of what is actually taking place in your
[1:38:55] life but then let's just be honest
[1:38:59] because it's very comfortable to leave
[1:39:01] it out there.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; But where Satan loves to bring it is
[1:39:08] misunderstandings in here.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you what a mis a
[1:39:13] misunderstanding
[1:39:15] it's not about where one person is right
[1:39:18] and one person's wrong. That's not a
[1:39:21] misunderstanding.
[1:39:24] But a misunderstanding is
[1:39:28] like God said come and let's reason
[1:39:31] together
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; because Satan thrives in
[1:39:36] misunderstandings.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon says even he
[1:39:40] said when he saw different ones at times
[1:39:42] he said as he said I've seen people get
[1:39:45] in the flesh.
[1:39:47] He said I've seen that in their worship.
[1:39:49] He said but I never say nothing about
[1:39:50] it. He said, 'You know why? It's
[1:39:53] dangerous. He said, 'What I say is is
[1:39:55] God, they love you just like I do.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; They want to go just like I That's why
[1:40:00] the prophet never even called stuff out
[1:40:03] about speaking in tongues.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; My wife and I were just fellowshipping
[1:40:08] about this yesterday about even when
[1:40:10] brother Brandham, God revealed to him
[1:40:12] about Sister Shakarion
[1:40:14] that she was going to be passing away.
[1:40:17] I can't remember the exact tape, but
[1:40:19] when we started talking about it, I
[1:40:20] said, I remember the message where all
[1:40:22] of a sudden, probably you do too, that
[1:40:24] tongues ran rang out. And when they rang
[1:40:25] out in that message, it was forceful,
[1:40:28] but my she's going to be raised up.
[1:40:32] You know what brother Brandham did right
[1:40:34] in front of the microphone? He said,
[1:40:35] "Praise be to God.
[1:40:38] Thank you, Lord Jesus."
[1:40:41] I'm saying this, we had an example that
[1:40:44] before. I didn't listen, brother Brand.
[1:40:46] him up. But it shows us an example of
[1:40:48] where the prophet, what if he would have
[1:40:49] stood in the microphone and said, "That
[1:40:51] is false because God has showed this to
[1:40:54] me." What would that have done?
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; You might as well fold the chairs up.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Give them back their offering.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Just Just give them back.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; It's done. There's nothing God's going
[1:41:08] to be able to do. But the prophet showed
[1:41:10] us what it means as a mature son of God
[1:41:13] when you know you're standing in the
[1:41:15] right.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; You still that becomes expressed through
[1:41:20] our compassion to others. Oh God, so
[1:41:22] work in these tabernacles.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Work in our tabernacles, Lord. Work in
[1:41:26] my tabernacle.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Work in me, Lord.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Clear out more of Samuel, Lord. There's
[1:41:32] too much Samuel.
[1:41:35] It's okay. You can say amen to that.
[1:41:36] Amen.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; I'll call your name out next.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; It's too much. I don't know about you,
[1:41:41] that that's where my mind I I look at
[1:41:43] those things. I reflect over things. I I
[1:41:45] look at situations and you see that.
[1:41:47] Look, even sometimes we think when
[1:41:49] sickness comes, Lord, is there something
[1:41:51] going on in my life? Sure, we examine
[1:41:53] our life, but many times being
[1:41:55] misunderstood and misjudged, that can be
[1:41:58] so hurtful.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; You think, I didn't even mean that.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I wasn't even I wasn't saying that.
[1:42:07] There times I've had to learn my lesson.
[1:42:09] Why? There's many times I don't even
[1:42:11] text. I just call.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; You know why? Sometimes in text
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; you don't see somebody's face even
[1:42:18] though a person knows me.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; But they don't see my face.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; They don't know tone.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; That's why there's a lot of things. It's
[1:42:29] just like even when I have the trustees
[1:42:30] meetings, I don't like texts. I like
[1:42:32] text to communicate or deacons and all
[1:42:34] the I like text to communicate as far as
[1:42:37] this is going to happen if such and such
[1:42:38] but I I why because it is being wise as
[1:42:42] a serpent and harmless as a dove.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; I know how Satan likes to get in on
[1:42:46] things.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; It's tone.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; We're not ignorant of his devices.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; And yet we can yet Satan can he all
[1:42:54] Satan wants to do is bring a
[1:42:55] misunderstanding.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:57] That's what And then he wants to do he
[1:42:59] starts building and then it's like, "Oh
[1:43:02] yeah, this makes sense. Oh,
[1:43:05] then you hear this little clip on the
[1:43:06] radio. Let me get my mortar. That makes
[1:43:10] sense. Let me get this. That makes
[1:43:13] sense." And for long there's a wall.
[1:43:19] Let me tell you,
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; he's our oasis. Yes, he is.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you for this
[1:43:25] misunderstanding,
[1:43:27] he's our oasis.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; It's not about, you know, as far as
[1:43:31] everybody ironing everything out, but
[1:43:33] yes, the Bible does say, "Let us come.
[1:43:35] Let's reason together. Let's let's
[1:43:36] let's" because you know what in reality
[1:43:38] is? There's things, no doubt that we've
[1:43:40] been misunderstood, things we've said
[1:43:42] wrong, and things we've thought wrongly,
[1:43:43] and my this was said this way. That
[1:43:46] happens.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; I said that happens.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And that includes everybody. Even if
[1:43:52] there's somebody hiding in the baptism
[1:43:53] tank.
[1:43:58] Weary.
[1:44:00] Anybody ever get weary?
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; I tell you one thing you get get you
[1:44:07] weary.
[1:44:09] Sometimes we can get weary. The Bible
[1:44:11] says this in the book of Galatians the
[1:44:13] last scripture
[1:44:15] says be not weary
[1:44:18] in welloing.
[1:44:20] You know, one of the biggest
[1:44:21] discouragements that can come
[1:44:23] is when you feel like you're pouring in
[1:44:26] and you see nothing coming back.
[1:44:29] And then the enemy can start to work on
[1:44:31] you and say, see, the enemy will kind of
[1:44:33] just turn it. He'll turn it in a way to
[1:44:36] say maybe something's wrong with you.
[1:44:40] And then if you're not careful, then if
[1:44:41] you've already come through those
[1:44:43] places, then the enemy wants to turn it
[1:44:45] as though there's something wrong with
[1:44:46] the other person.
[1:44:49] There's a reason the scripture said, "Be
[1:44:51] not weary in welloing."
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Another part of the scripture says, "For
[1:44:57] we shall reap if we faint not."
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you,
[1:45:05] he giveth
[1:45:07] strength
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; to the weak.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you, he's he gives
[1:45:14] encouragement to those that are faint.
[1:45:16] But Sam, you ever been faint? Oh yeah.
[1:45:19] Weary. Oh yeah.
[1:45:21] Oh yeah.
[1:45:24] Remember, discernment is not always what
[1:45:26] you see, not always what you hear.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; But I I'm just trying to say to you, I'm
[1:45:32] not a superman. You're not you're we're
[1:45:34] not super people, but we have an oasis.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; And I can just share from my heart the
[1:45:40] things that we're I've grown weary. And
[1:45:43] sometimes, you know what the weary with
[1:45:44] the weariness of it is? is we think
[1:45:46] we're doing we think we're doing man
[1:45:49] what's right
[1:45:53] and we have we have everything laid out
[1:45:55] and God brings us to a place and says
[1:45:58] it's too much your strength
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; you don't need to make anything happen
[1:46:05] you don't need to make anything happen
[1:46:07] it's just like bringing your children
[1:46:09] along in the Lord
[1:46:11] you're right there with them working
[1:46:14] with them and encourage them, listening
[1:46:16] to them.
[1:46:18] Every time when I've talked with Paul
[1:46:21] and and and I hope you understand when I
[1:46:23] when I bring these when I bring things
[1:46:24] up with my family, I'm not a perfect
[1:46:26] father.
[1:46:28] Far from it. Many mistakes,
[1:46:32] but many things I've learned from. But I
[1:46:35] can tell you one thing is that when I've
[1:46:37] talked with them and throughout the
[1:46:38] time, maybe this will help you, is that
[1:46:41] I never continued every conversation
[1:46:45] telling them they needed to be born
[1:46:46] again.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; I know where they're at. I know they
[1:46:52] need him,
[1:46:54] but I I needed to be a channel
[1:46:58] where they could have confidence.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; They could open because you know what?
[1:47:02] It isn't my words that's going to bring
[1:47:04] the birth. That's not what did it for
[1:47:06] them. Him.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Because you see, that's why we don't
[1:47:12] want that's why God brings us even into
[1:47:14] this time and season to where we're not
[1:47:16] we're not focused on stations of but we
[1:47:20] recognize that it's and what I mean by
[1:47:22] stations is we're not looking for a
[1:47:23] certain thing to happen. And you you
[1:47:25] have to understand and I I'm over time.
[1:47:29] You have to understand even the season
[1:47:31] and the time that we're in.
[1:47:34] You'll find brother Brandham say a place
[1:47:35] back there and says I can take you to
[1:47:37] the day, the time, the hour. Right? How
[1:47:41] many have heard that? You heard that
[1:47:42] over the years. Okay. Now
[1:47:45] pair that
[1:47:47] with the Sister Bruce interview. I I
[1:47:49] don't know why that would be troubling,
[1:47:51] but
[1:47:52] brother Bam never says, "Oh yeah, Sister
[1:47:54] Bruce, I see you were at an altar one
[1:47:55] night. I see this happen." You know what
[1:47:58] he took her to? what she needed. She
[1:48:01] needed to stand on the word of God.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Sister, he says, "Normally, your desires
[1:48:06] would be this way, but they're not that
[1:48:09] way anymore." What? What? What changed
[1:48:11] that? She said, "Christ," he said,
[1:48:13] "That's your answer."
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; See, it's bringing it to because it's
[1:48:18] God coming and working in a sovereign
[1:48:20] way.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I'm overtime. We're looking for an
[1:48:24] oasis.
[1:48:26] But I want to say to you, it's a place
[1:48:28] of refreshment. I I I I've just preached
[1:48:31] from that thought of and where the Lord
[1:48:32] just stopped me yesterday morning. It's
[1:48:34] our oasis. He's our place of
[1:48:36] refreshment.
[1:48:38] We're we're a hospital.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we're a hospital. And
[1:48:42] in this hospital, we don't This hospital
[1:48:44] is not just a thirdf flooror hospital.
[1:48:46] It's emergency room.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of trauma. There's trauma
[1:48:54] areas. But you know what? There's a
[1:48:55] chief physician
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; who's present to take care of every
[1:49:00] situation
[1:49:02] and every situation. He'll lead us right
[1:49:04] in victory,
[1:49:06] Lord. But this, but no,
[1:49:09] I'm right here with you.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; I already knew this, but I've already
[1:49:13] made a way for you to live and walk in
[1:49:15] victory. Oh, you might have to keep that
[1:49:17] area of your life covered with the blood
[1:49:18] every single day of your life, but I'm
[1:49:20] I'm letting you know that I am your
[1:49:22] sufficiency.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm letting you know I'm your all
[1:49:25] and all. And I'm letting you know
[1:49:26] greater am I within you
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; I'm letting you know you're more than a
[1:49:33] conqueror through me.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; I gave my life for you that you could
[1:49:37] live victorious. I shed my blood. I made
[1:49:40] a way possible that I'm your oasis.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; That when you are parched here, you have
[1:49:45] a place. You can be refreshed. You can
[1:49:47] be refreshed. You come out of here.
[1:49:49] You're re revorated. You know, my wife
[1:49:52] many times we we're flying somewhere and
[1:49:54] and you know, I guess it's just, you
[1:49:56] know, a sister's thing because I just
[1:49:57] think of get off the plane, I get my
[1:50:00] baggage, get my car, get checked in at
[1:50:02] the hotel, and then I'm already starting
[1:50:04] to look at places to eat. I'm hungry.
[1:50:07] I've been on coffee the whole and and
[1:50:10] and this is what she says each time.
[1:50:12] Well, honey, I just want to go to the
[1:50:13] room and I need to refresh a little.
[1:50:15] Refresh.
[1:50:17] But see, that's not that's the
[1:50:19] difference. I'm looking at check in,
[1:50:22] unload, get back in the car, go get
[1:50:24] something to eat, but I need to refresh,
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; you know, from the trials, uh, traveling
[1:50:30] throughout the day.
[1:50:32] And I'm glad that God, as his bride,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; he's provided a place of refreshment.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; We can say, Lord,
[1:50:40] before I face tomorrow, I want to be
[1:50:43] refreshed today.
[1:50:45] before I try to approach that which is
[1:50:48] laying on my desk or on my computer or
[1:50:50] where that's at. Before I want to be
[1:50:52] refreshed before I go to meet, I want to
[1:50:54] be refreshed in your presence, Lord.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Judith, he's our
[1:51:02] oasis.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; He's our place of refreshment.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that?
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:14] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:51:22] Blessed be his name.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Let's just let's just bow our heads in a
[1:51:28] word of prayer. And maybe as we'll just
[1:51:30] even just go to the Lord in prayer and
[1:51:32] then pray for one another and then we'll
[1:51:34] get ready to just come through the line
[1:51:36] if the brothers want to go ahead and
[1:51:38] come. Um,
[1:51:41] Amen, brother Gomez. And
[1:51:44] brother Carlos, go ahead. Brother
[1:51:45] Richard has to leave for to attend to
[1:51:48] Sister Maria. And we're so thankful for
[1:51:50] what God's doing for Sister Maria. And
[1:51:52] man, it's just what a testimony how God
[1:51:54] is just bringing her right along. And so
[1:51:58] we want to just offer a word of prayer.
[1:52:00] What a privilege. I want to say it's
[1:52:02] such a privilege.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; To not only serve the Lord, but it's a
[1:52:07] privilege to serve you.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God could never have given
[1:52:12] me any higher honor
[1:52:15] than to be able to serve his people.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; He's faithful.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And I want to say it to you like I would
[1:52:23] say to my own children as I would ask
[1:52:25] them, forgive dad if I responded in the
[1:52:28] wrong way. If I misjudged something, if
[1:52:31] I didn't listen and I jumped to it,
[1:52:33] forgive dad.
[1:52:36] I want to ask you, forgive me.
[1:52:41] And I don't want to just just just a
[1:52:43] casual just I don't want it to be
[1:52:44] something just blanket, but I mean it
[1:52:46] from my heart.
[1:52:48] And if there's something you'd feel like
[1:52:49] you'd need to come and talk to me,
[1:52:51] believe me, I won't be offended at all.
[1:52:53] I want to be I want everything to be
[1:52:55] reconciled. I won't want I don't want
[1:52:56] the enemy to have one little way in
[1:52:58] there,
[1:53:00] but I want you to know I love you.
[1:53:03] It's the greatest privilege that God has
[1:53:05] given to be able to pastor this
[1:53:08] assembly.
[1:53:11] We're going to make it.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; I said we're going to make it.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; But Sam, you don't know all the
[1:53:18] failures, but you know what? You're
[1:53:20] still his child.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; You're still my brother. You're still my
[1:53:24] sister. One of these days we step the
[1:53:27] other side,
[1:53:28] that's gone. That's gone. But here in
[1:53:31] this oasis, it's a place to refresh.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; You got wounds, come to the oasis.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; You're weary, come to the oasis.
[1:53:45] Misunderstood, come to the oasis.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; And for us,
[1:53:53] I'm coming to the oasis. The refreshing
[1:53:57] God, give me grace.
[1:53:59] Help me to discern things the right way.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Help me to catch things the right way.
[1:54:05] Help me, Lord.
[1:54:07] Help me, Lord.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:54:13] how we love you, Lord Jesus.
[1:54:21] You're so merciful to us, Lord.
[1:54:26] Oh God,
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; we remember Lord what you have done for
[1:54:30] us,
[1:54:33] you have made it all possible.
[1:54:37] As your prophet said, like when we come
[1:54:39] to this table, he says the table of the
[1:54:41] Lord, he's talking about us coming
[1:54:43] together in service and fellowship
[1:54:45] around the word. And he said that at
[1:54:49] your table,
[1:54:51] it's not a menu where you ask for an
[1:54:53] item and they say, "Oh, we're fresh out
[1:54:55] of it." But he says, "He's not fresh out
[1:54:58] of anything.
[1:54:59] You have what we have need of, Lord.
[1:55:02] You've not run out of anything on the
[1:55:04] menu. You've not run out of joy." As a
[1:55:07] matter of fact, the Bible says, "There's
[1:55:09] unsearchable riches.
[1:55:12] You're rich in mercy."
[1:55:14] Oh, God. Lord, we come to you this
[1:55:18] morning so thankful for what you've
[1:55:21] done, where you've brought us from, oh
[1:55:25] Lord, from all not only different walks
[1:55:26] of life, but we see what you've done in
[1:55:29] our lives, where you've brought us,
[1:55:31] Lord, from just walking about under the
[1:55:33] prince of power of the air, just out
[1:55:35] there. But Lord, God, you made a way
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; that we could serve you. We could know
[1:55:41] you, we could live for you. That that's
[1:55:43] what it's all about, Lord. is to be of
[1:55:45] service to you. I want to say thank you
[1:55:48] and I want to say thank you Lord for
[1:55:52] every test and every trial.
[1:55:55] I want to say thank you for this oasis
[1:56:00] that Lord where I can we can look and
[1:56:04] thank you for the grace
[1:56:07] that Lord that I and that every
[1:56:10] individual might be able to reflect in
[1:56:12] our own lives.
[1:56:15] Oh God,
[1:56:17] Lord Jesus, how I thank you.
[1:56:23] Lord God, the your presence Lord and how
[1:56:26] you bring us Lord to these realities and
[1:56:29] to bring us in our lives to these places
[1:56:32] because you desire to do for us Lord.
[1:56:35] You desire to move Lord even in a in a
[1:56:38] deeper way in our lives.
[1:56:40] So I ask Lord that you would forgive us
[1:56:42] of our sins and our shortcomings.
[1:56:45] Forgive us Lord
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; if we've offended Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I pray Lord you'd forgive me. Forgive
[1:56:57] every one of your children.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, for the misunderstandings,
[1:57:05] misjudgments,
[1:57:07] oh God, I pray in this oasis, Lord, of
[1:57:11] your presence, will you just move
[1:57:12] through, Lord, for every one of our
[1:57:15] hearts, Lord, through every womb,
[1:57:16] through every Lord, the weary, Lord. Oh
[1:57:20] God, would you just Lord just so
[1:57:23] encourage us Lord? Give us Lord a real
[1:57:27] refreshing Lord and just Lord our
[1:57:30] expectations that it would be in you
[1:57:33] Lord what it will ought to be for this
[1:57:35] season in this moment. Help us give us
[1:57:37] the wisdom Lord give us the wisdom and
[1:57:40] discernment Lord even in our approaches
[1:57:43] Lord. Oh God we need you Lord.
[1:57:47] Oh father, as you said, the sons of God
[1:57:49] are led by the spirit of God. That is a
[1:57:52] privilege, Lord.
[1:57:55] Oh Jesus, grant it. Lord, I pray,
[1:57:59] Father.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:58:04] as we come, Lord, to partake of this
[1:58:06] bread and of this wine, Lord,
[1:58:08] representing your body that was broken
[1:58:11] for us and your blood that was shed for
[1:58:13] us. Lord, we are one worthy, Lord God.
[1:58:16] But you reached down your hand for us,
[1:58:18] Lord.
[1:58:20] Oh Lord God, you brought us, Lord Jesus,
[1:58:24] like we were, Lord, at times like the
[1:58:26] woman at the well. Nobody cared, Lord,
[1:58:28] but you cared, Lord.
[1:58:31] And I can't altogether say nobody cared.
[1:58:33] I had different ones around me. I know
[1:58:35] they had parents, but I think of other
[1:58:38] brothers, Lord, who took an interest in
[1:58:40] me.
[1:58:42] They would talk to me about things that
[1:58:44] they knew I was interested in.
[1:58:48] Oh God,
[1:58:50] you expressed your care through those
[1:58:52] lives. I never forget those brothers.
[1:58:56] Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:58] Thank you, Father.
[1:59:01] Oh, God. I pray.
[1:59:05] We want to say thank you
[1:59:09] because just as you laid down your life
[1:59:12] as brothers and sisters, Lord, what a
[1:59:14] privilege and lives have been laid down
[1:59:17] for us that we can have this blessing
[1:59:20] that we have now. Lord,
[1:59:23] I pray God may you just bless the
[1:59:25] worshipper in such a special way.
[1:59:29] Lord, we love you and we thank you
[1:59:33] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[1:59:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:42] Hallelujah. Maybe
[1:59:44] brother Gomez, just have you stand right
[1:59:46] here and then brother Carlos on over
[1:59:48] there. Why don't we have the musicians
[1:59:51] go ahead and come first and then that
[1:59:52] way you can come on up and play for us.
[1:59:58] Amen.
[1:59:59] musicians first.
