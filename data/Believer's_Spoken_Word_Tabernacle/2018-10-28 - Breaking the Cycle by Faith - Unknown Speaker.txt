shake someone's hand as you're being seated so good to be in the house of the Lord I was glad when they said unto me let us go unto the house of the Lord Amen hallelujah are you happy this morning amen glory be to God oh my unless it be the name of the Lord I before asked brother Adam and sister Boulder bring a little faith forward here you know these scriptures we've been ministering off of so this inspiration here for a while and will you see that the Lord Jesus you know he never told them to bring the children unto Him but they began to recognize a presence that was in his life and they began to bring the little children unto Him if he had told them to do that then the disciples would never have rebuked those who were doing it but you see the disciples were looking at something and such a greatness of what God was doing in that moment in that hour and yet they themselves did not even have the full understanding of what God was really doing in that hour because it hadn't been revealed inside of them but it was something that was so real to where that it had drawn them from all of their walks of life it wasn't that Peter still wasn't a fisherman it wasn't that they still didn't have the skills of those things it's just that him walking in their midst took preeminence over all other things in their lives and then as the people began to witness this working that was taking place they began to bring children to him and the Bible says that he should touch them they just wanted him to touch them and and we find that within this the disciples looked at it and they said this why why would we do this you don't bother him don't trouble him but you see the Lord Jesus reminded us that we're never in the midst of the greatness of God God's greatness does not create a puffed up Ness but God's greatness brings humility that God is concerned about the very least aren't you glad this is an effect and this is something that keeping in mind see their Lord Jesus was instructing them there don't get so much out on your own but recognizing what the greatness of God has come to do and God took this example here of the children and said for such is the kingdom of God and there's things that we want to be grown up in but there's things we want to be simple as children amen and you know God knows just how to bring that balance in our life he knows how to bring the maturity where it's needed to be and he knows how to work and condition in our life to where it stays as simple as a little child I'm glad aren't you and if we find this in the scripture if you have your Bibles if you were read with me in Genesis 48 I want to take you to this place in Genesis 48 because when they led brought the children to the Lord to the Lord Jesus they brought him to them to him that he should touch them and that he might bless them you know blessing is not just something that's of emptiness it's something that has a meaning it's an effect blessing itself even there in the Hebrew barak which is its annealing it's a blessing it is a respect it is a commending of one to another it's an action that takes place aren't you glad that the blessing of God is in action the blessing of God puts us into action it doesn't just bring a sensation it puts us into action so here I want to just read this scripture before we ask for the atom of sister bow to come in Genesis 48 verse 8 the Bible says Israel beheld Joseph's sons and said who are these Joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom God hath given me in this place and he said bring them I pray thee unto me and I will bless them see he's asking who are these jenkum knew who they were but he's asking them do you know who they are these are the children that God hath given me God hath given me so what he's doing is claiming his inheritance do you know this is my this is my inheritance now the Bible says in verse 10 the eyes of Israel were dimmed for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto Him and he kissed them and embraced them then if you if you turn with me over here in that same chapter and then the Bible says in verse 13 and Joseph took them both Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand and brought them near unto Him and Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Eve Rome's head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassas head guiding his hands wittingly for Manasseh was the firstborn and he blessed Joseph and said God before whom my father's Abraham and Isaac did walk the God which fed me all my life long unto this day the angel which redeemed me from all evil blessed the latter Lance not just me but the angel which redeemed me that angel that I wrestled with all night that same angel that same one blessed these lads the same one who redeemed me blessed these lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my father's Abraham and Isaac and let grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth what a reality is we stand here a dedication of the children we know that it's not just it's not a form but as we stand here in each time together we are declaring God this is a child that you have given to our union and we are dedicating it back to you and that dedication is just like that of Hannah were Hannah herself the purpose her desiring a child was not just that she would not be barren but within it she said I will give it unto you Lord that it will dwell in your house and I believe with all my heart that in dedication of children it come this is a reality that we realize that it is a continual working and an unfolding and an awesome responsibility that's given to us by God as parents things that we would want to do for them and love to give to them but yet there are things that God has given to us we can instruct we can teach we can nurture in the things of God but it takes the sovereign grace of God to bring them in to that life of which our words and our conduct and our home is to express of that land beyond the river but it takes Joshua it takes the grace of God to take them into that reality to see let us dedicate let us dedicate just as God himself dedicate you know God is dedicated to it to this working he who has brought us out of the world he moved within our life to bring us to himself you know he is dedicated to finishing what he started and when it comes to that moment of which you and I recognize more and more day by day it is the very grace of God not what we deserve your best day your greatest day all that you can do you still are not deserving of God's grace or else it's not grace yes by works but God's grace at that moment the sweep right in what we have been dedicated to all of these times here His grace will sweep in and take us home oh what a parallel we are the children of Abraham amen that that same name as Jacob said the same that name upon me that was upon Abraham that was upon Isaac that be upon them and I believe this morning his brother had him sister Beau would bring a little faith and we just want to pray just a prayer of dedication and that the Lord Himself would just watch over her life and guide them as parents direct them amen you love him we're within our [Applause] and then all the sisters you'll be able to see it after church if we could have just held it up here so you could have seen the face so your minds not wandering while the words coming forth she's beautiful just just trust me she's beautiful don't you love the Lord oh my thank you Lord Jesus oh my who the joy of the Lord is my strength say brother Sammy don't you ever get down oh you just don't know sure I get down sure I get discouraged sure there's things I can look at but I choose to look to him because he can't fail what he has said he is able to perform amen we're just so glad to have brother Timothy as Sean you're with us and we just are just so thankful I tell you what if you missed Thursday's service you need to get it download it stream it if you were here listen to it again tremendous tremendous you know I tell you I don't believe I need to tell you as a church that God when different ones are coming through and how God will orchestrate all of these things you know it's something for you and I to say well God you're speaking to me the Lord speak to me you know it's one of those things it's just boy I'll tell you what I know that God is really speaking to our lives in our hearts and you know what God don't have to do that like that let me tell you something peanut butter is peanut butter it's like I told him in other places where I go and preach I said peanut butter is peanut butter if I put peanut butter on bread and give it to you it's the same as your pastor putting peanut butter on it and giving it to you I said but God has a way that God will change the vessel and sometimes it's the presentation of it he don't have to do that but he does that because he loves us and he cares us and to her you and I can realize you know what this individual this brother doesn't know one thing about me I don't discuss nothing with the ministers that come through here I don't discuss anything with them at all that is up to God I've been places and I don't want to hear stuff I just be honest with you I don't want to hear stuff about know where I go I don't want to get my hair stuff about other places because you know what every place has its troubles you look down through the New Testament find one of the letters where there's a perfect church there's only one perfect Church and is the Church of the Living God born by the Spirit of God into that body that's the one he's coming back after and that's who our eyes are upon him amen because look it's a situation you know what God is the one to breathe to remedy any situation so I just say it like this I just encourage you and admonish you just pull on the gift of God as we we come into this coming week and we will have service on Thursday night as well but as we come in on Saturday and Sunday brother Jul will be here with us Friday with the youth there but let's just let's just pull on the gift of God these are not just meetings and things most of you know me I don't have people in just to have people in if I feel it upon my heart many times I'll call the man a year ahead of time it's a schedule for this date or I'll call for situations think scheduled for this time because there's enough for us to preach is like right now it's so hard it's like fire shut up in my bones but you know what God knows what we have need of and who we want to hear from is God he God might come and wear a different complexion might be a different stature but we want to hear from God a man and God is

the message of the hour praise the Lord god bless you so let's time to read a portion of the scriptures this morning we try to read from Genesis chapter 5 and just remind ourselves of some few things that which we have been taught that which has been given to us and we always want to remind ourselves because we don't want those things to slip out of our hands praise the Lord and then also we try to read from Hebrews chapter 11 Genesis chapter 5 they start from verse 1 this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created and I don't live 113 years and begot a son in his own likeness and after his image and called his name said and the days of Adam after he had begotten said were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters and all the days that I done lived with nine hundred and thirty years and he died let's jump and read from verse 18 and Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat Enoch and you not leave after he begat Enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and three years and II died and end up live 60 and five years and begot Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of end up with three hundred sixty and five years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him I mean let's read from Hebrews pushing from a bush chata 11 hebrews chapter 11 this route was five by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him may the Lord bless the reading of his only word Amen shall please be seated praise the Lord so our God is good he's always good a girl loves us and he cares for us our God is wonderful our God is excellent there is no like our God and I've got the same yesterday today and forever and I've got cash and I bought this i provider and i God is our healer and I God is our strength and our God is here because I was a word to a free I've got it in his name is there in the Amish so I've got this year and let's give a clap offering to the Lord he's so good to us is aggressive to know that he's here he said I would be there I would not leave you and I will not forsake you I am with you always what are their nights I am there even if you don't see me I am there even if you don't feel is there because we are not has to depend upon our feelings but we are dependent upon faith in the word of the Lord for either cometh to God must believe that he is and he's a reward of them that diligently seek Him he's goddess oh jesus said if you don't believe I am he you will die a sage is the Alpha and the Omega he is the beginning and the end a he is the word the truth and the life he is the first and Elijah he is the righteousness he is ever seen in a believer if you must believe is he is your Savior he is a healer he is a provider he is your Shepherd he is your guide he is your way he is your truth he is your life he that cometh must believe he is the same yesterday today and forever whoo hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus what a privilege people we are to be addressed by the king of having to be furthered by the king of heaven that a king of heaven will open our eyes to see that a king of every will call us to come to him coming to me or in dilemma and him elated I will give you rest the king of Amin has given us rest the king of Amina set us free or the king of feminists piranhas yes set us free and we are free forever we are free forever because the King set us free the team paid the price for us the price of redemption he paid it and the King said go you are free you are free he paid your price imperative we are free we are normal as opposed to say he bought us say you go we are now where to glory and nothing can bring us back we have been loosing and we are free praise the Lord let us be this morning later on breaking the cycle by faith breaking the cycle by faith when we speak of a cycle say a cycle is a series of events operations that reoccur regularly and usually leads back to the starting point a series of events that may occur regularly and usually lives back to the starting point or to the beginning again a cycle like we we see the sunrise in the ish and it travels and it just the worst and then is back again it's a cycle just the same thing we are the cycle of time and you know it's from this it does it lets go it cycle and we have day and night we have a cycle of the week and the month and the year no new moon no new month is had it no new week none it is desert sensing Brazil or so we have these cycles in our life that are cycles that I promise that every civilian there is a cycle that is the change in our lives it's a cycle we woke up in the morning afternoon evening is a cycle we have the world at the time and and we have the summer and we are default and we know winter is coming and we show it's a cycle prison oh Jesus it's a cycle of time the recycle for the month and the year and our run us our God is so good and so you know this is going to be that going to be that gonna be how great is our God and so the scripture that tells us the generation of other in the day that God created me it's a man FEMA care that he then and blessed them and called their name Adam many of him a Democrat male and male he created male and female and that is God's other and he blessed them that is what God God did that in the beginning that is God's other male and female not Mel and Mel and similar theme and math and see me anything contrary to the Word of God is seen see this unbelief of God's Word she is to miss the matter and when we inject our thoughts and our feelings into God's Word he's become perfected it's number the Word of God it is Antichrist it is death and that breath the continuity of God to inject into what God says God don't need our addition or our subtraction we cannot make it better than what God has given to us we cannot make it holier than what God has given it's not bad our works of righteousness it is where God's grace salvation is of the Lord believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and we are perfect that in Christ Jesus or the blood that was shed for us Oh hallelujah or the Prophet once said and I said I used to think the babies are innocent it'sa but I came to realize we are more innocent than the babies because of the blood of Jesus can you think about it because of the blood of Jesus we are not innocent oh the babies the power of the blood of Jesus I was talking to Russia and like to see the snow and nothing whiter than the snow but we are the only ones that are whiter than the snow what's in the blood of Jesus and we become whiter than the snow as we don't realize who we are and what he has made us or if we can really recognize it even if we can really see it or whether we'll leave so high but because we don't realize these things that has been done for us that has been made for us we live below our privileges that's why we go about with front faces and we keep worrying here and there but he told us God had to see us worried going to see you happy going to see you rejoicing going to see you pressing on going to see you progressing we must progress in our Christian life because life is progressing when babies are born they don't remember is the girl we were once babies but we have blown and the same was spiritually we must blow because if you don't glow it becomes a problem he becomes an issue he becomes a bad day but we have to grow we are happy to see our children growing and maturing and God is happy to see in student growing and maturing you can stay in one place you gotta grow the promise that when they will ask you so when will your Christian life so nice were better so glorious when was it said two years ago or last week or last month he say you bat lady he said answers you always be right now the best part of your life the best part of your life and my life should be right now because it gets glorious and it gets better as the day goes by [Applause] somebody must break the cycle of unbelief you gotta break the cycle of unbelief the cycle of droughts the cycle of risen II the cycle of backwardness you gotta break the cycle and moving to get the cycles what our friends are possible [Applause] resolute whoa brothers and sister there is more in God for us that is my god for us we've got to bread cycle and run a cycles of unbelief cycles of wanderings break the cycle and flap our wings for the skies our goal unlimited your unlimited we can go to any lunch we can go tonight the heavens before us we're gonna break the cycle of unbelief we're going to bring a psycho prisoner and flies my wings and go hallelujah the god help us and so we saw as the prophet told us as the Word of God open to us and I've got many first couples the first man Adam had a given dominion he gave him authority to rule over our friends he given Authority he gave me the media rule of a French heavy told us I don't had power before God and I don't could speak to the Sun and he could speak to the moon equal specialists but mountains he could speak to the trees Hanako said just move multi just move this one and everything of the atom he was the god of the earth he was the controller but Evelyn said God made man to be superior to control the best to control the wildlife to control the fishes in the sea man was given authority [Applause] hallelujah go get that authority to man and her Greta Jehovah and God made man is fattening he said I be the god of heavens the super the Almighty God and the god of the universe this control of our friends and you be the god of the earth and God God made Adam is co-partner and God said to Adam you know what we're going to do I'm going to create and you gonna lend him everything that God created under nameday he brought it to the partner I finished my work as a creator now you named a god aluminum atom hidden in there nothing again and one of my god period he brought it to other and he brought this animal something before Adam he didn't condone meant what he said what hey Adam Sean look at it was the name and I don't look at it and I don't look at it you want me to coordinate yes another said elephant and Gaza correct and Gaza that's what I want to call it that's the name of average I haven't put the touch of God other was under headship Adam was the control to the touch of God inspector Claddagh the mind of God hadn't cottage and you can little close to God and we can instruct us to work and we still under the headship of God that the thoughts of God we come to us that will speak his word will speak the mind of God will speak the part of God that God has selecia's through you do stinking comes through you it was Preston said to us that is one embed Mensa brother brother sir we have is pretentious but that means we manifest it we express it by woman's the under her ship was the Lord glory to God he brings another fear before Adam he said harder what is that and then look at its this rabbit you got it God did not change nothing whatever Adam called is lament to today and I said we can live so close to God let it be let me the stands in the center of the other and it does not cast a shadow and that's what he wants us to come to the message of the hour is to reflect Jesus Christ God and proof it God living in you God working in you God is resting in says to us that is one o'clock Christians Christ like Christ on two feet Christ who do not ever call grease cause Suzie cause someone Christ were in a dress company congress car what the vanilla is just a rope go behind the bay behind the budget ski is God was God we god help us to break the cycles reasoning say
