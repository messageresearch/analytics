brought him down to earth and we know that it was not just a chance but God came on a mission and he came to set free what had been taken captive that belonged to him amen and your witnesses tonight that I once was held captive but I've been set free and it took it took one greater than us to come on the scene and set us free and we're witnesses tonight of that amen and we thank God for His mercy tonight only and I just want to say God bless you today visitors that have come I know with the local church I sent it out and we had posted it there on Facebook as well - but brother jewel had to had to cancel out and I told him don't don't think about it it's okay he was under the pressure one of the friends of the family had had passed some of you may know I don't know I've met brother John Keith years ago he's from down around Beaufort South Carolina and he passed away suddenly they're in on Thursday night early Friday Friday morning actually was up in the johnson city tri-cities area when he when he passed at the hospital and you know it just shows one thing that you know you're always it's it's a place for a believer where you know I had I said that night they were they were talking about him getting good night's rest I said he went to sleep on this side and he woke up you talk about a good night's rest he had a real good night's rest he woke up really refreshed but we want to remember the family and and brother Jule was just really just really torn and not knowing what was going to do and he had asked me to pray and pray that he'll just you know the funeral being on different day and I just didn't have the heart to pray about that I said you know I know what that is the family they're going through that and so we'll just pray for that and so one thing about it there might be a different vessel but I believe that Lord he always is present if if we're focused on him coming because he's the one that really is the one who meets our needs and I just want to say I'm thankful that brother Alexander McGillis he was able to come and and you know even a brother Jesse Smith tomorrow to take it with the youth service I don't look at it that's just by chance God has things arranged we have a more of a greater understanding of that God has things arranged and you know to me I've never been able to understand it I've never been able to understand why I would go from here and why would go to minister somewhere else because to me if you're eating peanut butter and jelly you're eating peanut butter and jelly but you know God will even change the vessel that served that peanutbutter sandwich that's God's mercy because God's objective is just that we get it and in that something you know God could demand a lot of things and say you sorry humans and this but see God came down and become one of us and he understands everything that we go through even the commonalities but I'm glad that His grace it will override all of those things and then we can step back and say goodness Lord how you spoke and minister to my knee tonight and no doubt you know brother Randy you've heard is it my never heard it like that before and you preached fifty parts on it but you know it God has a way of doing it and that wonderful I'm just so thankful for that tonight and I'm just so grateful that brother Alexander and sister Maria that they would would come here and be with us in such a short notice and we certainly appreciate so without me without any further ado we want to just turn the service right over to to brother Alexander ask him just to take his liberty tonight and you know it's like this of all the truth that God has given us within this age and what is being ministered but yet when that word is coming remember it's divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit there's a channel that's being opened up and when that channel is opened up it's one of those things that you want to just move right in that channel for what God is is speaking to our hearts about and you watch there is that there's a blessing and there is needs that would be met right here tonight there's a channel that God has to open we want to move right in that channel you know when that man who was there on the stretcher and he could not get to that pool but here the angel would come down and they would trouble that pool at a certain time you know brother Brennan said it like this he said that wasn't a natural wind he said that was a supernatural wind he said because as soon as the person stepped in that water the water ceased trouble it was a supernatural wind and I believe in that same supernatural wind tonight because I've had an experience of that supernatural wind in my soul how many witnesses of that tonight okay men it changed your life when when we couldn't get to but he came to where we were at and lifted us up yeah that's real grace amen that's real grace tonight so we want to move in that channel where the Lord is speaking to our hearts tonight amen you hungry amen you ready to pull on the gift of God amen hallelujah well let's just invite brother brother Alexander to come on in and I know brother Alexander he's been here for the local church you're already many times but let's just pull on the gift of God tonight amen hallelujah I thought about tonight that I was going we were gonna make him sing won't it be a time but I don't I don't know if he would don't know if he'll do that or not we may have to get that in this weekend but let's just let's stand and I've seen that song let's see have your way have your way [Music] have you [Music] Wally spear fear [Music] [Applause] [Music] our hearts a boy Oh as we wait [Music] sweet Freddie [Music] our hearts and Oh [Music] have your way [Music] you're way [Music] have your way Amen is that your desire tonight a man we just looked now to the Lord and believed that he would have his way in our lives I mean God bless you tonight it's good to be with you can be seated for just a few moments here 1 a greedy 20 the name of the Lord Jesus Christ on behalf of the home church as well our pastor ray Erickson and we appreciate the opportunity to be here with you we want to remember where the jewel Fournier of course and our thoughts and prayers and no I'm not gonna sing that song tonight I have to be honest that was up where the Chuck Collins one time and I love her the jewel and I was doing a jewel for Nia impression which also will not do here tonight and unbeknownst to me he recorded on his phone and so this day I have to be nice to brother Chuck Collins so but I tell you what I learned a real fast lesson there and don't do that again it's not on the phones present so but just a great man of God great minister and we know that just even his helpful things how the devil's tried to come against him but he's been a faithful sermon of God so we just want to continue to remember him we want to also thank God for the opportunity said to be here with each of you this church the reputation that you have your love and your faith is Paul said about the Colossians it's just it's the thing that it's encouragement to me and so I hope it's okay to say something nice about you tonight I try not to always be a heart preacher sometimes I can be but I like to encourage people you know I like to be encouraged I used to not and then I got over myself a little bit you know brother branham he talks about in the pregame in church he said he was preaching one time he come out and somebody said hey yeah that was a great sermon he's like well thanks and the other ministers I said well you know I hope nobody ever comes to me and says that is like what do you mean he said well he says I want all the glory to go to God says well it does I like it myself he said and he said I have to be truthful he says well I don't like for the people to say to me you know bless God I said well there's one difference between you and me were the RAM said I'm honest about it you're not so you know as Christians you hear not you get told enough bad things after why you're kind of glad somebody says something nice about you so we just want to thank God for each and brother Randy good to see tonight I was just over and hope this is alright was Stover in Chennai but was your father started that church there or help help with it okay well Isaac Kumar okay yeah well I tell you what somebody put a lot of work in that church is the only church I've ever been to overseas where they started on time and so I was I'm not saying as a joke it's just it's so uncommon but they were taught you know if you set a certain time you do it a certain way and so I just really appreciated that there's somebody put a lot of work into there so praise the Lord for that and and if you have your Bibles tonight we'll have you stand I had a certain thought uh and uh the Lord kind took me a different way I see the Lawson's here they just heard this last week so sorry but we just believed Lord bring about a fresh anointing to it if I sound a little hoarse tonight I've been sick all week and the Lord has just made a way for me to be here I'm already sweating buckets you can see and usually takes me just a few minutes to do that so so you just pray for me tonight that I can find my liberty in the Lord amen and I believe that God can do anything I've just watched him do so many things and I believe that he's no different tonight amen proverbs chapter 22 this evening and we're gonna look in the 28th verse it's a short reading tonight proverbs chapter 22 verse 28 it says this remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have said amen remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set and one if we just bow our heads for word of Prayer this evening as we look to the author of this word now Heavenly Father we are certainly grateful for the opportunity to be here tonight Lord not just as church members but as sons and daughters of God and and the Lord our hearts are warm tonight by the presence of the Holy Spirit in this place Lord the warship and the friendly spirit of the people welcoming spirit Lord I just believe that you could find Liberty through this vessel and through these people tonight to do exceeding abundantly above anything that we could ask or think and lower you're just looking on to You Father that we would we would find that and we would just do that which is pleasing in your sight I pray take these lips of clay take the call from the altar and may everything that's said and done before your glory get yourself great glory and honor in this place I asked father lower there's many needs here tonight perhaps needs that we are not even aware of ourselves but before we would even know or ask about these needs you knew what they were and father I believe a divine appointment has been made with the people of God here tonight before the foundation of the world nothing has taken place tonight by happenstance or by chance but you have ordained this meeting and the the bringing about of how has come to pass because you have a divine purpose and it Lord and we just want to surrender to you now and say Amen LOI we accept Lord what you would have to do in our lives and we appreciate Lord that you would be mindful of us even the little things and father we just ask now you'd come bless this service the reading of the word which has been read tonight may your come in unfold a revelation to us and make this word more real to us in our own lives that we might live victorious as overcomers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and father would give you all the praise and glory and honor in Jesus name Amen and amen god bless you tonight just take a few moments here you may be seated while I remain standing amen take a few moments tonight and we'll just parachute out as brother Joel would say at the end amen I'm gonna preach on remove not the ancient landmark hey man and you look at this scripture we read tonight and the the idea of a landmark goes clear back to the book of Deuteronomy in the nineteenth chapter and I'll be referring to there for a little bit this evening and want to kind of just lay a foundation if I can but the ancient landmark of the idea is laid out by Moses in the book of Deuteronomy in the nineteenth chapter and the prophet of God he tells us the word Deuteronomy itself it means two laws Amen yeah it's what God does he has two different laws one of them is a law of life and one is a law of death one is a lot of blessing and one is a law of cursing and so to follow the word of life is to be blessed and to reject the word of life doesn't God place the perform a choices and now choose you this day life or death and then he exerts them to choose life so God wants us to have life you understand the Bible says that the thief comes to steal and to kill and destroy but he said I am come that you might have life and it abundantly amen so when you know when you hear a minister you see something whatever it be and it's something it's a source of death or it's trying to rob or take from the people of God what God has given us you know who's bringing it amen cuz listen God wants us to have life and he wants us to have it abundantly amen not just an abundance of stuff that pertains life but his own life Zoe in abundance the power to overcome him and that this mortal will be quickened by his spirit it would be thrown into subjection to the Word of God it would quicken this mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in us is that right and so it's a law of life and death and the believer is that right the Paul said the law of God I want to serve God with the law of my mind he said but there was another law in me the law of sin and death of my members and when I would go to do good evil as present the things I would do I don't the things I don't want to do that's what I do amen but thank god there's another law for the believer tonight while the world is subject to vanity while the world is subject to the nature of sin that they are born in the believer has another recourse tonight they've come to the very person a man of eternal life Jesus Christ and that is right now and this is simply tonight if you were a believer there is right now no more condemnation to those who are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit who they were we are made alive how but the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus it has made us free from the lobster net hey man look I'm not just trying to get free from The Lofts and there's so many Christians they still struggle with it but I can proclaim right now by faith no matter if there's mistakes no matter if there's trials or things I'm going through the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has already made me free from the law of sin death listen I'm not halfway at the prison house today I have escaped the corruption that is in the world through last how by the holy ghost that liveth in me listen my nature has changed from the things of death and the things alive and that's why you're here tonight that's why I'm here tonight we didn't come here to fulfill a religious obligation like some sinners they go to church and they do the things they hate and they say the things they hate and they continue to do things that they hate but they do because get them to heaven one day but we're here tonight because our nature has been changed the axes been laid to the root of the tree the law of sudden death has been destroyed in the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus amen oh yeah well praise the Lord the law of blessing in the law of cursing the law of life in the law of death now this book of Deuteronomy lays up the laws of inheritance and the promised land is that right we know from the Book of Ruth you look at the idea of an inheritance that if a man if you found a bondage or if his if his progeny if they died or something happened he had an inheritance and if something were to take place he could go back and redeem that inheritance is that Alright the person could go back if you had somebody if you had a child Lee died and they had no children by their wife but a kinsman redeemer was the rise up whoever the next of kin was the rise up and raise up children in the deceased name that their inheritance would not perish from the earth amen now this is what happens in the Book of Ruth of course Boaz he goes and he goes before the elders of the gates and and he's trying to take their inheritance through Naomi because there's a Ruth that he wants to purchase amen now notice there's a near kinsman in the equation Amen there's a near kinsman there and he says okay look there's an inheritance it has to be redeemed would you like to inherit it well of course he's like yeah I'd love to buy that land I'd love to have the inheritance of the Atlantis's that's fine but know this on the day you redeemed the inheritance of Naomi you must also take Ruth as your wife well he wasn't interested in the wife he was just shouldn't land so he said let's I can't do that with Marv my own inheritance he says he could not take this inheritance without marring his own inheritance a man I'm so thankful the devil can't come behind the blood of Jesus Christ tonight he'd actually become your brother to do it it's all right well it's the truth anyhow hey man praise the Lord he's like I'm not able to redeem it you do it so boy takes off his shoe before the others of the gates and that day he redeems the inheritance of Naomi now listen he was not like this first kinsman a man he was not really like he had a field and then he was interested in the land he had land is that right but what he was interested in was the bride that come with it is that right listen our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he died to pay for the sins of the world because he won in the white house not because he wanted North Korea because he wanted a Walmart but there was a bride that come with that inheritance we were the treasure in that field is that right you were the mr. that was hid its Christ in you the hope of glory and the world passes you by and they see a widow woman they see some off scouring the earth but yet in the sight of God you are precious and elect amen the Bible says brother an consider your calling not many noble not many mighty are called is that right but God has chosen the foolish things the basin's yeah the things that are despised to confound the wise to can found the my desire listen God took the very best that he had he took his very inheritance and he gave it to what the very worst of humanity the lowest of the hallelujah couple amens their truth anyhow Paul cities of chief of sinners himself that's how he felt about it listen God give it back to the very best a human had offer but the very worst say ma'am because there is something hidden inside your field there is something hidden inside your vessels that Alright God had a thought of you before the foundation the world look he didn't see you is defeated he didn't see you some sinner some passionate job he saw a sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ he said if I got to bite myself hey man I won't tell the devil about I'm not going to tell the world about it but am i hot that church that feels nothing will buy for myself and I'm gonna redeem that inheritance under myself well hallelujah hey remember the time talks about this in the breach between the seal she talks about this girl or god it's the word for Redeemer amen but Isis fulfilling though the Word of God I'll the right of redemption is the Redeemer amen and our Redeemer did the same thing now I want you to watch this because we're talking bout two laws a lot of life and a lot of death amen because this word girl has a compound meaning as well what is a meaning of life as a redemption but the same word appears in the scripture as an Avenger of the blood when you read Deuteronomy 19 the bottle is out the supremacist a man that if a man would arise that listen let's say we're out in the field one day and brother browning I are working all sudden his he says you know I don't I don't like brother Alex very much he just he just whacks me in the back head and I drop dead I don't know why he would do that let's say he goes and does that hey man my mine near kinsman is required as an Avenger oh girl same day who is a redeemer in one instance is an Avenger in the other he's required by the law to raise up and find vengeance for me hey man because that's what the law required so the same word for redeemer is the same for an Avenger is that right now Christ is the Avenger of the but is that right he's the Avenger of the brother and the vengeance is mine saith the Lord and going all kinds of scriptures about this revelations chapter 19 verse 2 says were true and righteous are his judgments for he have judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand hey men listen I found something out my life while ago I found out God can fight a battle a lot better than I can it's the truth it's alright I'll tell you what when I was a sinner I used to try to get my own way a man I'm gonna get back at this guy I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that but I found that God fights battles a lot better than I do is you just silly let God deal with the problem in man God knows exactly how to rectify a situation he knows exactly how to bring your enemy to its knees amen so now you have an Avenger tonight and your Avenger is also a gun a Redeemer as well amen it's a lot of life and the law of death amen now we're talking with the landmark tonight because we're talking about this scripture I hope this is all right as I just kind of lay a foundation tonight but in this place where they had the Redeemer and they had the right of redemption and they had these different things they'll out the cities of refuge and this pertains to their Redeemer a man there was six cities of refuge laid out and Deuteronomy 19 and the purpose of these was this let's go back to the original story and this time he's swinging a golf club and the Bible uses an axes example whatever be and he's not meaning to do anything and the axe head flies off and strikes me that had not died now he didn't mean to kill me didn't mean to do it is that right it was an accident but yet there's an Avenger that's required to come after him so his only recourse is to flee to one of these cities of refuge amen if a man was innocent and his cause he was not really he didn't mean to do it though he was he was outwardly guilty though it looked like he was guilty of a crime he could flee to one of these six cities of refuge and when he would go out now Brooklyn I like high dramatized this he says you might be he might be heading towards that city refuge he's looking on every rock he's looking around every tree because there's an enemy knows there's an Avenger that's hard to get him there's a pressure that comes with that but once it comes into that city of refuge all the pressure is gone he knows he's safe from the Avenger livens you cannot touch him or take his alive when it comes to that City of Refuge a man and program said so does today we have a City of Refuge there was people in the world they didn't mean to be sinners they were born in sin they were shaped in the neck they didn't mean to do those things but God has given us a refuge God has given us a way of escape from the Avenged Christ has not appointed us unto wrath but to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ is that right who's been sent off that man to come to the city he had to plead his cause before the gate and if that man lied office if he was lied he come there by false pretence he said it did not matter if that man clung to the very horns of the altar then Avenger could come in and drag him on the street and slay him is that right he says but if he was innocent his cause was found just before the other that muncher could not come in and could not take his life well I believe we have a refuge today brother Branham said is that right we've got a place for people that don't mean to do wrong but they've got a place where they can let off the pressure it's in Christ amen and that beautiful we got a place where we don't have to pretend and then we don't have to try to be something you just are you just are the Ridhima man so many Christians struggle trying to be something amen but listen just be who you are you are the redeemed you are the redeemed of God you are the Bride of Christ you are the saved you're the viewer the inheritance that he saw is that right well praise the Lord amen there's a City of Refuge today how do you get into it well by one spirit we're all baptized into one body is that right praise the Lord somebody now I talked about this inheritance I'm coming to a thought with this I want you understand this inheritance God lays out the cities of refuge anyways all these rules about the inheritance and there's a reason he's doing this because this is inheritance it's not like something that you you know you bought in the paper and you're gonna leave it to your kids and and you know six months after you die they're gonna squander it all like some people's inheritance amen you see that is that right the Bible talks about that in the book of Ecclesiastes out a man let well it's only just spending is that right this inheritance is not like that this was to be an everlasting inheritance to all generations and so God is very particular about this inheritance because if I have an inheritance in this promised land that might shouldn't have that inheritance and their children after them will have that inheritance and there shall not for them will have the same inheritance look sold into slavery that I'm not going to dad yet every 50 years there's a Jubilee and if the sounding of the Jubilee they can return to their original inheritance it did not matter what was over their head or what their condition was an inheritance belong to those people forever and then listen I believe God has given us an inheritance I don't think was just for a day gone by I don't believe this Pentecostal blessing was just for one church age I believe it promises this Bible or just for another day amen I believe it's to all God's people for all generations the Bible says every ever promise of God in him is yay and ever promised amen is that right if you come into Christ if you've come into your city of refuge your place of an inheritance night these redemptive promises belong to you just as much so they belong to Moses as much as it along to lies if not more you've got more revealed today than they had is that right well hallelujah the Apostle Paul said we're looking for your glass darkly but then he said in one hour a day he said face to face what has happened to us a man has come and turned on the light is that right the working changed the mayor didn't change but when the truth is vindicated it becomes lies we have vindicated word come and light is shined upon this word that these promises that are still the same with an appropriate realization by this revelation of what belongs to us today we're not guessing we're not probing God has declared it to us here the Prophet Malachi 4 is that right well hallelujah praise the Lord no matter what condition you were in when you heard the Jubilee you could go back to the original inheritance that your father set as misses don't remove the extra lemma which thy fathers have set what in Malachi come to do restore the hearts of the children to their fathers is that right the landmark was not to be moved that your fathers had said Amen well praise the Lord you dorami in chapter 19 verse 14 says thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark which they have old time Amen I like the hat which they've all done of setting them inheritance which thou shun hair and that the LORD thy God giveth me to possess today man so when these people come into this land and they built Lee cities a refuge and then do all these things they would come to their inheritance and for them to know it doesn't listen like I said this inheritance this is gonna go on for awhile by the grace of God and so for them to know what belong to them he said I want you to go to your land and sell some landmarks once you go to the edge your property and put some landmark there and want you to go over here and find the edge of your property and maybe pop some stones up here let me drop a staking over here never got that amen I remember my daddy was literally bought new property they had won them big it wasn't rebar one of them big ball sticks they driving the ground they men and you knew when the farmer hit your tree he crossed your property line cuz you knew exactly where his land and his land ended and where yours began is all right it's a landmark well they didn't have GPS in google.com back then that's how they knew they put landmarks up so they said don't remove these landmarks now is that right in fact blood in this Bible in the book of Deuteronomy he pronounces a curse on those that would move the landmark now why is that because when you move this landmark you're not just robbing your neighbor you're robbing his children you're robbing his children's children you're robbing every generation afterward amen it's just like murder you're not just killing the man but every child that that man would have afterwards he's thinking about Abel every child that was in him by potential died when he died is that right he meant somebody is this water praise the Lord I'm getting me some water here excuse me amen so the danger these landmarks a man was that they could be moved so God pronounces a curse on them that would move the landmark thank you Lord and even up to the time the 10th in the New Testament the Roman government had penalties they still use landmarks then that place penalties on those that would move the landmarks so the system existed for thousands of years amen and so we look at these atop my landmark tonight and the inheritance and the danger is this look the penalty was very severe you understand the cursing and the penalty from whether moving the landmark was very severe so he was the danger that you had to watch out for if I wouldn't to take your landmark and I wanted to move it I'm not gonna get a bulldozer and moving a mile down the road hey man I'm not gonna get it and try to move it all the way down the road if this is your landmark on your property and I want to steal I'm saying man I don't want to get caught you know what I'm gonna do them I go out there I'm going this I'm gonna go I'm gonna go off for a while I like to the grass grows up and all the weeds cover it and you don't know any different and you go out there look one day so it looks like it's the same spot and you go off wrong here comes a thief and he does it again now listen inches turn into feet and after a while featuring in two miles the yards turn the miles is that right after a while this you know 40 50 years because remember this is each generation and before you know you wanted you might have your generation have another thief rise up your sons a thief and they keep doing this and after 40 50 60 years amen the landmark isn't even anywhere where it used to be what it used to look like what's your heritage used to look like and what it looks like today they not even in the same ballpark now listen that didn't happen overnight it was just a little bit of the time just a little bit of the time he moves it a little bit that's what a thief with new lead screws in a little bit at a time you realize when the serpent come in the garden and Teplin he did throughout the whole thing that God said he didn't say oh god don't know what he's talking about God's a big ol liar no I said one thing is it all surely you shall not die just a little bit Oh God knows you shall not surely die hey man he knows that you'll be as gods all right listen it looks so inviting gonna look so subtle it didn't seem sinister at all but what it does it causes death hey man the inheritance of life passed away from every generation born from Adam is that right and then Adam we all died because a wooden three-letter word hey man listen what happened to human worries they forfeited something they were robbed is that right the thief comes to steal kill destroy hey man somebody well praise the Lord that's the truth listen if you had this inheritance and you had this land I hope you said I'm coming with us tonight amen because I'm coming somewhere real quick saying man if you had an inheritance and your daddy left you something in your daddy's that he left you something and you had an inheritance in the land there was only one way to make sure you weren't gonna get robbed you had to go back check the landmark not once a year not once a revival meeting not when it was convenient but you had to go back and check it every week maybe maybe every day is that right listen if you let it go long enough of the grass grows up and all the thorns and the thistles and weeds start descending you don't miss something amen you've got to go back and you've got to check it and you've got to examine it all the time listen it's not enough to go and check it when it's convenient hey man I'm not gonna check it when you feel like it amen you've got to go back and look at that landmark every day maybe if you've got a thief lived next to you especially you've got to make sure it's in the same spot because if it's not you're not the only one getting robbed he'll coming to rob your children he'll coming to rob your peace from your home he'll come and take your joy to come and take your healing from you is that right you see where I'm coming tonight we've got landmarks we've got a better landmark we've got a better system amen we're heirs of God with joint heirs with Christ and this Bibles give us exceeding great and precious promises whereby we are made partakers of the divine nature amen these landmarks these promises your landmark you can read this Bible tonight I don't have to tell you about it you can go home and if you can read you can read for yourself exactly what belongs to you he can read Isaiah 53 so you know with the scribes I'm already healed you can go and read in the Bible he said I'm the Lord that healeth thee I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me listen you've got landmarks tonight it tells you exactly what belongs to you it's laid out for you and your inheritance unless I don't move these promises we're just for our Pentecostal forefathers I believe as every generation afterwards am I belongs to the people of God today we've got inheritance tonight we've got landmarks in the land that tell us what belongs to us amen well I tell you what it's joy unspeakable and full of glory hey man it's the manifestation of the Spirit its authority and power and the children of God hallelujah what praise the Lord it's the truth tonight is that right we've got so much that we possess and what the devil would love to do what he wants to do is that right listen it's just like this country you look at the laws as country's fallen upon and what it is today and it don't look today like what it used to look like it didn't happen overnight it was one little change one little compromise one little thing at a time a woman can walk down the street today that has thrown her in the insane institution 100 years ago for dressing the way she does but today it's acceptable and then you walk down the street with a dress long hair and they looked at you like you're the crazy one it's the truth what happened you didn't happen overnight but somewhere the devil snuck in he's certain moving the landmark just a little bit through Hollywood your popular opinion through men's ideas he moved the landmark a little bad I used to marvel when I when I first got converted and I read the book of Judges that generation had passed since Josh will come in the promised land and they already knew not God and I thought to myself how is this possible how could a generation you're so far away from not what I've seen with my own eyes this country had a prophet I've indicated ministry on the face of the earth but they rejected by the rest of 1956 they rejected this gospel and where are they but 40 50 years later they're plumb on the other side of insanity amen I have to think of myself with the band said they go completely insane if you were sitting in that meeting what would you think might happen brother branham ever what's he meaning completely insane let's try a man Moses just exaggerated wouldn't be completely insane man they don't know a bathroom he is now hey man they can't tell their left him from the right it's the truth brothers and sisters they don't know where they're at what is it they've gone insane the landmarks move so much that's what happens when they let you before our before long you're not even in your original land you're like man what is this I don't remember this being here what's this tree over here about man you're not even in the same land anymore hey man somebody well it's the truth hey man what happened it didn't change overnight this is the devil he doesn't try to come and Rob us overnight and this is why I'm during the street or not because I want you to think about this the devil's not gonna try and Rob us like that tonight because he knows we know better and then he's not gonna come up you see this whole Bible's wrong hey man this whole Bible is just a bunch of nonsense it's a bunch of hogwash and quit believing this Bible that's something he comes to you amen but what he's gonna do is gonna try and move one little landmark at a time one little scripture well you out God is the same yeah Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but just not in this way not in that way we have God used to do those things but he don't do that no more but he's not trying to throw it all on at once we'll get you to move one little scripts at a time and then it move you another scripture and it move you another promise before you know it amen you look at Christian they come to church and they get saved through the Holy Ghost and God the Son in their life but the devil begins to work in their home he works through their circumstances and maybe their family maybe their job whatever be and after a while they begin to lose the things are used to have but be didn't happen overnight but they get to set the plays 20 30 40 years down the line where they don't even look like what it used to look like what happened the devil stole something from you well hallelujah hey man I tell you what I believe in the power of God amen listen we've got landmarks tonight hey listen the Apostle Peter lead on the landmark of the day of Pentecost they said what must we do to be saved he said I'm allowed a landmark for you God give me the keys of the kingdom so here's what you're gonna do repent and be baptized every one of you in the Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost who's the devil up to come and tell you well that was from Batman but Peter wrote on that same landmark no the promise is unto you as to your children and to all who are follow it even as many as the Lord our God now call oh the devil love freed us just to be happy we just go to church we believe God sent a prophet well the devil goes to church the devil knows that God sent a prophet the devil knows the message is true but I want to know have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed hey man my people come and sentiment brother brother you preach on that Holy Ghost flock I said I hope I do I know a lot people need Holy Ghost that's truth anyhow well they got a lot theology tell you what they know a lot about the message that no more about and you didn't they'll make sure to tell you when it comes to going on their inheritance they don't have an idea listen I believe this message and I believe this this Holy Ghost experience because it's real to me that's why I preach that because it means something to me listen I can take you back to time my life you don't people to hear life I was not raised in the message church I wasn't raised a Christian home at all hey man oh my ha ha listen I come out of the bondage of Egypt I know what it's like to feel the sting of the taskmasters whip oh but I think God a couple of young men sir with a certain witnessing to me one day and it wrote a message church hey man and I started going there for a few months but listen I needed something still I realized I was hearing something that was true but what I had was not sufficient pulled the task Amen not mommy and daddy tell me I'm gonna call and they tell me I believe all kinds of weird stuff and there's a girl I liked and she didn't like me and my life was falling to pieces I was trying to make things work hey man but listen I hadn't coming in my inheritance yeah that was me trying to make something happen amen I've come to a place in my life or not a man Jesus all right I come to a place in my life or not I can take you to the spot I was in a field crying one night want to live anymore that was laying there crying said I don't want to live I wish I'd never been born I've tried to live this message I've tried to do the right thing all these months now and I'm more defeated I'm more powerless than I've ever been and I regret my own life I said I just wish I was dead and I begin to pray I said tell you what that was one thing by the grace of God I managed to do I don't know why but I kept it in the pray I said god I hate this life that I have I hate that everything's falling apart I said god I don't even want to live anymore I said gamez rise up from here I'm gonna take my own life but before I do god I wish he'd just come and take it right here right now listen I've heard from God don't tell me y'all don't speak no more I heard from him that night people say God don't do that no more don't move the landmark on me and then God spoke to me as I lay there praying he said if you don't want your life then give it to me he said he'd been rejected by this girl and your hearts been broken but you have rejected me everything that you wanted from her I have tried to be to you your rejection from her does not compare I have tried to be a husband to you all your life and I've reached out to you time and time again and you've turned your back on me you're upset that Mommy and Neffe they think you're in some sort of a call they think all these things about you but I've wanted to be a father to you all this time he said if you don't want your life give it to me and I will take it if I said god I don't win in any way you take this life and I tell you another man gonna bother field that night I testify Mandy died there that night but a little got up off the ground I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me hallelujah you say why do you say all that brother because it's not just a bunch of fanaticism to me it's not just a bunch of emotion to me it is live and I would not be here tonight I would not be alive before the grace of God spoke to me don't tell me God can't still say don't tell me God killed he can't still speak don't tell me not still give them the Holy Ghost I got baptized the next day I called brother Stephen Russell he just got baptized couple weeks prior so I won't get baptized is Wednesday is this alright I said I'm gonna get baptized he said what's great brother we'll send some of the church and we'll call somebody soon all I got to do it today that's just hi I'm like you know I'm gonna do today there's water what doth hinder me he's like who's gonna do it why are you doing well can I do acid I don't know can you so he calls him his deck and I baptized I don't know why not so him and his brother and his daddy showed up and we got to a friend's pool I got a friend he wasn't even a believer him in his mom huh from the back porch watching me get in the pool laughing the whole time laughter his snicker

what he don't get mad you don't get his feelings hurt he don't get mad don't make funny about he's dead let me follow when I'm dead don't move me well it's the truth anyhow let's turn I went there I got baptized and I walked out that pool that day I'm still having a drill hole my clothes all sopping wet hey man the next day 3:45 in the afternoon I can take you to the spot where the holy ghost come down and I knew I let something listen I've been trying to talk the right way I couldn't do it but God changed my language I've been trying to have the right kind of idea of the right kind of suction God made the change listen I didn't knew that I couldn't do that I couldn't produce it I don't know enough psychology I ain't got enough willpower to do that but I know that no one's brought me to a good meal and it brought me tune in heritance and when I come to Atlanta said you know if those promises are good what about the rash every promise in this book is mine listen if you're gonna give me somebody might as well give it all that I certify to you today in the name of Jesus Christ if you never hear another thing for me again this Bible this Word of God is still just as good today these promises are still the same today hey man well it's the truth any man listen the devil love to convince us that's for 4050 years ago he loved to convince you know God can do those things just not for you and he was loved move the landmark in your life just a little bit at a time hey man he loved to take that joy you had that prayer life he used to have that burden prayer and just kind of just kind of make it cool off just a little bit and before you know you don't pray in a locker you so you don't have to Z like you oh you go to church oh you read your Bible oh you still pray for dinner come on somebody Oh fire that burden we had when the Lord first met us what happened that Devil rock you somewhere he does some of the landmarks he started putting things in your life he distract you from the fact that there's grass growing up where there wasn't grass before because there's a landmark that's been moved is that right well praise the Lord he loved to tell you that learning has replaced revelation Amen that you can have an intellectual conception and that replaces having a Holy Ghost he's first he loved nothing more that can be said because listen if he can keep you airy man he kept out of the whole land hey man what's the truth is that right God said the landmark he never didn't move it hey man listen I've seen the United States I've seen Africa I seen it in India it's funny you know you go to India and they've become so intellectual through education and stuff and it's like preaching preaching people in America hey man they're so intellectual they got it all figured out hey man that God can't hardly move cuz they got figured of how I was gonna move already man people that exchanged the supernatural power for God for some intellectual understanding hey man listen I it's not enough for me just to understand this message amen I've got to have it living in me cuz that's the only thing that's even brought me this far I've got to have that fire of God burning in my soul moving me here man I can't be satisfied with a substitute cuz I know where he brought me from already Oh hallelujah tell you what I hope this is all right tonight Amen you look at the lukewarm condition of the churches answer the Bible said it would be is that right we can look at all these things will you look at people that are losing their inheritance we can look at people that once stood for this message and they were walked away we can look at all these things and we've got to make a decision or we're gonna give in to or we're gonna stand on the Word of God just let me tell you when I look at these things and I look at people giving up I look at people falling away that doesn't discourage my face hey man that just gives me one more reason to go hon I said this person don't want to serve God if this person don't want to believe the message I'm gonna believe anyhow you can choose this day which gods you want to serve but as for me and my house we're gonna serve the Lord we're gonna walk in this inheritance this is what I'm gonna make my stand amen amen praise the Lord while I was reading the story that I hope this is all right it's about these two brothers they're identical twins and their father was an alcoholic and he grew up an alcoholic he had these two boys and he died because of that whole ism and one of his sons become an alcoholic as well and one did not become another identical twins but yet ones are not walking one is not hot that's one that becoming alcohol why did you become an alcoholic he said because my father was an alcoholic it wasn't drunkard he said why didn't you become a llama hogs it because my father was an alcoholic hey man listen to people the same thought but a completely different response one saw his father's not always an excuse to become one and once all the need to rise above it a man listen I don't look at these things I don't look at the discouragement and people falling away and say you know what I might as well just give up my mom will just fold no I said you know I'm not gonna allow that to happen a man by the grace of God listen not you it's not my mind it's not my power but by the spirit a man can we let his spirit have Liberty in our lives like when we first got saved or if we got too formal in our ideas have we gotten too dignified in our worship or could he still have the same Liberty that he can have it or laugh like that first night when I got saved amen Oh God can I surrender tonight like I did back there or I let things creep in hey man where the remm talks about this and the sermon all of the hours come times about Jehoshaphat said jehosophat looked at his forefather David and how he served God and the blessing of God was life and looked at Ahab of course you know I have he died even I believe when I was alive and how he disobeyed he didn't he didn't walk after the ways of David he saw one beam blast so one being first and brother message Jehoshaphat he made a decision to walk in the ways of his father David is that right hey man I made a decision to go hey brother man says he made a decision go back to the old landmark that David had said he said God blessed him God will bless anyone who go back to the old landmark of the Bible and start from the Bible not according to theology but or some man-made theology from true Bible theology and start from the old landmark and move up God will move with you I'll tell you what that just that makes me feel pretty good amen to know that if I moved he's gonna move with me amen cuz that's what I'm looking for tonight I'm not looking for me with God I'm looking to be a move of God I'm looking to know that when I move God moves with me as I write I can see the rustling in the mulberry trees the wind blowing through my life and I'm aware that there's a witness of the Spirit that God is doing something to me and I couldn't do not just 10 years ago but tonight in this place but that same God that visited me that spoke to me that preserved my life he's still the same God in my life tonight he's still number one in my life he still can tell me what he wants and I'll say yes Lord amen Lord I don't care what the world says I'm not worried about what other people think I just from me in my house we're still gonna serve the Lord no matter of ten years go by 20 years go by hallelujah well it's the truth amen I tell what some people get discouraged well you know I've been in this message 50 years all right seen God do nothing I mean were you act blind or something well I never done seen miracle come follow me around for about a week I see God do stuff all the time tell you what you get enough God inside me that's all you'll see is gone that's the truth of it right there you want to see God go get enough done on the inside first I don't know what some people thought aha some people ain't got the patience to patience lots of moving they just sit in church and that's done and now our you know God don't do nothing in my life maybe not you but it's for me and God's doing stuff all the time well that's the truth anyhow I just I marvel some people well you know I followed this message 50 years we had a rapture yet well you know I waited 300 years didn't bother him well I've been doing this 290 years long why am I still here you know he walked with God the whole time his all right look he didn't say you know I'm a I'm the break you know that's what they do not isn't he the marriage well we're going to have to her these relations we got to take a break from each other I don't want to break from God I don't live that lie that's horrible look I can't even walk without him holding my hand well sister I'm going way off the grid here now Matt's like I was talking some of the other day I know this this woman I used to work with and she had $50,000 a debt on our first married to getting ready to get married again it's the paint on her first wedding Shh yeah that's crazy that's what they do they go spend as much on for a house there's something to doing these weddings and the last but a year you know what Ezra's telling somebody said this is what is these people are more interested in their wedding than they are their marriage come on let's bring it down the spirit chain man oh we're sucks oh we can't wait till everybody Jesus at the altar and we get born again and when do all these things but who's who's ready for a long-term relationship where's that committed nasai I don't matter of 20 30 40 50 years ago by my relationship with God is not weakened it gets stronger every day I might have been of my heritage for all my life I'm not so Kay I'm gonna keep walking in it I have tasted and I have seen that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth of him I'm not gonna walk a hundred years let the Lord walk with me that's all I ask hey man don't discourage me well that's true amen are you happy tonight listen brother BAM said wouldn't go Matt Jehovah he said when he made that choice he had to put up Garrison's he said that's what we failed to do with the church we've got to garrison the church our homes our lives and by what by the Word of God hey man we've got to take these landmarks and make sure that we're not being robbed amen because if we're not careful with our experiences and our memories and what people tell us shape our thinking for us before you know you've got an idea about what God can and can't do didn't come from God what is it the devil's trying to rob you at something listen the devil's not afraid of you reading this Bible but he's afraid of you live in half he's afraid when he sees a book of Acts in action again that's what he's afraid of tonight that boy sent alive that that was sweetness in humility that's the thunder that shakes the devil a man yeah I'm in prison Lord I tell you why I live my sermon I don't want to just preach it because your thoughts are louder than heaven than your words on the earth I don't just want to lift the right part I want to have it in me I want to be a prisoner a príncipe to Jesus Christ amen look I've been a prisoner of the devil I know that's like a man I want to be a prisoner to Jesus Christ I look at my own life you say you know I'm not satisfied I want to be more yielded tonight I believe there's more of this inheritance and I've even possessed yet I'm not just looking back to what God didn't say thank you God for what you did back there I wish I could go back there and live it again but I'm aware tonight that what God has done for me which I am grateful for her but I'm aware tonight that what he's done for me God can do it sitting abundantly above anything I can ask you they I but God's just started I just scratched the tip of the iceberg and we're just scratching the surface tonight he can do so much more tonight than what we've allowed him to do we've allowed listen stop putting a limiter on it's us you put the chains on God let's take the chains off God tonight let's unshackle the Holy One of Israel let's not limit the Holy One of Israel like they did in the wilderness let's let go of our hi dears let go of our superstitions and our fears no reservations tonight and say you know what God I'm giving everything to you because I'm nothing without you anyway we've got to garrison our lives our churches our homes by this Word of God we've got to be vigilant amen to make sure the landmarks not getting moved around on us listen we take a lot of precautions in the natural to protect ourselves we were seatbelts and we put on you know we put these essential oils on we get these magnetic couches we take vitamins you're the doctor you get life insurance and health insurance insurance for you we do all this stuff to protect her we lock our doors at night someone's got the shotgun anyway and then we've got all kinds of things in the natural hey man if you went home tonight from church and you got home and you found out the windows are busted in and your house is robbed I can guarantee you one day you wouldn't sit there like some people do in church I guess this is this is what the Lord has for her hand oh no you'd be getting on the phone you'd be calling the police you probably call him - no not your own pastor like I've been robbed pastor if you calling the police up you've been making a list you call the insurance company you'd be calling every church to be putting on Facebook you'd be on Instagram everything else and you'd be letting everybody know you've been robbed somebody's come take my stuff from my house and I've been violated I don't feel safe anymore and you let everybody know how wrong you were somebody took your stuff ha ha ha you can't I don't even know I'm gonna live in this house anymore hope if the devil will come in our house and they'll take your prayer life and they'll take your toy you'll take your say he'll think you're good for the word of God and you'll take your peace he'll take their house you'll get your kids out in the world and we sit there going I guess this is just my lot in life I tell you what if I were you I'd be calling somebody I begin a hold of somebody tonight I tell you what if I walked out to my inheritance and I saw somebody I moved it I want me some well I guess it's just worth gonna stay I don't feel like moving her back no I'd be moving back right away hey he said but what if your neighbor finds out he's the bad guy but you know what I understand sometimes it's his word against yours but you know what the scripture give a remedy for that you know that powers chapter 20 verse 10 does remove not do a landmark and they're not in the fields of the fatherless for their Redeemer your goal your Avenger the Redeemer is mighty he shall plead their cause listen if the natural Redeemer was mighty listen if he found out if your brother found out somebody done moved your landmark you know what he day went gird his sword on his waist we walk over your property and so you know what we're putting up with this devil one that we're gonna go and we're gonna take back the land and we're gonna get back everything but the devil stole from us we're not leaving a hook behind we're not giving one inch to the devil we're gonna take it all back maybe you come and take your neighbor's live by the sword because that man who robbed you he was a curse over his life Who am I that's just a natural listen I believe we've got landmarks tonight Moses pronounced a curse amen praise the Lord pronounced a curse on them that moved the landmark but how much more when a man stands in the pulp X he tries to move the landmark of this word and then the Apostle Paul said their curse to another man comes and preacher the gospel that I've preached let him be accursed what is it you've got a redeemer he's mightier than your brother next door he's minor than the police officer down the street or the sheriff you've got a redeemer that's the very creator of heaven but I want it saved your soul and silly with a baptism of the Holy Ghost here's the Avenger and the redeem of your inheritance tonight if you come to your inheritance in you tonight so you know what I feel for the Devils are robbing me somewhere I feel like I'm not living where I'm supposed to live I guess what you don't have to go back and take it by yourself you just call up your redeemer he's mighty to plead your cause I tell you I had to calm it right away Shh I'd be letting Hill you know what I believe something's wrong I want to live in my inheritance amen that natural Redeemer was that mighty how much more this Redeemer it's giving us authority he's given us power is that right whoever says this in perfect faith is could you compare a Christian today with him Christians of long ago how them disciples walked and the power of the Spirit moved by the Holy Ghost just the prisoners I preached the other night a prisoner to the word and will of God he couldn't even move until God moved him is would you like to see a church rise like that he said it's going to it's going back it's got to come it's on the road now I believe let me hope this isn't some presumptuous tonight but I'd like to get except for the night I believe it's here now I believe I'm looking at it tonight hey man I'm not just looking for an invincible army I believe there's members present tonight there's Christians here tonight they've drawn their sword and then put on the whole armour of God they're not here for a picnic they're not here for a walk in the park they're ready for battle this is the greatest battle ever fought and God said you know what you're equal to the task because I've equipped you with my spirit and my word now you've got people to night you've got people tonight even the churches maybe even here tonight and they're not walking in their inheritance where they're supposed to be amen but you know what you're here and Christ is here he's here tonight to help you take back everything let me say everything everything that the devil has taken from you listen he's a squatter it don't belong yeah well praise the Lord hope that's alright tonight no brother I said we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics that's true is that right we could talk a good talk we can talk about this word but where is it at in our life well we know that's what it is we were afraid of what people say about us well then hey just the Holy Roller that's all they are well I'm gonna tell you what the Prophet said he said I ain't never seen a Holy Roller yet hey man well praise the Lord well you're just getting fanatical I don't know about you but I got a reason to praise God I got a reason to rejoice well I can show you by science if you're something a lot of motion is dead is that right if your religion ain't got no motion go go bury it somewhere because it's dead I mean look I'm not saying I'm not interested in a dead religion another shouldn't dead letter tonight I want to see the power that pulsation of the Spirit in my life I believe I have but I want to see it again tonight I want to see the great away when I wake up tomorrow I'm gonna see it again I want to see it after that again and again and again that's how I feel about it I don't believe that it's just gonna write another book of Acts I believe what's going on right now I think that churches here right now but can we believe that man we're always putting that off to somewhere else that's what man does he always looks at what God is going to do and looks back at what God has done and he misses don't miss it tonight I pray look at me anything special about me or you as human beings that's what God has decreed I believe God wants to do something here tonight because it's his will to do it listen God wants to bless you so much more than you want it that's been a real lesson for me in my life God's had to show me time and time again God wants to bless you look I said if you want the Holy Ghost God wants to give up t more than you want it hey man we live so far below our privileges because we think we're being humble we're not we're just being dumb that's what it is but if you know praise the Lord it's actually pride actually what it is we think it's humility but it's actually pride one because we think we know better than God and two because we think we don't need his help well God humble some of us tonight amen hey man I believe to not hate well the prophet of God said that original tree restored that bride she restored is the original tree of life tonight a man I believe is live here tonight I believe everything that Adam lost in the fall has already been restored to this bride amen look he didn't leave nothing off there and then we can have the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ tonight if you can but believe right here tonight not 30 years ago not 40 years ago not 10 years from now if you can believe tonight all things are possible hey man I was just testifying over and in here but I have time and I pray this is all right but that's for all the different things I've seen God do I've seen God open blinded eyes look that's not just a tape service to me I've seen God do it I've seen God raised up cripples you say why are you saying all that the band got nothing do with my ability listen God's been a landmark God's gonna landmark amen I've watched God restore homes I've watched God save alive I watch God open the the deaf ears what was it people coming back to their landmark bill coming back to their inheritance people waking up and realize you know what it's for me that's what the devil does to us it convictions for everybody else but yeah hey man oh God can do that you just can't do it for you let me tell you one thing tonight the devil's the same as it's always been he's a liar he's the father lies and when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own the truth is not abide in him I tell you what that if you ever catch on what the devil says to you you ought to rejoice the devil says you can't make you you ought to praise God you say you know what I must have already made it though says you can't make it you know you're done already mate here listen this end this where I'm coming to this I'm not impressed by the devil I know so many Christians come on some money they don't pressed by the devil will the devil do this the devil did that I'm not shut up by what the devil does traitors he didn't send me and he that's in the world I tell you what some people to get into testifying guy well the Delta get up for 10 minutes and they'll glorify the devil in church will the devil do this for the Bibble to die and the devil the devil the devil where is Jesus no I'm not care about what the deviled eggs are delicate you're nothing to you this is the devil can't touch one hair on your head unless he gets permission from God missa God knows exactly what you need exactly what to bring you through God's not shook up but the trials are your life tonight look we can shook up we get scared I'm going through things brother you don't know what I'm going through tonight I might not know what you're going through but God knows exactly what you're going through and God didn't get blindsided in 2018 that's not shook off God's not wringing his hands in heaven he's not thinking man how am I gonna pull this off God knows exactly what you need God knows exactly how to do it God's not shook up does not panic Inc he's not fretting about it he's laughing at the devil the whole time you laughing double you do always lie and you always fail well come on somebody you've been through things how many's ever been through something their life you know there's just no way it's just no well you're here aren't you you're here tonight but there's landmarks sitting here tonight it's time Testament Orioles what God brought you through you might not have thought mommy might not have thought in the past or might not have thought but yet you're here what was it God did it yeah you don't understand brother my situation it's impossible it might be but with God all things are God's not shook up about it tonight oh he's mighty to plead your cause look he he don't whimper and whine and complain like some of us oh you're addy Marie's mighty to plead your cause hey man look when this elijah coming this day challenge them false spirits you let me t shakaal a child lucky he wasn't hope this works out amen he knew where he stood why cuz he seen God moved before look David was like that wouldn't risk a life he knew God could do listen I'm not standing here not talking about a theory that's how some people preach a man they preached said brother the doctrine of the theory it's what he calls the doctrine of a theory all I can tell you about skills and thunder - this and that but they can't they don't know any more about the Holy Ghost in Casper the ghost this is true then the house wouldn't come down the nitty gritty when you're at the bottom of the barrel and your life's in despair a man there's people here tonight you know exactly what I'm talking about you've been the bit the end of your rope and you know that you know that you know God did something for you and that's why you need to not let me testify that I knew what did something for me nobody else could do you'd probably do it for me he's not a respecter of persons God can do it for you tonight oh it's not you it's not me remember the man said the Jesus Christ had more success in jeffersonville they didn't a seraph that had more success in mind that wasn't brother Brandis and Jesus Christ had more success is that right listen I believe tonight we are the success of Jesus Christ you were the joy listen you weren't the burden you weren't the disappointment you weren't the part of God that was ashamed of you were the joy that was set before him you were the joy that was set before him and he saw you with him enjoy before that look he didn't see defeated before the foundation of the world he saw you shouting he saw you having joy he saw you praising God and that's exactly how he's gonna see you in eternity amen what he saw is what he sees an eye is what he will see amen oh my oh my he said it would take place she will ascend our feet call the musicians forth

very clear tonight we can know a lot about the word but if we don't know the author then the word is powerless but the author is what gives the word power because then you can begin you look and you you see what belongs to you now you know the enemy he's never setting back but as if I think it was clearly trade here tonight how that things can move so so subtly and try to move the landmarks now you know this is a when you look at the things that we have now we don't have rocks in our yard some people will plant a tree they'll plant a bush they'll plant certain things but we have those pins that they put in the ground I mean you look at those pins they put in the ground those things can get bent somebody can pull them up and they can actually pull it up and put it I had that happen to me they pulled it up and put it in a different place and when that happens you know it gets to a place that I could look at that pin where they moved it and I can think wow I have less property but there is a document and that document is on file they might have moved the pin around here but they haven't and cannot alter the document there is one who has authority to read that document only thing I have to do is go and have and make access of that I'll go right down to the county and the county will pull that document right out and it lets me know from this point of your property to this point it's this such and such a many feet this many feet and so many inches I can go right back to there and there is authority then I can enforce what I know rightfully belongs to me you see when you know what belongs to you that's authority you've got a right to enforce it you can mow clear to that line right over there because you know that's mine and you know what that is that's real Liberty that's Liberty you don't have to worry am i encroaching on somebody else's land that's Liberty that's the same way it is within every aspect in every part of our lives the enemy would love to and he likes to try to encroach but tonight how the Holy Spirit has been so clear and spoke to us tonight we have a redeemer we have a redeemer amen you're born and sealed with the Holy Spirit and if you're not you can be that's a landmark that's a promise for you tonight that is the promise that God has given for every generation you believe that and every promise that we that is there for you and I don't let the enemy bring any encroachment upon those these are our promises that God has given to us and the Holy Spirit has come to enforce those claims that we have in him you believe that amen let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight amen is before we're being dismissed you got a need on your heart just let it be known to the Lord Lord Jesus you've spoke so so personal to our hearts in our lives Lord there's not a heart that I would say that is gathered in here tonight those that Lord that would hear it Lord Jesus our hearts are touched Lord what encouragement you give to us through your word to every heart that would be here Lord to hear it to know the Lord you are the same God the promise that you made you're the same God Lord here present to make that promise real to every heart in every life lord I pray tonight Lord for every heart and every hand that Lord is lifted up Lord there's things that Lord Jesus that perhaps that they can look at Lord and see where maybe there's things that have been Lord taken from them like was mentioned through our brother tonight Lord you mentioned about joy you mentioned Lord about the prayer life you mention Lord about healing you mention Lord about so many different areas in so many things Lord and I pray tonight to know that the Holy Spirit Lord you are so personal to where the Lord it's it's personal to each of us that Lord that it's something that can come before a slore to where that we could see Lord if there's in any way that there's any place or God that has been moved in any way and Laura I'm reminded that it's not all together Lord something that we look at that we're doing or not doing sometimes Lord it's simply our attitude is out of line Lord sometimes the Lord it's it's our heart Lord has become filled with other things Lord God in our lives Lord to wear that even as your prophet would speak about how criticism would enter into his own life and he would say and declare I'm determined to blast my heart out and never have a negative fall anymore Lord Jesus you know each and every one of my stone and to you Lord you are our Redeemer Lord Jesus no matter what it is Lord God that the enemy may have tried to move here there I pray tonight Lord God may not warn Lord walk out of this service Lord Jesus Lord with a stone with any pen that's been moved but Lord God may it be so determined and resolute in the heart Lord that father what the promise that you have given every single promise belongs to us Lord as the believer Lord may we have to pull that Lord God may we be vigilant Lord with these things we pray Lord for the word that we've heard tonight Lord and to know that the Holy Spirit is here present Lord to enforce that word we love you Lord Jesus no God our hearts desire Lord Jesus is Lord as was spoke tonight we want to be more yielded to you Lord we want to be more surrendered Lord sometimes lord over time time has a way of hardening but Lord may and your presence Lord God our hearts and our lives be softened Lord the cares of life and other things Lord that want to come Lord to try too hard Lord and desensitize but father how we're thankful Lord God for your spirit Lord Jesus that Lord how you touch our hearts and our lives Lord we want to be sensitive Lord to the pulsation of the Holy Spirit we want to be healed in Lord more yielded Lord to you help us Lord I pray father for one of the great signs Lord of maturity is trusting you Lord is yielding to you lord help us father because of our own self we cannot yield but it must be Lord your power moving upon our lives Lord God that Lord through your safe defying love or God it draws us and calls us us as your wife to yield to you Lord all father granted tonight Lord we pray Lord for each and every heart
