[37:22] hold of you?
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; You know, it's
[37:28] it's one thing for um
[37:31] Brother Brandon gives that example of
[37:34] Sarah and
[37:36] just turn this down just a little bit.
[37:38] Just a tad.
[37:41] Thank you. Um
[37:45] when little member Rebecca went and
[37:47] grabbed she'd be able she was able to
[37:50] beat um Sarah there and got on brother
[37:53] Bram's lap and
[37:56] &gt;&gt; she said I got all of daddy and little
[37:59] Sarah's lip be to quiver and and um
[38:02] brother Brandham motioned to Sarah said
[38:04] come on over here. He pulled her up on
[38:06] his lap and and uh Sarah looked over
[38:09] Rebecca and she said, "Rebecca, my
[38:12] sister, you might have all of daddy, but
[38:15] daddy's got all of me."
[38:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what it really that's what
[38:19] really matters, you know, is that it's
[38:22] not how much of a grip that we have on
[38:25] God, it's how much of a grip that God
[38:27] has on our lives.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's many many around us that
[38:33] um that could maybe explain and my
[38:36] goodness preach circles around us and
[38:38] everything else. But you know what makes
[38:40] the difference is is is God having the
[38:43] first place. Amen. In our lives. Amen.
[38:47] So we'll just dismiss you if you want to
[38:50] help out back there. Um, we
[38:54] I know the brothers out sometimes
[38:55] there's things that happen and um I know
[38:58] there were things that uh I probably
[39:00] give them a lot to go because I like my
[39:02] monitors and uh then they're trying to
[39:04] make adjustments. Sometimes we can't
[39:05] figure out why there's different
[39:06] adjustments been made and things like
[39:08] that. But we we'll get to the bottom of
[39:10] it and I'll just talk until they do and
[39:13] then we'll preach from there. and uh had
[39:15] a had a sound man one time that came in
[39:17] here and um he was helping us out and he
[39:20] couldn't figure out why in the world
[39:21] that I needed monitors or whatever more.
[39:23] And I thought, well, first of all,
[39:25] you're not a preacher. Second of all,
[39:27] you've never sat in one of our services.
[39:29] And uh so, you know, I I kind of like to
[39:32] have a voice when I'm done. And um I've
[39:36] had some of my buddies that want to get
[39:38] me into all that other stuff. I said, I
[39:40] got enough batteries to take care of. I
[39:41] don't need to look like I'm walking out
[39:42] there with six shooters
[39:45] and uh I want I want to hear later on in
[39:47] life. So, um, but anyhow, I want to just
[39:50] kind of give you an update,
[39:56] uh, Sister Irma. And on Sunday, um, you
[40:00] know, it was actually late on Saturday
[40:02] night, early Sunday morning. And, um,
[40:05] when Sister Irma, they, you know, they
[40:07] took her to the emergency room and then
[40:10] we, we went to see her, uh, my wife and
[40:13] I, and had prayer with her on Sunday
[40:16] evening. And it was it was a very
[40:18] serious condition. Uh it was a UTI, but
[40:21] the UTI had went and began to affect all
[40:24] the other organs. She was on a
[40:25] respirator. They had everything. They
[40:27] were taking care of her heart and lungs
[40:30] and and everything. And it was a very
[40:32] very very serious um thing within that.
[40:36] And I don't I'll just be honest, when I
[40:38] when I put out prayer requests, I don't
[40:40] try to withhold anything. I just put out
[40:42] according to what the family or whatever
[40:44] asked me to do. And so, um, but you
[40:47] know, the Lord certainly moved right
[40:49] down. My wife and I, they were actually
[40:51] doing a procedure and doing some things.
[40:53] And my wife and I got in there to, um,
[40:56] into uh, and when we got in there to,
[40:59] um, uh, over here in Yria, um, they did
[41:03] a procedure for her heart and so forth
[41:06] there and then sent her on down the main
[41:07] campus. And, um, we're just thankful for
[41:10] the mercy of the Lord because day by day
[41:13] there's been improvement. uh along. And
[41:15] so today they were supposed to be taking
[41:18] out um uh some of the equipment.
[41:21] Tomorrow, Lord willing, the respirator.
[41:23] So you just continue to keep her in
[41:25] prayer. Um, you know, it's it's
[41:27] incredible how something um as simple as
[41:31] maybe we look at a UTI, and there's a
[41:34] lot of things with UTI that I've come to
[41:36] realize with different ones that
[41:38] sometimes, you know, those things can
[41:40] have such an effect on people to where
[41:42] you actually think they may have
[41:43] dementia and isn't dementia at all. and
[41:45] and some of that, you know, there was a
[41:47] a minister brother I was around and, you
[41:50] know, it was it was something we were
[41:52] starting to notice, you know, and maybe
[41:53] he was up in age, but we were just kind
[41:55] of noticing it. And um and then we begin
[41:58] to see that um of what what kind of had
[42:02] taken place. And so it ended up being
[42:04] just a UTI, but we want to continue to
[42:07] keep her in prayer. And we're just just
[42:09] thankful to the mercy of the Lord. And
[42:12] um I just we stood right there and my
[42:14] wife and I we joined you know hands and
[42:16] we just had prayer uh there for in the
[42:19] hospital and um so we just uh are
[42:21] thankful for God's mercy. You know it
[42:24] certainly behooves us in all things. We
[42:26] always want to be ready to go. We never
[42:28] know when it's time but I said Lord I
[42:30] refuse. I'm not going to let this I I I
[42:33] just I just we we need Sister Irma. We
[42:35] love Sister Irma and and Brother Carlos.
[42:38] We So thank thank the Lord for them. So,
[42:41] um, we want to also, Sister, uh, Marco,
[42:45] you got that text and that came from
[42:46] Sister Miranda. He was supposed to get
[42:48] transferred to Columbus. They were going
[42:50] to put in a permanent pacemaker. And,
[42:53] uh, but the Lord interceded. He didn't
[42:55] even have to have that pacemaker. They,
[42:57] his heart, everything started moving
[42:59] right in the right right line with
[43:01] everything and how it should be. And,
[43:03] and so, we're just thankful to the Lord
[43:04] for that. And I'll tell you what, prayer
[43:07] works. Amen.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Prayer works and um we just are so
[43:12] thankful to God for his mercy. So
[43:14] continue to keep Sister Irma Irma in
[43:16] prayer and um
[43:19] as well as
[43:21] Pardon me here. I'm going to do
[43:23] something. I'm gonna change it to zero.
[43:24] Where you at, Ben?
[43:27] I think
[43:41] Let's go ahead and stand.
[44:01] Okay. So, turn the
[44:14] 12 and read verse 27
[44:20] verse 31. We'll let you have your seats.
[44:30] Now ye are the body of Christ and
[44:33] members in particular. That means with
[44:36] such diversity.
[44:38] And God hath set in the church first
[44:40] apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly
[44:44] teachers, after that miracles, then
[44:47] gifts of healing, helps, governments,
[44:50] diversities of tongues.
[44:53] Are all apostles?
[44:56] Are all prophets? Now notice these
[44:58] questions. Are all teachers? Are all
[45:01] workers of miracles?
[45:04] Have all the gifts of healing? Do all
[45:08] speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
[45:13] Because God has there's such a diversity
[45:16] within God's body. And we looked at this
[45:18] even some time ago within there's
[45:21] differences of administrations,
[45:23] diversities of gifts. And each one, no
[45:26] matter if it is a gift or something that
[45:28] is seen or known, each member, just like
[45:32] in your body, your natural body, each
[45:35] member has a vital part. Now, I I
[45:37] realize there's certain things within
[45:39] our natural body that we're able to live
[45:42] or do without. Sometimes they'll take
[45:44] out maybe the gallbladder and other
[45:46] things, but yet that part has serves a
[45:48] vital part in our body. You can continue
[45:50] to survive, but it serves a vital part
[45:53] within our body within God's God's great
[45:57] economy in the spiritual body. Every
[46:00] part is vital within the body of Jesus
[46:03] Christ. We say it over and over, but
[46:06] it's true. There's no big eyes and no
[46:09] little U's. But sometimes the way things
[46:11] will we can look at things, the way
[46:13] we'll judge things, the way we'll see
[46:14] things, but yet it always comes back to
[46:18] how God actually sees things. And that's
[46:20] where the real victory is for our own
[46:23] lives is just to see how God sees us and
[46:27] the purpose that God has for each of our
[46:29] lives. Because after all, when it's all
[46:32] said and done, that's what it is. We
[46:33] want to be able to say at that time to
[46:36] hear those words, well done, thou good
[46:38] and faithful servant. Brother Bram says
[46:40] it over and over. He says, I wish, he
[46:42] said, there's many things I wish I could
[46:44] have heard him when he was in his
[46:45] earthly journey to speak. He said, but
[46:48] if there's one thing I want to be able
[46:49] to hear him say above all things else is
[46:52] when I stand there that day and he says,
[46:54] "Well done,
[46:56] &gt;&gt; thy good and faithful servant." Those
[46:57] are the words that we're pressing for.
[47:00] So notice this next verse here. but
[47:03] covet earnestly
[47:05] the best gifts. And yet I show unto you
[47:10] a more excellent
[47:12] way.
[47:14] I would like to speak here tonight on
[47:16] this thought on a more excellent way.
[47:20] Let's just pray. Heavenly Father,
[47:24] Lord, how we thank you for your mercies,
[47:26] Lord, once again this evening. We're so
[47:30] thankful, God, just and we look, Lord,
[47:32] in the different reports, Lord, and
[47:35] different ones, Lord, we've, Lord, been
[47:37] holding up in prayer. Father, think of
[47:40] seeing Sister Rita here tonight, Lord.
[47:42] We thank you for your mercies, Lord, and
[47:44] moving on her behalf, bringing her back,
[47:46] Lord, together with us, Lord. And I pray
[47:49] that you'll continue to minister to her
[47:51] body, Lord.
[47:52] Father, as we hold Sister Irma in
[47:54] prayer, Lord, we dear God are asking,
[47:57] Father, may you continue to move, Lord,
[48:00] on our sister's behalf. Lord, I pray,
[48:02] Father, with everything, Lord, just
[48:04] seeing, Lord, the doctors are pleased
[48:06] with seeing, Lord, how things are are
[48:08] functioning, Lord, with the heart, the
[48:10] kidneys, and Lord, they've been watching
[48:12] this for a few days and looking at it,
[48:14] Lord, and things, Lord, are to be
[48:16] removed and her weaned off of different
[48:18] things, Lord. And father we thank you
[48:21] dear God for Lord Jesus the the wisdom
[48:25] and Lord those things which you have
[48:27] given Lord even to that Lord of the
[48:29] doctors and Lord we know that it's the
[48:31] promise that we're we're standing on. We
[48:33] know that Father that God no matter how
[48:36] much equipment that we could be hooked
[48:37] up to if it's our time to go it's our
[48:39] time to go. But Lord Jesus, we believe
[48:42] that we where there's nothing can take
[48:44] us until the purpose of God has been
[48:48] served in our lives, Lord. So, Father, I
[48:51] pray that you'll continue to, Lord, give
[48:53] strength to Sister Irma. Continue to
[48:55] move on her behalf, Lord. We pray,
[48:57] Father, for Marco as well, Lord, that
[48:59] you'll not only continue to move, Lord,

[49:42] Amen.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. As you're
[49:45] being seated,
[49:47] Amen. I want to
[49:49] I want to look here uh tonight at this
[49:52] thought on a more excellent way. And
[49:56] uh actually with just even months and
[49:59] things like that ago, I we were speaking
[50:02] here and I think it might have been on
[50:04] the second or third part within church
[50:07] order and I actually thought that this
[50:09] is the way we were going to go and we
[50:11] pulled up that night and didn't continue
[50:14] on. The Lord Lord had me just to to put
[50:16] this push it back but yet it's actually
[50:18] the greatest priority. some of the
[50:21] things we've looked at is God-given
[50:22] direction, God-giving help, and you
[50:25] know, ministering to our lives. And I
[50:28] just um I thought it was so special even
[50:31] um last week uh you know many times you
[50:34] as I've study and I look over a lot of
[50:36] things. I look over a lot of quotes and
[50:37] scriptures and I have things of
[50:39] different studies. Sometimes I'll have
[50:41] studies that are going on for years and
[50:43] and things like that and just looking
[50:45] and then just waiting and on the spirit
[50:47] of God how the Lord would want to even
[50:49] bring things together. I just love to
[50:51] study the word of God and under his
[50:53] direction and and yet one of the things
[50:55] that even over and over within that of
[50:57] the church order there in 1963 it didn't
[51:00] strike me till I was standing right here
[51:02] in the pullpit and ministering last week
[51:05] of how that the I actually mentioned it
[51:08] here but it was still I was just
[51:10] thinking about it after I left here of
[51:12] how that brother Brandham when he
[51:13] approached that if you ever go back and
[51:15] you listen to it in 1963 with that of
[51:18] with that of church order and if you
[51:19] just think of it this way. When you look
[51:21] at church order, it it's very it's very
[51:23] important. But I also realize that
[51:25] there's sometimes that where sometimes
[51:27] individuals maybe the way they're geared
[51:29] and the way things are in their natur.
[51:31] And I think we always have to be aware
[51:33] and be real with knowing how we're
[51:35] natured. If somebody happens to be maybe
[51:37] have a tendency to be critical or a
[51:39] certain person has a tendency to be, you
[51:41] know, just kind of kra s, they always
[51:44] have to be mindful of our of our makeup
[51:46] and those things and really always
[51:48] submitting it to the Lord. But I look at
[51:50] how that when brother Brandham brought
[51:52] that and I think of with church order,
[51:53] you know, it's much like a lot of
[51:55] maintenance that you have on your car.
[51:58] Every one of us, you know, when it comes
[51:59] time, I know, you know, my myself
[52:01] sometimes I think about I've seen cars
[52:03] on the side of the road that when I look
[52:05] at it and, you know, a tie rod has been
[52:07] busted out and and I remember, you know,
[52:10] my I got on my mind. We had uh we took
[52:12] our took the expedition because that's
[52:14] the only thing everybody can fit in.
[52:15] When we went down there in May for
[52:17] Zach's uh school things and we got down
[52:19] there and man the first night you know
[52:21] how it is sometimes you get over tired
[52:23] with things man the enemy started
[52:25] attacking me on my mind because you know
[52:26] how it is brother Drake we rode down
[52:28] those down going through West Virginia
[52:30] on that on 77 and we do it on the men's
[52:32] meeting and you're going down through
[52:33] there and my mind it started plaguing on
[52:35] my mind of man I hope them tie rods are
[52:38] all right. I hope them things are good.
[52:39] my family's in this car and here I am
[52:41] swinging around these curves, you know,
[52:43] and and everything. But, you know, I
[52:45] just said, Lord, you know, I mean, cuz I
[52:46] I take I take my vehicles, I take them
[52:48] on regular maintenance. I I make sure
[52:50] and a lot of times over there at the
[52:52] Ford garage where I take it, I'll ask
[52:54] those guys when they do my oil change,
[52:56] they do my tire rotation. I don't wait.
[52:58] I want to I want to get it done even
[53:00] before I hit the mark. And I'll ask
[53:01] them, "How are the tie rods?" You might
[53:04] say, "Well, they could tell you
[53:05] anything." They might tell me anything,
[53:06] but I also want to know. I I know those
[53:08] guys and I'll see them out a lot of
[53:10] times in stores and other places as well
[53:12] and uh I don't know them as far as
[53:14] buddies but you know we'll know one
[53:15] another by name and things cuz I've
[53:17] asked them and you know I think that's
[53:18] the thing that within our lives when we
[53:20] look at that where brother Brandham
[53:22] himself with taking that it's to keep
[53:25] things in a place like Paul would speak
[53:27] through Timothy that we might know how
[53:28] to behave ourselves in the house of God.
[53:31] In other words, that our lives, every
[53:33] the maintenance and things when you go
[53:34] on a trip or when you're working in your
[53:36] or you're going somewhere, you don't
[53:37] want to have to worry about what's going
[53:39] on. You want your car to run. You want
[53:41] to get there from point A to point B.
[53:44] And that's really the whole thing. Even
[53:45] when it gets down to church order, it's
[53:47] not all of the, you know, all of the
[53:49] nitty-gritty, but we have to deal
[53:50] sometimes with nitty-gritty, but all of
[53:52] that is for one purpose. that the church
[53:55] might flow, that the spirit of God might
[53:58] be able to move and and operate through
[54:00] our lives. And there's changes at times
[54:02] where there's things that we've seen
[54:04] that even at times over the years,
[54:05] there's times where there's things that
[54:07] uh things would would need changed. And
[54:09] I love how brother Brandham when he came
[54:10] with that in ' 63 there brother Brandham
[54:13] when he approached it and the reason I
[54:15] want to draw your attention he never
[54:17] went through and was telling people or
[54:18] the brethren and all that group that was
[54:20] sitting there you're wrong you've been
[54:22] doing this wrong you shouldn't have been
[54:23] doing this and you were out of order he
[54:26] never you'll never find one place in
[54:28] that tape where brother Bram says that
[54:31] but rather what brother Bram does is
[54:34] admonish them now when I I think of it
[54:37] that when brother Brandham would take
[54:39] that to admonish them. Now it's you know
[54:42] how those took it that up and left the
[54:45] tabernacle that's on them. There was
[54:47] nothing there everything was presented
[54:49] there within love. It was truth that was
[54:52] presented. It was the word. It was even
[54:54] where brother Brandham could say uh
[54:56] regarding everything when someone asked
[54:58] him brother Brandham do you think this
[54:59] is true? Do you think it's genuine as
[55:01] far as the gifts and these things that
[55:03] were taking place? And brother Brandham
[55:04] says I'm no judge. He said I I I can't
[55:06] judge it. He said, "But I'll tell you
[55:07] what we'll do. We'll put the word to it,
[55:09] and the word will actually expose if it
[55:12] is truly of God or not." And so, when
[55:17] you look at what Brother Bannon was
[55:18] actually coming down to, it wasn't that
[55:21] where he was looking at or judging
[55:24] something as far as saying, "Well,
[55:26] everything is happening right on the
[55:27] mark. It's exactly true." knew it was
[55:29] exactly we know there was a lot of
[55:31] different things even throughout time
[55:33] but where brother Brandon was was coming
[55:34] to when you what you seen when the word
[55:37] was actually brought to the situation
[55:40] you watch the absol
[55:48] one of us can be guilty of you know man
[55:50] you know acting out of character or what
[55:52] are more and and so you know there's
[55:54] there there's allowances for those
[55:56] things even though brother Bram says
[55:58] according to when over and over in in
[56:00] the message where he'll say if if when
[56:02] you're correcting a gift or you're
[56:04] correcting someone or something takes
[56:06] place and they get all you know off
[56:08] color and everything else and brother
[56:10] Ram says you know it wasn't the spirit
[56:12] of God but even let's just say that if
[56:14] someone would then what you would look
[56:16] for is to see is there truly a
[56:19] repentance within their heart as far as
[56:22] it comes out that you know what I'm
[56:24] sorry I forgive me for acting that way.
[56:26] If the spirit of God is in your heart,
[56:29] listen friends, you cannot override and
[56:31] just put things out to the side. You
[56:34] absolutely the spirit of God will move
[56:36] and direct you to get right. And if you
[56:39] don't, it will continue to torment you.
[56:41] This is where things sometimes I'm not
[56:43] saying that everybody persons that deal
[56:45] with anxiety and this and that is
[56:47] because they got things that's not
[56:48] right. I'm not saying that at all. But I
[56:50] will say this, sometimes there's things
[56:52] that can lay hidden in a person's life
[56:54] or things that they have not made right
[56:56] that they should make right. And this so
[56:58] in order for what purpose? Not to
[57:00] vindicate anybody else, but that the
[57:02] spirit of God might have the right away
[57:05] in their own lives. Because God can
[57:07] never deal with us until we come back to
[57:09] acknowledge and admit that we're wrong.
[57:12] But you know, when I think of it with
[57:14] within this here of really what becomes
[57:17] the basis when we look at things of a
[57:20] more excellent way and you recognize
[57:23] that when we're reading and referring to
[57:25] this here of what Paul would deal with
[57:27] and he would speak to the the church and
[57:30] and admonish them to desire or covet
[57:33] earnestly the best gifts and yet show I
[57:37] unto you a more excellent way. And so
[57:41] within that, that word way itself, it's
[57:43] a road or it's a place that's traveled,
[57:46] a journey. And it's really comes down to
[57:48] really being a course of conduct, a a
[57:51] manner or a way of thinking, feeling,
[57:54] and deciding. And so Paul would would
[57:57] lay this out that there is there is a
[57:59] more excellent way. There is an approach
[58:01] to all of these things in God. And you
[58:04] know, Satan is always Satan always wants
[58:07] to try to take away from what is really
[58:10] the full goal that God has for for our
[58:13] lives. Satan can hand out like brother
[58:15] Bram says, he can hand out the gifts and
[58:17] supernatural gifts by the handfuls. He
[58:20] can do that to where that a person can
[58:23] become to such a place of relying upon
[58:25] the supernatural of supernatural and no
[58:28] doubt many supernatural things could
[58:30] work in their life. But that
[58:31] supernatural working in their life is no
[58:34] vindication that they are a true
[58:36] spiritfilled born-again child of God.
[58:39] There's only one vindication and that is
[58:42] the word of God. And the word of God is
[58:44] not just doctrine. It's the person. It's
[58:47] the character. He said, "I am the truth,
[58:49] the life, and the way." And so when
[58:52] Paul, there's no doubt that when he
[58:54] would reference this and speak to this
[58:56] among the among the Corinthians and how
[58:58] that they themselves were so taken with
[59:01] the supernatural that they were seeing
[59:03] in their midst. Remember how brother Ram
[59:04] tells us he said that many times just
[59:07] like it was with Peter when people
[59:08] become all excited and enthused when the
[59:11] supernatural is among them. That's
[59:12] that's that's human. That's human parts
[59:14] about us that I love to see. I love to
[59:17] see God move. I love to see the
[59:19] supernatural. Is that right? I love to
[59:22] see that. I love and and yet realizing
[59:24] that how every service and everything is
[59:26] different. I hear how brother Brandham
[59:28] will talk about with Ruth and the
[59:29] handfuls of purpose and he'll say this
[59:31] in the kinsman redeemer. Oh Lord, let it
[59:34] be every once in a while you'll drop a
[59:36] little handful of purpose among us,
[59:38] healing the sick, doing this just to let
[59:40] us know that you're with us. So you know
[59:44] all of that God knows how to encourage
[59:46] us along the way. And yet here Paul
[59:49] would write of this uh trying to direct
[59:52] the attention of the Corinthian
[59:54] believers to what would actually be a
[59:56] more excellent way or what should
[59:58] actually be the goal or the aim of what
[1:00:00] we're looking for. This is how it says
[1:00:02] in the amplified. It says, "But
[1:00:04] earnestly desire and zealously
[1:00:07] cultivate the greatest and best gifts
[1:00:10] and graces, the higher gifts and the
[1:00:13] choices graces." And yet I will show you
[1:00:15] a more excellent way. One that is better
[1:00:18] by far and the highest of them all,
[1:00:21] love. This is why brother Brandham could
[1:00:23] say it over and over and over and
[1:00:26] countless number of quotes of how that
[1:00:28] brother Brandham would say it. If he had
[1:00:30] the choice, brother Brandham, I William
[1:00:33] Brandham, I'll give you all of these
[1:00:35] gifts or I will give you divine love. He
[1:00:37] said, I wouldn't even have to think
[1:00:39] twice about it. Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; I would ask God for divine love because
[1:00:44] after all what's going in the rapture is
[1:00:47] divine love.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; That's it's not about how gifted a
[1:00:51] person is, how super how much
[1:00:53] supernatural. Listen, there's a lot of
[1:00:55] supernatural that takes place not just
[1:00:57] in and around this message. There's a
[1:00:59] lot of supernatural that's worked among
[1:01:01] a lot of other individuals. So, it isn't
[1:01:03] that we, you know, how Satan wants to
[1:01:05] do, Satan wants to take things like that
[1:01:07] and then try to put scarecrows up and
[1:01:09] and people no longer want to want to
[1:01:11] give heed to the supernatural. Oh my, I
[1:01:13] I don't want that. You know, people can
[1:01:14] get off in meetings. Well, this is why
[1:01:16] that everything should be judged. This
[1:01:19] is why we have the word. We don't have
[1:01:21] to put things under locks and put them
[1:01:24] in closets and lock it up. But it does
[1:01:27] have to be judged by the word because
[1:01:30] the only sure ground that we have of
[1:01:32] standing is the word of God. Our
[1:01:35] feelings will fail us. And you know that
[1:01:37] there's a lot of times we've had
[1:01:38] feelings go a certain way and our
[1:01:40] feelings was so wrong. We felt this or
[1:01:42] this person doesn't like me or this or
[1:01:44] that. And you come to find out that was
[1:01:46] just your own conclusions that you've
[1:01:48] drawn and you were wrong. That's good.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; But you know within this there there is
[1:01:54] when we look at it there's actually only
[1:01:58] one plum line. Now a plum line itself
[1:02:01] many as builders and things and and they
[1:02:03] still use the plum line. The plum line
[1:02:05] is not like that of just looking on a
[1:02:08] horizontal but the plum line is where
[1:02:11] they begin to look at a wall and wanting
[1:02:14] to make sure when they're starting off
[1:02:15] on that wall that that wall is
[1:02:17] vertically lined up. Because if it's not
[1:02:20] vertically lined up when it's when it's
[1:02:22] just a little bit off the ground, if
[1:02:25] they don't keep checking that little by
[1:02:27] little that wall can start to lean. So
[1:02:30] the plum line and God spoke of that all
[1:02:32] the way through the scripture. God spoke
[1:02:34] about putting a plum line over Jerusalem
[1:02:36] and God because you know it's for us in
[1:02:40] our lives. We can we can we can speak
[1:02:42] and and deal with well, you know, of
[1:02:45] trying to get the horizontal lined up.
[1:02:46] But you know what will affect the real
[1:02:49] lining up of the horizontal is the
[1:02:51] vertical. Is when we're lined up with
[1:02:53] God, then the Bible said all these other
[1:02:56] things will be added unto us.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; But it's when we start trying to line up
[1:03:00] the horizontal. It's the same way in our
[1:03:02] homes. It's the same way in the church.
[1:03:03] It's the same way with everything else.
[1:03:05] If you try to start lining up the
[1:03:07] horizontal, you're operating in the
[1:03:09] wrong way. It's get the vertical lined
[1:03:11] up and then from the vertical the
[1:03:13] horizontal it'll take care of itself.
[1:03:15] Now there's checks and things sure that
[1:03:17] we have to make but this is why that
[1:03:19] within it it's our lives. It isn't about
[1:03:22] trying to get somebody else. It's our
[1:03:24] lives and God's desire is that the
[1:03:26] church would be so lined up with the
[1:03:28] word of God to Christ. The spirit of God
[1:03:31] would have such preeminence to just flow
[1:03:34] through our lives. Now think of this
[1:03:36] here in the scriptures in 1 Corinthians
[1:03:38] 13. Paul would write write in here and
[1:03:42] speak to these believers in this time.
[1:03:44] And he would speak to them regarding
[1:03:46] though I speak with tongues of men and
[1:03:48] angels and have not charity and become a
[1:03:51] sounding brass or a tingling symbol. And
[1:03:54] though I have the gift of prophecy and
[1:03:57] understand all mysteries and all
[1:03:59] knowledge, and though I have all faith
[1:04:02] so that I could remove mountains and
[1:04:03] have not charity, I'm nothing. And
[1:04:06] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[1:04:09] poor, and though I give my body to be
[1:04:11] burned and have not charity, it profitth
[1:04:14] me nothing.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Now, charity, we understand this charity
[1:04:19] is God's own love. God is love. It's
[1:04:22] God's own life. So all of these things
[1:04:26] Paul is speaking to them of the
[1:04:28] Corinthians and letting them know that
[1:04:30] even when it comes to where they're
[1:04:32] speaking in tongues, every one of these
[1:04:34] things are supernatural happenings. I
[1:04:37] mean, think of how it's worded in the
[1:04:39] New Testament. How many times do you
[1:04:41] read in the New Testament where it
[1:04:43] records somebody having great faith and
[1:04:46] the Holy Ghost hadn't even been given
[1:04:48] yet?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Right, woman? You've had great faith.
[1:04:51] You've had great faith. You've had great
[1:04:53] faith. And yet somehow it how the enemy
[1:04:56] wants to would love to so bring the
[1:04:58] distraction and the focus of that oh
[1:05:01] this has great faith but Paul even
[1:05:03] speced it here because showing that
[1:05:05] there would be those that have such
[1:05:07] great faith to move mountains such signs
[1:05:10] such wonders they there's just something
[1:05:12] about them. They just how that they're
[1:05:14] built up how that they're made to in
[1:05:16] order to have great faith. How many
[1:05:18] remember is brother Random talking about
[1:05:19] the statue of a perfect man? And he says
[1:05:21] there's men, there's some people that
[1:05:23] are born with these attributes. They are
[1:05:26] the natural, the earthly. He said, but
[1:05:28] what we're talking about in the statue
[1:05:30] of a perfect man is that which is
[1:05:32] spirit. So it's incredible to me. It's
[1:05:35] incredible how that the spirit of God
[1:05:37] can move down just as it would be upon
[1:05:39] tongues where someone would actually
[1:05:42] speak in tongues and then the
[1:05:43] interpretation be given. And remember,
[1:05:45] it was one of the things that stumped
[1:05:47] brother Brandham when he was in
[1:05:48] Mishawaka because when he stood there,
[1:05:51] he seen one and how that everything was
[1:05:54] working just exactly. The tongues, the
[1:05:57] interpretation, everything was right on
[1:05:59] the mark. And yet when he stood to to
[1:06:02] greet those men, one of those men was
[1:06:04] genuine as genuine could be. And then
[1:06:07] the next one that came by, this man was
[1:06:10] married yet living with another woman.
[1:06:12] He it was such it is the way his life
[1:06:14] was living. It wasn't a clean life. And
[1:06:17] yet there was the spirit of God that
[1:06:19] would move down through that man's life.
[1:06:21] It but what it showed was it shows that
[1:06:24] that that that those things happening
[1:06:27] are no sign of a spiritfilled born again
[1:06:30] Christian.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That's why the spirit of God can fall.
[1:06:34] But notice within it so many times how
[1:06:36] when things could take place and well
[1:06:38] I've seen this one and I I've seen this
[1:06:40] done or I've seen this and so many times
[1:06:42] it can be we've you know we've watched
[1:06:44] it we've seen things around our message
[1:06:46] you know for years we heard it you know
[1:06:48] this one raised up it's an eighth day
[1:06:50] messenger this one here and and these
[1:06:52] are things and you know what God permits
[1:06:54] all that that's what Paul spoke in in
[1:06:56] Corinthians there's got to be heresies
[1:06:58] among you there's got to be things come
[1:07:00] among you that those that are genuine
[1:07:03] might be proved moved out as well too.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul said. And then you can
[1:07:07] have things to where that you know it
[1:07:09] begins to chase after this and and chase
[1:07:12] after this. But you know what? I'm so
[1:07:14] thankful that you know it ain't anywhere
[1:07:16] that we've got to move but except deeper
[1:07:18] in Christ. And there's a real living God
[1:07:21] that we could have a real experience
[1:07:23] with. In other words, God does not want
[1:07:26] anybody to be made in his place of
[1:07:29] worship. And oh, if this man or this
[1:07:31] individual could just pray for me or
[1:07:33] this person, God wants us to have faith
[1:07:36] within his word and to recognize he's
[1:07:39] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:07:42] And if we'll be yielded, God can work
[1:07:44] and move just according to how our faith
[1:07:47] will be released in him. But you see,
[1:07:49] within these things, Paul is dealing
[1:07:51] with them in the Corinthian church. My
[1:07:54] what an incredible thing to be able to
[1:07:56] deal with people that have seen not only
[1:07:58] the supernatural, but they're
[1:08:00] experiencing it. It would take such
[1:08:02] humility in their hearts to submit to
[1:08:05] the word of God that was coming forward
[1:08:08] through Paul so that they did not stand
[1:08:11] there on a gift or how they how God had
[1:08:14] used them and challenged the word of
[1:08:16] God. I don't know what all of them did,
[1:08:17] but I do know this that those that
[1:08:19] submitted their hearts to the word of
[1:08:21] God, I know that those that's wrote in
[1:08:24] in second Corinthians, and I know we'll
[1:08:26] meet them on the other side because they
[1:08:28] continued on with the word of God. But
[1:08:31] notice how that the supernatural because
[1:08:33] it know it's it's always something of a
[1:08:36] uh you know it can be so mesmerizing to
[1:08:38] us to think my that that would be
[1:08:40] somewhat of an evidence and that would
[1:08:42] be somewhat an evidence and my somebody
[1:08:44] having great faith or like Paul wrote
[1:08:46] here a gift of prophecy or even to be
[1:08:49] able to take the word and just lay it
[1:08:51] you know quote and scripture and
[1:08:53] everything else. Listen Satan Satan does
[1:08:55] not take a backseat in gifts. As a
[1:08:57] matter of fact, brother Brandham tells
[1:08:59] us in the church age book, Judas
[1:09:01] Escariat had a ministry second to none.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Nobody could outreach Judas. As a matter
[1:09:07] of fact, he was a better preacher than
[1:09:09] all of them.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? What what does that
[1:09:13] mean? Does that does is these things
[1:09:15] that God would deal with? Was he trying
[1:09:17] to put questions within the Corinthians?
[1:09:20] Not at all. But what God is working with
[1:09:22] them on is to let them see, do not rest
[1:09:26] your salvation. Don't rest your
[1:09:28] experience upon any of these things.
[1:09:31] It's got to be divine love.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing going in the
[1:09:35] rapture is perfect love.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Now notice within all of this,
[1:09:41] everything that could be done, such I
[1:09:43] mean my such sacrifice, but yet if it's
[1:09:46] not done with charity, you know, it's
[1:09:48] kind of like putting things on a scale.
[1:09:50] You could put things on a scale, but
[1:09:52] yet, you know, within it, it can look
[1:09:54] the same size. I could have two two
[1:09:56] things up here, maybe two two different
[1:09:58] sizes of maybe one's a bowling ball and
[1:10:00] and one's another ball like you'd get at
[1:10:02] the supermarket. But what if they were
[1:10:04] both the same color? What if they both
[1:10:06] looked alike? What would actually tell
[1:10:09] which one was a bowling ball? The
[1:10:12] density. You see, this is where many
[1:10:15] times when it comes down to it, the more
[1:10:17] excellent way, there's got to be
[1:10:19] something deeper than just what's out
[1:10:21] here. It's got to be something deeper
[1:10:24] than just a gift. It's got to be
[1:10:26] something more than just a supernatural.
[1:10:29] It's got to be something so deep. What
[1:10:31] What were we talking about? The love of
[1:10:33] God. It's got to be the love of God that
[1:10:36] will always be directed to the word of
[1:10:39] God.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. That's the
[1:10:42] more excellent way.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Now, think of this when you look at it
[1:10:47] because many of these gifts, think of
[1:10:49] it, gifts of healing, gifts of healing,
[1:10:51] many of them that we look through, all
[1:10:52] the even all of these six other gifts,
[1:10:55] gifts of healing, word of wisdom, word
[1:10:57] of knowledge. Listen, friends, there's
[1:10:59] individuals that can be so dead wrong as
[1:11:01] far as within their own being, and yet
[1:11:04] God, there can be something come right
[1:11:06] around and they can tell you what you
[1:11:08] were just thinking.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Now, what are you going to do? where you
[1:11:11] go, oh, oh, that person has a gift of
[1:11:13] discernment. Are you going to follow
[1:11:14] them?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; You see, everything needs to be tried
[1:11:20] and proven.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, what are we going to what we what
[1:11:24] are we going to do? But you see, there's
[1:11:25] got to be something deeper on the
[1:11:28] inside. But you see what Satan does, he
[1:11:31] can take things and he wants to make a
[1:11:32] mockery out of it. He'll take things,
[1:11:34] well, I know I know so and so, I I we we
[1:11:37] don't need no more of that. We don't we
[1:11:38] don't need any more of you know of
[1:11:40] prayer lines. We don't need of pray of
[1:11:42] of gifts. We don't need any more of
[1:11:44] that. Well, listen. Just because some
[1:11:45] things were wrong and went the wrong way
[1:11:48] does not mean that we get rid of them.
[1:11:50] What it means is is what happened is we
[1:11:53] stop judging it by the word and we
[1:11:56] started judging it based on feelings.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's so good. I want you
[1:12:06] to think here in this moment. See, we're
[1:12:08] living in such a time in an hour.
[1:12:10] There's things that, you know, to be
[1:12:12] able to see and to just witness and see
[1:12:15] things and let it be tried and let it be
[1:12:18] proven by the word of God. I I want it
[1:12:20] to be proven. I I don't want to just be
[1:12:21] swept away and following every little
[1:12:24] thing that comes along and and praise
[1:12:26] God, this is the real move. And then no,
[1:12:27] no, I want to see it in the word of God.
[1:12:30] And you know, one of the things that we
[1:12:31] look at, I just don't want to see I
[1:12:33] don't want to see just miracles and
[1:12:34] things happen. I want to see the
[1:12:36] attitude and what's behind it.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Is Jesus Christ being lifted up or is it
[1:12:44] just the person lifting up? Well, I did
[1:12:47] this and I prayed for so and so and I
[1:12:49] did this and I did this and I and I and
[1:12:51] I and I and I. We don't want that. We
[1:12:55] don't need that.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; There's only one big one among us and
[1:12:58] that's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now remember when Jesus here
[1:13:04] he would refer to this in Matthew 7 uh
[1:13:07] 21-23 and talk about how there'll be
[1:13:10] many that will come to me in that day
[1:13:12] and say have I not prophesied in thy
[1:13:15] name? Have I not cast out you know
[1:13:17] devils? Have I not seen have have I not
[1:13:20] in in thy name done many mighty
[1:13:22] wonderful works? And he said I profess
[1:13:24] to them I never knew you. Depart from me
[1:13:27] you workers of iniquity. And brother Ram
[1:13:29] goes on to say it like this. He said,
[1:13:31] "Jesus does not deny that they did the
[1:13:34] mighty works that only the Holy Ghost
[1:13:37] can accomplish by way of men." But he
[1:13:42] did deny ever knowing them. Now, this
[1:13:44] was key. He never denied them doing
[1:13:47] mighty works. He never said, "You lied.
[1:13:49] You never preached in my name. You never
[1:13:51] cast out devils. You never healed the
[1:13:53] sick." He never said that. But what he
[1:13:55] said, "I never knew you." because it was
[1:13:59] the Holy Spirit present working through
[1:14:02] individuals. But the individuals, as the
[1:14:04] prophet said, they he said, "These men
[1:14:06] weren't backsliders. They were wicked,
[1:14:08] unregenerate, reprobates. They were the
[1:14:11] seed of Satan."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Ah, this some strong words, isn't it?
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Hello. I
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; I think we I think we believe this
[1:14:20] message.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Notice Brother Ram says there it is. You
[1:14:24] can't claim that manifestation is the
[1:14:27] evidence of being spirit born or
[1:14:31] spiritfilled.
[1:14:33] I will admit that true manifestation is
[1:14:36] the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing
[1:14:39] mighty acts but it is not the evidence
[1:14:42] of the individual being spiritfilled
[1:14:45] even though that individual has an
[1:14:47] abundance of those manifestations.
[1:14:50] So what is it that shows? It shows it's
[1:14:53] the Holy Spirit there present doing
[1:14:56] that. But it is no vindication of the
[1:14:59] person.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; The only proof that we have is the
[1:15:03] acceptance. And beloved, remember how
[1:15:05] brother Raml says as soon as you begin
[1:15:07] to touch them in their doctrine, you can
[1:15:09] begin to touch them and say, "Wait a
[1:15:10] minute here. You said this, but Brother
[1:15:12] Ram says this over here." Brother
[1:15:14] Brandham mentions this over here. And
[1:15:15] you're saying this, but Brother Brandham
[1:15:17] says this over here. Brother Bram says,
[1:15:18] "What you'll find is is when you start
[1:15:20] to corner them on the word, they will
[1:15:23] fall back on the same argument." We get
[1:15:26] results, don't we?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I would rather be lined up with the word
[1:15:34] of God.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; My heart lined up.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Then there would be all sorts of of
[1:15:39] miracles and everything else and and
[1:15:41] testimonies. I thank God for the
[1:15:43] testimonies. Thank God for what he's
[1:15:45] done right here in our midst. But I
[1:15:47] would rather be lined up with faith in
[1:15:50] God's word and submitted to him for his
[1:15:53] leadership.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; The evidence, Brother Bram says, of
[1:15:58] receiving the Holy Ghost today is just
[1:16:01] the same as it was back in the day of
[1:16:03] our Lord. It is receiving the word of
[1:16:06] truth for the day in which you live.
[1:16:08] Jesus never did stress the importance of
[1:16:11] the works as he did the word. He knew
[1:16:13] that if people got the word, the works
[1:16:16] would follow. That's the Bible.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice the scripture tells us when
[1:16:22] he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he
[1:16:25] will lead and guide us into all truth.
[1:16:28] For he shall not speak of himself. See
[1:16:30] what the Holy Spirit has done and works
[1:16:33] through an individual. He's not there to
[1:16:35] puff that individual up.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; You see, you see that? See, the spirit
[1:16:38] of God doesn't work with him that way. A
[1:16:40] man can get off of that. Remember,
[1:16:42] brother Brand tells us God can use a man
[1:16:44] and if that man goes in such a way where
[1:16:46] he begins to think a little bit more
[1:16:48] about himself, God will just pull right
[1:16:50] back. He's not going to share his glory
[1:16:52] with no one. Brother Ram tells us like
[1:16:54] this in 1964 identified Christ. He said
[1:16:57] even the flesh of Jesus Christ could not
[1:17:01] glory in his presence because it was not
[1:17:05] the son. That's a scripture. And the son
[1:17:07] in himself can do nothing. But what he
[1:17:11] seeth the father doing that doeth the
[1:17:13] son likewise.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now when you think of
[1:17:18] this this this of the love of God, I
[1:17:21] hope you're seeing what we're looking at
[1:17:23] here something to where it goes behind
[1:17:25] the scenes. What is it that's down on
[1:17:28] the inside? What is it that's back
[1:17:30] there? Now listen, don't go around and
[1:17:31] well, you know, this one seemed a little
[1:17:33] prideful. This a little prideful. Let me
[1:17:35] just tell you, as I said before,
[1:17:37] everything will manifest within its time
[1:17:39] and in its season. What's important is
[1:17:42] is our hearts, our lives stay lined up
[1:17:45] with God. Cuz sometimes God will allow
[1:17:47] us to see something that's off going a
[1:17:49] little stray here and God will test us
[1:17:52] to see what is our attitudes towards it.
[1:17:55] Because the prophet tells us, if a man
[1:17:57] is right in his heart with God, he might
[1:17:59] be wrong in his doctrine, but if he's
[1:18:01] right in his heart, the spirit of God
[1:18:03] will straighten him out.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; That's where that's where my confidence
[1:18:08] lies within that. I think of that for my
[1:18:11] own life. For he shall not speak of
[1:18:13] himself, but whatsoever he shall hear,
[1:18:16] that shall he speak, and he will show
[1:18:18] you things to come. Watch how Brother
[1:18:21] Brandon would would say this, you know,
[1:18:23] because we want to be correct. I, you
[1:18:26] know, it's not I want to be right. I
[1:18:27] want to be correct. If I'm wrong, I want
[1:18:29] to be correct.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to just I'm not just
[1:18:32] talking about gifts, friends. I'm
[1:18:34] talking about thoughts, feelings,
[1:18:37] attitude, every part of our life, we
[1:18:40] want it to be in subjection to the word
[1:18:42] of God. I want it to pass under the
[1:18:44] judgment rod of God. Because there's a
[1:18:47] lot of things that you and I can have a
[1:18:49] right and say, "Well, I've got a right
[1:18:51] to have an attitude. I've got a right to
[1:18:53] have this, but I want it to pass under
[1:18:55] God's judgment because I don't want
[1:18:58] anything down there on the inside." Like
[1:19:01] David would even say, "Lord, don't even
[1:19:03] let there be any pre presumptuous sin.
[1:19:06] Search me, Lord. Any prideful, any
[1:19:09] something that is down there to where it
[1:19:11] might be ever so hidden." But the spirit
[1:19:14] of God is able to move right down and
[1:19:16] say, "Wait a minute here. You're not
[1:19:17] looking at the right way at your
[1:19:19] brother, your sister. You're looking
[1:19:20] down on them."
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; We want the spirit of God to to just
[1:19:26] zero in over our lives.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; This is why brother Brandon would come
[1:19:30] around. I love this statement in the
[1:19:32] message of prisoner. He said, "Don't
[1:19:34] judge your life by how much power you
[1:19:37] have to perform miracles."
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We don't judge oursel by
[1:19:43] how much knowledge you have of the word.
[1:19:46] So here's two parts. How much power it
[1:19:48] is to perform miracles. How much
[1:19:50] knowledge uh you have of the word. But
[1:19:52] always judge yourself. Look back and
[1:19:57] take inventory of what kind of fruit
[1:20:00] that the life you presently live now is
[1:20:03] bearing.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Fruit don't lie.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And notice what brother Ram said. Look
[1:20:08] back. take a take a look back and see
[1:20:11] what kind of fruit is coming. This is
[1:20:14] the one time that we're permitted to
[1:20:15] look back is to look over our life. It's
[1:20:18] actually examining our life. What fruit
[1:20:20] is actually coming out of our life? Is
[1:20:24] is there fruit are we becoming? I mean,
[1:20:26] my goodness, if we're nearing the
[1:20:28] capstone of divine love, we surely
[1:20:31] cannot becoming more judgmental of
[1:20:33] people. We surely cannot becoming more
[1:20:36] critical. We surely cannot becoming less
[1:20:38] patient and intolerable and criticizing.
[1:20:41] Surely to goodness that is not the
[1:20:44] effects of getting closer to the
[1:20:46] headstone to the rapture.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That cannot be. It shows it's not
[1:20:52] progressing the way it should be because
[1:20:55] when it's progressing, the capstone
[1:20:57] itself is that of God's own love setting
[1:21:01] down upon the church of the living God.
[1:21:05] Friends, it doesn't come to a place to
[1:21:07] make us more indifferent and selfish. As
[1:21:10] a matter of fact, the capstone coming
[1:21:12] down is actually signifying the
[1:21:15] achievement of a life that is yielded to
[1:21:18] God.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Notice Brother Ram would say it like
[1:21:28] this because you see many times we want
[1:21:31] to see what are we reflecting. Brother
[1:21:33] Ram talks about further on in this
[1:21:35] message about that little boy. You know,
[1:21:37] he'd never seen a mirror before and
[1:21:39] finally he looks and he realizes, hey,
[1:21:42] that's me in that mirror.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; That's me. And brother Bra begins to
[1:21:46] tell us about, you know, it matters on
[1:21:48] how we're identified. You know, we could
[1:21:51] say, well, I I would have been
[1:21:52] identified with Noah. I I would have
[1:21:54] been identified with Moses. But you see,
[1:21:56] if we're not identified with Christ in
[1:21:58] this day, we wouldn't have been
[1:21:59] identified with Noah back there. And to
[1:22:02] be identified with them was not just to
[1:22:04] stand around where they were at. It was
[1:22:06] to actually become one with that message
[1:22:08] that they were ministering and that that
[1:22:11] word would have preeminence in their
[1:22:13] life. There was a measure of God's
[1:22:15] spirit that was given to them down
[1:22:17] through the ages to that of the of the
[1:22:20] true the true elect of God. Remember
[1:22:22] when Caleb, the testimony that God spoke
[1:22:25] concerning Caleb, the reason Caleb stood
[1:22:27] as he stood, God says it in numbers says
[1:22:30] it in Joshua. He had a different spirit.
[1:22:34] He followed me holy with his heart.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; It was different. It was it was a
[1:22:41] different spirit. So God would give a
[1:22:43] measure. And this is why the prophet
[1:22:45] would turn right around in speaking
[1:22:48] these things about being identified. And
[1:22:50] he makes this statement here in the
[1:22:51] message. Jesus called the Christ and
[1:22:53] said, "What group would you have been
[1:22:56] identified when Paul was correcting
[1:22:58] those Corinthians back there?"
[1:23:01] What group would you have been
[1:23:02] identified when Paul was bringing
[1:23:04] correction among the Corinthians?
[1:23:07] Well, it shows. It shows. It shows
[1:23:10] because it shows right now. It shows in
[1:23:12] our lives right now. We It isn't about,
[1:23:14] oh, if Brother Brandon was here, I'd be
[1:23:16] the most sweetest and gentlest. It don't
[1:23:18] change.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Just no more than the rapture changes
[1:23:22] you.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Oh, if it would have
[1:23:25] been the Lord Jesus, he's still here.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, if it would have been Paul, oh my, I
[1:23:31] I would have said, "Yes, Paul. Uh,
[1:23:33] forgive me for my ignorance." No.
[1:23:35] Whatever we do now, because listen,
[1:23:38] people die, but spirits don't die.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Men, righteous men have lived and passed
[1:23:45] on to their reward. But the Holy Spirit
[1:23:47] continues on to produce the same kind of
[1:23:51] life in surrender vessels once again.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to say, Lord, I'm
[1:23:59] taking sides with you.
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Friends, this is is very serious. when
[1:24:06] Paul would write this and because the
[1:24:08] Corinthian church was so taken and they
[1:24:11] they they Paul he would not have
[1:24:13] mentioned it if the spirit of God would
[1:24:16] not have dealt with his heart to help to
[1:24:18] to begin to see they're resting on
[1:24:21] certain things that they need to
[1:24:23] understand don't rest on these things
[1:24:26] the place of rest and the first priority
[1:24:29] in our life is divine love
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; is the Holy Ghost
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; listen Friends, it doesn't matter. You
[1:24:37] may never speak in tongues.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; You might never preach. You might never
[1:24:41] do anything. But listen, don't ever
[1:24:44] underestimate the life that is filled
[1:24:47] with the spirit of God that leads you
[1:24:49] with a passion for the word of God to
[1:24:51] obey the word of God to press beyond
[1:24:54] your flesh. Press beyond your
[1:24:56] circumstances. You want to see a real
[1:24:58] miracle? It's when you press beyond your
[1:25:00] own human flesh and you bring your own
[1:25:03] life in subjection to the word of God.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; But there's got to be something that
[1:25:13] takes place, something that happens
[1:25:15] there on the inside, not re relying upon
[1:25:19] anything else. Paul was not taking
[1:25:21] tongues away. He was not taking prophesy
[1:25:24] away. He was not taking away gifts of
[1:25:26] healing, but he was trying to get them
[1:25:27] to see, don't rest on those things for
[1:25:32] your salvation or as a vindication,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; that God is with you.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; There's only one proof and that's being
[1:25:41] accepted in the beloved.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; That's where Christ's own life is
[1:25:45] identified through you and me. This is
[1:25:47] why brother Bram says you take he said
[1:25:50] you take that he said of where someone's
[1:25:52] speaking in tonesues and still cutting
[1:25:54] their hair speaking in tonesues and
[1:25:56] going out here wearing short acting
[1:25:57] ungodly and their character and
[1:26:00] everything else and he says yet after
[1:26:02] that's taken place where they spoke in
[1:26:04] tonesues prophesied some supernatural
[1:26:06] thing and you try to tell them that they
[1:26:09] don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; because what are they resting on they're
[1:26:14] resting on a supernatural act that the
[1:26:17] Holy Spirit did through their lives.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; But there's only one place of certainty,
[1:26:24] only one place of rest, and that's in
[1:26:26] the word of God.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you something. God
[1:26:30] might use a person once and never use
[1:26:32] them again.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm not going in a rapture
[1:26:38] because I preach.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I could sit down, I'll go in the
[1:26:41] rapture,
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hello. Well, I I mean, I can pull a
[1:26:44] quote on that, but I'm not doing you're
[1:26:46] not you're not we're not doing that.
[1:26:48] You're not listen, even by coming to the
[1:26:50] house of God. It isn't because you come,
[1:26:52] well, I'm going in the rapture. But I'll
[1:26:53] tell you what, if your desire is to be
[1:26:55] gathered together, and the prophet said,
[1:26:57] if the love of God's in your heart, you
[1:27:00] can't wait for those church doors to
[1:27:02] open.
[1:27:04] Yes, sir.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget, you know, and my dad
[1:27:07] shared this story when he was in council
[1:27:09] one time and there was a husband and
[1:27:10] wife and here they were and you know, he
[1:27:12] just shared and where it was at and it
[1:27:14] just shows you when the word is made
[1:27:16] flesh, you realize it's not humanity,
[1:27:18] it's spirits, it's spirits even that get
[1:27:20] upon people that want to stand in
[1:27:22] opposition, people don't even realize
[1:27:24] it. All right.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; But when that was quoted to these
[1:27:27] individuals that were just laying out of
[1:27:29] church and once in a while popping into
[1:27:31] church, the funny thing about it is is
[1:27:34] that the sister said, "I know Brother
[1:27:36] Brandham said that and when he said it,
[1:27:38] it don't make me mad, but when you say
[1:27:39] it, it makes me mad."
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; You know what the difference is? The
[1:27:43] word is standing in flesh before you.
[1:27:45] The word is calling out your error. You
[1:27:48] can leave it when it's on play and and
[1:27:50] fast forward it and hear it there on on
[1:27:52] on the message, but if you're really in
[1:27:54] tune with God, you'll be able to hear it
[1:27:56] right through the message.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. It's going to take the
[1:28:01] love of God. Come on. In rapture.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the truth.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; This is why that brother Ram goes on to
[1:28:06] say it isn't saying this. That isn't the
[1:28:08] answer of you know many spoken tongues
[1:28:10] that they didn't have anything. They
[1:28:12] shouted and they didn't have anything.
[1:28:17] Well, brother Samuel, I want you to pray
[1:28:18] for me that God will let me shout.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:28:25] you laugh, but I've been asked that.
[1:28:30] Not here.
[1:28:32] But I'm not doing that because you see,
[1:28:35] you might shout once and never shout
[1:28:36] again.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; But that deserves a greater diagnosis.
[1:28:41] We believe in shouting. Anybody be
[1:28:42] around here, you could tell. But
[1:28:45] shouting is no evidence.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; It's not what we strive for.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; I've said this over and over. Nobody has
[1:28:53] to tell me after eating turkey on
[1:28:55] Thanksgiving, go in there and fall
[1:28:57] asleep in the recliner. It happens.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; It happens. Nobody has to tell me that.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Right? Nobody has to tell me after you
[1:29:08] get done eating enough salsa and chips
[1:29:10] and and cheese sauce, go drink a 5gallon
[1:29:13] bucket of water. It's going to happen
[1:29:15] because what I've been partaking of is
[1:29:18] requiring that out of me.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. We're
[1:29:22] shouting and and running and everything
[1:29:24] else. We believe in all that, but it is
[1:29:26] brought from and it's a right objective.
[1:29:29] It's brought from the joy of the Lord in
[1:29:31] our heart where we have met God's
[1:29:33] requirements and the spirit of God is
[1:29:36] anchored in our lives.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; That's why when brother Brandham
[1:29:43] remember he said if I if I taught
[1:29:44] certain things I'd have people running
[1:29:46] after that. But he said I've got to set
[1:29:48] before him the giver not the gifts.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:29:53] Now, this is why brother Ram says, "Not
[1:29:55] any fleshly demonstration or emotion,
[1:29:58] but something has happened in here
[1:30:00] that's changed your whole opinion,
[1:30:04] changed your whole nature. You are
[1:30:06] converted. Christ has come into you and
[1:30:10] converted you. Your nature's dead of the
[1:30:13] old man and you're born again. You're a
[1:30:16] new man.
[1:30:19] Old things are passed away.
[1:30:21] There's a genuine
[1:30:24] desire and the passion. The objective is
[1:30:26] is for Christ and Christ alone. It's
[1:30:30] where he comes in and he changes our
[1:30:32] opinions, changes our idea. You know,
[1:30:34] God and God proves all of his own work.
[1:30:36] Sometimes sometimes sometimes even for
[1:30:39] lives where the spirit of God look this
[1:30:41] is why when brother Brandham told us
[1:30:43] about with Paul, he said Paul went in
[1:30:45] the desert for that period of time. He
[1:30:49] already had an experience, but he went
[1:30:51] in that desert. Brother Ram says it over
[1:30:52] and over in the Hebrew series. Says it
[1:30:54] over and over many other places, but he
[1:30:56] wanted to see his experience in the
[1:30:58] word.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; He wanted to see it that it matched with
[1:31:02] the word of God.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And when he could see it match with the
[1:31:05] word of God,
[1:31:07] he submitted to it.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? This is why that you
[1:31:11] see when God has given sometimes a
[1:31:12] person can can struggle for a period of
[1:31:14] time even within their lives and and yet
[1:31:17] God has brought such a change in their
[1:31:18] life to where the the love of God has
[1:31:21] come in and the things of the world has
[1:31:23] passed away and there's a there's a love
[1:31:25] for the things of God and as and as it
[1:31:27] will continue to grow. It's like brother
[1:31:28] Brandham likens it to a husband wife. He
[1:31:31] said I love my life my wife more now
[1:31:34] than I did before. And he said that's
[1:31:36] how it is when a person is converted.
[1:31:38] You love the Lord Jesus more now than
[1:31:42] you did before.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; It's a journey. It's a process. It's not
[1:31:47] all of a sudden boom everything, but it
[1:31:49] is a birth on the inside where there's a
[1:31:52] complete a change that takes place and
[1:31:55] it works its way to the outside.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; This is where when Paul would write now
[1:32:00] abideth faith, hope, charity, these
[1:32:02] three, but the greatest of these is
[1:32:05] charity.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:11] How many believe that?
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Thank God. We We need faith.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; You have and you need faith and we need
[1:32:19] hope. We don't do away with hope, but
[1:32:21] hope's right in the middle between faith
[1:32:24] and charity.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Because a person can have all kinds of
[1:32:29] faith and yet not be faithful.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's kind of blows
[1:32:36] our mind almost. How could a person have
[1:32:37] all kinds of faith for healing, for
[1:32:39] other things, and yet not faithful?
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; It just goes to show you how things can
[1:32:45] be gifted,
[1:32:47] but when it all comes down to it, it's
[1:32:50] God rewarding the faithful that which
[1:32:52] his faith is operating in our lives.
[1:32:56] The greatest of these is charity, is
[1:32:58] love. You see what love does? Love takes
[1:33:01] a hold of faith. It's love that actually
[1:33:04] produces faith. Faith don't produce
[1:33:05] love. Love produces faith.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith, right? And when faith,
[1:33:09] what does faith do? It gives you a hope,
[1:33:11] an expectation.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Faith gives you something to look for.
[1:33:15] Even when you don't know what's the next
[1:33:17] step, you get a doctor's report, you're
[1:33:19] praying, you're looking to the Lord. We
[1:33:20] don't you don't have you don't have a
[1:33:22] promise that says, "Well, within the
[1:33:23] next minute, you're going to be well, or
[1:33:25] the next five minutes or the next day or
[1:33:26] whatever." But love will stand there and
[1:33:29] says, "I don't care what anything else
[1:33:31] says. I'm holding to God's word."
[1:33:34] Hallelujah. That love will stand there
[1:33:36] with a patience
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; and it'll take control of faith. Well,
[1:33:41] I'm claiming my loved one. They might be
[1:33:43] going this way, but I don't care what I
[1:33:45] see this way. I know what God's word
[1:33:47] said that they and their offspring shall
[1:33:50] be there with them.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; We're standing on that word.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; That's what love will do. In love is
[1:33:57] faithful to the word of God.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; This is why I want you to listen. I'm
[1:34:02] just going to read it. I'm not going to
[1:34:03] put on the screen, but just listen this.
[1:34:04] Brother Bram talks about how he says to
[1:34:06] think he said in this hour, this is out
[1:34:08] of 1948, the angel of God, just listen
[1:34:10] this. He says the next thing to happen,
[1:34:12] this is 1948, is the restoration of the
[1:34:15] gifts to the church.
[1:34:19] Now it's 1948.
[1:34:21] 1906 was Isuza Street.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; There was restoration of the gift. So
[1:34:27] what's Brother Bram talking about here?
[1:34:29] the and then he said it's the hardest
[1:34:31] thing I've had to do in this pioneering
[1:34:34] work. He said is that God cannot give
[1:34:38] back the gifts to the church as long as
[1:34:41] his church is divided. We've got to get
[1:34:44] the church together before the gifts can
[1:34:47] come. Now the gifts were already here.
[1:34:49] So it's evident that the prophet is
[1:34:51] speaking about the divine order of these
[1:34:55] gifts
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; because he goes on to admonish and said,
[1:34:59] "Oh Christian people, bind yourselves
[1:35:02] together with one heart and one accord.
[1:35:05] For God can no more send the gifts to
[1:35:07] the church while the church is separated
[1:35:10] than he can send the Holy Ghost unless
[1:35:11] we're in one accord. For it comes by the
[1:35:14] Holy Ghost."
[1:35:16] You see, it takes something. Listen to
[1:35:18] me now. It takes being able to see
[1:35:22] something,
[1:35:23] someone,
[1:35:25] and that someone is the Lord Jesus. A
[1:35:27] purpose, a cause that is bigger than
[1:35:31] self.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Bigger than our opinions, bigger than
[1:35:36] ideas. We're going to have our opinions.
[1:35:37] We're going to have our ideas bigger
[1:35:38] than our feeling. You're going to have
[1:35:39] your feelings,
[1:35:41] but has got to where is our focus at?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; It the focus has got to be on him. a
[1:35:47] real vision of the Lord Jesus. Now, I
[1:35:50] want you to think of this here in unity
[1:35:53] when the prophet is calling for this and
[1:35:55] and speaking of how this is what was
[1:35:58] needed
[1:36:00] in order for God to really place the
[1:36:02] gifts back in the church
[1:36:04] is unity.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; That's there's unity that God re
[1:36:09] requires in home life. There's unity
[1:36:12] that God requires among us as an
[1:36:15] assembly. And I want to just say this to
[1:36:17] you friends that unity itself, it comes
[1:36:20] first from giving ourselves
[1:36:23] to that real vision of Jesus Christ to
[1:36:26] giving ourselves to him. You see, God
[1:36:29] coming right down through a service and
[1:36:31] services. There's things he'll deal with
[1:36:34] our lives. He'll deal something. He may
[1:36:36] say something to brother Aaron or with
[1:36:38] Drake or brother Richie, brother Roco.
[1:36:41] the way God will move and it may not
[1:36:42] only be something that's set out audibly
[1:36:44] and all of a sudden Paul will catch
[1:36:45] something, brother Bill catch something,
[1:36:47] different ones, sisters and all and what
[1:36:48] it is God dealing personally with our
[1:36:51] life and what why would God do it in
[1:36:54] such a way is so that our lives given to
[1:36:56] the to the Lord and how that God is
[1:36:58] calling from our lives then it's us
[1:37:01] unifying with the word and then the
[1:37:03] result is if we're unifying with him
[1:37:05] it's going to show up with one another.
[1:37:07] Yes.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not us trying to get
[1:37:10] everybody in line. Let's get all the
[1:37:11] ducks in a row and let's get That's like
[1:37:14] trying to put a bunch of kindergarteners
[1:37:15] in a line.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Been there and did that for two weeks
[1:37:19] after I graduated from Bowling Green. I
[1:37:21] realized I'm glad I didn't get that
[1:37:23] certification. I love little kids. I
[1:37:26] love little kids. I love them, man. But
[1:37:29] I I realized, you know, when I went for
[1:37:31] as far as for teaching, I guess if I had
[1:37:33] to do it for a job, God would have gave
[1:37:34] me the grace to do it. But I realize I
[1:37:36] wasn't gifted for that. But you know,
[1:37:38] God ain't trying to line us up like
[1:37:40] that. He wants to line us up with his
[1:37:42] word. And if we get lined up with his
[1:37:44] word, everything else will come through
[1:37:48] that yielding to him. It makes it so
[1:37:51] much easier to yield on the horizontal.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Before the Holy Ghost
[1:37:59] ever came, the Bible said, this was
[1:38:01] after his ascension. The Bible said when
[1:38:04] they went up to the upper room, they all
[1:38:05] continued with one accord,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; In prayer and supplication. This is
[1:38:09] where the Holy Ghost came.
[1:38:12] That's before the Holy Ghost,
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Samuel, it's
[1:38:16] going to take the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:38:17] unity." It will take the spirit of God
[1:38:19] to bring the unity that God is calling
[1:38:22] for.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But it's going to take hearts that want
[1:38:26] to give themselves to that unity and see
[1:38:29] that purpose and give themselves to God.
[1:38:32] Yes.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; In other words, the spirit of God is not
[1:38:35] going to come where there's disunityity.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; He won't do it.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; This is why in the start of Acts chapter
[1:38:45] 2 verse one, when the day of Pentecost
[1:38:47] was fully come, they were all with one
[1:38:49] accord in one place. What a miracle.
[1:38:53] Come on. There was some of them that
[1:38:54] gathered up there. They had their egos.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, am I going to be the good one? Am
[1:38:59] I going to be the one that's, you know,
[1:39:00] the most requested minister? Am I going
[1:39:02] to be this and I'm going to be this? And
[1:39:03] I
[1:39:04] They had all they had all this among
[1:39:06] them. I mean, these people were as
[1:39:08] different as could be.
[1:39:11] What a representation of you and I.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care how big or how small an
[1:39:17] assembly is. It's made up of a diversity
[1:39:20] of people.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; We are as different as night and day in
[1:39:26] our flesh, in our makeups.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, friends. We all have our
[1:39:32] own ideas. We all have our own opinions.
[1:39:36] We all have our own feelings. I'm not
[1:39:38] faulting I'm not faulting you. You can't
[1:39:40] fault me for my ideas, my feelings, my
[1:39:42] opinions. Of course, that's not what I'm
[1:39:44] going to preach. But we're not here to
[1:39:46] to try to get rid of or cast out ideas,
[1:39:49] opinions, or feelings. But what it is,
[1:39:51] what's the great victory? Is where we
[1:39:53] can so submit our lives and lay our
[1:39:56] differences aside.
[1:39:58] That takes work.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That takes work. It takes work in a
[1:40:05] marriage to lay differences aside. We
[1:40:07] could draw trenches. We could mark
[1:40:09] lines. We could dig in. We could It take
[1:40:12] that takes effort, too. But oh, it's
[1:40:15] just like the frowning on our face. It
[1:40:17] takes more muscles to frown than it does
[1:40:19] to smile.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, friends? See, God
[1:40:23] takes the simple things to instruct you
[1:40:25] and I. But what is it? Sometimes we get
[1:40:27] so into the place and the point of our
[1:40:30] idea, our feeling. But oh, I pray to
[1:40:33] God, let the Holy Ghost be lifted up.
[1:40:35] Let the Christ be lifted up. Let Jesus
[1:40:38] Christ be exalted.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz let me tell you what'll happen when
[1:40:43] the spirit of God and lives begin to say
[1:40:45] yes to the word of God. Begin to let
[1:40:47] begin to let things go. You say, "Well,
[1:40:49] I'm going to I'm going to wait for a
[1:40:50] preacher to bring that." You've got a
[1:40:52] decision to make.
[1:40:54] Every one of us have a decision to make.
[1:40:56] You have a decision. Either you're going
[1:40:58] to unify with the spirit of God and let
[1:41:01] things go and let things down or you're
[1:41:03] going to sit in disunityity. You and I
[1:41:05] have a choice.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; But I want to I'd like to be like that
[1:41:11] of where Brother Brandham talked about
[1:41:13] the fences and the ducks were in the
[1:41:15] fences.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Remember what brother Brandham said?
[1:41:18] Well, what solved the problem wasn't
[1:41:20] getting wire cutters and going and
[1:41:21] cutting fences. telling this brother
[1:41:23] he's wrong and this one you're wrong and
[1:41:25] you're wrong. You shouldn't do this and
[1:41:26] you shouldn't do that and you shouldn't
[1:41:28] do this. God's called me to correct all
[1:41:29] the all all the preachers in the
[1:41:31] message. God's called God ain't called
[1:41:32] no such thing.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; No such thing. There ain't no big one.
[1:41:37] There ain't no big one. There's some
[1:41:38] wonderful wonderful brothers, some real
[1:41:41] gifted brothers that I thank God for.
[1:41:43] But I also thank God when I look at a
[1:41:44] real gift, I want to see humility in
[1:41:46] their life.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's what we want
[1:41:50] to see in one another's lives. the
[1:41:52] things. Those are things that I think
[1:41:53] that we could we could just pull back,
[1:41:55] you know, on things because that's what
[1:41:57] we want to see is humility. But notice
[1:41:59] it wasn't cutting the fences. It was the
[1:42:01] water level. When the water level rose,
[1:42:04] you couldn't even see the fences.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; That that that's what's needed. But you
[1:42:08] know what will take for the water level
[1:42:11] to rise? Unity.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; They were all with one accord. They were
[1:42:17] already in this
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; before the Holy Ghost came.
[1:42:22] That's why the Holy Ghost came. It was
[1:42:23] the promise of God. But you know what
[1:42:25] brought them to that? They saw the
[1:42:27] vindicated word. They had walked with
[1:42:29] it, talked with it, and heard the
[1:42:31] promise that the word made concerning
[1:42:33] their lives.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; And they so became so taken with that
[1:42:37] promise that they were with, think of
[1:42:39] this, a paradox in a room without the
[1:42:41] Holy Ghost was able to lay aside their
[1:42:44] differences
[1:42:46] in that room.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you know what that shows? If they
[1:42:50] could do that by looking at the promise
[1:42:52] of God before the Holy Ghost come, how
[1:42:54] much greater is it when the Holy Ghost
[1:42:56] does come?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Will it mean that there is not
[1:43:00] differences? Just read the book of Acts.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; There was all kinds of differences,
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; right? There was contentions. There was
[1:43:08] things. Why? Cuz God showed this
[1:43:10] humanity part would still be right there
[1:43:12] within the church. But what would
[1:43:14] prevail is divine love.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; So they were in one accord. It's like
[1:43:18] it's like that of sheet music. You know,
[1:43:20] when you think about one accord, it's
[1:43:22] it's where how that the writer would
[1:43:24] write of it in this way that it's a
[1:43:26] compound. This word one accord is a
[1:43:29] compound of rush along and unison. It's
[1:43:31] an image that is almost musical. A
[1:43:34] number of notes are sounded which while
[1:43:38] different harmonize in pitch and tone.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if you could take these
[1:43:46] same notes right here of this song? on
[1:43:48] Amazing Grace.
[1:43:50] And if they were all messed around the
[1:43:52] wrong way, it wouldn't be how sweet the
[1:43:54] sound.
[1:43:56] It wouldn't be a sweet sound, right?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Right. It wouldn't even be Amazing
[1:44:00] Grace. It might be the same notes that
[1:44:02] are right here within this first stanza
[1:44:04] or whatever you would call it. It might
[1:44:06] be the right notes that you need, but
[1:44:08] they've got to be willing. This this
[1:44:10] over here, this note has to be willing
[1:44:13] to say, "Okay, I'll take my position
[1:44:15] right here." That eighth note has to
[1:44:17] say, "Okay, I'll take mine right there."
[1:44:19] Not demanding position.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; But in order for unity,
[1:44:25] it has to be willing to surrender for
[1:44:29] the betterment of the whole.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what when we talk about
[1:44:32] having a real vision of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:35] Christ, how can you have a real vision
[1:44:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ and not have
[1:44:39] honor for his body? Sure.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Because after all, that's what he's
[1:44:43] veiled in is his body. Even in this
[1:44:45] time, let me just let me just bring it
[1:44:47] on down here just just a little bit here
[1:44:49] tonight. I want you to think of this
[1:44:51] here within within the scriptures where
[1:44:54] how that Paul would bring some an ad
[1:44:56] admonition to the Romans of unity. I
[1:44:59] don't know if you've ever ever studied
[1:45:01] this before, but I've looked at this
[1:45:02] many times over the years and how that
[1:45:04] Paul would work and work and minister to
[1:45:06] each one of these different churches.
[1:45:08] And notice how that he'll say this in
[1:45:10] Romans. Now the God of patience and
[1:45:13] consolation
[1:45:15] grant you to be likeminded one toward
[1:45:17] another according to Christ Jesus. It'll
[1:45:20] take patience.
[1:45:23] It'll take the comfort of the Holy
[1:45:25] Spirit. God reminding us how far he's
[1:45:26] brought us along.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; It'll take that. It'll take patience for
[1:45:31] us to be able to hold on and wait for
[1:45:33] seeing Christ in one another. That ye
[1:45:35] may be with one mind and one mouth.
[1:45:38] glorify God, even the father of our Lord
[1:45:40] Jesus Christ. Ephesians 4:1, I
[1:45:43] therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
[1:45:45] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:45:48] vocation or the feast where you've been
[1:45:50] called to with all loneliness and
[1:45:53] meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing
[1:45:56] one another in love, endeavoring to keep
[1:46:00] the unity of the spirit in the bond of
[1:46:03] peace. This word endeavoring is being
[1:46:05] diligent. It's almost like a military
[1:46:07] endeavor
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; where you take account of just like it's
[1:46:12] simple in your home. You begin to
[1:46:14] realize when's the right time to say
[1:46:16] something and when's not. It isn't that
[1:46:18] you got to walk on eggshells. You just
[1:46:20] you you're making a choice for that
[1:46:22] evening. Do you want to have a pleasant
[1:46:24] evening
[1:46:26] or do you want to dig in? I'm not
[1:46:28] talking about to the plate either. I'm
[1:46:29] talking about into the trenches and you
[1:46:31] know starting you know here we are. We
[1:46:33] have choices. We have to endeavor. We We
[1:46:36] need God's wisdom. Listen, friends,
[1:46:38] surely to goodness, if Paul would write
[1:46:40] this. It isn't something that you and I
[1:46:43] are to to pursue in terms of, well, I
[1:46:46] need to be more forbearing. That's true.
[1:46:47] I need to be more long-suffering. But
[1:46:49] where where do those attributes come
[1:46:51] from? It comes from having more of God.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; It's it's not just chasing out here.
[1:46:56] Well, I'm going to be more patient.
[1:46:58] Sure, God will deal with our lives to be
[1:47:00] more patient. Yeah, more long-suffering.
[1:47:02] But all of that points to one thing.
[1:47:04] Lord, I need more of you.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; I I I need a fresh refilling of the
[1:47:09] spirit of God. Cuz you know what,
[1:47:10] friends? Let's just be honest here.
[1:47:12] There's going to be things where people
[1:47:14] have disappointed us, we've disappointed
[1:47:16] them. There's things even God will allow
[1:47:18] to come by our way that will test us
[1:47:22] whether or not we have patience or not.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Sometimes God will allow
[1:47:27] character and certain things to be seen.
[1:47:29] And we'll we'll look at certain things
[1:47:31] and you got to be careful cuz you can
[1:47:33] look at something and say, "Ah, there
[1:47:34] ain't nothing to that individual." But
[1:47:36] you got to be patient because there can
[1:47:38] be a real work that takes place on the
[1:47:40] inside. But God works to bring such a
[1:47:43] submission and teaching them in their
[1:47:45] character to submit their lives unto
[1:47:47] him.
[1:47:50] It takes it takes the love of God.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Endeavoring to keep the unity. If
[1:47:57] there's one thing we want to endeavor
[1:47:58] with and that that's that Lord I want to
[1:48:00] endeavor. Watch how brother Brown will
[1:48:01] say this in a prayer in the message
[1:48:04] dedication.
[1:48:06] He says, "Father, bless this little
[1:48:08] church. Keep the buildings up and may
[1:48:10] the worshippers gather here time after
[1:48:12] time every service. May there be such a
[1:48:14] love of God among them till they just
[1:48:16] can't stay apart from each other. Their
[1:48:20] hearts long to come together to the
[1:48:23] house of God."
[1:48:25] Brother Ram goes on to talk about how
[1:48:27] the Holy Spirit that he would take the
[1:48:29] right place within our lives. May they
[1:48:31] be so salty as you've said. You are the
[1:48:33] salt of the earth. May their lives be so
[1:48:36] rich and wholesome in the Holy Spirit
[1:48:38] until all the community around about to
[1:48:40] long that will long to be like them.
[1:48:42] Grant it, Lord. Make them examples. And
[1:48:45] then brother Bram goes on to say this.
[1:48:47] When our services are all over here on
[1:48:50] earth, may we undividedly
[1:48:53] hued in our own ways
[1:48:57] that God has made us
[1:49:00] gathered together in that great church
[1:49:01] called the bride. And she'll be caught
[1:49:04] up from this earthly tabernacle of
[1:49:05] habitation here. And she'll be changed
[1:49:08] in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye,
[1:49:10] and she'll be raptured together with him
[1:49:13] to meet him in the air to the wedding
[1:49:15] supper of the Lord, of the lamb. Notice
[1:49:18] Brother Ram's prayer, that first little
[1:49:20] bit right through there. May there be
[1:49:22] such a love of God among them till they
[1:49:23] just can't stay apart from each other. a
[1:49:26] longing to be with one another.
[1:49:30] A longing to be I never forget we were
[1:49:32] years ago we were looking at you know
[1:49:35] certain model of a home or whatever more
[1:49:37] and and I I wanted a certain layout and
[1:49:39] things like that and they were telling
[1:49:40] me oh we can we can build we can build
[1:49:42] this come over here. I said I'm not
[1:49:43] interested in square foot. I'm not
[1:49:46] interested in square foot. I said I've
[1:49:47] seen homes that sometimes square footage
[1:49:49] and they say this but I'm not interested
[1:49:52] in that. I know what I want. I want I
[1:49:55] want something to where people where
[1:49:56] they get it's open. We went over there,
[1:49:59] you know, you still go over and years
[1:50:01] years ago and they look at look at this
[1:50:03] and I said, "Explain this to me." I
[1:50:05] said, "I've been downstairs."
[1:50:09] And I said, "There's a little room for a
[1:50:11] dining room.
[1:50:13] A little room. I mean, you can hardly
[1:50:15] get the chairs out. And then you got
[1:50:17] this kitchen. Then you got this room
[1:50:20] here. But when I got upstairs, how come
[1:50:22] all the bedrooms are huge?
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, not just big for a king-size
[1:50:28] bed, but they got room to sit with a
[1:50:31] couch and you've got this all done up.
[1:50:32] And I said, "Pardon me, but it looks
[1:50:34] like people that live here hate one
[1:50:36] another."
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't nobody's house. It was a
[1:50:40] model. You understand?
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And that woman just looked at me said,
[1:50:42] "Oh, I see what it is with you. You're a
[1:50:44] communal." I said, "I don't know. I
[1:50:46] maybe that if that's what you say I am."
[1:50:47] I said, "But I know one thing. I ain't
[1:50:49] spending my life in a bedroom. I like
[1:50:51] being together with my family. I like
[1:50:53] being together with friends. I like
[1:50:55] getting together. I'm not I'm not
[1:50:56] looking to where I can just come down,
[1:50:58] duck down, get something out of the
[1:51:00] fridge, and go back and vegetate and be
[1:51:02] away from everybody else.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, listen. That's the same
[1:51:08] way that it is right here among us.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; It's something it's a check part. Oh,
[1:51:13] that don't mean that much. It does mean
[1:51:15] that much. Think about when the rapture
[1:51:17] takes place. that isn't all of a sudden
[1:51:19] going to change us. And my goodness, I I
[1:51:22] I enjoy being around one another. If you
[1:51:24] don't enjoy being around God's people
[1:51:26] right now, you need to check your heart
[1:51:28] out
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; because it in this Listen, friends, we
[1:51:32] could rub one another. But if you don't
[1:51:34] got enough God in your life to look
[1:51:36] beyond somebody's flesh, you need more
[1:51:38] of God in your life. You need a fresh
[1:51:41] refilling of the Holy Ghost because you
[1:51:44] and me both have shortcomings in our
[1:51:47] life. Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:51:50] My Lord, where did that come from?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to think of this how
[1:51:55] brother Ram said it. We hewed in our own
[1:51:58] ways.
[1:52:00] Every stone that came into Solomon's
[1:52:02] temple, it looked different,
[1:52:04] but it all went into that building. So,
[1:52:07] I wanted to say it to you like this.
[1:52:08] What's the What's the goal when we look
[1:52:10] at it? Is the goal to get everybody on
[1:52:13] the right? everybody's on the same page
[1:52:15] that everybody every song leader sings
[1:52:18] like this song leader. Well, who made
[1:52:19] that song leader the absolute,
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Everybody's got to everybody's uh the
[1:52:24] the flow of the service has got to go
[1:52:25] like this. Who said?
[1:52:28] Well, everybody everybody's got to
[1:52:30] preach like this. Who said God listen
[1:52:33] God specializes in blowing up our ideas?
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; God don't want us the same. Yeah, that's
[1:52:39] right.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; If he wanted us the same, he would have
[1:52:41] all he would have made everybody bald
[1:52:43] like me and everything. He would have
[1:52:45] done that. If he wanted every preacher
[1:52:46] to be like that, he would have done. But
[1:52:48] God don't want that. He has such a
[1:52:49] diversity. So why not that we would
[1:52:52] chase after personalities, but that we
[1:52:55] can recognize God.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; The goal. The goal, friends, listen. The
[1:53:00] goal I want you to understand this with
[1:53:01] unity. It isn't that all of a sudden
[1:53:03] I'll tell you what, everything brother
[1:53:04] Bill and I see exactly alike. Brother
[1:53:06] Richard and I. Oh, I tell you what. This
[1:53:08] is unity. We see everything just alike.
[1:53:10] No, that ain't. You say, "Well, when
[1:53:12] will that be?" When we get out of these
[1:53:14] bodies.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; When we get out of these right here.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; But until that time, the spirit of God
[1:53:21] is given to us that we might endeavor to
[1:53:24] subdue our own will.
[1:53:27] Subdue our own opinions, thoughts, and
[1:53:29] feelings. Yeah. Look, look, I didn't say
[1:53:31] get rid of your feelings. I didn't say
[1:53:33] get rid of your opinions. I didn't even
[1:53:34] say get rid of your ideas.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Sometimes where it
[1:53:38] comes down to is is that do we have the
[1:53:40] strength within of the love of God to
[1:53:43] forgo that for the body
[1:53:47] or is it just about me?
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Is it just about me? Like you take for
[1:53:52] example a preacher. Oh my well they
[1:53:54] don't preach me enough at this church so
[1:53:55] I'm going to go find another church.
[1:53:57] That to me is like a red flag
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; because there's got to be a reason. If
[1:54:01] they're if you're not getting preached
[1:54:03] enough, I mean, don't you got enough
[1:54:04] confidence in the man of God to pray and
[1:54:06] that whoever God has put there and the
[1:54:08] pastor and maybe they God God God will
[1:54:11] lay it upon their heart. It's not just
[1:54:13] something, oh, we got to give this one
[1:54:14] so much time and we got to give this one
[1:54:15] so much time. We got to give We're not
[1:54:17] we're it's not in our hands to do that.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; It's not about egos. That those are
[1:54:25] things to me that when you see that I
[1:54:27] got to be the one or I got to Oh, oh,
[1:54:29] God. We don't need that. We don't need
[1:54:32] that.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Notice this. Paul would admonish the
[1:54:37] Corinthians.
[1:54:39] I hear there's divisions among you, but
[1:54:41] be perfectly joined together in the same
[1:54:43] mind and in the same judgment.
[1:54:48] How could that be without the Lord
[1:54:51] Jesus? How could that be without them
[1:54:54] seeing
[1:54:56] the greater cause?
[1:54:59] I don't know if you ever read this here
[1:55:00] and looked at this in the scripture, but
[1:55:02] it's always stood out to me in
[1:55:03] Philippians 4:1 when Paul would commend
[1:55:06] the saints to say, "My my brethren,
[1:55:07] dearly beloved, and long for my joy and
[1:55:09] crown, so standfast in the Lord, my
[1:55:11] dearly beloved, and I beseech,
[1:55:14] I pronounce her name, Uice, and beseech
[1:55:17] Cynthia, that they be of the same mind
[1:55:20] in the Lord."
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Now, it's evident they had a quarrel.
[1:55:25] They had something they were pulling
[1:55:27] off. And Paul wrote and said, 'I
[1:55:29] admonish them to be of the same mind.'
[1:55:32] What was he doing? Calling them back to
[1:55:34] the real purpose.
[1:55:36] Not off, but into the real purpose. What
[1:55:38] is it? The more excellent way.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:55:46] You see, God's entrusted us
[1:55:49] to be able to recognize the the ability
[1:55:53] of God's spirit that rest within our
[1:55:55] bosom. We're taught of God. The Bible
[1:55:56] says you're taught on how to love.
[1:56:01] And this is where that when you look at
[1:56:02] it that unity,
[1:56:05] unity with the spirit of God.
[1:56:08] Unity among one another will invite the
[1:56:13] spirit of God in our meetings.
[1:56:17] Disunityity, if unity will invite him,
[1:56:20] disunityity will keep him at bay. Can't
[1:56:23] you see, friends?
[1:56:25] Can't you see how that how Satan would
[1:56:28] love to get in there? He'd like to get
[1:56:29] into a home. He'd like to get right in
[1:56:32] here and get differences among one
[1:56:34] another. I stood back and I've watched
[1:56:36] over the years how Satan has wanted to
[1:56:38] so tear this group to pieces. Get this
[1:56:42] against this and this against this. It
[1:56:44] ain't people. It ain't people. It's
[1:56:47] spirits.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; It's spirits. That ain't putting off on
[1:56:50] anybody. It's spirits, friends. It's
[1:56:52] just like sometimes if you get the
[1:56:53] feeling, you get a thought and my
[1:56:55] goodness, that thought and all of a
[1:56:57] sudden you feel your adrenaline pumping,
[1:56:59] that's a spirit that's trying to anoint
[1:57:01] you, trying to anoint your thinking. But
[1:57:04] aren't you thankful that the spirit of
[1:57:05] God could rise up in your heart and say,
[1:57:07] "Wait a minute. I'm not going to
[1:57:09] entertain that thought. That didn't come
[1:57:11] from God." You know what that is?
[1:57:13] Bringing it to the judgment seat of
[1:57:15] Christ.
[1:57:17] But everything that we have among us, it
[1:57:20] didn't look right here. My goodness. I
[1:57:21] mean, you know how it is. If we we we
[1:57:23] get around one another long enough and
[1:57:25] oh my, I mean, it's almost like, you
[1:57:27] know, it's almost at times from from
[1:57:29] years and years. Oh my, I almost want to
[1:57:32] run. If somebody feels like, oh, brother
[1:57:33] Samuel, I I sure love I sure love this
[1:57:36] and I sure love this and my goodness,
[1:57:37] this is the this is the best. This is
[1:57:39] utopia.
[1:57:41] There's not been a good track record
[1:57:42] with that. A lot of times what ends up
[1:57:45] being the best thing since sliced bread
[1:57:47] ends up being gone.
[1:57:50] I I don't have a there's a lot of com
[1:57:52] what it is. You know what friends I I
[1:57:54] really and honestly like brother B
[1:57:55] talked about personality didn't we try
[1:57:57] to be indifferent but you know what you
[1:57:59] don't want to be in love with a man's
[1:58:00] personality
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; because a man will fail.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; You want to be in love with the Lord
[1:58:04] Jesus.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; That that's where you want to be in
[1:58:06] love. We want to we want to be
[1:58:08] personable to one another. We want to
[1:58:10] try to reach one another. But let me
[1:58:12] just tell you friends, we're not going
[1:58:13] in a rapture because we love somebody's
[1:58:15] personality.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you're not even
[1:58:18] really being tested.
[1:58:20] But what about if God has you in a place
[1:58:25] and my the personality is just not maybe
[1:58:28] what you would have picked out,
[1:58:32] but God has you there because of his
[1:58:35] choice and you've submitted to that
[1:58:38] choice.
[1:58:40] You hearing me? not not about us, but to
[1:58:43] be able to to submit our own our own
[1:58:47] will.
[1:58:48] What about the things God allows things
[1:58:50] to take place, things that don't go our
[1:58:53] way? What about it? What about if, let's
[1:58:55] say, we had a lineup of specials to be
[1:58:58] sung and all of a sudden the spirit of
[1:59:00] God would just move in such a way and
[1:59:02] say, "You know what? Let's just postpone
[1:59:05] those specials until the next service. I
[1:59:07] I really feel like we need to move on
[1:59:08] in." I wonder
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; how what would we do?
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Would we be willing to lay aside
[1:59:16] our idea, our thought, our feeling and
[1:59:19] yeah truly the uncction of the Lord that
[1:59:21] placed that special in our heart? Would
[1:59:22] we be willing to do that
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; for the cause of the body?
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Or will we take away?
[1:59:33] Will we pull away? Listen friends, I
[1:59:37] want I want to see more of God.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; I want to see more of God in my life. I
[1:59:42] want to see more of God right here.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; But I realize that, you know, even these
[1:59:46] things and I every time I've told the
[1:59:47] Lord, even here this afternoon, I said,
[1:59:49] "Lord, how many times that I've preached
[1:59:52] on this subject of love, of divine
[1:59:55] love?" How many times? And yet every
[1:59:58] time as I come through it, there's
[2:00:00] things that the Holy Spirit will just
[2:00:01] comb right through and just just deal
[2:00:04] with in such a way within our midst in
[2:00:07] our lives. But you see what it is,
[2:00:09] friends, don't we're not we're not here
[2:00:10] to try to chase after attributes of, oh,
[2:00:14] I need to be more of this and I need to
[2:00:15] be more of that. God deals with our
[2:00:17] heart. That's true. But what we need is
[2:00:19] more of him.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; If we have if we have more of him, then
[2:00:23] you know what? Patience will come out.
[2:00:26] longsuffering will come out. And we're
[2:00:27] gonna listen, I'll tell you right now,
[2:00:29] all the way to the rapture, we're going
[2:00:31] to need it.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; And when I say we're going to need it,
[2:00:35] it's not just needing it to to to bear
[2:00:37] with one another, but we're going to
[2:00:39] need it to stand there on the other
[2:00:40] side.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to need it
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; to stand there that day. But the spirit
[2:00:46] of God had given to us the love of God
[2:00:48] to be able to bring our lives in
[2:00:51] subjection right now.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; For unity. How many say, 'Lord, I want
[2:00:57] to see more of God.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; I want to see more of God. I want to see
[2:01:00] more of God move down in our services.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; I want to see that. You know where
[2:01:04] that'll You know where that starts? That
[2:01:06] starts with me and you.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; That starts within your home.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, my spouse or this or
[2:01:13] that. No, no, don't don't fuss with
[2:01:14] them.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Just live a godly life.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Endeavor to keep the unity through the
[2:01:20] bond of peace. Don't get entangled in
[2:01:24] things.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Live a salty life. Even when it comes
[2:01:28] among us as believers. Look, look, we
[2:01:30] get around one another long enough,
[2:01:32] we're going to disappoint one another.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; We get to see one another's humanity
[2:01:36] long enough. What are we going to do?
[2:01:39] What What do you do in your marriage
[2:01:41] when you start seeing one another's
[2:01:42] humanity?
[2:01:44] Before, when you married her, all you
[2:01:46] seem was the curls.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Now you get to see how those curls are
[2:01:49] made.
[2:01:51] That's so good,
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Everything before the cake was made for
[2:01:56] you, the pie was made for you,
[2:01:58] everything was oh my. Everything was
[2:02:00] everything was just right. But now, now
[2:02:01] what happens when you start seeing the
[2:02:03] humanity of one another, you know what
[2:02:05] that that's where real true oneness
[2:02:06] comes in
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; is when you're will really start to have
[2:02:09] to sacrifice sometimes sacrificing
[2:02:11] thoughts and sacrificing feelings and
[2:02:14] and just realizing you know what it
[2:02:16] ain't worth it. It ain't worth it to say
[2:02:18] something right now. You know what?
[2:02:20] There's times to talk about things, but
[2:02:22] you also we have discernment on when
[2:02:24] it's not time.
[2:02:27] Lord,
[2:02:28] you need to have something good to sing
[2:02:30] tonight.
[2:02:33] Let's pray.
[2:02:37] How many say, Lord,
[2:02:39] fill me, Lord, with more.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; I want more divine love, Lord.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; I want more. Just an overflowing, Lord.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:02:49] Heavenly Father,
[2:02:53] your God, I pray,
[2:02:56] Lord, you can take the pieces, Lord, of
[2:02:59] of this thought,
[2:03:02] Lord, that you place on my heart and our
[2:03:06] hearts, Lord, have been touched and
[2:03:08] moved, Lord. Not just something where we
[2:03:10] would respond to Lord or just raise our
[2:03:13] hands as to say
[2:03:17] just to go through emotion but Lord from
[2:03:20] the depths of our lives
[2:03:23] we see our need Lord
[2:03:26] and Father with Paul would take such a
[2:03:29] direction by the spirit of God
[2:03:32] to help the Corinthian church to see
[2:03:35] what needs to be the focus.
[2:03:38] No wonder your prophet would tell us if
[2:03:40] we would get to focusing
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; on divine love,
[2:03:45] God will call us out,
[2:03:48] he'll place us, he'll put us just
[2:03:50] exactly where he wants us to be.
[2:03:52] Whatever whatever gift, whatever part in
[2:03:54] the body, whatever we're to do, we don't
[2:03:57] even have to worry about that.
[2:03:59] That's something, Lord, that God that
[2:04:01] you will place us where we need to be.
[2:04:04] So, Father, in the middle of in the
[2:04:06] midst of this time, if there's one thing
[2:04:08] as Paul would write to the Corinthian
[2:04:11] church, he would come all the way
[2:04:12] through that chapter 13, giving all the
[2:04:16] different attributes of divine love.
[2:04:19] Lord, I'm sure that we can go through
[2:04:21] that, Lord, and our lives are
[2:04:22] challenged,
[2:04:25] challenged, Lord, because we can always
[2:04:28] see our need for more of you.
[2:04:31] But then he would come to that place in
[2:04:34] the beginning of chapter 14 and let them
[2:04:36] know follow after charity
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; and desire spiritual gifts. Pursue it.
[2:04:43] Pursue the love of God. Chase after it.
[2:04:47] Let that be the pursuit of your life.
[2:04:51] Lord,
[2:04:52] hands throughout this building,
[2:04:55] mine included, have went up, Lord, to
[2:04:57] ask you.
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:00] I want a fresh refilling
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; of divine love. Lord,
[2:05:07] I need more, Lord.
[2:05:10] I need more. I don't just need it on
[2:05:12] Thursday and Sunday, Lord. Oh God, we
[2:05:15] have access, Lord, to have that
[2:05:18] refilling in our lives, Lord,
[2:05:22] our brothers and sisters. Things that we
[2:05:24] face on the job,
[2:05:27] Lord. things that Lord that are brought
[2:05:29] to our attention Lord in families and on
[2:05:31] and on and Lord God even among us Lord
[2:05:35] we're a diver we're a diverse people
[2:05:39] we're different Lord in so many
[2:05:40] different ways
[2:05:44] Lord our ideas our feelings our opinions
[2:05:46] but oh God
[2:05:51] may we lay those things aside Lord
[2:05:56] may we lay them aside, Lord, that
[2:06:00] you can move down in our midst. Lord,
[2:06:04] I believe, Lord, that the Holy Spirit,
[2:06:06] you so want to do that that I believe
[2:06:09] God, if hearts could just say tonight,
[2:06:11] Lord, move me into that place. Lord,
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not there, but I want to be there.
[2:06:17] Lord, move me into that place to where I
[2:06:19] can lay aside my feelings, my ideas, my
[2:06:22] opinions. They're so strong, but I've
[2:06:24] got confidence in you, Lord.
[2:06:26] I need that strength, Lord.
[2:06:30] I want to be able to lay it aside, Lord.
[2:06:33] I don't want to hold on to these things,
[2:06:36] Lord, that would hinder. I need more of
[2:06:38] you in my life, and there's needs in my
[2:06:40] brothers, my sisters. There's needs
[2:06:42] among us, Lord God.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:45] Oh father, if when they were building
[2:06:47] the tower of babel,
[2:06:50] they were with one vision
[2:06:53] [Music]
[2:06:54] building that that tower there was unity
[2:06:58] among them, but it was a false unity.
[2:07:01] It was around the wrong thing.
[2:07:04] Lord, we see that in this hour
[2:07:06] spiritually, we see that false unity. We
[2:07:10] see that ride that's been going on down
[2:07:12] through the ages
[2:07:14] where it moves from the white horse to
[2:07:17] the red horse to the black horse and now
[2:07:19] Lord God in that pale horse ride Lord a
[2:07:23] mixture
[2:07:25] a unity but it's a false unity.
[2:07:30] Oh Lord God,
[2:07:32] grant it Lord God knowing Lord that this
[2:07:36] rapture
[2:07:37] it's upon us Lord
[2:07:40] help us Lord I pray dear God help us
[2:07:43] oh God make us tender Lord
[2:07:47] maybe our hearts have become hardened
[2:07:49] Lord with cares and maybe
[2:07:51] disappointments Lord but God I'm asking
[2:07:55] may the Holy Spirit the great raise of
[2:07:57] the so may you warm our hearts Lord, I
[2:08:00] pray God dry back the darkness Lord and
[2:08:04] the doubt Lord dry back Lord the
[2:08:06] contentions and the strife Lord may the
[2:08:09] spirit of God
[2:08:11] may you Lord I pray just have the right
[2:08:14] away Lord in our midst
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Lord you would have never came in that
[2:08:20] upper room
[2:08:21] if they had been in disarray
[2:08:26] but they were with one accord
[2:08:28] Yes, Lord.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; It shows there's a measure that lays
[2:08:32] within us, Lord.
[2:08:34] And what will give us that strength?
[2:08:39] Lord, sometimes disappointments, other
[2:08:41] things can strike and we can go to
[2:08:43] burying ourselves in things that give us
[2:08:46] no more strength and nothing, no more
[2:08:49] spirituality.
[2:08:51] Sometimes the enemy, Lord, likes to
[2:08:52] point out failures and mistakes and
[2:08:55] other things, Lord. But God, may we turn
[2:08:57] to you, Father, because you've never
[2:09:00] made a mistake, Lord God. Your word is
[2:09:03] true, Lord Jesus.
[2:09:06] They were drawing strength
[2:09:10] from the revealed word.
[2:09:13] The same word that had walked among them
[2:09:15] when they were sad and discouraged,
[2:09:19] when they were bewildered, as the
[2:09:21] prophet said. But here you came and you
[2:09:24] begin to take them on a journey through
[2:09:27] the word to let them see I have
[2:09:30] fulfilled
[2:09:31] the word that was spoken
[2:09:34] regarding my journey as a redeemer.
[2:09:38] That gave them confidence. The Bible
[2:09:40] tells us, Lord, they went with joy to
[2:09:42] the upper room knowing that the promise
[2:09:44] was certain.
[2:09:46] Lord God, help us. We'll never have
[2:09:49] unity by looking at one another.
[2:09:52] All we'll see is flesh,
[2:09:55] shortcomings,
[2:09:57] humanity. That's all we'll see.
[2:10:01] Oh, but God,
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; give us grace, Lord, that we can get our
[2:10:05] eyes off of one another just as much as
[2:10:08] we can get our eyes on somebody with a
[2:10:10] gift and that's not right either. Help
[2:10:14] us, Lord. Help us, Lord, to keep our
[2:10:17] eyes on you, Lord.
[2:10:19] Help us to keep our eyes on you as the
[2:10:21] author and finisher of our faith.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Granted, Lord, I know I know the
[2:10:26] potential that lays here, Lord God,
[2:10:28] right among us. I know, Lord, there's
[2:10:30] parents, Lord, that are holding on for
[2:10:32] their children, Lord, for their loved
[2:10:34] ones. There's those among us, Lord, that
[2:10:36] are sick and body, Lord. There's needs
[2:10:39] among us, Lord, for the Holy Ghost. Oh,
[2:10:41] God. Grant it, Lord. May we be willing,
[2:10:44] Lord, to lay aside our differences, our
[2:10:47] ideas, and our opinions.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; grant it, Lord, I pray.
[2:10:56] Oh Jesus.
[2:10:59] Granted, Lord. Granted, Lord.
[2:11:03] Oh friends, why don't you just take hold
[2:11:05] of El Shad tonight?
[2:11:08] He's not here condemning. He's here to
[2:11:11] woo us to his bosom. If you feel like
[2:11:13] you don't have the strength that you
[2:11:15] need, why don't you just why don't you
[2:11:17] just take up into his bosom and begin to
[2:11:19] draw from him tonight? Lord, I need a
[2:11:22] draw from you, Lord, down into my life
[2:11:26] to where I can just be able to live
[2:11:28] above self.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Why don't you draw down into your life
[2:11:32] tonight?
[2:11:34] Maybe you need the Holy Ghost. Why don't
[2:11:35] you just draw down into your life
[2:11:37] tonight? Just say Lord I give myself
[2:11:40] Lord to you. Lord God let my heart be
[2:11:44] led to that place of full surrender.
[2:11:48] Lord God grant it Lord.
[2:11:50] Oh God what an achievement. What an
[2:11:53] achievement.
[2:11:55] We could walk on the water
[2:11:57] but that's not what you've asked us to
[2:11:59] do.
[2:12:01] There could be miracle after miracle
[2:12:03] after miracle,
[2:12:05] but Lord, that's not what you're coming
[2:12:07] to rapture. We believe in miracles. We
[2:12:09] need them.
[2:12:14] But what would be the greatest
[2:12:15] achievement?
[2:12:18] A people that would come together in
[2:12:21] unity with God's word,
[2:12:24] unity with one another.
[2:12:26] What an achievement by the spirit of the
[2:12:29] living God.
[2:12:32] Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:12:35] help us, Lord. I pray,
[2:12:38] help us, Lord. Sometimes, Lord, like an
[2:12:41] old saying we hear, the grass always
[2:12:43] looks greener on the other side of the
[2:12:45] fence. We can go from this place to this
[2:12:48] place and realize every church has
[2:12:50] problems
[2:12:51] because there's people. We're humans
[2:12:55] right here. And Lord, it will require
[2:12:58] the grace of God moving within our
[2:13:01] lives.
[2:13:02] We want to just move deeper in you,
[2:13:04] Lord. We want to move deeper in you. I
[2:13:07] don't want to, like the song says, it's
[2:13:09] not my brother, not my sister, it's me.
[2:13:10] Oh Lord, it's me. It's me.
[2:13:14] Help us, Lord. I pray. What an
[2:13:17] achievement, Lord. What an achievement
[2:13:20] to be able to be caught away
[2:13:25] from self.
[2:13:27] Be able to so submit ourselves Lord
[2:13:33] on that cross. Help us Lord I pray.
[2:13:38] Grant it Lord
[2:13:40] in Jesus precious name.
[2:13:44] Amen. Could we just could we worship him
[2:13:46] just a little bit?
[2:13:49] me.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Let him let him just water it
[2:13:54] in.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Thy word.
[2:13:59] Oh, show
[2:14:02] me my
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; myself
[2:14:06] and show me
[2:14:09] my my Savior
[2:14:13] and let
[2:14:15] the world live.
[2:14:19] And let
[2:14:22] the world live.
[2:14:26] Let
[2:14:28] the word live
[2:14:32] in me.
[2:14:35] Oh,
[2:14:37] I want to live. I want to live
[2:14:42] the way
[2:14:45] that he wants me
[2:14:49] to live. And I want to give
[2:14:56] until there's just no no more
[2:15:02] to give.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want you love
[2:15:08] more love till there's just no
[2:15:15] more love.
[2:15:17] Oh, I could never
[2:15:20] ever
[2:15:22] out love
[2:15:24] the Lord.
[2:15:28] Yes, I want to live
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; the way the way that he wants me
[2:15:40] to live.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; And I want
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to give
[2:15:45] [Music]
[2:15:46] until there is just no more
[2:15:53] to give.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; I want to love
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:16:00] you. There's just no
[2:16:05] more love for I could never
[2:16:11] ever out love
[2:16:15] the Lord.
[2:16:18] And I keep falling in love with him over
[2:16:23] and over and over and over again.
[2:16:30] I keep falling in love with him over and
[2:16:34] over and over and over again.
[2:16:39] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days
[2:16:44] go by.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. I
[2:16:50] keep falling in love with him over and
[2:16:54] over and over and over again. Oh, I keep
[2:17:00] falling in love with him over and over
[2:17:04] and over and over again.
[2:17:08] I keep falling in love with him over and
[2:17:12] over and over and over again. Well, he
[2:17:17] gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go
[2:17:21] by. Well, what a love between my Lord
[2:17:25] and I. I keep falling in love with him
[2:17:29] over and over and over and over again.
[2:17:38] Lord, prepare
[2:17:42] me
[2:17:44] to be a sanctuary.
[2:17:49] [Music]
[2:17:52] Oh, pure
[2:17:55] and holy,

[2:18:02] and true.
[2:18:09] Oh, and with thanksgiving.
[2:18:16] For I'll be
[2:18:19] a living.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:18:24] sanuual.
[2:18:30] Yes Lord. Oh for
[2:18:35] you.
[2:18:39] Oh Lord,
[2:18:42] prepare
[2:18:45] me
[2:18:47] to be a sanctuary.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[2:18:55] just come through our lives, Lord.
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Lined up with you, Lord.
[2:19:03] Oh,
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; lined up with one another.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; You'll lead us, Lord.
[2:19:10] Amen.
[2:19:12] with thanksgiving.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll be a living
[2:19:25] [Music]
[2:19:27] sanctuary
[2:19:36] for
[2:19:38] you.
[2:19:43] [Music]
[2:19:45] Hallelujah.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:19:50] Thank you Lord.
[2:19:52] Thank you Lord.
[2:19:55] Thank you Lord for your mercy. Jesus.
[2:19:59] Thank you Jesus.
[2:20:01] [Music]
[2:20:03] Think about it friends.
[2:20:06] Elijah came to the mountain. Those
[2:20:08] stones were in such disarray.
[2:20:10] [Music]
[2:20:12] But under a vision and a word from God,
[2:20:15] he put the stones in order. And when the
[2:20:19] stones were in order, wood in order,
[2:20:23] sacrifice in order,
[2:20:26] the fire of God came down
[2:20:30] and say, "Lord Jesus,
[2:20:32] [Music]
[2:20:34] maybe you're an eighth note, quarter
[2:20:36] note, half note, whole note,
[2:20:39] but I want to surrender whatever note
[2:20:41] that I am. Maybe I'm a rest. I don't
[2:20:44] know. But I want to surrender it that
[2:20:47] it'll go right on the music sheet. That
[2:20:50] it won't stand out like they're playing
[2:20:52] the music right now, but it'll come
[2:20:54] right together.
[2:20:57] The notes, the harmony, the pitch, it
[2:21:00] comes together with such a beautiful
[2:21:02] melody.
[2:21:04] May we just so yield of our lives in
[2:21:07] that way. And you know where that
[2:21:08] strength comes from? It comes from the
[2:21:11] Lord. comes from spending time with him,
[2:21:14] getting in his presence. It's not just
[2:21:16] something that is just like push button
[2:21:18] or switch and we need to do this, we
[2:21:20] need to do that, but it's staying in his
[2:21:22] presence. And God endows us with the
[2:21:24] strength and the sweetness,
[2:21:27] the meekness
[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:30] to be able to do and actually subdue our
[2:21:33] own lives to his word.
[2:21:38] Oh, help us, Lord.
[2:21:40] Help us, Lord.
[2:21:43] Amen. How many say that? That's going to
[2:21:44] be my prayer as I go out of here in this
[2:21:47] week. Lord, make us one. One with you.
[2:21:51] Help us, Lord. Give us the strength.
[2:21:53] Give us the grace that we need. Lord,
[2:21:56] you might say, "Brother Samuel, it maybe
[2:21:58] not everybody. I'm not worried about
[2:21:59] everybody."
[2:22:01] But Brother Ram tells us God can do more
[2:22:02] with one than he could even with 10
[2:22:05] revivals. Maybe it'll start with one,
[2:22:07] goes to another, goes to another. that
[2:22:10] realization begins to break upon one
[2:22:12] another. Oh God, help us.
[2:22:17] Help us, Lord.
[2:22:20] Yes, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:22:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:22:25] [Music]
[2:22:28] Thank you, Lord.
[2:22:31] I'll be
[2:22:33] a living
[2:22:38] living
[2:22:39] sanctuary
[2:22:44] [Music]
[2:22:47] for
[2:22:50] you.
[2:22:53] Hallelujah.
[2:22:55] Oh Lord,
[2:22:57] prepare
[2:23:00] me.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Lead me Lord.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Guide us Lord
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; in our own individual lives. Help us
[2:23:12] Lord and
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; in this land of adoption Lord.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Oh God
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; self-sacrificing.
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:24] Oh God, sing that it's the body,
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; the body of Jesus Christ,
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; spirit of God moving Lord in our midst.
[2:23:36] Oh God the living.
