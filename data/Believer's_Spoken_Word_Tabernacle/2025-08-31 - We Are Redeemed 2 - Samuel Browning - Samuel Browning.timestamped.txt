[42:24] services that just you know, take care
[42:26] of different things that we some of the
[42:29] the sweeping and different things

[42:58] nice to come into. And so then we thank
[43:00] God for the times of the deep cleaning
[43:02] and things like that as well. So uh well
[43:06] let's look here in the word in Ruth
[43:07] chapter 4 and verse 7.
[43:11] And uh now this was the manner in former
[43:14] time in Israel concerning redeeming and
[43:17] concerning changing for to confirm all
[43:19] things. A man plucked off his shoe and
[43:22] gave it to his neighbor. And this was a
[43:25] testimony in Israel. Therefore the
[43:27] kinsman said unto Boaz, "Buy it for
[43:30] thee." So he drew off his shoe. And Boaz
[43:34] said unto the elders and to all the
[43:36] people, "You are witnesses this day that
[43:40] I have bought all that was IMC and all
[43:42] that was Kylons and Malons of the hand
[43:45] of Naomi.
[43:47] Moreover, Ruth the Moabitis, the wife of
[43:50] Malon, have I purchased to be my wife,
[43:54] to raise up the name of the dead upon
[43:58] his inheritance, that the name of the
[44:00] dead be not cut off from among his
[44:03] brethren. And from the gate of his
[44:05] place, ye are witnesses this day. And
[44:09] all the people that were in the gate,
[44:11] and the elders said, We are witnesses.
[44:14] I'd like to say this morning, we are
[44:17] witnesses.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of what he has done on Calvary.
[44:24] And when he rose and he sent back the
[44:27] Holy Ghost, we are witnesses.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Of what he has done. We are witnesses in
[44:34] our own lives. It's the Holy Spirit in
[44:37] us. Amen. Can you say amen to that?
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord make the woman that is
[44:43] come into thine house like Rachel and
[44:44] like Leah, which too did build the house
[44:48] of Israel.
[44:50] I'm sorry I didn't put that down there.
[44:53] And do thou worthily in Epherta, and be
[44:56] famous in Bethlehem, and let thy house
[44:59] be like the house of Ferris, whom
[45:02] tomorrow bear unto Judah, of the seed
[45:04] which the Lord shall give thee of this
[45:06] young woman. So Boaz took Ruth and she
[45:10] was his wife. And when he went in unto
[45:12] her, the Lord gave her conception, and
[45:15] she bare a son. Amen. May the Lord just
[45:19] bless the word. Could we ask his
[45:20] blessing upon it and ask him just to he
[45:24] would guide us here this morning.
[45:26] Heavenly Father, Lord, we are just so
[45:30] appreciative of your grace once again.
[45:33] Lord, we thank you for the opportunity
[45:35] that we have to be able to come and
[45:38] together, Lord, in your house, in your
[45:41] presence, Lord, and to come and to hear
[45:44] your word. And Father, we just ask that
[45:47] God may, Lord, you just move among us
[45:51] according to each and every need and
[45:53] request that's upon the hearts of your
[45:56] children this morning. Lord, I pray that
[45:59] Father, may you, Lord, just take your
[46:02] word, Lord, and oh God, that it would
[46:05] find, Lord, that bedding ground in our
[46:07] hearts and our lives and order to bring
[46:10] forth and to reflect you, Lord, in
[46:12] everything, in every way in our life.
[46:15] Lord, we commit ourselves into your
[46:17] hands and ask that Lord that you would
[46:20] forgive us of our sins and our
[46:21] shortcomings. And father, may your
[46:24] presence just now move among us for
[46:26] every need. We commit it now, this
[46:28] service into your hands for your glory
[46:31] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I want to
[46:35] just continue to speak as you're being
[46:38] seated on this thought. We are redeemed
[46:42] and no rental
[46:44] agreements.
[46:47] And uh
[46:50] looking at this portion of scripture
[46:53] here, we know that with Ruth, we seeing
[46:56] that all the way through the scriptures,
[46:59] the Bible itself is is the book of
[47:02] redemption and how that God would so um
[47:07] lay out the types of redemption and
[47:09] God's whole purpose is to bring us back
[47:13] to himself and that he might fully dwell
[47:16] in us and then through that working in
[47:20] our lives where our soul has been
[47:23] redeemed. The reality of it strikes our
[47:26] heart. When you know our confession has
[47:28] been made and the spirit of God comes
[47:31] and dwelling there on the inside, God
[47:33] taking his rightful position in our
[47:36] life. Then our lives then begin to
[47:39] reflect the redemption of what he
[47:42] himself has already done. And then when
[47:46] that through that through his life on
[47:48] the inside is it reflects redemption
[47:50] that we're no longer our own but we've
[47:52] been bought with a price. And so within
[47:55] that our whole lives is a reflection of
[47:58] him. And it's it's him that through the
[48:00] bedding ground in our lives like the
[48:02] text that we read when Boaz would take
[48:05] Ruth it would be through that even of
[48:07] the kinsmen to raise up uh seed unto the
[48:11] name of that of the dead. And I want to
[48:14] say that our Lord Jesus is not dead.
[48:17] He's alive.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; And to say that to realize that our
[48:21] lives that it has been ordained by God
[48:24] that our lives as Peter would write
[48:26] about being chosen witnesses that for
[48:29] the life of God to come to you and I and
[48:32] to seek us out that his name might
[48:35] continually be declared through our
[48:37] lives upon this earth. Because it's one
[48:40] thing for us, we know and understand to
[48:42] say that we are a Christian, but it's
[48:45] but it's something entirely different
[48:47] when Christ himself is the one who gives
[48:50] witness through our life that we're a
[48:52] Christian because to be a Christian is
[48:54] to be Christlike. And it it comes with
[48:58] Christ's life uh dwelling on the inside
[49:00] of us. And so when we come to this
[49:02] place, we are we are witnesses of this
[49:05] reality that we have been redeemed.
[49:07] There's nothing there's nothing more
[49:09] precious than that revelation that we
[49:13] have been redeemed that he is my
[49:15] Passover lamb that I that he had taken
[49:18] he took my place and that I am a part of
[49:21] him and that he is in me and I am in him
[49:23] there's no greater revelation it God
[49:26] works to bring that settleness and that
[49:28] rest within our life because once we
[49:31] have been redeemed the prophet said you
[49:33] can never once we've been uh bought out
[49:36] of the market and loosened. You can
[49:38] never be sold again. You're marked.
[49:41] You're sealed. And to think that how
[49:44] that within all of that, the prophet
[49:45] says, when a man has once come to Christ
[49:48] and been redeemed by the precious blood,
[49:50] the devil can never make you a slave
[49:53] again. You're secure in the blood of
[49:56] Jesus Christ until the day of your
[49:58] redemption. Now the scriptures that
[50:01] we've been looking at this scripture
[50:02] that as Paul would write that know you
[50:05] not that your body is the temple of the
[50:07] Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[50:10] have of God and you are not your own for
[50:14] you are bought with a price. Therefore
[50:17] glorify God in your body and in your
[50:21] spirit which are gods. So seeing of how
[50:25] that Paul would lay this out because we
[50:28] understand that even as the tabernacle
[50:31] there that we've looked at and showing
[50:33] the pictures of it and seeing it down
[50:35] through the of the scripture that we are
[50:39] are are are a three- room house. We are
[50:41] body, spirit, and soul. And so then we
[50:45] when Paul writes that our body is a
[50:47] tabernacle of the Holy Ghost, think of
[50:50] it in the wilderness and with every
[50:52] temple that was made, the Holy Spirit,
[50:54] the pillar of fire, he would go and he
[50:58] would reside over the holiest of holies
[51:01] over that of the mercy seat. And that's
[51:04] where he would dwell and his presence
[51:06] would emanate throughout the entire the
[51:10] entire uh tabernacle. And that's how
[51:12] that it is to be within our lives
[51:15] through redemption. Is that when our
[51:17] soul has been redeemed, our nature has
[51:20] been changed, the things of the world
[51:22] has passed away, then our lives are a
[51:25] reflection of redemption. Just like
[51:28] before God got a hold of our lives, our
[51:30] lives reflected the world of which we
[51:34] were a part of under that first nature.
[51:37] the things that we did, it was natural
[51:39] to have those desires within us to do
[51:42] those things. Why? Because that was the
[51:44] nature. That's why when when Paul or the
[51:46] scriptures would write that man is born
[51:48] of a woman is a few days old and full of
[51:51] trouble and how that David would write
[51:53] that we were conceived with an iniquity.
[51:56] But God made a way that you and I could
[51:58] come back to being real sons and
[52:02] daughters of God through the indwelling
[52:04] of his spirit. there there had to be a
[52:07] purchase that was made and God made that
[52:10] purchase. You know, you might be here
[52:12] this morning and it just is something
[52:15] that and one day it struck your heart or
[52:17] this might be the moment it would strike
[52:19] your heart of what he has already done
[52:23] for you. You know, no matter what has
[52:25] taken place and no matter what
[52:27] situation, he doesn't have to go to
[52:30] Calvary one more time. He He already
[52:34] paid the price. He bore the full the
[52:37] full full brunt of sin. He paid for
[52:39] past, present, and future sin. He is the
[52:43] lamb of God that took the full sin of
[52:45] the world. And he deposited sin in the
[52:47] lowest parts of hell. He rose up on that
[52:50] Easter morning triumphant and he sent
[52:53] back the gospel, which is that of the
[52:55] good news that lets you and I know that
[52:57] you don't have to remain where you're at
[53:00] any longer. that there is come a
[53:03] liberty, a jubilee, a sounding, a
[53:05] reality to the church of the living God.
[53:09] And I'll tell you what, to a real to a
[53:11] real believer, that's the very answer.
[53:14] That's what we've been longing for.
[53:16] Because you know, you we you and I could
[53:18] we could try and we no doubt all been
[53:21] there to where you try to make yourself
[53:23] better, but you can never make yourself
[53:26] good enough. It's not what you're able
[53:29] to do. the the law perished, works
[53:32] perished with it. It could never the law
[53:35] could never produce a victorious life.
[53:38] But now when the lawgiver himself came,
[53:41] when the spirit of righteousness, when
[53:44] God himself came down and become one of
[53:47] us, now there is where that there comes
[53:50] an answer in our life that you and I
[53:53] could actually live a life of liberty
[53:57] and not condemnation. where we are free
[54:00] and the blood of Jesus Christ makes us
[54:03] free. And then we have that testimony
[54:05] our life. It's no longer I that live it,
[54:07] but it's Christ that's living in me.
[54:10] It's not me me trying to do what's
[54:12] right, but it's Christ that is the one
[54:14] who's motivating me. It's him that is
[54:17] influencing and directing my life. And
[54:20] and it's him that's the one that even is
[54:22] bringing conviction in my life. Because
[54:25] listen, I I don't believe that
[54:26] conviction is just something that is to
[54:29] take place in our life when we've done
[54:30] wrong. But I believe we ought to be
[54:32] people that walk with a conviction that
[54:35] walk with a real sincerity. You know,
[54:38] we're not just we're not just uh h a
[54:40] people that are floating along with the
[54:42] rest of society. And and I I'm going to
[54:44] say it in this way. We're not we're not
[54:47] here to make ourselves different because
[54:49] you and I in our own selves could not
[54:52] make ourselves any different. But it is
[54:55] Christ in our life that has made the
[54:58] difference. When it came time for Israel
[55:01] to live e to leave Egypt, remember God
[55:04] let them know, I will show how I do put
[55:07] a difference between that of Israel and
[55:10] the Egyptians. And the way that God puts
[55:13] a difference between his people and the
[55:16] rest of the world is by his blood. When
[55:20] lives have come under the shed blood of
[55:22] the lamb, then there's a fellowship
[55:24] between God and his children and it
[55:27] reflects itself through our lives.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Now I want to say it in this way that
[55:33] throw so with God taking the most
[55:36] centermost part of our life in that of
[55:40] where the soul is redeemed. Here you
[55:43] have of the spirit and of the body and
[55:46] these are places that within it all that
[55:49] must be maintained within our life. And
[55:52] you know these are things that it's not
[55:53] just me uh saying this to you and I
[55:56] could rehearse many scriptures but you
[55:58] begin to realize this in your walk with
[56:01] God that every day in your walk with
[56:04] God. It is a walk that is to be
[56:06] maintained. If Jude could write,
[56:09] building yourselves up on your most holy
[56:11] faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
[56:13] keeping yourselves in the love of God,
[56:16] that's just one of the places it shows
[56:18] to that of a believer. In order to live
[56:21] a real victorious life in God, it's
[56:25] going to take a real dedication in our
[56:27] life. And dedication is every moment.
[56:30] It's it's decisions. It's it's choices
[56:33] that we make within our life. Now, I
[56:36] want to want you to look at this how
[56:37] Paul wrote this. He said, "You're bought
[56:39] with a price." I we we want to live our
[56:42] lives as redeemed vessels. In other
[56:45] words, there's no no area of our life
[56:48] that is somehow uh sectioned off in some
[56:51] area that God cannot touch. But when the
[56:54] Holy Spirit is come, he goes down
[56:56] through every area of our life. He takes
[56:59] care of every door of every situation.
[57:02] And let me just say it like this uh this
[57:04] morning. If there's something in your
[57:06] life that you find yourself struggling
[57:08] with, listen, allow the Holy Spirit to
[57:11] come in and allow him to come in that
[57:13] area of your life and say, "Lord, I I I
[57:16] want you to come in this area." Maybe
[57:18] it's the door of pride. Maybe it's the
[57:20] door of self. Maybe it's a door of
[57:22] fashion. Whatever it is, say, "God, I
[57:24] want you to be the Lord of my life, and
[57:26] I invite you into that area of your
[57:28] life." Let me tell you, you can't take
[57:30] care of that. But almighty God who's a
[57:33] consuming fire is able to take that out
[57:35] of your life to where that the desire
[57:38] passes away from your life. I say invite
[57:41] God into every area, every situation,
[57:45] every part of our life.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; This is where he said, "Therefore,
[57:49] because we are bought with a price,
[57:52] glorify God in your body and in your
[57:54] spirit which are gods."
[57:58] Now, the prophet would say it like this
[58:00] in the dedication of the building. He
[58:01] said, "You're a three- room house, a
[58:03] three compartment service. Your body,
[58:05] that's what you do for Christ. The other
[58:08] is your spirit, what you think of
[58:10] Christ. And the other is your soul, the
[58:13] faith that you have in Christ. It's a
[58:15] three- room house completely, absolutely
[58:18] dedicated to the service of the living
[58:20] God. justification by faith,
[58:22] sanctification by the blood, and the
[58:25] filling of the Holy Spirit, entering
[58:27] into peace and rest with God. Paul would
[58:31] pick this up in Hebrews 3 and say, "For
[58:33] every house is builded by some man. But
[58:37] he that built all things is God, and
[58:40] Moses verilely was faithful in all his
[58:43] house as a servant for a testimony of
[58:46] those things which were to be spoken
[58:48] after." How many How many realize that?
[58:50] Moses was a faithful servant.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Moses is not the one who came up with a
[58:55] design for the tabernacle. It was it was
[58:59] God's heart that actually was longing
[59:03] from where he dwelt in man in Eden. It
[59:07] was God's desire to get back into that
[59:10] place where he would dwell supremely in
[59:14] man. There would be a real oneness. So
[59:17] God would even allow glimpses even the
[59:20] burdens that he would place upon man.
[59:22] Even when Abraham would pray and begin
[59:25] to ask for an heir, that inspiration
[59:28] itself, you might say, "Well, brother
[59:29] Samuel, it's natural for a man to want a
[59:31] child." But I want to ask you this right
[59:34] here. Who is it that would put that
[59:36] inspiration upon him where he would
[59:38] begin to consider and think about an
[59:41] heir? And he would even consider that of
[59:44] Eleazar. But Eleazar wasn't one born in
[59:47] his house. And God was through that
[59:50] burden he placed upon Abraham was
[59:52] actually it was God expressing his
[59:56] desire that let you and I know that
[59:58] there would be errors that would come
[1:00:01] from his own loins. God doesn't have
[1:00:03] errors outside of his word. But every
[1:00:06] heir of God is a child of God. is a seed
[1:00:10] of Abraham and it comes from within the
[1:00:13] word. There's no heirs outside of the
[1:00:15] word but in the word that's where the
[1:00:17] heirs of God are. And then you would
[1:00:19] have the the the uncction that would
[1:00:22] move down upon Moses heart and hear how
[1:00:25] God would would speak about in Exodus
[1:00:28] 25, let them make me a sanctuary. Now I
[1:00:30] want you to think about this that the
[1:00:32] people themselves would have no idea how
[1:00:36] to make a sanctuary for God. God doesn't
[1:00:38] leave it up to our interpretation. God
[1:00:41] doesn't leave it up to our figuring. Let
[1:00:44] let me just say it to you like this.
[1:00:45] Even in this hour where God here we've
[1:00:48] had the Bible, we've had the scriptures
[1:00:50] down through time and even as it got put
[1:00:53] back into the hands of of individuals.
[1:00:55] But I want to say this to you that
[1:00:57] without God himself, the same pillar of
[1:01:00] fire that wrote the word coming in the
[1:01:03] end time to interpret that word and make
[1:01:06] that word alive, we would still be under
[1:01:09] the presumptions, the assumptions of
[1:01:12] man. But this is why that when the
[1:01:14] pillar of fire is come, the pillar of
[1:01:17] fire goes beyond traditions of man and
[1:01:20] it takes us back into the very mind and
[1:01:23] thoughts of almighty God. So we're not
[1:01:26] in a guesswork. We're not in an
[1:01:28] uncertainty. We're not left wondering.
[1:01:31] But the pillar of fire has come to
[1:01:33] reveal the way back for sons and
[1:01:36] daughters of God that we might live in
[1:01:39] the glory of God and reflect real
[1:01:42] redemption.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God for the pillar of
[1:01:47] fire.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Thank God for real revelation.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Like the prophet would say it there in
[1:01:52] closing out his ministry, he said to
[1:01:55] think. He said that Job and different
[1:01:57] ones they did not have he said
[1:01:59] necessarily the written Bible he said
[1:02:01] but they had revelation and that is the
[1:02:04] most important part
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; because there's many that have this
[1:02:08] Bible but you realize without revelation
[1:02:11] then then re then it just is letters
[1:02:14] that's laying here it's laid open to
[1:02:17] what man would think how did they get
[1:02:18] all the traditions oral traditions but
[1:02:21] when the Holy Spirit is come
[1:02:25] Oh, hallelujah. He's the one that
[1:02:28] releases the contents
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; of the book.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Like on a CD, you need something to
[1:02:34] release what's wrote on there. Or a
[1:02:36] record, you need something to release
[1:02:38] what's wrote on there. On a tape, you
[1:02:40] need something to release what's wrote
[1:02:42] on there. And God in the end time said
[1:02:45] that he would send Elijah the prophet.
[1:02:48] And what is a prophet? A prophet is a
[1:02:51] vitro needle that is placed upon what's
[1:02:54] been sealed in here to release the
[1:02:57] contents of it. Let me tell you, that's
[1:02:59] why this message means something to you
[1:03:01] and I. It has a drawing power on it.
[1:03:04] It's not a drawing you to a church, but
[1:03:07] it's drawing you back to where you come
[1:03:09] from.
[1:03:12] It draws you out of your sin, draws you
[1:03:15] out of your unbelief, and it's drawing
[1:03:17] you right into a body change.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; That's the power of the pillar of fire
[1:03:24] among us once again.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And I'll say Moses was faithful. He was
[1:03:30] faithful
[1:03:32] to be caught up and to bring down
[1:03:36] that pattern. You see, it was not an
[1:03:39] earthly configuration, but he was caught
[1:03:42] up into the heavenlies. And what he saw
[1:03:45] in the heavenlies, he was to utter in
[1:03:48] that of an earthly realm. And when
[1:03:51] everything would be coming into its
[1:03:53] rightful place, then God himself came
[1:03:57] down at the finishing of that
[1:03:59] tabernacle. Let me just say it to you.
[1:04:01] at the finishing of the tabernacle
[1:04:03] wasn't when the last little part was
[1:04:04] just put in place, but when it was
[1:04:07] finished is when God stepped in it.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And when God steps in it, he is a
[1:04:15] manning his own word. Because the
[1:04:18] pattern that he gave was his word. Let
[1:04:21] me tell you, the Holy Spirit will not
[1:04:23] come to anything other than his word.
[1:04:26] And God has laid out the pattern. And
[1:04:28] Moses was faithful to that pattern.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; He was faithful to hold to it. Now, you
[1:04:34] know, within it all, God had men that
[1:04:36] were ordained to take those patterns and
[1:04:39] to work with it. But I I want to I want
[1:04:41] to remind you of this, and perhaps I'll
[1:04:43] pick it up here in just a little bit.
[1:04:44] But as the tabernacle itself, it would
[1:04:47] come through lives where vessels would
[1:04:49] surrender what they had in their
[1:04:52] possession. And whatever it was, whether
[1:04:54] it was a black onx stone, those that
[1:04:56] would weave goat hairs, th those that
[1:04:58] would do other things, they each had a
[1:05:01] part in the tabernacle of God. Let me
[1:05:03] say this to you. You have a part in the
[1:05:06] economy of God.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And God's not going to ask something
[1:05:10] from you that you don't already have.
[1:05:12] But what the Holy Spirit comes to do is
[1:05:15] inspire to you. This is why it's not a
[1:05:17] group revelation. It's an individual
[1:05:20] revelation of that great revelation of
[1:05:24] Jesus Christ. And each and every one of
[1:05:27] us have a part within this as a real
[1:05:30] believer. That's what the Holy Spirit is
[1:05:33] seeking out to bring us into that place
[1:05:35] of his of the positioning of what we are
[1:05:38] to be and where we are to be in the very
[1:05:41] economy of God. All right.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Now, when you look at this, that God
[1:05:46] might dwell, the purpose is that he
[1:05:48] might dwell. And Moses was faithful in
[1:05:52] all of this, even to the instruments
[1:05:55] that were made in there, all that were
[1:05:58] to be kept and everything that was to be
[1:06:01] done. Let me tell you, it was a
[1:06:02] reflection of the heavenly pattern
[1:06:04] through earthly elements.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. There's no
[1:06:10] doubt there's better people upon this
[1:06:11] earth. There's people that you may not
[1:06:13] even be able to put your finger on their
[1:06:15] life. They might be ever so good. I want
[1:06:18] to remind you, Esau was a much better
[1:06:21] man than Jacob.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; But you see, Esau was not considered in
[1:06:28] the election. You know why? God already
[1:06:30] knew what Esau would do. Esau rejected
[1:06:33] the birthright. He thought little of the
[1:06:36] presence of God that was in his midst.
[1:06:39] That's why brother Brandon said in the
[1:06:40] message desperation he said Brandham
[1:06:42] tabernacle you better take heed the
[1:06:45] birthright is among you and if you don't
[1:06:48] recognize it'll pass right through here
[1:06:51] and you'll be left behind. You see the
[1:06:53] birthright is the presence of God that's
[1:06:56] coming through the word the name of
[1:06:59] Jesus Christ that brings sons and
[1:07:01] daughters of God into a real birth to
[1:07:04] where you're not reflecting a church.
[1:07:06] You're not reflecting a doctrine. You're
[1:07:08] not reflecting a man, but it's Christ
[1:07:11] that is establishing himself in your
[1:07:14] heart and your life.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We're not Brandhams.
[1:07:19] We're Christians.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; God used his servant, the prophet, to be
[1:07:24] able to do what? Reflect Jesus Christ
[1:07:27] into the church of the living God.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you thankful?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; So, when we when we see this, I want you
[1:07:35] to notice how Paul would write it. For
[1:07:37] through him, through Christ, we both
[1:07:40] have access by one spirit unto the
[1:07:43] Father. Now therefore, ye are no more
[1:07:46] strangers and foreigners, but fellow
[1:07:49] citizens with the saints and of the
[1:07:52] household of God, and are built upon the
[1:07:55] same foundation of the apostles and
[1:07:57] prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:08:01] chief cornerstone. Do you realize that
[1:08:04] we have been given the privilege to have
[1:08:07] the same experience
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; that what they had on the day of
[1:08:12] Pentecost?
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; We have been privileged to come and to
[1:08:16] be a part of that same foundation. Now
[1:08:19] let me just tell you what a foundation
[1:08:20] does. This foundation it is not liable
[1:08:23] to be overthrown. It cannot crumble. It
[1:08:26] cannot pass away. This foundation is the
[1:08:29] revelation of Jesus Christ. It is a
[1:08:32] solid rock. It's not shifting sands.
[1:08:35] It's not one way one day and another way
[1:08:37] the next day. But it is a solid firm
[1:08:41] foundation.
[1:08:43] It is an anchor that holds within the
[1:08:46] veil. So in other words, when Christ
[1:08:49] himself has brought you and I into this
[1:08:52] place, this foundation into the holiest
[1:08:55] of holies where Christ sets down and
[1:08:58] tabernacles himself in your life, it is
[1:09:01] the same Holy Spirit in 11 hour 11th
[1:09:05] hour workers that you're receiving the
[1:09:08] same reality of the same Holy Ghost that
[1:09:12] was poured out on the day of Pentecost.
[1:09:14] You are receiving that same reality that
[1:09:18] they received back there.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, what do you say? You
[1:09:22] don't know the time that we're living
[1:09:24] in. But I'm telling you, God made a
[1:09:26] promise that when the enemy would raise
[1:09:28] up and ride like a flood, he said, "I'll
[1:09:31] raise up the standard." You know how God
[1:09:33] raises the standard? He makes his word
[1:09:36] more real. He makes it sure. And the way
[1:09:38] that God raises the standard, he spoke
[1:09:41] it in the Garden of Eden. It became
[1:09:43] flesh there in there of the tabernacle
[1:09:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And then it
[1:09:48] became sure by him pouring out the Holy
[1:09:51] Spirit into our lives. That's how God
[1:09:54] makes his word sure. This is why as an
[1:09:56] individual when we've come to that
[1:09:58] foundation, you can never be talked out
[1:10:00] of it.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You cannot be bought
[1:10:05] out of it because you are already a
[1:10:07] surrendered vessel. You are a part of
[1:10:11] the substructure.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Now watch this in verse 21. In whom all
[1:10:18] the building fitly framed together
[1:10:22] groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.
[1:10:25] So there's a growing. Jesus said, "Upon
[1:10:27] this rock I'll build my church." So it's
[1:10:30] growing. So that that the body of Christ
[1:10:34] as we're looking at in this hour, it
[1:10:36] looks more like him. As a matter of
[1:10:38] fact, not just looking more, but in this
[1:10:41] hour, it's the hour where Christ and his
[1:10:44] bride is to be united.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; This is where the promise of the
[1:10:50] marriage of the lamb has come. So in
[1:10:52] here where where the body through that
[1:10:54] of Luther, it was looking more like it
[1:10:56] through Wesley looking a little bit more
[1:10:58] like it. And through that of the
[1:11:00] restoration of gifts, the return of the
[1:11:02] baptism of the Holy Spirit upon upon the
[1:11:04] people, it was looking more like that
[1:11:07] original seed that went in the ground.
[1:11:10] But it was not to stop there. That seed
[1:11:13] has to come from the shuck and Christ
[1:11:16] must reproduce himself through a bride
[1:11:19] body. Once again, I'm going to tell you
[1:11:21] who oversaw this. It's God who has
[1:11:24] overseen the church all the way down
[1:11:26] through the ages. It is God that has
[1:11:29] pressed himself through through all the
[1:11:31] unbelief, through all the isms, but his
[1:11:33] word cannot fail.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It groweth. It growth unto a
[1:11:42] holy temple in the Lord. I want to say
[1:11:44] that not only is this for that of the
[1:11:46] entire bride body all the way down
[1:11:48] through the ages, but this is an
[1:11:51] expression of us even as individuals
[1:11:54] that our lives are to grow. You see, God
[1:11:58] just when he comes and he fills the
[1:12:01] temple, he he fills it with his
[1:12:03] presence. The temple was put in service
[1:12:06] by his coming. You understand what I'm
[1:12:09] saying? Without the pillar of fire
[1:12:11] coming down upon the mercy seat, it
[1:12:13] would have been pointless to be offering
[1:12:15] a bulock. It would have been pointless
[1:12:17] to be, you know, kindling a fire. It
[1:12:19] have been pointless for that. Even
[1:12:20] though they didn't kindle the fire, but
[1:12:22] it would have been pointless. They could
[1:12:24] have went through all the ceremonialism,
[1:12:26] but without the pillar of fire present,
[1:12:29] none of the service would be received.
[1:12:32] But when the pillar of fire comes, it's
[1:12:35] him that puts that tabernacle into
[1:12:38] service and ordains those that are
[1:12:41] called to serve in the body.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; In position.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; So I want to say this, that's why the
[1:12:49] Holy Spirit has come. It comes to put
[1:12:50] you and I into service. He comes to
[1:12:54] operate through our lives. In whom also
[1:12:57] ye are builded together for inhabitation
[1:13:00] of God through the spirit. Now in
[1:13:04] Colossians 1 18 it said he is the head
[1:13:08] of the body, the church who is the
[1:13:11] beginning, the firstborn from the dead
[1:13:14] that in all things he might have the
[1:13:16] preeminence. He wants the preeminence.
[1:13:19] This is why he will not share it. He
[1:13:22] doesn't want it. He doesn't want to
[1:13:24] share it. In other words, Jesus is not
[1:13:26] going to come in and cohabitate.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus will not do that. He's got The
[1:13:32] only way that he comes, he comes into a
[1:13:35] vessel that is surrendered, that is
[1:13:37] yielded, and that he himself has
[1:13:40] sanctified with his own blood.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Right? Now, notice within this, I want
[1:13:46] you to listen to this. The prophet tells
[1:13:48] us in Christ the mystery said, "What was
[1:13:50] Jesus manifested for?" to show God. He
[1:13:53] was God. He had to be. No man could die.
[1:13:56] No prophet could die. He was God. He was
[1:13:58] the God of the prophets. He was the
[1:13:59] prophets. He was the kings. He was the
[1:14:01] history. He was he that was to come. He
[1:14:03] that was, he that is, he that's to be in
[1:14:06] this day, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:14:08] forever. He was manifested for that
[1:14:11] purpose. Now, I want you to think when
[1:14:13] he manifested himself. Jesus was that
[1:14:17] that he as John would write in John 1,
[1:14:20] he hath declared him. All of the
[1:14:22] prophets did in part, but not one of the
[1:14:26] prophets declared him in fullness.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But they each had their
[1:14:32] part. But when he came, he was the
[1:14:35] complete expression of God because he
[1:14:39] was God. It was not just in light.
[1:14:41] Remember different ones. Who do you say
[1:14:43] that I am? Some say you're Elijah. Some
[1:14:44] say you're this, some say you're that.
[1:14:46] But but he said, "Who do you say that I
[1:14:48] am? Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:14:51] living God." Now, even after he when
[1:14:55] when he he he fulfilled the word by
[1:14:57] going to Calvary. And the disciples
[1:14:59] remember their minds were veiled to even
[1:15:01] understand uh uh that part and that
[1:15:04] working of it in that hour. Even though
[1:15:06] they knew the promises, knew what had to
[1:15:08] be, but it took Christ in coming, the
[1:15:11] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, the one
[1:15:14] who had fulfilled every word. And when
[1:15:17] he came among them, he be to confirm to
[1:15:20] them the word concerning himself. He
[1:15:23] took them clear back to Moses. He began
[1:15:25] there in Genesis and brought them all
[1:15:28] the way down into a present moment for
[1:15:32] that junction that they were standing
[1:15:34] at. Because now the junction that they
[1:15:36] were standing at is the sacrifice has
[1:15:39] been offered. That sacrifice has been
[1:15:42] received. And now it is to prepare
[1:15:45] vessels to go in to receive that of the
[1:15:49] Holy Spirit.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's what Calvary was all about.
[1:15:53] Calvary never came to make good church
[1:15:55] members.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Calvary never came to make feel-good
[1:15:58] stories. Calvary came to lay hold on
[1:16:02] redemption. Let me tell you, Calvary was
[1:16:04] a battleground. There was a battleground
[1:16:06] in Gethsemane. There was a battle that
[1:16:09] was going on. There was war that was
[1:16:11] taking place. Satan was trying his best
[1:16:14] to keep the Lord Jesus away and to just
[1:16:17] simply take uh everything without
[1:16:20] suffering. But he couldn't take it
[1:16:22] without suffering. If he did, it would
[1:16:25] still be earmarked.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; But this is why he stood there. He was
[1:16:30] tempted. He was tested. The prophet said
[1:16:33] he was tempted to take it without
[1:16:35] suffering.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; You know why he did that? He also did
[1:16:39] that for you and I.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He did that for you and I. No, we would
[1:16:43] come in to certain places and
[1:16:45] temptations in our life where there's
[1:16:47] things that could be an easier way and
[1:16:49] we could be offered an easier way. But
[1:16:52] he withtood it so that now in your life
[1:16:55] he will stand in the midst of your life
[1:16:59] as a prevailing conqueror
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; and influence our lives. I say God be
[1:17:05] the sole influence.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Be the sole influence Lord in our lives.
[1:17:10] Now he said now through that purpose he
[1:17:13] achieved a church that he the fullness
[1:17:16] of God might bring to pass every
[1:17:18] promised word of God in these last days.
[1:17:21] when he gets the preeminence preeminence
[1:17:23] in the church the position his place in
[1:17:27] the church he said oh he wants to get
[1:17:29] somebody that can so see it that they
[1:17:32] can let the word now listen the the the
[1:17:34] reality of seeing it is when the word
[1:17:39] actually moves through our lives
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; see wants to get somebody that can so
[1:17:44] see it to recognize what it's not just
[1:17:46] to see well I've got all the doctrine
[1:17:48] right and I've got all this lined up and
[1:17:49] I can explain that all of those things.
[1:17:52] Your person can have all of that and
[1:17:53] they're not really seeing what it's
[1:17:55] really all about.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Remember to really see what it's all
[1:18:00] about is to really see him and to
[1:18:03] recognize our littleness.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; You know what the problem was with the
[1:18:09] Pharisees? Too much knowit all.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; That was the problem with the Jews. Know
[1:18:14] it alls.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; They knew too much,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; right? Who are you to tell me? Who are
[1:18:20] you to tell us? Who are you to tell?
[1:18:21] They were too much knowit all. That's
[1:18:24] what Paul said. He said, "They
[1:18:26] themselves have held on to their own
[1:18:28] righteousness instead of submitting to
[1:18:31] the righteousness of Christ."
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look at this. You
[1:18:36] remember even when you're you're
[1:18:38] thinking of that, what a listen friends,
[1:18:39] what a blessed thing it is to have a
[1:18:41] submissive heart.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You know, in order to have a submissive
[1:18:45] heart, it takes the Holy Ghost because
[1:18:47] you are your own biggest enemy. That's
[1:18:48] right.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; You can't even get along with yourself,
[1:18:51] much less with some other people.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends, we might have an
[1:18:56] answer right there.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; I said we might have an answer right
[1:18:59] there. That might explain why some
[1:19:01] people are so contankerous. Oh, you
[1:19:03] can't touch them. You ruffle their
[1:19:05] feathers. You know why? Because they've
[1:19:07] never even received a new heart.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. We can rejoice and Oh,
[1:19:15] I I believe I listen. I believe in
[1:19:17] rejoicing. But the rejoicing ought to be
[1:19:20] from what the reality of Jesus Christ is
[1:19:24] in our soul.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Because when everything else is going
[1:19:28] aside, there is a rejoicing that stands
[1:19:31] in our life.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory. Aren't you glad you came to
[1:19:36] church this morning?
[1:19:39] Notice he said Jesus so seen it and was
[1:19:42] so perfectly born for the day until God
[1:19:45] expressed every move that he made. He
[1:19:48] was God's revelation. God revealed.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he says, think about how he
[1:19:54] sanctified with his spirit and blood a
[1:19:56] church that he might make every promise
[1:19:58] in this last day revealed. I want you to
[1:20:01] think of this. It's not us that is
[1:20:04] fulfilling the word. It's Christ in you
[1:20:08] the hope of glory. It's Christ
[1:20:10] fulfilling his own word through your
[1:20:13] life. Your life. My life. Surrender. I
[1:20:16] in myself. I can do nothing.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; But what the what I see the father doing
[1:20:21] that doeth the son likewise. That's
[1:20:24] letting him have preeminence. You see?
[1:20:26] Oh, how the holy spirit comes to
[1:20:28] dissolve that old Sarahi.
[1:20:31] Sarahi had a lot of things to offer up.
[1:20:34] Oh, offer. Oh, take this way. Take that
[1:20:37] way. But you know what? God doesn't need
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; any man's way.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; He doesn't even need He doesn't need our
[1:20:46] our opinion about it.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He doesn't need that. He
[1:20:52] only simply he needs is surrendered
[1:20:55] vessels that realize, wait a minute
[1:20:57] here. I don't have to struggle.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I don't have to try to press myself. All
[1:21:03] I have to do is yield to his word
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; and allow him to bring his word to pass.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; You know, that's what God had to bring
[1:21:12] Abraham to. God had to let Abraham's
[1:21:15] stream dry up.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; There would have been more than just one
[1:21:19] Ishmael running around. But God let
[1:21:22] Abraham get to the end of himself
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; to where it was no longer could Abraham
[1:21:30] even be of an assistance in any way
[1:21:34] trying to bring the promise to pass.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; And God brings has brought and brings
[1:21:40] every one of us into that place of where
[1:21:43] we recognize it's not you and I that can
[1:21:46] live a Christian life. It's not you and
[1:21:48] I that can cross the tees and dot the
[1:21:51] eyes, but it's got to come by Christ
[1:21:54] himself, a creation on the inside where
[1:21:57] our faith rises to receive that finished
[1:22:01] work that he did it for me and accept
[1:22:03] it.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God that that stream
[1:22:08] of life dies up.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because that's actually
[1:22:12] the problem.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Our own strength is the problem.
[1:22:18] Right? That that's the problem. That's
[1:22:20] the problem even when it comes God
[1:22:21] bringing his word to pass. But see,
[1:22:23] notice what God does. He brings his
[1:22:26] word. What's he doing with this
[1:22:27] revelation? He's bringing his children
[1:22:30] into a place of rest and yielding to him
[1:22:35] that he might fulfill his word through
[1:22:39] his children.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of this.
[1:22:43] God came that he might dwell in man.
[1:22:46] That's why when God changed himself from
[1:22:49] the pillar of fire to become a man for
[1:22:53] redemption that he now it would be an
[1:22:56] acting through man of all that he was
[1:22:59] his nature. This is why when Peter and
[1:23:02] John were there and you know after they
[1:23:06] were taken you know captive because
[1:23:08] after the thing at the gate called
[1:23:10] beautiful remember they knew these men
[1:23:13] were ignorant unlearned. The Bible says
[1:23:14] they were ignorant, unlearned,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; but they took knowledge the Bible said
[1:23:18] they had been with Jesus.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you, it wasn't
[1:23:22] because they walked like him,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because they could talk like
[1:23:27] him as far as had his vernacular.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; But what what it is, they knew they had
[1:23:33] been with Jes. The same life.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Is that not what God told Peter when
[1:23:39] Peter and them were set free? It said,
[1:23:41] "Go stand in the temple and speak to
[1:23:43] them the words concerning this life."
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Their lives were an expression of the
[1:23:50] life of God that had come. Oh my. Peter
[1:23:53] was loose from everything that had ever
[1:23:56] been down through his family tree. Peter
[1:23:58] had an authority in his life that no
[1:24:01] matter what would try to come upon him
[1:24:03] from the family tree. He could stand
[1:24:05] there with a resistance and be able to
[1:24:08] say, "Get behind me, Satan."
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because that's the power
[1:24:14] of the abstract. It cuts you away from
[1:24:17] your former first tree.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; It raises you in the victory of Calvary.
[1:24:23] And then like the prophet said, you now
[1:24:25] are in the strain of God's predestinated
[1:24:28] channel. It's Christ himself that's
[1:24:31] living and pulsating through your life.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, you mean there may
[1:24:35] not be genes in my life? You mean there
[1:24:37] might be things back in here and all the
[1:24:40] way down? What I'm saying to you is is
[1:24:41] that you are no longer the tail, but now
[1:24:44] you're the head.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Don't have to live in fear. You don't
[1:24:50] have to wonder, oh this this is this
[1:24:52] haunting my family tree. You know, you
[1:24:54] don't even have to live and say, well,
[1:24:55] you know, my daddy was an adulterer. My
[1:24:58] mama was an adulteress or this or that.
[1:25:00] But you can stand with the grace of God
[1:25:02] in your life and say, "Not me. The cycle
[1:25:06] has been broke right here."
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; How can you say that? By the authority
[1:25:13] of Jesus Christ. It ain't the word
[1:25:16] hyping you and I up. It's the word
[1:25:18] bringing a reality. You have been
[1:25:21] redeemed.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that, don't you?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Don't don't don't look
[1:25:30] back to Well, you know, this is how
[1:25:31] things were in this. I know we are sons
[1:25:34] and daughters of God.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I know we still walk in this
[1:25:38] flesh, but let me remind you, it's a
[1:25:40] rising of the sun. He said that little
[1:25:42] girl, it was epilepsy through her
[1:25:44] family. But when the Holy Ghost has
[1:25:46] come, it is the abstract to the title D.
[1:25:49] It breaks Satan's hold of epilepsy on
[1:25:53] that child.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, not only does he take
[1:25:57] care of your sin, take care of your
[1:25:59] soul, but he also takes care of your
[1:26:01] body.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Boo boo. tormentor.
[1:26:14] Glory be to God. Hallelujah. This now we
[1:26:19] are his tabernacle. A body hast thou
[1:26:22] prepared me. Notice when he came into
[1:26:25] this earth.
[1:26:27] Hebrews tells us a body hast thou
[1:26:30] prepared for me. Remember Solomon built
[1:26:32] him a temple. But remember, Steven would
[1:26:35] pick this up and say even according to
[1:26:37] the expression that would come in that
[1:26:40] hour, even when Solomon would build the
[1:26:42] temple and how God would unfold that
[1:26:44] through Nathan and David would prepare,
[1:26:46] he would lay up for it. Do you realize
[1:26:48] that all the way down through this hour,
[1:26:50] there has been those that's gone before
[1:26:52] us, even that's been down through the
[1:26:54] ages that even in this hour has prepared
[1:26:57] that you and I might be where we're at
[1:27:00] right now. There has been faithful men
[1:27:03] and women.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, what are you talking
[1:27:07] about? I'm telling you that the lamb had
[1:27:08] seven horns.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And those seven horns are the lamb's
[1:27:12] protection on earth. It's how he
[1:27:14] protects his rights. How does he protect
[1:27:16] his rights? Through a holy ghostfilled
[1:27:20] people.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; It's God protecting and preserving his
[1:27:24] rights. And so down through the ages,
[1:27:27] each one has made a way for the other to
[1:27:30] where that in this hour, just like
[1:27:32] Elijah and Jeremiah, Mo all the way down
[1:27:35] were all portions of him that was coming
[1:27:38] to reflect him in that hour. And he was
[1:27:41] the reflection of all of those parts
[1:27:44] come together that it was Christ. And
[1:27:47] now in the end time he has once again he
[1:27:51] has gathered up with every one of these
[1:27:53] seven portions, seven lights. It is
[1:27:56] Christ that has returned once again in
[1:27:59] the fullness of his word where the
[1:28:01] pillar of fire is now among the church
[1:28:04] of the living God. Never could any other
[1:28:07] age say that but this age. This is the
[1:28:10] age that was promised that the evening
[1:28:12] light would return to the church of the
[1:28:15] living God.
[1:28:16] Do you love him this morning?
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I say thank you, Lord God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know why? Because it's a time
[1:28:23] of completion.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Revelations 10, the
[1:28:29] whole point in the descending there of
[1:28:31] that angel, that mighty angel with an
[1:28:34] open book in his hand, remember it was
[1:28:37] seven thunders that uttered their voice.
[1:28:40] God revealing his redemption plan,
[1:28:44] driving out. You know what? Let me tell
[1:28:46] you what drives out fear. The revelation
[1:28:48] of the word.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; You know what unmuddles your mind? The
[1:28:52] revelation of the word. You know what
[1:28:54] knocks fear out of your life of fa. Oh,
[1:28:57] I might fail or I might fall. You know
[1:28:58] what does that? The revelation of the
[1:29:01] word. That's why the preaching of this
[1:29:04] message that God sent to you and I is
[1:29:07] not just something to have on your phone
[1:29:09] is not just something to have in a book
[1:29:12] or in a tape. It's to live inside of
[1:29:15] your life. It's that perfect love that
[1:29:18] cast out fear.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You feel down? Put it on.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Put it on and watch
[1:29:28] the atmosphere change because it's the
[1:29:30] same God that brought this message is
[1:29:33] the same one who brought that change in
[1:29:36] Genesis 1. You want to change the
[1:29:38] atmosphere in your life? Invite the word
[1:29:41] of God into your life. He's a lifegiver.
[1:29:45] He's a sustainer. He's a restorer. He's
[1:29:48] a quickener. He's a deliverer.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother Samuel. That's
[1:29:58] lifting him up off a high. You can't
[1:29:59] lift Jesus Christ up too high.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; A body hast thou prepared for me? God
[1:30:09] dwells in the stature of man reflecting
[1:30:13] himself
[1:30:15] into that being.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; That's perfect worship. God in us being
[1:30:21] his tabernacle,
[1:30:23] God manifesting.
[1:30:25] So the perfect worship, complete
[1:30:28] worship, it's not just even though how
[1:30:31] we raise our hands in worship,
[1:30:34] that's all part of it.
[1:30:36] But perfect worship is where now
[1:30:40] we come under the shed blood of the lamb
[1:30:43] and Christ coming to dwell on the
[1:30:47] inside. And here we are gathered
[1:30:52] in the chosen place of worship
[1:30:55] in his name.
[1:30:58] The only place that he'll recognize
[1:31:00] worship from. He won't recognize
[1:31:04] worship. Remember the other gates,
[1:31:07] Deuteronomy 12, Deuteronomy 16. God
[1:31:09] said, "I gave you those other gates for
[1:31:11] temptation.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; They were tempted in those other gates."
[1:31:15] But God will not receive worship in the
[1:31:18] Baptist gate, Pentecostal gate. God will
[1:31:22] not receive worship in the doctrines of
[1:31:25] men. God only receives worship in one
[1:31:28] place. That's in Jesus Christ.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Who is the word. Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And see, this is why that the pillar of
[1:31:34] fire, it cannot be a part of the pillar
[1:31:37] of fire dwelling within a person's life,
[1:31:39] the Holy Spirit, and would actually come
[1:31:41] out and disagree with the word or make
[1:31:45] light of a promise or put it off as
[1:31:47] though he's not the same. That would be
[1:31:50] that would be God arguing with himself.
[1:31:53] But the Holy Spirit is sent to punctuate
[1:31:56] every word of God.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And that that word would live through
[1:32:01] our lives.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think of this a
[1:32:03] powerful statement brother Brand makes
[1:32:05] in why Christ speak. He said, "There's
[1:32:06] only one church and you don't join it.
[1:32:08] You're born in it."
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And if you're born in it, the living God
[1:32:11] works himself through you. Who is it
[1:32:16] that's working himself? He is.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; It's not you and me.
[1:32:21] I'm gonna I'm going to make this come to
[1:32:24] pass.
[1:32:25] It's not in your struggle.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; It's not in your trying or your efforts.
[1:32:30] It's in your surrender.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Can you surrender to the word? Brother
[1:32:36] Bram said it like this in the dedication
[1:32:38] of a church building. He said, "What it
[1:32:39] is?" He said, "Ephesus only had 12
[1:32:41] people." He said, "So it ain't about the
[1:32:43] number that you have." He said it's the
[1:32:46] surrender you have where the truth is
[1:32:49] preached and finds the bedding ground in
[1:32:52] the hearts of the people is received and
[1:32:56] then it reacts back. So it isn't you
[1:33:01] reacting, it's you and I as a bedding
[1:33:04] ground and the word finding its place in
[1:33:07] our life and now reacting back. So it's
[1:33:12] not it's not you, it's not me. Well,
[1:33:15] this is what God meant. This is what But
[1:33:17] it's God who's interpreting his own
[1:33:20] word.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Who was it that interpreted a virgin
[1:33:24] shall conceive?
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It's God. It's not man. It's God
[1:33:31] interpreting his word through our lives.
[1:33:34] Or does what does he need? He just needs
[1:33:36] a yielded vessel. He needs a vessel
[1:33:38] where he himself can actually sit down
[1:33:41] in the sanctuary of your soul. That part
[1:33:44] that he has reserved for himself where
[1:33:47] he can sit down in there and his
[1:33:50] presence would emanate through our lives
[1:33:52] and actually be the source of influence
[1:33:55] over every instrument
[1:33:58] in our lives. All right.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; He works himself through you,
[1:34:05] making himself known. That's where God
[1:34:08] dwells
[1:34:10] in his church. God goes to church every
[1:34:13] day. My my my
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; just lives in church. Well, what is
[1:34:19] church? Church is not just a building.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Church is the called out.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been called out and set
[1:34:29] aside. And it's Christ who is right here
[1:34:31] in his church.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You see, church is not just something
[1:34:35] that's to be turned on and turned off.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; But the reality, you are called the
[1:34:41] church of the living God. How are you
[1:34:44] called the church of the living God? Is
[1:34:45] it because of your proclamation? Not
[1:34:48] whatsoever. It is God himself that has
[1:34:51] his presence has come into your life and
[1:34:54] you now are a witness of his grace.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Your life is a testimony from the
[1:35:01] innermost part of your life. You are no
[1:35:04] longer the same. You are a new creation
[1:35:07] in Christ Jesus.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. This message is
[1:35:11] not a self-help program.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; This message is not a socialization.
[1:35:17] This message is not a movement. This
[1:35:20] message is God.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; It's Christ himself revealed to you and
[1:35:26] I personally.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; It's the path to the blood to fellowship
[1:35:31] back to being sons and daughters of God.
[1:35:33] You might say, "Well, I've tried." Well,
[1:35:35] let me just tell you something. What God
[1:35:37] wants is the strength in your life to
[1:35:39] yield to his presence. And you let him
[1:35:42] take you to the Holy Ghost. He'll He
[1:35:44] knows how to take you there. He knows
[1:35:46] how to take care of the things in your
[1:35:48] life.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; God goes to church every day. He just
[1:35:56] lives in church.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; He lives in you. You're his church. You
[1:36:02] are his church. You are the tabernacle
[1:36:05] that God dwells in. You are the church
[1:36:09] of the living God yourself. Right?
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And if the living God lives in his
[1:36:16] living being,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; then your action is of God.
[1:36:23] If it don't, then God isn't in there. So
[1:36:27] what are we watching? Actions.
[1:36:31] Actions.
[1:36:33] We watch the display. How did they know
[1:36:37] if everything was okay
[1:36:39] with Aaron?
[1:36:42] When he went in
[1:36:44] all the way in on that time of the
[1:36:46] cleansing of the sanctuary once a year,
[1:36:50] how did they know? He had bells and
[1:36:52] pomegranates
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; on the bottom of his garment.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And when though when he would walk, it
[1:36:57] would make a noise.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Now, they knew if you stop hearing
[1:37:06] noise,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; they had a rope.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Pull them out.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. I'd have to go look it
[1:37:13] back up. Brother Bill's the one that
[1:37:14] sent me the statistic of how that you
[1:37:16] had so many during a certain period of
[1:37:17] time, they had to be pulled out.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; You know why? They weren't living
[1:37:22] consecrated lives.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; And they went in there and had to be
[1:37:26] pulled out. But you see, there's a life
[1:37:29] that's to be expressed. It's not you and
[1:37:31] I. It's not all the noise we could make.
[1:37:33] Let me just say this to you. You can
[1:37:35] make all the noise in the world. You
[1:37:37] could have all But let me just tell you
[1:37:38] something. What people are watching is
[1:37:41] your life.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; You know, it isn't even in this hour.
[1:37:45] It's not I I I I believe God brings us
[1:37:48] to a place to realize for the church of
[1:37:49] the living God. We're no we're not
[1:37:51] enamored with gifts, whether it's
[1:37:52] ministerial or nine spiritual gifts.
[1:37:54] What we want to see is is what is the
[1:37:56] life? Because the life behind it, it is
[1:38:00] the expression of what is the seed life
[1:38:03] that's in that bedding ground.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because remember when the
[1:38:07] Holy Spirit has come, he comes to
[1:38:10] quicken that part of himself on the
[1:38:12] inside that will direct us or as Paul
[1:38:15] would say, quicken your mortal body. In
[1:38:17] other words, our body becomes quickened
[1:38:20] because of the quickening power that has
[1:38:23] struck that soul and changed our nature.
[1:38:26] So now what is in the invisible which
[1:38:29] somebody else could say I could doubt
[1:38:31] that I could dispute this I could
[1:38:33] dispute that but you cannot dispute when
[1:38:36] the invisible is made visible.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I remember remember the man who was who
[1:38:41] was bound where they you know they put
[1:38:43] him they they let him down through the
[1:38:44] roof and they had him there. Remember
[1:38:46] that Jesus said, "Man, your sins be
[1:38:48] forgiven." You
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; right? Those Pharisees rose up and said,
[1:38:52] "Who in the world do you think you are?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Can forgive sins?" Jesus said, "That you
[1:38:58] might know
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; that the son of man hath power on earth
[1:39:03] to forgive sins."
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; See what was done in the invisible
[1:39:06] realm. He said to the man, "Take up thy
[1:39:08] bed and walk."
[1:39:10] You see the taking up his bed and
[1:39:12] walking was a confirmation of what had
[1:39:15] taken place in his life where his sins
[1:39:18] were forgiven.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; You understand? The prophet said when it
[1:39:23] is spoken, let there be light. He said
[1:39:25] many could dispute that. But once it is
[1:39:28] made light, there is no disputing any
[1:39:32] longer.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] Glory be to God. There was disputing
[1:39:41] when the Lord Jesus himself, he went
[1:39:44] down into hell. He went down there and
[1:39:46] he paid the price and he rose up. The
[1:39:48] prophet said for them 40 days, he said,
[1:39:51] "Oh, how there was a disputing, how
[1:39:53] there was a wondering, how Satan trying
[1:39:55] to challenge that." But when the day of
[1:39:57] Pentecost was fully come, it was God
[1:40:00] confirming his word. Not only had he
[1:40:02] raised,
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; but he sent back the same Holy Spirit.
[1:40:08] to raise up sons and daughters of God.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he did it?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:15] still the same?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that God sent a message
[1:40:18] in this hour to where that Jesus Christ
[1:40:21] has been lifted back up to the throne of
[1:40:23] worship?
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Been exalted.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Thank God. I'll tell you friends, thank
[1:40:30] God for his mercy. Notice this. Then God
[1:40:32] isn't in there. He wouldn't make you act
[1:40:34] like that when the word says in his
[1:40:36] blueprint, "Don't do this," and you go
[1:40:38] ahead and do it. When you deny it, that
[1:40:40] shows the life's not even in there. Now,
[1:40:44] let me just try to tie this up right
[1:40:46] here.
[1:40:48] Let me get to a point.
[1:40:50] The Bible says that the love of Christ
[1:40:53] constrains us
[1:40:55] because we thus judge that if one died
[1:40:57] for all, then we're all dead. and that
[1:41:00] he died for all that they which live
[1:41:03] should not henceforth live unto
[1:41:06] themselves but unto him which died for
[1:41:08] them and rose again.
[1:41:12] I think as believers we could say that's
[1:41:14] the greatest privilege that we have been
[1:41:15] given
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; to be able to live for him
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; to be freed
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; from in our own lives to be able to live
[1:41:24] for him. You see what it does when when
[1:41:26] God listen to me now. When the Holy
[1:41:28] Spirit has come and revealed himself to
[1:41:31] you, it'll draw out of you what it did
[1:41:34] on Paul at the road
[1:41:37] to Damascus. When he revealed himself
[1:41:40] that pillar of fire, he said, "Lord,
[1:41:44] what would you have me do?"
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; See, the Holy Spirit is drawing us to
[1:41:48] surrender to put us in service.
[1:41:51] And it's not what we're determining, but
[1:41:54] it's how God wants to operate through
[1:41:58] our lives as each has a part within this
[1:42:02] body. I don't whether you like it or
[1:42:05] not, you can't take this piece right
[1:42:08] here. God can't take that piece out
[1:42:11] there.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; All these pieces come together.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; It groweth together.
[1:42:18] Oh, God knows how we need in order to
[1:42:21] grow together. We need some real good
[1:42:23] mortar of the Holy Spirit.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; We need the mortar of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:28] bringing us together. Is that right?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. This what God would
[1:42:33] work in our life to bring us to that
[1:42:34] place to deliver us from self. Now,
[1:42:38] watch this in 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 5.
[1:42:41] Ye also as lively stones are built up a
[1:42:45] spiritual house
[1:42:48] and holy priesthood to offer up
[1:42:52] spiritual sacrifices
[1:42:55] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. So
[1:43:00] out outside of Jesus Christ outside of
[1:43:04] our offering coming through and by the
[1:43:07] blood it's not even accepted. You say,
[1:43:10] "Brother Samuel, scripture for that."
[1:43:12] God didn't accept even that of Cain's
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; worship.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; God didn't accept it. He rejected it.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Did Cain give a lot of effort? He did.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; It was will worship.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; There was things that he wanted to
[1:43:30] present to God. You know why he got so
[1:43:32] mad? He got so mad because God rejected
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; what all of his efforts had been able to
[1:43:39] achieve.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; It shows that no matter how beautiful a
[1:43:43] man's efforts could be, nothing can take
[1:43:46] the place of the shed blood of an
[1:43:49] innocent lamb.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Nothing nothing that you and I could
[1:43:54] ever do. But now through and by this we
[1:43:56] have been circumcised by the spirit of
[1:43:58] God to actually offer up spiritual
[1:44:01] sacrifices to God. Now, think of this.
[1:44:03] In the in the tabernacle, it was the
[1:44:05] Levites who were the ones that conducted
[1:44:09] service. They each had their own part.
[1:44:11] You had those that were singers. You had
[1:44:13] those that were a part of just kind of
[1:44:15] behind the scenes getting things
[1:44:16] together, making sure the meal was
[1:44:18] ready, making sure this was ready,
[1:44:20] making getting the shoe bread ready. You
[1:44:22] had each one had their part. So, what
[1:44:23] are you saying, brother Samuel? I'm
[1:44:24] saying that not one person did
[1:44:27] everything
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; in the tabernacle. That's right.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Moses making the shoebre. It
[1:44:33] wasn't Moses taking the sacrifice. Moses
[1:44:36] did his part. The pattern was given.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; The revelation was was dispensed
[1:44:44] among a body of believers.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And then from those body of believers of
[1:44:50] how that then through that of the
[1:44:52] Levites, they were God's chosen. God
[1:44:54] himself had procured or taken the
[1:44:57] Levites to himself. As a matter of fact,
[1:44:59] he would tell us that he lay all of the
[1:45:01] firstborn there in Egypt that he might
[1:45:03] take the Levites unto himself. So God
[1:45:07] already had in mind those that would
[1:45:10] serve within the tabernacle. Now, I
[1:45:13] don't know about you, but I'm just
[1:45:14] thankful to be in the body of Christ. I
[1:45:17] I don't It doesn't matter what it is to
[1:45:18] me. You know what? I I never even wanted
[1:45:20] to be a preacher. I never even want I I
[1:45:22] didn't want to be anything. I I didn't
[1:45:24] want You know what? I was so happy. As a
[1:45:26] matter of fact, when God first got a
[1:45:27] hold of my life, I didn't even want to
[1:45:28] get married.
[1:45:30] No, I wasn't funny either. Are you
[1:45:33] hearing me? I want funny. I'm just
[1:45:35] telling you that even within that, I was
[1:45:37] so thankful for what God had done in my
[1:45:40] life. That was just that that's all I
[1:45:42] wanted. It was my dad that had to put a
[1:45:44] little swift kick in my pants a little
[1:45:46] bit on that, you know, to help me to
[1:45:48] kind of see along because, you know,
[1:45:49] sometimes you can be not that my wife my
[1:45:51] wife a beautiful lovely lady, but I
[1:45:53] would just and she was the same way.
[1:45:55] You're just so taken with what God has
[1:45:58] done in your life. I never imagined that
[1:46:01] I would ever be able to live this kind
[1:46:03] of a life.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; I never I tried it. I tried it from
[1:46:08] youth camps. I tried it here. I tried it
[1:46:10] there. It was something that I found
[1:46:13] myself saying, "I cannot do it." But
[1:46:15] that's when God stepped in and said,
[1:46:18] "Son, I don't need your efforts. I just
[1:46:21] need the preeminence."
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And for me, oh my, that's my joy.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; That's never left me.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; It matter of fact, it just keeps going.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You just become like a w a
[1:46:37] walking sock bucket where where it's
[1:46:39] just dripping out and my the glory of
[1:46:41] God. It don't matter. You know, friends,
[1:46:43] you can live that kind of a life. You
[1:46:44] don't have to live a life of an old sour
[1:46:46] puss. You don't have to walk around with
[1:46:48] an old frown on your face. You can
[1:46:51] absolutely have a real experience with
[1:46:53] God. Let me tell you what the prophet
[1:46:55] said over and over. He said, "When you
[1:46:57] get the Holy Ghost, you'll be on a drunk
[1:46:59] from the hour you receive it to the hour
[1:47:02] you leave." Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; That ain't just talking about that
[1:47:06] you'll be running around. But let me
[1:47:07] just tell you something. You ever had a
[1:47:09] seen a man who was a drunk man?
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I've been around a number
[1:47:12] of them. Let me just tell you something.
[1:47:14] Drunk men all of a sudden will start
[1:47:16] putting their arms around their enemies.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Let's Let's drink one here.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's what they got inside of
[1:47:28] them. You see, that's the real thing.
[1:47:30] God's not trying to educate a group of
[1:47:32] people. He's not trying to reform us or
[1:47:36] conform us. He wants to transform our
[1:47:39] lives by the imparting of his own
[1:47:42] nature.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; I tell you what would do good is if we
[1:47:45] start hitting the bottle.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; That's what we need is a real good dose
[1:47:51] of the Holy Ghost. Let me tell you
[1:47:52] friends, that's a lot of the problem in
[1:47:54] people's lives is they've never been
[1:47:55] born again. I don't care how long
[1:47:56] they've sat around the message. I don't
[1:47:58] care how long they've known. I don't
[1:47:59] know how many quotes they know, how much
[1:48:01] scripture they know, but if they've
[1:48:02] never received the Holy Ghost, they are
[1:48:05] still the same as they always were with
[1:48:08] just a rotten religious covering.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; But religion will condemn you, but
[1:48:15] salvation will save your soul. It'll
[1:48:18] take care of that nature on the inside.
[1:48:21] It'll change you.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:28] spiritual sacrifices.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Let's stand,
[1:48:46] sacrifices.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Sacrifice. I think pretty much every one
[1:48:56] of us would know what that word
[1:48:59] sacrifice is.
[1:49:02] Sacrifice is not what's convenient.
[1:49:06] But sacrifice
[1:49:09] is just as it's implied. It requires
[1:49:11] something of us.
[1:49:15] How many know there's there's times you
[1:49:16] feel like praising the Lord.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; There's times you feel like worshiping.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:24] And then there's other times you're
[1:49:26] going through the heat of the battle.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; You're going through situations
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; that you don't feel
[1:49:33] like it.
[1:49:36] Come right in here. You pressed right on
[1:49:38] through to come to the house of God.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; You don't feel like it.
[1:49:42] You don't feel like it. You'd much
[1:49:43] rather just stay at home. I'll just I'll
[1:49:46] catch Brother Samuel streaming.
[1:49:48] But we need you here.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. You see, the prophet tells
[1:49:52] us that when more of the believers come
[1:49:56] together, it's more of the godhead
[1:49:58] bodily
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; among us.
[1:50:05] Ram says, "Oh, Brother Ram, I just don't
[1:50:08] feel like praising him." He said,
[1:50:10] "That's the time to do it. That's right.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Praise him. Anyhow,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; in the midst of your affliction, in the
[1:50:20] midst of what's going on in your life,
[1:50:23] spiritual sacrifices.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And it's not just when we're here in
[1:50:28] church.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; It's when we're walking.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; It's when through our lives, through on
[1:50:34] our jobs, through everywhere we go.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual sacrifice
[1:50:40] unto God. Yes.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, I love you.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to say thank you for your
[1:50:45] mercy.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been praying about a need
[1:50:48] within your life and still no answer has
[1:50:51] come, but you're still praising him.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for your mercies.
[1:50:57] Thank you for where you've brought me
[1:50:59] from. Thank you, Lord, that you have
[1:51:01] given me a way where you said to come
[1:51:04] before your throne of grace that I might
[1:51:06] find help in the time of trouble. Thank
[1:51:08] you Lord for your mercies Lord. Thank
[1:51:11] you Lord for healing my body. Thank you
[1:51:13] Lord God.
[1:51:16] Spiritual sacrifices.
[1:51:19] So there's times when this
[1:51:22] inside man who's been redeemed.
[1:51:26] He's the one that has to remind this
[1:51:29] body
[1:51:32] that as the body, you're not the Levite,
[1:51:36] but the Levite is inside of this temple.
[1:51:40] Christ, we're a chosen priesthood,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; A peculiar people, right? But as a
[1:51:48] peculiar people,
[1:51:50] God has given us power for service to do
[1:51:53] what? employ our hands,
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; employ our lips
[1:52:01] to employ our lives to give sacrifice
[1:52:05] unto him. Sometimes the sacrifice is not
[1:52:08] even raising your hand. Sometimes the
[1:52:11] greatest sacrifices you'll make is to
[1:52:14] let an offense pass right on by.
[1:52:20] Some of the greatest sacrifice is where
[1:52:22] you can have a right to hold something,
[1:52:26] but you as a priest make a sacrifice for
[1:52:30] what? For God.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not my own. I I could act like it,
[1:52:35] but I'm not my own. I'm his.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; And grudges and offenses, those things
[1:52:41] that don't belong in my spirit, don't
[1:52:43] belong in your spirit.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; You know what belongs in your spirit, in
[1:52:46] your body? the reflection of God's
[1:52:49] presence from the throne of your soul
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; where the blood
[1:52:58] coming there on the mercy seat in your
[1:53:00] life there in the soul and that
[1:53:02] fellowship with him to where his
[1:53:04] presence would so reflect through your
[1:53:06] life to where when you walk on the job
[1:53:08] wherever you go there's a Christian
[1:53:13] there's a Christian brother but Sam I
[1:53:15] don't want to make myself different. I'm
[1:53:18] not asking you to make yourself
[1:53:19] different.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; But what I am saying to you is the
[1:53:23] rapture is about for those that he has
[1:53:26] made a difference in.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; And if there's one thing that you want,
[1:53:31] friends,
[1:53:33] is you want that difference in your life
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; where it's no longer you that's living,
[1:53:38] but it's Christ who's living in you.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; You don't want religion. Religion will
[1:53:43] contaminate you. It'll affect you. It'll
[1:53:45] it can affect your family. It can affect
[1:53:47] everyone. You don't want religion.
[1:53:49] You want Jesus Christ.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Remember over and over the prophet would
[1:53:54] tell us not to know his word is life.
[1:53:57] But to know him,
[1:54:00] right? How many people came to brother
[1:54:01] Brandon, "Oh, brother Brandon, you don't
[1:54:02] know your Bible." He said, "Well,"
[1:54:07] he said, "you probably know it better
[1:54:08] than me." He said, "But I know the
[1:54:10] author."
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; And see, that's what matters.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. is to know the author.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And when you know the author on the
[1:54:17] inside, it's kind of like this. There
[1:54:20] was a a person at a book signing.
[1:54:24] And the thing of it is is that they were
[1:54:26] actually it wasn't them who was actually
[1:54:30] the author of the book, but they were
[1:54:31] kind of given, you know, when they'll do
[1:54:33] this at Borders and other places like
[1:54:34] that, and not that I've ever been there
[1:54:36] to listen to one of them, but you know,
[1:54:37] they they'll they'll go through there
[1:54:39] and they'll kind of give you their
[1:54:40] synopsis
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; on what the author was saying and
[1:54:45] they'll just do a do a book talk.
[1:54:49] And this man did a book talk and he had
[1:54:51] all these conclusions drawn of this
[1:54:53] book. And finally there's a man who
[1:54:55] stood up in this little gathering.
[1:54:58] And the man said, "Excuse me." He said,
[1:55:01] "That's not what the author meant at
[1:55:04] all."
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And the man who was doing the book talk
[1:55:07] said, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm the
[1:55:09] author."
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. It's not us giving a
[1:55:19] book talk,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; but you let the author come in.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; You let the author have the right away.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Let him have the rightway in every area
[1:55:26] of your life. Let the author, And you
[1:55:28] know what? He'll make the contents of
[1:55:30] the book real. He'll make it live just
[1:55:32] according to how he said it would.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Because he is the word.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, if there's anything
[1:55:41] that would be holding you back, anything
[1:55:42] that's hindering you at all, just just
[1:55:44] let it go.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Let it go. You don't have to wrestle
[1:55:47] with it. Let it go.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; If there's something that's keeping you
[1:55:51] back, something that's holding you, you
[1:55:54] don't have to go and do a do a bunch of
[1:55:56] pentance. Let it go.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; How can I let it go? Confess it.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Repent. Let it go. It's not worth
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; your soul.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; It's not worth liberty.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Nothing is worth it.
[1:56:16] nothing.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Let it go. You don't So you don't have
[1:56:20] to wrestle? No, you don't have to
[1:56:21] wrestle. Do I have to struggle? No. Let
[1:56:22] it go. Do you believe he's here?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Whatever that you have need of that same
[1:56:30] pillar of fire that we have spoke about
[1:56:33] and is in this building right here this
[1:56:35] morning that has directed me, anointed
[1:56:37] me, and anointed your hearts to be able
[1:56:39] to receive that same Holy Spirit that
[1:56:42] gave Moses the direction for the pattern
[1:56:44] of the tabernacle. That same Holy Spirit
[1:56:47] is right here with us
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; this morning.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; He's right here to do just exactly what
[1:56:54] he said in his word he will do.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; He's right here to give the baptism of
[1:56:58] the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; He's right here to change your life. But
[1:57:01] let me just say this to you. Will you
[1:57:04] accept it?
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Will you accept it? Will you receive it?
[1:57:08] What? Maybe it's something that that is
[1:57:10] hindered in your life. Maybe it's
[1:57:12] something that you've allowed to build
[1:57:13] up in your life. But can we in his
[1:57:16] presence
[1:57:17] say, "Lord,
[1:57:19] I let it go, Lord.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; I lay it down because you're worthy.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; You're worthy.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; You're worthy.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; You're worthy, Lord.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; He's worthy
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; to receive all riches, glory, power, and
[1:57:36] honor.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love him this morning.
[1:57:40] Hallelujah. Heavenly Father,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; thank you for your mercies, Lord, this
[1:57:46] morning.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Oh God, how our hearts, Lord, are just
[1:57:51] warmed,
[1:57:52] God, in your presence.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, now as you're here, Lord, among
[1:57:59] us,
[1:58:01] your word, Lord, as you've delivered
[1:58:03] your word, Lord, through the foolishness
[1:58:06] of preaching.
[1:58:09] And Lord, God would express
[1:58:12] your thoughts
[1:58:14] concerning our lives.
[1:58:17] Now Lord, I pray.
[1:58:20] May you move for every need that's in
[1:58:21] this building.
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:25] Lord, may the thoughts of God so strike
[1:58:27] every heart that if there's one, Lord,
[1:58:30] where the enemy has wanted to keep them,
[1:58:33] Lord, from their privileges, rights as a
[1:58:37] son and daughter of God, I pray this
[1:58:40] morning, Lord, that God, they've heard
[1:58:43] the ring
[1:58:45] of liberty,
[1:58:47] that voice would call to them, Lord,
[1:58:50] that they don't have to live there no
[1:58:52] longer.
[1:58:54] They don't have to live with regret.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; They don't have to live beneath their
[1:58:59] privileges,
[1:59:02] but they can rise in the grace of God.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[1:59:09] you're here, Father, to touch lives.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:59:15] how many times, Lord God, how your
[1:59:18] presence would come right among us. And
[1:59:20] Lord,
[1:59:22] if there's been any coolness
[1:59:25] that Lord has come into our lives, I'm
[1:59:27] so thankful, God,
[1:59:30] Lord God, that the great conviction of
[1:59:32] the Holy Spirit would sweep right around
[1:59:34] our hearts
[1:59:36] to remind us, my son, my daughter,
[1:59:39] I've called you
[1:59:41] to be my living image.
[1:59:46] As your prophet would tell us, we're to
[1:59:49] be your idol upon this earth.
[1:59:53] Lord, we're not an idol that is just
[1:59:56] placed without ears and eyes,
[2:00:01] but a living image
[2:00:04] that God that you would project yourself
[2:00:07] through our lives.
[2:00:09] Now Lord, I pray if there's any
[2:00:11] hindrances,
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:13] something Lord, where the enemy has
[2:00:15] wanted to get a foothold, maybe through
[2:00:18] indifference, sin, maybe it's
[2:00:21] affliction, disease.
[2:00:23] Lord, I know that many times when
[2:00:25] sickness has come, it comes with a
[2:00:27] tormenting spirit that would want to try
[2:00:30] to hinder and weaken. But I pray
[2:00:32] heavenly father in your presence Lord
[2:00:35] God. Lord we bring every need right now
[2:00:39] every request
[2:00:42] before the throne of almighty God. Lord
[2:00:45] God may you come Lord right here the
[2:00:47] same pillar of fire through every
[2:00:49] surrendered heart and life dear Lord
[2:00:51] God. And father deal Lord God with every
[2:00:54] indifference. deal Lord God with Lord
[2:00:57] every hold where the enemy would want to
[2:00:59] try to put upon a life Lord maybe
[2:01:01] through a complex offense whatever it
[2:01:03] might be Lord God your grace is
[2:01:07] sufficient Lord
[2:01:09] granted Lord
[2:01:12] may you move Lord I pray God
[2:01:15] break every hold Lord break every chain
[2:01:18] Lord God for you are the mighty
[2:01:20] conqueror who's rent the veil in two
[2:01:24] Lord God, you are worthy.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; We love you this morning. Lord, I pray
[2:01:29] that God, you would pour out of your
[2:01:31] spirit. Lord, may there be lives and
[2:01:33] hearts, Lord, this morning that God
[2:01:36] would leave from this moment and there
[2:01:38] would, Lord, arise a declaration in
[2:01:41] their lives, Lord. Not something, Lord,
[2:01:43] that God has just been something that
[2:01:45] they themselves have said, but it arises
[2:01:49] from within them, Lord, as they've,
[2:01:50] Lord, sat under the ministering of the
[2:01:52] word. and their hearts, Lord God, have
[2:01:55] become filled with the spirit of God
[2:01:57] that they can actually move in that
[2:02:00] place and say, "From that time, my life
[2:02:04] has been different. My desires changed.
[2:02:09] My appetite, my life, it's for Jesus
[2:02:12] Christ. All I want to do is please him.
[2:02:15] All I want to do is live for him. I want
[2:02:17] more. I want more of him.
[2:02:20] Granted, Lord God, I pray, Father, may
[2:02:23] there come, Lord, a refilling of the
[2:02:25] Holy Spirit in our lives, Lord. You're
[2:02:27] the one that equips us for service,
[2:02:29] Lord. Oh, God. Granted, Lord, I pray may
[2:02:34] Lord Jesus, there come a refilling of
[2:02:36] the spirit of God in our lives, Lord. a
[2:02:39] revival, Lord God, in our hearts, Lord,
[2:02:41] a fresh quickening of the spirit of God,
[2:02:44] Lord Jesus, that all trash, everything
[2:02:49] that's unlike you, Lord God, would be
[2:02:52] washed out of these waters, Lord God,
[2:02:56] that our lives could be, Lord, an
[2:02:58] unhindered expression and reflection of
[2:03:02] the glory of God. Granted, Lord,
[2:03:06] grant it, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:08] In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:12] Amen. And amen.
[2:03:15] Hallelujah.

[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:24] Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] Hallelujah.
[2:15:28] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so thankful, Amen, for what
[2:15:40] how the Lord has touched Sister Na's
[2:15:43] life. And um
[2:15:46] I think it's been a couple months ago,
[2:15:48] two or three months ago.
[2:15:50] Um, I thought in one way that I
[2:15:53] recognized her, but then um
[2:15:57] it was after the church that night. I
[2:15:58] remember when Sister Py, she grabbed me
[2:16:00] and Sister Py said, "Do you know who
[2:16:02] this is?" And I said, "Well, I I don't
[2:16:04] know exactly, but the last time really I
[2:16:06] had seen her, she was much younger, but
[2:16:08] we're so thankful how the Lord has has
[2:16:10] touched her life and for what what God
[2:16:13] has begun in her heart."
[2:16:15] And that's the thing that we just want
[2:16:17] to just look to God right here in this
[2:16:19] moment. That the same God that has
[2:16:21] touched her heart and brought her into
[2:16:23] that place of a of a repentance and to
[2:16:26] surrender her heart to God. That that
[2:16:28] same God knowing what his desire is is
[2:16:31] to fully tabernacle himself in the midst
[2:16:34] of her life. And that's that's the
[2:16:36] that's the real heart. That's this is
[2:16:38] why that even when we walk into the
[2:16:40] waters of baptism, it's what it's all
[2:16:42] about to take upon his name with that
[2:16:47] purpose and that desire is I want to be
[2:16:50] united
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; with him. I want that life. I want his
[2:16:54] life to be present in my life. I I don't
[2:16:56] want to no longer live my own life. I
[2:16:59] want to surrender my all to him. I thank
[2:17:02] God for his grace that brings us to that
[2:17:04] place. You know the Bible said it's the
[2:17:06] goodness of God that leads us to
[2:17:07] repentance.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; It's the very mercy of God that breaks
[2:17:11] the hold and brings conviction to our
[2:17:14] life to draw us to him with that purpose
[2:17:16] that he himself would totally clean our
[2:17:19] lives and dwell on the inside. Amen. You
[2:17:23] love him this morning.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to him in a word of
[2:17:25] prayer.
[2:17:27] Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray dear God,
[2:17:30] right here this morning, dear Lord God
[2:17:32] for our sister. Lord, you see, Father,
[2:17:34] that Lord, how that you have, Lord,
[2:17:37] touched her heart, Lord, there was a
[2:17:38] longing, Lord, that in her life, Lord
[2:17:41] God, that Father, even as she would,
[2:17:43] Lord, walk in these doors, Lord, on a
[2:17:45] Thursday night, Lord, some months ago,
[2:17:47] Lord God, and and Father, Lord, that
[2:17:50] it's you, dear Lord God, that Father,
[2:17:52] begin to touch her heart and work upon
[2:17:54] her life. Lord to bring her to that
[2:17:56] place Lord that the desire Lord is that
[2:17:59] you would just have the complete
[2:18:01] preeminence in her life Lord God that
[2:18:03] Father every part of her life that it
[2:18:05] would reflect you Lord God. I pray
[2:18:08] heavenly father that she stands here
[2:18:10] Lord God Lord Jesus in the faithfulness
[2:18:13] Lord of your word that you said Father
[2:18:15] through that of Peter that Lord if we
[2:18:17] repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:18:20] Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift
[2:18:22] of the Holy Ghost. Lord, I pray that God
[2:18:25] that Lord as she's walked into this
[2:18:27] waters, Lord God, oh Lord God, as a
[2:18:30] baptismal tank, but Lord, it's a
[2:18:32] graveyard, Lord God. Father, Lord, where
[2:18:34] there's a testimony, Lord, that's going
[2:18:36] forth. Lord, I I'm no longer going to
[2:18:38] live and walk in the same way. But Lord
[2:18:41] God, we've come here, Lord God, to bury,
[2:18:43] Lord, one, Lord God, that there would
[2:18:45] come forth a very newness of life within
[2:18:48] her life. I pray that God that you would
[2:18:50] meet her Lord God and may you completely
[2:18:53] change her life Lord God that your glory
[2:18:56] Lord might be reflected through her life
[2:18:59] as a redeemed vessel Lord God. Lord we
[2:19:02] ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:05] Amen.
[2:19:22] your confessionus
[2:19:25] Christ.
[2:19:27] I now baptize you in the name of the
[2:19:29] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:19:31] your sins.
