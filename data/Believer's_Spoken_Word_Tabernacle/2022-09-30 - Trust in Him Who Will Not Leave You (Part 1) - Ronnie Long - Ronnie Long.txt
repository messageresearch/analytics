the ship is rocking and the waves are coming we we know who's in the boat amen amen it's going to be the house of the Lord with you this evening and we thank God for his grace and Mercy bringing us through another week and we're here just to give our service to him amen now when he's feeling good in the Lord tonight man the devil's trying hard to to take our joy away but he he don't have enough you don't have enough to take the smile off a Believer you don't have enough to to take our uh our confidence away from the one who gave it to us amen thank the Lord for the songs and the Praises that were sung and we trusted um the pastor would be blessed there a wife's there so you can tell who she likes better as a preacher but you know we came straight from work so it was just worked out that way but if you have your Bibles return to the book of Nahum the first chapter and just wanna maybe if we can just encourage ourselves in the word tonight and as you have your Bibles open there maybe let's just if you have a need upon your heart just think about that need as we're opening that Holy Scripture and ask that the Lord would just abide with us father we thank you Lord for your grace and God how we lord we want to use every breath that we have to to give you praise father to give you honor and glory and Lord as we've come to this this the most important part of the service to open your word father to look thereon we ask that you would just come and Inspire it to our hearts father and Lord that you would just use this this text or this scripture father that it would encourage us father that it would give us faith and Lord but may your inspiration come into it Lord may it Quicken Quicken it to our hearts father and Lord we just dedicate ourselves to you afresh tonight father just ask that you would take all that we are father all of our being our strength our might father and that you would use it for your honor and Glory father we we know that we can do nothing in ourselves but it be by you father and Lord we just asked you would come have your way now with the service we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen fill your scripture to us nahim the first chapter in the seventh verse the Lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him amen may God bless his word he may be seated tonight the Lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him so tonight just for a text I want to take trust in him who will not leave you amen there's a there's a day of trouble around us there's a time of uncertainty for the world around us but we have an anchor amen we have we have a soulless we have we have something that we're looking to we're not we're not just hoping for it but we see a reality that this word is coming to pass before us and and we see all the negative parts of the of the prophecies coming to pass and that just reassures us as a believer that there is somebody going to fulfill the positive side of that prophecy that will trust in him in the day of trouble and he will be their Refuge you know I think many times the devil will try to get us um our eyes off of how Victorious we really are and it seems to be in this age and just visiting with different Believers and different ones and seemingly like last year maybe somebody that was on top of the mountain this year was just going through a gloomy patch or a valley and you know we have those times and we have those trials but we can never forget who we are in this world we can never forget where we're going after this that it's real easy to get caught up in just a a Monday to Friday grind and and and to forget who you really are and and the devil's real quick to remind you that you know you're just flashed and you're going to make a mistake and you're going to fall and you're not you're not you're not really doing what you're called to do but I think it's time to kick the devil out of our space I think it's time to kick the devil out of our home and out of our joy and out of our our Victory I believe that the the prophet of God said that we are his victory so in order for us to to take ourselves out of that Victory we're declaring that God is Not Victorious because we are his victory I believe that each and every one of us here tonight are the victory of Christ that he paid for on Calvary so if we take ourselves out of that we have now limited God to say that he wasn't enough or his sacrifice was enough but I know as Believers here tonight we're all in one Accord that it was enough to pay the penalty it was enough to pay the price but we've got to recognize that the day we're living in his whole his whole plan is resting on our success so he's not going to leave us but he's going to see us through all the way to the end I think we just need to remind ourselves we're trusting not in our own ability or in our own Merit but we're trusting in the one who said he would never leave us he'd never forsake us he'd never he'd never go away from us he'd never make us walk alone but he would be with us even in us to the very end amen I I believe that sometimes we we can put a good face on uh for the church member or put a good face on for the Sunday morning but many of us will fight private battles that no one else will ever know about him many times you'll you'll find yourself having to battle within yourself that that maybe your pastor doesn't know about or maybe your spouse doesn't know about her uh maybe your mama doesn't know about it but you're having an internal struggle within it but it's important to know where your trust is in you know if our trust was in the bank we'd be in bad shape today if our trust was in the stock market we'd be in bad shape if our if our trust was in in our own ability to do it we'd be in bad shape but our trust is in him who will not leave us he made us a promise he would not leave us in the day of trouble but he would be there to comfort us and to guide us and to lead us and when he the spirit of Truth has come he will lead us and guide us into all things and that includes Victory joy and overcoming power and quickening power and and a Rapture is included into all things I believe that's our goal that's our Strife but if we're not if we're not if we're not focusing on that the devil will take our focus and put it on very temporal things and we'll be kicking sand around wondering if we're really called or if we're really a Believer if we take our Focus off of this word so tonight I just want to encourage us a little not alone in your struggle but the devil would like every one of us to think that we're isolated in our anxiety or isolated in our depression and we're the only ones going through that but but the Bride of of Christ is being attacked more than ever in this day and age but we have a promise that we will overcome we will overcome cancer we will overcome anxiety we will overcome that depressive Spirit we will overcome diabetes we will overcome the the cares of this world we will overcome the fog of laodicea we will overcome by putting our trust in him who has already overcome he already overcome death that's the greatest weapon that Satan has is death itself and he already overcame it so for trust is in him whoever came it's not about how I can make it or if you have the ability brother Paul to make it but our trust is in him that's already made it he's already overcome he's already showed us away but but but I think in the scripture I was asking a brother some time ago I said is there someone in the scripture that you feel that maybe fought private battles that that maybe the people around him weren't privy to he said David immediately I said I was thinking the same thing yeah they even fought many battles but yet we can find so much courage in David's David's revelation of who his trust was in now I didn't give the the boys the scripture back there but you can just you can just take them and and and and maybe uh read them in your own time we're going to go through them pretty pretty fast just to encourage our faith but David knowing who his God was knowing that he was nothing without his God he he knew that he would fail or he would fall short or he was a nobody before God came and called him but God anointed him to see him in his age I believe God anointed us to see God in our age to see him manifested in his word he was he was anointed for that brother man was saved now listen closely do as David did put your future in his hand how what am I to know to know what to do brother Brandon put your future in his hand no matter what comes or goes trust him he is the word now no David said his time is in my hand trust in him all the time always trust in him he knew who held the future David did that's the reason he could say this there is only there's only one holds the future that's God so he holds the future why don't you let him hold you I think that's a pretty encouraging word from the prophet of God if he holds tomorrow why don't you let him hold your circumstance you're going through tonight he already has overcome on the other side so we'll start with Psalm 62 in the first verse truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times somebody say all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Selah Psalms 37 the first verse fret not thyself because of evil doers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like grass and wither as the green herb trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass Psalms 56 and 1. be merciful unto me o God for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth Me Mine enemies with daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against Me O thou most high what time I am afraid I will trust in thee somebody say trust in thee in God I will praise his word and God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me every day they rest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil they gather themselves together they they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul shall they escape by iniquity and thine anger cast down the people o God thou tell us my wanderings put thou my tears into that bottle are they not in thy book when I cry unto thee then shall my enemies turn back this I know for God is for me and God will I praise his word and the Lord will I praise his word and God have I put my trust I will not be afraid somebody say I will not be afraid what man can do unto me that vows are upon me o God I will render Praises unto thee for thou Hast delivered my soul from Death will Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that I may walk before God in the light of the living Psalms 9 and the ninth verse the Lord it also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble and they that Know Thy Name will put their trust in these and we say trust in thee for thou Lord has not forsaken them that seek thee Psalms 118-5 I called upon the Lord in distress and the Lord answered me and set me in a large place the Lord is on my side I will not fear somebody say I will not fear what man can do unto me the lord taketh my part with him that helped me therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes Proverbs the third chapter in the fifth verse trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding proverbs 30 and 5 every word of God is pure he is just Shield unto them that put their trust in him Isaiah 57 and the 13th verse when thou Christ that that companies deliver the but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my Holy Mountain Isaiah the 26th chapter that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord forever somebody say forever for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength for he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty City he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the ground he bring it even to the dust the foot shall tread it down even the foot of the poor and the steps of the needy there's just some scriptures that you can there's plenty more to go through but there's some scriptures you can encourage yourself our trust is in him who will not fill us he will not leave us he will not forsake us he doesn't forget about your need he knows exactly where you're at but your trust has got to be fully in him because he's going to require of you to walk by faith right Mark the 11th chapter will say have faith in God we've got to walk by faith now if we could see every step if we could see if it was paint by numbers or paint by color or whatever they call it we we would be able to see what's coming but God requires the believer to walk by faith alone to take him at his word and to say he's not going to leave me out to dry he's not going to leave me hanging but he's going to come in my day of trouble he will be a soulless for me I believe the God we serve is more than able to overcome any circumstance that we're going through life any circumstance that we're going through in our mind but our trust has to be in his ability to overcome it not in my ability to to out preach the devil or your ability to out praise the devil or to outrun the devil you're never going to outrun him you're never going to out argue them you're never going to out talk them but your trust has got to be in the one that is already overcame him we've been given a promise in this hour that we would be a Rapture Ready bride that we would be the Fulfillment of these things that were prophesied our trust is not in our ability to do it our trust is in that heat already paid the price for us to go through into that Victory we are his victory I think that should be a fridge quote that everybody should have on their windshield we are the victory of Christ we are the reason he died we are the reason he gave his life we are the reason he took a cross We Are The Reason by his stripes he paid for our healing we are the reason that he said not my will but thine be done O Lord you see the self-sacrifice he had to put his trust in his own word my will but thine be done my that's the hardest thing for us to do is to say not what I want or not what I think or not the direction that I want to lean to but let Thy word have the preeminence in my life that is what God is requiring from us in this time we're not going to make it by any other way we've got to look only at the word it's got to strike the lens it's got to be the right anointing in the right time the right season we are walking in a perfect Prophet a prophet's age under a perfect prophecy we aren't perfect people but not in our own ability in whom we have put our trust he is perfect in all his ways lean not unto thy own understanding but put your trust in him they that know the name of their God put their trust in him I'm thankful that we're not curious about who God is we have more information about God than any religion has ever had throughout history we're not curious about who God is or what he has in store for us but we know who we're putting our trust in we know all about it we can we can recite the Ten Commandments from just a little child and we can tell you all the ins and outs of the scripture we know the character of God and his character is to be a refuge his character is to be a savior his character is to be a redeemer his characters to be a Healer his character is to save the lost and heal the sick and go after the broken that's the character of the God we're putting our trust in we're not putting our trust in somebody that might do it or maybe has the power to do it but we know our God and they that know their gods shall do exploits in his name they trust in him I would say trust in him there's nowhere else that I want to put my trust we've already been spoken for to overcome in this age the devil would like to tell me that I'm not gonna make it that I'm not gonna overcome but I'm not putting my trust in what the devil said brother Paul I'm putting my trust in him who already overcame who said I would make it who said that I would be an overcomer who said that I would take his word in fullness in this hour when I read that that quote and it says you were predestined to receive him in this age I put mine in there I put my trust in that when I read out of the church age book that says she will be a perfect bride she will be an invincible Army I put my name next to that quote I put my trust in him who I know remember brother Bosworth would say uh brother Brandon would would speak highly of brother Bosworth and he would say that uh uh don't put trust in your doubts for their unreliable but trust your faith put your trust in God don't rely on your doubts tomorrow you might have a doubt about something else tomorrow you might be questioning about another direction or if you get down that trail with the devil he'll have you questioning about your your own name and you won't even know where you were born but trust in the one thing that we know that there is a God and he is for me think about David going through his trials and there he was in a cave writing these Psalms in the dark and and persecuted on every side and there he was anointed to be the king of the land but he was forced into it came by his own character he could have taken Saul at any time but by the character of Christ in him he said I will not take him until it's time thank you and David writing these Psalms in the in the middle of despair now it's easy for us to praise the Lord when when the when when it's the last service of our meetings and the Saturday night and and the Lord's just Sweeping in the anointings here and but it's a lot harder to praise him on a Tuesday evening when you're by yourself and there's despair on every side and there's there's your enemies seemingly uniting against you and and in your mind even you might feel trapped and you think how am I ever going to get out of this situation that's when we're Overcomers that's when we praise the Lord that's when you reach down deep and you realize who your trust is in your trust is not in the church your trust is Not In a Pulpit your trust is not in a pastor or a Pew or a a microphone your trust is in him who will not leave you nor forsake you there's going to be moments in time when you can't get a hold of mama there's gonna be moments in time when you can't get a hold of your daddy or you can't get a hold of Pastor you've got to know where your trust is in it's in him who said he would never leave me he would never forsake me and he already told me that I will overcome on the other side I see a dark shadow over you coming into this prayer line but I see you healed on the other side he already spoke a word over his bride we've just got a follow in step with that our trust is in his word our trust is in what he's already promised us it's not based upon our worthiness he thought you were worth it enough to give his worthiness for it oh brother bam says oh I'm not excited I know exactly where I'm standing I know exactly what I'm talking about oh if I could only express my feelings if I could only tell this audience what it really means to be setting under the anointing of this rock Christ Jesus already paid for your judgment Warrior sickness took your sorrow and settled the question before God are you scared to put your trust in him that's the question the prophet asked are you scared to put your trust in him you don't have to be judged you don't have to think you're self-worthy you'll never be worthy but Christ was worthy in your stead that paid the price not trying to redeem something you can't redeem it because you ain't got the money to but God had the money and he sent Christ and settled the bill and redeemed you from your sickness and your sorrows and your worry and your sin and your backsliding he sent the money which was Christ Jesus and deposited it on Calvary on galgotha's hill and tonight every one of you is free if you'll just believe it now to me I think we can take that quote to the bank tonight every one of you is free from your disparity if you'll just believe that he already paid the price my God to think that we would we would somehow diminish the value of Christ's Sacrifice by by looking it through our own lands or what we're worthy of or how we feel that we can do this but it's not by your own worth it's by putting your trust in him that paid the price already for you he already overcame the circumstance that you're in but the man would say you just can't lose when you become a Christian I love this quote just can't lose just trust in him and whatever the way it goes just keep your sales set to his Spirit he will guide you into the harbor it'll all be all right thank you I don't know I know but sometimes it's good to hear the words it'll all be all right you know sometimes we get so worried about what's going to happen in this situation or what's going to happen and then what about and what about and what about sometimes you just need to hear a sure word of Prophecy saying it'll all be all right just put your trust in him it'll all work out you'll come out on top just put your trust in the one thing that cannot Fail You I Will Fail you your own self will fail you but put your trust in the one thing that will not fail amen it's never failed it's never lost it's never retreated he's never had to back up on his word he's never had to change his mind about a thought he will come through he will be there in the time of trouble in your day of trouble he's there and your time when you feel like you're all alone and there's nobody around to hear you he's there when you feel like nobody knows the anguish and the pain that you're going through he's there trust in him who has never left you even when you were running as hard as you could from him he never left you he was there all the time waiting patiently alive my what a God we serve to think that he would come down for us you know the devil spends a lot of time telling us how unworthy we we are and it's true but it just makes me appreciate my God that much more to think that he would come for a sinner like me to think that he would come for for a slothful person like me slow in faith and weak of heart but God would come and give me a revelation in this hour that I will take a body change and I will be gone in the moment of a twinkling of an eye to think that God came down delivered that personal revelation to you my despite what the devil's already put on you but God thought you were worth it put your trust in him who will not leave you [Music] the man would say I never try to trust my own wisdom because I have none I'm so glad that I do not if I had some maybe I would try to trust in it but the Lord just seemed fit that I didn't have any so I just have to trust in him and I believe it would be good if we all just tried that a while don't you think somebody say Amen just don't take your own ideas about a thing but rest solemnly upon thus saith the Lord don't try to reason it because you can't reason it if you can reason it out and see just exactly how it's going to be it would not be an Act of Faith anymore right don't try to reason it out but walk by faith he's never left us he'll never forsake us trust in his word that he's going to see us it'll all work out it'll all be okay the message shalomi would say look up and shine with the joy of the Lord to know that you've been privileged your eyes have come open and see this day trust in him for the future you've seen him vindicate his word in days past he that Vindicated his word in days past and made all these other things happen just exactly to the hour that we're living everything exactly to the seventh Angels message both showed it in heaven and in Earth and made it known three ways so there would be no slip up remember he promised he'd come again Hallelujah that word will be a Vindicated God's promised word with 2 000 years of waiting he will arrive on time somebody say all the time he will arrive on time don't be weary he'll be there my how many times have we gotten weary wondering if the Lord knows where we're at wondering if the Lord knows the circumstance we're going through and the conversation that we just have with the prophet of God through the spirit of discernment would see you in your situation and he would say don't be weary he'll be there he will arrive right on time he's never been late for an appointment but he's always right on time so we say all time oh he's an on-time God yes he is he may not come when you want him to but he'll always be there right on time he's an on-time God he knows your circumstance he knows the situation you're in he knows the battle you're fighting and he'll be there right on time don't worry he'll be there to think about it if we could just realize who we are in this time in this generation in this age we would be an invincible Army if we would just recognize where our help comes from our help does not come from brother so and so or Apostle so-and-so or pre-so and so our help coming from the Lord and my trust is in him who will not leave me nor forsake me nor cast me down nor forget about me nor no not know where I'm going or the steps I'm taking he's right there with you at all times now think about it like if if we were in a fight brother Paul and I had you at my side I'd be a little more bold you know if if me and Brian got an exchange I might not be as bold but with you on my side it's two verse one I mean brother Paul we can take on the world but you see one of Paul's not there then I feel alone and I feel that it's just me going through the battle you know when I was a kid I had an older brother and as long as older brother was there any of my friends my age older brother could take care of them older brother could take care of them and as long as he was there the confidence was there you can run your mouth and you could do what you wanted and you could you could pick fights and you could as long as older brother was there you know then you grow up a little bit and we we used to play basketball a lot and as long as Jamal was there we'll take your team up he can dunk but then one time Jamal doesn't show up for a game and you've done talked your trash but you see how confident we are when we know we've got backup but see when the Devil comes to us we feel like we're all alone we feel like it's just us and him on the court and it's us and him but we've got to recognize where our trust is my trust is not in my ability to defeat the Devil my trust is in in the ability that I have to surrender myself to he who has already defeated the devil he is with you even in you in the time of trouble when you're standing Toe to Toe with the devil you don't have to wait for Big Brother to show up he's already there he's already standing behind you he's already in the fight he's already on your side and he's Mighty in battle he's never lost one and with that you know it used to be when your little your friend might might come up against you and he'd be real tough until he saw Big Brother behind you before you know it he's backing up and before you know he's running away now if you didn't see the Big Brother behind you might think you did it but you see the devil is exactly the same kind of coward when he sees that blood when he sees that blood that already defeated him that ripped his stinger out of him that ripped every victory that he had out of him he will tuck his tail and run every time we just have to resist the devil and he will flee right James would say uh submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you not maybe flee resist the devil and he will flee once the devil sees you're not giving up he'll tuck his tail and he'll Run for the hills why because he knows that he's already been defeated by the one that you're trusting in where your trust is anchored he's already been cast down he's already been overcome he's already been kicked out he knows that he hasn't got the goods to overcome that but he wants to see if you know it he'll take as much ground as you can give him he'll take it he'll take every possession that you'll let him have he'll he'll take every Victory from you that you'll give over to him but I say in this time in this hour it's time to draw a line and say not one more inch devil I'm not giving up one more inch of my ground I'm not giving up one more inch of my household of my faith of my victory of my overcoming life I will take it back by force we must resist the devil and he will flee now this word resist means to withstand the force or effect of so it does not mean that she won't be hit it means that you have enough to withstand the force or effect of what the devil is bringing against you when she recognizes who she is she will be an invincible Army Invincible does not mean immune from Attack Invincible means that you're greater than whatever attack can come against you I say as a Church of the Living God we are greater than whatever the enemy can throw against us because we know where our trust is he that is in me is greater than he that is in the world our trust is in him that will not leave us it will not forsake us we can withstand anything that the devil throws against us why because it's him on the inside it's it's him in her doing the Greater Works my goodness I don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance now just think when you come to the world everything had to be for prepared for you or pre-prepared rather for you I don't hardly understand that how we that we could think that a God that could prepare all these good things for us listen to this to think that a God that could prepare all these good things for us and we could not put trust in him that if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come see the Eternal things yes it seems very strange brother babe said how we can put our trust in him that he put us in this age but then we fail to put our trust in him that he's going to see us out of this age that he's going to see us out of the chaos that were in a of the destruction that our life has maybe become he will see you through you've got to recognize where your trust is some men trust in chariots some men trust in horses but I trust in the Lord my God who has never failed me he's never backed up he's never retreated he is mighty in battle if our trust is in him he will do the he will do the slaying for us we've just got to show up and collect the spoils my trust is in that kind of God my trust is in the kind of God that when we come in here on a Thursday night we sing the the songs of Zion and we say Here I Am to Worship here I am to bow down my trust is in the god that will come down and inhabit the praise of his people and while he's inhabiting that praise he's also taking care of the situation that's in your life he's taking care of the suicide demon he's taking care of that anxiety that you're fighting he's taking care of that that blood pressure issue he's taking care of the issues you're fighting in life while he's inhabiting the Praises of them that trust in him that's the God we serve he didn't come just out with no ammunition in his gun but he showed up because he's Mighty in battle every devil runs when they recognize the anointing of our God am I to think we don't have to wait on a big brother to come but he's already come my message is to clear he is here living amongst his bride fighting on her side he is fighting for us it's not us fighting it's him doing the fighting we just got to put our trust in him he will take care of it don't weary he's an on time God my that's hard for us but it's true he's an on time God and tonight maybe a cancer has conquered you maybe something else has taken hold you some disease even the disease of sin or whatever it is it may look dark and gloomy to you now may look like you'll never recover maybe look like you can't get over that TB or that prostate trouble or that lung trouble whatever it is that tumor that crippled condition the doctor May say every hope is gone but standing right by your side tonight ready to take you in possession stands the eyes of Faith who sees the victory Yonder through the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah standing right next to you now you may not see him you may not feel him but it's a promise that he's there standing right next to you tonight is the one ready to take you into possession of all things brother man would say away with Satan in his gloom and up with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ the faith of the almighty God's faith can take his holy stand on the Rock of Ages and Pierce an Eagle Eye through every stormy Cloud when the very waves of death and disappointments trying to wash its foundation out from under it it can't stand there and look beyond the skies and say God is right and believe the counsel of the wise and living God Amen you see the despair of this world is nothing new right Satan may tell you that you're going through an extra hard time and everybody else around you is just extremely blessed and we're not going through an equally as hard time but everybody is going through a battle right now if you're not going through a battle right now raise your hand everybody is going through a battle right now everybody is is fighting with everything that's within them to maintain a faith in this word to look beyond the Flesh and look beyond the disappointments and look beyond the doubt and recognize that we have eyes of Faith to see who our trust is in there he is mighty in battle there he is who's never retreated there is with banners waving there he is our Mighty conqueror we see past what we're going through right now we see past the Red Sea that's before us it will be parted he will be there right on time he's not going to leave you in the in the hour of your darkest Temptation he'll be there my just realize that the Gloom that you're fighting is not something new but everyone is fighting the same thing but we will overcome father the one that said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen by it the elders obtained a good report we understand that the world was made out of things that does not appear how God before there was even an earth here just spoke the word and dust and dirt and rocks and corrosions come into existence because God said I can see his word flying from his lips going out that in that Darkness Yonder and the atoms begin to break and the world come into existence that same God somebody say the same God hang Yonder on calvary's cross and died he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we are healed God we rebuke every devil of Doubt there is in the building take that shadow away tonight and let every man and woman come through here believing with all their heart that Jesus is going to make them well may they leave this this platform tonight with their hands up in the air shouting and praising God knowing that Jesus has promised it and he's good to his promise granted father take away all the gloom and doubt and let the Holy Ghost Reign supremely heal everyone and save everyone for we ask it in Christ's name amen and now if that same spirit that was upon him to be the Redeemer in that age that we have accepted now the promise in this last day that would take place if you become part of that word you are redeemed with him because the same spirit that dwelt in Christ is dwelling in you quickening your life to this age and it'll also in the end time Quicken your mortal bodies resurrect them bring them up again that takes the Gloom away when we look at that and that is the truth amen direct quotes from a prophet there's no there's more no more sure source that we could go to than direct quotes from a prophet of God to tell us
