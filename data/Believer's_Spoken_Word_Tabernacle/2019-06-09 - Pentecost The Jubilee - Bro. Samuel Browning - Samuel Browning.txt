few moments I want to just mention to you here this morning we I want to just if we could on a special offering that we lift here the the mission offering I'd like to employ that or send that for where it will help with the cost for brother Richard and sister Maria's little granddaughter Liliana there's been a lot of medical expenses and things that has has went forth there already they are going back down again here to Cincinnati tomorrow and so we just want to we want to direct that in that way if today that you were not with you're not prepared because this would be the mission offering what we would do is is that even next week we'll even extend it into next Sunday as well you'll just have to make sure and even next Sunday if you want to give even more toward it or what have you you can write it on the envelope just make sure that you make it out to the special offering there that's for Liliana's medical expenses and let's also let's just really continue to keep that that that situation in prayer as well you know we've we've already we've applied amen the promise and faith a man and just looking for the Lord to have his way and for God to move and so we just want to just keep that in prayer as a church you know there's many needs that we have is throughout the body there's many needs that are here we have this need and we have many others and and you know I'll say it like this even when we have a good report of things don't let off the gas pedal don't let off the gas pedal push the gas pedal a little bit further down we want to pray completely even in times sometimes you know there's things you can get good reports on you say honey where would that be in Scripture well in Scripture it's always when God gives a promise the people of God that promises made known to them then they begin to pray for that promise when Daniel the Bible says when Daniel understood by the books then Daniel went into prayer and when Daniel went into prayer here he was it was a secret of that life Daniel he began to pour his heart out make sure there was nothing in the way that would hinder God in his life Daniel believed he was a part of it and he was a part of it and so Daniel prayed concerning that when Peter I've always looked at this when Peter wasn't the we continue to pray amen so let's just remember that also in prayer I want to just also mention to you this as the brothers would prepare in just a moment to come the Lord willing my wife and I will be leaving here on Tuesday for New Mexico for meetings there with brother Manuel Salazar and not just myself but of a number of other ministers that are going in there for Wednesday through through Sunday so I just asked you to be in prayer with us this has been planned out for some time and so I just asked you to be in prayer with us during that time will you do that I certainly am i certainly am counting on that and I mean that with all my heart I'm counting on that too and you know also one surah mentioned to you this coming Thursday brother Steve Bruce Owen from Quebec will be here with us and brother Steve had mentioned about coming by because he will be next weekend brother Steve will be with brother Paula Fontaine and the Saints there and then also the tri-state youth meeting on that Sunday evening that I think it's at six o'clock so let's remember that on Thursday brother Steve will be here most of you remember brother Steve when it came last year in April and just a real real wonderful brother in the Lord pastors a church there in Quebec also want to mention on that Sunday on Sunday brother Boaz Romero will be here now brother Boaz will be returning it's the first time he's been here with us since he's been married and so he married a sister from Quebec so I'm sure he'll be wanting to show off his bride so we want to just be in prayer for those services as well and then Lord willing my wife we'll land back in here on Monday evening and just be in prayer with that as well and I also would really ask your prayer because then we're here for a couple weeks and then we're down at the believers youth camp with meetings down there where I'll be down there the whole week and ministering there and I ask you just if you would go ahead and begin praying for that as well but the Lord will just have his way because there are hearts and lives to be touched by the Lord young people that need an experience with God those that haven't experienced it they would be further strengthened in the Lord so it's just kind of I'm sorry the youth camp is at the very end of June it starts I think it's June 29th it goes through July 4th so it's the last weekend in June then it runs through the first week of July so go ahead and begin to pray for that as well if you would I think that is I think that's it with the announcements and let's just go ahead and we're going to take up the special offering this morning amen so if you'll stand with me maybe Paul and Ben maybe we'll do that right after I'm in astir okay we'll do that song afterwards the Lord willing let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we are just so thankful dear God for your mercy and grace Lord Lord where would we be without you lord your god I just pray as we come into another Lord another fold another part of this service Lord this is where God our hearts Lord and everything is directed our worship Oh God our praises it's about you Lord father is your word it declares and we know to be true that Lord you dwell in the praises of your people Lord you draw nigh Oh God as we begin to just Lord think of you would begin to worship You Lord and father from all the cares of life we just steal away or God in these moments and we just pray this morning of it Lord that you will come by our way you know the needs of your children Lord God what you've placed on my heart Lord it'll take you to deliver it Lord we ask that Lord that the Holy Ghost Oh God that you'll come and just take the word Lord as you did that day with the little lads lunch and you fed a multitude Lord in the natural may you come this morning Lord and feed us Lord come break the bread Lord and deliver to us the meat of the word and the life of the word we pray Oh God Lord we just pray now Lord as we lift this offering Lord you see the need Lord for your God for a little Lilliana Lord to help Lord and Lord

Lord for her we pray Lord we believe that you are Oh God Lord even when we don't see it Lord we believe it Lord God and Lord we just ask Lorne Oh God all of these things now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God amen amen god bless you god bless u musicians I want you to if you'll turn with me in the scriptures to Acts chapter 2 and I want to read begin beginning in verse one and I want to speak because I know I did not send a title to you all but I want to speak on Pentecost the Jubilee Pentecost the Jubilee in Acts chapter 2 verse 1 we're going to read just a few verses of Scripture and when the day of Pentecost was fully come what was a type now is fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it's sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance now you're aware as we go on without me reading more in that particular those scriptures they the Bible says they heard every man in their own tongue they were still speaking in their native language but the others were hearing it in their language amen but it's what they were saying that was important verse 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this others mocking said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my Worth what authority here's the one who ran when they asked you were with him this is different now it wasn't just with him the one he was with was now in him for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved now one more place in that same scripture here verse 32 this Jesus hath God raised up we're up we all our witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise I want you just to look at this here for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're being seated if you'll turn with me also now to the Book of Luke amen want to say brother Samuel god bless you amen it was a it was a pleasure having you here with us take our greetings back to your dad your mom and the church amen god bless you let's go to Luke chapter 4 here you're probably already there now the Bible says in verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the Prophet Isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me now what you think of this he's reading what has been wrote but he's not reading it he's declaring it this is not just a reading this is declaring what was wrote now is living the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and if I just let me make a common here just for a moment how fitting where the Lord Jesus himself standing here and would begin to declare the acceptable year of the Lord announcing the jubilee is approaching this is the Jubilee is approaching to think of where you and I stand in this hour that God in the message that he has given to us the finishing up of this working with the Gentile age this same thing repeats here and you're aware of this as believers in the message birth pains for the bream tags looks at there's pages that are stuck together and he's trying to find he says something's wrong with my Bible and so then the priest a priest a Catholic priest comes up to him gives him his Bible that he's been reading from and he says be still my son God is doing something and he reads this scripture because we you and I are standing in an hour that not only are we called back into the promised land of the fullness of the Holy Ghost but it is also calling you and I to what the prophets to what everyone has looked forward to that we would be delivered from this body and into that body that God has prepared for us he's the Alpha and Omega so when we look at where we are in standing here I want to deal with this because you would know they would have this marked even on the calendars when you would look at it today as that of Pentecost and they would have you know those things laid out but to me when we look at this within the scripture here to understand that each of these parts here of what the Ministry of the Lord Jesus here would come to do it was it is a ministry that brings liberté it brings healing it brings a recovering of sight it brings deliverance and it sets at liberty them that are bruised now I want you to think of this here and I want to just kind of move through this just a little bit you realize that if we would go back here in the beginning and go back clear to where they were the first family was there in the Garden of Eden you and I realized that there was a falling from eternal life God had given them his word and they were fortified behind that word but there was a falling from that of eternal life there were choices that were made in that time remember Adam did not under deception make a choice but Adam willfully made a choice when his wife had been deceived he made a choice in order to redeem her he redeemed her with the imparting of his life in her and remember with that then hear God as the Lord moves down here within the Garden of Eden remember here God comes down and he speaks in genesis 3:15 that he would give the woman a seed and that that seed itself would bruise the very head of the serpent that God would be the one who would be the undoing of what was done man was not able to undo what was done in Eden but it would take God himself that he is the one who would supply what was needed and God made this announcement I will give the woman a seat and you and I know or the woman does not have a seat but God Himself becoming one of us God through him by the creation of there creating a body that he himself would come down and live in and redeem you and I back unto himself and then listen through that Redemption it not only brings us back into the life that we fell from but it also is to bring us back and bring to restore back to what it was in Eden and it also then is to restore the earth to her former glory this is all his doing he expressed that he would bring them back where they fell from they fell from eternal life they fell from eternal youth so to think of how that God here would come down and he would bring life to us and bring to us our inheritance to bring us back and restore that fallen Eden who can read that in Romans 5 we find this great redemption story God has wrote this even when you could go back even to the very beginning in the opening of Genesis but for sake of time we even look at how that God moves down and it begins to deal with Abraham to think of it God in the restoring of this he deals with Abraham and here is Abram down there in the earth of counties and God speaks to Abraham and the Lord brings Abraham out of the earth of counties and here's what God told him he speaks to him in the land where he currently is under idolatry and everything else but he makes known to Abram there is a land and this land is a land that I'm going to give to you and to your seed at that time Abram had no seed his wife was barren but there was a promise that was made then I'm going to give you a land I will show you the land that I'm talking about and this land will your possession it will be your inheritance to you and your seed after you now hear Abraham to think of this you know an inheritance let me just deal with that word just for a moment the word inheritance it is something that belongs to you that has belonged to your family that has belonged to previous generations it's something that is handed down that's what an inheritance is an inheritance itself there are things that you know and just speaking on a very natural and carnal level there are things that some of us may have that we hold in our possession that things that maybe you never even met you know your auntie or your uncle or your you know your your grandma or your grandpa your great-great-great you never even met them but you hold in your possession somebody has told you this belonged to them this is what they wore on their wedding day this is what it is something that is of a valued treasure that has been passed down from generation to generation and yet you know when we look at it in the natural you can find people in the natural that sometimes you know we can say like this some people don't even have a sentimental value and I'm not here to preach on that I'm here just to show you that in the natural it can only run so far but when God has declared an inheritance there is nothing that can take away your inheritance that rightfully belongs to you and you may not even realize you've got an inheritance but that doesn't change that to have an inheritance you just need to be in the place to hear the words of the inheritance and the life of that being proclaimed and then you realize I have an inheritance so when we see this that an inheritance itself is something that remains in the family to whom it is given it must remain in the family to whom it is given this is why Abraham if I can refer to this in Genesis 15 when God has already now he's been in the land there's been time and Abraham asks God the question whereby shall I know that I shall inherit this land Abraham knew I'm dwelling on it right now but you said that this land belongs to me and my seed what's Abraham saying I want to know who my seed is because remember what is his what is his his inheritance it will be that which will be passed to his seed from generation to generation and that's why Abraham asked the question about all that he can see Eliezer is here as should it be Eliezer and God lets him know no it is one that shall be born from thy own loins this was the mystery that God was expressing through Abraham's life that even God's own inheritors those of his children would not be something outside of him but were ordained in his own loins the loins of his mind and that is why the Prophet could tell us he said when God when the Word was made flesh he said we were transferred from the loins of God's mind into the loins of Jesus we were there dwelling in that life you'd understand how we were identified when he walked upon this earth when the word was made flesh when he went to Calvary I paid a made me pay for my sins there in that body when he got up on that Easter morning we got up with her we are represented in this inheritance that is why Abraham would ask the question whereby shall I know that I shall inherit them God answers the question by taking him to the sacrifice how shall I inherited through the sacrifice there's God to come of the sacrifice and God noticed through the sacrifice there is also the unfolding of the Covenant oh my god God is committing himself to his word for he is the word when God has given a promise he commits himself it didn't like you and I are I say and you're Payton call me up I'll help you out and then you call me up I said huh you know what my back's been bothering me I wear this or that I'm a no Claude is committed to his word when God speaks his word his life his nature his substance his character he is there within that word and God let him know you're see I want you to know this your seat is going to be a stranger in a land that's not theirs Claude was letting him know there be a departing from the land but I want you to know your seed they'll be in a stranger in a strange land but I want you to know I will bring your seed back home this is their land this is their land God was letting him know how did they become a seed in a strange land they were sold into slavery here Joseph he rejected his rejected of his brother so because of the rejection Israel dispersed here they go they come down into Egypt right when you move ahead when Israel rejected the Messiah they were dispersed throughout the world but that never changed God's mind concerning them it never changed God's mind because God had already declared through the Old Testament prophets I will bring you back to your land [Applause] hallelujah God's mind cannot be changed it cannot be changed and he said I will bring them back into this land this is why here you know the Prophet would make in the message the third Exodus he would express to us and say why were they even down in Egypt why would God's people be out of that land after all that God promised right there with Abraham Isaac and Jacob their God gave them that land and said this is it I want you to think of this for a moment Satan has thought to try to keep them out of that land I'm not going to preach on all that this morning but he has to try to keep them out of that land but let me just tell you something and let me just remind the devil you can put up all the barricades you can try to put up all these false boundaries you can try to make peace pacts and everything else but you can't stop God from fulfilling his word he will bring his seed back home he can try to put all sorts of condemnation and everything else but you cannot stop God from fulfilling his word I'll bring them back home I'll gather them out of the graves I'll bring them back to me I'll draw that back to me God gave them that land just even recently they found the artifacts of David right on the Temple Mount just here within just a couple days ago they found it right there I'm telling you it's buried [Applause] inscriptions are buried in the earth that show this land belongs to Israel and there was a sea and a seed in you and me that always identify this belongs to God and God by the power of the Holy Ghost he excavates it and brings it forth and said this belongs to me hallelujah this belongs to me you may call the piece back you one and everything else this crown belongs to me devil said well you can have his mind he's a nope every border he belongs to me I don't want no little sliver I want everything that's the working of the Holy Ghost in our life he moves too I speak to you and I how rights and then when he comes into our life oh that is why as a child of God you cannot be complacent if you even start to get complacent you begin to feel yourself thinking what's going on what's going on you who were ordained by God to occupy this land he meant that the Holy Ghost would have the right away the fullness of the Spirit of God working in your life and in my life brother branham tells us he said Oh God give us a Pentecost he gave us the book of Acts he give us the Holy Spirit to lead and guide us he give us a land and why are we out of it the Lord visited according to the promise that he made to Abraham he visited his seed he went down to each of you see according to his word a promise was laying there when desperation began to set in on the people's hearts they began to pray and ask and ask for God to fulfill his word God comes down and he makes the promise a living reality in the heart of Moses in Exodus 3 God speaks this promise into the heart of Moses and Moses I want you to catch this now here is a burning bush and yet a bush that here a fire enveloping but yet the bush is not consumed but the fire that was there in that bush came out of that bush and went into the bosom of Moses Moses went down to Egypt veiling God to the people are you with me that word that God had given in that hour that was a word that God through the lips of his prophet he would honor that sound he would blow that ram's horn he would blow that shofar that announces that the Lord God he has remembered his promise and I am the or come down to deliver my people go moses you'll be my spokesman the call the message that went forth was to call him out of egypt and call them to their inheritance bring them out and take them in that's the message bring them out take them in amen to come out of the land you're in and into the land of promise amen to ought to the adoption to the inheritance of the children of israel the natural seed of abraham you see this this would repeat we're in it israel now coming into the land here they are in the land they crawl so now here they cross into the land but now once in the land you find that things started getting loose israel begins to take for granted the land that they're living in they begin to take for granted the grace of god that's been given to him remember God's grace brother Tim was reading that hair out of the book of Deuteronomy I'd give you houses that you didn't even build I'll give you a Wells that you didn't dig I'll give you vineyards that you didn't plant what was that grace not because they deserved it not because you and I deserve it it's the grace of God what God has given to you and I this is in our inheritance and when it came to this place in Israel begin to get away from the fountains of living water I hope you with me they were getting away from the fountains of living water they were drifting from that life and they begin to hew to themselves broken cisterns broken cisterns cannot bring cleansing it cannot bring healing there's only one thing that can do that and that's a fountain that's open amen that's only one thing that can do that in our life and that's that fountain that has been opened the Lord Jesus Christ in the pouring out of his life and that's the same one that will be poured out on the 144,000 when vide is revealed to them that the fountain is open in the house of David Laura be declawed him and everything working hand in hand with the atonement God showed there was a dispersal that was coming through Jeremiah and remember God let it be known that this land it will be desolate she will have her Sabbath's she will enjoy all of that but this is what I want you to do Jeremiah I want you to go down there and I want you to purchase from your uncle that land that belongs to him I want you to redeem it by a purchase and I want you to make a signing of that a notary of that and place it in an earthen vessel and plant it in this land and then you'll have a written part out here what is hidden will correspond with what is out here amen it will be a declaration you know what God was saying that even in the midst of this dispersion what Israel is being taken captive I will bring them back home I will bring them back home hallelujah he chose to place this in an earthen vessel who is that earthen vessel the Lord Jesus Christ hey man that life because it's through him comes Redemption are you with me through him comes Redemption I'm not gonna get into Ruth right now but it's just an inheritance and inheritance in Leviticus 23 turn with me there would you please and Leviticus 23 let's read just verses 9 through 11 Leviticus 23 9 through 11 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheet of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it that wave sheaf was indeed the Lord Jesus Christ he raised on the eighth day he raised on the day after the after the Sabbath he was raised and it was presented notice one who had went in the ground now one that had come to maturity and that wave sheaf that that stalk of wheat right there where everything was fully right it was that full manifestation that was being way that there are more seeds in this field just like this one hey man there's more just like this one and that was wave to be it set to there before the Lord now the Bible goes on here if we drop down into verse 15 here verse 15 and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheath of the wave offering seven Sabbath's shall be complete even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall be a number fifty days and you shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord you shall bring out of your habitations two wave lows of two tenths deals and they shall be of time flour they shall be bacon with eleven they are the firstfruits unto the Lord he was the firstfruits that rose they meant that resurrection but that resurrection on the day of Pentecost that way she was weighed upon them that same life that brought him out of the grave and raised him up is that same life that's now waived upon the worshipers at the day of Pentecost they met and they are recipients of that light now I want you to look at this here what God declares on the day of Pentecost here is two wave laws having that same see that same life inside of those wave lows but no longer loosely sheaves that are bound together by a cord but now the seed has been gathered together in unity this is what the scripture says they were in one place in one mind in one Accord and the Holy Ghost proper unity it brought the quickening it moved that seat to him became bread and that bread was rolling down through the camp and tearing things up are you listening here's a repeat of Gideon's day in that hour what he was in the alphabet he is in the Omega bride same life rolling in the hearts other believer they men that same brand that's been promised in this hour not a crumb but the bread himself to wave loaves I don't want to dwell on this a lot because I could I could preach days on some of this right here you know by God's grace I just love the Word of God don't you but the Bible says you make it with fine flour now how do you know what fine flour you stick your hand down in it and you know it's fine flour when it's sticky I mean it sticks to you that's the mystery skill the stickiness but on the inside there is that life on the inside your sweet life come on somebody the Lord be to God Oh so here the Lord well I want to get you to this to this point here the Lord would bring Israel into this land of promise from a natural land into a natural promised land Israel remember they had got away what God had given them remember he promised that he would bring them into the land when the Israel came out of Egypt the wilderness was not the promise they they were happy ain't nothing wrong with being happy they danced on the red sea shore they should have danced I mean when you see that your enemy is washed up on the shore behind you you ought to cut a spell but that tells us and you read in the scripture it wasn't until when Moses and them saw the dead Egyptians wash up on the shore that they begin to dance they begin to see they begin to praise God when they saw their enemy that had been chasing them and pursuing them and threatening to bring them into bondage but brother here came the redemptive power of God and it opened up that red sea what was it it was God manifesting his name when he opened up the Red Sea he manifests his strength so much that the Bible says in the book of Isaiah chapter 51 that when he parted the Red Sea the waves cried out the Lord of Hosts is his name the Lord is his name the parting the opening is through his name he declares his name hallelu they weren't in their land yet they were in the wilderness but God notice they came up to that place and Kadish and they said we're not able to do it I'm gonna agree with the fact if you're looking at your natural ability and with those 10 spies we're not able to do it I agree but how can you forget but God that talks you out of each other how can you forget the God who opened the Red Sea how can you forget the God who fats you when you were hungry how can you forget the God who supply turning bitter water into sweet water how can you forget the God who took a rock and he brought forth water out of that rock all of that was to build faith in the Living God that was there in their midst I will send my angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place that I have prepared for thee hallelujah he would take them in by redemptive power God let me remember on some of the Thursday nights when I read that quote really been stirred sometimes my children get up on my lap he said they go to you know squeeze and mom said boy daddy's got big muscles brother BAM said I said that kinda makes me feel a little good when they do that he said well you know what God likes his children he likes to show he's got big muscles he likes to display when situations get into a dire straight that's when he shows up rather when there's no other hope when there's no other place to turn this is where God said this is just where I want you I'm gonna make known that power concerning you he loves to flex his muscles he loves to demonstrate his power here they were as a people they're walking in this place in the land in the wilderness already resting in their bosom here they were born Israelites they were born Hebrews they were born Jews are you with me they were born that then they're just in that birth they have that heritage they already have that inheritance they just needed someone to bring them to their inheritance they could read in there and say oh my my father Abraham Kayla could say my father Abraham you think I'm a preacher now you think the devil didn't get right up next to Caleb and say hey buddy have you ever checked out your DNA you were checked out your verse were you ever checked out your birth certificate come on I'm not fooling a political move around talking my thing serious now have you ever checked out your birth certificate you were born on hmm a keen insight and God said that he would give the land to the seed he would give the land of the kinna sites if I know him if I recall correctly that wouldn't make Caleb that your great granddaddy would have been Esau and he saw was a rejecter of the birthright but there was something greater inside a Caleb that Caleb said I refuse to be identified by my natural family tree I refuse to be identified there I'm a son of Abraham the son of Abraham I've got an inheritance says I've got a lamb they're Calif you can't have it you're nothing but a dog but the dog takes the crumbs from the master's table there's something ringing in my heart and God God God chose Caleb to represent Judah hello I tell you there was something deeper than just his natural birth Caleb was the son of Abraham [Applause] he is our type Caleb so you're representing Judah you know so I think you something special no God said that so where do you think your inheritance is where dude is that where Jew does that that's my inheritance [Applause] so when Caleb think of this think of this he it was not his natural abilities he was not walking around with footsteps in possession on the land because it was something naturally belonging to him but it was a spiritual revelation where Caleb identified himself with the Word of God and the moving of the Holy Ghost in that hour he said if Tom be for us who can be against us that's that true Gentile that just like truth the Bible says we love Naomi they men the odds Naomi standing there with that same promise I wish I could preach that defeasance warn our inheritance already they in Christ in God before the foundation of the world when Israel and then patriarchs when here they were being birthed as we said last week when they were being birthed when there's a mid when they were crying out that name positionally placed them in the Land of Israel and you and I in the loins of God's mother when God was giving birth to himself to his world in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God they meant God giving birth to his children by his world we are positionally placed in Christ from before the foundation of the world we already have an inheritance as clear as clear can be but the man said God knew I'd be standing at the pulpit tonight he knew the text I read and he said he knew you would be here and he said God knew you'd be desiring the Holy Ghost so God made a way that you could receive the Holy Ghost why it was a call come back home come back home our inheritance our inheritance by predestination you can read that in Ephesians one I I don't have time to deal with it but in Ephesians 1 3 through 6 he has predestinated us unto the adoption the placement of children by Jesus Christ to himself for us to come into that place God had to become man in order to bring us back home in order to bring us back to our inheritance this is why brother Branham I had the quote in front of me but just let me refer to it he said what was first here he said God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first he said Jesus never left me an inheritance jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance and brought you to your inheritance see what already but all there you understand here he came down and here the earthen vessel it has within it that inheritance that's been inscribed to you and I that points to your coming back to the land of what God chose you to be before the foundation of the world and in the earth and vessel he declares to you the land that belongs to you you're with me you having a good time [Applause] well my now here a new generation look how God everything is so complete in his word here you find when the new generation crosses in Joshua 5 you look when the new generation when they crawl so maybe I've just referred to it and stood arena but I got a turn there Joshua 5 and you know when they came into the land in Joshua 5 maybe you can read it when you get home but in Joshua 5 when they came in the land now here after coming into the land God begins to declare - a - Joshua he said the children are not bearing the sea of the Covenant in their flesh there was neglect in the years of warning or wandering and God let's say no he tells Joshua I want you to make sharp knives it shows there was necessary material that could be made sharp that can absolutely remove the reproach of Egypt off the lives of the children of Israel something that would be able to sever them from their past they may be able to cut it away from their past to wear now that circumcision that seal would be identified in their flesh listen to me now that seal being identified in the flesh was a sign of the Abrahamic covenant when they went into battle they were going to battle with the authority of the seal and the circumcision on their life that's why when the Holy Ghost is come brother it takes that word and it's circumcised as you and I it cuts away the surplus flesh it separates you from your first birth so in needs arise and you're praying for needs praying for loved ones praying for situation you present that token with your unwavering faith you're standing on solid ground as a son and daughter of Abraham I've got a covenant I'm in the Covenant maybe Shamgar this morning would be the morning for God to direct you to the ox goes you get to remember I want made to be the tale I made to be the head God did not save you and fill you with the Holy Ghost for you to be the devil's punching bag you standing as a soldier son and daughter of God you're equipped with the power of God in your life your acquit brother let me tell you something that little policeman standing on the corner then cars would run him over brother racecar would run him over but that little policeman right there could stand there and say stop brother he may not look like much but he's got the backing of City Hall he's got the backing of the mayor and let me tell you something as a son of God it's not you and I that heels to sit it's not us to change the situation it's not us who saves the loss it's not us who delivers and feels it is the Lord Jesus Christ we have an authority in his presence you see this was also showing that even as you and I think about it here where they're children how many years the Prophet been gone 54 years now 54 years almost a generation is how many years 44 the brem says if there is another generation every generation has got to have the same visitation children and different ones born in within the message things around our ranks but brother this is where God gave the promise your family your children others have crossed over but you also must be circumcised aren't you glad for that but they received the same experience with the same toxicity with the same power that you received in your life let me tell you something that's what Peter said when he declared by the Spirit of God the promise listen to you and to your children and to them that's far off as many as the Lord our God shall fall you've got the Holy Ghost in your bosom you need to stand on that promise and say as many as the Lord our God shall call this is - my children as well for my household believe and die in the house shall be saved you don't know how way where they are think about our way where they were it didn't change the inheritance Leviticus 25 Leviticus 25 verse 8 here is the year of Jubilee and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years known as seven Sabbath's right type of seven Church ages right then shalt thou calls the trumpet of the Jubilee this trumpet that's used is the shofar the shofar is for the shofar amen the trumpet of the jubilee you sound on the tenth day of the seventh month Tim seven tenth day of the seventh month that shall calls the ram's horn to sound [Applause] hallelu the ram's horn is what declares the authority for those in bondage to rise up proclaim notice this in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your and and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession are you with me unto his possession it already belongs to you and you shall return every man unto his family [Applause] this was before dr. Dobson come on somebody this is a sounding of a trumpet brother I'm telling you the ram's horn when it's sounded with authority it can take situations that are broken it can take two sticks and make two sticks one that's the power of this working of the Holy Ghost it can take a life that feels so broken it can take that in the sounding of that they can take to skip where houses have been divided in the house of Israel but God said I will cause envy to be put away from you I will take two spits and bring them together and they shall be one house [Applause] this jiggly it showed that there would be bondage that would come in and falling from an inheritance it showed that that God would give that every 50 years are you with me it showed that it's but it is a time pointing to the true Jubilee that was to sound and that is sounding God God was making a declaration this land belongs to me he let it know this land belongs to me I'm the one who cares for it my eyes are over it are you with me I'm watching over it I'm watching over your life God was led to be known this land shall not always be in the possession of another it will come back to its rightful owner [Applause] God was declaring that and God was also let it be known better than my children have got in debt and they become indebted and they sold themselves and they're maybe their family as well I'm also letting me know they don't belong to nobody but me this is my land this is my people they belong to me st. mother had you for a while but he spoke to say that the same as he spoke about that coat Luc's them let them go they are mine [Applause] this possession is our inheritance hallo there are some daughters one time by the name of the daughters of they're known as the daughters of Zelophehad November numbers 36 you can read it if you like later they came up now remember there wasn't any sons they had no brothers left so the portion that had been left to their father's house they came up as daughters and they came up and made a petition to Moses I said what happens to what's been promised to our daddy and when they spoke they said oh by the way our daddy was one who stood with the Word of God he stood with the Word of God so Moses takes it before the Lord tribe of Joseph speaks as well and they come to declare and say here the daughters of Zulu Fiat they may marry in the tribe of their father because the inheritance from their father shall not be taken and joined to another the inheritance will remain where it was brother our inheritance has not been removed our inheritance was always in Christ it is there in Christ and you and I are brought to that heritance hallelujah as daughter's of Jolokia you say I'm a daughter but Ruth knew how to present herself come on she knew how to present herself for redemption why because she received the direct unction there as Naomi was able to instruct her on the halls of redemption I'm just gonna saying right now I trusted you echo right with me this land this inheritance it belongs to us and to our children as many as the Lord our God shall call it belongs to us it belongs to our children this safe Pentecostal experience it belongs to our children it belongs to everyone every member of the body of Jesus Christ he belongs every son and daughter of God [Applause] when they came into the land as we said before they came into the land and you know here we go same with Jeremiah they got taken with Creed's and dogmas they got their eyes off of the life source are you with me they got their eyes and they started focusing on how to raise grain God said take it he laid it all out in the word planet you keep your focus on me it's what brother Tim Newman's was preaching you keep your focus on me I got your back I take care of you seek you first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added unto you but you get your focus when you try to be the best gardener in in the town then you get your focus off of him who is the life giver of the seeds that are in your life well I can do this and I can do this I'm gonna really try to do this you're gonna blow your head apart trying to do that you can't do it it takes him to bring his word to life inside of you and I it takes him to supply the rain it takes him the same one Gomorrah that Sosa's were in our heart it takes a hole in our heart we say Oh Lord Jesus thank you for your word we water with praise we water it in the light of the word we water it and then here he comes in the latter rain a time for the maturing of the seeds he's sown in our life and it comes to fruition within our life then what do we do harvest eat and so back so back that's the whole principle in Revelations 10 8 through 11 it's the word continuing to come to maturity in our life [Applause] the Jubilee was a time of grace somebody might have win in bondage on the 48th year when the 50th year comes they're going free 11th our worker receives the same reward as the first hour come on somebody you see they could go free this is what God declared in that 50 and that fiftieth year in the 49th year the trumpet is sounded see here was the Ministry of the Lord Jesus and Luke 4 he's sounding the trumpet proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord let's prepare to enter into the jubilee he's announcing the Jubilee year is upon us who was it that was proclaiming yet the atonement the lamb was proclaiming it this is the acceptable year see the Bible says and I was 8:28 it speaks of this of this visitation of the rest of God precept upon precept line upon line word upon lourve word for with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest where you may cause the weary to rest this is the refreshing when they walked out on the day of Pentecost we read about it when the day of Pentecost was fully come what was types back there now here the feasts themselves are unfolding not as types any longer it's in fulfillment it's in fulfillment these are the seven festivals the Feast of the Messiah in all of this begins to roll what does it do its setting it in motion who's setting in emotion the Lord Himself is setting the feast in motion so here it is on the day of Pentecost they were told to go and wait 40 days he was with them right and they were going wait they waited there and on tear at the tenth day what happened there came a ruin a rushing mighty wind from heaven and cloven tongues of fire came upon them what was that it was God dividing himself oh my here he was the Living God he subdividing himself into his people it was no longer God above us God with us in Jesus Christ but now God coming in his people what's he doing he's imparting the inheritance into the children of God the word has claimed them as his sons as his daughters and that one hundred and twenty they got themselves up there in the upper room and the Holy Ghost came down the life of the atonement came down the life that was sounded there with the black that spoke better things than that of the blood of Abel the sounding of that the announcement it was sounded there they came out of there on the day of Pentecost it glorified their soul hallelujah amen he quickened their body to a heavenly language their body to a heavenly language the place they're going to the quickening power ship their mortal bodies till their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an in mortal language what had happened now it had been turned to a pure language hallelujah the language of the Holy Ghost the language of God are you with me he had been all these other languages out there but now they've been brought back into the place of a boat that brother there is one Lord one faith one baptism one spirit there is one language I'm the new you hallelujah hallelujah hey man it raised them up or rapture them up into a different atmosphere than what they ever lived in how many knows what I'm talking about you say I'm living in an atmosphere I never lived in before but this is my land this is my land this is my land this is my land I'm looking through these I'm looking to the west I'm looking to the Lord I'm looking to the south this is my hello when they walk out of there on the day of Pentecost brother they received on the day of Pentecost the abstract of the title deed they had the title deed that said the Holy Ghost is mine let me speak to you this morning if what you've got is a title deed don't you throw that thing down don't you despise it but that title deed lets you know what belongs to you you take that title deed it's got a right of inheritance the Holy Ghost is the right of inheritance for you I don't care how young you are this morning I don't care how old you are this morning you've got a title deed it's a right of inheritance and the one who gave you that inheritance is here to enforce the claims [Applause] when the Holy Ghost came it was the abstract it cleared everything that was against it the devil could have had all of this condemnation living over but then when the abstract comes it removes all of that why because it takes you from where you're at and put you into the land which always belong to you and that's why you can never be satisfied outside of Christ because in Jesus Christ is your own land hallelujah [Applause] when they came out of that Upper Room oh my hallelu they came out of there brother Graham said it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds when Jesus died to redeem them back to them the grounds Oh God the grounds that belong to sons of God whereby shall I know I shall inherit these grounds these grounds belong to you and I the Holy Ghost what does it do it gives to us four grounds that always belong to us whether there was a lot of desolate things about our life dragons and everything else a lot of desolate things was roaming here in this life but these crowns these crowns below to the believer these crowns of God's Word it belongs to the believer there was a lot of squatters come on somebody there was a lot of devils that tried to get up on the word and say that's for a day gone by there was Devils that even after you heard the truth that tried to tell you it's not for you there were Devils that wanted to squawk here on the ground and say he's not your healer he doesn't love you he doesn't care about - your steal back but let me tell you this morning the grounds belong to you hell alone the grounds belong to you Allah as sons and daughters of God the grounds that were shut off they have been open it has been opened to you and I the grounds that belong to the believer presenting I'm been serving the Lord very long but you've got the same creative power inside of your bosom that said in the beginning let her be save God behind your flesh that can pray for the sick a same God behind your flesh that lives a victorious life come on somebody but same God living behind your flesh that when darkness and Groo would seek to come around there is a word light on the inside of you that says let there be light there's an atmosphere of the Living God the very creator himself living on the inside of you that deity is not in heaven it's in you these crowns belong to us I don't hardly want to stop because I've got away couple weeks in these grounds belong to the Jubilee it belongs to you how I was going to stop I get going on the next part we won't stop these grounds belong to you the holy ghost listen to me he comes to make known to you that you're a son and daughter of God you know why he does that first he wants you to know what rights belong to you because the Holy Ghost is given to sons and daughters of God and God lets you know you're a son of God you're a daughter of God you see it's something about the word that the rest of them can hear the word it don't have any meaning to it let's just put the devil on notice you might say he might tell you you sit around a long time but let me give you something a quote you can put back right in his mouth with five knows and the Prophet said he said an eagle an eagle a son of God can go a long time before they recognize they're a son of God but you see there's got to be a word that ministers our inheritance to you and I and that word that ministers our inheritance to you and I what does it do it builds faith within us to rise out of the barnyard it's building faith in Him that you realize I always was a son I always was a daughter then you can rise up and realize it's not your righteousness it's not your worthiness him that gives you the gift of the Holy Ghost hallelu the grounds that belong to us as believers now Singh to you and I this is our grounds and you rise up as a son of God as a daughter of God filled with the power of God and you realize as a son of God as a daughter of God you've got Authority you're living in this life by the authority of his life you have within your life the seal the circumcision of the Holy Ghost the devil wants to try to put sickness on you try to put torment on you try to put something on you you can stand there and say as a daughter of Abraham as a son of Abraham he's the Lord my lord that he loved all my diseases how alone he's my god his my Lord is my healer he's my righteousness the promises belong to me by his power that abstract of the Holy Ghost coming into your life it clears all the lien that was ever against you every accusation that devil can try to say this and this and this and this and this and this but God has the final say mine they always belong to me and I have brought them back to me God could call for a testimony service and say ask him how they got here and they would start the testimony and say I don't know but it's good to
