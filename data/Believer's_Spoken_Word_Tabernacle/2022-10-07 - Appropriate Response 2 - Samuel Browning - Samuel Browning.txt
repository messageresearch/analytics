you yeah yeah so appreciate the song service and just appreciate hearing your worship back there and my goodness I when you're being blessed I'm being blessed I'm glad that the blesser just doesn't stay here amen but it just it I tell you I just love to see God's people be blessed and encouraged and it's catchy you know and I I just I think of it many times as I know I've said this over the years but I think about it many times I think you know how many times that we we come in here and we're looking and sometimes you might think that a person is shouting or being blessed because they feel good and everything's lined up and it isn't always the case because many times the blessing that's coming is just recognizing he's here and in the midst of everything that's taking place God is pouring out a blessing and they just made themselves beyond all circumstances available to receive that blessing he's already this is this is where we draw amen our strength from in our life from it comes from him and we are just we are just so thankful to the Lord for that tonight and we want to just remember as we go into prayer I was listening to the prayer request and uh I didn't get a chance to get this to to Paul or the others but I want to remember brother Bobby Carper in prayer he's not not feeling well I've been in and out of the bed and just wanted to just remember him in prayer that the Lord will just touch him and give him strength and you know we prayed about that because he just had just fought through it different times brother Bobby fights with that where probably I don't think there's anybody else in the congregation has dealt with that because of particular surgery he went through years and years ago where he just you just everything just gets so blocked up and you can't there's nothing you can do and you can't even you can't even eat and you want to eat but you've been no better than to eat at all and so he's dealt with that at different times and uh when I say at different times sometimes it just it it just happens multiple times and then here just not feeling just kind of the congestion of things like that and coughing and so I just ask that we just remember him in prayer also brother Danny Lewis to text me let me know he wasn't feeling well as well and wouldn't be in service tonight so I know there's a lot of other requests as well there's request on our hearts and I'm glad that God's mindful of those you have a request on your heart you just want to make known to the Lord by an uplifted hand and let's just invite the Lord Jesus and would you just pray with me for these needs and let's just invite him to come in a special way here Heavenly Father Lord we are are standing here Lord tonight Lord by The Sovereign Grace of almighty God and Lord what a privilege it is that we can come before your throne Lord we can come in that all-sufficient name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our sacrifice Our Redeemer our Lord and father you see Lord the needs Lord upon the hearts of your children many requests that were already Lord read father many needs Upon Our Hearts and this right here Lord and brother Bobby and brother Danny Lord in their bodies the Lord and we pray father that Lord that you'll just minister to every request Minister Lord to my brothers Lord and father to every need Lord that's here behind every hand Lord we believe that God that Beyond every circumstance that you're more than enough Lord and we just invite you Lord that you'll come in a very special way tonight Lord we just ask the Lord that you'll minister to every need Among Us Lord may you just strengthen Lord may you pour out of your spirit tonight Lord you know what we have need of Lord and we just turn our cups up to you Lord and we ask that God that you'll fill our cups Lord we love you and we thank you tonight Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's look in the Bible if we could to Job chapter 2 thank you musicians in Job chapter 2. I just want to read just a few verses of scripture here in Job chapter 2 verse 1 it says again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord and the Lord said unto Satan from whence cometh thou and Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and asketh Evil and still beholdeth fast his Integrity although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause and Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man has will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face now if you read by here in this this verse 5 it it it it would read as though it was God's hand upon job and job job even would even express this in job 19. brother Bram will bring us around to it it wasn't God's hand but God was overseeing so we understand that it's it's God the hand of God because nothing can come our way no test no trial nothing unless God first permits it and the Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life in verse 7 so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and smote job with sore boils from the soul of his foot unto his crown and he took him a pot shirt to scrape himself with all and he sat down among the ashes then said his wife unto him Dost thou still retain thine Integrity Curse God and die but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh notice job never called her a foolish woman but here is discernment is Discerning you're speaking as a foolish woman so he's caught that what shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips and not if they'll go pull the next scripture up and you don't have to turn there let me just read that before we're seated out of second Corinthians 4 verse 7. but we have this treasure speaking of God's life this Revelation this light we have this treasure in Earthen vessels vessels that are fragile vessels that like that of a vase you would not treat a vase or piece of Pottery rough because you know it can break we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us what a way God chose to convey or hide his power and he did it you or I would not have chosen Earth and vessel a vessel that's weak a vessel that's frail a vast vessel that is so susceptible to so many things but God chose it that way so that he might be fully on display amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to continue just to speak here just a few moments on the thought we'd looked at a couple weeks ago unappropriate response and uh I would say that in one way job remember job speaks in one place of the scripture where he had feared something like this happening and he said that which I feared has come upon me and we in ourselves yet we know that as the prophet would direct us in the message perfect faith that we're not to be occupied or directed by fear there's a lot of thoughts there's a lot of things that can come to you and I that is very uncertain but there's one thing that's certain in the midst of every situation and no matter what it is and that's the Lord and that's who we're looking to because there's not one of us you know we say this but sometimes I wonder how much we really conceptualize it and take it in we're not even promised the next breath right we don't even know the next breath not let alone coming out and getting on the roads and going home into a job we're not promised even the next breath and sometimes we take even that for we can take that for granted I don't believe meaningly but to understand that in all of these things this is why every moment our trust is in the Lord and when we see this in the scripture here I I don't believe that this is something that we or I premeditate of what is my response going to be what is my response but I believe that we are looking to God and I believe it's God that gives us Direction and orders the response that comes out of our life because of our best late intentions there is nothing nothing that within ourselves that we could actually give the right or the appropriate response that comes from our relationship with almighty God and I just I want to say it in this way when we're looking at this as I mentioned before appropriate response it's not in any way when we take this thought as though coming to direct us of this is how you should respond this is how you should respond but we want to look at the word of God and how God gives us Direction and how we can look that there is a source that you and I we are able to draw from and there is a response that comes from the Throne of God and emanates out through our lives and I just just drawing from these words remember this is what we read in Job chapter 2. we're seeing we're seeing a man that is not dis disapproved but we're seeing one who is approved of God we're not witnessing one who is being corrected we're witnessing one who's being pruned we're not witnessing an anger and the wrath of God that's not what we're witnessing we're witnessing a trial and a test that is come upon job because there was a testimony going on in heaven job didn't know about that testimony service but what was more important job knew him who was doing the bragging in heaven and so when I look at this remember here we come into this chapter and all of all of jobs the wealth the his his children there of the ten children here they are you know the children are gone all of these all everything that is all around him in his environment that has been touched now when this this this testimony and God is putting the testimony forth once again as Satan has come with a petition to want to touch job's life and I want to draw you into two two places of the scripture here tonight where God speaks to Satan and he's asking him have you considered job a perfect man in verse three an upright man one that feareth God and a skeweth evil and still he hold it fast his integrity and I want you to catch that that verse of scripture that portion still he holdeth fast his integrity his wife mentions to him in verse 9 she says Dost thou still retain thine integrity and those two words holdth and retain it's the very same word and it means to be strengthened to Prevail to be hardened to be strong become strong courageous to be firm or grow firm or be Resolute so when we look at this job job is maintaining his Integrity because there has been a revelation of his sacrifice to him personally this is not DNA of job as though that we are to Aspire to be like job but it was whom job knew that gave him the strength in the midst of the trial and so God gives us an example or in samples in other words it is that of a display of what he did there this same life it will reproduce itself in the life of his children as testoster trials as situations come and it lets you and I see even in the midst of this there is a prevailing strength that comes from that revelation brother Brown would say it like this there's many many other things but I just want to draw from this part out of the message I know Brother Brad says job he's speaking of referring to that testimony meeting that was going on he says job not knowing all these things going on it brought the patriarch into a deep distress yet somehow when all was gone from him he still maintained his position in Christ I know my redeemer liveth and brother Brad makes this statement here he says now we come to those places we come to those places for we all come and I believe today he said we're gathered here for something like that for the same purpose we're all on the ash heaps I won't go into that tonight because sometimes the way the ash sheep itself could be brother random is explaining that he himself has just been on an ash sheep and the ash sheep he was on was when he went and toured uh T.L Osborne some Ministries and you know rubbing his hand on the marble pillars and everything else and realizing these Ministries came out from under my Ministry and here he starts into a state and saying I guess the Lord you just couldn't trust me now you or I would look at that and say that's not much of an ashy but be careful every one of us even in all of our weakness where the test comes there is an action it's very easy to look at somebody else's Ash Heath and say come on but we don't say come on we want to encourage them to know like Paul said the comfort that we are comforting you with is the same Comfort we've received in our tribulation is that right is to comfort one another that my brother my sister God is seeing you through the Lord is bringing you through I may not they may not know it and it doesn't have to be some feeling that I receive when somebody says it it's true God is seeing us through so notice when the ram says we are all on the ashes we have our troubles our ups and downs our bad moments our sicknesses our heartaches our disappointments I'm talking to Believers tonight yeah so we come to he said like this on an Easter morning to find words of comfort now notice what job says in job 19 23 remember throughout this time in the Book of Job job is not aware of that conversation that took place in heaven job doesn't understand what's even taking place and this is where brother Brandon picks it up and he says if we could understand it we would no longer need faith but faith is simply that I trust him he knows what he's doing anybody ever felt like circumstances are completely out of control I don't know about you but there's many times you stand there and you feel like things are so out of control you don't know what's taking place all around you that's when faith is needed faith is in something that's exhibited or shown on a Mountaintop but faith is shown when we're in the valley when we don't know the next step to take and it looks like notice disappointments our ups our Downs all of these things they come you can never you never we realize as a Believer you never get to a place in your walk with God that you don't experience disappointments this is why when the Lord Jesus came the Bible says he was a man acquainted with sorrows why did he have to become acquainted with it because we are acquainted with sorrows we experience ups and downs why is that because we are still dwelling in flesh bodies it's susceptible to get down it's susceptible to discouragement it's susceptible to all these things so we must never focus on it or ever think in a way brother random would say it in this way I believe in the message believe us without this he said don't ever think in this lifetime of this being glorified but he said what it must be is you must receive that strength and that change on the inside that enables your eye to bring the outer man in subjection and it's a as brother Brian I'm in the same quote described it a constant War okay you won the battle five minutes ago guess what there's another battle coming and it's not waiting till tomorrow it's paddle after battle after battle the Holy Ghost is not Battle free but the Holy Ghost is the strength of God that equips you as an overcomer in the midst of overcoming it's battle after battle overcome it after overcoming and whether you like it or not or you like it or not or I like it or not that here once the life of God has come on the inside it does not change everything all around me but it equips me with the strength on the inside and I know my enemy who is my enemy not Brian holdren I'm Tony Gomez not Richard Sanchez not not Kim Browning no it's not Bill Sanchez either I know what you're saying it's me me it's me it's a battle and sometimes we have to be reminded of that because even through that we can become disappointed it's not disappointed in God we get to looking at ourselves Hallelujah notice for job he's right here this this is expressing in job 19. and job is is looking at it and thinking that it's God's hand upon his life and remember tells us in three kinds of Believers as long as Satan could make job think it was his God that was doing it to him he had job whipped why because you're looking for us he's our Escape he's the one and yet when he's looking at God is doing this so what's he doing he's trying it's keeping him in a place and here he is this he's feeling whipped now watch I want you to watch this through this here is a Heroes a man of God it's the prophet of God this is a believer and in verse 23 says oh that my words were now written all that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and led in the rock forever for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroyed this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me if you and I if you haven't I encourage you tonight read the first part of this chapter when you get home because it would seem like this glorious Revelation doesn't fit there because for the first 22 verses job is defending himself and job is saying God's hands been moved against me but you know what that shows it shows how one is walking in their Humanity but it also shows let me read it to you just like this brother Brown describes him and says job stood and he looked it's important that we're standing and we're looking but it matters what we're looking at right no well let's say some things job let me just call the prophet is saying this he's seen his flesh all corruption he's seen blood all over him he's seen bull boils all over him his wife has come he's seen church members live he saw accusations come his way of being a secret Center he had his wife come into you look miserable why don't you curse God and die and brother Francis but about that time when he stayed with the word oh how important that statement is about that this is an appropriate response he stayed with the word if it had only been intellect it would have failed in that hour intellect can't hold because even when our intellect gives way there's got to be something deeper that holds you and I right there's got to be something greater that when the lights of the heaven go out or when the candlesticks get blown out there's got to be a greater light on the inside tying indwelling of an experience that holds you and I am but when I don't know what's going on I'm standing and I'm going to stay with the word I'm going to look to him yeah I see my boils yeah I see my disappointments yeah I see my sickness yeah I see all this around me I see the others departing this way and I see this but I'm gonna keep looking and My Sacrifice when he stayed with the word then the Lightnings began to flash Thunders roared and the prophet looked towards the sky he goes in to rehearse that verse I know my redeemer liveth notice but the brand draws our attention this first out of the midst of all this I know my redeemer liveth I know my redeemer He Who is to redeem me and the very next verse he connects them together my redeemer is God in my flesh I shall see God not another so I Redeemer who is it it wasn't the second person of the godhead it's God come down in Redemption for you and I so in the midst of all that was taking place in the midst of the boils and everything that was going on in his life in the midst of everything else there was an anchor in job's life like this he looked till he seen the resurrection well Samuel what are you saying well I believe what God is saying and directing with us and I've had this here we're looking right at some things here tonight that we've had before us here he was looking and he didn't stop looking so many times where the enemy comes at us and then we get our eyes off on other things keep looking at your sacrifice amen it's the only thing that's going to get you and I through tests and trials and remember the text and trials are not against us they are permitted to mold us and to shape us this is why when things come our way we it should not it should be the question of his Lord what are you trying to speak to my life you're not trying to speak condemnation but God has come to lead you and I and direct you and I what must I do stay with the word is that right because trials are going to come tests are going to come persecutions come but what will our response be what dictates our response well depends brother Samuel How Deep The persecution is that's not what dictates a real believer's response the response of the believer is dictated by the revelation of our sacrifice he looked till he seen the resurrection and know that he was included in it because he was keeping God's word I know that sounds that's very simple it's very simple but keeping God's word you can never get you never get above the ABCs because even when you get into algebra there's still ABCs there's a lot of variables that come our way right a lot of variables but there still is the ABCs in order to solve those problems it still takes ABCs so when you get into a big problem don't forsake the ABCs they are a part of every problem yeah my brother said no I'm big enough to handle this problem God will let you see really how big you are there's none of us that are big enough to handle problems and God will let us see you're not big enough but my God is big enough it's big enough and not big enough God allows the situation to come by our ways to let us and let it recognize and to see that God I'm not as big as I think I am that you might as well join them and say Amen with me you see we don't overcome but our knowledge we don't overcome by our intellectual understanding how many times you or I have seen situation you've seen over the years that people can quote the word they can call it a matter of fact they can finish certain quotes for what you do but that's not what counts what matters is where do we stand when situations come our way where do we stand in the midst of a test or a trial I tell your friends God doesn't come to put you and I doubt but he comes to let us know there is a resting place that you can stand I'm grateful for that this is why Brethren could say in the message how can overcome he said job offered the sacrifice he did everything God told him to do that's a simple key if you haven't done everything God's told you to do repent and do what you know to do is right right you can't stew in the past you can't live you can't live and God never intended you to live under condemnation it's Satan's desire to keep condemnation over your life it's like an eagle wanting to soar up and it hits those it it it it hits the bars of that cage and it comes right back down it's like well there's a hope there's a hole and it begins to rise and then the bars are there let me tell you there is one that is here to release the bars I'm glad about that he's a Liberator where the spirit of the Lord is there he is Liberty oh my more than just something that when we feel good sometimes there's times where maybe you might just talk something out and you feel good but it's got to come and Deliver us to where you're able to look and you know I'm free for the ram says he kept standing there he kept standing Joe kept standing there you know what they were you know what Satan was trying to do get him off that sacrifice but how could you get him off of that sacrifice because even though it was given as a type what identified job with the sacrifice that was in the mind of God was the revelation you can't separate a Believer from the revelation are you hearing me it doesn't matter how many tests how many trials doesn't matter what comes your way you can't separate a believer from divine revelation it's stronger than our mental abilities it's stronger than women what you think about yourself but the same I know this about myself but Revelation says I knew you before the foundation of the world and that's greater than what you know about yourself what does that do it causes me to submit to one who is in a greater Authority [Applause] the Bible goes under saying Hebrews 6 18 then by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which interest into that within the Veil it enters in it's an anchor just like the anchor goes in when you're out fishing or they put the anchor in you realize that when it comes to these big storms hurricanes you know what they do they go in the navel they don't keep them tied to the dock you know why if they keep them ships tied to the dock they'll sink what do they do they launch out yeah yeah right into the midst of the storm why because they're built to a standstill let me say this to you you're built to withstand the storm you're built it's not this this is weak I said this is weak this this complains constantly right this is the guy right here why but it's the man on the inside that man that never had the beginning of days nor ending of life that one that is a part of the Eternal that which is the word that that is our source of strength and when we can let that guy have the right of way you'll Crest every way he comes out with the quickening power in our life because remember hello I'm quoting from the message but when the whole when the Holy Spirit has come what does it come for it's come for Redemption to redeem the seed to Quicken the seed to bring it to life and then that that the holy spirit is not a temporal gift it now here it has ushered Us in and directed us into eternal life because the only thing is eternal is the word right and so it isn't your eye it's the word in us that's riding out the storms of life yeah oh my think of this job brother Brandon would say this and I just just pressed in looking at these these statements that brother Brown here are some nights ago I just just began to pull up after looking at this for some time and just these two words job maintained it just struck me night brother Brian was talking about all this that's going on all around him job maintained the promise of God he maintained a fellowship in the hours of trial and so much that he cried I know my redeemer liveth he's saying when his when his wife said what she did I want you just to listen this job was under the blood he'd offered the burnt sacrifice this is this this is a this is a great distinction here he knowed he was righteous because that's what God required what had God required that he offered the sacrifice you see it's one thing for God to make known and God it has to be God to make known the way if God doesn't make known the way how are you or I know how to approach it you can't have confidence you can't have confidence in your approach you understand what I'm saying even when they were standing Before Peter that day said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's the word that is unfolding the way so that you and I might walk with the confidence in the path of the word right this is why the word of man does not produce confidence it produces hope but God's word and job took that and he offered up the sacrifice it wasn't good enough for job just to believe on the sacrifice another word for salvation but for job here he had to offer when God revealed to job this is the provided way this is the way because remember job wanted to worship God job wanted to talk to him job wanted to know about God who put that inside a job but put that there God put it there and a longing Rose within job and job had to offer that sacrifice he had to become connected with what God had revealed let me say this to you God reveals the appropriated way but you and I must act upon that way it's not enough to know what's right but it is to do what's right because if we don't do what's right and we know what's right it's iniquity right so we're not just knowing what's right is not enough that's not what was holding job was connected with his sacrifice he had come under the blood and he had Divine fellowship with God because he knew him as a person though he slayed me yet I will trust him right it's a no-so brother random talks it like this under the blood of dark in and out see this is what the real offering of the blood that when we become partakers of it you see the Lord Jesus offered up his life and we here we come the Holy Spirit deals with the life and we believe on that that's the first step but the full work is is that we come under that blood and we become partakers of that life then we are under the blood then there is fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin everybody with me there's a fellowship it's a notion you see that's That's what Satan wants to work on Satan doesn't care how much you come to church how much you know about the message as long as you don't have any confidence that it's for you you don't care he's fine he's fine you can you can live that kind of a life he's fine with it you don't have confidence that it's for you but you see what God comes to do is deal with where is that lack of confidence now there can be many variables within that and God is still revealing and unfolding in our lives and there is a reality that takes place in us when you pass from Death unto life that you know it's not you're not looking back in condemnation there's a reality in your life you know I've passed from Death unto life something that is a reality that is changing your life let me say this to you it's not just what I don't drink no more I don't smoke no more I don't look at the wrong things no more it's deeper than that it's where he is your life it's where he's everything to you it's where every decision becomes based around him oh no it's where he is the theme of your life is that right this is where it comes down to the litmus this is where he comes down to the real a rubber meets the road and notice if there is anything anything that hinders from a no-so there's a remedy to take care of it you don't have to live one more day beneath your god-given privileges I want you to understand this right here tonight nobody lives beneath it but by their own choice God doesn't Force nobody to do it and the devil sure don't have any power to do it either there's traps and things that the enemy can put but there is a release through the blood of Jesus Christ is that right there's sufficient pardon and Grace you don't want to be like the man who was a soldier that was caught running in the in the line of fire he got caught running court-martial he was going to be shot right right but his buddy an intercessor one who really who who was interceding on his behalf went to President Lincoln President Lincoln wrote a simple note with his signature and here came a messenger with a letter a message from the president and his buddy wouldn't even look at it why are you mocking me why are you mocking me and remember you know you've heard the story they shot the man and here was the whole court case here's a letter that says this man's free his name's on it why was he shot and the verdict was that a pardon is not a part unless it's accepted as a part you don't earn a pardon you can't Merit a pardon you have to accept it you know what accept means I'm guilty but this is my freedom are you hearing me it's not it's not staying in the past but it's recognizing this is my Liberty let me tell you here tonight God has sealed his word with his presence this message has been sealed with cops on life the son of man whom the father has sealed he has sealed it with his presence the same holy spirit that gives unction tonight and this word is the same God signing his same one present right here tonight they had Fellowship they knew where they were standing he maintained job maintained this through his life he maintained this his Fellowship just the same nobody was righteous because he'd come by the way of the blood it held so good believing in the hours of Temptation though he slayed me yet I'll trust him that's what the blood does that's what fellas shift through the blood hey think of this this word we there's a common word for us maintain the word maintain it means to calls are enable for one to continue to keep something at the same level or rate to keep something in good condition to provide it with Necessities for life or existence it's to keep like a military unit equipment for battle job maintained his Fellowship throughout it all he maintained his position in Christ everything else all around he didn't have the answers for it but where was he standing he was standing on what he knew he was standing on what it was revealed to him and this is where our stand comes down that's why there has to be solid ground for us to stand upon that there's a place where we can stand and it's not sinking sand it's not slippery it's not shifting it's a place of firmness it's a place of solemnness it's a place where we can stand that I don't know about all this but I'm sure of this I'm sure of where I'm standing I'm sure of My Sacrifice job have you done this I'm not sure of that but I'm sure of this I might have a lot of speculating about like this but this I'm sure of yes and no matter what how they tried how it was tried you couldn't move him off of his sacrifice you know why for these were no longer between they had become one job and you and me and our sacrifice is to be one true right this is why Paul would write that when testings and everything comes around our life it says we bear about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus what was the dying nevertheless not my will thine will be done who took the form of a sermon a Living Sacrifice not my will thine will be done we bear about in the body hey Paul that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh God knows how to keep this guy humble now it's entrusted to you and I but God knows we need Divine assistance he's equipped us on the inside but God also allows situations to arise that then you and I can look at it and we realize there's a greater one there's a greater one Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes 7 18. let me just try to get here the Bible said it is good that thou should take hold of this yea also from this withdrawal not thine hand for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all notice who he that feareth God he reverences God reverence is where remember what job was doing job was staying with the word so you remember you stay with what God's revealed and when he reveals more we walk in it wisdom verse 19 strengthen us the wise more than ten Mighty Men which are in the city what what gives you a nice strength wisdom what kind of wisdom not Earthly wisdom Earthly wisdom reasons against the word of God but this is talking about a wisdom that gives strength to the wise this is the same wisdom without running out on this this is the same promise that God in this hour when all the corruption and all the deceit and everything would be at the height of where it is he promised in this hour he would send the gift of wisdom what is it a prophet yeah is that right a prophet that went uncover that I'm cut her working uncover everything through the Earth what did that and that wisdom you and I are partakers of that wisdom that's not from a seminary because all of that wisdom has led right back into her that wisdom has no power to extend her I know of individuals here of her and I'm seeing things seeing here in this country I'm saying I'm no of individuals that at one point in time in their stand even in their denomination there's certain things that they would stand against let me say this whether it's domination or not no denomination what gives a route right to alter true holiness Holiness is holiness are you hearing me now the message then all of a sudden bring bring about Holiness that was always in the word of God this is why when people walk away as soon as they walk away they put their short britches on and drinking their beer cutting their hair and everything else you know why because they were never connected with the Holy nature of almighty God and it never was a true worshiper because the Bible says in the Book of Psalms in the beauty of holiness Worship the Lord Holiness is his own nature be ye holy for I am Holy saith the Lord see it runs right back in there's no strength it becomes a wisdom Justice you know brought to my attention where some have said oh you know hey they don't have to do certain things no more oh we we've been delivered out abundance I'm talking about people and one time it would hold to a certain thing even in denomination would hold to a certain thing but now we've been delivered out of bondage we don't have to wear this and do this and do that bondage but you see it's only bondage if your nature doesn't match are you hearing me and clean a pig you can put him in help me somebody but you put him at a screen door don't you dare turn your back because if you don't have this nature change the first hint of mud he's gone what is that you say it's a pig what makes him a pig it's nature amen but if you could ever take that nature of a pig out of him and put a sheet nature in him you could blow all of the dirt right by the screen door you could have buckets of mud and you know what there ain't nothing there ain't nothing there you know why because everything that was identified with the mud everything that loved the mud everything that enjoyed the money is calm it ain't removing the mud it's removed the nature that loves the mud that's what the real revelation of a sacrifice he comes to do he comes to operate on the Inside Man because otherwise you're living alone I can't do this and the pastor sees me out here and oh what's he going to do about it that's bondage what doesn't want you because he's always seeing you as a matter of fact brother Brandon would say like this so clear in the message he said there are women wearing things that are not even shouldn't even be worn behind closed doors Hallelujah Glory how do I tell you what a lot of freebies here tonight huh but this is appropriate response I said this is appropriate response wisdom strengtheneth the last more than ten Mighty Men which are in the city so the mightiest of men the best warriors the best oh there's these guys are so strong no there's something greater than 10 Mighty Men 10 being what tribulation there's something that'll keep you in the midst of tribulation there's something what is it the wisdom of God what did the Bible say in the Book of James If any man lacks wisdom let him look up and ask God who liberally giveth to all right Lord I don't know about this I'm asking excuse me because he will give of wisdom that you and I have need of I'm glad about that aren't you for there is not a just man upon the Earth that doeth good and sinneth not let me read that again there's not a just man upon the Earth that doeth good and sinneth not um sticks a little bit in our crawl don't it because job was not perfect in himself what God was looking at when he said have you considered my my servant job a perfect man who is skeweth a Boris evil what was he saying job's confession was in his sacrifice the Bible says Be You therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect God taught Abraham what before me and be thou perfect how can you and I be perfect impossible but there's a perfect one who came down from Glory took my place took your place and now through the shedding of that perfect blood there comes a perfect loosening or the Holy Spirit comes in and through that new birth We Stand identified in him and through that Perfection of his life that's what draws you and I to the place to say forgive me that's what draws you and I into the place of confessing Lord You Are My righteousness Lord because a just man doeth good but there's not one not one that is without fault or failing but we have to look up are you hearing me we're not talking about a weakness of sacrifice we're talking about the strength of the sacrifice that there is a strength on the inside that you can't keep a Son of God down you can't keep a daughter of light on God down why there's a perfect Sacrifice by a perfect life man Isaiah 33. let me just read this and we'll close here because there's no way I can move through this this is where I wanted to bring us to into some of these places tonight the Lord is exalted Isaiah 33 5 for he dwelleth on high he hath to filled Zion with judgment and righteousness and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the Lord is his treasure notice what will be the stability what is our stability wisdom and knowledge not Earthly but that which comes from God that's what stabilizes us as Believers in this hour oh is the wisdom is the revelation of almighty God of God speaking to us you know sometimes it isn't that God gives you the answer to what you're going through he just simply comes by he might use a minister he might be listening to the message God has ways and he'll come by and let you know let me tell you something that's as good as if he gave you an answer because he's letting you know I know oh yeah I know I care I'm mindful and wisdom and knowledge is that it it stabilizes it'll be the stability of thy times what help what what stabilizes US what keeps us is the wisdom that comes from God that wisdom that look when I don't know the next moment I know where I'm standing like job I know where I'm standing and the appropriate response within it is we stand it's not the time to pull back when things when things aren't going the way that we think this should go or this isn't going just right listen these are things we have to learn and battle through are you hearing me tonight this is not condemnation 101. but it's learning 101. it's renewing of our mind because come on now because there's times where we can go we have certain responses to things without thinking the bull came to brother Brannon got up was coming at him and that pasture what did he say he did reach for his gun nobody had tell him that he just reached for it guess what he wasn't there it was on the seat of his truck and there's things that God brings you and I to this place because there's things that God wants you and I to see in the midst of a test or a trial in the midst of things in our life that we're looking at and sometimes we don't see him the way God sees him but when God begins to unfold that to us that's a moment to say be it unto me Lord forgive me I didn't realize that was standing I didn't realize that was hindering but see God does that in his own time because there are certain ways that we can respond to things and you know your response matters your response matters this is why when you get down and everyone I'm speaking to individuals that are veterans much older than myself that there have been times they've been down can I get a witness people been down it didn't feel like doing certain things or so forth and responses right the time when situations come disappointments ups and downs let me tell you something the world cannot satisfy what you have made of and if you go and try to satisfy other things well I just need a little bit of an outlet that you're not getting no strength from that I'll just I'll just look at a few things here you know on YouTube you're not going to get no strength from that he is the stabilizer of our life that's the time the battle where we have to say when the enemy comes along and says you know what I don't feel like going to church I don't feeling it you know why I've had a week sorry don't have no flowering way to say it right I don't feel like it this is the time we're Overcomers overcome this is the time where Overcomers stand these are appropriate responses that though I don't feel any different don't but I know that God is going to meet my need the devil could whisper you sword yeah but you know you could you could just you could get it all at home you know it's the condition your heart boy that God knows how to quote scripture man come on now preach with me what's he trying to do alter the response but there's times where you just simply have to take the jurisdiction over your body over your mind in other words like in the prayer letter that was sent out with every prayer cloth from The Prophet's office when there was a need in a person's body he ruined it like this and said you must doubt your doubts and believe what God's word has said about your case and confess it that's an appropriate response that's an appropriate response say God help me to evaluate my responses something doesn't go your way you just pull off come on I'm not here to condemn you I'm here to look but let's evaluate our responses when things don't go just exactly right or things aren't coming let's evaluate say God I want the appropriate response what is the appropriate response it's him Lord renew my mind Lord renew my mind what are you talking about I'm talking about drawing strength from the sacrifice he's not only the atoner of our sin is the atonement of our sickness he is all that we have need of he's our sufficiency when he made himself known to Abraham he said I am a shady eye the strength when I am weak when I'm in trouble when I'm down I call on the Lord and he hears me right it's one of what what kind of call is that it's a faith call Lord I know I know Lord you're my Lord you're my God Hallelujah oh God help us help us Lord to have appropriate responses remorless Lord shape us renewing of our mind renewing Lord Of Our Lives that the responses themselves might be sponsors that bring glory to his name aren't you glad about that I'm glad that he's working on us I'm glad he's changing us I'm glad he's here still stabilizing hearts and lives that maybe haven't went all the way but he's here to stabilize that life and he's here to minister to our needs to encourage us and say hey you're still growing I'm still working on you I'm still molding you I'm still shaping you I'm not trying to make you a perfect person you already stand perfect in me but I'm just wanting that perfect um Perfection of my life just to flow freely through you Lord what must I do oh I'm not asking you to change yourself I'm asking you just to yield to me and I will change I will mold you I will save you I will transform your life but Lord I know just yield to me just what do I do to stay in my presence but Lord I gotta go to work tomorrow but he would say to you my son my presence is not confined to this building but my presence will go with you but lord I can't listen to a message all day tomorrow but my presence is not confined to listening to a message there are times for that but lord I can't pray all day I'm date them or you can pray without ceasing but remember it's not always about being in your prayer closet or on your knees but Lord how do I abide in your presence you can invite me even in the thoughts of your mind and just begin to think upon my goodness and when you my son my daughter begins to sense the that's my presence so we're going to entertain what our sacrifice is because that's our identification because when God looks for you or me he's not looking at me or you he's looking at the sacrifice and as long as my confession is in the sacrifice it's accepted you're loving tonight let's pray father thank you Lord for your mercy once again see Lord we do not stand here Lord or sat or gather here with the profession Lord or a thought that we in ourselves are perfect we know we know better Lord we know that God that it's you that is our perfection it's your life lord it's you that we are resting in Lord we're not just believing on we are identified with the sacrifice were identified by that life Lord that moves inside of us that brings forth that same righteousness of your own life father I pray here tonight Lord those that hear streaming Lord you know where everyone's at God I pray father in the simplicity of your working tonight if if there is one Lord that has never come into that place with you may they realize Lord there is a stabilizer there is a place where there comes an anchor where there comes Lord a complete transformation where there comes a complete change where it's no longer us depending on our strength strength of Our Lives grant that Lord May there be just a real some sincere honest confession before you Lord move for those needs Lord whether it be one whether it be many move for the hearts Lord of your children you sent your word to bring healing to our lives and Lord we pray tonight help us Lord God forgive us Lord when our responses have not been appropriate Lord we accept the mercy and the grace of God and we lord invite o God and we ask the Lord for the renewing of the Holy Spirit the renewing of our minds Lord realizing that in that renewing sometimes lord it's the things that we are not even aware of but God you pointed out to us Lord as you've said very clearly in this service things that Lord that you know that had just been on my heart and looking at this thought as you continue to bring out that Lord there's a battle each moment there's a battle day after day but may we not be focused on the battle may we be focused on you who's leading us in the midst of the battle Lord may we stand as overcome our sword with that appropriate response and that response is you Lord it's you when job didn't know about everything else around him and Lord the truth be told when we're in the midst of a test or Trump we don't know about everything else around us we know a place that we can stand and that's in you Lord we're thankful so thankful for those sacred Sands so thankful Lord for that place because that's the place that we know I experience that's the grounds that we're shooting father we just pray tonight Just Have Your Way Lord we commit the service commit every heart every life Lord into your hands oh God and Lord we look to you take your direction and like job just staying with the word Lord fearing the Lord reverencing the Lord your word just coming under it Lord let the word have the right of way help us Lord we pray tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen Hallelujah yes [Music] I am so so needy Lord show me what I should do [Music] in this world of sin I am so make me good with me I am so needy Lord [Music] I am so needy Lord show me what I should do yes Lord hear all my draws away in this world away [Music] strength is perfect let's sing this if you'd like to stand listening to some his strength this person [Music] his strength is [Music] strength is going on he'll carry on us when we can [Music] carry on raised him tonight [Music] yes perfect is strength [Music] strength is perfect [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I tell you it's so precious we have ground to stand on we can draw from he's our source of strength I couldn't get into all that tonight but he's the place to draw don't make anything else your place of strength because it's not a place of strength he's the only one that is our strength he's our source of life he's our encouragement and you know that when situations and things come around sometimes we can have this report and other things can come around because brother mom just put it so clear and we see it and it encourages us when we I don't know if it does I believe it does for you too but when I read my brother Brian will say that we're not immune from those things we see how things come but I'm so glad that we have a source we can go to we have a place we can draw strength when different things comes our way he is our source of strength and I'm glad we can go to him that's why we don't look we don't look around because a lot of times we don't even know we don't even know what this one's going through or this one sometimes we know but in everything we know that brother Brown tells us actually was brother Neville and five identifications of the Church of the Living God but the never made a statement he said God In Prayer God those who are going through the most bitterest of Trials right now may we go to them in love and encourage them knowing that we also at some time we'll go through a bitter trial not because we'll go through a bit of trouble recognizing that there is strength that comes from the Lord and there's strength in the body there's encouragement in the body it's him it's him and when he comes that way we want to receive it Brother Carlos calls me up on the phones brother Samuel keep pressing brother now what if I said to Brother Carlos it's easy for you you ain't never been through this and Brother Carlos may have to Humble me a little bit and say no I have been through some of those things sometimes you see you say brother Simon what is it let's be simple enough to accept what God as God would send encouragement our way because whether we've been through it or not is God giving encouragement to his people I'm glad he's that kind of God aren't you he's our strength brother Samuel how does he do it I don't know I can't explain it but I know he gives us strength job said it like this he puts strength in US I don't know how he does it but I know he doesn't and I know he's my strength Giver and we can just draw from him let's sing this once again his strength is perfect [Music] when we had [Music] already [Music] come
