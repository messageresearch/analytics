[37:32] joshua chapter 1
[37:34] once again
[37:46] and i'm just i'm going to read through
[37:49] the first
[37:50] few
[37:51] verses they're beginning with verse 1
[37:52] just to pick up from where we were
[37:56] looking at a few weeks back
[37:59] and here we come into joshua 1 1 it says
[38:02] now after the death of moses the servant
[38:04] of the lord it came to pass
[38:07] that the lord spake unto joshua the son
[38:09] of none
[38:10] moses minister saying
[38:13] moses my servant is dead
[38:16] now therefore arise
[38:18] and go over this jordan thou
[38:21] and all this people
[38:23] unto the land which i do give to them
[38:26] even to the children of israel
[38:29] every place that the soul of your foot
[38:31] shall tread upon
[38:33] that have i given unto you
[38:36] as i said unto moses
[38:39] and if we could go on down to verse 5
[38:42] there shall not any man be able to stand
[38:46] before thee
[38:48] all the days of thy life
[38:50] and as i was with moses so i will be
[38:53] with thee
[38:54] i will not fail thee
[38:56] nor forsake me
[38:59] be strong and of a good courage for unto
[39:02] this people
[39:03] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[39:06] land which i swear unto their fathers to
[39:09] give them
[39:11] let's come here into verse seven
[39:13] only be thou strong
[39:16] and very courageous that thou mayest
[39:19] observed to do according to all the law
[39:23] which moses my servant commanded thee
[39:26] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[39:29] the left
[39:30] that thou mayest prosper whether soever
[39:34] thou goest
[39:36] this book of the law shall not depart
[39:38] out of thy mouth
[39:40] thou shalt meditate therein day and
[39:42] night that thou mayest observe to do
[39:45] according to all that is written therein
[39:47] for then thou shalt make thy way
[39:50] prosperous
[39:52] and then thou shalt have
[39:54] good success have not i commanded thee
[39:58] be strong
[39:59] and of a good courage be not afraid
[40:02] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[40:05] thy god is with thee
[40:07] whether so ever thou goest amen may god
[40:11] bless the reading of the word as you're
[40:12] being seated tonight
[40:14] i want to continue to look
[40:17] into this thought here tonight on
[40:19] inquiring
[40:21] of the lord
[40:22] and um we've been
[40:25] speaking on prayer since
[40:28] back there in
[40:29] january very
[40:31] just very specifically on that
[40:34] thought
[40:35] because
[40:36] prayer as we see it is it is uh
[40:39] it's a great privilege of the believer
[40:42] but it's also how that god has entrusted
[40:44] us that our faith would even operate
[40:47] to ask whatsoever you ask in in prayer
[40:51] and in faith believing that shall you
[40:53] also have
[40:55] we are supposed we are it's over and
[40:57] over that god has
[40:59] uh encouraged us to ask for those things
[41:02] the promises and what and what
[41:05] pertains to us and when we
[41:07] look here into
[41:09] the scriptures in joshua we know
[41:12] that this parallels the time that you
[41:15] and i that we are are living in
[41:18] in this hour uh to think of how that god
[41:22] sent a message down into egypt a prophet
[41:26] vindicated with the pillar fire with a
[41:28] message of deliverance and that message
[41:31] was to that was to call him out of egypt
[41:34] and take them into the promised land
[41:37] and we see even how that they
[41:39] were in that of the wilderness for a
[41:42] great deal of time but the wilderness
[41:44] was never meant to be the home of israel
[41:49] they were never meant to get comfortable
[41:51] there it was only a part which they were
[41:54] passing through
[41:56] and that's when we look and we can even
[41:58] see in the unfolding of things of even
[42:01] how that we know when the spies went
[42:04] over there were ten that went over and
[42:06] they looked at the opposition and they
[42:08] said we're not able to go in
[42:10] but there were two that said
[42:13] we're more than able to take the land we
[42:16] find ourselves in the time that we here
[42:18] we are living in
[42:21] that where the church
[42:23] has dwelt so long in the wilderness
[42:27] and god made a promise in his word that
[42:29] the church would not remain in the
[42:32] wilderness but the church must come into
[42:35] the place that god ordained them to be
[42:38] which is what it was back on the day of
[42:40] pentecost where it was not just a
[42:42] portion of god's life but it was the
[42:45] very god himself christ in his fullness
[42:48] dwelling in the life of the people it
[42:51] would be that of a life of a full word
[42:55] on display
[42:56] and we see how that the enemy came in to
[42:59] take away from the word even in the very
[43:02] beginning in that ephesian age but we
[43:04] are living in the time and the
[43:07] fulfillment
[43:08] where god has promised there would be
[43:11] another ephesians and god has done that
[43:15] and is doing that in this hour
[43:18] to take a people that you and i would
[43:20] come in to our position in jesus christ
[43:24] it would not be something that an
[43:26] organization can do
[43:28] but it would be a work of the holy ghost
[43:31] himself just as it was made known to
[43:33] joshua moses my servant is dead and we
[43:37] know that moses was a type of
[43:40] organization
[43:41] it could never take the people of god
[43:44] into position
[43:45] but yet god in his grace that was there
[43:48] all along joshua
[43:50] would bring the people into their
[43:53] position
[43:54] into a place of rest in the lamb to what
[43:57] god ordained for them what god had in
[44:00] his mind all along we are living in this
[44:04] moment we are living in a time to where
[44:06] when the scripture would call for and
[44:09] desire for the manifestation of the sons
[44:12] of god we are living in this hour and
[44:15] let me say this there is no way
[44:18] for that to happen the manifestation for
[44:20] the sons of god
[44:22] outside of god himself coming down in
[44:26] this hour and manifesting his word to
[44:30] draw you and i out and bring us fully
[44:33] into
[44:34] him this is god's work it is grace that
[44:39] has worked all along but now this is the
[44:42] time where the shoutings of grace grace
[44:46] unto it
[44:47] and so we're living in that time of of
[44:50] god's grace to you and i
[44:53] and i want to just draw the attention
[44:55] here in the scriptures if we can look at
[44:58] it of how that we see the certainty and
[45:01] this is just to draw from this because
[45:04] canaan itself is a type of overcoming
[45:09] canaan itself is a life that is being
[45:12] lived in the holy ghost
[45:14] canaan is the promised land of the
[45:17] believer which is the type of the holy
[45:20] ghost by one spirit we are baptized into
[45:24] one body and i want you to notice the
[45:26] word
[45:27] that we read here even in our text that
[45:30] there is no maybe there is no perhaps
[45:34] there is no might be but there is a
[45:37] certainty in everything that god has
[45:40] spoken to joshua as a matter of fact god
[45:43] has let him know it's time to rise up
[45:45] and it's time to move forward it's time
[45:48] to go across this jordan and notice
[45:51] everything is certain when we read those
[45:54] first few verses and i
[45:55] that verse you know in verse 5 there of
[45:58] joshua 1 to me is a powerful verse
[46:01] you know with just just a touch on him
[46:03] there shall not any man be able to stand
[46:06] before thee all the days of thy life
[46:11] no matter what it looks like no matter
[46:13] the opposition
[46:14] no man shall be able to stand before
[46:17] thee
[46:18] now it's not speaking of the natural man
[46:21] joshua
[46:23] but it is the word that he is walking
[46:26] and is veiled in his life that satan has
[46:29] to recognize that word
[46:33] is that right brother bran would say he
[46:35] said now satan you don't have to obey my
[46:38] voice but you have to obey him who i
[46:41] represent
[46:43] is that right
[46:44] so notice as i was with moses so i will
[46:48] be with thee what a comfort that that
[46:51] was god was letting joshua know there's
[46:55] going to be some bumps and hiccups and
[46:57] mistakes and failures but that's not the
[47:00] focus i'm going to be with you just as i
[47:03] was with moses what was god saying here
[47:06] without dwelling on this too much
[47:07] tonight is that your humanity is not
[47:10] going to be done away with but my glory
[47:13] will become so preeminent in your life
[47:16] it will override even your humanity
[47:22] sometimes we need we need the overriding
[47:25] of the glory of god when we have made
[47:27] mistakes
[47:28] when we have made decisions without
[47:31] inquiring of him first we need the grace
[47:34] of god overriding that is able to
[47:36] instruct us teach us correct us and help
[47:40] us so that we might go forward
[47:45] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[47:47] what a what a promise
[47:49] but notice god's requirement
[47:52] in verse 7 only
[47:54] be thou strong and very courageous that
[47:57] thou mayest observe to do according to
[48:00] all the law that moses my servant has
[48:03] commanded you don't turn from it to the
[48:05] right or to the left so in verse 7 and
[48:08] verse 8 which i can continue to read
[48:11] god's letting joshua know
[48:14] that victory is certain
[48:18] but there's something that you must do
[48:22] in everything as it comes to the end of
[48:25] verse 8
[48:26] that for then thou shalt make thy way
[48:30] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[48:32] success
[48:33] how will that be see that this word does
[48:37] not depart out of your mouth in other
[48:39] words
[48:40] let your life become so wrapped up in
[48:43] this word
[48:44] take things that you don't understand
[48:47] but meditate on it put it before god in
[48:50] prayer and say god i know this is my
[48:52] promise let your life become wrapped up
[48:55] so that you become so far away from your
[48:58] own
[48:59] natural
[49:00] sense-bound way of acting and you become
[49:04] god-like in your actions
[49:08] talking about manifestations of the sons
[49:10] of god because there is a power there's
[49:13] an atmosphere in this word i i'm telling
[49:16] you when you know you go to listening to
[49:18] the word you go to reading the word
[49:21] there is an inspiration in the word of
[49:23] god and inspiration that has come upon
[49:27] the word in this hour
[49:29] man didn't bring that inspiration that
[49:31] inspiration has come from almighty god
[49:35] this book has laid filled with promises
[49:38] it was just like that violin that laid
[49:41] there but there took a master one who
[49:44] knew how to play it and begin to unfold
[49:48] the promises that are in there oh my and
[49:51] god had a vessel on earth in this hour
[49:55] that god could come down in
[49:57] are you hearing me now there's no way to
[49:59] get the music out of the record without
[50:02] a victrola needle put up on the record
[50:05] and that needle is god's gift to this
[50:07] generation
[50:09] god said he would send the prophet and a
[50:11] prophet is not here with his own
[50:13] thoughts he's not here to speak his own
[50:15] understanding but this is the spirit of
[50:18] wisdom that daniel prophesied there
[50:21] would be a time of understanding that
[50:23] would strike the church of the living
[50:26] god and this is god's promise he would
[50:29] have a needle that would come down upon
[50:31] the record of the word and begin to
[50:33] release and reveal the thoughts and the
[50:36] contents that were sealed
[50:38] within so what should i do wrap yourself
[50:42] in this joshua
[50:44] just wrap yourself into it
[50:48] amen i think we need
[50:50] to live
[50:52] within this message
[50:54] i don't think it ought to be when we
[50:56] come to the house of god this is the
[50:58] only time that we're hearing excerpts
[51:00] from the message we need to avail
[51:03] ourself in the message of the hour
[51:06] we need to put it on put it on when
[51:07] you're driving put it on in your home
[51:10] avail yourself in it you say brother
[51:12] samuel what are you talking about i'm
[51:14] talking about inspiration brother and
[51:16] sister when i'm sitting and i'm
[51:18] listening or i'm walking and i'm
[51:19] listening i tell you there's inspiration
[51:22] after inspiration and even after that
[51:25] message is off or i've had to pause it
[51:27] there's still inspiration that is moving
[51:30] out
[51:32] i'm not standing here preaching my
[51:34] inspiration
[51:35] i'm preaching by an inspiration of
[51:37] almighty god
[51:39] that's why the prophet could say in the
[51:41] third exodus what is he said that cloud
[51:44] out there in sabino canyon he said it's
[51:46] the inspiration that has come to the
[51:49] church of the living god to lead us out
[51:52] of creeds and dogmas and lead us to a
[51:54] living reality where now is not god and
[51:58] man twain but god and man have become
[52:01] one
[52:04] hallelujah so this book of the law shall
[52:07] not depart out of thy mouth
[52:10] be wrapped up in this let it be wrapped
[52:13] up in your life
[52:16] brother brandon would say it like this
[52:17] and i referred this to you before he
[52:19] said
[52:20] thy mouth what you're saying just don't
[52:22] read it and walk away speak it live it
[52:26] teach it
[52:28] i'm going to say god let me be so
[52:30] wrapped
[52:30] up remember how brother julie used to
[52:33] talk about that caterpillar he said that
[52:35] old ugly caterpillar he said but that
[52:37] ugly caliper he said what happened is he
[52:39] said it comes to a certain time it just
[52:41] starts spinning and what happens it
[52:43] begins to get wrapped up and tied up and
[52:45] tangled up
[52:47] right and inside of that cocoon
[52:50] uh that it has what takes place on the
[52:52] inside of there in the secret place
[52:56] there is a metamorphosis there is a
[52:58] change from an old ugly caterpillar
[53:01] it'll come out in a determined date of a
[53:03] beautiful butterfly
[53:06] what is it that butterfly was there in
[53:09] it the whole time it but it took that
[53:11] and that getting wrapped up getting
[53:13] tired of getting tangled up getting
[53:15] wrapped up it would release the
[53:17] butterfly on the inside let me say this
[53:19] the only thing that will release victory
[53:22] in our life that releases a son and god
[53:24] a daughter of god is the word of this
[53:27] hour there is inspiration that god is
[53:30] poured out in this hour
[53:32] and that gives you in our inspiration of
[53:34] how to pray and what to pray about
[53:39] glory be to god
[53:41] oh my now notice this
[53:43] we want to be wrapped up
[53:45] notice let's go to joshua chapter 3 here
[53:48] we're talking about inquiring of the
[53:50] lord
[53:52] because god let him know
[53:53] no man will be able to stand before you
[53:55] but
[53:56] i want to tell you this only be strong
[53:58] and very courageous
[54:00] stay before
[54:01] the word
[54:04] amen
[54:08] hallelujah now joshua chapter 3 verse 1.
[54:13] joshua rose up early in the morning
[54:16] and they removed from him and came
[54:18] to jordan he and all the children of
[54:21] israel and lodged there
[54:23] before they passed over
[54:24] and it came to pass after three days
[54:26] that the officers
[54:28] went through the host
[54:30] and they commanded the people saying
[54:32] when you see the ark
[54:33] of the covenant of the lord your god and
[54:36] the priest bearing it then you shall
[54:39] remove from your place
[54:41] and go after it now notice
[54:45] here
[54:46] the people have come to a place
[54:49] the report has come back to joshua
[54:52] regarding jericho
[54:54] it's come back already
[54:56] that the people are trembling
[54:59] the people of the land are fearful
[55:02] and what they're fearful about is what
[55:04] god has done in the past
[55:08] come on now
[55:10] but you can't live off a past revelation
[55:12] you've got to have a press in revelation
[55:17] hallelujah that's why you might it must
[55:19] be present in our life that's why there
[55:22] must be a refreshing
[55:24] oh hallelujah
[55:26] notice he told the people when you see
[55:29] the ark of the covenant of the lord your
[55:30] god and the priests are bearing it then
[55:33] you shall remove from your place and go
[55:36] after
[55:37] it
[55:38] oh my so not after
[55:41] the priest but after the word as it's
[55:44] moving
[55:46] verse 4 yet there shall be a space
[55:48] between you and it
[55:50] about two thousand cubits by measure
[55:52] come not near unto it that you may know
[55:54] the way by which you must go
[55:59] how many like tailgating
[56:02] anybody like tailgaters
[56:04] people who drive on your bumper
[56:08] so close you could reach back and floss
[56:10] their teeth if you
[56:12] you get i mean you really i mean if
[56:14] probably if you're like me or somebody
[56:16] else you know you just you just start to
[56:17] slow down and hope they just go on
[56:19] around you because you don't know what
[56:21] they're doing you don't know what
[56:22] they're on you're just thinking if if
[56:24] they keep going this way if i have to
[56:25] stop for sure we're going to get it in
[56:28] in in in the back
[56:30] right
[56:31] but he noticed when you when a person is
[56:33] tailgating so close they can't catch if
[56:36] there's a sudden movement like if a cat
[56:38] runs out or something happens and you
[56:40] have to make a movement they are too
[56:41] close in order to catch the movement but
[56:44] if there are placed at the proper
[56:47] distance then when something comes out
[56:49] they're able to move right with it and
[56:52] able to flow right with it god has set
[56:55] it up that you and i would not be on top
[56:57] of the word this is why sometimes when
[56:59] the word is coming forth and you look at
[57:02] the word you say my it's so far out
[57:04] there brother samuel it seems like it's
[57:07] right out here god has intended it he's
[57:09] not taken the word away from you he's
[57:12] trying to show you so that the word is
[57:14] in clear vision so that you can step and
[57:17] you're following the word because it is
[57:19] the symphony that is following the beats
[57:22] on earth that is being orchestrated so
[57:26] that we can move and begin to prepare
[57:28] and we can pray about those things that
[57:30] god is making known this is why that the
[57:34] word itself when it's coming that's why
[57:36] paul could say
[57:38] i seek to apprehend
[57:41] that which i'm apprehended of
[57:44] paul here is the first church age
[57:46] messenger he said i do not count myself
[57:49] to be perfect
[57:51] in other words i've obtained everything
[57:54] but he said i seek after so he's paul's
[57:56] following closely as the word is moving
[58:04] for you have not passed
[58:06] this way
[58:08] before
[58:10] and joshua said unto the people sanctify
[58:13] yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do
[58:15] wonders among you
[58:17] and he spake to the priest and he said
[58:19] take up the ark of the covenant and
[58:20] passover before the people and they took
[58:22] up the ark of the covenant and went
[58:24] before the people
[58:25] and the lord said unto joshua this day
[58:29] will i begin to magnify thee in the
[58:31] sight of all israel that they may know
[58:33] that as i was with moses so i will be
[58:36] with thee and thou shalt command the
[58:39] priests that bear the ark of the
[58:40] covenant saying when you are come to the
[58:42] brink of the water of jordan ye shall
[58:45] stand still
[58:47] in jordan
[58:50] you know brother branham would would
[58:52] take this and we kind of spoke on this a
[58:54] little bit on one of the sunday services
[58:57] you know brother brown would talk about
[58:59] how that there were men
[59:01] in the camp
[59:02] that he said no doubt
[59:04] had been engineers
[59:06] in egypt
[59:08] and they were looking at this statement
[59:11] prepare to go across jordan here it's
[59:15] time
[59:16] and his engineers
[59:18] they could be in their mind it would be
[59:21] a natural thing to try to look at things
[59:23] how they had you know uh worked on all
[59:26] of those things of egypt and you know to
[59:28] erect something there in egypt and uh on
[59:31] those pyramids and how to do this and
[59:33] again tapped into all those laws of
[59:36] physics and things that were there
[59:38] but you know
[59:39] as they stood there
[59:41] it was not god was not going to use
[59:44] their engineering minds or their
[59:47] intellect this was a moment that we were
[59:50] standing before it didn't make sense to
[59:53] cross right now
[59:56] there's sometimes in things that you and
[59:59] i know there's things we're brought face
[1:00:01] to face with it doesn't make sense
[1:00:05] we don't know how we're going to get
[1:00:06] crossed we don't know how we're going to
[1:00:08] get through the mountain's too high
[1:00:10] valley's too low there's a river there
[1:00:12] we don't know how we're going to get
[1:00:15] through it
[1:00:16] but here's the secret
[1:00:20] the bible said lean not
[1:00:22] to your own understanding
[1:00:28] but trust in the lord with all
[1:00:31] thine
[1:00:32] heart
[1:00:34] that's what faith is it's trust
[1:00:37] i think brother jury referred to that
[1:00:40] statement brother brown had made in
[1:00:41] their message where the person said
[1:00:43] you know
[1:00:44] i was trusting god till the reigns broke
[1:00:47] on the horses
[1:00:50] until they broke
[1:00:52] like brother branham reiterated well
[1:00:53] that's the very time when they broke you
[1:00:55] needed to trust
[1:00:58] you see trust is when you don't have
[1:01:01] anything to grab a hold of
[1:01:03] whether it's with see taste feel smell
[1:01:06] here reason conscience memory you have
[1:01:08] nothing with one of those gates to grab
[1:01:11] a hold of
[1:01:13] and that's where trust it comes in in
[1:01:16] our life
[1:01:17] experiences
[1:01:19] experiences builds it builds faith it
[1:01:22] builds patience it builds this in our
[1:01:25] life
[1:01:26] this was a building moment in their life
[1:01:30] many of them that are standing right
[1:01:32] here in this moment in joshua 3
[1:01:35] some of them have been young people
[1:01:37] walking through the red sea
[1:01:40] are you with me
[1:01:41] some of them had been there
[1:01:43] some of them had had been and had you
[1:01:45] know they were young they had seen you
[1:01:47] know coming out of egypt
[1:01:50] but there had to be a fresh experience
[1:01:53] for their lives
[1:01:56] there had to be a witness of god's power
[1:01:59] for their lives
[1:02:01] oh my
[1:02:03] think of this
[1:02:04] brother brown would say it like this he
[1:02:05] says watch what joshua did
[1:02:08] what did he put first the clergy no sir
[1:02:12] he put the word first and he said take
[1:02:15] that ark and all you preach stay away
[1:02:17] from it get behind it don't try to lead
[1:02:21] it let it lead you
[1:02:24] and he said that's the trouble today
[1:02:27] we try to get ahead of the word and
[1:02:30] bypass and make the word to fit this and
[1:02:33] the word to fit that
[1:02:35] bless your hearts what we need today is
[1:02:38] follow the word
[1:02:42] every one of us have no doubt
[1:02:44] put together a puzzle at some time
[1:02:48] and we have tried to put pieces together
[1:02:51] in the puzzle that we thought sure as
[1:02:53] the world they belong here
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:58] and we could spend minutes looking at
[1:03:01] those pieces
[1:03:03] i like the puzzles that got big pieces
[1:03:05] like this it's
[1:03:07] i don't like them little ones but
[1:03:09] we can sit there and look at you're what
[1:03:10] are you looking at we're looking at
[1:03:12] characteristics that are there and we're
[1:03:14] trying to put it together and you know
[1:03:17] when we were
[1:03:18] younger some of the puzzles that i
[1:03:20] ruined as i was just a little boy is
[1:03:23] because i tried to put pieces together
[1:03:25] that didn't belong together
[1:03:27] you say how did you do that well i had
[1:03:29] to try to use strength
[1:03:31] my own strength
[1:03:32] and it's taken a lot of work and ended
[1:03:34] up bending pieces bending back the
[1:03:36] picture it didn't look so nice
[1:03:40] but you see that's sometimes the way
[1:03:42] that we can get into things
[1:03:45] we can get in to try to make things fit
[1:03:48] let me tell you something we don't have
[1:03:50] to make god's word fit our life
[1:03:54] we don't have to make god's word fit any
[1:03:56] situation
[1:03:59] we don't listen god is not entrusted to
[1:04:02] me nor anybody to vindicate his word
[1:04:06] he's the one who vindicates it
[1:04:10] is that right he don't need me to get on
[1:04:12] facebook and prop up this and prop up
[1:04:14] that he doesn't need me to do that let
[1:04:17] me tell you something what's a clear
[1:04:19] sign when you've got real peace here in
[1:04:21] the will of god you don't need to
[1:04:23] vindicate anything
[1:04:26] come on friends
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:29] joshua look when he steps out and tells
[1:04:31] the people we're going over in three
[1:04:33] days
[1:04:35] where did god say three days
[1:04:38] i can't preach on that a lot right now
[1:04:40] where did god say that but you see he's
[1:04:42] so in contact with god till his ways
[1:04:46] have become god-like
[1:04:49] he knows there's power in three days
[1:04:53] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:04:56] the holy ghost our lord raised up on the
[1:04:59] third day oh there's power there's an
[1:05:02] outer court an inner coat and the
[1:05:03] holiest of holies there is power in
[1:05:06] three days we're going over
[1:05:08] he's i won with the characteristics of
[1:05:11] god
[1:05:13] oh god's mind is speaking
[1:05:15] through his life so our duty
[1:05:18] is to follow the word not try to make it
[1:05:20] fit and you know it's like brother
[1:05:22] brandon would say remember he talked
[1:05:24] about
[1:05:25] i think it was one of his relatives
[1:05:28] they had that prayer book and they were
[1:05:29] praying
[1:05:30] and things didn't work out they threw
[1:05:33] the prayer book in the
[1:05:34] fire brother bradman says
[1:05:37] well he says what was wrong is you were
[1:05:40] trying to change god's mind
[1:05:43] he said god's mind don't need no
[1:05:44] changing
[1:05:45] it's our mind that needs changed
[1:05:50] right it doesn't say our father which
[1:05:52] are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
[1:05:54] kingdom come thy will be done
[1:05:57] what i want done let it be that that's
[1:05:59] what heaven wants done
[1:06:01] no
[1:06:02] but whatever
[1:06:05] from heaven let it be reflected in earth
[1:06:08] what prayer is is god i'm setting myself
[1:06:11] aside that heaven might be made manifest
[1:06:15] in earth
[1:06:18] hallelujah it's a powerful thing and
[1:06:20] it's not things that we have as soon as
[1:06:22] listen friends this is where it comes
[1:06:24] down to putting your lunchbox when you
[1:06:26] feel like you've got a pound and put
[1:06:27] stuff together right there just step
[1:06:29] away from it
[1:06:30] say wait a minute god you never called
[1:06:32] me to make things fit
[1:06:33] you called me to follow
[1:06:36] you called me to follow now listen
[1:06:37] sometimes we want to take things we want
[1:06:39] to try to make our loved ones fit
[1:06:43] we want to try to make things fit and do
[1:06:45] this and do that and do this what
[1:06:46] happens it drives them away
[1:06:49] i believe a standard of the word i
[1:06:51] believe we hold a standard in our homes
[1:06:53] it's a standard there's no option
[1:06:55] there's no excuse there's no budging on
[1:06:58] it this is the standard of this home
[1:07:03] is that all right
[1:07:05] never has been an option in this house
[1:07:08] right here of uh of coming to the house
[1:07:11] of god when our boys they started
[1:07:12] working when ben's started working i
[1:07:14] told him right up i said if you need me
[1:07:16] to go in there and talk to their
[1:07:17] managers i'll go right in there and talk
[1:07:18] to them but thursday nights and sundays
[1:07:21] we're to be in the house of god
[1:07:24] but samuel they may not have hired him i
[1:07:26] know a god who's bigger
[1:07:29] i know a god who's greater i don't
[1:07:31] preach a puny god i don't preach a god
[1:07:34] who can't move i'm a witness myself
[1:07:36] working in those kind of situations
[1:07:39] tell me god won't make a way where
[1:07:41] there's a desire to be in the house of
[1:07:43] god god will make a way
[1:07:50] oh my oh my wow i tell you a lot of free
[1:07:53] things coming out
[1:07:54] but notice our duty we don't need to try
[1:07:57] to put things together
[1:08:01] the word
[1:08:02] led the way so notice brother ben said
[1:08:05] the word led the way when it got to the
[1:08:07] jordan she opened up and they went right
[1:08:09] over
[1:08:10] why did the jordan open
[1:08:12] because they put the word first
[1:08:17] see joshua had a responsibility in his
[1:08:20] life be strong and courageous
[1:08:23] lord sometimes there's some hard things
[1:08:25] that you're asking me only be strong and
[1:08:27] courageous joshua this gospel is not for
[1:08:31] the faint of heart
[1:08:33] this gospel it requires strength and
[1:08:37] courage
[1:08:38] to be able to look into that word and to
[1:08:41] line up with that word and say be it
[1:08:43] unto me lord notice his first campaign
[1:08:46] he put first things first he had a
[1:08:48] reason for that because god had
[1:08:50] commissioned him stay with the word
[1:08:53] and let the word do it
[1:08:59] every campaign they went forth in the
[1:09:01] battle because god had charged him
[1:09:03] to put the word first
[1:09:05] and after the ark went forth
[1:09:07] what went forth then singing players of
[1:09:09] instrument before the fight took place
[1:09:12] but graham said that's what we need
[1:09:13] today is
[1:09:14] we needed singers you said what we had
[1:09:16] this morning we had singers instruments
[1:09:18] playing music rejoicing i mean no
[1:09:20] singing gives courage
[1:09:23] abraham tells us in 1965 believe the
[1:09:25] message leadership he said singing
[1:09:28] gives courage to the believers entering
[1:09:30] in to take the promises
[1:09:34] is that right
[1:09:35] oh my tell you what a wonderful just i
[1:09:38] tell you what a wonderful presence just
[1:09:39] was coming right back through there when
[1:09:41] i was sitting back there in the office
[1:09:43] just hearing you as a children of god
[1:09:46] rejoicing
[1:09:48] and knowing no doubt your rejoicing is
[1:09:50] pressing beyond discouragements and
[1:09:53] trials and tests and disappointments but
[1:09:56] you're pressing beyond it
[1:09:59] because you know that those things that
[1:10:01] are there they're lying vanities
[1:10:05] it's not they're not real and they're
[1:10:06] feeling but they're only barriers it's
[1:10:08] trying to keep me
[1:10:10] from entering into god's presence
[1:10:16] brother brandon when he preaches the
[1:10:17] message greatest value of her fart look
[1:10:19] at some of the words he used in there
[1:10:20] chop
[1:10:21] and he uses multiple words on how you
[1:10:23] come and approach the enemy you chop at
[1:10:26] him and you know it goes on and on again
[1:10:28] just so many different words to express
[1:10:30] how did we come and we fight against the
[1:10:33] enemy sometimes it's not just one swing
[1:10:35] it's chopping at it
[1:10:38] chopping out of chopping at it chopping
[1:10:40] at it chopping at it chopping at it
[1:10:43] is that right
[1:10:44] well i must not be that strong in faith
[1:10:46] because i've had the chop don't you
[1:10:48] believe that lie
[1:10:49] that ain't true whatsoever you're
[1:10:51] chopping at it shows as a son or
[1:10:54] daughter of god that this is god's
[1:10:56] promise and if i've got to take you
[1:10:58] little by little i'm going to take you
[1:11:01] down because this is my promise
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:06] hallelujah
[1:11:08] that's what brother ramsey said when we
[1:11:09] speak to that mountain you may not see
[1:11:12] it but one grain of sand has turned
[1:11:14] loose
[1:11:16] but that grain of sand that's turned
[1:11:18] loose is a testimony the rest of the
[1:11:20] mountain is on its way
[1:11:25] notice then put the word first read the
[1:11:28] word then the battle sets in and we're
[1:11:30] bound to win we just got to win stay
[1:11:33] right with it keep its direction and
[1:11:35] it'll keep you
[1:11:37] in the hour
[1:11:38] of trouble let me just let me let me
[1:11:41] finish out here in joshua 3.
[1:11:44] joshua said to the children of israel in
[1:11:45] verse 9 come hither and hear the words
[1:11:48] of the lord your god hereby
[1:11:51] you shall know that the living god is
[1:11:53] among
[1:11:54] you
[1:11:56] and that he will without fail drive out
[1:11:58] from before you the canaanites the
[1:11:59] hittites the hivites parasites
[1:12:01] gergescites amorites and jebusites
[1:12:04] behold the ark of the covenant of the
[1:12:07] lord of all the earth passeth over
[1:12:10] before you
[1:12:12] into jordan
[1:12:15] the word
[1:12:16] is going before you
[1:12:19] into the jordan
[1:12:22] aren't you glad the word became flesh
[1:12:26] aren't you glad that the word became
[1:12:28] flesh and the word paid the price for
[1:12:30] you and i
[1:12:32] the word is leading the way this is a
[1:12:35] word campaign
[1:12:37] now therefore take you out twelve men
[1:12:40] out of the tribes of israel out of every
[1:12:42] tribe of man and it shall come to pass
[1:12:45] as soon as the souls of the feet of the
[1:12:48] priests that bear the ark of the lord
[1:12:51] the lord of all the earth shall rest in
[1:12:53] the waters of jordan that the waters of
[1:12:56] jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[1:12:58] that come down from above and they shall
[1:13:00] stand
[1:13:01] upon a heat
[1:13:04] what a promise
[1:13:08] take the word
[1:13:10] and let the word go to leading
[1:13:13] take the word you say how do i place the
[1:13:16] word first take the word into your heart
[1:13:19] take the word take a hold of the promise
[1:13:21] of god's word listen
[1:13:23] that jordan was not opening because of
[1:13:27] their feet
[1:13:30] the feet was what was on earth
[1:13:34] come on now
[1:13:36] i'm just not trying to run away and run
[1:13:38] over in revelation but that faith was on
[1:13:41] earth
[1:13:42] but the but the waters had to obey
[1:13:46] the lord the ark of the covenant of the
[1:13:49] lord of all the earth
[1:13:52] it was representative that almighty god
[1:13:56] was present right there they can look at
[1:13:58] that and say well that ain't nothing but
[1:14:00] a little box of of wood that's covered
[1:14:03] over with gold but it was a place that
[1:14:05] god said i'll meet you i'll commune with
[1:14:08] you right there i'll express my secrets
[1:14:11] to you
[1:14:12] let me tell you something after they got
[1:14:14] in this land one time the philistines
[1:14:16] got a hold of this ark
[1:14:20] there was a man by the name of eli right
[1:14:23] he wasn't doing right
[1:14:25] one tended to his home
[1:14:28] hello now
[1:14:29] and the ark of the lord got taken
[1:14:31] captive
[1:14:35] but there wasn't one god down there in
[1:14:38] the philistine house that could stand
[1:14:40] out to the presence of almighty god
[1:14:44] think about it then big old gods
[1:14:46] plastered up on the wall which were no
[1:14:48] gods
[1:14:50] and here was god represented notice in a
[1:14:53] type yes in a type of when god would
[1:14:58] come fully into his place of rest in the
[1:15:02] heart of man
[1:15:04] showing that when god would get his
[1:15:06] place there's not a devil big enough or
[1:15:09] bad enough that can stand before the
[1:15:12] living god it's not your flesh or my
[1:15:15] flesh it's god on the inside
[1:15:19] satan has to recognize that word
[1:15:22] that's there on the inside that's why
[1:15:24] when we go before the throne of god
[1:15:26] we're not going as poppers
[1:15:29] we're not going demanding we're going
[1:15:31] with boldness
[1:15:34] i'm not coming into a place that i'm not
[1:15:36] invited and doesn't belong to me
[1:15:40] i mean you might tell me brother samuel
[1:15:42] go in my refrigerator help yourself it's
[1:15:44] still your refrigerator
[1:15:47] all right
[1:15:48] it's still your refrigerator
[1:15:51] but when it's something that belongs to
[1:15:53] me
[1:15:54] i'm not worried about because it belongs
[1:15:57] to me
[1:15:58] i'm not worried about will i drink too
[1:16:00] much milk
[1:16:02] will i eat too much cheese
[1:16:04] will i have too many pickles i'm not
[1:16:06] worried about that because it belongs to
[1:16:08] me
[1:16:11] that's why it must be a personal
[1:16:13] experience and we
[1:16:16] dwell in that reality that i'm not a
[1:16:19] pauper i'm not a servant i'm a son and
[1:16:23] daughter of god
[1:16:27] hallelujah when you've got a need or
[1:16:29] i've got a need you might say brother
[1:16:30] saying i don't feel like much of a
[1:16:32] christian it ain't based on what you
[1:16:35] feel like it's based on who you are
[1:16:38] the waters don't move based upon what
[1:16:41] you feel like the waters move because
[1:16:45] the god of all heaven and earth is
[1:16:48] dwelling inside of you
[1:16:50] oh we might as well preach why we're
[1:16:52] here
[1:16:53] oh the devil wants to make you think
[1:16:56] you're some trodden down something
[1:16:58] you're not a trodden down something
[1:17:00] you're a son and daughter of the living
[1:17:03] god
[1:17:06] hallelujah you've got authority as a son
[1:17:09] of god authority as a daughter of god
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:15] are you hearing me
[1:17:19] they hadn't even crossed the jordan yet
[1:17:21] i hope somebody's hearing me they hadn't
[1:17:24] even crossed the jordan yet but when
[1:17:26] they took the word
[1:17:31] not their ideas but the word
[1:17:36] i don't have time to read it tonight
[1:17:38] but out of isaiah 55
[1:17:41] let
[1:17:43] let the sinner in the ungodly forsake
[1:17:45] his way
[1:17:47] forsake his thoughts
[1:17:50] for my thoughts god said
[1:17:53] are higher
[1:17:54] than your thoughts
[1:17:57] he talked about how his telephones they
[1:17:59] descend down
[1:18:02] and what they do in his thoughts as they
[1:18:03] descend down let's just read it here i i
[1:18:07] sometimes i don't like to just comb over
[1:18:09] things here let's just read it here just
[1:18:11] for a moment you may have to pull it up
[1:18:13] because i don't i have this rolled out
[1:18:15] but notice
[1:18:16] as the rain come at verse 10 is the rain
[1:18:18] coming down and the snow from heaven and
[1:18:20] returning not through there but the
[1:18:22] water but watereth the earth and maketh
[1:18:24] it bring forth and bud that it may give
[1:18:27] seed to the sower and bread to the eater
[1:18:29] what does this god's thoughts coming
[1:18:32] down
[1:18:34] are you hearing me now this is why
[1:18:36] wrapping yourself up in the word of god
[1:18:42] let me just say this for anybody even
[1:18:43] listening anybody here tonight don't
[1:18:46] wait till well brother samuel when i get
[1:18:48] a real experience
[1:18:49] you can't get a real experience outside
[1:18:51] of the word
[1:18:52] you've got to take the word first
[1:18:56] they asked peter on the day of pentecost
[1:18:58] what must we do he said repent and be
[1:19:02] baptized and you shall receive the gift
[1:19:04] of the holy ghost what was that that was
[1:19:07] the guide of the word himself behind
[1:19:11] that fisherman's life that was guiding
[1:19:14] them into eternal life
[1:19:16] they wanted to know what do we need to
[1:19:19] do and now that prescription is revealed
[1:19:22] by the guide himself
[1:19:25] so think of it taking letting the word
[1:19:28] come down
[1:19:29] and soak into our lives
[1:19:37] i'll tell you this right here there's
[1:19:38] nobody in here
[1:19:39] or on the internet that'll hear this
[1:19:41] message
[1:19:42] that can say that after you just allowed
[1:19:44] that to happen just letting the thoughts
[1:19:45] of god just letting the message just
[1:19:47] letting the word of god just soak into
[1:19:49] your life
[1:19:51] that i have a bad day no
[1:19:53] it might be troubles come your way but
[1:19:54] you've got strength
[1:19:57] see what's what's soaking into our life
[1:19:59] look at it
[1:20:01] bread bread don't come up like that
[1:20:04] unless it's in a hot house or
[1:20:06] manufacture it
[1:20:07] right you got to plant the seed it's got
[1:20:09] to be the rain that comes down right
[1:20:12] it's got a nourish release that seed the
[1:20:14] germ that's in there it's got to grow
[1:20:16] through all the stages but then it
[1:20:18] becomes bread
[1:20:20] right
[1:20:21] but how does all that come it's the
[1:20:23] thoughts of god coming down
[1:20:27] oh glory be to god
[1:20:29] so shall my word be that goethe forth
[1:20:31] out of my mouth it shall not return unto
[1:20:33] me void but it shall accomplish that
[1:20:36] which i please and it shall prosper
[1:20:38] in the thing where unto i sent it
[1:20:42] my goodness we could preach all over the
[1:20:43] bible with that
[1:20:47] but i say god let us be so
[1:20:49] wrapped up
[1:20:51] with the word of god
[1:20:53] with your thoughts
[1:20:56] let me just get wrapped up let them let
[1:20:57] them saturate like they they talk about
[1:20:59] how the the snow you know we we see when
[1:21:02] they come to doing winter wheat well
[1:21:04] winter wheat depends on snow
[1:21:08] when we live down there in the country i
[1:21:09] don't know i guess they must do it
[1:21:10] around here too but it depends on the
[1:21:12] blanket of snow keeping that seed a
[1:21:14] little warm and then it just sat that
[1:21:16] melts and goes right in the ground
[1:21:19] so then they're able to harvest that
[1:21:21] what is at the end of spring and
[1:21:22] beginning of summer they're able to
[1:21:24] bring that wheat in it's called winter
[1:21:26] wheat
[1:21:29] think of this here's a living god
[1:21:32] making himself known
[1:21:35] god was letting his people know i'm
[1:21:37] closing here
[1:21:39] i know you think i believe it when i see
[1:21:41] it but yeah i'm closing
[1:21:47] this one this right here god
[1:21:49] was doing this
[1:21:52] for his people
[1:21:56] bringing them
[1:21:58] see how everything is so orchestrated
[1:22:00] like brother jerry was preaching last
[1:22:02] thursday night the plan and purpose of
[1:22:03] god
[1:22:04] how do you try to
[1:22:07] who can bring all these things together
[1:22:10] who
[1:22:12] man you can't
[1:22:15] god's proving
[1:22:17] his faithfulness his might and at the
[1:22:20] same time in this situation
[1:22:22] he's also letting them know
[1:22:24] when you get before giants
[1:22:27] you get before obstacles think back to
[1:22:30] this
[1:22:31] the same god that was a waymaker here be
[1:22:33] the same god to be a waymaker when it
[1:22:35] comes to your need
[1:22:38] what was god saying i'm your waymaker
[1:22:41] i'm the one who makes the way
[1:22:43] i make a way from my word to be
[1:22:45] fulfilled all you got to do is put my
[1:22:47] word first and i will come and perform
[1:22:50] it
[1:22:55] notice what it experienced that would be
[1:22:58] because god was letting them know
[1:23:00] there's going to be battles you're going
[1:23:02] to be engaged in
[1:23:03] that you're going to have to stand still
[1:23:07] you're letting them know brother aaron
[1:23:08] they're going to be battles that you're
[1:23:10] going to have to walk clear up to it
[1:23:12] the souls of the feet touch the brim of
[1:23:14] the water
[1:23:16] but the braham said it i've quoted it a
[1:23:18] number of times brother braham said they
[1:23:20] walked about 20 feet in the water and
[1:23:21] all of a sudden
[1:23:24] the whole point being this
[1:23:26] they had to take the word
[1:23:28] and the situation had to obey the word
[1:23:32] because the word was being obeyed from
[1:23:35] the heart
[1:23:37] it's power in obedience that's why
[1:23:40] when saul was coming back and samuel met
[1:23:43] him and said obedience is better than
[1:23:46] sacrifice
[1:23:53] sometimes we're going to have to stand
[1:23:54] still
[1:23:56] this right here represented there's
[1:23:58] going to be times where you're going to
[1:24:00] have to just pray and trust me and stand
[1:24:03] still
[1:24:07] and that the way will open up after
[1:24:09] you're standing in obedience
[1:24:11] to my will
[1:24:13] think of it my goodness think of this
[1:24:16] word after
[1:24:18] somebody look at your neighbor and say
[1:24:19] after
[1:24:22] after
[1:24:25] paul wrote it like this
[1:24:27] for ye have need of patience that after
[1:24:31] you have done the will of god
[1:24:33] you might receive the promise when
[1:24:35] after
[1:24:37] after you've done god's will be patient
[1:24:41] the promise is on its way
[1:24:45] first peter 5 10 but the god of all
[1:24:48] grace who called us unto his glory by
[1:24:50] christ jesus after
[1:24:52] that you have suffered a while make you
[1:24:54] perfect establish strength and settle
[1:24:56] you
[1:24:57] when
[1:24:58] after
[1:25:03] noah
[1:25:04] would never have seen any rainbow
[1:25:08] until after
[1:25:10] the flood
[1:25:16] but the jury got the preaching on the
[1:25:18] hebrews children last week
[1:25:20] powerful statement came flowing from the
[1:25:22] holy ghost on that one
[1:25:24] brother brown makes it right here
[1:25:26] but it was just a powerful statement
[1:25:29] that at their trial they didn't see this
[1:25:32] coming
[1:25:34] but it wasn't until after they were in
[1:25:37] the fiery furnace
[1:25:40] that the son of god made himself known
[1:25:44] think about it what was the greatest
[1:25:45] trial the greatest test in their life
[1:25:48] brought the greatest experience
[1:25:56] i got to repeat it as it was said last
[1:25:58] week because it was just good good good
[1:26:01] their purpose in the fire
[1:26:04] was to reveal the fourth man
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:10] whew that's one of them i just take put
[1:26:12] in the pocket putting the script back
[1:26:14] but we can preach the ministry of the
[1:26:16] son of man on that one
[1:26:18] oh my the purpose and the hour we're
[1:26:20] living in in the midst of everything
[1:26:23] that's going on is to reveal the son of
[1:26:26] man
[1:26:29] the testing trials have not come to
[1:26:31] overwhelm you listen even your failures
[1:26:34] are not there and do not dictate who you
[1:26:37] are
[1:26:39] i can't get into that
[1:26:41] but what dictates who you are is the
[1:26:44] word of god is the holy ghost in your
[1:26:46] life
[1:26:48] mistakes don't define you the word
[1:26:50] identifies you
[1:26:55] let's stand
[1:26:56] [Applause]
[1:26:59] after
[1:27:01] after
[1:27:02] they put the word and they took the word
[1:27:04] first and it was after
[1:27:08] daniel it was after
[1:27:09] he was in the lion's den after
[1:27:14] that god
[1:27:15] showed up
[1:27:17] the friends of god moving down
[1:27:20] bringing strength bringing deliverance
[1:27:26] sometimes our standing standing still
[1:27:28] we've
[1:27:29] consulted the lord lord what do i do
[1:27:35] we put the word first remember it's
[1:27:37] always listen friends though
[1:27:39] you don't ever want to get it we don't
[1:27:40] want to be in a hurry
[1:27:45] and i know some of that comes out
[1:27:47] because i'm a pastor
[1:27:48] and i know that characteristics as an ox
[1:27:50] of the team i'm just four feet on the
[1:27:52] ground
[1:27:53] and ox is ox not very fast he's slow
[1:28:00] but that's also
[1:28:01] admonition to our life because our life
[1:28:04] is not growth like this
[1:28:08] come on now
[1:28:09] god brings evangelist into the church
[1:28:12] our faith will soar in the promise of
[1:28:14] god and there's continual growth but
[1:28:17] growth does not come like that
[1:28:21] growth
[1:28:22] comes little
[1:28:24] by little by little and it's all god god
[1:28:27] planting god watering god given the
[1:28:29] ingredients all god
[1:28:32] but within this
[1:28:34] we want to put the word first
[1:28:37] sometimes you know it's easy sometimes
[1:28:40] we can say
[1:28:41] um well i you know i'm putting the word
[1:28:44] first but we want in everything
[1:28:47] we want to evaluate and say god
[1:28:50] is that really what's first situation
[1:28:52] before you decisions because remember
[1:28:54] god made a promise here in his word
[1:28:58] nothing shall stand before you not a man
[1:29:02] all this land every place that your foot
[1:29:05] has trout i've given you
[1:29:07] but that didn't mean that joshua
[1:29:10] could become relaxed
[1:29:14] his authority
[1:29:16] was by the word
[1:29:18] his victory
[1:29:19] was from the word
[1:29:21] that's why those very important
[1:29:23] instructions in verse 7 and verse 8 be
[1:29:25] strong and courageous don't turn from
[1:29:27] the left
[1:29:28] don't turn to the right there's a lot of
[1:29:29] things that can try to pull you off here
[1:29:32] pull you off there
[1:29:34] and remember one of the greatest things
[1:29:37] there's things many times that can pull
[1:29:39] at our heartstrings
[1:29:41] reasoning
[1:29:43] and other things
[1:29:45] and this is where we need the
[1:29:47] discernment of the word
[1:29:50] we want to be sensitive with god because
[1:29:53] we're moving
[1:29:54] god just doesn't
[1:29:57] god just doesn't stay in one spot he's
[1:29:59] moving and we want to be sensitive to
[1:30:01] say lord
[1:30:02] i want to catch
[1:30:04] when you're moving
[1:30:06] when as the word begins to move i want
[1:30:08] to be able to start making that step
[1:30:09] with the word
[1:30:11] because the word maybe right up there
[1:30:13] there's an obstacle
[1:30:15] and god sees it as the watchman
[1:30:18] he makes this direction right here i
[1:30:20] want to be
[1:30:20] moving right in line with the word
[1:30:22] so every time the word moves just say
[1:30:24] god help me to be sensitive just to move
[1:30:26] right with the word
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:28] because within that
[1:30:30] then
[1:30:31] then thou shalt make thy way
[1:30:33] prosperous
[1:30:35] and of a good success
[1:30:38] oh man let's pray father
[1:30:43] lord
[1:30:44] very simple words
[1:30:46] of instruction that you would speak to
[1:30:48] our hearts tonight
[1:30:50] but lord how they are
[1:30:53] lord really
[1:30:56] god words that we find ourselves
[1:31:00] applying and needing to apply over and
[1:31:03] over in our lives
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:07] lord i find in our lives oh god like you
[1:31:09] would remind joshua
[1:31:12] that our victory our authority
[1:31:15] it comes by the word of god
