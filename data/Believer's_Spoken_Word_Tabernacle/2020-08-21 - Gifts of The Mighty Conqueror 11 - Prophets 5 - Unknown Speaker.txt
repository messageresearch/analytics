oh hallelujah let's just go to him in a word of prayer tonight you have a need on your heart just want to make known to the lord line up lifted hand oh lord jesus heavenly father lord as we've come here lord tonight and gathered in lord this little place that you've given us lord that we could come and meet lord your god to preach and to hear your word lord to see you transform our lives and change us lord dear god we thank you for your mercy lord we are witnesses dear god of the redeeming power of almighty god and lord jesus there's needs that's here tonight lord lord i know perhaps sometimes even when a text is read it might seem like lord that that how is my need going to be met but lord we realize lord god that you are the word lord god you're able to take control and so direct lord god that gift that you place in that life to minister lord to our needs lord we've come here tonight because we want to have a meeting with you you're the one that we want to see it's your garment that we want to touch the hymn of lord god and we pray tonight lord that for every one of these needs there's not one of them lord that's beyond your reach you're the almighty god lord so we just lord tonight just take every one of these needs we place him lord upon the altar of god and lord god we call father lord jesus those things that are not as though they are those things that are as though they are not lord we're looking to you who made the promise lord if we were just looking at the promise lord god well lord god we could be a little shaky but when we're looking to the god who made the promise then lord god we can rest upon you that's what your prophet told us he said abraham was not looking so much at the promise as he was to the god who gave it lord we just ask tonight that may you just come among us in a real special way those that are gathered around lord in their homes and streaming lord many of the different needs father lord we're looking to you lord day by day in our lives lord you're our protection lord we ask that you would just god and direct us lord by your holy spirit now lord in your word we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you tonight so good to be back in the house of the lord amen um i want to if we could let's just let's go right into the scripture here into first samuel chapter 3 verse 1. and while you're turning there just to remember as we've been looking at here with that on prophets gifts from the mighty conqueror and looking at that from the new testament where god would make clear the apostle paul he has given some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and some teachers and we read here in the scripture in first samuel 3 1. and remember as we're reading this that the word prophet itself it just it it deals with preaching and and under divine inspiration but the difference is is how that god has placed it that truly every prophet or every preacher would be a prophet but to see that when god has ordained that there are major prophets that are to come and they're just not preachers they have the word of the lord for that generation and so we recognize that within that that god would make clear even in this hour that our prophet himself is not just a preacher but it is as the old testament would also say a seer and it would be one who would be given the word of the lord to to interpret that word it's not the man's interpretation it's god's interpretation you might look at it and i don't mean to keep you standing but you might look at it and the thought could say well we have the bible that's the word of the lord that's true israel had the bible they had the written word but what happened they got off track because they didn't have the word of the lord you see it's something that lifts us beyond the interpretation of man and brings us back into contact with god that's why god sends a prophet first samuel chapter three verse one and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious that means it was valued it was prized because of such a rarity when something is something is rare it's precious right it has a great great valuable price on it and look at this it was precious in those days there was no open vision well what's a hope and vision it's when god's word is revealed and god reveals his word to his prophets and when god reveals that word to his prophets there is a people in whom that word is intended for there's a people who's going to receive that word amen god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated tonight i want to just continue with that on how the word of the lord is coming to that of a prophet and we i don't want to review so much even from last week and just trusting whether you were here or not that you're staying in continuity with the services and how that we've been looking at them and how that god even in in this time god would send a prophet according to his word and it would restore us back into back to the word of the lord and we see in genesis 15 1 it says after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying notice the word of the lord comes in a vision fear not abram i am thy shield and i exceeding great reward so when god reveals his word remember when the lord jesus was walking here upon earth and here it was the life of the lord jesus was and not only come for redemption god came down and so condescended to understand us but it was also a divine expression of what was lost in the first adam the second adam was coming to restore so redemption is to bring back and it is to restore to what has been fallen from wherein that as brother brown would make it so clear and use these words it is that word image that they fell from which is the image of the living god dwelling behind the image of man so how that the word of the lord would come to abraham by a vision and the scripture goes on to say in first samuel 3 19 and samuel grew and the lord was with him and didn't let none of his words fall to the ground now think of it eli was the priest in that hour but the word didn't come to the priest they had got off the mark and israel was going and going but yet the word of the lord god's mercy god sends a prophet remember a prophet is not only a sign of judgment but the prophet also within that there is a people who find the mercy of almighty god their hearts are touched and are moved in repentance to come back in line with god's word as a matter of fact there is a longing within the heart of the believer to be lined up with the word it's something that the believer can't even explain or even be able to put into words it's something that they can't find ground to stand on but yet maybe they're walking in a church and they're you know thankful for the salvation of the lord but there's a longing in their heart for something more what that is that's a deep that's calling to the deep there's a desire for that seed that god placed on the inside for that to come into expression and there's only one that can bring that into expression and that's the very god himself in whom that seed is from so to find that the word of the lord it will not come to eli but it would come to samuel god had built and prepared samuel to receive the word of the lord and the bible said that he did not let any of his words fall to the ground and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord now here's the thing they knew that that yet that of the world came among israel and they began to look after other things they wanted a king like the rest of the nations yet they knew you see this is why just knowing that it's the prophet of the lord is not enough it's to where that word is so moved in that heart that it turns the heart to a place that there's no other attraction of the world that holds any interest or any value it's where jesus christ has become the center of that life he becomes the all in all to that life just simply put he everything else you sell out because of jesus christ and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in china by the word of the lord so how does he reveal himself to his prophets by the word of the lord this is not just this is not just some oh i received a visitation you know of of of the spirit of god and this is what he said to me does it dovetail with the word i don't care how inspired it seems how anointed it seems i don't care how it might make your hair stand up on the back of your neck does it dovetail with or hair if it doesn't dovetail with the word it's a lying spirit amen that's where look 400 were anointed standing there before jehoshaphat and ahab 400. the spirit of the if we look at it brother the anointing was thick there that day amen come on now the anointing was fit but here stands one micah he's not popular but he has the word of the lord what he has seen god has let him know and it ties right in with that word that god gave to elijah that announced the oncoming judgment on the house of ahab it dovetails with the word amen so here we find this how that the word of the lord how it comes to the prophet and this is where we were i believe coming to here in the latter time and i just felt led to come back to this point and move forward here tonight because in the time a member of the judges the bible said every man walked or did whatever was right in his own eyes you know god doesn't want nobody just walking in according to whatever's right in their own eyes now they did not they have the law they had the law did not they have the writings of the prophets they did did not they have the songs there wasn't there other things that maybe we could say well they didn't have the songs at that time but you understand did not they have the that of even the writings and different things they did but what they what they were going about was according to their own thinking you know one of the biggest things that sometimes that you hear so much among people and they want to take this and cover their sin and say god understands let me just tell you something that's a lie from the devil he said that in the garden of eden at the very beginning oh god won't do this god won't do this god is a god of judgment he said what he meant and he meant what he said [Applause] if he does not stand on his word to bring judgment how can you accept his word of grace because grace itself is not blinded eyes but grace comes with transforming power to lift you from a condition that you're in into what god is calling you do that's grace [Music] hallelujah but we see that how god's mercy this is god's mercy samuel being sent to them when every man was walking what was right in his own eyes it now moves from a place to where calling them back to the word of the lord and you know what that brings it brings a walk of faith you can't walk by faith unless it's divinely revealed and when it's divinely revealed it's more than what you can explain but it's something that anchors within you you are anchored to it it doesn't mean it doesn't matter if you can explain it or not it's what faith is and it pulsates in your life yes amen amen i heard brother branham say here the here today unveiling of god how did those disciples he said it was faith that was anchored in the heart he said faith is that which even you can't explain but it's so anchored in your heart let me tell you it declares itself notice what jesus would say in john 10 34 he said is it not written in your law that i said you're god's if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say he of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemous because i said i am the son of god you know what the lord jesus is letting him know you talk about prophets but you don't know what prophets are yeah you don't even recognize what they are prophets you call whom the word says whom the word comes to these are sons of god right these are gods meaning they had the word of god it wasn't their word it's god's word and god's word is a creative word god's word is a word of dominion and power and authority and glory amen this is what jesus is declaring you call them gods you see what it was they knew the history but they did not know the god they knew the history knew all about him he went here he did this moses did this moses did that they knew all the pathway of the history of moses but they didn't know the god of moses that's right are you hearing me you see he says if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though you believe me not believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him he's letting them see beyond the veil because you could look at the outside valve look at these people these are the pharisees were individuals that was all about the outside preach somebody sometimes we made the token all about the outside i believe when you've got the token it'll make your dress right it'll make you want to live right it'll clean you up from the inside out come on now but sometimes we got all this on the outside and say my i see this and see that yep they got the token and yet it is not truly applying it in the right way jesus is letting it be known that on whom the word of god come to did any of these prophets ask oh god send the word to me let me be a prophet they didn't want to be a prophet they did not desire that let me just bring it on down as god is bringing a parallel here it was not you and i who was desiring god there was a call on the inside brother it was not you and i calling for the word but the word was calling to the word that was inside of your eye god knew when he said a word in this generation there would be a place that that word would find a resting place yes sir it was a call that was going out it's like they put a tag on one or sometimes they put a tag on those animals they want to trace their whereabouts let me just tell you something you had a seed in you you were a seed of god god never lost sight of you he knew exactly where you are you might have staggered from here staggered from there you might have been heaped up in all kinds of mess but he never lost sight of you amen hallelujah he knew exactly where you were and just like they have those arms that go out and they say oh it's walking up there on the mountain you can't even see it but there is that little ray or invisible wave that goes out and detects there's that mountain lion over there where oh you can't see it it's up there on the mountain walking just as god has sent a word and god sends that word and it detects there is seed in this generation even when you can't even believe that your seed and god would want anything to do with you but the overcoming power of this word brother it defeats it overthrows it casts out what is it it's perfect love god's word is at work to recover to recover when the word is revealed notice whom the word of the lord comes to it said you called them gods they spoke they spoke the word of god and i just think like god it's not going to rain till i call for it who gave him the authority to speak like that god did what gave him the authority the word came to him i have done this at thy word when god drops his word in your heart speak it are you with me speak it you claim it because god is giving that word to be spoken in that hour listen it's not to you to bring it to pass if god gave the way god will bring it to pass [Applause] what takes place in that life then as jesus is letting it be known the works the words begin to come out of that life oh i'm not talking about fruit baskets and serving in soup kitchens and all those other things that might be a wonderful thing to be neighborly but if that's what a soul is resting on that's religion salvation is a birth jesus never said you must serve in the soup kitchen he said you must be born again hallelujah so now here the revelation you see when it when the word is revealed it shows itself that that the word will act itself out through that life and that's what god did through the prophets and god did that through those who heard them now let's turn to ezekiel chapter 2 and let's look at this in ezekiel 1 or if you want to follow on the screen there that's fine and here is ezekiel remember ezekiel is a prophet that is that is going to prophesy during the time when they are in captivity in babylon they've already remembered jeremiah was prophesying beforehand isaiah was but now that they're in captivity look at the mercy of god god is wanting to keep before them this is what got you in here this is why you're here but he also puts before them time and time again the promise that god said i will restore him glory be to god you see the word has a way of letting us know where we are and where we need to be amen that's a real overcoming word that lets us know amen to connect the points you know anybody ever called you you know brother joey or somebody you know somebody would call you say i'm lost for what's the first thing you say where are you at but if on the other end of that phone they say i don't know we got problems right that's evident they're lost but you at least want to say okay now what's a clear landmark what what what's a sign what have you passed and what have you you started looking for things that hopefully will trigger in your mind where they're at and they're calling you because they know you're in the vicinity but somehow they got off track right right right that is the mercy of god for our lives spiritually hallelujah i know you're in the vicinity but god's grace is to let you know the pathway home ezekiel 2 verse 1 and he said unto me son of man this is prophet this is where you see when son of man it refers to prophet stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet then i heard him that spake unto me notice the spirit entered when he spake jesus said my words are spirit and life the bible said in cornelius house why peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell amen we find where paul will lay hands on him and the holy ghost come here's the thing the holy ghost comes according to the word amen he will always come to the word amen you're going to receive it whether you don't have to be standing here you're gonna be sitting right there you can be right at your house you can be right at your home you see the promise is certain because god gave the promise oh now i love that my we could just spend time on that part of it but let's go on and he sat unto me verse three son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me my my my what love hello somebody somebody rebelled against you know me or you let's just be honest our flesh would not be wanting to go to him well thank goodness brother jerry was here and preached that feeling on gopo come on somebody oh my he said son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day for they are impudent children and stiff-hearted i do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for their rebellious house yet shall they know that there hath been a prophet among them amen now remember later on i believe it's ezekiel 33. they treated ezekiel like a lovely song right son of man towered a lovely song it was it was it was no deeper than any motion to them but there were some people that it went beyond the emotion it moved into their heart it got upon some solid ground it moved down into their light now notice whether they received it or not god let it be known they're going to know a prophet was among them amen i tell you brother and sister when you read it like this you to thank god for his mercy if your heart listen to me if your heart is stirred and that revelation has struck your heart because a prophet can't give that to you that they have the word of the lord if your heart's been touched like that say god let my life be so filled with that word so in tune with that word lord let it find a resting place inside of me amen just don't stop to know it's the truth know that it's god declaring this is what i have ordained you to be that my word might dwell in you notice in verse 6 and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house it's not going to be comfortable but remember the same god that's given him the word is the same god that's coming in him amen amen amen it's it's not god the god who asks you to stand is the same god who comes in you and stands inside of you and it causes you to stand upon the word thou shalt speak notice thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear whether they will forbear for their most rebellious but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like the rest like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that i give thee and when i looked and behold and hand was sent unto me oh glory aren't you glad a hand's been sent unto you amen do you know what it what the hand does the hand in there it represents the right hand it represents his power elisha was all cast down but when the minstrel began to play the hand of the lord came upon him for ezekiel it was the hand of the lord that would come upon him and pack him from place to place it was the spirit of god through peter that would call you and i let us humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god that he might exalt thee in due time amen oh blessed be the name of the lord his hand came unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein the power of god amen brought a book to him glory be to god he spread it before me notice he brought it rolled up are you with me the hand brought it rolled out but then that same hand opened it before him hallelujah how's he gonna oh my my how's he gonna eat it if it's closed it's gotta be an open book in order for him to eat it don't you see it was more than just having a scroll open it's got to be god open the vision of the word what good would it do to open the word if there's no eyes on the earth to catch that vision and to bring that vision to the people of god [Applause] is god's channel god's pathway oh glory and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe ezekiel 3 1 he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this rule and go speak unto the house of israel eat it then go speak it right if you don't need it you can't speak it right you're running without a message you might know the message but if you don't eat it you're running without a message the messages get under the blood the message is the token the message is christ in you the hope of glory glory be to god because your oh my you see when that book becomes open what's actually happening you're looking in and the mystery of your life is being unfolded do you understand because the word of god is coming to you amen it's not something that you have to brian like a crowbar and try to pry into it no it is god himself coming and god unfolding the word and revealing the word to you listen to me that is the mercy of god and that is to let you know who you are the rest of the people it will go on by them but god will come and you can read the same faith that everybody else reads and it just opens to you you can't explain it what is it it's god revealing the pathway of sonship back home he's revealing to you who you really are for the word of the lord comes to you amen thank you praise the lord hallelujah so i opened my mouth and he calls me to eat that roll he's a prophet he's eating the word right and he said unto me son of man cause that belly to eat and fill thy bowels i enter most parts with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness but remember cause your belly to eat it in the mouth it's sweet but when it gets down here and it starts breaking down has to digest where now it has to come and to bring that life in subjection it says cause thy belly to eat it how many say lord oh and that word as it's coming and we're eating in that word how sweet it is but to say god let me so die to myself that this word that is my joy i know in this word is power in this word is victory lord in this word is character molding and shaping power oh god shape my life so that the very character of my life will match that of the word oh my and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them isn't that just like god when the word comes god goes and visits his kin folk hey when rahab came she wanted to go tell her family is that right when the world was coming to a climax of the end abraham was interceding for a lot amen is that right god puts that burden and that desire there within that life notice for thou are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language but to the house of israel not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language whose words thou canst not understand surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkened unto thee there one time it's not time for it to go to the gentiles god was letting ezekiel know if i sent you unto a people of a hard language to understand in other words your tongues it's not the same tongue they would receive it why wouldn't israel receive it rebellious why why how could they become rebellious how can god classify them as rebellious because they knew what was right and they refused to do it let me tell you something every time you put off what you know you ought to do your heart grows harder [Music] [Applause] listen there's nothing that god can't break but i'm just telling you right now every time you put it off and say there'll be another time or i can't do this or i can't do that you're exactly right you can't do a thing but god is greater than all of your strengths [Applause] in weakness he is mighty oh god i don't want to be i don't want to be a rebellious house i want to be sensitive when he's dealing with my heart amen praise god but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me notice they're not going to receive you as my prophet because they don't receive me for all the house of israel are impotent and hard-hearted oh my look at this but i have made thee thy face strong against their faces lotus i have made thy person strong against thy persons these are some pretty strong people remember he just talked about them here that they're like scorpions maybe you've never done it but i preach where people have had critical spirits not out there right here where it's come from right out of the pews and i had to just overlook it and say god be merciful it's a dangerous thing but you recognize it's a dangerous thing to set and notice here it was the word was going forth but notice what god told him you speak the word that i give you how could a man stand there in the face of all of that and deliver that word it's because the god who gave the word came down and stepped inside of that man and spake that word and gave that man strength through the prevailing power of that revelation of the word don't you see brother and sister when you and i go out on the job or wherever we go this word this relationship with god this anchor in our heart this message that god has placed so deep in our life it ain't separate it ain't something we leave in the house and go out to the job it's not something we leave on the shelf and bake our biscuits it is that which every part of our life it gives us strength it gives us courage it gives us an expectation it helps us to face day by day because we know who we are we know where we've come from and we know where we're going i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheads as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead oh the seal of the living god is a powerful thing in it amen having the mind of christ the seal in their foreheads amen it's a powerful seal amen to know in whom you have believed to know that we belong to him and fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i speak unto thee receive into thine heart and hear with thy words and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord god whether they will hear or whether they will forebear then the spirit took me up amen and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from this place from his place you see here is god revealing his word to his prophet amen here ezekiel has went beyond just the writings just a letter if we can say it like this he went and entered into the veil into the presence of god he has become one with the word that is to be delivered and given out to the people of god and notice from this place blessed be the glory of the lord from his place the spirit took me up oh my god the word of god that had come to the prophet the same spirit of god that delivered the word that entered into the prophet that same spirit took him from that place to where he was supposed to go he was supposed to carry that word there unto the children of captivity let me preach now that same god that has revealed his word by his spirit and placed it inside of your life let me tell you the sons of god are led by the spirit of almighty god amen it is the spirit of god that is packing you that is carrying you that has equipped you that is guiding you that your footsteps are ordered as possessions [Applause] hallelujah you say what are you saying i'm talking about people who are walking with an authority [Music] oh my mama i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and the noise of a great rushing god's letting him know you stand for me i got your back hallelujah amen we're under that anointing of the word so the spirit lifted me up took me away and i went in bitterness and in the heat of my spirit you say a bitterness and the heat of my spirit he's got to deliver a word to a rebellious house that has continually hardened their heart he can't go and pat him on the back well you know you all were pretty good but you know that no no he's got to tear it on he's got to bring it on down as god has given him the word and let him know this is where this is what you should be but you're not right but god's made a promise see this word was getting them ready to get back into the land you see we we we we they were put out of eden but god sent a word amen that brings us back spiritually and prepares us to come back in the millennium it prepares us for that land that in my father's house are many mansions it prepares us for the millennium it prepares us for the future home amen so the prophets you know they they lived so much that brother brown would put it they lived so much in the presence of god and that he says until they would become one with the word and then the message is the word itself i know i know many of these quotes are familiar to you but don't just let them be familiar quotes they lived so much in that in that word till their message it was the word itself and remember he said thus saith the lord when those men had those messages from god they become so wrapped up that their own thinking it might have been against their thinking they may not have been able to see it right but they were speaking the word of god thus saith the lord amen hallelujah that's why once a person says well i don't need the message i'll just take what the bible says you won't know what the bible says without the message you've got to have the interpretation given by the spirit of god upon the word of god come on friends because if you're just going to take as it says by letter it's said to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and peter said to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you need more than just written letters you need the author of the word to come down and interpret that word [Applause] i really don't care what people think i always like how brother harold hildebrand always put it he'd read a scripture he said now i'm going to read the amplified version and read a quote [Laughter] you know brother harold hildebrand brother dave you probably remember brother harold oh my brother brother will you know he's a great herald of the message there he really brought that message right there into africa amen among i remember when brother samson and man they they said man when when brother harold come it you know it came to a place it wasn't just about god sent a prophet anymore he said it came to a place he said now the mysteries begin to come open and begin to understand the things that god has sent in his word it's not uplifting a man but i'll tell you what thank god that there was a man that was yielded to god and he would go there and listen it was the same fire that god had put there in the heart of brother harold that caught fire there among them in ghana in other places what was it it was the same fire that came to the prophet and opened the world in this hour and interpreted that same pillar of fire has found its place and a bold and sons and daughters of god we're not just speakers of the word we are written epistles of this very word [Applause] you know what a written epistle is have you ever seen seed packets only two of you seen seed packets okay more of you seen them now little seed packet like this and it will say on that seed packet that these green beans or blue runners or whatever they are brother dave will know all the terminology on it but whatever they are on those seed packets when you read that there is a picture on the front of it of what that bean will look like when it's coming to manifestation in its season you don't take a picture of the uh of the bean when it's in its infancy and put it on the picture because not many people would buy it but you want to show the power that's in that seed come on somebody so you see when we're looking at this inside of that you see a picture but when you turn it over there's writing on the back of the packet and the writing on the back of the packet it tells you what zones they grow in it tells you what to be expected at this time and what to be expected at this time the reality is that the seeds that are in that packet if you can just keep watering them and the sunlight you put them in good soil they will come forth and let me tell you something god in this hour and each time he sends a message in full maturity and full power why it takes the full maturity and the full power to release what's on the inside man i feel good i ain't having church all by myself i know i've got somebody y'all with me hallelujah so you see it's that coming to maturity that's there on the inside notice brother brown would say like this in trying to do god a service notice he said god told the prophet eat the scroll in the old testament we just read that the prophet of the new testament he said eat the little book that's to you and me eat the little book become one revelations 10 8-11 eat the little book you know it didn't say he descended with a big book he descended with a little book this message reveals the lamb's book of life it reveals those names that are there on the latin's book of life that's why you look and say why don't it settle with others why don't you give them that excitement why doesn't they get them them hope because in his word that is sent to sons and daughters of god it is the inspiration of the holy ghost upon the word to inspire the sons and daughters of god in this hour remember before ezekiel could ever go start speaking it he had to eat it amen they had to become one with it they became one within in the upper room the jesus they walked with the one who was veiled behind humanity that let them know i'm the same god now that same god had come inside of them and the word they had received it was now the acts of the holy spirit through their lives notice he says why why why did he say to do that that the prophet and the word would be one that's the ark the word of god see the word that is expressed is also being expressed from this voice not just this voice this voice it's the voice of your life not just the voice of our mouth but the voice of our life this may not get a chance to get open and proclaim it but this can proclaim it our life can stand in a place brother and when people say ha ha this guy is a whole this guy's a holy roller well i think you know as my aunt linda was you know after god really had got a hold of her life and and did such a work and revealed this word she got called quaker woman and everything else you want to make it fun but you know what happens the seal of god you know what it does it calls it to be adamant in the forehead harder than flint you're able to stand there why because there is a strength that's behind you you are standing there identified with him and you're not ashamed of it it's glorious to be identified with him oh you've lost your mind where where's your fun at oh my i've got more fun now than i ever had i don't get headaches from it and this from it and that from it man i i have joy sometimes i have a hard time sleeping but i have joy hallelujah this is what jesus said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you remember when moses came forth he came forth veiled let me just come down here when moses came from out of that pillar of fire god had called him into there and moses had the word of god for the people this is a prophet of god notice a prophet of god is not carrying or speaking his own words it doesn't mean that the man still doesn't have his own thoughts but the thoughts of god that come they override his thoughts john identified according to the promise when he would see the spirit of god whom thou see the spirit of god descended this is he john went right forth and announced it but then john got down there in prison and he got his eagle eye filmed over what was spoken out of john's mouth was right on but john's thinking about it was something that god had to come and help his prophet hallelujah are you with me because it wasn't happening according to how he thought it would how he thought it should but what did jesus said stay around and when you witness what is taking place then go tell him what you see well what were they to tell him it was to announce this is the messiah let me tell you you and i have found our place there many times but how that gone and it's not just about oh you know in your walk as a believer but sometimes you might feel oh as a housewife or oh as a as a you know as a daughter of god or as a son of god or i'm not that much or i'm not that good i'm not and god has to come around and let you see that he's a living god and what he has done in your life and the same god that has placed the attributes within you to do what is to be done he's the one who brings them forth amen and you know what it's actually a blessing man just understand me for a moment here it's actually a blessing that you don't think that your face belongs on the front of good housekeeping because if you thought your face belonged on the on the front of good housekeeping god couldn't work through you god can't work through pride no it's true right you understand me pride is a sinful thing the holy spirit had brother jerry deal with that on that sunday morning that whole way through because a lot of times people are looking for sin and all this and this and that pride is a nasty ugly thing yes it is people can have everything down to the hill and yet they have so much pride god can't operate where there's pride but you know where god can operate where there's lives that can just say lord wrap your presence in me lord as a believer i need you i need you to walk inside of me lord i need you to manifest my life as a believer lord i need you lord god is the housewife lord i don't have it all together i might know this and know that but lord help me has a husband on their job and different things around the house if you think you've got it all together then he can't work you might say god would be so mindful and he would care about little things like that god cares about little things god cares about things that he's able to tell you and let you see his divine care over little things because why if we can see it over little things then we know that he's got the big things we're so all the time looking for bigger things and god himself is making himself known by little things but when you get little a lot of little things struck together you're getting a good fire ready for some hot dogs and s'mores and the rest because you really can't cook any meat over top of a little twig i'm not way off base i'm right on track still many times we'll go and you know zachary wants a fire dad let's build a fire tonight dad let's build a fire tonight so about that time you know he'll come out there and we get you know maybe like a little twig he runs in the house he's going to get a piece of paper light that paper up and before i look around on the skewer he's got this marshmallow i said son that paper does not have the heat that's needed to let that marshmallow go on your chocolate in your graham cracker but this piece of paper will help the twig and the twig will help the next twig and the next twig and the next twig with eventually let's get this log caught on fire because once there gets enough heat then the big things start burning amen you see it's in the little things that many times where israel was looking back they would get off track they wanted the great god they wanted the mighty god but remember the mighty god is brought on the scene by simple obedience amen it's the little things and you see a prophet why he's so overlooked is because it looks like why does god care about this why does god care about how i dress why does god care about that why does god care about you know how i look why does god care about this why does god care whether or not you know my life is cleaned up and free because he cares because god's desire is to come and to live his life inside of you and through you to where just as much when a prophet has come that people would know there's been a prophet whether they receive it or not and when you go on the workplace when you're among your family when you're in europe when you're in your community that they would know a christian lives here a believer lives here we don't know where to place them at because they don't say their methodist or pentecost store or we don't know where to place them but there's one thing about it they're a christian and that's what we want we want that word we want to be so one with that word that that word would reflect itself out through our life i'm talking about in such a place to where a person can look at your life now you may not have all the words because sometimes a person thinks they've got to be able to string together all the words and my i've got to be able to put together all the scriptures and all the quotes no you don't have to be able to do that all we have to be able to do is let jesus be first place because after all that he's the one that they're going to be attracted to not if we're able to put it together just right or we're able to do this that that's not it we want them to be attracted to him and when they get attracted to him then god will give us the words and say repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ don't worry all that'll come right in its place and in its season oh my well i hope i hope it's made sense tonight in some way a little bit more clear when this when we look at what a prophet is a seer he's one who is one with the word god would give his his bible his bible that you and i would have and people could pack think about how many people had packed the bible around but god would in this hour according to his word it was the mercy of god before judgment that he would open his word and begin to reveal the interpretation of that word oh my god i'll tell you we ought to be the happiest people and yet at the same time about being the happiest it makes you want to cry lord jesus who am i who am i that you would come down and reveal yourself worthy not at all not at all worthy worthy there's a lot more people who are worthy better people esau was a much better man than jacob [Music] but jacob was god's choice clear back from his mind what was that choice about of how jacob would respond and he would have a desire for the birthright think about this think about it for a moment when he could have in his mind are you listening to me he can have in his mind well there ain't no chance for me to get it it belongs to esau esau is the firstborn there was something in him even in his unconverted state there was something in him that he longed for that birthright what was that it was the seed of god on the inside reason he couldn't kill it reasoning couldn't stifle it why there's a germ of life on the inside [Applause] and when jacob came there to battle that night brother there was that time i'm talking about on his way to bada to to down around when he was on that way there he met god it didn't change him but he knew that the god that he was longing for that god was alive he was real he wasn't just his daddy's god he was god hallelujah jacob knew watch over me lord and bring me back to this place god knew how to let situations arise to get him back to this place because it was in this place not any other place in this place that god was going to reveal himself to jacob god knows just how look just as he get the israel back into their place just as god would get you and i in our place you might have started your walk in your journey you know in a pentecostal church maybe you started in a catholic church maybe it's in the charismatic church oh brother samuel how could anybody start it there if they believe on jesus christ sure had all sorts of things till about their life but you see it was not the place that god had ordained to reveal himself but it's part of the journey but in that god himself will see to it that that life is brought to that ordained place what place that god himself might reveal himself to you and that you might surrender the tithe of your life amen because after all it's the tithe that's brought into his storehouse are you with me god's a tithe player also he brings the tithe of the earth to himself what's the tithe your soul your life hallelujah and what's the rest of my life an offering amen amen see his tithes and offering even in your life is that right the tithe of your soul belongs to god but the offering is as you read as you pray you give yourself to the lord right right that you would present yourself brethren as a sacrifice god is good in me thank god if the musicians would come brother brian would come i want you to sing that song he didn't have to open my eyes you could have easily passed me by for the age i was living in i was wretched poor and blind does say this is true riches if christ if the lord jesus christ is dwelling in your heart in your life you have true riches and if he's calling to your heart and your life he wants to deposit his life inside of you i say oh god let this word let it reside within my life i want to keep on eating [Music] i tell you to me the message it becomes more precious but is it becoming more precious you know what the bible is open when we're reading the scripture we're reading it under inspiration let me just say this very plainly [Music] and the person says ah i don't need the message i'm just going to read the bible listen to them preach i've heard a few of them sometimes they sent me clips of things not them but others this is what i said [Music] they are preaching that from the past which was the presumptions of man claiming that they want to tear down idolatry but they're preaching the presumptions of man and raising up idols this message has raised up the living god out of history [Music] it has given you and i life it is that which has connected us in the book the bible and our lives are not separate we've been yoked together well jesus could say if you don't believe me believe the works they testify so what are you saying you're going to follow somebody [Music] you're going to follow somebody but i ain't going back to egypt i come out of egypt i've come into the promised land i've found the glory and the power that was promised in the shekinah i found my position i know who i am aren't you glad and let me tell you something it's this word this word as god is unfolding the scriptures it lets you know who you are [Music] it's him it's not a man it's him [Music] oh my let's sing this song if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to [Music] for the age i was living [Music] serpent seed and perfect the preach and the message of grace lord i thank me and i just want to thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done deserved in me thanks for that special night when i saw your glorious life he faced the face with [Music] not even in my wildest dreams did i think i'd see such things as the coming of the lord the rapture mystery i have heard but now i see god in simplicity the spoken word is the original i seed me and i just want to thank you all for letting me what have i done to deserve those glories revealed in me thank you for that when i saw your glorious light to face the face with eternal life he said the house of israel is a rebellious house but there was some believers inside of there and they were going to let go of that identity i'm not going to be identified as a rebellious one you see the word was able to so reach into their heart there was a longing that word as it was going forth while they were in captivity brother joy it was preparing their hearts for the journey back home there was some that looked at it and said my goodness man here we are in this state look what kind of a mess we're in and we're called a rebellious house but the rest of them there's something about it it could touch their heart he said i want to go home i want to go home you know there were some that aligned with the word when jeremiah was there when jeremiah was ministering there was people who aligned with that word they still went into captivity but their hearts were prepared by receiving the word to return now you might not think like that's much how many of you ever read in the psalms where it says and this is a psalm of the sons of korah how many of you ever read that these were these were sons of korah who refused to be identified with what their daddy did in the past they were not going to let their daddy as he stood against the revealed word of the hour that ain't my identity they were one with that word are you with me they overcame the rebellion let me just tell you each and every one of us that first birth was a rebellious birth these two listen this guy on the outside and that spirit that's why we need the holy spirit to bring these outer two realms in subjection because these outer two realms would try to raise up in rebellion but this is why you got to have a greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world what does he do he brings the rebellious in subjection and this is why on the inside there's there's a word and it comes and you can say oh ouch oh me lord jesus help me lord god forgive me lord god let me rise why there's a son and daughter of god on the inside that says i ain't going to be identified with rebellion i'm going to be identified with the word amen that's what a word of the lord does it comes to lift you above rebellion don't you love him aren't you glad that there's a word that comes to lift you out of the identity of just your natural family tree you might have good genes in your background and oh my the hannah's oh my what great people down through the the thing but real oh the brownings what great time oh the bales what great team what great people oh you know but sanchez is what great people let's just be honest [Music] that first tree is a rotten tree come on now but there's only one tree that's good and that's when the tree of life comes inside of you [Applause] you didn't know it you went for a long time you didn't know you were part of that tree of life but then he came who the vine came and revealed you're my branch [Music] you're a branch of mine you ordained to bear my fruit my image you've tried to unite with so many things in life but you were ordained to be united with me [Music] we were meant for one another glory be god it is so wonderful [Music] thank god for the word of the lord and i say thank god tonight if you listen to me if you've got something in your heart that says it rises up in your heart that says i am not i am not going to be identified with rebellion i'm going to be identified with the word of the lord if it takes my heart off i'm going to be identified with the word what's happening the word you're receiving it's causing you to stand up and the spirit is entering in same what god did with ezekiel when god brings the prophet the word that he delivers brother brian it's got to find a resting place it's got to find a resting place and i believe i'm looking at part of that resting place i believe i'm part of it when god said behold i send you right here he sent elijah for me why because i'm a son of god i needed to know how to get back home oh my i better just let's just pray [Music] anybody want to be remembered in prayer tonight [Music] god bless your hands god bless you father you're mindful lord you're merciful we know that in this tower in this time lord we're we're standing even right now on the threshold of time and eternity but dear god like i think of ezekiel he stood there in the midst of that time there were some people that said i am not i am not going to be identified as a rebellious house their heart their heart was being turned to you lord there was some people in there that says lord they were by your grace would humble themselves to that word lord this is what our desire is that you find in our lives [Music] lord god lives in hearts that would humble themselves lord to a place where the word can come and set down on the throne of their heart and lord god for those of us lord god where you've sat down on the throne of our hearts lord by your spirit lord god you've equipped us that we might so humble ourselves that our character might be molded and shaped help us lord by the authority that's given to us oh god that the word would be reflected in our life it's not our pulling it's not our struggling even for one lord that would desire for that word to come and set on the throne of their heart it's not their pulling it's not their struggling the may lord god through the simplicity you spoke tonight it's simple obedience it's the little things lord god it was little things that were overlooked when they were coming back into the land but you would remind us lord god as you would remind zachariah who has to despise the day of small things lord jesus help us lord it's not the big things that spoil the vine it's the little foxes help us lord your prophet would tell us sometimes those little foxes he said are not at heart when you go to eat and you don't even pray over the food it just starts to creep in little foxes little things here there that start to eat away lord jesus forgive us lord god help us lord jesus i pray lord god may we be found lord every hand that's been lifted up to you in prayer oh god may we lord jesus not just let the word be sweet in our mouth as honey but when we cause our belly to eat it lord may we lord fill our bowels with it may it be filled lord every part of our life the innermost tender affections of our life be so filled lord god with your word help us lord may your lord continue to unfold your word to our lives help us lord to walk in the light what light you've shown may we walk in full obedience to it lord for when we walk in with obedience you'll open more light to us lord we love you tonight lord we have good watchovers go with us as we go our separate ways tonight may the holy spirit lord just continue to move dear god throughout the night lord and throughout the days just opening lord your word to our hearts keep us lord i pray tonight lord may god even for hearts that have consecrated themselves the lord oh father that maybe lord god hear tonight they may not sense lord they may not feel they may not even see a change but god may they be filled with an expectation to know lord god that that word that they would receive in their hearts lord and so incline their hearts to you lord god that father you are a god whom still makes house calls you still make house calls lord god and lord jesus you come sovereignly and you change lives lord god oh jesus you give us lord the strength to stand lord god [Music] we love you father in the name of jesus christ amen oh my god i would tell you to shake hands with one another but maybe you can just look at one another and wave and say god bless you god bless you god bless you all you're dismissed in the name of the lord god bless you and god bless you god bless you [Music] god bless you brother brian sister barbara god bless you amen i was on the mountain wandering from the fountain
