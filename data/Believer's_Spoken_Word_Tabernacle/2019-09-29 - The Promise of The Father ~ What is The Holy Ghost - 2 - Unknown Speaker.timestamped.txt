[17:12] had a dilemma this week where my my work
[17:15] card check engine lights start coming on
[17:18] and started missing and stuff and so
[17:20] there's just just been a hectic week
[17:23] trying to figure out okay am I going to
[17:25] get this fixed or get a replacement or
[17:27] or you know what what to do and and it
[17:32] just really had me worn down and God
[17:35] just stepped in and a in a in a special
[17:38] way and ended up you know he just led me
[17:42] to do the right thing you know to to a
[17:45] replacement vehicle and you know it's
[17:50] it's not about you know a car yeah it's
[17:52] going to be dust and ashes someday and
[17:55] totally gone babe you know it's about
[17:58] you know sometimes when you know we're
[18:02] praying about things for maybe years or
[18:05] something and then you know God answers
[18:07] a scene and we can we can see that in
[18:09] other times it's like this where you're
[18:10] kind of blindsided by something and God
[18:14] steps in in a special way and leads and
[18:18] guide you in and you look back and you
[18:21] say wow you know he was with me the
[18:23] whole time even though my mind wasn't
[18:24] even you know honor he was there leading
[18:26] and guiding me the whole time and I just
[18:30] want to give thanks to the Lord for you
[18:32] know and when you just stop and think
[18:34] about it you know here's the King of
[18:36] Kings and the Lord of lords
[18:38] and the you know controls all space and
[18:40] time and matter he took time out of his
[18:44] day to to come and minister to me
[18:48] personally and make sure my needs were
[18:51] met
[18:52] that's just special to meet Saints I
[18:54] just it just says so I've had a song on
[18:59] my heart for last
[19:01] I just been seen at the last few weeks
[19:03] for some reason and I just like to sing
[19:06] a verse of it comes from Psalms 32 where
[19:10] you know King David just imagined him
[19:14] you know when he's pulled away in the
[19:15] wilderness and maybe King saw had him
[19:18] surrounded or something there was a
[19:21] certain inspiration that hit him and but
[19:23] he said singing to the Lord he said you
[19:26] are my hiding place you know and he
[19:29] wasn't dependent on his stealthiness or
[19:31] his abilities to to do anything and and
[19:35] I think it's it falls right in line with
[19:37] you know Psalms 27 at the rapture what
[19:39] we're facing nowadays when the enemy has
[19:41] to surround it but there's a hiding
[19:44] place that we run to and so the songs
[19:49] layout of my abilities to to sing but
[19:53] but it's just on my heart to sing and
[19:58] you are my hiding place you always feel
[20:08] with songs of deliverance whenever I am
[20:15] NOT free I will trust in you I will
[20:22] trust in you let the weak say I am

[41:22] preached a message on the god of the
[41:25] adjutant's he is a deliverer Savior he's
[41:31] a Redeemer amen I'm so thankful for all
[41:35] of that all that he is and you know to
[41:38] think of it if there wasn't needs that
[41:40] arose in our life then he would not be
[41:44] able to manifest in himself in that way
[41:48] but he loves to make himself known to
[41:53] his children they may God will election
[41:57] allow situations to arise like he did
[42:00] when he brought Israel out of Egypt he
[42:05] brought them out and God cared for them
[42:07] all along the way and just even as they
[42:10] cross the Red Sea they come across the
[42:12] Red Sea and they come he leads them to
[42:15] the waters of Marah it would look like
[42:18] why right after such a great victory
[42:20] after a wonderful service and here we
[42:22] are at Marah but God said I'm gonna take
[42:25] this opportunity and I'm gonna show you
[42:27] that I'm your healer let me just tell
[42:33] you it's more than just physical healing
[42:36] in our bodies sometimes we get weary in
[42:39] our spirit and he said I'm just gonna
[42:42] show you that always in the midst of a
[42:45] trial I'm always standing there
[42:49] he showed Moses there's a tree that's
[42:52] there cut that tree down and put it in
[42:54] the water I'll tell you what a privilege
[42:59] we have that no matter what situation it
[43:01] is Jesus Christ is present and when he
[43:05] when we invited him in and say Lord
[43:07] you're here president you're over this
[43:09] that changes and that sweetens the
[43:13] waters of ma
[43:14] I love that don't you when they had need
[43:19] they they they they had need of bread
[43:21] they had need of food but God took an
[43:24] opportunity like that to let them know
[43:26] that I am your provision I'll tell you I
[43:30] could go on my weak we could preach on
[43:32] that for but I just I love the Lord I
[43:35] love the Lord I know you do - I've just
[43:38] to me those are those are things in the
[43:41] word that I just take and I just hug
[43:42] right up next to my bosom amen so we
[43:47] just think God so much for His grace and
[43:49] mercy this morning and we just want to
[43:53] just turn our attention to the word of
[43:55] the Lord
[43:56] so if we could let's go to Romans
[43:59] chapter 4 and we would like to begin
[44:05] reading there on verse 9 in Romans 4
[44:12] and after I kept you all so long last
[44:14] week I'm glad you came back you know III
[44:21] do say this from my from my heart you
[44:26] know I I never intend to minister that
[44:31] long and you might say by the salmon you
[44:32] just kind of say that no I I give them
[44:36] all but I know that if I'd said anyway
[44:38] everything that was in front of me that
[44:40] was here well we'd we'd be here a long
[44:42] time but I just want to say what it is
[44:47] that he sees that's needful to be said
[44:50] for this moment and and and so sometimes
[44:54] you know for myself I I just be honest
[44:58] with you I I don't like going that long
[45:00] because I pay for it I pay for it in a
[45:04] way that it just keeps going as far as
[45:06] within my body and and in my spirit but
[45:08] out what to me I I just I love God's
[45:12] people so I want you to understand I
[45:14] love you and and you you all were
[45:17] pulling last week as well as we were
[45:19] going through these things and so we
[45:21] just we just just so appreciate the Lord
[45:25] we want to just look a little bit more
[45:28] here today and I asked you to keep us in
[45:31] prayer if you wouldn't the wife and I'll
[45:32] be heading out to the meetings they're
[45:34] in North Carolina Lord willing we be
[45:37] speaking there and the service and the
[45:40] convention there but the Tim Hume so
[45:42] just ask that you would just remember us
[45:44] in prayer certainly coverage of prayers
[45:49] and whether Nathan Ericson will be here
[45:52] on Thursday as well as on Sunday so we
[45:56] want to just keep that in prayer and
[45:58] know that God is mindful of our needs
[46:00] amen Romans chapter 4 verse 9
[46:08] Cometh this blessedness then upon the
[46:11] circumcision only or upon the
[46:14] uncircumcision also for we say that
[46:18] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[46:22] righteousness how was it then reckon
[46:25] when he was in circumcision or in
[46:28] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[46:32] in uncircumcision and he received I want
[46:37] you to notice these words and he
[46:40] received the sign of circumcision a seal
[46:45] of the righteousness of the faith which
[46:48] he had being yet being uncircumcised
[46:54] that he might be the father of all them
[46:57] that believed though they be not
[47:00] circumcised that the righteousness might
[47:04] be imputed unto them also so Paul
[47:07] remember what Paul is dealing with here
[47:09] unto Paul was committed the mystery that
[47:13] had been hidden yet was laid down
[47:17] through the Old Testament prophets of
[47:21] how that God would take unto himself a
[47:24] Gentile bride circumcised being that of
[47:27] the Jews the uncircumcised being that of
[47:30] the Gentiles but notice how Paul led by
[47:32] the Spirit of God is bringing this that
[47:34] it would be by that of faith and God
[47:38] recognizing that faith and verse 12 and
[47:41] the father of circumcision to them who
[47:44] are not of the circumcision only but who
[47:48] also walk in the steps of that faith of
[47:53] our faith father Abraham you see how
[47:55] that scripture says that who by faith
[47:58] who walk in the steps of our Father the
[48:03] steps of that faith of our father
[48:06] Abraham we're not we don't have a
[48:08] different faith it's V faith
[48:12] which he had I want you to watch look at
[48:16] that which he had what did he have that
[48:19] faith he had being yet uncircumcised for
[48:25] the promise that he should be heir of
[48:27] the world was not to Abraham or to his
[48:29] seed through the law but through the
[48:33] righteousness of faith a man so let's
[48:39] just look to the Lord in the word of
[48:40] Prayer you're this morning you've got a
[48:42] need on your heart why don't you just
[48:44] let it be known by an uplifted hand say
[48:46] Lord I received this morning I received
[48:49] my answer Lord I receive what I have
[48:51] need for you Lord Jesus you are Lord you
[48:57] have the ever-present God Lord you're
[49:00] the lovely one Lord in our midst
[49:04] Lord that has touched our hearts and
[49:06] lives and Lord Jesus how we just Lord so
[49:10] appreciate you Lord how we're thankful
[49:13] God how that you come Lord you peel back
[49:17] the pages of your word
[49:18] oh god you not only take the seals off
[49:21] of this book but you take them off of
[49:23] our lives Oh God
[49:25] that father you're the only one Lord
[49:28] that can do that Lord we love you and we
[49:31] praise you this morning God and just ask
[49:33] that Lord that in the sweetness of your
[49:36] holy spirit
[49:37] Oh God made the same rushing mighty wind
[49:40] just move Oh God not just in this
[49:43] building but Lord we know it came in the
[49:46] building where they were at first and
[49:48] then Lord it came Lord to every
[49:50] individual temple Lord that was seated
[49:53] in that building Lord with our hearts
[49:56] God filled with an expectation Lord as
[49:58] believers we ask that God that you would
[50:02] pour out of the Holy Ghost this morning
[50:04] Lord God once again Oh God a refreshing
[50:08] Lord for you know our needs Lord you
[50:11] know Lord behind every uplifted hand
[50:13] Lord and you're the dissolver of every
[50:15] doubt or God you are the answer to every
[50:19] question Lord so Lord for every need
[50:22] Lord God we come
[50:23] minute Lord to you and we believe that
[50:26] it is your will that that need or God
[50:29] would be satisfied in our lives so Lord
[50:32] God is your children Lord we plant that
[50:34] seed we water with praise we accept that
[50:38] Lord and we now claim it or God as our
[50:41] very own and we thank you Lord for the
[50:44] promises Lord that you have made to us
[50:47] Oh God
[50:48] for they are for us Lord we love you and
[50:51] praising our Father in the name of Jesus
[50:53] Christ amen
[50:55] and then God blesses your being seated I
[50:58] want to come back here this morning and
[51:01] I I want to to deal with the once again
[51:07] just to polish up a little bit on this
[51:12] on the the sign of circumcision and then
[51:16] moving right into that of the seal and
[51:18] we're dealing with the the the thought
[51:21] the promise of the Father and what is
[51:23] the Holy Ghost because it's things that
[51:29] if I can say it like this and we all I
[51:31] believe would agree there's so much to
[51:34] where that the label of Christian has
[51:37] been so cheapened and so weakened to
[51:40] where it does not hold the same value
[51:44] that it are used to hold and what I mean
[51:47] is you can even look at it and you know
[51:49] we're you know even within the currency
[51:53] that's on the market right now the
[51:54] dollar and everything else that goes on
[51:56] and there look and does it hold the
[51:59] value you know that that it always held
[52:02] and you know I think back in the in the
[52:05] in in in in in the Bible times where it
[52:08] would speak of how they would take a
[52:10] coin and they they would weigh things by
[52:13] this coin and and and they would put
[52:16] these weights on but they would begin to
[52:17] shave those weights down so that just in
[52:20] our terminology it might say a5 like
[52:23] like a five pounds on it but yet it
[52:26] really wasn't five pounds it had been
[52:29] shaved down to where it did not hold the
[52:32] same density and I believe that was all
[52:35] my heart that
[52:36] without the Holy Ghost we we are are
[52:40] helpless we we would not know where we
[52:45] are where we ought to be and where we
[52:48] are going without the Holy Spirit and so
[52:51] it all comes back down to us as the
[52:53] believer to realize the greatest
[52:55] privilege that we have as believers is
[52:58] to be born of the Spirit of God and to
[53:01] be led by the Holy Ghost and that's the
[53:03] greatest privilege that that we have as
[53:06] believers and we know that within us
[53:09] that there is a a great difference in a
[53:12] Christian and then a Holy Ghost filled
[53:14] Christian many times that we see and I
[53:17] want you to also take courage in this
[53:19] that where their hearts are listening to
[53:22] it now or later but you don't ever don't
[53:25] ever despise the small things or leave
[53:29] leave loose or look out and say well you
[53:32] know I've not arrived to this place yet
[53:35] but it's always something when you look
[53:37] at like a board that is in front of you
[53:40] and you want to know where you are and
[53:42] you know okay this is where I want to be
[53:45] then if you can see where you are then
[53:48] you actually begin to look at that there
[53:50] are checkpoints that you're going to
[53:52] cross in order to arrive at this place
[53:54] and I just say it like this and you know
[53:57] I know that malls are old-fashioned now
[53:59] but if you wanted to go through a
[54:01] certain store in the mall you're not
[54:03] going to get into that store unless you
[54:05] first get in the mall so they're first
[54:07] has to start alive that starts with
[54:09] repentance and I I'll just say it feel
[54:11] like this I don't discount that I don't
[54:14] look down on that but the Holy Ghost it
[54:16] calls us to a deeper walk because who is
[54:19] it that brought us to repentance is him
[54:22] himself and and he's the one that has
[54:24] already that starts to work in us you
[54:27] see that the the filling of the Holy
[54:29] Ghost the capping of the Holy Ghost is
[54:31] the capping of his work that's been
[54:34] going on all along
[54:36] so when we when we recognize this there
[54:39] can be lives that are in process and I
[54:42] think God for a life that's in process
[54:44] but but you know it's just like when
[54:46] it's in process we
[54:48] don't want to just let it set on the
[54:49] assembly line let's keep moving on in
[54:52] the things of God let's get to the place
[54:55] that God desires us to get to and I'll
[54:58] say it like this this morning and and
[55:00] trust that this Holy Ghost will just
[55:02] bring it clear it is all the work of God
[55:05] and it takes God and it is him that
[55:08] brings it all along into that place to
[55:11] where you just pray in your hearts I've
[55:13] got some ground to cover here but I want
[55:15] to to to hopefully get us to a place to
[55:19] where you can see and just revisiting
[55:22] these things are not new to many of us
[55:24] these things are refreshing but yet I
[55:26] want to revisit them just feeling led of
[55:29] the Holy Spirit to do that that it would
[55:31] also bring comfort to our hearts then it
[55:34] would also be that to where you can take
[55:36] that and and put it right in the devil's
[55:38] face and say take that to think of it
[55:43] first of all Abraham as we looked in the
[55:46] scripture and God had spoke to him and
[55:49] called to him even when he was down
[55:51] there in the midst of the condition that
[55:54] he was in down there and in Babylon or
[55:57] the earth of counties where he was at
[55:59] and the Word of God came to him and
[56:01] ministered to him and then as Abraham
[56:04] began to follow the voice and the
[56:07] leading of God then God comes around and
[56:10] comes in Genesis 17 like we looked at
[56:13] last week and he ministers to Abraham
[56:16] the sign of circumcision
[56:18] you see God now is taking the promise
[56:22] that he's made to Abraham Abraham has
[56:25] believed in that promise Abraham has
[56:27] walked and he has journeyed out of the
[56:29] land where he is come into the land of
[56:31] promise and now God after confirming the
[56:35] covenant of what that that he alone will
[56:37] do in Genesis 15 then God comes along
[56:40] and God tells him I want you to
[56:43] circumcise every male that is among you
[56:47] those that are born in the house and
[56:49] even those that are bought with money I
[56:52] want you to circumcise them and it will
[56:55] be a sign that the scripture says in
[56:58] Genesis 17 it would be a
[57:00] token of the Covenant it would be a sign
[57:03] and so we find that God's Word as it is
[57:06] ministered now that word it comes to
[57:09] become an actual sign that is reflected
[57:13] in was called to reproduce the faith of
[57:17] Elohim and when it came to that place he
[57:20] said then God steps in and he seals him
[57:23] and now it becomes the faith of Elohim
[57:26] now manifested through Abraham's life
[57:30] a pain that calls those things that are
[57:32] not as though they harm you see that's
[57:36] what the seal of God does the sign of
[57:38] circumcision it is that which you can
[57:41] say this belongs to me and I'll say it
[57:46] to you like this this morning as the son
[57:49] and daughter of God the word in this
[57:51] hour it comes to call sons and daughters
[57:54] of God and it comes to anoint our hearts
[57:58] to believe in the Word of God to believe
[58:01] despite all doubt and unbelief and every
[58:05] devil that's around us there is an
[58:07] anointing that has been poured out upon
[58:10] this generation and it is an anointing
[58:13] of God's Word the Holy Spirit to anoint
[58:17] sons and daughters of God to walk where
[58:20] Enoch walk to walk where Abraham walk to
[58:23] walk where Rebecca law to walk were
[58:26] Esther walk it is the anointing of the
[58:28] word a man that is capable to believer
[58:31] in this hour and he calls us to this
[58:34] place that Christ might fulfill every
[58:38] promise that he's ever made and make it
[58:41] manifest through the life of the
[58:43] believer a man we are under the
[58:46] anointing of the word in this hour we've
[58:54] been not a we're not anointed to fail
[58:58] we've been anointed for rapture brother
[59:03] we're not going down we're going up amen
[59:10] this is the anointing that's been poured
[59:12] out we've been not we have not been
[59:14] anointed with a vile soul was anointed
[59:17] with a vile a foul as judgment but we
[59:21] have been anointed with the Horn of the
[59:24] RAM hey Manon has been poured out God
[59:30] gave that anointing oil that word that
[59:32] came to the Prophet and now what did the
[59:35] prophet do he was told there is a man
[59:38] down here I want you to go and noid him
[59:41] and the Prophet had to be obedient to
[59:45] the word of the Lord it need passed by
[59:48] every one of those seven sons but it was
[59:50] the eighth son that he came and he
[59:53] anointed and remember when he was there
[59:56] to measure that anointing he asked he
[1:00:00] looked at every one of them and said man
[1:00:01] this is a good looking one this is a
[1:00:03] good surely the Lord surely this was the
[1:00:05] one but the one that he was too anointed
[1:00:08] was not in the house at that time but he
[1:00:11] asked where is he at there is one to
[1:00:14] match the word in this hour I'm telling
[1:00:19] you I'm looking at you this morning
[1:00:22] you're anointed for this hour
[1:00:26] [Applause]
[1:00:28] hallelujah the Holy Ghost has sought you
[1:00:32] out
[1:00:35] Natalia
[1:00:37] it is the heavenly father he knew
[1:00:39] exactly and knows exactly where you have
[1:00:42] been and he sought you out and drew you
[1:00:45] to himself this circumcision is a type
[1:00:51] of the Holy Ghost this in the Old
[1:00:54] Testament types that now would become
[1:00:58] manifest God is showing in types it was
[1:01:03] a sign of separation and distinction
[1:01:06] from all other people it is the sign of
[1:01:11] the covenant to a covenant people
[1:01:15] amen and remember as I want you to I
[1:01:18] want you to listen this now for
[1:01:20] everybody remember it is the Word of God
[1:01:23] being received and acted upon that
[1:01:26] actually brings the separation in a life
[1:01:45] like fishing
[1:01:51] it actually listen to me now the Word of
[1:01:54] God being received listen though the
[1:01:57] Word of God can't do nothing for you if
[1:01:58] you don't receive it I believe it I mean
[1:02:03] I've asked you do you receive it you
[1:02:04] first got to believe it but then you got
[1:02:06] to receive it and then once you receive
[1:02:10] it you begin to act upon it not by
[1:02:15] feelings you act upon the word you have
[1:02:17] been leaved and received when you do
[1:02:21] that it brings separation let me just be
[1:02:23] very clearly blue BAM tells us just like
[1:02:25] this this is scriptural principles when
[1:02:28] you when you come and you receive the
[1:02:30] Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior not
[1:02:33] just will I believe no have you made him
[1:02:35] your Savior then then you make a
[1:02:40] confession I'm a Christian and you
[1:02:43] confess what it is that you have
[1:02:46] received I have received I have believed
[1:02:49] he was he was bruised from my iniquity
[1:02:52] the chastisement of my peace is upon him
[1:02:55] by His stripes I'm healed
[1:02:58] he has borrowing my transmission then
[1:03:00] you confess cuz he is the high priest of
[1:03:04] your confession and as you confess it it
[1:03:08] works righteousness
[1:03:16] glory so to recognize that these
[1:03:21] promises that they are for us that it
[1:03:26] has come to us the Bible tells us in
[1:03:30] Galatians 3 let me read this now verse
[1:03:32] 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the
[1:03:35] curse of the law being made a curse for
[1:03:38] us for it is written cursed is every one
[1:03:41] that hangeth on a tree
[1:03:44] aren't you glad he brought judgment on
[1:03:46] sin nature he took within himself and he
[1:03:50] judged the Prince of this world
[1:03:52] he brought judgment on sin nature he
[1:03:55] paid the penalty and now he comes right
[1:03:57] back around with that same life and he
[1:04:00] ministers to you and I and removes the
[1:04:03] reproach of Egypt from upon our lives he
[1:04:06] listened to me he literally takes the
[1:04:09] condemnation that's over your life in
[1:04:11] the house of judgment he lifts it and
[1:04:14] puts it right back on the accuser that's
[1:04:19] what the blood of Jesus Christ tells it
[1:04:22] lifts it and puts it back on the one who
[1:04:26] is the originator of it hallelujah
[1:04:32] that's the shot knife of the world well
[1:04:37] glory verse 14 that the blessing of
[1:04:41] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[1:04:44] through Jesus Christ remember his hands
[1:04:47] were crossed when he blessed Joseph boys
[1:04:50] and that we might receive the promise of
[1:04:53] the Spirit through faith we were aliens
[1:04:57] strangers to the Covenant of promise but
[1:05:00] the Jews were blinded in the rejection
[1:05:03] of Messiah and the same way that they
[1:05:07] were rejected and dispersed John also
[1:05:09] said I will gather them in
[1:05:11] loving-kindness I will gather them I
[1:05:15] will bring them back home I will cause
[1:05:18] the places that are desolate to become
[1:05:21] fruitful alleluia God said I'll take
[1:05:26] away the reproach that had been brought
[1:05:28] to my name I will bring you back home
[1:05:34] aren't you glad that is a type that
[1:05:37] right there what God does you'll do with
[1:05:39] Israel he's in process is the same thing
[1:05:42] that God has done with us as believers
[1:05:46] we were outside of this land of promise
[1:05:49] but he has brought us back home why were
[1:05:53] we outside of this land of promise
[1:05:54] because they rejected
[1:05:57] holy ghost but he said I'll bring you
[1:06:01] back that land of promise is the baptism
[1:06:04] of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:05] it is the full Word of God and God said
[1:06:08] I'll bring you back to my self I will
[1:06:11] plant you in this land all the idols
[1:06:14] that have been set up in the slab they
[1:06:17] shall be cleansed they shall be removed
[1:06:20] the names of every other God I'll take
[1:06:22] it out of your vocabulary I'll give you
[1:06:25] a language that will be a pure language
[1:06:29] there will be my own utterance well
[1:06:37] blessed be the name of the Lord thank
[1:06:41] God for this evening light hallelujah
[1:06:47] glory be to God ah I felt like just
[1:06:50] preaching on them few scriptures this
[1:06:51] morning
[1:06:52] Oh verse 26 for ye are all the children
[1:06:58] of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[1:07:03] for as many of you has been baptized
[1:07:06] into Christ have put on Christ Paul not
[1:07:11] just talking about being baptized which
[1:07:13] you should be baptized in the name of
[1:07:16] Jesus Christ it's not an option you
[1:07:20] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:07:23] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:07:25] sins
[1:07:27] Booth's and I believe it right here but
[1:07:30] the Bible tells us in the book of Peter
[1:07:32] 1st Peter chapter 3 I believe it is that
[1:07:34] not walking into water baptism it is a
[1:07:37] sign that there is an inward work that
[1:07:40] has taken place you say God looks on the
[1:07:45] heart I agree we read now to Romans 4
[1:07:47] but remember what God looks on the heart
[1:07:50] will come to a full expression out in
[1:07:52] the life amen baptized into Christ you
[1:07:57] y'all you all been here and heard me
[1:07:59] preach on this enough this word Bab
[1:08:00] baptized right here it means to change
[1:08:03] your cucumber to a pickle
[1:08:06] there's two baptisms the cucumber you
[1:08:09] baptize it how many in here can can
[1:08:11] vegetables before you know way back in
[1:08:14] the days now we just eat the pickles
[1:08:16] that's all right
[1:08:18] it's a lot of work man I watched mom and
[1:08:20] daddy do it it's a lot of work when they
[1:08:22] did that stuff but you know that in the
[1:08:24] brother Joe and they take that cucumber
[1:08:25] you you you dip that in that hot water
[1:08:27] and when you dip it in that hot water
[1:08:29] brother David comes right back got a
[1:08:31] cucumber again but you know the hot
[1:08:33] waters are necessary because after the
[1:08:36] hot water he gets an all you know open
[1:08:38] and then you can take that cucumber and
[1:08:40] you put it down in that vinegar that
[1:08:42] vinegar has the acidity and the
[1:08:44] chemicals within it it changes it from a
[1:08:47] cucumber to a pickle brother it can
[1:08:50] never be a cucumber again it has become
[1:08:53] a pickle you see though just water
[1:08:55] baptism a person could go on and remain
[1:08:58] the same but when they have been
[1:09:00] baptized by the Holy Ghost and that ties
[1:09:03] into the body of Jesus Christ he can
[1:09:06] never go back out you have been changed
[1:09:09] they might look at you and said hey you
[1:09:11] you look like you was a cucumber one
[1:09:13] time I used to be a cucumber but the
[1:09:16] essence and the flavor and the aroma on
[1:09:19] my life is no longer a cucumber
[1:09:22] I am a pickle this is the kind of pickle
[1:09:28] I want to be in the purple brings this
[1:09:35] around there is neither Jew nor Greek
[1:09:39] there is neither bond nor free there is
[1:09:44] neither male nor female for you are all
[1:09:48] one in Christ Jesus
[1:09:49] what Paul saying all must receive the
[1:09:52] same promise and receive it in the same
[1:09:55] way God don't care how rich you are or
[1:09:58] how poor you are you've got to come the
[1:10:00] same way
[1:10:01] God don't cows much you are how dumb you
[1:10:04] are you've got to come the same way
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:09] he didn't matter if it's a servant or it
[1:10:12] was a master
[1:10:13] you gotta come the same way they manage
[1:10:16] humility to the Word of God that is
[1:10:19] ministered to our hearts and remember
[1:10:23] what humility does humility or Asian
[1:10:26] power humble yourselves under the mighty
[1:10:29] hand of God first Peter and he shall
[1:10:32] exalt thee in due time is that right now
[1:10:36] let's look at this here a little bit in
[1:10:37] verse 11 and he received the sign of
[1:10:39] circumcision romans 4:11 a seal of the
[1:10:43] righteousness of the faith which he had
[1:10:45] yet being uncircumcised now a seal in
[1:10:50] itself it's a like a signet ring an
[1:10:54] inscription or an impression that would
[1:10:56] be made by seal it's also that which
[1:11:01] would be likened to that of the name of
[1:11:05] God of Christ stamped on their foreheads
[1:11:07] I'm Oh we'll get to that in a moment
[1:11:08] then it's it's the confirming or proving
[1:11:12] or authenticating of anything it is a
[1:11:16] seal a token or a proof in Ephesians
[1:11:20] chapter one now notice this in Ephesians
[1:11:23] chapter one let's just skip to verse 13
[1:11:25] in whom speaking of Jesus Christ in whom
[1:11:29] ye also trusted
[1:11:32] after that you heard the word of truth
[1:11:34] so you got you have to you can't believe
[1:11:36] until you're first here well I've always
[1:11:40] believed the Bible but now the sounding
[1:11:43] comes personal to let you know it's not
[1:11:46] just a good book amen this is God's will
[1:11:52] being ministered to his children so the
[1:11:56] gospel has got to be sounded first once
[1:12:01] it's sounded then you you you trust you
[1:12:04] believe after that you heard the word of
[1:12:08] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[1:12:11] whom also after that you believed you
[1:12:14] were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:12:17] promise which is the earnest of our
[1:12:21] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:12:24] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:12:27] his glory let me just say it to you like
[1:12:31] this God is going to accomplish what he
[1:12:35] already foresaw he tells you before the
[1:12:42] foundation of the world in him even
[1:12:45] through all your mistakes all the mud
[1:12:47] all the muck everything that would be
[1:12:49] packed in you but he wasn't choosing the
[1:12:52] mud or the month he looked at the life
[1:12:55] that would be there and through the
[1:12:57] resurrection power he would raise up
[1:12:59] that life that he knew I'm talking about
[1:13:02] the same one that was there in the book
[1:13:05] of Job where it says that the sons of
[1:13:07] God that the morning stars shouted for
[1:13:10] joy why we shouted in knowing that our
[1:13:14] redemption is sure there is a lamb there
[1:13:17] is a way that is made for us to come
[1:13:21] back home
[1:13:23] rather when that word begins to strike
[1:13:26] our heart he begins to bring our
[1:13:28] rejoicing hey believing you might look
[1:13:31] and say I don't even have the promise
[1:13:33] yet but there's an anointing upon the
[1:13:36] word that's contacting with you like a
[1:13:39] deep callin to the deed and you believe
[1:13:42] that it is for you what's it doing the
[1:13:49] words calling your name out I said the
[1:13:54] words calling your name out fusions 4:30
[1:14:03] and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:14:06] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:14:10] your redemption now you know a seal
[1:14:14] talking about now the Holy Ghost being a
[1:14:17] seal you know a seal shows coming and
[1:14:19] going
[1:14:25] you know when you have to have certain
[1:14:27] papers that have to be have a seal put
[1:14:30] on their right they got a special device
[1:14:33] you you can't just you don't go by one
[1:14:36] of these like you buy a whole bunch you
[1:14:41] don't you got to go through training you
[1:14:43] got to be authorized and validated to
[1:14:45] use that seal that seal itself that is
[1:14:49] being administered it takes ordinary
[1:14:51] normal paper but when that seal goes up
[1:14:56] on that paper you can take it and though
[1:15:00] you may not altogether see it right away
[1:15:03] but you can feel it and know it's there
[1:15:07] come on somebody Amen there because it
[1:15:11] is a coming and a glowing Amen I'm glad
[1:15:15] that he preserveth are coming in and are
[1:15:18] going out
[1:15:19] amen he's a seal of our lives a seal
[1:15:24] itself it shows a seal shows ownership
[1:15:28] remember God would speak therein in
[1:15:31] Timothy I believe it's 2nd Timothy that
[1:15:33] the foundation of God standeth sure
[1:15:36] having this seal that the Lord knoweth
[1:15:41] them that are his so it is receiving the
[1:15:45] seal listen to me the seal is receiving
[1:15:49] that impression and you know you could
[1:15:51] take that you can take that sheet of
[1:15:52] paper and you could try to do all you
[1:15:54] want to do you're not going to get that
[1:15:55] seal out of that paper I know there
[1:15:59] might be all sorts of things they can do
[1:16:00] it's a we can get it back out of it but
[1:16:02] you understand what I'm trying to say
[1:16:03] that in itself they might be able to
[1:16:06] kind of mess with that but we're talking
[1:16:08] about the seal of the Living God and
[1:16:10] once God has put that seal brother he
[1:16:13] don't take back none of his words God
[1:16:16] don't say oops I made a mistake he don't
[1:16:20] take back his word you are sealed unto
[1:16:24] the day of redemption let me just say
[1:16:29] like this the seal speaks of a finished
[1:16:32] work
[1:16:34] you are part listen to me now
[1:16:36] you are part of the finished word of the
[1:16:40] true atonement of Calvary your destiny
[1:16:45] is set and yet we are being perfected by
[1:16:49] the Ministry of the word
[1:16:53] we are growing up into him in all things
[1:16:57] it's quite a paradox he is finishing
[1:17:00] what he finished quite a paradox in it
[1:17:06] the seal itself you are sealed unto the
[1:17:09] day of your Redemption you're not sealed
[1:17:14] till you make your first mistake and
[1:17:16] then you're unsealed come on somebody
[1:17:20] amen you are sealed unto the day of
[1:17:23] redemption and that seal is not
[1:17:27] something separate from God but it is
[1:17:30] God himself hallelujah that liquor fire
[1:17:36] that part of God that inheritance that
[1:17:39] belongs to you that life that you were
[1:17:42] intended to have that life now showing
[1:17:45] live God's own life it comes into your
[1:17:48] life and brother what does it do it
[1:17:51] seals you under the day of redemption
[1:17:52] the Prophet said it like this from
[1:17:55] eternity to eternity there was a breach
[1:17:58] in your soul and the mind of God but God
[1:18:02] came down and he filled the breach and
[1:18:06] that's what the Holy Ghost is it is the
[1:18:09] abstract - the title deed it is the seal
[1:18:12] that ties you back in it is there we put
[1:18:16] his hand on a holy God and a sinful man
[1:18:19] he does away with the chasm and that's
[1:18:23] what the Holy Ghost does it feels the
[1:18:26] breach let me move to this day because
[1:18:30] I'm preaching from learning this day
[1:18:32] that is why the Ministry of the breech
[1:18:35] had to come forward before the first
[1:18:38] seal could ever be opened
[1:18:43] hallelujah before these truths can be
[1:18:47] really revealed there must be a
[1:18:50] separated life that is tied into God and
[1:18:53] there's no one a church cannot tie his
[1:18:56] back who revelations 5 it was looking
[1:19:05] for one a strong angel on earth
[1:19:08] proclaiming oh maybe I'm just feeling
[1:19:12] this way but let him come forth or
[1:19:15] forever hold his peace
[1:19:17] you know I'm quoting now amen and here
[1:19:21] come forth the lamb not a portion not a
[1:19:24] greater power but here came the entire
[1:19:27] fullness of the Holy Ghost to come and
[1:19:30] visit the church the Ministry of V
[1:19:33] southern man and it never left the
[1:19:36] church when the Prophet we'll also see
[1:19:38] that Saint Son of Man is here with you
[1:19:42] and I
[1:19:42] he is veiled in his bride hallelujah and
[1:19:49] that being in us is the seal the seal of
[1:19:54] this message you understand me now you
[1:20:01] can look at a truth and you recognize
[1:20:03] God has sealed this he's vindicated it
[1:20:06] Apollo's preached that vindication of
[1:20:09] the seal that Jesus was the Messiah but
[1:20:13] a palace was not preaching the seal to
[1:20:16] come to the womb of the believer you
[1:20:19] understand he was preaching on the
[1:20:21] messenger on the messenger and he was
[1:20:23] preaching on all of these things but
[1:20:24] where it was essential if you miss the
[1:20:27] Holy Ghost you miss it all because he is
[1:20:31] the feast he is the Sabbath he is a
[1:20:35] rapture he is a Redemption
[1:20:38] he is our sanctification so it was
[1:20:42] necessary that the coming of that word
[1:20:45] when God sends a message it is a promise
[1:20:48] that when that promise comes that there
[1:20:51] is
[1:20:52] coming into the hearts of the believers
[1:20:54] when he went away he said if I go away I
[1:20:57] will come again and receive you unto
[1:20:59] myself
[1:21:00] he said I'll send back the Holy Ghost
[1:21:02] what was it in his coming he made a
[1:21:05] promise of his coming by the Holy Ghost
[1:21:08] that would call me in the lives of the
[1:21:11] believer and that coming will now be
[1:21:13] that message in flesh in the lives of
[1:21:16] the people we just say like this
[1:21:22] I need no proof that this message is of
[1:21:24] God God has vindicated it and he's
[1:21:30] vindicated it right here
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:37] you said he'd revealed it but remember
[1:21:39] by the venom in the seals he starts
[1:21:41] laying it in and the seals coming into
[1:21:42] the future home he said it must not just
[1:21:44] be by revelation it must be by divine
[1:21:47] vindication as well is that right it's a
[1:21:53] sign that God gives his chosen people to
[1:21:55] receive that sign is to be finished with
[1:21:58] the world and the things of the world it
[1:22:00] is in another place of the scripture and
[1:22:02] I'm just moving along it is in another
[1:22:04] place of the scripture once again it
[1:22:06] speaks of it is the earnest of the
[1:22:08] Spirit in our hearts the earnest meaning
[1:22:11] that is the money that is the
[1:22:13] downpayment to show that there is a full
[1:22:16] payment to be made amen the
[1:22:20] transformation of our soul the very the
[1:22:24] very new birth itself the baptism of the
[1:22:27] Holy Ghost all one in the same all right
[1:22:28] there within our lives it is that which
[1:22:31] brings the witness and the groaning
[1:22:33] within our life to be clothed upon not
[1:22:36] that we should not be clothed but we are
[1:22:38] longing for that house that is not made
[1:22:41] with hands but that which as Peter said
[1:22:43] is reserved in the heavens and we have
[1:22:46] received now on earth a wedding garment
[1:22:49] the divine invitation of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:51] than the entrance that's been ministered
[1:22:53] to us that we can stand there and say I
[1:22:57] waiting to receive my body hey man you
[1:23:08] know over and over when he sealed it you
[1:23:12] think sometimes how the experiences in
[1:23:14] our life how God takes us through
[1:23:16] experiences in our life and sometimes we
[1:23:19] wonder we may not even understand why
[1:23:21] we're in this experience we don't let me
[1:23:25] just say like this it ain't nothing
[1:23:26] about it maybe they feel spiritual
[1:23:32] brother branham worked in a railroad a
[1:23:37] railroad yard a rail yard he worked
[1:23:41] there for a period of time and what he
[1:23:44] watched was is those cars those cars had
[1:23:50] to be packed a certain way they had to
[1:23:55] have certain that they had the inspector
[1:23:57] would come along and he's the one that
[1:24:00] would inspect them cars the inspector
[1:24:03] would be the one to say this looks good
[1:24:06] right here well how did they know what
[1:24:11] would be good because the goodness of
[1:24:13] God lead us us come on somebody god
[1:24:17] don't leave you and I wondering like
[1:24:19] well I wonder what the Bible said the
[1:24:21] goodness of God leads us to repentance
[1:24:23] God leads us you understand and the
[1:24:26] inspector is the Sailor himself is the
[1:24:31] Lord Jesus is the Holy Ghost all one in
[1:24:34] the same you're with me now
[1:24:36] so is not it is not Deegan you don't got
[1:24:39] two different people you know like
[1:24:41] sometimes you can experience and work
[1:24:42] you got this one they got their mind
[1:24:43] this way and this one over here this way
[1:24:45] and you wonder you would think man if we
[1:24:46] can just get everybody together on the
[1:24:49] same page let me tell you something the
[1:24:51] same one who seals you is the same one
[1:24:54] that has dealt with your life in your
[1:24:57] heart all along whether he is over the
[1:25:02] Bible says in the book of Psalms
[1:25:03] he is over the work of his hands
[1:25:07] amen Paul picks it up there in the book
[1:25:10] of Ephesians we are his workmanship is
[1:25:14] that right soul in there has to come
[1:25:17] then a a sealing where the inspector
[1:25:20] looks at things and listen to me now
[1:25:22] that inspector knows that I've got to
[1:25:25] make sure that this is all tightly
[1:25:27] packed together because it's going to be
[1:25:29] a rough ride there's gonna be tests and
[1:25:33] trials that will literally shake your
[1:25:35] very insides there's gonna be tests and
[1:25:39] trials that would shake you to a place
[1:25:42] where you would say if that's the way
[1:25:44] it's going to be but there is a seal
[1:25:47] that'll hold you in the midst of that
[1:25:50] time when you could say I can't go on
[1:25:53] anymore but he says you didn't start
[1:25:56] this word you are my world and I finish
[1:25:59] all my words I have sealed you under the
[1:26:03] day of your Redemption draweth me to God
[1:26:17] I feel like running a little bit but I
[1:26:20] need to preach we're not just talking of
[1:26:23] somebody who's trying to make a little
[1:26:25] things to look good and get a promotion
[1:26:27] but you remember the greatest promotion
[1:26:30] that our Lord Jesus will have will be
[1:26:34] when he brings his bride in rapture and
[1:26:38] presents us unto himself a glorious
[1:26:41] church without spot wrinkle blemish or
[1:26:44] any such thing he has not left this to
[1:26:47] anybody else he said you are my
[1:26:52] responsibility I took the veil off your
[1:26:56] life it's on my shoulder the key of
[1:26:59] David I
[1:27:01] the mystery to your life I will not let
[1:27:05] you go talking about the seal now of the
[1:27:11] inspector
[1:27:15] it can't be loose can't be loose with
[1:27:22] bream said loose temper loose tongue
[1:27:24] loose talk about others dirty habits
[1:27:27] vile things vulgarity behind he can't
[1:27:29] seal it let me just say this to you like
[1:27:34] this
[1:27:37] there is transforming power in this word
[1:27:41] I don't have to go through the whole
[1:27:47] Bible to prove that you can look in the
[1:27:49] very first scriptures of Genesis 1 in
[1:27:55] the beginning God said he was it was an
[1:27:59] earth that had come under darkness and
[1:28:03] needed Redemption come on somebody
[1:28:05] it was void and darkness covered the
[1:28:08] deep well how did God address that
[1:28:11] situation God said and when God said the
[1:28:17] Spirit of God moved what did the Spirit
[1:28:21] of God do it moved to bring forth God's
[1:28:25] desire of what he had in his mind when
[1:28:29] he spoke that the darkness be pushed
[1:28:31] away that one is laying there might come
[1:28:34] forth
[1:28:37] this assignment what are you saying in
[1:28:39] layman's terms I'm saying as you receive
[1:28:41] the word you become the word how'd you
[1:28:44] let the word flow through you say how do
[1:28:48] I let it flow through you if it cut you
[1:28:50] say cut on Jesus cuz what's he doing
[1:28:53] he's cutting away everything that's not
[1:28:56] like him my flesh don't want to be cut
[1:29:01] off but my soul says Jesus cat away
[1:29:04] everything that needs to be cut away cuz
[1:29:10] I'd be honest with you I've found in my
[1:29:12] life where he dealing right now with
[1:29:14] some fine-tuned things he gets right
[1:29:16] down into the business on certain things
[1:29:18] and you know what within it various
[1:29:21] grace that he ministers to my heart I
[1:29:24] believe that he is able and I believe
[1:29:28] that within me is that overcoming power
[1:29:31] it's within you too brother it's in you
[1:29:34] too sister yes sir it's transforming
[1:29:40] power in the world alone that's why that
[1:29:42] the preach any other word will not
[1:29:45] produce the effect that God is calling
[1:29:47] for in this hour but God is ministering
[1:29:51] a word of acceptance an idiot's
[1:29:54] anointing our faith to believe the
[1:29:56] impossible it is anointing our eyes to
[1:30:00] be able to see ourselves as God sees us
[1:30:03] and not how we think of ourselves he
[1:30:11] does that work the Bible said what Peter
[1:30:13] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:30:17] fell on her so it's to heed the voice of
[1:30:22] the Lord that's called you don't stop
[1:30:25] until you're safely in his arms remember
[1:30:28] who walk in the steps of the faith of
[1:30:30] Abraham the Bible said work out your own
[1:30:33] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:30:35] it's the cleansing of ourselves by the
[1:30:39] washing of water by the word that might
[1:30:41] seem kind of well I can't think of the
[1:30:45] word right now it might seem kind of you
[1:30:47] know contradictory and cleanse ourselves
[1:30:49] by the
[1:30:50] the water by the word well remember when
[1:30:52] to wash ourselves by the water the word
[1:30:54] the Prophet would pick it up an
[1:30:56] invisible Union and he would say that
[1:30:58] here has we come he said we can stand
[1:31:01] under that water and be washed by the
[1:31:04] water of the word brother let me tell
[1:31:06] you something what the washing of the
[1:31:07] water of the word does it bypasses your
[1:31:10] intellect it bypasses what you could put
[1:31:12] together or make sense of this word
[1:31:15] jesus said my words they are spirit and
[1:31:17] life and when that word is coming forth
[1:31:19] there are things that you may not even
[1:31:21] sense or feel that is actually being
[1:31:24] cast out right now and the word by your
[1:31:26] setting there agreeing with it it's
[1:31:28] giving the word preeminence and Dominion
[1:31:30] in your life and the scepter of the king
[1:31:33] is coming out on that pain that is there
[1:31:35] that is sought to trouble you
[1:31:38] the washing of water by the word it has
[1:31:41] within it rich inner to power glory oh I
[1:31:49] wish I could just preach this morning
[1:31:54] hallelujah because the Bible says you
[1:31:57] know even when you look and say well
[1:31:59] brother Sam a while like you harping on
[1:32:01] this and harping on that
[1:32:02] listen Heian harping on nothing but I
[1:32:04] will tell you a promise in God's Word
[1:32:06] the Bible said without holiness no man
[1:32:07] shall see God without holiness no man
[1:32:13] shall see God and I believe you in
[1:32:17] scripture here in the Bible it says in
[1:32:19] the Song of Solomon chapter eight verse
[1:32:21] six
[1:32:22] here is the bridegroom speaking to the
[1:32:24] bride set me as a seal upon that heart
[1:32:27] as a seal upon that arm in other words
[1:32:30] you're not just here upon your heart but
[1:32:32] let me be the strength of your life for
[1:32:36] love is as strong as death
[1:32:39] I hate to admit this Joss but it's the
[1:32:42] truth
[1:32:43] I look back you know online on my own
[1:32:45] computer at home and I'm there studying
[1:32:47] of the day brother Aaron sometimes here
[1:32:50] I'll come back in and I'll walk back in
[1:32:51] and a day or in the evening with me you
[1:32:53] know at different times I take a little
[1:32:54] get a cup of coffee I'll walk back in
[1:32:56] and I see pictures
[1:32:58] family pictures come up and pictures
[1:33:01] come up of some of you all too and some
[1:33:04] of y'all don't look the same as you did
[1:33:05] two years ago
[1:33:11] you said what are you saying death is
[1:33:13] working in us do you feel it every day
[1:33:17] well you might you know you look at this
[1:33:19] year and think man I feel differently I
[1:33:20] did last year this time but see you
[1:33:23] didn't fill it every day in every moment
[1:33:25] what was happening death is just taking
[1:33:27] over that's what the love of God does in
[1:33:31] a life it takes over love is as strong
[1:33:36] as death the Bible goes on to say in
[1:33:41] verse 7 many waters cannot quench love
[1:33:47] they try to get in that art but they
[1:33:49] can't get a tact they can't quench love
[1:33:53] neither can the floods drown it
[1:33:57] flags are gonna come waters travels try
[1:34:02] to quench it but who shall separate us
[1:34:05] from the love of God Joel would be the
[1:34:15] dog certainly notice the request set me
[1:34:17] as a seal on your heart he's telling her
[1:34:23] let me let me seal the womb that nothing
[1:34:26] else can come in let me seal it with my
[1:34:30] life let me put my seal upon it
[1:34:35] glory to God
[1:34:37] you know the Bible says I'm trying to
[1:34:39] get somewhere here amen you know the
[1:34:42] Bible tells us here that in the Book of
[1:34:45] Revelations that the seal of God it
[1:34:49] tells us that the seal of God that that
[1:34:52] seal is also it's also the it's to have
[1:34:56] the name of God you believe that now if
[1:35:01] you look here in in saw in Revelation 7
[1:35:04] now this is speaking of 144,000 I don't
[1:35:07] have time to preach this now but but
[1:35:10] it's speaking of the 144,000 and how
[1:35:12] that they will be sealed talking about
[1:35:14] the Jews come on did you see the same
[1:35:16] Holy Ghost that you and I are receiving
[1:35:18] that is what the Jews were to receive
[1:35:21] and the Jews receive that God gave them
[1:35:24] a space of grace after they had rejected
[1:35:27] the Messiah you read in the book of Acts
[1:35:29] they went and here it was it started in
[1:35:32] Jerusalem why because God had made a
[1:35:34] promise and Jesus Christ is the minister
[1:35:38] of how the truth of the circumcision to
[1:35:42] that of the Covenant to the circumcision
[1:35:44] and it started there in Jerusalem
[1:35:47] remember God's promise in Ezekiel 9 you
[1:35:50] see how the scriptures all the prophecy
[1:35:52] it ties together in Ezekiel 9 it was a
[1:35:55] judgment that was coming and the seal of
[1:35:58] God was to be administered he did not
[1:36:00] tell them go out there into the streets
[1:36:02] he said I want you to start marking
[1:36:04] people in my sanctuary judgment is to be
[1:36:10] come there now remember there was
[1:36:12] judgment that come but before judgment
[1:36:14] come mercy came and the mercy of God
[1:36:19] ministered the seal of God God will not
[1:36:25] God will not judge the righteous with
[1:36:29] the unrighteous
[1:36:32] look how many scriptures that go all the
[1:36:34] way through that he couldn't even pour
[1:36:36] his judgment out upon solemn lot was
[1:36:39] down there
[1:36:42] God knew he was down there but he needed
[1:36:44] somebody to request prayer for him and
[1:36:49] Abraham had a desire he said aloud here
[1:36:53] for him started real big he narrowed it
[1:36:55] down Abraham knew Abraham listen to me
[1:36:58] Abraham's prayer went and shots in the
[1:37:00] dark he knew who he was praying for this
[1:37:03] is part of my family
[1:37:05] better this was a pair of a righteous
[1:37:08] men throw a beat of God he was standing
[1:37:14] there you know what Abraham was praying
[1:37:16] that prayer of faith because Abraham had
[1:37:19] a seal about his life he had a token
[1:37:22] that he could present with his prayer
[1:37:24] and God said that's just what I was
[1:37:29] thinking you with me so many times we
[1:37:33] talked about how to move this tree over
[1:37:35] here and Adam did this and denom did
[1:37:37] this and God said well that's just what
[1:37:38] I would have done Adam dramatizing it oh
[1:37:41] that that's just exactly what I would
[1:37:42] have called the giraffe that's exactly
[1:37:44] what that's exactly right and how many
[1:37:47] times God will say thank you for
[1:37:51] bringing that name before me a prayer he
[1:37:55] couldn't meet your need and my need
[1:37:58] without anybody else praying but God is
[1:38:04] interested that all the glory goes to
[1:38:07] him he'll bring a name to your heart and
[1:38:11] the name to your heart it'll be the
[1:38:14] Spirit of God that will move in your
[1:38:15] life to break forth an intersession for
[1:38:18] somebody else

[1:38:49] off the top shelf and target it stretch
[1:38:52] your heart say Lord John reach out there
[1:38:54] and touch the throne of God right there
[1:38:57] come on somebody the Bible said I would
[1:39:01] that you were praying always blessed be
[1:39:06] the name of the Lord
[1:39:08] hmm the name of God here it is they are
[1:39:13] a seal there in in the book of
[1:39:16] Revelation notice now in that same
[1:39:18] chapter revelation 7 I just got a skip
[1:39:20] reveling over of Revelations 14 1 and I
[1:39:23] looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount
[1:39:27] Zion this is after Melinda this is this
[1:39:30] is here you know here we stand in
[1:39:32] mountains there they stand on my design
[1:39:33] this is millennium time right here this
[1:39:35] is after Armageddon you understand God
[1:39:37] already sees this as a finished work and
[1:39:40] I looked and lo a lamb stood on the
[1:39:43] Mount Zion and with him and hundred and
[1:39:46] forty-four thousand having his father's
[1:39:49] name written in their foreheads
[1:39:54] they haven't received his name as of yet
[1:39:57] but they will receive his name what will
[1:40:01] be the receiving of his name the
[1:40:03] receiving of the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:05] Ghost the seal of God because the
[1:40:07] fountain will be open in the house of
[1:40:10] David hallelujah and that cleansing and
[1:40:15] ministry it'll call them Jews to
[1:40:17] repentance brother it'll call them to
[1:40:20] repentance they will repent and be
[1:40:23] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:40:25] they will receive that same Holy Ghost
[1:40:28] that you and I have received and God
[1:40:34] knows each and every one of them he
[1:40:36] knows exactly where they're at and they
[1:40:43] will have their father's name written in
[1:40:46] their foreheads it will not be a red dot
[1:40:51] it will not be a stamp kapuna
[1:40:55] this is symbols I said it's symbols it's
[1:41:01] speaking of they will have the mind of
[1:41:03] Christ
[1:41:04] they will have the seal of God of the
[1:41:07] Living God upon their hearts when the
[1:41:12] nations are coming against them and they
[1:41:14] surround them and they take after him
[1:41:16] rather they'll have a peace in their
[1:41:18] heart what you do that passes all
[1:41:21] understanding hallelu
[1:41:29] and you see receiving the holy ghost
[1:41:33] makes way for them to recognize him when
[1:41:36] he comes to make himself known to his
[1:41:39] brethren that's why the seal of the Holy
[1:41:45] Ghost must be ministered in this time
[1:41:47] because we aren't expecting there's a
[1:41:50] literal Jesus who will come
[1:41:54] [Music]

[1:44:22] another day this is the day amen
[1:44:32] oh yes sir this is what God would tell
[1:44:36] him in Deuteronomy 28 he would tell him
[1:44:40] that the rest of the nations he said I'm
[1:44:42] gonna set you on high above all the rest
[1:44:44] of the nations remember how they get set
[1:44:46] on high by getting low
[1:44:48] they humbled themselves to the Word of
[1:44:50] God and God said in humility there is
[1:44:53] power he said I will lift you up in
[1:44:57] verse 10 and all the people of the earth
[1:44:59] shall see that thou are called by the
[1:45:03] name of the Lord and they shall be
[1:45:07] afraid of thee brother the devil ain't
[1:45:09] afraid of me but he's afraid of the
[1:45:12] Angel of the covenant and we have the
[1:45:17] seal of the angel the Covenant he said
[1:45:20] I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:45:22] know my presence is always with you
[1:45:25] whether so ever thou goest
[1:45:27] do not be dismayed do not be afraid but
[1:45:30] be of a good courage and a good strength
[1:45:36] and they shall see the name of the Lord
[1:45:39] is upon you and shall be afraid I felt
[1:45:53] like just having a little
[1:45:55] [Applause]

[1:46:22] moment but the semi you've been high
[1:46:24] nobody we just want to talk a little bit
[1:46:26] more let's talk about it brother Aaron
[1:46:29] for security it's a security when he
[1:46:38] puts his seal on your life he's letting
[1:46:42] the devil know this is private property
[1:46:46] you once lived here but this ain't your
[1:46:50] house no more let me tell you what the
[1:46:55] Holy Ghost does it does just what
[1:46:57] Nehemiah did in the days of the ruther
[1:46:59] Sabbath that was going on when they
[1:47:01] returned back to Jerusalem they had a
[1:47:02] bunch of people that was wanting to come
[1:47:04] into the city and be selling fish and
[1:47:06] everything else and Nehemiah said I
[1:47:08] don't know none of that stuff going on
[1:47:09] in this city I want you to close the
[1:47:11] gates so they closed the gates and they
[1:47:13] shut the locks the bars the doors
[1:47:15] they did all that brother George then
[1:47:16] they come back around and they came by
[1:47:18] the outside of the wall
[1:47:19] Nehemiah said I'm gonna tell you one
[1:47:20] more time I don't want you in this city
[1:47:22] you're not coming here on the Sabbath
[1:47:23] and don't you be near the city
[1:47:25] if I find you near the city will kill ya
[1:47:29] what's God saying don't you touch don't
[1:47:32] you touch that which I sealed you touch
[1:47:35] and you pepper that what I sealed you
[1:47:37] got me on your hands let me tell you how
[1:47:41] secure this is he let this pass through
[1:47:43] seminaries he'd let this pass through a
[1:47:45] lot of people's hands he let it pass
[1:47:47] through they tried to burn it out they
[1:47:49] tried to burn men they try to do ever
[1:47:51] say but brother you can't kill the Word
[1:47:54] of God
[1:47:55] [Applause]
[1:48:01] they might have put all sorts of things
[1:48:04] on it but brother God has watched over
[1:48:07] his word when men have wanted to auction
[1:48:13] it off for a penny here or for
[1:48:15] immorality there and auction it off but
[1:48:17] the Living God comes around in this hour
[1:48:20] and he takes this promise of God's Word
[1:48:23] he begins to take the rosin bowl of the
[1:48:26] Holy Ghost the predestination of this
[1:48:30] hour and it strikes the court and you
[1:48:32] realize it's priceless it's priceless
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:41] the way it was in the hands of many and
[1:48:46] they were trying to look at it trying to
[1:48:49] read it the devil trying to pry into it
[1:48:52] well Joe here was the word stainer
[1:48:54] staring right in the face
[1:48:55] the words were right there but brother
[1:48:57] and he couldn't get into it he couldn't
[1:49:01] get into it this book the Bible says in
[1:49:03] the Book of Isaiah believe it's Isaiah
[1:49:05] 29 it's like that of a book that you
[1:49:07] deliver to a learned man or to a nun
[1:49:09] word and the unlearned said I can't read
[1:49:10] it
[1:49:10] cuz I'm not learned they delivered the
[1:49:13] book the Bible says into the hands of a
[1:49:14] learned and a learned man said I cannot
[1:49:16] read this book for the words of this
[1:49:18] book are the words of a book that is
[1:49:20] sealed
[1:49:22] he told Daniel in the Book of Daniel
[1:49:25] when Daniel have received their from
[1:49:28] Gabriel he had received that ministry
[1:49:30] from Gabriel that would pertain to the
[1:49:33] restoration of the Jews he told Daniel
[1:49:35] seal it up until the time of the end and
[1:49:38] when it's time when the seal is unfolded
[1:49:41] then understanding will come whether
[1:49:44] there's been a seal upon this book it's
[1:49:47] not a seal of a man it's not a sale of a
[1:49:50] seminary it's the seal of the Living God
[1:49:52] and God said it's sealed up until my
[1:49:55] people that are knighted for it in this
[1:49:58] hour and all day to receive this then
[1:50:03] I will tear the seals home and brother
[1:50:13] Dave when he toured the seals off this
[1:50:15] but the Greg he took the seals off our
[1:50:17] lives now we wonder why we were the odd
[1:50:22] bird wild chicken feed wasn't good
[1:50:30] enough for us something within is
[1:50:34] calling for fresh meat it was a deep
[1:50:37] calling to the deep hey man talking
[1:50:42] about security
[1:50:43] that's how secure the seal of the Holy
[1:50:45] Ghost is upon your life let me just
[1:50:53] refer to it the Bible says in first
[1:50:55] chronicles 16 the Bible says in verse 20
[1:50:58] when they went from nation in a nation
[1:50:59] from one kingdom to another people he
[1:51:02] suffered no man to do them wrong he
[1:51:05] reproved Kings for their sakes saying
[1:51:08] touch not mine anointed and do my
[1:51:11] prophets no harm glory be to God
[1:51:19] it's our assurance it's our protection
[1:51:23] that's what this seal is it is that when
[1:51:26] you go into battle and you're looking at
[1:51:28] a situation David did not look at how
[1:51:31] big the giant was David said he's
[1:51:34] uncircumcised
[1:51:42] David hound the owner gonna pierce that
[1:51:44] on their armor he's uncircumcised David
[1:51:49] knew that the Lord was his shrift the
[1:51:52] Lord is my light I will not be afraid
[1:51:55] no Hosts shall encompass me it des will
[1:51:58] have be confident glory be to God
[1:52:03] hallelujah David looked at that
[1:52:06] Philistine and said he's uncircumcised
[1:52:08] the rest and we're looking at the armor
[1:52:11] they were looking at everything else you
[1:52:12] see sometimes the problem that you're
[1:52:15] looking at in your natural eyes and your
[1:52:18] feelings it's all the armor and the size
[1:52:20] of it
[1:52:21] but if you can only look at it it's an
[1:52:23] uncircumcised philistine that standing
[1:52:26] there and God is on your side the seal
[1:52:35] of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:43] let me just try to bring this part of it
[1:52:46] down to a close I want you to think of
[1:52:51] this the sign of the circumcision was a
[1:52:56] sign that was given personally on the
[1:52:58] eighth day wherein every male child had
[1:53:01] to be taken and circumcised as a
[1:53:04] covenant sign the women were brought
[1:53:10] into the Covenant by the marriage Union
[1:53:13] to the male who had been circumcised
[1:53:18] this is why Christ here he releases his
[1:53:22] own life into you and I that we become
[1:53:26] identified in him in a covenant marriage
[1:53:30] and we are under the circumcision that
[1:53:33] is made without hands it is the Holy
[1:53:36] Ghost that has circumcised our heart to
[1:53:38] lay aside the surplus flesh even know if
[1:53:43] this eternal life is our inheritance
[1:53:45] we've got to be married to the man
[1:53:48] Christ Jesus in order to come into our
[1:53:50] inheritance is that right Boaz had to
[1:53:56] bring in Ruth Simone had to bring in
[1:53:59] Rahab it had to be those of the tribe to
[1:54:02] bring in two daughters of Zelophehad are
[1:54:05] you with me it had to be that to bring
[1:54:08] it in to the inheritance so this sign
[1:54:12] was a sign of confirmation I want you to
[1:54:15] just listen listen to me now here they
[1:54:19] they believe what God had said now even
[1:54:22] though this was a sign in their flesh
[1:54:25] once you think of this now I know I'm in
[1:54:28] a mixed audience but I want you to think
[1:54:29] of this the sign of circumcision was in
[1:54:31] their flesh yet it was hidden to the
[1:54:33] rest of the world they had clothes on is
[1:54:37] that right
[1:54:38] so it was hidden but yet it was evident
[1:54:41] to them
[1:54:44] they're abiding presence of the Lord was
[1:54:47] with them the sign and the seal is not
[1:54:51] so much for everybody else it's for you
[1:54:54] and for me it's that comforting presence
[1:55:02] even when I don't feel it yeah yeah I'm
[1:55:10] getting somewhere it was evident it is
[1:55:16] the same seal of God that comes on the
[1:55:18] circumcision of the heart of the
[1:55:20] believer made without hands it's a
[1:55:22] supernatural power of God that actually
[1:55:24] removes the first nature of the body of
[1:55:26] the sins of the flesh and removes that
[1:55:29] old nature and sets forth the new nature
[1:55:31] by the quickening power of God in the
[1:55:32] soul when that has fully taken place in
[1:55:35] the heart of man by the Holy Ghost the
[1:55:37] person walks with the faith of God you
[1:55:41] realize it is God's faith operating
[1:55:44] through you to believe what he has said
[1:55:47] concerning this power and you and me in
[1:55:50] it hallelujah glory be to God in the
[1:55:54] highest and there are fruits of the
[1:55:57] Spirit in our life we are fully in the
[1:56:00] Covenant the Word of God for our day
[1:56:02] because it's the gospel of our salvation
[1:56:04] the Lord has sealed his message and
[1:56:08] messenger with his seal his presence and
[1:56:11] he seals us by himself placing that seal
[1:56:15] of the Holy Ghost the light of the hour
[1:56:17] the vindicated truth the Living God is
[1:56:20] now living out vindicated truth through
[1:56:23] our lives it is caught hiding and
[1:56:27] revealing himself in simplicity
[1:56:35] it's a security
[1:56:39] the devil can look on that seal but he
[1:56:42] can't come to it brother bream says he
[1:56:45] can tease at it he can buzz at it and
[1:56:50] fuss at it well he ain't gonna remove
[1:56:56] the seal no he's just trying to trouble
[1:56:59] you but he can't get to it because
[1:57:05] there's a seal of God that forbids him
[1:57:07] to touch it it's God's private property
[1:57:09] and that's what makes a man walk boldly
[1:57:12] you understand what I'm saying it is
[1:57:14] that on the inside that the rest of the
[1:57:16] world like the sign of circumcision
[1:57:17] among the Israelites it was not out
[1:57:20] there for everybody else to see but it
[1:57:23] was something that they knew in their
[1:57:26] heart I'm not the same that I used to be
[1:57:28] I know that there is an effect that has
[1:57:32] come to my life the love of the world is
[1:57:37] gone my love is to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:44] the rest of the world they get glimpses
[1:57:47] of it but rather it's important for you
[1:57:49] when you're in battle the devil might
[1:57:54] have come and try to whisper everything
[1:57:56] your way
[1:57:56] there's promises he's tried to take from
[1:57:59] you but you can spend like Shamgar and
[1:58:02] realize you've got a covenant you've got
[1:58:05] a sign of circumcision you've got a seal
[1:58:08] of the Living God that's there you can
[1:58:10] rise up and you can take one promise and
[1:58:13] beat the devil's brains out with it hey
[1:58:16] man Shamgar seen an ox cold it's one
[1:58:19] little itty bitty scripture but brother
[1:58:21] his faith in what God had confirmed in
[1:58:24] his life he knew even though I don't
[1:58:27] feel his presence but I know that I've
[1:58:29] been anointed by God I am an Israelite I
[1:58:33] am a son of Abraham I am a child of
[1:58:36] Abraham and the promises belong to me
[1:58:38] you're outnumbered Shamgar but there's
[1:58:41] more with me
[1:58:43] then there is against me because if God
[1:58:46] be for us who can be against us is that
[1:58:55] right brother Ram comes running around
[1:59:01] right after he preaches is it's the
[1:59:04] rising of the Sun now after I've done
[1:59:09] all that apologizing I certainly don't
[1:59:13] want to go ahead and do a replay and
[1:59:15] keep you another two hours but I'm
[1:59:17] coming down
[1:59:23] you're sealed unto the day of redemption
[1:59:28] sometimes it's a shaky ride these
[1:59:33] incoming look like that car will
[1:59:39] ever make it sealed yet yes from
[1:59:45] eternity to eternity
[1:59:49] whose names on the line whose names on
[1:59:52] the seal he got the Lord God on money by
[2:00:05] coming down and imparting his own life
[2:00:09] into you and hi brother it is the
[2:00:11] strength of the RAM that has now been
[2:00:14] inter woven in our lives like the RAM
[2:00:17] that was caught in the thicket there it
[2:00:20] is that Rama
[2:00:21] how we gonna make it out of here by the
[2:00:22] Rama how am I gonna overcome battle
[2:00:25] realm

[2:01:16] Zion it's the final showdown to the
[2:01:18] rapture we receive the kingdom which
[2:01:22] cannot be moved here is 12
[2:01:24] everything else is being shaken it's
[2:01:26] shaken but brother he has packed himself
[2:01:30] into you and I it is him that is holding
[2:01:34] you and I you might feel like you're
[2:01:36] gonna come to pieces but remember
[2:01:38] you have been pied back in to the mind
[2:01:41] of God the seal of God ties you back in
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:49] and let me tell you the words that was
[2:01:53] spoke right after it is the rising of
[2:01:55] the Sun he said now oh boy I don't feel
[2:02:00] bad now he said I apologize for that
[2:02:02] long message but I said I wanted to get
[2:02:07] that message true that you're part of
[2:02:09] this resurrection and don't you worry
[2:02:12] about it no more just rejoice over it
[2:02:16] there is nothing nowhere can separate
[2:02:20] you from it
[2:02:21] nothing eternally secured in the kingdom
[2:02:24] of God when God has stamped his seal
[2:02:27] upon you you're to the end of your
[2:02:30] destination
[2:02:31] he said when that government puts a seal
[2:02:33] upon a package the railroad puts a seal
[2:02:36] on the door that car cannot be tampered
[2:02:38] with until it's reached its destination
[2:02:40] when God puts his seal upon a man and
[2:02:43] that seal is the Holy Ghost when he
[2:02:46] seals a man like that he's gone to his
[2:02:49] eternal destination never no more can he
[2:02:52] ever come back any more
[2:02:55] he quotes the food Ephesians 4:30 yes
[2:03:00] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God we're
[2:03:02] about your seal for all times
[2:03:05] he said now listen now the devil will
[2:03:11] punch at you and he'll say everything to
[2:03:15] you and accuse you and try to make you
[2:03:20] think that you're not but don't you
[2:03:24] listen to him
[2:03:26] [Applause]
[2:03:31] how am I gonna believe that we're better
[2:03:35] Samuel the devil telling me you know he
[2:03:37] said why are you leaving arguing with a
[2:03:39] defeated being he's a liar you
[2:03:47] understand where you're standing right
[2:03:48] now you've got a seal a sign a
[2:03:52] circumcision that's greater than even
[2:03:55] what they had in their flesh it has come
[2:03:58] to your soul and you know you have
[2:04:01] passed from death unto life
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:06] can I keep reading thank you I'm gonna
[2:04:11] keep reading this same quote he said but
[2:04:14] don't you listen to him you know you
[2:04:16] passed from death unto life you know the
[2:04:19] things that you once loved you don't
[2:04:21] love it no more you know you believed
[2:04:23] every word of God you've seen God
[2:04:25] working right among us infallible proofs
[2:04:27] that he is the great I am oh my he goes
[2:04:31] on in the message desperations after he
[2:04:34] has preached the message the token and
[2:04:36] it goes on and he says now he said
[2:04:38] without this token remember what the
[2:04:40] token is it is the life of Jesus Christ
[2:04:43] reproduced inside the believer
[2:04:48] hallelujah
[2:04:50] haha man oh man oh man I pray that the
[2:04:54] preaching of this word right here if you
[2:04:55] don't have that seal of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:57] I pray you so hungry for it I pray you
[2:05:00] say you know what I want that I need
[2:05:02] that brother and sister let me tell you
[2:05:05] without the seal of God you're not going
[2:05:07] in the rapture if you're not born again
[2:05:10] you're not going in the rapture and if
[2:05:13] you sit here in these services where the
[2:05:15] inspector is inspecting your life you
[2:05:18] say I felt the presence of God but let
[2:05:20] me tell you something if a tree falls
[2:05:22] over in the water it when it stands in
[2:05:25] the ground it's such water up and it's
[2:05:27] benefited but if that tree lays in the
[2:05:30] water the same water that could produce
[2:05:32] and Minister's strength to it will
[2:05:34] actually cause it to rot
[2:05:38] that's why the Bible could say in
[2:05:40] Hebrews four do not do this spot to the
[2:05:43] spirit of grace the inspector coming
[2:05:45] around and dealing with your heart upon
[2:05:47] this and saying hey you're a little
[2:05:48] loose on this and hey on this and hound
[2:05:50] that it's time to be serious the Bible
[2:05:52] calls it diligence with the things of
[2:05:55] God is to be diligent when the Holy
[2:05:57] Ghost is speaking to you and I because
[2:05:59] let me tell you something to turn it
[2:06:00] down and to reject it is to be a
[2:06:02] sentence to hell strong language but
[2:06:07] it's the truth
[2:06:08] you say I believe in God them it updates
[2:06:10] you on the scripture the Bible says in
[2:06:12] the book of James that death will be
[2:06:14] leaves and he trembles it's got to be
[2:06:17] more than just believing in God come on
[2:06:21] somebody that's what's the matter with
[2:06:24] this whole world it's Satan's religion
[2:06:30] live any way you want to live do
[2:06:32] whatever you want to do as long as you
[2:06:34] love God that is a delusion this world
[2:06:40] is under the spirit of a delusion
[2:06:43] because they received not the love of
[2:06:45] the truth and the love of the truth
[2:06:47] first asourian's to the love of the
[2:06:50] truth is the Holy Ghost the person of
[2:06:53] Jesus Christ you can't say you love God
[2:06:57] and then reject his word when you reject
[2:07:01] his word God marks you as an enemy you
[2:07:08] don't have to be that this morning let
[2:07:10] me just tell you something
[2:07:11] the blood of Jesus can do for you what
[2:07:13] the blood of Abel could not do for Cain
[2:07:15] the blood of Abel could never take Cain
[2:07:17] and transform him but the blood of Jesus
[2:07:21] can take you old Cain come on I'm
[2:07:23] quoting the words from the message token
[2:07:25] he can take an old Cain because remember
[2:07:27] yeah he'll now outside is the King but
[2:07:29] on the inside is enabled and that Abel
[2:07:32] is Abel when Abel comes into it when the
[2:07:34] Holy Ghost comes on the inside then I am
[2:07:36] able I can do all things through Christ
[2:07:39] which strengthens me Abel is a
[2:07:43] [Applause]
[2:07:48] this old king this old sticky thing but
[2:07:52] they Gable on the inside says I've
[2:07:54] received the ability
[2:07:57] Amen I have come face-to-face with him
[2:07:59] like John did on the Isle of Patmos and
[2:08:02] love courage and ability has been
[2:08:04] ministered unto me I have seen his face
[2:08:07] his presence personally and I have been
[2:08:10] identified with him I am yoked with him
[2:08:13] and I believe that he is the performer
[2:08:18] of what he said gotta have that token
[2:08:25] you know when you go on an airline show
[2:08:30] up at the gate how many non talked about
[2:08:35] you flew somewhere before I don't care
[2:08:39] how much money there

[2:08:44] to the gate they ain't dealing with that
[2:08:47] they want to know do you got the token
[2:08:54] well you know I'm just waiting don't be
[2:08:56] on standby
[2:09:04] you see here on standby just ruling
[2:09:05] pretty soon you'll be singing now what
[2:09:08] am I gonna do that the church is gone
[2:09:10] and I'm left sitting all alone don't be
[2:09:15] there like that take the grace of God
[2:09:19] God's grace and mercy to minister
[2:09:24] brother BAM after he talks about this
[2:09:26] token in the opening part of desperation
[2:09:31] he said now he says once that blood is
[2:09:35] applied to you and you're accepted oh my
[2:09:38] he says now now not just to know certain
[2:09:42] evidence you say brother Branham he said
[2:09:45] I feel it in your minds
[2:09:48] why will I know in other words how will
[2:09:51] I know he said look what were you and
[2:09:57] what are you
[2:10:01] you with me look to you it's a sign
[2:10:05] sometimes it's a whole lot easier for
[2:10:07] other people to look at you and they see
[2:10:10] the change in your life let me tell you
[2:10:12] something you don't go by reasoning you
[2:10:15] go by this sign that he's put on brother
[2:10:18] he didn't put that seal on your
[2:10:19] reasoning he put it on your soul look
[2:10:22] what you were and what you are there is
[2:10:25] how you know what was you before this
[2:10:28] token was applied what are you after
[2:10:30] it's applied
[2:10:31] what was your desires before and what is
[2:10:35] your desires after then you know whether
[2:10:39] the tokens applied and all these other
[2:10:42] things well they just go automatically
[2:10:44] with it it's the seal of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:51] the scripture said don't grieve it
[2:10:55] we've grieved it
[2:10:57] no dream would say it like this he said
[2:11:01] I want to be so sensitive
[2:11:03] till I will know the least little thing
[2:11:07] that displeases him
[2:11:15] but remember when he's grieved that
[2:11:18] little Dell flies up on the rafter
[2:11:20] but all that you have to do is become a
[2:11:22] lamb again in the death comes right back
[2:11:27] sometimes you know you might get all
[2:11:29] vexed and tied up with the situation
[2:11:32] frustrated
[2:11:34] you might feel you've got a right to be
[2:11:36] and maybe you do but that little devil
[2:11:40] on the inside says
[2:11:46] aren't you glad he let you know
[2:11:50] you said but there on the dam if there's
[2:11:52] something on the inside you know you
[2:11:53] ain't gonna argue it away but it's
[2:11:57] something inside you said Lord forgive
[2:11:59] me forgive me Lord
[2:12:04] a man like David would say create in me
[2:12:08] a right spirit Lord let me tell you what
[2:12:12] the real seal of God does you recognize
[2:12:14] that there is a fountain filled with
[2:12:16] blood you know that there's a washing of
[2:12:20] water by the word and you realize that
[2:12:24] there is that Laver that is set for you
[2:12:26] in the house of God with running water
[2:12:28] it comes out the bottom it's running
[2:12:31] water where you can wash your hands
[2:12:35] your doings and you can wash your feet
[2:12:38] your goings sometimes it's not even you
[2:12:41] need to be washed because of something
[2:12:43] you've done or you've said sometimes
[2:12:46] you've just been in situations that you
[2:12:48] just feel dirty because of where you've
[2:12:49] been
[2:12:50] if I know I'm talking about but thank
[2:12:54] God there is a Laver you can go and say
[2:12:56] Lord Jesus
[2:12:57] cleanse me the Lord cleanse me Lord and
[2:13:01] you washing your feet right there what
[2:13:03] are you getting ready for you're getting
[2:13:04] ready to enter into worship because your
[2:13:08] whole desire is to please him oh how
[2:13:15] much greater is this sealing than what
[2:13:18] they had received in their flesh this
[2:13:21] seal of God upon our heart our soul it's
[2:13:26] something that it remains right there
[2:13:29] that we know we have passed from death
[2:13:31] unto life I'm not who I used to be I
[2:13:35] didn't change my life he changed my life
[2:13:38] you understand me now
[2:13:40] you can sit down I just feel to go with
[2:13:42] this you're not Center and look at it
[2:13:44] and maybe it'd be like sister Bruce
[2:13:45] where sister Bruce said brother branham
[2:13:47] hi I don't have like a a certain place I
[2:13:50] can put my foot that I've received the
[2:13:52] Holy Ghost and brother banner takes her
[2:13:53] right to the word and he said sister
[2:13:55] Bruce he said normally he said a person
[2:13:58] would be just like this and he goes
[2:13:59] through he says but you're not he says
[2:14:02] what happened well what changed you she
[2:14:05] said Christ he said there it is you see
[2:14:08] you want your foot upon the word of God
[2:14:11] so your foot stands right there first
[2:14:15] one person it might take one person and
[2:14:18] they go through on their journey and
[2:14:20] this person here it is like in a moment
[2:14:22] of time God comes down and does
[2:14:24] everything right then and there but
[2:14:27] brother it is the same experience you
[2:14:30] are passing from death unto life and how
[2:14:35] you know is by the seal in your soul
[2:14:40] and that seal in the soul is his name
[2:14:46] it's the name of Jesus Christ hmm that
[2:14:53] is just like evening there just like him
[2:14:56] mm-hmm because it's the family name
[2:14:59] jesus said I've come in my father's name
[2:15:02] and we have come in our father's name we
[2:15:07] have come felt in the name of the Word
[2:15:09] of God he said his name is called the
[2:15:13] Word of God he said in John 14 he will
[2:15:15] send the Holy Ghost in my name we are
[2:15:19] brought forth by the manifestation of
[2:15:21] Jesus Christ his children do you love
[2:15:25] him
[2:15:26] I pray this morning you'll stand like
[2:15:29] Shamgar stand like David and I pray this
[2:15:32] morning if you don't have that I pray
[2:15:35] that you'll just stand still within your
[2:15:38] heart and say I'm the son of Abraham I'm
[2:15:41] a daughter of Abraham and I claim that
[2:15:44] promise these are the rights and the
[2:15:47] inheritance that's being ministered to
[2:15:50] me it belongs to me as a children of God
[2:15:54] I believe that it is for me I believe
[2:15:57] that I am justified in the sight of
[2:16:01] Almighty God I believe that he rose from
[2:16:03] the grave I believe that he died for my
[2:16:06] sins rose again on the third day he is
[2:16:09] my Savior here's my Sanctifier he is my
[2:16:12] redeemer he is my all and all turn your
[2:16:19] eyes upon Jesus when Satan wants to try
[2:16:24] to get you put your eyes and turn your
[2:16:25] eyes on Jesus the Prophet said that
[2:16:29] right there in that quote look at what
[2:16:31] you were
[2:16:33] look at what you are now you know it's
[2:16:35] important look at where you were look at
[2:16:38] where you are I've never seen a tree
[2:16:44] growing in your yard a bush or something
[2:16:47] when you're out there you don't go and
[2:16:50] look at it and say honey it grew a
[2:16:52] millimeter today but what you do is you
[2:16:56] keep watering it you keep nurturing it
[2:17:01] you clip back blooms or whatever has to
[2:17:04] be clipped back at a certain time and
[2:17:05] you keep nurturing you caught you
[2:17:08] cultivate the soil around it
[2:17:10] you take a picture of that then you come
[2:17:15] again next year come again the year
[2:17:18] after that then you look at what you see
[2:17:21] there compared to what you've come from
[2:17:26] you're looking at it everyday you don't
[2:17:28] see growth but you give some little
[2:17:30] distance you can look and say I look
[2:17:34] what I was but I look at what I am now
[2:17:37] this is what I am this is why God would
[2:17:41] tell them in the book of Deuteronomy
[2:17:43] remember remember don't you love him
[2:17:50] let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[2:17:53] or Jesus
[2:17:56] you're the same God this morning father
[2:18:01] you're the one Lord who inspects us
[2:18:04] you're the one Lord who seals us and
[2:18:07] Lord we just pray this morning that how
[2:18:11] you have sent your word and what I I
[2:18:14] tried to minister it Lord I never just
[2:18:17] in anything I never want anything to be
[2:18:19] complicated Lord wanted to be simple
[2:18:23] Lord I know that it takes you as simple
[2:18:26] as I could try to be but yet it takes it
[2:18:29] takes you Lord to break it to our hearts
[2:18:31] Lord I pray but out of it all Lord God
[2:18:36] if there's none a heart Lord that has
[2:18:40] been sealed I pray God that they would
[2:18:42] be so so hungry
[2:18:45] may they be so thirsty may they not rest
[2:18:48] day or night until Lord God they've
[2:18:52] received that satisfying portion and may
[2:18:55] they Lord believe recognize it's for him
[2:19:00] may they recognize you desire to give it
[2:19:03] to a more than they would desire to
[2:19:05] receive
[2:19:07] lord
[2:19:09] in faith we want to believe to receive
[2:19:12] it to act upon that word
[2:19:19] Lord I pray
[2:19:23] reach life that's here
[2:19:26] I know Lord I'm speaking to lives as
[2:19:29] well
[2:19:30] the God that
[2:19:32] has been sealed by the Holy Spirit
[2:19:38] pass from death unto life
[2:19:43] god they have that sign that seal on the
[2:19:47] inside of their soul
[2:19:51] lord
[2:19:53] like every one of us Lord at times we
[2:19:56] say it shamefully we've grieved you
[2:19:59] there's been things Lord even how your
[2:20:02] prophet would he would tell us this and
[2:20:04] we experienced it that God he would even
[2:20:08] tell us in the simplicity to where when
[2:20:10] you even get a thought
[2:20:13] a thought about getting even a fault not
[2:20:17] even saying anything then you entertain
[2:20:19] that foggy said the Dove takes flight
[2:20:22] lordy would let us know that even our
[2:20:24] thinking let alone our words Lord I pray
[2:20:29] this morning if there's any any faults
[2:20:34] Bible says as a man thinketh in his
[2:20:36] heart Lord if there be any faults that's
[2:20:40] contrary to the nature of God in our
[2:20:43] soul what I I ask what God that is your
[2:20:47] conviction of the holy spirit and we
[2:20:49] thank you for that conviction Lord I
[2:20:53] pray God that is every heart is sincere
[2:20:57] Lord God would call sin sin that you
[2:21:01] call CN Lord and stand upon that word
[2:21:05] say Lord forgive me Lord cleanse me
[2:21:11] forgive me Lord for taking that attitude
[2:21:13] or that falter speaking sharply that way
[2:21:18] Oh Lord granted I pray may you just move
[2:21:23] Lord upon that heart god you're so
[2:21:28] merciful you would tell us to grieve not
[2:21:33] that Holy Spirit of promise nor the
[2:21:36] desire that pulsates within our heart we
[2:21:38] want to please you help us Lord
[2:21:41] no wonder Jude would tell us keep
[2:21:44] yourselves in the love of God praying in
[2:21:46] the Holy Ghost Lord God
[2:21:50] we need a continual renewal we need a
[2:21:54] fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost a
[2:21:58] renewing Lord God and I pray Heavenly
[2:22:03] Father may this morning God every heart
[2:22:09] just just be open Lord to receive that
[2:22:11] Lord if there's one that God would fill
[2:22:14] on their heart Lord to come in to pray
[2:22:16] here Lord
[2:22:17] I know that God you could done the work
[2:22:19] right there in the seat and I just
[2:22:22] relieve it in your hands because Lord we
[2:22:24] know whether they're in their seat or
[2:22:25] whether they come here to the altar they
[2:22:28] their faith has got to be in you Lord
[2:22:31] whether it's for healing whether it's
[2:22:33] for deliverance whether the Lord God is
[2:22:35] for the Holy Ghost the Lord I believe
[2:22:38] this morning that while we have the
[2:22:41] devil on the run I believe God it's time
[2:22:45] to take care of business so Lord may
[2:22:49] there not be one heart that's left
[2:22:51] outside of him under the blood may every
[2:22:54] life what I pray be drawn to you Lord in
[2:22:57] the simplicity and may God the hearts
[2:23:00] that Lord have been focused on the
[2:23:04] devil's teasing his buzzing is fussing
[2:23:07] at the ceiling I pray God that they
[2:23:11] recognize that they're not standing on
[2:23:13] their reason but may they stand up this
[2:23:16] morning in their heart
[2:23:18] like Shamgar stew that moment may they
[2:23:22] take that ox gold and their God may they
[2:23:26] drive back that devil nor they've been
[2:23:29] trying to torment their mind and their
[2:23:32] spirit Lord in trouble
[2:23:33] granite Lord God for their anointed Lord
[2:23:36] with your Holy Spirit Lord chase back
[2:23:41] Lord God the enemy try him out under
