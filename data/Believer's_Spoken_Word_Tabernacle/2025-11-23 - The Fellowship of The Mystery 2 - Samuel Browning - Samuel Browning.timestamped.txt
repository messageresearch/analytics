[25:29] No peace within.
[25:38] Oh, chains
[25:41] could not hold me.
[25:44] Confused and so lonely.
[25:48] Oh, yes.
[25:51] So shackled with sin.
[25:59] Oh, but who
[26:02] is that coming
[26:04] from the other side
[26:07] of the sea?
[26:10] His eyes of
[26:13] compassion.
[26:15] They're piercing
[26:17] through me.
[26:23] Oh legion,
[26:25] you've had me bound.
[26:28] for
[26:30] so long.
[26:33] But my morning

[27:34] no peace within.
[27:42] I was the talk of
[27:45] conversation
[27:48] for my multiple
[27:51] relations.
[27:55] So shackled with sin.
[28:02] Hallelujah. But then
[28:07] noon day
[28:08] when the sun was
[28:11] burning down, I hid my face from
[28:17] embarrassment
[28:19] for my lifestyle.
[28:22] No bound.
[28:27] But there was
[28:29] Messiah
[28:32] sitting on
[28:34] the well.
[28:37] Our story
[28:40] of life.
[28:42] He began
[28:45] to tell.

[29:41] Oh,
[29:43] sweet Jesus.
[29:48] Hallelujah.
[29:50] Amen.
[29:52] Sing this as our pastor comes. Amen.
[29:54] Holy Spirit, rain down.
[30:00] Holy Spirit, rain
[30:04] down.
[30:08] Rain
[30:11] down.
[30:14] Oh comforter
[30:17] and friend,
[30:20] how I need your touch
[30:24] again.
[30:26] Holy Spirit, rain
[30:31] down.
[30:34] Rain
[30:37] down.
[30:40] Let your power fall. Let your voice be
[30:45] heard. Come and change our hearts as we
[30:51] stand on your word. Holy Spirit,
[31:00] rain now. Amen. I come with an
[31:03] expectation this morning. I believe God
[31:05] can do more than we could even dream. No
[31:08] eye has seen,
[31:11] no ear has heard,
[31:14] no mind can know
[31:17] what God has in store.
[31:20] So open up heaven.
[31:24] Open it wide
[31:27] over your church
[31:30] and over our lives. Holy Spirit
[31:39] rain down.
[31:43] Yes Lord.
[31:45] Holy Spirit rain
[31:50] down.
[31:53] Rain
[31:56] down.
[31:59] Oh,
[32:03] and friend,
[32:06] how we need your touch
[32:09] again.
[32:11] Holy Spirit, rain,
[32:16] rain now.
[32:20] Rain
[32:23] down.
[32:25] Let your power fall. Let your voice be
[32:30] heard. Come and change our hearts as we
[32:36] stand on your word. Holy Spirit,
[32:45] pray now.
[32:52] Because of who you are, I give you
[32:58] glory.
[33:02] Hallelujah. It's not me, it's him.
[33:05] Because of who you are,
[33:09] I give you
[33:11] praise
[33:17] because of who you are.
[33:22] I will lift my voice and say,
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I worship you
[33:31] because Jesus
[33:34] you are,
[33:39] Lord. I worship you
[33:43] because of who. Let's all stand
[33:46] together. Sing that first part again.
[33:48] Because of who you are, Lord, this
[33:50] morning I give you glory. Because of who
[33:54] you are, I give you glory.
[34:02] Amen.
[34:04] because
[34:06] you are. I give you praise
[34:15] because of who you are.
[34:20] I will lift my voice and say
[34:25] I worship you
[34:28] because of who you are.
[34:35] For I worship you
[34:39] because of who you. Amen. What is he to
[34:43] you this morning? Oh Jehovah
[34:47] Gyra.
[34:49] Amen.
[34:51] My pro.
[34:54] Hallelujah.
[34:56] Hallelujah.
[34:58] Receive.
[35:00] Yes Lord you reign in victory
[35:06] to hold a shadow.
[35:11] Lord my prince of peace.
[35:16] Lord I worship you
[35:20] because of who you are.
[35:25] Oh Lord.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[35:28] &gt;&gt; I worship you because of who you are.
[35:33] What is he this morning? My provider
[35:36] Jehovah.
[35:44] I don't know whether I'm going to use
[35:45] slides or
[35:52] &gt;&gt; you reign in victory
[36:02] prince of peace.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, I worship you because of who you
[36:11] are.
[36:15] Lord, I worship you
[36:19] because of who you are.
[36:25] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[36:31] are.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. He certainly is
[36:39] worthy, isn't he?
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we could certainly never never
[36:45] give him enough praise, amen, for what
[36:48] he's done for us. But I'm thankful that
[36:51] our praise is not confined to what would
[36:53] just come out of our lips
[36:55] &gt;&gt; or even how our hands would be raised.
[36:57] But what a blessing it is that from our
[37:00] soul.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; That's real. That's real worship right
[37:04] there.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Where we can live as sons and daughters
[37:08] of God with a real true liberty in our
[37:10] lives. That's real worship.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Each and every day of our lives is
[37:16] living. Amen. Living for him. And you
[37:20] know, it's not a chore. It's a
[37:22] privilege.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; When God has touched your heart and so
[37:26] changed your life, it's the greatest
[37:28] privilege and greatest honor that we
[37:30] could ever have to be able to serve him.
[37:34] You know, I think of it here this
[37:37] morning.
[37:39] You know, you think about coming to the
[37:40] house of God and it's not something we
[37:43] have to do. We have the privilege.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is to be able to
[37:50] come here this morning. Privilege to be
[37:52] able to gather in his presence. Amen. To
[37:56] just see what the Lord would say and
[37:59] speak to our hearts here this morning.
[38:02] Amen. He's done so much for us. How
[38:04] could we thank him?
[38:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, he did. He He did for me what no
[38:10] one else could do.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; A church couldn't do it.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; But God, rich in mercy.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Changed
[38:22] &gt;&gt; changed my life.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Changed my nature.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't what I stopped doing. It's the
[38:28] Holy Spirit came. God working with our
[38:31] life little by little by little. That's
[38:33] right.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. cleaning our lives up, the blood
[38:36] being applied, and then the spirit of
[38:38] God coming and moving right in there.
[38:40] What a what a privilege, friends. What a
[38:43] reality. What a what a certainty it
[38:45] brings in our hearts. We certainly are
[38:48] just so grateful to be here uh this
[38:51] morning and so thankful to have brother
[38:54] Ivonne and Sister Linda here with us.
[38:56] And uh Amen.
[39:01] Well, it's just always like family.
[39:05] Amen. So, we we sure love you all so
[39:08] much. And and uh it's just good to be
[39:10] gathered together. Amen. And his
[39:12] presence and um so we want to if we
[39:16] could let's just go to him in a word of
[39:18] prayer. I think I'm so thankful for the
[39:20] musicians and brother Brian, thank you
[39:23] for this the songs of Zion. Amen. And
[39:26] your worship, the atmosphere that's been
[39:28] created. Amen. And let's just go before
[39:30] him in a word of prayer.
[39:33] Heavenly Father,
[39:35] Lord, as we are standing
[39:38] in absolute need of your mercies here
[39:40] this morning.
[39:43] What can we do
[39:45] without you, Lord? We can do nothing.
[39:49] Father, we are totally
[39:52] totally helpless without you, Father.
[39:56] That's right.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, how we're we're trusting
[40:00] you, Lord, here this morning one more
[40:02] time that Lord, that you would come,
[40:05] Lord, for there's no speaker that we
[40:08] want to hear
[40:10] but the spirit of truth. Lord, we want
[40:13] to hear from you this morning, Lord. We
[40:16] desire, oh God, that you would come and
[40:19] speak to our lives, Lord, in such a
[40:21] special way. Lord, help us and give us
[40:24] grace, Lord, not only myself, but this
[40:27] congregation, Lord, to be able to step
[40:30] aside for a few moments and to enter in,
[40:33] oh God, into places, Lord God, in
[40:36] heavenly places. And may, Lord, you come
[40:39] and make known, Lord, our where we are,
[40:43] Lord, even in our lives. And Lord, the
[40:45] things that Lord in our lives that oh
[40:48] God that might be hindrances, Lord, but
[40:51] Father, you're here to minister to our
[40:53] lives, Lord, for there's a desire within
[40:56] our lives that you've placed there. We
[40:59] want to be a free channel, Lord God. A
[41:02] channel that's available, Lord God, to
[41:04] you that you're able to just move
[41:06] through and flow through and manifest
[41:08] your life through, Lord. So I pray Lord
[41:11] here this morning. Oh God, may you just
[41:14] move and flow through our lives this
[41:16] morning. Lord, speak to our hearts,
[41:18] Lord. Oh God, if you don't speak to us,
[41:21] Lord, oh God, how could we know where
[41:24] we're standing, Lord God? But Father,
[41:26] our desire as we've come as sons and
[41:29] daughters of God, Lord Jesus, is that
[41:31] our lives would be examined, Lord, by
[41:34] you and in your presence. We ask that
[41:36] you would come in a special way here
[41:38] this morning. Help us, Lord God.
[41:40] Minister to those that are sick among
[41:42] us, Lord. Those that are not able to be
[41:44] here, Father, this morning, Lord. I pray
[41:47] that God, may you minister to their
[41:49] lives, Lord. Oh, God. May you come this
[41:52] morning. May, Lord, the great, Lord,
[41:54] conviction of the Holy Spirit strike,
[41:57] Lord, into hearts and lives, Lord. And
[41:59] may we see only Jesus. May we see you
[42:03] high and lifted up, Lord God, above
[42:05] every need, above every situation, above
[42:08] every, Lord God, every bit of unbelief.
[42:11] May we see Jesus, Lord. I pray, God, may
[42:14] you come to be exalted, Lord. If there's
[42:16] one life that you've not, Lord, taken
[42:19] that place in, Lord. May you be exalted
[42:21] this morning. May the spirit of God
[42:23] move, Lord. The blood be applied and the
[42:26] spirit of God follow. Lord, we pray.
[42:29] Lord God, we give ourselves to you now,
[42:31] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[42:35] Amen.
[42:38] Amen. Amen.
[42:42] Amen.
[42:48] Amen.
[42:52] Let's go to um Ephesians chapter 3.
[43:12] And I want to read just um a few verses
[43:16] of scripture here
[43:21] from Ephesians 3 and verse verse eight.
[43:24] If we could begin there.
[43:30] And unto me am less than the least of
[43:34] all saints is this grace given that I
[43:38] should preach among the Gentiles the
[43:41] uncarchable riches of Christ. and to
[43:44] make all men see what is the fellowship
[43:49] of the mystery which from the beginning
[43:52] of the world hath been hid in God who
[43:55] created all things by Jesus Christ to
[44:00] the intent that now unto the
[44:02] principalities and powers in heavenly
[44:05] places might be known by the church the
[44:09] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[44:13] eternal purpose purpose which he
[44:15] purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in
[44:19] whom we have boldness and access with
[44:23] confidence by the faith
[44:26] &gt;&gt; of him.
[44:28] Amen. May God bless you as you're being
[44:31] seated. And Amen. If we I want to
[44:35] continue to look at that. And I told
[44:36] Brother Brian, I've I actually have all
[44:39] my slides and stuff that's created, but
[44:41] I really just even as I stood here just
[44:43] kind of feeling pulled in a couple
[44:44] directions. So,
[44:49] when we're looking at it um here this
[44:51] morning as you just I think my mom they
[44:54] put the request in for her and um I got
[44:57] a call from her this morning her
[44:58] basement and with water and I didn't
[45:01] know what I was walking into and um but
[45:04] it was the water heater and some of
[45:05] y'all know what that's like and um so um
[45:08] God gave us grace and we were able to
[45:11] get that cleaned up and and uh able to
[45:14] get our tie on and get here.
[45:17] It's kind of hard to say I'm not coming
[45:19] cuz I cleaned up a basement. I'm the
[45:20] pastor.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; But uh uh but God was so merciful and
[45:26] I'm thankful to the Lord that he um
[45:29] just, you know, watched over everything
[45:30] and and and made a way. But I want to
[45:33] just um to speak on this and I ask you
[45:36] to just to pray for me. I know you do.
[45:39] And uh ask the Lord will just give me uh
[45:41] strength here in my body. I want to um
[45:44] just speak a little bit on this thought
[45:46] on the fellowship of of the mystery and
[45:50] recognizing that the mystery itself is
[45:53] dealing with actually our our part in
[45:56] the body of Jesus Christ where that this
[45:59] mystery is actually the indwelling of
[46:02] the Holy Spirit in the life of of a
[46:05] believer. And so we understand there's a
[46:08] there's a great difference from being um
[46:12] just around where it's at, which that's
[46:14] very important. You've got to be around
[46:16] where it's at. Got to hear the actual
[46:19] the truth of the hour that God has
[46:21] given. But within where he's at, that
[46:24] must come to where now he moves on the
[46:27] inside. And so this is all through, we
[46:30] understand, right, through a process.
[46:33] And God will always deal with and work
[46:35] with this according to the word. So
[46:37] God's God's desire is is that we would
[46:39] have our place within the body of Jesus
[46:43] Christ. And we know that that was given
[46:45] to us before the foundation of the
[46:47] world. Our inheritance, our part um that
[46:50] the through and by the sacrificial
[46:52] offering of the Lord Jesus Christ, he
[46:55] has become our way into that um our
[46:59] place of inheritance that we would have
[47:02] in the very economy of Almighty God. and
[47:05] to see I want to just go right into the
[47:07] scriptures here how that Paul would then
[47:10] uh or Peter would take up in second
[47:12] Peter and he would make known to us in
[47:15] second Peter chapter 1 regarding that
[47:18] we've not followed cunningly devised
[47:21] fables and then he would say in verse 19
[47:23] we have a more sure word of prophecy
[47:27] where unto you do well that you take
[47:29] heed as unto a light that shineth in a
[47:33] dark place until the day dawn and the
[47:36] day star arise in your heart. So as as
[47:40] Peter is is writing this that that
[47:42] taking heed to the light of God's word
[47:45] that has come to illuminate our pathway,
[47:48] you can think about this that when
[47:50] you've ever been in a dark place, it is
[47:53] through a light that is shining that
[47:55] allows you to see your way around. And
[47:58] when the light of God has come through
[48:00] and by his word, it not only shows you
[48:03] where you are, it shows you where you
[48:05] need to be and it shows you how to get
[48:08] there. So we we understand that we just
[48:11] don't want to have just a focus just
[48:13] upon the light, but what is the light
[48:15] leading us to do? And actually the light
[48:19] is leading us to a place to where that
[48:21] that light might tabernacle on the
[48:24] inside of us. So when we see this, it
[48:27] says it's good that we would take heed
[48:29] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[48:32] place until the day dawn and the day
[48:36] star arise in your heart. So we don't
[48:38] want to ever take anything for granted.
[48:41] We stay with the word until we and the
[48:44] word have become one. Until the nature
[48:47] has been changed, your life has been
[48:50] changed. Not just your thinking, not
[48:52] just even wantto's have left, but where
[48:55] your very desire and nature has been
[48:59] changed by the Holy Spirit. And then
[49:01] that's where the day star has rose in
[49:04] your life. So notice he says this first
[49:08] that no prophecy of the scripture is of
[49:11] any private interpretation. For the
[49:14] prophecy came not in old time by the
[49:16] will of man, but holy men of God spake
[49:21] as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[49:24] Now, we know we're living in a day, it's
[49:27] a day of confusion.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; If if there's ever been a day of
[49:30] confusion, this is the day we're talking
[49:33] about where it's a day where, like the
[49:35] Bible says in the book of Isaiah, where
[49:37] you have evil is called good and good is
[49:40] called evil. It's a day where absolutes
[49:42] are despised. It It is a day where such
[49:46] confusion where men don't know if
[49:48] they're men or women or whatever. And
[49:50] that's spirits that's upon the people.
[49:53] Now, I'm going to tell you how those
[49:54] spirits got in there. Those spirits got
[49:56] in there because of the teaching of that
[49:58] church. because her religion
[50:01] because remember what she is. She has
[50:04] become a cage of every uh unclean and
[50:09] hateful bird.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; And this is why that for the church of
[50:13] the living God, we believe that God
[50:16] loves the sinner, but he hates the sin.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; You come as you are, but the real
[50:21] reality is you're not going to be able
[50:23] to stay as you are. I if you try to hold
[50:26] on to that old life, the spirit of God
[50:29] will call that out. He will rebuke that
[50:32] and then eventually GOD'S GOING TO MOVE
[50:34] ON BECAUSE YOU ARE GIVEN ONLY so many
[50:37] opportunities and so many chances.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? BECAUSE THE RAPTURE
[50:43] IS NOT GOING TO BE A STRIPPING AWAY OF
[50:45] UNBELIEF. RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME for
[50:48] God's grace to come and deal with
[50:50] unbelief. Let me just tell you
[50:52] something. GOD HAS COME with the right
[50:55] measure and the right medicine with the
[50:57] right antidote to minister to the sin
[51:00] question in this hour. You see what I'm
[51:03] saying is is that in this hour NO MATTER
[51:05] WHAT IT IS that we have been through
[51:07] where we come through all the things
[51:09] from THE PAST THE HOLY SPIRIT IS WHAT
[51:12] equalizes and what takes care of the sin
[51:16] QUESTION IN A LIFE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS
[51:18] WHAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, FRIENDS, IS HOW
[51:20] JESUS CHRIST HAS BEEN SO EXALTED THROUGH
[51:24] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IN THIS TIME.
[51:26] NOT THROUGH the lens of a man, but the
[51:29] message of the HOUR IS THE EXALTING OF
[51:32] JESUS CHRIST. IT'S MOVING BACK THE VEILS
[51:35] THAT MAN HAS PUT UPON. IT IS MOVING BACK
[51:38] ALL OF THE EXCUSES AND IT'S SHOWING
[51:41] CHRIST TO BE THE MIGHTY conqueror right
[51:44] here in our midst. That's what I love
[51:47] about it.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; So now when we're looking in an hour, in
[51:50] a day of confusion where people hardly
[51:53] know what to do, you know, the Bible
[51:55] promised in Zechariah 14, this would be
[51:59] that day where it is a day of dismal.
[52:02] It's a a grayish day. And Lord knows we
[52:04] live here uh you know in in northeast
[52:07] Ohio. We know what gray days are. And so
[52:10] within that, it's where it's, you know,
[52:12] neither white nor black. It's where
[52:14] things are not exactly clear and cut and
[52:17] where's the standard but God promised in
[52:20] the end time in the evening time there
[52:23] shall be light
[52:27] &gt;&gt; AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT LIGHT is to
[52:30] bring a people into their position IN
[52:34] JESUS CHRIST THAT THEIR LIVES WOULD
[52:37] BECOME FILLED WITH HIS SPIRIT BECAUSE
[52:40] ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE SEVEN AGES
[52:43] GOD HAS BEEN CALLING OUT A PEOPLE for
[52:46] his name's sake. And there have been
[52:49] THOSE THAT UNDER THEIR MESSAGE THEY HAVE
[52:52] they have been united WITH CHRIST THE
[52:55] WORD THAT HAS come in their generation.
[52:58] God had seven stars. The Bible tells us
[53:01] in his right hand power and authority.
[53:04] They came with that word revelation. And
[53:07] that word revelation actually brings out
[53:11] the elect from the world and into a full
[53:16] union with Jesus Christ. So notice IT
[53:19] REDEMPTION IS TWO PARTS. It's out of and
[53:23] into. It's a wonderful, WONDERFUL thing
[53:27] uh for a life to experience salvation to
[53:31] where I I I'm rejoice in that, you know,
[53:34] many that have been led into salvation
[53:37] to accept the Lord Jesus as their
[53:39] savior. But there's MORE THAT GOD WANTS
[53:43] TO DO THAN JUST TO be your savior. He
[53:46] wants to be the Lord of your life.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? HE WANTS TO TABERNACLE
[53:54] INSIDE of your life. Because listen, a
[53:57] life can accept him as savior and the
[54:01] things that made them DO THE THAT WHICH
[54:05] THEY HAD repented of all their sins is
[54:07] still there in their life. It's like
[54:11] we've all been in a place where, you
[54:14] know, I I've thought even out here, I
[54:16] walk around my house, but even when I'll
[54:17] take a break and come out here in the
[54:19] landscaping and I'll weed this around
[54:21] out here. And you know what? I You want
[54:24] to make sure you're getting the root.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; I can snap off that weed that's out
[54:30] here. And if I don't get the root, I
[54:32] know I got to come back to that area
[54:34] because there's going to be new growth.
[54:37] WHY? THE ROOT IS STILL THERE. AND THAT'S
[54:41] WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HE COMES TO DEAL
[54:43] WITH. BUT HE CALLS US IN STAGES OF
[54:48] REDEMPTION. THIS IS WHY, LISTEN TO ME,
[54:50] FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY GOD DOES NOT GIVE
[54:54] THE HOLY GHOST IN AN UNCLEAN VESSEL.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now. THIS IS RIGHT BIBLE. NOW,
[55:01] GOD DOES NOT GIVE, THE PROPHET SAID IT
[55:04] JUST LIKE THIS. GOD DOES NOT GIVE THE
[55:06] HOLY GHOST TO A SINNER, BUT GOD FIRST
[55:10] BRINGS THE INDIVIDUAL OUT OF THE WORLD.
[55:14] I MEAN, IF A MAN IS DROWNING, YOU GOT TO
[55:16] GET HIM OUT OF THE WATER BEFORE YOU EVER
[55:18] GET THE WATER OUT OF HIM.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? TO GETTING HIM OUT OF THE
[55:23] WATER IS JUSTIFICATION.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? AND THEN WHEN YOU
[55:28] GET HIM OUT OF THE WATER, THEN THERE'S
[55:29] GOT TO COME SANCTIFICATION. THERE'S GOT
[55:32] TO COME A CLEANSING FROM EVERY ONE OF
[55:35] THOSE DESIRES. AND THE PROPHET CALLED IT
[55:38] LIKE THIS. HABITS ARE SPIRITS.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; WELL, BROTHER SAMUEL, I'VE ALWAYS HAD
[55:43] THIS ON MY LIFE. YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE.
[55:46] EITHER MAKE AN EXCUSE AND LIVE WITH IT
[55:48] OR ALLOW THE BLOOD TO BE APPLIED.
[55:51] BECAUSE WHEN THE BLOOD'S APPLIED, THE
[55:54] BLOOD WILL TAKE CARE AND SANCTIFY THAT
[55:58] THEN THE SPIRIT CAN MOVE BEHIND the
[56:00] blood. Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; SO NOW THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IT'S SO KEY
[56:06] and so important, you know, and and many
[56:08] times like when I've worked with uh
[56:11] young people and other times and and
[56:13] others too sometimes when we're, you
[56:15] know, they're coming and they're asking
[56:16] for things and sometimes they'll say,
[56:18] you know, brother Samuel, I need a
[56:19] refilling of the Holy Ghost. Sometimes I
[56:21] need more time with that because I need
[56:23] to know where are you at. And when we're
[56:25] talking of this, ARE WE JUST TALKING
[56:27] ABOUT THAT WHERE YOU IN YOUR MIND IS
[56:29] JUST SOMETHING THAT you need upon your
[56:32] spirit? Because if that's all the DEEPER
[56:34] THAT IT'S GOING, I GOT TO TALK WITH YOU.
[56:36] SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
[56:38] TALK WITH THEM?" BECAUSE I I DO NOT WANT
[56:40] THE DEVIL TO HAVE A PLAYGROUND IN
[56:43] PEOPLE'S MIND. THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR
[56:46] TARGET THAT'S SET BEFORE THEM.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL REVELS IN CONFUSION. THAT'S
[56:53] WHY IN THIS AGE, THIS IS WHY THE ENEMY
[56:56] WANTS TO BRING SUCH CONFUSION WHERE HE'S
[56:59] EVEN TOLD PEOPLE, WELL, YOU JUST BELIEVE
[57:01] THE MESSAGE, BUT BELIEVING IT IS FIRST.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FRIENDS.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID AFTER YOU BELIEVE, YOU WERE
[57:10] SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROMISE. I
[57:13] BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART, YES, GOD CAN
[57:15] DO EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. BUT I AM ALSO
[57:19] SAYING THAT WHATEVER WHEN WE LOOK IN OUR
[57:22] LIFE, THERE HAS GOT TO COME AN ABSOLUTE
[57:25] CHANGE IN OUR LIFE, WE FOLLOW THE DAY
[57:28] STAR, THE LIGHT until the day star
[57:31] arises in our hearts.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Because I want TO KNOW IS THE SPIRIT IS
[57:40] IT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S UPON the
[57:42] spirit? Because let me tell you
[57:43] something friends in this hour the Holy
[57:46] Spirit. THIS IS WHY when the mystery of
[57:49] of of uh false anointed ones and Hebrews
[57:52] 6, Matthew 24 ALL OF THAT COMING ABOUT
[57:56] in and then even in Revelations 3 AND
[57:58] KNOWETH IT NOT IS BECAUSE A PERSON
[58:01] listen to me NOW THE PROPHET SAID ELVIS
[58:04] PRESLEY HAD THE BAPTISM of the Holy
[58:06] Ghost.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY HOW COULD THAT BE? HE HAD IT ON
[58:10] HIS SPIRIT.
[58:13] A PERSON CAN HAVE IT ON THEIR SPIRIT AND
[58:15] IT DON'T CHANGE THEIR NATURE.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A DEATH TO THAT MAN.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; But see, if a person walks by signs,
[58:25] they walk by evidences of experiences.
[58:29] Well, you know, I did this and I seen
[58:30] this AND AND ALL OF THAT IS THE
[58:32] SUPERNATURAL. BUT WHAT IF THAT'S WHY THE
[58:35] PROPHET SAID, YOU SAY YOU'VE SEEN A
[58:37] LIGHT? HE SAID, "BUT HOW'S HOW YOU KNOW
[58:40] IS HOW HAS YOUR LIFE BEEN SINCE you've
[58:43] seen that light?"
[58:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF NOT, THIS IS WHY THE PROPHET
[58:49] HAD SAID, HE SAID, "AWAY WITH
[58:51] EXPERIENCES." HE WASN'T GETTING RID OF
[58:53] EXPERIENCE, BUT HE'S DEALING WITH HOW
[58:55] THAT PEOPLE HAVE RESTED UPON SENSATIONS.
[58:59] THEY'VE RESTED UPON EXPERIENCES. THEY'VE
[59:01] RESTED ON SUPERNATURAL THINGS INSTEAD OF
[59:04] THE WORD OF GOD. AND HOW DOES THEIR LIFE
[59:06] COMPARE WITH the word?
[59:10] &gt;&gt; WE'RE WE'RE INTERESTED ABOUT GETTING OUT
[59:12] OF HERE FOR RAPTURE. And you know, so
[59:14] when we're looking AT THIS, WE KNOW THAT
[59:17] THERE is a certainty that God will bring
[59:20] us through his word, God will absolutely
[59:24] clean that life up. Listen friends, this
[59:26] is why many times where you see lives
[59:29] that are up and lives that are down,
[59:31] lives that are in, lives that are out.
[59:34] OH, BROTHER SAMUEL, ARE YOU SAYING THAT
[59:35] SOMEBODY CAN'T BACKSLIDE? THAT'S NOT
[59:37] WHAT I SAID. BUT SOMETIMES I'M WONDERING
[59:39] IF WHAT WE'RE CALLING BACKSLIDING IS
[59:41] ACTUALLY a lack of the Holy Ghost.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN A SERIOUS HOUR, FRIENDS.
[59:48] WE'RE LIVING IN AN HOUR WHERE THE HOLY
[59:50] GHOST IS NOT TO BE MINIMIZED, BUT JESUS
[59:53] CHRIST HAS TO BE EXALTED IN THE HEART
[59:56] AND LIFE OF EVERY SINGLE BELIEVER.
[1:00:01] THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU A BELIEVER. NOT
[1:00:03] BECAUSE YOU'RE AROUND THIS MESSAGE OR
[1:00:05] SAY IT'S THE TRUTH, BUT YOUR LIFE
[1:00:07] PUNCTUATES IT WITH AN AMEN.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; That's what MAKES IT DIFFERENT. YOU'RE
[1:00:12] NOT A BELIEVER BECAUSE YOU SAY THE BIBLE
[1:00:14] IS TRUE. YOU'RE A BELIEVER BECAUSE
[1:00:17] CHRIST HIMSELF LIVES ON THE INSIDE OF
[1:00:20] YOU.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, I WANT
[1:00:23] SCRIPTURE." THE DEVIL BELIEVES JESUS
[1:00:26] CHRIST IS THE SON OF GOD, AND HE
[1:00:28] TREMBLES. AMEN.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; THERE WERE MANY WHO WALKED WITH JESUS
[1:00:34] AND THEY BELIEVED on him.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WALKING WITH HIM.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO MOVE IN,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; that's where it showed up.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; The word got to a spot to where, oh no,
[1:00:51] we're not going that route. That's what
[1:00:53] happened to the Pentecostals.
[1:00:56] God never did away with gifts and all
[1:00:59] those things like that. BUT AS SOON AS
[1:01:01] THAT STARTED TO BE TOUCHED AND PUT IN
[1:01:03] ORDER, brother Ram said that Pentecostal
[1:01:06] cat flared up.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU START TOUCHING
[1:01:11] things of the supernatural AND YOU JUST
[1:01:13] WATCH. WATCH PEOPLE WATCH THEIR LIVES
[1:01:15] AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE TIED TO
[1:01:17] WHETHER THEY'RE TIED TO SUPERNATURAL
[1:01:20] THINGS IN THAT MATTER. YOU SAY, "BROTHER
[1:01:22] SAMUEL, WE BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL."
[1:01:24] THE NEW BIRTH IS A SUPERNATURAL.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SUPERNATURAL YOU NEED.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[1:01:32] THE DEVIL, THE PROPHET SAID IN HARVEST
[1:01:34] TIME 1964, CAN HAND OUT THESE
[1:01:37] SUPERNATURAL GIFTS by the handfuls.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; HE'LL MAKE OFFER AFTER OFFER AFTER
[1:01:44] OFFER. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO?
[1:01:46] THE PROPHET SAID WHEN HE DOES THAT, it's
[1:01:48] because he's seen somebody that's going
[1:01:49] to stay with the word. So now he's
[1:01:51] trying to always deviate them
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; from the word.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; It's the truth, friends.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Do we we believe in the supernatural?
[1:02:02] Because how could you not believe in the
[1:02:03] supernatural and not be born again?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; It takes the supernatural to bring the
[1:02:10] new birth within A PERSON'S LIFE.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES THE HOLY Spirit to do that. AND
[1:02:15] NOTICE THAT WITHIN IT, THAT'S WHY THE
[1:02:17] PROPHET COULD SAY THAT WITH speaking in
[1:02:19] tongues, all of those things, he said it
[1:02:21] is evidence that it is the Holy Spirit
[1:02:24] they're doing it, but it is not the
[1:02:26] evidence that a person is spiritfilled.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; You see, this is the word of prophecy
[1:02:35] that was spoken before and God coming
[1:02:39] and unfolding these things within our
[1:02:42] midst.
[1:02:43] Now I want to just I want to just move
[1:02:46] here just a little bit because with Paul
[1:02:49] in this declaration God even had set
[1:02:52] Paul to be a light to the Gentiles and
[1:02:56] the the purpose within Paul's ministry
[1:02:59] even as Paul would would would be given
[1:03:01] this by God was to open their eyes and
[1:03:05] turn them from darkness to light and
[1:03:08] from the power of Satan unto God that
[1:03:10] they may receive forgiveness ess of sins
[1:03:14] and inheritance among them that are
[1:03:16] sanctified by faith that is in me. So
[1:03:22] God has taken his word and he leads us
[1:03:28] to himself. He doesn't lead us, you
[1:03:31] know, God's not leading us to a man, but
[1:03:34] he's leading us to himself. This is why
[1:03:36] that when the real revelation that
[1:03:40] strikes about the message of the hour
[1:03:43] and the and the messenger, this is why
[1:03:46] that the clarity that's opened up and
[1:03:48] what we are to see is Jesus Christ and
[1:03:51] God opening opening our eyes to be
[1:03:55] united with Jesus Christ. GOD GOD NEVER
[1:03:58] sent the message for us to fall in love
[1:04:00] with the messenger. Rebecca never
[1:04:04] married Eleazar.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; BUT REBECCA, NOTICE THE UNDERSTANDING,
[1:04:09] THERE WAS A CHARACTER THAT WAS THERE
[1:04:11] THAT SUBMITTED ITSELF TO THE MESSAGE
[1:04:15] FROM ISAAC THAT ELEAZAR HAD. AND SHE
[1:04:18] BEGAN TO UH WALK INTO THE VERY PRAYER
[1:04:23] that Abraham had prayed. AND ELEAZAR WAS
[1:04:26] RIGHT WITH THAT PRAYER. AND SHE WALKS
[1:04:28] right into it AS ONE WITH A character
[1:04:32] that is now in a place to stand still
[1:04:36] and be dressed and made ready.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So, you know, she had to uh when
[1:04:44] Rebecca, think of how that in her
[1:04:46] decision that was made, she waters the
[1:04:49] camels and then she gets on the camel
[1:04:51] and she they make their journey. Now,
[1:04:55] IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW MANY MEN that they
[1:04:57] saw along the way, but there was
[1:05:00] something as she WAS FEEDING ON THE
[1:05:03] MESSAGE of Isaac. See, IT HAD BECOME
[1:05:06] FOOD TO HER. AS THE MORE THAT SHE FED ON
[1:05:08] THAT, THE MORE THAT THE CHARACTER of her
[1:05:12] bridegroom who she was GOING TO MEET WAS
[1:05:15] ACTUALLY now resonating IN HER HEART TO
[1:05:18] WHERE WHEN THEY CAME BY THE WELL OF HIM
[1:05:21] THAT LIVETH AND SEETH, SHE LOOKS OVER
[1:05:24] AND SHE SAYS, "WHO IS THIS MAN?" NOTICE
[1:05:26] THEY HAVE NO DOUBT PASSED MANY MEN. BUT
[1:05:29] THIS RIGHT NOW BECOMES SOMETHING TO HER
[1:05:32] THAT SHE SAYS, "WHO IS THIS MAN?" AND HE
[1:05:35] SAID, "IT is my master's son."
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; SEE, FEEDING ON THE WORD HAD BROUGHT HER
[1:05:42] INTO THE PLACE OF RECOGNIZING the very
[1:05:45] character OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY THAT WITHIN IT, AS WE'RE
[1:05:51] FEEDING ON THE WORD, IT BRINGS US IN THE
[1:05:54] RELATIONSHIP WITHIN OUR LIFE, THERE'S A
[1:05:56] FELLOWSHIPPING with this mystery. But I
[1:05:59] want you to see that God himself, he's
[1:06:02] led us to himself to tabernacle in our
[1:06:05] lives through three stages of grace. And
[1:06:08] God will do the same thing to the world
[1:06:11] after it's gone through three different
[1:06:13] stages of purification. And how does GOD
[1:06:16] DO THIS? HE does it by his unchanging
[1:06:19] way. He does it by his word.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Now, that's very key, friends. He does
[1:06:25] it by his word. God does not God does
[1:06:28] not do it. We believe in good music. I
[1:06:31] believe in good worship. But that's not
[1:06:33] how God DOES IT. GOD DOES IT BY HIS
[1:06:36] WORD.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And so WHEN WE NOTICE THAT THE WORD
[1:06:40] ITSELF, THIS IS WHY THAT it is is so
[1:06:44] imperative within that word because the
[1:06:47] conditions, remember we referred to this
[1:06:49] last week, when if God ever saved a man,
[1:06:52] he'll do the same thing when the same
[1:06:54] conditions are met again. IF GOD EVER
[1:06:57] HEALED A MAN, he'll heal a man when the
[1:06:59] same conditions are met again. So who is
[1:07:02] responsible for creating THE SAME
[1:07:05] CONDITIONS? YOU OR I CANNOT create those
[1:07:07] conditions, BUT IT IS GOD BY HIS WORD
[1:07:11] AND OUR LIVES COMING UNDER AND YIELDING
[1:07:14] TO THAT WORD. AND IT IS GOD WHO IS
[1:07:17] CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR HIS WORD TO
[1:07:20] COME TO PASS IN OUR LIFE. It's like I
[1:07:24] told you LAST WEEK, DO YOU REALIZE WHY
[1:07:26] THE DEVIL WILL TRY TO BATTLE YOU ABOUT
[1:07:29] COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD?
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now. OH, BROTHER SAMUEL, I CAN
[1:07:34] STREAM. TRY TO WATCH A FOOD CHANNEL and
[1:07:37] taste WHAT THEY'RE COOKING.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; TRY TO DO IT.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; THAT ARGUMENT DON'T WORK.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST GUACAMOLE IN THE
[1:07:45] HOUSE, BUT IT DON'T MATTER. YOU CAN'T
[1:07:48] SMELL IT. YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT.
[1:07:50] YOU'RE JUST A SPECTATOR.
[1:07:55] COME ON, FRIENDS.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN AN HOUR WE'VE GOT TO
[1:07:58] PRESS LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S JUST
[1:08:04] AN EASY THING. YOU'VE GOT TO PRESS.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT JUST
[1:08:09] SOMETHING YOU WALK INTO. YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:08:12] PRESS. AND YOU'VE GOT TO PRESS BEYOND
[1:08:14] YOUR OWN WILL.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO PRESS BEYOND YOUR
[1:08:19] OWN DOGMAS.
[1:08:21] THE OWN CREEDS THAT HAVE BEEN SET IN
[1:08:23] YOUR LIFE, WHETHER IT'S FROM A PREACHER
[1:08:25] OR YOU'VE JUST THROUGH YOUR
[1:08:27] INTERPRETATIONS WEAVED IN AN HOUR. IT'S
[1:08:30] AN HOUR OF RAPTURE TIME. IT'S AN HOUR TO
[1:08:33] PRESS LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; OH, brother Samuel, it's not of works
[1:08:41] lest we should boast. Let me just tell
[1:08:43] you something. God said he would take
[1:08:45] care of the robins. He would take care
[1:08:46] of the sparrows, but he don't drop the
[1:08:48] worms in their nest.
[1:08:51] Are you hearing me?
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, GOD JUST DO. WE'VE MADE GOD TO BE
[1:08:55] JUST LIKE A GOD'S JUST LIKE A socialist
[1:08:57] or something. He just dropping things.
[1:08:59] HE JUST DROPPING FREEBIES. JUST DROP IT.
[1:09:01] I DON'T HAVE NOTHING to do. I DON'T HAVE
[1:09:03] TO DO ANYTHING. NO. THE BIBLE SAID THAT
[1:09:05] THE KINGDOM OF GOD SUFFERETH VIOLENCE
[1:09:09] AND THE VIOLENT TAKE IT BY FORCE.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID THAT SINCE
[1:09:15] THAT TIME AND EVERY MAN PRESSES INTO IT,
[1:09:18] YOU GOT TO PRESS BEYOND YOUR FRIENDS.
[1:09:21] YOU GOT TO PRESS BEYOND EVERYTHING
[1:09:23] THAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; PRESS BEYOND EXCUSES. PRESS BEYOND
[1:09:28] SOMETIMES IT'S PRESSING BEYOND YOUR OWN
[1:09:30] LOVE OF MONEY.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; PRESSING BEYOND THINGS OF JOB. LET ME
[1:09:37] TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE TALKING TO A
[1:09:39] MAN WHO PRAYED AND WHEN I HAD TO WORK IN
[1:09:42] RETAIL, I GOD MADE A WAY THAT I COULD BE
[1:09:45] IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I AIN'T CONDEMNING
[1:09:47] NOBODY. I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU, YOU
[1:09:49] DON'T HAVE TO BE UNDER THE YOU CAN SAY,
[1:09:52] "GOD, I WANT TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD
[1:09:54] BECAUSE YOUR WORD, THERE'S AN
[1:09:56] ATMOSPHERE. WHEN THE WORD IS COMING
[1:09:58] FORTH, IT CREATES A CONDITION FOR LIFE.
[1:10:03] WE'RE LIVING IN AN AGE WHERE DEPRESSION
[1:10:05] AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE
[1:10:08] MOUNTED UP. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT
[1:10:10] JESUS CHRIST IS MORE THAN A match for
[1:10:13] every one of those things
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; when the same conditions are met. So God
[1:10:21] is obligated to his word. Listen, when
[1:10:23] God when God God gave this message to
[1:10:27] this generation, that's God obligating
[1:10:29] himself.
[1:10:32] Are you hearing me?
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; There's things there's things that God
[1:10:35] is calling you and I to listen. There's
[1:10:37] lives right here. You need to be filled
[1:10:40] with the spirit of God.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. We shouldn't get quiet on that.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; We should all be pulling for that. I
[1:10:46] don't care if you've been sitting here
[1:10:47] for 30 years.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; I don't matter if you've been sitting
[1:10:50] HERE FOR 50 YEARS. I DON'T EXEMPT
[1:10:52] ANYBODY from that. But what I DO SAY IS
[1:10:54] THIS. CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT? LISTEN. THE
[1:10:55] HOLY GHOST will never take AWAY FROM YOU
[1:10:57] WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:10:59] BUT WHAT HE WILL DO IS ADD TO IT.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD AIN'T GOING TO RAPTURE SPIRITUAL
[1:11:05] DORS.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Are you HEARING ME NOW? GOD AIN'T GOING
[1:11:09] TO RAPTURE MIDGETS. THERE'S GOING TO BE
[1:11:10] GROWING UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS. SO,
[1:11:13] WE'VE HAD AN EXPERIENCE. KEEP LOOKING
[1:11:15] FOR MORE EXPERIENCES IN THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:11:18] LORD, I NEED MORE OF YOU. THIS IS NOT
[1:11:20] THE HOUR TO GET COMPLACENT. WELL, IF I'M
[1:11:23] PREDESTINATED, I'LL BE THERE. WHERE DO
[1:11:25] YOU GET THAT FROM? THERE'S NOT A QUOTE
[1:11:28] IN THE MESSAGE THAT YOU CAN GIVE me that
[1:11:30] that'll fit that into some kind of
[1:11:32] lifestyle that way.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. This is different than
[1:11:36] how I thought.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE HOW THE DEVIL WANTS TO SO
[1:11:40] SKEW THAT AND WHAT DOES IT DO? IT
[1:11:43] results in a complacent lacadasical
[1:11:46] life.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Our lives are to be vigilant.
[1:11:51] Diligent as the scripture that's a
[1:11:53] scriptural terms diligent
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; lest we let those things slip.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Some of you probably thinking right now,
[1:12:03] why couldn't a whole basement have
[1:12:04] flooded?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; How about let's have a flood here this
[1:12:10] morning.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Let's have a real flood of the Holy
[1:12:13] Ghost.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You see, because here we know that GOD
[1:12:19] DOES IT BY HIS WORD. THIS IS WHY he
[1:12:21] said, "Let every man's word be a lie and
[1:12:23] mine BE THE TRUTH." GOD CREATES the
[1:12:26] conditions by HIS UNCHANGING WORD.
[1:12:29] THAT'S WHAT HE DID BACK IN GENESIS 1. It
[1:12:31] was the darkness. It was void. But God
[1:12:34] spoke and said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT."
[1:12:37] AND THE DARKNESS HAD TO GIVE WAY. AND
[1:12:40] WHAT WAS ALREADY THERE WAS THE SEED that
[1:12:42] was already planted there. All it needed
[1:12:46] was the light to shine upon it. YEAH.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS IS WHY THAT JESUS would say
[1:12:52] that we are not to live by bread alone,
[1:12:55] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:12:58] the mouth of God. Cuz you know,
[1:12:59] everything can be fine in the natural.
[1:13:01] But you know, through a real to a real
[1:13:04] spiritual believer, you were made, your
[1:13:06] satisfaction is not in the things of
[1:13:09] this earth. Let me just tell you
[1:13:10] something. If you can be satisfied in
[1:13:13] the things of this earth, you need a
[1:13:15] real trip to Calvary. YES,
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE NOT WENT DEEP enough in your WALK
[1:13:21] WITH GOD. YOU SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, YOU
[1:13:23] MEAN WE CAN'T ENJOY HUNTING? WE CAN'T
[1:13:24] ENJOY THAT." I DIDN'T SAY WE CAN'T ENJOY
[1:13:26] IT. BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY, IF JESUS
[1:13:28] CHRIST IS NOT THE NUMBER ONE
[1:13:30] SATISFACTION IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; then then WHAT YOU NEED IS A REAL DOSE
[1:13:37] OF THE HOLY GHOST. YOU NEED TO SAY,
[1:13:39] "GOD, BURN EVERYTHING OUT OF ME THAT'S
[1:13:42] UNLIKE YOU." BECAUSE WHAT MATTERS MORE
[1:13:44] THAN ANYTHING IS THIS RAPTURE. LORD, I
[1:13:47] WANT TO BE ONE WITH YOU, LORD GOD.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody wants to live a
[1:13:52] miserable life.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody does. No one wants
[1:13:57] to live in a place where we're just, you
[1:14:00] know, experiencing blessings that come
[1:14:03] from behind the veil. But yet within the
[1:14:06] life, you know, sometimes the life can
[1:14:08] be in and out. Well, sometimes, you
[1:14:10] know, it isn't always where somebody's
[1:14:11] out of church and and and then they're
[1:14:13] back into church. There's that, too. But
[1:14:15] then you have people that can even be in
[1:14:17] church and yet they're here physically,
[1:14:19] but they're out.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; That's good preaching.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; They're out. You know, YOU DON'T DO
[1:14:24] SOMETHING THEY LIKE, they're out on you.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE THAT? THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE
[1:14:31] HOLY SPIRIT TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THINGS
[1:14:33] IN OUR LIFE.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; WE NEED THE HOLY GHOST TO TAKE CARE OF
[1:14:37] THAT. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS ONE THAT WILL
[1:14:40] ACTUALLY NOT GLORIFY OFFENSES. HE WILL
[1:14:43] GIVE YOU DELIVERANCE AND HEALING FROM
[1:14:46] OFFENSES.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; IF YOU ALLOW HIM TO, HE'LL REMOVE EVERY
[1:14:51] EXCUSE THE DEVIL'S TRIED TO GIVE YOU FOR
[1:14:53] NOT REALLY SURRENDERING AND SUBMITTING
[1:14:55] YOUR LIFE TO GOD. JESUS CHRIST WILL
[1:14:58] DISMANTLE THAT LYING DEVIL THAT HAS
[1:15:01] WANTED TO BRING TORMENT OVER YOUR LIFE.
[1:15:04] THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL DISMANTLE HIM AND
[1:15:07] CALL POINT OUT WHAT IS TRUTH AND WHAT IS
[1:15:10] FICTION.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; This is why Paul would tell Timothy
[1:15:16] preach the word.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just saying just going around
[1:15:21] preaching. It's the same thing Peter
[1:15:23] said, let him speak as the oracles of
[1:15:25] God. Let it be by the inspiration of the
[1:15:27] Holy Ghost.
[1:15:31] Oh my. I know sometimes our flesh would
[1:15:34] like to control certain inspiration.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; But you see, I want I want you to look
[1:15:42] at this just for a moment because you
[1:15:45] see the word as it's being preached,
[1:15:47] it'll change the atmosphere.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; It will change the atmosphere. And let
[1:15:52] me just tell you something right now.
[1:15:54] The Holy Spirit is not what you achieve.
[1:16:00] Let me just drop this to you. As I was
[1:16:02] here last night praying, this the Holy
[1:16:05] Spirit brought back that quote to me of
[1:16:08] how Brother Brown said, "God's God's uh
[1:16:10] God's warrior, David," he said, "you're
[1:16:12] not a Christian by your desire. You're a
[1:16:16] Christian by God's desire."
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS MADE A WAY TO BRING YOU TO
[1:16:23] HIMSELF.
[1:16:25] NOT JUST TO A CHURCH, BUT ALL THE WAY IN
[1:16:28] HIM. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT A
[1:16:30] RIGHT TO STAND AND SAY, "THE HOLY GHOST
[1:16:32] IS MY PROMISE."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A BEGGAR. YOU'RE NOT A
[1:16:37] STRANGER, BUT A SON OF GOD. AND GOD IS
[1:16:40] MAKING KNOWN THE RIGHTS AND THE
[1:16:42] PRIVILEGES YOU GOT. I DON'T CARE WHO'S
[1:16:44] WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU. IT DON'T
[1:16:46] EVEN MATTER WHO'S SITTING BESIDE YOU.
[1:16:48] IT'S WHO IS THE LORD SPEAKING TO. AND
[1:16:51] WHEN HE'S MINISTERING TO YOUR HEART,
[1:16:53] TODAY IS YOUR DAY.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; So good. So good.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Acts 19.
[1:17:09] Here was a group of believers.
[1:17:11] Apollos.
[1:17:14] Apollos was their pastor.
[1:17:17] And Apollos man, I mean, he had really
[1:17:20] proved by the scriptures that Jesus,
[1:17:25] he was the Messiah. He had laid the
[1:17:28] Apollos had so laid that out. And here
[1:17:30] they were gathered unto the repentance.
[1:17:34] They had been baptized unto repentance.
[1:17:36] This group of 12 believers there in
[1:17:40] Ephesus in Acts 19, they had been
[1:17:43] baptized unto repentance.
[1:17:46] The sacrifice had already been offered
[1:17:48] up. The Holy Ghost had already come and
[1:17:52] they didn't know nothing about it.
[1:17:55] And when Paul came among them, Paul just
[1:17:58] started listening to him. And Paul said,
[1:18:00] he started noticing their their speech.
[1:18:02] He said, "Uh, how are you baptized?" See
[1:18:05] what he did? He didn't even ask him,
[1:18:07] "Did you receive the HOLY GHOST?" HE
[1:18:09] KNEW YOU GOT TO FOLLOW THE FORMULA.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; SEE, PAUL KNEW YOU GOT TO FOLLOW THE
[1:18:13] FORMULA.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT FOLLOWS
[1:18:18] AFTER FULL REPENTANCE.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. This might seem
[1:18:23] strong. Buckle it up. But it but it's
[1:18:25] good.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "If you say that
[1:18:28] you've repented and you've not received
[1:18:30] the Holy Ghost, then you make God a
[1:18:32] liar."
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:34] BECAUSE IF YOU FULLY REPENTED, YOU SEE,
[1:18:36] THIS ISN'T ABOUT, LISTEN, THIS ISN'T
[1:18:38] ABOUT PUTTING ANYBODY OUT, PUTTING
[1:18:40] ANYBODY DOWN, BUT IT'S IT BRINGS TO
[1:18:41] BLIGHT CERTAIN THINGS THAT SEEMS TO BE
[1:18:44] SO OBSCURE. WHY IS THIS? WHY IS THAT?
[1:18:46] BUT YOU CAN TRACE RIGHT BACK DOWN. AND
[1:18:48] THE PROPHET WOULD BE LED BY GOD WHEN HE
[1:18:51] PREACHES IN IN UH IN IN JULY OF 1963.
[1:18:55] HE CARES. Do you care? AND HE DEALS WITH
[1:18:59] THAT WHOLE SERVICE, THE WHOLE TRUE
[1:19:02] problem among people wondering, am I a
[1:19:05] part of it or am I not? I I don't know.
[1:19:09] It was repentance.
[1:19:11] You see, we if we're not careful,
[1:19:16] we've gone off and left him back at the
[1:19:17] feast of Pentecost.
[1:19:20] And Jesus ain't going to come to where
[1:19:22] we are. We got to go back to him in the
[1:19:24] word.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, friends? You can't
[1:19:27] you can't say, "WELL, JESUS, COME ON
[1:19:28] NOW. COME ON. We've already made two
[1:19:30] days journey." No, you got to come back
[1:19:32] to where you left him.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME BACK TO WHERE YOU LEFT
[1:19:36] HIM. BECAUSE FOR PENTECOST, LISTEN,
[1:19:38] PENTECOST IS IS NOT JUST A FEAST, BUT
[1:19:41] PENTECOST IS AN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF GOD
[1:19:44] COMING INTO YOUR LIFE.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And there's and it's AN
[1:19:50] EXPERIENCE OF WHEN GOD STEPS DOWN INTO
[1:19:52] THE VERY HEART OF MAN.
[1:19:55] This is why friends listen to me now.
[1:19:57] Listen, listen, listen. This is why
[1:19:59] sometimes that after years and years all
[1:20:02] of a sudden you wonder and say, "My
[1:20:04] goodness, this one 30, 40, 50 years. My
[1:20:08] lord, if I thought anybody had it, but
[1:20:10] you know what it is? They went off and
[1:20:12] left him."
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I know this ain't comfortable, but it's
[1:20:18] truth.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; One day we get we get stand we stand
[1:20:21] there on the other side. You'll be
[1:20:22] thanking me before it when you've
[1:20:24] received it.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Because you see the MESSAGE ITSELF, THE
[1:20:27] MESSAGE DIDN'T COME TO PUT ANYBODY DOWN.
[1:20:29] THE MESSAGE HAS COME TO CALL YOU OUT.
[1:20:31] YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? WHAT THE REAL
[1:20:32] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS? IT'S THE GRACE
[1:20:34] OF GOD TO THE DIRT AROUND YOUR LIFE
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SEED IT AIN'T ABOUT THIS
[1:20:39] DIRT. THIS DIRT GETS OFFENDED THIS DIRT
[1:20:42] AND THERE AND EVERYTHING. BUT IT AIN'T
[1:20:43] ABOUT THE DIRT BECAUSE THERE'S MANY,
[1:20:45] MANY, MANY WHERE THE LIGHT SHINES AND IT
[1:20:48] HAS NO IMPACT UPON THEIR LIFE. You know
[1:20:51] why? because there's no seed.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T PLANT
[1:20:58] ANYTHING OUT HERE, YOU CAN'T EXPECT
[1:20:59] NOTHING TO COME UP. YOU CAN YOU CAN
[1:21:01] BAPTIZE, YOU CAN WATER THIS GROUND, YOU
[1:21:04] CAN LIGHT IT, YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING
[1:21:05] ELSE. THERE'S NO SEED GOING TO COME UP
[1:21:07] IF YOU DIDN'T PUT NO SEED OUT THERE.
[1:21:10] IT'S LIKE BROTHER Willie and Brother
[1:21:11] Richie when they spread all that dirt,
[1:21:12] put down that seed.
[1:21:15] Brother Willie put down enough to sew
[1:21:18] the whole field across the street.
[1:21:22] BUT IF THERE HADN'T BEEN NOTHING DOWN
[1:21:23] THERE,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; IT WOULDN'T BEEN NOTHING COMING UP,
[1:21:27] RIGHT? THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOT OF
[1:21:28] unwanted weeds.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; We've all been that in sewing lawn. BUT
[1:21:32] YOU KNOW WHAT? SURE, THERE'LL BE SOME
[1:21:34] WEEDS COME UP, BUT WE'LL TAKE CARE OF
[1:21:35] THEM WEEDS AS THEY COME UP. I'M NOT
[1:21:37] WORRIED ABOUT THOSE WEEDS. WE'RE NOT
[1:21:38] WORRIED ABOUT THEM. IT'S GETTING THE
[1:21:40] SEED DOWN. AND THAT'S THE SAME WAY WHEN
[1:21:42] THE HOLY SPIRIT, WHEN JESUS CHRIST IS
[1:21:45] BEING MINISTERED, I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
[1:21:46] IT. WELL, BROTHER SAMUEL, IT MIGHT FALL
[1:21:48] HERE. IT MIGHT FALL THERE, BUT IT IS
[1:21:50] GOING TO FIND EVERY SEED OF GOD. THE
[1:21:54] WORD WILL FIND ITS TARGET.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; THE WORD HAS FOUND YOU.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; They had to be rebaptized
[1:22:12] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:15] Paul had to bring them up to the correct
[1:22:17] season. This is why when Paul told
[1:22:19] Timothy, "Be in season and out of season
[1:22:23] with all longsuffering and doctrine."
[1:22:27] Reproof with all longsuffering, reprove
[1:22:29] and doctrine. This is why the privilege
[1:22:31] of the word you this is why when the
[1:22:33] spirit of God I mean think about it when
[1:22:34] brother Brandham would stand there how
[1:22:36] many times brother Ram said, "Oh man, it
[1:22:38] got to a place they heard brother Ram
[1:22:39] was coming. Start pinning your hair up,
[1:22:41] pinning it up, pin it up, pinning it up,
[1:22:42] pin it up. Cuz you know what? If you if
[1:22:44] if he's down here and and he sees cut
[1:22:46] hair, HE'S GOING TO BLAST IT. IT AIN'T
[1:22:48] BROTHER BRANDHAM BLASTING IT.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, HOLINESS IS NOT A
[1:22:52] MESSAGE DOCTRINE. HOLINESS IS THE
[1:22:55] SCRIPTURES.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE RESTORED US BACK TO BIBLE
[1:23:00] FAITH.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. THIS IS WHY YOU SEE LIVES
[1:23:06] AS SOON AS THEY WALK AWAY FROM THE
[1:23:08] TRUTH, PUT ON THEIR SHORT BRITCHES, GO
[1:23:10] OUT AND CUT THEIR HAIR AND DO EVERYTHING
[1:23:12] ELSE. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS ALWAYS
[1:23:15] IN THEIR HEART ALL ALONG.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, FRIENDS, I'm not saying that
[1:23:20] somebody that's went astray that they
[1:23:22] won't COME BACK TO GOD. IF YOU'VE GOT A
[1:23:24] LOVE GOING ON OUT THERE, YOU HOLD ON TO
[1:23:26] GOD AND YOU HOLD ON TO THE PROMISE AND
[1:23:29] YOU KEEP THAT PROMISE. YOU KEEP standing
[1:23:32] steadfast with that. THEN THEN THEY I AM
[1:23:35] CLAIMING THEM. LORD, I'M STANDING UPON
[1:23:37] THAT WORD. LORD, JUST LIKE YOU CHANGED
[1:23:39] MY LIFE. IT WAS SUPERNATURAL. I DIDN'T
[1:23:42] STUDY MYSELF INTO SOMETHING. IT WASN'T A
[1:23:45] MAN THAT STRONG ARMED ME. BUT LORD, YOU
[1:23:47] MOVED DOWN AND YOU BEGIN TO DEAL WITH MY
[1:23:50] LIFE. YOU BEGIN TO CAUSE ME TO LOOK INTO
[1:23:52] THESE THINGS.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz let me tell you something. There's
[1:23:56] many hearts that have also walked away
[1:23:59] that it isn't that they walked away from
[1:24:00] the message. Sometimes there's things
[1:24:02] where they've been hurt. They've been
[1:24:04] bruised. Sometimes even images they've
[1:24:06] had in front of them have disappointed
[1:24:08] them.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Truth Don't tell me friends, I know.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; What is truth? How do I How do I know
[1:24:15] what's true? And and you know that it is
[1:24:18] so shaken there. But you know what? IT
[1:24:20] DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT? WHATEVER is down
[1:24:22] there, whatever's down there is going to
[1:24:24] come to life.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; I got to go to a quote right now.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; She said, "Bring it on." Yeah. Come on.
[1:24:38] There you go.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it like this. He said,
[1:24:41] "I want to drop something in here. I
[1:24:43] believe the Holy Spirit told me to do
[1:24:44] it." You might be sitting there. Some of
[1:24:47] you are. I know you are. You're
[1:24:48] disagreeing with me right now. I can
[1:24:51] call your name if you want me to. I know
[1:24:52] it. But I also can see farther THAN THAT
[1:24:58] YOU'RE GOING TO believe it one OF THESE
[1:25:00] DAYS.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROPHET.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS
[1:25:09] THAT ARE AROUND, REMEMBER WE WERE DARK
[1:25:12] AND VOID, BUT THERE WAS A SEA DOWN ON
[1:25:15] THE INSIDE.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD HAS COME TO MAKE CONTACT
[1:25:21] WITH THAT PART OF THE WORD INSIDE OF
[1:25:23] YOUR LIFE.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, IT IS THAT WHICH IS MAGNETIZED
[1:25:28] TO THE PROMISE IN THIS HOUR. That's why
[1:25:31] that even this message, it has an effect
[1:25:34] on your life.
[1:25:36] That's so good.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; He wants to draw you all the way into
[1:25:40] full relationship.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; He don't want to just be your
[1:25:47] girlfriend.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus don't want to just be your
[1:25:49] boyfriend.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; He don't want to just be a romantic
[1:25:52] encounter, somebody you can text. And
[1:25:54] you know that that's not what he wants.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet called a
[1:25:58] flirter.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; You know, a flirter is one who really
[1:26:01] don't have clear intentions.
[1:26:04] They just kind of like the emotions.
[1:26:06] They like playing with emotions.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; They like all that. Come on. These Am I
[1:26:10] not preaching message terms here?
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Flurters.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; But you see, within all of that, LET ME
[1:26:16] TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD'S GRACE IS
[1:26:18] SUFFICIENT WHERE IT CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A
[1:26:21] life that might HAVE BEEN FLIRTING AND
[1:26:23] IT COMES TO A PLACE OF SERIOUSNESS THAT
[1:26:25] SAYS, "GOD, I no longer want to be a
[1:26:27] flirt. I want to be fully united.
[1:26:31] I want to be one with you, Lord God. I
[1:26:33] WANT TO HOW DO I DO THAT? START TAKING
[1:26:35] THE WORD AND APPLYING IT TO YOUR LIFE.
[1:26:38] BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS? THE
[1:26:39] WORD BEING PREACHED IS THE BLOOD BEING
[1:26:41] SPRINKLED. AND AS YOU START APPLYING THE
[1:26:44] BLOOD, THE SPIRIT WILL FOLLOW THE BLOOD.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SPIRIT WON'T COME
[1:26:51] WITHOUT THE BLOOD.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD'S GOT TO BE APPLIED. THEN THE
[1:26:56] SPIRIT WILL COME.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right? I've been preaching this
[1:26:59] out of Leviticus 8. That's right where
[1:27:01] we're at. And the spirit will follow the
[1:27:03] blood. Now, let me finish this quote.
[1:27:05] It's just it's too good to pause.
[1:27:08] I can see farther than that. You're
[1:27:10] going to believe it one of these days.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "SO, I'M GOING TO PUT this in
[1:27:15] so you'll understand so I can give you a
[1:27:18] little spot of grace right here."
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; When it ain't going to be too long till
[1:27:23] you're going to change your mind. Some
[1:27:26] of you and then some of you won't. But
[1:27:28] he said when remember when Sarah first
[1:27:30] heard the man. How when remember when
[1:27:32] Sarah first heard the man
[1:27:35] Sarah she laughed up her sleeve. That
[1:27:37] means inside.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Some of these Kuckians got that. But
[1:27:40] that means inside.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; That's what that mean. It meant inside.
[1:27:44] They're chuckling inside. Oh, you know
[1:27:46] WATCH THIS. AND GOD WOULD HAVE SMELT
[1:27:49] HER.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS UNITED WITH ABRAHAM AND
[1:27:53] ABRAHAM WAS HOLDING THE PROMISE. NOW LET
[1:27:55] ME PREACH. NOW, DON'T YOU SEE HOW
[1:27:57] IMPORTANT IT IS FOR A HUSBAND? LISTEN,
[1:27:59] HUSBAND, YOUR WIFE SHOULD NOT BE THE
[1:28:01] head of the home.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to preach now.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TO BE THE SPIRITUAL LEADER, THE
[1:28:07] SPIRITUAL PRIESTHOOD.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; WELL, SHE'S MORE SPIRITUAL. AH, you're
[1:28:11] to be THE SPIRITUAL ONE. SPIRITUAL MEANS
[1:28:14] SPIRITFILLED.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, FRIENDS. YOU SEE, GOD HAS
[1:28:18] DELIVERED A MESSAGE TO DELIVER ANY OF
[1:28:21] THIS STUFF OF being a
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:25] Woo.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS A MESSAGE. LOOK AT
[1:28:29] LOOK AT HOW BROTHER BRANDHAM EVEN WHEN
[1:28:31] BROTHER BRANDHAM IS UP. LISTEN, THAT'S
[1:28:32] WHAT that's what even the culture hates
[1:28:34] today. They hate man.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you what that is.
[1:28:40] Because there is the man Christ Jesus
[1:28:42] that has come.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And the man Christ Jesus the word THEY
[1:28:45] SAID WE WILL NOT HAVE THIS man to rule
[1:28:47] over us.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; They do NOT WANT ANY AUTHORITY OVER
[1:28:51] THEM. THEY DON'T WANT NO ABSOLUTE. THEY
[1:28:53] DON'T WANT TO BE THEY DON'T want a man
[1:28:54] being a man. LISTEN, I'M NOT TALKING
[1:28:56] ABOUT A MAN BEING IMMORAL. I'M TALKING
[1:28:58] ABOUT A MAN WHO'S ONE. HE CAN STAND FOR
[1:29:00] HIS CONVICTION. IT'S NOT A WISHY-WASHY.
[1:29:02] I'M TALKING TO YOU SAY, "IS THAT IS THAT
[1:29:05] POSSIBLE?" NOT IN YOUR DNA. BUT I
[1:29:07] BELIEVE THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IS HERE TO
[1:29:09] MAKE A MAN A MAN AND A WOMAN A WOMAN.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; AND HE'LL PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE. HE'LL
[1:29:16] LEAD YOU TO RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED TO BE.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FRIENDS. Where we're no longer
[1:29:21] LED BY OUR FEELINGS. WELL, YOU KNOW MY
[1:29:23] WIFE THIS. I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO TALK
[1:29:25] WITH OUR WIVES. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO
[1:29:27] CONVERSE. WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND ONE
[1:29:29] ANOTHER. BUT FRIENDS, LET ME JUST TELL
[1:29:30] YOU SOMETHING. IN THIS HOUR, WE ARE
[1:29:33] LIVING IN A TIME, IN AN HOUR WHERE YOUR
[1:29:35] HOME, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR CHILDREN. THEY
[1:29:38] NEED TO SEE JESUS CHRIST LIVING INSIDE
[1:29:41] OF YOU. THEY DON'T NEED TO HEAR THE
[1:29:43] MESSAGE TALKED ABOUT. THEY NEED TO SEE
[1:29:45] IT LIVED.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; AND THE ONE THAT'LL DO THAT IS THE HOLY
[1:29:50] GHOST.
[1:29:52] THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID, "LET THEM
[1:29:54] SEE THE TOKEN ON THE INSIDE OF YOU."
[1:29:57] LISTEN, IT AIN'T HARD TO GET THERE. ALL
[1:29:59] YOU HAVE TO DO IS APPLY THE WORD AND
[1:30:02] RECEIVE THE WORD AND SAY, "AMEN TO THE
[1:30:05] WORD OF GOD." LORD, CLEAN MY LIFE UP,
[1:30:08] LORD GOD. FILL MY LIFE UP.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Some of you might be despising this and
[1:30:18] you might be the very one that needs it.
[1:30:22] Don't miss your day of visitation.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; I'm no prophet. I don't claim to be no
[1:30:31] prophet. But I am saying this right here
[1:30:33] that the Holy Spirit is speaking very
[1:30:35] clearly and very plainly. We are listen.
[1:30:38] We see prophecies coming to pass. We see
[1:30:40] prophecies where the prophet spoke clear
[1:30:42] back there. Acts of the Holy Spirit what
[1:30:44] 1954 about how there would be a pope
[1:30:46] come out of America.
[1:30:49] Right. And there IT IS.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THIS
[1:30:53] HOUR? YOU RECOGNIZE AND YOU SEE IT
[1:30:55] HADN'T STIRRED MANY PEOPLE AT ALL.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; LIVES JUST KEEP ON GOING THE SAME WAY.
[1:31:02] KEEP ON. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S
[1:31:04] ALSO IN EFFECT HOW IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF
[1:31:06] NOAH. THEY WERE SO OCCUPIED WITH THEIR
[1:31:10] LIFE.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; They ate, they drank, they slept, they
[1:31:14] build it. They were married. given in
[1:31:15] marriage.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; They were occupied with self.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes it isn't, you know, alto
[1:31:23] together maybe eating, drinking, and
[1:31:25] everything else. But maybe you're just
[1:31:27] drinking your own poison.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; That's called bitterness.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And expecting somebody else to fall
[1:31:34] over.
[1:31:36] Maybe it's drinking up your own. Oh,
[1:31:38] I've been offended and I've been
[1:31:39] offended and I've been offended. Listen,
[1:31:41] who hasn't been offended?
[1:31:45] AND I DON'T MEAN I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
[1:31:46] CRASS, BUT I'M JUST SAYING LIKE THIS.
[1:31:48] I'VE BEEN OFFENDED.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; I mean, SO DO WE HAVE JUST A PITY PARTY
[1:31:52] OF OFFENSES?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; OH, I know that sounds rough, BUT YOU
[1:31:56] SEE, FRIENDS, WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO?
[1:31:58] HOW CAN I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION. HOW
[1:32:00] CAN WE STAND AND SAY, BELOVED, OH NOW,
[1:32:04] WHAT MANNER OF LOVE HAD GOD BESTOWED ON
[1:32:06] US THAT WE SHOULD BE CALLED THE SONS OF
[1:32:08] GOD? HOW CAN WE QUOTE THAT SCRIPTURE AND
[1:32:11] NOT LIVE UP TO IT EVEN IN THE VALLEY OR
[1:32:14] WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN OR WHEN WE'RE
[1:32:16] OFFENDED IF WE CAN'T DO IT? IT'S BECAUSE
[1:32:19] WE LACK THE POWER
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL MAKE you
[1:32:26] and lead you into that.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE'LL DO. BUT YOU SEE IN
[1:32:33] THIS HOUR THE HOLY GHOST HAD BEEN
[1:32:35] WATERED DOWN TO A GOOD THOUGHT, GOOD
[1:32:37] FEELING. OH, WELL, you know, you're
[1:32:38] still going TO BATTLE THE FLESH. THAT'S
[1:32:40] TRUE. BUT I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE AN EXCUSE
[1:32:42] FOR THE FLESH. WE'RE NOT HERE TO GIVE A
[1:32:44] PLACE TO THE DEVIL. WE'RE NOT HERE TO
[1:32:46] GIVE STRONGHOLDS TO THE DEVIL. WE ARE
[1:32:48] HERE WITH A WORD THAT HAS COME TO
[1:32:50] ACTUALLY GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH SATAN'S
[1:32:53] KINGDOM.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A WORD RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING
[1:32:58] THAT CAN BREAK the hold over your life.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; It can break generation. Oh, brother
[1:33:04] Samuel, you know, uh, all I've ever
[1:33:06] known about the message is dos and
[1:33:08] don'ts. Then come experience grace.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz the message ain't dos and don'ts.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; You're missing it.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; You're missing it. The message is not
[1:33:16] dos and don'ts. The message is NOT
[1:33:18] LEGALISM. MAYBE THAT'S HOW SOMETHING WAS
[1:33:20] PRESENTED TO YOU. BUT let me just TELL
[1:33:21] YOU SOMETHING. DON'T STAY BACK THERE AND
[1:33:24] allow the DEVIL TO KEEP PUTTING WOOD ON
[1:33:26] THAT FIRE AND MAKING THAT EXCUSE. SAY,
[1:33:28] "I'M GOING TO BE ON THIS SCARECROW, AND
[1:33:30] I'M GOING TO RECEIVE THE GRACE OF GOD TO
[1:33:33] MY LIFE WHERE MY HEART CAN BE CHANGED TO
[1:33:36] BE A LEVER OF THE WORD OF GOD."
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; My my my. This is what the spirit of God
[1:33:46] has come to do within our lives. This is
[1:33:50] why, let me just let me just try to
[1:33:54] bring this down here.
[1:33:58] Mama
[1:34:07] trying to go through all this hay.
[1:34:12] Let me just kind of capitalize it right
[1:34:15] here.
[1:34:22] The Bible tells us
[1:34:25] that there are three
[1:34:30] that are one. The Father, the Word, and
[1:34:34] the Holy Ghost. They're one.
[1:34:38] And there are three that agree in one.
[1:34:41] Water, blood, and spirit.
[1:34:45] These are the three stages that God
[1:34:49] leads a life through in order to come
[1:34:54] and tabernacle in that life.
[1:34:58] When the Holy Spirit comes, it's the
[1:35:01] word
[1:35:03] that begins to get your attention. It's
[1:35:05] the word that is really dealing with
[1:35:08] your life. Now, I know some some lives
[1:35:10] you might have been touched when you
[1:35:13] were sitting in a different place
[1:35:16] and you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] as your savior, but you couldn't have
[1:35:20] accepted the Holy Ghost outside of
[1:35:23] coming under the word for your hour
[1:35:26] because that's the promise of a of a
[1:35:28] real word birth. This is why the if a
[1:35:30] person said, "Well, I got the Holy Ghost
[1:35:32] back in a charismatic church." You had a
[1:35:34] baptism,
[1:35:35] but not a word birth. The word birth
[1:35:38] comes under the word for your hour.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; You You've got to be born by the word
[1:35:44] for your hour. See that that that's a
[1:35:46] confusion sometimes that many may. It's
[1:35:48] experiences that's been had. This is why
[1:35:51] the prophet said it like this. Being an
[1:35:53] elect seed of God, he said it's always
[1:35:55] the elect seed that have seen the word
[1:35:58] in their hour. It is the inspiration of
[1:36:01] the Holy Spirit that is being poured out
[1:36:03] in that hour upon that seed. They saw it
[1:36:06] in Noah's time. They saw it in Moses'
[1:36:08] time. It was always the seed that
[1:36:10] responded to that inspiration because
[1:36:13] there were others that when that
[1:36:14] inspiration was poured out, they could
[1:36:16] walk with it for so long. But then when
[1:36:19] it got down to certain places, it was
[1:36:21] just exactly as it was when with Jack,
[1:36:24] brother Jack Moore and all the rest of
[1:36:25] them. You've seen many of them, they
[1:36:26] departed. You've seen many that just
[1:36:28] completely pulled away. Even those who
[1:36:30] made like TL Osborne made some in
[1:36:32] tremendous statements that if you read
[1:36:35] that and did not know and see where TL
[1:36:37] Osborne went off and you but it wasn't
[1:36:40] it wasn't revealed to TL Osborne
[1:36:43] what this was all about.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It wasn't yet he there was some very
[1:36:48] good statements he made you can read in
[1:36:51] the memorial service where he was really
[1:36:53] dividing the dividing things out very
[1:36:55] very very good but it wasn't revealed to
[1:36:58] him. See, when the when the revelation
[1:37:01] when this message is revealed to you,
[1:37:03] what you see is Jesus Christ, WHEN THE
[1:37:07] MESSAGE IS REVEALED, what you see is a
[1:37:10] full fresh view of Calvary.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE come to do. IT
[1:37:18] COME TO BREAK AWAY MAN-MADE VEILS and
[1:37:21] bring JESUS CHRIST in view OF THE
[1:37:24] BELIEVER TO WHERE HE IS YOUR MEDIATOR.
[1:37:28] AND THERE'S NO MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND
[1:37:31] MAN EXCEPT THE MAN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:37:37] AND SO GOD'S DESIRE, THIS IS WHY THE
[1:37:41] PROPHET speaking about that inspiration.
[1:37:43] He said, and and and many of believers,
[1:37:47] this is kind of a a terminology that you
[1:37:49] would you hear. He said, "This is why if
[1:37:52] I taught you a Methodist message, it
[1:37:55] would not take an effect upon you."
[1:37:59] Now, does that mean that you could not
[1:38:01] have had your start in a Methodist? You
[1:38:03] might have had your start there. You
[1:38:05] might have had your start in a Catholic
[1:38:06] church
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; where YOU HEARD ABOUT JESUS CHRIST BEING
[1:38:10] YOUR SAVIOR, BUT YOU COULDN'T STAY
[1:38:11] THERE. AND YOU KNOW WHY YOU COULDN'T? IS
[1:38:13] BECAUSE YOU WERE PART OF THE MYSTERY OF
[1:38:17] GOD. YOU WERE ORDAINED TO TO BE A PART
[1:38:21] OF THIS WORD. YOU WERE ORDAINED TO BE
[1:38:24] FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:38:30] THAT MESSAGE WAS FOR A SEASON.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, preach the word, BE IN SEASON,
[1:38:36] OUT OF SEASON.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; THEN THE SEASON OF THE WORD. THAT'S WHY
[1:38:41] JUST TEACHING LUTHER'S MESSAGE WOULD NOT
[1:38:44] TAKE AN EFFECT. IT WOULD NOT BRING ABOUT
[1:38:47] THAT OF THE fullness and that OF THE
[1:38:50] FULL NEW BIRTH. IT WOULDN'T DO THAT.
[1:38:53] THIS IS WHY THIS MESSAGE WE'RE TALKING
[1:38:56] ABOUT IS THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD OF
[1:38:58] GOD. THE HOLY SPIRIT COMING TO BRING A
[1:39:02] FULL word birth.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; This is why the bride is not in the
[1:39:07] feet. She's not in the legs. You
[1:39:09] brothers have gotten married. You didn't
[1:39:10] go out and marry a little girl.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Could make a comment about something or
[1:39:17] I won't stay.
[1:39:24] You didn't you didn't go out and do
[1:39:25] that.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; You you waited and it was in the time
[1:39:31] THE SEASON OF LOVE. IT WAS A MATURITY,
[1:39:35] RIGHT?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And and YOU MARRIED HER. THAT'S THE SAME
[1:39:37] THING IN THIS HOUR. LISTEN TO ME. SOME
[1:39:40] OF YOU EVEN knew and maybe many of YOU
[1:39:42] THAT'S SAT HERE FOR YEARS WHEN YOU'RE
[1:39:44] HEARING THIS OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:39:46] IT'S A TIME OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB
[1:39:49] TO WHERE GOD HAS BEEN BUILDING A BRIDE.
[1:39:52] HOW HAS HE BUILT HIS BRIDE? HE'S BUILT
[1:39:54] IT BY HIS WORD.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE'S BUILT IT RIGHT BY HIS
[1:39:59] WORD. SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF HIS SIDE. AND
[1:40:02] NOW IS THE HOUR FOR THE MARRIAGE OF THE
[1:40:04] LAMB. GOD IS NOT MARRYING AN INFANT
[1:40:08] BRIDE.
[1:40:10] COME ON. HE'S NOT MARRYING A PENTECOSTAL
[1:40:13] ISUZA STREET BRIDE. WE THANK GOD FOR
[1:40:16] WHAT HE DID BACK THERE. BUT THAT LISTEN,
[1:40:18] THE LIFE PASSED ON THROUGH THERE.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH YEAH, WE BELIEVE IN THE
[1:40:25] GIFTS, BUT MALACHI 4 CAME NOT TO DO AWAY
[1:40:28] WITH THE GIFTS.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said they've been placed
[1:40:32] on the mantle, not in storage.
[1:40:35] Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You know I've stood WE PREACH THAT NOT
[1:40:37] IN STORAGE but they've been put in
[1:40:39] position
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; like MY WIFE AND I LISTEN OUR STOCKP IS
[1:40:43] NOT IN STORAGE. Our saucepan's NOT IN
[1:40:46] STORAGE. SISTER, THOSE OF YOU THAT MAKE
[1:40:47] RICE, IT'S NOT IN STORAGE. IT'S IN ITS
[1:40:49] POSITION. AND WHEN YOU NEED IT, YOU GO
[1:40:51] GET IT. AND THAT'S THE SAME WAY WITH THE
[1:40:54] GIFTS IN THE BODY. WE ARE NOT LIVING OUR
[1:40:57] LIVES BASED ON GIFTS OR SUPERNATURAL
[1:41:00] HAPPENINGS. BUT OUR LIFE HAS BEEN BORN
[1:41:03] OF THE SUPERNATURAL AND CHRIST HAS COME
[1:41:06] AND PUT THOSE THINGS IN POSITION.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Come on friends, y'all know what I'm
[1:41:10] talking about.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; We've lived through the time to where we
[1:41:15] can have a service and if we don't have
[1:41:17] an altar call, oh, have we really had
[1:41:21] church?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I believe in altter calls. Don't you?
[1:41:26] But it's like the prophet when he's
[1:41:28] laying that in about ball alter calls.
[1:41:29] He believed in them too. But he didn't
[1:41:31] believe in them where it's pulling,
[1:41:33] persuading, and working the people.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; That's where the prophet said, "We got
[1:41:38] it all muddled up." He said, "We get a
[1:41:39] lot more stuff."
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN? CONVICTION.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY, let me tell you what a
[1:41:46] blessed THING IT IS. IF YOU CAN SIT
[1:41:48] RIGHT HERE WHILE THE WORD IS BEING
[1:41:49] PREACHED AND THERE'S CONVICTION, YOU CAN
[1:41:51] FEED ON THAT WORD. AND THAT WORD,
[1:41:53] LISTEN, RIGHT? EVEN WHILE THE WORD'S
[1:41:55] COMING FORTH, THERE'S THINGS WHERE WHERE
[1:41:57] SATAN IS BEING PUT TO FLIGHT. EVEN FROM
[1:41:59] MINDS, EVEN FROM LIVES, HEARTS ARE BEING
[1:42:01] CHANGED. THE BLOOD'S BEING APPLIED. IT'S
[1:42:03] MAKING WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:42:05] MAKING A WAY FOR HIMSELF TO COME AND
[1:42:08] TABERNACLE INSIDE OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; But I say it in like this.
[1:42:18] You don't want to just have been
[1:42:20] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:21] That's a first step. and repent.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; But you wanna Lord, that next step is
[1:42:32] take all the wants away.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; That's all that that's sanctification.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; That's where the Holy Spirit comes in to
[1:42:40] take away all the wants.
[1:42:43] But you see, this is why, listen to me
[1:42:45] now, this is why in this hour, see, it
[1:42:48] sets our mind in order, order of
[1:42:50] holiness. But this is why in this hour
[1:42:54] the prophet takes us in how can overcome
[1:42:56] and he said people can live above
[1:42:58] adultery, drinking, fornication, live
[1:43:02] above all these things and still not
[1:43:06] with it.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; He said this is the age of the literal
[1:43:12] life of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; This is the this is how we overcome. and
[1:43:19] and you know you you look and say,
[1:43:20] "Well, brother Sam, no, how do I know
[1:43:22] that I've overcome?" Look at your life.
[1:43:26] Look at the desire of your life. Has
[1:43:29] your life been changed?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe in growing. I believe
[1:43:34] before THERE BE A GROWTH, THERE'S got to
[1:43:36] be a birth ON THE INSIDE. YOU'RE NOT
[1:43:38] BORN one day, all of a sudden you're
[1:43:40] born again in a fully matured son of God
[1:43:42] the next day. The prophet called that
[1:43:43] nonsense,
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; right? He said they're teaching that
[1:43:46] nonsense out there on the West Coast.
[1:43:48] It's nonsense.
[1:43:49] We are LIVING IN THE HOUR IN THE
[1:43:52] FULLNESS OF ADOPTION WHERE THE SPIRIT OF
[1:43:55] ADOPTION HAS COME TO BRING SONS AND
[1:43:57] DAUGHTERS OF GOD INTO FULL POSITION.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; SEE THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS WHY WITHIN
[1:44:06] OUR LIFE that the Holy Spirit WE WANT TO
[1:44:09] EXAMINE OUR LIFE and ensure that we have
[1:44:12] been filled with God's spirit.
[1:44:16] See, when God's spirit has come on the
[1:44:18] inside,
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; it takes it changes your desires.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; This word, the word, the word of God
[1:44:26] becomes alive to your life. You You
[1:44:29] can't get enough of the word of God. You
[1:44:31] You MEAN IT'S LIFE. IT'S NOT JUST
[1:44:33] STUDYING because there's people that can
[1:44:34] be good students. That's not what I'm
[1:44:37] talking about. You You know what I mean?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; You know, but but I'm talking about
[1:44:40] where it's life. You can't get enough.
[1:44:43] It just there there's a feeding that
[1:44:44] that's taking place within your life.
[1:44:46] You're seeing you in your life. THERE'S
[1:44:48] A CHANGE THAT TAKES PLACE ON THE INSIDE
[1:44:50] OF YOUR LIFE. EVEN AS THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:44:53] WOULD BRING CORRECTION TO YOUR LIFE,
[1:44:54] THERE'S A SUBMISSION, A SUBMISSIVE HEART
[1:44:58] TO THE SPIRIT of truth.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; I tell you what he does, friends. He
[1:45:07] gives you grace to rule over that
[1:45:08] temper.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:11] He gives you grace in your life. And you
[1:45:13] know what? He makes a real real real
[1:45:15] Christian out of you.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Are y'all with me?
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; He makes a real And once one as he's
[1:45:21] come on the inside, oh my, you talking
[1:45:24] about there's there's a love affair
[1:45:26] that's taking place. This is why that
[1:45:29] you know when you look, we just we just
[1:45:30] simply just submit our lives and examine
[1:45:32] our lives and look at it because, you
[1:45:35] know, it's one thing for us to be able
[1:45:36] to say, well, I love God. But it's
[1:45:38] another thing to actually be able to
[1:45:40] look at our lives because this is the
[1:45:42] condition and I'm gonna close of this
[1:45:46] lady age.
[1:45:48] They don't even know the condition
[1:45:49] they're in.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; They don't know.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; They're blind. They're miserable.
[1:46:00] They're naked and wretched. And here's
[1:46:02] the worst part. Don't know it.
[1:46:05] They don't know it. They can look at it
[1:46:08] and let me just tell you how Satan would
[1:46:10] love to rock to sleep
[1:46:13] and just just try to just little by
[1:46:16] little, well, you know, you see the
[1:46:18] message and wow, you know, wow, do you
[1:46:20] believe the message, but friends, listen
[1:46:22] to me. It's not enough to be around
[1:46:25] where it's at.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; You've got to get in it.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And what's what it is is it's got to get
[1:46:30] inside of you. And I'm talking about
[1:46:31] Jesus Christ inside of your life. If
[1:46:34] there's one sitting here today and you
[1:46:36] have not repented and been baptized in
[1:46:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, what
[1:46:41] an opportunity for today.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; If there's one here today that you have
[1:46:46] not you have not come to that place to
[1:46:48] really have been united with Jesus
[1:46:50] Christ, I wouldn't be ashamed of him
[1:46:52] because he said, "If you're ashamed of
[1:46:53] me and my words in this generation, I'll
[1:46:55] be ashamed of you."
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; I'd say, "God, I I lay aside every bit
[1:46:59] of that fear. I want to be united with
[1:47:00] you, Lord. Yes.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I I I want to be one with Jesus Christ.
[1:47:04] I want I want that settled in my life. I
[1:47:06] want that victory coming down in my
[1:47:08] life.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh friends, you know, as
[1:47:12] we're talking about it, it doesn't mean
[1:47:14] that every day that and everything that
[1:47:16] my we're going to be walking on the
[1:47:18] clouds, but it means there's an anchor
[1:47:19] that holds you. There's a change that's
[1:47:21] come into your life. And you can say, I
[1:47:23] am not the person that I used to be.
[1:47:25] There is a change that has transformed
[1:47:27] and taken place in my life. What has
[1:47:30] done that? the word of God.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to you. You
[1:47:35] take the word,
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; the preaching of the word is the
[1:47:38] sprinkling of the blood.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; And you apply the blood to your life,
[1:47:42] and the spirit will follow the blood.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; And you watch, it won't be you having to
[1:47:49] quit things. It will be the desire
[1:47:53] fleeing you.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I'm just encouraging you. We just don't
[1:48:00] want to sit around where it's at.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; We want to get fully into it.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; I know there's many. I believe I am. I
[1:48:10] believe I'm all I believe I'm all the
[1:48:11] way in. But I want more of him.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; I want more of him. Something about it.
[1:48:16] I can't get enough of him.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; I want more of him. And I'm talking
[1:48:19] about, you know what? Even when he skins
[1:48:21] my hide,
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful. You know why? I know he
[1:48:24] loves me.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; I know he cares about me. I'm so
[1:48:27] thankful for his mercy.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:48:41] It certainly isn't maybe the way that I
[1:48:43] looked at some things that was going to
[1:48:46] all together and how it was going to
[1:48:48] come come about. But God
[1:48:51] God knows how to piece things together
[1:48:52] where I feel like things are just but he
[1:48:55] knows how to put it together. But what's
[1:48:57] most important,
[1:48:59] listen friends,
[1:49:01] my brothers, my sisters, don't don't
[1:49:03] don't take this this day or this moment
[1:49:06] for granted.
[1:49:09] Maybe even some that are even be
[1:49:11] streaming this right now, but don't take
[1:49:12] this for granted. Brother Samuel, I I
[1:49:15] would be ashamed to say that I need the
[1:49:18] spirit of God in my life. Don't be
[1:49:20] ashamed, friends.
[1:49:22] Don't be ashamed.
[1:49:25] But know that it's God's mercy. That's
[1:49:27] what we're here for.
[1:49:30] This church, this building, it's not
[1:49:32] about a gathering of perfect people.
[1:49:36] It's not about just where we come in
[1:49:39] here and it's like a club or a click or
[1:49:42] a community.
[1:49:44] I'm afraid too many times that's what
[1:49:46] it's become.
[1:49:49] It's so easy to where things can become
[1:49:51] that way. It can become a routine.
[1:49:56] We don't want to be routine Christians.
[1:50:00] We want to be led by the spirit of God.
[1:50:02] That's the privilege as sons and
[1:50:04] daughters of God.
[1:50:07] And I just right here this morning, just
[1:50:09] within these few moments and broken up
[1:50:12] thoughts, I wonder is there hearts and
[1:50:16] lives right here this morning? maybe
[1:50:19] alive that hasn't come into that place
[1:50:21] that says, "I want
[1:50:24] I want to lay my life down." Maybe
[1:50:26] you've not repented.
[1:50:28] But repentance is not just something
[1:50:30] that a man necessarily would walk you
[1:50:33] through,
[1:50:34] but it's something that you're
[1:50:35] experiencing in your heart where your
[1:50:38] heart is being touched.
[1:50:40] Conviction,
[1:50:42] your heart is being pricricked and you
[1:50:45] realize, "Lord, I'm standing in need."
[1:50:48] It might be that very thing that God is
[1:50:51] leading you
[1:50:53] to.
[1:50:56] And the enemy may have just tried to
[1:50:58] bring confusion and you feel like I've
[1:50:59] I'm so far beyond that. But that that
[1:51:01] might be the very catalyst
[1:51:05] that will lead
[1:51:08] to the cleansing
[1:51:10] and to the filling of the spirit of God.
[1:51:14] Friends, that's what we want.
[1:51:17] We want to be fully
[1:51:21] filled Christians.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Even to where that maybe there's things
[1:51:27] in your life you can say, brother
[1:51:29] Samuel, the wantto's have been taken
[1:51:31] away.
[1:51:32] The prophet said it like this in the
[1:51:34] message one. He said, I'm convinced that
[1:51:36] many of us have just received enough of
[1:51:38] the Holy Ghost where we don't want to
[1:51:40] drink, we don't want to smoke, we don't
[1:51:42] want to do this, we don't want to do
[1:51:43] that. And he says, "A matter of fact, we
[1:51:45] don't want to do nothing."
[1:51:48] But he goes on to say, "God wants to
[1:51:50] fill every fiber."
[1:51:52] I thank God. I thank God for every work
[1:51:54] that he does. Justification, that's an
[1:51:56] experience. That's a portion of the Holy
[1:51:58] Ghost right there. But it's not the
[1:52:01] seal. I thank God for the saint for
[1:52:03] sanctifying power. That's more of the
[1:52:06] Holy Spirit,
[1:52:08] but it's not the filling.
[1:52:11] But it gets the vessel set in order
[1:52:14] and ready to be filled.
[1:52:18] Maybe that's where you're at this
[1:52:19] morning
[1:52:21] and you just say, "Lord,
[1:52:25] I want to be ready cuz I want to be
[1:52:26] filled." So if there's something in me,
[1:52:29] Lord, that's hindering, every head
[1:52:31] bowed, please. Every eye closed. If
[1:52:32] there's something that's hindering the
[1:52:35] Lord God, show me. Cleanse me, Lord,
[1:52:39] because there is nothing, nothing
[1:52:44] that's worth missing,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; having you being the leader inside of my
[1:52:49] life. I want you to be the Lord of my
[1:52:51] life, go through every door. Lord, if
[1:52:54] there's a door in my life that I've not
[1:52:55] allowed you to come in, a room, show me,
[1:52:58] Lord,
[1:53:00] show me, Lord. If it's a room that I've
[1:53:02] overlooked, maybe it's pride, maybe it's
[1:53:04] selfishness.
[1:53:07] Lord God, search me. I want you to be
[1:53:10] the Lord. I don't want you to stand on
[1:53:11] the welcome mat as my savior. I want you
[1:53:13] to be the Lord of my temple. So Lord, I
[1:53:16] invite you.
[1:53:18] Maybe it's in your music. Maybe it's in
[1:53:20] your associations.
[1:53:22] Why don't you just invite the Lord right
[1:53:24] there? Brother Samuel, invite him there.
[1:53:27] He went to Matthew's house. Matthew was
[1:53:29] a tax collector.
[1:53:31] and he went there to get Matthew.
[1:53:36] Why don't you just invite him in and
[1:53:38] say, "Lord,
[1:53:40] I need deliverance. I need cleansing,
[1:53:42] Lord."
[1:53:46] Oh God,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; THERE IS CLEANSING POWER IN THE BLOOD of
[1:53:50] the lamb. Blessed be the name of the
[1:53:53] Lord. Oh, right here this morning,
[1:53:56] friends, let's reach out. Let's draw it
[1:53:59] in while he's passing by. Let's take our
[1:54:02] opportunity in the presence of God.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:09] Maybe you're sitting right here this
[1:54:10] morning.
[1:54:12] Maybe lived above every one of those
[1:54:14] things.
[1:54:16] But here you say, "Brother Samuel, it's
[1:54:19] just not real to me.
[1:54:24] It's just not real.
[1:54:26] I hear you preach about the flesh
[1:54:28] struggling and sometimes the flesh wants
[1:54:30] to stay away and from church and things
[1:54:33] like that, but this is different,
[1:54:34] brother Samuel.
[1:54:36] I need this is more than just my flesh
[1:54:39] I'm battling.
[1:54:41] I need I need the real filling of the
[1:54:45] Holy Spirit.
[1:54:48] Maybe God maybe listen friends, God can
[1:54:51] even take that in your life and settle
[1:54:53] you right here, right now. If you've had
[1:54:56] a question about it in your life, the
[1:54:57] Holy Spirit can bring a settling
[1:55:01] in your life here right now. Cuz God
[1:55:03] don't want you wondering.
[1:55:06] Well, I know this kind of ministering
[1:55:07] and preaching, oh my, it causes to
[1:55:10] examine.
[1:55:11] It caused every one of us to examine our
[1:55:13] lives. And it should. It should because
[1:55:17] this is where we're at where I I want to
[1:55:20] be sure. I want the Holy Spirit to
[1:55:23] examine every part of my life.
[1:55:26] Lord God, if there's something you see
[1:55:28] in me that's not right, Lord, show me.
[1:55:30] Lord, show me. Lord, take it out of me.
[1:55:33] Maybe there's something that's crept
[1:55:35] back into your life, a habit, and the
[1:55:37] enemy has wanted to make you so ashamed.
[1:55:42] You say, "How do you say, Brother
[1:55:43] Samuel, it's not the Holy Spirit?"
[1:55:44] Because the enemy would want to make you
[1:55:46] ashamed to hide.
[1:55:48] And that devil wants to remain hidden.
[1:55:51] But the Holy Spirit is calling you and
[1:55:54] saying, "You're my daughter. You're my
[1:55:57] son.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; I'm here to break that spirit from off
[1:56:01] of your life.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; I'm here to restore you back into full
[1:56:05] fellowship. I'm here to move down in
[1:56:07] your life and to do for you. Not only to
[1:56:09] cleanse your life, not only remove that
[1:56:11] habit, but I'm here to bring a real
[1:56:13] filling into your life." Glory be to
[1:56:16] God.
[1:56:17] Oh friends, if he wasn't ashamed to come
[1:56:20] down into the pig pin where the prodical
[1:56:22] son was at, Jesus has never been ashamed
[1:56:25] to come where we're at.
[1:56:28] But the enemy wants to always try to
[1:56:30] bring fear, wants to try to hide. But
[1:56:32] I'll tell you right here this morning,
[1:56:33] as a son and daughter of God, why don't
[1:56:35] you just expose him?
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just expose him? If
[1:56:40] there's an area that he's crept back in
[1:56:41] your life, maybe you've been on journey.
[1:56:43] Maybe the spirit of God here it was in
[1:56:45] your life through justification,
[1:56:47] sanctification, and here there's things
[1:56:49] that's returned right back into your
[1:56:51] life. But listen, you don't have to
[1:56:53] remain that way. You don't HAVE TO
[1:56:55] REMAIN THAT WAY. YOU WERE MEANT TO BE
[1:56:57] FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE
[1:56:59] JOY OF THE LORD TO BE A PART OF YOUR
[1:57:01] LIFE. YOU WERE meant to be a real real
[1:57:05] son and daughter of God.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:09] Satan, you're a liar.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; My Lord Jesus has already defeated you.
[1:57:19] You that has wanted to bring torment and
[1:57:22] try to hold things over people's lives
[1:57:25] would even like to run them while the
[1:57:28] ministering of the word is going on.
[1:57:32] But right here in the presence of the
[1:57:35] Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:57:38] my Lord Jesus has already defeated you.
[1:57:42] And he's come
[1:57:44] to remove you from hearts, lives,
[1:57:49] spirits.
[1:57:52] Oh heavenly father,
[1:57:54] grant it Lord this morning.
[1:57:58] Grant it Lord.
[1:58:01] Grant it Lord God. May you give courage
[1:58:03] Lord to hearts.
[1:58:05] May you give courage to lives Lord God
[1:58:07] to step beyond hallelujah
[1:58:12] their own feelings. Step beyond fear.
[1:58:16] Grant Lord I pray.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, what a moment like this. I I
[1:58:22] wouldn't want to I would not want to
[1:58:24] walk out of this service and know that I
[1:58:26] had missed an opportunity. Well, you
[1:58:30] don't want to wait one more day. You
[1:58:32] don't want to wait another time. You
[1:58:34] don't want to try to go another service.
[1:58:37] You may not have another service. I'm
[1:58:39] not begging you, not persuading you. I'm
[1:58:41] not pulling you. I just say it like
[1:58:43] this. If there's a tug in your heart
[1:58:45] right now, why don't you respond to that
[1:58:47] tug? Why don't you respond to that?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; The altar is open place right here. I'll
[1:58:53] be glad to pray with you. But I want you
[1:58:55] to understand it isn't all together of
[1:58:58] my hands. Yet I believe that the spirit
[1:59:01] of God, it travels right through here.
[1:59:05] But your heart say, "Lord, make my heart
[1:59:08] a place for you to come, Lord."
[1:59:12] Maybe, as I said, maybe it's for things
[1:59:14] in your life that's hindered from the
[1:59:16] Holy Spirit coming, but right here
[1:59:18] today, you say, "Lord, that's what I
[1:59:20] want."
[1:59:22] Hallelujah.
[1:59:24] Glory be to God.
[1:59:26] Amen.
[1:59:28] We're going to we're going to we're
[1:59:30] going to just worship him.
[1:59:33] If you if it's on your heart, I'll be
[1:59:35] glad to pray with you. I know there
[1:59:36] might be many other needs beyond just
[1:59:38] what I have mentioned, but I want to say
[1:59:40] this. We want to go on with God wherever
[1:59:44] it might be. Maybe it's something that's
[1:59:46] hindered you. Maybe you've already been
[1:59:48] filled with the spirit of God, but
[1:59:50] something has hindered you. Maybe it's a
[1:59:52] lack of forgiving somebody,
[1:59:55] but the spirit of God is here to remove
[1:59:58] that.
[2:00:00] Hallelujah.
[2:00:02] Can we just worship him?
[2:00:04] Maybe you need to surrender your life to
[2:00:06] the Lord. Maybe this is that moment for
[2:00:08] you. Let's let's take this day of
[2:00:11] opportunity.
[2:00:13] Let's take this moment, this privilege.
[2:00:16] We've invited the Lord Jesus here this
[2:00:18] morning. Let's welcome him. Let's
[2:00:22] welcome him. Lord Jesus, you're welcome.
[2:00:24] Lord,
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; you're welcome. Lord God, yes, Lord
[2:00:29] Jesus.
[2:00:31] Hallelujah.
[2:00:32] Granted, Lord God.
[2:00:35] Hallelujah. I'm crying
[2:00:39] save.
[2:00:45] Oh my s.
[2:00:53] Oh Lord, hear
[2:00:57] my
[2:00:59] humble.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hear my humble cry.
[2:01:05] Oh yes, Lord.
[2:01:09] And
[2:01:11] while
[2:01:13] while
[2:01:15] others
[2:01:17] thou
[2:01:19] are,
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; oh Lord, thou
[2:01:23] art calling,
[2:01:25] oh to
[2:01:29] not pass
[2:01:32] me
[2:01:34] back.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] Amen.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, pass
[2:01:45] me not.
[2:01:47] Oh, gentle
[2:01:50] say.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[2:01:57] please hear.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's calling friends.
[2:02:06] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:09] Oh,
[2:02:12] and while
[2:02:18] others thou
[2:02:20] are called,
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; thou
[2:02:24] art what holy
[2:02:28] do
[2:02:31] not pass
[2:02:33] me
[2:02:35] by.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:39] Oh
[2:02:43] saveior
[2:02:49] my precious.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Lord please hear
[2:03:00] my
[2:03:02] heart.
[2:03:05] Oh cry.
[2:03:10] Oh and while
[2:03:15] while
[2:03:16] others
[2:03:18] out
[2:03:20] are calling.
[2:03:26] Oh, to
[2:03:31] not pass
[2:03:33] me
[2:03:35] by.
[2:03:38] I just can't help but think, friends, I
[2:03:40] I just don't believe that God would lead
[2:03:42] me in this way.
[2:03:45] God would bring a word like this.
[2:03:48] And our hearts would not. I don't know
[2:03:52] to what degree the response,
[2:03:57] but I believe that God in his mercy has
[2:03:59] come down. As I told you, I'm not
[2:04:02] pulling. I'm not persuading. I don't
[2:04:04] believe in that. But I believe if
[2:04:06] there's conviction and there's things
[2:04:07] that where you can look at in your
[2:04:08] heart,
[2:04:10] don't walk out of here when you know
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; that you need to really surrender your
[2:04:16] life to God. Hallelujah.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, years. It
[2:04:21] don't matter how many years. Brother
[2:04:23] Samuel, I've been in the message for
[2:04:25] years. It's not about how many years
[2:04:26] you've been in it. It's about has it got
[2:04:28] in you.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; That's what it's important, friends.
[2:04:34] God, the Holy Spirit don't take anything
[2:04:36] from us. But at the same time, if
[2:04:38] there's things in our life where God is
[2:04:40] dealing with your life, it might be one.
[2:04:42] It might just been one.
[2:04:47] But the Holy Spirit,
[2:04:50] God God don't make no mistakes.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; God is faithful to his word.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; He's faithful to minister to what we
[2:05:00] have need of. And you know what? All
[2:05:01] around this room right here, there's
[2:05:03] brothers and sisters that I'll tell you
[2:05:06] what. If there's anything that is
[2:05:08] pulling for a believer and pulling for a
[2:05:10] life, it's a brother and a sister.
[2:05:14] We're here because we want to make sure.
[2:05:18] Lord, I want it all to be settled.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; I want everything to be settled.
[2:05:24] I want to be ready to go. I want not
[2:05:28] just only to be ready to go, but I want
[2:05:29] to live a life of victory.
[2:05:33] I want to live a life in my life to
[2:05:36] where my life it actually is something I
[2:05:38] don't have to tell somebody I'm a
[2:05:40] Christian. the life.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; It's something that comes into my life
[2:05:44] when I walk into my home. There's a
[2:05:46] there's a noticeable witness and a
[2:05:48] change that has taken place in my life.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; You don't want to just be around it.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how dangerous it is just
[2:05:56] to be around this message and not get in
[2:05:58] it.
[2:05:59] Is one of these days you'll show up here
[2:06:02] on a Sunday morning and these doors will
[2:06:05] be locked.
[2:06:07] I don't know. Maybe you've got a key to
[2:06:08] get in here. But that's how dangerous it
[2:06:11] is. Is you want to be in an hour to be
[2:06:14] sure that the blood has been applied,
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; that I'm a part of it. It ain't
[2:06:18] something we just want to talk about and
[2:06:20] be around it. We don't want to just talk
[2:06:22] about the word. Not to know the word is
[2:06:24] life. To know him is life.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; It's to know him.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; It's to know him in the power of his
[2:06:30] resurrection. It's to know him that
[2:06:32] changes the very appetite and desire of
[2:06:35] the world
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; out of your life. Amen.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; That's what he does.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We sing this again. If
[2:06:43] you want prayer this morning, I
[2:06:45] encourage you this morning. Amen. To
[2:06:48] come and let's pray. Let's seek the face
[2:06:51] of God. Hallelujah. Let's let's mean
[2:06:54] business with God. I know. I know. I
[2:06:56] know. I know you can touch God right
[2:06:57] there in your seat. I I understand that.
[2:07:00] I understand that. But I also know that
[2:07:03] this is a moment right now that friends
[2:07:06] I as a pastor when I see lives that are
[2:07:10] those are the kind of things that 3:00
[2:07:12] in the morning, 2:00 in the morning and
[2:07:14] I see I see things are faltering. I see
[2:07:17] things where situations and where it's
[2:07:20] we can have excuses to go do this and go
[2:07:22] do that but we can't find time to come
[2:07:24] to the house of God. Something's wrong.
[2:07:26] Something's wrong.
[2:07:29] Something's wrong.
[2:07:32] We're excited to go do this. We wouldn't
[2:07:33] miss this. I wouldn't miss this. But
[2:07:35] missing coming to the house of God,
[2:07:38] there's something wrong.
[2:07:40] Let me tell you what that something is.
[2:07:42] It's called the Holy Ghost. The prophet
[2:07:45] said, "If you have the love of God in
[2:07:46] your heart, you can't wait for those
[2:07:48] church doors to open
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; to get in here." Is that what he said?
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; It sings this an hour. Lord, I want to
[2:08:00] be full of you, Lord.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; I want to be full, Lord.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Every fiber, every fiber of my being,
[2:08:11] while on others
[2:08:15] thou
[2:08:17] art call,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; if you'd like to stand in worship, let's
[2:08:23] do that.
[2:08:25] Do
[2:08:27] not pass
[2:08:30] me
[2:08:32] by.
[2:08:34] Oh,
[2:08:36] I'm crying.
[2:08:40] Saveior.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Crying Savior.
[2:08:47] Savior.
[2:08:53] Oh, won't you hear

[2:09:33] Let me at that throne of mercy.
[2:09:36] Oh, let
[2:09:40] me at thy throne of mercy.
[2:09:48] Oh Lord, I'll find
[2:09:54] a sweet
[2:09:56] really.
[2:10:04] Oh, kneeling
[2:10:08] there in deep contrition.
[2:10:17] Oh Lord help
[2:10:21] my unbeat.
[2:10:26] Yes.
[2:10:28] Christ Savior.
[2:10:31] Crying Savior.
[2:10:38] Crying Savior.
[2:10:45] Oh, hear
[2:10:47] my
[2:10:49] home,
[2:10:51] my home cry.
[2:10:59] While
[2:11:02] on others,
[2:11:04] thou are calling.
[2:11:12] Lord be sure you
[2:11:16] pass
[2:11:18] me
[2:11:20] by.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm trusting
[2:11:30] only in thy merit.
[2:11:41] Would
[2:11:43] I see
[2:11:46] thy
[2:11:47] f

[2:11:59] broken
[2:12:01] spirit

[2:12:07] Lord save
[2:12:10] me by
[2:12:13] thy
[2:12:15] grace.
[2:12:19] kind savior.
[2:12:22] Saveior.
[2:12:27] My precious savior.
[2:12:35] Lord, hear
[2:12:37] my
[2:12:39] humble
[2:12:42] my humble cry.
[2:12:49] And while
[2:12:53] others
[2:12:56] are calling
[2:13:01] your soul
[2:13:03] do

[2:13:22] of all my comfort.

[2:13:43] Oh, whom
[2:13:47] have I on earth beside
[2:13:54] thee?
[2:13:57] Oh, whom
[2:14:00] in heaven
[2:14:04] but thee.
[2:14:09] Drying
[2:14:11] savior.
[2:14:17] Christ savior.
[2:14:24] Lord hear
[2:14:26] my
[2:14:28] humble
[2:14:30] my humble
[2:14:32] cry.
[2:14:38] While
[2:14:41] on others
[2:14:43] thou are calling
[2:14:51] Lord please do

[2:16:21] my life.

[2:36:08] to go, God bless you. Amen. The Lord
[2:36:09] watch over you till we should meet

[2:36:13] in prisoners
[2:36:16] chains
[2:36:21] with bleeding
[2:36:23] stripes.
[2:36:29] fall inside.
[2:36:36] Let's pray
[2:36:38] that night
[2:36:43] and in their pain
[2:36:50] began
[2:36:52] to sing.
[2:36:57] Their chains were loose
[2:37:04] and they
[2:37:06] were free.
[2:37:11] Lord, I bless your name.
[2:37:18] Oh, I bless
[2:37:21] your name.
[2:37:26] I give you honor.

[2:37:47] all the truth,
[2:37:50] the way.

[2:37:57] your name.
[2:38:02] I bless

[2:38:12] hour.
[2:38:17] If you
[2:38:19] should find,
[2:38:24] you're in a prison
[2:38:32] in your mind.
[2:38:38] Reach out
[2:38:40] and pray.
[2:38:45] defy
[2:38:47] those chains.

[2:40:18] your name.
[2:40:23] I bless
[2:40:25] your name.
[2:40:32] There is none like you.
[2:40:40] No one else can touch my heart like you
[2:40:45] do.
[2:40:49] I could search for all eternity,
[2:40:53] Lord,
[2:40:55] and I'd find there is none like you.
[2:41:03] Oh Jesus,
[2:41:06] there is none like you.
[2:41:10] Yes, Lord.
[2:41:14] No one else can touch a heart like you
[2:41:18] do.
[2:41:22] I could search for all eternity,
[2:41:26] Lord, and I'd find there is none like
[2:41:32] you.
[2:41:35] Yes, Jesus,
[2:41:38] there is none like you.
[2:41:45] No one else can touch a heart like you
[2:41:50] do.
[2:41:53] I could search for all eternity,
[2:41:57] Lord, and I'd find
[2:42:01] there's none
[2:42:03] like you.
[2:42:08] I find there is none like you.
[2:42:18] Where would I be?
[2:42:23] You only know.
[2:42:28] I'm glad you see
[2:42:33] through eyes of love.
[2:42:38] A hopeless case,
[2:42:42] an empty place.
[2:42:46] If not for grace,
[2:42:51] where would I be?
[2:42:55] You only know.
[2:42:59] Glad you see
[2:43:03] through eyes of love
[2:43:07] a hopeless gaze
[2:43:12] and empty peace
[2:43:16] if not the grave.
[2:43:20] And Lord I thank you for the things now
[2:43:25] can see.
[2:43:28] You were that shelter in my storms of
[2:43:32] life, the shield surrounding me.
[2:43:37] And I thank you for the mercy you
[2:43:42] provideed.
[2:43:45] Lord, I know you could have walked away,
[2:43:49] but you stayed a thousand times.
[2:43:54] Amazing
[2:43:56] grace,
[2:43:58] how sweet the sound.
[2:44:03] Once was lost,
[2:44:06] but now I'm found.
[2:44:10] A hopeless case,
[2:44:14] an empty place
[2:44:19] if not for grace.
[2:44:23] And Lord, I thank you for the things I
[2:44:27] now can see.
[2:44:30] And you were the shelter in my storms of
[2:44:35] life, the shield surrounding me.
[2:44:39] Lord, I thank you for the mercy you
[2:44:44] provideed.
[2:44:48] Lord, I know you could have walked away,
[2:44:51] but you stayed a thousand times.
[2:44:57] Amazing grace.
[2:45:00] And how sweet the sound.
[2:45:05] Once was lost,
[2:45:08] but now I'm found.
[2:45:13] A hopeless day,
[2:45:17] an empty place
[2:45:21] if not for grace
[2:45:25] or a hopeless case.
[2:45:29] An empty place
[2:45:33] if not for grace.
