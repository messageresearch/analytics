[Music] and have your way as we wait we and as [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] it's such a blessing to be able to have that request and that request is in trueness to have your way because that's the that's the real reality when redemption has come and God is restored and restoring us back into that relationship that fellowship where he communes with his children lip to ear that's a blessing it's it's by His Word by his character this is this that that very promise of John 5:19 I the son can do nothing but what do you see it the father doing that doeth the son likewise that is a promise that is reserved solemnly for the elect of God for the elect because it's God he reveals to his elect it's not something that we have made ourselves in that wonderful it's but it's God sovereignly that has chosen and it's God being able to communicate with his children amen in that wonderful Amen that is such a it's such a privilege in this hour and you know that that is the that's that's a thrust that's a goal of God coming back and becoming one of us is to restore that fellowship that we might have that true fellowship with him in that wonderful and you know in order for that to happen you see for God to be able to reveal himself it comes down to there must be a submissive life so God showing this with the submissive heart a submissive life and here this in here the promise is made manifest because how can God show himself to us if we're not willing but because there were because of that what I was the submissiveness it's what is there but it must be him bring the condition out so that we might walk pleasing it's all to his glory it's not of our doing it's all to his glory amen our election is not based on our choice it's his choice amen and it's God's choice being acted out we're just so so thankful it's just so good to see each and every one of you here tonight and I asked I asked brother Jerry the other day if he would just go ahead and take the service here tonight for Thursday evening I want you to also keep in prayer with the trip that we have coming up here to the Philippines we leave out on next Tuesday the Lord willing and we they had just been talking about some of the the weather that is taking place I guess the possibility of a typhoon coming in there in Japan and that's where we have to land first of all and I just received an email that let me know that if I want to you know take the tickets and do a weather waiver I can do that but I'm gonna wait on him because I you know I'm just resting in what I know what God has been brooding upon my heart so I just I'm just asking you if you just be in prayer that God because you know look God turned that that storm that was coming here in the States and where it was supposed to be such and it caused devastation that's true but it was not the category 5 when it came in like they said it would be it lessened that to a category 3 so let's just I ask you just to pray and you know look if it's not if it wouldn't be for God's will for us to go I'd be happy just stand right here I'd be happy but you know III just ask you to pray I believe I believe God has been orchestrating it all but we want to be in prayer for that also with sister Elizabeth Collins I didn't get a chance to some of you probably no doubt know of that and heard of it but when we had prayer for her here on Thursday and then many other Saints around the world brothers and sisters you know and it's just so wonderful coming together around the calls and around the need and you see where the sister the report I've got on Sunday is her her blood count was up and brother brother Collins had sent me a video you know of her the of the the walking and she's taken to the steps and everything that's been taking place her levels where the doctors had you know completely just given up to just come for care the levels have been restored she's back on to the lung transplant list and you know this is when things like this take place we don't want to recede with our prayers we're thankful for what God is doing but that it should also be at that time don't let it don't let it slip but let it intensify amen because we just don't want the Kings to lay there we want to take their heads off is that right we want to take their heads off so it's got to be a complete deliverance so let's just keep that in prayer for for her and just that God you know look however God is going to do it it's nothing for God but you know to see that in the midst of this time here how that God's faithfulness and God continues to move for our sister in a very special way and so let's just continue to hold to hold her up in prayer and looking to God just for a complete healing and just talked also to brother or brother Dave and sister Shirley today and sister Shirley you know just speaking with her they just wanted to say they certainly appreciate your prayers and you know she had had another setback it was going into last week so they had been a third time we're trusting the grace of God that they've got it right this time and you know above all things that the Lord would just strengthen her you know she said I'm a she said now I'm going back to the square one eight weeks I have to look look at things eight weeks again you know but she said within it all you know one thing about it when you call brother David sister Shirley man they encourage you he's like who in the world needs encourage here I mean they just man I get off the phone I'm charged I mean I think the lord have mercy I I called it just you know just to say hey we love you we're praying for you and man I got off the phone I'm encouraged you know you get off the phone you think where's the devil at you say for the same you what is that it's - it's you know friends what's glorious is the even that God would be that we would be able to be in a place to say Lord let my attitude be sweetened and be right in the midst of the test and of the trial that that is victory right there that is victory right there because as we look at and started looking at that on we got this little cocklebur apart but that wheat life on the inside that is the greater is he that is in us and we got a pool we got to put a check make on that cocklebur oh every once in a while because the wheat life never gets an attitude we live never gets one is the cocklebur a part of us that gets checked but the wheat life rises up in authority under the word it says get back here that's glorious amen well let's let's stand and brother Jerry we'll just invite him on amen I may believe that God knows what you have need of God knows what we have need of here tonight we have need of more of him we certainly have needs within our life and I believe that God is is here and present to direct the servant of the Lord to even form the words of what needs to be spoken to you and I for what we have need of what is it it's the great shepherd himself coming right among us and ministering to our needs in that wonderful that God can walk right among his children and feel free to walk right here among our lives this is what we want amen let's sing that song again have your way have your way and your way and you're let it be a prayer that can be a request Holy Spirit and have your [Music] [Applause] [Music] how look it's good to be back here with you in tonight and maybe it seems like I just can't stay away but I appreciate your prayers as was brother Samuel was saying for trip that we got going to the Philippines and I appreciate you keeping us in prayer while we're there and during our travels in the country there amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father were thankful to be here tonight Lord we're thankful Lord that our confidence is in unity of God and not in ourselves Lord and not in any man but in you Lord Jesus Christ Lord we ask that you would move the Lord in our mist tonight there God may you anoint me in such a way Lord that I may follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit and thereby being able to be a help and extra thin until the people Lord we ask all these things and Naim and ask you to receive the glory in Jesus name Amen you term of being your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 and I want to read the first three verses there to start out with and to get a draw text from it now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear you may be seated and what I would like to speak on tonight is possessing the unknown possessing the unknowing brother branham if you can remember the message of stand in the gap where the Braun was talking about how that he thought that he would be like the Old Testament prophets and he would just go out into the wilderness and wait until God gave him something to say to people and then come in and say it to the people and go right back out into the wilderness and God spoke to him and told him he said you're called to a higher calling than that of the Old Testament prophets he said you got an apostolic calling besides that said you have more gifts than they have they had and he's but the Lord asked him when he was talking to him about this he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward and brother branham explains that he was waiting every time for for thus saith the Lord before he would move and we think well how could that be a negative thing well he was he was waiting until God would more or less push him before he would go and do something and he then the Lord spoke to him also and he goes over it and standing up how he says you're like Moses you've lost the feeling for the people because brother Branham was while he was waiting on God to push him to go somewhere he was letting the sick people lay and the Lord remind him you're called to pray for the sick and brother Branham said that what it was he had built up a complex because that the people wouldn't hear or listen to the message and he would preach and and would come back it was like it had no but I thinking on that and I looked at questions and answers and I look at questions answers on the seals and I realized that by the questions many of the people had not moved up into the revealed word of that day and I realized that when God sends a prophet and he brings a message it's not only geared just right for that moment but it's for it's for all the people that will ever hear it of that age Paul what we know was a messenger to the envision age yet Paul didn't even live during that time but it was his ministry that after he was gone his ministry went on and affected and influenced that age the believers in that age God never sends a message what it doesn't accomplish a purpose he sent it for brother Branham goes on and standing in the gap and says I'm returning to the field older young live or die I will beg God until death shall set me free and then he goes on to explain how that there was not one flaw in ever in the ministry there was not one flaw in what was ever prophesied or said that it did not come to pass and he said the reason for that was I was always waiting on him but then he goes on this ad says but being on to the church here and to the church hereafter if God pushes a man through a pipe and he don't move it on until God tells him there is no faith connected with it if God it's God pushing you to do something and he says I must go out by faith I must do it by faith whether I think it's right or wrong or what I do the best of my choosing and then go do it because it hasn't been wrong I I don't know if you've ever faced something where you know we pray about everything we do if we're going to buy a house we pray about buying the house before we go to do it if we're going to buy a car we pray about it before we go to do it anything that we go to do specially major things we always seek the Lord's will on it we seek the Lord's will before we go some will be making a commitment to go somewhere and but I don't know if you've ever been in a situation where you asked the Lord for a sign of what to do and instead of giving you a sign the Lord says you make the decision I've been there where God just says you decide and then you think well how I know what decision to make you have to make the decision on faith brother Branham says here I read it again he says I'll do the best of my choosing and then go do it now when brother Branham was going back out in the field he wasn't going by vision he didn't get a vision but it was just the Lord's talking to him and showing him what had happened and where he was at and how he'd lost the feeling for the people and what is calling reminding of what his calling really was and by that brother Branham took the step by faith and went back onto the field say what's going to happen I don't know but faith in God will possess what you don't know faith possesses the unknown we realized God caused us to a life a walk of faith and faith is not something you can see taste hear or smell or feel but yet it's real it's not a guess or an assumption it's real you but you may not be able to explain it you can't see it you but faith possesses what you don't know at the moment say I I need healing I don't know I'm supposed to go to this doctrine I'm supposed to go to that and they're saying I need surgery for this and I don't know what to do faith will possess the unknown that you are able to put it in God's hands and say you know what I know that he is in control and I tell you this if you make a wrong move God will bring your footsteps back on to the right path but it is a walk of faith it's not a walk of knowledge it's not a walk of understandings it is a walk of faith faith doesn't concern itself with the details now I want to go back to Hebrews 11 and start at verse 6 and it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing whether he went so what God called Abraham and called him to go forth and then didn't even tell him where it was going but Abraham had to walk by faith knowing that God would you God would direct his footsteps as long as you're standing still there are no footsteps to be directed but when you're moving then there's then God can direct the footsteps of the righteous it goes on to say by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob and heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God so Abraham was looking for a city he went for that he didn't know where he was going but God would guide him as he went on his way he had to walk by faith knowing that God said go God told him to leave where he was God told him to separate himself from from his family of course we know that it took the Lord taking the life of Abraham's father for Abraham to get separated from him and then it took a real falling out among the herdsmen of lot and the herdsmen of Abraham before he would part ways with lot but God wanted him to separate himself from all that and go forward and and as Abraham went forward like I said his first footsteps he took he still kept his father with him that was wrong so God guided his footsteps and got him back on the right path to where God put him to where he would separate did separate him from his father and he done the same thing with with concerning lot in the herdsmen and so forth that Abraham and made the decision to go forward and still carry a lot with him but God didn't want lot to go with him but the point is that Abraham went forward he might have made mistakes along the way but God wasn't looking at the mistakes cause God can correct that the mess of perfect faith brother Branham says perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it now just watch when you're believing anything and doing anything you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is they don't have one thing to do with it see it masters that circumstance that's how you can possess the unknown you take possession of what you don't know by faith knowing that faith will conquer every circumstance every circumstance you face everything that comes your way whatever stands in your way faith will master that circumstance that situation I know it's against our human nature faith is against our human nature and it's against the car carnal thinking and the Bible said that our carnal thinking was an enemy we get to facing something as as flesh and blood humans we we would like to know how is just going to work out give me some assurance that it's going to work out it's by faith you have to claim it but we want to know well how are you going to do it Lord like as if I will have more confidence if he explains it to us but God doesn't come down and reason it with us he has his way and whatever way that God is going to do it you will be the beneficiary of it if we if we could do it all way we would not be have any benefit at all it would be become a detriment to us he said if I was in the room of sickness and the Lord revealed a certain thing was going to happen you just speak it and go on just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going see it masters the circumstances it's already got it mastered faith believes that God will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow it masters are all circumstances you know anybody can have can claim to have faith on the other side of the trial once you've come through it you can claim to have faith you can always claim to have faith when you're on the mountaintop but down in the valleys where you need faith going through the trial or the circuit that's where you need faith it's easy to give God the glory once you've come out on the other side of it but what we ought to be able to do is give him the glory why we're going through it knowing that he is going to bring us through it and he knows the best way to do it but see we get fearful and we let fear kind of grippers but brother Branham says faith and love is in a relationship with one another and the Bible tells us perfect love casts out all fear and he says faith and love works together so if we know that we have the right kind of love for God we know that he has the right kind of love for us we have that confidence then jesus said if an earthly father knows how to give good gifts to his children how much more would our Heavenly Father know how to give good gifts to his children sometimes you'll hear amongst perhaps maybe I've heard monks do nominal believers and I've heard among sinners that they would say well if if there was a God or if God really cared that he wouldn't allow this to happen he wouldn't allow these things that happened to children or he wouldn't allow these he wouldn't have allowed for death to come and take my loved one I don't have a thing to do with it one thing if you're not in Christ then you're not under the protection of the blood but if we're in Christ then we're under the protection of the blood and there's nothing can touch us unless God allows it we could look at all the things that happened to Joel and if we looked at him and tried to reason we would say how could any of that been for jobs good but what it did was it mature job spiritually and that's what's important your natural life is not what's important it's your spiritual life and your spiritual walk with God that's what's important pardon me back to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 13 says these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth verse 17 says by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from which also he received him in a figure now when God told Abraham to do this God didn't come down and say now Abraham this is what this is all about this is going to be a pre figure of Calvary this is going to be a pre figure of God allowing his son to be sacrificed for the sins of the people God didn't come down to explain it Abraham yet what Abraham was dillmouth Isaac was a pre figure of that Abraham didn't even benefit from the from the pre figure of it immediately it wasn't till he was set free and resurrected and set free from paradise Abraham went to his grave and he couldn't necessarily look at what had happened with him and Isaac like we can see it that is he revealed to us today God doesn't always explain what he's doing there's things that will happen in your life that could end up being for someone else's good but God didn't sit down and explain that to you he just goes ahead and does it proverbs 3:5 and 6 says trust in the Lord with all that heart lean not to thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths brother Adam says in the prepper message of preparation he says don't depend on your knowledge and don't never try to figure anything out that God says if you could figure it out or I could figure it out worth but any other preacher could figure it out we would be equal with God we're not supposed to we're never will be able to figure it out because when we can figure it out it's not faith anymore we've got to accept it by faith is that right God said so I don't know how I can't tell you how he's going to do it but he's going to do it cuz he said so that's the basis God is going to do it because he promised he'd do it he's God and he can't break his promises remember says that's how it is and he says he goes on to say here and some of God's preparations has been so ridiculous to the people who depend on the tree of knowledge I don't want to be dependent on the tree of knowledge but if we're to if if we're leaning toward our own understanding and we're not able to stand there by faith in what we are leaning toward is the tree of knowledge if we think we come to us God will how you going to do it what we're actually doing is we're trying to go to the tree of knowledge God's not going to explain it to you because then it wouldn't be a walk of faith anymore you have to have faith he's gonna take care of your God doesn't come down and say now I am going to explain this you so that you understand that I am going to take care of you so you'll believe me because that's not how faith works we don't believe it because we see it we don't believe it because we understand it we believe it because we trust in Almighty God that's faith I mean not your own understanding he says if I could tell you how it was done then it wouldn't be no more faith I don't know how it's done I don't know but I believe it I know how God saves a sinner or excuse meaning we reread this he says I don't know how God saves the center but he does it I don't know how God does any of these things but I accept it that he does it and that's the way look at the people that brother Branham had to withstand that didn't believe in divine healing why wasn't they didn't believe in it because they didn't understand it they were looking to understand it instead of just accepting by faith that God is a God that heals his people because I can't explain it never will be able to explain it no one can because if you do then it's normal faith the Missis forgotten buta 2d goat he begins to talk about John the Baptist and how you know that John had when he was thrown in prison and he began to wonder is he really the Messiah or not and brother Branham talks about how he said that'll eagle his bill and his eyes they got kind of crusted / but he says here in the Forgotten beatitude he said so Satan was trying to get John to disbelieve so John got to his disciples together and sent him out and John thought could I have been wrong is he really the same one I know the sign was right I seen the messiah-king I know that was right but this meek and lowly and all this I don't get it I can't figure it up I can't make the ends meet with it well the man says you're not supposed to make the ends meet see John was looking at he thought he was going to come forth ferocious as a lion he was going to come forth in judgment and here he was meat and lowly John was scratching his head now I thought that it was going to beat this way and he was a prophet but he was human he was human so don't get down on yourself tonight if you've been trying it went struggling with this thing don't get down on yourself you're human but take encouragement from this you're not going to be able to figure it out you're not supposed to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says don't doubt believe it take all doubt away from me don't wonder what if Abraham tried to wonder what if Jonah in the belly of the well tried to wonder what if all the other heroes of faith wondered how is it going to be think about it but they walked by faith not knowing what the outcome or how it would be they didn't become heroes of faith as we call him because that they understood everything that was going to happen it was because they possessed the unknown they took possession of what they didn't know by faith you don't take possession of it by it through understanding or figuring it out you take possession by believing that God is going to master whatever it is and that your faith is a master of that circumstance as long as you can figure it out it's not faith anymore it's got to be something you can't figure out it's got to be something you can't figure out because if you could then you wouldn't be walking my faith and that's the whole foundation of the believer is to walk by faith [Music] Villa Brennaman myths of time-tested faith he says face is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen he said now faith is not a myth it's something you actually possess then he give us an example he says like if I was starving and someone asked me what could I do for you that you wouldn't be starving said well if I could have some bread he said if they handed me 25 cents with the day that wouldn't get you much but at the time he speeds is that they'd hand me 25 cents he says then I have as good has got the bread because I've got the purchasing power of the bread he possessed the bread by faith because he had what it took to get it we possess the unknown by faith because we have what it takes to get it what is that the promises of God God said he would take care of us he said if he can take care of the of the birds of the field that how much more if he can take care of the flowers of the field then how much more could he take care of his children and he said he would never leave us nor forsake us not even till the end of the world so we don't have to worry about the world's ending or not and someone contact me it was one of the children that we had adopted they contacted me through a text message back when we were supposed to have that Eclipse remember that and they contacted me and said they think the war they thought the world was coming to an end and they were hoping they had time to get right and asked if they could come to church I never even responded you say he didn't respond no because I knew it wasn't sincere it was all about that Eclipse guess what I never heard another word from him after the Eclipse happened and went by and the world didn't end but just from what he said I hope there's still time for me to get right in other words I'm gonna ride out sin right to the end and maybe right at the end then I'll give myself to God that will never happen a child of God yet even while in sin once he is and knows of being saved and salvation he'll come he won't say well I'll just keep riding this one out and I'll come in right before it's all over no that's somebody who's enjoying sin and pleasure for a time brother Branham says here concerning what I was talking about he says well I haven't got the bread yet but I got the purchase power of the bread I might be a mile from the bread but I can be just as happy with that quarter in my hand as I can when I got the bread in my hand because I got to purchase power of the bread and when faith is anchored that's it's finished you're just as happy as if it's already jumping and the shouting because it's over he said you're just as happy going through it as if when it got over you know you'd be jumping and shouting it was over don't feel guilty about being happy once you come through something I'm not saying don't give God glory once you've come through it but let's be able to give him glory also however going through it I know we got that feeling that I know what that feeling of complete relief is when you come out on the other side of a deep dark trial but if by faith you can possess the unknown you can have that relief in the midst of the trial he said when faith is anchored it's finished you're just as happy as if you was already jumping and shouting because it's over you have it it's something you know you've got nothing can move it you never watch for any evidences or anything you just know you have it how many he's ever laid out of fleece before the Lord sure I imagine we probably all have it sometime another you know you think when Gideon laid out the fleece and when they said well let the let the dew fall on the ground all around but let the fleece be dry you think that had been enough for you but then he says well let the dew fall on the fleece and the ground be tried we don't need to lay out any fleeces before God I'm not condemning you if you have we all have but we don't need to look for any evidences we claim it by faith it says here in this message briefs in 62 said when you've got the key there's no fear there's no doubt there's no question you don't have to ask anyone else about it you know exactly you've got it in your hands you know what to do with it you know what the score is you know the door is going to unlock you've checked the levers and you know it's strictly the right thing the door is going to fly open when you throw the key into it now what I'm one thing on a planet says you don't have to ask anyone many times when we get to facing something our first thought is to talk to somebody about it you know kind of get what do they think about it or maybe when x we're looking for some sympathy because as a human your first thought wants to be why me why is this happening to me what did I do and when when that thought comes to me tonight then I always do think of Joel Joel didn't do one thing except deserve God's confidence in him as I was with Moses he says now Joshua and all his knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless he could be what we'd call reckless as long as he was pointed the right way he might break up against a hill that would knock him backwards but he would he was headed the right way possessed me I don't go forward move forward God will direct your steps here he's talking about Joshua me bounce off this hill or bounce off that one but he's going to end up on the right path but then the reason is because he's not standing still so can the Church of the Living God would be reckless and fearless in faith if were pointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you nor forsake you he never forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he would not fail Joshua and he will not fail us he'll be with us in that message of as I was with Moses brother branham is bringing out the point he's trying to get across this that that Moses in all of his life and author all of his mistakes through all of his failures there all of his breaking up and and and and things and maybe even blowing the wrong way at times but God was with him and that's what the point brother Branham was trying to get across he said as I was with Moses so will I be with you we make mistakes but he's still with us he corrects our steps I just read one place here a couple of weeks ago where brother Brandon was saying there is times that we will even willfully do something that's wrong he says does God disown us because of that no he says you're gonna get some correction but he says if your child he says my children would do it they'll go against the rules sometimes he said but they that doesn't make him not my child it just means I'm gonna correct them and he said that's the way God is with us see I say that because Satan is always right there just ed up see you knew you should have done that you knew better why do you think he's gonna forgive you now you knew better you know that's the definition of iniquity well we're children you're in the service of perseverant where the randomness is it's coming toward the end of the service and he says there's a lady sitting right back here to my left right here at the end of the road she's suffering with trouble with her ears do you believe God will heal you and make you well lady you that's looking at me you believe he'll heal your ears and make you well you do all right have you a prayer card you don't have a prayer card well you don't need one see that's the unknown faith that you have you didn't even expect it hardly but faith is a hidden thing so your faith can go beyond your natural awareness and make connection with God [Applause] 2nd Corinthians 4 and 18 says while we look not at things which are seen but at things which are not seen were the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal we can possess what we can't see we can possess what we can't feel that's what we mean when we say we're not going by emotions that's not to say we're emotional is whether we're not supposed to show any emotion but we we don't live our life by emotions if we came into church and decided whether we were going to enter into the song service or not based on whether we feel like it how often would we not be entering into the song service but we do it because he's worthy not because we feel like he's worthy of our praise whether we human ly feel like doing it or not amen I've seen people that maybe have trouble with their legs and interest if you have them standing up a wild than they they have trouble 'take a sit down that's not disrespectful but if you're asked to stand and you stay in your seat and you you actually can physically get up then that's disrespectful - whoo - god I'm gonna have you stand at the end of service the same standing sings well I'm not really feeling the anointing right now brother Jerry singing anyhow hey man if you could only worship God when you're having a good feeling while he's not getting the glory from it brother Brennan was asked a question he talked about this and looking to the unseen he was asked a question the woman rode him and said that she had been in a prayer line and have been prayed for and healed of cancer and she said that that for the first two to three days she was feeling good but then after on the third date she she became very feeling very off on her stomach upset and and all these things that she said is you have I lost my healing and brother branham tortoises know that's a perfect sign that you have your healing and I says God can perform a miracle I've seen him do it and heal someone of cancer and the dirt and the growth just instantly disappear but divine healing is to accept it by faith and that life dies he says that growth has a life in it a demon and when the demons cast out of it then that dies and now you've got a hunk of dead flesh and sure you're gonna feel sick cuz you got something there that don't belong there he said that's a sure sign that you're healed that's divine healing I know we would prefer the miracle but faith you know a lot of people say well it takes it takes a lot of faith to have a miracle no but it takes more faith for divine healing listen to this this is a message called the second miracle preaching 51 he says some people has great faith like this and anything can happen the next has faith that deep and it takes a little longer the next has faith that deep and it takes a little while some has faith like a mustard seed but if it's mustard seed faith genuine faith hold on to it just keep believing it it'll become Marvel faith and then it'll become great fruit faith and then to become Mountain faith it'll brand-new right out if you'll stay with it Satan will bombard you and he'll send you jobs comforters at times to try to discourage your faith but brother I'm saying even if you feel like your faith is real small just keep holding on to it it'll grow and he'll bring it'll brand you through it hold on to it it'll bring you right straight to the light if you'll stay with it don't be discouraged and don't believe symptoms symptoms that's the devil's lie a man symptoms is the devil wide it surprises me sometimes when I've run across people who have their medical books you know they don't have a degree they just got this medical big old medical book you know oh I've got this symptom let me look that up all my look what I've got don't claim that stuff don't go by them symptoms Jonas says talks about lying vanities that's what it is lying vanities an axe 20 and 22 Paul says and now behold I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me they're saved that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me neither count on my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the Ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify of the gospel of the grace of God now Paul says he went for it not knowing the things that was going to befall him if you read about this in the book of Acts you'll see that Paul goes forward and then he goes into Jerusalem and while he's in Jerusalem witnessing of the Lord the Jews said about to kill him and a captain comes by with his troops and takes pause and this one asked him to be bound and changed and says what is this man accused of and then Paul is delivered from one to another and then the captain they're going to have him scourged and Paul then says you can't scourge me because I'm a Roman citizen and then the Lord speaks to him and says as you have testified of me in Jerusalem so shall you testify and witness of me in Rome but see Paul went forward not knowing these things were going to happen but he said the Holy Ghost gave witness and as you read through those next following chapters you'll see that there was different ones where Paul went and dwelt with him a few days that they'd said bad things were going to happen and Paul even told him here he says this will be the last time you seem face but Paul said he wasn't moved by any of that because he knew he Paul was going forward believing that he was supposed to go to Jerusalem not knowing what all would happen and there was Otis said something bad is gonna happen Paul don't go and they tried to persuade him not to go but Paul says I'm not moved by any of that he went anyway because Paul felt to go and give witness of Jesus Christ when Paul got there Paul begins to tell them how he met the Lord Jesus on the road to Damascus how he appeared to him in a great light and how Ananias was sent to pray for him and laid hands on him and he received his sight Paul give us this testimony and witness of Jesus Christ changing his life and the Jews sought to kill him for it murder Paul taught him he says I'm a Pharisee of Pharisees the Bible says this caused much dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees because you know the Sadducees they didn't believe in the resurrection that's why they were sad you see the Pharisees they did believe in the resurrection at least so they were fair you see but it caused dissension among them and then Paul talked how that he had been schooled at the feet of humility in the law and all these things but see they thought Paul now the very ones that he was persecuting paul says i persecuted them i was there with the martyr Stephen I held the the coats of the ones that stoned him he said but now I am turn to testify of him the devil didn't like that remember when he was there with that captain and and the Jews were gonna hast they they got about forty of them together and said plotted that and made a vow that they would not eat until they had killed Paul and Paul's sisters son found out about the plot and came in told Paul and Paul directed him to go tell the captain because they were going to ask the captain to bring him forth that he give testimony and then they were gonna kill him when I was there but see the Lord was watching out over all of this conflict between God and Satan brother Branham says what if Abraham had been asked what the doctors would come and say Abraham you're a hundred years old your wife's ninety how are you going to have a baby he says what if Abraham and said well I've got an understanding of this now we're going to drink a certain thing and then after we drink it then it's gonna make an effect in our bodies and then where he says no he said Abraham would answer to something like this I don't know no more than you know but one thing I know he said we were going to so I believed him [Applause] continuing for the faith the RAM says God is to be received by faith not by knowledge you might read the word through and know every word of it and still being lost I could say the same thing about the message of the hour they could be able to know the message of an hour and build a quote that probably said this and the Prophet said that and the Prophet said this and still be lost because just like people do with the Bible they can take and twist things whether Adam said and put their own slant and interpretation on it I'm going to do that that's certain death you can't figure it out it's my faith are you saved and that through grace not of works lest any man should boast and the message of Moses preached in 1950 brother Branham says maybe there's some of it you do not understand frankly friends there's much of it I do not understand I just accept it don't never try to figure God out you can't do it God's not understood by knowledge God is understood by faith is that right what if Peter would have tried to figure out how deep the water was how impossible it was for him to walk on the water he never would have walked see but he just took Christ at his word and walked on and you just take him at his word tonight and if you maybe be a sinner and don't understand how to take God at His Word then God sent me here and I want you to take my word for it and see if it doesn't come to pass that God take my word for it what God sent me here for you to be healed I like this brother branham talks about a man they called him Mose and he said Moses carried his Bible everywhere he went and said if people would make fun even say Mose you can't read it why are you carrying he said cause I believe it he couldn't read the Bible but he believed it that's faith and so they to make further fun and they said well what if he would tell you to jump through that brick wall what would you do he said I jumped they said well how'd you gonna get through it he said I'd jump he'd make the hole and I got there [Applause] brother Brown goes on to say he says so that's the thing we have to do is take God and believe it jump anyhow if you could explain it understand it it wouldn't be faith no more faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you don't see it you can't figure it out there's no way to figure it out you just got to believe him and keep walking on he said so that's how I stand in the pulpit for the visions he tells me to do certain things that seems humanly impossible and you all know that it's humanly impossible but he said do it just go on he's the one to take care of it and he'll do it How Great Thou art there was a man brother Branham talks about that his son was in the hospital dying and they had took the the cardiogram and the way that it registered they said there's no hope for him and the doctors telling the father this but the father would just seem to be joyous and happy and the nurse then as the doctor went out the nurse essence I I'm afraid you didn't understand what the doctor said he said no I understand what the doctor said she says well I've never seen anyone that this shows up this low on this raft and then live he says we'll see there's the problem you're looking at that cardiogram he said but I'm looking at the promises of God and my son is going to be healed you know there was brother Brandon talks about this and standing in the gap there was a service that he had many of you heard about it brother Wei was there him and his wife I had I had privilege to meet them when I was a boy and hear his testimony brother waist testimony but they were there in the service and brother Wei just fell out into the floor he died right there and brother Branham was quieted the people and walked down from the platform down there and began to pray for brother Wei and he was asking God to be merciful to him but the venom says in another place that brother Wei it took a wrong attitude concerning something that he'd said and that's why that it happened but he was asking God to be merciful to him and God raised him back up I not that I could compare to anything such as that but I remember one time and it got this got me to thinking about it that we were sitting in our living room and my son Nathaniel had this little kitten and it was just young I don't know how old it was but it was about yay big you know and it was there had been playing in the floor and we had a couple brothers from the church was over visiting with us and all of a sudden the kitten just fell over dead in the floor and Mina hollered at me real quick she said don't let that cat die in front of the children and so I've knelt down and scooped the kitten up and I didn't know whether to take it out of the room or what to do and then I thought I'm gonna pray for it and as soon as I went to go pray for it a thought bombarded me and said you prayed for your dog and it died anyway God didn't raise it up I had this dog I know that I pulled off but I love very dearly and we took him for surgery and she ended up when we got her home she had a blood clot that wouldn't killed her and I I sit in the floor with that dog of my life just crying and crying and begging God to bring her back but it didn't happen and so this thought bombarded me to remind me of that and then it said you're just gonna embarrass yourself in front of these brothers Church so then then there was another thought kind of me said what would brother branham do and you know what I said he would just believe so I didn't pray I just believed and set the kitten down and it came back to life [Applause] just believe that's all you got to do to possess the unknowing it's just believe Satan will always be there to try to bring doubt but here's the thing don't the well on the thoughts that he gives you they're always negative you can always pick it out then it's not God and don't think it's your own reasoning it's Satan trying to get you to reason don't reason with him amen we walk by faith not by sight amen we possess the unknown by faith amen hallelujah god bless you let's stand what if we could sing that song looking for a city no gee dad always something here go to the course no that's not the song that I was thinking of looking for a city where we'll never die where the Saints and billions never [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to appreciate the world award tonight God was come how to come down and shakey Dhoni was how to come down you know I so many times a year year brother branham and I always loved that part over the years as I listened to message invisible Union I always loved the prayer requests with bream said Lord come search our hearts tonight and he said Lord don't leave my heart out search mine too Lord this this is truly when you you think of the word and how that God has spoke to us tonight the word has search this out it's a word that encourages and strengthen us it's a word that divides it's the only thing that can divide you from you is the word it brings a separation it brings encouragement amen because the enemy is always there is the things that brother Jared mentioned where he would come and you inspire and try to speak through that flesh and then he turns right around and wants to bring condemnation and he is the inspirer behind all of that I believe the Word of God is very clear to us casting down those thoughts you can always tell when it's when it's a thought from the enemy it wants to trouble you God's thoughts don't trouble you they direct you understand God's the God's thoughts do not put you in a place and trouble you but the enemy that's his objective to put you in a place like that but God's thoughts are always that of leadership it can point where we are and where we need to be and His grace to lead us all the way you know I just was just to just today I was when I was talking to brother Davis you know brother Dave the David kress I said you know I said when I first started out serving the Lord I said I always looked at faith I said you know when you're facing tests and trials I said that faith was you had everything man you know it's just a faith was just you know it's really real strong it's something that you were aware of I said but I have found out more more over the years that's so contrary it's not what we know that we have a hold of it's what has a hold of us to where that we don't know in the midst of everything how everything's gonna come out but God knows God is in control amen he abideth Faith Oh aren't you glad tonight amen I tell you what this is this is real good teaching of the word brought right down into our hearts and lives thank God for that amen tonight you got to be able to stand right there and just put it right back in the devil's face and giving giving order and direction to our life you know what this is this is the promise brother Graham says now that we've been saved and filled with the Spirit of God now let us be transformed by the renewing of our minds to the mind of Christ what is it it's gone washing us taking us away from our ideas and our thinking and it's his mind having preeminence and that wonderful saying Lord Jesus let it be Lord let me be so separated Lord from my thinking my ways and let it be his ways Amen Alleluia let's sing this tonight let's sing it before we go he's got it
