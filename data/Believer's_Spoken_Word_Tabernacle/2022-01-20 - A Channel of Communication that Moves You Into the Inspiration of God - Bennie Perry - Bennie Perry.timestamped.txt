[40:22] see and i like to read verse 42
[40:26] two through five
[40:31] and i like what job said here
[40:34] he said i know that thou could do
[40:36] everything
[40:38] and that no thoughts can be withheld
[40:41] from thee
[40:42] who is he that hides counsel without
[40:45] knowledge
[40:46] therefore have i uttered
[40:48] that i understood not
[40:51] things too wonderful for me
[40:54] which
[40:54] i know
[40:56] knew not
[40:57] here i received thee and i will speak
[41:01] i will demand of thee and declare
[41:04] thou unto me
[41:06] i've heard of

[41:46] need you and without you we can do
[41:48] nothing lord any man can turn the pages

[42:08] a channel
[42:10] communication
[42:12] that moves you into
[42:17] the inspiration of god
[42:20] here the prophet says here he said he
[42:22] had a channel of communication
[42:24] to god
[42:26] that he got
[42:28] by inspiration he had a way of moving
[42:31] himself out
[42:33] and letting god move in
[42:36] and he knew know that he knew that he
[42:38] was justified it was a gift it is a gift
[42:42] it says like uh it don't have to be a
[42:44] prophet or that was a divine gift
[42:48] or to serve god's people with everybody
[42:50] is not ordered to be a prophet
[42:52] everybody's not ordered you know to be

[57:57] and all you know how brother i'm very
[57:58] emotionally that cried and said you know
[58:00] getting all the said the devil said and
[58:03] he's saying
[58:05] he love you
[58:07] [Music]
[58:10] and he just started crying with it and
[58:12] all of a sudden he said something's
[58:13] inside of me
[58:15] somebody says satan get behind me
[58:18] why because the holy ghost come on the
[58:21] insider then that communication with god
[58:24] he knew god that he was the word
[58:29] you got to know who you are
[58:31] you may be a human being amen but you
[58:33] have a channel
[58:34] of communication
[58:38] that you move into
[58:40] when the time comes you say and the
[58:42] reason why you don't know you move into
[58:44] it because guess what it happened so
[58:46] fast
[58:47] gloria you don't know you've done the
[58:49] right thing and said the right thing
[58:51] it's always been that way you don't
[58:53] believe that
[58:56] what about isaiah that's right
[58:59] isaiah going along this time
[59:01] now listen it was not written on no
[59:03] pages
[59:04] he didn't have no evidence that he could
[59:06] go back like we said we could say isaiah
[59:08] said this look there's a virgin's
[59:10] conceived and we can go and find out
[59:12] that it happened
[59:14] isaiah didn't have that
[59:16] he was going along one day and then all
[59:18] of a sudden he got the pretty let's save
[59:20] all a lot of brothers around him that
[59:22] died
[59:23] go he said y'all guess what a burger
[59:25] shall concede
[59:27] isaiah now wait a minute
[59:30] ain't no there you can see but see he
[59:32] had a channel
[59:34] of communication with god and god could
[59:37] come through that channel and tell him
[59:39] something that seemed like it was it was
[59:41] crazy it's beyond the human mind but yet
[59:43] it was thus saith the lord 700 years yes
[59:47] sir you know what that happened
[59:49] when isaiah spoke it right
[59:53] didn't look like nothing happened
[59:56] and god just kept working
[59:58] is she here yet no
[1:00:02] 200 years went by is she here yet
[1:00:05] i'm just using this drummer time guards

[1:00:12] you say wait a minute well let me say it
[1:00:13] like brother brown said mary wasn't the
[1:00:16] only one it was many versions in that
[1:00:18] land
[1:00:18] many versions many of us did she wasn't
[1:00:20] the only one and as she got there all of

[1:00:58] bride what he's about to do he revealed
[1:01:01] the secrets unto his servant the prophet

[1:06:53] that i love i justify all that i call i
[1:06:56] sanctify god god knew her life was

[1:07:22] wrong you were born in sin
[1:07:25] we forget to quit quote that sometimes
[1:07:28] shaping in a nickel did come in the
[1:07:30] world
[1:07:32] and the only one that happened
[1:07:34] isaiah couldn't do it moses couldn't do
[1:07:36] it there was none righteous no not one
[1:07:39] and god had to create his own body
[1:07:42] about it all you listen to
[1:07:44] god created on his own body where he
[1:07:47] could walk in that body
[1:07:48] live in that body it was it was the word
[1:07:51] was made flesh
[1:07:52] and god took that but why because glory
[1:07:55] he wanted that body to condemn sin in
[1:07:58] the flesh
[1:08:01] corey yes sir the word
[1:08:03] was made flesh
[1:08:06] he said i don't have a husband he said
[1:08:08] that's right
[1:08:11] but let me ask you something
[1:08:13] i'm gonna use this terminology he said i
[1:08:15] hang around the church
[1:08:17] and i hear about you know
[1:08:19] about prophet this prophet that
[1:08:22] and the campus and then preaching about
[1:08:23] the messiah gonna come
[1:08:25] and the messiah is gonna be here
[1:08:28] and says and i heard about that
[1:08:30] says uh now
[1:08:32] and when the messiah come he's gonna ask
[1:08:34] a lot of questions that we have
[1:08:36] yeah she said i got a problem
[1:08:40] when the messiah comes you say you ain't
[1:08:41] got to talk no more i'm the one that's
[1:08:43] speaking to you
[1:08:45] i am the messiah
[1:08:47] glory that's what god you mean to tell
[1:08:50] me she was caiaphas and all that he says
[1:08:52] no i am the messiah but the time is
[1:08:54] coming and now is that the true
[1:08:56] worshiper and listen it's still the same
[1:08:59] thing that david had changed the true
[1:09:01] worshiper will worship the father in
[1:09:03] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:09:05] seeking such to worship him
[1:09:09] glory yes sir
[1:09:11] channel
[1:09:13] inspiration amen
[1:09:15] glory
[1:09:17] when isaiah said the virgin shall
[1:09:18] conceive
[1:09:20] that word went right and it went
[1:09:23] and it traveled and it looked like it
[1:09:26] wasn't going to be fulfilled that's
[1:09:28] right god liked to take his time
[1:09:31] because nobody rushed
[1:09:33] that's right i think reverse god you
[1:09:35] can't make god do nothing
[1:09:38] lord some people think they can tell god
[1:09:40] who to save and who not to say
[1:09:43] oh don't get quiet
[1:09:47] they did too much to even be in church
[1:09:50] let's see it's god's choice
[1:09:54] god makes his decisions that's right
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:56] that church say man we forget that
[1:09:58] sometime
[1:10:00] pray but it's god's calling
[1:10:03] the channel
[1:10:04] when that channel
[1:10:06] is open
[1:10:07] inspiration
[1:10:09] and while
[1:10:11] isaiah has spoken

[1:16:34] in the beginning
[1:16:36] what's the word i like that amen this

[1:16:56] said you may not be a prophet you may
[1:16:57] not be this but god give you a channel
[1:16:59] of inspiration that you can move into it

[1:17:22] when that centurion
[1:17:24] when he came
[1:17:26] and jesus was
[1:17:28] casting out devils down the centurion
[1:17:30] he he didn't come there for no church
[1:17:33] service

[1:17:36] soldier he had to watch jesus just
[1:17:38] didn't draw a few people he draw crowds
[1:17:40] hundreds of them
[1:17:41] so the centurion out there they said you
[1:17:43] make sure he don't cause no trouble
[1:17:46] you get out there and just watch
[1:17:48] everything what's going on
[1:17:50] and he was watching jesus and people
[1:17:52] come up
[1:17:53] jesus said you're healed
[1:17:56] cancer is gone glory
[1:17:58] he was praying for people that be healed
[1:18:02] and the centurion got a word back from
[1:18:04] his house one of his servants was at the
[1:18:07] point of death
[1:18:09] and listen glory
[1:18:11] jesus

[1:18:51] getting ready to go home
[1:18:53] it says yo servant was healed he didn't

[1:31:59] changed
[1:32:00] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:32:02] forever
[1:32:04] do you believe that
[1:32:07] there's a channel
[1:32:08] of communication
[1:32:10] by inspiration now brother brandon was
[1:32:13] preaching this message and when he went
[1:32:15] to it what he was trying to find figured
[1:32:17] out you thought he was talking about job
[1:32:19] all the things that joe uh manifested in
[1:32:22] how god dealt with job
[1:32:24] but what the message is dealing with is
[1:32:27] how he had the communication the channel
[1:32:29] was open
[1:32:30] and what god was telling us
[1:32:32] is we have that same channel open to us
[1:32:35] sometimes inspiration you don't know why
[1:32:36] gloria you do something but isaiah
[1:32:38] virgin shall concede he didn't think
[1:32:40] about it right
[1:32:42] i got a few more of my notes here if you
[1:32:43] don't can i take a few more
[1:32:46] can i take a few more
[1:32:48] we think about like j like a
[1:32:51] uh joshua
[1:32:53] told joshua listen
[1:32:55] as i was with moses so shall i be with
[1:32:59] you no man to stand before you all your
[1:33:01] days be of good courage but let me say
[1:33:03] it like this stay with what moses said
[1:33:06] a lot of people have a problem because
[1:33:07] they don't stay with what the prophet
[1:33:09] said
[1:33:10] [Applause]
[1:33:11] that's right glory that's right
[1:33:14] and so joshua
[1:33:16] when he when he when when uh
[1:33:19] he walked out
[1:33:21] and this big man
[1:33:23] come in front of him
[1:33:25] had his sword drawed you know joshua
[1:33:27] didn't
[1:33:28] he probably would stop ringing back and
[1:33:30] i said
[1:33:31] you know what god told me no man stand
[1:33:33] before me all my days
[1:33:36] and when they the man had a sword draw
[1:33:38] joshua grabbed his sword and hit look up
[1:33:40] at the man like this are you boss before
[1:33:43] i have it sarah
[1:33:45] glory
[1:33:46] he wasn't afraid
[1:33:48] because he knew he had dust said the
[1:33:49] lord he had the word good but just
[1:33:51] because you have the word you got to
[1:33:53] have a strong arm of faith don't hold it
[1:33:55] right there with the devil go and cancel
[1:33:57] whatever it is you got to have faith to
[1:33:59] hold that word there
[1:34:02] and the man put his sword back he says
[1:34:04] no
[1:34:05] i'm the captain
[1:34:07] of the host in other words i'm the
[1:34:09] five-star general
[1:34:11] i come down the lead to see a church
[1:34:13] that y'all that i call you to do i come
[1:34:15] down and lead it to the promised land
[1:34:18] and joshua recognized that gloria
[1:34:20] god told him god so he in other words he
[1:34:22] wanted to make sure that joshua
[1:34:24] understood what his commission was
[1:34:29] so go down there and destroy ai
[1:34:32] that's right
[1:34:34] can you imagine
[1:34:36] sister nick he had a
[1:34:38] when god told joshua to go and destroy
[1:34:40] a.i
[1:34:42] he said i want it done listen god say i
[1:34:44] want it done today not tomorrow not next
[1:34:47] week
[1:34:50] and he started to fight the war was
[1:34:52] getting dark getting dark the kid was
[1:34:54] going how many can win a war in one day
[1:34:57] god said i want you to do it in a day
[1:34:58] today
[1:35:00] and josh was standing fighting the men
[1:35:02] fighting everybody fighting the sun
[1:35:03] start going down it's getting dark
[1:35:05] getting dark getting dark and brother
[1:35:07] you know be like some of us here lords
[1:35:09] will i'm a rex tonight we'll come back
[1:35:10] in the morning
[1:35:12] no not not god told joshua i want it
[1:35:15] done today
[1:35:16] and joshua didn't know what to do how
[1:35:18] could i get this finished today
[1:35:20] and he moved into the chapter of
[1:35:22] inspiration he said son stand still
[1:35:25] come on moon they go to valley as well
[1:35:27] and immediately stop and he fought and
[1:35:29] destroyed the enemy that day
[1:35:32] and the bible said never have god ever
[1:35:34] listen to a force of a man like he did
[1:35:36] that day
[1:35:37] but when god told you to do do something
[1:35:40] if you follow it he's going to back you
[1:35:42] up
[1:35:45] joshua moved into that channel of
[1:35:46] inspiration you know people want to be
[1:35:48] born again
[1:35:50] glory
[1:35:51] the holy ghost
[1:35:53] god more than able really want to give

[1:37:32] heals and cast out devils and i had
[1:37:34] crippled people i don't have them i went
[1:37:36] to jail to tell the testimonies
[1:37:38] don't worry about that i just like to
[1:37:40] preach to god for going let the holy
[1:37:41] ghost go but many times crippled
[1:37:44] i got a brother in my church right now
[1:37:46] living with no
[1:37:47] the doctors
[1:37:49] he had a massive stroke
[1:37:51] you know him
[1:37:53] he don't even have no artery to take his
[1:37:55] blood to his brain
[1:38:00] but this message but this god
[1:38:04] but jesus christ
[1:38:05] still have him living
[1:38:07] still having i let him give you
[1:38:09] testimony he liked it he liked to tell
[1:38:10] it he was out
[1:38:12] they thought he wasn't going to make it
[1:38:14] and this is what he said and while he
[1:38:17] was in there he said his only thing he
[1:38:19] said lord he said all of a sudden he
[1:38:21] said jesus came in there and said you're
[1:38:23] going to be all right
[1:38:26] and he said what and he said he's out
[1:38:28] now he's out it came back a couple of
[1:38:30] days later but
[1:38:32] what gets me is this
[1:38:35] we were crying
[1:38:37] i was sad
[1:38:39] one of the deacons is his best friend he
[1:38:40] said he went and he turned his head said
[1:38:42] i can't see it no more blood it came all
[1:38:44] out of his mouth
[1:38:47] praise god we thought and i'm be honest
[1:38:49] i thought he wasn't gonna make it either
[1:38:52] but that was what god thought
[1:38:56] and so i said afterwards it's been a
[1:38:57] couple years now he's still going fine
[1:38:59] and so he went down the doctor to say hi
[1:39:01] in the world we need to get that vein to
[1:39:03] get that break and i said
[1:39:05] his name is joey i said brother joseph
[1:39:08] i said where you going to get the
[1:39:09] operation for i said if you're already
[1:39:11] kicking and
[1:39:12] you ain't got no nothing going up there
[1:39:14] don't let the doctors put nothing up
[1:39:16] there god god got something in there you
[1:39:18] need no operation you're still living so
[1:39:21] god can make god can make a way out of
[1:39:23] nowhere
[1:39:24] and the brother is living
[1:39:27] what you call that big bang go up there
[1:39:29] i forgot what you call it anyway what'd
[1:39:31] he call it
[1:39:32] yeah and he and he said brother
[1:39:35] i said hi in the world of god i said
[1:39:37] well let me tell you something i read in
[1:39:39] the message one time that there was a
[1:39:41] lady brother branham prayed for they
[1:39:43] didn't have a liver
[1:39:45] you can't live with no liver
[1:39:48] but i guess what if god get in there you
[1:39:51] can live with no liver no heart no
[1:39:54] nothing if god before you who can be
[1:39:57] against you
[1:39:58] god give us a chance of inspiration
[1:40:01] we're in that channel of inspiration
[1:40:04] in that channel
[1:40:06] you can touch god glory john as we close
[1:40:09] listen
[1:40:11] martha said something that i like
[1:40:14] brother branham said it like this she
[1:40:15] says martha
[1:40:17] when she first met jesus
[1:40:20] she complained about everything right
[1:40:23] she complained about this complaining
[1:40:24] about lord mary ain't helping me do this
[1:40:26] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:40:28] not helping me do this mary need to do
[1:40:30] that why she ain't helping everybody and
[1:40:33] and when she went to jesus complaining
[1:40:35] about mary doing brother brother branham
[1:40:37] says
[1:40:38] jesus told
[1:40:40] martha said martha martha
[1:40:43] you are troubled about many things
[1:40:45] you have a legitimate thing to be
[1:40:47] controlled about but mary has chosen the
[1:40:51] better part
[1:40:52] she decided when it was time to come to
[1:40:54] church she wasn't going to be home
[1:40:56] cooking
[1:40:57] she decided when it's time to come to
[1:40:59] church she wasn't going to be cleaning
[1:41:01] the house she decided when it's time to
[1:41:04] come to church she wasn't gonna be at
[1:41:05] walmart she was gonna come and sit at
[1:41:07] the feet of jesus
[1:41:09] glory
[1:41:11] hallelujah
[1:41:14] that was the better part yes sir
[1:41:18] but he says
[1:41:20] martha kind of listened
[1:41:22] said after martha
[1:41:24] when lazarus died he said monster broke
[1:41:26] through
[1:41:28] glory sometimes you know you look at
[1:41:30] people that kind of struggle along but
[1:41:31] just to let them stay there a while
[1:41:33] they'll break through
[1:41:34] once the channel of inspiration opens
[1:41:35] till they realize you know what
[1:41:38] god is with me also
[1:41:41] that's right

[1:41:54] god i'm going to see the god

[1:42:01] enemy not some every enemy jesus
[1:42:04] conquered death hell of the grave he
[1:42:06] conquered everything why because he was
[1:42:09] god manifested in flesh but also he was
[1:42:12] a seed of god and he was a seed of
[1:42:13] abraham the not the natural seed the
[1:42:16] spiritual seed
