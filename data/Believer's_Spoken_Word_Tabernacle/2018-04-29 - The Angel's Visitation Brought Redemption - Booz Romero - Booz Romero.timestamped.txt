[44:03] your show was by Jericho that he lift up
[44:06] his eyes and looked and behold there
[44:11] stood a man over against him with his
[44:14] sword drawn in his hand and Yasha went
[44:16] unto him and said unto Him art thou for
[44:19] us or for our adversaries and he said
[44:22] nay but as captain of the hosts of the
[44:24] Lord I am now calm and Joseph fell his
[44:26] face to the earth and did worship and
[44:29] said unto Him what saith my lower unto
[44:31] his servant and the captain of the Lord
[44:33] of the Lord's host said unto Joshua lose
[44:36] thy shoe from all times food for the
[44:39] place whereon thou standing is holy and
[44:41] Yahshua deeds so you may have your seats
[44:45] now we go to the book of a Hebrews
[44:47] chapter 11 verse 30 and 31st it says by
[44:54] by faith the walls of Jericho fell down
[44:56] after they were compassed about seven
[45:00] days by faith the harlot Rahab perish
[45:03] not with them that unbelief that believe
[45:06] not when she have received the despised
[45:09] with with peace amen
[45:11] now got the book of James chapter ii
[45:14] chapter
[45:30] amen and it rates ladies it says live
[45:35] was also was not Rahab the harlot
[45:37] justified how it works
[45:38] when she can't received the messengers
[45:40] in had send them out out another way for
[45:44] as the body without the Spirit is dead
[45:45] so faith without works is that also amen
[45:48] may God the blessing to the reading of
[45:51] his word and so we're happy to be here
[45:53] in the house of the Lord and certainly
[45:56] happy to be here it's been I think it
[45:58] was almost a year at the last time that
[45:59] I was here speaking for you but these
[46:02] this time like we're gonna see what
[46:04] dollar has for us this morning in men
[46:06] and as I was saying before I prayed it
[46:09] is always a privilege to be here and
[46:10] that is a Christians privilege to be
[46:13] here and and to speak to his children
[46:15] amen so I was thinking you know by God's
[46:20] grace I would like to title this Rahab
[46:22] the Angels visitation brought Redemption
[46:25] gray have the angels visitation brought
[46:29] it brought or either started Redemption
[46:32] or he brought the redemption in men so
[46:34] but before I go there I would like to I
[46:37] was thinking about something and brother
[46:40] Branham II speaks and you you know the
[46:43] ones that read the message he speaks
[46:45] about a specific like me and his name
[46:49] was Oscar and he was he was part of he
[46:51] was an Indian amen
[46:53] so one time brother branham went and he
[46:58] went to the you know the Indian
[47:00] Reservation and then Oscars mom was sick
[47:04] amen
[47:04] so she was sick so they they asked the
[47:07] as brother branham could you come and
[47:09] pray for her mother and brother branham
[47:12] when the airing he pray for for for for
[47:14] the monday the mother of oscar and she
[47:18] was healed amen
[47:19] and but there was some there was one
[47:22] more thing it wasn't just oscar there
[47:24] was his sister she was Lewis yeah her
[47:30] sister was Lewis Louis Amen so and she
[47:35] was there as well
[47:35] in and when brother Branham was praying
[47:37] you know she kept the praying the prayer
[47:40] in what once that that was
[47:44] happening you know the next day brother
[47:46] Branham came and told her well you know
[47:48] she was she was also praying the Lord
[47:49] sprayer in brother Branham told her
[47:52] well you I just want to make sure that
[47:53] you understand that that we have to pray
[47:56] we you don't have to we we don't just
[47:58] have to say the prayer the Lord's Prayer
[48:00] in key talking because he told her
[48:03] because we're not Catholic and then she
[48:06] was like yeah and then this is this was
[48:08] hit her answer she said we know more
[48:11] Catholics she said we believe like you
[48:14] believe and we want you to take us all
[48:16] you and we want you to take all of us
[48:19] all of us in baptize us the way you
[48:21] baptize we want the Holy Ghost that was
[48:25] the first thing and then her brother
[48:28] Oscar he lost some of his horses and
[48:31] then he he came to brother Adam and said
[48:34] can you pray so that then I can find my
[48:36] horses and Imbler Elam was was like you
[48:38] know what where they are they are in a
[48:40] place where there's a lot of us know
[48:41] even in the middle of the summer so you
[48:43] may not be able to find them but he said
[48:45] if he God was able to heal my mom he can
[48:48] also find my horses so now I want to
[48:51] connect this and then brother Branham
[48:54] says these how you know internet talking
[48:59] about the horses he says how they leave
[49:01] nobody knows but at this time of year
[49:04] brother Lewis is speaking now there is
[49:06] some what he's talking about the snow
[49:07] and everything but he found his horses
[49:10] because the prophet of God saw a vision
[49:12] and that he was going to be able to find
[49:14] his horses so he found his horses saying
[49:17] he says but now it won't trade off with
[49:20] a denomination I mean it is only trade
[49:22] with the word or it is only in agreement
[49:25] with the word but there is some people
[49:27] in the world believes that that that
[49:29] word you will take a not to grab the
[49:32] ride out of here
[49:33] Amen it is true it is true for the bride
[49:35] and the broth in the bride and the
[49:37] bridegroom they are one and the God is
[49:41] one in the world in the word is God Amen
[49:44] you have to be traded with the word and
[49:46] it will draw the bride out of these
[49:49] denominations but I want to go I want to
[49:52] go a little bit further here so brother
[49:55] Billy Paul was giving a testimony back
[49:57] in
[49:57] I think was in 1999 and he said he's
[50:04] he's speaking in Tucson Arizona and he
[50:07] says speaking about this Indian boy and
[50:09] his sister and then brother Perry was
[50:12] also there he says and and they brought
[50:16] the horses to wench they found the

[51:14] them and God will give you a good
[51:15] husband sister she said brother Branham
[51:19] I don't think God can't do that and
[51:23] brother I never asked her why and she
[51:26] said because of my past
[51:28] how many can say I have a past and
[51:31] brother Branham talked her do what I
[51:33] have told you and God will give you a
[51:35] good husband she told me brother Billy
[51:38] now sister sister this sister is sending
[51:43] a letter to brother Billy or two rather
[51:45] Billy Paul in and she is telling him now
[51:48] I have a good husband amen but I want
[51:52] you to focus on something else that is
[51:54] coming up here brother Perry was there
[51:56] when brother Branham had the
[51:58] conversation with with the sister which
[51:59] is your Lois and after she left in her
[52:02] horse he asked brother Branham what
[52:06] about the past life of Lois what does
[52:08] that mean
[52:09] brother Branham said whatever he
[52:12] under the blood of Jesus he doesn't even
[52:14] show it to his prophet you will get it
[52:18] this morning if you have a past this
[52:21] morning that is kind of accusing you
[52:24] this morning I did this I did that but
[52:27] if introduced under the blood of Jesus
[52:28] Christ it is not going to be shown to
[52:31] the Prophet it is not going to be shown
[52:33] to be discerned because it's already
[52:34] under the blood how many are happy to
[52:37] know that this morning amen you guys get
[52:41] the point you brothers and sisters did
[52:43] you get at the point if you have come
[52:44] and you and you have confessed and you
[52:46] have ave the word if you have put it
[52:49] under the blood then nothing can be
[52:51] against you this morning brother Branham
[52:54] says he gets sweeter each day it is
[52:57] something that happens and when Christ
[52:59] comes into your private life he changes
[53:02] all your life amen
[53:05] do you welcome him in your life this
[53:07] morning amen
[53:09] this is in the message Jesus at the door
[53:11] is what I just read this and the other
[53:13] one was a testimony from January 22nd
[53:16] 1999 so but now I want to focus on on
[53:19] these but at the end I want to bring
[53:22] this testimony again when I finish this
[53:24] these little talk to you this morning
[53:27] but if we look and now going back to
[53:30] your shrah you will look in chapter 5 of
[53:33] the book of Joshua once they went on the
[53:36] other side of Jordan they got to Jill go
[53:38] in that that is a circle of stones it is
[53:41] what that means and and there were some
[53:44] ordinances by the Lord that they have to
[53:46] do there one of them was to circumcise
[53:49] the ones that were born in the
[53:50] wilderness do you remember that when
[53:52] when they were in Egypt after they left
[53:55] even Egypt then God asked them to
[53:57] circumcise the first time and then the
[54:00] generation that left they also they all
[54:03] have do perish in the wilderness because
[54:05] they were not agreeing with the Word of
[54:07] God amen
[54:09] and the circumcision is to cut the
[54:12] surplus is to cut whatever is kind of
[54:14] remaining in men now in the spiritual is
[54:18] to cut whatever is a surplus in our
[54:19] lives and that is not pleasing before
[54:21] the Lord and his presence and this
[54:24] morning I want to ask you as yourself
[54:26] morning is there still something in your
[54:28] life that the Lord have to come and he
[54:30] have to cut it this morning nothing they
[54:35] were there in the wilderness but there
[54:36] was a new generation that was born in
[54:38] the wilderness amen in that generation
[54:40] needed to be circumcised amen brother
[54:43] Branham says and if he has never
[54:44] circumcised you yet by the Holy Ghost he
[54:47] hasn't received your faith yet that's
[54:50] right he said that's right
[54:52] that is the circumcision of the heart
[54:54] and spirit it is not just something
[54:56] natural but it has to be in the heart
[54:59] and in the spirit of the person the Lord
[55:01] has to come and say you know what these
[55:02] desire I have to cut it but you have to
[55:05] be willing to do it you have to be
[55:07] willing to do it at this sister she said
[55:09] she obeyed the word of the Prophet and
[55:11] that brought her a good reward and in
[55:14] that is the prophecy that also came to
[55:16] the Prophet because it has been your
[55:18] your choice a greater victory a victory
[55:21] in love divine is waiting for you on the
[55:24] other side but but it takes a decision
[55:28] from the heart of the deliverer to say
[55:30] Lord I want to serve you this morning
[55:32] Lord I want to love you this morning
[55:34] Lord I want to forget all the things
[55:36] that live it that are behind me and I
[55:38] want to go and press towards the mark in
[55:41] Jesus Christ that that should be your
[55:44] desire this morning if not let me tell
[55:47] you one thing then you're wasting your
[55:48] time this morning brother Branham was
[55:51] speaking if he was talking he was like
[55:53] when they were in the meeting Billy
[55:55] Graham's meeting great meetings and he
[55:58] was they were just coming and yet we're
[56:00] giving their heart to the Lord but that
[56:02] was it he said like twenty thousand were
[56:04] given their hearts to the Lord but if
[56:06] you will come the next year there was
[56:07] just twenty people as to serving the
[56:09] Lord why because it was something on the
[56:12] surface but I don't want anything on the
[56:15] surface I want something deep in my
[56:17] heart I wanna change in my heart this
[56:19] morning I wonder Lord to come and say
[56:21] and reveal me what is not right before
[56:24] his presence how many can say amen to
[56:27] that
[56:29] he said now if you stop believing and is
[56:32] crumbling around and just believe God he
[56:35] said God will circumcise the heart
[56:38] yaws belief team she says only believe
[56:41] all things are possible and that costs
[56:44] all cuts all the unbelief ether come
[56:47] sizes the world in all unbelief away
[56:50] from you and then you stand the word
[56:53] alone brother pour me pastor but he was
[56:56] preaching in in church he was saying now
[56:58] he it was the first coming on the Lord
[57:01] that was Jesus Christ but then an angel
[57:03] came and then there was a second coming
[57:05] of the Lord and he was asking then who
[57:07] is a coming of the Lord now that is the
[57:09] bride that is the second coming of the
[57:11] law why am I saying this because now it
[57:14] is the world being very flesh in the
[57:16] first of the believer Christ in you the
[57:19] hope of glory amen
[57:22] how many can say amen to that it says if
[57:27] you abide in me and my words abide in
[57:29] you then ask what you will and he will
[57:31] be given to you what is your desire this
[57:34] morning her history hurry right what's
[57:36] your desire this morning and she said
[57:38] the salvation of my two children in he
[57:41] said I give them to you in the name of
[57:43] the Lord Jesus Christ and they came but
[57:47] he you and you need something this is
[57:49] something simple just believe in him
[57:53] but the prophet of God says so we need a
[57:56] circumcision to cook the whole thing
[57:58] away to cookie called the world away
[58:00] from my life my desires my mind my
[58:03] thoughts everything or coming
[58:05] circumcised this morning
[58:07] my desires not wanting to come to church
[58:09] Lord common circumcised that desires not
[58:14] wanting to worship or no one not wanting
[58:16] to lift off my hands Lord coming
[58:18] that is warning me when I leave this
[58:21] place father maybe may I live refresh in
[58:24] my heart saying wasn't my heart burning
[58:26] when the world when the breath was being
[58:28] broken before me but I can say no I am
[58:31] NOT what I want to be but I am NOT what
[58:34] I must be but one thing I know that I am
[58:36] NOT what I used to be that should be
[58:39] your testimony this morning Lord I know
[58:41] I have a past but guess what God is
[58:44] looking at your past that is looking at
[58:46] the present that you have with him in an
[58:49] eternal life
[58:50] is waiting for you there you know that
[58:52] that is eternity is already here now
[58:55] where is that eternity now it is in my
[58:59] heart it is in your heart I was
[59:01] preaching in Mexico and I was telling
[59:03] the people you know why that enemy is so
[59:05] bad with you every single morning do you
[59:08] know why not right now because when you
[59:12] were in heaven he was doing all that
[59:14] that is pleading up in heaven and what
[59:16] is he and what did you do there
[59:18] you didn't follow him to rebuke him and
[59:20] you say you cast him out you were
[59:22] fighting there with Michael with that
[59:24] great mighty my angel Michael and you
[59:27] cast him out of heaven that's what he
[59:30] knows now that you that you are not part
[59:32] of him he's trying to he's making all
[59:35] his best efforts to try to destroy you
[59:37] this morning and one more thing you know
[59:39] why as well because your name is written
[59:42] in the in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[59:43] because when those names were written
[59:46] were being written what was happening he
[59:49] was looking at that so he knew what was
[59:51] in the book but he couldn't take the
[59:53] book he couldn't take the book and where
[59:56] is the book right now this morning it is
[59:58] in my heart it is in my hands now little
[1:00:01] junk come and eat from that book he will
[1:00:03] be bitter in your in your it will be
[1:00:05] sweet in your mouth but he will be
[1:00:07] bitter in your belly but common prophesy
[1:00:09] again one more time so he knew that he
[1:00:13] knows that your name is written in the
[1:00:14] Lamb's Book of Life that's what he's
[1:00:17] making he's trying all what he came to
[1:00:19] come and destroy but guess what you're
[1:00:21] yours kokanee in the palms of his hands
[1:00:24] and he cannot touch you this morning
[1:00:27] I mean you're grateful this morning the
[1:00:30] enemy can touch him that's why Paul says
[1:00:34] Christ it means to lead into thy is to
[1:00:37] gain if I say praise the Lord if I leave
[1:00:40] praise the Lord
[1:00:43] how many can say praise the Lord to that
[1:00:47] I hope when you leave here you live with
[1:00:49] a different song without different
[1:00:52] mindset and say Lord thank you for your
[1:00:54] words thank you because maybe this
[1:00:56] morning I was a little bit defeated
[1:00:58] father but who were have coming how it
[1:01:00] gives me giving me courage to go forward
[1:01:02] to cut to this coming week
[1:01:05] you're just a with the word God made a
[1:01:09] promise God keeps his promise he can't
[1:01:12] do anything else but he keeps his
[1:01:14] promise but he can't do anything else
[1:01:18] but Keith but keep his promise and
[1:01:21] remain God amen
[1:01:24] so as the Lord this money Lord is there
[1:01:26] something that has to be car coming
[1:01:29] caught it this morning
[1:01:31] amen now in the book of Joshua chapter
[1:01:34] 10 verse 12 it says and the Israelites
[1:01:37] in camping juggle and they kept the pass
[1:01:39] and they kept the Passover on the
[1:01:41] fourteenth day of the month at evening
[1:01:43] in the place of Jericho and on that same
[1:01:45] day they ate the produce of the land on
[1:01:48] living cakes and in parts grain and the
[1:01:51] manna ceased on the day after they ate
[1:01:53] of the produce of the land and the
[1:01:55] Israelites have manner no more but they
[1:01:57] ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan
[1:01:59] that year so now now look at this after
[1:02:03] the circumcision and after their bodies
[1:02:05] were healed they had the company have
[1:02:08] communion they had the Passover oh what
[1:02:12] a great thing to know when his Holy
[1:02:14] Spirit has circumcised our hearts now we
[1:02:16] can have communion with him now we can
[1:02:19] come boldly into the throne of grace
[1:02:21] that we can obtain mercy and find in
[1:02:24] find grace to help in the time of need
[1:02:26] that is communion communion comes in
[1:02:29] when you have community here in church
[1:02:31] it brings a strength to your body his
[1:02:33] brain says strength to your soul it
[1:02:35] brings a strength to your spirit so it
[1:02:38] was a Passover it was a it was a first
[1:02:42] for sorry first it was a communion sorry
[1:02:45] first was a circumcision then was a
[1:02:48] Passover and then there was something
[1:02:50] else in Joshua 5:13 it says now when
[1:02:55] Joshua was near Jericho he looked he
[1:02:57] looked up and saw a man standing in
[1:02:59] front of him with a drawn sword
[1:03:01] can your showing up to him and asked him
[1:03:03] are you for our offer or for our enemies
[1:03:06] neither he reply but as a commander of
[1:03:10] the army of the Lord I have now come
[1:03:12] then yoshua fell face down to the ground
[1:03:14] in in rivers reverence and asked him
[1:03:17] what message does my lord have for his
[1:03:19] servant the commander of the Lord's army
[1:03:22] reply take off your sandals for the
[1:03:23] place where you're standing is holy and
[1:03:25] Joshua did so now if you if you read
[1:03:29] chapter five it is without without us
[1:03:32] knowing what the angel told Joshua he
[1:03:35] just saw him take off your shoes that's
[1:03:36] it that's a message take take off your
[1:03:39] shoes
[1:03:40] the only thing that's the only thing we
[1:03:42] know and that was the same instruction
[1:03:44] that was given to Moses in the when he
[1:03:47] was before the burning bush he says
[1:03:49] loose loose off dive lose thy shoe from
[1:03:51] off my from or die foot because you are
[1:03:54] standing on holy ground in other words
[1:03:57] we can say this that was a type of
[1:03:58] humility that was assigned to put away
[1:04:02] their ego or the eye of from Moses amen
[1:04:05] and after Moses he took take a to cook
[1:04:08] it took off his shoes God revealed
[1:04:11] himself to Moses and give him a message
[1:04:14] of restoration what was the message to
[1:04:17] bring for the children of Israel are out
[1:04:19] of the out of the line of Israel or each
[1:04:22] of each Amen there was a message from
[1:04:24] from for for Moses but if you think it
[1:04:27] is start with with the burning bush
[1:04:29] something unbelievable now a burning
[1:04:32] bush is talking to here but there was a
[1:04:33] season for that time because everything
[1:04:37] has to come in the season of the word
[1:04:39] and now if you see to your show was the
[1:04:42] same thing take off your shoes but
[1:04:44] nothing else was said to Joshua so could
[1:04:48] we say that the things that were said to
[1:04:49] Moses were not written amen a type of
[1:04:52] the seven field Moses came and is
[1:04:55] already out of the scene amen now the
[1:04:57] loire have come to reveal himself to his
[1:05:00] people in a personal way that is the
[1:05:03] Seventh Seal the Lord himself shall
[1:05:05] descend a man Jesus have come and have
[1:05:08] left amen but he has sent the comforter
[1:05:12] that have come to reveal him
[1:05:15] in secret to whom to the bride as John
[1:05:22] 14:15 says all things that the father
[1:05:25] huh
[1:05:26] our mind therefore said I that he shall
[1:05:30] take of mine and he shall show them to
[1:05:33] you that was the same way that it was
[1:05:36] with you're sure nobody know what was
[1:05:38] said that is the Seventh Seal speaking
[1:05:41] directly to the heart of the believer
[1:05:43] and the heart of the bride given unto
[1:05:47] her by the Prince of the host of the
[1:05:49] army of the Lord our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:52] now if you see here brother Brennan says
[1:05:58] the man is Tuvan and he drew his sword
[1:06:02] he was just a man he looked like a man
[1:06:06] in your shop her heart being achieved a
[1:06:10] warrior he draw he drew his sword - you
[1:06:13] know because when you're a warrior will
[1:06:15] always be ready with your sword
[1:06:17] he walked to meet him and he told him
[1:06:19] are you with us or are you with our
[1:06:21] enemies
[1:06:23] and the man he lifts up his soaring he
[1:06:26] says no I am the captain of the host of
[1:06:30] the law of the God of Israel in other
[1:06:33] words who was this angel the captain of
[1:06:36] the host who was his captain of the host
[1:06:39] the product a prophet of God says he
[1:06:41] said wrote the Joshua reached down and
[1:06:44] he take off took off his shoes he fell
[1:06:48] on his face before him and said what
[1:06:51] will the Lord have with me so now this
[1:06:55] was the same the very lord jesus christ
[1:06:57] why because when you go to the Book of
[1:07:00] Revelations and you see John he was
[1:07:02] there he Bob about himself before the
[1:07:05] angel and he say no don't worship Me and
[1:07:07] it was an angel he meant but the angel
[1:07:10] that was here yo she was worshiping
[1:07:12] because that was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:14] Oh brother Branham says it was the
[1:07:18] captain in other words the leader of the
[1:07:20] hosts of Israel and that leader was none
[1:07:24] other than Christ himself
[1:07:26] and what was keep your singing he was
[1:07:29] first seen as a pillar of fire he was
[1:07:32] there in the cloud but I don't want a
[1:07:35] pillar of fire I don't want a cloud I
[1:07:37] want to say the very large Jesus Christ
[1:07:40] this morning before my press my face
[1:07:45] because those were shadows those were
[1:07:47] types though those were for the people
[1:07:49] back there but what is it now for me
[1:07:52] this morning but the prophet of God says
[1:07:56] now the pillar of fire have become a man
[1:07:59] I hope you know what I am talking about
[1:08:02] he had me call my man who is he he is
[1:08:07] the Lord Jesus Christ it is not brother
[1:08:10] Branham as people have confused him and
[1:08:12] they have said that he his his Jesus
[1:08:15] Christ no it is the God the God himself
[1:08:18] he came in a he brought a message to a
[1:08:21] man but it was God using the mean that
[1:08:25] in that is the same now the prophet has
[1:08:27] is already out of the scene now there is
[1:08:29] a faithful ministry that is taking this
[1:08:31] right to the other side
[1:08:35] amen that is the bride now is the
[1:08:39] bride's ministry now it is no longer the
[1:08:42] face to be waiting for a prophet
[1:08:44] now it is the faith it is the system to
[1:08:47] have the Word of God in our hearts to
[1:08:51] say Lord what do you need from me this
[1:08:53] morning like Mary said Lord be it unto
[1:08:56] me according to your will and she was
[1:08:59] before the angel the church was before
[1:09:03] the angel and the angel disappeared and
[1:09:05] she conceived in her womb what is the
[1:09:09] word being considering your heart this
[1:09:10] morning in your life this morning
[1:09:13] yoshua alone by himself that was the
[1:09:17] purifier that Hal led them as an angel
[1:09:19] there he stood and cloak himself the
[1:09:21] captain of the host
[1:09:23] he was the unseen one and he's still the
[1:09:26] captain of the hosts of the Lord they
[1:09:28] don't sing when the invisible one they
[1:09:31] are militant one here tonight just as
[1:09:33] real as he was a standard air he wasn't
[1:09:36] standing there against the walls of
[1:09:38] Jericho
[1:09:40] you can say that this morning he is here
[1:09:42] why am I saying that he's here because
[1:09:44] you're bringing him with you your heart
[1:09:46] is mourning
[1:09:47] not because I'm here because I am
[1:09:49] nothing but if you're here with a clean
[1:09:51] heart with a pure heart then he is
[1:09:53] living in your heart then he is dwelling
[1:09:55] in your life amen
[1:10:00] the same Lord Jesus amen
[1:10:04] prevalence says he was the mill kiss he
[1:10:06] was a pair of fire he was a Rose of
[1:10:09] Sharon he was everything he's everything
[1:10:11] to me this morning
[1:10:13] amen he wasn't in a cloud or in a cloud
[1:10:16] or a pillar of fire anymore now is the
[1:10:19] very Lord Jesus Christ now is a
[1:10:22] manifestation of the Son of man in the
[1:10:25] bride you and I he became me that I
[1:10:30] might become him by grace and we always
[1:10:33] hear this thing all what what the power
[1:10:36] the father was was was was poured in
[1:10:39] took in to Jesus Christ and always was
[1:10:41] in Jesus Christ now where is it
[1:10:43] we said that now this morning it is in
[1:10:47] the bride he man I hope you're
[1:10:52] understanding me I believe that what the
[1:10:59] angel didn't say on chapter 5 was
[1:11:02] revealing the sixth chapter of the book
[1:11:04] of Joshua the word was open to Joshua go
[1:11:08] and destroy Jericho but spare me a bride
[1:11:13] Amen praise the Lord the city of Jericho
[1:11:17] needed to be conquered first it was a
[1:11:20] main entrance to the promised land
[1:11:22] now remember the battle is not yours the
[1:11:26] battle is lost the Lord led the Lord to
[1:11:30] conquer your Jericho your walled cities
[1:11:33] I mean you can say amen to that Lord
[1:11:36] come and conquer my own life my own
[1:11:38] desires my all what I am and then in the
[1:11:43] book of Joshua chapter 6 verse verse 1
[1:11:45] it says now now Jericho was straightly
[1:11:48] sure shut out because of the children of
[1:11:50] Israel known went out unknown
[1:11:54] came in brother Paul was preaching in
[1:11:57] church and he was talking specifically
[1:11:59] about Jesus creature scripture and he
[1:12:01] said why why what are we supposed to do
[1:12:05] with our enemies if not if nobody was
[1:12:09] able to go out or go in is because the
[1:12:12] children of Israel that were around that
[1:12:14] city and he said something that I really
[1:12:18] like he says because then if if not if
[1:12:21] nobody was able to go out or come in
[1:12:23] then they wouldn't be able to feed
[1:12:25] themselves and as I just said the city
[1:12:28] of Jericho was the main entrance to the
[1:12:31] promised land in other words what can we
[1:12:34] say here that when you are right when
[1:12:36] your enemies around you you either feed
[1:12:41] your enemy or you or you put your enemy
[1:12:43] to start until they your enemy die
[1:12:47] you can keep feeding your enemy nobody
[1:12:53] went in nobody went out what was
[1:12:56] happening there what they were doing
[1:12:58] they were putting them to fear first of
[1:13:01] all and also they were they were asked
[1:13:03] they were putting them to be starving
[1:13:05] amen and that is what we are supposed to
[1:13:07] do with our enemies this morning
[1:13:09] whatever your enemy is is now how can
[1:13:12] can you say Lord I'm fighting with this
[1:13:14] thing and then you go in front of the
[1:13:15] very same thing that you're fighting
[1:13:17] against that's feeding your enemy
[1:13:22] amen amen
[1:13:25] so stop feeding your enemy this morning
[1:13:31] amen now then the next verse it says and
[1:13:37] the Lord said unto Joshua see I have
[1:13:40] given into thine hand Jericho and the
[1:13:42] King Durov and the mighty man of Valor
[1:13:44] and ye shall come past the city all you
[1:13:47] men of war and go around about the city
[1:13:49] once thou shalt do thou dot you shall do
[1:13:53] that six days now if you read this
[1:14:00] chapter here seven Church ages were open
[1:14:02] and at the end of the chapter a
[1:14:04] prostitute receives a fulfillment of a
[1:14:06] promise
[1:14:07] that was given to her because she kept
[1:14:09] the secret so if you read this chapter
[1:14:12] six they were going around and we were
[1:14:15] gonna go to chapter six six a little bit
[1:14:17] but now when they walk around the city
[1:14:20] they were walking in silence silence
[1:14:22] doesn't it tell you something about the
[1:14:24] opening of the Seventh Seal that was the
[1:14:27] silence for the space of half an hour
[1:14:29] what was happening during that silence
[1:14:32] the Lord was descending he did Lord the
[1:14:36] Lord had descended and he has come to
[1:14:38] fulfill his promises in his children it
[1:14:41] have come to dwell in them as I said you
[1:14:45] said before Christ in you the hope of
[1:14:48] glory remember the seven fields will
[1:14:51] reveal rupturing faith to the bride I
[1:14:54] can tell you rapture in faith one calm
[1:14:58] rapture in faith he is already here i
[1:15:01] many believe that this morning now look
[1:15:05] even though the city was going to be
[1:15:07] destroyed great have had a token what
[1:15:11] was it token now it is the person of
[1:15:14] Jesus Christ in us or maybe we let the
[1:15:18] Holy Spirit destroy our world series
[1:15:20] full of pride full of anger full of the
[1:15:24] pride of life and the pleasures of this
[1:15:26] world is mourning may we let the ray
[1:15:29] half the desolate one they bearing one
[1:15:32] to produce the fruit of the hour
[1:15:34] let her be free let the one that the
[1:15:38] Lord has purchased with his blood
[1:15:40] let her be free this morning remember
[1:15:43] total obedience will give you the right
[1:15:46] to the token that is the promise of God
[1:15:48] that is what the prophet of God said in
[1:15:50] other words if you truly surrender to
[1:15:53] the Lord and you come in a humble manner
[1:15:55] he will guide your steps and in the
[1:15:58] choices of life he will lead you in how
[1:16:00] when and what to do
[1:16:03] but you have to be humble because many
[1:16:06] people come and seek advice from the
[1:16:08] pastor but there is already something in
[1:16:10] their hearts and they want to come to
[1:16:13] the pastor to tell them and kind of say
[1:16:16] pastor I need these or I'm gonna buy a
[1:16:17] car so you're recovered in your heart so
[1:16:19] why are you asked
[1:16:20] your posture if that is not reading your
[1:16:23] card just do it because when you come to
[1:16:28] talk to your pastor seeking for advice
[1:16:29] come with an empty cup and say Lord what
[1:16:32] you see that you want to get but you
[1:16:34] want to give me and then you and then
[1:16:36] you have to you have to have this
[1:16:38] mindset if whatever your servant is
[1:16:41] gonna tell me that's what we're gonna be
[1:16:42] doing because it is the advice of the
[1:16:46] Lord see that in prayer amen now Joshua
[1:16:55] 6:13 it says the seven priests they were
[1:17:00] carrying the seven trumpets carrying the
[1:17:03] seven trumpets they went forward
[1:17:04] marching before the Ark of the Lord in
[1:17:07] blowing the trumpets the armed men went
[1:17:10] ahead of them in the rearguard follow
[1:17:12] the Ark of the Lord while the trumpets
[1:17:14] kept sounding so on the second day that
[1:17:17] they march around the city once and
[1:17:19] return to the camp they dot DVDs for six
[1:17:23] days and on the seventh day they got up
[1:17:26] out of a day break-in they march around
[1:17:28] the city seven times in the same manner
[1:17:31] and as but that day this day circled the
[1:17:35] series seven times the the first six
[1:17:39] days they were just one and then where
[1:17:40] they went back to their camp but the
[1:17:43] seventh day they went six seven times he
[1:17:47] meant the seventh time around when the
[1:17:49] priests sounded the trumpet the trumpet
[1:17:51] blast in Yoshio commanded the army shout
[1:17:55] shout for the Lord has given you the
[1:17:58] city and when the trumpet sounded they
[1:18:02] army shouted in at the Sun the sound of
[1:18:05] the trumpet when the men gave a loud
[1:18:07] shout the wall collapsed and so every
[1:18:11] day everyone charged Australia it
[1:18:13] straight in and they took the city look
[1:18:17] in these verses they were playing the
[1:18:19] trumpet every day they were walking
[1:18:21] around the city now look in the Bible a
[1:18:24] trumpet is a message coming forth look
[1:18:28] your stuff you could catch the message
[1:18:29] there
[1:18:31] see glorious this morning just a few
[1:18:33] were catching the message can you
[1:18:36] imagine for the rest of the people that
[1:18:38] was just noise all these people is
[1:18:41] around and he they are very noisy but
[1:18:44] for ray - ray house and care hospital it
[1:18:47] was a sound of life he was the sound of
[1:18:51] life when this word is spoken to you to
[1:18:54] you it is the sound of life it is not
[1:18:57] the sound of defeat it is not the son of
[1:19:00] death but is the sound of light this
[1:19:02] morning all I can say this Bible it has
[1:19:07] brought life to my heart because we come
[1:19:10] and you look I can see my life in this
[1:19:13] book before the opening of the word the
[1:19:16] word it was your stock history book but
[1:19:18] after the opening of the world the pages
[1:19:22] of this book they have now been made
[1:19:24] flesh in nylons
[1:19:25] how many can say that every time when I
[1:19:29] go and read the Bible all I see myself
[1:19:31] myself day when I go and read your six I
[1:19:35] see myself there I see a woman a harlot
[1:19:38] but she was forgiven and all her sins
[1:19:41] were forgiven and cast down in the sea
[1:19:43] of forgetfulness and it says that it is
[1:19:46] forbidden to confession it is not a
[1:19:54] history book anymore
[1:19:55] oh how many can say lower more of you
[1:20:00] less of me this morning or lift up your
[1:20:03] heads because your redemption is drawing
[1:20:06] nigh oh the trumpet the trumpet sounded

[1:25:34] is inspiring about so many things but
[1:25:39] who can be the next president who can be
[1:25:41] the next the next congressmen who can be
[1:25:43] that who can be who's gonna win that
[1:25:45] then the next World Cup or who's gonna
[1:25:48] who's gonna lead them that the nations
[1:25:51] in the next deal nuclear deal whatever
[1:25:54] they are fighting for that because this
[1:25:56] is their kingdom but we have come from a
[1:25:59] kingdom that can never be defeated a
[1:26:01] kingdom that cannot be destroyed this
[1:26:04] morning now 1st Thessalonians 4:16 in it
[1:26:09] says for the Lord Himself I just love
[1:26:13] this scripture people saying that it's
[1:26:17] brother Branham the one but if you read
[1:26:19] here it says the Lord and what is their
[1:26:24] next himself not a man not a church when
[1:26:30] I'm not a denomination but the Lord saw
[1:26:35] discern from where from heaven with a
[1:26:39] shout with the voice of your kingdom and
[1:26:43] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[1:26:46] Christ shall rise first and I can say
[1:26:51] that death also in their sins and in
[1:26:54] their trans passes they have also they
[1:26:56] have already Ray Rice and amen amen
[1:27:00] the first thing is a Trump when a
[1:27:03] trumpet or a no it's a shock and then a
[1:27:05] voice and then a trumpet and Branham
[1:27:08] says shout is the messenger getting the
[1:27:11] people ready the second is a voice of
[1:27:14] the resurrection the same voice that
[1:27:16] loud voice in st. John 11:30 844 that
[1:27:19] cold letters out of the grave that is
[1:27:21] the same boy is not that has been
[1:27:23] brought to the right
[1:27:24] it says getting the bride together and
[1:27:27] then the resurrection of the death
[1:27:29] seemed to be caught up with him now
[1:27:32] now watch the three things take place he
[1:27:36] says now the third the third thing is a
[1:27:38] trumpet which always at the Feast of
[1:27:41] Trumpets is calling the people to the
[1:27:43] fist and that would be the that will be
[1:27:46] the bride's supper the lamb supper with
[1:27:49] the bride in the sky you see the first
[1:27:52] thing comes with a consort with the
[1:27:54] message calling the bride together the
[1:27:58] next thing is a resurrection of the
[1:28:00] sleeping right the ones died the ones
[1:28:03] that died back in the other ages they
[1:28:06] are cut off together and the trumpet the
[1:28:09] feasts in the heavens in in the sky why
[1:28:12] that is the thing that takes plague that
[1:28:14] that is what is taking place a place
[1:28:15] friends he says we're right they're
[1:28:19] ready now they only think the Orlan the
[1:28:23] church is coming out but he has to lay
[1:28:27] before the Sun to ripen amen so now
[1:28:33] there was a shout there was a voice
[1:28:36] there was a trumpet for a half and now
[1:28:39] we had received the same thing this
[1:28:41] morning and it says did he send a son
[1:28:44] did he send another one like like like
[1:28:47] came unto us no he came himself that's
[1:28:52] why I love this scripture the Lord
[1:28:54] Himself it says he came himself to
[1:29:05] redeem that lost son that's what we
[1:29:11] always have heard this is not the work
[1:29:14] of me and he's like Ryan wrote that song
[1:29:16] this is not the work of any meal you
[1:29:19] know hallelujah God did not entrust his
[1:29:25] plan of salvation to another but he
[1:29:27] trusted only himself
[1:29:31] are you happy this morning to know that
[1:29:33] he came himself and he himself is this
[1:29:38] morning among us bringing life to the
[1:29:41] believer bringing joy to they believe
[1:29:44] her brother anima says did you ever meet
[1:29:48] a person that's me that's that has been
[1:29:50] there where in the Holy of Holies he
[1:29:53] says and it has been tasted and living
[1:29:56] on this manner or has tested they tasted
[1:30:00] the manna he says he and that person is
[1:30:02] living in this on this manner you can
[1:30:04] meet him on Monday
[1:30:06] he says you can meet him on Monday
[1:30:09] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:30:11] Saturday or Sunday cloudy day bride a
[1:30:15] gloomy day no they things going right
[1:30:22] things going wrong he is always sweet
[1:30:27] always full of love never a talk or to
[1:30:31] do anything wrong why because he is
[1:30:35] living under the glory of God he never
[1:30:39] gets it gets hungry he never has to go
[1:30:44] to church to get built up he's always
[1:30:46] full of God why because now that person
[1:30:52] is living before the presence of the Sun
[1:30:56] he's been ripen every single day I mean
[1:31:00] he can say praise the Lord to that we
[1:31:03] are we getting something out of this
[1:31:04] message this morning now your show 6:17
[1:31:09] it says the city and all that is in it
[1:31:12] are to be the destroyer they are devoted
[1:31:14] to the Lord only Rahab the prostitute
[1:31:17] you know what all the things who all in
[1:31:20] all who are with care in her house shall
[1:31:23] be a spare because she hid the spies
[1:31:26] we sent so what was going on here the
[1:31:30] Lord was fulfilling the word that was
[1:31:33] given to the true day today to meet
[1:31:36] those two men amen now God has sent his
[1:31:41] message saying
[1:31:43] destruction is upon you but those that
[1:31:46] display their token they will be safe
[1:31:49] can you imagine the people walking
[1:31:52] around her house and saying why do you
[1:31:56] have that thread out of your house it is
[1:32:00] right why do you have it usually well
[1:32:04] you know you will not understand it
[1:32:09] that's what when people ask you why do
[1:32:11] you have sisters why do you have to
[1:32:13] dress that way you're like well if I
[1:32:15] explain you you will you will not
[1:32:17] understand it and instead of that you're
[1:32:19] gonna be criticized for me so you know
[1:32:21] what just lets you leave it that way
[1:32:25] right well what happened they were
[1:32:29] making fun of her because she had a
[1:32:31] trach but there was a confidence that
[1:32:33] that they told her if you keep that
[1:32:35] token there everything that is under the
[1:32:38] token is gonna leave just those that
[1:32:44] display the token they will be saved
[1:32:48] she kept that talking until the
[1:32:51] appointed time and what what's an
[1:32:53] appointed time do you have a date like
[1:32:55] you want you know the ones that are
[1:32:56] getting I'm getting there by the way
[1:32:58] those that are getting married but
[1:33:01] you're in the dating time or stuff like
[1:33:03] that
[1:33:03] you set an appointment okay you know
[1:33:05] what I'm gonna go and visit you this
[1:33:07] time and we're gonna be doing these and
[1:33:09] that so you a point of time and then
[1:33:11] what their point of time comes then you
[1:33:14] get there in English all right all right
[1:33:18] ma'am
[1:33:20] so that was the same time the same thing
[1:33:23] for Rahab they talked her when you hear
[1:33:26] this sound if you go and read the book
[1:33:29] of Joshua 2nd chapter they didn't tell
[1:33:31] her the message but they made it well
[1:33:34] they talked heard the message but he was
[1:33:36] kept secret the only public thing that
[1:33:38] they told her was like just display
[1:33:40] their token but the message that was
[1:33:42] told to her the destruction is gonna
[1:33:45] come a trumpet is gonna sound how did
[1:33:47] you know the message think about it how
[1:33:50] much he rejoicing if they didn't they
[1:33:53] didn't open the message they guess I did
[1:33:54] but it was a secret
[1:33:56] it was Ray Kappe secret now it is the
[1:34:00] bride's secret this morning she knew all
[1:34:04] the message the message that the angel
[1:34:06] came to Joshua and gave it to Joshua
[1:34:09] she knew it by revelation because when
[1:34:12] when she heard the sound of the trumpet
[1:34:14] and all that noise she was they all my
[1:34:16] Redemption is coming my salvation is
[1:34:18] coming amen
[1:34:21] she kept a token until the appointed
[1:34:24] time only those that have that had the
[1:34:27] token given by Joshua's messengers will
[1:34:31] be saved if you read Josh's the second
[1:34:33] chapter yours too were sent in Moses
[1:34:37] before he sent twelve and two of them
[1:34:40] where we're bringing a good report and
[1:34:42] the other ten we'll bring in about
[1:34:44] report so that's why it isn't this time
[1:34:46] like the messages is in a shorter time
[1:34:48] with a few people fewer people why
[1:34:52] because if you bring a lot of people
[1:34:53] there gonna be a lot of ideas and that
[1:34:55] would cause confusion so those just two
[1:35:00] were sent in the in those two we're in
[1:35:02] one Accord when we're in one mind in one
[1:35:06] Accord are they they all in the New
[1:35:09] Testament they are in one mind and in
[1:35:12] one Accord and now they are in a coroner
[1:35:16] in one mind in one accord with the
[1:35:18] message of the hour just those that have
[1:35:21] received a token the Holy Spirit through
[1:35:24] the revelation of the message of the
[1:35:26] hour to the individual will be saved
[1:35:28] from the tribulation nobody else I was
[1:35:32] thinking about the baptism in the name
[1:35:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the one
[1:35:37] of the steps to be saved
[1:35:39] I can give my heart to the Lord amen I
[1:35:42] can I can I can say to the church I have
[1:35:45] given my heart my heart to the Lord but
[1:35:47] that is not enough the Bible says repent
[1:35:51] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:35:57] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:35:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:36:03] Holy Ghost so think about it this way
[1:36:07] the nominations out there I've been
[1:36:09] thinking about
[1:36:10] I'm pondering but there is nothing else
[1:36:12] the denominations out they are doing
[1:36:15] great jobs you know like bringing a lot
[1:36:18] of people to Christ but they can they
[1:36:20] can be they can repent perfect praise
[1:36:22] the Lord but if they are not baptized as
[1:36:25] what the way the Bible says so amen
[1:36:33] so they can they can say that they are
[1:36:36] full of the Holy Ghost I will ask them
[1:36:38] have you been baptized in the name of
[1:36:39] Jesus Christ and if they say no so I'm
[1:36:42] like from which spirit the Azzam are you
[1:36:49] they asked those guys though those
[1:36:51] disciples if you are not baptized in the
[1:36:54] name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:37:01] and you know because it's like God
[1:37:04] cannot say just to some of them you're
[1:37:06] gonna come this way and to you you're
[1:37:07] gonna come this way and we're gonna get
[1:37:09] to the same place that that is not the
[1:37:11] way it is the word is very simple you
[1:37:15] have to repent you have to really you
[1:37:17] have to repent be baptized in the name
[1:37:19] of Jesus Christ and you will receive the
[1:37:21] gift of the Holy Ghost that's why the
[1:37:24] prophet of God says there is good people
[1:37:27] out in the denominations why because he
[1:37:29] saw that they were being they were
[1:37:31] repenting themselves and that they were
[1:37:33] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:37] that's the key amen
[1:37:43] Joshua's and again not singling out
[1:37:45] anybody or not you're saying oh that's
[1:37:47] what we are the ones no we're just
[1:37:50] following what the Word of God says acts
[1:37:52] 2:38 it says repent amen
[1:37:57] and you said to the two men who had
[1:37:59] aspired out the land go into the
[1:38:01] prostitutes house and bring her out and
[1:38:03] all who belong to her in accordance with
[1:38:06] your oath to her in other words a God
[1:38:09] honor the oath that those two men gave
[1:38:14] so the young men who have done this
[1:38:16] buying when spying went in and brought
[1:38:19] out brought out
[1:38:21] Rahab her father and mother her
[1:38:24] brothers and sisters and all who belong
[1:38:27] to her
[1:38:28] so the message wasn't just for her
[1:38:31] the message was like to whom ever will
[1:38:34] it is for you for your children and for
[1:38:37] the ones that doll or me they made shall
[1:38:39] call they brought out her entire family
[1:38:43] and they put them in a place outside the
[1:38:46] camp of Israel if we can say this thing
[1:38:50] God's times and seasons are perfect if
[1:38:54] you look at when grey having her family
[1:38:56] were taken from Jericho and United to
[1:38:58] the people of Israel they were taken to
[1:39:00] Jill go and and I'm going to tell you
[1:39:03] one thing it was a time of purification
[1:39:08] she didn't come in the time that you
[1:39:11] wanted I don't come to Christ or to God
[1:39:14] whenever I wanted I have to come in the
[1:39:18] appointed time whenever he wants me to
[1:39:21] come I will come so she came in the
[1:39:24] purification time they came out in that
[1:39:27] in the time of beautiful purification oh
[1:39:32] what a beautiful picture disease we have
[1:39:35] come in the time of purification and
[1:39:37] what can wash away my sin what is the
[1:39:40] time of purification it was a time when
[1:39:42] they were when they were offering all
[1:39:46] those their offerings to the Lord so
[1:39:49] they were they were a are toning or at
[1:39:51] all or all of these things from the
[1:39:54] people and not just for them for us but
[1:39:57] also for the bride what can wash away my
[1:40:01] sin nothing but Lord Jesus we are saved
[1:40:08] by the blood of God the eternal God
[1:40:10] involved a mortal body in order to take
[1:40:13] to take away my sin he became the lamb
[1:40:16] in order to shed his blood and enter
[1:40:20] into the bail with brother branham's he
[1:40:24] says this in the book of the revelation
[1:40:25] of Jesus Christ in other words how
[1:40:27] beautiful disease that she didn't come
[1:40:30] at any time she came in the appointed
[1:40:32] time purification time Uniting time or
[1:40:37] the other
[1:40:38] right she came when it was at the time
[1:40:41] the marriage the the the the marriage of
[1:40:44] the land she came at the time when that
[1:40:47] earthly bride was gonna be getting
[1:40:49] together with who with that heavenly
[1:40:51] bridegroom that was it nothing else
[1:40:55] Joshua 6 24 and 25 it says and they
[1:40:59] burned the whole city and everything in
[1:41:00] it but they put the silver in gold in
[1:41:03] the articles of bronze and iron into the
[1:41:06] treasury of the Lord's house but Joshua
[1:41:09] is spared Rahab the prostitute with her
[1:41:12] family ain't no clue belong to her
[1:41:14] because she hid she hid them in Joshua's
[1:41:18] cot sent as a spice to Jericho and she
[1:41:20] lives among the Israelites to this day
[1:41:22] in other words she obey the word of the
[1:41:25] prophet that's why I can say these this
[1:41:29] morning that sister that I was talking
[1:41:32] at the beginning she obeyed the word of
[1:41:34] the Prophet she didn't go to college
[1:41:37] which is nothing against it but the
[1:41:39] prophet of God saw her in a vision she
[1:41:41] may have seen her you know what if she's
[1:41:43] going back to college he may go back to
[1:41:45] her her past life so it is better for
[1:41:48] her to stay a comment take care of her
[1:41:49] or her family or her Darrin mom and then
[1:41:52] God is gonna give her what they desire
[1:41:53] of her heart she obeyed the voice of the
[1:41:56] prophet that was the same thing for
[1:41:58] Rahab she obeyed the voice of the
[1:42:00] prophets amen now Joe shall destroy the
[1:42:05] city with fire but Rahab was safe this
[1:42:08] world will be destroyed with fire but
[1:42:11] the bride is already saved and if you if
[1:42:15] you see here everything is sided with
[1:42:17] the Angels visit a visitation to Joshua
[1:42:20] he obeyed the message and everything
[1:42:22] finished with the rescue of the bride
[1:42:25] and now again think about that young
[1:42:28] lady the Indian one she obeyed the word
[1:42:31] or what a great responsibility
[1:42:34] responsibility this morning we must of a
[1:42:37] God in order for his message to come
[1:42:40] forward because brother Branham says God
[1:42:44] doesn't have all their eyes but your
[1:42:46] eyes
[1:42:47] he doesn't have all their hands but your
[1:42:49] hands he doesn't cover their feets
[1:42:51] but your feet he doesn't have all their
[1:42:54] mind but your mind what am i doing this
[1:42:57] morning in my obeying what God is
[1:42:59] telling me or am I just taking these for
[1:43:02] granted and saying well you know what
[1:43:03] that's for my brother
[1:43:04] that's for my sister but this is not for
[1:43:06] me this is the end of the matter a bride
[1:43:11] she did her part she kept a word that
[1:43:15] was given to her in that that is what I
[1:43:18] want you to take this morning whatever
[1:43:20] word you have been given if even if it
[1:43:23] is just one word live with that word
[1:43:25] until the next service or until your
[1:43:28] good morning devotion so whenever you
[1:43:30] have time whenever you make your time
[1:43:32] available to pray with the Lord and say
[1:43:34] Lord what is next for my life because
[1:43:38] sometimes you may feel yourself you know
[1:43:39] what I'm stuck here I'm not going
[1:43:41] forward you don't know where to go but
[1:43:45] that is the time when you have to say
[1:43:46] Lord where do you want me to go it has
[1:43:49] happened you know it happens to
[1:43:50] ministers happened to me but you get to
[1:43:52] a point is like what Laura what is next
[1:43:55] and when you start asking him Lord what
[1:43:57] is next then she's gonna say this is
[1:43:59] next for your life friends I can say
[1:44:03] that is a key keep his word keep his
[1:44:06] Commandments he cannot be ashamed
[1:44:09] whatever he has promised he will come to
[1:44:11] pass whatever don't we sing every
[1:44:16] promise in the book is my every chapter
[1:44:19] every verse every life we sing that I
[1:44:25] was thinking the other day like singing
[1:44:27] like all songs and I was like wow like
[1:44:30] sometimes you we used to sing them all
[1:44:33] the time but now they can't they have a
[1:44:36] different meaning to me and now when I
[1:44:38] sing every promise in the book is mine I
[1:44:40] say every promise in the root position
[1:44:44] amen so how many are happy to know these
[1:44:47] things this morning Lord you hid all
[1:44:49] these things from the wise and the
[1:44:51] prudent and have given them to your
[1:44:54] little children and then it was because
[1:44:57] it was your own pleasure Lord to give
[1:44:59] these things to me this morning
[1:45:01] this bride she obeyed and if the
[1:45:04] was a bride that obeyed in the time of
[1:45:06] Yahshua there will be a time a bride
[1:45:08] that is going to be in the time of the
[1:45:10] Joshua Commission certainly the Prophet
[1:45:13] is gone but the word is here now being
[1:45:16] made flesh in the heart of simple people
[1:45:19] in the heart of the relievers this
[1:45:21] morning
