just how much that we need him how much we're depending on him amen well we want to just say just love you and um it's so good to be together and god is permitted i'm sure some of you probably been able to enjoy this weather a little bit and um just uh it's a precursor it's like uh letting us know spring's coming yeah i'm on my way i'm coming and if that's doing that in the in with what we see around us there's signs that let us know it's getting close how much more for the coming of the lord getting closer we're one day closer we're one hour closer one moment closer amen that's wonderful isn't it amen we had a couple requests that come in a little bit late and i want to read those i also want to say perhaps many of you or different ones already know brother ray had went through the surgery there yesterday just wanted to convey his thoughts and thanks for prayer you know the lord just seen our brother through that surgery as we said before it was a miracle that he even got the surgery because there's many that were there within that particular job that they've had an injury as well and they've not been able to get the surgery some of you know how that is with all the workers comp stuff and jumping through hoops and things but but god's able you know god god has testimonies that god does certain things sometimes and i don't think any of us line up to say lord i'll be the guy that you use for an example on this to show that you can work through this avenue not one of us would raise our hand now if it came to walking on lake erie we'd say i'll be i'm your guy i'm your guy but see god has examples and testimonies that you and i even can look at and see that no matter what others could say we can say god is able god is a favor and we're thankful for that tonight so we want to remember brother ray in prayer the lord will just continue to strengthen our brother amen also um want to make mention i i hadn't made mention of it to you yet but the lord willing brother andrew glover will be here the memorial day weekend like the meetings that we normally have there might be some little adjustments here or there but uh yeah we kind of locked that in place in september when he was here i know he's been here since then but we locked that in but i want you just to keep that in mind lord willing for memorial day weekend brother andrew glover will be here want to play if you want to stand with me let's pray for these requests as well too let's see both of these requests are from my mom says please pray for my brother-in-law glenn garner my sister is with him at the er he's very congested and is very weak [Music] so i think he's had both of those shots hasn't he [Music] which i'm not sure what that means but uh you know but anyhow i know that he's had both of those shots they're already been well well over with um also please pray for for my support her sister marcella she's having severe pain following her eye surgery so let's just remember those needs i know you we took other needs before the lord in prayer you've got a need on your heart let's just continue to remember the needs and prayers i don't know if sister shirley was mentioned tonight but there's many different needs sister irma there's different needs that that are right here among us i know brother gabriel did you just have that done the root canal you didn't okay so let's just let's pray also our brothers in need of a touch as well let's just go to god in prayer heavenly father lord as we just come before you this evening lord what a privilege and an honor it is lord that we can call you our father lord and to know that by a real reality in our hearts lord just that it's a it's a settled reality oh god and we just bring these petitions there's hearts lord that lord have a request they've got a need and lord there's no need that you look at as two in are insignificant or that or this one's greater you lord you're el shaddai you're the all-sufficient one oh god lord for every need for every circumstance for every sickness lord your everything to us lord dear god we just lord lift these requests lord in prayer lord before you tonight those that i read lord regarding my uncle glenn and marcella i pray lord for sister surely dear god for brother gabriel sister irma lord there's many needs lord as well as every need behind those uplifted hands of your

everything lord right back in place oh god a multiplying of cells lord we pray father lord we just take these requests tonight and as we would look into your word oh god we pray that lord that you would just come lord and breathe upon a soul god breathe upon the word tonight oh god the lord is just lord would impart life to us o god strength lord healing o god the holy spirit oh god may you just come lord come in a special way tonight we welcome you lord we ask it now father for your glory in jesus name amen amen god bless you amen let's look here in the word i want to go we've been reading from this verse and taking just that part and in first corinthians 13 4 perhaps by now you probably have committed it to memory but we certainly want it more than just memory and um sometimes there's things that you look in a verse of scripture and um you know i just is telling the lord today there's things that you know you witness over the years but it's still you stand as a marvel of god will take something and it begins to unpack it and it's all of the whole the whole part of the ministering of the word it's all about what god coming and ministering to what we have need of there's many times we see things even as a as a minister we don't know what the needs are and even when you would know a need such as myself being the pastor here but yet as far as within that i can't reach out i just can't reach out within myself to meet that it takes god to come and meet him and god works in such a way that there are times that something doesn't even have to be said directly he just comes when he comes that's that's the most important thing amen so let's read here and then we'll just allow you to be seated first corinthians 13 4 charity suffereth long is kind it envieth not and it vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just look here in a part when we just some of the things that some time ago that when the lord just began to deal with my heart um just looking on on some of these parts and really begin to take this on the on the vaunted knot and begin to look at this word because of what it really it means it deals with that charity is not boastful that word just began to press upon my heart one sunday evening and just started to begin to look at some things and and these are the parts sometimes we look at things that are before us and you know there's things sometimes that can be so sly or so subtle or things that can seemingly move under the radar a little bit but god is so mindful and he desires that the the image of his own life within us that our character would be molded to reflect his character now we know that character it's not a gift the holy ghost is the free gift of god that's something that that is it is gifted to you and i that life the quickening power but then when that life that character of life that has come into us then through that life being in us it now works to shape and to mold our character to where everything about us reflects him and of course we understand it it takes uh each and every day a dying daily to self and so we thank god for his grace that allows us to die to self we thank god that god brings things to our attention because the desires we've looked at here within any heart of a believer we want him to be glorified when we leave out of a restaurant or a job or wherever it's at we we would like it to be declared that a christian has been here that to have a reflection of that life not something we're trying to do but if the desire is that it would be that of christ that has been made known to them there's a difference and you know when we look at things one of the things that we'll look at here tonight and in looking at this little part it's something that at times when we can look at it that it may not be something that we could we would say out here as far as a boast or a glory but sometimes it's even in the way that we can approach things and when we look here in the scripture the scripture that i want to start with here is proverbs 27 verse 1 and and here the admonition of the lord says boast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth there's there's not one of us not one doesn't matter what age we are not one of us has the promise of tomorrow and you know let alone the next breath there and you know so when we look at this we we realize that it's not god has not called upon us to instruct him nor is he inquiring of us uh to see that we might direct him but rather as the scripture said who has known the mind of the lord that they may instruct him but it's not us instructing god but it's god instructing you and i it's the mind the mind of god the mind of christ it surpasses our natural mind as a matter of fact many times it will work in direct contrast to the natural mind because our natural mind is based upon things that you and i would have control on but the mind of christ god's mind operating in us is it looks and it brings us to focus on god and that he who has made a promise he fulfills his promise in his own time in his own season and he doesn't ask us to know how it's going to happen he doesn't even ask us to declare the wind it's just most important is is to know him who's made the promise and that we are in him who is the promised keeper and so it's the privilege that you and i have in our life this is a privilege that is the children of god that we can be led by the spirit of almighty god that's a great privilege that we have and you know brother branham would would speak of these things and these are some of these parts are very familiar with us as i said these are things that sometimes we can just somewhat look over not willfully but we just can kind of look over and brother branham's talking about he's made a commitment as far as to the church or he's told the church as you've heard him say many times i'm going to preach on on this subject if the lord allows me to do so and brother branham would put that in there and he said he began to just kind of study on this subject now this was back when he was just preaching the message on the seven church ages the one message back in 1954 and he began to study and as he's looking at it he just finds and senses the spirit of god just draws near to his heart and and he begins says you know at that time he says i just was was getting happy and i just believe that it's god's will for me to bring this you see the scripture it always we always want to always rest and resolve in this place that if it be the will of the lord that's the best thing brother bram said that's the best thing that we can say you know i just say it to you like this as as a minister of the gospel there are things sometimes that even i've witnessed right here in the church let alone when i've been out in another place and going to minister that sometimes there's things that where god will take things that you might be inclined to speak in a certain thought a certain direction and then all of a sudden the holy spirit will begin to just move and just to deal with your heart and you know you're looking at things and well i i need i'm just going to follow this channel and you may not have one single note wrote down for it whatsoever but you know always reserve because after all uh i'm not the preacher he's the preacher i'm not the one who operates the gift he comes and operates the gift and you know there's a part of it that and let's just let me just be honest with you in the humanity of myself there's a comfort as far as where i can look out and say okay i'm moving within this direction i'm still relying on him but i i really get even more nervous i'm nervous anyhow but i get more nervous when i only have just a few scriptures and i'm standing there and i'm saying now where are we going to go with this lord what direction but you know the things that god and i'll say it in this way has taught me is to rely upon him and you know it doesn't take away with no matter what i have in front of me the reliance is upon him is that right it's just like as a song leader the psalm the brothers that stand up here they might have 10 songs on their list that doesn't mean that god wants them to sing all 10 songs on their list if i preached everything in my notes right here well i can't even tell you how many pages are here you we would be here throughout the whole month with no rest whatsoever but it's finding that particular the channel of almighty god and recognizing okay let's get off right here let's stop right here and you know it's so it's always to be mindful and always open to what the will of god is because after all it's not him fitting into our program but rather it's us fitting into his program so this is where the same scripture now james picks this up in reference here in james chapter 4 he says go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue their year and buy and sell and get game whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time then vanisheth away i think one of the clearest pictures of that is when a jet passes over and you see that jet stream you can stare at it and eventually it just it dissipates it goes away that's the same way with our lie it's very strong in the early years and then it just starts to fade away is that right so now it says it is what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth the way for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that but now ye rejoice in your boastings and all such rejoicing is evil now when you think of this we wouldn't necessarily think that this is a boasting or it's a it's an evil rejoicing but when you look at the scripture on this and then and the meaning of this word boasting it means to be empty a braggart talk and insolent and empty assurance which trust in its own power and resources let me go to the next one this is the other part of it and in pious and empty you notice how that word empty is there an empty presumption a presumption is venturing without authority so it's an implies an empty presumption which trust in the stability of earthly things oh my lord certainly this these are things now that you would think would be ever so clear before people that don't put your stock in tomorrow that's not a play on words either but it's a reality you you make good of the day and the opportunity that you have today because we can't count on tomorrow is that right so the first words the first times when we think of this notice james says you you should say if the lord wills it wasn't saying if james was not telling them do not say as though you're going oh i'm gonna i'm not gonna go to this city. no but he says put god first lord willing amen if the lord wills this is what we will do the very first time that even this phrase is used i will is when god speaks that he's going to make a helpmate for adam it's where she would come forth under the i will you see with god there's no hesitation because you see we're not we are not god but he is the omniscient one he's omnipresent his omnipotent one and what he says he's the one that can say i will because he is the performer of his word and this is where we find a rest is is in that part of the word when god has said i will if we are found in that word of the i will we have complete rest and our future is clear it's certain because it's in him lucifer also took these words in isaiah 14 and he said i will ascend to the throne i will exalt myself i will be worshipped as god i will but satan he took that apart from god's will it was not one with god's will so it shows very clearly that anything that is not under god's will under his direction and not yielded to it is not of god it must be under his direction and this is what charity seeks for is that for his leading because no matter what it is that you and i would even maybe desire to do the thing that we want to see glorified is him now sometimes that that that the glorifying of him it would not be something so much that maybe somebody would see out here it can simply be that as we have waited on god and god has has guided us in a direction where we didn't know where to go but now here he comes on the scene and what a decision we were going to make he steps in the way and guides us so that our life is not entangled and not ensnared that his glory might continue to be reflected through our life this is why paul would say stand fast in the liberty wherewith christ had made you free he would say in timothy he said no good soldier entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him that had called him to be a soldier so that god entrusts that to you and i that those are decisions that we have to make and certainly god doesn't want you and i walking around fearful he doesn't want us walking around fearful like oh i might step on a trap here or i make no no god doesn't want us walking that way the matter of fact as we look at it here in just a moment as we see through the word when we're looking to him god sees to it that our footsteps are ordered in the right things i would love to be able to say that every one of us have made the perfect decisions in the past and will make the perfect decisions in the future but i i think that we're all resolved to this place not as an excuse but we're still walking in this humanity that we have to bring subject to the word day by day and moment by moment hallelujah now look how jeremiah would write this oh lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps so jeremiah is not speaking of as far as you or i would say well you know a man's a man a woman's a woman and they just you know know to go about their way he's speaking on a much higher level there was a fall that took place in eden and man who was made to be as a god remember when he fell and a man who is in a fallen condition is just like a beast so the way of man man doesn't hold it the way of man god's purpose the purpose the reason the desire that lays in god's hands it's not given to man but man thinks he knows what man should do but the way of man is not in himself to direct himself it is it's not in him that he walketh to direct his steps you see we were made to be reliant upon almighty god we were made to rest upon him we were made to be led by the holy spirit this is why david could say the lord is my shepherd david could say we are the sheep of his pasture when jesus comes he identifies himself i am the shepherd of the sheep and my sheep they know my voice and i know them by name and a stranger they will not follow he brings to you and i that realization it's not ashamed to be regarded as a sheep it's the most glorious privilege because you recognize i'm in need of my shepherd to guide me [Applause] hallelujah glory be to god you see the scripture goes on to say proverbs 16 9 a man's heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his step to devise is to plan god's not against you planning things god's not against plans the man's heart you there's plans that you would have whether it's young person middle age whatever there's plans that you have let me just say this if you don't have plans something's wrong i'm just going to be very direct don't you allow the enemy to rob you and put you in a corner amen you've got everything in the world to live for you might say brother samuel that don't help me a bit then let me encourage you it's not brother samuel saying it it's the holy spirit letting you know that there is joy to your life if you've lost your joy there's the one who is the joy-giver that's present to restore your joy let me tell you something joy is not in material things of this earth the real joy of the lord when you read in job chapter 2 is when you've got a meat offering and a drink offering you've got a life that there is a fellowship with god brother let all hell break loose around a child of god but as long as they're in fellowship with god they've got a need offering they can offer back christ his word reflected in their life they've got a drink offering a life that can be poured out that is the greatest privilege and joy of the life of a child of god so plants can be made nothing wrong with plants but with those plans we always leave it if the lord wills you see because listen we're not under the mind of a man in this hour the message that come to you and i it delivered us from the reasoning of man we've been brought under the influence of the mighty angel are you with me we have been brought under the influence of the word our motives our objectives our ambitions have been changed it's him that's illuminated our lives so here we are in the presence of the living word and remember the word hebrews 12 4 4 12 says that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we want the living word of god to come and really begin to discern what are the plans that we have and god can say yes lord it don't mean listen when god says it don't mean your heart's not broken let me give you a quote brother brown says you've broken my heart many times over but i love you for it yeah i've said this many times before i i appreciate such honesty brother brown did put on an act it was right out on us before us i can relate to a man like that notice the scripture goes on proverbs 16 3 commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established so commit them to god that works and thy thoughts that which has been devised in the heart when you commit it into his hands then your thoughts shall be established right let's talk about how because it's not you bringing it to past it's god god his will is for your life he's the will it encompasses every part of your life you realize that god just did not place you here the number one number one reason you're here is to serve the lord is to be dramatized by the holy spirit that's the whole reason we're here that's the reason we're here is to receive his life and be a reflection of him that's why as we pass through here now the other things as far as whether it's occupation career whatever job and house and everything like that those are not just things that god takes and says let's just throw that up in the air i'm not concerned about it all that's contrary to scripture god had a place when he called him out of egypt he had a place to take him to he's the same god that says if you'll forsake father mother sister brother houses and lands he said i will provide for you houses lands sisters brothers father's mother it'll come of persecution but i won't be in debt to you i will provide for you and as a matter of fact i won't do a partial job i'll give a hundredfold [Applause] god won't be in debt to nobody when they stand on his word and stand there then god he comes on the scene to bring it to paso yes the natural things of life god's interested in that he's interested in your job he's interested where you live he's interested in all those details about our life that's not the number one priority but it still is a priority psalms 37 4 delight thyself also in the lord he shall give thee the desires of thine heart see how this is working when you delight yourself in the lord then he shall give thee the desires of thine heart it's impossible for the wrong desires and i'm not talking about sin i'm talking about desires of certain things it's impossible if we're delighting ourselves in him and him it's him that we're dwelling in then that word the word has a way of dismantling even things that you and i may be wanting to be a hunter or a trapper or certain things and we there ain't no sin in that but maybe really wanting that and here god steps down and god just brings the situation and he relieves it and you say it's yours lord amen might have been something that you know you wanted to be all your life notice commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass you know brother branham i've often i love this this statement that brother branham makes uh in regards to when he's getting ready to minister the seven trumpets remember he was talking about sending out announcements we're gonna you know have eight days of meetings and this is what we're going to have and he couldn't he couldn't just get settled on that and the holy spirit reveals to him when he's there on that saturday evening before he preaches recognizing your day and his message and brother graham was all tore up and his stomach and everything else but the holy spirit comes down and reveals to him those trumpets have already been supernaturally preached under that sixth seal he rests right in that and brother brown steps forward and then he preaches later on the message a feast of the trumpets and i love how brother bran how he makes this clear here he was anticipating preaching those seven trumpets but here as he's waiting on god and he says it like this he says i know this sounds very juvenile maybe to people of great learning and understanding but to the christian it's different we follow the leading of the spirit and that alone because he wouldn't let me speak on them at that time that's the ultimate as i was saying before that's ultimate this is what we're looking to to his leading his direction his guidance in our lives you find paul in through the the the new testament when paul in the journeys the missionary journeys and things you'll find how paul would even express to the different ones at ephesus and those at corinth and and those at macedonia and different places and they were desiring paul maybe to stay or they wanted paul to return and paul would write of these places and say uh you know we we we'll be passing this way and we will come and we will visit you if god permits and paul would write this if the lord wills he would always include that because knowing that above all things when this was wrote by revelation that i'm a prisoner of jesus christ that wasn't just a play on words paul meant what he said that's what it was in his life he was yoked to the word by the spirit and even when he looked when he when that woman who was following him as a fortune teller these men be the way tell us the way of god and everything else god allowed the advertisement campaign to run for a few days and finally paul remember brother ram told us in christ the mystery he said paul knew he had the authority to rebuke that spirit he said but he had to wait on god for god to give him the permission at the right time oh paul a reserved man in the hand of god the same way with is this god's will is it god's will that we go here is it god's will that we go there oh my even when you write a paul when you read in the first part of romans and you read this messenger's heart his desire was to get to rome he wanted to get there he said i want to impart some spiritual gift to you that we might share in that same mutual faith and he lets him know i've tried many times but i've been led in other directions he lets him know i'm meant to come to you many times oh my well we could really preach on that you see sometimes we can get to looking and you know brother branham i think would dramatize that with martha and mary they sent for the lord jesus he did not come right away but he came when it was the right appointed time he didn't walk according to even human emotion that was his buddy that was his friend you realize sometimes you can feel like you've got to do something for somebody out of obligation my maybe they let you stay at their house or they did this for you or they did that don't ever let me just say on the part of the giving in you don't ever want to have somebody feel that way you want it to be where it's clear hey this is just a gift you don't have an obligation to me whatsoever i'm not trying to buy your friendship this is just on my heart to do it for you and sometimes even though that's been the right way sometimes we can feel obligated my lord have mercy you remember when brother banham stood there in the message in his presence 1962 he stands in front of his church and he repents regarding the brown bear vision he tells the church in that time he said forgive me i think of the word he uses forgive me he said for being dilatory you know what dilitory means it means to be lazy or loose if there's anybody that i would not recall or ever say would be dilatory i would say brother brown is not dilatory but you see he wasn't talking about the doings out there he dealt with the dilatory part about being a little slow and to walk according to what god had showed him regarding that vision he said i i got to thinking if i go with the younger ones the older ones what are they going to say about it come on every one of us know our flesh could go in the same way hallelujah that's why those examples are included for you and i don't look at that right there listen if god told you to be there the brown bear is going to be there you're going to get that brown bear if you're in the right place at the right time don't worry what anybody else thinks that's between them and god god will take care of it [Applause] oh my my my my mind amen true so you know our plans our plans are can be very uncertain even of all the plans that we we make it can be very uncertain but there's one certain place it's the only place it's certain and that's the word of god that's the that's the word of god it's where you can rest knowing what his will is you know the bible would even write regarding this is his will that you would know how to possess your vessel unto sanctification and honor it would also right regarding his will you know you can take the promise of god right here tonight and say i know it's god's will to give me the holy ghost i know it's god's will to heal me that's his word you might say brother samuel that's not even being revealed to yet that you know it's god to heal me that's a promise in god's word that he said as many as the lord our god shall call that's a promise that you can stand on that's not you that's god and that pulsation of the holy spirit of the one who says i will makes it real to your heart and you can say the promise of the holy ghost is mine healing is mine hallelujah you're not speaking out out of the will of god you're speaking in the will of god that's why brother brown would talk about every time he goes somewhere simple counsel and direction but he would say i only try to go where he leads me he said because when i go where he leads me and opposition comes up because opposition listen being led by god and being in his will doesn't mean you're free from circumstances it doesn't mean that you're not going to be tested but the test itself only further brings to light what god has put in your heart and that's why brother bram says when i can go and i know it's the leading of the lord god is i'm feeling led to go this direction i'm pulled in this direction then he says when satan raises up i can say satan in the name of jesus christ give way i'm here in the will of almighty god what about in our homes what about in our churches we can stand that way is that right you see there's things that you know brother brown talks about remember when he went overseas he was in south africa and the great meetings that were down there remember brother branham he would share with us lessons that he himself learned he allowed he allowed his itinerary which i can understand that would allow the itinerary to be made out i know from myself and i'm sure the other brothers you know i don't know you you brothers make out the itinerary you set up as far as the meetings and where we're going and so forth and you just you have to trust the lord but i'm sure at many times of our itineraries were not even in this in this way as brother branham's we're talking weeks remember how the holy spirit told him about remaining in a certain place and brother adam this is just supposed to show you no matter what the itinerary was brother bam said we're staying right here god told us to stay right here now he had pressures from everybody else even remember when brother blacksworth came to him and brother branham looked at him and said you too brother bosworth you're right you know what brother billy paul told him said daddy you just obey the lord now you know we know we know what took place and what come out of that it was not just you know where here even with that brother branham he was under the pressure of that itinerary but brother brandon you'll hear him even after god has brought him back even you'll hear him continue to talk about it after god delivered him of that amoeba you see even because it wasn't brother branham's decision but it was those how they had set that itinerary but still within that part of it god didn't say well you know i'm just going to let you buy scot-free he had an amoeba but you know there's times and things god listen he's a faithful father are you with me he doesn't do that well i'm going to punish you no there's a part of it that times god teaches us the value and he teaches us as brother branham would say i learned my lesson he said i'm not let nobody make my itinerary out again there's things we come through you know we would love every one of us here we would love there's certain examples and things or mistakes and things man i would have loved to have passed right over is that right and even when we could look at things there's things that when i'm i'm looking here uh in the message and i sit around with you know the brothers and my buddies and different ones that i can take and i can learn other elders here in the assembly different ones i listen my heart is always open for god to be able to speak and to learn and to take direction from that but i look at this here you know it always comes to a place that no matter what we're going to do let's always be open to his leading in other words we want to have a comma not a period whatever the event in our life we want to have a comma not a period because a period is where it ends that's it there's no more but a comma says we believe all this and all that god has done and all that he'll continue to reveal we want our lives to be guided by a comma that we're open it's not lord this is how it's got to be you're going to come this way it's got to be like this if you don't show up here in 35 minutes i'm out of here lord if the sound surface doesn't go like this if the service doesn't go like this then lord i'm out of here because god doesn't come according to our thoughts concerning things we want to have a comma not a period because to have a period is to boast as though we've got it all definitive is that right you see this is why brother brown could say says i don't know what tomorrow is i don't know what it holds but i know who's holding it that's where my faith is built not on tomorrow but in him who holds it and this is why you know that faith just being built and just resting in him this is why we desire we should desire that our life would be so inclined with the word of god so given to the word of almighty god because it's that one solid place the only solid place there is is in him the rest is sinking sands it's shaking there's only one place it's to be in him this is why that even solomon would write in the book of proverbs and i'm just going to just going to skip into a verse here but he would speak of how that a life should value the word he's speaking to the young man to the young person that their lives would so value the word of god too let it be upon the neck to be yoked with it to be led by it to be directed by and let it be in your heart let your let your heart be yielded to him and then the promise is not only will you have favor with god but you'll also have favor with man trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding you see it's to be fully in him this is why we're not leaning upon what a man has said we're leaning on thus saith the lord when god as he sent this message god never gave us the thoughts of a man this is god's thoughts the spirit of truth has sought it out it didn't take us out of the bible if any experience is is designated to be an experience that won't line up with the word it's not the true experience of the baptism of the holy ghost and you're leaning on your own understanding that shaky ground this is why trust not in your own understanding but but that you would lean not in thine own understanding but trust in the lord with all thy heart that all of your life is resting in him and your understanding is i know him in the power of his resurrection i know him i don't know how but i know he changed me i know he came in and he did a work in my life it so it's a little work that it loves him it's a work that cries out amen to the word it's a life that lines with that word it's a reality that changed me it's something that is indescribable but yet i know that it's there in all thy ways look at this admonition in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path to acknowledge him is not just to say lord i just kind of want to get your thoughts on this lord i'm acknowledging you i want to get your thoughts lord what do you think as though that we have some better thought pardon me for being very clear but even as a per even as someone comes down listen i'm a man that's true but god promised he'd be a mighty counselor god promised that he would use the gift of a pastor when you've got questions when you've got things and i can tell you this if you approach it if you approach it in the way of let's see what brother samuel says you end up doing your own thing i'm just preaching it straight you'll go your own way some you know some won't even come that's fine i don't i don't pressure anybody to come but i'm just trying to tell you that we are not to approach god in that way to approach him in that way is boastful as though that we know a better way just remember you didn't get yourself out of sin i don't care how much you tried you could never get the filth and the dirt and the spot you could never change your nature it took an almighty god coming down to bring a transformation in your life he's the same god that said i'll give you pastors i give you evangelists i give you teachers i give you prophets i give the apostles he's the same god because it's his ministry it's his care for his people you know me well enough those of you whether you're streaming or not if i don't if there's something at that time it hasn't come to me i'll tell you you know what let's just pray about it listen you actually say that listen i learned a long time ago maybe this is just honest confession is good for the soul i said this in one of the places that one where the young couples were we're together you all remember i made a statement i said you know what i used to think man you starting this pastor i've got to have the answers i used to think man when i became a husband i got to have the answers when i'm a dad i gotta have the answers i said you know what i put undue pressure on myself it wasn't god it wasn't one of the people it's me but do one thing you realize i don't have to have all the answers i just have to look to him who is the answer that's why in situations and things that they when they arise now when i look at that and say god i'm just trusting you whether it comes at a moment's notice or it's something that's planned it's laid out say god i'm looking to you you guide and direct me you said take no thought what you're saying this time oh my sometimes you're just sitting there and i'm waiting waiting and all of a sudden then he comes oh my when when he comes that's it right there i mean you just feel like everything right there at that point in time that's what the anointing is it's supreme control it's just everything right there at the time the devil couldn't move nowhere god is good in me that was free in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct that path so we just don't want to we're not wanting to know what what's your opinion on this god but here's what we'll do if we acknowledge him he'll direct our paths think about jehoshaphat ahab said hey buddy hey come on let's let's you and me let's go down here to and you know and fight the syrians you know i mean unless you and me get an apartment together come on somebody come on let's let's look at this right here and jehoshaphat said well my sure you know my you know we're brothers my horses are your horses and everything jehoshaphat went down there without consulting the lord first but he had enough god about him he was down there in that situation and all of a sudden joshua so fast something started ringing on the inside of me he said wait a minute here wait a minute you see charity is catching boast charity is catching the boast and he said hey let's consult the lord on this they have said sure i'll get my pets out of here we'll let them we'll let them out and let them come out but after it was all said and done that still didn't stabilize jehoshaphat because you only know why that wasn't of god but here came one micah he spoke the thoughts of god it behooves us before just committing to something see what's the mind of the lord in this look hey no no doubt a lot of thoughts could have went through his mind hey god told joshua when the tribes were going to stay on the one side of jordan don't you you go fight with your brethren when the land is conquered then you can go back over but you see we have to know what word to apply in that situation that's what brother brahm said he said somebody can say pick up a scripture judas hung himself no you go do the same but you got to know the word that's for the season that's for the hour god supplies the word that is meant to address that need what do i do rest in him god will bring it to life is that right you see we don't have no guarantee i think we're we're we're settled on that you have no guarantee of tomorrow we have to prepare today for tomorrow when god in the beginning when you look at this the steps the very those parts within creation what god did one day prepared for the next day everything was a preparation building up there's been a preparation that's been building up you see god don't he won't accept any excuse on that day there'll be no excuse accepted well lord you know this or you know that there'll be no excuses but there's no guarantee of tomorrow but we're living in a time we're living in a place where you would think people would already be in a place to realize hey there's no guarantee of tomorrow we're living a year right now it's closing in on a year from where you know where we just had stepped away and we streamed for two weeks because this virus came in i mean that's how long that's how much time has passed by right what things that people would say was a guarantee you realize there's no guarantee is that right yeah so we don't know there's no guarantee for tomorrow um let's say this in both ways this not only applies in the spiritual but i also want to bring it even into the natural you make preparation even right now for even the future oh brother simon now see here's it i've just got to preach sometimes you know i've been in youth meetings sometimes young people know how to use the word in order to get their convenience but that ain't just young people i have seen all ages do those things well you know the coming of the lord is upon us that is not a license to rush into marriage preach brother samuel i might be an old man there's a lot worse things than being an old maid or an old bachelor [Applause] easier for you to say no no no you shouldn't say that i've been on the other end counseling i've been on the other end where the peace is trying to be picked up are you with me but you see sometimes they want to just use these things and and moving out like that but the prophet told us how we ought to conduct our lives we do not plan on as though that well you know that the coming of the lord is distant we live as though he can come at any moment but we plant and plan as if it's a hundred years from now that's why brother branham when he preaches that house meeting called thy house he takes the believers a small group there in tifton georgia and he tells the parents he says let's make arrangements that this message will continue it's that which our children have something to walk in that was the responsibility let me just say tonight i thank god i hope those my daddy and the rest of them on the other on the other portals on the other side brother branham's listening and the rest of them thank you for going thank you for making arrangements for this moment they made arrangements for this moment we don't know how long we have here but we're proud to make arrangements david laid up not that he would build the temple but that it the reserves would be there for solomon to build it see this is where we close that same bank of scripture in james 4 that we read same same bank of scripture the very last scripture says in regards to that whole thought therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin so over and over brother bran would reiterate this don't put off tomorrow but you can do today because you may not have tomorrow you say oh i've heard that said before i've heard that said i've i've received that scare attack it's not a scare tactic but if there's not a fear of god if you're not standing where you are to be standing if there's not a fear of god that doesn't rattle your soul you're in bad shape because we are at the end many different things that i've been studying on the side and different things just looking at with events taking place things that where we're getting ready heading into you realize the prophet he identifies that that sixth vision and kamala hara stood there in that same dress and the way that he described it in daniel 6 70 weeks that's the way i wouldn't look it up the designer of the dress describes it with those exact same words you know we're at we're in that sixth vision the prophet identifies in the message shalom he said five visions have been fulfilled that's the sixth vision and before the seventh comes to pass where america is laid in craters and ashes the bride is gone how close are we [Applause] and then we have how many times you heard this down through the ages well i'm just waiting on california you'll be left behind well i'm waiting on this well if i'm predestinated i can't miss it that is a false spirit teaching trying to handle the word in a wrong way if you're predestinated you live like it you enter in you get with the program you line up with god's word you're not waiting for those things if you have to wait for those things it's because you don't love him and god ain't taking nobody with him that don't love him i know that's hard but it's a truth don't put off the bible says behold now is the day of salvation hallelujah in the book of ecclesiastes remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth it's a now thing now not tomorrow now you take the one young lady sat in the service i just heard the prophet say it the other day on marriage a lamb she said in that service and the and the word was going forth she was a preacher's daughter and she told brother random she said hold the nerve you've got to come preach in my daddy's pulpit like that he said i wasn't hired to come here i came here by an invitation but she turned down her last time and eventually brother brown made her on the street it didn't matter her daddy was the pastor it didn't matter what connection she had god was dealing with her heart because her daddy couldn't change her god's the only one who could change her and god was convicting her heart he was dealing with her life the way she was dressing and living and acting and that night she turned it down for the last time to even be able to walk up to the prophet of god in later years and offer him a drink of whiskey she said that was my last time preacher she said i could see my mama's soul frying hell like a pancake and it won't bother me why she put off put off to tomorrow but the bible says we're to take care of things today the bible says agree with an adversary while it is day let not the sun go down on thy wrath if you got a quarrel forgive me are you with me forgive don't put off don't boast that well i have an opportunity i have this don't boast love bounteth not charity is bound to the word it honors the word in readiness to live in a state of readiness so why a question at times i'm closing lord why wait why wait why that lives wait at times you know the longer a person i'm preaching on this whether is going to archives and everything else you know longer a person waits the harder it becomes it's a truth the rich young ruler this man he not only trusted in his riches but he trusted in his youth he trusted in his youth and he got it made he had everything going for him and he even told his soul soul take thy rest everything's good bigger barns are built it's good you never ever want to get away from the spirit of god and being sensitive to him even if he listened to me it should be god keep me tender keep me soft keep me humble and if you haven't surrendered your life all the way why not what are you waiting on what are you holding back on don't put off tomorrow what you can do today well i'll wait to this or i wait to that meeting or i'll wait don't boast against tomorrow amen well i'll wait you see how easy it becomes and then eventually it just becomes a church life comes just to church you're showing up to church and well i go to this church and i go to this church and that's all that's happening it's just going to a church but they're not in christ around the message where the promises of the living god have been confirmed have been made alive where all the blessings were the liberty rest but instead what's that i'll get it next service i'll wait till the next service listen friends there's not one of us that has the promise of tomorrow as i said moments ago look how quickly look how quickly the world changed when this virus come in that ought to be a wake-up call that'll be a wake-up call how quickly things have changed where there's brothers and sisters right now different ones they still can't meet we can meet thank god but there's some different countries and places they're not allowed to meet still you see this is where we want to make use of every opportunity amen as the lord jesus said and this is what our prayer should be in to thy hands i commit my spirit to the spirit of this age it looks and it goes on and says there the bible said to be scoffers mockers would rise and you know what they'd say there's the promise of his coming things continue on it's over this time that's in the world out there let me bring it down in here where you can hear oh oh yeah i've heard this preach and i know this and i know what's coming next and i can tell what's coming next and i can hear this and i know what's going to be sent here and i know it's going to be coming next and i can that's what he's talking about when it becomes all things continue on and missing noah preached the same message over and over there were scoffers that sat there and said i know what he's going to preach today what rain but there were those who hated his call it wasn't the world but his family listen to me it's more than just a natural family we're talking about the family of almighty god the word has a meaning to us you sense the the move the move of the holy spirit friends there's been transitions that has taken place even in this past year and not just this past year alone i've noticed transitions some of you may not you don't get out very much but i've never seen so much i'm talking about in youth meetings so much demonic manifestation where devils were they are that overtaken with spirit i've never seen so much of that in my life and working with young people those who are bound for hours and dealing with that dealing with that life to get them free that they let that spirit would take its hands off and release their life you know what that is that's a sign of where we're at that's why as a young person don't you put off today but for today what you think you can do tomorrow legion only had one beer it eventually led to two beers to four beers to six beers don't you look at that stuff on the internet it'll keep on going from one site to another site to hour after hour after hour don't put off deliverance for tomorrow when he's here right now boasts not against the lord but stand upon his word and you make that declaration i'm not going to be a church member i'm not just going to be somebody who's acquainted or around the message i'm not going to make excuses for things in my life i'm not going to make them say well i'm i'm making it a little bit but to look and say god you're the god of today you're the god of the now and whatever it is i give my life to you withholding nothing nothing nothing lord you complete me when that happens then he who has the future your life then is in his hands so then your future becomes clear you don't know maybe every little junction but it don't bother you he's leaving told the young people years ago he said like this i said you know there's things in your life that you plan on and you should there's natural attributes that's in your life whether it be a husband be a wife but god did not leave it to you that you'd have to search that out apart from his word but if you bury yourself in him and you look to him he is el shaddai he's the all-sufficient one he's the god who spoke in jeremiah 29 it says i know the thoughts i think concerning you to bring you to an expected inn because after all whoever god has for you and you for them you want to ensure it's in christ you can't miss god's will when you're yielded to his word amen the way of man is not in man to lead his son but there's a god who's here tonight that can change that life maybe you're on the internet maybe those that would archive this there's a god who's present that that god can speak to your heart and say now is the time speak to your heart and you can say lord i receive my healing now i receive my deliverance now lord i receive the holy spirit not just something you're just saying but you're you're being moved by the spirit of god it's a pulsation that's moving in your heart it's moving in your life listen how do i know i'll be able to do it you're looking at the wrong thing the god that you put your life in his hands it's no longer your life it's him all he's asking is is turn your life over let me i know what your future is let me come let me walk walk with me let me walk with you in your future because we don't know what the future holds can you stand with me we don't know what the future holds we don't know what the next moment holds friends listen we don't know there's so many things it's different things that even that have just been just studying as i said just just studying out on the side there's so many things that are to happen after we're gone after we're gone some things i was just studying here the other day and i thought about it ahead i had a question come to me sometime before brother graham is so clear all the way through daniel 70 weeks all through the first seal he'll move her into the fifth seal with it that covenant between rome and the jews we're not even here to see it the church is done caught away i don't have sometimes some of those things just kind of spill over but it's it's to point to the time we're at it's a time that the spirit of god could speak to the prophet and he would liken it to us standing in a train station seeing the events taking place all around us and he said then in 1963 he said it's time to throw the bag of peanuts down i don't know different ones many of you have traveled airports maybe not trains but there's been times when i've been in an airport you know i love my coffee you don't care about the food as long as i can get coffee not on an airplane either but there's times when i went i thought my see the flight gets in this time this flight leaves over here at three man i've got a two-hour window that i look on the on the map where is the coffee shop the place that i like oh it's in terminal f could i make it from terminal 8 to terminal see i'm trying to see how much time do i have do i have enough time to make it there and get back here for departure of my next flight maybe you know i'm a little hungry and i say oh they got a chick-fil-a here oh i wonder if i can go there oh it's down that way look at the time but you know there's been times where the plane itself [Music] supposed to get in at 12 and i wasn't supposed to board the next one until two or three something happened [Music] and the plane got there a little bit later then everything all the plans change then you've had times where on the plane supposed to be two o'clock that's when it is but it just so happened that plane was there a little bit early and they boarded [Music] now some of you know that you've had this happen if you haven't it can happen my mom had it happen to her i had it happen to myself going to mexico the one time we were there ahead of time but they closed the door [Music] it was so close it was just like 10 minutes we were there what am i saying we're living in a time when we don't have two hours [Music] we don't have time to make plans that put our lives first in god second i'm not saying brother sam you mean i'm not to plan on natural things in my life that's not what i said but don't become wrapped up with the peanuts [Music] it's a time to make sure it's a time to be sure i don't say that to scare you but it's a time to check up it's a time because the rapture it's upon us events the way things have been taken place nobody as far as some of the details let me just tell you something i've already seen two different videos of men who are pentecostal preachers one in the states and one in africa and they played these parts about brother branham and what was taking place there with kamala harris and that deep royal purple dress that's just two of them they're looking at that and saying it was a prophet of god but listen friends to you and i we recognize it's not just a prophet of god declaring this shall come to pass but a prophet is whom the word of the lord comes to when israel got out of line they still have the law still have the prophets still have the psalms they could say we've got our bible but they didn't have the word of the lord their lives were not matching the word [Music] so in order for them to come back into their inheritance god would send a prophet one who was in contact who could look over and see this is where you're to be this is what god has ordained you to be he's able to look into that realm and be able to speak down here and say this is where you belong it's an inspiration a breath of god to catch us into that place into position this is the this is the blessing as a young person [Music] all of our age we're blessed but you're not just blessed just to know it you're obey it you must walk in it you must become one with it let god so transform your life don't put off to tomorrow what can be done today because you may not have tomorrow i don't mean to go on i just these things there's a young man [Music] this past fall that accident in north carolina was about november or something like that [Music] both these young men been right there in me and in meetings it's set right there one of them was driving the car both believers i i don't know where everything was that i don't all i know is these were both young men it was a 15 16 17 is it all right 17-18 still young 17-18 and here's the one young man when they were driving in the car they got in a car accident and his friend another believer he passed away he died from that accident let me tell you something there's things sometimes and when we look at it we don't have a promise of tomorrow let me just say this to you people are so fearful of covet you know you're more likely to die of a car accident i'm not playing on words but i'm saying when you begin to look at now i'm not just saying this i've studied these things likelihoods of things and we want to pass these certain other things off it requires us putting our lives in god's hands you could be the best driver in the world you could have the best pilot in the world on the plane but that that that's not the man who's in control they built the titanic and the man says this ship is unsinkable [Music] there's no sinking to my life no matter what comes no matter what goes jesus is in my ship jesus is in my boat hallelujah i've seen these bumper stickers that said jesus is my co-pilot i don't want him as a co-pilot i want him as the [Applause] [Music] pilot let's just spell our hearts to him [Music] maybe
