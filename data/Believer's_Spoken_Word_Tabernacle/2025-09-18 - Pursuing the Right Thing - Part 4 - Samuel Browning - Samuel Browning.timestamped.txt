[9:27] you working on them, Lord Jesus. Help us
[9:29] to be salty, Lord. And hold on in faith.

[39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the house of the Lord. And
[39:13] certainly trust that the Lord will just
[39:14] come by our way once again this evening
[39:16] and just just speak to our hearts. God
[39:18] knows our needs.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; He knows what we have need of. Amen. So
[39:23] let's just approach him in a word of
[39:24] prayer here tonight.
[39:27] Heavenly Father,
[39:29] Lord, as we come before you, Lord, and
[39:33] with a heart, Lord, just full of
[39:35] thanksgiving, Lord, no matter, Lord, the
[39:39] conditions, Lord, of life, no matter the
[39:42] circumstances, our hearts are filled
[39:45] with thanksgiving, Lord. Father, even
[39:48] how Paul would direct us by your spirit
[39:51] that Lord even when we would make our
[39:54] petitions known and Lord things that we
[39:57] have on our heart and Lord he would
[40:00] express on to be thankful Lord giving
[40:04] Lord thanks unto you and Lord truly we
[40:07] have so much to be thankful for Lord
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Lord truly if there was not one more
[40:13] thing that you did Lord in our lives
[40:16] when you got a hold of us, Lord, and you
[40:19] melted our hearts down, Lord, and
[40:21] changed us, Lord. Oh, Father,
[40:25] &gt;&gt; that's where there's a real
[40:26] thanksgiving, Lord.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; It's an assurance, Lord, that moves in
[40:31] our hearts that no matter, Lord, the
[40:33] circumstances, Lord, there's a faith
[40:35] that governs, Lord, in our lives. And
[40:38] we're just so want to say thank you,
[40:40] Lord. Thank you for bringing us all
[40:42] together safely tonight, Lord. And I
[40:45] thank you for each and every one, Lord,
[40:46] of my brothers and sisters, Lord. And
[40:49] Father, all the effort and sacrifice
[40:51] that's been made, Lord, to put forth the
[40:54] effort, Lord, in being here. And Lord,
[40:56] we just ask that you would just now just
[40:59] as you're here, Lord. May you come and
[41:02] speak to us, Lord. Minister to our
[41:05] needs, Lord. You know what we have need
[41:07] of, Lord. And may you just, Lord, give
[41:09] to us, Lord. that which is Lord on your
[41:12] heart for this moment Lord. And may we
[41:14] Lord just Lord just be tender Lord just
[41:17] to hear from you Lord what it is that
[41:20] you want to say Lord. We just commit
[41:22] this service into your hands. We ask
[41:24] that you would forgive us Lord for our
[41:27] shortcomings Lord. And Father ask that
[41:29] the presence of God might just move for
[41:31] every need that's gathered here right
[41:33] now Lord. Father, we just commit this
[41:36] service into your hands in the precious
[41:38] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God
[41:42] bless you musicians. Amen. Thank you so
[41:46] much. I want to go right into the
[41:49] scripture here this evening.
[41:59] in Galatians chapter 3 and verse 26.
[42:06] Amen.
[42:13] Here
[42:20] in the beginning of the scripture it
[42:22] says for ye all are the children of God
[42:26] by faith
[42:28] in Christ Jesus.
[42:30] For as many of you has as has have been
[42:34] baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[42:40] Now, we know that there is a water
[42:42] baptism, but the water baptism when
[42:44] we're baptized in the name of the Lord
[42:46] Jesus Christ, that's we know that that's
[42:49] a a declaration of a clear conscience
[42:52] towards God. And those are that's where
[42:55] we are are making our identification
[42:58] with him. But then how God comes down
[43:01] and God makes his identification with us
[43:03] is when he does what no man can do and
[43:07] that's he baptizes us into himself.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes where I've asked
[43:14] maybe the deacons or someone else to say
[43:16] could you help me uh maybe to take care
[43:18] of this or so forth. But you know what?
[43:21] God has never pushed placed this on
[43:25] anyone else because no one else could do
[43:26] it. But God is the only one that
[43:30] baptizes and can baptize his children
[43:34] into his body.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Now, he'll work through his body, but
[43:38] it's all him doing it.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; So, good,
[43:41] &gt;&gt; right? So, there is neither Jew nor
[43:45] Greek. Now, watch how Paul brings this.
[43:48] There is neither Jew nor Greek. There is
[43:51] neither bond nor free. There is neither
[43:55] male nor female. For ye are all one in
[44:00] Christ Jesus. And if you be Christ, then
[44:04] are ye Abraham's seed and hes according
[44:08] to the promise. Amen. May God bless you
[44:11] and bless the reading of the word as
[44:12] you're being seated. I want to continue
[44:14] to
[44:16] try to tie up this portion of the
[44:19] thought where we've been looking at
[44:20] here. But um before I get into that, I
[44:24] know that uh perhaps many of you uh if
[44:27] not all have already heard that
[44:29] yesterday evening uh brother Ed Bisll
[44:33] went home to be with the Lord and um
[44:36] such a certainly a gallant a gallant
[44:39] soldier and uh a real witness and
[44:42] testimony
[44:43] uh of the message and um perhaps you
[44:46] know each one of us it's was the Lord
[44:49] that through brother Bisll's life that
[44:51] would touch our hearts in many different
[44:53] ways. um myself uh as I think I
[44:58] expressed that even on Sunday without
[45:00] even um you know you don't know what's
[45:02] coming but I expressed that of even how
[45:04] that uh through some of the services
[45:07] that even I had watched on videotape and
[45:10] how my heart was so encouraged even
[45:12] where certain things as a young man and
[45:15] um certain places and um you know uh
[45:19] messages that brother Bisll would speak.
[45:21] I remember one of the uh being there in
[45:24] the North Carolina camp meeting and one
[45:26] of the um I guess iconic messages he
[45:28] spoke, let us run. I was right there as
[45:31] a boy and um you know not really you
[45:35] know knowing the full impact of things
[45:37] but you know later on when God would
[45:39] really take a hold of my life well that
[45:41] that that message would have a real real
[45:44] significant real meaning. And but I
[45:46] remember sitting in those meetings as a
[45:48] young boy and I remember the prince of
[45:50] God coming down in those meetings in
[45:51] 1986 and how that when brother Bisco
[45:55] also took a message and spoke on the
[45:57] inspiration comes to the inspiraable and
[46:00] uh just speaking of God's inspiration
[46:02] poured out in this generation and uh
[46:05] just so many wonderful things you know
[46:07] and that's just me uh personally among
[46:10] many others um you know and but I so
[46:13] appreciate brother Bisll was certainly
[46:15] uh one that was a real um mission-minded
[46:19] and he had a burden upon his heart. You
[46:21] know, you you'll hear him, brother
[46:23] Brandham will refer to him in many many
[46:25] places in the message. And I appreciate
[46:27] the testimonies that brother Biscll had
[46:29] shared and even in coming into
[46:32] uh the latter years of life when he
[46:34] would uh even go into that of the brown
[46:37] bear and begin to speak of that and he
[46:40] took time and dealt with and dealt with
[46:42] all of that and bringing out that
[46:44] background uh within that time. And you
[46:47] know there was um uh many things when we
[46:50] um you know you look at it I always one
[46:52] thing I always appreciated too about
[46:54] brother Bisco is that because I I
[46:56] certainly believe this that anything we
[46:58] do for the Lord we don't want to do
[47:00] anything less for him than we would do
[47:02] for our own home.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; We want to give 100%. And that's a very
[47:07] thing that brother Bisco everything that
[47:09] was was done and I I don't say that to
[47:11] elevate brother Bisco. just say that
[47:12] that's I believe that that's when God
[47:15] lays on our heart to do something. We
[47:16] just don't want to do something just
[47:18] just anyway. We want to believe God and
[47:21] look to God and know that God is a
[47:22] supplier. God supplies all of our needs
[47:25] and God has a way and he he does those
[47:27] things. And so uh I just always
[47:30] appreciated that appreciate you know the
[47:32] mission that was all those the burden
[47:34] that was set with a real burden was to
[47:36] get the message out. And I certainly
[47:38] believe that that is something that has
[47:41] certainly been able to be accomplished.
[47:43] And so we're just thankful for that. And
[47:45] we want to remember um you know, brother
[47:48] Biscll's family and the church there uh
[47:51] in prayer. And I know that he had been
[47:53] um you know dealing with some things
[47:56] there for for a few years but uh still
[47:59] nonetheless you know that's a real
[48:00] patriarch and there of that assembly and
[48:03] how God used uh brother Bisll within in
[48:06] that assembly to um gather uh those
[48:10] individuals together. As a matter of
[48:11] fact many of them including like brother
[48:13] Tom Ray, brother Tom Ray who's the
[48:15] pastor now. These were individuals who
[48:16] were druggies on the street. And brother
[48:19] Biscoll opened his home and he he
[48:22] actually had a house and he brought all
[48:24] of them together and he and his burden
[48:26] was it was to minister to these young
[48:29] people. And so now these young people
[48:30] are no longer the young people but now
[48:32] they're uh the older ones. But brother
[48:34] Bisco had such of that that burden.
[48:36] Brother Bisco, you know, so many
[48:38] different things that you know you you
[48:40] you see um and you hear within it that
[48:43] was so good. so many uh different things
[48:45] that um I just had received you know
[48:48] just at different times listening to
[48:50] admonition and things like that with
[48:52] ministers and just really one who's been
[48:54] through um a lot of in the journey and
[48:57] just being an encouragement and I I
[48:59] didn't altogether always hear that being
[49:01] there directly to hear him I would have
[49:03] to hear that sometimes by a recording
[49:06] but nonetheless I'm thankful uh because
[49:08] I you know I look to me there's there's
[49:10] other men that I you know that God
[49:12] places in your path and sometimes It's
[49:14] not that I, you know, they won't say too
[49:16] much. Some of the the brothers I would
[49:17] have as mentors, they don't say too
[49:19] much, but I but I've been cute enough to
[49:21] just watch them watch how watch how they
[49:24] approach certain things and and how they
[49:25] go about it. And I'm so thankful that
[49:28] God has has faithful men within within
[49:31] the body. And I'm grateful that God has
[49:33] among us as a believer's faithful one
[49:36] another that we're not just have to look
[49:37] to men or ministry, but it's the same
[49:39] Holy Spirit that challenges our lives to
[49:42] be a reflection and that's the same
[49:44] working of the Holy Spirit in our lives
[49:46] one to another. And so I really believe
[49:48] that with all my heart. And so I just
[49:52] want to say that was just such a uh this
[49:55] morning when uh when I'd received that
[49:57] news and I know it was from yesterday
[49:59] but uh just so many of the different
[50:00] testimonies just coming in on the text
[50:02] thread there today uh from things from
[50:05] how God had used brother Bisco in so
[50:07] many different ways but you know here we
[50:09] are and and we're going to continue on.
[50:11] We we press on towards the coming of the
[50:13] Lord. Um it's sure that you know we're
[50:16] we're very close at at any time and at
[50:19] any any moment um we're certainly living
[50:22] in that time. So we want to take a look
[50:26] here once again in this thought of
[50:28] pursuing
[50:29] uh the right thing. And when we see this
[50:33] within how that Paul would uh lay this
[50:37] out in the scripture, what when we see
[50:39] just looking back at that scripture,
[50:41] Paul would he would have to deal with so
[50:44] many different things that were among
[50:46] the believers uh within that hour. You
[50:48] had as he mentioned in the scripture
[50:50] there, you had Jew, you had Greek, you
[50:52] had bond free, male and female. And God
[50:55] never did away with any of that as far
[50:58] as Jew or Greek or bond or free. As a
[51:01] matter of fact, Paul would even admonish
[51:03] those who would come into the body and
[51:05] maybe they were uh bond or slaves. And
[51:08] it's not how in our terminology or think
[51:10] of it, but many times like even when
[51:12] I've been into the Philippines and other
[51:14] places, they'll have a maid or a house
[51:16] uh attendant servant that just
[51:18] completely focuses on the house and
[51:21] keeping the house and, you know, fixing
[51:23] meals and things like that. and it works
[51:24] for that employment and it just
[51:26] sometimes of being in other countries in
[51:28] that way. And yet Paul would would
[51:30] admonish even the believers to be
[51:33] mindful in that hour even how their
[51:36] attitudes and their thoughts towards one
[51:37] another and to think how God would take
[51:40] as we've been looking at this a
[51:41] gathering and a group of people that is
[51:43] so diverse and so different but God
[51:47] himself would come into every heart into
[51:50] each life and through the baptism of the
[51:53] Holy Ghost that's what unites us
[51:55] together. It's not it's not our
[51:58] backgrounds. A lot of times we can be
[52:01] united by, oh yeah, I've been through
[52:02] that. Oh, I've come through this. Oh,
[52:04] you lived in that area of Lorraine. I
[52:06] lived there, too. Oh, you went to that
[52:08] school. I did, too. Those are
[52:09] backgrounds that we can talk about in
[52:12] fellowship. But yet, there's got to be a
[52:14] deeper fellowship than just the things
[52:17] we have in common upon just this one
[52:19] realm. There's got to be a fellowship
[52:21] that's deeper. Because when there's
[52:23] things that we don't see eye to eye on
[52:25] or we don't see eye to eye with one
[52:27] another and even of those that we might
[52:30] seem to see exactly eye to eye given
[52:32] enough time, sat around long enough,
[52:34] there's things you're going to find that
[52:36] you'll disagree with. And so God God
[52:39] permits all of all of this. And you
[52:41] know, if God wanted to when he gave us
[52:43] the Holy Spirit, he could take every
[52:45] little bit uh and and make every one of
[52:48] us to where we would all think the same
[52:50] way. And you would say, "Well, brother
[52:51] Samuel, that that should really be just
[52:53] a given." If it was a given, then Paul
[52:55] would not have to write an admonishment
[52:58] or Peter and say, "Be of the same mind."
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Where Paul would have to write even in
[53:03] the in the opening of Philippians
[53:05] chapter 4. And he would remind two
[53:06] sisters in the church to to be mindful
[53:10] to be of one mind. And evidently,
[53:12] whatever it was, they were made might
[53:14] have been kind of getting off to
[53:15] themselves, but the spirit of God would
[53:17] call them back into that place. And it
[53:19] didn't mean that we're all thinking the
[53:21] same thing because we're not always
[53:22] going to think the same way. But if
[53:24] we're looking at the same thing and our
[53:26] focus is on the right thing and we're
[53:28] looking and that is him. It's not one
[53:31] another, it's him. And if we're looking
[53:33] to him in all things, then that's what's
[53:36] going to stabilize us and give us the
[53:38] grace that we have need of through the
[53:41] love of God to be able to overlook and
[53:44] not even pay attention and focus on the
[53:47] differences. So when Paul is dealing
[53:50] with this on this on the unity uh within
[53:53] the body and I certainly believe that
[53:55] that's something that's worth pursuing.
[53:57] Paul would write in 1 Corinthians 12 and
[54:00] verse 12 he says for as the body is one
[54:03] and hath many members and all the
[54:04] members of that one body being many are
[54:07] one body so also is Christ. For by one
[54:11] spirit are we all baptized into one
[54:14] body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
[54:17] whether we be bond or free, and have
[54:20] been all made to drink into one spirit.
[54:23] For the body is not one member, but
[54:26] many. And then Paul would go on and say,
[54:29] for we being many are one bread and one
[54:33] body, for we are partakers of that one
[54:37] bread, which does that life. What has
[54:40] made us one is not because we're all a
[54:43] part of the same church.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; It's not because we all everyone even to
[54:49] whatever degree subscribes to believing
[54:52] the message. That's not what makes us
[54:53] one.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; What makes us one is Christ in every
[55:00] individual heart.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; That's what makes us one. And that's
[55:06] what gives the that's what it brings the
[55:09] unity. And then that's where we draw the
[55:11] strength to approach unity with the
[55:15] right perspective.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; When we're not working to get unity in
[55:20] in a in a horizontal realm, the
[55:22] horizontal itself that there is an
[55:25] effect. If we're lined up vertically
[55:27] with God in the right way, then that
[55:30] will have an effect and will even give
[55:32] us the wisdom and the grace, whatever's
[55:34] needed on the horizontal plane.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; But yet all the way through with the
[55:40] scriptures, Paul would admonish this uh
[55:42] by the spirit of God. Ver verse four of
[55:44] Ephesians 4, there is one body and one
[55:47] spirit even as you are called in one
[55:51] hope of your calling. So notice, brother
[55:56] Brandham makes a statement. He says,
[55:58] "When one member suffers, all members
[56:01] suffers." What God is coming to one of
[56:04] these days, brother, is a church without
[56:07] spot or wrinkle. He's coming to a
[56:09] spiritfilled church that divinely love
[56:12] of God so welded to their hearts
[56:15] together that they'll walk as one.
[56:19] Right.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Not that not that they the oneness is
[56:24] dealing with that they see everything
[56:26] you know that's the great that's the
[56:28] great that shows the greatness of God
[56:32] among us
[56:33] &gt;&gt; is where there can be there can be
[56:36] differences but the differences is not
[56:38] what we focus on
[56:41] &gt;&gt; because there are there we always know
[56:43] that it's just like in your marriage you
[56:45] don't focus on the differences if you
[56:48] focus on the differences pretty soon
[56:50] it's going to become a divide. Right.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; It's it's what it's not just something
[56:55] well you know well this just happens. It
[56:58] happens because things are being focused
[57:01] on differences and let me tell you when
[57:03] differences start to matter. Differences
[57:06] start to matter when you get away from
[57:08] God's presence.
[57:10] The very first thing when you when
[57:12] things start standing out and you find
[57:14] yourself getting a little, you know,
[57:15] critical here or whatever more, that's a
[57:17] sign. Not that the other person, they
[57:20] might be as wrong as wrong can be, but
[57:22] what that's a sign of is you're out of
[57:25] your God-given place. And that is to
[57:28] dwell in the love of God.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; That's why Jude said, "Keep yourselves
[57:32] in the love of God."
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. keep our lives submerged in him in
[57:38] with in in in in in his life. So notice
[57:42] it's this is what God's coming after uh
[57:44] church that spiritfilled divinely love
[57:47] of God so welded uh their hearts
[57:50] together that they'll walk as one. So
[57:53] when you know uh there's many in here
[57:55] different ones that you know uh when the
[57:58] in order to weld or what when things are
[58:01] welded together there's got to be some
[58:03] heat. There's got to be things that that
[58:05] bring two or more parts together. And
[58:09] you know when God it ain't like you know
[58:11] when we look at whether you know it's a
[58:13] fabricated uh moore deck or it's a you
[58:16] know you see beams on a building and you
[58:19] can tell where that weld is at. If you
[58:22] look in those steel buildings you can
[58:24] see where in and the beams sometimes you
[58:26] can look on bridges and you can see
[58:27] where they had to weld those parts
[58:29] together. But when God welds our hearts
[58:33] together it's not something that sticks
[58:36] out like a sore thumb. But what it is,
[58:39] it's Christ in the heart of each
[58:42] individual. And it's actually not us
[58:45] uniting with one another. It's Christ
[58:48] uniting with himself.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; So it's not something that is not all
[58:55] together like standing out as a joint
[58:57] that's been welded, but it is it is
[59:00] manifested in that there are hearts that
[59:03] are united by the love of God. Now I
[59:08] want to just say it in this way that you
[59:10] know this is why that you know in in the
[59:14] presence of God it you know many times
[59:17] as we can come into God's presence and
[59:20] we should but we realize that it's it's
[59:24] got to be more than just us coming to a
[59:27] service or just coming into his presence
[59:30] and you know our thoughts are changed a
[59:32] little bit but it's it's got to come
[59:34] even to a place to where there's
[59:36] evaluation that on. I need there's got
[59:38] to be something deeper if it's not
[59:40] there. Something that's deeper than just
[59:43] a a a feeling, but a but a depth in my
[59:47] life that no matter when I leave out of
[59:49] the presence of one another, that love
[59:52] is abiding in my heart. And that love is
[59:55] what is motivating me.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; And that love what I'm talking about is
[1:00:01] God. That part of God, the Holy Spirit
[1:00:04] in our lives.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of this. Brother
[1:00:09] Bram says in in here in 1955, he says,
[1:00:12] "We are brothers. We might disagree upon
[1:00:15] different things, but we're still
[1:00:18] brothers and sisters.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; We love each other when the love of God
[1:00:24] is in our hearts. even being enemies, if
[1:00:27] we have any, which we probably have, but
[1:00:29] still we love them anyhow because no
[1:00:32] matter what estate they're in, they're
[1:00:35] God's children fallen, but they're God's
[1:00:38] children. Yet,
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I want just I mean just just to meditate
[1:00:43] on that just a moment. Differences. God
[1:00:46] even allows differences even as you know
[1:00:49] you can sit down as I said before and
[1:00:51] talk long enough. I could sit down with
[1:00:53] another minister long enough. I've sat
[1:00:55] down at breakfast and and and and
[1:00:58] speaking across the table and just, you
[1:01:00] know, just just establishing fellowship
[1:01:02] and those things and there can be things
[1:01:04] that are said and you say, "Brother
[1:01:06] Samuel, what do you do at that moment?"
[1:01:08] Well, I'm not there to correct
[1:01:09] everybody.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; I don't jump to correct people.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You see, within it, there might be
[1:01:16] something if we're fellowshipping one
[1:01:17] pastor to another and I can look at it
[1:01:20] and they can kind of they can enough to
[1:01:21] get the hint. I can't go along with
[1:01:23] that.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Right. Right
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; now, it isn't that I'm right, but I've
[1:01:27] got to have confidence on where I'm
[1:01:28] standing because when someone says
[1:01:30] something, that's where I want to say,
[1:01:31] well, how how are you drawing that from
[1:01:34] scripture?
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? I I
[1:01:38] want to know where you're drawing that
[1:01:39] from scripture. And if you're drawing
[1:01:41] that from scripture, I want to know
[1:01:43] where's the quote we're standing on.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Because if brother Brandham did not go
[1:01:48] into that and did not say that I'm not
[1:01:50] walking after him. We we've been
[1:01:52] delivered from presuming.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; You see the message the message God
[1:01:58] brought a message and that prophet. It's
[1:02:00] not his mind. It's he's that vitro
[1:02:03] needle that's put on the record to
[1:02:05] release God's thoughts. Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; It's not exalting brother Random, but
[1:02:10] it's simply recognizing the voice of who
[1:02:13] it was that spoke through that prophet.
[1:02:15] Now, if a person wants to stand upon
[1:02:18] that, we're not I'm not going to argue
[1:02:20] with that. Let's just go ahead and let's
[1:02:21] serve God. But you know what? There's a
[1:02:24] part of it when we should be able to
[1:02:26] talk about things.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; And if talking about things, then we
[1:02:32] can't have breakfast anymore because of
[1:02:34] a disagreement. Something's wrong
[1:02:36] somewhere.
[1:02:38] Are you hearing me? Something's wrong
[1:02:40] somewhere. Let me just tell you, you
[1:02:42] have to fight that tendency within your
[1:02:45] flesh. Because when the Holy Ghost has
[1:02:47] come, the love of God is not in your
[1:02:49] flesh.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; It's not in your spirit. The love of God
[1:02:52] is in your soul.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; That's why the love of God has got to be
[1:02:56] in your soul. Because the prophet tells
[1:02:58] us and Christ revealed in his own word,
[1:03:00] you can love God and go to hell. because
[1:03:03] he said by your spirit in the human
[1:03:06] spirit. People just have a love of God,
[1:03:08] but it's not a revelation. It's not a
[1:03:11] real seal of the Holy Spirit. It's not a
[1:03:14] real love for God, for his word. It's
[1:03:17] just enamored with a personality,
[1:03:19] enamored with just his presence and oh,
[1:03:21] his presence, how it makes me feel. But
[1:03:23] it's not about it. That's still selfish.
[1:03:26] But when the love of God is there on the
[1:03:28] inside, you're there for him. Your your
[1:03:31] pursuit is for him. Your pursuit your
[1:03:34] love is for him is for the word. And
[1:03:37] whatever the word would ask of your
[1:03:39] life, Lord, so be it in my life.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; That is amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; That's a love in our life that no test,
[1:03:47] no trial can ever overthrow.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; That's why it's got to be deeper because
[1:03:55] because just in the spirit realm, it's a
[1:03:57] wonderful place, but it's got to go
[1:03:59] deeper.
[1:04:01] Now I'm speaking that because there can
[1:04:03] be across the board and how God would
[1:04:06] encourage every heart, every one of our
[1:04:08] hearts because I certainly believe if
[1:04:10] Paul could write through the scriptures
[1:04:13] under the inspiration of God and
[1:04:15] admonish the the believers that they he
[1:04:19] was already seeing God's love expressed
[1:04:21] through their life. But he would
[1:04:23] minister to them and and challenge them
[1:04:26] that it would abound more,
[1:04:29] that it would increase more.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; So, it shouldn't be that that's a sign.
[1:04:34] If it's if it's something that's pulling
[1:04:36] back, something's wrong,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Something's wrong. And and let me just
[1:04:42] say this. There's nothing wrong. We can
[1:04:45] we can look at one another, but it's not
[1:04:47] one another. Right?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; If we're pulling back, it's not because
[1:04:52] of somebody else. It's because we're
[1:04:54] living outside of the source of strength
[1:04:57] that is that we were meant to live by.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Woo! Man, I didn't know how we were
[1:05:03] getting here.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is where God coming
[1:05:07] to en encourage us. You might say,
[1:05:10] "Well, that don't sound very
[1:05:11] encouraging." But it's to look at, you
[1:05:13] know, if you approach problems the same
[1:05:16] way that you've always approached them
[1:05:18] that it's somebody else, you're going to
[1:05:20] always get the same results.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; But you've got to recognize as a son and
[1:05:24] daughter of God. We've got to bring this
[1:05:26] word into flesh.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And it's not up to me to do it or you.
[1:05:30] It's up to us to yield. And if sons and
[1:05:32] daughters of God are going to rule and
[1:05:34] reign upon this earth, then we got to
[1:05:36] start and rule and reign over this part
[1:05:38] of the earth that we are placed in right
[1:05:40] now.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; There's no ruling or reigning when we
[1:05:45] feel good.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; There's no ruling or reigning when
[1:05:49] everything's going our way. Everybody's
[1:05:50] thinking our way. Everybody's, you know,
[1:05:52] just just catering. That's that's that
[1:05:54] that's not it. But the challenge is when
[1:05:57] love when divine love will really show
[1:05:59] itself is when everything else around us
[1:06:03] is not going our way.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And I'm not even talking about in
[1:06:07] disagreements. I'm talking about even in
[1:06:09] those moments where we don't feel like
[1:06:11] it or the conditions are not present
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; that make us feel loving.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; How many thankful for the love of God?
[1:06:27] Now watch, I read this scripture to you
[1:06:29] last week, but I want to move from here
[1:06:31] and and jump forward. Paul is writing to
[1:06:33] them at Lady Oia at the churches there
[1:06:36] in Asia Minor and he said that his he he
[1:06:40] that their hearts verse two might be
[1:06:43] comforted, encouraged,
[1:06:46] being knit together in love. If there
[1:06:48] ever was an hour and a time that we need
[1:06:50] encourage, we need encouragement.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We need every one of
[1:06:56] us need encouragement.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just don't you don't
[1:06:59] realize the the pressures of things that
[1:07:03] that that that people can be going
[1:07:05] through. And it's not about you know you
[1:07:07] you uh discerning that or or thinking of
[1:07:10] it's just to realize as a body just as
[1:07:12] much as you would take care of your body
[1:07:15] and you would supply certain things that
[1:07:17] are needed. You know certain things are
[1:07:19] needed. Sometimes you do things without
[1:07:21] it even having to be thought. You you
[1:07:23] you think about when you're at the
[1:07:24] store, I'm going to buy things for
[1:07:25] lunch. You think you go you go to the
[1:07:27] store, we've got to we've got to
[1:07:29] provide, you know, for this for for
[1:07:30] dinner, one or more. You're thinking
[1:07:32] ahead,
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; right? You're thinking of your own body.
[1:07:36] Of course, your family as well, too. But
[1:07:38] that's the same thing, but in a greater
[1:07:40] way for us as a body of believers that
[1:07:43] that God would would desire to minister
[1:07:47] through to through us to one another
[1:07:50] encouragement.
[1:07:51] Anybody
[1:07:54] ever been discouraged?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes sometimes the
[1:08:01] discouragement can come even from the
[1:08:03] toils of life.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Just just from the pressure just from
[1:08:08] not even when maybe approaching certain
[1:08:10] things you know as a family or one or
[1:08:12] more how do I approach this? How do I go
[1:08:14] about this? And sometimes you're you're
[1:08:15] waiting you're praying and you're
[1:08:17] looking to go for an answer. You know,
[1:08:18] the Bible tells us in the book of
[1:08:20] Galatians, "Be not weary in welloing."
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; For if we faint not, we shall reap.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Oh God, if there's ever an hour that we
[1:08:30] need that encouragement and strength, oh
[1:08:33] God, let that encouragement, it's not
[1:08:35] going to come from out there.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not knocking anybody from out there,
[1:08:40] but I'm saying that God has put this
[1:08:42] body together. That encouragement should
[1:08:45] be a vital part in the body. Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Sure, we we can have, you know, you have
[1:08:53] different ones and you know, I've had
[1:08:54] people even when I was working, well,
[1:08:56] you you ought to go do this, Sam. You
[1:08:57] ought to go do this. You'll be good at
[1:08:58] this. You'll be fine at this. You'll be
[1:08:59] good at this. You'll be good at that.
[1:09:00] But you know what's different with all
[1:09:02] that? It's all things that is
[1:09:04] encouraging based on what can just be
[1:09:06] seen with a carnal carnal understanding.
[1:09:08] It's not something that's spiritual.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; That's why we want to be careful even
[1:09:15] what we're encouraging. We don't want to
[1:09:17] we don't want to encourage someone out
[1:09:19] of the will of God.
[1:09:22] Just look at this. Being knit together
[1:09:25] in love and unto all riches of the full
[1:09:28] assurance of understanding to the
[1:09:31] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[1:09:33] of the Father and of Christ, in whom are
[1:09:37] hid all the treasures of wisdom and
[1:09:41] knowledge.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:09:44] Why would Satan want disunityity?
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, let's just go the opposite
[1:09:50] brother Brandham did in the church age
[1:09:51] book when when it said bringing out the
[1:09:53] revelations, thou hast not known the
[1:09:55] depths of Satan. Brother Brham says, how
[1:09:57] we understand it is go back to see what
[1:09:59] is the depths of God.
[1:10:01] So to think within this, why would Satan
[1:10:05] want disunityity? Why would he battle
[1:10:07] against this?
[1:10:09] Because it's through when unity is there
[1:10:13] and it doesn't you know when you have to
[1:10:15] press through and unity because here
[1:10:18] what leads what comes from that in unity
[1:10:21] is God unveiling more of himself not
[1:10:25] only to us but in us and through us.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; We grow in these times. Listen to me
[1:10:34] now.
[1:10:36] It's wonderful as we come to the house
[1:10:37] of God. But your growth is not
[1:10:40] altogether here.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; You're admonished by the ministering of
[1:10:45] the word.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; The word will point out areas in our
[1:10:49] life as Christ comes. Oh, this is where
[1:10:51] I need to be given my attention to. You
[1:10:53] know how it is when you sit down and you
[1:10:55] might think certain things are
[1:10:57] important, but God comes back around or
[1:10:59] in a group of individuals who sat down
[1:11:01] and you realize what you're looking at
[1:11:02] and are tunnel visioned on is really not
[1:11:05] what we need to be tunnel visioned on.
[1:11:07] and God will bring our attention to what
[1:11:10] we need to give ourselves to. And it
[1:11:12] doesn't when we give ourselves to it,
[1:11:15] that's the start of yielding to it and
[1:11:17] saying amen to the word of God. And when
[1:11:19] we're yielding and saying amen to the
[1:11:21] word of God, then God can begin to deal
[1:11:23] with our life and we can begin to see as
[1:11:26] Paul is pointing out right here, there's
[1:11:29] an assurance of understanding. What's
[1:11:31] happening when our hearts are are
[1:11:33] knitted together in love? There's an
[1:11:34] assurance of understanding. You know
[1:11:36] where you where you're standing. You
[1:11:38] know where you're standing.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; It's when things get out of line
[1:11:47] in a person's life
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; that causes them to get indifferent with
[1:11:51] somebody else.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; It's not the other person.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; It's okay if you don't say, "Amen. I'm
[1:11:58] just going to I'm just dropping this in
[1:12:00] here tonight. It's this is this is this
[1:12:03] is this is meat on the bones. Yes, it
[1:12:06] is.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; These are things that when through that,
[1:12:09] you know, when let me just tell you when
[1:12:11] you know you're you're in fellowship
[1:12:13] with God, there's nothing between you
[1:12:14] and God. There's nothing in your heart.
[1:12:17] There's no unforgiven. There's no
[1:12:19] grudge. Everything is cleared out.
[1:12:20] Everything is clean. You know where
[1:12:22] you're standing. You're open. You're
[1:12:24] available. And you know what? There is a
[1:12:26] strength. There is a strength of God's
[1:12:28] love operating in your life. It doesn't
[1:12:31] matter what comes your way. Where you're
[1:12:33] drawing your strength from is from him.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Really good.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not we're not putting this to
[1:12:40] highlight Jew or Greek, bond or free,
[1:12:43] male or female. Well, I have to be this
[1:12:45] brother. I have to. No. No. Every one of
[1:12:47] us have access in the body that we have
[1:12:50] been baptized into.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have access if we're in
[1:12:54] the body and the love of God is in our
[1:12:57] hearts.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] unto I wish I had more time to spend on
[1:13:02] that to the acknowledgment of the
[1:13:04] mystery of God of the Father and of
[1:13:06] Christ. To be able to recognize Christ
[1:13:10] in your life
[1:13:13] to be able to see him working in your
[1:13:15] life to know what his expectation is of
[1:13:18] our lives. Surely he didn't save us and
[1:13:21] fill us with the Holy Ghost that we
[1:13:23] would just sit around.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; And you understand what I mean by sit
[1:13:26] around. I mean to where we become
[1:13:28] complacent. But that's not it don't work
[1:13:30] that way. The prophet said in stature of
[1:13:32] a perfect man the opening quotes he said
[1:13:35] anyone who has ever come in contact with
[1:13:38] God and in part of his divine nature you
[1:13:42] can't get enough of him. You want to
[1:13:46] know more about him that you might
[1:13:47] become more like him.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And brother Random uses an example. He
[1:13:52] said it's like I told my wife. He said
[1:13:54] that I love her so much. I just like the
[1:13:56] puller inside of me to be that much more
[1:13:59] closer.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; There's a desire. I want to be more like
[1:14:04] him.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Is that your desire?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; I I want I want his life, his patience.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; His virtue, his temperance,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; his life, his godliness. I want that.
[1:14:18] That's that's that's that's what we're
[1:14:19] called to in this hour. You may never
[1:14:21] walk on the water. Don't let that become
[1:14:23] your ambition. Hallelujah.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "Though I speak
[1:14:27] with tongue and men angels," he wasn't
[1:14:29] diminishing anything as we've been
[1:14:31] saying. What he was saying is is the
[1:14:33] right thing to be focused on that
[1:14:36] actually gives value to any gift
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; is the love of God.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Notice as Paul would write here,
[1:14:50] think about this. knitted together. Paul
[1:14:54] wrote in another place, tempered
[1:14:57] together. Now watch this. As a body as
[1:15:00] we refer to this as a body and Paul
[1:15:03] speaking of this of why he would give
[1:15:05] the ministry to we all come in the unity
[1:15:08] of the faith and the knowledge of the
[1:15:10] son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[1:15:13] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:15:15] of Christ.
[1:15:17] Now see God God works. He starts from
[1:15:20] the foundation of faith of supernatural
[1:15:24] revelation by the new birth. And God
[1:15:27] builds his church as he builds every
[1:15:31] individual. And God is bringing us all
[1:15:34] growing up into Christ in all things.
[1:15:38] Now, where do those things come? Brother
[1:15:40] Brandon will spin all the way the
[1:15:42] countless number of times and he'll
[1:15:43] refer back, you know, to stature of
[1:15:45] perfect man and blasphemous names as a
[1:15:48] real key. and he opened these things. He
[1:15:50] says, "You don't put peacock feathers in
[1:15:53] a blackbird."
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "You first must be born again.
[1:15:58] Then those feathers come out on their
[1:16:02] own
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; as we will yield to that." So, it's
[1:16:05] Christ working in our life bringing
[1:16:08] there's a maturity and in this hour,
[1:16:11] this is the hour of sons and daughters
[1:16:13] of God to come into full adoption. This
[1:16:17] is the hour for the capstone itself to
[1:16:20] set down in rapturing grace. I know
[1:16:22] we're under the effect of it, but when
[1:16:24] that capstone absolutely sets down, not
[1:16:27] in symbol form, but when it sets down,
[1:16:30] the rapture goes,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; we've received a capstone revelation to
[1:16:37] bring us what? into position into
[1:16:40] condition to mature the church of the
[1:16:43] living God and to draw us up unto him in
[1:16:47] all things.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; You know that those are not my words.
[1:16:52] That's the prophet's word. He said when
[1:16:53] that capstone when this church has
[1:16:55] finally come to its place, the capstone
[1:16:57] sets and up we go in rapture.
[1:17:02] So I want you to think of this here in
[1:17:05] Ephesians 4:15, brother Ram or Paul
[1:17:08] says, "But speaking the truth in love
[1:17:11] may grow up into him in all things.
[1:17:17] Growth is not overnight,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; It's not overnight.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; But growth is ongoing."
[1:17:26] Let me just say this to you right now.
[1:17:28] No matter where you're at, you've never
[1:17:30] come to an end of growing in your
[1:17:32] patience.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You've never come to an end of growing
[1:17:35] in virtue.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, your faith, Brother
[1:17:38] Samuel, your faith, yeah, Paul pointed
[1:17:39] out in in the Thessalonian church, your
[1:17:42] faith aboundeth.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; See your faith, that's why brother Bram
[1:17:46] 1965, wings of a snow white dove in
[1:17:48] prayer. Oh God, those seven angels that
[1:17:52] descended there that morning. Oh, what
[1:17:54] has dropped from that revelation has led
[1:17:57] me to a faith I never had before.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; See, his faith was growing.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Growing by what?
[1:18:07] It wasn't the things that was going on,
[1:18:09] but it was how God had revealed himself
[1:18:12] and making himself known. And the
[1:18:14] prophet experiencing that in in his own
[1:18:16] life, it brought him to that place.
[1:18:20] Same thing with patience. Same thing
[1:18:22] with virtue. Same thing with temperance.
[1:18:24] Same thing with all these. It continues
[1:18:26] to grow. But I just want to stay focused
[1:18:28] here on this with of this of the love of
[1:18:31] God and the body. And I want you to
[1:18:32] watch how this is mentioned
[1:18:35] which is the head even Christ. So we're
[1:18:39] under his under his leadership. It's
[1:18:42] it's God that is cultivating our lives.
[1:18:45] It's God that's working on our lives.
[1:18:47] When you plant, look at even what I had.
[1:18:49] We planted out here last year
[1:18:52] and we went and planted this out here,
[1:18:54] rolled out the black tarp and we put
[1:18:57] that out and we begin to plant those
[1:18:59] plants.
[1:19:00] I'm going to tell you, I'm glad that we
[1:19:02] did it
[1:19:03] because when I go around and take take a
[1:19:05] little break of a day, I want to go
[1:19:07] around and check the plants. I check for
[1:19:09] weeds. Let me just tell you something
[1:19:10] about weeds. You find this at your own
[1:19:13] home. I have found weeds. How I how this
[1:19:16] happens, I can't explain it. But I have
[1:19:19] found weeds that look like hydrangeia
[1:19:21] plants,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; the leaves. And I start looking them and
[1:19:25] when I look, I keep walking by and I
[1:19:27] think that don't look the same.
[1:19:29] Something's different. I start looking.
[1:19:32] Weeds can come up so subtly.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; I've watched this. I've watched it when
[1:19:38] it comes to my roses. I've watched it
[1:19:39] when it comes even right out here. How
[1:19:42] that happens, I don't know.
[1:19:45] It would be easy if they had all stood
[1:19:46] out like a sore thumb.
[1:19:49] But you have to go around. You have to
[1:19:50] inspect. You have to even loosen up the
[1:19:53] soil. But even with weeds that I've went
[1:19:55] and pulled, and I know some of the other
[1:19:57] brothers have have done some of the
[1:19:58] things, they just thankfully they did
[1:20:00] pull up pretty easy. But there's an
[1:20:02] ongoing keeping of that bed. If it
[1:20:04] wasn't kept or around your house,
[1:20:06] eventually the weeds would take over.
[1:20:09] All right.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; This is why that within that within that
[1:20:13] garden, within the bed, within our
[1:20:16] lives, it's something that's to be
[1:20:18] tended to that Christ will remain
[1:20:21] preeminent in our lives and our lives do
[1:20:24] not become full of weeds.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; We're gardeners, right?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam was a gardener.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Christ himself a gardener.
[1:20:40] So notice, from whom the whole body
[1:20:43] fitly joined together, and compacted by
[1:20:46] that which every joint supplieth,
[1:20:49] according to the effectual working in
[1:20:51] the measure of every part, maketh
[1:20:53] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:20:56] of itself in love.
[1:20:59] So the body you think about this when
[1:21:02] this within the body there is so much
[1:21:05] connective tissue in the body
[1:21:10] and one of the one of the things that is
[1:21:12] spoke of right here is how that every
[1:21:14] joint supply
[1:21:17] and you know when joints that's where a
[1:21:20] lot of times where arthritis will set in
[1:21:22] something has affected in that whether
[1:21:25] it's your knees your hips your back.
[1:21:28] It's places where there's multiple
[1:21:31] things that come together. And those
[1:21:33] joints, all those parts, it's not just
[1:21:35] the joint that holds those bones
[1:21:37] together, but there's tendons, tendons,
[1:21:39] there's ligaments, there's there's even
[1:21:42] tissue that you know that connective
[1:21:44] tissue within our body that we can say,
[1:21:46] I want to get rid of all the fat. You
[1:21:48] can't.
[1:21:51] Some of you going to be blessed by this.
[1:21:53] You need a certain measure of fat. Yeah,
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; some of that connective tissue keeps
[1:21:59] vital organs in their place.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You see, some things that we're we can
[1:22:05] try so hard and we don't even think
[1:22:07] about. We're thinking about this bone or
[1:22:09] thinking about that, but that bone would
[1:22:12] not even and the muscle and everything,
[1:22:14] you know, it needs the muscles to move.
[1:22:16] The bone don't move on its own, but
[1:22:17] there has to be the connective tissues.
[1:22:20] And you know what says to my feet to
[1:22:22] move here and even how even walking
[1:22:25] downstairs or anything we've committed
[1:22:26] that many times to subconscious you know
[1:22:29] where all of that has originated the
[1:22:31] movements it's not my foot that's
[1:22:33] telling my brain to move it's the head
[1:22:35] that's giving the direction to the body
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; right and if something gets out of line
[1:22:42] maybe something kind of deadens that for
[1:22:44] a little bit I never forget the time
[1:22:46] that you know I think it was back in
[1:22:48] 2006 when I woke up on that um uh Sunday
[1:22:52] morning and I couldn't even sit. Uh
[1:22:54] there was such fire that was going right
[1:22:56] down my leg. I couldn't sit. I just
[1:22:58] walked back there. I couldn't even set
[1:23:00] in the in the car. I had to ride in the
[1:23:02] back here so I could preach and kneel.
[1:23:04] And then I got home. I couldn't even
[1:23:06] set. I couldn't set at all. Finally that
[1:23:08] night, I I I I just put my I pushed
[1:23:11] right here against my hip. And when I
[1:23:13] did, I was able to go eventually go to
[1:23:15] sleep. But when I woke up the next
[1:23:17] morning, I had a gate in this foot. The
[1:23:20] foot was just
[1:23:23] that was scary.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; I thought me, I was going to get on a
[1:23:27] road on on on the treadmill and I'm
[1:23:28] going to run it out.
[1:23:31] That was a sight to see.
[1:23:35] You see what happened when that way that
[1:23:38] way that took place. But you know what?
[1:23:41] What would happen? And obviously it did.
[1:23:43] Everything came back. the feeling within
[1:23:46] it. The doctor when I went to him, you
[1:23:48] know, I told him that that day when I
[1:23:49] went, it was fire going down my down my
[1:23:52] leg. I had to drive the doctor. Oh, I
[1:23:53] was just weeping cuz it was it was like
[1:23:55] fire. It felt like I was standing in
[1:23:57] fire going down my leg. And he said,
[1:24:00] Sam, he said, there's many different
[1:24:02] athletes that get that. He said, and
[1:24:04] different ones, he said, it'll come
[1:24:06] back. Now, I appreciate good doctors
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; and our ultimate trust is in the Lord.
[1:24:12] But what I'm trying to say is is that
[1:24:14] because something had taken place in
[1:24:17] there, which is from the sciotic nerve
[1:24:19] and all of that coming down there, it
[1:24:21] had affected the way that I was walking.
[1:24:24] But I had to get that back.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And sometimes the things that when we're
[1:24:30] looking at our life, we experience
[1:24:32] difficulties, we experience hurt, you
[1:24:34] experience disappointment, you
[1:24:36] experience things. That's what has come
[1:24:38] is to try to cut off and try to hinder.
[1:24:41] But listen, God has called you for a
[1:24:44] purpose.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And you can't lose sight of that
[1:24:47] purpose. And that purpose is to serve
[1:24:50] him.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's how you have to look beyond your
[1:24:54] disappointments. And when conditions are
[1:24:56] no longer the right kind of conditions
[1:24:58] or the feel-good conditions, we've got
[1:25:00] to look beyond that. And that takes the
[1:25:02] grace of God.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's true. Listen friends, there's
[1:25:06] nobody, you know, well, well, I know
[1:25:08] this person, they're a strong fortitude.
[1:25:10] It's got to be more than a strong
[1:25:12] fortitude of mind.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than that. So, this
[1:25:18] this this tissue that would connect the
[1:25:20] body together. And what we're dealing
[1:25:22] with is how the love of God is what
[1:25:25] brings the body together.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; it's the love of God. That's why why
[1:25:31] that allows it to be flexible, to be
[1:25:33] moved, to be moved upon, and for the
[1:25:36] Holy Spirit to move throughout the body.
[1:25:38] Let me just tell you something. If my
[1:25:40] hand or my foot decides that, you know
[1:25:43] what, I'm not going to do this. It's
[1:25:45] still a part of the body, it may decide,
[1:25:48] I'm not doing this. I don't want to do
[1:25:49] this. What it's doing is it's hindering
[1:25:52] the rest of the body.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; That's why everything has got to be
[1:25:57] checked. every motive, every attitude
[1:26:00] and it has to come back away from me and
[1:26:03] back on Christ and his body, his body,
[1:26:06] every decision, things that are done
[1:26:08] should be about the body of Christ.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; That's victory, friends. That's
[1:26:16] overcoming. We talk about the lion's
[1:26:18] den. How much how great that that's
[1:26:21] that's that is a a testimony for God's
[1:26:23] grace in our life. Surely our feelings,
[1:26:27] God, the power of God is able to put our
[1:26:30] feelings in subjection.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Should we have feelings? You should.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Without feelings, we would be a terrible
[1:26:38] people.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; It'd be terrible if we didn't have
[1:26:42] feelings. It'd be like different ones.
[1:26:45] Even I've talked to uh different ones
[1:26:48] that said, you know, they didn't have
[1:26:50] any taste. Still,
[1:26:53] Lord, I'm glad I got taste.
[1:26:56] I'm I'm just I'm not I'm just saying I'm
[1:26:58] really thankful. I'm glad I got taste.
[1:27:01] I'm glad I can taste my food. I'm glad I
[1:27:03] can taste my coffee.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; I mean, I I never never had lost that,
[1:27:07] but I I'm thankful to God for that.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Because when you lose some sort of a
[1:27:13] feeling, my that's a dangerous
[1:27:15] situation.
[1:27:17] But notice if it's the head itself that
[1:27:20] would absolutely control everything. I
[1:27:23] want to read this scripture here and
[1:27:25] then let me just try to tie some things
[1:27:27] together. The Bible says, "And above all
[1:27:30] these things, put on charity, which is
[1:27:34] the bond of perfectness,
[1:27:37] and above," in the amplified version,
[1:27:39] "And above all these, put on love and
[1:27:42] enfold yourselves with the bond of
[1:27:44] perfectness, which binds everything
[1:27:47] together completely in ideal harmony."
[1:27:52] You notice the scriptures even from last
[1:27:54] week and this week coming into this of
[1:27:57] where is coming down to it what joins us
[1:28:00] and unites us together is the love of
[1:28:03] God.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; It's the love of God that holds us holds
[1:28:09] us together. It's the love of God in our
[1:28:12] heart that that love of God when it's in
[1:28:14] our heart it cannot be overthrown.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Disappointed. Yes.
[1:28:21] discouraged, yes. Cast down, yes, but
[1:28:24] not forsaken.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Right? The love of God cannot be
[1:28:29] overthrown.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; It doesn't fail. Remember we preached on
[1:28:35] that charity never faileth.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; When charity, when the love of God is
[1:28:42] even the pursuit in our lives, no matter
[1:28:45] what rises, pursue, follow after
[1:28:48] charity. And I'll tell you
[1:28:53] had to deal with some things and you
[1:28:54] know other times and the person said you
[1:28:56] know I I called them don't worry they
[1:28:57] don't go here
[1:29:00] they didn't go here
[1:29:03] and I begin to just talk and you know
[1:29:05] just working with a person working with
[1:29:07] the individual and then you know I have
[1:29:09] a call you know that you know from
[1:29:11] somebody else and you know that kind of
[1:29:13] involved with something or what more and
[1:29:15] I just said you know and just trying to
[1:29:17] reach this and trying to reach reach out
[1:29:19] to for this and and and so forth. I
[1:29:21] don't want to get into any any
[1:29:22] specifics, but I remember as the
[1:29:24] individual said, "Well, I don't feel too
[1:29:25] loving right now." I appreciated him
[1:29:28] being honest with me.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; I don't feel too loving,
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; fellow brother in the Lord. But I knew I
[1:29:34] knew what it was is that the situation
[1:29:37] and what was present was like a gut
[1:29:39] punch.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And that gut punch that came up, they
[1:29:44] were simply being honest. They were not
[1:29:46] discrediting that the love of God was
[1:29:48] not needed. But what they were
[1:29:50] witnessing and before them and now
[1:29:52] having to deal with, they knew it was
[1:29:55] going to take a great supernatural work
[1:29:58] of the Holy Spirit from within their
[1:30:00] hearts. And let me just tell you
[1:30:01] something. I witnessed God do that
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; for the whole situation.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I witnessed God do that. to witness God
[1:30:12] move within such a supernatural way.
[1:30:15] That's why friends when we stand here
[1:30:17] that there's nothing that's beyond God
[1:30:19] if our hearts are willing.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; If our hearts are willing, I say, God,
[1:30:27] make our hearts willing.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; This is the bond. This is this is what
[1:30:34] holds everything together,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; not how many miracles we have.
[1:30:41] Not how much faith we have.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Charity,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; the love of God is what holds everything
[1:30:49] together.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Do we do we believe in miracles? We do.
[1:30:55] Do we need M? We need, you know, when
[1:30:57] you're standing in need. But this is
[1:30:59] what holds together.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:03] Now I want to just come into this on
[1:31:05] this scripture because it's putting on
[1:31:08] it's sinking into and certainly like a
[1:31:11] garment the love of God in our soul is
[1:31:15] more than where we can sink into the
[1:31:18] love of God. Lord I want more. Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; And the first place of starting that I
[1:31:24] want more is recognizing not only my
[1:31:27] need, but there's some things, Lord,
[1:31:29] that I'm seeing that's causing me to say
[1:31:32] I need more of you. Now, we're going to
[1:31:35] have feelings, but I don't want them
[1:31:36] feelings being preeminent.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Not excuses for them,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; not making place for them, but calling
[1:31:43] them out for where they are. And when we
[1:31:45] can come to that place, then it allows
[1:31:47] God to move in a greater way. Why?
[1:31:50] Because we're being honest.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; We're being honest because just to say,
[1:31:54] "Lord, I need more of you." Actually,
[1:31:57] it's we dying more to self and more of
[1:32:00] his love. Us sinking more into him.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. Brother Brandham takes
[1:32:10] this and I I'm just gonna just kind of
[1:32:12] jump to this point here.
[1:32:14] Brother Bram takes in in blasphemous
[1:32:17] names
[1:32:18] and he's dealing with brotherly kindness
[1:32:21] which is
[1:32:23] the the word and what God has given even
[1:32:27] to this hour.
[1:32:29] And when brother Bram comes into this,
[1:32:32] he's going through a dream that Sister
[1:32:35] Shepherd
[1:32:37] had a year prior.
[1:32:40] And in her dream,
[1:32:42] she was wondering whether she had the
[1:32:45] Holy Ghost.
[1:32:47] And in this dream, I remember a prophet
[1:32:50] receives it.
[1:32:53] In this dream, she saw a man standing
[1:32:57] here and you have this rock box.
[1:33:00] And the rock box, it's got, you know, a
[1:33:02] rock box, it's got holes in it. It's
[1:33:03] like almost like a crate.
[1:33:06] And here was a great man, the prophet
[1:33:07] interprets it, the messenger of the age,
[1:33:10] pouring into that rock box, the
[1:33:14] revelation
[1:33:15] of the hour.
[1:33:18] And through that rock box, the
[1:33:20] revelation, the Holy Spirit pouring down
[1:33:23] through there, that rock box could not
[1:33:26] hold that. And brother Brandham
[1:33:27] interprets that. He said, "That's why
[1:33:29] there's no such thing as a Holy Ghost
[1:33:31] church."
[1:33:34] He said inside of a church you can have
[1:33:36] you got people that are spiritfilled.
[1:33:38] You you have renegades and on and on. He
[1:33:40] goes all through the whole thing because
[1:33:41] what it is is the spirit of God is come
[1:33:44] to seal.
[1:33:47] Are you with me?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And so brother Brandon was talking about
[1:33:49] how that's poured down. He said she was
[1:33:51] wondering does she have the Holy Ghost?
[1:33:53] And he said these five streams of grace,
[1:33:55] five streams of water came down and it
[1:33:58] ran over her feet. Hallelujah.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; And he said what that is, he said, is
[1:34:01] that her faith that had started out to
[1:34:04] believe God, intellectual faith, but
[1:34:07] when the Holy Spirit hit that faith,
[1:34:10] it's a spiritual revelation upon this
[1:34:12] rock. I will build my church. I'll build
[1:34:17] my individuals.
[1:34:19] And brother Bam deals with that and and
[1:34:21] and and and places that there showing
[1:34:24] her where she's at as well as the Holy
[1:34:27] Spirit that's been coming down through.
[1:34:29] And the Holy Spirit, he's sealing he
[1:34:32] they're bringing new birth, new creation
[1:34:35] to his children.
[1:34:37] Everybody okay on that?
[1:34:39] But then in the dream, the same
[1:34:42] messenger, because this is where we're
[1:34:44] at, he has a bucket of honey and he
[1:34:47] pours in the honey. And when he pours in
[1:34:50] the honey, remember the water would not
[1:34:52] stick. The water just runs through and
[1:34:55] seals
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; those that are to be sealed. But the
[1:34:59] honey when it's poured in, remember what
[1:35:02] was said, this will stick.
[1:35:06] Right?
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Just stay with me a minute.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Stick in terms of what? Remember this is
[1:35:13] the age they without us cannot be made
[1:35:16] perfect.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; It's this in this hour the love of God,
[1:35:20] brotherly kindness being poured that
[1:35:22] will seal the whole entire church of the
[1:35:26] living God together.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; It makes it stick. The prophet said it's
[1:35:31] a seal that seals all the ages together
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; in this age. That's why they are without
[1:35:37] us cannot be made perfect. Now listen,
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; brother Brand then brings that now
[1:35:42] brings it into a practical measure where
[1:35:45] we see brotherly kindness in our own
[1:35:49] lives.
[1:35:50] And he says, "Now the honey represented
[1:35:52] brotherly love, brotherly kindness,
[1:35:54] which is this age." He said, "I just got
[1:35:56] through telling you of brotherly
[1:35:58] kindness, the age that we live in now."
[1:36:00] Now you might say, "Look, I sure don't
[1:36:03] like Brother Neville. I sure don't like
[1:36:05] brother Jones. I don't like brother so
[1:36:08] and so and something like that. But just
[1:36:10] let something happen to him, brother.
[1:36:12] Your heart is broke.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; It just nearly killed you. See, we can
[1:36:19] obtain brotherly kindness and feeling
[1:36:23] for one another.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Did you catch what he was saying here?
[1:36:28] Oh, I may not like this. I may not like
[1:36:30] that one. He didn't say not love them.
[1:36:34] This is not
[1:36:36] this is not footnotes to take and say,
[1:36:38] "You know what? This gives me the right
[1:36:41] for a grudge."
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Or, "You know what? This gives me the
[1:36:44] right to live on my own little island.
[1:36:49] This is not This is not what gives us
[1:36:51] the right to say, you know what? I don't
[1:36:53] like anybody here at this church.
[1:36:56] I'll go find another one." You find
[1:36:58] another one, you'll find out.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; You'll find out eventually. Give it time
[1:37:03] there and eventually it'll be the same
[1:37:05] way. And you begin to realize it's not
[1:37:07] people.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, there's all humanity that's here,
[1:37:10] but every one of us have a part in it.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to hold anybody
[1:37:16] here. I'm just trying to say that we all
[1:37:18] have the humanness which within it. And
[1:37:20] it's not everything that we in our own
[1:37:22] selves, we're walking around as the
[1:37:24] absolute. And everything I've done is
[1:37:25] perfect. And everywhere I go, it's just
[1:37:27] thus sayith the Lord. For every step I
[1:37:29] take and and the pillar of fire is
[1:37:31] always on me. and I'm eating donuts with
[1:37:33] the angels every morning. That's not
[1:37:34] true.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; It's not true.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't even talk like
[1:37:40] that.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Brother Brandham had
[1:37:43] to deal with things even in his own
[1:37:45] life.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I can take you through year after year
[1:37:49] after year after year where he would
[1:37:51] say, "I I am determined never to have
[1:37:53] another negative thought again." 1956.
[1:37:55] Come around to 1960 and he would say the
[1:37:58] same thing again. You know why? It was
[1:38:00] an ongoing work in his life because
[1:38:02] humanity all around challenged that
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; because one sure thing if we're walking
[1:38:10] with God as we say we're walking then
[1:38:12] we'll act like God
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; we'll live like God
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; and we won't be taking the he found in
[1:38:19] the temple those who sold merchandise
[1:38:21] going around and kicking this over and
[1:38:23] tipping this over and tipping that well
[1:38:25] I'm acting like Jesus.
[1:38:34] We can obtain brotherly kindness and
[1:38:36] feeling for one another. We can obtain
[1:38:39] that.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, I already have
[1:38:45] that. But there's more.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; There's more.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; What about for those that you don't like
[1:38:50] or your personality just doesn't
[1:38:52] dovetail with?
[1:38:55] Well, brother Samuel, I stay away from
[1:38:57] that. I'm going to read the rest of this
[1:38:58] quote in just a moment.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; If we've got to stay here till 10:30,
[1:39:05] I'm going to read the rest of this
[1:39:06] quote.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; This is not about putting us down. It's
[1:39:11] God wanting us to grow up into him in
[1:39:14] all things.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Amen.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; But to maintain in a group of people.
[1:39:20] Notice how brother Ram says that there
[1:39:22] he makes this statement to maintain it
[1:39:24] in a group of people. Why? Because in a
[1:39:27] group of people you have people that
[1:39:30] here have been sealed and you have
[1:39:32] others that are in journey
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; to be fully converted sealed.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Let's just let let me say this. Then
[1:39:41] you'll have others they'll never come to
[1:39:43] it whatsoever.
[1:39:46] Now listen, brother Bam tells us in
[1:39:48] every kind, every gathering, there's
[1:39:50] three kinds of believers.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Samuel, why do you preach as
[1:39:54] though everyone will? Because I don't
[1:39:57] know who is
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; and who's not. And that's what I love. I
[1:40:01] love to hold that for each one. Well,
[1:40:03] you might be holding wrong. I'm never
[1:40:05] holding wrong. I'm never holding wrong.
[1:40:07] I've never ever I never felt like, oh, I
[1:40:11] wasted time by trying to encourage this
[1:40:13] one. I have never wasted any time.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; So within all of that, here we stand.
[1:40:23] But wouldn't wouldn't it be incredible?
[1:40:24] Brother Ram says it. He says it like
[1:40:26] this in 1954 question Answers. He said,
[1:40:28] "If all the veil could be taken down,
[1:40:30] every one of us would be filled with the
[1:40:33] spirit of God. There'd be no arguments
[1:40:35] among us, no disagreements among us."
[1:40:37] Now, what is Brother saying? Is it that
[1:40:39] we're all all of a sudden always going
[1:40:41] to be able we're always going to see
[1:40:42] everything eye to eye? That's not what
[1:40:44] he's saying at all. But what he's saying
[1:40:46] is is that there would not be any
[1:40:48] lasting divisions.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; You see, we can sit right here, but we
[1:40:58] shouldn't sit here and have foxholes
[1:41:00] between us.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got my trench right here. We
[1:41:07] It shouldn't be that way. Brother
[1:41:08] Samuel, what do I do about it? Let me
[1:41:10] ask you, what did God do about it for
[1:41:12] your life?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; You and I were enemies unto him.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, the prophet says
[1:41:18] unlovable like the scriptures.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; We did not merit the love of God. Right.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; But if the love of God is in our heart,
[1:41:28] there is a strength, a hidden power in
[1:41:32] our life that unites us with one another
[1:41:36] even above every dislike, above every
[1:41:39] disagreement, above every fault, above
[1:41:41] every mistake, above all of that. It's
[1:41:43] the love of God because we know even in
[1:41:46] our own lives, we are standing in need
[1:41:49] of the mercy of Almighty God.
[1:41:53] But to maintain it in a group, that's
[1:41:55] this is the this is the challenge. Now,
[1:41:57] brother Rab says, "Why do you care for
[1:41:59] that brother?" Because you broke bread
[1:42:01] with him here at the altar as you will
[1:42:03] tonight. You fellowship with him. You
[1:42:05] shook his hands. You worship with him.
[1:42:07] He's your brother. And he might do
[1:42:09] something in the flesh that you would
[1:42:11] disagree with. Cause you just kind of
[1:42:14] stay, which you ought to do, but shun
[1:42:17] him a little bit.
[1:42:21] I may say, "Help me, Lord."
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; You know what would cause you to do
[1:42:27] that? To say, "Help me, Lord." The same
[1:42:29] as it would me because it's the head
[1:42:31] drawing upon our lives. He's wanting to
[1:42:34] draw us up more into himself.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; And you know where the first it all
[1:42:41] starts with is Lord, help me.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. See, God isn't
[1:42:45] condemning. It's here to grow. Now,
[1:42:47] others could say, "Ah, that isn't even
[1:42:48] needed. That isn't even necessary. Bless
[1:42:51] God. We're right in the midst of revival
[1:42:54] and faith and works and every But if
[1:42:56] there's no love,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; If it's division,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; sometimes division can be sown by
[1:43:05] statements
[1:43:07] that can be made to exclude
[1:43:14] our church.
[1:43:17] What we believe
[1:43:20] statements that can be said that
[1:43:22] actually divide.
[1:43:25] And what I find is is when this is where
[1:43:27] I look at many of these things. I look
[1:43:29] when I look for these things, friends,
[1:43:30] where I look at with studying the
[1:43:32] message, I look and I look at things and
[1:43:34] I think brother Brandham never even made
[1:43:36] statements that way.
[1:43:38] Are you hearing me?
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never made certain
[1:43:41] definitive statements that would
[1:43:42] actually cause brethren like that to
[1:43:44] just separate. As a matter of fact, it
[1:43:46] was quite the contrary. Brother Brandham
[1:43:47] never compromised in his doctrine, but
[1:43:49] brother Brandham would minister and
[1:43:51] preach the word to unify the people
[1:43:53] together. Why? Knowing that there were
[1:43:55] hearts within there that were ordained
[1:43:58] to eternal life,
[1:44:04] but in the bottom of your heart, if
[1:44:06] something happened to that brother, it
[1:44:07] would just nearly kill you or that
[1:44:09] sister. Brother Ram said, "I'm an old
[1:44:11] man. I was once young. Now I'm old. I've
[1:44:14] seen it down through the age. hear
[1:44:16] people say, "I won't have no more to do
[1:44:17] with him." And something happened to
[1:44:18] that man and nearly kills him. He
[1:44:20] thinks, "Oh, God, I let my precious
[1:44:22] brother go without making friends with
[1:44:25] him." See, it's brotherly love. It looks
[1:44:27] like it won't stick, but it does stick.
[1:44:31] The honey,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; it sticks.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; See, it don't look like it will stick. I
[1:44:37] sure don't like Brother Neville. I sure
[1:44:38] don't like Brother said we ought to do
[1:44:40] that.
[1:44:47] Well, always we're going to have our
[1:44:48] preferences.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I know you hear me say, you've heard me
[1:44:51] say this over and over as the Lord would
[1:44:53] bring this. We have our preferences. We
[1:44:56] have certain things.
[1:44:58] But this is where we can either choose
[1:45:01] to focus on what unites us together
[1:45:06] or focus on what divides us.
[1:45:14] I want you to listen to this.
[1:45:17] Brother Bram talks about this in, you
[1:45:20] know, everpresent water from the rock.
[1:45:22] Who says if you're really in love, you
[1:45:24] just can't wait till Sunday morning
[1:45:26] comes. You got to get down there with
[1:45:28] them. We get to leave. And the people of
[1:45:30] God, they don't bore you. They're
[1:45:33] brothers and sisters. As I used to say,
[1:45:35] you get as thick as sorghum molasses on
[1:45:36] a cold morning. It don't run. It just
[1:45:40] stays together, you know, clings tight.
[1:45:42] That's a rude expression, but it's
[1:45:44] trying to let you know what I mean. You
[1:45:46] stick together. And the colder it gets,
[1:45:49] the tighter they stick. And that's the
[1:45:52] way it ought to be with us.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Rather says, "What we love each other is
[1:45:58] not because that we're somebody, but
[1:46:01] it's the Christ in one another that we
[1:46:04] love." You see, it's the God that's in
[1:46:07] our beings that we love.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love to come together.
[1:46:14] I want you to think about this of just
[1:46:16] sticking together. Brother Bram will
[1:46:17] take this and I'm I'm closing. Brother
[1:46:19] Bam will take this on and he says, you
[1:46:21] know, he takes and talks about Moses and
[1:46:23] Zapora, a marriage. And he says here,
[1:46:28] Zapora had a little temper.
[1:46:31] Moses, he said, he had one, too. I mean,
[1:46:34] think about Moses.
[1:46:38] Moses writes of himself. Of course, it
[1:46:40] wasn't Moses thoughts. It was God's.
[1:46:42] Moses was the humblest man.
[1:46:46] It wouldn't be like you or I, you know,
[1:46:47] posting on Instagram, you know, your
[1:46:48] name and I'm the humblest person. Uh, it
[1:46:51] wasn't Moses thoughts about it. It was
[1:46:54] it was God. You know what the you know
[1:46:55] what the Bible humblest or meekst? You
[1:46:57] know what meekness means? Give place to.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; He gave place
[1:47:05] Brother Bram said, "How do you know?" He
[1:47:06] said, "That that
[1:47:08] little wife," he said, "that God gave
[1:47:10] you and that maybe that little temper or
[1:47:12] this or that." He said, "How do you
[1:47:13] know?" He said, "That ain't your cross
[1:47:15] to bear." And vice versa. He said, "But
[1:47:18] stick together."
[1:47:20] Now, you know how you stick together? He
[1:47:22] was talking about, you know, because
[1:47:23] this is this is a sticky part of us.
[1:47:25] That's not what he was talking about.
[1:47:26] Sticking like getting on one another's
[1:47:28] nerves,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; but he's talking about sticking
[1:47:31] together.
[1:47:33] What is it that would cause it to stick
[1:47:34] together? Well, if the if it's all about
[1:47:37] conditions, conditions change
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; with time,
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; right? Conditions change with time.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; I listen friends, I I' I've been I've
[1:47:47] been here long enough this past year.
[1:47:49] What was it this past year? 23 years
[1:47:51] that I've been pastoring here. I've been
[1:47:53] here long enough to where where where
[1:47:54] where people can come. This was the
[1:47:56] utopia. This is the this. Just give it
[1:47:59] time.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Give it time. It's not that we're bad
[1:48:02] people here. You understand what I'm
[1:48:03] saying? Just give it time. Once you get
[1:48:05] around things, oh, if the conditions are
[1:48:07] right, everything's just right. But
[1:48:09] remember, conditions are going to
[1:48:10] change. You know why? Because
[1:48:11] eventually, you're going to get to see
[1:48:13] humanity.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And the real reality is, you've got to
[1:48:17] think back. Listen to me now. You've got
[1:48:19] to think back. Did you make your choice
[1:48:22] based on humanity
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; or was it a revelation? That's how it is
[1:48:28] in marriage. Because if it's not a
[1:48:30] revelation, you let the conditions just
[1:48:32] fade. You let it just fade right out and
[1:48:35] finally we're just looking for anything
[1:48:37] to split and go our own ways.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; But if there's a real revelation in our
[1:48:41] heart,
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; then you know what? That's something
[1:48:44] that allows us to stick
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; through thick and thin.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I ain't put no bars on the
[1:48:50] doors. I ain't trying to keep people
[1:48:51] here. I'm trying to I'm trying to stay
[1:48:52] within the focus of Do you understand
[1:48:54] what I'm saying? that if we're not, we
[1:48:56] cannot be right with God and be wrong
[1:48:58] with one another.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; It can't be. We can't. Well, I'm growing
[1:49:02] so much. We can't we can't grow as we
[1:49:05] ought to grow in the stature of God if
[1:49:07] there's things that we're allowing to be
[1:49:10] between us.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And you know, let me just tell you what
[1:49:14] that is. It's just the enemy.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; And when I say just the enemy, you got a
[1:49:19] calling for what it is.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; That's my brother and that's my sister.
[1:49:23] Let me tell you something. Let me just
[1:49:24] tell you something. When the enemy tries
[1:49:26] to come my way and give me a give me a
[1:49:28] thought and you know you're able to
[1:49:29] tell, wait a minute, you're not going to
[1:49:31] run down my brother. You're not going to
[1:49:32] run to my sister. Say, "Brother Sam,
[1:49:33] what do you do?" I call their name out
[1:49:34] in prayer.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I do. I'd call their
[1:49:38] name out in prayer.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; My brother, I'll call my name, call
[1:49:40] their name out in prayer. You know why?
[1:49:42] If they, you know what? Thank you,
[1:49:43] devil. Because I almost forgot about
[1:49:44] brother so and so or sister so and so.
[1:49:47] Man, you're a big help today. Thank you.
[1:49:49] And you begin to pray in that way. But
[1:49:50] if you don't do that and you let it
[1:49:53] linger, oh, how it can build in your
[1:49:56] spirit
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; and instead of giving that glass of
[1:50:01] water so gentle to the person at the
[1:50:03] table here and they're like, "What did I
[1:50:05] do? What did I do?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Take these pills." You what? What did I
[1:50:11] do?
[1:50:12] It wasn't even anything about what they
[1:50:14] were doing. But what it is is that a
[1:50:16] thought had come in
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; and we entertained it. And that's why
[1:50:20] Paul said, "Let not sin therefore reign
[1:50:23] exercise kingly
[1:50:26] reside in your body lest you obey it.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Cast it out.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Cast it out.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand."
[1:50:48] Say, Lord, bind us together.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Bind us together.
[1:50:55] You know, we don't want to be,
[1:50:58] every church truly has a doctrine, but
[1:51:00] we don't want to be known by doctrine.
[1:51:05] our lives and what God has called us to
[1:51:07] believe. But what we want to be known by
[1:51:10] I think the greatest the greatest thing
[1:51:12] that we can have.
[1:51:15] Brother Brandham would you know even say
[1:51:17] it among the believers the church there
[1:51:20] in 63 in church order. He said now
[1:51:24] the church he said I appreciate the
[1:51:25] quality of the spirit that's here.
[1:51:28] He said, ' Now when I say quality of the
[1:51:30] spirit, he said it isn't that we've got
[1:51:32] more shoutings
[1:51:34] than everybody else. He said, ' Matter
[1:51:35] of fact, we got less. He said it ain't
[1:51:37] that we've got more gifts. He says,
[1:51:39] matter of fact, we got less.
[1:51:41] He said, but what it is, it's the
[1:51:42] quality
[1:51:44] of the spirit
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; that's among us.
[1:51:51] But Ram wasn't putting anything out on
[1:51:52] shouting. He wasn't putting anything out
[1:51:54] on all those other things. But it's the
[1:51:55] quality of the spirit.
[1:51:58] You know, the enemy, Satan's desire is
[1:52:01] to attack those things around us.
[1:52:04] Remember, as I said, it's not us. Oh, I
[1:52:08] know this one is and this one's not.
[1:52:10] This one's elect, this one's not. You
[1:52:11] don't know that.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, Brother Brandham
[1:52:14] was asked a question. Brother Brandham,
[1:52:16] I want to be able to come up on a person
[1:52:18] and know whether they've got the Holy
[1:52:19] Ghost. Brother Brandham says, "Stop."
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not going to know that.
[1:52:27] See, it's not about it. Let me just say
[1:52:30] it like this. Let me say it like this.
[1:52:33] Let me say this. What if you did know
[1:52:38] this person is not elect? What if God
[1:52:41] would allow you to even know that it
[1:52:44] shouldn't change
[1:52:46] our action
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; towards them in one degree?
[1:52:52] Jesus knew about Judas
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; the whole time.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't believe there's any Judas
[1:52:58] here. I preach and I stand upon this
[1:53:00] word. I believe each and every one to be
[1:53:03] going in the rapture.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; That's how I let that that's just how I
[1:53:06] preach it. That's how I look at it.
[1:53:08] Because let me tell you something, fruit
[1:53:09] can change in a split-second time.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Lives can change in just a moment's
[1:53:15] time. And sometimes lives can get in a
[1:53:17] place lives where you can say, "I wonder
[1:53:19] what's wrong with this person." Maybe
[1:53:21] they've come through a hard maybe they
[1:53:22] come through a a hard moment in their
[1:53:24] life.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe the fruit isn't just all of a
[1:53:26] sudden just turning out like it needed
[1:53:27] to be. It don't mean that they're not a
[1:53:29] real believer. They might just be going
[1:53:30] through a hard time,
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; a difficult time in their life. Maybe
[1:53:33] there's a time where there's a lot of
[1:53:35] sewing that's going on. They're watering
[1:53:37] it. All those things change. Seasons
[1:53:40] change so quickly.
[1:53:42] But may God help us in this hour.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, may the love of God be the theme
[1:53:48] of our lives.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; May it be the theme of our lives.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, you you could be wrong
[1:53:56] giving somebody the benefit of the
[1:53:57] doubt. I'd rather be wrong.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; I'd rather he right there.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; I'd rather heir
[1:54:04] because you know why? There's others
[1:54:08] that word, it's going to take an effect.
[1:54:10] That's
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; right. God's word will have its victory
[1:54:14] in our lives.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray.
[1:54:19] Heavenly Father,
[1:54:23] Lord, how we
[1:54:26] we just Lord, looking to you tonight,
[1:54:29] Lord, and my just Lord, as some of these
[1:54:33] places and parts, Lord, that you've
[1:54:35] taken us into just to remind us, stir up
[1:54:37] our pure mind by way of remembrance.
[1:54:40] Call us, Lord, and draw us, Lord, into a
[1:54:44] to more more of yourself, Lord. More of
[1:54:47] you. Help us, Lord, I pray, dear God, as
[1:54:52] Lord, even as we look across your word
[1:54:54] and we find our hearts challenged,
[1:54:59] every one of us, Lord, you've seen,
[1:55:01] Lord, our hands that was lifted and
[1:55:03] raised to say, "Help me, Lord."
[1:55:06] Father, we we have to battle, but that's
[1:55:08] overcoming. That's overcoming.
[1:55:13] But Lord Jesus,
[1:55:15] help each and every one of us that's
[1:55:17] here.
[1:55:19] May Lord, every one of our hearts be so
[1:55:21] full of the love of God.
[1:55:25] And Lord Jesus,
[1:55:28] help us
[1:55:30] that Lord, we will sink
[1:55:34] deeper
[1:55:36] into the love of God.
[1:55:39] That bond of perfectness,
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; that's what unites us together.
[1:55:46] It's not our personalities.
[1:55:50] Though, Lord, a lot of times we can
[1:55:52] gravitate
[1:55:54] toward certain personalities that we
[1:55:57] might be drawn to, and that's okay.
[1:56:05] But Lord,
[1:56:07] when it stops being okay
[1:56:10] is when that's where we stop.
[1:56:14] But Lord, as you've drawn us together as
[1:56:16] a body,
[1:56:20] we're different
[1:56:22] and you've done that by design.
[1:56:26] Every one of us, Lord, that's standing
[1:56:28] here, we have a part
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; in the economy of God. Help
[1:56:36] us, Lord. I pray,
[1:56:39] oh God. May we may we look to you no
[1:56:41] matter, Lord, what we would feel about
[1:56:44] it. May we look to you, Father.
[1:56:48] Cuz it's not been any man that puts us
[1:56:50] into this place. If it's not any man
[1:56:52] that put us into the body,
[1:56:55] it's you.
[1:56:57] And Lord God, help us.
[1:57:00] Help us to stand in our position.
[1:57:04] Oh God, I pray Father tonight,
[1:57:07] may the love of God,
[1:57:10] the great honey,
[1:57:12] Lord God, that would cause it to stick
[1:57:15] together,
[1:57:18] cause a a bride body that's been being
[1:57:21] built down through the ages
[1:57:24] to come together in rapturing grace.
[1:57:28] Lord God, in an age
[1:57:33] where hatred would come to such a place,
[1:57:37] yet the love of God, the person of Jesus
[1:57:41] Christ
[1:57:43] to be made manifest in your fullness
[1:57:46] in a bride body.
[1:57:49] Lord Jesus,
[1:57:52] we believe everything that you have for
[1:57:54] us.
[1:57:56] But Lord,
[1:57:59] within all of that,
[1:58:01] as you would heal us, miracles among us,
[1:58:05] Lord.
[1:58:08] Oh God, I pray father
[1:58:12] grant Lord that every one of our hearts
[1:58:14] Lord
[1:58:17] just to be Lord overtaken
[1:58:20] by the love of God.
[1:58:23] Lord to become more like you, more and
[1:58:27] less of ourselves, Lord,
[1:58:29] less of Samuel and more of God.
[1:58:34] Help us, Lord.
[1:58:39] Lord Jesus, if you wanted it,
[1:58:43] you could have put together a group of
[1:58:45] people where we would somehow have every
[1:58:48] single thing in common.
[1:58:53] But you didn't do it that way.
[1:58:56] I think about it, Lord, how that you put
[1:58:58] the body together.
[1:59:01] You put some, Lord, maybe they would
[1:59:03] they have vision. they can see things
[1:59:05] and what's to be done. Then you have
[1:59:08] others, Lord, that maybe might be a
[1:59:11] little bit more passive and you use
[1:59:14] each one of those parts.
[1:59:18] What if we all were exactly the same?
[1:59:22] What if we all were passive?
[1:59:25] Nothing would get accomplished.
[1:59:29] But what if Lord that every one of us
[1:59:33] were that a vision and having this this
[1:59:36] this way my once again we wouldn't get
[1:59:41] anything accomplished
[1:59:44] but Lord you have placed the body
[1:59:46] together by design
[1:59:48] you've gathered a group of people and
[1:59:51] Lord we need
[1:59:54] each other
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; we need the Christ in one another.
[2:00:02] Help us, Lord. Help every Lord, from
[2:00:05] every young person to middleage, older.
[2:00:08] Help us to be
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; what you would have us to be. You don't
[2:00:13] want us to be like nobody else. You want
[2:00:16] us to be yielded
[2:00:19] that you can be yourself through us.
[2:00:23] Lord, help us. Lord,
[2:00:26] forgive us, Lord, of our shortcomings. I
[2:00:28] pray forgive us Lord as the prophet
[2:00:32] would go through that in brotherly
[2:00:33] kindness Lord in the times where we may
[2:00:36] have pulled back and we shouldn't have
[2:00:40] forgive us Lord
[2:00:43] help us Lord to override our feelings
[2:00:46] help us Lord to not allow things to
[2:00:49] build
[2:00:50] but oh God help us Lord
[2:00:54] feelings are real that's true but God
[2:00:56] may we not make a monument or an idol
[2:00:59] out of feelings.
[2:01:02] But oh God, give us grace.
[2:01:05] Help us, Lord. Sometimes, Lord, things
[2:01:08] just do not disappear overnight. It
[2:01:10] isn't because we just say, "Well, I'm
[2:01:12] not going to feel this way, Lord. It's
[2:01:14] quite the contrary.
[2:01:17] It's where you lead us and we find
[2:01:20] ourselves in need. Lord God, I need
[2:01:23] more.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; I need more. Amen.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want that feeling.
[2:01:31] I don't want that to come around. Lord,
[2:01:32] I don't want that. And yet, we know that
[2:01:34] the birds will fly over, but Lord, we're
[2:01:36] standing there to say, "Nope. I'm not
[2:01:39] going to let you build a nest here."
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; But Lord, give me grace in this area of
[2:01:43] my life because to know there will
[2:01:46] always be things come around. But give
[2:01:50] me grace. I want to grow. I want to be
[2:01:52] more like you. Lord God,
[2:01:56] help me. Lord,
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; in our lives, Lord, all throughout this
[2:02:01] assembly, may the love of God abound
[2:02:04] more and more and more.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; May you bring, Lord, the increase in our
[2:02:10] lives, Lord Jesus. Help us, Lord. I
[2:02:13] pray. Help us,
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; oh God. want an hour, a capping hour, a
[2:02:19] capping time,
[2:02:22] Lord, for the headstone
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:26] of the divine love of God
[2:02:29] setting down to cap off
[2:02:33] a bride body, a people,
[2:02:38] Lord God, to raise from all the way down
[2:02:40] through the ages. Grant it, Lord. Help
[2:02:43] us, Lord.
[2:02:45] Help Lord God every father, every
[2:02:47] mother, every husband, every wife, every
[2:02:50] child. Lord, help every one of us as
[2:02:52] brothers and sisters. Help us Lord.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Help us in this hour.
[2:03:01] Oh God, if there's ever a time we need
[2:03:04] to stick together,
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; it's now.
[2:03:09] Help us, Father. I pray in Jesus
[2:03:12] precious name.
[2:03:15] Amen.
[2:03:19] Go ahead, Brother Brian.

[2:15:29] Amen. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. May he grant
[2:15:33] it. Amen. Just bow our heads and just
[2:15:36] wanted to make a quick correction. When
[2:15:37] I was praying earlier, I was praying for
[2:15:40] I thought it was for Brian Hannah Jr.
[2:15:42] That was for Brian Hannah Senior, I
[2:15:44] believe, for the prayer request there.
[2:15:45] So, let's just keep our brother in
[2:15:46] prayer for his for that surgery he was
[2:15:48] talking about. Let's just keep him in
[2:15:49] prayer and pray that God uhh bless
[2:15:52] sister Barb, give her strength to take
[2:15:53] care of him and may he recover quickly.
[2:15:55] So, let's just remember that prayer as
[2:15:57] we go. God bless you. Lord Jesus, we
[2:15:59] love you tonight, Lord. It's been
[2:16:00] wonderful to be in the house of God,
[2:16:01] Lord. How it thrills our souls, Lord
[2:16:03] Jesus. Even when you present to us,
[2:16:05] Lord, maybe something we haven't
[2:16:06] obtained to yet, Lord. How we love the
[2:16:09] promise of God, Lord, that you that
[2:16:11] we're going to be made more like you by
[2:16:13] every word that word on top of word,
[2:16:14] precept on precept, Lord. Every little
[2:16:16] bit that we hear, Lord, it's bringing us
[2:16:18] born into that image of Christ, Lord
[2:16:20] Jesus. I just pray that what we heard
[2:16:22] here tonight, Lord. I pray you'd add to
[2:16:24] add to us that virtue, that patience,
[2:16:25] that brotherly kindness, that love for
[2:16:27] one another, Lord God, we do truly love
[2:16:29] one another, Lord. And it just breaks
[2:16:31] our heart to hear that someone's sick or
[2:16:33] someone anything happens to anybody,
[2:16:34] Lord. I pray that we'd always have that,
[2:16:36] Lord, and you'd always keep us bound
[2:16:38] together with those cords that cannot be
[2:16:40] broken that we were singing about, Lord
[2:16:42] Jesus. Appreciate our pastor tonight,
[2:16:44] Lord. Thank you for the word that he he
[2:16:46] preached. Lord, I pray that you'd bless
[2:16:48] his body and give him rest, Lord.
[2:16:50] brothers and sisters that's got to go to
[2:16:51] work tomorrow and Lord give them good
[2:16:53] rest tonight those is retired and
