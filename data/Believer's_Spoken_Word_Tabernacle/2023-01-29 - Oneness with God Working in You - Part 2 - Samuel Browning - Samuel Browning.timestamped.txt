[42:50] be enriched by the Holy Spirit I I want
[42:53] to be the best
[42:55] that I can be for the Lord and you know
[42:58] there's sometimes there's things like
[42:59] I've said before that you know when they
[43:01] gave us when I I got my first vehicle
[43:04] that had an auto start on it I didn't
[43:06] know what the button was and I really

[43:10] the vehicle it had the low mileage and I
[43:12] was getting it for a good price you know
[43:13] because it wasn't one of those that

[43:17] I'm talking about the car that Benjamin
[43:18] has now and you know I'm I'm already up
[43:22] there to sign the deal and and so I just
[43:23] get to looking at the key fob where
[43:25] they're over there you know doing the
[43:26] stuff at what is this I've never seen a
[43:28] button like this it's got one of them
[43:29] three quarters of a circle what is that
[43:32] and uh so I know now that's almost
[43:35] standard equipment on car right
[43:37] so you know and I got to look at that
[43:40] button and I thought what is this so
[43:41] there was another gentleman just kind of
[43:43] looking out the window and I said sir I
[43:45] said can you what is this button right
[43:47] here
[43:48] now what if I had to walk down to that
[43:49] dealership because I really didn't it
[43:51] didn't matter it had auto start or not
[43:53] it was just a good deal the car was
[43:56] but when that man came over and he could
[43:58] speak and say hey this right here you
[44:01] know what that is I said no you know
[44:03] what he just didn't tell me he picked it
[44:05] up and he says watch
[44:07] deep
[44:09] oh my goodness this has auto start too
[44:12] now mind you I'm thinking about when I
[44:14] was still teaching I was thinking about
[44:15] getting that car oh man I can get that
[44:18] car positioned just right to where when
[44:20] I've got so much time in the classroom I
[44:21] can just step out there and go beep beep
[44:23] go copy some papers and then when I get
[44:25] in it'll be nice and warm and hopefully
[44:28] them seats turn on and you know I mean
[44:31] you know you start thinking about that
[44:32] but what was it it's what I already had
[44:36] and it's just making me more aware of it
[44:39] and I just say it like this and that's
[44:41] what listen that's what the Holy Spirit
[44:43] comes to do in our lives even even
[44:46] listen the preaching of the word even
[44:48] makes you and I aware of we could never
[44:51] even come to a place of a new birth
[44:52] outside of God stirring up and making to
[44:55] us know what the desire is he's placed
[44:58] within us and it lets us know this is
[45:00] your right this is your privilege as a
[45:02] Son of God and then after the New Birth
[45:04] has come what happens the Holy Spirit
[45:06] just continues to unfold to you and I
[45:08] our privileges
[45:11] and we've got a right and an authority
[45:13] to act upon them so I just want to
[45:16] encourage you because this is this event
[45:18] it's for it's for the entire church body
[45:21] and I know I mentioned to you and I said
[45:23] hey if you feel if you find you might be
[45:25] working on that day I I would just ask
[45:27] you with two months in advance
[45:30] um
[45:31] consider taking off for that
[45:34] and you might say oh brother Samuel what
[45:35] well let me say this
[45:37] when it gets to the end and anything
[45:40] that we get in God and receive from God
[45:42] it's worth more
[45:43] than any overtime yeah
[45:46] any amount of money
[45:48] and there's sometimes there's things
[45:49] that what happens is it's just a missing
[45:51] piece within there and I know sometimes
[45:53] we think
[45:54] um we can you know get in well I've
[45:56] Beyond this or beyond that but how many
[45:58] times how many of you can witness when
[45:59] you've read in the scriptures you're
[46:01] listening to the message and you'll hear
[46:03] certain things you're like wow I never
[46:05] heard it like that before and how many
[46:07] times you listen to that message how
[46:08] many times you read that scripture right
[46:10] I don't know about you I mean I've even
[46:12] I've come through that Weekly I come
[46:13] through as I'm listening I'm like wow
[46:15] it's almost like a I mean it can be a
[46:17] message that I've been listening to
[46:18] because a lot of times when I'm in a
[46:19] series I'm listening to certain messages
[46:21] and I'm just it's going on sometimes
[46:23] within a series of something I can
[46:24] listen to those messages I don't know
[46:25] how many times that God puts on my heart
[46:28] but you know what it's things that'll
[46:30] Stand Out whoa wow okay now the picture
[46:32] so I just want to say this
[46:35] to me
[46:37] the spirit of this age says I'm rich
[46:39] increase with Goods yeah I don't need no
[46:42] more
[46:43] I got it
[46:45] are you hearing me
[46:47] I got it but the spirit within us says
[46:50] Lord I just need more of you
[46:53] and even if my children are already at
[46:55] the point and raise and I'm in that
[46:57] transition of being independent but this
[46:58] right here because I am one of your
[47:00] children
[47:02] it can open up things for me of how that
[47:04] you're working with my life
[47:07] is that right brother brother uh Barry
[47:10] is also um
[47:12] I've I've been a part not of this exact
[47:14] uh um series but there's some different
[47:16] things where I have been a partner with
[47:18] him and brother Barry will go into a lot
[47:20] of things he'll bring certain parts in
[47:22] of the Jewish Family and really
[47:24] establish that in and setting that forth
[47:26] here in this and there's the reason I
[47:28] say about the sign up because we have to
[47:29] know with food and I have we have to
[47:32] know with copies because the things
[47:34] you're getting you'll be able to write
[47:35] on and it's not and once you understand
[47:37] it's an opportunity
[47:39] if you have a son or daughter and I'm
[47:41] saying this for our assembly if you have
[47:44] a son or daughter
[47:45] that maybe they're not serving the lord
[47:47] but if you can say hey
[47:49] would you like to come to this right
[47:50] here because it's not going to be if I
[47:52] can just say it in this way you
[47:53] understand it this is not going to be
[47:55] Hellfire and brimstone preaching
[47:58] this this is not what this is but it's
[48:00] an opportunity even that to witness
[48:02] because how can you speak the word of
[48:05] God without his nature being displayed
[48:08] so it's an opportunity also because you
[48:11] know look we I I want to help we want to
[48:14] help hearts and lives and and so it's a
[48:16] it's a wonderful opportunity as brother
[48:18] Barry and I were talking about that and
[48:20] I
[48:21] um and the reason I we need the RSVP
[48:23] because right now we've got over there
[48:25] in the fellowship hall in the
[48:26] Presbyterian Church we've got about the
[48:29] they let us know here the other day as
[48:30] seats of it'll seek 200. and I've got to
[48:33] let them know the arrangement that I
[48:35] want
[48:35] for that
[48:37] um and so you know I have to take into
[48:39] account what we have here about a
[48:42] hundred or so but I've already had
[48:44] because with in different individuals I
[48:46] had
[48:46] on my phone when as soon as I walked out
[48:48] of the pulpit last week I already had a
[48:50] text hey if you open that up
[48:52] if it gets open to others will you let
[48:54] me know first
[48:55] well I'll let you know you know and I
[48:57] and I will indeed let the the pastors
[48:59] know but I want to contain it here so
[49:02] I want to I want to do that and then
[49:04] I'll go through from there to the
[49:06] pastors and then they can move from that
[49:08] that point
[49:10] um but I already have then I had an
[49:11] email come in the other day I don't know
[49:13] that had been forwarded from the office
[49:14] where there was a sister who streams the
[49:16] services and said hey and when you when
[49:18] that gets opened up will you let us know
[49:21] and so and by the way that just to let
[49:23] you know that sister who emailed me I
[49:25] know her she's a grandma
[49:28] she said I'll be coming alone but I'm a
[49:30] grandma
[49:32] you know I said praise God
[49:35] so we want to do that and you say praise
[49:38] the Lord
[49:40] amen so I want to to me I want to really
[49:44] encourage each and every one of you
[49:47] um to be there the things that I have
[49:49] mentioned Brian will you give me or
[49:50] sister Brianna will you give me that
[49:52] slide of um
[49:55] the one who is it for I think is what I
[49:58] have listed on there
[50:01] I think it's uh yeah the next one
[50:05] the next one
[50:07] there we go
[50:09] when I asked for the burial where should
[50:11] I be with as far as in the ages and the
[50:13] reason we have this with any single 20
[50:15] years old enough is because generally
[50:18] any single the first the four children
[50:20] it's marriage
[50:22] right so that's that's the first realm
[50:24] of focus but with this part here when
[50:27] we're getting into about that that place
[50:28] brother Barry I brother Barry's the one
[50:30] that gave me those directions on that
[50:33] that age part
[50:34] um because then there's also
[50:36] expectations of what to even to look for
[50:39] in certain things remember choosing of a
[50:40] bride brother Brian says when a man is
[50:42] choosing his wife he's choosing what he
[50:45] wants his future home to be right and
[50:48] vice versa and even when a wife is is
[50:50] choosing a husband she's choosing her
[50:51] future home she wants someone who's
[50:53] going to be a leader
[50:54] not a dictator a leader
[50:57] right one one who leads where the
[50:59] presence of God can come into that home
[51:02] and so these are things that it's very
[51:04] be very good for that any single 20
[51:06] years old enough so
[51:08] uh and then the other part is
[51:10] self-explanatory couples and
[51:12] grandparents and I I just you know as
[51:14] I've admonished there with grandparents
[51:15] there's a lot of scriptures maybe God
[51:17] will just allow me just to preach on
[51:18] grandparents one day because
[51:21] um our my children still have
[51:22] grandparents and I certainly trust that
[51:25] every one of their grandparents are
[51:26] going to be there
[51:29] if they're not they're related to me and
[51:31] they're going to hear it
[51:33] you say why is that because I I want I
[51:36] want my boys even when they are not even
[51:38] in my home I want them to be able to sit
[51:40] down and talk with their grandparents
[51:41] about the things of God which they do
[51:43] I want them to be able to do that
[51:46] because it doesn't end when you we know
[51:48] in the scriptures
[51:50] how many knows as a as a parent that
[51:53] when they turn 13 or 12 and I might be
[51:56] stepping a little bit but it don't
[51:58] become autopilot that's where it's like
[51:59] oh man there's more engagement even now
[52:01] than it ever has been more engagement it
[52:03] turns 17 more engagement or 18 more
[52:05] engagement right it's continually
[52:07] continually engaged and those are those
[52:09] are such crucial years in there I'm not
[52:11] I'm not doing the presentation but you
[52:14] understand it's just something that
[52:15] because transition is important how many
[52:17] know that
[52:18] without the Lord Jesus raising there and
[52:21] when he raised the way he raised for our
[52:23] justification right leadership was
[52:25] important to move from one Feast to the
[52:27] next Feast so when he raised he gathered
[52:30] the disciples together to do what let
[52:33] them know this is the word that's been
[52:34] fulfilled now it's time to prepare for
[52:37] the Feast of Pentecost
[52:39] so it leadership is crucial in times of
[52:44] transition
[52:45] right it's very crucial for that and so
[52:49] how I thank God that he's not left us
[52:51] alone in this hour I love the last
[52:54] little statement in the message
[52:55] leadership in 65 the last message
[52:57] brother Branham is ministering there and
[52:59] he says uh he starts singing a song and
[53:02] he says and it's not just a song that
[53:04] he's making an announcement God be with
[53:06] you till we meet again
[53:10] and then the next service this communion
[53:12] I'm glad that Mighty Angel's still here
[53:14] leading us
[53:15] amen he's leading us he's directing us
[53:18] what is it God is seeing us through the
[53:20] transition of this Third Exodus from
[53:22] from the spiritual baptism of the Holy
[53:24] Ghost into that new body God is seeing
[53:27] us through and I'm grateful for that
[53:28] aren't you sometimes the transition
[53:30] times can be times of uh you know scary
[53:32] oh what's happened but I'm glad that
[53:34] he's here he's the stabilizer amen
[53:37] that's here among us so we just love him
[53:38] and I just um I I just with a joy in my
[53:42] heart and and we're going to have we're
[53:43] going to have a good time on that
[53:44] Saturday uh you know I'm not going to be
[53:47] wearing a tie thank God I'll be I'll be
[53:49] in my jeans and my friend on my boots
[53:52] and it's not going to be I want you to
[53:54] understand it's not going to be lecture
[53:56] but it's it's everything there's if
[53:58] there's questions and there's
[53:59] interaction and even some maybe you want
[54:01] on the side to write something down and
[54:03] have brother Barry to answer it
[54:04] questions and answers will be there as
[54:06] well so as things even come up it's just
[54:08] a it's just going to be a good time
[54:10] together and and we're there to grow
[54:12] together in Christ
[54:13] is that right that's what we're there
[54:15] for we're there to grow together in
[54:17] Christ and so uh that RSVP is by next

[58:28] I'm just going to read a few verses of
[58:30] scripture here this morning amen say God
[58:33] bless you thank you musicians and
[58:35] brother Brian
[58:40] just a few verses of scripture and then
[58:42] I'm going to just let you have your your
[58:44] seats verse 20 and we'll read through
[58:46] verse 23.
[58:54] neither pray I for these alone
[58:57] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[59:00] me
[59:02] through their word
[59:04] that they all may be one as thou father
[59:09] art in me and I indeed that they also
[59:13] may be one in us that the world
[59:16] May believe that thou has sent me
[59:20] and the glory which thou gave us me
[59:23] I have given them
[59:25] and what did that Glory do it unfolded
[59:28] who he was
[59:30] okay that they why is this Glory given
[59:33] that they may be one even as We Are One
[59:39] i in them
[59:41] thou in me that they may be made perfect
[59:46] that's complete in one
[59:49] right
[59:50] think about the example of we don't do
[59:53] it nowadays but remember uh brother
[59:55] Brandon will talk about that of the
[59:57] um Chinese Laundry ticket
[1:00:00] and win that ticket in order to get your
[1:00:02] clothes back to you you had to present
[1:00:04] your part that was given to you right
[1:00:06] and the one who cleans your clothes
[1:00:09] have the other part so when those two
[1:00:11] parts came back together you didn't get
[1:00:13] dirty clothes you had clean clothes
[1:00:16] so in that part within us that's been
[1:00:18] deposited comes together with him what
[1:00:20] does it release a Pure Life
[1:00:23] a born-again experience
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:27] oh praise be the name of the Lord I in
[1:00:29] them and thou in me that they may be
[1:00:31] made perfect in one that the world may
[1:00:34] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[1:00:36] them as thou as loved me
[1:00:40] amen God bless you bless the reading of
[1:00:41] the word as you're being seated I'd like
[1:00:44] to continue to speak on that thought on
[1:00:46] Oneness with God
[1:00:48] working in you and just to really try to
[1:00:52] move on what the holy spirit is putting
[1:00:54] on my heart so I'm just going to
[1:00:56] um
[1:00:56] just say it in this way Oneness Oneness
[1:00:59] itself is truly a work of God
[1:01:02] you can try we can try even in ourselves
[1:01:05] to try to get even family we can try to
[1:01:10] get church we can try to get people we
[1:01:11] can even try to get ourselves
[1:01:14] and Oneness with God but Oneness itself
[1:01:17] is a work of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:21] it's what God does
[1:01:24] through US individually and through us
[1:01:26] as a body of believers
[1:01:31] so it's not an achievement of man but I
[1:01:34] say it's the greatest privilege to be
[1:01:36] United with God
[1:01:38] man has tried to unite remember the the
[1:01:41] the Tower of Babel they they United but
[1:01:45] they United under a false head they
[1:01:48] United under a wrong purpose they were
[1:01:51] trying to escape judgment but they were
[1:01:53] doing it a different way than what God
[1:01:56] had provided
[1:01:57] and so when you see that there is a
[1:02:00] power in unity but the achievement of
[1:02:03] Oneness is not an achievement of man
[1:02:05] it's an achievement of God it's a
[1:02:07] supernatural working because even to
[1:02:09] bring all of us together and I'm not on
[1:02:11] this even close to being here yet but
[1:02:13] even in this part of it right here we we
[1:02:16] can take just two people in this room
[1:02:18] and we as far as in our makeup are
[1:02:22] different as night from day
[1:02:25] but what's important is we have the same
[1:02:27] Holy Spirit
[1:02:29] the same life within us and that's
[1:02:31] really the thought line where I'm going
[1:02:33] to be working behind here today because
[1:02:34] that's what the Oneness of the working
[1:02:36] of God in us brother Brown refers to it
[1:02:39] like this and I just appreciate sister
[1:02:40] Brianna running them slides but I'll let
[1:02:43] you know I thought I'd let her know when
[1:02:44] I want to actually read one with you but
[1:02:47] brother Brown would say this is exactly
[1:02:48] what take us to this is what Jesus
[1:02:50] prayed for and
[1:02:53] um I I believe that God not only has
[1:02:55] been but God is answering that prayer
[1:02:56] amen amen that we would be one he wanted
[1:02:59] he wanted us to be one like he and the
[1:03:02] father were one that the church we as
[1:03:04] members of the body of Christ would be
[1:03:06] one together just like he and the father
[1:03:08] are one that at that day we would know
[1:03:11] that he was in the Father the father in
[1:03:13] him and he and us that together we're
[1:03:16] one
[1:03:17] what a union a Oneness that would be to
[1:03:20] see God and not not yet what a union a
[1:03:23] Oneness that would be to see God in his
[1:03:26] church till every member is just
[1:03:29] perfectly in harmony with each other and
[1:03:33] God
[1:03:34] amen now you tell me that's got to be
[1:03:36] something besides man
[1:03:38] I mean that that that's going to take
[1:03:40] the supernatural working of God for us
[1:03:42] to be to be one with God and one with
[1:03:46] each other
[1:03:48] that can't be done any outside of of the
[1:03:51] working of the Oneness of God in us
[1:03:53] that's the church that Jesus is coming
[1:03:56] for and that's when his prayer will be
[1:03:59] answered that we will be one it's the
[1:04:01] only grounds of Fellowship that God has
[1:04:03] ever laid down for himself in his church
[1:04:05] is the Oneness of himself in the people
[1:04:10] so what's the grounds for Fellowship is
[1:04:12] the Oneness of himself in the people and
[1:04:15] the only way you can have those grounds
[1:04:17] is by a union to be United with him
[1:04:21] forever
[1:04:22] so United eternally with the Eternal God
[1:04:25] perfectly in harmony with him perfectly
[1:04:28] United together a church that all both
[1:04:31] God and his church is one United
[1:04:32] together I just want to pause here just
[1:04:35] for a moment and just make this
[1:04:36] declaration he's still working on me
[1:04:40] I said he's still working on me
[1:04:43] because once my soul and that's the
[1:04:45] greatest victory has been brought into
[1:04:47] harmony with God now it's through that
[1:04:50] seat of a power that it works to bring
[1:04:52] everything else in harmony with his will
[1:04:55] and I can say he's still working on me
[1:04:59] don't worry like we said on Thursday
[1:05:00] when God rolled up his sleeves he knew
[1:05:03] what he had cut out for him
[1:05:06] so I want you to think of this here and
[1:05:09] I'm just quoting out of the message
[1:05:10] Oneness to lay this ground if you
[1:05:12] haven't listened to the message Oneness
[1:05:13] in a while it'd be good because I'm just
[1:05:15] that's just where I'm be drawing your
[1:05:16] over services
[1:05:18] he says he says stay with his word that
[1:05:21] seems like that's a pretty simple
[1:05:22] statement stay with his word
[1:05:25] but here's here's the reality of staying
[1:05:28] with his word it's simply it's to
[1:05:30] believe what he said it's to say Amen to
[1:05:33] it even when it's cutting us even as God
[1:05:36] is speaking to us even if we're not
[1:05:38] where we need to be we're staying with
[1:05:40] the word because if I pull away from the
[1:05:42] word I'll never get the help that I need
[1:05:45] but if I'll just stay right there in his
[1:05:47] presence then the word will change me
[1:05:50] because what they don't do you'll say
[1:05:52] well I don't see any change right now
[1:05:54] but the first thing that's got to be
[1:05:55] broke down in our life is our will
[1:05:59] to recognize I need changed
[1:06:03] I need some work done I'm not just
[1:06:05] bringing something to God and say here
[1:06:07] God like we've been talking about on
[1:06:08] Thursday night here I got something
[1:06:09] that'll help you out no God said I know
[1:06:12] all about you but I don't need you to
[1:06:15] give me anything to fulfill my word all
[1:06:19] I need is for you to surrender
[1:06:24] and that's I tell you that that's a
[1:06:25] great that's a great challenge but God's
[1:06:27] up for it
[1:06:28] and I'm glad the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:06:30] moves in our hearts not to demand it but
[1:06:33] to woo us too praise God stay with his
[1:06:37] words I don't care I just this we could
[1:06:40] just stay here for a Month of Sundays
[1:06:41] stay with his word I don't care how you
[1:06:43] feel I don't care how many defeats I
[1:06:45] don't care how many failures stay with
[1:06:47] his word
[1:06:49] I don't see it in my life yet stay with
[1:06:51] his word
[1:06:53] because God's word can never fail
[1:07:01] if he's made me a promise I'm going to
[1:07:03] keep knocking until that promise is made
[1:07:06] manifest in my life
[1:07:08] because I'm not dealing with a man I'm
[1:07:10] not dealing with a church this is the
[1:07:13] Living God
[1:07:14] this is almighty God El Shady eye
[1:07:18] speak into my life
[1:07:20] stay with his word
[1:07:22] to separate from it is breaking your
[1:07:26] fellowship with God
[1:07:28] true God's Oneness by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:33] and he says if you say you've got the
[1:07:36] Holy Spirit and it it doesn't agree with
[1:07:39] the word
[1:07:40] then you're not Oneness with God and
[1:07:42] that's Romans 8 16 the spirit beareth
[1:07:46] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:07:48] children of God I want to read this
[1:07:51] sister Brandon's getting a workout today
[1:07:53] and me calling her name probably
[1:07:54] embarrassing I don't have to do
[1:07:56] something special for her
[1:07:59] this is God's Oneness
[1:08:01] I want to read this with you here how to
[1:08:03] Oneness this is God's Oneness when the
[1:08:06] spirit that you got agrees with his word
[1:08:10] and Manifest this word and make this
[1:08:13] word power to act the same way it did
[1:08:17] there
[1:08:18] let me just pause here that doesn't mean
[1:08:21] everybody's going to walk on the water
[1:08:24] it doesn't mean everybody is going to
[1:08:27] have the gift of healing or the gay it
[1:08:28] doesn't mean that because God has that
[1:08:30] through his body
[1:08:33] like sister shakarian so brother bam
[1:08:35] I've been praying fast and praying
[1:08:36] fasting praying fasting and I I'm just
[1:08:38] been praying that God will give me the
[1:08:39] gift of him he said sister
[1:08:42] your duty wasn't for that but it's for
[1:08:45] the praying and fasting God's got
[1:08:47] somebody else in the body
[1:08:49] for that
[1:08:51] right I mean I need my hands for eating
[1:08:54] not my feet but I need my feet for
[1:08:56] walking right in order for me to get
[1:08:59] that nice donut I got to use my feet to
[1:09:01] get there and then I can use my hands to
[1:09:03] put it in my mouth and you understand
[1:09:04] it's all working together in a Oneness
[1:09:08] for one purpose
[1:09:10] so let's say this together brother Brian
[1:09:12] goes into this next places this is a
[1:09:14] powerful statement he said let's say it
[1:09:15] together so I think let's say it
[1:09:16] together
[1:09:17] Oneness with God is to have God's spirit
[1:09:22] in you agreeing with the word all the
[1:09:26] word the whole word and to make it
[1:09:30] manifested in power
[1:09:33] that's Oneness and brother Brahm goes on
[1:09:36] to say this and he's talking about that
[1:09:38] Oneness with God if I can just jump to
[1:09:40] that third line in that he says when the
[1:09:43] power of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in
[1:09:48] you there's no disagreement the words
[1:09:51] there now I don't want to spend a lot of
[1:09:54] time on this but what brother Brahm is
[1:09:55] saying he's not saying brother kid you
[1:09:57] and I'll disagree that's not what he's
[1:09:59] saying because our our Oneness is not
[1:10:02] based on you and I agreeing and seeing
[1:10:05] every point exactly the same let me just
[1:10:07] say it if what I'm seeing and what
[1:10:09] you're seeing and we say well I know
[1:10:11] what I'm saying God has shown me this
[1:10:13] okay then you know what one of us is
[1:10:16] wrong but if we've got the spirit of
[1:10:18] Christ in us we're United with Christ
[1:10:20] who's the revealer of all things
[1:10:23] and because we're his children if I'm
[1:10:25] wrong I'm willing to say I'm going to
[1:10:27] agree with the word above everything
[1:10:29] above my own ideas about my own opinions
[1:10:31] because I'm United with him and you are
[1:10:33] a part of the body of Jesus Christ so
[1:10:37] it's not about me trying to say brother
[1:10:39] just Ray I want you to think like me I
[1:10:40] want you to see it like me
[1:10:43] we're not
[1:10:44] right
[1:10:46] no matter how Americanized you've become
[1:10:48] yeah that's a that's a joke he and I
[1:10:50] have on over and over right
[1:10:54] but you see it ain't going to happen you
[1:10:58] see so so there's no disagreement what
[1:10:59] brother talking about there's no
[1:11:01] disagreement with the word right that
[1:11:03] means that we are walking into light for
[1:11:05] all that's been unfolded and if there's
[1:11:08] something that I'm not seeing right I
[1:11:10] trust you have Grace to pray for me and
[1:11:11] say Lord the same Grace you've given me
[1:11:14] Lord would you just help brother Samuel
[1:11:18] amen I trust that way that's what I
[1:11:20] desire because it's going to take the
[1:11:22] grace of God working Among Us
[1:11:25] right so with that in mind if there's a
[1:11:28] disagreement it's not me disagreeing
[1:11:30] with the word because then when the
[1:11:31] words presented I can say Lord Jesus
[1:11:34] thank you Lord what is it our heart what
[1:11:37] is within our hearts isn't a man to the
[1:11:39] word of God
[1:11:42] oh my
[1:11:44] God so when the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:46] In Me Works in you there's no
[1:11:48] disagreement the words there it works oh
[1:11:51] amen it makes it what it is God made
[1:11:53] flesh in You by his word and the word
[1:11:56] made Power among you every word
[1:11:59] so in Romans 8 1 as we would look there
[1:12:04] because with the thought what makes us
[1:12:06] one with God and what makes us one with
[1:12:08] one another it comes down to the Holy
[1:12:11] Ghost
[1:12:12] the spirit of God
[1:12:14] right that's the I Unity is the
[1:12:17] indwelling of the holy spirit in each of
[1:12:19] Our Lives then we're a part in the body
[1:12:21] Romans 8 1 there is therefore now no
[1:12:25] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:12:28] Jesus because there's no condemnation in
[1:12:32] him
[1:12:33] you can't find one fault in him and when
[1:12:36] that same life is in you and you are in
[1:12:39] him there is no fault in you
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:46] that's why brother Brandon says when we
[1:12:48] pray he only hears our voice
[1:12:51] he doesn't see us he's looking at the
[1:12:54] blood
[1:12:55] right this is why brother bam will go on
[1:12:58] to say when he dedicates a baby in
[1:13:00] standing in the Gap and he says he's
[1:13:01] holding that baby he said to think of
[1:13:03] how innocent these little guys are he
[1:13:05] said but do you realize that when you
[1:13:07] have been born again of the spirit of
[1:13:09] God you are more innocent than they are
[1:13:14] that's what the new birth produces where
[1:13:17] there is no longer a record or a case
[1:13:20] against you because you're not the same
[1:13:23] person you don't have the same desires
[1:13:27] case dismissed
[1:13:30] and the authority of the token has
[1:13:33] brought it present
[1:13:38] who do what walk not after the flesh but
[1:13:43] after the spirit
[1:13:46] for the law of the spirit of Life In
[1:13:49] Christ hath made me free from the law of
[1:13:52] sin and death
[1:13:53] for what the law could not do and that
[1:13:55] it was weak through the flesh no and we
[1:13:58] understand that about the law he must do
[1:13:59] this and thou shalt not do that and thou
[1:14:01] listen the law was holy the law never
[1:14:04] ever became Unholy
[1:14:06] the work of the Holy Spirit was only
[1:14:09] coming to establish
[1:14:12] the law of God in the heart of man by
[1:14:15] God's Own nature because the law was
[1:14:17] God's nature being expressed
[1:14:22] right so that's why look that's why in
[1:14:25] looking uh Malachi 4 we we grow quickly
[1:14:29] to say behold I send unto you Elijah the
[1:14:31] prophet but a few verses up from there
[1:14:32] it says remember ye the law of Moses
[1:14:36] because remember Joshua did not have a
[1:14:40] new message Joshua's message was to take
[1:14:42] the people in to what had already been
[1:14:45] spoken
[1:14:47] and that's who the Joshua is Right among
[1:14:50] us he was unveiling himself in the
[1:14:52] ministry of Malachi 4 and that Saint
[1:14:55] Joshua is right here among the people of
[1:14:58] almighty God it's taking us into our
[1:15:00] inheritance into our homeland amen we
[1:15:04] don't need another message we just need
[1:15:06] the God of this message to make it live
[1:15:09] inside of us
[1:15:12] where is the god of Elijah
[1:15:17] for what the law could not do and that
[1:15:19] it was weak through the flesh God's
[1:15:21] sending his son his own son in the
[1:15:23] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:15:25] condemned sin in the flesh why that the
[1:15:30] righteousness of the law might be
[1:15:32] fulfilled in us who walked not after the
[1:15:36] flesh
[1:15:37] but after the spirit
[1:15:45] so there had to be a way that was made
[1:15:47] for you and I had to be a way made
[1:15:50] a way back into the holies of holies a
[1:15:52] way back into a place that the desire to
[1:15:56] serve God could come into an expression
[1:15:59] and in other words there had to come the
[1:16:02] way for a real true New Birth now think
[1:16:05] of it when Israel would be out of their
[1:16:07] inheritance when that Trumpet of the
[1:16:10] Jubilee would sound remember God said
[1:16:12] the land shall not be sold always God
[1:16:15] actually established in his word the
[1:16:17] land belongs to me now God has given it
[1:16:19] to you it's the land that belongs to
[1:16:21] your tribe and that land may have passed
[1:16:24] out of your possession
[1:16:26] but it never passed out of being yours
[1:16:29] it was always yours let me say something
[1:16:31] to you the Holy Ghost ain't something
[1:16:33] that you have to beg for it always
[1:16:36] belonged to you
[1:16:38] he made a way because that's the life
[1:16:40] God intended you to have
[1:16:43] right now it may have been away because
[1:16:45] of the fall and here we come through our
[1:16:46] birth but he made a way he came away
[1:16:51] what that we might obtain The
[1:16:53] Inheritance that's why brother man could
[1:16:55] tell us in the adoption series Jesus
[1:16:58] never left me an inheritance he made a
[1:17:01] way to bring me to my inheritance
[1:17:04] my inheritance was before the foundation
[1:17:06] of the world is that right so we
[1:17:09] understand that it makes a way for the
[1:17:11] true New Birth which is that Born Again
[1:17:13] experience so the only way that could
[1:17:16] come is God had to get himself a son
[1:17:18] again
[1:17:19] there was no man worthy right so God had
[1:17:22] to get himself a son well who was Worthy
[1:17:25] all the blood was was born right it was
[1:17:27] polluted right every bit of it I don't
[1:17:29] care you can pick the most righteous man
[1:17:31] that you would think that would be the
[1:17:32] most righteous in the Old Testament and
[1:17:34] still is not worthy
[1:17:36] worthy in order to redeem you and I but
[1:17:40] God had to get himself a son what does
[1:17:42] the son do a son packs the life the name
[1:17:45] the character of the father
[1:17:47] that's why Jesus said I am calm in my
[1:17:50] father's name it could not be a blood
[1:17:52] that was already here that was
[1:17:55] contaminated
[1:17:56] it had to be that had to be a blood cell
[1:17:59] created
[1:18:01] which was separate from man that was
[1:18:03] here because that blood it still had
[1:18:06] condemnation attached to it but there
[1:18:08] had to come a blood that was able to be
[1:18:11] shed to pay the price pay the ransom
[1:18:13] that the life of God in that blood cell
[1:18:16] could come to you and I and bring a new
[1:18:19] birth
[1:18:20] oh
[1:18:21] Galatians 6 14 God forbid that I should
[1:18:26] Glory
[1:18:27] save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
[1:18:31] Christ if I'm going to brag if I'm going
[1:18:33] to boast if I'm going to join it's going
[1:18:34] to be in the cross
[1:18:38] amen but I'm glowing in it because I am
[1:18:42] a participant in it are you hearing me
[1:18:44] now I'm not just coming and singing
[1:18:46] songs about his cross I'm coming to
[1:18:48] realization he made a way for me as Paul
[1:18:52] said by whom the world is crucified unto
[1:18:57] me and I unto it in other words because
[1:19:01] through that the world has become dead
[1:19:04] to me
[1:19:05] and I'm dead to it
[1:19:08] right try to bother a dead man
[1:19:12] can't do it
[1:19:13] right
[1:19:15] right for in Christ Jesus neither
[1:19:18] circumcision availeth anything nor
[1:19:21] uncircumcision so what are all these
[1:19:23] these are things that God gave the
[1:19:24] children of Israel as signs as tokens as
[1:19:29] witnesses that would be speaking of the
[1:19:31] coming of the Holy Spirit and Paul is
[1:19:33] establishing the type has now been
[1:19:37] fulfilled by the annotype
[1:19:40] you know what he's doing he's lifting a
[1:19:44] burden or a liberty that false Brethren
[1:19:48] came in and wanted to bring the church
[1:19:50] under an oppressive spirit that falls
[1:19:54] back unto what I can do salvation is not
[1:19:58] what you can do clear back from the Old
[1:20:02] Testament Jonah echoed from the belly of
[1:20:05] the well salvation is of the Lord
[1:20:11] it is of the Lord as David said that we
[1:20:15] have not been consumed
[1:20:17] for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[1:20:20] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:20:23] a new creature
[1:20:25] I love this
[1:20:26] another message to listen to that day on
[1:20:29] Calvary
[1:20:30] oh my goodness
[1:20:32] hmm Brother Brown said if the church can
[1:20:34] ever come to those fundamental facts
[1:20:36] that it's not something you try
[1:20:39] to do
[1:20:41] you work yourself up to do
[1:20:43] it's something that's born in you
[1:20:46] anybody ever put something on yours like
[1:20:48] this don't feel right
[1:20:51] right
[1:20:52] I mean I don't know about you when I
[1:20:54] maybe try on jackets I'm like hey
[1:20:56] don't feel right
[1:20:58] a lot of times if it don't feel right or
[1:21:00] you just asking what do you think about
[1:21:01] this
[1:21:02] um
[1:21:05] you know what she knows me it ain't just
[1:21:07] about her like wanting to dress me up
[1:21:08] like a Barbie doll
[1:21:10] but she knows me I made no sense in
[1:21:13] buying something I don't care if it's a
[1:21:14] dollar if you're not gonna wear it
[1:21:16] boy that's a separate subject isn't it
[1:21:22] God gives us Grace to learn don't he
[1:21:24] but it's not something we do it's not
[1:21:26] what you can do or I can do
[1:21:30] it's not something we work ourselves up
[1:21:32] into
[1:21:33] it's what we're born into so watch how
[1:21:35] Satan will come to try to uh uh do away
[1:21:39] with the Simplicity that's in Christ he
[1:21:42] tries to make it that it's something
[1:21:43] that you have to do well I've got to get
[1:21:46] myself into this right no the whole
[1:21:49] secret is is yielding to him
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:22:01] working in you that's real understanding
[1:22:05] it's like giving myself to him
[1:22:08] him
[1:22:09] the brand says we've got to recognize
[1:22:11] that fact recognize what Calvary did for
[1:22:14] you
[1:22:15] he says we can look at it and say oh yes
[1:22:17] that's fine but that ain't it
[1:22:19] if that son of God
[1:22:22] had to go to Calvary for crucifixion
[1:22:25] read this with me would you
[1:22:27] every son that comes must go to a
[1:22:31] country he must also have a Calvary you
[1:22:36] must have that day at Calvary
[1:22:39] well I thought I thought Calvary made a
[1:22:42] way for me it did Calvary made a way
[1:22:45] that you and I could have a Calvary
[1:22:49] well what do I need a Calvary for we had
[1:22:52] to die
[1:22:53] we have to die to ourselves
[1:22:55] that couldn't be done before Calvary
[1:22:59] the spirit of God would move on the
[1:23:01] prophets and here he would they would
[1:23:03] speak and give an utterance but it can
[1:23:04] never ever bring about the new birth in
[1:23:08] their life
[1:23:09] right
[1:23:11] so notice it says I've got to have that
[1:23:14] day of Calvary that settles the sin
[1:23:16] question Not Shake Hands with the
[1:23:18] preacher not be shook into the church
[1:23:20] not come in by letter not come in by
[1:23:22] profession but come in by birth he never
[1:23:26] gave a letter he never gave a profession
[1:23:28] he gave a birth and that's how we come
[1:23:30] in this is a powerful powerful point
[1:23:32] then from that from what the new Bears
[1:23:36] automatically we're living Christian
[1:23:38] lives
[1:23:40] see it's not when brother Bama says it
[1:23:43] automatically it's not something I'm
[1:23:44] trying to generate
[1:23:47] but it's what I'm yielding to what's
[1:23:49] there
[1:23:52] okay I'm yielding to what's there
[1:23:55] there's a new owner in the house
[1:23:58] not two heads in the house there's a new
[1:24:00] owner
[1:24:02] well we used to do things this way key
[1:24:04] phrase used to
[1:24:07] right right just like on the job
[1:24:09] sometimes it's a blessing you get a new
[1:24:10] boss
[1:24:12] maybe other times is not
[1:24:14] right
[1:24:16] right but then when they come in they've
[1:24:18] got a a culture a vision a mission and
[1:24:21] what they want to see done is that right
[1:24:25] true just like somebody moves in next
[1:24:27] door to you or in the neighborhood
[1:24:28] you're like
[1:24:30] what in the world why in the world are
[1:24:32] they painting that color for what in the
[1:24:34] world are they
[1:24:36] what are they well why was it was it the
[1:24:38] house
[1:24:39] what made the difference
[1:24:41] say it again
[1:24:42] the people
[1:24:43] new people are in there right
[1:24:46] that's what affects what's on the
[1:24:48] outside is what's on the inside
[1:24:53] then from that automatically we're
[1:24:56] living Christian Life and it doesn't
[1:24:57] mean and you see this maybe here a
[1:24:59] little bit it doesn't mean like then
[1:25:01] we're walking around like this you know
[1:25:02] if there is a we are in cooperation
[1:25:07] with the Holy Spirit
[1:25:09] there's a son a daughter of God on the
[1:25:11] inside that says
[1:25:13] be it unto me Lord
[1:25:15] yes Lord
[1:25:16] you said it I believe
[1:25:20] you said it it is done
[1:25:24] Hallelujah
[1:25:28] because through that I love this
[1:25:30] statement here this is like one of those
[1:25:32] you could just put on the put on the
[1:25:33] refrigerator because we visited quite a
[1:25:35] bit we'd see it
[1:25:37] have your day at Calvary
[1:25:39] God will have his way with you
[1:25:42] it's powerful isn't it
[1:25:44] this is like this is like one of them
[1:25:46] cans of juice concentrate you open it up
[1:25:48] pie it just keeps going you know have
[1:25:50] your day at Calvary and God will have
[1:25:53] his way with you well what happens at
[1:25:55] Calvary we die to ourselves
[1:25:58] you know it's tremendous is that dying
[1:26:01] never stops
[1:26:04] we die
[1:26:06] daily
[1:26:08] amen Romans 8 10 if Christ be in you the
[1:26:12] body is dead because of sin now I want
[1:26:15] you to I'm going to read some scriptures
[1:26:16] and I want you to hone in on this part
[1:26:18] when Paul is writing about the body okay
[1:26:21] the body is dead because of sin if
[1:26:25] Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:26:27] because of sin and the spirit is life
[1:26:31] because of righteousness but if the
[1:26:34] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:26:37] the dead dwell in you
[1:26:40] now I know Paul could have wrote on you
[1:26:42] but that that wouldn't be that wouldn't
[1:26:43] be good enough
[1:26:45] because it could be on us
[1:26:47] and it still has not come to the right
[1:26:49] place
[1:26:51] it could even be in US
[1:26:53] and still not be to the right place it's
[1:26:55] got to be in us and that us he's talking
[1:26:58] about is not my flesh it's not my human
[1:27:02] spirit
[1:27:03] it's that part that come from God
[1:27:08] that's the real you
[1:27:10] that's the real me
[1:27:13] are you with me this is what the Holy
[1:27:16] Spirit has come to influence and draw to
[1:27:19] a living reality is the real you
[1:27:22] because once that's once that right
[1:27:25] there that Victory on the inside that
[1:27:27] then the rest of it it'll be from
[1:27:29] Victory after Victory after Victory
[1:27:32] after Victory right what was going into
[1:27:36] the Promised Land
[1:27:37] I mean did they just go into the
[1:27:39] promised land and praise God this is
[1:27:40] Resort City
[1:27:42] hey I'll take another lemonade give me
[1:27:44] another you know sudden Joy you know
[1:27:46] diet lemonade unsweet tea give me
[1:27:48] another one like that hey I'll take
[1:27:49] another I'll take another Chick-fil-A
[1:27:51] I'll take no
[1:27:53] when they got into the promised land it
[1:27:56] was a battle
[1:27:59] it wasn't a picnic it was a battle
[1:28:02] media something when the love of God has
[1:28:04] come into your heart you don't have to
[1:28:06] fight for the love of God but you've got
[1:28:08] a fight to stay in Victory day after day
[1:28:10] after day after day you've got a fight
[1:28:13] to pray Factory you've got to fight
[1:28:15] against the pressures to take what
[1:28:18] belongs to you
[1:28:20] but here's the good news you got the
[1:28:21] soldier on the inside
[1:28:23] how am I going to win this battle how am
[1:28:26] I going to win this battle and then all
[1:28:27] of a sudden you're there in prayer
[1:28:28] submitting yourself and he shows up and
[1:28:30] you say wait a minute what is this right
[1:28:32] here he says as captain of the Lord's
[1:28:34] host am I now come
[1:28:37] glory be to God I'm here to Lead You In
[1:28:40] victory over your complexes I'm here to
[1:28:43] lead you in Victory through your life
[1:28:45] your makeup other things all the hurts
[1:28:48] and everything that is wanted to
[1:28:49] encroach upon your land I am here to
[1:28:53] lead you in Victory
[1:28:56] [Applause]
[1:28:59] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:29:01] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:29:04] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:29:07] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:29:11] spirit that dwell in you so it shall
[1:29:14] make him alive make it alive to what
[1:29:17] the word that's on the inside
[1:29:19] because this guy right here is no more
[1:29:22] saved than he was
[1:29:24] I'm 20 some years ago he's no more saved
[1:29:27] but this guy on the inside this is who
[1:29:29] came this is what he came for and this
[1:29:31] guy on the inside is there to bring this
[1:29:33] guy in subjection so the quickening is
[1:29:36] the quickening power coming in to God's
[1:29:39] provided place in our life that he has
[1:29:41] reserved for himself
[1:29:44] are you with me then through that
[1:29:46] quickening that of living presence of
[1:29:48] God it then Works to bring every bit of
[1:29:51] our mortal body in subjection
[1:29:56] how many knows that's battle after
[1:29:58] battle
[1:30:00] and it isn't that we don't want to bring
[1:30:01] it in subjection but there's times it's
[1:30:03] wrestling it out it's submitting over to
[1:30:05] the Samuel I need Scripture I'm glad
[1:30:08] I'll give it even though it's not here
[1:30:10] Hebrews 5 7. how many knows what the
[1:30:13] requirement was of the Lord Jesus to go
[1:30:14] to Calvary right
[1:30:16] he was heard in that he feared
[1:30:18] he cried with strong crying and tears is
[1:30:22] that right he learned what
[1:30:24] obedience by the things he suffered
[1:30:27] obedience is not something cheap of you
[1:30:29] and I saying yeah I believe that no
[1:30:31] obedience is where we submit to it and
[1:30:34] we may not even see it out here right
[1:30:36] away but it's right here you have obeyed
[1:30:39] the doctrine of the word from your heart
[1:30:44] that's where it's at right here obeying
[1:30:46] it from my heart giving our heart in
[1:30:48] submission to God and the body will
[1:30:51] follow the heart not my not my heart
[1:30:53] following my body
[1:30:55] no
[1:30:59] Colossians 2. everybody all right
[1:31:02] Colossians 2 9 4 in him dwelleth all the
[1:31:07] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:31:09] so to thank how God himself came down in
[1:31:11] Redemption it was not a separate person
[1:31:13] it was not a lesser person it was God
[1:31:15] calmed and sending down to come and to
[1:31:18] redeem you and I
[1:31:20] and in him throughout the fullness of
[1:31:22] the godhead bodily but it's just like
[1:31:24] when you look at a development and you
[1:31:26] think of a Housing Development or
[1:31:28] whatever more within that development
[1:31:30] one will make a purchase in that
[1:31:31] development and then they will actually
[1:31:33] partition or they will section the
[1:31:35] different plots of lands to try to set
[1:31:37] up and develop it with all the roadways
[1:31:40] and everything electric coming through
[1:31:41] Plumbing all that other stuff and they
[1:31:43] will set it up in that way and what God
[1:31:45] did after Calvary he ascended back on
[1:31:49] high and got sent back the Holy Spirit
[1:31:51] and the Holy Spirit coming in among the
[1:31:54] vessels that had prepared themselves by
[1:31:57] the word god
[1:31:59] subdivided himself into his church
[1:32:04] so if he subdivided himself in his
[1:32:06] church then you have part of him
[1:32:09] I have part of him you have part of him
[1:32:11] it's like a great big puzzle once you
[1:32:13] get all the pieces together and this
[1:32:15] piece saying I want to be that peace I'm
[1:32:17] going to be in the center because my
[1:32:19] peace just looks the best and nobody's a
[1:32:21] more perfect message believer than me I
[1:32:23] mean you know I'm oh oh oh that ain't
[1:32:26] one that's working there
[1:32:27] that's called know it all in this if
[1:32:29] that's such a phrase right so I don't
[1:32:32] care if I'm just to be the corner piece
[1:32:34] I don't care if I'm just the guy that's
[1:32:36] got the little C with the circle on it
[1:32:38] that says copyrighted but oh God let my
[1:32:41] life be an expression that God is right
[1:32:44] here living in my life in your life no
[1:32:46] matter what piece of the puzzle I have
[1:32:48] I'm just glad to be part of the picture
[1:32:51] of Jesus Christ in this hour
[1:32:57] verse 10 and ye are complete in him
[1:33:03] well let's say I don't see everything
[1:33:05] yet in my life but wait a minute when
[1:33:07] the New Birth has come you are complete
[1:33:09] in him
[1:33:11] it's the outworking of that Perfection
[1:33:13] think of the crossing of Jordan let that
[1:33:15] just stick with you as we continue to
[1:33:17] talk about this in Services which is the
[1:33:19] head of all principality and power is
[1:33:22] anybody greater than him
[1:33:24] no no he's seated in power in our life
[1:33:27] there was a stronger one who was there
[1:33:30] but it was stronger than him
[1:33:32] right but a stronger one came that was
[1:33:35] stronger than he the angel of the Lord
[1:33:37] was stronger than that Spirit than that
[1:33:39] nature that was there
[1:33:41] amen
[1:33:43] and there was a stronger one that came
[1:33:44] and spoiled the house pulled his good
[1:33:46] and sat down and said now this is my
[1:33:49] house
[1:33:51] you were just a squatter
[1:33:53] I've come to claim what belongs to me
[1:33:56] and I've not only got the title D but I
[1:33:58] am the abstract of the title deed glory
[1:34:02] be to God verse 11 in whom also ye are
[1:34:05] circumcised with the circumcision made
[1:34:08] without hands now circumcision as we
[1:34:10] said before type from the Old Testament
[1:34:12] a type of what of the Holy Ghost what
[1:34:15] does circumcision do in the Old
[1:34:16] Testament it was God letting Abraham
[1:34:18] know I have accepted your faith Abraham
[1:34:21] had Faith but the circumcision was a
[1:34:24] seal of his faith Romans 4 right it was
[1:34:27] a seal of his faith what he was saying
[1:34:29] is that any time that there is something
[1:34:32] arises something comes up there will be
[1:34:34] a seal in your flesh something that you
[1:34:37] can look at when doubt arises when
[1:34:40] things comes against you you're going to
[1:34:42] have a seal that will settle doubts a
[1:34:45] seal that'll settle questions a seal
[1:34:48] that will give you strength to bring
[1:34:49] your life subject to the word that I
[1:34:52] don't know how but I know I've passed
[1:34:54] from Death unto life I know I pack
[1:34:56] within me the token the Seal of the
[1:34:59] Living God there is no doubt in him him
[1:35:03] and because of that
[1:35:05] then it'll overcome any doubt that comes
[1:35:08] in here
[1:35:09] because perfect love does what
[1:35:11] cast out all fear fears can come but
[1:35:14] perfect love said sorry there ain't no
[1:35:16] room for you
[1:35:18] there's no room in the Inn
[1:35:24] um
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:26] notice what did it do they didn't do
[1:35:27] what did the circumcision do it's
[1:35:29] putting off the body once again keeping
[1:35:32] in mind that the body of the sins of the
[1:35:35] flesh by the circumcision of Christ now
[1:35:38] think about putting off the body of the
[1:35:40] sins of this flesh so Paul is talking
[1:35:42] about something more than just this
[1:35:44] right here because right here you still
[1:35:46] see this it's still living and breathing
[1:35:48] and so Paul is speaking of something by
[1:35:50] the spirit of God that's more than this
[1:35:52] right here the body of the sins of this
[1:35:55] flesh Paul is expressing it's the nature
[1:35:58] that God came to change
[1:36:03] is that right
[1:36:06] and by a circumcision well circumcision
[1:36:08] ain't Pleasant circumcision isn't easy
[1:36:10] circumcision is a process circumcision
[1:36:12] isn't signing our names on the book or
[1:36:14] even making a declaration with you I
[1:36:16] believe I believe a message no
[1:36:17] circumcision is where now what we have
[1:36:21] believed and said I believe it's for me
[1:36:23] God has some sharp knives a word think
[1:36:26] about it in this age that you and I are
[1:36:28] living in you know the Bible pulls it up
[1:36:29] then in the days of Saul in the days of
[1:36:31] Saul they couldn't even find a person
[1:36:33] who was a blacksmith within the time the
[1:36:36] time of Israel you know why so they had
[1:36:38] nobody to make weapons nobody to sharpen
[1:36:40] the word but when David came back on the
[1:36:42] throne there now came one who was able
[1:36:45] to sharpen knives there came now an
[1:36:47] entrance oh glory be to God there came
[1:36:50] an inference by the seventh seal the
[1:36:53] quickening power of God that could
[1:36:55] sharpen this word and cut a bride away
[1:36:58] from denominationalism that can cut a
[1:37:01] bride away from herself it could cut her
[1:37:03] away from her past and cut her right in
[1:37:06] to Jesus Christ
[1:37:08] I wish I feel like running right now
[1:37:11] I want to be to God
[1:37:13] you're going to not be that emotional
[1:37:15] shame on you did I tell you what every
[1:37:16] one of us enjoys something
[1:37:20] you may not act like me but that's all
[1:37:22] right I ain't going to be christianize
[1:37:24] you but let me tell you something I just
[1:37:26] don't get happy in here and dance I
[1:37:27] dance at home I dance in the yard I'll
[1:37:30] dance sometimes I gotta get out of the
[1:37:31] car oh brother Samuel that's just silly
[1:37:33] if you knew what I knew
[1:37:36] now maybe you won't act like that and
[1:37:38] that's okay that don't mean you're not a
[1:37:40] Believer it don't mean it don't mean as
[1:37:41] much to you but see back and forth well
[1:37:43] we're not even there today are we that's
[1:37:45] Oneness of God working in the body
[1:37:49] oh man
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:53] verse 12.
[1:37:56] buried with him in baptism Now watch how
[1:37:59] Paul is bringing this how does this come
[1:38:01] about what's this process buried with
[1:38:03] him in baptism so when down in here as
[1:38:07] one comes up they are they repent
[1:38:10] from within their heart there's an
[1:38:12] abhorrance an abhorrence of a life of
[1:38:15] sin I do no longer want to serve the way
[1:38:18] of sin I want to serve God Lord forgive
[1:38:20] me of my sins I want to serve you Lord
[1:38:25] then what's the next step that's in
[1:38:27] conjunction with repentance be baptized
[1:38:30] in the name of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:38:32] Paul is saying buried with him in
[1:38:34] baptism this is a sign of a grave
[1:38:39] right
[1:38:42] but here's the other part wherein also
[1:38:44] ye are risen with him through the faith
[1:38:47] of the operation of God
[1:38:49] who hath raised him from the dead so as
[1:38:53] we are laid down in there in the watery
[1:38:55] grave it is not me or somebody else
[1:38:57] whoever baptize you or baptize somebody
[1:38:59] else it's not that person that's
[1:39:02] actually raising you into Christ but
[1:39:04] that raising up is a symbol just as you
[1:39:07] have walked in to be identified with
[1:39:09] this name you say what do you mean that
[1:39:11] when God has touched your heart and
[1:39:12] you've repented of your sins then there
[1:39:14] comes a testimony that will rise up and
[1:39:16] say I am a Christian God has saved me
[1:39:20] and brother babe said you keep on
[1:39:21] confessing that and you watch it work
[1:39:23] righteousness in your life
[1:39:26] that's why we don't be baptized if we
[1:39:28] don't mean business with God we're
[1:39:30] reason we're baptized is because Lord I
[1:39:32] want to serve you
[1:39:34] right it's him that's dealing with the
[1:39:37] heart it's him that's breaking down our
[1:39:39] will it's him that's drawing us to him
[1:39:41] and then he by the spirit of God raises
[1:39:45] Us by an operation of Faith where God
[1:39:47] comes down and operates on our faith by
[1:39:51] his presence so as we've been buried
[1:39:52] with him then we are raised with him so
[1:39:56] Romans 6 5 for if we have been planted
[1:39:58] together once again in the likeness of
[1:40:01] his death
[1:40:02] we shall also be in the likeness of the
[1:40:06] Resurrection
[1:40:08] so this is here where we're taking on
[1:40:10] that identification notice verse six
[1:40:12] here I want you to watch this again
[1:40:13] knowing this that our old man
[1:40:18] is crucified
[1:40:20] that's the only time I think that it's
[1:40:22] fitting to call somebody old man
[1:40:26] I don't think it's fitting to call Daddy
[1:40:27] old man I I just really don't think it's
[1:40:29] fitting to do that you that's your
[1:40:30] personal opinion sure I'm not preaching
[1:40:32] it as Doctrine but I'm just looking at
[1:40:33] respect but this right here this is a
[1:40:35] place where you can call the old man and
[1:40:37] say you know what it's the old man that
[1:40:39] lived here why he's not that he's old in
[1:40:41] years it's that he's old he's done away
[1:40:43] with
[1:40:44] that the guy who used to live here no
[1:40:47] here no air anymore
[1:40:50] Hallelujah that our old man is crucified
[1:40:53] with him what does it mean to be
[1:40:54] crucified dead
[1:40:57] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:41:01] once again the body of sin might be
[1:41:04] destroyed what's he talking about the
[1:41:06] nature
[1:41:07] that we're henceforth we should not
[1:41:09] serve sin for he that is dead is freed
[1:41:14] from sin
[1:41:15] he
[1:41:17] Made A Way
[1:41:21] isn't that right
[1:41:22] he made a way
[1:41:24] the body of sin keep that in mind how
[1:41:26] Paul's working with that here because
[1:41:28] when you look at this out of souls in
[1:41:30] prison this is one of the many places
[1:41:31] but I love how the prophet States it
[1:41:33] here he said the soul of man is not the
[1:41:35] body of man it's the soul and that soul
[1:41:38] is something that that's the nature of
[1:41:40] the spirit and he says now we are dead
[1:41:43] quotes of scripture out of her Paul the
[1:41:45] scripture pulling tells us we are dead
[1:41:47] and our lives are HID in God through
[1:41:50] Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit
[1:41:53] now it wasn't that your body died
[1:41:58] right right how many can say that's born
[1:41:59] again it wasn't my body that died
[1:42:02] and when my body that died it wasn't
[1:42:04] your spirit that died it was the nature
[1:42:07] of your spirit died and that nature
[1:42:10] which is the soul
[1:42:12] brother Samuel why did it have to be
[1:42:14] why couldn't God just clean up that Soul
[1:42:16] because that soul is still married
[1:42:20] to another husband
[1:42:23] it's the second Adam
[1:42:25] and God will not marry one who has a
[1:42:29] living husband
[1:42:31] right because that would be adultery
[1:42:34] right that's why the false church when
[1:42:36] she claims she's married to Christ but
[1:42:38] she's living in adultery because she
[1:42:39] still has another living husband how can
[1:42:41] you say that because she she holds the
[1:42:43] Bible or she'll cry it ain't about whom
[1:42:45] the Bible crosses it's what's held in
[1:42:47] here that's holding you
[1:42:49] because whatever is here that don't tie
[1:42:51] us into here something's wrong there's
[1:42:52] not a union
[1:42:54] right
[1:42:56] now that'll never appeal to a carnal man
[1:42:58] but to a spiritual man there's something
[1:43:00] about it just raise up and said that's
[1:43:01] what I've been rolling for that's it
[1:43:04] right there that's what I need why
[1:43:06] because all the time you've been an
[1:43:07] eagle and you're Desiring to come out of
[1:43:09] that cage you've tried to rise to a spot
[1:43:11] and you beat your head on the on the
[1:43:13] cage beat your head on the cage but now
[1:43:15] there's something that says you're free
[1:43:16] the penalty's been paid the guilt has
[1:43:19] been dismissed you can rise in the glory
[1:43:21] of almighty God through the grace of God
[1:43:24] that comes to lead us in Repentance and
[1:43:26] through the waters of baptism and into
[1:43:28] the Holy Ghost
[1:43:29] it wasn't your body died it wasn't your
[1:43:32] spirit died it was the nature of your
[1:43:34] spirit died oh he says which is the soul
[1:43:39] and the nature of your soul is God
[1:43:42] if you're born again
[1:43:45] if it's not it's of the world
[1:43:48] so who's controlling who
[1:43:55] Romans 8 29 everybody all right
[1:44:00] for whom he did for no
[1:44:02] he also did
[1:44:04] predestinate
[1:44:06] for what
[1:44:08] to be conformed
[1:44:11] to the image of his son
[1:44:14] that he might be the firstborn
[1:44:18] among many brethren
[1:44:22] simple example that comes to me right
[1:44:24] now
[1:44:25] they have those Auto shows up in Detroit
[1:44:27] or wherever now I don't know if they
[1:44:28] still have them or not they used to have
[1:44:29] an IX Center too I think right remember
[1:44:31] in the mall
[1:44:33] back in the days of dinosaurs when we
[1:44:34] actually had malls
[1:44:36] remember how they would have the car set
[1:44:37] up in the middle you're going to sit
[1:44:39] down in the car man I look good in a
[1:44:41] Camaro man man look at this in the truck
[1:44:43] man I got me a gun rack in my you know I
[1:44:45] mean you can go sit in those cars let me
[1:44:47] just say this to you when they display
[1:44:49] him in an auto show
[1:44:51] what they're displaying is is prototypes
[1:44:54] right and that prototype is letting you
[1:44:58] know this is what's going to be coming
[1:45:00] out of the assembly lines
[1:45:03] right but that prototype is not what
[1:45:06] you'd end up driving on the road because
[1:45:08] a lot of times it has other you know
[1:45:10] sometimes it might be more plastic than
[1:45:11] anything I know you say which vehicle
[1:45:12] isn't now but you understand what I'm
[1:45:14] saying right
[1:45:15] when God became man it wasn't just a
[1:45:18] prototype it wasn't just something cheap
[1:45:20] he became fully man
[1:45:23] he was he became fully he was tempted in
[1:45:27] all things such as we are
[1:45:29] he became fully but it was also a
[1:45:31] declaration there's more coming
[1:45:35] there's more coming just like it and
[1:45:38] they're going to come off the same
[1:45:39] assembly line
[1:45:42] glory be to God I've already got a
[1:45:43] covenant I mean a contract I mean a
[1:45:45] covenant it's going to be coming
[1:45:47] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:45:49] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:45:51] many Brethren this is what the word
[1:45:52] conform means it is it means it
[1:45:55] describes where those two stars are
[1:45:57] describes what is the essence and
[1:46:00] character and thus it's complete or
[1:46:02] durable not merely a form
[1:46:05] or an outline
[1:46:08] not just something on the outside
[1:46:10] because everybody knows everybody here
[1:46:13] no matter where you've been
[1:46:15] if you try to serve God just by what you
[1:46:18] can do on the outside now let me I have
[1:46:20] to spend a little bit of moments with
[1:46:22] this here
[1:46:23] there is something that rises in our
[1:46:25] hearts that says Lord I want to please
[1:46:27] you
[1:46:29] okay that's not trying to what I'm
[1:46:31] trying to do the outside that's not
[1:46:32] that's not what we're talking about here
[1:46:34] there has to the God begins to direct
[1:46:36] and get a hold of the heart to submit to
[1:46:38] him it's when a an individual a person
[1:46:42] becomes content with looking at well I
[1:46:46] have this or I do this or I do that if
[1:46:48] it's not from your heart let me just
[1:46:50] tell you when you're out of sight out of
[1:46:52] mind you'll do what's in your heart
[1:46:54] are you hearing me what whatever's in
[1:46:56] here is going to come out I don't care
[1:46:58] if you put it on a deserted island it's
[1:46:59] going to come out
[1:47:01] that's why it's Gotta that's why this
[1:47:03] has got to get changed on the inside
[1:47:06] okay it's going to come out no matter
[1:47:08] where it's at Under Pressure whatever
[1:47:09] it's going to come out that's why I'm
[1:47:10] gone when it could be conformed to His
[1:47:12] Image as we read last week wasn't for us
[1:47:15] to grow a beard wear a long Palestinian
[1:47:17] robe or dress or or do exactly as we say
[1:47:19] well what he did is to have his image
[1:47:23] his life in us and that reflected
[1:47:28] through us
[1:47:30] now personally say well I have I have
[1:47:32] Jesus in my heart okay I'll go along
[1:47:34] with you for that you've accepted the
[1:47:35] Lord in Salvation I'll go along with
[1:47:36] that but then when more word is
[1:47:38] presented will you go along with more
[1:47:40] word
[1:47:41] because the very one who's LED you in
[1:47:43] Repentance is wanting to lead you all
[1:47:44] the way to where he cleans you up
[1:47:47] and he fills you up
[1:47:49] he that begun the good work in you will
[1:47:52] perform it right
[1:47:54] I want more of him
[1:47:56] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:47:58] he also called and whom he called them
[1:48:00] he also Justified and whom he justified
[1:48:02] them he also glorified
[1:48:06] but they're just wait to take these
[1:48:07] papers I want you to hand them out here
[1:48:09] to some people okay four papers just
[1:48:11] hand them out whoever you want to
[1:48:15] just go ahead right now and just hand
[1:48:16] them out so I want to say this
[1:48:19] now don't be doing like a bunch of
[1:48:20] school me me
[1:48:24] we are ordained to Bear the Heavenly
[1:48:28] image
[1:48:30] hey I've borne the Earthly image you
[1:48:32] born the Earthly image and we still have
[1:48:34] that Earthly image we still have those
[1:48:36] characteristics of our family right we
[1:48:39] can look back and you look like a dad
[1:48:41] look like Mom look like grandpa or
[1:48:43] whatever more you know we didn't get to
[1:48:45] go to an extra value menu and say I'll
[1:48:46] take their nose their ears and their we
[1:48:48] didn't get to say oh take that
[1:48:49] personality or I'll take we didn't get

[1:48:55] it that everything even your eye color
[1:48:59] you mean my makeup my temperament you
[1:49:02] mean God God made that for a purpose
[1:49:09] God made that for a purpose okay
[1:49:11] so I want you to stay stay with me here
[1:49:13] thank you brother just wait so he's the
[1:49:15] firstborn among many brother now I want
[1:49:17] you to think of this Hebrews 1 3.
[1:49:21] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:49:24] they talk about the ones who spoke
[1:49:26] through the prophets revealed
[1:49:29] same nature through the prophets his
[1:49:31] nature never changed can you say Amen
[1:49:32] I'm God and I change not what never
[1:49:34] changes his nature right
[1:49:38] what changed his form
[1:49:41] right his form changed Elijah Elijah
[1:49:45] Elisha Jeremiah Isaiah different forms
[1:49:48] but his nature
[1:49:51] has always been the same I'm God and I
[1:49:55] change not
[1:49:56] my form changes but I don't change
[1:50:00] well how do I know it's him because I'll
[1:50:03] act the same but behind this form that I
[1:50:06] did this form that I did this for
[1:50:11] Glory
[1:50:14] and the express image of this person now
[1:50:18] here's what the express image I think I

[1:52:40] remember there's something right here

[1:52:46] like this
[1:52:47] now
[1:52:49] what's the same about them
[1:52:51] the message is the same what's different
[1:52:55] the paper the colors
[1:52:59] and some of them everybody's got
[1:53:02] different hurts
[1:53:03] different things they come with
[1:53:05] but what's important is when he is there
[1:53:08] like that he's able to mend that which
[1:53:10] is torn he's able to heal that which is
[1:53:12] broken
[1:53:13] are you hearing me now he moves into
[1:53:16] that life to bring healing in that life
[1:53:20] amen come to God he's the great
[1:53:22] physician God does not look at you and
[1:53:24] say you got too much too many hurts and
[1:53:26] this was done and this was done he says
[1:53:28] no you just let me get into my position
[1:53:31] and to offer you into your position
[1:53:33] [Applause]
[1:53:39] as the Son and Daughter of God you rule
[1:53:42] over it different sheets of paper but
[1:53:45] the same God
[1:53:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:53:50] forever thank you God bless you
[1:53:54] keep it in your Bible we may need that
[1:53:55] again
[1:53:59] Hallelujah
[1:54:03] Hallelujah
[1:54:05] don't you love him
[1:54:09] this is why it comes down
[1:54:11] and brother Brian can say truly
[1:54:13] when a man is truly he's not truly
[1:54:15] converted until he's been changed and
[1:54:18] died to himself and the Holy Spirit has
[1:54:20] control of that person
[1:54:22] now can I just say this real quick all
[1:54:25] those tears and wrinkles and everything
[1:54:28] else
[1:54:29] that I want you to understand me now
[1:54:32] that isn't something that's done away
[1:54:34] with one night at an altar
[1:54:36] but Samuel what are you doing I'm
[1:54:38] putting a real true expectation on the
[1:54:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:42] but what it is God equips you as a Son
[1:54:44] of God and he says okay walls that's
[1:54:46] been built in your life walls between
[1:54:49] relationships everything else I have
[1:54:51] come to bring healing in your life
[1:54:54] because sometimes the very ways that
[1:54:56] we're responding has nothing to do with
[1:54:58] the person that we're responding to it
[1:55:00] has everything to do with the
[1:55:01] experiences and misrepresentations that
[1:55:04] we've had in the past
[1:55:06] but let me say this to you and remind
[1:55:08] you who's in you the same message and
[1:55:11] the same message that's in you it
[1:55:13] releases to your healing virtue it
[1:55:15] releases to your strength it releases to
[1:55:17] do what to be able to heal that which is
[1:55:19] broken
[1:55:20] on that paper if I could really
[1:55:22] represent it the right way that soul
[1:55:24] that soul is not what's torn that soul
[1:55:27] is not what's wrinkled
[1:55:30] it's a spirit
[1:55:32] it's that part which is in the body of
[1:55:34] sin
[1:55:36] he comes to circumcise to to separate
[1:55:39] that old nature and then as he gets on
[1:55:42] the inside then what does he do he can
[1:55:44] begin to emanate his glory to where you
[1:55:47] can look in your life and say
[1:55:49] it's not an open wound there's a scar
[1:55:52] what does a scar say I've been healed
[1:55:56] I've been healed
[1:55:58] for the son of righteousness shall arise
[1:56:01] with healing in his wings
[1:56:06] with the glory be to God in the highest
[1:56:08] Hallelujah
[1:56:09] now he said the Holy Spirit think about
[1:56:12] those sheets of paper here and I'm
[1:56:13] trying to come down the holy spirit will
[1:56:15] not misbehave itself in one person and
[1:56:18] behave itself in another it'll make each
[1:56:21] person
[1:56:22] come into its character
[1:56:25] see the Holy Spirit draws us into his
[1:56:27] character because I mean why is that
[1:56:28] important because
[1:56:30] when you look at somebody else don't try
[1:56:32] to be like them
[1:56:34] if there's anything you want to be on
[1:56:36] you say Lord I want an experience like
[1:56:39] they've got
[1:56:41] not I want to act like them
[1:56:43] because then you're an impersonator
[1:56:47] and I'm not saying that to be strong I'm
[1:56:49] saying God God comes to deal with you
[1:56:50] individually that's why his pride is not
[1:56:53] manhandled
[1:56:55] that's why you'll never hear from this
[1:56:57] Pulpit or from me something that comes
[1:56:59] down to you like that you'll never hear
[1:57:01] that by his grace
[1:57:03] and if he does you need to come to me
[1:57:04] because it's a wrong
[1:57:06] because his bride is not manhandled
[1:57:08] because let me tell you that will only
[1:57:09] last as long as you're around somebody
[1:57:11] that's like this
[1:57:14] what needs to be is a new ruler an
[1:57:16] ownership on the inside not afraid of
[1:57:18] your pastor not afraid of somebody else
[1:57:20] but a fear a reverent clean holy fear
[1:57:25] for the Lord
[1:57:27] because let me tell you something we're
[1:57:29] going to just we're going to work we're
[1:57:30] going to displease one another
[1:57:34] right I don't care how much you you
[1:57:36] might think me or you either one are the
[1:57:38] best thing since sour cream or whipped
[1:57:40] cream guess what we're going to
[1:57:41] disappoint one another because you know
[1:57:43] why we're still in this body
[1:57:46] but oh if there's a Oneness on the
[1:57:49] inside it unites with the Oneness on the
[1:57:51] inside of you what is it we've got
[1:57:53] something greater in us working in us
[1:57:56] through us than our differences than our
[1:57:58] disagreements then our opinions then our
[1:58:00] ideas
[1:58:01] and that's Rapture material
[1:58:05] when we can walk to the mountain like
[1:58:06] Abraham and say the rest stay right here
[1:58:08] I'm going to go Yonder and worship I
[1:58:10] don't know how God's going to do it I
[1:58:12] don't know how God's going to dissolve
[1:58:13] this division this disagreement I don't
[1:58:15] know how God's going to do it but I'm
[1:58:16] going to obey his word I'm going to do
[1:58:18] what offer up what he gave to me he gave
[1:58:21] you the power when he gave you the Holy
[1:58:23] Ghost to offer yourself
[1:58:25] and let the word live through you
[1:58:33] can I finish this quote
[1:58:38] it
[1:58:41] it'll make each person come into its
[1:58:44] character
[1:58:45] once again
[1:58:47] that's not something that's just pow
[1:58:51] because if every one of us are honest
[1:58:53] right now
[1:58:55] right
[1:58:56] it's amazing sometimes how with age we
[1:58:58] get rose-colored glasses
[1:59:00] about our own self
[1:59:02] well my kids never did this and not well
[1:59:04] just coach Let's go ask some of your
[1:59:05] kids
[1:59:07] because maybe what you remember you have
[1:59:09] seasonally somehow forgot I could preach
[1:59:12] on this for a minute
[1:59:13] aren't you grateful that God gives you
[1:59:15] Grace to forget all that and what you do
[1:59:17] remember about your children is that
[1:59:19] which is good
[1:59:20] that's the grace of God
[1:59:22] that's the grace of God that's a little
[1:59:24] foretaste of the marriage supper
[1:59:26] thank God for that right because you
[1:59:28] could never see him in another light
[1:59:29] right you'd always see him as the this
[1:59:31] or the that or whatever more but thank
[1:59:33] God for his grace aren't you glad for
[1:59:35] Grace has been provided for us that God
[1:59:37] is not seeing us in the light as a
[1:59:38] sinner but he sees us as one of his
[1:59:40] children we have been chosen before him
[1:59:43] in love
[1:59:47] it brings you con brings you in
[1:59:49] subjection to his character
[1:59:53] character is what
[1:59:55] a gift or a victory
[1:59:57] victory
[1:59:58] the Holy Ghost is the gift of God
[2:00:01] the character is a victory
[2:00:04] now Brother Carlos I'm not that smart
[2:00:05] but I think I know victories mean we
[2:00:07] have to have what
[2:00:09] War battles right some battles we lose
[2:00:12] some battles we've lost but guess what
[2:00:13] we ain't won the war because we are on
[2:00:15] the Victor's side
[2:00:17] yeah
[2:00:18] if I get knocked down I'm going to get
[2:00:20] back up again if I get knocked down I'm
[2:00:22] going to get back up again why I've got
[2:00:24] one in me who stood for me now he's
[2:00:27] standing in me and I'm standing for him
[2:00:30] I'm gonna get back up again I'm gonna
[2:00:32] get back up again I'm gonna get back up
[2:00:34] again
[2:00:36] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:38] amen it'll make each person come into
[2:00:40] its character
[2:00:43] because it's a spirit that leads you
[2:00:45] it brings you
[2:00:47] and makes you subject
[2:00:49] to its nature
[2:00:53] you don't bring it subject to your
[2:00:55] nature
[2:00:57] oh we get in trouble
[2:00:59] we don't bring it subject to us
[2:01:02] it makes you subject
[2:01:05] to its nature
[2:01:07] and the Holy Spirit makes you live
[2:01:09] and love to do it
[2:01:12] Lord I'm soul
[2:01:14] in love with you
[2:01:19] you touch my heart
[2:01:22] with your grace
[2:01:24] and Lord I'm so in love not with the
[2:01:28] church not with the pastor but with you
[2:01:34] glory be to God
[2:01:36] oh how you love to give up the things of
[2:01:38] the world when the Holy Spirit comes in
[2:01:43] once again
[2:01:44] he's still
[2:01:45] he's still working on me
[2:01:48] because sometimes some of those things
[2:01:49] of the world is what's still out there
[2:01:51] in that body of sin and he's working and
[2:01:54] saying you're not going to go in that
[2:01:56] direction
[2:01:57] oh that might be a strain through your
[2:01:58] family but you're under a different
[2:02:00] strain now
[2:02:02] you're under a different stream now do
[2:02:04] you love him
[2:02:05] how it cleanses you and washes you and
[2:02:08] puts a desire
[2:02:09] in you
[2:02:11] to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger
[2:02:14] for More of it just bathing yourself
[2:02:18] he brings
[2:02:19] realities
[2:02:21] don't you love him
[2:02:26] I love the scripture
[2:02:30] when Jesus stands there and out of the
[2:02:32] book of Isaiah
[2:02:34] Luke chapter 4.
[2:02:37] and it begins to speak
[2:02:40] he's come
[2:02:42] pull that upward for me Brianna pull it
[2:02:44] up Luke 4 and I don't remember what
[2:02:46] scripture somebody it's one where Jesus
[2:02:48] is the one I've come to heal the broken
[2:02:50] the bruise pull that up for me would you
[2:02:51] please
[2:02:53] but
[2:02:54] what this Jubilee does in this Jubilee
[2:02:56] is the announcement
[2:02:58] that the atonement has been made for you
[2:03:01] you don't have to keep
[2:03:03] trying to be a better person
[2:03:06] I mean yes giving ourselves to the word
[2:03:08] but rise
[2:03:10] and take what the word is saying
[2:03:13] come back to your inheritance
[2:03:15] and listen to as the word is saying as
[2:03:17] you're in your inheritance God's
[2:03:18] equipped you but Lord I see you
[2:03:22] and this no
[2:03:24] you got to look deeper deeper yeah look
[2:03:27] deeper and you see me in you
[2:03:32] that's your overcoming
[2:03:34] that's your victory
[2:03:37] that's how walls come down of Jericho
[2:03:40] that's how cities are burned to the
[2:03:42] ground
[2:03:43] that's how strongholds are pulled down
[2:03:47] not by what you do
[2:03:50] but what you can yield yourself to
[2:03:54] I'm The God Who made the Covenant
[2:03:56] and I cannot fail
[2:03:58] you got that up there in Luke chapter
[2:04:01] four
[2:04:02] 4 18 Luke 4 18 thank you brother Brian
[2:04:08] here it is can we read this together
[2:04:11] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[2:04:14] because he hath anointed me to preach
[2:04:18] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[2:04:21] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[2:04:24] Deliverance to the captives and
[2:04:26] recovering of sight to the blind to heal
[2:04:29] just sorry to set at Liberty them that
[2:04:33] are bruised
[2:04:35] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:04:38] think about them papers there might be
[2:04:40] some tears and wrinkles but he came
[2:04:42] to not only release the captive he said
[2:04:44] but I've come I've come to minister to
[2:04:46] the bruise those who've been bruised and
[2:04:49] something is has taken place that's
[2:04:51] tried to hinder the woman at the well
[2:04:53] was one
[2:04:54] come on in it ain't just about he'll
[2:04:56] Fame but she was one Rahab was one
[2:05:00] but what had to get to her there had to
[2:05:02] come a voice to her that was able to
[2:05:04] tell her this is who you really are
[2:05:07] and I want to tell you that you are
[2:05:10] beautiful in my sight
[2:05:11] Lord this I don't know I'm talking about
[2:05:13] this what I ordained you to be
[2:05:18] they were bruised scarred
[2:05:21] human beings
[2:05:23] that he came to minister and said look
[2:05:26] I'm not here just to minister to your
[2:05:28] bruise but I'll come to the inside I'll
[2:05:31] bring healing from the inside
[2:05:36] because that's real healing
[2:05:38] I say Lord
[2:05:40] as the prophet would say over and over
[2:05:42] beginning of the message middle the
[2:05:43] message in the end of the message the
[2:05:44] token in Jeffersonville what does he
[2:05:46] talk about taking the medicine
[2:05:49] taken the medicine
[2:05:52] I want to keep taking the medicine why
[2:05:54] I'm being changed from Glory unto Glory
[2:05:58] you know what it's doing it's given the
[2:06:00] real me on the inside dominion over this
[2:06:02] guy on the outside
[2:06:04] because this guy on the outside this is
[2:06:06] only like that screen that allows those
[2:06:08] words to be on it
[2:06:11] that's all that screen serves a purpose
[2:06:12] for if we turn this off right here turn
[2:06:15] that that which sends the signal all the
[2:06:17] way and send it all the way to that part
[2:06:19] right there you turn it off you have a
[2:06:20] blank screen right but that's when the
[2:06:22] light of God the Holy Spirit comes into
[2:06:23] a life it's not our body that died
[2:06:27] not our spirit
[2:06:29] but it's the soul that nature
[2:06:31] that died
[2:06:33] and Christ raises that nature he say
[2:06:36] raises that which he placed within us by
[2:06:37] the quickening power and there's a new
[2:06:40] life on the inside
[2:06:42] The Spar heads
[2:06:47] think about that son of the king
[2:06:51] he was a slave and remember one came
[2:06:53] down to buy
[2:06:54] some slaves or a slave and
[2:06:57] he looked out there across the field and
[2:06:58] he said
[2:07:00] he's seen this one it acted it just
[2:07:02] acted different
[2:07:03] he had to do some of the same jobs
[2:07:07] he wasn't the boss's pet or her pet or
[2:07:09] whatever more but he had to do some of
[2:07:12] the same stuff
[2:07:14] sometimes they ask why is he acting
[2:07:16] different do you feed him yeah he eats
[2:07:18] the same stuff
[2:07:19] does he does he sleep in a different but
[2:07:21] no he sleeps in the same bunk house the
[2:07:22] rest of them sleep in
[2:07:24] well so what what's different about him
[2:07:25] what's making him act different
[2:07:29] well I wondered that myself one day he
[2:07:31] said the owner until one day I
[2:07:34] recognized and realized
[2:07:36] he's the son of a king and he knows
[2:07:41] he's the son of a king
[2:07:43] he knows his father
[2:07:45] in a distant land
[2:07:48] is a king
[2:07:50] and so while in this land
[2:07:53] the land where he's at does not change
[2:07:55] him from being the son of a king
[2:07:58] he was born
[2:07:59] a son of a king
[2:08:01] and so he conducts himself in that way
[2:08:05] I wonder here this morning if we can say
[2:08:07] Lord
[2:08:09] that's Lord the desire from the depths
[2:08:11] of My Heart Lord
[2:08:13] maybe you've never walked fully into
[2:08:15] that part of the new birth but what an
[2:08:17] opportunity this morning to say Lord and
[2:08:19] really from your heart
[2:08:21] whether at your seat whether at an altar
[2:08:23] it matters about your heart because you
[2:08:26] could come to an altar but remember it's
[2:08:27] not an altar that does it the real altar
[2:08:30] is in your heart where you offer up and
[2:08:32] surrender your own will
[2:08:35] that's where it really takes place
[2:08:38] and you have to accept what he's already
[2:08:40] done he he's doesn't have to go to
[2:08:43] Calvary again he doesn't have to raise
[2:08:45] it he's already paid the price well
[2:08:47] brother Samuel you don't know all the
[2:08:48] baggage in my life I don't need to know
[2:08:50] it all he already paid
[2:08:54] for it all
[2:08:56] and if you can really accept it
[2:08:59] that call of freedom and liberty is
[2:09:01] going out
[2:09:03] that right now
[2:09:05] there can be a real merging in a uniting
[2:09:07] a real laying down Lord I'm I don't want
[2:09:10] to try to live it this is a miserable
[2:09:12] life trying me trying to live it me
[2:09:14] trying to do it watching his brother
[2:09:16] Samuel around but Lord I realize like
[2:09:18] brother Samuel said you don't do it for
[2:09:20] me you don't do it for a church you you
[2:09:21] do it as unto the Lord
[2:09:24] why do we do what we do we do it because
[2:09:26] of the spirit of God within us directs
[2:09:28] us to the word of God and we see it's
[2:09:30] the desire of almighty God and that same
[2:09:33] nature is working in us we want to
[2:09:35] please him we love him because he first
[2:09:38] loved us
[2:09:39] our own human love can never equate to
[2:09:42] the love of God this is why Calvary Made
[2:09:45] A Way That You and I by the love of God
[2:09:48] pulling on our hearts can lead us
[2:09:51] that we might have our day on Calvary
[2:09:55] that that love of God
[2:09:58] could do a full work and come fooling in
[2:10:00] our lives and bring about a real
[2:10:02] transformation
[2:10:03] and as we are here gathered here this
[2:10:05] morning what what a wonderful privilege
[2:10:07] what an opportunity I'll tell you this
[2:10:09] morning if I didn't have that life I
[2:10:11] would be so oppressed upon my heart and
[2:10:13] realize what a benefit has been given to
[2:10:16] us this morning has the spirit of God
[2:10:18] would put up on our hearts forget not
[2:10:20] the Lord and all his benefits
[2:10:24] the very center chapter of the whole
[2:10:26] Bible Psalms 103.
[2:10:30] Christ is the center of it all
[2:10:33] oh Lord as we remember your benefits
[2:10:36] what about us what about lives
[2:10:39] that where we've crossed over by the
[2:10:41] grace of God we we have that seal in our
[2:10:43] life we know that our life has passed
[2:10:45] from Death unto life oh we might be
[2:10:46] different paper that's true
[2:10:49] different in our makeup different in a
[2:10:51] lot of ways but one thing that is the
[2:10:53] same is the nature and it's not just
[2:10:55] what we're saying it's not just because
[2:10:56] that nature being the same isn't just
[2:10:58] because I go to a message Church carry a
[2:11:00] message book to carry a Bible quote a
[2:11:03] Bible quote the message no no that's
[2:11:05] that's not what it is it's his living
[2:11:07] presence
[2:11:08] on display
[2:11:10] in our lives
[2:11:12] remember true Oneness is the spirit in
[2:11:14] us that agrees with every word of God
[2:11:19] and it manifests itself through us so
[2:11:22] agreeing with the word of God that's a
[2:11:24] start that's a start to Oneness amen
[2:11:27] amen but I would say here this morning
[2:11:30] if there is something where it's not
[2:11:31] manifesting something on the inside
[2:11:33] where there's an amen
[2:11:35] say Lord I need thee amen of the word I
[2:11:38] need the finished work I need the so be
[2:11:40] it as our heads are bowed and eyes are
[2:11:43] closed how many I wonder if we just be
[2:11:45] honest before God this morning
[2:11:48] the holy spirit is not pulling on
[2:11:49] everybody pulling our hearts and
[2:11:51] ministering to lives this morning to let
[2:11:53] us know that there is a place to where
[2:11:54] the character of Christ remember what he
[2:11:57] he will not miss misbehave himself in
[2:12:00] one
[2:12:01] and behave himself in another
[2:12:03] his nature
[2:12:05] is the same
[2:12:08] remember I wonder if there'd be one this
[2:12:09] morning say Lord that's what I want
[2:12:11] that's what I want in my life I want
[2:12:14] that Lord
[2:12:16] and God bless you God bless your hands
[2:12:17] that's my desire Lord I want that in my
[2:12:20] life
[2:12:21] I want that
[2:12:22] I want that working Lord in my heart
[2:12:25] that character
[2:12:28] I wonder if we as we express from our
[2:12:31] hearts and say Lord
[2:12:33] this is this is the desire Lord help me
[2:12:35] daily to die to myself you've Lord made
[2:12:38] me aware I realize it but I I see it
[2:12:42] more right here there's maybe there's
[2:12:44] hurts there's baggage
[2:12:46] God's Not Afraid of the baggage in your
[2:12:48] life God's Not Afraid of the hurts he's
[2:12:50] not afraid of the where your spirit
[2:12:53] maybe has been torn been wounded been
[2:12:55] bruised
[2:12:57] but there's one in the house this
[2:12:59] morning that can do for you what no
[2:13:01] psychologist no psychiatrist I'm not
[2:13:03] against them
[2:13:04] remember his brother Ram told us he said
[2:13:06] everything that helps he said that which
[2:13:08] helps is of God I'm not against it
[2:13:10] but I'm letting you know there's one
[2:13:12] here this morning that can go down that
[2:13:14] there is no prescription they can write
[2:13:16] that will ever be able to satisfy it
[2:13:20] but there's one that can go right down
[2:13:22] and minister to you a healing brother
[2:13:23] Samuel how could that be I can't explain
[2:13:26] it but I'm a witness of it it's a
[2:13:28] paradox
[2:13:29] explain to me how that Daniel was in the
[2:13:32] Lion's Den and didn't get eaten and how
[2:13:33] that those lines was around him the
[2:13:35] whole time explain to me how that the
[2:13:37] three Hebrew children were in the fiery
[2:13:38] furnace and not only did they not get
[2:13:40] burned but they didn't even smell like
[2:13:41] smoke when they came out explain to me
[2:13:43] how that the bands on their wrist were
[2:13:45] burned off and their clothes wouldn't
[2:13:46] even smell like smoke or burnt explain
[2:13:48] it to me we can't it's a paradox tell me
[2:13:52] how God can take a man that could say I
[2:13:54] don't want nothing to do with that I
[2:13:55] don't want nothing to do with this but
[2:13:56] how God can take a man and turn that man
[2:13:58] around by the grace of God and that man
[2:14:00] will become a Powerhouse with the spirit
[2:14:03] of God living through his life his or
[2:14:04] her life in a way of humility explain
[2:14:06] that you can't
[2:14:08] it's a paradox
[2:14:10] so we're talking about the God of
[2:14:12] paradoxes this morning
[2:14:14] who comes and sits in the very middle of
[2:14:16] our Lives the midst of it
[2:14:18] I just say this morning how many would
[2:14:21] agree with me Lord make me more like you
[2:14:24] help me Lord to surrender just as I
[2:14:27] surrendered with Lord in Repentance just
[2:14:29] as I surrendered when you dealt with my
[2:14:31] heart with habits in my life just as
[2:14:33] Lord the surrendering coming to a place
[2:14:34] of fully letting down my will and the
[2:14:36] spirit of God coming and accepting
[2:14:39] and taking me into the body Lord that
[2:14:42] same surrendering Lord
[2:14:43] that equipped me to surrender to yield
[2:14:47] that's your character might come and
[2:14:50] mold my character
[2:14:52] into your own image
[2:14:56] I say Lord
[2:14:57] granted Lord in my life
[2:15:00] that's my heart's desire that's where my
[2:15:02] hands are at Lord mold me and shape me I
[2:15:04] don't want to be like brother so-and-so
[2:15:06] or sister so and so I appreciate that
[2:15:07] but what it is in them that strikes my
[2:15:09] heart if I've got the real objective
[2:15:11] it's Christ it's not them I don't want
[2:15:13] to be like them I want to act like them
[2:15:14] I want I want that same Jesus to come in
[2:15:17] me and act as Jesus would act through
[2:15:19] Samuel that's what I want just like
[2:15:22] Jesus would act on the pink piece of
[2:15:24] paper blue piece of paper yellow piece
[2:15:25] of paper white piece of paper it's still
[2:15:27] the same Jesus
[2:15:29] displayed in many forms
[2:15:33] oh my what victory when we can realize
[2:15:35] that Lord you don't want me to be like
[2:15:37] brother Aaron Brother Brian Brother Ray
[2:15:39] brother Joey brother Samuel brother
[2:15:40] Carly you don't want me to be like that
[2:15:41] you don't want me to be like so and so
[2:15:43] if I could just be like sister so and so
[2:15:44] why would you lower your sights
[2:15:47] be like Jesus
[2:15:49] quit looking at other people because
[2:15:50] other people eventually that you look at
[2:15:52] you'll see their faults you'll see their
[2:15:53] failures what should I do if you really
[2:15:55] get a clue true glimpse of that their
[2:15:57] life should be pointing you to Jesus
[2:16:00] Look Away to Jesus
[2:16:03] I say granted Lord this morning

[2:17:49] arrows no no no no no no we are
[2:17:51] surrendering to him who is seated in
[2:17:53] power and on his thigh was a name

[2:18:38] where Lord there has been bruising and
[2:18:41] hurt and scars and everything Lord God
[2:18:44] that would want to try to hinder him and
[2:18:46] tell them why they're not worthy there
[2:18:48] is not one thing that one person could
[2:18:50] ever do to make themselves worthy Lord
[2:18:54] they could live such a life that a
[2:18:57] person wouldn't be able to put a finger
[2:18:58] on that steel is not what makes us
[2:19:01] Worthy
[2:19:02] there is the worthy one
[2:19:05] who has been offered
[2:19:07] in our behalf

[2:19:11] made a way
[2:19:13] we love you this morning Lord
[2:19:15] in Jesus precious name
[2:19:19] hmm
[2:19:20] he
[2:19:22] made a way

[2:19:37] you
[2:19:39] you made
[2:19:42] oh come on little Eagle there's a weight

[2:21:00] and we're standing here only because
[2:21:07] this is what he'll do
[2:21:09] [Music]
[2:21:12] oh you move mountains
[2:21:16] and you cause walls
[2:21:21] [Music]
[2:21:30] it's not nothing
[2:21:33] oh that's impossible
[2:21:37] [Music]
[2:21:50] the express image of God
[2:21:53] that facsimile that facts
[2:21:56] a facts is something that's sent from
[2:21:58] one destination
[2:22:00] to another destination
[2:22:03] there's a point of transmission
[2:22:05] that sends it
[2:22:08] and there's got to be something on the
[2:22:09] other end too
[2:22:11] be able to receive it
[2:22:13] right we all have had that where you've
[2:22:16] had the facts important documents and
[2:22:18] sometimes are that important you say hey
[2:22:20] hey did you get them did you get them
[2:22:22] why because you know you sent them
[2:22:25] and let me tell you something
[2:22:28] he sent the Holy Ghost
[2:22:30] he sent the image
[2:22:32] man tried to cut the cable and block the
[2:22:34] cord but God said I've reserved a
[2:22:37] channel for myself for my image to come
[2:22:41] back into my church
[2:22:43] my character my life to come back on
[2:22:46] display
[2:22:48] he sent the Holy Ghost
[2:22:51] now you've seen those different sheets
[2:22:53] of paper
[2:22:54] right
[2:22:55] sometimes there's textured paper right
[2:22:57] you don't know what I'm talking about
[2:22:59] sometimes there's texture paper that you
[2:23:01] want for a formal announcement
[2:23:04] then you've got one that's a plain sheet
[2:23:06] of paper and then you've got once a
[2:23:07] little thicker sheet of paper
[2:23:10] than other sheets of paper
[2:23:11] but what what what is it that matters is
[2:23:14] it the paper
[2:23:16] it's what's on it
[2:23:18] help me preacher now
[2:23:20] the little boy wanted some ice cream he
[2:23:23] got a stamp out of a collection
[2:23:26] he went down to the pawn shop and the
[2:23:28] pawn shop looked at it he knew the value
[2:23:30] of that stamp
[2:23:33] and he offered the little boy
[2:23:36] hey he said I offer you five dollars
[2:23:38] little boy all you can think about his
[2:23:40] ice cream cone five dollars how many ice
[2:23:42] cream cones could I get with that
[2:23:44] that was before inflation how many ice
[2:23:46] cream cones can I get
[2:23:47] I was trying to see what he did he was a
[2:23:49] little boy he only thought in terms of
[2:23:52] little things
[2:23:54] are you hearing me now
[2:23:56] he's what was wrote on the paper
[2:23:58] but there was one who
[2:24:00] who knew what was on that paper he knew
[2:24:03] the value that was there and God in the
[2:24:05] end time once again has come down it
[2:24:08] wasn't the thinking of a man it was God
[2:24:10] who declared to you and I he took his
[2:24:13] word and he let you and I know my word
[2:24:15] is the same and I'm the Satan God
[2:24:19] and you begin to take it and play upon
[2:24:22] it he began to play upon it what did he
[2:24:24] do what looked to be of no value
[2:24:28] and was being sold nobody would even bid
[2:24:31] on it but when the master got it in his
[2:24:33] hand
[2:24:34] one who knew how to play it one who knew
[2:24:37] how to release what was trapped on the
[2:24:38] inside help me now somebody who knew
[2:24:41] what was how to release what was in here
[2:24:43] who knew how to release what was in you
[2:24:45] and I
[2:24:46] everybody else could have looked at our
[2:24:48] life bid I won't even give you a penny
[2:24:50] for his life
[2:24:53] let me take it let me get my hands on it
[2:24:57] Lord I'm of no value
[2:25:00] that's the way to come in humility
[2:25:04] but I
[2:25:06] he thought I was worth saving
[2:25:08] he shed his blood for me
[2:25:11] remember as I said the other night
[2:25:13] brother Brian said if I had three drops
[2:25:15] of the literal blood of Jesus Christ
[2:25:17] holding it to my chest he said sitting
[2:25:19] before me tonight is something that was
[2:25:21] more precious to him than this Blood
[2:25:23] because he shed his blood to purchase us
[2:25:27] in his sight
[2:25:30] what was on that stamp
[2:25:32] you know the report says it goes on that
[2:25:35] stamp
[2:25:36] who knows what has been sold for now
[2:25:37] what a little boy only looked at it in a
[2:25:39] little way is just five dollars
[2:25:41] it ended up being sold for millions of
[2:25:43] dollars
[2:25:45] did the Stamp change
[2:25:46] no did they beautify
[2:25:50] recognize
[2:25:52] what the value was
[2:25:54] and that's why the spirit of God comes
[2:25:56] to you and I to bring us to the
[2:25:57] realization of what the value of the
[2:26:00] Holy Ghost is
[2:26:01] it's more than a feeling it's more than
[2:26:03] an expression it's more than just
[2:26:04] something I feel at church on Sunday and
[2:26:06] it leaves me when I go out but it's
[2:26:08] something that comes down on the inside
[2:26:09] of the god it changes me there's an
[2:26:12] operation on the inside that changes me
[2:26:16] from an old creation to a new creation
[2:26:19] then from there it's automatically lived
[2:26:22] out what comes out of your life then
[2:26:23] well it depends on who you got on the
[2:26:24] inside right
[2:26:26] remember what we said earlier in the
[2:26:27] service whoever's living in the house
[2:26:28] they're the ones who causes the
[2:26:30] decorations to come forth
[2:26:32] but you let new ownership come in and
[2:26:34] guess what you don't have to tell that
[2:26:35] person man stop painting your shutters
[2:26:38] this color stop painting your door that
[2:26:40] color don't even match nope just get
[2:26:42] somebody in there
[2:26:45] that knows what to do and all the
[2:26:47] shutters and the doors will be will come
[2:26:49] forth you understand what I'm saying
[2:26:51] that's how it is in our life
[2:26:53] what is the value that's on the stamp
[2:26:56] the value of the spirit of God you
[2:27:00] made up a way
[2:27:04] [Music]
[2:27:09] and it looked as if it was over
[2:27:19] Hallelujah
