[22:22] I want to thank you all for your prayers

[22:27] for the cards and everything and and all
[22:30] this time
[22:31] you know you're going through these
[22:33] battles of life and we all do
[22:36] it's good to know that
[22:38] there's someone praying you know
[22:40] sometimes when you're going through it
[22:43] your faith just sometimes is not as
[22:45] strong
[22:46] as those that
[22:48] have maybe even been through a similar
[22:49] situation are just concealed
[22:52] your your needs and pray so
[22:56] I just want to thank you and Shirley
[22:58] wants to thank you and give you all her
[23:00] love and
[23:01] I Believe by God's grace when she gets
[23:03] enough strength she'll be back in
[23:05] amen and I got a couple of things on my
[23:08] heart so
[23:09] bear with me a minute I I feel this I
[23:12] need to tell you this okay
[23:14] and uh for one
[23:17] after this surgery and God blessed us
[23:19] and brought surely through it
[23:21] she couldn't move her left leg she
[23:23] couldn't do nothing with it I was having
[23:25] to put a build on it
[23:27] and when she wanted to go somewhere with
[23:29] the Walker I had to move that leg
[23:32] and so she kept trying kept trying never
[23:34] could move it nothing it was numb it was
[23:37] dead
[23:38] so
[23:39] this Thursday before church
[23:42] uh brother Samuel gave us a call and he
[23:45] said brother Dave he said I'm on uh
[23:49] we'll talk just a little bit and he said
[23:51] I want to pray with Shirley just go over
[23:53] there and lay your hands on her so I
[23:54] said I'll turn the phone on speaker too
[23:58] so he was again to pray and as he began
[24:00] to pray the presence of Our Lord just
[24:03] moved into that room
[24:05] and I could hardly hold the phone and I
[24:08] I know God was doing something answering
[24:11] prayer answer in all of your prayers for
[24:14] he's faithful and and so the next
[24:17] morning surely had been trying to trying
[24:20] to move that leg
[24:21] and I was sitting over my shirt and
[24:23] she's sitting out on the couch
[24:26] and she started to try to move that leg
[24:28] and he went right up
[24:30] hey man that's good
[24:36] hey man
[24:38] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[24:41] and forever he doesn't change his word
[24:45] Can't Fail amen and so so she kept
[24:48] getting stronger and and walking and
[24:50] this morning she was walking around in
[24:53] the kitchen without any help of a walk
[24:55] or cane or anything God's good and I
[24:58] just alone for the time we can take our
[25:00] walks together
[25:01] we'd do a couple miles around the track
[25:03] and talk about the Lord and I just loan
[25:05] for that time I now believe God will
[25:08] bring it it's just he gives us he can
[25:11] give us our hearts desire we have the
[25:13] right motives and objectives and to be
[25:15] back in church and serve him
[25:17] another thing that's been on my heart
[25:19] and I I told Brother Samuel about this
[25:22] and I'm kind of and it's hard for me and
[25:24] I'm kind of ashamed of this but I want
[25:26] to tell you
[25:27] for for six years
[25:31] I went through a hard time with my
[25:33] nerves
[25:34] not just nervous this was different
[25:37] this was a nervousness
[25:40] that you had no control
[25:43] and that you
[25:45] you was like in a tunnel
[25:48] you couldn't get out
[25:49] you know you were saved everything was
[25:52] okay there
[25:53] but these nerves were coming apart and I
[25:56] hope if somebody's going through this
[25:57] this might help them
[25:59] and at times I thought my mind was going
[26:02] to snap not that I wasn't saved I just
[26:05] couldn't control this and they ended up
[26:08] sending me to Cleveland I was
[26:10] like an outfall in some and so forth and
[26:13] and the
[26:16] doctor there said David it's it's not
[26:20] your heart they was checking all that he
[26:21] said it's your nerves
[26:23] and he gave me some medicine
[26:25] and it helped but it didn't take it away
[26:28] and I
[26:31] and I was taking this medicine and doing
[26:34] the best I could and we lived at Norwalk
[26:36] at the time
[26:37] and I was on my way to work and I
[26:39] stopped at this light and it's really
[26:42] something it it was the light that was
[26:44] on my road that I Live Now 250 and
[26:47] Robert Road
[26:48] you say that's a coincidence
[26:50] no God God don't do just coincidence he
[26:54] knows exactly what he's doing he's in
[26:57] control and I'm waiting on the light to
[26:59] change and that was bothering me
[27:01] and that still Small Voice Spoken Here
[27:04] I wished I could hear it more
[27:06] you know but he knows what he's doing
[27:09] and he spoke to me and he said this
[27:12] isn't going to bother you anymore
[27:14] and it left
[27:19] [Applause]
[27:22] and it's never bothered me since and
[27:24] that's been years ago
[27:26] and it won't because he said he wouldn't
[27:29] man
[27:30] [Applause]
[27:32] one other thing I want to tell you
[27:34] and I I this is hard for me and I think
[27:38] of the woman
[27:40] that was in the prayer line on that deep
[27:42] call of the deep to the film
[27:45] and she said he she was all tore up
[27:48] and he said someone told a lie on you I
[27:52] said you were a witch
[27:53] and he said sister that's why your
[27:55] heart's like this and you're all to her
[27:56] but you know what God knowed and it was
[27:59] over
[28:00] and he's also let me know about this
[28:02] it's been hard for me
[28:04] but there was a trouble I told on me and
[28:07] it hurt me so much and it's hard
[28:09] and I prayed and I know that I couldn't
[28:11] defend myself if I did that I would take
[28:14] it out of God's hands
[28:16] and I want it in his hands and I
[28:19] realized he knows all about it he let me
[28:21] know and I'm so what comforted me
[28:23] was that he knows the truth of
[28:25] everything
[28:26] see Satan will do those things
[28:30] and you know I'm sorry that I was
[28:32] ashamed I should have been asking my
[28:35] brothers and sisters to pray for me
[28:36] that's God's way the body of Christ
[28:40] but I I you know
[28:43] I just wanted to let you know
[28:46] that like the other evening it was
[28:49] always about three in the morning or
[28:51] something I was praying
[28:53] and I thought I had fully forgived I had
[28:56] tried
[28:58] but I hadn't
[29:00] and God helped me by his grace to fully
[29:02] forgive and I pray that whoever told
[29:06] that lie
[29:07] and whoever believes it would be
[29:10] forgiven with all my heart that it'll be
[29:12] gone and not not held against him so I I
[29:17] thank God it took a long time but he
[29:19] brought me to that place that I could
[29:21] really really forget with all my heart
[29:23] amen God bless you thank you for your
[29:26] prayers love you and appreciate it

[41:17] through my own
[41:20] Glory
[41:23] foreign
[41:24] [Music]
[41:36] Hallelujah
[41:39] when I believed I received the deed
[41:43] but I still had all leans against me
[41:46] but once the abstract has come
[41:49] then all liens have been stricken off
[41:53] another way of placing it
[41:55] is that
[41:57] when one of the times I was going to go
[42:00] to the first time I was going to Ghana I
[42:02] didn't realize they needed a Visa
[42:04] I didn't know I needed a visa to get
[42:05] into Ghana so I had to do all overnight
[42:07] within a week
[42:10] but you know God was determined to go
[42:13] for me to go so the Lord made a way
[42:15] through all of my ignorance
[42:17] and when you look at it I could had a
[42:20] passport I could have flown and come to
[42:22] there but I would not have been gained
[42:24] entrance into the country without a Visa
[42:27] and the prophet said the passport that's
[42:30] your belief your Visa is your token
[42:34] [Applause]
[42:36] you can have a passport but they don't
[42:39] mean you're going to get in you must
[42:41] have the Visa and the Visa is God
[42:44] himself confirming and accepting your
[42:47] faith that you were indeed with him
[42:50] before the foundation of the world
[42:54] amen and the Visa you know when I
[42:57] applied for Visa there was the first one
[42:59] it was only for I think 30 days so then
[43:02] I had to apply for the next one because
[43:04] they wanted me to come the following
[43:05] year when I applied for the next one
[43:07] then it was for 60 months now brother
[43:09] Samson then we're rejoicing they're like
[43:11] he's got to keep coming keep coming keep
[43:12] coming
[43:14] but this Visa
[43:16] it's a seal until the day of redemption
[43:20] there is no expiration because in full
[43:24] reality you are always saved
[43:26] [Music]
[43:28] but the Holy Spirit has come upon you to
[43:31] make you aware of this
[43:33] amen
[43:34] oh glory be to God
[43:36] oh my isn't it wonderful right through
[43:38] the scriptures all we see is redemption
[43:40] Redemption Redemption

[1:01:47] he said let I was happy when they said

[1:01:54] Liberty
[1:01:56] in the house of God that is joy
[1:01:59] in the house of God that is freedom
[1:02:01] Hallelujah in the house of God you feel
[1:02:04] the presence of God coming around you
[1:02:06] and even within you
[1:02:08] that is why I agree with David this
[1:02:10] morning and I'm always happy to come
[1:02:13] into the house of the Lord because there
[1:02:15] is no way I can have my joy
[1:02:18] only in his presence
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:23] well this morning we want to continue
[1:02:26] the rest where we left last Thursday
[1:02:29] those of you will not hear Thursday I'm
[1:02:32] sorry I cannot go back
[1:02:34] we are going forward
[1:02:36] thank you
[1:02:38] Hallelujah but uh I think the topic of
[1:02:41] the sermon was come up either
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:46] um I wish I have time to do the part two
[1:02:48] the part three before the path forward
[1:02:50] uh the Lord just told me that bring the
[1:02:53] path forward this morning
[1:02:54] so that is all I can do
[1:02:56] amen we have to talk about the door
[1:02:59] opening the the throne and all that but
[1:03:02] he said go straight to the part four so
[1:03:05] I just want to obey the spirit
[1:03:07] Hallelujah so that is it come up Peter
[1:03:11] part four and uh I've just subtitled it
[1:03:14] worship of the elders
[1:03:17] so we are going to dwell more about the
[1:03:19] worship of the elders this morning I
[1:03:21] believe you love worshiping God
[1:03:24] amen and amen if you don't love
[1:03:26] worshiping God I don't know why you
[1:03:27] claim that you have the Holy Spirit
[1:03:30] yes sir because that is all the holy
[1:03:32] spirit makes us to do we worship God we
[1:03:35] worship God we worship God that is why
[1:03:37] alieners I wish that the brothers and
[1:03:39] sisters will stand here and they will
[1:03:40] sing and sing and sing and sing again
[1:03:44] Hallelujah the worship of the elders now
[1:03:49] beloved uh
[1:03:51] we want to go by this
[1:03:53] is that
[1:03:54] uh if God
[1:03:57] was calling John
[1:04:00] to come up
[1:04:02] we established last Thursday that it
[1:04:05] meant
[1:04:07] that his work on Earth was finished
[1:04:11] and for that matter
[1:04:13] his Spirit was no longer going to be on
[1:04:16] the side
[1:04:19] and John representing the bride
[1:04:22] was the only one that had the Holy
[1:04:24] Spirit
[1:04:27] that is why the moment the Rapture took
[1:04:28] place there wouldn't be any Holy Spirit
[1:04:30] on this side
[1:04:32] the holy spirit is here to operate in
[1:04:36] the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:39] it is because of you the holy spirit is
[1:04:41] here
[1:04:42] therefore if God take you from they said
[1:04:44] what will be the essence of the Holy
[1:04:46] Ghost again
[1:04:48] on the side
[1:04:49] so it got to a time God was calling the
[1:04:52] church the bride Jesus Christ was
[1:04:54] calling uh John come up
[1:04:57] and come and be with me here
[1:05:00] hallelujah it's just like a young man
[1:05:03] you know
[1:05:04] meeting a young lady
[1:05:07] and you know perhaps whatever they would
[1:05:09] say we we don't know
[1:05:12] the the loving word the love words that
[1:05:14] maybe he will tried later and then oh I
[1:05:17] love you and I do date and her dad well
[1:05:20] they can do all that
[1:05:23] who didn't know anything about it
[1:05:26] but there will come a tie
[1:05:28] it will no longer be just letter writing
[1:05:32] open out now we use foams
[1:05:35] it's easy to test
[1:05:38] you'll be sending you know just let you
[1:05:40] know where's just like that now how many
[1:05:42] of us write letters nobody write letters
[1:05:45] most of that when we passed we send
[1:05:48] through the you know waves
[1:05:51] and it will it will come to a time it
[1:05:54] will no longer be that but then the man
[1:05:56] the young man will make sure that you
[1:05:58] bring that lady to himself
[1:06:01] when everything is done according to
[1:06:03] marriage principle
[1:06:06] and that is where God also rich
[1:06:09] when he say that my wife can no longer
[1:06:12] be far away on this Earth whilst I'm
[1:06:14] over there
[1:06:15] so he was calling the Bride come up and
[1:06:18] come and be with me
[1:06:20] amen and amen but then he said that and
[1:06:23] I will show you things that are coming
[1:06:25] to be
[1:06:27] you see the the the wife must go to the
[1:06:30] husband
[1:06:31] to know exactly what that man is made up
[1:06:34] of
[1:06:36] Hallelujah
[1:06:38] you must live with that man or the lady
[1:06:41] must live the man must live with the
[1:06:43] lady also to know exactly what that
[1:06:46] person is made up of
[1:06:48] but we thank God he has sent the Holy
[1:06:52] Ghost
[1:06:54] to to to to bring everything that is
[1:06:57] within us out
[1:07:00] Hallelujah you see the point so now we
[1:07:03] are living with Christ
[1:07:05] but then it might manifest
[1:07:08] that their Rapture must take place
[1:07:11] there should be a manifestations of it
[1:07:14] so now he said come up to my Abode and
[1:07:18] I'm going to show you things that are
[1:07:19] going to be hereafter
[1:07:21] and John says that that's fine and out
[1:07:25] of the throne proceeded lightenings and
[1:07:28] thunderens and voices and there were
[1:07:30] seven lumps of the fire of fire burning
[1:07:33] Before the Throne which are the seven
[1:07:35] spirits of God
[1:07:38] lightenings
[1:07:40] thunderance
[1:07:41] I remember the prophet saying that it's
[1:07:43] because
[1:07:45] the Redemption work was over
[1:07:48] so if the Redemption work was over
[1:07:51] then that Mercy Seat
[1:07:55] tend to be judgment seat
[1:07:58] that is why you hear that panderings
[1:08:02] hallelujah voices enlightenings
[1:08:05] to do what to scare
[1:08:08] but then the bride was safe
[1:08:11] in the hands of God
[1:08:14] and you see the Salvation Spirit okay
[1:08:17] burning the seven lamps of of of fire
[1:08:20] burning Before the Throne which are the
[1:08:23] seventh spirit of God
[1:08:25] there is a place that he made us to
[1:08:27] understand
[1:08:28] he said this Savage spirit
[1:08:30] they are just the character of God
[1:08:34] you know all this this Sovereign Spirit
[1:08:37] you see they represent the colors the
[1:08:39] colors of God
[1:08:41] it depicts you know the motive
[1:08:45] okay it brings God's purity
[1:08:47] among his people it shows what God is
[1:08:51] made up of
[1:08:52] the design
[1:08:54] the way and manner he operates
[1:08:57] it's embodied in this service spirit all
[1:09:01] this the seven fire that was burning
[1:09:03] around all over the throne
[1:09:05] praise be the name of our God
[1:09:08] Hallelujah
[1:09:10] verses he said and Before the Throne
[1:09:12] there was a sea of glass
[1:09:15] like unto Crystal
[1:09:17] and the mess of the throne and run above
[1:09:20] the throne where four beasts full of
[1:09:22] eyes before and behind
[1:09:28] Hallelujah
[1:09:30] you catch it now
[1:09:32] now
[1:09:33] in the old Tabernacle
[1:09:36] this sea
[1:09:39] of glass like onto Crystal John
[1:09:43] he said I saw
[1:09:45] in the order
[1:09:47] we saw it there
[1:09:49] but then it was known as sea of brass
[1:09:53] that was the water that they used to
[1:09:56] wash the sacrifice
[1:09:58] because you cannot take the sacrifice
[1:10:01] straight away to the altar to be you
[1:10:03] know killed
[1:10:05] they have to ascertain they have to
[1:10:07] assess
[1:10:08] and prove that that sacrifice is
[1:10:12] qualified
[1:10:13] you couldn't take any any animal with a
[1:10:17] runny nose excuse me uh perhaps one year
[1:10:21] is off and maybe the leg is not even no
[1:10:25] you don't present that to God
[1:10:28] so they will assess the sacrifice now
[1:10:32] when it is proven in accepted
[1:10:34] then they wash it in the sea of brass
[1:10:38] they wash it before it will be presented
[1:10:41] on the on the on the on the altar
[1:10:44] and the same applies to us as Sons and
[1:10:47] Daughters of God
[1:10:49] one way we are presented as sacrifices
[1:10:53] and we are being assessed Day by Day and
[1:10:56] Night by night we are being assessed by
[1:10:58] the Holy Spirit
[1:11:01] the word of God is what is changing us
[1:11:05] every day the world come to do something
[1:11:07] in our lives
[1:11:10] other an elderly brother back home in
[1:11:12] the church one time he came as a pastor
[1:11:14] any day I come to the church and I I
[1:11:16] preach and the word don't touch my body
[1:11:18] I don't feel well I said brother God
[1:11:21] bless you continue to Avail yourself
[1:11:24] because God's word come for a purpose
[1:11:27] and the purpose is to straighten up his
[1:11:28] sons and his daughters
[1:11:31] and why that it is being experienced in
[1:11:33] US it means we are being washed
[1:11:37] Hallelujah we are being watched brother
[1:11:39] we must be washed
[1:11:41] by the word of God
[1:11:45] Hallelujah there are seven times here
[1:11:48] you see some beloved Brethren when they
[1:11:50] are at fault and they need to be rebuked
[1:11:52] and then when they are rebued they
[1:11:54] become so I mean
[1:11:57] they want they don't want to rebuke
[1:12:00] no if you don't want rebuke can you call
[1:12:02] yourself a child of God
[1:12:06] if you don't want to be corrected can
[1:12:08] you call yourself a son of God
[1:12:11] because the bible say that day that I
[1:12:14] love I rebuke and I trust you
[1:12:17] be Zealand therefore and repent
[1:12:20] so we need to be washed by the word
[1:12:24] I don't care how hard my Minister my
[1:12:27] pastor will preach to me so long as the
[1:12:29] preaching is affecting my life I'll open
[1:12:31] up myself let the word of God come into
[1:12:33] me and let it Wash Me Up
[1:12:39] I remember when I was there
[1:12:41] a school boy yeah age in the primary
[1:12:45] school far away then
[1:12:47] you know
[1:12:51] our character
[1:12:54] sometimes as a boy you go and play
[1:12:57] soccer
[1:12:59] I'm not talking about football
[1:13:03] because I know if I say football I'm
[1:13:04] going to confuse you
[1:13:07] play soccer
[1:13:09] and we do everything
[1:13:11] in the sand
[1:13:13] and perhaps you go home without buffing
[1:13:17] and then go and sleep
[1:13:21] it was not quite long
[1:13:23] then we develop some rashes on our skin
[1:13:29] it was very itchy
[1:13:31] it's on rushes came all over the body
[1:13:35] and but then I was not living with my
[1:13:37] mom
[1:13:38] my mom was far away somewhere in the
[1:13:40] village
[1:13:42] and then when we vacate we go and be
[1:13:46] with with them
[1:13:48] and so that time when I I got to the
[1:13:51] village and my mom saw me and you saw
[1:13:54] she saw there right she said what
[1:13:58] went from you what happened to your body
[1:14:02] I couldn't I couldn't tell her that well
[1:14:05] I refused to Bath some time that is why
[1:14:07] I didn't say that
[1:14:11] but because
[1:14:13] she she's an elderly
[1:14:15] she got to know that that was the the
[1:14:17] the the reason why those flashes Has
[1:14:20] Come On Me
[1:14:22] and my mother
[1:14:24] went to the market the following day
[1:14:27] bought an antiseptic soap
[1:14:30] and
[1:14:31] you know we use something we call sponge
[1:14:33] I don't know whether you know of it
[1:14:36] there is some rauli can tell you what
[1:14:39] it's about
[1:14:42] okay
[1:14:43] that's what we used to Bath
[1:14:46] and there are other that they are very
[1:14:49] rough
[1:14:51] some are smooth some are rough
[1:14:53] my mother went in for the rough one
[1:14:58] oh my
[1:15:01] God and you put fire I'm sorry water on
[1:15:03] fire
[1:15:06] well I don't remember the the
[1:15:08] temperature
[1:15:10] but I realized that it was boiling
[1:15:13] then she pointed the bucket
[1:15:16] and call me hey come here
[1:15:19] and my mother started to buff me oh
[1:15:25] no mercy
[1:15:28] she wasn't Wicked
[1:15:30] she was trying to make sure that those
[1:15:32] pain rashes go out
[1:15:36] so she started scrubbing and I was
[1:15:38] shouting
[1:15:40] I mean you can imagine the way and man
[1:15:42] or my body tend to be blood
[1:15:45] because the surface all peeled up
[1:15:50] and then she poured the hot water on me
[1:15:52] oh
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:55] I couldn't move
[1:15:58] I was just screaming just like that
[1:16:00] and then after
[1:16:03] she applied the same antisective soap
[1:16:06] into those things but I tell you within
[1:16:09] three days
[1:16:11] it was gone
[1:16:13] within three days it was it vanished
[1:16:16] from my body
[1:16:18] and brother don't you think that if we
[1:16:21] are using the word of God also in the
[1:16:23] same way
[1:16:25] can you imagine the Purity and Holiness
[1:16:28] and righteousness that will be in the
[1:16:31] church
[1:16:32] Hallelujah because brother we need to be
[1:16:35] watched by the word of God
[1:16:38] we need to be washed by the
[1:16:39] righteousness of God
[1:16:41] Hallelujah read the scripture quickly
[1:16:43] before I continue Hebrew chapter 10
[1:16:48] .
[1:16:51] Hebrews chapter 10 and I think verse 22.
[1:16:58] he says let us draw near
[1:17:01] with a True Heart in full Assurance of
[1:17:04] faith
[1:17:05] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:17:09] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:17:13] pure water
[1:17:15] and a pure water here beloved
[1:17:18] represent the word of God
[1:17:21] that is the only way whereby we can't be
[1:17:24] washed and be washed well
[1:17:26] so right now I am happy brother
[1:17:30] that we are Washed by the word
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:35] When You Believe
[1:17:39] you were baptized
[1:17:41] it's a sign of washing
[1:17:44] watching the sacrifice before it's
[1:17:45] presented
[1:17:48] and the house of God
[1:17:50] we do worship
[1:17:53] we wash our bodies we wash our minds we
[1:17:57] wash our paintings we wash our attitudes
[1:18:00] we want everything that we do we wash it
[1:18:02] so that we can present it well
[1:18:05] before our creator
[1:18:07] amen and amen
[1:18:10] he continued to say that wrong about the
[1:18:14] throne wherefore be is full of eyes
[1:18:16] before and behind
[1:18:20] there were four beasts
[1:18:22] someone who said they are living
[1:18:24] creatures and all that
[1:18:26] what were they doing
[1:18:29] the prophet made us to understand that
[1:18:31] they guide the Throne of God
[1:18:33] they were thrown guards
[1:18:36] but they were very smart
[1:18:40] their character was their power
[1:18:43] Hallelujah
[1:18:45] and they have eyes before and behind
[1:18:48] so in this sense there is no way that
[1:18:52] they go backward
[1:18:55] because they are first year they were
[1:18:57] they have eyes here and they have eyes
[1:18:59] there so when you're going this way they
[1:19:01] go forward
[1:19:04] Hallelujah yes sir
[1:19:07] and when you're coming this way they
[1:19:08] come forward
[1:19:11] that is wonderful works of God
[1:19:14] you understand that you know that is why
[1:19:17] the prophets
[1:19:19] whom God used
[1:19:21] they have those instincts in them
[1:19:24] all the prophets of God the alphasis
[1:19:26] here I'm sorry they have eyes here and
[1:19:28] they have ICA
[1:19:30] Hallelujah
[1:19:32] you said brother prove it I'm going to
[1:19:34] prove it to you right now
[1:19:37] when God created Garden of Eden
[1:19:40] Moses was not there
[1:19:43] but Moses came
[1:19:45] and told us the way a man of the
[1:19:48] creation went by
[1:19:50] Hallelujah
[1:19:53] the time that he told Noah to build the
[1:19:56] ark Moses was not there
[1:19:58] but Moses came and told us vividly
[1:20:01] everything that transpired at that time
[1:20:07] he was a man
[1:20:10] but he was a prophet
[1:20:13] he got ice here and he had iced here
[1:20:17] Hallelujah one day he called the
[1:20:20] Israelites and told them your lord your
[1:20:24] God will raise a prophet light unto me
[1:20:28] and he was talking about Jesus Christ
[1:20:31] long years before Christ was born why
[1:20:35] did he able to see or why was he able to
[1:20:38] see the future because he had eyes here
[1:20:41] to see
[1:20:44] Hallelujah
[1:20:47] then we have someone also
[1:20:50] by name William Marion Brown
[1:20:54] well I don't know how you take him to be
[1:20:57] but I take him to be a prophet of God
[1:21:01] in this end time of course in this
[1:21:03] audition
[1:21:07] he was the one that first made me to
[1:21:09] know that
[1:21:10] job leave
[1:21:12] so many years before Abraham was born
[1:21:17] before then I always open the Bible and
[1:21:21] I read job in the middle of the Bible
[1:21:25] with that Creation in my mind that even
[1:21:28] Moses and the rest lived before him
[1:21:32] but I have that mind that prophet of God
[1:21:35] to tell me that job live so many years
[1:21:37] before even Abraham was born
[1:21:40] what was that
[1:21:42] he had eyes behind him
[1:21:46] that can go to the Past
[1:21:50] to bring peace that happened over there
[1:21:53] into us
[1:21:56] one day also he got up
[1:21:59] and he says that
[1:22:01] I see Mussolini
[1:22:04] taking over Ethiopia
[1:22:06] and who fall on his own steps
[1:22:09] it happened
[1:22:11] he said
[1:22:12] I see somebody called Adolf Hitler
[1:22:15] he'll come to a mysterious end
[1:22:17] it happened
[1:22:19] he's saying that I see the morals of
[1:22:22] women going low and low and lower
[1:22:27] it has happened
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:33] and communism coming together
[1:22:36] and communism will swallow them up
[1:22:40] Hallelujah
[1:22:42] he said I see an automobile without a
[1:22:45] steering wheel
[1:22:47] he did he said all these things
[1:22:50] hadn't they come to pass
[1:22:52] they are all here with us
[1:22:55] we have a testimony
[1:22:57] that this man indeed had eyes before him
[1:23:00] and eyes behind him
[1:23:04] and these were the qualities
[1:23:07] of those four beasts
[1:23:09] who were at the throne
[1:23:13] the prophet that they were protecting
[1:23:15] the bride
[1:23:17] amen now let me read after seven quickly
[1:23:20] again
[1:23:21] he says and the first Beast was like a
[1:23:24] lion
[1:23:25] and the second beast like a calf and the
[1:23:27] ten bees heard the face as a man and the
[1:23:30] fourth Beast was like a flying eagle
[1:23:34] amen now when you go back to the Old
[1:23:36] Testament
[1:23:38] you see that it came to a Time
[1:23:41] God divided the tribes into four
[1:23:46] amen amen one was calling the army
[1:23:49] he divided them into four groups today
[1:23:53] we call them first Battalion second
[1:23:54] Battalion Ted Battalion and fourth
[1:23:57] battalion
[1:23:59] and uh in all those four groups they had
[1:24:03] leaders
[1:24:05] in the certain group Ruby was the leader
[1:24:09] and I think
[1:24:11] they had a sign
[1:24:14] was the first uh an ox
[1:24:18] in the East was Judah
[1:24:20] okay and Judah also had an inside of a
[1:24:24] lion
[1:24:26] in the in the West Was Ephraim and they
[1:24:29] also have a sign of a face of a man
[1:24:33] then in the north was done
[1:24:36] who has an eagle as they are inside
[1:24:40] now but when we come to the Book of
[1:24:41] Revelation
[1:24:43] John say that he saw these characters
[1:24:45] around the throne
[1:24:47] what were they doing there
[1:24:49] now we go back and see exactly what the
[1:24:53] prophet put it
[1:24:54] he said these beasts were there to
[1:24:57] protect the bride
[1:25:00] Hallelujah because without this
[1:25:03] character without this Powers the
[1:25:06] Antichrist could do anything
[1:25:08] but he says that the elect cannot be
[1:25:10] deceived so at all times Gods make a
[1:25:13] provision to guide and protect his
[1:25:16] people
[1:25:21] and the prophet was talking about
[1:25:24] um a horse rider you know a horse rider
[1:25:28] with a with a white collar came down and
[1:25:31] even before we didn't know that it was
[1:25:33] the same man that was changing himself
[1:25:35] like that
[1:25:37] The Same Spirit
[1:25:39] was changing colors only to deceive
[1:25:43] but anytime you bring a color then one
[1:25:45] of these beasts will call John John come
[1:25:47] and see
[1:25:49] and then John will see and John will be
[1:25:52] ready for any eventualities
[1:25:56] Hallelujah he came with white then he
[1:25:59] came with the red then he came with
[1:26:01] black then he went back and mixed all
[1:26:04] the colors you know anytime
[1:26:08] the character will prevail
[1:26:11] that same power of God brings anointing
[1:26:15] also upon the Believers
[1:26:19] so while he was doing that in the
[1:26:21] beginning is
[1:26:23] with a white color
[1:26:25] Paul was using the spirit of the Lion
[1:26:29] to conquer the Antichrist
[1:26:32] and it follows suit
[1:26:34] when it came to the time of Arena's
[1:26:37] mountain and Coloma we saw what happened
[1:26:40] over there
[1:26:42] the ox
[1:26:44] when it came to Martin Luther and the
[1:26:46] wesleys we know that God was using the
[1:26:49] spirit of man
[1:26:51] to conquer the Antichrist
[1:26:54] and then when I got realized that any
[1:26:57] way he tends he is known by the spirit
[1:27:00] of God that he go trying to come and
[1:27:03] deceive so he wants to mix all the
[1:27:05] colors now he came with a pale color
[1:27:08] you cannot determine what it is
[1:27:11] but little did he know
[1:27:14] that it was the same time God was using
[1:27:16] the flying eagle
[1:27:19] Hallelujah whether you can never deceive
[1:27:21] the eagle
[1:27:23] because the eagle have got perfect eyes
[1:27:26] that can see as far as it goes
[1:27:29] Hallelujah so he realized that there was
[1:27:34] no way he could deceive the bride
[1:27:37] Hallelujah so that was a purpose where
[1:27:39] God placed this four living creatures
[1:27:43] amen and amen now verse 8 here he says
[1:27:47] and the four beasts had each of them say
[1:27:50] swings about him
[1:27:52] and they were full of eyes within and
[1:27:55] they arrest not day and night saying
[1:27:57] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which
[1:28:00] was
[1:28:01] Ernest n is to come
[1:28:04] Hallelujah and these are the power that
[1:28:06] guy you see anytime
[1:28:09] anytime
[1:28:11] the inner serving Church ages
[1:28:13] these four bees they have their Ministry
[1:28:16] fulfilled
[1:28:19] every Church age through the seven
[1:28:21] churches
[1:28:22] when God was using the spirit of this
[1:28:26] Beast
[1:28:28] you'll find out it was a perfect
[1:28:31] wealth of salvation
[1:28:34] a very perfect book of salvation
[1:28:37] so then when this work is manifested
[1:28:42] it brings glory to God in heaven
[1:28:45] and the angels themselves could not sit
[1:28:48] still
[1:28:49] but they begin to praise and worship God
[1:28:53] because the ministry of these four bees
[1:28:56] have been made manifest among the sons
[1:28:58] and daughters of God on Earth
[1:29:01] Hallelujah
[1:29:03] so there's no holy holy holy Lord God
[1:29:05] Almighty
[1:29:06] it was a time for worship
[1:29:09] so the 24 Elders were worshiping God why
[1:29:12] were they worshiping God then
[1:29:14] why they removed their crowns and they
[1:29:17] fell at his feet and praise him and
[1:29:19] worship him
[1:29:21] it was because
[1:29:23] you have been saved
[1:29:25] [Applause]
[1:29:27] that is all
[1:29:29] that is all
[1:29:31] it was because you have been saved
[1:29:35] let us forget about the things that is
[1:29:38] happening
[1:29:39] let us forget about it
[1:29:42] but let us look to the things that God
[1:29:44] have prepared for us
[1:29:46] we cannot stop anything from happening
[1:29:50] the only thing we can do is to make sure
[1:29:53] that we are in the will of God
[1:29:56] that is all
[1:30:02] sometimes it is pathetic brother sister
[1:30:05] to see so many natural disaster here and
[1:30:08] there
[1:30:08] people suffer
[1:30:11] and we feel
[1:30:13] because we are human
[1:30:17] we feel
[1:30:19] hurricane this hurricane that hurricane
[1:30:22] this hurricane not
[1:30:25] he put burden upon us because we have to
[1:30:28] pray for the loved ones we have to pray
[1:30:30] for the children of God to be protected
[1:30:35] but many attacks we forgot that is the
[1:30:38] same Human Nature
[1:30:40] human character human behavior human
[1:30:42] disrespect to God's word
[1:30:45] that causes all these things
[1:30:50] when man get to a place that they don't
[1:30:52] they don't have no respect for God again
[1:30:54] what do you think will happen
[1:31:00] Hallelujah
[1:31:01] when when when when the world reach a
[1:31:04] place he said put God aside
[1:31:07] let us stop our freedom
[1:31:10] you can have your freedom now but when
[1:31:12] you get to Hell there you see that you
[1:31:13] don't have any freedom there
[1:31:18] so their behavior and the attitude of
[1:31:21] human powers God
[1:31:22] make all these things to be
[1:31:25] but then
[1:31:27] it brings bedding
[1:31:29] we pray for one another oh Lord protect
[1:31:32] your sons and daughters over there
[1:31:36] amen
[1:31:38] and certainly we know God is capable
[1:31:42] of protecting his sons and daughters
[1:31:47] Hallelujah
[1:31:49] so the angels have nothing to do but to
[1:31:52] worship God
[1:31:53] because they realize that the ministry
[1:31:56] of these four beasts has completely
[1:31:58] manifested among his people
[1:32:03] when the believer stands for the word of
[1:32:05] God
[1:32:06] there is only one sound perhaps right
[1:32:09] now you don't have ear to hear
[1:32:12] but it sounds only
[1:32:17] anything that you do
[1:32:20] to honor God's word there is a sound of
[1:32:23] Holiness around you
[1:32:25] you don't have ears to hear right now
[1:32:27] but the angels in heaven they hear it
[1:32:30] that is why they worship God
[1:32:34] Hallelujah
[1:32:40] that's nine
[1:32:42] and when those beasts give glory and
[1:32:44] honor and thanks to him that sat on the
[1:32:46] throne who live at forever and ever
[1:32:49] the 420 Elders fall down before him that
[1:32:53] sat on the throne and worship him that
[1:32:55] live there forever and ever and cause
[1:32:57] their crowns Before the Throne saying
[1:32:59] Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory
[1:33:03] and honor and power for thou has created
[1:33:06] all things and for thy pleasure they are
[1:33:09] and were created
[1:33:12] oh Hallelujah that was so I was feeling
[1:33:15] well when that building was singing
[1:33:18] foreign
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:27] oh brother sister this is the time of
[1:33:30] worship
[1:33:32] Hallelujah this is the time of worship
[1:33:36] amen because everything has been done
[1:33:38] already

[1:33:45] here from America come up with that from
[1:33:46] Africa from Europe come up from all over
[1:33:49] the world

[1:36:01] for this is the time of worship
[1:36:04] Hallelujah
[1:36:06] if those elders
[1:36:09] if those elders were worshiping God
[1:36:13] if God's Elders cast out their crowns
[1:36:15] and bow down and say holy holy Lord God

[1:36:49] Hallelujah yes you cannot handle your
[1:36:52] problem you cannot solve your problem

[1:37:03] have not solved your problem yet
[1:37:05] and because of that you don't have the
[1:37:07] Liberty to worship God
[1:37:10] it's a setback
[1:37:13] Hallelujah
[1:37:15] forget about it
[1:37:17] and think about the worship of God
[1:37:19] [Applause]
[1:37:22] Hallelujah God will take care of those
[1:37:26] things
[1:37:27] now what you require from you is to
[1:37:29] worship Him
[1:37:32] amen oh praise be to the name of our God
[1:37:37] I am putting for Gabriel instruction to
[1:37:39] Daniel
[1:37:42] he says
[1:37:44] the first to the 14th verse of the fifth
[1:37:47] chapter of Revelation
[1:37:49] reveals the time for the lamb to be
[1:37:52] worshiped
[1:37:53] both in heaven and in Earth
[1:37:57] so the Angels should not only worship
[1:38:00] God but we who are here right now also
[1:38:02] must worship God
[1:38:04] that is it
[1:38:06] Hallelujah
[1:38:08] he says
[1:38:10] the seven seal book
[1:38:12] the world
[1:38:14] the kiss my redeemer
[1:38:16] oh my and from the eight verse through
[1:38:19] the 14th Angel worship Him
[1:38:22] Elders worshiped him
[1:38:24] living creatures worshiped him
[1:38:27] and John worship Him
[1:38:29] so much till he said
[1:38:32] every creature in heaven
[1:38:34] and in Earth underneath the Earth heard
[1:38:38] me saying blessed Glory power wisdom
[1:38:41] might be to the lamb
[1:38:45] he said that worship time for the king
[1:38:49] oh praise be in the name of our God
[1:38:52] the worship time for the John was
[1:38:55] praising God
[1:38:57] and there was only one reason why he
[1:39:00] praised God
[1:39:01] the prophet says that that book that was
[1:39:05] in the hand of the one that started the
[1:39:07] truth with seven things
[1:39:09] when John saw it
[1:39:11] he realized that
[1:39:13] there is something in that book for him
[1:39:16] but nobody was ready to open that book
[1:39:19] nobody was worthy to even take that book
[1:39:22] so don't have to cry
[1:39:24] oh you can imagine that you are losing
[1:39:27] your precious something Ma you begin to
[1:39:30] cry you get the shirt tears because of
[1:39:33] your love for it
[1:39:34] he cried and cried and cried
[1:39:36] until one of the others said that John
[1:39:39] why are you crying don't cry stop crying
[1:39:43] but I know you are crying because of
[1:39:45] that book
[1:39:47] by the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:39:49] prevailed
[1:39:51] and he is coming to take the book
[1:39:53] and open the skills thereof
[1:39:56] so John came to look
[1:39:58] to see a lion he saw a land
[1:40:03] Hallelujah
[1:40:05] full of blood
[1:40:08] yeah and that was the lamb that was
[1:40:11] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:40:14] for our freedom for our Redemption
[1:40:17] Hallelujah he was full of blood why was
[1:40:21] he full of blood because you could not
[1:40:23] take that book you cannot handle that
[1:40:25] book without blood in your hand
[1:40:30] the sin that happened in the Garden of
[1:40:32] Eden
[1:40:34] it was not the sin of Apple
[1:40:40] it was not blueberries
[1:40:45] neither was it blackberries
[1:40:49] it was not Peach
[1:40:52] it was sin of blood
[1:40:57] amen when a man and a woman meet It
[1:41:00] produced blood
[1:41:02] that was the sin that occurred in the
[1:41:05] garden
[1:41:06] so when God came down to see that
[1:41:08] thought
[1:41:10] he didn't use apple
[1:41:12] he didn't use peaches
[1:41:14] he didn't use blueberry that I lacked so
[1:41:16] much
[1:41:18] Hallelujah
[1:41:20] but you use blood of a lamp
[1:41:26] to cover it
[1:41:28] it couldn't take it away
[1:41:30] to cover it but then he needed the the
[1:41:34] righteous blood but Brown said that he
[1:41:37] needed the god what do you call it he
[1:41:39] said he need the blood of God
[1:41:42] amen that is what he was
[1:41:46] the lamb of God
[1:41:49] that was laid before the foundation of
[1:41:51] the world
[1:41:52] so the other called attention of John
[1:41:55] that John stop crying and look behind
[1:41:58] you
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:02] now that Lamb with blood has prevailed
[1:42:09] to the throne
[1:42:12] and with the blood in his hand
[1:42:15] he took the book
[1:42:18] Hallelujah
[1:42:19] he took the book
[1:42:21] and he opened the seal
[1:42:23] he opened a fair seal
[1:42:26] he opened the second seal
[1:42:28] he opened the 10th seal
[1:42:31] he opened the fourth seal
[1:42:33] he opened the fifth seal
[1:42:35] and then you opened the seventh seal
[1:42:39] oh my then all of a sudden John started
[1:42:42] to shout
[1:42:44] Hallelujah
[1:42:47] [Applause]
[1:42:50] the bible say that he shouted
[1:42:53] until the things in heaven
[1:42:57] the things on this Earth
[1:42:59] and at this beneath the Earth had done
[1:43:03] Shout
[1:43:04] what was he doing he was worshiping God
[1:43:08] he was praising God hallelujah because
[1:43:11] he have seen his name in the Redemption
[1:43:13] book
[1:43:15] Hallelujah
[1:43:16] God will contain your name
[1:43:19] you have your names in that book
[1:43:22] Hallelujah that is why nothing can
[1:43:25] deceive you
[1:43:26] oh brother I said nothing can deceive
[1:43:30] you
[1:43:31] you cannot even deceive yourself
[1:43:33] because your names are in the book
[1:43:38] oh brother my brother
[1:43:40] Hallelujah
[1:43:42] if you have your name in that book
[1:43:44] Rasta Shield
[1:43:46] that it is finished
[1:43:49] amen now when you if you come to the
[1:43:52] Book of Revelation uh let me read
[1:43:54] quickly also to compare notes
[1:43:57] do I have time
[1:44:01] chapter 20.
[1:44:03] and uh there's this number
[1:44:06] 12 perhaps
[1:44:09] let me see
[1:44:13] okay let me start from verse 11 and I
[1:44:16] saw a great white throne
[1:44:18] and if that sat on it from whom from
[1:44:21] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[1:44:23] away
[1:44:24] and there was found so place I'm sorry
[1:44:27] and there was found no place for them
[1:44:30] and I saw the dead small and great
[1:44:34] son before God
[1:44:36] and the books were open
[1:44:39] and another book was open
[1:44:41] which is The Book of Life
[1:44:43] Hallelujah
[1:44:44] their books were opened and another book
[1:44:48] was open
[1:44:50] that book singular book
[1:44:52] well that book of redemption
[1:44:55] and you have your name in that book I
[1:44:57] have my name in that book
[1:44:59] John saw his name in that book
[1:45:02] but the other books the Bible says that
[1:45:06] the world were judged from the books
[1:45:11] Hallelujah
[1:45:13] so therefore it was not one book but
[1:45:16] many books yeah
[1:45:18] the world reject from those books
[1:45:22] by you and I
[1:45:24] we are judged from this book
[1:45:28] The Book of Life
[1:45:31] the Bible said that judgment must first
[1:45:33] begin in the house of God
[1:45:35] and that is exactly what we are doing
[1:45:37] right now
[1:45:39] amen what are the books
[1:45:46] if you go if you go to the prisons right
[1:45:48] now
[1:45:49] there are so many inmates over there
[1:45:51] that
[1:45:52] with various different kinds of of uh uh
[1:45:58] what we call it crimes
[1:46:01] but they are all over there
[1:46:04] some are seven one year
[1:46:08] some are 73 years
[1:46:11] some are even seven three months
[1:46:13] some life imprisonment
[1:46:16] some have been sentenced to death
[1:46:19] but when you come to look to their to
[1:46:22] their crimes they differ
[1:46:25] you understand
[1:46:28] those who went for robbery
[1:46:31] those who needed people and so many
[1:46:34] kinds of atrocities
[1:46:37] so when the Bible is talking about the
[1:46:39] books
[1:46:40] perhaps the book of fornicators
[1:46:44] the book of adulteress and adulteresses
[1:46:48] the book of drunkards
[1:46:50] the book of Madras
[1:46:52] the book of witchcraft
[1:46:55] the book of everything that the Bible
[1:46:57] speaks against
[1:46:59] there are many
[1:47:01] you say the unbelievers were judged out
[1:47:03] of those books
[1:47:05] but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:47:08] because you have your name in the book
[1:47:11] of righteousness
[1:47:12] Hallelujah your name is only mentioned
[1:47:15] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:47:20] so when John saw the name
[1:47:23] in it the bride or the wife of Jesus
[1:47:26] Christ's name in that book he shouted
[1:47:28] for joy
[1:47:30] and you are the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:47:33] Hallelujah so it is time for you to
[1:47:36] worship God right now
[1:47:38] this is the worship time
[1:47:39] [Applause]
[1:47:43] this is the time of worship
[1:47:46] oh brother
[1:47:48] Once Upon a Time
[1:47:49] we didn't have enough to mention the
[1:47:51] name of God
[1:47:53] Hallelujah we didn't have time to
[1:47:55] mention the name of God because of
[1:47:57] perhaps our character and because of the
[1:48:00] thing that we did and we were condemned
[1:48:02] you know there was nothing
[1:48:04] oh my then he come back
[1:48:06] he said you are my son
[1:48:09] come out I'm going to treat you like The
[1:48:10] Prodigal Son
[1:48:11] you remain at my son only you became
[1:48:14] Steve naked come and take your position
[1:48:17] now come and go to wash you and the Lord
[1:48:20] wash us I'm going to rob you and the
[1:48:23] Lord give us a garment he took our old
[1:48:26] chartered government and threw it away
[1:48:27] and he gave us a rub of righteousness
[1:48:30] today we must praise our God we must
[1:48:32] worship our God
[1:48:37] when I get happy like this I cannot keep
[1:48:40] quiet
[1:48:42] I sing and I shout
[1:48:45] and I know the devil don't like it but I
[1:48:48] don't want the devil to like it
[1:48:50] yeah
[1:48:53] oh Hallelujah
[1:48:55] amen
[1:48:57] can I continue a little
[1:49:00] and they sung a new song
[1:49:03] saying Thou Art Worthy
[1:49:06] listen what a worship this was
[1:49:09] the elders
[1:49:11] the Beast
[1:49:13] everything fell right before him
[1:49:17] like that
[1:49:18] when he met his complete plan
[1:49:22] it is time of worship now
[1:49:27] brother sister
[1:49:30] the plan of God
[1:49:33] towards salvation
[1:49:35] is complete
[1:49:40] it's complete
[1:49:42] hallelujah it's complete
[1:49:45] God has finished his work
[1:49:49] and that is why he's calling us right
[1:49:51] now to come up now
[1:49:53] we don't no longer believe into this
[1:49:55] system
[1:49:56] no
[1:49:58] problems here and there
[1:50:00] is no hope in the world
[1:50:04] we are living the worldly politics to
[1:50:06] the world
[1:50:08] we are living unbelief to the world
[1:50:11] we are living with anything that stands
[1:50:14] against God in this world and we are
[1:50:16] going
[1:50:18] it is time of worship
[1:50:20] that prophets say that the complete man
[1:50:23] of God is finished
[1:50:25] it is worship time
[1:50:27] so you see a new head and he sang a new
[1:50:29] song saying to take the book and to open
[1:50:33] the sales thereof but that was slain and
[1:50:36] has redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[1:50:40] of every kindred
[1:50:42] thongs the people the Nations Hallelujah
[1:50:46] the green the white the black the yellow
[1:50:48] the brown all over the countries
[1:50:51] he has redeemed his people
[1:50:53] Hallelujah and thou has made us unto our
[1:50:57] God Kings and Priests
[1:50:59] and we shall reign on the Earth
[1:51:03] and that is the billion when we come

[1:51:08] this world

[1:51:22] as we are saying the other day that look
[1:51:24] at what the Jews are doing right now on
[1:51:26] the Temple mount
[1:51:28] it presupposes that something is going
[1:51:30] to happen very soon
[1:51:32] amen

[1:51:35] we know that Abomination that make it
[1:51:37] desolate standing in the Holy place it
[1:51:39] must go away
[1:51:42] and those two Prophets
[1:51:43] Moses and Elijah must appear to the Jews
[1:51:49] to preach the seals
[1:51:53] Hallelujah
[1:51:55] the message that revealed Jesus Christ
[1:51:57] to them that is what they are going to
[1:51:58] present

[2:20:53] invitation
[2:20:54] to every heart and to every life
[2:20:57] if you don't know that Joy that's from
[2:21:00] within
[2:21:01] that same God his presence that has come
[2:21:05] here
[2:21:06] to wash and to refresh and to deal with
[2:21:09] hearts and lives that same God he
[2:21:12] doesn't play with emotions but he comes
[2:21:15] yes to make known that he is the god of
[2:21:18] his Covenant
[2:21:20] amen and his desire is that if you don't
[2:21:23] have that Joy within and you sense that
[2:21:25] tug you sense that presence this is the
[2:21:28] very presence of God the very one you
[2:21:31] don't have to be afraid you can enter
[2:21:33] right in and say Lord I'm coming Lord
[2:21:35] yes I I want to come home Lord Jesus
[2:21:38] there's something about it that
[2:21:40] resonates in My Heart Lord God with you
[2:21:43] that presence Lord that's real he's the
[2:21:46] Living God
[2:21:49] I tell you I think the way that God
[2:21:53] brought all these things and I listened
[2:21:56] to that last little part there
[2:21:57] everything is just so rich but did you
[2:22:00] catch those little things how
[2:22:03] to me how that the prophet is pointing
[2:22:05] those things out
[2:22:06] when he says I praise you for my friends
[2:22:09] that's right
[2:22:11] Hallelujah
[2:22:16] you know he's talking about his brothers
[2:22:18] and sisters that's right that's what
[2:22:20] he's talking about God I praise you for
[2:22:22] that because to know that it is God
[2:22:25] that working and giving us brothers and
[2:22:28] sisters of Life precious Faith to
[2:22:30] fellowship with to be encouraged with
[2:22:33] Hallelujah
[2:22:34] I'll tell you brother and sister I know
[2:22:36] that when the the time here that struck
[2:22:38] our our family and there's been many
[2:22:40] others it's went on before this before
[2:22:41] we ever experienced it in this degree
[2:22:43] but I know this that Sunday after God
[2:22:47] had given me strength to stand here
[2:22:49] and to speak to you
[2:22:51] that Sunday and then as I was out there
[2:22:54] I just wanted to come out there and then
[2:22:56] to see the different brothers and
[2:22:57] sisters different ones making their way
[2:22:59] you know what I was receiving strength
[2:23:02] from my friends that's right amen

[2:23:25] them and motivating them to minister to
[2:23:28] me within this time

[2:23:54] no longer to dwell from that condition
[2:23:58] I have come to loosen you and to set you
[2:24:01] free
[2:24:02] so the real message of Calvary is is you
[2:24:05] are free you must accept the liberty and
[2:24:08] throw down all of those instruments of
[2:24:11] the world and walk in his Liberty amen
[2:24:13] because he has given us the authority to
