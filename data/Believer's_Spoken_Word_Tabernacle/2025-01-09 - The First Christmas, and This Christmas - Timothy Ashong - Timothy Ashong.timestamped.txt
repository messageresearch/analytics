[38:58] support them tomorrow evening from 5:00
[39:01] to 7:00 and the family uh will be
[39:03] gathered there uh also I wanted to
[39:06] mention to you and
[39:10] um
[39:11] um regarding I've sent I sent out
[39:14] different texts last week um because
[39:17] I've put
[39:18] together um uh a setup on
[39:23] telegram so that we can get out
[39:25] announcements and prayer requests and
[39:27] I've mentioned to I sent out to
[39:29] different ones and some of you really
[39:30] help me brother Drake you were pushing
[39:32] it all around uh you know and so we were
[39:35] just uh different ones getting everybody
[39:38] on board and the the purpose of that is
[39:41] with announcements and prayer requests
[39:43] where those can be pushed out to you and
[39:46] it's set up so that you don't have 50 60
[39:51] 70 responses of hand emojis thumbs up
[39:54] and so forth and that's because every
[39:57] one of us have enough text threads uh
[40:00] I've got I've got threads that I have to
[40:02] absolutely turn off at night because I'm
[40:05] connected with Brothers clear over
[40:06] around the world and all of a sudden I'd
[40:08] get at 2:30 in the morning this praying
[40:10] brother and you and it's not even it's
[40:12] for a different need from somebody over
[40:14] over in Sweden or whatever so you know
[40:16] how it is you have to silence those and
[40:17] when you're at work so the purpose is is
[40:20] just so that we can get announcements
[40:21] out quickly because really with email
[40:24] email is very Antiquated uh emails
[40:28] almost it's like the Pony Express now
[40:30] you know when we were trying to get out
[40:32] announcements for when we had to cancel
[40:35] a few weeks back the service my you're
[40:38] just hoping you get everybody covered
[40:40] and so we just there's announcements
[40:43] that come up if you um are not someone
[40:46] that maybe is techsavvy and you need
[40:48] help or assistance with that we've got
[40:50] brother Shane brother Brian and some of
[40:53] these young Brothers they certainly
[40:54] would be glad to help you but let's try
[40:56] to let's try to all get on to that
[40:58] because that's the main um thrust that
[41:02] I'm using to get things out
[41:03] announcements and and prayer request and
[41:06] so um if you see that someone's not on
[41:08] there in your family or or what have you
[41:10] so I'll just keep making the
[41:12] announcement I'll keep trying to contact
[41:14] but if you could help me out as well you
[41:15] see somebody that's not on the list say
[41:17] hey hey come on let's let's let's get on
[41:19] but I do there's Brothers here that can
[41:21] really that can help you um CU I know
[41:24] sometimes that can be a little bit
[41:25] overwhelming but that's that's the main
[41:27] tool that um that I'm going to be using
[41:29] to get things out to you so um let's
[41:31] just try to do that with the telegram
[41:34] and uh everybody

[50:45] 2 Luke Chapter 2 just
[50:50] to let's read from the gospel in Luke
[50:52] Chapter
[50:54] 2 and it came to to pass we are reading
[50:58] from verse
[51:00] one and it came to pass in those
[51:03] days that there went out a decree from
[51:07] Caesar
[51:08] Augustus that all the word should be
[51:12] taxed and this taxing was first made
[51:17] when
[51:18] serenus serenus was governor of
[51:22] Syria and all went to be taxed
[51:28] everyone into his own
[51:31] City and Joseph also went
[51:34] up From Galilee out of the city of
[51:38] Nazareth into
[51:42] Judea onto the city of
[51:44] David which is called
[51:46] Bethlehem because he was of the house
[51:49] and lineage of
[51:51] David to be taxed with Mary his spouse
[51:55] wife being great with
[51:59] child and so it was that while they were
[52:03] there the days were
[52:06] accomplished that she should be
[52:09] delivered and she brought forth a
[52:11] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[52:15] swaddling
[52:16] clothes and laid him in a Manger because
[52:21] there was no room for them in the in may
[52:25] the Lord bless
[52:27] the reading of his holy word God bless
[52:29] you let's be
[52:32] seated praise the Lord
[52:35] hallelujah so it's always a privilege to
[52:38] be in the house of the
[52:40] Lord and a privilege to serve the Lord
[52:43] amen we love him because he first loved
[52:48] us and we are looking forward to the day
[52:52] when we shall see him face to face amen
[52:56] oh hallelujah what a day that will be so
[53:00] just to encourage ourselves this evening
[53:02] we want to speak
[53:04] on the first
[53:07] Christmas and this
[53:11] Christmas the first
[53:14] Christmas and this
[53:18] Christmas

[53:35] stay it's here to
[53:37] stay and it will
[53:40] stay because it's here to

[54:15] friendly around Christmas time wanting
[54:19] to help one
[54:21] another yes sir so the prophet said he
[54:24] wish it would be Christmas all the
[54:30] time and he said the fact and the fact
[54:34] of all this with all the error and
[54:39] everything that there is about
[54:42] it because as we have been taught and we
[54:45] know he was not Christ Jesus our lord
[54:50] was no born in
[54:52] December but thank God the whole world
[54:55] is celebrating name but we as Believers
[54:58] brother Bram said we don't celebrate
[55:02] Christmas we worship
[55:05] Christ he said the birth of Christ or
[55:10] the birth of Jesus is not to be
[55:13] celebrated he said you can celebrate the
[55:16] birthday of Lincoln or Washington or
[55:19] whoever it be but not
[55:21] Christ the C the birthday of Christ
[55:24] should be worshiped
[55:27] amen that's that's good praise the
[55:31] Lord and with all the error and
[55:35] everything there is something about
[55:40] it there is something about with all the
[55:45] error and the Santa Claus and whatever
[55:48] there is something about
[55:52] it he said God as God something in
[56:00] it you know hasn't he he has he's got
[56:05] something about it just the very name
[56:09] and the Very thought of the birth of the
[56:12] Lord
[56:14] Jesus Oh the word has
[56:18] put a Santa cross in his place sure but
[56:24] not to the Christian
[56:26] it is still
[56:29] Christmas they put a Santa Claus but to
[56:32] the Christian it's
[56:35] christas and the prophet of God
[56:38] said now where you say the rest of them
[56:43] all Santa Claus and go on like they
[56:49] do he said well we just must as well do
[56:54] it
[56:56] well no
[56:58] sir no this is not a pagan celebration
[57:03] to
[57:05] us this is a sacred
[57:10] hour if there has been no
[57:14] Christmas there would have been no
[57:21] Resurrection if there be no
[57:24] Christmas then it have been no
[57:29] love there's been no
[57:33] peace there's been no Hereafter for the
[57:38] believer if there has been no
[57:41] Christmas there will be no Hereafter for
[57:43] the
[57:45] Christian then there would have been no
[57:47] Resurrection for the
[57:49] Christmas and
[57:51] so
[57:53] Christmas is not a celebration to us is
[57:57] a worship to
[58:00] us no wonder that the wise men when they
[58:03] came they said we have seen a
[58:06] star and we have come to worship
[58:11] him so remember we are just speaking
[58:13] this evening on the first Christmas and
[58:17] this
[58:21] Christmas the prophet of God
[58:23] said God stands
[58:27] on the promised word for each New
[58:31] Year it stands on
[58:34] it this year to fulfill what he has got
[58:39] promised for this
[58:42] year whatever it is I want to be right
[58:46] in the center of his will Amen in the
[58:48] future like they did
[58:51] am there is a promise for this day for
[58:55] this year
[58:56] whatever I be I want to be part of
[58:59] it I we want to make ourselves ready we
[59:02] want to create the right atmosphere so
[59:06] that he can step
[59:08] in and fulfill his word for this age in
[59:12] your life in my life
[59:16] amen we should be looking forward we
[59:19] should be condition we should be
[59:24] prepared for him to do do what he has
[59:27] promised for this year in our
[59:32] lives remember this the first Christmas
[59:36] and this
[59:38] Christmas the prophet of God
[59:41] said nothing has
[59:48] changed he said God
[59:51] takes his man but not his spirit
[59:56] right he said the devil takes his man
[59:59] but not his
[1:00:01] spirit so then he told
[1:00:04] us it's like the man one
[1:00:07] morning I heard it a man got up
[1:00:11] early and went out and picked up the
[1:00:15] paper came back and sat down put his
[1:00:18] feet on his stable or D and whatever and
[1:00:22] his glasses on he begin to read the
[1:00:25] paper
[1:00:27] his wife
[1:00:28] said she was getting breakfast for him
[1:00:31] he said
[1:00:33] John anything
[1:00:37] new John anything new he said
[1:00:42] no the same old
[1:00:45] thing just new
[1:00:48] people yeah that's right murderess rape
[1:00:53] and everything somebody has done it
[1:00:57] see listen just new
[1:01:03] people just new people the same old
[1:01:06] thing the same old story but just new
[1:01:09] people so we are the new people in the
[1:01:11] block
[1:01:14] now anything new the first Christmas and
[1:01:19] this Christmas anything new no just new
[1:01:23] people
[1:01:29] amen are we
[1:01:31] together
[1:01:33] amen just new people and the prophet of
[1:01:36] God said
[1:01:38] listen God don't take away his
[1:01:44] Spirit the devil don't take away his
[1:01:48] spirit so the spirit that has been
[1:01:52] operating all these years at the first
[1:01:57] Christmas and this Christmas is the same
[1:02:00] just new
[1:02:04] people and a man's
[1:02:08] character is expressed through his
[1:02:13] Works he said a man's character is known
[1:02:18] by his
[1:02:21] Works he said that is why God used the
[1:02:23] spirit of Elijah
[1:02:26] upon Elijah upon Elisha upon John upon
[1:02:31] William Bram and that spirit is coming
[1:02:34] again but different characters or
[1:02:38] different
[1:02:40] people but how do you know that this is
[1:02:42] the spirit you watch the
[1:02:45] characteristics so he told us the very
[1:02:48] holy ghost that was upon Christ is the
[1:02:52] same holy ghost that comes upon the
[1:02:54] church yeah
[1:02:57] so by the expression by the
[1:02:59] manifestation then you will know the
[1:03:02] spirit that is at
[1:03:07] work May the Lord Jesus help
[1:03:11] us anything new
[1:03:14] no just new
[1:03:19] people at the first
[1:03:24] Christmas remember
[1:03:27] at the first
[1:03:30] Christmas there
[1:03:32] was Supernatural
[1:03:37] visitation there was a man called
[1:03:39] Zacharia and his wife
[1:03:43] Elizabeth there was a Simeon there was
[1:03:45] an
[1:03:48] Anna praise the Lord and the Bible told
[1:03:53] us at the firstr
[1:03:56] christas
[1:03:59] Zacharias a righteous
[1:04:02] man and his wife and he talk talk about
[1:04:05] their langage where they were coming
[1:04:07] from where Zacharia came from where
[1:04:09] Elizabeth came from and he said they
[1:04:13] were working according to all the
[1:04:17] Commandments and the ordinances of
[1:04:20] God the light they had in their
[1:04:24] day right
[1:04:26] we just read the scripture the scripture
[1:04:28] says so this man and his wife were
[1:04:33] righteous working according to the
[1:04:36] Commandment all the
[1:04:38] Commandments and the ordinances of God
[1:04:42] under the blood of boots and goats
[1:04:45] that's true that's and they live such a
[1:04:50] life until one day the great angel
[1:04:55] Gabriel came down to him in the
[1:04:59] temple and I want us to remember
[1:05:03] this that this man and this woman and
[1:05:07] the men of all ages have been men and
[1:05:11] women of like passions as we
[1:05:16] are remember they had their challenges
[1:05:19] they had their difficulties they had
[1:05:21] their trials they had their dis
[1:05:24] disappointments at the first Christmas
[1:05:26] this
[1:05:28] Christmas good and I want us to
[1:05:34] remember Zacharias was a
[1:05:40] priest being a priest does not exempt in
[1:05:44] from life
[1:05:47] challenges and the Bible
[1:05:50] said he they had no
[1:05:54] child for his wife was a
[1:05:59] bar so remember he said in those days it
[1:06:04] was a big reproach not to have a
[1:06:09] child so this righteous man and
[1:06:13] righteous woman had their own challenges
[1:06:17] at the first
[1:06:19] Christmas but I want you to remember
[1:06:21] this their challenges did not stop them
[1:06:25] from rending their services to almighty
[1:06:30] God and then remember and I thought of
[1:06:33] it what of is Zacharia did not go to
[1:06:36] church that
[1:06:38] day will not be reading the story like
[1:06:41] this despite his difficulty the Bible
[1:06:45] say it was his lot it was his time to
[1:06:49] minister and I said no it might be how
[1:06:53] Zakaria might have been praying for
[1:06:55] people because he stood between the
[1:06:57] people and
[1:06:59] God so I believe people might have
[1:07:02] brought their counsels or I mean their
[1:07:04] problems and their questions and their
[1:07:07] needs to the PRI
[1:07:09] right and I believe he might have prayed
[1:07:13] for many people without children and
[1:07:15] they got children that is so good that
[1:07:17] is so good and I believe he might have
[1:07:20] prayed for many women that were baren
[1:07:23] and they became fruitful
[1:07:26] and I believe in pray with people men
[1:07:29] with challenges impotency or whatever
[1:07:32] challenges and they might have got the
[1:07:36] answers because it's store between the
[1:07:39] people and
[1:07:41] God despite his
[1:07:43] difficulty despite his
[1:07:46] challenges he did not miss
[1:07:49] Services maybe the devil might have come
[1:07:51] to say hey what is the use of going to
[1:07:54] church you pray for this one that woman
[1:07:57] has brought baby for dedication you pray
[1:07:59] for this one what about your own wife
[1:08:02] physician heal
[1:08:05] yourself
[1:08:07] that's and I believe he had a lot of
[1:08:11] reproaches to go
[1:08:12] through right don't
[1:08:15] forget we are not Exempted from
[1:08:18] challenges and
[1:08:20] trials because you are faithful because
[1:08:22] you're a Believer because you are
[1:08:24] committed it does not exempt us from
[1:08:27] Life trials and life
[1:08:29] challenges
[1:08:31] sir are we
[1:08:34] together we are talking about the first
[1:08:36] Christmas and this Christmas
[1:08:39] yeah and I believe the same devil might
[1:08:43] be coming to him talking to him what's
[1:08:45] the point of going to church you pray
[1:08:46] for people look at this one there might
[1:08:48] be something wrong with you you pray for
[1:08:51] this one look at them look at what about
[1:08:54] your own wife
[1:08:56] there is something wrong with
[1:08:59] you
[1:09:01] remember the enemy the devil will never
[1:09:05] encourage
[1:09:07] you brother said one day when he lost
[1:09:11] sister hope he lost sister uh Mida I
[1:09:15] mean what's the son Charon Rose and
[1:09:17] sister hope he said the devil came to
[1:09:21] him he said he could not tell me there
[1:09:23] is no God right but he told me that God
[1:09:27] don't care for
[1:09:30] me he said look Billy you struggle from
[1:09:34] morning sometime brother pray for people

[1:09:42] Billy what couldn't he do for
[1:09:45] you you pray for people and just like
[1:09:48] that he said look this problem of your
[1:09:50] wife and your child he could have just
[1:09:52] like this but look at his everywhere
[1:09:54] seem to be black
[1:09:59] he could not tell me there is no God but
[1:10:03] he convince me that God don't care for
[1:10:07] me and I want us to remember he's still
[1:10:11] doing that
[1:10:14] today he wants you to believe that God
[1:10:17] don't care for you he want you to
[1:10:20] believe all the time you've been going
[1:10:22] to church you give your tithe you give
[1:10:23] stress of it you are here and there
[1:10:25] there and there what has come out of

[1:10:31] your requests do have this request this
[1:10:34] request what has done that what has come
[1:10:35] out of
[1:10:36] that look at this one there look at this
[1:10:39] and he want you to believe that look
[1:10:42] that's it where to go to church because
[1:10:44] what have you enjoying and somebody else
[1:10:46] is not enjoying the word look at that
[1:10:48] one your neighbor is not even a
[1:10:49] Christian but look at how comfortable
[1:10:51] they
[1:10:52] are look at how peaceful they are look
[1:10:54] at him look at his children look at
[1:10:56] their look at this and
[1:10:58] that does it worth to go to church at
[1:11:06] all
[1:11:08] remember he's still doing that
[1:11:12] today yes sir so brother told us the
[1:11:17] greatest battle that is ever fought is
[1:11:19] for right here
[1:11:22] right and so I know he's still fighting
[1:11:25] that battle today the battle is still
[1:11:28] going on and he want to convince you
[1:11:31] that he does not care for you but
[1:11:34] remember God is always
[1:11:38] mindful like I say his mind is full of
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:45] [Applause]
[1:11:48] Hallelujah but the accuser of the
[1:11:51] Breen the discourager of the Breen
[1:11:55] the enemy of God and the enemy of God's
[1:11:59] people
[1:12:01] right he comes to let you know he
[1:12:04] doesn't care for
[1:12:09] you the first Christmas in this
[1:12:14] Christmas but thank God that despite the
[1:12:19] challenges of Zacharia and his wife he
[1:12:23] was faithful amen
[1:12:26] amen he was going to
[1:12:29] church and despite his challenges he was
[1:12:32] still praying for people it was his time
[1:12:34] to go to church it was his hour to
[1:12:37] minister to the people and pray for the
[1:12:39] people intercede for the people burn
[1:12:41] incense on their behalf hold their
[1:12:44] prayer before God lord hear the prayer
[1:12:46] of thy children Lord remember thy people
[1:12:49] Lord remember Israel Lord undertake for
[1:12:52] your
[1:12:53] people and remember
[1:12:55] remember a gift is to get yourself out
[1:12:58] of the
[1:13:02] way and he said brother said the gift is
[1:13:05] not for you it's for the
[1:13:09] people that's why Joseph interpreted
[1:13:13] dreams for people but his own dream he
[1:13:16] could not interpret
[1:13:22] it the first Christmas
[1:13:27] the angel came to Zacharia at the
[1:13:30] appointed time because God has a season
[1:13:34] God has a time and God has a
[1:13:37] purpose he does not forsake and he does
[1:13:40] not
[1:13:42] forget

[1:13:48] the end it will
[1:13:50] speak if it carries wait for it because
[1:13:54] it will not fail

[1:14:02] hurry it's not in
[1:14:06] h we get impatience but God
[1:14:11] is he has a program so be
[1:14:15] patient be patient he will do

[1:17:53] God it is an appointment with God and
[1:17:57] Jesus keeps all his
[1:18:02] appointments we have an appointment with
[1:18:05] him and remember even if nobody goes to

[1:18:19] good
[1:18:21] Zacharia oh my goodness listen saints of
[1:18:24] God
[1:18:25] sometimes you come to a place you feel
[1:18:27] so lonely as if nobody cares for
[1:18:32] us but that's just a feeling he cares
[1:18:35] for
[1:18:39] us he always
[1:18:42] cares and sometimes so nobody even
[1:18:46] encourages me that's
[1:18:49] true but if nobody encourages you
[1:18:53] encourage yourself
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:58] amen listen sints if you are depending
[1:19:02] on somebody to encourage you you'll be

[1:19:19] encouragement so if you are depending on

[1:20:00] up and I became a man I put childish
[1:20:04] things away
[1:20:07] right be like that spring the prophet

[1:20:12] about he said when you go

[1:24:25] to church that day
[1:24:27] right that's right that's so good but
[1:24:31] there was something God had for
[1:24:34] him brother Bram
[1:24:36] said sometimes like he was speaking
[1:24:39] about Abraham and Sarah he said the day
[1:24:42] the angel of the Lord came the Lord came
[1:24:45] in Elohim
[1:24:47] came when that three visitors came
[1:24:50] in when Abraham said I've taken upon
[1:24:53] myself though I'm fresh and blood but
[1:24:55] I've taken up to speak to the most high
[1:24:58] God he said that morning Satan knowing
[1:25:02] that there was coming a
[1:25:05] visitation he made Sarah to
[1:25:11] force what did Sarah said she went out
[1:25:14] he
[1:25:16] said came back not talking and maybe AB
[1:25:20] say how was the market
[1:25:26] ma hello
[1:25:30] ma what's wrong what
[1:25:35] happened I've been telling you that we
[1:25:37] should check what we
[1:25:39] believe since saidah left lot and the
[1:25:42] wife left the church do you see how they
[1:25:43] are
[1:25:45] prospered so I went I met lot in the
[1:25:47] market
[1:25:49] today with men carrying a briefcase for
[1:25:52] her how many
[1:25:54] trolleys or whatever it was unloaded
[1:25:56] with
[1:25:59] Goods look at our cars and our C they
[1:26:02] are starving to
[1:26:06] death and we say we are right we say we
[1:26:09] are the
[1:26:12] Believers he said the enemy was trying
[1:26:16] to hinder them for the
[1:26:20] visitation you
[1:26:22] remember the at ere you create is very
[1:26:30] important we want to create the right
[1:26:33] atmosphere at home that's why when we
[1:26:35] come to church you think some service is
[1:26:38] for nothing it's for
[1:26:41] something we are creating an
[1:26:44] atmosphere when we begin to see all
[1:26:47] things
[1:26:49] possible Lord I be we are creating an
[1:26:53] atmosphere
[1:26:57] when we begin to sing we are creating an
[1:27:01] atmosphere brother Bram said the angel
[1:27:04] of the Lord he likes that son only
[1:27:09] believe
[1:27:11] wow so when we begin to sing and we are
[1:27:14] worshiping we are creating an
[1:27:18] atmosphere and it is the atmosphere that
[1:27:21] brings the results
[1:27:25] so when you create a FY atmosphere at
[1:27:30] home Prophet say you drive the spirit of
[1:27:33] God
[1:27:35] away you drive him away he said because
[1:27:38] he's timid the Holy
[1:27:42] Spirit you drive him away by your
[1:27:45] behavior and your attitude and your
[1:27:48] conduct and your words you
[1:27:51] speak see he just step

[1:45:59] Mary right when he heard it said HH you
[1:46:02] are saying what oh my God how can I
[1:46:05] swallow
[1:46:07] this I love this sister I love her nice
[1:46:10] but how can I believe
[1:46:13] this how am I going to explain it you
[1:46:16] don't need any explanation you just need
[1:46:18] to believe even if you cannot explain it
[1:46:20] believe
[1:46:21] it how is he going to explain it an
[1:46:25] angel spoke to her and so she has
[1:46:27] conceived can you explain
[1:46:30] it what is the scientific proof about
[1:46:36] that
[1:46:39] nothing but at that first
[1:46:43] Christmas Joseph stood with Mary right
[1:46:47] it is hard to explain what you are
[1:46:49] saying right the Bible say he was
[1:46:51] minding to put are we
[1:46:53] Mar say no disassociate say quietly I
[1:46:57] don't believe the message I don't want
[1:46:59] say
[1:47:01] Joseph son of David Don't Be Afraid
[1:47:05] right believe his story right believe
[1:47:09] what she's telling you and thank God at
[1:47:14] that first Christmas Joseph stood with
[1:47:17] her right
[1:47:19] right he identify himself amen amen with
[1:47:23] the
[1:47:25] word made flesh in that
[1:47:31] hour he went through
[1:47:33] reproaches they went through
[1:47:36] reproaches at the first Christmas but
[1:47:39] they stood
[1:47:43] there who stands today this Christmas
[1:47:46] for him to Bear the reproach of the
[1:47:50] word you believe something you cannot
[1:47:53] explain yes I believe
[1:47:55] it because I know it is the word of
[1:48:00] God Amen at the first
[1:48:04] Christmas and then again at the first
[1:48:07] Christmas there was a decree from Caesar
[1:48:09] Augustus right everybody should go oh my
[1:48:14] goodness everybody should go
[1:48:17] why and Mary was Heavy she was packing
[1:48:21] the word made flesh right
[1:48:24] am yes in a
[1:48:27] woman was
[1:48:29] Emmanuel because the angel said You
[1:48:32] shall conceive you shall bring forth a
[1:48:35] son his name Shall be Called Emmanuel
[1:48:38] God With
[1:48:40] Us and so carrying Emmanuel everything
[1:48:43] should have gone
[1:48:47] fine backing
[1:48:49] Emmanuel everybody should have bowed
[1:48:51] before her hello sister hello God bless
[1:48:55] you
[1:48:56] no she was despised at the first
[1:49:00] Christmas nobody want to do anything
[1:49:02] with her why because of Emmanuel in the
[1:49:08] womb because of the revealed
[1:49:11] word because of the visitation of the
[1:49:14] Holy
[1:49:16] Ghost at the first Christmas and so it
[1:49:20] is this Christmas Hallelujah
[1:49:28] amen are we
[1:49:30] together who is on the Lord
[1:49:35] side who will stand for him
[1:49:38] amen at the first Christmas remember
[1:49:42] Spirit don't die
[1:49:45] am right
[1:49:49] remember the same things there new
[1:49:53] people right that's right there new
[1:50:03] people Mary and Joseph has to
[1:50:05] go what is all
[1:50:08] this
[1:50:09] how you thought she's a Believer and
[1:50:12] they believe the message many are the
[1:50:14] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:50:16] Lord will deliver him from
[1:50:19] all and God hands was in that too
[1:50:25] right Mary and Joseph even the king
[1:50:30] might not even know what he was
[1:50:32] doing but God knew what it is because
[1:50:35] the heart of the king is in his
[1:50:39] hands the kingdom of men God rules in
[1:50:42] the Affairs of
[1:50:43] men it does not matter who is in the
[1:50:46] white house or blue house or green
[1:50:50] house it does not matter what nation or
[1:50:53] which of the nation we are coming from
[1:50:54] right you might not like the one that is
[1:50:57] there I might not like it but God is in
[1:51:00] it all because there must be a pharaoh
[1:51:02] that God rais
[1:51:05] up and God is in control of everything
[1:51:08] that is happening today in America in
[1:51:11] the Middle East and the west and
[1:51:13] whatever there is
[1:51:15] somebody that is our God who controls
[1:51:20] everything so be at peace with
[1:51:28] yourself the first Christmas and this
[1:51:31] Christmas and remember
[1:51:36] this we must be where he want us to be
[1:51:40] right it's word to be fulfilled right if
[1:51:45] you are not there he will force you to
[1:51:48] be
[1:51:51] there so
[1:51:53] you better line up before you are forced
[1:51:55] to
[1:51:59] line Mary and Joseph were out of
[1:52:03] place they thought where we are here is
[1:52:05] fine for us he and then no no no no
[1:52:09] no it has been prophesied where the
[1:52:12] Messiah will be
[1:52:15] born and so all that was happening was
[1:52:20] to force them to go where they have to
[1:52:24] be because when you are in the vision
[1:52:27] you must be where the vision want you to
[1:52:29] be brother had a
[1:52:30] vision he has to pray for a sick child
[1:52:34] and he has to do some things some
[1:52:36] certain things might be at certain
[1:52:38] places he cannot tell the people he went
[1:52:41] to the house I think the little C or the
[1:52:44] little daughter or whatever and then he
[1:52:45] went there and out of
[1:52:49] compassion he did not wait for the
[1:52:51] vision right
[1:52:54] right he went ahead of the vision he
[1:52:57] took the baby pray
[1:53:01] right he realized I've made a
[1:53:04] mistake I should have wait for the
[1:53:09] vision Lord have mercy upon me I've been
[1:53:11] very
[1:53:12] foolish he cannot tell anybody because
[1:53:15] the vision must speak that's right right
[1:53:18] and if God give the vision he has to
[1:53:20] work it out
[1:53:23] if your dream is from God leave it God
[1:53:25] will work it out you don't force
[1:53:30] anything and they stand
[1:53:34] there and then the brother said oh I
[1:53:37] want to go if this brother lives
[1:53:39] something will be
[1:53:41] out everything must be how it has to be
[1:53:45] listen there is nothing too hard for God
[1:53:48] to do no no no no no no no no leave
[1:53:53] God's work into God's
[1:53:55] hands don't go ahead of him we are not
[1:53:59] wiser we are not smarter
[1:54:04] that that is so true grandama must come
[1:54:07] from here and take a
[1:54:10] lens and try what has that God to do but
[1:54:14] that's the
[1:54:16] vision as he saw in the vision it must
[1:54:20] be that way right so Grandmama you are
[1:54:23] needed grandpaa you are needed your man
[1:54:27] your everybody is needed we must be in
[1:54:30] our place maybe you missing church

[2:05:34] Pope the AR Bishop let's consult them we

[2:06:50] understanding
[2:06:52] they thought it would be here this a
[2:06:55] church this man know about
[2:06:58] it and when they lean on their own
[2:07:02] understanding they got

[2:07:08] confused with all kinds of doctrines and
[2:07:10] all kinds of
[2:07:12] ideas follow the

[2:07:28] guide you don't instruct the guide the
[2:07:32] guide is the leader follow the Holy
[2:07:37] Ghost the sty of
[2:07:40] Bethlehem at the first Christmas the sty
[2:07:43] of Bethlehem was leading them until they
[2:07:47] lean on their own understanding and they
[2:07:49] almost lost their lives
[2:07:53] that's why many of our people are
[2:07:54] confused today because they want to know

[2:19:04] today this Christmas praise the
[2:19:09] Lord oh Lord help me we ought to give
[2:19:13] the most enest Eed to the things which
[2:19:15] we have
[2:19:16] had what type of people ought we to be
[2:19:20] when when we see the great Jehovah come
[2:19:22] down and do the things that he does and
[2:19:25] see them compared scripture by
[2:19:28] scripture that they are the truth and we
[2:19:31] sit around sometimes like a wat on a
[2:19:36] log and just so
[2:19:39] unconcerned we ought to be
[2:19:42] busy every
[2:19:45] minute trying to get people to Christ we
[2:19:49] ought to be live
[2:19:51] Stones we should never be slothful like
[2:19:54] we
[2:19:55] are we go up to church and we see the
[2:20:00] Lord Jesus do something or bless us in
[2:20:02] such a way and then we go back out and
[2:20:05] then we oh very nice
[2:20:08] meeting now the preaching of the word we
[2:20:11] enjoy it but that's not the main thing
[2:20:15] that's not we should not Worship the
[2:20:17] Lord just after we get through preaching
[2:20:21] preaching the word as we usually
[2:20:24] do just worship him that's wonderful but
[2:20:28] we should worship him every hour of our
[2:20:34] life but we should worship him every
[2:20:37] hour of our
[2:20:39] life when we are at work we should
[2:20:42] worship him every time the opportunity
[2:20:45] present itself Worship the Lord by
[2:20:49] testifying of him right
[2:20:51] if you see some if you see some some of
[2:20:54] you ladies see a woman in the wrong
[2:20:57] Worship the Lord by taking air and
[2:20:59] saying sister there is a better life
[2:21:01] than
[2:21:03] this you men at your work when you hear
[2:21:07] a man using the name of the Lord in vain
[2:21:10] get a chance to one side and slip over
[2:21:13] and take him by the hand and say you
[2:21:17] there is better life than this you
[2:21:19] shouldn't use those words and tell him
[2:21:23] in make Gentle Way all those things is
[2:21:28] worship all those things is
[2:21:33] worship we ought to
[2:21:35] Worship the Lord by telling them there
[2:21:38] is a God Of Heaven that answers prayer
[2:21:42] he say here let's say he
[2:21:44] said and tell them in Meek Gentle Way
[2:21:46] all those things is worship and when we
[2:21:49] see someone sick and the doctor says
[2:21:51] there is no more can be done we ought to
[2:21:55] Worship the Lord by telling them there
[2:21:57] is a God Of Heaven that answers prayer
[2:22:00] and then when we see those things take
[2:22:03] place that we do see take place and then
[2:22:07] we should never let let those things
[2:22:10] slip we just let it go through our
[2:22:16] fingers that's what the matter with the
[2:22:18] great Pentecostal church today

[2:38:25] life and to think of how that brother
[2:38:28] Timothy was bringing that out many
[2:38:29] different statements that brother
[2:38:30] brandham had made I mean you can go
[2:38:33] through a whole service after service
[2:38:36] but to put it back to what what it
[2:38:40] really comes back to you know we we
[2:38:42] can't be I'm not responsible for what
[2:38:44] all the world has done but it's like
[2:38:46] brother Brandon when he preaches that
[2:38:48] message impersonation Christianity he
[2:38:50] charges us with the responsibility as
[2:38:55] parents as as
[2:38:57] Christians to put it on the right
[2:39:00] emphasis and know oh we we understand
[2:39:03] that but to think think of what it is he
[2:39:07] said we're not worshiping Christ in a
[2:39:08] Manger that's right is Christ in you
[2:39:11] hallelujah it's Christ in
[2:39:14] me and when you think you think of
[2:39:17] brother Brandon would bring it down so
[2:39:19] fitting he said how he was born in a
[2:39:23] stinking stable
[2:39:26] yes place that was totally unfit for a
[2:39:30] king to be born in and he said that is
[2:39:33] the same way of each and every one of
[2:39:35] our lives our lives were stinking
[2:39:39] messes not fit for a
[2:39:42] king but aren't you glad that he looked
[2:39:44] beyond our faults Hallelujah that I I
[2:39:47] can worship I can speak how Great Is Our
[2:39:50] God that God came not that we were
[2:39:52] worthy we never became Worthy on our own
[2:39:56] it's him it's his
[2:39:58] worthiness amen oh aren't you grateful
[2:40:00] for the grace of God Amen just a just
[2:40:03] even a greater determination to
[2:40:07] persevere to be in the house of God and
[2:40:09] then even when we get here persevere
[2:40:11] beyond our
[2:40:12] feelings persevere Beyond self and say

[2:40:19] life life is for one purpose and that's

[2:40:24] not going to I'm not cuz you realize you
[2:40:26] can worship you can worship according to
[2:40:28] the dictates of your flesh and we could
[2:40:30] give into our flesh but I'm not going to
