[33:05] if anybody asks you where's the matter
[33:07] with him
[33:08] where's he going i'm going up yonder
[33:12] because death ain't going to change me
[33:16] the only the only death that brings the
[33:18] changes by the new birth right here but
[33:20] that physical death is not going to
[33:22] change us what we are here is what we
[33:25] will be over there
[33:27] if we're identified with him here we'll
[33:29] be there we will be in the rapture
[33:32] amen because he's coming to claim what
[33:34] belongs to him death will not change us
[33:37] at all
[33:38] it only moves us from one place to the
[33:41] other
[33:42] it's like right now the time that we're
[33:44] living in you're going to the nurseries
[33:46] or other things to buy plants to plant
[33:48] they grow them to a certain place a
[33:50] height and then you take them home
[33:53] after that time you gotta you actually
[33:55] got to put them in a bigger pot or put
[33:57] them inside of your beds or your
[33:58] landscaping you know why they've reached
[34:02] a full growth in that pot
[34:06] and they need room to expand
[34:08] that's why brother branham tells us in
[34:10] the future home he says the rapture
[34:12] itself will be a transplanting
[34:15] so it's taking what was here
[34:18] and moving it there oh glory be to god
[34:22] amen i'm glad that he's still working on
[34:23] me
[34:24] amen aren't you glad there's a desire
[34:27] in your heart to serve god
[34:30] to please him
[34:31] to live for him
[34:33] amen we didn't put that there
[34:36] god put that there but may we so
[34:38] surrender to the god who placed it there
[34:40] and makes that desire come to a reality
[34:44] may we so surrender ourselves to him and
[34:46] say god everything that you have desired
[34:49] and what you put in my heart i want to
[34:51] release lord i want to release myself
[34:54] amen just so glad to see each and every
[34:57] one of you
[34:58] just good to be in the house of the lord
[35:00] amen we thank god for these beautiful
[35:02] days we've had

[35:07] that and and um
[35:10] so
[35:11] we must we might as well enjoy it from
[35:13] what i understand
[35:15] you know and everybody always says well
[35:17] it's ohio i hear that from people in
[35:19] arizona i hear that from people that so
[35:21] that's just not an ohio thing i hear
[35:23] from people new mexico everybody always
[35:25] says stick around
[35:26] amen but i'm so i'm glad that we're on
[35:29] well in our way on spring here i want to
[35:32] just
[35:33] before i invite brother jerry here to
[35:35] come
[35:36] i want to just remind you the
[35:38] announcement was set out for the
[35:39] memorial day meetings there's details on
[35:42] that announcement of the service times
[35:44] as well as the
[35:45] lord willing the dinner that will be
[35:47] there on sunday
[35:49] afternoon after that service so if
[35:52] you'll just
[35:53] just look at that and just make
[35:55] preparations for that
[35:57] and let's just have just really our
[35:59] hearts and be in prayer
[36:01] for those services as well and don't
[36:03] just wait and be in prayer for them but
[36:04] be in prayer for every service
[36:07] because
[36:08] we come whatever we come expecting we'll
[36:11] receive
[36:12] and i tell you right now we ought to
[36:14] expect big things
[36:15] we ought to expect big things right here
[36:18] this morning
[36:19] because there's nothing greater than god
[36:22] nothing no situation is greater than the
[36:25] lord
[36:26] god's above all of that
[36:28] also i know the prayer request was sent
[36:30] out to continue to remember
[36:33] sister linda cavillo in prayer and we
[36:35] just asked that you just really just
[36:37] continue to do that different ones as
[36:39] they come to your heart
[36:41] in the assembly different brothers and
[36:42] sisters as they come to your hearts and
[36:45] just just just pray you might be on the
[36:47] job you might be driving and other
[36:49] things let's let's be in prayer for one
[36:51] another
[36:52] amen there's things that when god puts
[36:54] something on your heart you want to
[36:55] respond to that
[36:56] and
[36:58] you know it just god is mindful of each
[37:01] of our needs sometimes we can get in
[37:02] trouble of second thinking and second
[37:04] guessing ourselves
[37:06] you know i've got in trouble of that of
[37:08] many times of thinking i should have
[37:10] sent this text or i should have called
[37:11] here i should have done that but no i
[37:13] don't want to bother this i don't want
[37:14] to bother that
[37:15] and there was a situation here this
[37:17] morning i won't go into but i'm glad i
[37:18] hate it to the lord
[37:20] amen because it was very much needed and
[37:22] god is so mindful he's mindful of us
[37:25] isn't he
[37:26] amen and i believe that this morning as
[37:28] we come together
[37:30] i want to say it just um just a great
[37:33] privilege to have brother jerry here and
[37:35] i just
[37:36] i just wanted to be able just to sit and
[37:38] glean and feed as well
[37:41] with you so we just want to just pull on
[37:43] the gift of god
[37:45] and we say it very often but it's very
[37:47] true
[37:48] it's not
[37:49] brother jerry that has control over this
[37:51] service
[37:53] it's not the gift in his life that has
[37:54] control over the service
[37:57] god comes down and uses that gift based
[37:59] on the needs in our life
[38:02] and i'll tell you right now if you pull
[38:04] on the gift of god whatever your need is
[38:06] you go to pulling on that just whatever
[38:08] it is you can be in you're praying in
[38:10] your heart and you just begin to pull
[38:12] and god will take the direction that
[38:15] he's already seen for this service and
[38:17] god can take the man of god right off of
[38:19] his notes or those things just begin to
[38:22] come out of what god's already god
[38:24] already knows and has had him to study
[38:26] on so to remember that that in this
[38:28] service
[38:29] we've not come to be spectators
[38:32] we've come to get in
[38:33] we've come to pull on the gift of god
[38:36] we've not come to just hear things that
[38:38] go along with what we think or i believe
[38:40] this or i feel this but we've come here
[38:42] to pull on the gift of god
[38:44] where our shortcomings are we want to
[38:46] know
[38:48] we want to know
[38:49] and the grace of god that shows us from
[38:51] where we are to where we need to be
[38:54] amen i i want that this morning amen we
[38:58] want that this morning don't we how many
[39:00] say lord i'm gonna pull
[39:02] i'm gonna pull on the gift of god like
[39:04] that like that woman with an issue of
[39:06] blood i know that the lord jesus has
[39:09] what i have need of
[39:10] amen could we just
[39:12] stand amen and let's just sing that
[39:15] little course as our brother would come
[39:17] touching jesus
[39:19] is all that really matters
[39:23] there was a woman
[39:25] who
[39:26] tried
[39:26] many
[39:28] positions
[39:30] [Music]
[39:33] yet
[39:34] grew worse
[39:36] so
[39:37] to jesus
[39:40] she came
[39:44] and when
[39:45] the crowd
[39:47] [Music]
[39:48] tried to
[39:51] restrain her
[39:56] she
[39:57] whispered
[39:58] [Music]
[40:00] these words
[40:02] through her pain she whispered these
[40:04] words
[40:06] oh
[40:07] touching jesus
[40:11] is all
[40:12] that really matters
[40:18] and then
[40:29] [Music]
[40:34] one way
[40:36] to touch him
[40:41] just believe
[40:44] when you call
[40:46] on his name
[40:49] let's just hang it again
[40:51] oh
[40:52] touching jesus
[40:56] it's all that really matters
[41:03] in your life
[41:06] will never be
[41:09] the same
[41:12] [Music]
[41:15] and there's only
[41:18] one way
[41:21] to touch him
[41:26] just believe
[41:29] when you call on
[41:32] his name
[41:36] amen you may be seated just for a moment
[41:39] that's the question i sing this song
[41:44] pray for my my voice isn't what it used
[41:46] to be
[41:49] sometimes i
[41:51] have trouble singing on the key or
[41:52] keeping my voice from cracking but
[41:55] we sing for the glory of god
[41:57] [Music]
[42:09] my heart is like a house
[42:14] one day i let the savior in
[42:17] [Music]
[42:20] there are many rules
[42:23] [Music]
[42:24] we would visit now and then
[42:29] but then one day he saw that door
[42:34] i knew the day had come too soon
[42:39] i said jesus i'm not ready
[42:42] [Music]
[42:44] for us to visit in that room
[42:48] cause that's the place in my heart
[42:53] where even i don't go
[42:58] i got some things in there
[43:03] i don't want no one to know
[43:08] but he handed me the keys
[43:13] there's a love on his face
[43:18] he said i want to make you clean
[43:21] [Music]
[43:23] let me go in your secret place
[43:25] [Music]
[43:28] and as i opened up the door
[43:33] and the devils walked in
[43:38] i was so ashamed
[43:43] his light revealed my hidden sin
[43:48] but when i think about that dream now
[43:52] i'm not ashamed anymore
[43:57] because i know my insane
[44:01] [Music]
[44:02] no longer hides behind that door
[44:07] it was a place in my heart
[44:12] where even i wouldn't go
[44:14] [Music]
[44:17] i had some thanks in there
[44:22] i didn't want no one to know
[44:26] but he handed me the king
[44:31] there's the love on his face
[44:36] he made me clean
[44:38] [Music]
[44:41] i let him in my secret place
[44:46] is there a place in your heart
[44:50] where even you don't go
[44:55] you got some things in there
[45:00] you don't want no one to know
[45:05] well he's handing you the key
[45:07] [Music]
[45:10] here's the love on his face
[45:14] he'll make you clean

[46:36] lord
[46:37] we ask god that you have your complete
[46:40] will way in this service in jesus name
[46:46] i'd like to read from jeremiah chapter
[46:48] 29
[46:50] begin at verse 11 through 13.
[46:54] what i would like to speak on this
[46:56] morning is before i know the plans i
[46:58] have for you
[47:09] jeremiah 29 11 says for i know the
[47:11] thoughts that i think toward you saith
[47:13] the lord thoughts of peace and not of
[47:16] evil
[47:17] to give you an expected end
[47:20] that ye shall call upon me
[47:22] and ye shall go and pray unto me
[47:25] and i will hearken unto you
[47:27] and ye shall seek me and find me when ye
[47:30] shall search for me with all your heart
[47:33] amen you may be seated
[47:38] in the
[47:39] new international
[47:42] translation
[47:44] it says for i know the plans i have for
[47:46] you declares the lord
[47:48] plans to prosper you and not harm you
[47:50] plans to give you hope and a future
[47:56] this letter this was a letter that was
[47:59] sent to the israelites that were in
[48:00] babylon in captivity
[48:03] they had been taken captive from
[48:05] jerusalem
[48:07] and god told them that they were going
[48:09] to remain in captivity for a long time
[48:13] but he told them to go ahead and to
[48:15] build homes and plant gardens and raise
[48:18] families
[48:19] and then
[48:20] god added that after 70 years
[48:24] of babylon had been fulfilled
[48:27] that he would turn his attention toward
[48:29] them
[48:30] and make good on his promise to bring
[48:32] them back to jerusalem
[48:35] and he guaranteed them that he wouldn't
[48:37] forget him and their hope
[48:40] of returning home would come true
[48:43] god kept his promise to the israelites
[48:47] when he sent the king of
[48:49] persia king cyrus
[48:52] and he conquered babylon
[48:55] and
[48:57] then after cyrus congress he allowed the
[48:59] jews to return home so after 70 years of
[49:03] captivity they were able to go back to
[49:05] jerusalem
[49:06] because of the promise of the lord
[49:10] and he said
[49:12] then you'll call on me and come and pray
[49:14] to me and i'll listen to you
[49:17] that's what they did he said you'll seek
[49:19] me and find me when you seek me with all
[49:21] your heart
[49:22] turn me to philippians chapter 4 verses
[49:25] 6 through 9.
[49:37] be careful for nothing but in everything
[49:40] by prayer and supplication with
[49:42] thanksgiving let your requests be made
[49:44] known unto god
[49:46] and the peace of god
[49:48] which passes all understanding shall
[49:50] keep your hearts and minds through
[49:52] christ jesus finally brother whatsoever
[49:55] things are true
[49:56] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[49:58] things are just
[50:00] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[50:02] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[50:04] of a good report if there be any virtue
[50:07] and if there be any praise think on
[50:09] these things
[50:10] those things which ye have both learned
[50:13] and received and heard and seen in me do
[50:17] and the god of peace shall be with you
[50:21] we all
[50:22] want peace mankind wants peace in their
[50:26] hearts they want personal peace
[50:29] and the way to get this piece is through
[50:32] prayer and supplication
[50:35] he says when you you should call on me
[50:39] and you'll pray
[50:40] and i'm going to hear you
[50:43] he said he would hear us when we pray
[50:46] and it's it's through prayer and you
[50:49] know many times you're looking for maybe
[50:51] an answer to something
[50:53] and you want a piece about it
[50:56] and you think well i'll go in prayer and
[50:58] i'll ask god and then god's going to
[51:00] come down and he's going to give me an
[51:01] answer and then i'll have peace that
[51:03] isn't the way it always works
[51:06] what gives you peace is the presence of
[51:08] god
[51:10] that you know no matter what comes
[51:11] you're going to weather the storm no
[51:13] matter what direction needs to be taken
[51:16] god's going to direct you that way
[51:18] whatever needs to be said is going to be
[51:20] said whatever needs to be done is going
[51:22] to be done because you're following the
[51:24] lord so your peace rests in him not
[51:28] yourself if god just come down and told
[51:30] you do this and do this and do this and
[51:32] you say well if i do all those things
[51:34] i'll have peace or if i say this certain
[51:36] thing i'll have peace or if i handle
[51:38] this situation a certain way i'll have
[51:40] peace you would be dependent upon
[51:42] yourself but god wants you to be
[51:44] dependent upon him for your peace so
[51:46] there's times you go into prayer when
[51:48] you go into prayer you get into the
[51:50] presence of god and brother branham says
[51:52] once you get into the presence of god he
[51:53] says sometimes we talk too much we need
[51:56] to just get quiet and begin to listen
[51:59] and see what god will do once we get in
[52:02] his presence and it's the presence of
[52:04] god that settles down around you and
[52:06] gives you that peace i remember years
[52:09] ago when i was uh
[52:11] going to i was in need of back surgery
[52:14] and it was the very first one and i
[52:15] didn't know what to do and i talked to
[52:17] the surgeon
[52:18] and i told him i said well i'm going to
[52:19] have to pray about this he said well you
[52:22] go pray about it mr browning and when
[52:24] you're done then you call me back up and
[52:26] tell me what your answer is
[52:28] and so i said all right so i went to
[52:30] prayer and you know i never one time
[52:33] said god what should i do about my back
[52:35] i never one time asked god god what
[52:38] should i do should i have this surgery
[52:40] or not instead i just got down and i
[52:42] prayed and i prayed for different ones
[52:44] and i worshiped the lord until the
[52:46] presence of god come down then i just
[52:48] got quiet and i just bathed in his
[52:50] presence and you know there was a peace
[52:52] that come down and settle around me i
[52:56] was able to get up then and go on the
[52:58] phone and tell the surgeon i know
[53:00] everything's going to be all right go
[53:02] ahead and schedule the surgery
[53:05] that's the way the peace of god comes
[53:07] why because you're trusting in him i
[53:10] wasn't trusting in the doctor i'm sure
[53:13] the surgeon was was a good surgeon and
[53:16] and and you know after you talk to him
[53:18] you have confidence but it wasn't him
[53:20] and his abilities it was god that i was
[53:23] trusting in
[53:26] i had to uh i had to have three back
[53:28] surgeries in my life
[53:30] the third surgery i talked to a
[53:33] orthopedic surgeon and he said
[53:35] we're gonna have to fuse some bones
[53:37] together
[53:38] and he said uh
[53:40] uh he said that's all i do i don't
[53:42] operate nothing else except the back
[53:45] and he says so he said but i can do my
[53:48] best to what i know what to do he said
[53:50] but then it'll take god to heal it
[53:53] and fuse those bones together when he
[53:55] said that i knew i had the right surgeon
[53:58] i knew you know he was talking about
[54:00] depending on god i was dependent on god
[54:03] so we went ahead with the surgery
[54:05] you know somebody said to me one time
[54:07] said brother i i wanted to give a
[54:10] testimony you know but if i thought
[54:13] i had a back problem that you had but
[54:15] god healed me
[54:17] and i and i said well you go ahead and
[54:19] give a testimony because i knew god
[54:22] healed me too
[54:25] i might have had to add the surgery but
[54:27] you know why i was laying on my back do
[54:28] you know how many messages i got
[54:32] do you know how many sermons came to me
[54:34] and things i studied while i was laying
[54:35] on my back
[54:38] i didn't have any time to do anything
[54:40] else but just laid there
[54:44] so god wanted me laid up for a while
[54:46] god's got a plan for each and every one
[54:49] of us
[54:49] and he knows what it is we might not
[54:52] know his plan but god knows the plan he
[54:55] has for you
[55:02] if you're not positively sure this
[55:04] morning that you have that peace of god
[55:07] then you need to you need to get it i'd
[55:09] raise my hand to god and i'd say god
[55:12] i want the peace that passes all
[55:14] understanding
[55:16] amen
[55:19] i want to surrender i want to i want to
[55:21] come now i want to re-consecrate myself
[55:24] to you
[55:25] look there's nothing in your life that's
[55:27] hid from god god knows everything
[55:30] you know you might be able to put on a
[55:31] front to other people but you can't with
[55:34] god
[55:35] god sees right through it
[55:37] it's just like people come and offer
[55:38] excuses why they why they can't go to
[55:41] church or why they weren't there and
[55:42] everything else and i said well i'll
[55:44] accept it but i don't know whether god
[55:46] will or not
[55:52] hallelujah
[55:54] you know when we see things that seem to
[55:57] be going wrong
[55:58] and you you feel like that peace is
[56:00] escaping you that's when you need to go
[56:02] back to the foundation that's when you
[56:04] need to come back to god get back on
[56:06] your knees and if it's so be it tear
[56:09] down whatever you think you've built up
[56:11] and get back down to the foundation
[56:13] because it doesn't matter how tall you
[56:15] built your defenses up you know the
[56:18] higher they are the harder they fall
[56:21] and uh you know
[56:23] the
[56:24] you know what gets in your way many
[56:26] times
[56:28] or most of the time i'll tell you what
[56:29] gets in my way most of the time is jerry
[56:31] browning
[56:33] brother branham said the biggest enemy
[56:35] he had was william branham
[56:39] he said
[56:40] you need to let loose and let god too
[56:44] many times we try to take it into our
[56:46] hands and see what we can do about it
[56:49] we think if we can get it figured out
[56:50] then we'll have that peace
[56:54] if we can get our plans on order
[56:56] then we figure well once i got my plans
[56:58] all down know what i'm going to do then
[57:00] i'm going to have some peace
[57:02] but friends you know what
[57:03] this whole world wasn't set up under
[57:05] your plans
[57:08] this whole world was created under god's
[57:10] plans
[57:12] mankind was created under god's plan and
[57:15] in god's way
[57:16] god created the heavens and the earth in
[57:19] his way according to his plans
[57:22] man's tried to alter things and make
[57:24] things according to their plans and it
[57:26] just won't work out here not long ago
[57:28] they took and they transplanted a pig's
[57:30] heart into a man it didn't work he died
[57:36] that wasn't the way god intended
[57:38] it but i'll tell you one thing i know a
[57:41] great physician who can create a new
[57:44] heart without ever even opening your
[57:46] cavity
[57:48] i know a god that can set it straight
[57:52] without you ever even have to go through
[57:54] anesthesia
[58:01] my goodness if a pig's heart's the
[58:02] closest they can get to man we're
[58:04] hurting
[58:06] if we're going to depend on man but god
[58:08] had his own plans
[58:11] and god created man he spoke him into
[58:13] existence
[58:15] then he went down and and and took from
[58:18] the dirt
[58:19] and the elements
[58:20] and he created a body for man to live in
[58:24] and you know some friends god created
[58:26] that body to live forever
[58:28] it was perfect
[58:30] adam was never going to grow old eve was
[58:33] never going to grow old
[58:36] they were never going to die
[58:41] you say well could they get cut yeah but
[58:44] friends your body today testifies it'll
[58:46] heal itself
[58:48] you get a cut you just put something on
[58:50] it put a band-aid around the next thing
[58:51] you know it's mended
[58:54] that's god's creation that's god's plan
[59:03] man can take and say well i i'll make a
[59:06] uh something to help you along you know
[59:09] but god can grow legs
[59:14] god can grow eyes
[59:17] like that that young girl that came up
[59:19] there and didn't have any eyes and
[59:20] brother brandon prayed for and he said
[59:22] and said she went to walk away and he
[59:24] said just a minute i forgot to ask you
[59:26] what color of eyes you wanted
[59:29] that's god that's god's plan
[59:34] amen
[59:36] we've got to let go as long as you got
[59:38] yourself in the way god can't do
[59:40] anything
[59:43] brother ram says i just i got to get out
[59:46] of the way and then god can go to work
[59:53] lay aside those weights he said
[59:55] you can't he says
[1:00:00] give time to old-fashioned heartfelt
[1:00:02] pouring out of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:04] until the holy ghost pours down upon
[1:00:06] your soul and you get beside yourself
[1:00:09] anybody ever got beside themselves
[1:00:12] you don't know you ain't paying
[1:00:14] attention to anybody else what's going
[1:00:16] on with them what they're doing in
[1:00:18] church anybody else raising their hand
[1:00:19] if they're saying it or not you've just
[1:00:21] got off beside yourself in a world all
[1:00:23] your own just you and jesus in a crowd
[1:00:25] of people you can do it no matter where
[1:00:27] you're at you don't got to be in church
[1:00:29] you can be wherever you are and just get
[1:00:31] along with the lord
[1:00:37] i i get out driving
[1:00:39] and you know i
[1:00:41] i get to drive and i get to thinking on
[1:00:43] the things of the lord and and it just
[1:00:45] goes into automatic pilot wherever i
[1:00:47] went the last time i was driving that's
[1:00:49] where i end up
[1:00:51] that might not have been where i
[1:00:52] intended to go but that's where i end up
[1:00:56] and when i got my co-pilot with me
[1:00:59] she'll say
[1:01:00] uh you were supposed to turn here
[1:01:03] remember you're going to the bank
[1:01:09] but you can get along with just you and
[1:01:10] jesus
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] he said
[1:01:14] you know you can't be with yourself and
[1:01:17] with jesus too you can't you have to
[1:01:19] find out the biggest enemy you got
[1:01:22] if i can get william branham out of the
[1:01:24] way
[1:01:25] think about this now
[1:01:27] if i can get william branham out of the
[1:01:29] way jesus can have a wonderful time
[1:01:34] hallelujah
[1:01:35] you know that's what we need to do when
[1:01:36] we get in service we need to get ourself
[1:01:38] out of the way
[1:01:40] it's our self that's hindering us from
[1:01:42] having a good service it's our self
[1:01:44] that's hindering us from from being able
[1:01:46] to feel the presence of god when it
[1:01:49] comes down
[1:01:51] get yourself out of the way he said
[1:01:53] brother adam how do you see visions he
[1:01:55] said i get myself out of the way and
[1:01:58] then it just happens it's god he said
[1:02:01] it's not me it's god in the
[1:02:04] man hallelujah
[1:02:11] he said but the biggest enemy i got is
[1:02:13] william branham he's always in my way
[1:02:17] he's always in god's way he always gets
[1:02:21] in god's way
[1:02:22] he's too tired
[1:02:25] he don't want to do this he don't want
[1:02:27] to do that
[1:02:29] if i can crucify that guy then god can
[1:02:31] use me
[1:02:34] how many times you know you feel well
[1:02:36] i'm just too tired to do this
[1:02:38] boy that's just a hassle i don't feel
[1:02:39] like doing that
[1:02:41] what is it it's your own flesh getting
[1:02:43] in your way but you need to crucify that
[1:02:46] flesh
[1:02:48] die out to it
[1:02:51] like i said the other day you only got
[1:02:53] one time to be mortal and that's now
[1:03:03] you imagine when
[1:03:05] the children of israel got down there
[1:03:06] and where they had them egyptian
[1:03:08] taskmasters that had been whipping them
[1:03:11] and forcing them to do things then they
[1:03:13] got down there and got on the other side
[1:03:15] of the red sea
[1:03:17] and then the red sea fell in and just
[1:03:20] drowned all their taskmasters
[1:03:23] no wonder they had a hallelujah
[1:03:25] breakdown
[1:03:26] it ain't no wonder that moses began to
[1:03:28] sing it's no wonder that that marian
[1:03:32] picked up her tambourine and began to
[1:03:34] dance and the daughters of god began to
[1:03:36] dance before the lord why they were
[1:03:39] having a glorious time their enemy had
[1:03:42] been destroyed and that's what we need

[1:03:59] many times
[1:04:02] you know
[1:04:03] we're human
[1:04:05] and we'll get maybe a pain i hear
[1:04:07] some uh last year some months for months
[1:04:11] and months i had this pain in the back
[1:04:14] of my head
[1:04:15] and it wouldn't go away
[1:04:17] i'd take tylenol whatever else and i was
[1:04:19] going to the doctor and the pain
[1:04:20] wouldn't go and it was just there all
[1:04:22] the time
[1:04:24] and i was getting to where i was
[1:04:25] learning to live with it just go on and
[1:04:28] do what i needed to do with the pain
[1:04:29] there every day i got up every night i
[1:04:32] went to bed the pain was just there and
[1:04:34] you know there was a little voice in my
[1:04:35] shoulder and kept telling me you know
[1:04:36] what you've got some kind of tumor or
[1:04:38] something in your head and that's why
[1:04:40] it's causing you all this pain but i
[1:04:42] said i'm not going to accept that
[1:04:47] because i know that death can't take me
[1:04:50] till it's my time to go
[1:04:53] and it ain't my time to go until god's
[1:04:55] finished with me and as long as god's
[1:04:58] using me then i've got something to do

[1:05:25] went back started he went to the new
[1:05:26] doctors
[1:05:29] finally got it under control and the
[1:05:30] pain left
[1:05:32] i said see there devil
[1:05:35] it wasn't no tumor
[1:05:39] i'm
[1:05:39] you might want me to fall over dead but
[1:05:41] i'm not going to
[1:05:44] not yet
[1:05:45] brother branham said
[1:05:48] he said the devil hates me
[1:05:51] and i know he hates you too
[1:05:54] and he's my enemy
[1:05:56] but as long as god is my friend i don't
[1:05:59] have to fear the devil
[1:06:01] i'll just drive him back
[1:06:03] just take the word of god and move him
[1:06:05] right on back out of the place that he
[1:06:08] thinks he's holding and he has no thr
[1:06:10] strongholds he's absolutely legally
[1:06:13] defeated in every place
[1:06:16] the devil hasn't got one legal right to
[1:06:20] anywhere
[1:06:21] he's just a devil
[1:06:26] he hasn't got a legal right to any man
[1:06:29] that's accepted the promise of jesus
[1:06:31] christ he's whipped yes sir he swept in
[1:06:34] sickness he swept in disappointments he
[1:06:37] swept in everything he swept in death he
[1:06:40] can't scare me he can't scare you that's
[1:06:43] all he is is a big old shadow
[1:06:47] he's just the devil

[1:06:53] praise be to god
[1:06:57] hallelujah
[1:07:01] second corinthians
[1:07:04] chapter 10 verse 4.
[1:07:17] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:07:20] carnal
[1:07:21] but mighty through god to the pulling
[1:07:23] down of strongholds
[1:07:26] we're not facing the devil with carnal
[1:07:28] weapons
[1:07:29] we're not facing our enemy with carnal
[1:07:31] weapons
[1:07:33] you know carnal weapons uh man
[1:07:35] progressed with them first they started
[1:07:37] out with stones and then you know they
[1:07:39] progressed putting them together making
[1:07:41] some kind of weapon out of them and then
[1:07:42] they put a stick and a stone together
[1:07:43] and made an arrow you know and then they
[1:07:46] made a spear and then they realized well
[1:07:48] if i put a a a stick to a string and and
[1:07:51] pull it back well i've got a bow and i
[1:07:53] can shoot that arrow and then they
[1:07:54] progress from there onto muskets you
[1:07:57] know if i pack this ball down in here on
[1:07:59] some top of some powder some black
[1:08:01] powder then it'll shoot off the end of
[1:08:03] this and then then they progress from
[1:08:05] there to the to the remington you know
[1:08:08] and they had uh a 22 and then they
[1:08:11] progressed from there and then they had
[1:08:12] the 38 and then they had different
[1:08:14] things you know and then shotguns and
[1:08:15] then they they had a machine gun and and
[1:08:18] then they had the atomic bomb but god
[1:08:21] gave us the best weapon he could at the
[1:08:23] start god didn't give us something just
[1:08:26] to suffice and get by with and say well
[1:08:28] i'll think of something better later on
[1:08:30] but god give us the greatest thing he
[1:08:32] could give mankind and that was prayer
[1:08:36] prayer changes things
[1:08:38] prayer can even change the mind of god
[1:08:41] it did one time a man was was told by
[1:08:43] the prophet you're going to die he went
[1:08:45] god turned his face to the wall cried
[1:08:47] before god and prayed and god come down
[1:08:50] and said i'll give you a little more
[1:08:51] time
[1:08:56] prayer is more powerful than an atomic
[1:08:58] weapon
[1:09:02] hallelujah
[1:09:05] what we need to do is humble ourselves
[1:09:11] we're not there's no big eyes and little
[1:09:12] hues humble ourselves and get down
[1:09:14] before god and pray
[1:09:17] and you know it doesn't matter how it
[1:09:19] doesn't matter what position you're in
[1:09:21] when you pray
[1:09:22] some people think they got to kneel down
[1:09:24] to pray you don't have to kneel down to
[1:09:25] pray unless that's just what you're
[1:09:27] feeling
[1:09:28] you know we come to the altar and we
[1:09:30] kneel before the lord and that's fine
[1:09:32] but you can pray in a prostate position

[1:15:57] going through something doesn't mean
[1:15:58] you've done anything wrong
[1:16:03] it's just god
[1:16:05] showing
[1:16:06] what
[1:16:07] you will do
[1:16:10] god's not doing it just to find out what
[1:16:13] you'll do
[1:16:21] god had plans
[1:16:23] for you to be on this earth
[1:16:26] and he had plans for what he wanted you
[1:16:28] to do and each one of you has got a
[1:16:29] purpose to serve

[1:16:57] then he caught a disease and died
[1:17:00] and people begin to say well it's
[1:17:02] because he got off of the word
[1:17:05] and so god took him
[1:17:07] brother rem said that's not slow
[1:17:10] he said death can't take you until god's
[1:17:12] finished with you whatever purpose god
[1:17:15] sent you here for until that's been
[1:17:17] resolved you're here
