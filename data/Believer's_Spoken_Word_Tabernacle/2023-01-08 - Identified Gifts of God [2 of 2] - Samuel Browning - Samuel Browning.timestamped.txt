[16:16] request here that
[16:20] brother Donnie had made known
[16:23] regarding his daughter she goes for
[16:25] more treatment sister Erica's youngest
[16:28] daughter she's been dealing with cancer
[16:31] for a few years
[16:33] and she goes back there's certain
[16:36] treatments they're doing with nuclear
[16:38] treatments and the body responded to it
[16:40] some months ago and so he just asked we

[17:24] him
[17:25] every need
[17:28] he looks at it just the same way

[17:33] differentiation he just said I'm the

[21:21] amen
[21:22] amen don't you love him
[21:25] and so good to be in the house of the
[21:27] Lord once again and it's good to see
[21:30] each one of you and um
[21:32] it really is because sometimes we go
[21:35] through things you know and we're we're
[21:37] out and we're in different uh you know
[21:39] when you get into this time of the year
[21:42] there might be certain things that we
[21:44] look forward to in this time of the year
[21:45] but sickness is not one of them
[21:47] and um
[21:49] you know it's just one of those things
[21:51] sometimes that God brings things back to
[21:53] your mind and you know as you maybe
[21:55] don't feel as well and you know you
[21:57] start thinking about other needs you've
[21:59] been praying for a request that have
[22:01] been continually made known you say oh
[22:03] my Lord move for that move for that
[22:06] situation or move for that need you know
[22:08] and you know God God brings us into
[22:11] those times those are little reminders
[22:13] you know
[22:14] I don't know how how you feel you know
[22:16] but uh you know it's it's funny I was
[22:18] talking to my wife about this and you
[22:20] know just from some
[22:21] weeks back and I said you know when you
[22:24] when you get this it's odd because you
[22:26] go from feeling well to where you're
[22:28] battling whether it's sinus or whatever
[22:30] and I said you thoughts start coming in
[22:32] your mind like wow what was it like to
[22:34] feel uh completely you know where you're
[22:37] not walking around and you know you know
[22:39] what I mean talking funny and everything
[22:41] you start thinking like that and you're
[22:43] you know your sleep and everything's
[22:45] broke up but it's in those it's amazing
[22:47] how just in that moment of time we think
[22:49] we think in that way and I tell you what
[22:51] I I believe that's only just a little
[22:53] bit of what really when that life has
[22:56] entered into our hearts there's a
[22:58] groaning there's a release that life to
[23:00] witnesses that there's a there's a
[23:02] landing on the river amen there's
[23:05] something more real you know and uh it
[23:08] just it caused us many times just to go
[23:10] into prayer you know for others and we
[23:12] see those needs and I just as you're
[23:14] turning into scriptures to Matthew
[23:16] chapter 2.
[23:19] um I just ask you just to if you just
[23:21] just bring praying in your heart for me
[23:24] this morning I really didn't last night
[23:26] I don't feel bad or nothing like that
[23:27] it's just sometimes Saturday nights are
[23:29] always sometimes a little rough and it
[23:31] was just a little bit um
[23:33] and more different and I know I'm
[23:35] speaking to others too that no doubt
[23:37] didn't get any sleep or rest as well so
[23:39] may God just help us together this
[23:41] morning amen what it is I don't want to
[23:44] get in the way that's always my that's
[23:46] always my desire I don't want to be in
[23:48] the way
[23:49] um remember the meetings next weekend
[23:51] with brother Trevor Edmond on Sunday
[23:55] um the regular service in the morning
[23:56] and then the youth service in the in the
[23:59] afternoon there at five and uh you know
[24:02] everything we look at the weather I
[24:03] tried to look at the weather
[24:05] um you know and really I don't like to
[24:07] do any too much of anything in January
[24:10] here in Ohio
[24:11] um but um you know brother Trevor was
[24:13] going to be up this area any household
[24:16] we just wanted to go ahead and do it so
[24:18] look we'll keep a look on that and and
[24:20] uh like just like when brother Wayne was
[24:22] here I think the first part of November
[24:24] and you know even the older ones you you
[24:26] came and you helped and you pulled on
[24:28] the on the gift of God and we're just
[24:30] expecting amen great things from the
[24:32] Lord Amen brother Trevor was here with
[24:34] us last last January and brother Trevor
[24:38] just has a wonderful Ministry really has
[24:40] worked really right down there at
[24:42] brother Nathan Bryant's with the young
[24:44] people but in the youth camps uh to me
[24:47] just brother brother Trevor is just a
[24:49] tremendous tremendous brother and just
[24:51] has a to me a real precious gift with
[24:53] even with the young people so
[24:55] amen let's just let's just pray about
[24:57] that will you do that
[24:59] amen
[25:01] now how many are going to pray for me
[25:02] when I preach this morning
[25:05] okay I run needed Matthew chapter 2
[25:08] verse 9 only a few verses will let you
[25:10] be seated
[25:11] the scripture said when they had heard
[25:14] the king
[25:16] they departed and lulled the star which
[25:18] they saw in the east
[25:20] went before them till it came and stood
[25:24] over where the young child was
[25:27] and when they saw the star they rejoiced
[25:30] with exceeding great joy
[25:33] remember that star it had it was already
[25:36] leading them supernaturally and when
[25:40] they went to Jerusalem
[25:42] well the star went out there wasn't they
[25:45] even in Jerusalem they didn't know what
[25:47] was taking place
[25:48] but you see God was guiding and
[25:51] directing the wise men the Magi he was
[25:54] guiding them and they had been on a
[25:56] two-year journey and God was directing
[25:58] them a man to this place and so when
[26:01] they leave Jerusalem here they they see
[26:04] the star once again and begin to Rejoice
[26:06] verse 11. and when they were coming to
[26:09] the house they saw the young child with
[26:12] Mary his mother and fell down and
[26:15] worshiped him and when they had opened
[26:17] their Treasures they presented unto him
[26:20] gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh
[26:24] being warned of God in a dream that they
[26:26] should not return to Herod they departed
[26:28] into their own country another way amen
[26:31] may God bless you bless the reading of
[26:33] the word as you're being seated
[26:36] I just um
[26:39] really with just some time here from
[26:42] back in the first part of December just
[26:45] some things that the Lord was just relay
[26:47] just dealing with my heart and a lot of
[26:50] groupings of messages that I've been
[26:52] listening to and just really you know
[26:55] sometimes it's uh you just are looking
[26:58] always in all times looking to God that
[27:00] the Lord would help you to be able to
[27:02] convey the things that he's inspiring
[27:04] and and putting forth in that moment and
[27:07] I want to just speak here just for a few
[27:10] moments on identified gifts of God
[27:13] identified gifts of God and I think that
[27:16] when we are looking at this I want you
[27:19] to hold something in your heart here
[27:20] then I want to just say that as as a
[27:24] believer
[27:25] we are equipped to identify
[27:28] to fulfill and to display the word of
[27:31] God
[27:32] we are equipped for that for that very
[27:35] purpose and I say that as we look at
[27:38] God's divine orchestration within
[27:41] everything and we think of we think of
[27:44] gifts the Bible would say regarding
[27:46] gifts it would say that gifts and
[27:49] callings are without repentance we we
[27:51] realize that repentance itself doesn't
[27:53] even bring the gift even if a person is
[27:56] a preacher or song it's already in them
[27:58] it's without repentance and so we
[28:01] understand that that that can be present
[28:03] there and that's the same way it is with
[28:06] the real gift of God that we want to
[28:09] speak of here is that even of our soul
[28:12] which is the attribute of almighty God
[28:14] that's what the prophet would identify
[28:17] in things that are to be says that's the
[28:19] real gift is that soul that come from
[28:21] God because it's that part that what the
[28:24] quickening power has come in order to
[28:27] Quicken and make alive it becomes a
[28:30] place that Christ himself can reflect
[28:33] his own life and his glory through and
[28:36] that's what we desire in our life
[28:38] there's something there's a longing
[28:39] there's a drawing there's a desire
[28:41] within our hearts and you know sometimes
[28:45] we desire well when many times we want
[28:47] to convey or have our thoughts conveyed
[28:50] and I'm sure probably you're like me
[28:51] many times I sometimes I feel like well
[28:54] I don't have the words to say what I'm
[28:56] thinking or how to put all this together
[28:58] and I'm not just talking about
[28:59] ministering but sometimes when you're
[29:01] trying to express something but I'm glad
[29:04] that God looks deeper than what words or
[29:08] words we can or cannot come up with but
[29:10] God looks down into our heart I always
[29:13] think about that little boy who was
[29:15] praying you know and the guy walked by
[29:18] the field and said all you're saying is
[29:19] your ABCs and he says well he said I I
[29:22] don't know exactly what to say he said
[29:24] but I figure if I send up the alphabet
[29:26] he'll know he'll know what words by
[29:29] looking at my heart and and that's how
[29:31] we feel we we come into times even in
[29:34] prayer and other times and I'll just say
[29:37] many times Lord I know what's on my
[29:39] heart but I don't even know how to
[29:40] articulate and I'm glad that God you
[29:43] know God's not about the these and the
[29:45] vows I appreciate you know the King
[29:46] James Bible but God is not asking us to
[29:49] be a V and a thou and that we've got
[29:51] every word just right I think like
[29:53] brother Branham talked about when he
[29:54] went to pray you know when brother Brahm
[29:56] said I didn't even know how to approach
[29:57] him so he wrote a letter dear sir and
[29:59] you know the reality of approaching God
[30:02] it's just that simple we don't have to
[30:04] put on any vernacular or try to put
[30:07] something on or you know well I can
[30:09] quote this and quote just just talk to
[30:11] him like you talked to your buddy I I we
[30:14] understand there's a right approach we
[30:15] understand and that's a reverence we're
[30:17] coming to him that he knows just what we
[30:20] have need of and we can speak to him in
[30:23] a relationship we're not strangers we're
[30:26] not foreigners he is our friend amen we
[30:30] are his children we are his offspring so
[30:32] I believe with all of my heart that
[30:34] these are things that sometimes that
[30:36] what we cannot articulate but yet our
[30:39] thoughts will will be expressed and so
[30:41] when you think about our thoughts and
[30:44] trying to formulate or trying to even
[30:46] describe of what Jesus Christ would mean
[30:50] to you and I and and what it would mean
[30:52] to us even in this moment even thinking
[30:55] about the wise men as they were on their
[30:58] Journey you remember that here on that
[31:00] Journey when they saw supernaturally
[31:02] that star and you know it's the same God
[31:05] who led the children of Israel and God
[31:07] knew well the rest to everybody else it
[31:10] passed over observatories it it passed
[31:13] right through and let's just say for
[31:15] example in that hour they might have had
[31:17] a Life magazine that would have taken a
[31:19] picture of it but and people could have
[31:22] you know awed about it but it didn't
[31:24] have the same significance for everybody
[31:26] else it didn't have the same meaning it
[31:29] didn't have the same holder or the same
[31:31] pool or the same draw but but to these
[31:35] men it was something different when they
[31:38] saw the unusual and the phenomenon they
[31:40] were directed right back to the writings
[31:43] how did God will move in our lives to
[31:47] direct us back to the word the Bible
[31:49] said he'll bring all things back to our
[31:51] remembrance and how that they were drawn
[31:53] back to that place of knowing that there
[31:56] was a man Among Us by the name of Daniel
[31:59] now they didn't live in the time of
[32:00] Daniel but there was that that how that
[32:03] God had kept that word alive right there
[32:06] in the court and they would go back to
[32:08] that and there was that event and they
[32:10] could see that is what was spoken the
[32:13] scripture a star shall arise out of
[32:15] Jacob and they were moving under that
[32:18] under that direction and it was
[32:20] something that moved in their heart upon
[32:23] the gifts and what they were to bring in
[32:25] that time you know God didn't have to
[32:27] tell them as far as to come down and say
[32:30] you bring this and you bring that that
[32:32] no more than he had to do that and when
[32:35] it came to building the Tabernacle in
[32:37] the wilderness God never had to tell
[32:39] them you give the black onyx stones and
[32:42] you give the goat hair and and you give
[32:44] the blue and and you give the red God
[32:46] didn't have to tell him the only thing
[32:47] that happened was is when the vision
[32:50] could be made known then through that
[32:53] Vision being opened the inspiration
[32:56] would strike the hearts of the people
[32:58] and they would begin to release what
[33:01] they had in their treasures and you know
[33:03] the tremendous thing about it is they
[33:06] didn't have to go get something they
[33:08] only had to release what was already in
[33:12] their possession
[33:13] glory be to God oh my think about this
[33:17] how brother Banner would place it in
[33:19] this way he said the things that we
[33:21] bring to him identifies what our
[33:24] thoughts is about him he said if you
[33:28] believe it with all your heart every
[33:29] word of it you'll identify it by giving
[33:32] all that you have to it but if you
[33:35] believe it's a good place to associate
[33:38] with better people around church and
[33:40] things like that then you know just a
[33:42] few social hours with the congregation
[33:44] or something but if you believe it with
[33:47] all your heart how many believe with all
[33:48] their heart
[33:49] if you believe with all your heart then
[33:51] you give everything that's in you to it
[33:55] and it identifies you that you truly
[33:58] believe the message that you believe it
[34:01] to be the truth
[34:02] now you know brother Brandon goes into
[34:04] this how some people can say I can only
[34:07] believe this much or I can only believe
[34:09] this much and he begins to break that
[34:12] down between you know and referring back
[34:15] to the message that he's preached just
[34:16] some time ago on Believers make
[34:18] Believers and unbelievers and and to
[34:21] recognize that you know that not one
[34:23] person or in that category can help or
[34:26] change or be something different than
[34:29] than they already are but but to a
[34:31] Believer there's something that longs
[34:34] for God
[34:36] uh you know it's just one of those
[34:38] things that it's not ever comes to its
[34:42] place for a believer that says I've had
[34:44] enough but there's something with a
[34:46] believer that says I want more now
[34:49] there's sometimes where there's things
[34:50] that we in our Humanity can allow other
[34:53] things to get in the way but as a
[34:55] Believer we can never be satisfied when
[34:58] we allow the world to get between us and
[35:01] God it'll never satisfy something's just
[35:04] not right you it doesn't feel right it's
[35:07] just not right and then you know they
[35:09] say what do we have to do we'll step
[35:10] right out of Jerusalem and just start
[35:13] looking for the star again because the
[35:16] same God that has guided you this far
[35:18] he's here to guide you the rest of the
[35:21] way
[35:21] and these gifts that they had in that
[35:25] hour it was these gifts were so fitting
[35:28] they were just exactly that would
[35:31] describe the very the very one who was
[35:34] upon Earth in that time the deity being
[35:37] that of his own life it was God that was
[35:41] tabernacled in his creation it was that
[35:44] of Frankincense which would be that of
[35:47] service unto the the word of God unto
[35:50] almighty God Jehovah's servant and it
[35:52] would be murdered that it would be that
[35:54] of a of death and a dying and to bring a
[35:57] ransom for you and I and to bring
[35:59] Redemption and this is why when brother
[36:02] Brandon would point this out and it's so
[36:04] it's so important because Satan hates
[36:07] this Revelation that God and Christ are
[36:10] one he hates that Revelation because his
[36:14] desire the reason he hates that is
[36:16] because God in Christ are becoming one
[36:18] and that being manifest it is a a signal
[36:23] to the believer that this is my portion
[36:26] oh my like David said our lines have
[36:30] fallen in Pleasant places this is my
[36:33] portion that's what belongs to me what
[36:36] is it it's God's own life God and Christ
[36:40] are one
[36:41] amen this is why when we look at the
[36:44] scripture brother random would say Jesus
[36:47] was God in the form of man I want you to
[36:49] listen to this statement now he said he
[36:52] wasn't nothing less than God he was God
[36:54] manifested in flesh he was the creator
[36:58] in his own creation and then he repeats
[37:02] in about a few two or three times listen
[37:04] this he was the creator in his creation
[37:08] by the creation for the creation he was
[37:13] the creator in his creation by his
[37:16] creation for his creation it all comes
[37:19] back to God in the whole thing he was
[37:21] the cree Creator in so much that he was
[37:24] God he was a being on earth a being of
[37:27] time which would mean that he must have
[37:30] had a beginning therefore he created
[37:33] himself a body to live in
[37:37] Mary never produced that
[37:40] nobody else produced that you you say
[37:42] what are we saying well look what we
[37:44] want to say is what God was saying with
[37:46] what he did God was letting us know that
[37:49] I don't need you to produce anything but
[37:52] I already have provided for myself and
[37:55] the only thing I need you to do is just
[37:58] release to me when you recognize me just
[38:01] release what I've already placed in you
[38:05] glory be to God we didn't bring this
[38:08] about
[38:09] thank God for Sunday school thank God
[38:11] for the message of the hour being played
[38:13] in our homes thank God for devotion
[38:16] thank God for all of that but that is
[38:19] not what has brought this about in our
[38:21] life as far as the deposit of that seed
[38:24] we were always Sons and Daughters of God
[38:27] whether you were in Sunday school or you
[38:30] weren't in Sunday School
[38:32] some of us didn't have the choice of the
[38:34] backgrounds that we come from but oh now
[38:36] how thankful we are for the grace of God
[38:39] that has found us and brought us to
[38:42] himself
[38:44] therefore he created himself a body to
[38:47] live in God himself created a body for
[38:50] himself that by his creation he might
[38:54] save the Lost creation that he had
[38:57] created so the body of Jesus Christ is
[39:00] the building and Tabernacle of the
[39:02] Living God remember when Paul was on the
[39:04] road to Damascus and hear the light hear
[39:08] the pillar fire showed up he who are you
[39:10] Lord he said I'm Jesus who you persecute
[39:13] we know that he had already the death
[39:15] burial Ascension and the Holy Ghost had
[39:17] come back the same life that was there
[39:20] dwelling in that body the same God was
[39:22] now dwelling in a body of Believers that
[39:25] he had redeemed and assembled together
[39:27] remember when Jesus said Upon This Rock
[39:31] I will build my church so the Church of
[39:34] the Living God is the building and the
[39:37] Tabernacle of God that is built by
[39:40] divine revelation as a matter of fact
[39:42] the whole coming of the Lord Jesus was
[39:44] was purposed for Redemption he is the
[39:48] savior of the body is that right Peter
[39:52] would describe it like this that we are
[39:54] Lively stones that are built up a
[39:57] spiritual house Paul would say it like
[39:59] this we are building and fitly framed
[40:02] together as a habitation of God through
[40:05] the spirit and how would you want to say
[40:07] it like this it is God that is
[40:10] orchestrated every aspect and the coming
[40:13] to our position he has orchestrated
[40:17] every member to come into its ordained
[40:21] position
[40:22] he's not left that to a man
[40:25] you see even in the vision when brother
[40:27] Brown's communicating of how that God
[40:29] would reveal a vision of this baby is
[40:31] going to be healed or this person even
[40:34] though it was declared in the vision
[40:35] brother Randall could not tell anybody
[40:38] you go sit here put the handkerchief
[40:40] here put the put the glasses there but
[40:43] the same God heal which was which is and
[40:47] which shall come that same God was there
[40:51] and what was it it was God moving in
[40:55] segments of time to bring everything in
[40:58] position the prophet showed us when he
[41:00] went up there to pray for that little
[41:02] baby you know that time he rushed in
[41:04] right away and prayed for the baby and
[41:06] the baby was actually more sick but
[41:09] after he prayed for it what was God
[41:11] showing God wasn't just showing that to
[41:13] the prophet that was showing you and I
[41:15] we still battle with impatience in our
[41:17] life we still battle when we look at our
[41:20] own life or maybe on the lives of others
[41:22] but God was showing you and I and
[41:24] reminding us us you must be patient
[41:27] because whatever I have spoken I will
[41:31] fulfill it in my season and in my time
[41:35] that's the same way with every member of
[41:37] the body same way in every individual
[41:40] aspect in our lives
[41:42] oh God help us to be energized by that
[41:46] every member think about it is ordained
[41:49] every member of the body of Jesus Christ
[41:52] he is ordained in position and guided by
[41:54] the Holy Ghost yeah you know brother
[41:57] Brown will pick this up but science sets
[41:59] it out as well when they can take cells
[42:01] from from embryo cells from an unborn
[42:05] fetus and they'll inject those cells and
[42:08] brother Brandon would pick it up he said
[42:09] of wow he said there's an intelligence
[42:12] that will cause the thyroid cells in
[42:15] that embryo to go to the thyroid and the
[42:19] liver will go to the Livery you see what
[42:21] it is is how it's orchestrated by
[42:24] almighty god brother van would say it
[42:26] like this some intelligence guides those
[42:29] animal cells exactly to the right place
[42:32] that intelligence accepts those cells
[42:36] and puts them in the right place let me
[42:39] just say this the same intelligence that
[42:41] does that in the natural body is the
[42:44] same shall be light
[42:47] glory be to God it's the inspiration of
[42:50] God that moves down in the hour to catch
[42:53] the people of the hour and his seed Not
[42:55] seeds but seed
[42:58] is that right
[42:59] and his seed being that of the royal
[43:01] seed of Christ
[43:04] and that's why the promises God makes
[43:08] known those promises in each time and
[43:11] every generation and this is if I can
[43:13] just refer to it like this this is why
[43:15] with the bride of Jesus Christ brother
[43:18] Brown would say in plain language the
[43:20] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[43:22] eternally though not expressed until
[43:25] each came forth in the designated
[43:28] decreed season and as each member would
[43:31] come come forth it'd become expressed
[43:34] and took its place in the body and
[43:37] though this pride is the literal spoken
[43:39] word see Bride she is feminine in
[43:42] designation she is also called the body
[43:44] of Christ it's apparent that she ought
[43:46] to be called that because she was
[43:48] predestinated in him she comes from the
[43:51] same Source was eternal with him and is
[43:54] now manifesting God in a many-membered
[43:58] body whereas once God was manifested in
[44:01] one member even our lord Jesus just
[44:04] Christ
[44:05] remember the purpose was is God desired
[44:09] to get back in man
[44:13] that's Fellowship right there God
[44:16] desired to get back into man and that
[44:19] fellowship with man and then through
[44:21] that then restore everything back as it
[44:25] was you know the Bible would say in
[44:27] First Corinthians chapter 12 for the
[44:30] body is one I know we know these
[44:32] scriptures but it's very key here the
[44:34] body is one and hath many members and
[44:36] all the members of that body being many
[44:38] are one body so also is Christ for by
[44:42] one Spirit one intelligence are we
[44:44] baptized into one body whether we be
[44:47] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[44:50] free and have been all made to drink
[44:52] into one spirit all like that so the
[44:55] spirit of God is not we're looking at
[44:56] our class he's not looking at rich or
[44:59] poor he's not looking at your background
[45:02] as far as in this life no he's looking
[45:04] much deeper he's looking to that into
[45:07] that of the depths of what really
[45:09] belongs to him
[45:11] amen so notice for the body is not one
[45:14] member but many so the body I mean you
[45:16] can look just at your body there is
[45:18] every member is diverse I mean you know
[45:21] the hand that looks different than the
[45:22] from the foot and the leg and even the
[45:24] internal organs within the body and yet
[45:27] each one has its distinct purpose you
[45:30] know there's not one member no matter
[45:32] how small or maybe insignificant it
[45:35] cannot say to another member of the body
[45:37] you are not needed or you are
[45:40] insignificant now you know the hand will
[45:43] not understand what the heart does and
[45:45] the heart's not necessarily going to
[45:47] understand you know maybe what my
[45:49] kidneys do or or you know the arm or the
[45:52] muscles or others of the things but each
[45:54] one has its parts you know there's
[45:56] things going on in me and you right now
[45:58] that you don't see but you know his
[46:01] heart's pumping you know his is his
[46:04] lungs aren't working you can tell that
[46:06] right now though you cannot see my lungs
[46:09] or see my heart but yet I am benefiting
[46:12] from them and yet every one every one of
[46:15] our members in the natural is so diverse
[46:18] one from another and that's the same way
[46:21] it is in the body of Jesus Christ
[46:23] sometimes those are some of the biggest
[46:25] Hang-Ups that we have is with the
[46:28] differentiation or the diversity within
[46:32] the members but we must come back and
[46:34] focus on it is the Oneness of Jesus
[46:37] Christ that is working in a many member
[46:41] body
[46:42] amen we are all different and we all
[46:45] have different purposes I mean you can
[46:47] even line up this platform with pastors
[46:49] and every Pastor is going to be
[46:52] different and we're all going to have
[46:54] our own peculiarities as well as here
[46:57] within this congregation and in an
[46:59] understanding that God has said it that
[47:02] way
[47:03] oh my you know uh let me just say it
[47:06] like this sometimes the very things that
[47:08] we are we are trying to get rid of and
[47:11] God is letting you and I know you're not
[47:13] going to get rid of that part about you
[47:16] it's going to bother you until the
[47:18] change of the body but what I have
[47:20] equipped you with is my life so that you
[47:23] might recognize it and and recognize
[47:26] greater is he that's in you that's
[47:29] overcoming
[47:31] right sometimes we're praying and I want
[47:33] this corner I want that gone and I'm
[47:35] talking about the weaknesses or the
[47:37] things that we can look at in our
[47:39] makeups or our temperaments but remember
[47:41] those are opportunities for overcoming
[47:48] so the whole thing is God becoming
[47:50] tangible let me just try to hurry here
[47:52] it's all as as Ephesians would say every
[47:56] one of us is given Grace according to
[47:58] the measure
[47:59] of the gift of Christ in Romans 12 3
[48:03] Paul said I say through the grace given
[48:06] to me to every man that is among you not
[48:08] to think of himself more highly than he
[48:10] ought to think but to think soberly
[48:12] evidently that's something we had to be
[48:14] reminded of
[48:15] in the back there in the days of Paul
[48:17] they had to be reminded of it and we
[48:19] have to be reminded of it
[48:21] right sometimes not letting this go on
[48:24] as according as God hath dealt to every
[48:26] man The Measure of Faith in Romans 12 6
[48:30] he's given us gifts differing according
[48:33] to the grace that has given us whether
[48:35] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[48:38] the proportion of Faith so God has dealt
[48:41] to every man a Measure of Faith you know
[48:44] it's just like that when it comes into
[48:46] Israel coming into the land you remember
[48:48] when God is just a beautiful study but
[48:50] when God would actually go through and
[48:53] begin to identify the different tribes
[48:55] of Israel and he there would be
[48:57] characteristics that would be uh about
[49:01] them you know this would be over here
[49:02] but corn and oil and on and on it's just
[49:04] just a beautiful thing maybe God will
[49:06] allow us to take it some time and and
[49:07] bring it down and show it into our own
[49:09] natural lives because if you could take
[49:11] every one of the tribes of Israel and
[49:14] you put a problem before him and you
[49:16] surround every one of them with the 12
[49:17] tribes you will have 12 different
[49:19] perspectives on how to solve that
[49:22] problem why because they are all unique
[49:25] and there's El different it's diverse
[49:28] there would be certain things that
[49:30] Ephraim would approach him and NASA
[49:31] would approach different Judah would
[49:33] approach it different but you see God
[49:35] himself has so orchestrated and in that
[49:37] way that we need all of those
[49:40] perspectives that are under the
[49:42] leadership of one goal we do not if we
[49:45] got a goal that we start pulling away
[49:47] well I'm better than brother Joy because
[49:49] I see it this way or I'm better than
[49:51] brother then somehow we don't have the
[49:53] right goal somehow there's been a
[49:55] different Spirit that's entered in there
[49:57] and what that spirit is actually causing
[49:59] us to do is to stop and to block what
[50:03] God has called us to do we are a part of
[50:06] the body we are not the body we are a
[50:09] member in the body and God desires to
[50:12] use and move and flow through our lives
[50:16] as we'll yielded to him
[50:18] oh my sometimes the things that can get
[50:21] us hung up on other people is our
[50:23] thoughts about things and what's trying
[50:25] to straighten them out and figure this
[50:26] out and figure that out and in the sand
[50:28] at the same time Satan says gotcha
[50:30] because I've stopped your yielding to
[50:32] the throne of God I've got you looking
[50:34] at this worrying about this and worrying
[50:37] about that oh if we can realize the same
[50:39] intelligence that's dealing with my life
[50:41] Lord help me not to get my mind in
[50:44] things but to let me be under the same
[50:48] intelligence Lord because the same
[50:50] intelligence that is guiding me the same
[50:53] one that guided the wise men is the same
[50:56] one guiding my brother the same one
[50:58] guiding my sister
[51:00] well Mom this is why we cannot take one
[51:03] another's position that's why another
[51:05] brand would even tell us this is why he
[51:07] brought the adoption message that's one
[51:09] of the reasons he said is because how
[51:11] Joshua had divided up the land by divine
[51:13] inspiration coming under that same
[51:15] inspiration he says we always got that
[51:18] one is trying to take the other person's
[51:20] place or one is trying to say if you
[51:23] don't do it like I do it you're doing it
[51:24] wrong
[51:26] of course I'm sure we probably don't
[51:27] deal with that but anyhow
[51:33] they call them micromanagers I think
[51:35] that's what it is
[51:36] right
[51:38] Supernatural inspiration
[51:42] that's exactly what we are are Guided by
[51:44] and to think about when we would come
[51:46] here in this moment
[51:48] these these wise men were Guided by the
[51:52] inspiration of almighty God not only in
[51:55] their Journey but in what they were
[51:57] bringing and brother Brown would ask the
[51:59] question like this he said what are we
[52:02] doing here
[52:03] where do we come from or what business
[52:06] do we got being here we wasn't put here
[52:09] just by chance we were put here for a
[52:12] purpose and we must serve that purpose
[52:16] now can I can I be very clearly if your
[52:19] purpose was to be an art an artist or an
[52:21] art teacher let me guess where you what
[52:23] you'd be doing you're not going to find
[52:25] out the purpose by hanging down after
[52:27] you know at the local McDonald's joint
[52:30] you're going to be going to school for
[52:31] right
[52:32] so in other words in order for those
[52:34] purposes to come out it's got to come
[52:37] into His presence and see God knows that
[52:41] God knows that you or I can never find
[52:43] him he from the beginning has always
[52:47] been the one coming and searching out
[52:50] his children
[52:53] that's exactly right
[52:55] and every time when God makes known the
[52:58] purpose the longer you stay in the
[53:00] prince of God the more overwhelming and
[53:03] the more impossible that the purpose be
[53:06] schemes to be that you and I are called
[53:09] to fulfill but here's the secret if
[53:11] we'll just stay in the presence the same
[53:14] God that's unfolding the purpose is the
[53:17] same God to fulfill it
[53:20] so we want to just look at that here
[53:21] just a moment the Bible says that when
[53:24] these wise men came in Matthew 2 verse
[53:26] 11 I want you to notice when they came
[53:28] and they saw the young child not the
[53:30] baby the young child remember when when
[53:32] those wives when the Shepherds came it
[53:35] was in its infancy is that right but now
[53:38] when the wise men come it's standing on
[53:41] its feet
[53:42] it came as an infant this even this
[53:44] bride was born in infancy the prophet
[53:47] could point out an end time seed sign he
[53:49] said five stars have aligned in the
[53:52] heavens what is it it's an infant church
[53:54] that has been born upon this earth oh my
[53:58] it's the bright body of Jesus Christ but
[54:01] now when you and I as the word is
[54:03] bringing us and moving into that
[54:05] maturity the bride is not an infant the
[54:09] bride is not a toddler this same word
[54:12] that brought this church to a birth my
[54:15] mama it's the same word that's bringing
[54:18] this world into a birth pains this same
[54:21] word is the same word that has brought
[54:23] them a charity within just those few
[54:26] years to say not she will be him but she
[54:31] is him
[54:32] [Music]
[54:35] so it goes from infancy until where the
[54:38] bride is standing upon her feet
[54:40] Amen Let us be glad and rejoice for the
[54:43] marriage of the Lamb has come you don't
[54:44] marry an infant
[54:47] right
[54:49] you you you you you don't you don't do
[54:51] that and that Jesus wasn't going to do
[54:52] that either so it must be a fully
[54:54] matured woman that has come upon the
[54:57] scene by the presence of his life so
[55:00] notice the Bible says that when they
[55:02] fell down now notice when they got here
[55:04] I want you to catch this they have the
[55:06] gifts and those gifts are going to
[55:09] identify him and it's going to identify
[55:11] what they think about him it's also
[55:13] going to identify that truly they did
[55:16] see the supernatural because of what
[55:18] they are yielding and surrendering but
[55:20] before they ever presented their gifts
[55:22] they did something very important they
[55:25] fell down and worshiped
[55:28] you know there's a lot of times they're
[55:30] saying this is a real key there's things
[55:32] that we are Desiring in our life I don't
[55:35] say that there's not one person here
[55:37] that wouldn't say Lord I want more of
[55:40] you I want more of you in my life and we
[55:42] know what that entails that requires us
[55:45] giving more of ourselves and sometimes
[55:48] we can become so mechanical in those
[55:51] things and we fail upon the principle of
[55:53] the way that everything comes about is
[55:56] recognizing his presence and don't make
[55:59] it like as though caught up in the
[56:01] business of Life hurry up come on I
[56:03] gotta get this done come on put this in
[56:05] my life Jesus come on hurry and get this
[56:07] that's not how he works
[56:12] anybody else want to see it like that
[56:15] Lord I guess I'm the only honest one
[56:17] maybe in me and a couple other people
[56:20] right sometimes we want to see things we
[56:23] want to see things so quickly but the
[56:25] key what's the first thing is
[56:27] recognizing his presence
[56:30] what do I do when I get in his presence
[56:32] Fall Down and Worship Him
[56:36] he is worthy notice Revelation 5 when
[56:39] the book is taken what do you see it is
[56:42] a worship of King lamb that breaks out
[56:45] what do you see when it was revealed to
[56:48] the Shepherds it was the god lamb among
[56:51] them and they begin to worship the
[56:53] angels that sang were the morning Stars
[56:57] those same Angels now were singing upon
[57:00] Earth because Redemption what was in
[57:03] God's mind has now come down to the
[57:06] Earth
[57:07] and just so you understand that your
[57:10] life and my life is a song
[57:13] the Bible said when he took the book
[57:15] they sung a new song
[57:18] right
[57:20] and any song everybody knows this you
[57:23] don't just play a song with high notes
[57:26] every song has a mixture of low notes
[57:29] and high notes
[57:32] and even in this journey the new song
[57:35] does not remove the low notes
[57:38] but what it is it's victory in the low
[57:41] notes is victory in the high notes it's
[57:44] victory working when I don't feel like
[57:45] it's working if Victory is still working
[57:47] it's victory that draws me to submit
[57:50] myself it's victory it's a victory of
[57:53] Calvary that's working in my life that
[57:56] brings me to fall down and to worship
[57:59] you see this is a characteristic of the
[58:01] attributes of God all the way from
[58:04] Genesis to Revelations when you think
[58:06] about it Abraham when Abraham recognized
[58:09] this is somebody different I've seen a
[58:11] lot of men pass this way but this is
[58:13] difference Abraham had been in contact
[58:15] with God and Abraham recognized this is
[58:19] Elohim that has come down what did he do
[58:21] he ran out fell down on his face and
[58:24] began to worship him and you know what
[58:26] he told him don't leave we'll make
[58:28] supper for you you know what he's trying
[58:29] to do keep him around
[58:32] right you know how it is you want to
[58:34] seep out of your house don't serve them
[58:35] nothing
[58:38] oh Lord Brother Sammy you just bringing
[58:40] down offenses now
[58:43] right but Abraham said hey I want you
[58:45] staying around
[58:48] I want you to abide here
[58:50] just sit down right here we're gonna
[58:52] we're gonna get a calf and you know
[58:54] dress it and milk and on and on and
[58:56] think about when Moses got into the
[58:57] presence of the Bernie he turned aside
[58:59] to see the burning bush he's seeing this
[59:02] bush is on fire yet it's not consumed
[59:05] and he draws an ear to it and when he
[59:07] gets near God instructs him take off
[59:10] your shoes for the grounds you're
[59:11] standing on his Holy Ground And when God
[59:14] begins to make himself known in that
[59:16] hour and one he is calling Moses to do
[59:18] Moses begins to make it known to God
[59:22] with his stuttering his slow tongue I am
[59:26] not going to be able to do what you are
[59:29] calling me to do
[59:35] but let me just tell you something right
[59:36] now God don't take no for an answer
[59:41] boy that would preach I'll tell you God
[59:44] just don't take no for an answer
[59:46] you know what he's going to do he's
[59:47] going to overwhelm you with his presence
[59:50] the things that you can look I don't
[59:52] know God's just going to overwhelm you
[59:53] with his presence what's he doing our
[59:55] faith is being built not in the enticing
[59:59] words of man's Wisdom our faith is being
[1:00:03] built in the power of almighty God
[1:00:07] when Joshua wanted to know how do I take
[1:00:11] down Jericho he goes out and he meets
[1:00:14] the captain of the Lord's House he
[1:00:15] thinks he's a man just like any other
[1:00:16] ordinary man he draws his sword out and
[1:00:18] said whose side you're on because if
[1:00:20] you're on the wrong side your head's
[1:00:21] coming off
[1:00:23] right but immediately when he identifies
[1:00:26] himself I am come now as captain of the
[1:00:29] Lord's host I come to lead this Army
[1:00:32] into battle Joshua falls down and
[1:00:36] worships him you see that's an attribute
[1:00:38] of a Believer when they recognize
[1:00:40] they're in the presence of God they'll
[1:00:43] fall down and begin to worship Him
[1:00:48] and you know what God's not there say
[1:00:51] come on present the gifts present the
[1:00:52] gifts no no
[1:00:54] he brings us forth first by worship
[1:00:57] you know I tell his presence draws an
[1:00:59] ear in prayer
[1:01:01] it's just to worship Him
[1:01:03] think about it even in Revelations 1
[1:01:05] John falls down I don't have time to to
[1:01:07] keep going on all those examples but I
[1:01:09] want to draw you back to this point here
[1:01:12] that I read some moments ago that God
[1:01:16] in his creation by his creation
[1:01:19] for his creation
[1:01:21] that same deity and you know
[1:01:24] just as it was rejected then deity was
[1:01:27] rejected that same deity is rejected and
[1:01:31] has been rejected all down Through the
[1:01:33] Ages
[1:01:34] as a matter of fact when they rejected
[1:01:36] deity that's when when the Jews finally
[1:01:38] at that moment and Paul after the
[1:01:40] presenting even of the Gospel you know
[1:01:42] of the death bearing resurrection and
[1:01:44] now the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:45] once the Jews turned that aside but the
[1:01:48] Gentiles Rejoice God closed the door
[1:01:51] right there upon the Jews or or breaking
[1:01:54] away and now going fully into the
[1:01:56] Gentiles for this time and we know he's
[1:01:58] getting ready to turn as well back to
[1:02:00] the Jews but you see it was rejected
[1:02:02] deity and one is rejected deity you know
[1:02:05] it's one thing you know to recognize how
[1:02:07] that God had come down to come and pay
[1:02:11] the ultimate price but you know now to
[1:02:13] recognize what all of that was about is
[1:02:16] so that that same deity might come and
[1:02:19] live in Tabernacle in our lives and you
[1:02:22] know the Bible said that even in the day
[1:02:24] that you and I are living in that they
[1:02:26] would have a form of godliness
[1:02:29] there's a big difference between
[1:02:30] religion and a birth
[1:02:32] right religion can go on and it's only a
[1:02:35] covering but there's never really
[1:02:37] addressing the root and problem and the
[1:02:39] issue it never brings forth a
[1:02:41] relationship and this is why brother
[1:02:43] Brown would say when it comes to
[1:02:44] accepting deity and expressing back the
[1:02:47] same kind of a gift like the wise men
[1:02:49] did you are identified by your gift that
[1:02:53] you give your entire being to it to
[1:02:55] identified deity I like that don't you
[1:02:58] giving our entire being to identify
[1:03:00] deity then you identify yourself with
[1:03:03] deity by giving all you are what you are
[1:03:06] to deity himself so so you're not giving
[1:03:10] yourself to the man whom deity is
[1:03:13] displayed through but it is deity you're
[1:03:16] giving yourself through remember when
[1:03:18] the Greeks they said we would see Jesus
[1:03:20] and here Philip brings them to Jesus and
[1:03:23] all they saw was a man
[1:03:26] right that's all they saw but Jesus let
[1:03:29] them know that that there will come a
[1:03:32] time that that will be revealed or May
[1:03:34] known the disciples their sight was
[1:03:36] beyond the flesh because remember faith
[1:03:38] is not what you see here faith is what
[1:03:41] you see from here because they recognize
[1:03:44] even when Peter couldn't even explain it
[1:03:46] Peter was not even born again yet but
[1:03:48] there was that part on the inside of
[1:03:51] Peter which was a gift that was placed
[1:03:54] in him before her before the foundation
[1:03:56] of the world his name was on the last
[1:03:58] book of life and it just was in the
[1:04:00] prince of God and it just erupted and
[1:04:03] spoke out at that moment Thou Art the
[1:04:06] Christ the son of the Living God
[1:04:10] glory be to God hallelujah oh my oh sure
[1:04:14] Satan tried to discourage Peter and take
[1:04:16] him away and say look what you've done
[1:04:18] you've turned away you cursed him you
[1:04:21] did this you did that but you cannot get
[1:04:23] away from the calling of God you cannot
[1:04:26] get away from his purpose the enemy will
[1:04:28] try to lay all sorts of things on you
[1:04:31] he'll try to Cloud it up but let me tell
[1:04:33] you something he cannot hinder nor stop
[1:04:36] nor prevent the supernatural from coming
[1:04:39] after every one of God's children
[1:04:42] he can't do it I don't care all the
[1:04:45] traps I don't care all the isms he
[1:04:47] cannot stop God from getting to his
[1:04:50] children
[1:04:52] I tell you what is that that's a
[1:04:54] supernatural intelligence
[1:04:57] that's an intelligence that looks beyond
[1:05:00] all my fault and sees my need
[1:05:03] oh it's the same way with Christ in this
[1:05:07] day
[1:05:08] you believe that it's deity among the
[1:05:10] people that's that's what the message of
[1:05:12] the hour it was declaring here that's
[1:05:15] why the message of the hour it's not
[1:05:17] just not another Ministry it's a message
[1:05:20] from the Throne of God we're in the end
[1:05:24] time and now where Christ himself would
[1:05:27] step in his fullness the full deity of
[1:05:30] God was on display and it is still on
[1:05:34] display in a mini-membered body you say
[1:05:37] that person that person oh no don't
[1:05:39] judge me about the badger skin the
[1:05:41] badger skins once held a mean old Badger
[1:05:44] that Badger skin itself in once hold an
[1:05:47] animal animalistic man animalistic woman
[1:05:50] or it was a mean and cantankerous thing
[1:05:52] but you know what God didn't try to
[1:05:54] change the badger all God said is I
[1:05:56] gotta get on the inside if I can take
[1:05:59] out the nature of that Badger and change
[1:06:02] it there to the nature of a lamb I'll
[1:06:05] have a lamb being made manifest through
[1:06:07] Badgers Millions
[1:06:10] you'll repeat a god what is it deity on
[1:06:13] display
[1:06:15] amen it's the same deity on display and
[1:06:19] we give ourselves to it freely Lord I
[1:06:22] give myself to you because that is the
[1:06:25] only real gift that you and I can give
[1:06:28] is give ourselves because he already
[1:06:30] gave himself
[1:06:31] amen just to give our whole entire
[1:06:33] selves but I don't want to hold nothing
[1:06:34] back to you
[1:06:36] I don't want to hold nothing back I want
[1:06:37] to give it all to him
[1:06:39] and we look at all this that was placed
[1:06:41] in the life you know from the deity the
[1:06:44] uh the gold and the deity and the
[1:06:46] frankincense frankincense you know when
[1:06:48] you read in the scriptures frankincense
[1:06:50] um frankincense was one of those things
[1:06:52] that the only way you got frankincense
[1:06:54] probably some of you done study on this
[1:06:55] when you get frankincense it's the only
[1:06:57] way you get it is a tree has to actually
[1:06:59] be smoked and cut and it is the
[1:07:02] frankincense that'll run out of the cut
[1:07:04] it'll ooze out of that and then they'll
[1:07:07] go back and collect that frankincense
[1:07:08] and they'll Store It Up in places and
[1:07:11] allow it you know to just kind of uh you
[1:07:13] know
[1:07:14] um you know move into a better uh get
[1:07:17] into you know that state the hardened
[1:07:18] State and so forth and and more and more
[1:07:20] of a useful moment so here you have that
[1:07:23] of frankincense and to think about it he
[1:07:26] was wounded
[1:07:28] for my transgressions
[1:07:31] rules for my iniquities
[1:07:33] he made a way so that you and I
[1:07:36] might receive power for service
[1:07:40] we wanted to serve God but we needed
[1:07:43] power for service we needed something
[1:07:46] greater than our intellect and God
[1:07:49] provided there through the deity the
[1:07:51] frankincense and the myrrh and to think
[1:07:53] about it it just doesn't stand just
[1:07:55] doesn't happen one time but that deity
[1:07:58] empowers or places Us in service to
[1:08:02] serve his purpose which comes forth as
[1:08:05] we die to ourself and his life flows
[1:08:07] through Us by his creative Life coming
[1:08:10] through his creation
[1:08:12] it's continual dying to ourselves
[1:08:17] that's continual dying to ourselves this
[1:08:20] is why the scripture
[1:08:21] in Romans 12 would say present your
[1:08:24] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:08:28] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:08:30] reasonable service
[1:08:32] be not conformed to the world but be you
[1:08:34] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:08:35] that you might prove what is a good and
[1:08:37] acceptable and perfect will of God I
[1:08:40] want to just just just put it here in
[1:08:41] this manner I got this point I got one
[1:08:43] more point
[1:08:44] but I want to make this point here it's
[1:08:46] a continual presentation
[1:08:50] you realize that the children of Israel
[1:08:52] the sons of Israel would have to come
[1:08:55] and present themselves three times a
[1:08:57] year
[1:08:59] these to Passover feast of Pentecost I
[1:09:01] believe and then that Feast of of the of
[1:09:04] the end Gathering I I think I've got the
[1:09:06] feast right there but it's it's here
[1:09:07] when you when you bring it down what it
[1:09:09] comes down to is Son of Man Son of God
[1:09:12] Son of David so in all through in every
[1:09:14] dispensation and all that has been
[1:09:16] called for down through the Gentile ages
[1:09:19] it has been the Holy Spirit he that
[1:09:21] happened here let him hear what the
[1:09:22] spirit say to the church once you've
[1:09:24] been doing it's been calling the
[1:09:26] children of God to present themselves in
[1:09:30] his presence
[1:09:32] is that right now notice if there is a
[1:09:35] continual presentation to take place so
[1:09:38] it's not just something that we we we do
[1:09:41] and you know and well we we do and now
[1:09:44] now we're good to go but it's something
[1:09:46] there's a longing within us there's a
[1:09:47] desire there's a yearning to grow I I
[1:09:49] mean you know how this is with um
[1:09:52] with children you know uh maybe some
[1:09:55] more than others but you know they they
[1:09:57] want they want to kind of progress and
[1:09:58] do things you know and when it comes
[1:10:00] time to maybe do the you know get their
[1:10:02] license well
[1:10:04] you know if 14 years old don't want to
[1:10:06] go sit in the truck or sit in the car
[1:10:08] and he all started up for you
[1:10:11] after they get their license you'll be
[1:10:12] starting their car for them
[1:10:17] I mean it wears off right there's
[1:10:19] certain things that you you you look at
[1:10:21] it that when we're always we're looking
[1:10:23] there's a desire to grow there's a
[1:10:25] desire and I want more and Lord I I
[1:10:28] desire more of you and that's why
[1:10:29] brother Graham said that after in in the
[1:10:31] message power transformation he said
[1:10:32] look he said after we have been filled
[1:10:34] with the Holy Ghost as we have well now
[1:10:37] we want the mind of Christ to be in us
[1:10:40] that'll transform us from the Natural
[1:10:42] Things of life and be brought to do the
[1:10:44] perfect will of God by the
[1:10:46] transformation of God's spirit by his
[1:10:48] word now I know sometimes we can look at
[1:10:50] it and think well that's a One-Shot deal
[1:10:52] brother Samuel no it's not a One-Shot
[1:10:54] deal once we have been born again we
[1:10:57] have come into the body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:00] now it's us dying and yielding that the
[1:11:04] mind of Christ might operate through us
[1:11:07] and it's us that has to yield it's us
[1:11:10] that has to give God he's a gentleman
[1:11:12] he's a husband remember within that the
[1:11:16] desire is is that we would yield to his
[1:11:18] leadership
[1:11:19] because we all know it's our thoughts to
[1:11:22] get us in trouble
[1:11:24] right I mean you know you get a pain oh
[1:11:26] I got a pain here I got a pain there I
[1:11:28] got a pain here let me go to Dr Google
[1:11:30] and Dr Google says if you got this if
[1:11:32] you got that if you go are you feeling
[1:11:34] like this well you know what
[1:11:36] I think I am I think I am I you know
[1:11:38] what I think oh you know you might have
[1:11:40] oh Lord not the c word oh Lord no oh
[1:11:44] right what is it what we've entertained
[1:11:46] well we've come in the presence of and
[1:11:49] entertained has brought fear
[1:11:51] if it'll do it that way and that in that
[1:11:54] manner oh my I pray to God that God's
[1:11:57] stirring our hearts up that we can say I
[1:12:00] got to go to Dr Jesus I I got to know
[1:12:03] he's speaking to my heart he's speaking
[1:12:05] to my life do you feel like this yes
[1:12:07] Lord I love you uh do you want to follow
[1:12:09] my word I do want to follow your word do
[1:12:11] you want to see more of me I do want to
[1:12:13] see more of you and what's happening
[1:12:15] there it's building faith and confidence
[1:12:18] in him as we continue to present
[1:12:22] ourselves in his presence
[1:12:25] the Bible says in Proverbs 18 16 a man's
[1:12:30] gift maketh room for him and bringeth
[1:12:33] him before Great Men
[1:12:37] now think about it it's not the man who
[1:12:40] does it
[1:12:41] it's the gift
[1:12:43] that maketh room and it is the gift that
[1:12:47] brings him before Great Men
[1:12:49] so a gift is what a whole gift a gift is
[1:12:53] about getting ourselves out of the way
[1:12:55] now we all could agree a pastor that's a
[1:12:58] gift and the gift is to get itself out
[1:13:00] of the way that God might Shepherd
[1:13:02] through that gift not try to be an
[1:13:03] evangelist or a prophet or whatever no
[1:13:05] just just do according to how God let
[1:13:08] God operate and flow through that gift
[1:13:10] that channel evangelist whatever it
[1:13:12] might be same way with any of the nine
[1:13:14] spiritual gifts that are in the body but
[1:13:16] I want you looking at it you and me to
[1:13:17] look at this in the manner of a gift
[1:13:20] maketh room for itself to remember what
[1:13:22] the real gift is it is the gift of that
[1:13:25] soul that come from God and the Holy
[1:13:28] Spirit is what is sent in this earth to
[1:13:31] draw you and I out and to bring that
[1:13:34] nature into a Divine expression
[1:13:37] so every gift maketh room for itself you
[1:13:39] know think about it brother Rand will
[1:13:40] talk about this about brother ruddle in
[1:13:43] the adoption series and he talks about
[1:13:44] how brother rutle you know brother Ram's
[1:13:46] telling their brothers he said look he
[1:13:47] said I got some Churches if y'all if you
[1:13:49] don't feel like pastoring and so forth
[1:13:50] and he pretended to begin to talk about
[1:13:52] you know talking about brother ruddle
[1:13:53] and he said you know brother ruddle
[1:13:54] saying oh brother Brandon I can't talk
[1:13:57] real good and I you know brother goes
[1:13:59] through it on tape right there and
[1:14:01] brother remember said you know what
[1:14:01] brother he said my goodness he said yeah
[1:14:03] I can't get up there and preach I I
[1:14:05] can't even talk and brother Brown said
[1:14:07] have you heard him now brother Adam said
[1:14:09] it like this he said he was so backward
[1:14:11] he said I I just can't talk brother Adam
[1:14:14] brother I said you ought to hear him now
[1:14:15] you don't know what you can do until you
[1:14:19] let the Holy Spirit get a hold of you
[1:14:22] see it's not us telling God what we can
[1:14:25] do it's God letting you and I know this
[1:14:28] is what I can do
[1:14:30] you hear what he said it's not what you
[1:14:32] can do it's what he can do
[1:14:36] so that means there's somebody in the
[1:14:38] way and that's me
[1:14:41] and a gift is to be able to get
[1:14:42] ourselves out of the way
[1:14:44] you know what Joseph I love this in the
[1:14:46] in the in the message of prisoner of
[1:14:48] Jesus Christ but the RAM talks about
[1:14:49] Joseph and how Joseph I mean you know
[1:14:52] what happened with Joseph where he was
[1:14:53] you know his uh sold into slavery and he
[1:14:56] was there in prison and brother Brown
[1:14:57] begins to talk about in that message of
[1:14:59] prisoner and be a good message to list
[1:15:00] two if you haven't in a while but the
[1:15:02] brand begins to talk about it of how
[1:15:03] that Joseph was sitting there in the
[1:15:05] prison and he said how that Joseph
[1:15:07] became a total failure to himself
[1:15:12] I want you I want you to take this in
[1:15:14] context here he became a total failure
[1:15:16] to himself
[1:15:18] he was in a situation nobody would
[1:15:20] listen to him unbelievers would not
[1:15:22] believe his ministry was of none effect
[1:15:24] people turned their head wouldn't pay
[1:15:26] attention to him in prison they'd walk
[1:15:28] on down the street
[1:15:29] he said but and God kept him a prisoner
[1:15:32] until the will got rolled up tight and
[1:15:35] then God said here's my man says Glory
[1:15:38] total failure exclamation point
[1:15:41] see what you and I look at is total
[1:15:44] failure of just
[1:15:46] I feel like a failure and the giving up
[1:15:49] is not throwing in the towel but giving
[1:15:51] up is his Lord I
[1:15:53] heard of me trying
[1:15:58] it's with every aspect in our life and
[1:16:00] God allows the situations all the crime
[1:16:03] that Joseph did in prison all the
[1:16:05] thinking all the overcoming that he had
[1:16:07] to overcome where his Brethren had threw
[1:16:09] him in a pit where his Brethren had did
[1:16:10] all that it was an overcoming for Joseph
[1:16:12] through all of that and in his thinking
[1:16:15] he had become a total failure
[1:16:18] Now watch how brother Brown says this I
[1:16:20] love this part in the message brother
[1:16:22] Graham says God came to him in prison
[1:16:24] like he did Paul like he did the rest of
[1:16:27] them and God used the gift that he had
[1:16:31] given him to get him out of there
[1:16:34] so what was Joseph's ticket out of
[1:16:37] prison the gift that was in him the
[1:16:40] whole time
[1:16:41] the gift that was in him is what God
[1:16:44] used not Joseph God used it to get him
[1:16:47] out of there
[1:16:49] oh you hearing me now it's the gift
[1:16:51] within your life as a son and daughter
[1:16:54] of God it's us surrendering to his
[1:16:57] presence not just for the new birth to
[1:16:59] come but for every step in phase of our
[1:17:03] journey it's God using the gift as we
[1:17:06] can yield as we can surrender what is it
[1:17:09] it's God using the gift by his Spirit
[1:17:12] you say what's the gift it's his word it
[1:17:15] is God using his word in our lives to
[1:17:19] get us out
[1:17:21] and one of these days it'll be the final
[1:17:23] departure
[1:17:25] because this is a bit this is the worst
[1:17:27] prison house than the prison that Joseph
[1:17:29] was in
[1:17:31] but remember it was in that prison house
[1:17:33] he became a failure which is very
[1:17:35] important
[1:17:36] you can never we can never go any
[1:17:38] further until we recognize ourselves a
[1:17:39] failure you know what real maturity is
[1:17:41] you know you've heard me say this now
[1:17:43] for years real maturity is not where you
[1:17:46] come to a place that I don't make
[1:17:48] mistakes any longer real maturity is not
[1:17:50] where you or I come to a place to say I
[1:17:52] don't need to pray as much anymore I
[1:17:54] don't need to read as much anymore real
[1:17:56] maturity is not we're all I've got this
[1:17:58] cover no real maturity is where we
[1:18:01] recognize our need of him is greater
[1:18:04] than what we ever recognized before
[1:18:07] that's what real maturity is that we
[1:18:10] recognize Lord I need you every step of
[1:18:13] the way Lord that's what real real
[1:18:16] maturity is and we don't need more of
[1:18:17] him no real maturity says I need more of
[1:18:20] him why we see ourselves as a total
[1:18:24] failure without him
[1:18:27] and then we're a prisoner where we can
[1:18:30] be surrendered to his working and his
[1:18:33] leading and then when we come into that
[1:18:35] then we are coming into a place of a
[1:18:38] ruler where we can come into position
[1:18:40] now let me just try to move here into a
[1:18:43] place I want to get to this last Point
[1:18:45] here real quick
[1:18:46] and I want to just deal with this
[1:18:48] I hope this all coming together as he
[1:18:50] just leading I
[1:18:52] but I want to talk about that gift just
[1:18:54] a little bit continuing continual
[1:18:55] presentation us continuing to present
[1:18:58] ourselves in his presence
[1:19:02] a lot of things will try to stop that a
[1:19:04] lot of things can try to block it
[1:19:06] we can let things know we can go right
[1:19:07] through this room
[1:19:10] and we can all give examples of things
[1:19:13] to wear things that we've allowed
[1:19:16] whether it's traps or other things that
[1:19:18] has come up that's blocked us from
[1:19:20] getting in his presence
[1:19:22] now it's not just it's not just coming
[1:19:24] it's his presence is not just confined
[1:19:26] right here
[1:19:27] but his presence is to go with us
[1:19:30] we can abide in his prayer you can have
[1:19:33] the busiest day on the job but you can
[1:19:34] be in his presence
[1:19:36] you can invite his presence and and just
[1:19:38] invite him to come in and say Lord I
[1:19:41] want to abide in your presence and allow
[1:19:43] him to work on your life you know
[1:19:45] remember you and I are not the ones
[1:19:47] determining thyroid cells go to thyroid
[1:19:49] kidney cells go to kidney cells so you
[1:19:51] know what that means brother Aaron it
[1:19:53] isn't you it isn't me Brother Richard it
[1:19:55] isn't you it is in me brother Bill it
[1:19:57] isn't you it isn't me saying hey Lord
[1:19:59] put the word over here Lord put the word
[1:20:01] over there there are times we do not
[1:20:04] even know what to say but our thoughts
[1:20:07] are expressed as we will yield that gift
[1:20:10] in his presence and say Lord I don't
[1:20:13] even know exactly what to say or how to
[1:20:17] say it but Lord God I just want to be in
[1:20:20] your presence because in your presence
[1:20:23] is fullness of joy in your presence I am
[1:20:27] changed from Glory unto Glory so I am
[1:20:30] here Lord just to present myself
[1:20:33] once again
[1:20:40] let me deal with this last one very
[1:20:42] quickly
[1:20:43] one of the things
[1:20:45] that we deal with
[1:20:47] no matter what stage
[1:20:48] that we are in in our walk with God
[1:20:51] is overcoming the intimidation
[1:20:54] of our inabilities
[1:20:57] we can be intimidated
[1:21:00] by our inabilities
[1:21:04] that doesn't that doesn't cease the new
[1:21:06] birth doesn't do away with that Humanity
[1:21:08] part of it but remember depending on
[1:21:11] where you and I dwell what dog we feed
[1:21:13] the most what presents and the things we
[1:21:15] give ourselves to it's either going to
[1:21:17] build Faith or it's going to build doubt
[1:21:20] that's all choice and so when I think of
[1:21:23] it think about brother Branham you know
[1:21:24] you've heard me refer to this on the
[1:21:25] midweek services in the message go tell
[1:21:28] when God is confirming to him the third
[1:21:31] phase of his ministry the third pool
[1:21:33] brother Brown has a sinus infection
[1:21:35] that's real bad medicine can't touch it
[1:21:37] and so forth brother ram calls it an ash
[1:21:38] Heap that he was on brothers were coming
[1:21:40] to pray for him nothing was breaking and
[1:21:43] finally the Lord spoke to him and
[1:21:45] brother Brown was talking about this
[1:21:47] third phase of his ministry and I love
[1:21:49] how brother Brown was so open before us
[1:21:51] because what God was calling him to that
[1:21:53] of that of the spoken word where it
[1:21:55] would be the revealing of the word
[1:21:56] coming forth here in our midst that's
[1:21:59] what would get a hold of Our Lives
[1:22:00] that's what would change our lives
[1:22:02] that's what would uh uh divide to us our
[1:22:05] inheritance because that's our position
[1:22:07] in the word but you realize on the
[1:22:09] greatest thing Brother Carlos that's
[1:22:11] where Satan came to attack him and
[1:22:12] brother Brown was sitting right there
[1:22:14] and brother Brahman was was looking at
[1:22:16] it I don't want to fail I don't want to
[1:22:17] be a failure I don't want to fail I
[1:22:19] don't want to be a failure well any any
[1:22:21] one of us would look at things like that
[1:22:22] and we still do look at things like that
[1:22:24] anybody ever had had an impression of
[1:22:26] the Lord go say this or go speak this or
[1:22:29] go say this to the brother or go say
[1:22:30] this to sister and you didn't do it well
[1:22:32] you don't have to raise your hand but
[1:22:33] I'll raise your mind right and sometimes
[1:22:35] we come to a spot finally recognizing
[1:22:37] you know what instead of wrestling with
[1:22:39] it I'm just going to do what the
[1:22:41] impression is said to do I'm gonna I'm
[1:22:43] gonna move and I'm gonna act upon it
[1:22:45] because sometimes we're thinking about
[1:22:46] what are they going to say what the
[1:22:48] result's going to be and what is this
[1:22:49] and what is this and we're looking at
[1:22:51] that what is that it's overcoming the
[1:22:53] intimidation of our inabilities
[1:22:56] this is the pest house this is part of
[1:22:59] overcoming this is an everyday every
[1:23:02] moment every hour overcoming and brother
[1:23:04] Branham finally when the Lord spoke to
[1:23:06] him remember what brother Ram started
[1:23:07] thinking about he thought about George
[1:23:09] General Patton and he also thought about
[1:23:11] uh General Eisenhower and he talked
[1:23:13] about general you know General
[1:23:14] Eisenhower I think it was that said hey
[1:23:16] if I put a bullet in a gun it don't go
[1:23:18] off gonna take that one out and put
[1:23:19] another one in if that don't go off take
[1:23:21] it out put another one in I'm going to
[1:23:22] keep putting bullets in because it's
[1:23:24] going to fire and it's going to hit the
[1:23:25] target now think of it simple natural
[1:23:28] things when it came to war but the Holy
[1:23:31] Spirit would pick that up and well as
[1:23:34] without a general patent telling them
[1:23:36] when he had men coming to the front line
[1:23:38] and running Patton said don't send me no
[1:23:40] more boys up here you send me some men
[1:23:42] that are willing to fight and the Holy
[1:23:45] Spirit began to take them examples and
[1:23:47] then he spoke to the prophet and said I
[1:23:50] have already confirmed this third pull
[1:23:53] to you but do you need to accept accept
[1:23:56] it
[1:23:58] and you know what brother random lack
[1:23:59] into two brother Brown likened it to a
[1:24:01] man that has heard the gospel preached
[1:24:03] service after service after service year
[1:24:07] after year after year but finally comes
[1:24:10] to replace to press beyond the fear of
[1:24:13] failure and say you know what I'm going
[1:24:15] to accept what he has said I'm going to
[1:24:18] accept what God is saying because God
[1:24:20] isn't asking me to do it it's God asking
[1:24:23] me to surrender the gift that he might
[1:24:26] achieve
[1:24:27] think about the problem when he stood
[1:24:29] there and here even in the first coming
[1:24:31] there because when brother Adam accepted
[1:24:33] it let me go back to the third pool when
[1:24:34] brother by Adam accepted that he said
[1:24:37] Lord then I accept it the sinus
[1:24:38] condition broke
[1:24:40] the condition broke
[1:24:42] think about when the angel of the Lord
[1:24:43] came to brother Branham at first gave
[1:24:45] him his original commission what did
[1:24:47] Brother Graham say
[1:24:49] when he told him you're going to be
[1:24:50] praying for kings and this and that and
[1:24:51] whatever but the REM said I told him I
[1:24:53] would not be able to
[1:24:55] do that
[1:25:00] but this ain't like your boss at work
[1:25:05] I know you might say well you don't know
[1:25:06] my boss no but I'm telling you Jesus
[1:25:08] ain't like that
[1:25:10] but see Jesus Don't Force because Jesus
[1:25:13] ain't asking us to do it
[1:25:15] he's asking us yield and let me do it
[1:25:22] that's listen that's the secret in
[1:25:25] overcoming in every battle and every
[1:25:27] trial
[1:25:31] this is why because I had just a few
[1:25:33] more moments think of Gideon
[1:25:35] here's Gideon you know you know we can
[1:25:37] look through the scriptures and no doubt
[1:25:38] as Bible readers you look through it and
[1:25:39] sometimes you see man it looks like one
[1:25:41] just pow came up overnight
[1:25:45] pow like a David and pow like this
[1:25:49] sometimes we forget
[1:25:51] how long suffering God was and is with
[1:25:54] us
[1:25:56] when God's had to correct us of things
[1:25:59] that we have finally matured into and
[1:26:02] come to the realization hey this is
[1:26:04] pretty important I need to be doing this
[1:26:06] come on Friends
[1:26:08] we can all look back honestly back down
[1:26:10] through our lives we can see where God
[1:26:12] has brought us to think of where Gideon
[1:26:13] was standing Gideon looked at himself
[1:26:15] and he's and he's and and when God spoke
[1:26:17] to him there the angel of the Lord that
[1:26:18] followed the message Gideon looked
[1:26:20] around and said a mighty man of Valor
[1:26:21] Guinea and said who else is here
[1:26:25] God began to tell him what what he
[1:26:26] called him to do and Gideon that complex
[1:26:28] that he had I mean his family had a
[1:26:30] complex
[1:26:32] you got the wrong you're talking about
[1:26:35] Manassas you're talking about
[1:26:38] by the time you mean
[1:26:40] that when God deals with our life that
[1:26:42] there's complexes that we have to
[1:26:44] overcome yeah
[1:26:45] and even after we've been born again
[1:26:47] sometimes we can still develop them
[1:26:51] brother bam said they can be easily
[1:26:54] built
[1:26:56] he identified it in his own life what is
[1:26:58] it it's overcoming
[1:27:00] it's overcoming and here we're getting
[1:27:02] now look what Gideon did get in you know
[1:27:04] everything get input get in what do you
[1:27:06] do in the presence of God he said wait
[1:27:08] right here he presented the Flesh and
[1:27:10] the broth
[1:27:12] the prince of God came down and consumed
[1:27:14] it then we have the fleece due on the
[1:27:16] fleece next night do all around it none
[1:27:18] on the fleece
[1:27:20] God did it
[1:27:21] then when it came down to you know going
[1:27:24] down to smack the midianites remember
[1:27:26] there had to be a trimming down but then
[1:27:28] when it came down for that that battle
[1:27:30] because see everything along the way God
[1:27:32] was equipping Gideon
[1:27:38] every every time in his presence
[1:27:40] remember the altar of Baal was tore down
[1:27:43] then more would keep keep taking place
[1:27:46] the more that he presented himself in
[1:27:48] God's presence
[1:27:49] and then finally God told him I want you
[1:27:51] to go down to a tent down here because I
[1:27:53] want you to hear a dream that's going to
[1:27:55] be told
[1:27:55] you know in the middle of everything
[1:27:57] because we know the outcome what what
[1:27:59] took place
[1:28:00] is Gideon became so inspired what was
[1:28:03] happening there was a growing taking
[1:28:05] place to where you took a man who was a
[1:28:07] coward
[1:28:09] but God brought out the mighty man that
[1:28:11] he saw there the whole time and God
[1:28:14] brought that man into position to where
[1:28:16] when the enemy took off in that battle
[1:28:18] the two leaders Gideon pursued after him
[1:28:22] Gideon said the gas is down to the floor
[1:28:25] and we're not stop until we get these
[1:28:28] guys
[1:28:29] I think that's what it is about our
[1:28:31] lives how God will work and move in
[1:28:34] areas of our life of things that you
[1:28:36] thought I never pursue like that but God
[1:28:39] you let God take a hold you stay in
[1:28:42] God's presence you'll find yourself
[1:28:43] putting the gas on the floor and pursue
[1:28:46] it after your enemies
[1:28:52] God never got angry
[1:28:55] God never got angry with Gideon
[1:28:57] God never said
[1:29:01] I put it on the fleece there now you
[1:29:04] want it on the grass and not the fleece
[1:29:05] you don't read God getting angry
[1:29:09] you don't read God getting frustrated
[1:29:11] you don't read God being impatient
[1:29:14] what's God doing he's working with one
[1:29:17] of his children to bring them in
[1:29:20] position
[1:29:21] and God is Not shaken by our complexes
[1:29:25] God is Not shaken by our intimidation of
[1:29:30] our inabilities God is not moved by that
[1:29:33] he has confidence his word will come
[1:29:37] forth if we'll only abide in his
[1:29:40] presence
[1:29:47] this quote I'm going to quote to you
[1:29:49] here
[1:29:50] this is what pressed on me here even was
[1:29:52] I've meditating on this
[1:29:55] how many remember the little woman
[1:29:59] she was a very an ill-famed woman
[1:30:02] Mary Magdalene how many remember Mary
[1:30:03] Magdalene
[1:30:06] she saw him sitting in Simon's house
[1:30:11] now she did not know
[1:30:13] how she was going to get to him
[1:30:16] you know she went and got
[1:30:18] the ointment the alabaster box you you
[1:30:21] recall that
[1:30:23] but she doesn't even know
[1:30:25] how am I going to do what I'm being led
[1:30:29] to do
[1:30:31] how am I going to do that
[1:30:33] and you know what brother Brahms says I
[1:30:35] think this is such a to me such a
[1:30:38] direction for you and I
[1:30:40] that she went forth
[1:30:43] to do what the pulsation of Faith had
[1:30:46] struck her heart to do
[1:30:48] and brother Brown said she went to do it
[1:30:50] without knowing how she was going to do
[1:30:53] it
[1:30:54] oh God
[1:30:56] I believe that's where we come to I
[1:30:59] believe that's something where we where
[1:31:00] we should live is not worrying about how
[1:31:02] am I going to do it but when he pulsates
[1:31:05] to our heart just to get into his
[1:31:07] presence he'll make a way
[1:31:09] he opened up her tears and he washed his
[1:31:13] feet she didn't know brother Joey how is
[1:31:15] it going to happen all she knew is
[1:31:17] inspiration is striking me go minister
[1:31:21] to him and when she got there in her in
[1:31:24] his presence what was in her was
[1:31:27] released in his presence
[1:31:31] or was it and identified
[1:31:34] gift
[1:31:35] of God
[1:31:39] how many get weary
[1:31:42] I got both my hands up I may get weary
[1:31:44] anybody get weary in well doing
[1:31:47] this is my last in part of that last
[1:31:49] point you get weary right
[1:31:51] you get worried the Bible tells us that
[1:31:52] in Galatians 6 be not weary in
[1:31:55] well-doing for if we if we continue if
[1:31:58] we're sowing the right things and we
[1:32:01] shall reap the Harvest so it's warning
[1:32:03] us you can get weary you you can get
[1:32:06] faint those things can happen within
[1:32:08] your life but this is why
[1:32:10] coming back into his presence
[1:32:13] and saying Lord
[1:32:15] I need a fresh refilling of the Holy
[1:32:17] Ghost
[1:32:18] I need a fresh refilling because what a
[1:32:21] refilling does it's a Revival within our
[1:32:24] life
[1:32:25] that cleanse and cleans out all of maybe
[1:32:29] trash and things that's built up in our
[1:32:31] life sometimes I don't think of trash so
[1:32:33] much as things of the world so much as
[1:32:35] Sin but sometimes it's just our own
[1:32:38] dwellings and not dwelling in the prince
[1:32:40] of God it begins to become accumulation
[1:32:43] of things
[1:32:45] that doesn't lend itself to us yielding
[1:32:50] it calls us to do what I want to draw
[1:32:52] back
[1:32:53] I want to draw back but you see what
[1:32:55] that is that's Satan's trap because
[1:32:57] Satan is afraid of you getting in his
[1:33:01] presence
[1:33:03] Satan knows if he can keep you out of
[1:33:05] his presence he can trap you he said I
[1:33:07] see there wasn't nothing to it I'll look
[1:33:09] at you you've allowed this and look at
[1:33:11] you you've allowed this to come in and
[1:33:12] look you've been there and he can point
[1:33:14] to so many things well you've let down
[1:33:15] on this and you've let he can point
[1:33:17] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:33:19] keep you from where you rightfully
[1:33:21] belong you belong in the prince of God
[1:33:24] it's God who is your maker it's God who
[1:33:27] is your Redeemer it's God who knows all
[1:33:30] about you it's God is the one who moves
[1:33:32] and works in your life it's God who
[1:33:35] builds faith
[1:33:37] in your life for him to work
[1:33:41] but sometimes we get weary
[1:33:43] we get weary
[1:33:45] and I don't care how you know no matter
[1:33:47] where it's at you get weary but this is
[1:33:50] why we need a refilling
[1:33:52] that's why we need a refilling of the
[1:33:54] Holy Ghost Lord
[1:33:55] is clearing out a realigning getting the
[1:33:58] distractions and that refilling isn't
[1:33:59] just like a plugging up and well plug up
[1:34:02] that we recognize Lord
[1:34:04] now just simply entering back into his
[1:34:06] presence right here
[1:34:09] you're already in his presence but just
[1:34:12] to acknowledge it and do what what do I
[1:34:14] do before you try to present anything
[1:34:16] just fall down and worship him thank you
[1:34:19] Lord for speaking to me I'm unworthy
[1:34:22] that you would come by my mouth
[1:34:24] but I recognize your presence Lord what
[1:34:27] are you doing you're doing just exactly
[1:34:28] what it runs in the family to fall down
[1:34:31] and to worship him you'll know when to
[1:34:34] release the gifts you'll know and to
[1:34:36] release your heart you'll know when to
[1:34:38] release it but let's just worship Him
[1:34:41] invite him in
[1:34:43] that's what brother Brown could say in
[1:34:46] images of Christ I love that statement
[1:34:48] in the message brother Rams says while
[1:34:51] this Tabernacle is going through a
[1:34:53] Revival
[1:34:55] I want a Revival
[1:34:57] in my own life
[1:34:59] I love this statement he says I want
[1:35:02] more of the Holy Ghost to take over more
[1:35:05] of William Branham
[1:35:06] and here's why here's why so that I can
[1:35:09] be more of a servant
[1:35:12] like he was
[1:35:14] not I want more of the Holy Ghost so
[1:35:16] I'll be able to walk on the water I'll
[1:35:17] be no I want to be more of a servant
[1:35:20] Lord I need more I want to refill it
[1:35:24] for what frankincense
[1:35:26] because it all comes in that package
[1:35:29] Grace for us to die to ourselves
[1:35:31] frankincense to be put in service and
[1:35:34] deity to be displayed in our life what
[1:35:36] Grace has given to us
[1:35:39] let's pray
[1:35:41] Heavenly Father
[1:35:45] Lord God
[1:35:49] as we are the Lord drawn into these
[1:35:52] moments Lord
[1:35:54] I'm so thankful Lord
[1:35:57] that we can come and we can gather in
[1:35:59] your presence Lord
[1:36:02] and the Lord that not only do you know
[1:36:04] what our needs are
[1:36:06] but even in the times Lord that we do
[1:36:08] not even know what to say or how to say
[1:36:12] it
[1:36:13] but Lord God our thoughts our thoughts
[1:36:16] we can Lord give of ourselves to you
[1:36:19] Lord
[1:36:20] Lord God just to
[1:36:22] fall down and to Worship You Lord
[1:36:25] just to thank you Lord for making
[1:36:28] yourself known Lord
[1:36:30] thank you Lord for leading us sometimes
[1:36:32] Lord oh my you haven't let us maybe in
[1:36:36] the exact same pathway that these wise
[1:36:39] men traveled
[1:36:40] but there are times Lord God how your
[1:36:43] presence Lord just as you let us out of
[1:36:46] the world took the world out of us and
[1:36:49] placed Us in you
[1:36:51] you are still the same God who leads us
[1:36:55] beyond all intimidation
[1:36:59] you are the same Supernatural God who
[1:37:02] comes down and speaks to our life to
[1:37:05] call us
[1:37:06] beyond our inabilities Lord
[1:37:09] you've never chosen us because we had
[1:37:12] abilities
[1:37:14] but you chose us Lord God
[1:37:16] because Lord we always were a part of
[1:37:19] you
[1:37:20] Lord it is a part that God that you have
[1:37:23] placed in our lives that then when the
[1:37:25] coming of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:27] it's power
[1:37:29] for service
[1:37:31] It's You Lord God
