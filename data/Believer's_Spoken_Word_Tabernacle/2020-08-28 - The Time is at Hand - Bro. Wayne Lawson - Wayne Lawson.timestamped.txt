[35:49] first chapter and i have a couple of
[35:51] scriptures here revelation chapter one
[35:54] and verse three
[35:57] revelation chapter 1 and verse 3.
[36:05] revelation 1 and 3 for blessed is he
[36:07] that readeth
[36:09] and he that hear the words of this
[36:11] prophecy
[36:13] and keep these things which are written
[36:14] therein
[36:16] for the time
[36:18] is at hand
[36:20] now i want to read you something brother
[36:22] brahm said about this it's a revelation
[36:24] the book is to the servants of god for
[36:26] this last time
[36:28] when the time is at hand when this book
[36:31] will be revealed
[36:33] over in the book we find that the book
[36:34] was closed and shut and sealed until the
[36:36] end time
[36:37] so when he says for the times at hand
[36:40] he's not speaking about for that day
[36:43] that it's being written he's talking
[36:44] about the day
[36:46] that it's going to be revealed
[36:48] let's also go into revelations uh the
[36:51] 22nd chapter
[36:53] let's go in the 10th verse
[36:56] revelation 2 and we can include the
[36:59] ninth verse of
[37:01] the the eighth verse down to the tenth
[37:03] here sorry and now john saw these things
[37:06] and heard and when i'd heard and seen i
[37:08] fell down in worship before the feet of
[37:10] the angel which showed me these things
[37:12] and then he saith unto me seal
[37:15] thou see thou do it not
[37:17] for i am the fellow servant of thy
[37:19] brother and the prophets and of them
[37:21] which keep the sayings of this book
[37:24] worship god
[37:26] so at the same time that people would be
[37:29] inclined to worship an angel prophet of
[37:32] god
[37:32] when they would be inclined to worship
[37:34] that that that specific angel would say
[37:36] don't do it but then what's the next
[37:37] thing and he sayeth unto me seal not the
[37:41] sayings of this prophecy of this book
[37:44] for the time is at hand now it's amazing
[37:46] because in revelations 10
[37:48] john is told by the by the thundering
[37:50] angel seal it up
[37:52] until
[37:53] the seventh angel sounds when he shall
[37:55] begin the sound the mystery will be made
[37:56] clear and then now here in revelations
[37:58] 22 you're seeing him meet this same he's
[38:02] he's john's meeting the bride is meeting
[38:04] an angel that he is inclined to worship
[38:06] but says don't worship me
[38:08] but it is a time to unseal the book
[38:11] it's a it's a time that is at hand amen
[38:14] we ask the lord bless his word tonight
[38:16] and i do want to speak to you tonight
[38:18] just a little bit as you be seated i
[38:19] want to speak to you on uh the time
[38:23] time is at hand
[38:25] the time is at hand we want to maybe
[38:28] speak to you a little bit tonight
[38:29] concerning this matter there's some
[38:31] things that we that we recognize and
[38:34] that we're living in some very
[38:35] very uh very unprecedented times some
[38:38] some crazy times as we could say you
[38:40] know it's a it's a time crazy things are
[38:43] going on everywhere and we we want to
[38:45] say that we we can see certainly that
[38:48] it's a time to um a time to appreciate
[38:50] the uh of course that the darkness
[38:52] always makes us appreciate the light and
[38:55] and the bad makes us appreciate the good
[38:57] amen and and so we want to say that and
[39:00] you know just in just in getting started
[39:02] here i do i do say that i i certainly
[39:05] appreciate your pastor here brother
[39:07] samuel for the stand that he takes on
[39:08] this message
[39:09] and it's always been a blessing to come
[39:11] here and minister and as i said it's a
[39:14] little more special now but i think
[39:15] maybe this is one of the first times
[39:16] i've heard brian uh go through an entire
[39:19] service a song leading uh i'm impressed
[39:21] i
[39:22] i've just been honest i i liked him
[39:24] already it's a sun involved i'm
[39:26] impressed amen spiritually he's a he's a
[39:29] real blessing amen god bless you brother
[39:31] simon you got him trained well amen
[39:34] so we we we appreciate him as a
[39:36] son-in-law he's been a great a great a
[39:38] part of our family and and he married my
[39:41] my daughter and of course gracie's a
[39:43] special one took to me so you know how
[39:45] dads are you know and so um we
[39:47] definitely favor her and and think uh
[39:50] she's the best of the best so hey man
[39:52] y'all be okay with me if i'll say that
[39:54] because to to me there's no better a man
[39:57] so but we we certainly love her so it
[39:59] just gives us a little special uh a
[40:01] feeling to come and and even in such uh
[40:05] times like this i think of of the
[40:07] darkness of this hour and the times that
[40:09] we're that we're visiting you um i i
[40:12] think that it's sometimes it does us uh
[40:15] how could i say this it does us good to
[40:17] reach back and begin to look at some of
[40:18] the things that are principled truths
[40:21] things that was laid out and things that
[40:23] are are certain to us and sometimes we
[40:25] need to revisit those things and
[40:27] remember uh the times and the seasons
[40:30] and what we're doing here and what the
[40:32] situations are and i thought it was
[40:33] amazing how
[40:34] that brother branham will actually say
[40:36] he says see if we could just go into it
[40:39] right now he said look when the time is
[40:42] at hand
[40:43] when the revelation of jesus christ is
[40:45] being revealed to the body of christ and
[40:47] christ has been revealed not dead but
[40:49] alive living in his church doing this
[40:53] same things that he did then the same
[40:55] ministry the same gospel the same signs
[40:58] the resurrected christ when he's
[40:59] revealed by his angel into the church
[41:02] then the time is at hand when he is
[41:05] revealed by his angel in the church then
[41:08] the time is at hand and never a time
[41:10] since the day until this day has the
[41:13] mystery of jesus christ ever been
[41:15] revealed until these last days for them
[41:18] the time is at hand
[41:21] amen i i think it's a powerful thing to
[41:24] realize that the book of revelations is
[41:25] something that was written not for that
[41:27] day but written for this day and that
[41:29] it's always amazed me that god wrote it
[41:31] in a symbol form so that the bride would
[41:34] have a book in the bible that was
[41:36] written to her that other people was
[41:38] going to read it but they're not going
[41:39] to understand it because it's a personal
[41:41] letter from christ to his bride and it
[41:44] would take a prophet or an angel to
[41:46] unseal that book to the church and when
[41:47] he does it then he would say then is the
[41:49] time at hand when the revelation comes
[41:52] now again and three kinds of believers
[41:54] brother bran will say it like this but
[41:55] you can see also the raptured church
[41:57] making himself ready it's a great scene
[42:00] you can see the presence of god
[42:01] vindicating making the great drama it's
[42:04] foretold here in the bible to act itself
[42:06] out what a time to live the most
[42:08] glorious time
[42:10] the man of all the ages has longed for
[42:13] this time the prophets of old long to
[42:15] see this hour but wasn't privileged and
[42:18] and and i thought i think of this and i
[42:20] think you know uh sometimes somebody
[42:22] will tell you oh my you should have been
[42:24] there you know or you should have seen
[42:25] this what a what a wonderful time and
[42:27] and you know sometimes you hear people
[42:29] say that and you think well it maybe
[42:31] didn't have to be that good to impress
[42:32] the person because you know some people
[42:34] don't read situations well but when you
[42:36] think about brother branham when you
[42:38] take a prophet like this and he tells
[42:41] you that this is the greatest of all the
[42:43] ages to live that this time that you're
[42:45] in is better than all the other times
[42:48] now this man's not saying this by not
[42:50] knowing he's saying this with the
[42:53] knowledge of a prophet of god and i i
[42:55] don't have to point out to you i know
[42:57] you know it but i think it's good to
[42:58] think about it amen but this man had
[43:01] visions of the garden of eden he he
[43:03] could tell you what color
[43:05] that he's eyes was what what color of
[43:07] hair her what he had visions of the
[43:09] cross he he told about jesus hanging on
[43:12] the cross 1955 vision the uh water from
[43:14] the rock and he actually while he's
[43:16] preaching he's breaking into visions and
[43:18] and he's telling you all these things
[43:20] and and by all the visions that he's had
[43:22] by all of the different dispensations
[43:24] it's been unlocked to him the scriptures
[43:26] that he's read he saw something about
[43:29] this age and he would say to you that
[43:31] this is the most glorious of all of the
[43:34] ages this is this is a man that has seen
[43:36] it and yet says i sing their day i see
[43:39] abraham's day i sing moses day i sing
[43:41] paul's day but your day is a more
[43:44] glorious day than all of the days that's
[43:46] ever lived now i say that because god is
[43:49] calling us into an experience and if
[43:52] we're not careful here today we will
[43:54] allow satan to devalue the experience
[43:58] that god is letting us live in and we'll
[44:00] be looking back and saying i wish i
[44:02] would have lived in that day or i wish i
[44:04] would have lived in another day and to
[44:06] think you're saying that while living in
[44:08] the greatest days that it's ever been so
[44:11] see satan can't change it he can't put
[44:13] you in another day so he can make you
[44:15] wish you was in another day he cannot he
[44:18] cannot take away the power of the
[44:20] experience of the word of god so he
[44:22] tries to explain away
[44:24] the the power of the experience that
[44:26] you're having but i i want to say that
[44:28] amen that if we could say it is in this
[44:30] way that god has called us into an
[44:32] experience that many men have longed to
[44:34] be but this is not an experience for the
[44:37] whole world amen we're experiencing
[44:39] things right now that it's not for
[44:41] everybody it's not a public show it's
[44:43] not a worldwide show it's not a national
[44:46] revival amen but i can find it in the
[44:48] bible that individuals had certain
[44:50] experiences with god that when god
[44:53] called them out and they would
[44:55] experience things other people wasn't
[44:56] experiencing but they were at the same
[44:59] time you know you go back and you read
[45:01] your history books and you can read
[45:02] about herod and you can read about rome
[45:04] and you can read about all these things
[45:06] that are happening but you know right in
[45:08] that same season of time when all those
[45:10] things was happening jesus christ was on
[45:12] the earth and he took three men in the
[45:15] bible matthew 17 he took three men and
[45:18] took them up on top of the mountain
[45:20] called mount transfiguration and those
[45:22] three men was experiencing things on the
[45:25] top of the mountain while politics was
[45:27] happening while trials were taking place
[45:30] while the world was going on the same as
[45:32] it did every day but they wasn't just
[45:35] having another day they was having a
[45:38] supernatural experience where they're
[45:40] transfiguring jesus christ where they
[45:42] were seeing him face to face upon the
[45:45] mountain a mountain of adoption a
[45:48] mountain of transfiguration a mountain
[45:51] where jesus was being revealed as the
[45:53] son of god right there they met while
[45:55] they were on the mountain they were
[45:57] seeing moses and they were seeing elijah
[45:59] and they in the bible tells us that
[46:02] peter becomes so overwhelmed by what he
[46:04] saw that he wanted to start building
[46:05] denominations he wanted to start
[46:07] building tabernacles to everybody but a
[46:10] shadow of a clown came over him amen and
[46:13] said listen amen just worship god amen
[46:16] amen just jesus just worship jesus amen
[46:19] and you know that any man that ever has
[46:22] a true experience with god is going to
[46:24] walk away in that spirit glorifying
[46:27] jesus christ
[46:28] amen and i think about these people upon
[46:30] this mountain and they're seeing this
[46:32] power and they're seeing this exhibition
[46:35] but the word that they heard come out of
[46:37] the cloud the voice they heard out of
[46:38] the cloud amen said hear ye him hear ye
[46:42] him now that's full of prophecy and
[46:45] that's full of of intention and that's
[46:47] full of power those just those little
[46:49] words hear ye him that's that's very
[46:51] powerful to the church of the living god
[46:53] because as it feels inside them you know
[46:56] you think about it when you go back
[46:57] there and you see jesus at jordan and
[47:00] you see the pillar of fire coming down
[47:02] and saying this is my beloved son but
[47:04] then you're seeing in matthew 17 we're
[47:06] starting to say here my here this is my
[47:08] beloved son but hear ye
[47:10] him now that means you have to hear him
[47:14] and not all the other voices now that's
[47:16] telling you you don't have to hear what
[47:19] everybody else is saying as long as you
[47:21] hear what he's say
[47:23] now it's one thing because he said in
[47:26] john 5 and 24 himself he that heareth my
[47:29] voice and believes me has passed from
[47:32] death into life and shall not come into
[47:34] condemnation is that right so then you
[47:36] find that you have to hear the voice of
[47:39] god for salvation for your power for
[47:41] your deliverance is that right but watch
[47:44] the scripture it said hear ye heal now
[47:46] the brother random will pick that up and
[47:48] he'll say that's a prophecy that he's
[47:50] going to speak in the last days that's a
[47:53] prophecy hear him means he's going to be
[47:56] speaking or he wouldn't tell you to
[47:58] listen so the same voice that they were
[48:01] listening to on the mountain will be the
[48:03] same voice that will be speaking in the
[48:05] last day and if you will hear that voice
[48:08] it will cause a transformation in your
[48:11] life and you will go from death unto
[48:13] life now how do you know the voice
[48:15] you're hearing is the same voice unless
[48:17] you can do an abstract on the voice is
[48:20] that right unless i can tell you where
[48:22] it was from the time it left jesus until
[48:26] the time i hear it today how can you
[48:28] tell me you're hearing the same voice
[48:30] but when william branham came he started
[48:32] with jesus christ and said here's the
[48:34] voice it went to paul in the first age
[48:37] and he brought it right down through
[48:38] seven ages and then he says i am the
[48:40] voice of god to you but just before he
[48:43] left the scene he said for the final
[48:46] voice for the final age will be the
[48:49] bride of jesus christ then the same
[48:52] voice that spoke on that mountain in the
[48:54] last day we'll be speaking through a
[48:56] five-fold ministry that have come under
[48:58] the authority of the prophet of god
[49:01] listen the experience you're having
[49:03] right now i know it's it's the devil's
[49:05] way to say look back and look back and
[49:07] look back but no child of god ought to
[49:09] ever have to look back there should be
[49:11] an experience going on right here right
[49:13] now inside this church of the living god
[49:16] where the glory and the power of the
[49:18] holy ghost is falling and we're
[49:20] recognizing who it is that is speaking
[49:22] to us or when peter describes it amen
[49:26] look what he said amen here ye him you
[49:28] know what the prophet of god said he
[49:29] said that put him back behind the word
[49:32] that put him back behind the word you
[49:34] know what he said when he said hear ye
[49:36] him he said that moved them back into
[49:38] the camp of eden it put them back in the
[49:41] same camp that adam and eve was in the
[49:43] garden of eden they were behind the word
[49:46] back there and the prophet of god is
[49:48] saying it put them back behind the word
[49:51] and today what has happened in the
[49:53] message of the hour what did the voice
[49:56] of the sign say get back to the word get
[49:59] back behind the word but i'm telling you
[50:01] tonight that you have had the same
[50:04] experience that they had in the bible
[50:06] home now transfiguration through the
[50:08] message of the hour it just puts you
[50:11] back amen behind the word of god and
[50:14] there's nothing more powerful than the
[50:15] word there's nothing more anointed than
[50:18] the word and if you're going to take a
[50:19] body change it'll be by the word if
[50:22] you're going to be delivered it'll be by
[50:23] the word it's adoption time back behind
[50:26] the word of god when peter describes it
[50:29] you know peter tells the story in second
[50:31] peter the first chapter he is describing
[50:33] what he saw on that mountain
[50:36] and he says
[50:37] he says now these are not fables these
[50:39] are not stories
[50:42] some little story i'm telling you he
[50:45] said i am an eyewitness
[50:47] of the majesty of god
[50:49] i'm an eyewitness of his majesty and
[50:51] then he begins to tell you a day star
[50:53] has risen and a more sure word of
[50:55] prophecy has come upon our life what is
[50:58] it when scripture is fulfilled then it
[51:00] shines as a day star into dark places
[51:04] amen and you think about where this
[51:05] message has shined into our lives amen
[51:08] people said that god wasn't a healer but
[51:10] he pierced the darkness and we saw the
[51:13] healing anointing people said god wasn't
[51:15] a deliverer but the word of the age has
[51:18] pierced the darkness of unbelief and
[51:20] critics and we've seen a deliverer rise
[51:22] up among us we've seen the healer we've
[51:24] seen the deliverer we've seen the
[51:26] prophetic words of god and how it comes
[51:29] into the church amen when peter
[51:31] described it he said a day star has
[51:33] risen and i'd like to echo those words
[51:35] in this hour this is not just a bunch of
[51:38] stories and a bunch of fables and
[51:40] william branham's ministries not just a
[51:42] bunch of little fables and stories put
[51:43] together hey remember that's a sure word
[51:46] of the prophecies of god coming to pass
[51:48] in this age this ain't just something
[51:50] little something this is the experience
[51:53] of mount transfiguration that we have
[51:55] climbed to pull them out and others have
[51:57] long deceit are you with me we bypass
[52:00] faith and temperance and knowledge we
[52:02] went on past virtue we went on past
[52:04] brotherly kindness until we've seen the
[52:07] capstone of the sovereign divine love
[52:10] the word itself has come back into the
[52:12] church and kept off a pride for the
[52:15] revelation of the age we're living my
[52:17] when i look and see where we're at today
[52:20] my
[52:21] when i think of the season
[52:23] and the times that we have lived in
[52:25] these seasons are pre-planned of god
[52:27] they're they're they're pre-scene of god
[52:29] when you you think you're a preacher
[52:31] what are you trying to tell you i'm
[52:32] trying to tell you that god can do great
[52:34] things in small crowds
[52:36] i'm trying to tell you god can do great
[52:38] things in small crowds you don't have to
[52:40] have a big crowd to have great things
[52:42] three of them went on the mountain with
[52:43] him but he did it on purpose he called
[52:46] them aside so that they could see the
[52:48] power of god without unbelief without
[52:50] unbelievers without skeptics without
[52:53] critics he called the believers out into
[52:55] a work of redemption my goodness when i
[52:58] think about it's an hour of resurrection
[53:00] church it's when god dismisses the
[53:02] unbelievers amen and calls the believers
[53:05] closer to manifest his promise and his
[53:08] word when god's going to do something
[53:10] he's ready to do it when there's
[53:12] believers in his midst you know you know
[53:14] what i'm saying this is the truth it's
[53:16] exactly what he done when they called
[53:17] him to come and rise jericho's daughter
[53:19] isn't it and and while he was on his way
[53:22] he said i'll come and wake her and while
[53:23] he was on his way while he was on the
[53:25] way she died on the way but did that
[53:27] stop the resurrection no it did not amen
[53:31] but he was on his way and did he not
[53:33] tell him back in the ages i'm on my way
[53:35] and many have died between that time and
[53:38] now but it don't stop the resurrection
[53:40] amen because their names is in the
[53:42] lamb's book of life but when he comes
[53:44] into the little room amen it's a time
[53:47] that he says i'm going to resurrect them
[53:49] and any unbeliever it's time to go any
[53:52] make believer i'm dismissing you this is
[53:55] the hour that the believer will witness
[53:57] the resurrection power in the church of
[53:59] the living god and this is the time it's
[54:02] why the separations come don't get
[54:04] excited don't get worried the unbeliever
[54:07] has to go to their place the the
[54:09] make-believer has to go to his place but
[54:12] the believer is being called into the
[54:14] position that god anointed you to come
[54:17] into and that position is a position of
[54:20] power a position of authority a position
[54:24] of witness and vision and revelation
[54:27] don't you underestimate the experience
[54:28] that god's calling you into just because
[54:31] there ain't a lot of people going don't
[54:33] mean it ain't wonderful and powerful
[54:34] when you get there
[54:38] come on church you know i'm telling you
[54:40] the truth it was only two who was
[54:42] walking on the road to emmaus when jesus
[54:45] himself came to them the bible said
[54:47] jesus himself drew near unto them and
[54:51] their eyes were holy now there's another
[54:53] one says he was in another form amen he
[54:55] was it same one in another form came
[54:58] near to them and can i say it to you
[55:00] like this it wasn't one like him it was
[55:02] him amen it wasn't one like jesus it was
[55:05] jesus
[55:06] he was just in another form and when
[55:09] their eyes were opened they saw it was
[55:12] the same jesus amen i tell you tonight
[55:15] we need an eye-opening service to
[55:18] recognize the same jesus is in here
[55:21] tonight in the form of the pride of
[55:23] jesus christ same power same authority
[55:27] same word
[55:28] my being invited into a place
[55:31] great things happen in little crowds
[55:34] look what he does he took him right
[55:35] there in that little room two of them
[55:38] and they got to go in the little room
[55:40] with him and while he was in that room
[55:42] the third pool began to open and they
[55:44] began to hear the bread being broke open
[55:46] by the one that wrote it are you hearing
[55:48] me this agent we're in now this ain't
[55:51] some little preacher wayne lawson this
[55:53] ain't some little pastor samuel amen
[55:56] that's not what we're talking about
[55:57] we're talking about the lamb taking a
[55:59] book and bringing a prophetic word that
[56:02] men without education men without men
[56:05] without abilities surrender themselves
[56:07] to an open word and they break the bread
[56:10] of life that same way he broke it in
[56:13] that day and brother let me tell you
[56:16] there's some bread eaters in the house
[56:18] tonight amen people that have seen it
[56:20] and have recognized
[56:22] spiritual food and due season an hour of
[56:25] the eating of the bread
[56:27] glory to god you know what i'm talking
[56:29] about the bread of communion the bread
[56:32] of eden and time communion and
[56:34] melchizedek bread and melchizedek feast
[56:38] the wine and bread and authority just at
[56:41] the changing of the body that's what
[56:42] they served in the exodus they served
[56:44] some bread it was unleavened bread
[56:46] and they ate it with their rods in their
[56:49] hand and the shoes on their feet and the
[56:51] bible said not even a feeble one left
[56:54] the place amen i'll tell you this
[56:56] there's a bride coming out today
[56:59] and she's not leaving feeble and she's
[57:01] not leaving sick but she's going to
[57:04] leave with a change
[57:08] amen by the way i wish the church was
[57:10] bigger i wish the bribe was bigger i
[57:12] seen some people leaving well i'll tell
[57:14] you what i don't care what happens in
[57:16] the numbers amen
[57:18] i'm worried about the value of the
[57:20] experience that i've been given
[57:23] amen
[57:24] i'm not going to say it's getting
[57:25] smaller because it's not
[57:27] that's just a plot of the plume of the
[57:28] devil that's just a lie the devil's
[57:31] telling somebody
[57:32] i just a few years ago was over in
[57:34] in india and there's one church in there
[57:36] apostolic church that come into the
[57:38] message i was a part of bringing them
[57:40] and it was 750 and the apostolics told
[57:42] them when you accept that message you're
[57:44] going to lose everybody in the building
[57:46] and you know what he did he said if it's
[57:47] the word of god if it costs me every
[57:49] person i don't care i'm going to stand
[57:51] with the word of god
[57:53] and you know what he did he didn't lose
[57:54] nobody but you know what else happened
[57:57] all of the ministries that he had raised
[57:59] up and sent out and started churches
[58:01] over about 30 of them they all accepted
[58:03] the message they accepted it in one
[58:05] meeting i was preaching that meeting and
[58:07] the pillar of fire came down and blew
[58:09] the building up and then thousands of
[58:11] people were receiving the holy ghost at
[58:13] the same hour and the people that saw
[58:16] that dynamic demonstration said any
[58:18] message that produces that much power i
[58:21] want to be a part of it and let me tell
[58:23] you you don't have to have a thousand
[58:25] people to know the power of the
[58:27] resurrection out of god and come in this
[58:29] building right here tonight
[58:35] well the last time i was over there
[58:37] brother samuel they broke out the walls
[58:39] they tore down the houses next door
[58:41] people gave up their houses and they
[58:43] emptied them out and they're filling
[58:44] them up with church people he went from
[58:46] 750 to about 2000 in a couple years you
[58:49] know what he did he dedicated himself to
[58:51] god and he believed the message with the
[58:53] power to preach it
[58:55] now i i cannot preach why i'm here let
[58:58] me say this there's some people that
[58:59] this message don't do nothing for it's
[59:02] because of their unbelief that the power
[59:04] of the message don't do any good for
[59:06] them
[59:06] they're so cowardly that they can't
[59:09] preach the message but because they
[59:11] believe the message then the
[59:13] denomination don't want nothing to do
[59:14] with them amen and then because the
[59:16] believer amen believes the message that
[59:19] when they hear the cowardness in a man
[59:22] they don't want to follow him because
[59:23] they ain't going to follow no coward
[59:25] amen so you ain't helping nobody by
[59:27] hiding the truth hey remember you've got
[59:29] to declare who you are declare it with
[59:31] power and let the believer be a believer
[59:34] and let the unbeliever be able to are
[59:36] you hearing me
[59:38] what sometimes sometimes i think amen
[59:41] that our 12 year old girls has got more
[59:43] more strength than some of our preachers
[59:45] amen some of them backslid they don't
[59:48] even know they wouldn't they wouldn't
[59:49] know amen the power of god if it walked
[59:51] up and tapped them on the shoulder
[59:54] well i might as well preach hadn't
[59:56] we got some young girls here we got who
[59:58] we got here how many young girls we got
[1:00:00] we got a couple right here you young
[1:00:02] ladies uh how old you are
[1:00:07] you're 11 how old are you
[1:00:08] yeah
[1:00:10] you're 38 you're not that young
[1:00:13] you are young
[1:00:14] according to me you are

[1:00:18] stand up for me would that be okay would
[1:00:19] i miss you no can you stand up for me
[1:00:22] she's 11 years old amen how old are you
[1:00:26] 20 stand up brother amen you you see
[1:00:28] these guys
[1:00:30] they go out on the street
[1:00:32] and they they wear this message
[1:00:34] and they conduct themselves by this
[1:00:36] message and then that little girl goes
[1:00:38] to the mall dressed like that she walks
[1:00:40] down the street dressed like you know
[1:00:42] why she dresses like that because a
[1:00:44] prophet taught to dress like that she's
[1:00:47] got more strength than some of the
[1:00:49] preachers that's got it that can't even
[1:00:51] preach it in a church full of believers
[1:00:53] amen but there are some believers in the
[1:00:55] last day that's going to cast aside
[1:00:58] every bit of the cowardice and every bit
[1:01:00] of the backup and they're going to say
[1:01:02] amen to the word of god what difference
[1:01:05] does it make you can laugh at me you can
[1:01:07] ridicule me amen but i'm going to feel
[1:01:10] the power of the experience that i'm in
[1:01:15] oh everybody rip it away from me
[1:01:20] he said preacher that's a little strong
[1:01:21] it's time to be strong
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:24] this is a wonderful time
[1:01:28] it's a wonderful time is it not
[1:01:30] could i say this but this is a bright
[1:01:32] time yeah y'all remember brother i'm
[1:01:34] saying it's a bright time you know what
[1:01:35] that that when a prophet says something
[1:01:38] like that he's telling you something of
[1:01:40] the age you're living the time you're
[1:01:42] living so he says bride time that phrase
[1:01:45] that he speaks opens up amen a change of
[1:01:49] relationship he's telling you bride time
[1:01:52] is not dating time
[1:01:54] you see this not church time it's not
[1:01:57] play church time this is pride time this
[1:02:00] is when the word and the church have
[1:02:03] become one and there's a relationship
[1:02:06] moving you not kitchen time not living
[1:02:09] room time it's a bedroom experience time
[1:02:12] you see when he says bright time amen i
[1:02:15] have to say it like this it's not only
[1:02:17] the experience you're having it's the
[1:02:19] experience you can have yes amen to you
[1:02:22] so brother we're having a great
[1:02:23] experience but how much more could you
[1:02:25] have
[1:02:26] if you only recognize the position
[1:02:28] you've been put in amen isn't there more
[1:02:31] that you can have than you're having hey
[1:02:33] remember when i say this and it's the
[1:02:35] experience of god it's a brother man
[1:02:37] we'll call it a bright time then maybe
[1:02:39] make it a little clearer he says it's a
[1:02:41] bright age many people see that i said
[1:02:43] people stumble over that i don't
[1:02:45] actually meet it means the seed has come
[1:02:47] out of the shuck you know how powerful
[1:02:49] that is because the seed that's in a
[1:02:51] shuck is bound to the shock
[1:02:53] the seed that's in the shock has to
[1:02:56] share its glory with the bondage of a
[1:02:59] shot in other words there's not a full
[1:03:00] expression that's not a full revealing
[1:03:03] it cannot really be who it is because
[1:03:05] it's in the bonds of a shock but once it
[1:03:09] comes out of it it can be exactly
[1:03:12] everything that's anointed to be and
[1:03:15] i'll tell you this bride has come out of
[1:03:16] this layout to see us shook and she's
[1:03:19] been put back into the word of god
[1:03:21] everything she's been called to be
[1:03:23] amen the prophet of god then he'll call
[1:03:25] it a son of man age
[1:03:27] amen hey amen he'll call it an adoption
[1:03:30] time
[1:03:32] an adoption time you see checkbook
[1:03:34] authority time can i say it like this
[1:03:36] amen that it's a time amen where there's
[1:03:38] not some age limit but a true seed of
[1:03:41] god has every promise that god given and
[1:03:44] everything that's in the bible has been
[1:03:46] promised to the seed of abraham
[1:03:48] whose seed we are
[1:03:51] according to the promises of god we
[1:03:53] promised a new body to live in a new
[1:03:55] earth amen in a brand new body that's a
[1:03:58] promise made to us and every promise
[1:04:01] that god made has been made to the
[1:04:02] church adoption time now saying it's
[1:04:04] adoption time seed time son of man age
[1:04:07] amen i thought this one was phenomenal
[1:04:10] it's a rapture age amen
[1:04:14] now what would that mean to you as a
[1:04:16] church it means that the cycles have
[1:04:19] changed
[1:04:20] we've been in a death cycle since the
[1:04:22] garden of eden
[1:04:23] amen now to see what a rapture age or
[1:04:26] cycle would mean you have to understand
[1:04:28] how we got where we are to understand
[1:04:31] what's happening
[1:04:32] to see the cause of it now i won't have
[1:04:34] time to preach on it in a depth but
[1:04:36] let's just say it like this job saw it
[1:04:39] amen and the prophet said he saw the
[1:04:41] corruption of the seed was the problem
[1:04:43] so in the garden of eden when death come
[1:04:46] in was when satan reasoned with eve on
[1:04:49] the word
[1:04:50] and it polluted the word so you've got
[1:04:53] death from that time
[1:04:55] all the way through
[1:04:56] but then there's a season where the
[1:04:58] bible said that the incorruptible word
[1:05:02] would come and the church would be able
[1:05:04] to take on incorruption that the mortal
[1:05:07] would take on immortality so it's got to
[1:05:10] be a season of immortality it's going to
[1:05:13] be a season of incorruption and and to
[1:05:16] get any season you've got to have a word
[1:05:19] so the word is a word of the righteous
[1:05:22] cycle that changes it from death unto
[1:05:25] life when we're taking in this message
[1:05:27] we're not taking in death we're taking
[1:05:28] it alive
[1:05:29] and life is coming into the church amen
[1:05:32] that we have turned a corner
[1:05:34] again again remember say it like this
[1:05:36] we've turned a corner
[1:05:37] dispensational change uh to a builder it
[1:05:41] means that you've come through the
[1:05:42] corners and now you're going to change
[1:05:44] your corner right
[1:05:46] take somebody to lay it out to get it in
[1:05:47] the right place to get the change in the
[1:05:50] right place right it's a corner but once
[1:05:53] you get through the corner
[1:05:55] about anybody can lay a light
[1:05:57] amen anybody can go and you watch how
[1:05:59] william branham came as a mason
[1:06:02] and he turned the corner for the church
[1:06:05] and he turned us from this pentecostal
[1:06:07] age into not a flat corner amen but he
[1:06:10] turned us upward amen and he put us back
[1:06:13] into the eternal lands of god now the
[1:06:16] church
[1:06:17] brother man said you got to slow down at
[1:06:18] the corner see you got to take your time
[1:06:21] be careful at the corner
[1:06:23] but once you get the corner made
[1:06:25] it's time for the church to run like
[1:06:27] never before
[1:06:28] it's a time for the bride of christ can

[1:06:33] time for you to run

[1:06:46] finish line
[1:06:48] there's nothing between you and the
[1:06:50] finish line there's no messengers coming
[1:06:52] there's no revivals coming there's
[1:06:55] nothing else coming amen what is
[1:06:57] happening now is a bride is taking the
[1:07:00] message of her day and she's running

[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:34] well
[1:12:35] i believe the word itself is calling
[1:12:38] amen this bright church is manifesting
[1:12:40] time
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:42] calendars
[1:12:43] calendars ain't changing
[1:12:46] calendars don't change seasons
[1:12:48] god changes the seasons
[1:12:51] i haven't been amazed at this many times
[1:12:53] people say well by the way and i tell
[1:12:55] people and when you're going to serve
[1:12:56] the lord when you're going to really
[1:12:58] serve the lord they said well there'll
[1:12:59] be a time
[1:13:01] there's coming a time someday sometime
[1:13:03] it's going to be coming amen and they
[1:13:05] think that if they give it some time
[1:13:07] somehow it's going to get better between
[1:13:08] then and now
[1:13:09] but you know what amen time doesn't
[1:13:11] change things
[1:13:13] matter of fact generally it makes it
[1:13:15] harder with the amount of time you spend
[1:13:17] and seeing the more scars more troubles
[1:13:19] more problems amen it actually becomes
[1:13:21] harder you become colder things become
[1:13:25] more embedded in you
[1:13:26] now i can prove it i don't i don't want
[1:13:28] to take a lot of time this but i could
[1:13:30] prove it to you if you go down to an old
[1:13:32] folks home over here a retirement
[1:13:34] village somewhere and them old men are
[1:13:36] still chasing them women
[1:13:38] they still dirty old men
[1:13:40] because they were dirty young men and
[1:13:42] they just got old
[1:13:43] so just because they got old didn't mean
[1:13:45] they got a better heart
[1:13:47] amen they just got old that's all that
[1:13:49] happened people still smoking drinking
[1:13:51] committing adultery running doing
[1:13:52] whatever and they're old people doing it
[1:13:55] because they never met somebody to
[1:13:58] change them and they kept waiting for
[1:14:00] time to change it and time don't change
[1:14:03] it come on sin is worse today than it
[1:14:05] was 5 000 years ago
[1:14:09] time ain't gonna change it
[1:14:11] well we might as well preach since we're
[1:14:13] here haven't we time ain't going to
[1:14:14] change it amen so we got to have a
[1:14:16] season of change we got to have a season
[1:14:19] for change i mean when i was i was
[1:14:21] looking this i thought it's amazing it's
[1:14:23] that the man to pull up bethesda another
[1:14:25] proof 38 years he spent at the pool 38
[1:14:28] years amen he had been in an infliction
[1:14:32] for 38 years if time was going to fix it
[1:14:35] he would have been healed
[1:14:37] if time would would heal him he would
[1:14:39] have been healed by 38 years he had been
[1:14:41] at the pool
[1:14:42] amen and the bible said a certain man
[1:14:45] in a certain season amen speaking to you
[1:14:49] speaking to me a certain man not just
[1:14:51] anybody but a certain person but you
[1:14:53] stay in something for a long time
[1:14:56] amen but it'll take a certain season to
[1:14:59] bring change now that season came when
[1:15:01] the angel came to the pool amen but the
[1:15:04] bible tells us the season he was in was
[1:15:07] not just an angel but the very god of
[1:15:10] the angels amen the very angel of the
[1:15:13] covenant jesus christ was the one in his
[1:15:16] season do you understand what i'm saying
[1:15:18] to you you're not just getting a
[1:15:20] messenger at this time you're not just
[1:15:22] getting another church age messenger but
[1:15:24] the season you're living in the angel
[1:15:27] that has came is the angel of the
[1:15:30] covenant jesus christ has come to make a
[1:15:33] change
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:38] now
[1:15:38] i could easily tell you that that change
[1:15:40] is coming through a pillar of fire is
[1:15:42] that right
[1:15:43] that pillar of fire is jesus christ paul
[1:15:45] met him on the road right paul met him
[1:15:47] said lord who are you jehovah who are
[1:15:49] you he said i am jesus he said i come
[1:15:52] from god and returned to god he came
[1:15:54] from the light returned back to the
[1:15:55] light so that light was jesus christ
[1:15:59] that same light that wrote the bible
[1:16:01] amen comes in the end time and appears
[1:16:04] over william branham's head amen and and
[1:16:06] just for the record we didn't take the
[1:16:08] picture are you with me just for the
[1:16:10] record we didn't take the picture in sam
[1:16:12] houston coliseum before a bunch of
[1:16:14] people amen a picture was taken to the
[1:16:17] pillar of fire now the people that took
[1:16:19] it was our critics
[1:16:20] so they didn't fix it up for us they
[1:16:22] didn't help us out they were our critics
[1:16:24] trying to destroy the work of that
[1:16:26] ministry but god amen said who can be
[1:16:29] against you if i before you
[1:16:33] now that same one was called the angel
[1:16:35] the covenant of the holy ghost and the
[1:16:37] man calls it the pillar of fire the same
[1:16:39] one now that pillar of fire and who's
[1:16:41] this melchizedek in 1965 brother ram
[1:16:44] said that pillar of fire amen he says it
[1:16:46] comes among us can you imagine the
[1:16:49] purifier comes among us now you might
[1:16:51] ask what does he come here for what's
[1:16:52] the purpose of his coming he said it's
[1:16:55] something to change our hearts
[1:16:58] oh god
[1:17:00] you mean christ himself
[1:17:02] has come to change our hearts
[1:17:05] he didn't just send an angel he didn't
[1:17:07] just send somebody he come himself
[1:17:10] he come to change our heart because
[1:17:12] actually as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:17:15] he is
[1:17:17] so the problems that we have is not the
[1:17:20] world the problems we have is in our own
[1:17:22] heart
[1:17:23] the issues that we face the problems we
[1:17:26] have it's not the world it's our heart
[1:17:29] amen you can have a thousand liquor
[1:17:31] stores but if it's not in your heart
[1:17:33] they go out of business
[1:17:35] amen the store is full of cigarettes i
[1:17:39] don't buy one of them because it's not
[1:17:41] in my heart to do it
[1:17:44] so you can close all of them but if it's
[1:17:47] in your heart it's not going to help but
[1:17:49] christ didn't come just to close down
[1:17:51] the liquor store he come to change your
[1:17:54] heart
[1:17:56] amen
[1:17:57] now
[1:17:58] you got to see in matthew chapter 24 he
[1:18:01] says
[1:18:02] he says this when the parable of the fig
[1:18:04] tree comes forth they know the season
[1:18:06] see the fig tree of the season it's a
[1:18:08] summer right
[1:18:09] when you see the fig tree put forth bud
[1:18:11] know the season is changed the summer is
[1:18:13] nigh
[1:18:14] he says see the summer is nigh in
[1:18:17] matthew 24 33 he says it like this that
[1:18:20] it's near even
[1:18:21] at the door
[1:18:23] amen see even at the door now if you go
[1:18:25] back to the revelations you watch in
[1:18:27] revelation chapter 2 coming up to the
[1:18:29] church ages jesus will say a repent or
[1:18:32] else i will come quickly
[1:18:35] but in revelation 3 and 20th allowed to
[1:18:37] see an age he said i stand at the door
[1:18:41] the season that israel's a nation the
[1:18:43] same season that the bride will receive
[1:18:46] the visitation of the pillar of fire
[1:18:49] in a heart transitioning message
[1:18:52] that will actually have the power to
[1:18:54] change the heart to a purity in the most
[1:18:57] evil of all the ages it ever was that
[1:19:00] will be hearts that will be turned back
[1:19:02] to god by the power of a vindicated word
[1:19:06] it will not be done by socialism it will
[1:19:09] not be done by traditions amen
[1:19:11] churchianity can't do it preachers can't
[1:19:13] do it amen memberships can't do it
[1:19:16] confessions can't do it it will take the
[1:19:19] personal presence of jesus christ by the
[1:19:23] baptism of the holy ghost to come into
[1:19:26] the being of a person and he will change
[1:19:29] their heart now notice what he says i
[1:19:31] stand at the door and knock if any man
[1:19:33] hear my voice and open i
[1:19:35] will come unto him
[1:19:38] i will come unto him of course in a
[1:19:40] broad sense he's speaking of laodicea
[1:19:42] and christ is on the outside
[1:19:44] in a personal sense it's talking about
[1:19:47] christ speaking to the heart you see a
[1:19:49] prophecy laying here
[1:19:51] i will come in the age of laodicea in
[1:19:53] this dark age and speak personally
[1:19:56] to your heart
[1:19:59] the god of heaven
[1:20:00] having a personal visitation with you
[1:20:04] can you imagine sitting in a little
[1:20:05] service like this and all of a sudden
[1:20:08] god starts talking to your heart
[1:20:10] and he's doing it to fulfill prophecy i
[1:20:13] will come unto you i will speak unto you
[1:20:16] i will knock at your heart see a knock
[1:20:18] he says that he that hears my voice
[1:20:21] so the knock is the voice of god talking
[1:20:24] to you
[1:20:25] god knocking trying to bring change to
[1:20:28] your life is when god starts speaking to
[1:20:30] you you see the voices what's doing it
[1:20:33] look what he said he that heareth my
[1:20:34] voice harden not your heart as they did
[1:20:37] in the days of provocation but open the
[1:20:39] door and let christ come into thy heart
[1:20:43] let the voice of god begin to come in
[1:20:45] the heart now
[1:20:46] he didn't promise to send someone he
[1:20:48] said i will come i personal pronoun i'm
[1:20:51] not an english major but that's personal
[1:20:55] i i will come unto you now if you could
[1:20:58] take that eye could we preach a month no
[1:21:00] matter what
[1:21:01] i
[1:21:02] i i think about this i
[1:21:04] the one that created the heavens and
[1:21:06] earth had said i'll personally come and
[1:21:08] talk to you
[1:21:10] the one that hung the stars in their
[1:21:12] place and put the moon and said to the
[1:21:15] sun where it could stand fill the oceans
[1:21:17] with water put the flowers on the
[1:21:20] mountain sprinkle the trees with the
[1:21:22] with the birds and the insects of the
[1:21:25] land put man upon the earth that one
[1:21:28] that can do all of that with by the
[1:21:31] speaking of his word said i will come
[1:21:34] into your heart
[1:21:37] think about it the creator of heavens
[1:21:39] and earth has become a renovator of your
[1:21:42] life
[1:21:43] amen you have just invited the greatest
[1:21:46] renovator that ever lives amen a new
[1:21:49] creation will take place inside you he
[1:21:52] will come and put it back like it was in
[1:21:55] the garden of eden
[1:21:58] i've often said it like this you could
[1:22:00] put a three-year-old turning loose in
[1:22:01] your house for a couple hours he can
[1:22:03] tear it up so bad you didn't you you i
[1:22:05] tell you what you let a three-year-old
[1:22:07] just do what they want in the house and
[1:22:08] see what happens they'll pull everything
[1:22:10] down put everything out of place now you
[1:22:12] you take them back there and you be
[1:22:14] serious about it and put them and say
[1:22:16] look i'm giving you all day to put it
[1:22:18] back like it was or i'm going to spank
[1:22:19] you well you might as well spank them to
[1:22:21] start with they can't put it back
[1:22:23] you know why they can't because they
[1:22:24] don't know why it was there
[1:22:26] they can't put it back and they don't
[1:22:28] know why it was there it would take the
[1:22:30] one that put it there to put it back
[1:22:32] and all these theologians and all these
[1:22:34] psychologists they'll never fix you
[1:22:37] they'll never fix that heart it'll take
[1:22:40] the god that created you ain't meant to
[1:22:43] play it back
[1:22:44] in the place that it come from the
[1:22:47] creator has become a renovator and he's
[1:22:50] come into your life and so they've
[1:22:52] misplaced this and they misplaced this
[1:22:54] and they misplaced this and you know
[1:22:55] what he said he'll knock and he's not
[1:22:57] knocking at the door of your house he's
[1:22:59] knocking at the door of your heart he's
[1:23:01] not just wanting to come home with you
[1:23:03] he's wanting to come into your life and
[1:23:06] any door you'll open up in that life he
[1:23:08] will come in there
[1:23:12] and he will rearrange it
[1:23:15] to the divine order
[1:23:17] can you imagine your life being in order
[1:23:19] but a divine order
[1:23:20] but every room in there amen every room
[1:23:23] that the spirit goes into is a divine
[1:23:25] order
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:28] let him come he said i will
[1:23:30] i will come unto you
[1:23:32] i will come into you i will come in and
[1:23:34] reveal i'll come in and sub now now that
[1:23:36] prophecy is an eye which is personal
[1:23:39] which is christ coming in there that's
[1:23:41] amazing because he's doing it by
[1:23:42] prophecy in revelation 3 the same as
[1:23:45] jesus did it in the scripture when he
[1:23:47] came into jerusalem do you know do you
[1:23:49] know that they gave the very dates
[1:23:51] daniel could have gave you the very
[1:23:53] dates christ come into the cities of
[1:23:54] jerusalem but by prophecy of zechariah
[1:23:57] line they could have told you that their
[1:23:59] king would come riding the color of the
[1:24:01] horse he would write
[1:24:02] they would they could tell you by
[1:24:04] prophecy that the the mule he would ride
[1:24:07] would not have him been rolled it will
[1:24:09] be a white foal and it will not have
[1:24:11] even been written and your king will
[1:24:14] come right in it in the name of the lord
[1:24:16] and and by daniel they could have told
[1:24:18] you the very day he was coming amen had
[1:24:21] they watched the prophecies they would
[1:24:24] have knew exactly who it was brother
[1:24:26] ma'am said when he come riding down
[1:24:28] there that day amen and they begin to
[1:24:30] say blessed is he that cometh in the
[1:24:31] name of the lord he said see they begin
[1:24:33] to feel the atmosphere was full amen and
[1:24:36] and and when they heard the people
[1:24:38] rejoicing and they saw him riding in he
[1:24:41] said they begin to say who is this
[1:24:46] amen now think about that who is this
[1:24:48] now now the brother man will say he'll
[1:24:50] tie it together for us and he'll say it
[1:24:52] and who's this in 1959 he'll say look he
[1:24:55] said the city went out pouring the
[1:24:56] waters washing their pots ceremonies
[1:24:58] crying who's in a hosanna screaming to
[1:25:01] the top of their voice
[1:25:02] oh i can imagine what those people see
[1:25:05] who is interrupting our church
[1:25:07] who's interrupting our church service
[1:25:09] with all this noise do you think that
[1:25:11] stopped them the very christ that they
[1:25:13] had looked for was right with them how
[1:25:16] could you stop them
[1:25:18] amen what is it they see who is it they
[1:25:21] begin to say this causing the stare who
[1:25:24] is this who's got this little group of
[1:25:26] people wrapped up around him who's
[1:25:28] causing this
[1:25:30] see they said who is it but the people
[1:25:32] that it was being stirred up knew who it
[1:25:34] was
[1:25:35] they knew that that was the king
[1:25:37] prophesied in zechariah that's why amen
[1:25:40] that's why that's why when they said to
[1:25:42] jesus they said look can you make these
[1:25:45] people hold it down a little you seem to
[1:25:47] be the source of this could you just
[1:25:49] quiet these people a little bit and
[1:25:51] jesus said to them amen if i tell them
[1:25:54] to hold their peace
[1:25:55] he said these rocks are going to cry out
[1:25:58] listen church amen i know there's people
[1:26:01] that would like us to to hush up a
[1:26:03] little about this message i know they
[1:26:06] don't want us to quote the prophet and
[1:26:07] preach the word and shout about the age
[1:26:10] that we're in and the things that god's
[1:26:12] doing but if we hold our peace
[1:26:15] the rocks are going to stand up out
[1:26:17] there and start preaching the message of
[1:26:20] the hour
[1:26:23] all creation all creation has longed to
[1:26:27] see the day
[1:26:28] and we see it and we see it and it ain't
[1:26:32] happening it ain't happening in the
[1:26:34] church it ain't happening down the road
[1:26:37] it's happening in my heart
[1:26:41] oh can you imagine when he started
[1:26:43] riding into jerusalem and they didn't
[1:26:46] they didn't have anything to worship
[1:26:48] with they didn't have anything you know
[1:26:49] what the bible said they start taking
[1:26:51] the palm leaves off the trees
[1:26:53] and throwing them down they start taking
[1:26:54] off their coats and throwing before and
[1:26:56] crying hosanna hosanna blessed is he
[1:26:59] that comes in the name of the lord and
[1:27:01] to think tonight that that same one that
[1:27:03] rolled then is riding again on the last
[1:27:06] days he's coming come on church amen
[1:27:09] he's not going to ride he's riding
[1:27:10] tonight he meant it wasn't william plant
[1:27:13] them riding the trail it would be jesus
[1:27:15] christ riding the trail again and here
[1:27:19] he is tonight
[1:27:20] riding right here in the church of the
[1:27:22] living god
[1:27:24] the vindicated word has carried you into
[1:27:28] an anointing and the people begin to
[1:27:29] shout they begin to rejoice and others
[1:27:31] look around and say why what is this
[1:27:33] who's causing this amen people say i've
[1:27:36] had people tell me hey mr brother wayne

[1:33:26] things happen amen amen
[1:33:29] what's now he went to a tent
[1:33:31] down in the tombs of gardea
[1:33:33] and it was a man bound by
[1:33:35] by a legion of demons
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:39] and jesus being a frail humble man
[1:33:42] the bible said not much to look at
[1:33:43] brother brahman said he was frail and
[1:33:45] humble and when the demon in that man
[1:33:48] rose up he said we'll go down and
[1:33:49] destroy this man he wasn't nothing to
[1:33:51] look at
[1:33:52] we'll destroy him like we have everybody
[1:33:54] else but brother ram said when that
[1:33:55] devil got down there and faced up with
[1:33:57] jesus
[1:33:58] he said jesus lifted his head and looked
[1:34:01] into the eyes of that man he said when
[1:34:03] he connected eyes he said that devil
[1:34:06] said what are you doing in there
[1:34:08] amen see elohim had come the one that
[1:34:11] kicked that devil out in the beginning

[1:34:37] god is following the anointing of the
[1:34:39] holy ghost is moving upon the church you
[1:34:42] see what he said to that devil take your
[1:34:43] leave loose the man and let him go
[1:34:46] and i'll tell you the same anointing is
[1:34:48] still here today visiting the church
[1:34:51] it's visiting in the holy ghost
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:34:56] it's a powerful time to live
[1:34:59] now you think we've been here too long
[1:35:01] i don't mean tonight i mean in time
[1:35:03] by the way why didn't the lord already
[1:35:05] come why is this situation already over
[1:35:06] why we already raptured do you know the
[1:35:09] bible the program said as it was in the
[1:35:10] days of noah right
[1:35:12] and we look at the evil side brother of
[1:35:14] them said there's more to it than just
[1:35:15] the evil he said it's also called the
[1:35:17] day of long suffering
[1:35:19] and god is not slack concerning his
[1:35:21] promise but he is gracious and lone
[1:35:23] suffering with people to get their
[1:35:25] hearts right yeah
[1:35:30] now i've been in some meetings when they
[1:35:31] went a little long actually one time i
[1:35:33] was preaching i was preaching at the
[1:35:34] church uh brother erickson's and and i
[1:35:37] was actually preaching on time and i was
[1:35:39] talking about i was actually talking
[1:35:41] about god giving you a lot of time and
[1:35:44] it was up to you what you do with that a
[1:35:45] lot of time
[1:35:46] and i'm talking about your time on earth
[1:35:48] your grace god gives you what you do
[1:35:50] with that grace and i was just
[1:35:51] ministering all that we come to the end
[1:35:53] of the service and and i felt a nice
[1:35:55] pull but i turned the meeting over to
[1:35:57] brother erickson and brother actually
[1:35:59] gets up behind the pulpit and he starts
[1:36:00] singing a song and if you know brother
[1:36:02] ray he never does this
[1:36:04] but in the middle as he starts singing
[1:36:06] the song he said folks he said god's not
[1:36:08] done in here today
[1:36:09] he said i feel like somebody needs
[1:36:11] something from the lord
[1:36:12] and he just started singing a song when
[1:36:14] he did a lady got up and come up to the
[1:36:16] front the sister is a little bit a good
[1:36:18] friend of ours we know her well
[1:36:19] tremendous sister but she had been
[1:36:21] carrying the guilt from an abusive thing
[1:36:24] happened when she was a little girl i
[1:36:25] think maybe an uncle or something had
[1:36:27] abused her as a little child and her
[1:36:30] whole adult life she had been carrying
[1:36:32] that guilt like she done something wrong
[1:36:35] and she had carried that and carried
[1:36:37] that and karen and in the middle of that
[1:36:38] search she gets up and comes in the end
[1:36:40] of the service now listen to me in the
[1:36:41] end of the service
[1:36:43] amen in a prolonged moment of the
[1:36:45] service in a long suffering moment in
[1:36:48] that service and she gets up and comes
[1:36:50] up there and when she does amen we pray
[1:36:53] for him the spirit left her right
[1:36:55] and and i realized right then
[1:36:58] that god had created
[1:37:00] a little moment on the end of that
[1:37:02] service to give her at deliverance and i
[1:37:05] thought isn't that amazing she would
[1:37:07] have had to live the rest of her life
[1:37:10] unless god would give her that specific
[1:37:12] moment and you think about this because
[1:37:14] brother branham said that god created
[1:37:17] time
[1:37:18] because of the devil is that right
[1:37:20] he said in end time he will destroy the
[1:37:23] devil and all redemption will take place
[1:37:25] that's where the cross happened that's
[1:37:26] redemption takes place now think about
[1:37:28] eternity and a devil in eternity but god
[1:37:32] created time as a place to destroy the
[1:37:37] devil so we don't have to live in
[1:37:39] eternity with no devil
[1:37:40] and god created this moment in time to
[1:37:44] destroy the works of the enemy in your
[1:37:47] life amen that you don't have to live
[1:37:49] the rest of your life with some devil
[1:37:51] this thing about laws and works this is
[1:37:54] about living free this is about living
[1:37:57] under the holy ghost power of god amen
[1:38:00] amen to think right now that god is
[1:38:02] created
[1:38:03] and created a time i know that's a
[1:38:05] special time time's at hand but what
[1:38:07] time what time is the time when satan's
[1:38:09] cast down
[1:38:10] a time when satan is destroyed a time in
[1:38:13] christ is knocking at your heart
[1:38:15] a time when we're running like never
[1:38:16] before a time the rapture anointing a
[1:38:19] time of the experience of the bride of
[1:38:21] christ
[1:38:22] a very time that we're living right now
[1:38:25] you see even in this in this service
[1:38:27] right now
[1:38:29] a time that god has created
[1:38:31] that you can you can break the bonds
[1:38:33] amen of unbelief
[1:38:36] little little things that you've had to
[1:38:38] carry
[1:38:39] burn you little things that you
[1:38:41] that you're concerned with and they
[1:38:42] trouble you they keep you out of that
[1:38:44] sweet experience with christ
[1:38:47] this meeting right here god can create a
[1:38:49] moment in time
[1:38:51] to squash that spirit in your heart
[1:38:54] amen maybe you ain't got the power to
[1:38:56] kick him out maybe the power maybe you
[1:38:59] don't have the power to do it yourself
[1:39:01] but he said i'm knocking yes amen and
[1:39:04] you let him in
[1:39:07] he doesn't kick the devil out one time
[1:39:09] i guarantee you can do it again
[1:39:13] you let him in tonight
[1:39:15] watch what he does stand your feet
[1:39:16] tonight let our music players come
[1:39:22] it's a time
[1:39:27] it's a time when angelic battles
[1:39:31] have become human battles
[1:39:34] it's that time
[1:39:38] but the bible said they overcame him
[1:39:42] by the blood of the lamb
[1:39:45] and the word
[1:39:47] of their testimony
[1:39:48] now how could you testify this tonight
[1:39:50] lest god give it to you from a prophet
[1:39:54] how could you say it tonight
[1:39:56] how could you say the things that we say
[1:39:58] unless god would give you a prophet
[1:40:01] but because he's given us a prophet with
[1:40:02] a prophetic word he's gave us a word to
[1:40:05] speak
[1:40:08] and through that word the greatest
[1:40:09] weapon that's ever been given to the
[1:40:11] earth
[1:40:12] there's not a greater weapon ever been
[1:40:13] given
[1:40:15] you can you can use that you can use
[1:40:16] that word
[1:40:18] you can get out of anything
[1:40:20] is that right get out of anything listen

[1:40:24] i i believe tonight that you can break
[1:40:26] out of it
