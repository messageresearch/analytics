see Jesus you told me just Jesus keeps welding me every day I see serving me faithfully overcome try guarding me constantly we live easily Jesus keeps her see Zuri let's see Jesus keeps homey I appreciate that tonight amen you know there's nothing like a song when a song sung by experienced Amen because when you think God gave the song he gave the song to the rider by an inspiration of an experience they went through you know this many of the things that I've just been studying over the different times here and it was probably from a few months ago but you know when you study some of you I know have studied some of the writers of hymns and when you get into looking at them it to me it's things that just astound me you read it and you cry it touches your life like a song that we know so well hold to God's unchanging hand that song itself when it was wrote he was wrote by a person if I have everything I've got the story here and one of my notes but it was written by a person who had suffered a spinal accident when they were just about in their teens but then they began they wrote wrote this song and they didn't realize what it would turn out to be it ended up being in a Sunday School literature then they realized oh my this is this song was in there you know they never did it for anything of money it was just an experience and one thing about this writer when they wrote that song hold to God's unchanging hand and how that God had so moved in their life they had a situation in their life that it's so interrupted them to where from that moment on they were bound within a chair because of the spinal condition but one of the things we're saying I thought was so interesting is that they said in all of the countless hymns that this sister wrote she never once let her infirmities be projected in any songs that's powerful that's powerful all that she suffered she never allowed it to be projected in songs but she always wrote by inserting inspiration hold to God's changing in many other songs that she wrote but when you look at that I looked at that I'll tell you just you know you think about if you read I said Lord just the other day I said I'm gonna meet that sister I'm gonna meet her because I believe she's one of the elect of God amen a rugged believer who could stand in an hour I'm we're gonna meet her so there's an experience from that comes from those songs and we just thank God from that that it's truly he's given us strength to overcome our trials and that wonderful it's so real in our lives it's him amen we just have some some requests to take before the Lord here tonight in prayer from brother Shane it says please pray for an old high-school buddy of mine his name is Danny Fortney and is going through chemo to treat a form of cancer he's the same age as me so we want to remember Danny Fortney in prayer tonight that God will just undertake for his need there a request here for brother material his brother immaterial Reyes in Honduras he's having having heart issues let's remember him in prayer and also when I continue want to continue remember brother Monaco could be us and prayer to the Lord or just continue to to give him strength he's doing better but I know that what sister Caroline had mentioned he still just seems like not as strong as what he was so we want the Lord just ask that God will just strengthen him also got a text from brother Andrew Glover here today and brother Andrew Glover is he was just getting on the plane almost to go to in route to New Zealand so for a meeting so we want to keep brother Andrew Glover in prayer that God will just bless watch over our brother blessed the meetings there for the bill how do you pronounce this other name sister Mary's sister Amparo Amparo okay thank you so remember sister Mary's sister Amparo also brother enesta Mendoza senior he's getting stronger we want to just continue to hold him up prayer God will just continue to strengthen him pray for the missionaries and for the mission work and also for the backsliders amen let's also pray that the the bride throughout the the world the Lord would would help her amen please from this from sister Rita please continue to keep brother herb in prayer as well as crystal and the grandchildren Keith David Robin and Teresa so we want to keep them them in prayer please keep a sister and Miranda's grandson Zachary and prayer for healing he's at the rainbow babies hospital with a blood infection I know he's been admitted into the ICU when they woke up you you know the request he's been in and out of the hospital they have what's called a sister Anna told me today or this morning on the phone I can't remember the name of the disease but where he's been in and out of the hospital he's three years old and this morning when he woke up it was just blood that was just coming out so they're gonna have they're gonna have to do a blood transfusion and it's just been continuous for them and so we want to just hold them up in prayer because you know and as I was praying this morning I was talking to my sister Hannah it's already something that can be very fearful when you know the Lord as far as a condition like that be but then when you take that within the situation of someone who really doesn't know the Lord are you don't know where they stand with and I'm talking about the parents with that that's to me that would be very scary because it's one thing you know fear itself that it comes in different aspects of things and we look at some times because it's the conditions it's the uncertainty we do know that God has everything under control but sometimes it's just like where they've been through or others have been through you you get weary as you're continuing to tend to something and some of you that's been you've been through different things you know sometimes you just get weary and you need strength within it and you know sometimes you get good news and then you get bad news and then you get good news and so I know that we would be able to you know enter in for that for that little Zachary sister Anna Miranda's her great grandson so let's remember him in prayer as well as the the whole family there please continue to keep sister Linda cavillo in prayer she requests prayer for her son Pete he needs he needs the Lord in his life so you keep him in prayers I just got a text the other evening and asked that if I would call him so you keep would you keep him in prayer and just I don't know what what I know that God's the answer I know that the Lord is the answer for for the needs in his life and in and it will truly take the Lord to do that work so we just want to be mindful of that tonight that God will move because he needs the Lord in a very great way there's any other requests tonight that maybe you forgot to write down there's one that struck your heart the meantime here any other requests for the Richard right right right yes sister Betsy and sister Stephanie let's continue to keep them in prayer you know sister Betsy you know with her foot she's the foot that's it's been a it's been a process because she tore some
