[38:50] Halu amen it's nothing but the
[38:53] truth amen but you're
[38:56] loving just appreciate him it's so good
[38:58] to see each and every one of you and we
[39:01] say that but we mean it anden good to
[39:04] see different ones that are back from
[39:06] sickness and fighting the battle and
[39:08] pressing the battle and we are so
[39:11] thankful to the Lord for his mercies and
[39:14] uh that's I just want to continue to
[39:17] hold up I know brother um Carlos was
[39:20] just uh was here you seen him he greeted
[39:23] you and so I think they've come
[39:25] to the
[39:27] having to come to a decision with uh his
[39:31] father-in-law U there was a the lungs
[39:33] themselves had made a turn for the good
[39:36] on Friday morning and um but when he
[39:40] went into the hospital there and uh just
[39:45] so many strokes that he had while uh he
[39:48] was out and so when they went to uh
[39:51] bring him back and they were just
[39:53] testing that with taking the ventilator
[39:54] out and so forth uh
[39:58] they you know had told the the the
[40:00] family yesterday that it was in a state
[40:02] in a condition that you know uh a lot
[40:06] more of things they would have had to
[40:07] have done and so you know the family
[40:11] that's some of you have been there
[40:13] you've been in those decisions where you
[40:15] had to make that and I remember how it
[40:18] was with with with my dad when we had to
[40:20] make a decision and uh you know like
[40:23] that and and arrest others too you know
[40:26] I remember Sister Mary May for being
[40:27] there for that and um so there's a lot
[40:31] of things that can pull upon the heart
[40:33] but I just pray that God will just bring
[40:35] such a
[40:36] Unity because emotions we have our
[40:38] emotions we have our feelings is that
[40:40] right and Satan Satan's always an
[40:42] opportunist he likes to take situations
[40:44] and try to step into it you know it's
[40:47] just like brother bam says a bruised
[40:49] cell he said if can Satan can get in
[40:51] there then it creates a cancer so we
[40:54] just want to pray that the Lord will
[40:56] just give them a real PE peace and a
[40:58] direction uh when I spoke with brother
[41:00] um Carlos on Thursday when I had got
[41:03] here Brother Carlos had already had uh
[41:07] led him to the Lord so that's what's
[41:10] that's what's important that's what's
[41:12] really
[41:13] important uh that's that's a part that
[41:15] then we can we can have a real a real
[41:18] expectation praise God Amen and so we're
[41:21] thankful for that uh but we want to pray
[41:24] for them and even as they'll go to make
[41:26] that
[41:28] uh decision and those things amen let's
[41:31] just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly
[41:35] Father Lord Jesus how we stand here this
[41:39] morning by your Sovereign
[41:41] Grace Lord as the song is the been sung

[49:31] have Lord every step Lord in your hands
[49:34] and you're there to watch over him Lord
[49:36] God Hallelujah Lord Jesus like Moses
[49:40] mother when she Lord put him out there
[49:43] on those infested Lord Rivers Lord a
[49:47] river lord of the Nile and it was
[49:48] infested with crocodiles but Lord she
[49:51] had done one thing Lord she had prepared
[49:54] Lord that place of safety Lord
[49:57] pitched it with tar Lord and your
[49:59] Prophet told us Lord when a crocodile
[50:01] would go up Lord as though it was going
[50:04] to moveed to that basket Lord it would
[50:06] take Lord God that pitch Lord and it
[50:09] would be repelled Lord and how the
[50:12] angels of God your Prophet also said was
[50:14] right there guiding that basket Lord you
[50:16] know these things the course of life
[50:19] that is they're going through now Lord
[50:21] we're asking for the accompaniment of
[50:23] the angels of God that Lord you would
[50:25] guide them through safely Lord Lord and
[50:27] that they would Lord gather the things
[50:29] that's needed for the next and further
[50:32] step in their life should you T we ask
[50:35] it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[50:39] God bless you amen God bless
[50:42] you I'll let you have your seats here
[50:45] just for a moment
[51:08] so I think we're live now you kick it
[51:11] over for me
[51:15] please okay uh I want to just just for
[51:19] sake of time I want to uh just quickly
[51:23] we talked about this the last time with
[51:25] what the way and sidewalk project and
[51:28] obviously we see uh the completion of
[51:31] that and we're thankful to the Lord uh
[51:33] for providing on that and then we uh
[51:36] made this uh approach I'm looking at uh
[51:40] for the parking lot and driveway project
[51:43] because seeing that there's a there's
[51:45] been a need out there and we're at a
[51:46] point where as far as we could start
[51:49] looking at that because uh you many of
[51:52] you remember in the past you You' have
[51:53] to walk through water and that that that
[51:56] in itself would have just been a it have
[51:58] been chaos to try to put something down
[52:00] because that water it would have just
[52:02] broke up in no time so with that I think
[52:05] it was two years ago with that uh
[52:07] drainage put down the side over there so
[52:09] that water would channel that way as
[52:11] well as when the sidewalk and all that
[52:14] was put in everything was lifted so that
[52:16] when we would come to this place the
[52:19] water we could get that water to drain
[52:21] on over there to that side so this is
[52:23] why that it's kind of taken everything
[52:26] in steps um so I want to just quickly
[52:30] just um uh bring it up to where we're at
[52:33] here uh the the the whole project itself
[52:37] um the whole entire uh cost within it uh
[52:41] you can see here I guess we can see if
[52:44] I'm in your way just say
[52:47] move in a Godly
[52:49] way but the total cost for the project
[52:52] was is um
[52:55] 66,6 $49 now that's that's that's just
[52:59] doing what what uh that company uh needs
[53:03] to do obviously anytime you it was just
[53:06] like when we got into this there's
[53:07] always some extra cost and things that
[53:10] come our way of things that we have to
[53:11] do here and there U but I want to say
[53:14] this right here we um we just certainly
[53:18] want to uh bring an update here and just
[53:21] uh give thanks to the Lord this is right
[53:23] here this is presently the offerings
[53:25] that's been received
[53:27] towards that and um the thing that I had
[53:31] proposed with the trustees is um is to
[53:36] draw from the
[53:38] savings uh that that we have and
[53:40] obviously not to deplete it right we
[53:42] don't want that at all but then
[53:45] um if we add those two together
[53:48] offerings received and then withdrawing
[53:50] from the savings this brings our total
[53:52] towards the project up to
[53:55] 63,600
[53:57] $97. 90 I tell you that's enough to say
[54:00] Thank You
[54:02] Lord that's
[54:05] enough we could just have Paul come back
[54:07] up here and sing another song and once
[54:09] again say I'll just throw up my
[54:13] hands and so I want to just say in this
[54:17] regards this remembering the total

[54:49] I'm going to ask you to pray uh pray
[54:51] about it and you just let the Lord just

[54:59] we're standing here right now it's a
[55:01] real miracle and so we just I just want
[55:04] to say like this is kind of like a
[55:06] Finish Line you know when you're running
[55:07] a race you don't just you don't let up
[55:09] when you get to the Finish Line you just
[55:10] want to run all the way through it uh so
[55:13] if everyone would get their checkbooks
[55:15] out just I'm just teasing you but but in
[55:18] in all seriousness I want to um just say
[55:21] it in this way I'd like to just have us
[55:23] focus in on to lift the special offering
[55:26] you can all you can give at any time uh
[55:29] by writing on those envelopes special
[55:32] offering towards the parking lot but uh

[55:37] opportunity to really pray and obviously
[55:39] we can we can continue we'll continue
[55:41] collecting but let's just try to hone in

[56:27] the drainage in the parking
[56:29] lot that's been years talking about that
[56:32] just the drainage because knowing that's
[56:34] a need to get the the pavement and those
[56:37] things because you've seen what it is
[56:39] when we have someone come and plow the
[56:41] snow and we've had you know the gravel

[56:46] requests we make it it happens and some
[56:49] of them say no I don't want to put shoes
[56:50] on the plow and this and that so uh and

[59:24] deer walked in front of him it's not
[59:26] season anyhow so but uh I just I really
[59:30] appreciate that don't you I really
[59:32] appreciate that it looks really really
[59:33] nice amen verse 19 of Ruth chapter
[59:37] 2 and it says and her mother-in-law said
[59:41] un her now this is Naomi speaking where
[59:44] hast thou gleaned today and where
[59:47] roughest thou Blessed Be he that did
[59:51] take knowledge of thee and she showed
[59:54] her mother-in-law with whom she had
[59:56] rought and said the man's name with whom
[59:59] I wrought today is Boaz and Naomi said
[1:00:03] unto unto her daughter-in-law Blessed Be
[1:00:06] he of the Lord who hath not left off his
[1:00:09] kindness to the living and to the dead
[1:00:12] and Naomi said unto her the man is near
[1:00:16] of kin unto us one of our next
[1:00:21] Kinsman and Ruth the moabitas said he
[1:00:26] said unto me also Glory Thou shalt keep
[1:00:29] fast by my young men until they have
[1:00:32] ended all my Harvest and Naomi said unto
[1:00:36] Ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my
[1:00:39] daughter that thou go out that thou go
[1:00:42] out with his maidens that they meet thee
[1:00:45] not in any other field so she kept fast
[1:00:49] by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the
[1:00:52] end of barley Harvest and of wheat
[1:00:54] Harvest and dwell D with her
[1:00:58] mother-in-law amen we'd like to just
[1:01:00] speak here for a few moments on
[1:01:02] accepting the counsel of the Lord amen
[1:01:06] may God bless you bless the reading of
[1:01:08] the word as you're being seated
[1:01:11] accepting the counsel of the
[1:01:15] Lord I think it's evident as we read
[1:01:19] through the scriptures you can see that
[1:01:21] Ruth the character that Boaz
[1:01:26] uh was able to recognize and regard her
[1:01:30] testimony already prior to Boaz meeting
[1:01:33] her aware that she had made her
[1:01:36] decision that where you go I'm going to
[1:01:40] go where you Lodge I'm going to Lodge
[1:01:43] thy God shall be my
[1:01:45] God and to know that she was already in
[1:01:49] a place of how that the approach was
[1:01:52] made to go out and to glean in the field
[1:01:55] and uh they were to glean you know uh
[1:01:58] they were coming in line as though those
[1:02:00] who were poor or those who did not have
[1:02:03] their of a crop or anything of their own
[1:02:06] but we can see how Ruth was able to be
[1:02:09] advised and receive the counsel of Naomi
[1:02:13] brother Brown will take it in in two
[1:02:15] different ways and to understand it he
[1:02:17] says of Naomi he says as Ruth was
[1:02:20] gleaning in the field she was gleaning
[1:02:23] the the old the promises that laid in
[1:02:27] the Old Testament he spoke of because we
[1:02:30] recognize that we're not beyond the old
[1:02:32] it's a fulfillment of the new is a
[1:02:35] fulfillment of the old and the New
[1:02:37] Testament it's Christ fulfilling his
[1:02:40] word through our lives now because
[1:02:42] Christ was the Fulfillment of the old is
[1:02:45] that right this the what we call the
[1:02:47] Bible is two books old and new male
[1:02:51] female it may it's one Union is that
[1:02:54] right so then when we're looking at this
[1:02:57] Naomi also the prophet types Naomi to be
[1:03:02] that of as the Holy Spirit dealing with
[1:03:05] the Church of the Living God and giving
[1:03:09] counsel and advice and wooing the Heart
[1:03:12] of Ruth of the church into the place and
[1:03:16] provided way where she needs to go so we
[1:03:19] understand that you know within this
[1:03:21] that this is Naomi's councel that uh as
[1:03:24] the Holy Spirit would lead to a place of
[1:03:26] full surrender and that's what God
[1:03:28] desires and that's the only thing that
[1:03:30] can ever that's the only way we can ever
[1:03:32] serve God is through a full surrender
[1:03:34] and that's the only way we can continue
[1:03:36] to walk with God is as we continue to
[1:03:39] surrender and that's it's a yielding
[1:03:41] that word y we never get away from
[1:03:43] yielding and that's where the Holy
[1:03:45] Spirit comes to draw us into a place of
[1:03:47] yielding his his presence It Never Comes
[1:03:51] This is what one of the other ways you
[1:03:52] can always sense when God's presence
[1:03:54] comes near is presence never brings
[1:03:57] pressure but his presence comes to lead
[1:04:01] us are you hearing me it doesn't his
[1:04:03] presence doesn't bring condemnation his
[1:04:06] presence it will bring conviction when
[1:04:08] we're wrong but it will all but it's but
[1:04:10] it will always reveal that he's the way
[1:04:13] out are you with me so we don't anything
[1:04:16] we do uh we don't do it halfway because
[1:04:19] there's really a you know you you don't
[1:04:21] you never seen you know a drunk sober
[1:04:23] man you you can't do anything halfway
[1:04:26] you we where desire is as we're gathered
[1:04:28] here this morning we want to be
[1:04:30] full-fledged Christians and we want to
[1:04:32] be filled with the spirit of God so we
[1:04:36] notice that within this the value of
[1:04:38] heeding to that Council anytime you look
[1:04:41] through the scriptures uh you find any
[1:04:44] time from the very beginning even when
[1:04:47] the fall took place in heaven you had
[1:04:50] you had those angels that fell from
[1:04:53] their first estate they f failed to keep
[1:04:56] the counsel of the Lord and so there was
[1:05:00] another word that came and they were led
[1:05:04] by that other word and it led them away
[1:05:06] from their first estate then we find it
[1:05:09] takes place in the garden God gave his
[1:05:11] word his word is his counsel his word is
[1:05:15] his advice but then we find that how
[1:05:18] that Satan always will come in and is to
[1:05:21] divert that around and and present it in
[1:05:24] a way like he did in Eden well surely
[1:05:26] God you know God's just a great big God
[1:05:28] of love and God wouldn't do that he he
[1:05:32] he he wants to lead the people of God
[1:05:35] away from the counsil of the Lord so we
[1:05:37] can see what what really is the result
[1:05:41] when his counsel his advice is not
[1:05:45] received then judgment follows that and
[1:05:49] even prior to that of judgment I uh I
[1:05:52] mean they hadn't known fear of what it
[1:05:55] was in the the garden they didn't know
[1:05:56] fear they didn't know of these things
[1:05:58] they didn't have they didn't know
[1:05:59] anxiety they didn't know none of these
[1:06:01] things but when that departure from the
[1:06:04] counsel of the Lord it opened the
[1:06:06] floodgates you see one step away from
[1:06:11] the word is one step away from God yes
[1:06:14] because he is the word and so just one
[1:06:17] little one little opening you know just
[1:06:20] one little crack like when you know you
[1:06:22] talk to people who do the Exterminating
[1:06:24] for uh whether it's mice or bats or
[1:06:26] whatever more they'll tell you they they
[1:06:28] don't need a big hole all they need is
[1:06:30] something about the size of a dime and
[1:06:33] they can get
[1:06:35] in yeah that's right uh some of you
[1:06:38] right now don't don't go to your house
[1:06:39] in your mind right now just stay here
[1:06:40] with me and you didn't realize that even
[1:06:43] with how they can walk right up siding
[1:06:45] walk right up I mean brick would be
[1:06:46] understandable up siding they how they
[1:06:48] and all those things you think oh my you
[1:06:50] know but but you see it becomes an
[1:06:52] opening one departure just one little
[1:06:55] word one departure it was one word that
[1:06:58] brought all of
[1:07:00] this so it's where it comes to that
[1:07:03] place that we recognize that you know
[1:07:07] when we're looking at the counsel of the
[1:07:09] Lord that anyone that has ever amounted
[1:07:12] to anything are those who have taken God
[1:07:16] at his word we don't try to figure it
[1:07:18] out but we just want to believe what he
[1:07:20] says unto us and anytime you know as we
[1:07:25] said any anytime you get away from the
[1:07:26] word then you believe anything because
[1:07:29] remember the word of the Lord is your
[1:07:34] discernment amen it's what brings
[1:07:36] discernment to your
[1:07:39] life so God makes God makes his counsel
[1:07:43] known he God doesn't uh keep things
[1:07:46] obscure he makes his counsel known by
[1:07:48] revealing and vindicating it because in
[1:07:51] everything the Reason God does it in
[1:07:54] that way he'll reveal it and vindicate
[1:07:56] it can we say that together reveal it
[1:07:59] and vindicate it the reason he does that
[1:08:02] is because you or I would not know how
[1:08:07] to approach him we would not know how to
[1:08:10] even act or go upon anything but when
[1:08:13] God reveals Faith begins to be built in
[1:08:18] our heart and then when he vindicates
[1:08:20] that way then that becomes an absolute
[1:08:24] it becomes a certainty like the man who
[1:08:27] found that pearl of great price he sold
[1:08:30] everything else and held on to that and
[1:08:32] so that's how when God makes himself
[1:08:35] known and he does that then that's the
[1:08:37] counsel of the Lord that we might have
[1:08:40] an assurance in our approach which is
[1:08:45] Faith are you hearing me I know I'm
[1:08:47] going I'm just laying this in here this
[1:08:49] morning it's faith and that's what here
[1:08:53] God is God confirms his word by his
[1:08:55] Spirit that's what causes Faith to arise
[1:08:57] in our hearts the Bible said in Hebrews
[1:09:00] 11:6 without faith it is impossible to
[1:09:04] please him we want to please him don't
[1:09:06] we amen for he that cometh to God must
[1:09:09] believe that he is not was but is and
[1:09:13] that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:09:16] diligently seek him if he did it before
[1:09:19] and the same conditions are met then
[1:09:22] he's God he'll do it again amen
[1:09:25] amen so this is where that you know as
[1:09:29] the prophet would refer to this and I've
[1:09:30] got some quotes that I'm not going to
[1:09:32] put up there but I'm just going to read
[1:09:33] and refer to and he says you know it
[1:09:36] would matter it would matter not how
[1:09:38] graceful you could pray how much
[1:09:40] repentance you could do it's your faith
[1:09:42] to believe that he's done it for you
[1:09:45] that's what brings you forth every
[1:09:47] sinner is saved tonight in the sight of
[1:09:50] Jehovah God but it'll never do you any
[1:09:53] good until you accept accept it and
[1:09:56] believe it and confess it and then he's
[1:10:00] the high priest of your confession to
[1:10:02] make it right before God now I want you
[1:10:06] to think about that you know that advice
[1:10:08] and counsel Even in our opening part of
[1:10:11] our text Ruth she discloses this is the
[1:10:15] man's name it's Boaz and so when she
[1:10:18] discloses that name Ruth has no idea who
[1:10:21] this is she has no idea of the
[1:10:23] significance because remember it was in
[1:10:26] the Old Testament where it's all the way
[1:10:28] laid down on what was needed when when
[1:10:32] when persons would be sold into slavery
[1:10:34] or land would go into a holding place
[1:10:38] while a debt was being paid or or how
[1:10:40] could this with where there's no sons in
[1:10:43] a family how could these daughters come
[1:10:45] in to a place of inheritance and all of
[1:10:48] this was laid out these laws of the
[1:10:50] Kinsman that it must be one who is of
[1:10:54] near King
[1:10:56] and you see God is a spirit Spirit
[1:10:58] cannot die cannot bleed but this is why
[1:11:01] that God created a blood cell God
[1:11:05] created himself a body to come down and
[1:11:10] dwell with you and I take our our debt
[1:11:13] upon him to pay that price that he
[1:11:16] himself might mold in our lives his own
[1:11:20] character and his own image God became
[1:11:24] kin folks with us through Jesus Christ
[1:11:28] only one mediator between God and man
[1:11:30] and that's the man Christ
[1:11:33] Jesus is that right so God so all of
[1:11:37] this laid there all of it was laid out
[1:11:41] in the Old Testament all of these things
[1:11:43] you I I want you to see it I'm not going
[1:11:45] to dwell on it and labor on it today but
[1:11:47] I want you to see that God himself has
[1:11:50] included what his thoughts have been all
[1:11:54] along concerning you and I his thoughts
[1:11:57] have been
[1:12:00] Redemption and Redemption is where one
[1:12:04] that belongs to one is brought back to
[1:12:07] that one there has to be a price that is
[1:12:10] paid in order to release that one who
[1:12:14] belongs to this
[1:12:16] person yes sir and God did that God came
[1:12:20] down thank Jes and he did that for you
[1:12:22] and I now this character that Ruth has
[1:12:26] it's been displayed Naomi is instructing
[1:12:29] her when she says uh I've been
[1:12:32] instructed by him but this is what he
[1:12:33] said to me he said these wonderful words
[1:12:35] he said don't go in another field stay
[1:12:38] right here by my maidens Naomi catches
[1:12:40] that and realizes listen your character
[1:12:43] has already been noticed but now within
[1:12:46] this it's important that you be not
[1:12:49] found in another field it's important
[1:12:52] that you be found with his maidens in
[1:12:55] field now I want you to think of this
[1:12:57] Ruth at that point if she had not
[1:12:59] already have had a willing heart she
[1:13:02] could have just stepped back at that
[1:13:04] moment and said hey he's already taken
[1:13:07] an interest in me it's not you that
[1:13:11] picked up handfuls of purpose it's not
[1:13:13] you that's received favor but it's me
[1:13:17] that's received
[1:13:18] favor Ruth could have said that but her
[1:13:22] heart listen there was a humility that
[1:13:25] was already present in her
[1:13:28] life and a humility that was able to
[1:13:31] hear this advice and this Council let me
[1:13:34] say this friends we never want to get to
[1:13:36] a place to where we begin to feel
[1:13:39] somewhat comfortable in our walk that we
[1:13:41] no longer need to seek after and heed to
[1:13:45] the counsel of the Lord as God would
[1:13:47] speak through us through his veils
[1:13:49] through his word through the message we
[1:13:51] need him until the very change of our
[1:13:55] bodies and then we'll stand there be
[1:13:58] gathered together with others and
[1:13:59] will'll rise to meet him in the air but
[1:14:01] until that time we are going to need the
[1:14:04] counsel of the Lord every step of our
[1:14:08] life this is why we do not trust our own
[1:14:12] selves even when you remember the Bible
[1:14:14] said let him that standeth that thanketh
[1:14:17] he standeth take heed lest he fall knows
[1:14:20] thanth Hallelujah I don't even trust my
[1:14:23] thoughts
[1:14:26] I don't want I don't want my thoughts to
[1:14:28] present some form of a comfortableness I
[1:14:31] want my the whole desire is is I'm
[1:14:33] seeking to please him I'm seeking to
[1:14:36] please him if there's things that want
[1:14:38] to try to take me out of this field of
[1:14:40] the revealed word I don't want it it's
[1:14:42] not worth it it's necessary that he find
[1:14:44] me in the field of his
[1:14:49] word and she took that advice now all of
[1:14:52] this is all of this display and she
[1:14:55] dwelt with her mother-in-law she dwelt
[1:14:58] now Ruth
[1:15:01] 3:1 then naom me her mother-in-law said
[1:15:04] unto
[1:15:05] her my daughter shall I I want you to
[1:15:10] catch this shall I not seek rest for
[1:15:14] thee that it may be well with thee
[1:15:17] remember I read to you I think it's Ruth
[1:15:19] one chapter chapter 1 verse 9 where when
[1:15:22] there orpa and Ruth are leaving to go
[1:15:25] and follow Naomi and Naomi says why will
[1:15:28] you follow me I have't I can't give you
[1:15:31] I can't give you another husband if I
[1:15:33] have a child and I'm to get married
[1:15:35] you'll be too
[1:15:36] old right so that was enough for Orphan
[1:15:39] she said no hope for me in this you see
[1:15:43] what they was saying it was all about
[1:15:46] Oran that's what it was about it had
[1:15:49] nothing to do but Ruth Hallelujah Ruth
[1:15:52] was not about Ruth Ruth was about her
[1:15:56] mother-in-law that's why another place
[1:15:58] in the scripture I think I remember one
[1:16:00] of the Minor Prophets it is I don't have
[1:16:02] it before me but it says all of them
[1:16:04] that love thee speaking of Israel
[1:16:07] speaking of those of of of that of that
[1:16:10] portion all of them who love thee I tell
[1:16:13] you what as the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:16:15] love the word of God we love listen you
[1:16:18] cannot you can't despise Israel and love
[1:16:21] God right right we're here because they
[1:16:24] were blind for our
[1:16:26] sake and what was written in the Old
[1:16:29] Testament was prophecy concerning
[1:16:32] us are you hearing me I'm not talking
[1:16:35] about getting caught up in news I'm
[1:16:36] talking about we rejoice in the Old
[1:16:39] Testament being fulfilled we rejoice and
[1:16:42] see that what Jehovah was of the old is
[1:16:45] Jesus of the new we can see our place
[1:16:48] that we were hidden there in the groom
[1:16:50] in the Old Testament we were hidden in
[1:16:53] him but when he went into Calvary those
[1:16:56] promises of the hidden Mystery of I will
[1:16:59] lay my arm bear before many nations all
[1:17:01] of those promises were hidden in the
[1:17:04] groom where was Eve at she was hidden in
[1:17:08] Adam it was a mystery in Adam's life the
[1:17:11] bride was hidden there in the Old
[1:17:14] Testament and now it's Christ in you
[1:17:17] that reveals you are always a part of
[1:17:20] the
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:23] word notice when she tells
[1:17:26] them go on
[1:17:29] back I read it to you last week and may
[1:17:32] you find rest security security safety
[1:17:37] in the house of your husband in other
[1:17:38] words your your first husband's dead the
[1:17:42] law is you can be
[1:17:44] remarried you can go back to your land
[1:17:47] you can go back to all of that that you
[1:17:51] once
[1:17:52] knew you're free remember the Lord Lord
[1:17:55] Jesus John
[1:17:57] 666 666
[1:18:00] right he gave him the opportunity right
[1:18:03] you want to go back right go back and
[1:18:06] the Bible said after many Saw The
[1:18:09] Miracles
[1:18:11] many walked
[1:18:13] backwards and didn't go
[1:18:17] on that's why it's
[1:18:19] important the counsel of the Lord but
[1:18:21] notice this is I want you to notice this
[1:18:23] difference here now says to Ruth she's
[1:18:27] taking the
[1:18:29] responsibility to find rest for
[1:18:33] herall my daughter shall
[1:18:35] I not seek rest for thee that it may be
[1:18:39] well with thee now notice Naomi is not
[1:18:41] going to do it for her but she's going
[1:18:43] to give her the counsel the word that
[1:18:47] has been laying there that will open up
[1:18:50] or tie them back into their inheritance
[1:18:54] or the blessings of The Inheritance that
[1:18:58] belongeth to IMC which she is a part of
[1:19:01] that household yes amen you see you and
[1:19:04] I could not tie ourselves back in it
[1:19:06] took one coming for you and I and then
[1:19:09] through the marriage Union we are
[1:19:12] brought back into the Covenant amen
[1:19:15] outside of a union with Jesus Christ we
[1:19:19] have no
[1:19:20] inheritance amen that's why the baptism
[1:19:24] of the Holy Ghost the token the Seal of
[1:19:26] the Living God is a sign that as we have
[1:19:29] United with him and I also have a home
[1:19:33] Over
[1:19:35] Yonder is that right that's a candidate
[1:19:38] for
[1:19:39] Rapture now notice Boaz in verse
[1:19:43] two is not now Boaz of our Kindred with
[1:19:47] whose maidens thou was see no doubt this
[1:19:50] is this conversation's been had this is
[1:19:53] who he is he's no doubt he's he's our
[1:19:55] Kindred remember the maidens you've been
[1:19:57] with behold he went with barley tonight
[1:19:59] in the threshing floor he's they're
[1:20:02] separating the seed from the shuck he's
[1:20:05] separating who's separating who's doing
[1:20:08] it who is it that separated the bride
[1:20:11] from organization it's Christ himself
[1:20:14] the word come down amen separating
[1:20:18] where's he at he's in the threshing
[1:20:20] floor why because the Harvest has come
[1:20:23] and the seed has been gathered in am do
[1:20:27] you understand friends it is Christ
[1:20:29] himself that's winnowing wi I I don't
[1:20:32] know how to pronounce that word winth in
[1:20:33] our life it's when Christ even coming
[1:20:36] into our life let alone in the beginning
[1:20:39] it's separating us from unbelief and
[1:20:41] when the word comes into our life that
[1:20:43] word separates you from you it
[1:20:46] identifies you with Jesus Christ it
[1:20:48] separates you from your own desires from
[1:20:51] your own will why he winth barley in the
[1:20:54] threshing floor Hallelujah your life is
[1:20:57] a threshing floor is that right here we
[1:21:01] walk here we walk in this sticky and
[1:21:03] this carnal and this first birth but
[1:21:06] inside when the New Birth has come it is
[1:21:08] Christ himself the hidden man of the
[1:21:10] heart and he is wi he is win with he's
[1:21:13] moving apart what shock and Seed he's
[1:21:16] identifying what is really you and what
[1:21:18] is really not he's separating your
[1:21:21] natural birth from the first birth amen
[1:21:24] why that you might have faith in your
[1:21:26] approach to
[1:21:29] Rapture verse
[1:21:34] three wash
[1:21:39] thyself you got to wash all your ideas
[1:21:43] that's right wash away all your thinking
[1:21:45] that's good as a matter of fact I want
[1:21:48] you to let the word wash
[1:21:51] away everything you've ever thought
[1:21:53] about yourself
[1:21:56] Lord in the Book of Psalms in the book
[1:21:58] of Song of Solomon how God would Express
[1:22:01] and speak that thou mayest forget the
[1:22:04] home of thy Nativity right who brings a
[1:22:08] strength for us to be able to forget
[1:22:11] first of all there has to be a
[1:22:12] forgiveness when there's forgiveness
[1:22:14] then forgetting comes in that's so good
[1:22:18] are you with
[1:22:21] me ah wash thyself an anoint thee Oh My
[1:22:28] she's got access and put thy reignment
[1:22:30] upon the she's got the right
[1:22:33] dress it's an address now watch Naomi I
[1:22:36] can't dive into this too much tonight or
[1:22:38] today but Naomi is not planting Ruth to
[1:22:43] be seductive no that's right that's not
[1:22:46] what this is about at
[1:22:48] all because you can't deceive the
[1:22:52] word oh Lord I I really want to serve
[1:22:55] you but remember he's looking not at our
[1:22:57] tears or anything that's coming out here
[1:23:00] he's listening to the call from our
[1:23:02] heart
[1:23:03] amen we can't deceive
[1:23:06] him is that right he's listening to
[1:23:09] where is our heart oh I say we want to
[1:23:11] say Lord let my heart say Amen Lord let
[1:23:15] my soul say so be it
[1:23:18] Lord is that right that's why the
[1:23:20] prophet could stand in the meeting he
[1:23:22] said I hear you saying amen with your
[1:23:24] mouth but I hear you in your heart
[1:23:26] saying this is
[1:23:28] telepathy same things coming out of one
[1:23:32] channel oh this is why I want to say
[1:23:35] Lord let everything be lined up my
[1:23:37] thoughts let all every part of me let it
[1:23:40] be lined with the word of God
[1:23:43] Amen oh my put the rment upon thee get
[1:23:46] thee down to the floor but don't make
[1:23:49] yourself known unto the man
[1:23:51] until he hath done eating and drinking
[1:23:55] you've got a time you've got to wait
[1:23:58] wait till he's done hallelujah now watch
[1:24:01] this in verse four what's the spirit of
[1:24:04] Prophecy and it shall be when he lith
[1:24:08] down that thou shalt Mark the place
[1:24:11] where he shall lie and thou shalt go in
[1:24:14] and uncover his feet and lay thee down
[1:24:17] watch this prophecy and he will tell
[1:24:20] thee what Thou shalt do in other words I
[1:24:23] can take you so far giving you the word
[1:24:26] and if you will come according to the
[1:24:28] word that's where he will step in and
[1:24:32] take you from there
[1:24:34] hallu oh now that's
[1:24:37] prophecy and she said unto her all that
[1:24:41] thou sayest unto me I will
[1:24:45] do so Naomi's taken this responsibility
[1:24:48] and I I think of how fitting when the
[1:24:50] prophet would preach invisible Union of
[1:24:52] the bride of Christ
[1:24:54] that he would open that
[1:24:56] message and the prophet would speak of
[1:24:58] how that he says this chapter of Romans
[1:25:01] 7 it pertains to marriage and divorce he
[1:25:03] said but I believe he says it tains
[1:25:06] attains to even a higher portion than
[1:25:10] that of just a natural marriage and
[1:25:11] divorce he says it pertains to that
[1:25:13] which is spiritual and so brother R
[1:25:16] would take among now think about this he
[1:25:18] standing in Jack Moore's Pulpit there in
[1:25:21] in treport Louisiana Pentecostal
[1:25:24] assembly it's where remember the gifts
[1:25:27] had come back on isua Street brother
[1:25:28] Bram has preached there at the at the uh
[1:25:32] 50 years after isua and brother BR
[1:25:35] preaches two important messages and he
[1:25:37] talks about uh uh return and Jubilee the
[1:25:41] first night and then he preaches the way
[1:25:43] back the second night and a man who was
[1:25:46] actually there at isua Street an older
[1:25:48] man comes up after the first night of
[1:25:50] returning Jubilee at the end of it steps
[1:25:53] up to the microphone he's trembling and
[1:25:55] it begins to say he said we got to get
[1:25:57] back we got to get back we got to get
[1:25:59] back to where we're at and he's just
[1:26:01] talking to brother Bram but you didn't
[1:26:03] realize that you and I and even that
[1:26:05] were Pentecost because the full word had
[1:26:08] not come they had received a restoration
[1:26:11] of the gifts but they could see the word
[1:26:13] was letting them see and show them you
[1:26:16] departed from the counsel of the
[1:26:20] Lord man look where they're at now but
[1:26:23] it was already pointing then is that
[1:26:26] right and yet now God is calling calling
[1:26:30] out of that church calling out of the of
[1:26:33] that lady oan age he's calling us into
[1:26:36] that place of surrender to his coming
[1:26:40] and he would say to them in this way he
[1:26:42] says this message I love this he says
[1:26:45] this message that we are about to speak
[1:26:48] he said it's to the church to the body
[1:26:51] of Christ that we're trying to lead to
[1:26:53] deeper thoughts and higher objectives
[1:26:56] believing that the coming of the Lord is
[1:26:58] at hand if there's ever a group of
[1:27:00] people if there's ever an hour that we
[1:27:02] need higher objectives deeper thoughts
[1:27:06] it's right now and how could you and I
[1:27:09] get there if not for the mercy of God to
[1:27:13] lead you and I to that place where it
[1:27:16] causes us to reflect and consider the
[1:27:20] moment and the hour according to the
[1:27:22] promise of where we're standing amen
[1:27:24] think about this the Bible said in
[1:27:26] Jeremiah
[1:27:28] 10:23 oh Lord I know that the way of man
[1:27:32] is not in himself in other words what
[1:27:34] God intends for man to be
[1:27:37] right sure parents they rais us and
[1:27:40] there's a there should be an admonition
[1:27:43] there should be a direction and because
[1:27:45] the Bible says in the nurture and the
[1:27:47] admonition means the full full counsel
[1:27:49] but yet that in itself how could we know
[1:27:51] what to do except God would instruct us
[1:27:55] the way is not in himself so in other
[1:27:57] words God did not bring us here and say
[1:28:00] you're on autopilot figure this out we
[1:28:03] can't we need him to guide us it is not
[1:28:07] in man that walketh to direct his steps
[1:28:10] oh my and this is why the prophet in
[1:28:12] that message would say oh he says when
[1:28:15] when this bride when she would begin to
[1:28:17] come back and line herself up with the
[1:28:19] word of God you watch he said at that
[1:28:21] time there'll be a message sweep out to
[1:28:24] catch that bride that woman that
[1:28:28] elect now I want you to think of
[1:28:30] something here in Ruth chapter 2 at
[1:28:32] verse 12 I I'm not going to dwell on
[1:28:34] this for for a lot but I want you to
[1:28:36] catch with this word in here because
[1:28:38] where Ruth is at in this in this moment
[1:28:41] in this time the Bible said the Lord
[1:28:43] recompense thy Work and a full this is
[1:28:45] Boaz talking to her when he first meets
[1:28:47] her and a full reward be given thee of
[1:28:50] the Lord God of Israel so anything
[1:28:53] that's going to come it's got to come
[1:28:54] from him amen are you with me you see
[1:28:58] Boaz is a word man
[1:29:00] amen come on somebody Boaz is a Kinsman
[1:29:04] he's a word
[1:29:07] man under whose
[1:29:09] wings Thou Art come to trust you know
[1:29:13] what it was that swept over Ruth that
[1:29:15] caused her to make a decision that she
[1:29:18] made it's true there had to be something
[1:29:20] within her a predestinated seed and as
[1:29:23] the Winds of the Holy Spirit the season
[1:29:27] the time it swept over it pulled
[1:29:29] something in her to make a decision when
[1:29:32] she didn't even know how are the events
[1:29:35] going to unfold but the wings of Jehovah
[1:29:38] Eagle swept over her life and she
[1:29:41] trusted in the wings of the
[1:29:47] Lord wish we had some time there just
[1:29:50] for today but we'll get there but notice
[1:29:52] These Wings notice what God Said in
[1:29:55] Exodus 19:4 this is out of the message
[1:29:58] God who is rich in Mercy in Exodus
[1:30:01] 19:4 God told Israel I carried you
[1:30:05] notice I carried you away on Eagle wings
[1:30:09] and brought you to myself carried them
[1:30:11] On Eagle's Wings and brought you to
[1:30:13] myself there was other men in the middle
[1:30:16] of that sea out there trying to
[1:30:18] impersonate remember Pharaoh's Army
[1:30:20] followed him into the sea trying to
[1:30:22] impersonate but he carried them on
[1:30:25] Eagles
[1:30:27] Wings God always Likens His prophets to
[1:30:31] Eagles and what was it Moses was his
[1:30:34] messenger and they were following Moses
[1:30:37] and that was the Eagle wings that they
[1:30:40] were carried on because he was packing
[1:30:44] God's message they were following Moses
[1:30:47] let me read it again and that was the
[1:30:49] Eagle wings they were carried on because
[1:30:53] he Moses was packing God's
[1:30:56] message so you know what it was the
[1:30:59] message is what gave him
[1:31:02] lift Hallelujah not just something to
[1:31:04] come over you it's got to be coming
[1:31:06] underneath that Wing as well is that
[1:31:08] right it was a lift that's what this
[1:31:10] message come to do lift you it come to
[1:31:13] lift you from your thinking it come to
[1:31:15] lift you from who you are it came to
[1:31:17] lift you it came to give a lift when you
[1:31:19] couldn't lift yourself you couldn't even
[1:31:21] lift up your head but he came by the we
[1:31:24] K of Jehovah brought lift
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:30] Hallelujah brother Bram said they perish
[1:31:32] not with them those who who went on they
[1:31:35] perish not with them who believe not
[1:31:37] those who followed that word God was
[1:31:39] rich in Mercy to them because they were
[1:31:41] following his Commandments and God wants
[1:31:44] us to follow his Commandments I say yes
[1:31:46] Lord amen even when it don't make sense
[1:31:49] to me that that don't matter it ain't
[1:31:52] about my sense it's about
[1:31:55] following there's things that you know
[1:31:57] we can Fellowship on this that we God
[1:31:59] has asked us to do it didn't make a lick
[1:32:01] of sense to us in our reasoning but you
[1:32:03] move upon it and you watch God step on
[1:32:05] the scene and it ain't just with us this
[1:32:08] Bible is filled of
[1:32:10] paradoxes tell me how marching around
[1:32:13] walls seven days and on the seventh day
[1:32:16] seven times tell me how marching around
[1:32:19] walls are going to bring the walls down
[1:32:21] it wasn't their marching it was their
[1:32:24] faith and obedience to the word and God
[1:32:27] brought the walls
[1:32:31] down God show you follow my Commandments
[1:32:34] I'll bring walls down I'll take walls
[1:32:37] down in your marriage I'll take walls
[1:32:39] down in your home I'll take wall I'll
[1:32:41] men I'll move Hall you believe
[1:32:46] that pise Lord Brother Bram said Moses
[1:32:49] know that he was to carry those children
[1:32:52] over into the Promised Land because the
[1:32:54] promise was given to him and he must Pat
[1:32:56] them to the promised land and he said
[1:32:58] today the holy spirit is here to
[1:33:01] vindicate God's word that's the eagle
[1:33:03] Wing that we're supposed to ride on not
[1:33:05] some man-made theology we are to ride
[1:33:08] upon the wings of the eagle to the
[1:33:10] promised land now remember that
[1:33:13] scripture I'm re reading from here
[1:33:14] drawing from where Naomi said shall not
[1:33:18] I seek rest for
[1:33:20] thee Hallelujah and John
[1:33:24] 1613 when he the spirit of Truth is come
[1:33:29] he will lead and guide you into all
[1:33:31] truth John 20 John 10 and verse 4 this
[1:33:36] Bible said the Sheep he says he putteth
[1:33:38] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[1:33:41] and the Sheep follow him and they know
[1:33:45] his voice Psalm 1611 thou will show me
[1:33:50] the path of Life are you seeing this
[1:33:52] it's him thou will show me the path of
[1:33:55] life in thy presence is fullness of joy
[1:33:58] at thy right hand there are Pleasures
[1:34:00] forever more how many know that he still
[1:34:03] shows you the path for your
[1:34:05] life decisions that we have before us
[1:34:08] that Lord you've been my choice I only
[1:34:10] want you so wherever you're at that's
[1:34:12] what the choice I want to make if you're
[1:34:14] not in this I don't care how religious I
[1:34:17] don't care how good I don't care how
[1:34:19] right it seems feels I don't want to
[1:34:21] walk by my feelings my sense says I want
[1:34:24] to walk by the word
[1:34:28] amen thou will show me the path of life
[1:34:31] this is a man who knows his
[1:34:35] God he never brought me this far to
[1:34:38] leave me
[1:34:40] amen oh Psalms 328 I love this scripture
[1:34:44] I will instruct Thee I will instruct
[1:34:47] thee and teach thee in the way which
[1:34:51] Thou shalt go I will guide thee with
[1:34:54] mine eye you know what the eye is it's
[1:34:58] the pillar of fire it's the angel of the
[1:35:01] Lord amen it was the same one that led
[1:35:05] Moses and Moses followed it's the same
[1:35:08] one that they followed and it brought
[1:35:10] him to the other side it's the same eye
[1:35:12] that Joshua looked through and saw the
[1:35:15] walls of Jericho come down it's the same
[1:35:17] eye that came among the Church of the
[1:35:19] Living God and they begin to move and
[1:35:22] walk under the direct under unction of
[1:35:25] the very eye of God oh I'm thankful for
[1:35:28] the eye of God aren't you this is the
[1:35:31] admonition be not as the
[1:35:33] horse or as the mule which hath no
[1:35:40] understanding isn't it amazing how God
[1:35:43] will take things in his word remember
[1:35:44] you stay with the type as long as it's
[1:35:46] on the type and then get off of it in
[1:35:49] the song Song of Solomon Chapter 1 it
[1:35:52] said I have compared thee oh my love to
[1:35:55] one of those in Pharaoh's chariots in
[1:35:57] other words feral bread so the only
[1:35:59] thing that God wanted us to get out of
[1:36:01] there is your pedigree you got some
[1:36:03] papers your name has already been
[1:36:06] written on a book we can trace your
[1:36:08] birth back to the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:36:11] back to the mind of God but when it
[1:36:13] comes to the rest of it we don't want
[1:36:15] Horse
[1:36:16] Sense we want to live by that reality of
[1:36:19] our
[1:36:21] pedigree be not as the horse or the mule
[1:36:24] which have no understanding whose mouth
[1:36:26] must be held in with bit and Bridal lest
[1:36:29] they come near unto thee got to be held
[1:36:32] in position held in
[1:36:34] position God's desire is trust me and I
[1:36:38] will guide you all the way do you
[1:36:42] realize this is what it was it took
[1:36:44] relationship and I hope you're with me
[1:36:46] just a moment there was a relationship
[1:36:49] that was already between Ruth and Naomi
[1:36:52] right right there was a trust already
[1:36:56] being built oh yeah let me just pause
[1:36:59] for a
[1:37:00] moment don't let the enemy shame you for
[1:37:03] where you might be in your walk with God
[1:37:06] but I want to be very very clear with
[1:37:08] you this morning make sure in your life
[1:37:11] that Lord let that trust be built to
[1:37:14] where I can step out fully on your
[1:37:18] word are you hearing me this is this is
[1:37:20] how you pray remember brother BR say
[1:37:22] many times I'm going to pray and and you
[1:37:23] pray after me these are ways these are
[1:37:25] how you need to pray is Lord let that
[1:37:28] trust be built because when she is going
[1:37:30] into Boaz she's not going into a
[1:37:33] stranger right she knows this man not
[1:37:37] because they dated but but she has known
[1:37:40] got to known his
[1:37:42] character are you hearing me so the word
[1:37:44] and the character all is lining up but
[1:37:47] notice
[1:37:48] this we want to be harnessed to the to
[1:37:51] the word of God I I want to just I want
[1:37:53] to dropped us in in the message
[1:37:55] leadership brother Bram says it like
[1:37:57] this there's no one no one denomination
[1:38:00] can claim us a real Christian because
[1:38:02] you belong to God denominations are
[1:38:05] man-made and Christianity is Heaven
[1:38:09] Sent simply put you say how can you say
[1:38:13] that denomination because go to begin to
[1:38:16] press them on promises and what's
[1:38:19] written in the word and that will let
[1:38:21] you know very quickly that they do not
[1:38:23] believe the word of God they've got
[1:38:26] Parts they believe and parts they don't
[1:38:28] you know why because they're not
[1:38:30] following the pillar of fire they're
[1:38:33] following manmade traditions and that's
[1:38:37] why it looks like a
[1:38:40] man but real Christians look like
[1:38:45] God they look like Believers there's
[1:38:48] something different about their life you
[1:38:50] know why cuz it's not man-made yes it's
[1:38:54] heaven
[1:38:55] sent your new birth was Heaven
[1:39:00] Sent you say heaven sent yes a channel
[1:39:04] has been
[1:39:05] opened a place to get into shall I not
[1:39:10] seek rest for thee praise God but in all
[1:39:14] these things brother brah says this as
[1:39:16] good as they are as we find as we come
[1:39:19] together nice meetings we have social
[1:39:22] understanding we have
[1:39:23] we're each one confronted with eternal
[1:39:26] life and no matter how successful we've
[1:39:29] been in business how successful we've
[1:39:31] been and what a great church member we
[1:39:33] are how we work how we try to do things
[1:39:36] right if it's not done in the right way
[1:39:39] it is worship of God in
[1:39:42] vain Jesus said the same thing he said
[1:39:46] in vain do you worship me teaching for
[1:39:50] Doctrine the Commandments of man what
[1:39:52] happened just that little deviation from
[1:39:55] the counsel of the Lord and now it's
[1:39:59] vain
[1:40:00] worship one little deviation brings vain
[1:40:04] worship vain worship is lifeless that's
[1:40:08] right because where Life Is Life
[1:40:11] produces
[1:40:13] itself is that right now watch this now
[1:40:16] he says a sincere honest worship with
[1:40:20] the sincerity of your heart to God and
[1:40:23] still be in
[1:40:25] vain it began that way with Cain at the
[1:40:28] Garden of Eden sincere worship but was
[1:40:32] rejected very religious still rejected
[1:40:35] notice even when God pointed out to Cain
[1:40:39] he was
[1:40:41] upset he was upset he was the first
[1:40:45] person to ever got mad in
[1:40:47] church that's
[1:40:49] right he was mad I did all this work
[1:40:54] and
[1:40:55] nothing
[1:40:57] nothing and him he takes something
[1:41:00] that's already provided he didn't bring
[1:41:03] that little lamb forth he brought that
[1:41:05] up here and he put that lamb on there
[1:41:07] and now I I've seen what happened I see
[1:41:10] that Pillar of Fire come now and accept
[1:41:13] that
[1:41:15] sacrifice hallelujah what K should have
[1:41:17] done he said God thank you for
[1:41:21] correcting the eror of my way
[1:41:24] amen he should have just humbled himself
[1:41:26] right there instead he got
[1:41:29] mad because God didn't come to his
[1:41:33] sacrifice God didn't come to his
[1:41:36] way God's not obligated to come to our
[1:41:39] way he's only obligated to his
[1:41:46] word Cain was
[1:41:48] sincere
[1:41:49] right but he rejected even when God vind
[1:41:53] ated it and he said if thou doest well
[1:41:56] you want to be accepted worship like
[1:41:57] your brother if thou doest well Thou
[1:42:01] shalt also be accepted right but if you
[1:42:04] don't sin lies at the door what was he
[1:42:07] talking about the door of his
[1:42:10] heart oh my notice the prophet goes on
[1:42:13] to talk about same same message next
[1:42:16] paragraph down and refers back to the
[1:42:18] message that he's just preached in
[1:42:20] treport on doing God a service with
[1:42:23] without a being at his will this is this
[1:42:24] was just days before the Lord took him
[1:42:27] home he says you know that sounds
[1:42:30] strange but we've got to channel
[1:42:32] ourselves into God's provided Channel
[1:42:35] and God's way of doing it no matter how
[1:42:37] much we think it's right it's got to be
[1:42:40] according to the word of the Lord or
[1:42:42] it's in vain right he said Cain worship
[1:42:46] but it wasn't according to the word of
[1:42:48] the Lord see it wasn't the counsel of
[1:42:50] the Lord King knew or was fruit that
[1:42:54] took us out but it was natural
[1:42:58] fruit it was natural fruit they were
[1:43:02] taught that by their parents but because
[1:43:05] Abel was of the Heavenly parent God was
[1:43:09] not going to let him go in error amen
[1:43:13] are you hearing me God's obligated to
[1:43:15] his word don't just look at this Bible
[1:43:17] if you're a part of the word God has
[1:43:20] always been obligated to you been o
[1:43:23] obligated to me even when we were on and
[1:43:25] astray but God is obligated to his word
[1:43:29] he's the one that sought us out he's the
[1:43:31] one that brought us to himself because
[1:43:33] we were always a part of
[1:43:40] him
[1:43:42] Lord Proverbs 14:12 the Bible said there
[1:43:45] is a way which seeth right unto man but
[1:43:48] the end thereof that's right are the
[1:43:50] ways of death notice there is a way that
[1:43:53] seeth right to a man so one man has a
[1:43:56] way that he thinks
[1:43:58] right but then notice the latter part
[1:44:01] but the end thereof when he gets done
[1:44:04] going his his way singular the end
[1:44:08] thereof are the ways of
[1:44:11] death why because it not in man to
[1:44:15] direct
[1:44:16] himself he needs almighty God in his
[1:44:19] life let me tell you something friends
[1:44:21] God ain't calling you and I to a church
[1:44:24] God's calling you to a personal
[1:44:26] relationship with
[1:44:28] him are you hearing me not to where it's
[1:44:31] just a pastor you pack in your back
[1:44:33] pocket and the pastor is your holy ghost
[1:44:35] that doesn't mean you go out here and
[1:44:36] you just act on your own and do whatever
[1:44:38] that's not a son of God either but a Son
[1:44:40] of God will always recognize the leading
[1:44:43] of the Holy Spirit and the counsel of
[1:44:46] God's word and it'll follow according to
[1:44:48] that and when it doesn't then there's
[1:44:52] consequences there's decisions we can
[1:44:54] make and we'll reap the decisions from
[1:44:57] that is that right let me give you an
[1:45:00] example Joshua and them came in the land
[1:45:02] man they Jericho what a victory but
[1:45:05] because Council was not
[1:45:07] heeded and aen took a wedge of
[1:45:15] gold when that happened they went into
[1:45:18] Ai and they were defeated
[1:45:21] right if you notice AI God told him the
[1:45:25] treasures could pass through the fire
[1:45:27] and come into the camp but at Jericho he
[1:45:29] said I don't want you touching none of
[1:45:31] it burn it all it just shows you you got
[1:45:34] to wait on God's appointed time
[1:45:37] sometimes they're absolutely approved
[1:45:38] but you got to wait on God's appointed
[1:45:40] time and in God's appointed time the
[1:45:41] fire will be there for it to pass
[1:45:44] through that's what I want don't you I
[1:45:47] want the things that are before me Lord
[1:45:49] Lord you help me give me the patience
[1:45:51] until it's the appointed time because at
[1:45:53] the point of time he is there our the
[1:45:56] presence of God the fire of God and it
[1:45:58] can pull it right through because if it
[1:46:00] can't be pulled through I don't want it
[1:46:03] I don't want it there's curse attached
[1:46:05] to it what is Curse
[1:46:07] bondage well my deprived of Victory I
[1:46:10] don't want that I want
[1:46:13] Victory notice many the end thereof are
[1:46:17] the ways of death so there's many ways
[1:46:19] to
[1:46:20] death but there's one way to life
[1:46:24] One Way old song they used to sing one
[1:46:27] one one one way to God is that right too
[1:46:31] bad they forgot that sing it but forgot
[1:46:34] it second Timothy 2:5 if a man also
[1:46:37] strive for masteries yet is he not
[1:46:41] crowned except he strive lawfully that's
[1:46:45] it he's got to come according to the
[1:46:50] word is that right amen
[1:46:53] now now you come to Matthew
[1:46:56] 7 and Jesus tells us what will take
[1:46:59] place
[1:47:00] there that even before the white Throne
[1:47:02] judgment now the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:47:05] is not going to stand in the white
[1:47:07] Throne judgment she'll be standing with
[1:47:10] him as his
[1:47:12] Queen but this is what will be declared
[1:47:15] in that hour not everyone that saith
[1:47:18] unto me Lord Lord means master master
[1:47:22] you're my own owner you're my owner
[1:47:24] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:47:27] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:47:31] which is in heaven many will say to me
[1:47:34] in that day Lord Lord master master have
[1:47:37] not we prophesied in thy name it means
[1:47:40] preached and in thy name have cast out
[1:47:42] devils and in thy name done many
[1:47:45] wonderful Works notice notice what they
[1:47:47] are laying before him we've preached
[1:47:51] your word we've cast out Devils we've
[1:47:54] done many wonderful things in thy
[1:47:59] name but his response will come back I
[1:48:03] never knew
[1:48:07] you meaning the word knew I never had a
[1:48:11] relationship with
[1:48:13] you you lived under the rain that was
[1:48:16] coming off the rain falleth on the just
[1:48:19] and unjust the sun cometh on you lived
[1:48:22] on that and as a matter of fact he can
[1:48:24] look look look because he spoke it
[1:48:26] through the mouth of the seventh angel
[1:48:28] he will even point out to them you held
[1:48:31] to the gift in your life above the
[1:48:35] word you held to talents in your life
[1:48:38] you held to this and oh I feel the
[1:48:40] anointing this must be exactly right you
[1:48:42] check every anointing by the word come
[1:48:45] on friends as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:47] well I feel led to do this I feel led
[1:48:49] then it ought to check out with the word
[1:48:51] you see for the bride ofes Jesus Christ
[1:48:53] it ought to be something it's a desire
[1:48:55] in my life I don't care how good it
[1:48:58] feels because sometimes I feel L can be
[1:49:00] the a caveat for Lord I don't want to
[1:49:02] know what you
[1:49:05] think I don't we don't want to go that
[1:49:08] way we want to be prisoners this is what
[1:49:10] this message come to produce prisoners
[1:49:12] of Jesus Christ the kind of prisoners
[1:49:14] that the prophet was instructed by the
[1:49:16] spirit of God pick up your pen and write
[1:49:18] that the Bride of Jesus Christ will have
[1:49:20] the mind of Christ and they do only his
[1:49:23] will no one can persuade them to do
[1:49:27] otherwise are you with me I'm talking
[1:49:29] about the mind of Christ we're living in
[1:49:32] an hour friends we don't want to just be
[1:49:33] hitting the target we're here to hit the
[1:49:36] bullseye it's not up to you and I to
[1:49:38] configure it it's God has provided for
[1:49:41] us that the bullseye might be help if
[1:49:44] we'll look through the right channel
[1:49:46] hallelujah
[1:49:47] amen
[1:49:50] am I never knew you
[1:49:53] depart from me you work
[1:49:56] iniquity they accepted an honor let me
[1:49:59] see if I can get to a place
[1:50:01] here they accepted an
[1:50:04] honor and an approval above the word of
[1:50:10] God listen this message
[1:50:13] came to you and I I tell you you you
[1:50:16] hear you had said a lot you're going to
[1:50:18] continue here be
[1:50:20] said we are blessed that God God would
[1:50:23] send this message that he promised in
[1:50:26] his word to you and I because let me
[1:50:29] tell you what this message is this
[1:50:31] message is Jesus Christ revealed to be
[1:50:35] the same yesterday today and
[1:50:39] forever it's a promise in his word I I
[1:50:42] thought as I'm listening to the message
[1:50:44] in 1965 of leadership I thought of how
[1:50:47] the prophet takes that message and he
[1:50:50] deals with especially you find it he's
[1:50:52] he's honing in after the seals of open
[1:50:54] and showing us of how that that word
[1:50:57] it's got the anointing of the holy
[1:50:59] spirit it's got to come down to the
[1:51:01] inside to where there is a complete
[1:51:03] change of desires and
[1:51:06] nature to where it's not just something
[1:51:09] where we're going Upon A gift or a
[1:51:11] feeling or an emotion it's got to be
[1:51:14] something that brings
[1:51:16] rest the Christian life is not meant to
[1:51:21] be a life of turmoil
[1:51:23] up and down
[1:51:26] unsettledness it's a life to be
[1:51:29] established in Psalms 27 thou Hast set
[1:51:34] me upon a rock thou has healed me let me
[1:51:37] just try to wrap this my time is gone
[1:51:40] let me just wrap this point we'll pick
[1:51:41] it up
[1:51:44] here this is why God would speak to us
[1:51:48] with such Clarity in this
[1:51:51] hour it's for you and I when there's
[1:51:55] things that we can look at just as I
[1:51:57] said moments ago about rest and
[1:51:59] settlement these are things let me just
[1:52:01] say this to you now I'm going to just
[1:52:02] drop into maybe a counseling mode here
[1:52:04] when you're hearing the word come like
[1:52:06] that across your life let me tell you
[1:52:08] something God's not trying to run you
[1:52:10] out of the sanctuary what he's trying to
[1:52:13] do if there's things that you're seeing
[1:52:15] at that moment those are moments and
[1:52:17] times to say Lord I'm going to take this
[1:52:19] and pray about it Lord I want a
[1:52:21] settledness in my life I want rest in my
[1:52:24] life Lord this is what you've promised
[1:52:26] Lord You're The One Lord who makes it
[1:52:28] real Lord you're the one who does this
[1:52:30] you see what God is doing if we leave
[1:52:32] out of here and we don't pray about
[1:52:34] anything then I think we've missed it it
[1:52:37] ought to be things we leave out of here
[1:52:38] and just say Lord just be it unto me
[1:52:41] Lord there's things God spoke to our
[1:52:43] hearts that we can pray about let me
[1:52:46] just read this in
[1:52:47] closing my I wish I had much more time
[1:52:51] here
[1:52:53] and the reason I say that is
[1:52:55] because sometimes it's hard to get back
[1:52:57] into that same point that same vein but
[1:53:01] I have there's there's much here and I
[1:53:03] want to lay this in I don't want to just
[1:53:04] skip it I want to lay it
[1:53:06] in the prophet said Jesus alone can lead
[1:53:09] you to that eternal life there's no
[1:53:12] church no denomination no preacher no
[1:53:15] priest no nothing else can lead you to
[1:53:18] it you must be led by him the only one
[1:53:22] that can lead you could you imagine him
[1:53:24] now here's where he tested could you
[1:53:26] imagine him leading you out of his word
[1:53:30] which that's him if he is the word and
[1:53:33] you're a part of him won't you be part
[1:53:35] of the word the word that God wants to
[1:53:38] pour the Waters of Salvation upon today
[1:53:41] to identify him today like the apostles
[1:53:43] identified him Luther and Wesley and all
[1:53:46] the rest of them identified him in their
[1:53:48] day it was the word in that day and so
[1:53:50] the prophet said the things that we see
[1:53:52] taking place now is predicted in this
[1:53:54] hour so accept Jesus Christ and let him
[1:54:00] lead you to eternal
[1:54:03] life is to accept him and let him lead
[1:54:09] you I think that's probably a good place
[1:54:12] to just draw it up right there
[1:54:13] Hallelujah don't stop keep
[1:54:17] moving accept him let him lead
[1:54:20] you keep leading
[1:54:23] how far how how do how how long do I
[1:54:25] follow you follow until the very atoms
[1:54:28] of this body are changed until until you
[1:54:30] see your loved one standing before you
[1:54:33] following daily daily seeking Lord let
[1:54:36] thy will be done in earth even as it is
[1:54:39] in heaven Lord lead me you know it's
[1:54:42] before me today you know the traps that
[1:54:43] are out there today Lord lead me Lord I
[1:54:46] want to walk according to your counsel
[1:54:48] Lord Lord God I don't trust my feelings
[1:54:51] I don't trust my reasoning because
[1:54:53] listen I've gotten myself in
[1:54:56] trouble God never got me in trouble God
[1:54:59] has never ever led me
[1:55:03] wrong I've went under Impressions and oh
[1:55:05] I felt this or I felt that and all of it
[1:55:08] at the end of the day you realize Satan
[1:55:11] when he steps back after that then
[1:55:13] you'll come around and say see there's
[1:55:15] nothing to you look at you you can't
[1:55:17] even find the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:55:20] what kind of a person must you be it's
[1:55:22] Satan wanted to lay a trap to try to
[1:55:24] destroy your confidence but let me tell
[1:55:27] you something it was not your good works
[1:55:30] that brought you where you are it was
[1:55:32] Boaz that took notice of your
[1:55:38] life and though you may have faltered
[1:55:40] though you may have failed though at
[1:55:42] times we went after wrong Impressions
[1:55:44] but that's a time to get back up and be
[1:55:47] lined right back up and say Lord forgive
[1:55:49] me Lord I'm going to walk on with you
[1:55:53] because remember your confidence can
[1:55:55] never ever be in
[1:55:58] yourself the prophet said you get to
[1:56:00] lifting even up a man he said God will
[1:56:02] let that man make a mistake to shake
[1:56:04] your confidence back to where it needs
[1:56:06] to
[1:56:08] be are you hearing me I've watched that
[1:56:10] I've watched those things take place
[1:56:11] because why people oh this man and we
[1:56:14] need to follow this man and oh this man
[1:56:15] is the one who needs to pray for us oh
[1:56:17] this man is the one and they what it
[1:56:19] begins to follow a man
[1:56:22] and toste of recognizing what is it that
[1:56:25] has touched my
[1:56:27] life has been
[1:56:29] God
[1:56:31] Amen well God just don't have one
[1:56:33] address he dwells in a many membered
[1:56:37] body is that right he dwells in a many
[1:56:39] membered body and you know what we can
[1:56:42] have that same kind of cry like David
[1:56:44] David said oh I have longed to see your
[1:56:46] glory and your power in these dry places
[1:56:49] like I have in your Sanctuary David you
[1:56:51] may leave that there can be a move of
[1:56:54] God in dryness even in times of dryness
[1:56:57] of where things might be in your life I
[1:57:00] absolutely do because I know him in that
[1:57:03] way I not only know him to be the god of
[1:57:06] his Sanctuary but I am a part of his
[1:57:10] sanctuary and I know that he's God right
[1:57:14] where I
[1:57:15] am you love
[1:57:18] him I want to accept the counsel don't
[1:57:20] you
[1:57:22] I want to go all the way with him those
[1:57:25] who walking in waters of baptism today
[1:57:27] just like just like the rest of us when
[1:57:29] you start out and you make that step you
[1:57:31] let that determination be I'm follow him
[1:57:34] all the way I F him all the way in the
[1:57:37] waters of baptism I'm following him all
[1:57:39] the way into the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:57:41] following him all the way step by step
[1:57:43] by step of the way until I stand there
[1:57:46] that day on the other
[1:57:47] side I'm going to keep going forward
[1:57:51] yeah amen
[1:57:52] and anybody any friend anything that
[1:57:56] wants to come my way that wants to get
[1:57:57] my eyes and get me to turn this way or
[1:58:00] that way I'm going to keep my eyes on
[1:58:02] him you know why the Bible said
[1:58:03] concerning Elijah spoke to Elisha he
[1:58:06] said if thou seest me when I go you
[1:58:09] shall have the promise all he had to do
[1:58:11] he had a lot of distraction he had a lot
[1:58:13] of things but the first thing that
[1:58:14] Elisha did he said I've got to take care
[1:58:17] of this that's holding me right here
[1:58:19] I've got to take care of this he he
[1:58:21] chopped up the wood he cut up the oxen
[1:58:24] he burnt every bridge back it one no
[1:58:26] such thing as if this don't work out I
[1:58:29] can always go back to plowing Fields
[1:58:31] nope you know what you know why God
[1:58:33] called Elisha cuz he's a man that could
[1:58:35] plow a straight road and God has called
[1:58:38] your life cuz there is a real path in
[1:58:41] your life for the glory of God to move
[1:58:43] down through and be made manifest in
[1:58:46] your
[1:58:48] life if you see me when I go then you
[1:58:52] can have that double portion a lot of
[1:58:55] things tried to distract him a lot of
[1:58:57] things tried to come his way is that
[1:58:59] right but Elisha even Elijah said you
[1:59:01] can stay right here hey you can stay
[1:59:03] right here Elijah said nope I'm going
[1:59:05] with you cuz you said if I see you when
[1:59:09] you go then I can get what is I'm
[1:59:12] Desiring well who told you I never told
[1:59:15] you you could have a abortion oh no you
[1:59:17] didn't per se as a man but when that
[1:59:20] mantle came across me when the wings of
[1:59:23] the Holy Spirit when it came across my
[1:59:25] life that was the voice of God that let
[1:59:28] me know that the promise of God is for
[1:59:30] me and that my purpose was not just to
[1:59:32] plow Fields behind oxen I was meant to
[1:59:36] be a vessel for God to make himself
[1:59:39] known through and live
[1:59:47] in let those are being baptized let
[1:59:49] others maybe here this morning where
[1:59:52] where you're at with god listen a lot of
