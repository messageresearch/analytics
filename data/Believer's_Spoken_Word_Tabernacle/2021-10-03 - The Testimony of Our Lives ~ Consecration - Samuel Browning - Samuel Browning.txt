to have another brian back to leading [Applause] [Music] we'll songs you be seated here just for a few moments i'm so glad to have ryan and sister mariah and each one so i appreciate each of our song leaders amen that god has has given to us and um just spoke with brother bill here just a few moments ago and uh he said he's he's feeling much better than what he was and you remember some of the things what we had in prayer is really this has been the issue since august this is actually leading into august and uh so thankful to god you remember when we we had prayer brother bill was out here a little time and um you know they thought it was some different things but really this was the issue and with his gallbladder and things and i don't i don't go into details with those things up here but um i just was talking with him today and he just just said this morning he said i don't have that pain that i've had in my side and that itching that he had had for you now you can almost say i don't know it's almost close to two months i think when brother george smith was here in the mid part of august so and i just i thank god for the wisdom that god allowed the doctors to tap into that um because of what brother bill had to have done and it was two surgeries he's been through here dealing with the gallbladder it was there on friday and then on saturday was the other surgery so he's doing well he said to thank you for your prayers and he gave me strict instructions as he did on thursday you preached the word brother samuel and um you know so he said i'm getting ready to click in here to stream and so we we certainly love brother bill and just appreciate him and then the testimony for all these years and we just really love him very much and just so thankful and waiting longing for him just to be back here with us and i know if he could have his way he'd be here today but uh lord willing i think tomorrow is when he'll be dismissed from the hospital so let's just keep him in prayer the lord will just continue to give him strength as well also i mentioned on thursday regarding the meetings that we had planned for this coming weekend with brother homer longoria brother homer had sent me a text when i was at the men's meeting last weekend and he just felt and asked if we could just cancel because everything that he's just just kind of the the whole uh toll of everything and everything that he's just had to had to kind of undertake down there and it's been quite a busy time and so we want to just certainly always want to honor that there's been a few times here or there that i've had to cancel out because of things and sometimes i had to one time i had to cancel out just tell a brother said look i'm just worn out i'm just tired i i won one if i came to you just like the way i would be at my own assembly i want to give my very best i said i've got somebody standing in for me this sunday i just want to rest and there's times of refreshment jesus said come aside and rest and we must have those are a very essential event very essential times as well but for brother homer it's not too much i don't want to say a rest he's just there's been a lot that has taken place there with different things funerals and things that's come up so we want to just remember him in prayer and the lord will just make a way for brother homer to be here i just i love brother homer i love i love all of god's gifts and i'm so glad they have such a variety and brother homer just just has a just has a really unique way of and delivery and i just really just always enjoyed the time that we had together so we want to just remember that in prayer so lord willing you know we'll gather here on thursday uh i also want to announce um we didn't get a chance to put up the october calendar but the on the on the october calendar it's uh the last sunday of the month october 31st is the fellowship dinner at the presbyterian uh church right out there um most of you know where that's at the address will be there and we'll get that out to you that'll be right after service on october 31st so we're certainly looking forward to that as well and other announcements they'll be coming out to you so uh and i want to also announce i've got i've asked a few of the brothers here this morning there's four brothers that went down along with me to the men's meeting and i just to me how i feel about the men's meeting if i could just pack every brother up here and take you down with me i'd do it you say brother samuel is that it's that important it's a it's a it's a real um it's a real good meeting and it really gets into some uh just really the word comes and it really challenges our hearts and gets right down very personal and i like that i like for the word to very be i like the word to get personal i like it to challenge our lives because that's that's our way of getting out of here and um we have so much of a great responsibility in this hour and i i i told you at that time when we went into that men's meeting you you have seven services really in just three days and it's really not even saying three days it's actually you have one saturday and then you start on a friday night and you end on a sunday morning but it's filled seven services filled right in there and um but it's my goodness it's it's so edifying i could go on and on about it um but uh i i've asked just for i'm gonna have two of the brothers just to share their testimonies today and just give them just a couple minutes and then we'll go right on into the service would that be okay okay so we're m.i.a right now so okay okay uh don't you come on up he's getting he's getting this microphone right now if it if it goes silent when you're talking that's a sign i'm glad you're saying so i have a couple minutes here it's pretty good because i only wrote down three words i wrote these down uh right as we were leaving the the services actually and uh these three words just kind of came to my heart so uh concerning the men's meeting you know the first first word i wrote down was focused uh these these meetings are very intense they're very very direct and very very focused so that leads right into the next and brother samuel already covered that that means they're challenging the holy spirit can really get down into some areas and do do some pretty uh pretty good excavating of our lives and so but what really sets these meetings uh apart from i believe uh from a lot of the other other things that we we see out in the world and such is is uh the third word was uh applicable and this is where you really have uh you know there's a lot of good help since and different things out there but you know we have um even some that you know come straight from the bible and such but what the difference is is we have the open book you know we had the word we had you know the the message that came this day and really opened up um the word to us so that's what these meetings uh actually really really uh meant to me uh one of the brothers actually covered it is the um the world does a pretty good job at uh defining problems and and identifying problems that you know they have enough surveys and they have enough people who can diagnose different things and the computers are big enough now to really you know crunch all the numbers and the programmers are good enough to write really smart programs and stuff and that was for brother brian back there so they can identify the problem what they can't do is give you the solution and uh you know we know we have the solution you know we have the answer you know christ is the answer so that's what it really meant to me was just really seeing the open book on display you know and and the word just coming forth in such a direct in such a focused and challenging way um and each one of us were kind of at different stages in our lives you know the young i was kind of in the middle and there's you know some of the older ones but you know the lord just had something for everybody and uh and in one of the bible studies the it was in philippians there where it says you know putting things putting you know forgetting the things that are in the past i pressed towards the mark of the prize of the high calling in christ jesus and that's kind of where i was in this stage you know kind of midway through already you know married and had a career sort of so but the holy spirit still gave me tools on how i can press forward i can forget the mistakes in the past and i can press forward so i would just encourage uh men of all ages you know there's gonna be something there for you you know uh the lord will not leave your plate empty so that's that's what i took from it and i would just encourage you know no matter no matter where you're at god will have something for you in these men's meetings it'll be focused it'll be challenged but he'll give you something applicable for your life and whatever stage you're in so god bless [Applause] come on right now all right so i'd like to build on what brother dave said but um really what i want to say and i'll be praying for all the brothers here to to join us next year but um what i'll say is definitely bring your baggage not your physical baggage but your your spiritual baggage because you get to leave it down there you know and really you know that was probably the most powerful part and my biggest struggle going in was work issues and realizing i can't save dishonest co-workers i can't save um you know family members that are living a worldly lifestyle you know only god can do that so and i truly went down there with a a mindset that was scriptural which is ephesians 6 12 and i came back with the armor of god for sure and which would be 6 13-20 so my mindset was more and we spoke on it on the way down the condition of the of this hour and of the world we can just stare at how ugly everything is and talk about it and god heard us speaking about it and he healed us of it and we talked about it on the way back that was a testimony but just all the brothers brother samuel you know i told everyone we get to see brother samuel every thursday and sunday and the brother saying on that saturday morning it wasn't the brother samuel i know it was just it was god's it was god's message and although there are seven services there's one message that is three days long and it's one message yes sir um and then jack duff came right after brother samuel and just you know offered something completely different more about being a father told the story of the the papa elephants that left the scene and the baby elephants started to kill the rhinos and then they brought the papa elephants back and all the rhinos stopped dying so it truly uh makes you want to be a better father better worshiper prayer you know son father anything any role in life it improves and then saturday obviously was the longest day but you know brother brian kept saying have you ever heard jason watkins brother jason like no well you're in for a treat i said i feel like i feel like i've already had a treat so i said this is a brother's retreat but really it's a it's a treat it's not a retreat it's a treat and the whole thing was a treat but brother jason summed up the weekend really well and he said this whole weekend has been about you accepting your role and i just that was real powerful it makes you just think well what's my role um and then the most touching part no offense to all the pastors that were there but the most touching part came from brother david kress and he put his hand on my shoulder and said you know one day you know life's going to be like this you're going to go to the elevator god bless you brother you're going to go to the cafeteria god bless you brother you're going to go to the restroom parking lot you can go everywhere and it's going to be god bless you brother amen to that and that's uh that's how i'm gonna end it there [Applause] well let's stand i so appreciate those brothers for sharing we've got a couple other brothers brother brian holdren and brother dave senior and i also want to say this week here i just was brought to my attention they have the archives up archives for the services they're not videoed you can just i know some of you like downloading the mp3s and just listening to them on the job or other ways these you can do that and i i would just i would really really encourage you to do so there's just so much good application within it and i just what brother drake and brother dave had mentioned it's for all ages i i was just just so encouraged i've seen young men who were there some of them i know from the youth youth camps and youth meetings and things like that and you know 17 years old and 18 years old i was so glad to see them there because there's things sometimes you can look and sometimes we look and say when we get to this spot we need to hear this there's a lot of things that's so good that i always think how brother branham said it like this but brahman says let my mistakes be stepping stones of god's grace for you and i always look at that to me that's a real character to be able to put yourself out there and go and go through that and we truly brother brahm told us he said joshua benefited he learned from moses so not only did he take the message in but he also learned don't send a bunch of people over so he didn't send 12 people to go to go to jericho he sent two you knew you don't you don't need it you don't need a whole company he's seen that and brother tells us that so there's a lot there's things that we thank god just to be able to be observant within that i just really thank brother barry for having that vision and one of the things i shared this with you on thursday we look at things in the word of god and i and i this is one of the things that i was is bringing even with the brethren there and i said it on thursday here satan is subtle but he's very intentional and we need the discernment of the holy spirit over and over and over in our lives i witnessed it right there in the life of the prophet through the message that there were things that unless god uncovered it took god to uncover it but quickly when god uncovered it the prophet sided with god who uncovered him and and that's why i just told the brother and i said we we cannot afford in this time in this hour just to say well something we just put it on autopilot it's not autopilot that's not how the gospel works the gospel works to bring a change in a real direction in our life but then as the word is coming forth we prostrate ourselves before living god and say god change me mold me shape me and that's why i just put that word we must be if there's maybe even to bring this to the assembly here to put it before our lives there's one thing we need to be is very intentional very intentional with what we're doing and so we just we we thank god for this and i want to just just approach some things here this morning and we'll just see how the lord will just just take us and so if we could just turn in our bibles to psalm 65 and verse 4 i was standing there in the back when i walked in and then i got there to the service i had to go back down i was waiting on brother paul to bring him up to the tabernacle there the chapel and you walk in and if you've never heard just i don't know what was it 200 250 300 brothers if you never see hear all men singing my goodness i mean it was just it was just something just to see just the brethren just just worshiping and and then you know as as time went on and things like that sunday morning well i had to get a few videos sunday morning because brother jack was leading songs and we had a time man we had a time so i just love to worship the lord don't you amen i believe there should be liberty in the house of god amen so psalm 65 verse 4 could we just bow our hearts in prayer heavenly father thank you for your mercy this morning thank you for this opportunity that we have to be able to gather here the lord we would just ask in these next few moments that you have given to us would you just help us lord i pray lord in that our hearts our spirits our minds oh god every part of our being lord that it would be open and sensitive to your voice lord i give myself and this congregation lord into your hands completely and ask that god that you might lead us and guide us and be glorified in everything that is said and done we pray father we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen amen psalms 65 and verse 4. if we can just begin there and that's only verse i'm going to read here this morning blessed is the man whom thou chooseth and calls us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple amen may god bless the word and reading as you're being seated i want to start here with a thought we've we've been looking at uh over the past a few services here and then as brother nathan came right along and my goodness i mean you it's just awesome how god puts things together isn't it and um you know god is so mindful of our needs and i want to just look at this the thought here this morning and just begin to deal with this a little bit on the testimony of our lives and i want to look at one word consecration when brother branham means he takes this in a hidden life with christ he says just like god living in those three courts he surely lives in the court of the congregation he lived he also lives here at the holy place but his abiding place he says this was just attributes of his presence from the holiest of holies has everybody got that image in your mind that that picture if you need me to put it back up i can do that as well anybody need me to put it back up it's felt like a classroom okay i'll put it back up it's okay i get accused of being thorough no no no need to stop now so this is what we're this is what we're dealing with and i want to just look at this here just a moment this is what we're as we're looking at this tabernacle remember this is the place where god said let them build me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them god's desire remember god dwelt among them where god created man brought forth a woman they lived in that place of god's presence there in the garden of eden the whole earth wasn't the garden of eden the garden of eden was a specific place chosen by god as a matter of fact the very word hebrew or the very word garden in the hebrew means a bride an enclosed one so here the garden of god it was a place reserved by god for him and his family to dwell and to see that how we know sin entered in and then there was an exiling from his presence but god made a promise that he said i will make a way back and the way that would be made is that god would become one of us he said i will give to the woman a seed because the woman has no seed but god said i will give her a seed because within that seed sets the nature sets the life god himself would create a blood cell and step into it that the blood itself would pay the price and then the life contained in that blood cell now could come back upon the worshiper already having a seed of god and raised that seed to life because that seed is actually god's dwelling place and god will not reach down and take it but he says let them make me a sanctuary you see serving god is not under do's and don'ts it's under a surrendered life so it all is a beginning with a yielding life so this when god would give many many many types through the scripture the tabernacle of the wilderness three quarts as we look at it you and i live in a three-room house body spirit soul the innermost part this this part that was in that is that is in here this is that place some of you i know you think i love doing this but it is pretty neat but it helps me get get visually the point across here that's the abiding place what i just read to you brother brahm says he lived throughout all the other courts so what does that mean is that god's presence this is where god abided his presence came down where he gave the testimony which the testimony is his word being placed in the ark which the ark is a type of the human heart this was god's desire now when that is there then the rest of these courts that are here our spirit out here our body out here god dwelling on the inside it now reflects itself out here so these hands do god things the spirit thinks god's thoughts see he lives in the other courts but he abides amen this is what this is why the baptism of the holy ghost just out here in in the uh uh on the flesh or on the spirit that's where brother branham makes a statement a person could have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour of their life and still be lost and go to hell why because it's not in here in the abiding because when it abides it changes you you're no longer the same person amen and then it affects it it shows itself throughout the rest of the courts now well i want to what i'm going to go to here lord willing here this morning just how the lord will take us um i want to just deal with these are the things and i'll go and let you know so you have it visually i want to i want to dwell with deal with this part of where we are and come to back in here but i want to deal with the part of coming to this place and the real coming to this place when we look at it in terms of the tabernacle in the wilderness we look at it as though it's us making steps forward but if you can really capture it it's not so much us progressing forward it's us yielding and allowing the holy spirit to move deeper because if we put it it's us going forward it's our works but if we can recognize it's all about yielding and then it's the holy spirit going deeper so now you switch that off benjamin thank you it'll keep you on your toes this morning if i have to refer back to something huh so just like god living in those those three courts brother bram says he surely lives in the court of the congregation he also lives here at the holy place but his abiding place and he says these were just attributes of his presence from the holiest of holies i can't deal with this here this morning but even in that place of our life there are many of those places there than our life once that abiding presence of god you and i now in our life all things have become new yet you might have the same old job amen got to make out the same old insurance papers are you with me drive the same old car whatever you know age your car is lease or whatever you understand those things are not changed what changes god has got the control on the inside god doesn't take away even a person's temperament that's right that's good right yes sir god doesn't say you know what i don't like melancholy people brother brahm tells us he was melancholy is that right you can read it brother brown when he was up he was up and he was down he's down right melanchola is gonna be right on the marker got to be nailing nailing the eyes of the squirrels out of the way god what did brother them say billy bram sat down and said oh why am i this way god said i made you this way for a purpose [Applause] but you take the temperament that brother branham had without the influence of the holy ghost from the soul it was nothing but yielding in the hands of god now in god's hands becomes like the little lad's lunch it multiplies it ministers to others around him we bring it down ministers to our family ministers to one another what is it it's his abiding presence now that ministers throughout our life and has an effect over our life so david i want you to think of this here david knew david knew there was a place to where in god to where he could experience the abiding reality his soul was craving for and i want you to catch this the abiding reality david could say take not thy holy spirit from me because all the way until the lord jesus walks up out of the river jordan the holy spirit had come would leave come leave come leave but now the holy spirit descends upon the lamb that's why brother graham said see predestination he was already a lamb when he came there the word does not make us a lamb the word brings lambs to full reality because others won't do nothing to do with it others will not surrender to the call of the word what did jesus say my sheep know my voice this is before the new birth and then after the new birth we become locked into his voice so brother brown when he when he would lay very clearly all the way with the doctrine of predestination and elections and all of those things this is why brother graham can make such a clear statement in the church age book and say you were not you are not you didn't become sheep you always were sheep you didn't become a son of god you always were a son of god and he says because you were a seed of god that's what allowed you to be born again because to be born again is to be born as peter writes of the incorruptible word of god to where your life now matches the word of god this is why brother branham when he takes it i don't know how anybody could ever accuse brother branham of not preaching on the holy ghost that blows me away this statement's always blowing me away in satan's eating 1965. brother bram says i hear around here people been saying why aren't brother brandon preaching on the holy ghost in jeffersonville i don't know i can't listen to a message where i don't hear and there's not a message here i don't care what message i preach it still deals with do you have the overcoming life on the inside as something that is there it's a resolve in order to bring forth brother branham is like being accused he said so i'm going to address that right here he said the holy ghost and he goes into and he says it's not the speaking in tongues and all these other things that's out there he says let me say this to you he said don't watch the holy ghost so much in demonstrations but you watch it in action [Music] because demonstrations this one might speak in tongues this one might have you know a gift of faith and this one might hear and this one right here remember gifts and callings are without repentance repentance doesn't bring them they're laying there hallelujah are you with me this is why elvis presley the beatles and on and on and everybody else who sold out their gifts preachers and everybody everybody will have to give an account because they are without repentance so they had to yield their talents to somebody and come under the influence of one i just want to be found yielding mine to the lord that's uh lord whatever you have for me i just want to be found yielding it there this is why brother brown could say when he makes that in that statement he says not so much in demonstration but in action our everyday life see god's david would have that desire because david knew there was a place and his soul was craving for that and that place of rest is in man it's in christ god's place of rest is inside of man let me just take you not this flesh not my spirit but the real gift of god is that soul you hear me you know i'm quoting these that real gift because that on the inside that's laid their dormant all these years like genesis 1 laid there but placed by god when the holy spirit begins to move upon that what's it doing it's to bring that to life dismiss the influences of darkness over our life you see first the word has to dismiss all things contrary that are hindering light from penetrating so it's god who breaks the darkness when he says let there be light he's speaking to the darkness give away [Music] what light was it that shone first not the sun the shekinah light of almighty god because it is by his light that everything else is set in order so god's place of rest is in man it and this is why coming back to the original place where in his spirit image is reflected in us and through us i want to just read a few places that david in the psalms would write of this desire david would say in psalms 84 1 how amiable meaning how lovely are thy dwelling are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god ye the sparrow hath found a house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will still be praising thee 10 of the same chapter for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand i would rather be a door keeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness [Applause] oh glory you see israel when they would come into the land in that picture that i showed you moments ago god laid all this vision the vision of the word god's desire you see every time when god reveals his word it's god conveying his desire every time these are things sometimes that you and i can take into our lives and say my i just don't seem like i understand that it's really not about that we understand it here i can piece it together there but the word comes and it challenges us and sometimes we look at it and say i i don't see it all but what is why is god doing that he's asking and delivering something to you and i that we might pray about it even when we look in our lives and say i don't see that in my life god's not bringing it to condemn he's bringing it so that you and i can see these are the rights and privileges that you have as sons and daughters of god now seek you first yes sir see god he god's remember he knew he knew the work that needed to be done when he gathered all the disciples and said look upon the the fields they're white they're ready for harvest and he said pray ye the lord of harvest to send laborers into the venue he knew what needed to be done but he's made man his co-worker his partner let me tell you something this is why brother ram could bring it down in souls in prison now and speak of the perfection that has come to the church of the living god through the opening of the seventh seal that opening of the seventh seal is christ coming and taking his rightful place in the heart of his bride he is the hidden man in the heart of the believer that's what the seventh seal does simply put as brother rem said it brings him back down to earth what does that mean brings him back down to earth he was always here he's got vessels that are yielded and available that he can express himself i'm alive i'm a well my power is still the same i have the same glory i'm not diminished what's one iota whatsoever and i'm here to declare that i'm still the same and i'm doing it through my bride hallelujah so here as it brings it down and brother brown would take those whole groupings of statements and souls and prisons and say now that we have been brought back into that place united with the mind of christ the holy spirit operating our life because we don't think this way are you hearing me we don't think this way even when we read the bible we can look at it and say oh that's precious but the thoughts of god are not things that we read the thoughts of god are spiritually revealed this was a realm brother brown we'll call it a realm that we are privileged by the holy ghost to tap into because let me tell you something we can all fellowship on this point we have a choice daily in our life you say brother samuel are you talking to born again i'm talking to everybody here i don't preach to one group of people i preach to everybody no matter where you're at we have a challenge daily in our lives whether we're going to live by our own human mind or the mind of christ if you don't have the mind of christ then you don't have that choice but you can receive the mind of christ i'm talking about the holy ghost and now now when you receive the mind of christ it's to yield to his mind you see what do you mean well instead of reaching for a gun in the pasture of a bull now you're operating by the mind of christ remember brother branham here he is what is it what was i speaking of it's just things are natural right i mean they're saying your natural responses there's things nobody had to tell us about how some of the natural dna some of the natural flow that came off of our family tree come on now god's cleaned out a lot of all those things have been changed within our nature but there's certain things still about us that didn't get stripped out god just said you know what i'm gonna come down in the midst of your temperament of your mind and i am going to create an eden in the midst of your life you want to know how adam led the animal life hallelujah come on now animal life take a look this boy right here animal life brother bam said one without the holy ghost is lower than a dog he'll make decisions do things that's based simply upon self but when the holy ghost comes on the inside god displays that once again a son of god is now reigning on earth and is bringing animal life in subjection to zoe life are you with me oh glory be to god this is the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god it brings into subjection our own thoughts about things listen god's not a cookie cutter you know god's not saying well you know what i want everybody to think like brother richard or brother samuel brother gomez or brother carl thank god thank god you all don't think like me i'll go and say for brother richard thank god we all don't think like brother richard sister marie is ready to shout [Applause] jesus help us but see god ain't interested in changing he don't want to change of how a personality remember brother graham said in things that ought to be he said if you tried to judge james by peter you'd be putting them out oh because peter does this and james brother bran brings that out and things that are to be it's not that god sets down in the middle of our temperament let me just qualify this a little bit too when this does not give this is not any little bit of wiggle room for an excuse to say well you know my daddy was like this and my mama was like this well you know if i hadn't been raised this way if you have been born again of the spirit of god you've got the answer to the devil's question i'm pointing to the victory that lays in you that victory that's in christ you have it don't let the devil sell you short you're more than an overcomer your mind and a match for the devil with the biting presence of almighty god dwelling in your life greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world see this is where when israel that pillar of fire would come down and here it would rest and abide god's presence you're coming into that innermost place israel could see it israel witnessed it even when it happened in the days of solomon when solomon's the temple remember solomon built the temple and now became instead of walking around and moving in tents it became a building comprised of stones which testifies of our life both of them do but even there's a kind of glory i don't want to lose you on that but i want to just focus on this part on the coming of the life of almighty god in behind the veil the rest of the world couldn't see it the rest of the world you and i have that the previous picture that i many times we see at the christian bookstore you see online and here you see the rest of the world could not see that but israel knew by faith he was back there he said how did he know because number one the pattern that god gave by his word he had a prophet on earth that could catch his thoughts that operated beyond natural senses and was caught up into a spiritual realm is that right moses was caught up in the cloud that's why it's no shock to us god still deals with clouds in sabino canyon the prophet was caught up in the cloud we understand this we're scriptural is that right elijah saw the coming rain the rain that was promised upon a dry and barren land what was it a cloud the size of a man's hand was that a type of the hand of the lord the power of god coming as nourishment to the church of the living god amen it was received in the cloud taken away they saw him and he said this same jesus will come in like manner so there's the whole process unfolding so israel knew like brother brown would say like this israel knew that he was back there everybody else they could question it they what do you mean god's back there who is this god but see israel knew it brother brown would put this out over and over they knew it by faith regardless of what all the unbelievers could say the unbelievers could say you know what do you mean god in your midst it didn't matter they knew all the skeptics could say whatever they wanted to say brother brahman says regardless of what anybody said they knew he was back there can we bring it on home regardless of what the devil tries to say regardless of what might come your way you know something's happened to you you know there's a god back there behind skin in your life [Applause] you know there's a god who's seated on the throne you know there's a greater there's one inside of you you're not the same person you used to be your desires have been changed and your life has become filled with the life of almighty god that's a sovereign work by almighty god you can't study yourself into it you can't read yourself into it you can't work yourself into it you must yield yourself oh that's why brother brown calls that that that coming in there and mighty god he calls that coming of the pillar fire in there on that mercy seat because where is the mercy seat it's in the heart of the believer you say the heart of the believer i thought the mercy seat that he ascended on high and sent gifts back to men but remember what was in heaven must be reflected on earth my my mind because you see now he is seated in power and glory and honor and what does he do he sends back the holy ghost and now he takes his rightful abode and abiding place in the mercy seat of our heart and what does it do just as he overcame and is the overcomer it shines towards an overcoming life through you and i that's the great secret [Music] oh that's the great secret that half hour this is the great secret the descending down of his presence you see this is that place that man fell from you see this is what all of the horse riders in the seals has been about those are all through the ages what was that all about to take away the power of the real relationship between god and man and substitute it and give them just put your name right here and you can be part of a church just say you believe in jesus you can just be a part it's the substitute the personal christ in the spirit of the believer satan don't care how religious somebody is right it don't matter what it is he wants to withhold from that life because he knows when that life a person moves in there point of no return call me gone [Applause] well glory to god you see this is the place that man that man fell from perfect fellowship a oneness with god where the very image of god was now it was on display in man's life remember how brother brown would put it there in the message oneness of how that here they had god's holy image dwelling in them they were in god's image and they were united with his presence brother brown would say it like this i don't have that quote up there it's in front of me but let's just listen to the realm and the atmosphere the privilege of where that they had the privilege to walk and god has brought us back to that same place that everybody can have that same privilege that we can walk in this place he says where he guided them oh i can't think if there's anything greater that we have need of as lord guide me [Music] guide me guide me lord so brother simon oh yeah i need in the truth brother branham preaches the message of guide and brother branham brings it down in the add a ladder part of that he says i'm not a fisherman i'm not a hunter i'm not he says as a matter of fact every trophy i've got it's because he's guided me to them whoo that's humility because brother brown knew the heels brother brown knew how to get around brother brown was a good shot but how he put it back around is it's god who has guided him to these things who he fed them god provided for them he loved them he communed with them constantly all the time this was where they were before the fall this was where the abiding presence of god this is where god's desire is to come back into that place of where his holy image his life is now reflected through our lives let's come back to the scripture here for a few moments in psalm 65 verse 4 and let's look at this here just a little bit in verse 4 blessed is the man whom thou chooses you didn't know it but you were already blessed and when he came to mary he never said cursed art thou blessed our tower among women you want to know why your life's been a little different all your life blessed are you among women blessed is the man whom thou chooses and calls it so now the choosing of god now notice and causes to approach unto thee for what purpose that he might dwell in thy courts now in the courts of the lord is dwelling in christ dwelling in the word remember at that day you shall know that i am in the father the father in me i in you and you are in me so remember god's place of rest is here within man so the courts of the lord dwelling in his presence dwelling in his word dwelling in his life i'm just going to make i just have to you know i had to be myself when paul could stand there on mars hill and he saw this inscription to an unknown unknown god is what it said paul said i want to tell you about this fellow so paul took his took his text maybe he would take his text from luke 24 and say but i'm going to take the whole bible this morning for my text and paul began to minister the word and what did he let him know what you've been bumping into throughout your life this is the living god of whom we live breathe he's right here see god it's like this there's signals coming through here if i take this belt back this morning and i turn this thing off and i get a power switch if i turn it off it doesn't matter how loud i scream there's no signal going to be sent out of here but when i turn this on there's a signal there's a channel on here it's tapped into a channel over there that's how we can have three of these up here at the same time and they don't give you the they don't give you that you know why because they each have their own selective channel and frequency and paul was chosen by god he was tuned in to the frequency of jesus christ in that hour and he was sent forth as a united vessel to make the invisible god visible right there in the midst of those people that's what real leadership is real leadership comes from a living god coming down and taking on skin amen [Music] so the same god the one as brother brandon would put that there we referenced that in uh warning before judgment brother brown said that same one that presence you've been bumping into throughout your life bumping into it or was it god yes watching over you what do i do now recognize his presence recognize he's dealing with you recognize his desire to have a union and a relationship with you so you're no longer bumping in it you now live in it oh jesus hallelujah notice that he might dwell in thy courts look at this we shall be satisfied with the goodness of the house even of thy holy temple so god's made the way of approach paul would write of it in hebrews 10 19 i'm going to have to move here having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh so this way that's been made through the shedding of the blood it was consecrated for you and i there was no way for us to get back into god's presence god came and he became the way he became he said i'm the way the truth he became the way back into the holiest of holies because you see when he came the second adam was made a quickening spirit when he came down what did he do he manifested what adam had in eden that's what he manifested he declared in his first coming what was lost in his second coming come on on the day of pentecost when he descended there that was a seal of the first company coming that opened the second coming and when that seal was given of the holy ghost what did it do it declared the same thing in those many membered bodies that it did in that one vessel where god became flesh it declared he was the same yesterday today and forever and then here at the ending of the gentile dispensation now here there in the climaxing the finishing up as he steps forward he comes in his fullness once again to declare himself that i am the same yesterday today and forever it declares you know what's being declared right now among the bride of jesus christ this is what the early church was come on now if that vine ever puts forth not the church if the vine ever puts forth if the vine never puts forth so the word giving birth to himself if that vine ever puts forth another branch it all right another book of acts behind how glorious is the branch of the lord in these last days what is a branch a yielded vessel that's been counted worthy to escape these things think about this how that god's made a way a confidence that we can come in to this place of a union with him and having over the high priest a high priest over the house of god remember we are that house we are that house this right here is a place that we've dedicated to come and to have fellowship with him to eat from the table to receive the ministering of the word right and then just inviting god to let that word that we heard we've ate on become flesh in us ben take me back to the courts please this is another place how brother branham would type this out so you can see this and find a good color here so you can see this he called it the kitchen this living room forgive my writing this bedroom kitchen you eat right and from the looks of us we enjoy it that right but now we must go from the kitchen to the living room the living room is where you you begin to rest from the food you've been eating are you hearing me man you get you you know you kick up you know like them comas we go into on thanksgiving or they call them carb comas but when does it go from a living room into the bedroom the bedroom is where we find rest the bedroom is where new life takes place okay ben going back so this whose house that we are now i want to uh just deal with this point here just a little bit on consecration and just just give me a few moments here on this just to lay this part in and the objective is to see it also if god will help us to come to a place even the beginning of this morning into a challenging place where it's a continual consecration in our life brother brown he deals with this this this quote has been one that i've just just in in listening to those messages and i told you here uh some weeks ago if you haven't listened to all you do is type in your app hidden life there's three messages with that title hidden life with christ they're not very long messages but those listen to those messages and then why some are so tossed about where i think pentecost failed and the interview all those are very this right here is where the inspiration and see it just continues to unfold through the message it doesn't it doesn't the message is not like segregated pieces it's a flow it's a whole picture it's not just isolated chunks it's a whole picture because you see god preparing the people god when in these messages like this god is preparing the people for what his desire is to be in our life god couldn't start the prophet's ministry out with the revealing of the seventh seal is that right but god it had to come now and with that unfolding of the seventh seal then that's identified as the capping of the token in our life where the headship of the word has come down i'm not trying to lose anybody but i don't these some some of these things here if you if you're getting lost sometimes let me just kind of encourage you and dig in a little bit dig in a little bit so brother brahmas is dealing with this here and he's talking about in our lives and he's talking about how that everything is in threes you know for a natural birth it's water spirit uh water blood and spirit right it's natural it's natural birth just in a hospital so forth it's the same those three elements are what constitute a spiritual birth there's a water of the word what's what's the water the preaching of the word brings conviction but also says this is the way yeah see it's it's to bring conviction and then to say this is the way come in hither the blood is holds within it the power to sanctify now we know it's not we don't have the literal blood of the lord jesus christ but it's the spirit of god that now can move into the depths of a life to dismantle worldly desires then comes forth the life on the inside that actually changes it brings new creation on the inside where the old man dies and a new man is raised up see this is something that we've talked about many times is that many times in the way things sometimes are taught and preached is that we're trying to get that old man saying we don't want that old god don't want to god's not interested in saving that old man god wants to kill him because why inside the seed that was shown inside our life there is that nature when you plant a tomato seed you don't have to cut it open and put a germ of a tomato plant in there it's already in there just get it in the ground get it in the right atmosphere at the right season it will start to progress and mature just like the words say it should what's doing it that tomato plant and saying oh let me try to be what's on the back of this of this tomato plant let me try to do it no it's just drink drink push drink drink push out why because what it is everything has already been packed inside of that seed you can't unpack it i can't unpack it but the god who packed it is the one who unpacks it hallelujah don't worry i won't get there with the brothers not packing their own suitcases but notice brother brown brings that in to those three places justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost i want you to catch what he says here i think i gave this one to you out of hidden life [Music] brother brown says it like this uh he says there's too many of us can you get to that place here uh maybe up a little okay yeah there we go he said there's too many of us playing in the courts yet that's a powerful statement too many are playing in the courts what does they mean by playing it doesn't mean that people are being disrespectful or irreverent it means that they're not really focused and listen when you've repented of your sins hey we all know it's like a load goes off of you is that i mean it's a load because why it's coming into the identification of what he already did he don't come down right here oh i'm going to come down and forgive your sins he makes real what he already did he already packed it away now we are having the experience of that see he said there's too many of us playing in the court yet so what now i want you to speak i want you just to work with me here a moment this this statement here because i'm not going to leave this just out here in a justification sanctification point that's not how god dealt with me when we're playing two rounds when brother graham says just playing blessed playing too much in the courts yet it deals with god calling us to even a greater sincerity and devotedness in our lives the worst curse that could ever be upon us is we set back like we got it made the seal of god does not do that amen look how paul would write of his own life i count not my own self that word count means think to be perfect but yet he was he already had the perfection of god in his soul by the baptism of the holy ghost but he recognized there as long as i live every day every moment it's got to be a further maturing and growing in the presence of almighty god amen there's too many of us playing in the courts yet we don't look at this we don't take our lives over with christ to be hid away we don't brother says the fruits of the spirit proves that it goes on he says we might think we are but until your life measures up that's what proves it i don't want to deal with the fruits of the spirit today but you know peace long suffering joy and love and i'm both saying i've got such joy really tell your faith hopefully samuel i got such long suffering i can't stand that sister really really it might need to be a little bit of work in the courts well who keeps up the courts the priest we just say with today's message by their fruit problem says he said by their fruit you shall know them not by their denomination but by their fruit you shall know them if i can bring this on down here it's not by what church you go to who a pastor is or i believe brother brahm's a prophet or i believe this message it's not known by that if you have to tell somebody you're a christian you need a voice that's greater than your voice me preach because it must be god declare those that are his amen abel obtained a witness that he was righteous right oh my that's what the abiding presence it it moves and it does upon our life it identifies us as believers brother baby goes into the fruits of the spirit and he says now it's love joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience meekness shoe boy these are all good temperance i just can't help it temperance is self-control man we got to go he said well we needed more fruit more lives to prove it he said we've had testimonies i want you to catch this thought i'm going to need about 15 more minutes can i have that i want to get us to it to a certain spot but don't don't leave on me yet we've had many testimonies but as the old saying is your life speaks so loud i can't hear your voice now notice we had many testimonies was he talking about testimonies here but he's bringing it back to it's not this that really matters it's what comes out of here god never said he'd put the testimony in here but he said the testimony i give you i already have provided for myself a place to put this testimony what task one place is that the show the seed of god and then god said because that testimony is there then it will affect this and you will speak my word by the indwelling of my presence back to eden again oh my where i think pentecost failed i'm reading these very very very intentionally here the man says uh you know he's talking about uh he said we walk close to god he's encouraging my brethren come into the holiest of holies come in and live before god to the holy spirit which takes him message day by day how you're progressing in his kingdom how you're treating his children and what all you're doing till the father will say i have found grace in him now i'll bring him over here before the people then go back to the drawing please remember brother branham paul picks this up in galatians 3 and galatians 4 on the adoption right of children the adoption is not separate from the new birth the adoption is the placing in christ and we grow in maturity are you with me this is the place right here this right here is the place of adoption this is the place where sons and daughters of god become manifest from are you with me receiving the same seed life now upon that seed it brings forth a son and daughter of god now when god's dealing with our hearts as we come in here coming to the outer court we're hearing the word enjoying the word a lot of times you know a person can start to do the outward form of things oh we don't do this outwardly okay i don't do that outwardly oh okay we don't do this okay we don't that's that's wonderful that's all that's part of the journey are you with me this is why brother branham when you take the whole canon of messages hear ye him and brother brahma preached that whole series in place of messages and he's dealing with he says people who've given their lives to god and they're still smoking still cutting her hair still doing other things and he says the holy spirit is taking messages back the holy spirit's taking messages back to the throne on our behavior what's he dealing with because remember a person can come right here in the outer court and they still got all the same sinful desires within them they've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ repented of sin that's remission for past all right all right pass remission of past so whatever is like chasing you down that's what repentance does it cuts that off when you repent so you got freedom to go forward in other words so you're not carrying the same baggage to come before him and say father i need a full work you forgave me remitted all previous sins i need a full work to take out the root that caused that in the first amen see these place sons of god and dollars of god coming in and remember it's a progressing as it comes even into this place here into the holiest of holies or not this is the holy so holy but it comes into this place right here and this is the place that i want to actually kind of just speak just a few moments about this place right here this place right here is a place of consecration and i'm just gonna i don't know if i'll go back to my notes or not because i have what's on my heart anyhow this is a place of consecration right here remember in our lives think how paul would deal with this paul would speak through the word of what god has ordained us to be no you're not you're a temple your body's a temple of the holy ghost what's him letting him know hey hey this is you're not here just to go about everyday life you're here to be a witness oh i'm to be a temple of the living god see what's he beginning to do it's god who's beginning to unfold the mystery of your nobody can take the seals off of your book like he can and it takes a bloody lamb to come into your life and take the seals off but see you were sealed up so no other life could enter is that right so he moves in now he begins to make known to you your rights the bible says as many as received him to them he gave the power that was excusia that's right to become sons of god at that point you see in order to receive the dunamis the power of god the transforming power of god you have to know the rights that belong to you amen and you know what you're coming for you're not coming as a pulper a beggar or a you're you're coming in a manner to say lord i'm a son of god and you promised lord the holy ghost hallelujah is that right galatians 4 because ye our sons he has sent forth the holy ghost into your heart right so here the responsibility then as the word makes known to us what brought rightfully belongs to us what you're doing it's calling us to a place of consecration because what's a place of consecration it's a place of separation you see when out here you can look at people that could be out here in this area in the church or in around we shouldn't we shouldn't be looking at one another and judging one another but oh they're still doing this and they're still it's out of court right it was still double dabbling with the things of the world but thank god they're at least in the in the outer court are you with me but we want to encourage them how do i encourage them let your light so shine let them see what you have is genuine let them see what you have is boy i want some of that you ever been in a restaurant and you're ordering somebody else ordering i should have got that you're already wishing you were there the next time that's how our lives ought to be that's what i want i want what she's got i want what he's got our lives are to be salty oh brother samuel out there i'm talking about right in here living lives right here before our families lies before our homes that somebody can say i want what daddy's got i want what mama's got i want one brother so and shows god i won't watch sister so-and-so's god a place of consecration you see right here in this place of consecration boy i have this all marked up and y'all know we can't hardly see see much but right in here can y'all still see this with me making all the marks right in there where i just made that mark right here you have the candlesticks that give light what do the candlesticks do it's a further opening and a pointing to that way what do the candlesticks do they give light over against the veil the light the the seven messengers in the right hand what are they doing reflecting the way to the throne what's the weight to the throne right here see it's reflecting right here it's showing right here it's emitting god's life into the church yes amen oh glory be to god yes you're with me so it's saying it's emitting that to come into that place of holiest of holies so it's a place of consecration this place in here of consecration it's a place of sanctification you might say sanctification this is where the desires and the things of the world are falling away what's what's happening it's not it's not a matter of oh i can't do this or i shouldn't do this it's moving into that place see it becomes a consecration i want to be united with jesus christ a place of consecration will lead to a life of consecration and a life of consecration will keep us in a place of consecration to reflect the life of consecration i didn't lose nobody did i if i lost brother brian we're in trouble a place of consecration is where we're putting ourselves the word is dealing with our lives the word is speaking to us and here we are yielding to that word and that word is washing us it's changing us what is that we're doing he's coming and so the word is leading to a deeper experience in our life let me just say this to you no matter where your experience has been we thank god for every experience there's an experience as i said when a person is justified they have an experience yes we all did i remember what that was like when i was in the brother bill's basement god's grace coming down i also know the experience of sanctification where things you know i knew had to be taken out of my life i knew i knew a lot of stuff had to be taken out of my life i knew and i already knew from from previous times i can't do it on my own you know what that was fearful because i knew i tried before and i couldn't do it i tried before and i couldn't do it he said brother say man what was different is just putting it in his hands and coming to that place i don't want this no more it's not just well this ain't no good this ain't this ain't good for me oh this is bad for my life this people in the world do that people in the world they they go to aaa and everything else i don't need this this is hindering my career this is doing this they do all of that for the natural but that's not how it is with the believer you're not serving god if for that reason it's consecrating yourself to the holy ghost who's dealing with your life and says god take me over completely tired of living an up and down life and having to pray through a day in and day out but we all got to pray through but you understand what brother graham is saying on that right there is to where we come to that settlement on the inside that i know that i know that i know that i know i pass from death unto life and in that place of consecration he takes us into the life of consecration amen then with the life of consecration it'll reflect out here it'll reflect out here this is why out here we do the things we do out here visibly is because there's a consecrated life that's consecrated to the word this is why we need the word to come and say it's a dress but you don't meet the standards that's why we need that this is why we need the word to come and deal with things in our family life what does it do that brings us to a place to consecrate ourselves before the living god and say lord change me from glory unto glory unto glory unto glory unto glory unto glory amen a consecration to god i'm just going to close here this is the this is the this is the place uh in this place here this is the type right here man let me see if i can just this is just uh ben close it off just for a second thank you okay go back to it that's better oh no it's not i need like four of these slides gotta remember to do that remind you you boys remind me to do that say dad duplicate that slide so you can keep drawing this area right here this area that's a spirit realm god's abiding presence and where life is consecrated then when the word comes and deals with our lives on things what rises up is that seed word on the inside that says yeah lord god says your attitude about something is just not right where's that at it's not in your soul it's your spirit all right all right but god i i need a priest no i have made you kings and priests i've made you to take order and as a king authority to dismantle what needs to be dismantled amen you may just let me close with this so you can see it has is this challenges brother aaron all of our lives brother branham stands there in the message jubilee year jubilee year he just preached word made flesh india trip that morning and in that service i've told you this many times i appreciate how brother branham was so transparent this to me shows a son of god coming to maturity because the son of god coming to maturity don't try to shove blame it takes responsibility god began to deal with his life he said i begin to see a selfish spirit rising up in me he called it further in that message a critical spirit he said because he had read something about a certain minister and he said here i was is criticizing and he says i've asked god and i asked the congregation please pray for me that god will forgive me and remove that from my life jubilee year he preaches that night guess what that guess what that service is all about it's a communion service brother samuel you mean he didn't have a month of paintings come on we've been delivered from roman catholic catholicism you mean he didn't have a week to know come on we're talking about the righteousness of the blood of jesus christ brother when you have repented from your heart it's gone it's gone right there don't let the devil hanging over your head and try to what's he trying to do operate right in here in memory but as a priest of god that's a gate that belongs to you as a porter a porter is one who stands at that gate as a responsibility and says i will only only only think upon things of a good report those things that are virtue true praise if nothing else if they don't come out dismiss it i'm kind of getting in the head of myself here but we're just going to go but i'm just stopping on this point brother branham steps in that message and he's asked the church and jubilee year that night he said will you pray for he says i've asked god to forgive me he said has each of you have asked god to forgive you now there was all sorts of things when brother bran preached jubilee year there was people who needed to really meet the lord face to face in that service see the word deals with all levels in the service it has to it dealt with that then you have brother branham coming around and there's other lives that need to be dealt with because they're carrying weights and see god doesn't want us coming to the communion table with weights sometimes weight loaded down with weights we're carrying burdens that he's already carried sometimes we're carrying burdens that all we have to do is come to the realization repent and recognize him as our burden bearer amen and brother braham says now has we come to this communion table he said i've asked you to pray for me that god would forgive me and cleanse me of that critical spirit but joshua where was that was that his soul no it was in the spirit realm what was it a place of consecration that leads to a life of consecration you see the word deals with our life you say but the same i thought i'm living in here this is a life of consecration but a life of consecration will always consecrate itself to the word when correction comes it'll take correction you know what is it doing it's showing what it is it's the testimony that identifies itself with the word this is why that in here in this spirit realm sometimes we can get soul and out here so occupied with the things of life that we forget you got to feed this inner man so occupied and yet many of these things out in here we have family life out here home life all of our dealings but remember all of this out here all of this see this is what people see right here well we've got a mess up here don't we this is what people see if i keep doing this you'll see it this is what people see this is what people see people see out here whatever's back here and we're responsible don't let anything get between this and that amen what do i do keep the lamps trimmed so the fire burns bright it's a place of consecration that leads to a life of consecration and dwelling in that life of consecration by the new birth it brings us to a place of examining our lives lord am i where you want me to be now that examination of are you am i where you where you want me to be you can look in the courts outer court inner court holies of holies and there should be a be real honest with god but let's say for those of us here that's already into the holies of holiness this is still an examination am i living where you want me to live see god lived in the other courts but his abiding presence was in the holiest of holiness so the question becomes am i living by the abiding presence through the other courts of my life am i allowing the word to discern [Music] thoughts in my heart am i allowing the word to deal with conscience memory reason affection imagination come on listen we're not exempt from these things imagination brother braham says you have somebody just he said somebody in the church he just walks by you and all of a sudden he said the devil said that brother didn't want to shake your hand that brother where is that at if it's a real son of god or daughter of god on the inside they'll come to it eventually and realizing it's only the enemy putting a roadblock in there and as a son and daughter of god listen i don't know they might go a day might go an hour might go a month i don't know but a son and daughter of god they cannot stay in that way because why we are made to express and display the glory of god and god's glory cannot be expressed when our imagination against a brother against the sister against anybody else when that is clogged up [Music] you love him then you can change it back oh you did i trust with all my heart and i believe this is our desire and i want to say this to each one of you i'm not here we have not been here this morning or any other day to scold anybody there's times sometimes where correction or something needs to be given but i look at this these are things god's dealing with our heart in such a personal way and you take brother you take brother nathan now i'm on i'm on a thread with brother nathan along with other ministers as well but these things right here we're not discussing i don't i just i don't discuss what i preach i don't know but god had brother nathan come in here first report i have before before i ever you know pull up the surface first report i get how everything has god just coming together of course he did a much better job but it ain't about doing a better job it's just what god puts on our hearts i look at this and i just think it's a great opportunity for us as this assembly that if our life isn't there yet it's an opportunity that we can come out of playing in the courts to really get serious with god to really get serious i mean you know sometimes you have to tell your kids i mean call nobody's name out but he and i kind of like to have some i like to have fun you know i like to have fun but sometimes i have to tell him it's time to be serious he's to try to go that extra little bit you know wanting to say that funny little line you know and hey we got to be serious it's time it's time to be serious why because what we're getting ready to come into is going to take a serious approach the time we're living in it requires a serious approach and i'm not just talking about when i say the time we're living in the bride of christ is unlike israel because israel was moved back into their homeland by national forces the bride is not moved by national pressures you know i'm quoting it's the spirit of god that puts the people in the bride see we're not people can look out here you know you people go oh my look at this and look at that but the reality is it no matter if all these things that can be seen if you can't discerning the time is discerning our lives discerning who's in our midst and discerning our lives i think it's awesome i think it's a great opportunity and i think it's it's a responsibility right now that we would as brother brown says take our lives out of these other courts and into that holiest of holies you see what he's saying is it's a christian life isn't just living in the outer court right where the prayer where are you oh man the word of god this is so sweet that's so good but brother bram says you get out in front of all the people at your job and on the work and you'll denounce him in a minute go back to everything else you've ever done that's outer court is to take our lives out of the inner court where it's it's not about just our mind now is set we don't do this we do this and we don't do this we do this it's moving into that place of a relationship with him to where our life is changed but samuel i need to understand it before i can receive it satan's told you that lie you need to believe it not understand it believe it and how do i believe it look at wherever your life is where are you dwelling and say god take me in to the holy of holies and if your life is order and if he's not there let him take you there really pour your heart out be honest with him what is that that's a place of consecration the place of consecrations right here that doesn't end with church it goes out of here it goes out of here and then he takes you into that place and then now the word abiding in your life then you can you stand there before the word lord let every action speak of you see let every life let every let it be let my life be a testimony not my words but my life see the things that we do and we say sometimes the things that we don't do say things this is where it takes an evaluation in our life i said i was going to close but i just i feel very very much upon my heart within this controversy don't don't don't let these things go away but ask god say lord for all of our lives mine included is oh god i want to live consecrated to the word of god i want to i don't want to see how close i can get to the edge brother gabriel i want to hug that mountain i don't believe in tree huggers but i believe in mountain huggers hugging that mountain i don't want to see how close i can get to the right i want to club that mountain i want to stay close to him is to take inventory in her own life oh god let everything be lined with you let's pray heavenly father dear god it's in your presence that lord you draw us to approach you as david said that we might dwell not go in and out in and out in and out in and out but come to a place of dwelling in you and there as david said we'll be satisfied with the goodness of thy house lord [Music] i'm asking right here this morning i can't give anybody the holy ghost i realize that but i can pray god and ask that lord according to their faith and the desire of their heart then lord if it has never come to that place of a real consecrated life that's really hidden away with you to where it's just satisfied with jesus it don't matter what the boss is saying it don't matter what suzy's saying it don't matter what nobody else is saying it's satisfied with you there's an abiding presence on the inside [Music] then lord it governs our life the word itself governs our life it directs our life to take accountability to rule our own spirit it directs us lord to where in our lives not just by what we can say what we can quote that's where we go to church [Music] below god a life that bears witness through us lord that we are the children of god lord i pray in this moment of consecration i ask god right through this congregation all of us lord as the prophet himself was very open and very honest lord perhaps right here this morning there's hearts and lives that could say lord i want to move back to that place of consecration i've let a little few things slip in my life i've let some things slip in here lord that's hindering that expression lord of that victory there's little things i've let clutter up things i've let come between me and my prayer my prayer life things i've let me come between me and being in the house of god things that i've allowed to come between me my brother my sister lord i want to move and come into that place of consecration i want to consecrate my life to that word lord a re-dedication a refilling lord because after all you put me here on this earth to be a testimony a trophy of your redeeming grace this world is not my home i'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue i'm just passing through oh god granted this morning hallelujah throughout this congregation lord may our hearts remove be moved in consecration lord may have been moved in a place of consecration that lord for lives to move lord deeper taking their lives out of the other courts and now coming into a place lord to say god let the abiding presence of the holy ghost to be hid away shut away with god in that secret place that place that like israel knew you were behind the veil by faith they knew that while the rest of the world could look no matter what they said we know that something has happened inside we know that god is seated in his rightful position in our lives the word has preeminence [Music] this is what we desire lord i ask god that for every life that's here oh my i wonder right here i know most of you setting a husband and wife together or your family together if you wouldn't mind could we just pray for one another and let's let's make it a real a real sincere prayer we're gonna we're gonna pray together right here if you don't feel comfortable that that's fine but i just want to offer prayer right here together say god maybe his husband and wife can join their hands and say we're gonna consecrate our home consecrate our marriage consecrate our lives we're gonna consecrate we're gonna renew our vows unto god let other things become first place or take priority but right now it's a moment to take consecration let's pray father [Music] you're a merciful god lord there's there's no greater desire than to be fully overtaken by you lord lord jesus you're mindful that sometimes as the cares of life things subtly come in suddenly sometimes lord or wrong feeling can come in suddenly it could be things we've got rights to oh i have a right to this i haven't but remember oh god as your prophet taught us that when we go to thinking we've got a right the holy ghost takes its flight [Music] he said you must become a lamb again lord let that lamb project the lord from the inside to the outside let god whatever that needs to be brought in line in order if there's a gate in that spirit realm that needs to be brought in line in an order granted lord oh god that lord the outside man oh god will reflect the glory and the atmosphere of the shekinah glory lord god an atmosphere of life lord god that token life lord god that reflects itself out that creates an atmosphere oh god granted i pray this morning there's a renewing of desire in our lives lord god that place of consecration that's a place where the altar of incense was where prayer was offered up lord this is where we stand this morning not my will thine will be done [Music] granite lord may lord right now every heart and every life god as confession is made cleansing lord comes and father i pray that god granted lord whatever that hindrance whatever that was lord that was troubling now as the holy spirit just moves down lord as we've aligned ourselves with the word of god lord to just come in and just blow out every flu blow out every channel granted lord in the name of jesus christ [Music] hallelujah don't you love him i tell you these services not just like this but every service i just find myself saying lord i want to be more like you when i find brother brian where brother branham stands in images of christ and he says i want another refilling of the holy ghost he said i want more of the holy ghost to take over more william branham because i want to be more of a servant like jesus was i want more i want more amen i want more i want more i want more to take over more samuel but i can be more of a servant like he was [Music] let me say lord that's this is my life a consecrated life lord consecrate me now this is the song i was thinking of consecrate me now lord for that service lord amen if you if you'd like to sit or stand however you'd like to go and worship i just let's just enter in could we just allow the word just to come and just minister to our hearts if you need prayer in a personal way we'll certainly be glad to pray with you but let's just let's just take in the word and those things that god has moved upon our hearts and let's just let it let it just really move down into our lives moving down hallelujah glory be to god [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah to thy precious [Music] [Music] [Music] and it told thy love to me oh but i long to rise in the arms [Music] [Music] [Music] here [Music] oh here it is now consecrate me now in thy service lord by the power of grace [Music] amen [Music] oh yes and my way oh yes [Music] amen i'll be lost in that
