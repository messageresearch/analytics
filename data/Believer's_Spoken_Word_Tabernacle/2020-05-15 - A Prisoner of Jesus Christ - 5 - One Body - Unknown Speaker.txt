all I could do to stay back in that office many times even during when we were just here by ourselves I would just come out just to sit out here and just wait to be called up sometimes walking down the hall but you know just when I was back there and just to hear everybody singing here and you rejoice and then I was just back there just kind of walking around and praying and the Holy Spirit is come moving right in there to the office I tell you it's just it's wonderful amen and I just want to encourage you you know in the midst of this this time that we're in I want you just to continue as a church just to continue to pray that this will pass that we would be able to gather back together God would keep us safe and I know there's a lot of things that we've had to put in place we're not used to this but I believe that we just keep that focused it's just to be able to be together and so we just we thank God for His mercy we just want to invite him tonight that he would just come and just take control in this in this service tonight we all have needs those that are streaming or we're coming were united in one spirit and we're coming too just to come to papa's house tonight and to

to those in the visible and those in the unvisible in audience tonight or those that are gathered at their homes minister to them Lord just as you minister to us here you're the saint Jesus you're the same God you're not limited Lord by building you're not confined in that but you'll go to every heart Lord that invites you Lord we welcome you we welcome your father we're not gonna treat you like Simon did we welcome you we love you Lord Jesus we not only advise you to a meeting but we mean it Lord we welcome you you're the love of our lives you're our life we ask Lord for every need you are

move on their behalf father Lord may you just come now and just speak to our hearts help me to get out of the way Lord may you be the visible one among us we love you and we thank you Father the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen let's turn in our Bibles if we could Thank You musicians let's turn to Philippians chapter 1 and I want to say is returning there I want to we as a congregation we want to congratulate brother Shane and sister Lily they're gonna be getting married his single days are numbered when he comes back he'll never be the same that's a good thing I agree with that one I agree with that one you didn't want to preach it did you but we want to brother Shane and sister Lily we want to congratulate them and just so appreciate them in the Lord and even how that they move through and approached everything and we just want to be remembering them in prayer the wedding will be there in Texas and you know they've there you can just imagine what things that they've had to go through and narrow things down and you know and I think it is now whether Shawn isn't and now like down to 15 people or so it's real real just immediate family so we just you know the most important thing is that the Lord will be there and who you're marrying is that right sometimes that things come out in a wedding and the only thing people really come out with there's a lot of debt but you want to come out further in love so we just want to remember them in prayer we want to look here in the word tonight in them in a thought and just ask God will just come and speak to our hearts I'm just going to read one verse of scripture and then we'll let you be seated in verse 27 Paul is this is even the opening parts remember to the church that is there or the churches rather in Philip I only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your affairs that you stand fast that means persistent and firm in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel now Lord this will take more than a man's job this will take God amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated notice the desire that Paul would Express here and I want to continue within that thought of a prisoner of Jesus Christ but I want to kind of move over into some things and just as the Lord is just really a quickened many things and just sort of just teach some things and look at it in the first of all in that of one body and that's really the underlying thought tonight I want to deal with here's one body and you'll notice how Paul put it that we would be striving together for the faith of the gospel and not striving with one another but striving together and we've got one laboring for one objective and there's one purpose among us and that's the faith of the gospel that's the same faith that you would write off the common salvation the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and so with it you know if there is a an exhortation that we would strive as a body of believers as an army then it shows there's going to be opposition it shows that it's not going to be smooth sailing but do we there will be opposition that will be against it and so Paul would write this and this is where I want to do deal with or or move from here tonight in back in the very first verse of Philippians 1 Paul noticed the opening of this letter Paul says Paul and to mo theists the servants of Jesus Christ to all the Saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops plural and deacons plural grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ now every one of us you would just would maybe take for granted just for a moment here tonight in that remember the last Commission and it is still the general orders that's given to the Church of the Living God is that of mark 16 go you therefore into all the world teaching all nations and baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they were charged with this commission to preach the gospel you see the blood had already been shed and the life now had come back to the Church of the Living God the Holy Ghost had returned now the preaching of the gospel was to be the sounding of the jubilee trumpet it was to announce the trumpet would be sounded to announce the blood had been shed the ought the atonement had been offered up and it had been received and so it would be there of the very atonement or the life of the atonement of Christ himself coming now and declaring this Liberty in and through how the the mystical body of Jesus Christ and yet when we look at this in mark 16 you do not find one mention in mark 16 of pastors you don't find one mention of deacons why it wasn't the time yet so we recognized that within this you know even as we we look at this in this time that Paul is writing here to local churches collectively that have been established through the region of Philip I it was not one just one church in Philippi many times you find where Paul where even writing the churches in that are in Asia salute you there were many churches and so where Paul is writing this letter is not just going to one church because there were multiple local churches even as it expressed their to the Saints in Christ Jesus to the bishops and the Deacons and so when we look at it there's an admonition here and I want to just really Zone in on this and really if so drag my feet on it just to lay these things in that there is first of all he is writing to the Saints that are in Christ Jesus he's not just writing to a group of people but it is to the Saints Saints meaning the sanctified ones those who are in Christ Jesus this is a personal letter think about it that you were among in one of the churches that were there in Philippi and this letter would be delivered though it is being read to all but you dwelling in Christ Jesus you could look at it and say he wrote this just to me God had the messenger delivered this message just for me it's that personal because it's that personal to us tonight when we read the scriptures we're not reading something of a historical account we are reading something of a love letter that is made real to our hearts we recognize that though the message win and the ascent to any broadcast throughout all the earth but yet there was a for ordained elect of God of who that message was intended for so it's not by chance that this word come across your pathway you did not find him he found you he knew exactly where you were at and the second thing that we could draw a love this that would be a set forth that it would be much like if Paul were let's just say Paul or let's just say brother Branham was writing you know and say to the churches in Ohio and he was writing to the churches in Ohio local churches in an area notice what is exhorting a unity among the body of Jesus Christ they would be striving together that no matter what assembly you go to there ought to be the same motive and same objective and that is Jesus Christ that should be the objective and let me just say very clearly that what God has sent to us in this hour this is why that we can say that this church this more than a building but a place that God has given us and how God has called us together it is that the message that God has sent to us that it would be declared and not just declared but that there would be lives come forth there would be lives that would match and reflect the vision that God showed to the Prophet it is God's work God overseeing it all and so it would be like that where we are striving together for the faith in one spirit and in one mind you know how the Prophet would admonish us in discernment of spirit he would talk about us having a local a home church and he said now don't dis fellowship the other guy that don't belong to your assembly but he said I'll discern we ought to a discern what are they trying to do for the kingdom of God is it the kingdom of God bet they're trying to advance they might have different ideas on certain things because we are all a little bit different but there ought to be the same revelation that is being proclaimed and that is the Lord Jesus Christ when it gets to where a man is put before and a man starts to stand out that's the wrong reflection it ought to be Jesus Christ to where that's Paul himself the messenger that ade he was with fear and trembling lest that they would get confidence in him he wanted their confidence to be in the power of God and so then we look at even the next thing because we realize that we've got one common enemy and that's the devil so thirdly there would be each local body that would be there if do you know a bishop which is a pastor of every assembly there would be deacons there with that assembly they would be united together under the leadership of the Holy Ghost pressing and striving together for the faith you know what it looks like an army there's brigades are very large a brigade would you know can make up almost an entire base but inside of there there are multiple platoons is that right in every platoon you know they can't be looking at you know the Brigadier General or the brigade general they can't just be look at em and saying well you know what I'm expecting you to come down on here and do the inspection no the brigade general said listen husband and father you're to do inspection in your home and then you bring your troops here and then the troops are assembled together among a local body and the local body is a part here of other local bodies which are a part of the universal body of Jesus Christ my who can do that but god oh thank God for His mercy so it comes down to really the same objective and that's Jesus Christ now I want you to think of this here as we look in the scripture in mark 16 because there are many churches but notice there is one church that Jesus claims as his own it's not a building it's not not a group or just a gathering of people but rather it is lives that are transformed and illuminated by his own life now notice in Matthew 16 15 he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt found on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so notice as Jesus is expressing this here he's not was we understand he's not talking about brick-and-mortar or just a group of people who would come under a name of a church but we recognize he said my church he claims he has his church and his church is that which is made up by the redemptive work of Calvary it is what he himself has called and justified it's what he himself has sanctified and it is he himself that is stepped in the midst of his church because his church is to be a reflection of him on earth you're aware and were aware of it it wasn't until you know many hundreds of years later before they ever had church buildings but there were churches and churches where that where there was gatherings of believers that were brought together but there is and there has been and there is one true Church of the Living God you can't join it you have to be born into it it's by elective grace you don't matter what your status are it didn't matter if somebody was a master or somebody was a servant didn't matter what matters is God dealing with the life that he already foreknew even the darkness that can be around that life but underneath that darkness was a redeemable attribute that he came to bring that into expression just like this building there were bricks that came together to make this building there was somebody had a vision somebody had a plan of the layout that he would go likewise that God has been assembly down through the ages a habitation for himself that he could dwell in there has been bricks there has been rocks there has been material that it already been here and he has been gathering that and forming his body down through the ages so the true church is brought forth here he was announcing it and it is brought forth the true church which is the body of Jesus Christ is brought forth after that of the Resurrection and the sending back of the Holy Ghost now in Leviticus 23 let's look at this just a moment in Leviticus 23 verse 15 we understand that these are the feasts of the Lord which speak of each one of them speak of the stages and the unfolding of that of the redemptive work clear to then of the regather of the Jews so when we look at this here recognizing that the wave sheaf had been waved that Jesus Christ himself was the firstfruits from among them who slept he was that wave sheet that that was that which come to maturity he was waved over the people how the day of Pentecost it was him the son of man that was being waved over the people remember they were disheartened they were scattered they were going right back to what they always had done but you see the call of the word upon their life they you know to them they didn't know what to do but remember God is the one that knows how to assemble his people together he began to reveal himself in his resurrection power it began to call them together and it brought them to a place to where God could bring them into that which he had promised I will build my church now notice this here in Leviticus 23 verse 15 it said you shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering seven Sabbath's shall be complete even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall be a number 50 days and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord remember when Jesus arose they work he was gathered together with them for forty days is that right and then remember they had a Sabbath day's journey to get back to Jerusalem and there they were they came back gathered back to Jerusalem and on the day of Pentecost not just to where it would fall in the calendar but what God Himself identified in keeping true to his own word he was no longer going to be a tight but now the an attack was going to come now want you to watch this here how that they would bring this this sheaf and it says in verse 26 let me read it again even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall you number fifty days and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord and ye shall bring out of your habitations to wave loads of 210th deals they shall be a fine flower they shall be bacon with leaven they are the firstfruits unto the Lord now notice the way sheep that was plucked up a type of Christ there is no leaven to be offered with that it was it was that of a of a grouping of of the the week that were brought together has sheets that were raised up and they were waved but here you find that what is to be waived is loaves of bread its grain that has come to maturity it is grain that has been ground to find flour and they had eleven and they bake those wave loads why it's showing that in Christ there is no leaven but in the church there is still eleven come on now it's the same way in your life there's a part of your life when you've really been born again by the Spirit of God in your soul there is no leaven but we still pack around this leaven thing is that right we still have leaven in the Church of the Living God it's this thing right here that gets on other people's nerves and people get on this thing's nerves is that right what who can who can bring this all together who could do and who would think to bring a bunch of people who are so different makeups our temperaments our viewpoints and all those things who could bring this together and bring it all under one head one uniting there's no one could do this but Jesus Christ himself Edie you say paradox let me just say like this not only is the universal body of Jesus Christ around the world of paradox not only is it a paradox within every state and city it is a paradox within every local assembly no glory be to God so now look at the forming of these two wave laws we are to be the first fruits endowed that by the Spirit of God now notice when we look at this here in the scriptures in verse 6 of Acts chapter 1 here says in the scripture when they were come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the world so it's the witness of the Holy Ghost through our lives it's not us packing the message it's the Holy Ghost in us packing the message amen glory be to God you know the reality it comes down to it you know you may not be able to preach a sermon you may not even feel like I don't even feel like I can put certain things together but that's not what God's are asking you to do just do what God's asking you to do let your life be a witness because your life can preach sermons brother it means more I don't care how eloquent how much that a man could put together it is the preaching of the gospel through a life that is surrendered unto God that real thunder against the devil is lives that are yielded to we're just a way that those lives conduct themselves and live and they express that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's real thunder against the devil's camp brother it's thousands of voices voices that hunger out purity voices that Thunder out godliness voices that plunder out holiness Oh glory may our lives be like that that was spoken of the house of Jason in the book of Acts they turned this city upside down glory be to God you realize it's like how brother Branham would put it back in perspective one man that gets on fire with the Holy Ghost will do more for a church than a multitude of revivals one man that gets on fire with God a revival all it takes is one that's all it takes and you know what you don't gotta wait on nobody else you can say right here Lord right here let me be the revival Lord now think of this when we look at it you know they they are spoken to in verse nine and it would mention to them and when they were spoken they were while they were beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men by them stood by them in white apparel which also said you men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven evidently they need a little bit of stimulation in the right way they were so an hour I mean they had walked with him for forty days and they're standing there in gazing now you know think of it here it would be natural for them to gaze and to look at this to where all of a sudden here the way that the very there was space that begin to come between his feet and the earth they were gazing into watts now remember it wasn't so much that they hadn't seen miracles they had seen miracle after miracle but every miracle that they witnessed even when he would appear right there in their myths when they were gathered in the room even when here he was on the bank and they were fishing you know everywhere he would come and and they would turn up and or he would turn up they would come around this way here he would be they were there as a place with it where he not only instructed them but they saw the miracles and the same resurrected Lord Jesus Christ but evidently they were looking a little bit too long so what would the angel stand they were telling them you're not just to talk about the message you've got to get under the blood they were letting them know yeah it's glorious yes it's wonderful but you need to follow the orders you've been commanded to receive the Holy Ghost glory be to God so they returned the Bible says unto Jerusalem from the mount called all of it which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey now in verse 1 of Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place they were not even born again yet how could they be in one chord one Accord in one place well first of all if they happen to bend the holy ghost would have never come because the holy ghost who have not come where there's dissension and that's a responsibility that comes on our lives in our homes in the churches and so forth just like even in a meeting my mama you know and sometimes you can get in meetings and and I'll tell you what there can be divisions that come right there in that meeting you get different perspective it ought not be there ought to be one objective and that is that Jesus Christ wouldn't be glorified I think that ought to be every objective even you know and coming into a meeting we're not trying to have somebody see things rise there is a liberty inside of this word is to exalt Jesus Christ we're not here to exalt the idea of any man because this message is not man's ideas these are not the thoughts of William Branham this is the thoughts of God that have been expressed to us in this hour oh god help us and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind he filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it's set upon each of them God knows where to find you and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance God was bringing them together the revelation was bringing them together that he himself might step in the midst of them that he himself now think of this that he might assemble the wave sheaf now assembling the graves the the grains in wave lows not separate pieces but one living organism one body you see what he's doing now the scripture goes on and think of this with the bread it speaks in first Corinthians 10 verse 15 Paul said I speak as two wise men judging what I say the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one now remember in the scriptures here let's look at this the partaking of the Living bread because remember as Jesus would tell him here in John 632 he said Moses gave you not the bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven now once you remember when they came out of Egypt the purpose of coming out of Egypt was that they might go into their inheritance God knew that they only had provision for so long but this is where God would take an opportunity to make himself known among his people that I'm your provider and mana remember how that mana it will it would fall there and they would go out and gather that mana now think of this many of them Paul wrote event like this how many of them eight of the mana they ate or they drank from the spiritual rock but yet when it came time to go take the inheritance they said we can do it so though they were eating the manna and they were drinking from the spiritual rock but they weren't receiving strength from it you know if you could be in Joshua and Caleb spent and when they themselves would have had that manner that they gathered they would say praise God God provided for us right here gods provided for us all along I tell you God has sent to us just what we need Caleb what do you think it's gonna be like what I'm gonna tell you what I think it's gonna be like I'm gonna tell you just as he provided bread for today they'll be bread for the day when we get ready to close what do you mean put it in terms for right now the same quickening power that has come down and redeemed your soul it will continue to quicken you and quicken you and quicken you until you stand on the other side it's living bread of life so this bread that we're speaking of just like when we take communion here it starts out as one piece of unleavened bread to show that in the body of Jesus Christ there should be no eleven because there is no leaven in him is that right but then it is broken he meant his body it was broken for us he gave of his life that we might receive of that life that also there is within the blood now when we look at this he goes on to say but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world so we're talking about life here we're talking about a person here this is the bread of God then said they unto Him Lord evermore give us this bread and Jesus said I am the bread of life they were looking around where is this at and he announced to him I am that bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger but he that believeth on me shall never thirst what is it saying this bread brother is a satisfying portion it won't just hold you over from Thursday to Sunday and then it might keep you next year when this prayer has been partaking of I'm talking about Christ I'm talking about the word brother will it moves into your life you are satisfied the devil can put everything that he wants to put in front of you you have found that which has ministered life to you hallelujah you'll never thirst again glory be to God I am that Bread of Life your father's did eat manna in the wilderness they're dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am that Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I give for the life of the world amen Oh glory I think of this here Paul in writing this here here he would write in the exhortation - even to that of Ephesians the same thought he says in verse 4 there is one body one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all and once you look at this verse but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ it's not something we earned it's not what we can merit this gift of Christ is the bread of life it's his life come on now they had been taken remember they forfeited that life there in Eden but Jesus when he came he stood and declared he said I am come to bear witness to the truth and Pilate said what is truth right truth is not a doctrine truth is not a sentence truth is a person I am the way the truth and the life amen is talking about the word this is the bread of life it becomes strength to our life we just don't come to church as people and say well I wonder if when I come here if I feel good when I leave you may not you may not feel good but there's one thing about it we've got confidence in the Living God that word that's coming forth it's changing our lives even when we don't seem like it's working brother it's having an effect you know why we're not just here but we can get with that we just we can receive we are here to be strengthened by this word in this hour we are making ready for a translation notice every one of us is under every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ Paul would write in picking up here in 1st Corinthians 12:1 he said now concerning spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you ignorant you know that you were Gentiles carried away with these dumb idols even as you were led wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the Lord but by or that word is in the Holy Ghost nobody can call him Lord but by the indwelling of his life you see what he's dealing with this is the foundation of every believer this is the foundation of all workings in the body is that Jesus Christ is the lord of that life that's the foundation that's not an option he must be the life amen it must be declared in that life he is the Lord why because about him being Lord it recalls to us to relinquish our ideas and we're going to have him it causes us to relinquish our opinions and we have them what has to be there's got to be something greater there's got to be something greater to where he is Lord then we've got the right beginning we've got the right headship then in order to be able to submit ourselves to one another in the body of Jesus Christ now notice in verse 4 Paul would were right it could go on there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit there's differences of administration's but the same Lord there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal four to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these notice how Paul brings it all together but all these workers that one and the selfsame as he will that is not anything just as nuts as the measure of the grace the grace of God the gift of Christ is ministered to us his life it is the same in how that he works through his body there is not one remember it did not say that one obtained faith or one obtained a gift of healing but it says - one is given this - one is given a gift of healing to another the working of miracles to another prophecy and it goes on but who is it it is God that is dividing this among the body it's the Spirit of God now listen we understand there's been a lot of false and yet listen in even in many instances there and there's been the real genuine Spirit of God but moving upon a false vessel but that don't do away with it it would be just like if somebody gave you a counterfeit hundred-dollar bill I'm sure you wouldn't turn down if somebody put out another hundred-dollar bill you might beat him to death to get it because you don't know you know there's real ones out there that's the same way that it is with the working of the gifts of God there's a genuine and this is where as brother Branham would put it like this he said that once he sent as you are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ he said it can fall on this one tonight and it may never fall on this one again and may fall over here and it may fall over here you see God just moves around the body with these nine spiritual gifts but what's worth it is all for the edifying of his body now notice on to every one of us let me read that again in Ephesians 4 verse 7 unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ Paul would write in Romans 12 verse 3 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly sometimes we need to be sobered up and this is this is a sobering thought according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith we didn't deal it God dealt it to us God released it to us what's he doing he's unfolding he's releasing a part of himself to bring his people together he's unfolding is of his life and it moves too quick in that life bringing that life into him notice it goes on for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of another I know it's very simple but my feet is not if my feet don't do any good if anything attached to this body it don't do any good of the body don't do no good for the feet matter of fact the Fenian attached to the body guess what happens to him it cut off from the supply so the feet are only a part of the body the feet are not the body neither is the hands the body it's all a part of the body and how Paul under the leading of the Holy Spirit would show that the body think of it that he would show that the working of Christ and how then it would be one body that it would be Christ that has brought this body together and that there are as he said differences in administration there's differences in there's diversity there's different workings even among the gifts he would talk about the differences that would be there now look at this God even wrote it in the heavens and the stars every star itself is different and yet they're similar that's where he wrote his first Bible he wrote the first Bible even the constellations one star didn't get to say you know I don't want to be and I don't want to be in Orion's church I mean I don't want to be in Orion's constellation I don't want to be over there with pleadings I don't want to be over here no it was in that whence God had ordained and you know one star ISM doesn't give off a Ryan but it's a collection of stars together but go to present Orion is that right the seven stars reflect Orion or you estimate now it's even that when we see the different ones in the constellation you know what that is when you look up there it's always been hard for me to see them you know they got the Big Dipper and a Little Dipper and I'd look at them and say see what you see it yeah yeah I see what I see yeah yeah I see it where's it at right there no it's over here okay yeah yeah I see it yeah right there now helped when I got an app on my phone I could put it up there and kind of see it you know and then there are certain nights you could see the Big Dipper and other times the Little Dipper and things like that but you understand when we look at all of that every one of those stars have a Mane we don't know them but they don't mean they don't got a name every one of them even when their position that they never put themselves there they covered even how the Prophet would describe those stars they were scattered out there just blown right off of his hand but notice he knew just exactly where to stop and position each one of them so it would tell a story every one of them would be a declaration as a part within the body so the whole of the stars is like that the representation of the body of Jesus Christ remember he told Abraham at first he said count can you count the number of the sands of the sea I can't do it he said then when he took Abraham the next time he asked him to look up to the stars he showed that he would take Abraham's seed that royal seed from the dest to the stars a man even translate us and meaning that every one of them has a significant part in the body I hope this is real clear pom would go on and write just just a few more moments here in verse twelve of first Corinthians twelve these scriptures were familiar with but I just just wanting to lay this in for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many make how Paul and see would he would write this here it's him it's it's Jesus Christ working in and through his body he has assembled his broad body and brought it forth as he said I will build my church which would be his body which is that of his wife his bride and he would work his life would be reflected through the church he would be reflected through his body one body not not a divided bodies let me just say this very clearly when we're reading here in the scripture as you see it continues to move a move on down here whereas we've been looking at this here's one body that is around the world the body of Jesus Christ now listen let me just be very clear to be in the body of Jesus Christ as we just read it's not anything a person can join you've got to be baptized in by the Holy Ghost himself he calls you justifies you sanctifies you and then he inducts you into his body and it's one body with one objective one motive one purpose and that is Jesus Christ it's not an idea it's not it it's not somebody's thought it's him and just as the whole body that would be gathered around the world then as it keeps on moving down to where you get then to the local bodies to where that every local body is to be one as well that's right just as it would be even in cities even in states but remember Paul would write very clearly on this right here unity is to be with Jesus Christ be in the center here Paul would be very clear you do not compromise the gospel for unity the gospel is not to be compromised that's why the striving together is for V faith there should be unity in that where God would establish their of a local body let me just say it to you like this that every local body a local body is not the work of a man God will use a man God will send a man into an area but that local body it is that which God has put a burden on that man's heart the man who is standing there has the pastor may not even been the man that got used to sin in there but God don't have to use the same man he sends in there because he's got apostles that can go first come on now this is God's working in his body there's got to be a word taken and then a people a church established and then God would put a pastor there a watchman and in steel all parts of the ministry that work together for one achievement and that's the kingdom of Almighty God hello glory this is why that Paul would go on to write in Corinthians 1227 in the latter part here he says now you are the body of Christ and members in particular that particular means you've got an allotment you've been allotted and a portion there's an inheritance in Jesus Christ just like Israel when they were coming into the land remember this was the Ministry of Joshua to minister to them their inheritance to vie to them their lot their portion and we have that portion in Jesus Christ that's what the gospel comes to make known that you were always a part of him that's what takes a hold of our life it brings about where he moves her faith to rise within our hearts to believe that he included me Calvary was a manifestation to me that I was on his mind and the Holy Ghost has come to witness that I was included in that sacrifice that I have been included in Redemption that's what the Holy Ghost comes to do Joshua comes to minister to us our inheritance and he does it by and through his word and they just and they just closed in this part of it with one body seeing how God would bring a body together let me just skip to something just for a moment here and come down into another scripture here it's just frozen if you go go to Exodus 25 verse 8 here is where Israel comes out of the land God brings them out of the land and remember the first thing that's mentioned to Moses are not Moses but to to to to Pharaoh let my people go let him come out into the wilderness three days journey that they may hold a feast and Pharaoh resisted that but the objective was not just run to come into the wilderness God wanted his people to come out and worship Him there was an inheritance that they were being called to they couldn't stay in Egypt and receive this inheritance they had to be called out of there who could walk into a nation that is the most powerful nation in the world who could walk in there and absolutely separate a group of people and bring them out God God Scott one man separated unto himself hallelujah he got Moses separated in his hand to her Moses was delivered of Moses Moses was not gonna look by his ideas because his ideas only produce one dead stinking Egyptian you see man's ideas only produces dead church members it does not bring about the body of Jesus Christ this is not a social gathering that's not what the Church of the Living God is it is Christ himself coming down and declaring Redemption to Haaretz that men have been so shackled that darkness but Jubilee sounds to that life and it closed it in to the Liberty the Spirit of God is present to proclaim Liberty [Applause] men's ideas leave it in bondage but plumb miracle come out of her amen there's an inheritance this message it was a message that let him know you've got an inheritance they crossed through the red sea and as soon as they got through the Red Sea here is Moses up in the vision I want you to just I want to just leave you with these words he says let them make me my sanctuary that I may dwell among them left them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among it truly has to be his work but it'll never come forth without hearts with wood they have a willingness according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it think about it brother Brandon would read this text and what house will you build me a message I've listened to that one well countless number of times but even over months just listening to it going back through it he would read this part where Stephen would speak Stephen would speak about that tabernacle that house that Solomon building and he would say in verse 48 of Acts 7 howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the Prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me I want you to think of these words this is where I'm ending up here tonight these words not only pertain to the universal body of Jesus Christ but if we leave it just to a universal body we miss it what house will you build me a local body of believers heaven is my throne earth is my footstool what house will you build me say at the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all of these things you know we can dwell we can be right here in the same building but we want to be in the building Christ Jesus that's the body that's the building of God is to be in that building is to be in that body and when the question comes forth what house will you build me it didn't just ask and said what house Paul will you building he asked Paul that question but then he comes down he says Brian what house will you build me Paul what house were you building there what house will you build me he's asking a question what house will you build me blueheart will build you this church he said but my hands I provided all this material but what God's asking for his surrendered hearts surrendered lives lives that are yielded like ones when an announcement was made and you know David there begin to be assembling a material even with Solomon that begin to me material and what was all that material coming together why are we here tonight it's because of one purpose it's not to build an earthly Kingdom it's for the work of the kingdom of God it's being one with him and the truly being one with him it'll reflect with love for one another being of one spirit in one mind as I listen to that if you haven't listened that in a while I'd encourage you to do that and some of the things that we'll be looking at here what house were you bill me very short message twenty seven minutes brother branham takes and he speaks before brother Perry preaches and he just you know they're gonna dedicate that Tabernacle there and you hear brother branham's voice you can just hear him he said I'm so happy today I'm so happy the reason brother branham was so happy there had been people that followed him out there and brother branham's seen him where their kids were just out riding bikes on Sunday people were starting to get loose and lacks a reclining of the Spirit they didn't have no place to go brother brems said there weren't even any place for my family to go to church you know what he was talking about he wasn't just talking about a place to go to church he was talking about a place that could take the full gospel that this message could be proclaimed in fully where there's no parts of it resisted come on now but where Jesus Christ is fully welcomed and to st. Cal when brother Brandon you could just hear it in his heart he declares it but you're hearing in his heart he says now he said I don't have to drive clear back to Jeffersonville to preach when God put something on my heart I can come right here to this pulpit and deliver that message I wonder tonight we've gotta let brother Branham look over the banister of time and see little outpost local churches oh my let's come up underneath this message where the message that God delivered in this generation is going forth it's producing a bride for Jesus Christ hey man it's assembling those parts that have been laid out into what one body every local body is one body like a platoon that's part of the army of the Living God glory be to God this is why as we're thankful to Almighty God for His grace and His mercy to be able to deliver the message that he's given to us in this hour and brother branham wouldn't make that statement he would say and we talking to the people right there we are a body of Christ then I could say that tonight we are not the body of Christ we are a body of Christ we are one body is to have one objective one goal oh my are there some times where there's differences of ideas and differences of opinions sure why because you still got the fine flour how do you know when it's fine flour it's sticky you put your hand in it and it sticks to you fine flour you're to make the wave loaves out of fine flour but thanks be to God there's green grain that has come up went through the process there is that of resurrection power that has brought forth bread amen that same life is now reflected in a body of believers a local body once you just to think of this tonight God just didn't call you here just to sit I wish I could preach them more here God called you because you've got a purpose me me what am I to do what can I possibly do can anybody tell me the name of the little woman who cleaned out the barn where the white moody got saved that night so you know the name of the white moody but you don't know the name of the woman who cleaned out the barn but she got a burden on her heart to clean out a barn brother Aaron to get rid of where there was horse manure and everything else she had a burden to clear that out that there would be a meeting there God put that burden on her heart she did want her part in it I was not what many would look like and say but that was a glorious part no it was it was it was a stinky part in one way there was a lot of dirt and grime and everything else was in it but you know what that wasn't on her focus what God put her on her heart to do she was willing to do it was her part butthole how vital that part was how many souls were one to the kingdom of God by the white Moody's ministry because of one one that yielded to what God put on their heart to do as a local body thank God for the body we were not isolated we are part of the body of Jesus Christ around the world we don't ever want an attitude of us for no more we need one another we need each and every member of the bride of Jesus Christ we need every gift that God has provided that's right they don't just need a pastor we need the Evangelist come on now we need the teachers they met and prophets let's a modern-day preacher we we need every part of the body of Jesus Christ we need every 9 spiritual gift we need every heart that is dedicated and looking and that word is reflected through their heart there are things that God puts upon your heart to do nobody else may never know about it but after all you're not doing it for recognition you're doing it as unto the Lord and Paul would write this as we started striving together as one body for what the faith sometimes I just gotta stop sometimes it may not look like you could drive by here and you see one of the brothers out the lawn where you say I don't look very spiritual but what happens if somebody didn't do that that's a reflection on us come on now a house it's not taken care of and abandoned you see all those little parts right there it may not seem spiritual but it's all part of the local body of Jesus Christ for one objective for the kingdom of God oh my let them make me a sanctuary let it be a place let our hearts be a place that he's welcome everytime we come together here let it be a place where he's welcome he said you know what I can't wait oh my they're coming together all mob hey they just welcomed me and they just you know they let me be myself I want Jesus to look forward to Thursday night I want Jesus to look forward to Sunday morning is that how you feel I don't want to say oh no not that church again Thursday lord have mercy no no I want him to say I got this one Circle Jesus why is Thursday Circle oh let me tell you the reality is are we better than anybody oh I'm glad he meets with all of his children we're not the only ones that have church on Thursday night but I do want one thing when he circled Thursday I want it to be because he loves to come here he's welcome how is he welcome let us make him a sanctuary let our lives be a place where the word is delivered or it might cut us in my correctness but remember as stones are no good unless they're shaped he comes to shape us mold us may our lives be found as a place that is receptive to him miss pray Heavenly Father Lord this thought tonight Lord God that you've laid on my heart of one body this is not something that would be new to our hearts Lord but I pray that tonight that Lord that for every one of us even as we revisit this part of it for Lord
