[40:37] Amen to be gathered together
[40:39] Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:41] Christ
[40:42] and what a privilege it is that he's
[40:43] made a way that we could surrender
[40:46] you know that's the greatest thing that
[40:48] that we can ever do is to surrender and
[40:50] submit ourselves in his presence
[40:53] it just
[40:54] whatever the word is speaking to us it's
[40:56] just like when it came to the very first
[40:58] miracle of Canaan they ran out of wine
[41:01] and
[41:02] Mary said to him she said whatever he
[41:05] says to you just do it
[41:08] all they had to do was go fill up
[41:10] the pots with water
[41:13] yeah it wasn't their business to change
[41:14] it to wine
[41:16] he's the one that would take care of
[41:17] that
[41:19] it's not our business to part the waters
[41:21] he's the one that'll take care of that
[41:23] if we just we just step into the water
[41:26] the water's apart
[41:28] amen and what we have need of here
[41:30] tonight and I think of it as young
[41:32] people it's so good to see each and
[41:34] every one of you and that's what this
[41:36] service is for amen that God would just
[41:39] speak to your lives personally
[41:42] amen and God's God's mindful
[41:45] you know I think of when brother Branham
[41:47] hear the Holy Spirit as he spoke to him
[41:50] and when he received that that
[41:51] visitation of the Lord he said I
[41:53] remember what he said concerning you
[41:55] young people
[41:57] and this message this word was intended
[42:00] for our lives
[42:01] amen it and I'll tell you one thing I
[42:03] can stand here and I know there's others
[42:05] that could as well and I think it was 19
[42:08] years old when God got a hold of my life
[42:10] now there was a start in my life but it
[42:13] came to a full surrender when I was 19
[42:14] years old and I can tell you my life has
[42:18] never been the same
[42:19] older's been tests there's been trousers
[42:21] been ups and downs but in it all God is
[42:23] faithful amen the only regret that I
[42:26] have is that I never surrendered fully
[42:28] years before that
[42:30] but I'll tell you God is Mindful and all
[42:33] you have to do while the words coming
[42:34] forth just just move right in the word
[42:36] when God is speaking to you just say
[42:38] Amen just say yes Lord being unto me
[42:41] what whatever it might be just go ahead
[42:43] and enter right in because God is
[42:45] mindful of your needs and amen and we're
[42:48] just we're privileged to be able to be
[42:50] here and I just appreciate the different
[42:51] ones as you've brought your the young
[42:54] people that have come here and traveled
[42:56] to be here and we just want to turn our
[42:57] attention to the word of the lord we had
[43:00] a wonderful service this morning we're
[43:01] just expecting more amen from the Lord
[43:04] here this evening amen we just want to
[43:06] invite brother Wayne to go ahead and
[43:07] come on out and just ask him to take his
[43:10] Liberty I believe God has great things
[43:11] in store for us because God is just that
[43:15] kind of God there is no other God like
[43:18] him amen he so when he shows up he shows
[43:22] out when God comes on the scene and
[43:25] there is no limitations and so tonight
[43:27] we we just settle that in our heart
[43:29] there's no limiters on the power of God
[43:33] there's no Regulators on the power of
[43:35] God God is here to do for you
[43:38] amen more than you can even think but
[43:41] he's able to move and he wants to how
[43:43] many believe that

[49:40] you have your Bibles we'd like to turn
[49:42] into the scripture Into the Book of
[49:44] Psalms if we can 103 Psalms 103
[49:49] . we'd like to read the first
[49:51] few verses of that chapter it's
[49:53] beautiful reading
[49:56] Psalms 103 and verse 1.
[50:06] bless the Lord O my soul
[50:08] yeah and all that is within me
[50:11] bless His holy name
[50:14] bless the Lord O my soul
[50:17] and forget not all his benefits
[50:20] who forgiveth all thine iniquity in who
[50:23] healeth all Zion diseases
[50:28] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[50:30] and who craneth thee with loving
[50:32] kindness and tender Mercy
[50:34] who satisfy thy mouth with good things
[50:37] so that the youth is renewed like the
[50:40] eagles
[50:41] amen we ask the Lord to bless the
[50:43] reading of his words you can be seated
[50:44] tonight I want to speak to you again
[50:47] tonight for just a little bit upon this
[50:49] subject of it is a spirit it is
[50:53] a spirit I know that's a rather an odd
[50:57] text to take but I want to speak to you
[50:59] a little bit tonight about it is a
[51:02] spirit some time ago I was listening to
[51:04] a tape it was Jesus Christ is saying
[51:06] yesterday forever sometime preaching the
[51:09] 1950s I was actually in a in a holding
[51:12] meetings in India when it happened to me
[51:14] and I was sitting in a in a hotel room
[51:16] and I was praying over some things and I
[51:19] was listening to a tape and and like we
[51:21] do many times and while I was sitting
[51:23] there listening to that sermon brother
[51:25] Benham started coming toward the end of
[51:27] his service and when he did he started
[51:28] uh in the gift of discernment and he
[51:31] started talking to people and how he
[51:33] always does you know in in those
[51:34] Discerning lines and he started telling
[51:36] them their names and where they were
[51:37] from and what they come from and what
[51:40] kind of sickness was upon them and he
[51:42] starts doing this well I'm just sitting
[51:44] here enjoying my morning listening to
[51:46] this tape and but just out like out of
[51:49] nowhere just like it was my own mind I
[51:51] could I could I had a thought in this
[51:53] song aunt said well he he already knew
[51:56] that about that person
[51:57] I thought well that's kind of odd
[51:59] and then I'm listening and he discerns
[52:02] another person
[52:03] and just out of the blue something says
[52:05] to me well someone told him about them
[52:08] and then again he discerns another
[52:10] person and something says to me well the
[52:13] information was on the prayer card that
[52:15] that's what that's what just happened
[52:17] and just as it started happening on the
[52:19] tape brother Branham said something and
[52:21] he says something in this line that's
[52:23] not exact but something in this line and
[52:25] he says now when Jesus was there
[52:29] in Capernaum he said if the works that
[52:32] had been done in you
[52:33] that would be done here he said if the
[52:36] works have been done among you would
[52:37] have been done in Sodom Gomorrah they
[52:38] would be standing today and the Bible
[52:41] actually tells us there was many things
[52:42] he couldn't do because of the spirit of
[52:44] unbelief
[52:45] and when he says that brother Graham
[52:48] says that he said now something along
[52:50] these lines he said now I rebuke that
[52:52] Spirit of doubt in the name of Jesus
[52:54] Christ off that congregation it was
[52:56] there and the minute he said that the
[52:58] thing left the room it left my mind and
[53:00] just as soon as that left my mind the
[53:03] spirit of the Lord spoke to me he said
[53:04] see it's just a spirit
[53:06] and and when he said that I realized
[53:09] right then what is happening to people
[53:12] when they're listening to tapes or when
[53:14] they're studying the message of the hour
[53:16] and they come up with these ideas of how
[53:18] that there's something uh wrong or
[53:20] there's something being said there
[53:22] that's been prompt or been set up see
[53:24] that it actually is a spirit because see
[53:26] as a Holy Ghost Field person uh my my
[53:29] soul be sealed amen uh I I wasn't let me
[53:33] just put it this way if the spirit had
[53:35] spoke like that someone listening to
[53:37] that would have thought it was them they
[53:39] would have actually thought I'm thinking
[53:41] that but but I'm certain I wasn't
[53:43] thinking that it wasn't my fault at all
[53:45] and had I received that thought it would
[53:48] have been a spirit of doubt that would
[53:49] have come in my life and then cursed my
[53:52] life because of the spirit of Doubt
[53:54] doubting what the word of God did but
[53:56] see God revealed it to me because I was
[53:59] actually in that meetings was praying
[54:01] about what's what's happening with some
[54:02] of the people why are they uh getting so
[54:05] discouraged with the message and and and
[54:07] it struck my heart because it's it's
[54:08] actually a spirit now if you start
[54:11] realizing these things are spirits it
[54:14] changes everything see not everything
[54:16] that speaks to you is you not everything
[54:19] that comes through your mind is you
[54:21] sometimes you have to discern what is
[54:25] speaking to you and what is saying
[54:27] things to you and you don't have to own
[54:29] everything you think it's not actually
[54:32] your thought it's a spirit that comes
[54:34] through your mind but you don't have to
[54:36] receive it let me tell you like this one
[54:38] man a guy comes to brother random and
[54:40] repents to him he says brother random I
[54:42] was sitting there thinking so and so and
[54:43] so about you and I'm sorry I love you I
[54:46] think you're a man of God and I'm sorry
[54:47] I was thinking that and brother bam said
[54:49] no he said actually it wasn't you he
[54:52] said it was the man sitting in front of
[54:53] you that was thinking that you were just
[54:55] picking up on his thoughts amen and how
[54:57] relieved the guy was to realize that it
[55:00] really wasn't his thought it was the
[55:02] devil in the room amen and it was just
[55:05] passing through his mind and you see the
[55:08] quicker you can understand that the
[55:10] spirit of the devil will think through
[55:12] your mind just like it was you but it
[55:14] really ain't you see if you was riding
[55:16] down the road and and there was a guy
[55:18] sitting next to you in the car he said
[55:20] stop and Rob this bank right here well
[55:22] you just look at the guy and say you're
[55:24] stupid get out of my car I'm not gonna
[55:26] I'm not you I'm not gonna let you ride
[55:28] in my car and try to talk me into
[55:30] robbing a bank but you'll ride down the
[55:32] road and let them thoughts move through
[55:34] your mind and you never open up the door
[55:37] and say get out but I think this is the
[55:39] season when the when the Church of the
[55:42] Living God becomes into a spiritual
[55:44] discernment to understand amen that not
[55:47] everything you think belongs to you not
[55:49] everything you think is coming from God
[55:52] but it is a spirit now if we say to you
[55:55] it's a spirit that's a a pretty broad
[55:57] statement but let's just narrow it down
[55:59] a little bit it's a demon spirit
[56:02] amen it is a demon Spirit now if we say
[56:05] to you something is a demon now you say
[56:07] what is a demon brother Wayne a demon is
[56:09] a devil a demon or a devil and it comes
[56:13] from the same word it's called a
[56:15] Tormentor a devil is a Tormentor isn't
[56:18] that something amen the Devil is a
[56:20] Tormentor I'm gonna call him all kinds
[56:22] of bad names tonight amen but the Devil
[56:24] is a Tormentor amen and the thing about
[56:27] the devil is he's not only a Tormentor
[56:29] amen but he's also a liar so do you know
[56:32] the devil will actually torment a real
[56:35] Christian somebody who is really a
[56:37] Christian on the inside bought sealed
[56:39] saved amen delivered unto God Amen but
[56:42] the devil is always trying to destroy
[56:45] your peace and destroy your life so he
[56:47] will actually eat at you but he's just a
[56:50] Tormentor or spirit and because he is a
[56:53] liar he does not let the truth get in
[56:55] the way of his tormenting you he will
[56:58] lie to you about you to torment your
[57:01] life I can't tell you you're not a child
[57:03] of God he'll tell you you're not a part
[57:05] of this or you're not a seed of God but
[57:07] see he don't care to lie to you to
[57:09] torment you to make you believe well the
[57:12] message is true but it's for somebody
[57:14] else the message there's a Rapture but
[57:16] it's for somebody else see he don't care
[57:18] to lie to you but it's a spirit and you
[57:21] ought to call him out on it and say that
[57:23] you're just a devil you're a Tormentor
[57:25] you're a spirit a Tormentor many times
[57:29] brother Madden said even people who were
[57:31] saved he said could be tormented
[57:33] sometimes even to the place of insanity
[57:36] but they're yet a converted person can
[57:39] you can you believe that someone could
[57:41] totally lose their mind be out of their
[57:44] right mind but their soul completely
[57:46] saved amen that's why sometimes when you
[57:49] suffer with nervousness and you suffer
[57:51] with fear or you surface was suffer with
[57:54] some kind of anxiety and Satan would
[57:56] like to tell you that it has something
[57:57] to do with your Christianity when you
[58:00] can be a total complete Christian but
[58:03] Satan is doing his best to torment you
[58:05] anyhow amen but you must see that it is
[58:09] a spirit it is a spirit now in the
[58:12] message of demonology 1953 brother Adam
[58:15] said there's a channel right here he
[58:17] says that there's a channel and he said
[58:18] I don't usually tell this before the
[58:20] people he said I got a lot of secrecy in
[58:22] my own life of course between God and I
[58:24] but look there's a channel like this and
[58:27] this is where Mortals live in and it's a
[58:30] conglomeration of deity and Blackness
[58:32] and sin and every once in a while you'll
[58:34] see a little spot of light
[58:37] and Jesus said ye are the light of the
[58:39] Hill
[58:40] said on the hill now don't light a
[58:42] candle and put a bush over the
[58:44] Christians in this conglomeration of
[58:46] dimension of Mortals now he says we're
[58:48] going to go this way downward he said
[58:50] the next is going to be the souls of
[58:52] unjust who died not knowing god then the
[58:55] second realm will be demons and the
[58:57] Third Realm of Trinity of Hell will be
[58:59] unjust Souls demons and then hell itself
[59:02] so he said from this Mortal realm you're
[59:04] living in it's a conglomeration he said
[59:07] now there's going to be some lights in
[59:08] that conglomeration but if you start
[59:10] going downwards you're going to start
[59:11] going into lost souls and you're going
[59:13] to go into demons then you're going to
[59:15] go to hell he said but if you turn and
[59:17] go the other way he said there's three
[59:19] Realms as well he said the first of this
[59:22] is going to be the Holy Ghost the second
[59:23] will be Angels the third Will Be Heaven
[59:26] itself he said but see something is
[59:28] influencing you from one place or the
[59:31] other so every one of us in this middle
[59:33] channel is being influenced from one of
[59:35] these two places all of the time amen
[59:38] either you're influenced by God or your
[59:40] influenced by the devil now watch what
[59:42] the influence of them will do remember
[59:44] in the Bible when the the serpent amen
[59:47] he beguiled Eve now what he did is he
[59:49] got under the influence of the devil and
[59:52] he acted as an instrument of the devil
[59:54] but remember what happened to the guy
[59:56] remember when God cursed him he cast him
[59:59] to his belly upon the dust and remember
[1:00:02] he changed his bone structure that he
[1:00:04] could never rise again so the influence
[1:00:07] of Satan always cast down a person amen
[1:00:11] but the influence of the eagle gets a
[1:00:13] hold of an individual and takes him in
[1:00:15] the sky you can always know what is
[1:00:18] influencing you by what the attitudes
[1:00:20] you have is toward the word of God if
[1:00:23] it's the right direction if it's the
[1:00:25] right attitude amen faith will come into
[1:00:27] your heart and you'll rise up look every
[1:00:29] time in the scripture nearly every time
[1:00:31] that God comes he sustained upon your
[1:00:34] feet rise upon your feet the spirit of
[1:00:36] God always lifts the church in the power
[1:00:39] of God every time Satan comes I'm not
[1:00:42] worthy I can't do it I'm never going to
[1:00:45] make it I'm not able to do this there's
[1:00:47] no way I can do this see but the devil
[1:00:49] is a liar to begin with and he don't
[1:00:52] care to lie to you to tell you and
[1:00:54] torment your life and every time he
[1:00:57] speaks to you he is bringing you beneath
[1:01:01] the Privileges God gives you
[1:01:04] now I can show you in the scripture Amen
[1:01:06] in Revelation chapter 9 you look in the
[1:01:08] first verse and the Bible tells us that
[1:01:11] the fifth angel sounded I saw a star
[1:01:13] fall from Heaven under the Earth and
[1:01:15] unto him was given the key of the
[1:01:16] bottomless pit a star if this is
[1:01:18] speaking of end time now there's a star
[1:01:21] that falls out of Heaven a star out of
[1:01:24] heaven now think of this what or what is
[1:01:26] that a star out of heaven in Isaiah 14
[1:01:29] the 12th verse Isaiah said Thou Art
[1:01:31] fallen from heaven or Lucifer son of the
[1:01:33] morning how are thou cut down to the
[1:01:35] ground which thou did weaken the Nations
[1:01:37] for thou has said in thine heart I will
[1:01:39] send unto the heaven I will exalt my
[1:01:40] throne above the stars of God I will set
[1:01:43] upon the Mount of the congregation of
[1:01:44] the sides of North I will Ascend above
[1:01:46] the Heights and the clouds and I will be
[1:01:48] like the most high but yet thou shall be
[1:01:50] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[1:01:53] pit so Satan who was in a high place has
[1:01:57] fallen now the scripture Will Tell Us in
[1:01:59] Luke chapter 10 and verse 18 Jesus
[1:02:01] speaking to the disciples he said I
[1:02:03] behave held Satan falling like lightning
[1:02:07] I beheld Satan fallen from heaven like
[1:02:10] lightning now when did Satan fall from
[1:02:12] Heaven like lightning when God gave
[1:02:13] power to the disciples and he told him I
[1:02:16] give you power to tread upon the head of
[1:02:18] every scorpion upon every Power it
[1:02:20] wasn't just upon animals he was talking
[1:02:22] about it was upon the demons amen that
[1:02:25] had fallen from Heaven and the sons of
[1:02:28] God were being positioned back to
[1:02:30] receive what they had fallen from to
[1:02:32] begin with and it pushes the devil out
[1:02:35] of those heavenly places now the prophet
[1:02:37] of God said the power of the church
[1:02:38] moving forward upset the kingdom of Hell
[1:02:41] or of Satan and seen it dropped from its
[1:02:43] places now the scripture will also tell
[1:02:46] us in Revelation chapter 9 that there
[1:02:48] was a king over the bottomless pit who
[1:02:51] in the hebrew's tongue was abaddam but
[1:02:53] in the Greek tongue is abilone and it
[1:02:56] actually means amen not the place of
[1:02:59] Destruction but the angel of Destruction
[1:03:01] it's actually speaking of the angel that
[1:03:05] brings destruction aside from the abyss
[1:03:08] or the place where he lives now this is
[1:03:10] this this the reality is that the great
[1:03:14] Fallen Angel Satan has come into this
[1:03:18] age like a roaring lion
[1:03:20] and he's seeking whom he may devour or
[1:03:23] to influence that's why the scripture
[1:03:25] says in the book of second Thessalonians
[1:03:28] and chapter 2 this is the age of the
[1:03:31] great Falling Away Now isn't it amazing
[1:03:34] when a fallen angel comes into this
[1:03:37] Dimension there is a falling away of
[1:03:40] people because they're being influenced
[1:03:42] by a fallen angel now all you'd have to
[1:03:45] do is look into the heavens and see what
[1:03:47] happened to two-thirds of the angels
[1:03:50] that believe the lie brother Ben said
[1:03:52] watch he drawed them out of heaven with
[1:03:55] his tail not the tail like a dog wagging
[1:03:58] a tail the lie that he told the lie that
[1:04:02] Satan told to the angels brought them
[1:04:04] out a fallen angel caused a fall to
[1:04:08] happen Out of Heaven now he met in the
[1:04:11] last days this same devil has come into
[1:04:13] this age to cause a fall among the
[1:04:16] Church of the Living God he's come to
[1:04:18] bring her he's come to bring a tale that
[1:04:21] he told but here's the beauty of this do
[1:04:23] you know that Up In Heaven There was a
[1:04:24] third of the Angels who didn't believe
[1:04:26] the lie of the devil and they kept their
[1:04:28] positions with God do you know those
[1:04:31] angels the anointing that was on those
[1:04:33] angels are the same anointing that has
[1:04:36] failed on the Church of the Living God
[1:04:38] in the last day that we did not believe
[1:04:41] the lie of the devil to begin with and
[1:04:44] will not believe that lie tonight amen
[1:04:46] because we are anointed with the spirit
[1:04:49] of the eagle Amen to withstand every lie
[1:04:53] that the devil told he said preacher how
[1:04:55] do you withstand the age that we're
[1:04:57] living how do you do it amen it is the
[1:04:59] eagle anointing or the revelation of God
[1:05:02] that will help you withstand this Fallen
[1:05:05] anointing
[1:05:06] the influence amen we are anointed to
[1:05:11] not believe Satan's lie do you know in
[1:05:14] John 17 and 5 Jesus said father glorify
[1:05:16] me with my own self the glory which I
[1:05:18] have with thee before the world was
[1:05:21] do you know that there was before the
[1:05:23] world was Jesus had a memory of what it
[1:05:25] was before the world was
[1:05:27] he had a memory and he spoke to God
[1:05:30] about the disciples who was with him
[1:05:33] before the foundation of the world he
[1:05:36] spoke about them that's why Paul said in
[1:05:38] Ephesians 1 he said according he has
[1:05:40] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:05:43] of the world do you think God could just
[1:05:46] send you in this deceptive age and hope
[1:05:48] you wasn't deceived do you think God
[1:05:50] could send you in the most deceiving of
[1:05:53] all ages when the greatest fall that
[1:05:55] ever will happen will happen and you
[1:05:57] wouldn't somehow fall or you wouldn't
[1:05:59] somehow be deceived God knew before he
[1:06:02] sent you here as Jesus predicted in
[1:06:05] Matthew 24 24 he said there shall come
[1:06:08] cough Christ and false Christ he said
[1:06:11] and will deceive the very elect if it
[1:06:14] were possible but glory to God it ain't
[1:06:17] possible because somebody has been
[1:06:19] ordained before the world to begin to
[1:06:22] stand against the LIE of this devil
[1:06:24] that's why the Church of the Living
[1:06:26] God's not backing up to the Dead level
[1:06:28] we're not backing up to our critics
[1:06:30] we're not backing up to the ideas amen
[1:06:32] but by the spirit of God we will stand
[1:06:35] every spirit that comes against the
[1:06:38] Church of the Living God we were
[1:06:39] anointed before the world was isn't it
[1:06:41] amazing there's only one Spirit there's
[1:06:43] only one person who ever knew what the
[1:06:46] world was before but when William
[1:06:48] Branham came and began to preach he
[1:06:51] began to say now let me take you back
[1:06:52] before the world began and he started
[1:06:55] discussing pre-creation knowledge amen
[1:06:58] what was it it wasn't just a man talking
[1:07:00] to you but the same spirit of God that
[1:07:03] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:07:05] used a prophetic voice to speak to the
[1:07:08] church in the end time because he was
[1:07:10] going to anoint you with a revelation
[1:07:12] that we didn't just show up here we were
[1:07:15] sent here we didn't just come and hope
[1:07:18] maybe we'll make it but God who is rich
[1:07:21] in Mercy chose us and anointed us before
[1:07:24] the foundation of the world to stand
[1:07:26] here in this age and anointing of God to
[1:07:29] stand come on you are part of this
[1:07:31] glorious stand and how did he know
[1:07:33] you'll stand because he sent you to
[1:07:35] stand
[1:07:36] sometimes when I look at the age and I
[1:07:39] look at the calling I say God what did
[1:07:42] you know about me I didn't know about
[1:07:43] myself
[1:07:46] I tell you what do you know about me
[1:07:48] that I don't know about myself because
[1:07:50] when I look at this world and I look at
[1:07:52] myself I do not see someone who could
[1:07:54] withstand all of this stuff amen but God
[1:07:57] put something on the inside but he knew
[1:07:59] could withstand hell because it's
[1:08:02] already did it in heaven now it's going
[1:08:05] to do it on the earth you are the
[1:08:08] anointed children of God who withstand
[1:08:10] the LIE of the devil that's why you
[1:08:13] believe God's word
[1:08:15] not just because you're good people
[1:08:17] you're anointed to believe
[1:08:19] you're anointed to believe now brother
[1:08:22] Branham ties together this is two
[1:08:24] beautiful scriptures for you young
[1:08:25] people John 17 and 5 in Ephesians 1 and
[1:08:28] 4 write them two scriptures down and
[1:08:30] look at them later John 17 5 Ephesians
[1:08:32] 1-4 glorify me with the glory we had
[1:08:35] before the world and Ephesians 1 and 4
[1:08:37] he had chosen Us in him
[1:08:39] now brother Branham in the message
[1:08:41] questions and answers from 53 he's going
[1:08:43] to say when God created me I was before
[1:08:46] the foundation of the world he made my
[1:08:48] being my spirit I wasn't conscious as
[1:08:51] far as I know I don't believe you're
[1:08:52] getting it now but listen just a moment
[1:08:54] Jesus told his disciples that he knew
[1:08:56] them before the foundation of the world
[1:08:57] and Paul said he chose us in him before
[1:09:00] the foundation world see those two
[1:09:01] scripts two scriptures together now now
[1:09:03] there was some part of me Orman Neville
[1:09:05] the rest of you all here that's in
[1:09:08] Christ he said before the world ever
[1:09:10] began now here's my analysis of it I
[1:09:13] think the people today are possessed
[1:09:15] with the spirit or the spirit of a part
[1:09:17] of angelic beings the spirits which
[1:09:19] rotated off of God that never fell in
[1:09:21] the beginning that resisted the devil's
[1:09:24] lie in heaven
[1:09:27] as a prophet with an analysis of John 17
[1:09:30] and Ephesians 1 you're Anointed with a
[1:09:33] spirit that didn't fall
[1:09:35] therefore in questions and answers 57
[1:09:37] therefore he could predestinate he said
[1:09:40] by foreknowledge he could tell you who
[1:09:43] would be saved and who wouldn't be saved
[1:09:45] he knew which person would take up with
[1:09:48] which spirit
[1:09:49] God knew when he put you here what
[1:09:52] Spirit you would take up with he knew
[1:09:55] you would take the word even if it was
[1:09:57] against every odd he knew when he put
[1:10:00] Micah against 400 prophets Anointed with
[1:10:03] a lie he knew you were coming he knew
[1:10:06] somebody come on now if you go back and
[1:10:08] read the scripture Elijah prophesied the
[1:10:11] death of Ahab but when it come time for
[1:10:13] the battle of Armageddon the Battle of
[1:10:15] Ahab going to Ramos Gilead amen he had
[1:10:18] 400 line prophets amen that there was a
[1:10:21] there was an angel in heaven said Lord
[1:10:23] how will we fulfill your word he said I
[1:10:25] see the lion spirit and get in them and
[1:10:28] that same line Spirit got in 400
[1:10:30] prophets and said go up and you'll be
[1:10:32] okay but it was only lying to lead them
[1:10:36] in error to fulfill Elijah's prophecy
[1:10:39] that Ahab would die but Micah wouldn't
[1:10:42] get under the lie because he knew what
[1:10:45] the word of God had to say he said
[1:10:47] wouldn't you like to be a Micah you can
[1:10:49] be America come on Church we've had an
[1:10:52] Elijah message in this day we've had the
[1:10:54] word of God in this day and there is the
[1:10:56] spirit of truth and the spirit of error
[1:10:59] and we have been Anointed with a spirit
[1:11:01] of Truth and it'll lead us and guide us
[1:11:03] into all truth because God hath anointed
[1:11:06] you and typed you with Micah he types
[1:11:09] you with David he knew exactly what it
[1:11:12] you were coming in too and he put him in
[1:11:14] the scripture to show hey man he
[1:11:16] withstood 400 prophets to stand with the
[1:11:18] word of God and you will stand every
[1:11:20] denomination every religion every Spirit
[1:11:22] Every Lie Amen to stand with this word
[1:11:24] listen in Revelation chapter 19 it says
[1:11:27] or in Revelation chapter 9 it said that
[1:11:30] that demon that fell from heaven amen
[1:11:33] got two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:11:35] released to him as an army
[1:11:38] so Satan is leading the greatest army
[1:11:41] he's ever LED since heaven
[1:11:43] and the Bible tells us he's leading them
[1:11:46] against the Saints of the most high they
[1:11:49] were natural Spirits against Israel amen
[1:11:52] but they pushed Israel into their
[1:11:54] Homeland now the things that were
[1:11:57] natural have become ecclesiastical and
[1:12:00] religious and they have pushed us into
[1:12:02] the message of the hour we've got no
[1:12:05] hope outside of this message we got no
[1:12:08] hope outside of this word but this
[1:12:10] message is bringing the pride back to
[1:12:13] its original place I tell you why I tell
[1:12:16] you why those Israelites left why those
[1:12:18] Jews left Russia and went to Israel and
[1:12:21] they left Africa and they went to Israel
[1:12:23] and they left Poland and went to Israel
[1:12:26] it's because they were Jews to begin
[1:12:28] with
[1:12:29] and the reason you come out of the
[1:12:31] Baptist and out of the Lutheran and out
[1:12:33] of the world because you were sons of
[1:12:35] God to begin with and God made the devil
[1:12:38] push you but the spirit of God was
[1:12:41] pulling you at the same time bringing
[1:12:44] you back to your Homeland anointed of
[1:12:47] God now listen I tell you that demon is
[1:12:50] leading two hundred thousand thousand
[1:12:51] Devils to cause a fall in the last day
[1:12:54] but there's a bride and the prophet of
[1:12:57] God said when all of hell is poured out
[1:12:59] all of Heaven is poured out to defeat it
[1:13:02] or to withstand that devil
[1:13:05] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:13:07] released against the church can I say
[1:13:08] something to you hey man we have not
[1:13:10] come to Mount Sinai we have not come
[1:13:13] Amen to Mount Calvary we have come to
[1:13:16] Mount Zion and Paul says it in Hebrews
[1:13:18] 12 12 and 22 we are come to Mount Zion
[1:13:22] we have come to the city of the Living
[1:13:24] God the Church of the firstborn come on
[1:13:28] Church you keep looking at this bride as
[1:13:30] a slave come on she is not a slave it's
[1:13:34] his wife
[1:13:36] come on he's not a slave it's his son
[1:13:39] I'll talk to you about that prodigal
[1:13:41] this morning that's not a slave I was
[1:13:43] the man's son everybody else might have
[1:13:46] saw a slave he saw a son come on you
[1:13:48] know I'm in the scripture in the days of
[1:13:50] Hosea everybody saw hosea's wife as a
[1:13:54] prostitute slave but he could never see
[1:13:56] her that way amen he paid the price of
[1:13:58] redemption she wasn't the slave it was
[1:14:01] his wife and the Church of the Living
[1:14:03] God there's a price been paid a
[1:14:06] Redemption for the church in the last
[1:14:08] day he has redeemed her and brought her
[1:14:11] unto Mount Zion the Church of the Living
[1:14:14] God where the Bible says there is an
[1:14:16] innumerable company of angels
[1:14:19] will y'all forgive me for noticing
[1:14:21] you'll forgive me for noticing but if
[1:14:23] they can count the Devils that's against
[1:14:25] you but you can't count the Angels
[1:14:27] that's for you I can put a number on
[1:14:30] them demons that are fighting us but the
[1:14:33] angels of God that are with this bride
[1:14:36] they are in memorable you cannot count
[1:14:38] them I say there are more with us than
[1:14:41] there is with him as a God in heaven
[1:14:43] that's poured out his spirit in this
[1:14:45] last day God has intended for this bride
[1:14:48] to leave this place victorious in this
[1:14:51] hour
[1:14:52] I'll tell you we have received a kingdom
[1:14:54] it cannot be shaken by Demons by
[1:14:56] diseases we have been influenced from
[1:14:59] God
[1:15:00] now I know that demons and diseases and
[1:15:04] cancer comes from the fourth dimension
[1:15:07] comes from a dimension you can't see
[1:15:09] well now we can prove to you it's here
[1:15:12] but you can't see it without an
[1:15:14] instrument to let you know it's here
[1:15:16] amen now
[1:15:18] let's just take this into into
[1:15:20] consideration
[1:15:21] if you take a person tonight that's deaf
[1:15:23] and dumb but the RAM said see what
[1:15:25] happens is many times you take them to a
[1:15:28] doctor and he said now if there's a bone
[1:15:31] that's laying on the nerve or there's
[1:15:33] something out of order he said they
[1:15:34] could do some kind of surgery or they
[1:15:36] can do something to fix the hearing
[1:15:38] he said but if the if the nerve is dead
[1:15:42] they can't fix it with surgery and they
[1:15:44] don't know what's wrong with it
[1:15:46] he said but what it is it's actually a
[1:15:49] spirit
[1:15:50] now look he goes into the Bible and said
[1:15:53] Jesus cast out the deaf and dumb Spirit
[1:15:55] he said now you calling anything you
[1:15:57] want the Bible calls it a spirit
[1:16:01] now see if you could pick it up with
[1:16:03] x-ray they can tell you what's wrong but
[1:16:05] they can't say what's wrong they just
[1:16:07] know they're deaf and dumb so brother
[1:16:09] random on the other hand being a Seer
[1:16:11] being a prophet he said let me let me
[1:16:13] just take you into a little instruction
[1:16:14] he said what it's like he said it's just
[1:16:18] like maybe your hand
[1:16:19] he said you take a transparent band you
[1:16:22] remember the story many of you probably
[1:16:23] heard it he said you take a transparent
[1:16:25] band and wrap around your hand he said
[1:16:29] all of a sudden your hand starts turning
[1:16:30] odd colors and and the light starts
[1:16:33] leaving it starts getting numb and a
[1:16:35] little while he said the hand is not
[1:16:37] useful anymore now what is it that's not
[1:16:40] a bone out of order it's not a nerve out
[1:16:43] of order nothing's wrong but there's a
[1:16:45] band wrapped around it that's cutting
[1:16:47] off the life to it and you can't see it
[1:16:51] because instruments of medicine can't
[1:16:53] pick it up
[1:16:54] but the prophet of God said but what it
[1:16:56] is it's a spirit that's wrapped around
[1:16:58] the nerve and it's cutting off the
[1:17:01] source of life to that nerve now he said
[1:17:03] when that happens he said there's no
[1:17:05] Doctrine in the world can fix that
[1:17:08] he said but if you could come into the
[1:17:10] house of God and get to maybe get prayer
[1:17:12] or something would happen he said the
[1:17:15] spirit has to be removed from the nerve
[1:17:18] because there's nothing wrong with the
[1:17:20] eardrum there's nothing wrong with the
[1:17:22] hammer there's nothing wrong physically
[1:17:24] at all it's just a band that cuts off
[1:17:27] the line now listen we could take that
[1:17:29] in the Physical Realm and think about it
[1:17:31] but what if you took that in the
[1:17:33] spiritual realm what if you realize that
[1:17:36] there's nothing wrong at all with a
[1:17:38] message there's nothing wrong at all
[1:17:40] with you but there's a band that's been
[1:17:42] placed around your belief system that
[1:17:45] you can't hear the word of God clearly
[1:17:47] because a spirit is controlling what
[1:17:51] you're hearing
[1:17:53] have you ever now you young people
[1:17:55] probably are just coming to this stage
[1:17:57] of life but I know your elders know what
[1:17:58] I'm talking about have you ever been in
[1:18:00] a service and and maybe you had a little
[1:18:02] condemnation on you you talked to the
[1:18:04] preacher about something last week and
[1:18:05] or the week before and maybe you and him
[1:18:08] had a little discussion about something
[1:18:09] a couple weeks later you're in the
[1:18:11] church and he's preaching and you're
[1:18:12] just sure he's bombing you you're sure
[1:18:15] he's just plaguing
[1:18:18] do you know 95 of the time he's really
[1:18:21] not
[1:18:22] and he probably don't even know what it
[1:18:25] is that you're upset about
[1:18:27] and then later
[1:18:29] he can testify you could do a few if you
[1:18:32] wasn't he wasn't scared of it but but
[1:18:34] you go later amen I've had people come
[1:18:36] to me and say well by the way you've
[1:18:38] been you've been boy been tearing me up
[1:18:39] the last couple weeks and I just look at
[1:18:41] him kind of funniest thing
[1:18:43] about why
[1:18:45] why you know but what it is is that
[1:18:47] there's a spirit
[1:18:49] of spit involved
[1:18:50] and that spirit
[1:18:52] things a certain way it makes you
[1:18:55] understand things a certain way
[1:18:58] do you know misunderstandings are a
[1:19:00] great thing in scripture the Bible said
[1:19:01] people misunderstood God do you know
[1:19:04] they'll misunderstand the preacher
[1:19:05] people misunderstand the preacher
[1:19:07] sometimes it will affect a person's life
[1:19:11] for years because the spirit causes a
[1:19:14] little misunderstanding and they'll
[1:19:16] leave the church and they'll get away
[1:19:17] from God or they'll feel like somebody's
[1:19:19] been picking on them when really there
[1:19:21] was nothing wrong with what the preacher
[1:19:23] said that was really nothing wrong with
[1:19:25] you but a devil got involved and twisted
[1:19:28] the thing and ripped a fig tree right
[1:19:30] out of your life but I say tonight you
[1:19:33] ought to recognize it was a spirit and
[1:19:35] you ought to cast that demon in hell and
[1:19:38] get up off of where you are and get back
[1:19:41] in the presence of God if the devil gets
[1:19:43] a hold of you you go down down down down
[1:19:46] if God gets a hold of you you go up up
[1:19:50] up up up I say get god get a hold of the
[1:19:53] church again and let the spirit of
[1:19:55] inspiration and power anoint the church
[1:19:58] with power and authority
[1:20:01] Jesus called it a deaf and dumb spirit
[1:20:04] now I actually got to talk to a lady who
[1:20:07] was in one of Brothers meetings way
[1:20:09] about years ago and she was she said to
[1:20:11] me she was five years old in the meeting
[1:20:14] she said I was setting up front and she
[1:20:16] said the reason I remember it's because
[1:20:18] it was a girl we knew
[1:20:19] she said brother random come in there
[1:20:21] and it was about an 18 year old girl
[1:20:22] that put in a prayer line he said I'd
[1:20:24] known her my whole life my sister's
[1:20:26] known her she'd never spoke one word or
[1:20:28] heard one word in her whole life he said
[1:20:30] she brought her in there brother Brandon
[1:20:32] began to pray for her and he said when
[1:20:34] he prayed for her he condemned the deaf
[1:20:37] and dumb spirit in her and then he said
[1:20:39] he he took his microphone and put in
[1:20:42] front of her lips and whispered in her
[1:20:45] ear and said say mama
[1:20:47] and she said brother all we heard was
[1:20:51] the girl saying through the mic mama she
[1:20:54] said it was the neatest thing to hear
[1:20:55] the first words that she spoke he said
[1:20:58] but but later I studied brother Branham
[1:21:00] on this point and he said now what it is
[1:21:02] he said we don't have any kind of uh he
[1:21:05] said we don't have any kind of hearing
[1:21:07] test here on the platform or any kind of
[1:21:09] doctors he said but I know when the
[1:21:11] spirit's gone because if they can hear
[1:21:14] me they can speak
[1:21:16] he said because it affects the same
[1:21:19] nerve he said the hearing and the
[1:21:21] speaking are tied together if we can get
[1:21:24] them here and we can get them saying see
[1:21:26] when people say things wrong it's
[1:21:28] because they're hearing things wrong but
[1:21:30] if God would remove the spirit they can
[1:21:33] hear it right they could say it right
[1:21:35] I'll tell you what we need amen it's the
[1:21:38] spirit to be removed of misunderstanding
[1:21:40] where the thing would come clear again
[1:21:43] and they would speak it right because
[1:21:45] they hear it right
[1:21:47] now this squirrel actually said
[1:21:48] something to me and she said brother
[1:21:50] Wayne She said but now there's something
[1:21:51] I don't understand about this testimony
[1:21:53] she said because that girl I know I know
[1:21:56] that girl was deaf and dumb from an
[1:21:58] early childhood and she said and I sat
[1:22:00] in brother man's meetings and heard him
[1:22:02] say say mama and she said Mama
[1:22:06] if you go and study the message it
[1:22:08] actually happens in Germany
[1:22:10] and and brother Branham says to a little
[1:22:12] German boy say mama and he says in
[1:22:15] English mama
[1:22:16] because he don't know German
[1:22:19] he might have been born in German but he
[1:22:21] don't know German but the first words he
[1:22:24] ever speaks English words because he's
[1:22:25] hearing an English Prophet all right I
[1:22:28] tell you what amen come on now I never
[1:22:30] heard Baptist I'd never heard Lutheran I
[1:22:33] speak like a prophet because all I ever
[1:22:35] heard was prophet I don't know no
[1:22:37] different to say it if brother random
[1:22:39] said it it's what he said amen one day I
[1:22:42] come one day I come in the house brother
[1:22:45] years ago I I wasn't preaching much I
[1:22:48] was just listening a lot of tapes and
[1:22:49] I'd go down the old bottoms and I just
[1:22:51] ride for hours listen tapes and I'd hear
[1:22:53] Brother Bram saying well I can't sing
[1:22:54] and start with but I I just enjoy it and
[1:22:57] just get into the spirit and brother bam
[1:22:59] he sang this song it's dripping with
[1:23:01] blood
[1:23:03] it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost
[1:23:08] Gospel is dripping with blood so I I
[1:23:12] come in the house one day and I'm not
[1:23:13] married yet I come in the house I'd come
[1:23:15] in my mom and I'm saying it's dripping
[1:23:17] with blood
[1:23:19] it's dripping with blood and she looks
[1:23:22] at me kind of funny she goes that ain't
[1:23:23] the right tune
[1:23:24] I said it ain't the right tune she said
[1:23:26] no she said they don't sing it like that
[1:23:28] I said well I'm sorry I only heard
[1:23:30] brother random sing it
[1:23:34] and sometimes when I teach things people
[1:23:36] say well you don't teach that right I
[1:23:38] said well I'm sorry I've only heard
[1:23:40] about a band teacher I'm sorry I don't
[1:23:43] teach it like the world teaches it but
[1:23:45] if William Branham said it let's get
[1:23:47] back to preaching the message and
[1:23:49] believe in the message of the hour I
[1:23:51] don't have a Baptist here I don't have a
[1:23:52] Lutheran here I've got an ear for the
[1:23:55] word of God and the Bible said he that
[1:23:57] happened here let him hear what the
[1:24:00] spirit says to the church
[1:24:03] the brother man said he said what
[1:24:05] happens is is God speaks to an Angel and
[1:24:07] the angel speaks to the church
[1:24:10] now this woman brother Brown the brother
[1:24:13] and pray for the girl this woman
[1:24:15] actually tells me she said but it was
[1:24:16] confusing to me because the girl went
[1:24:18] home
[1:24:19] he's about two three days later the girl
[1:24:21] went home her parents said she'd been
[1:24:22] faking it her whole 18 years you've been
[1:24:25] faking this your whole life that's not
[1:24:26] true you've been faking this there's no
[1:24:29] way you've had a miracle where you
[1:24:31] couldn't hear and couldn't speak and now
[1:24:32] you can hear and speak we don't believe
[1:24:34] it
[1:24:34] do you know that woman told me she said
[1:24:36] brother Wayne She said God be my witness
[1:24:39] that girl quit speaking and quit hearing
[1:24:41] and never heard or spoke again after
[1:24:43] that day
[1:24:44] I said are you serious she said yeah she
[1:24:46] said I know she was healed what happened
[1:24:48] I said I'll tell you what happened amen
[1:24:51] God healed that woman but that she let
[1:24:54] that devil come right back in her life
[1:24:57] she allowed that to come right you said
[1:24:59] preacher that ain't possible it ain't
[1:25:01] possible let's take a couple instances
[1:25:02] what about Apostle Peter when he was
[1:25:05] standing on the boat and Jesus said come
[1:25:07] walk to me he got out and walked on the
[1:25:10] water but when he got his eyes off of
[1:25:13] Jesus
[1:25:14] hey many begin to seek because he was
[1:25:16] looking at the water instead of Jesus
[1:25:19] now you know that water typed Humanity
[1:25:21] don't you amen he got you looking at
[1:25:24] everything around him instead of looking
[1:25:26] at Jesus and he began to sink but but by
[1:25:29] Grace God Amen reached down his hand and
[1:25:32] kicked him back up on the wave and led
[1:25:34] him back to the boat do you know Jesus
[1:25:37] said it like this he said that when the
[1:25:38] spirit goes out of a man it walks in dry
[1:25:40] places and returns now you've heard
[1:25:43] Jesus say that right amen it said it
[1:25:45] brings back seven worse than the first
[1:25:48] is that right now we've always wondered
[1:25:50] it goes out in dry places how long do
[1:25:52] they stay that's a good question isn't
[1:25:54] it if they go out how long do we got
[1:25:56] before they get back brother Brown said
[1:25:57] 72 hours
[1:25:59] three days 72 hours them demons will
[1:26:02] roam 72 dollars and then they will
[1:26:04] return to the house now here's something
[1:26:08] years ago there was a brother down in
[1:26:10] Hot Springs brother man prayed for him
[1:26:11] and and they were right on the death bed
[1:26:13] and God healed them amen and a few days
[1:26:15] later the sickness returned right back
[1:26:17] so they called brother Brown he's still
[1:26:19] here they called brother random right
[1:26:20] quick and they said brother random their
[1:26:22] sickness is returning to us and rather
[1:26:23] than said no he said no it's not that at
[1:26:26] all he said it's just like this it's
[1:26:28] just like you've had a cat in the house
[1:26:29] and you fed it for days but then one day
[1:26:32] you take the cat and you throw it out
[1:26:33] the door and you shut the door he said
[1:26:35] now that cat's being used to living and
[1:26:38] feeding in that house he's gonna come
[1:26:40] back and scratch at the door he said all
[1:26:42] that is is the devil's scratching and
[1:26:45] boarding back in he has successfully
[1:26:47] been kicked out and don't you open up
[1:26:49] the door and let him back in see after
[1:26:52] 72 hours that devil will return to you
[1:26:54] and say you never got nothing in that
[1:26:56] meeting God never trusts you he never
[1:26:58] healed you he never did delivered you he
[1:27:01] never gave you the grace that you wanted
[1:27:02] amen but let me tell you there's a
[1:27:04] difference this time he's on the outside
[1:27:07] talking and still on the inside talking
[1:27:09] and don't you open up the door and let
[1:27:12] that devil back in is it not him out
[1:27:15] keep him out I think it's time to lock
[1:27:18] the door on the devil and say that's
[1:27:20] enough Satan you'll not live in this
[1:27:22] house you'll not eat at my table
[1:27:25] come on you're not sleep in my bed I
[1:27:29] think it's time for the Church of the
[1:27:30] Living God he said preacher what are you
[1:27:32] saying I'm saying 72 hours and that
[1:27:34] Devil's coming back
[1:27:36] yeah you've got to fill the void
[1:27:39] you've got to feel the void the place
[1:27:42] and what to do is to fill that void with
[1:27:44] the word of God you see what happened
[1:27:46] with that girl she had she had her
[1:27:48] healing but she left the devil Robert
[1:27:50] out of her
[1:27:51] she let somebody tell her it was all
[1:27:53] emotional it was all just emotional work
[1:27:56] up it's all just in your mind it's all
[1:27:58] no good and she allowed the devil to rob
[1:28:01] her miracle from her don't you let no
[1:28:04] devil Rob your Miracle God can do
[1:28:06] special things for people he can deliver
[1:28:08] them supernaturally and then somebody
[1:28:10] will say well there wasn't nothing big
[1:28:12] about that you know it was just this
[1:28:13] this I can't tell you the times I've had
[1:28:15] people call me on the phone and say
[1:28:17] we're on our way to emergency right now
[1:28:19] my brother's having a heart attack and
[1:28:20] he eats a real bad thing brother Wayne
[1:28:22] pray pray pray you pray pray an hour
[1:28:24] later they call you back and say it was
[1:28:26] a false alarm he just had heartburn oh
[1:28:29] okay
[1:28:30] and they're on their way to the doctor
[1:28:32] and and a stroke is hitting them and
[1:28:34] they can't speak and they can't move
[1:28:36] their hand and you go to prayer and two
[1:28:38] hours later they call you back said they
[1:28:39] can't figure out what happened it was a
[1:28:41] false alarm no it wasn't amen that devil
[1:28:44] was on his way but God stepped in the
[1:28:47] way you ought to give glory to God
[1:28:49] somebody trying to make it like you're
[1:28:51] making something up you ain't making
[1:28:53] something up the God of Abraham is
[1:28:55] Supernatural and moves from the church
[1:28:57] and he deserves glory for what he does
[1:29:00] don't you let that devil Rob the
[1:29:02] supernatural out of your life well it
[1:29:03] didn't happen yeah it happened yeah it
[1:29:06] was God yeah it was Mercy yeah it come
[1:29:09] down in your life and he spoke to you
[1:29:10] and you ought to hold on to it he said
[1:29:13] preacher how do I hold on to it Paul
[1:29:15] said to hold your confession hold the
[1:29:18] confession of your faith because he is
[1:29:20] the high priest of your confession you
[1:29:22] want to know how to hold on to
[1:29:25] hold on to send it when you don't feel
[1:29:26] it when you wake up in the morning and
[1:29:28] you know God delivered you but you don't
[1:29:31] feel any different you did on Friday you
[1:29:33] got to tell that devil you don't you
[1:29:35] don't gonna lie to me no more you ain't
[1:29:37] gonna trouble me no more I know
[1:29:39] something happened I know God slept in
[1:29:42] my life and I'm not giving up my
[1:29:44] testimony
[1:29:46] somebody said well I'll tell you what
[1:29:47] brother Wayne I thought I got the Holy
[1:29:49] Ghost and got saved but I woke up and I
[1:29:50] had all kinds of Temptations and
[1:29:52] troubles and I thought well there ain't
[1:29:53] no way I get the Holy Ghost do you see
[1:29:55] how that devil lies let's take it to
[1:29:57] physical places and when God heals
[1:29:59] somebody Divine Healing and miracles are
[1:30:01] different but if God gives you a Divine
[1:30:03] Healing do you know brother Graham said
[1:30:05] the pain will sometimes still be there
[1:30:07] after you have a healing he said the
[1:30:09] same as temptation of sin will remain
[1:30:12] after it's long gone after you're
[1:30:15] already sealed after you're already got
[1:30:18] the Holy Ghost the devil will tempt you
[1:30:20] to try to make you believe somehow that
[1:30:24] Devil's still in there because brother
[1:30:25] Adam said I don't care how good a
[1:30:27] Christian you are you'll start
[1:30:28] confessing you're not and you won't be
[1:30:34] hey man I don't think y'all to let that
[1:30:36] devil rob you I think you ought to hold
[1:30:38] your confession I thank you come on Amen
[1:30:41] the Bible said man does not live by
[1:30:42] bread alone but by every word that
[1:30:45] proceedeth out of the mouth of God every
[1:30:47] word now y'all got to think about this
[1:30:49] every word one
[1:30:51] ain't ever had
[1:30:56] our Bible has come into effect brother
[1:30:59] random said every Parable in the
[1:31:01] scripture are in effect right now so if
[1:31:03] you want to talk about shamgar your
[1:31:05] shamgar yeah take your testimony and rip
[1:31:09] those Philistines if you want to talk
[1:31:11] about Samson your Samson pick up that
[1:31:15] pick up that job home
[1:31:18] pick up that bone of your mouth and go
[1:31:21] to slaying them devils
[1:31:24] come on church it's time to remember
[1:31:27] amen that you are Samson you are sangar
[1:31:30] you are Tamar you are the Mighty Men of
[1:31:33] David you are David you are ever type in
[1:31:36] the Bible you become the fullness of the
[1:31:38] word in this age and I think it's time
[1:31:40] to remind that devil and who we are what
[1:31:43] we're here for and you just keep
[1:31:45] confessing this word until he backs up
[1:31:48] do you know the prophet of God said this
[1:31:49] he said what you need to do is confess
[1:31:51] the word and you need to say it like you
[1:31:54] believe it and if you really don't
[1:31:55] believe it and all you got it is
[1:31:57] intellectually he said keep saying it
[1:31:59] till you actually do believe it yeah
[1:32:03] take the word of God put it on your lips
[1:32:06] and begin to prophesy against the devil
[1:32:11] and let me ask you something how does he
[1:32:13] defeat you with one little thought
[1:32:15] that's right he comes in your mind with
[1:32:17] one little thought it's maybe not even a
[1:32:20] spoken word but God has given you
[1:32:23] permission to turn around and tell that
[1:32:26] devil you're a bluff you're a liar
[1:32:29] you're a Tormentor and a prophet gave us
[1:32:32] his origin yes Hallelujah I know where
[1:32:35] it come from and I know where he's going
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:32:40] I was reading it by study one day in
[1:32:42] office I was praying I was reading about
[1:32:44] something I was studying on no eternal
[1:32:45] hell and I was just looking through some
[1:32:47] of the scriptures about what happens to
[1:32:48] the devil I wonder what happened to my
[1:32:50] enemy I want to know what God's going to
[1:32:52] do with him but you know the Bible said
[1:32:53] he'll throw him in to the Lake of Fire
[1:32:56] which burns he's going to throw him and
[1:32:58] brother man said like this he said those
[1:33:01] demons will have an end
[1:33:03] he said God will completely annihilate
[1:33:06] them I was sitting in my study and read
[1:33:08] that out loud and there was a rat about
[1:33:10] this long went running right through my
[1:33:12] room I don't have her answer
[1:33:14] we don't have rats in my house there's
[1:33:16] no rats there at all that Devil Couldn't
[1:33:19] take that word being read over that room
[1:33:21] and then they say it over this
[1:33:23] congregation tonight that Devil's a rat
[1:33:26] he's a liar he's a bluff and he's got an
[1:33:29] end from it every time he tells you
[1:33:31] about your past
[1:33:33] and tell him about his future God didn't
[1:33:36] make the hell for sons of God he made it
[1:33:39] for the devil and his angels and Satan
[1:33:41] will be burnt with his own fire there's
[1:33:45] an end coming to this devil
[1:33:47] so well I'll tell you what he wants to
[1:33:49] come around and bug me we'll go ahead
[1:33:51] and just sit down right here devil let
[1:33:52] me tell you a story
[1:33:56] let me tell you a story that you won't
[1:33:58] forget
[1:33:59] yeah so by the way you look like a
[1:34:00] sinner maybe in your eyes but in God's
[1:34:02] eyes brother Madam said he put the blood
[1:34:04] over us
[1:34:06] cover our mistakes and no man might
[1:34:08] think you're a sinner go can't even see
[1:34:11] the sin
[1:34:14] say it till you believe it
[1:34:17] well I don't know if it'll change it'll
[1:34:18] take the paralysis out of your life and
[1:34:20] let you walk like a Christian that's it
[1:34:23] yeah listen to me even the devil's going
[1:34:25] to paralyze you
[1:34:27] he's going to paralyze your faith or
[1:34:29] you're going to paralyze him
[1:34:31] now brother man y'all know how many
[1:34:32] times brother Graham said it either your
[1:34:34] faith will paralyze the devil where he
[1:34:37] can't tread around your life or he will
[1:34:40] paralyze your faith and you up
[1:34:43] in your thoughts and your doctrines and
[1:34:45] your feelings now you say preacher what
[1:34:48] are your times go back to the Natural

[1:35:28] nurse for a daughter and every time I
[1:35:31] say that I'm Healed and I'm still
[1:35:33] crippled she says I'm lying on the Lord

[1:36:16] come walking down the aisle paralyzed
[1:36:18] dragging her leg dragging her arm come
[1:36:21] right down there come right up the
[1:36:22] prayer line I thought I was gonna have
[1:36:23] to pray for her again I would have
[1:36:25] prayed for the second time I believe in
[1:36:27] it amen but you know what when I went to
[1:36:29] go over to pray for her I said what do
[1:36:31] you want sis she said I want to testify
[1:36:33] how God healed me this morning
[1:36:36] and brother I went to give her a
[1:36:38] lollipop mic just like this and instead
[1:36:41] of taking it with her good hand she took
[1:36:43] it with that paralyzed hand and the
[1:36:45] power of God I saw the leg straightened
[1:36:47] I saw the arm straightening that woman
[1:36:49] danced all over the front of that
[1:36:51] building
[1:36:52] because she confess the word of God when
[1:36:55] she couldn't see it when she couldn't
[1:36:56] feel it when it wasn't true in her own
[1:36:59] mind but the word of God is true and it
[1:37:03] stands forever I'd rather stand on the
[1:37:05] word of God and stand in the heavens
[1:37:07] because the heavens could fail Earth can
[1:37:09] fail but the word of God can never fail
[1:37:12] you when a man stands on the word of God
[1:37:15] he's standing in God's word itself now
[1:37:18] you say preacher what are you talking
[1:37:19] about I'm talking about testifying that
[1:37:22] change comes
[1:37:24] I'm talking about the power of God that
[1:37:26] testifies of the change that comes in
[1:37:28] our life listen I want you to know
[1:37:30] something there's a different spirit in
[1:37:32] this bride yes sir
[1:37:34] yes sir you'll say Spirit let's just
[1:37:36] let's just really quick think about
[1:37:37] something when you were born in this
[1:37:40] earth you were born with water blood and
[1:37:42] spirit
[1:37:43] now the spirit you're born
[1:37:45] has to come from somewhere
[1:37:47] and the prophet of God said the breath
[1:37:49] of life was permitted to you and it came
[1:37:51] The Germ of life from your father so
[1:37:54] when you were born by your first birth
[1:37:55] you were born in a permissive will of
[1:37:58] God in a fallen State you got breath but
[1:38:01] you got no life that's right Walking
[1:38:04] Dead Men breathing dead men but dead in
[1:38:08] the soul but watch now that's why no
[1:38:12] amount of Rehabilitation will help you
[1:38:14] that's why that no amount of psychology
[1:38:18] will change you you can you can go to
[1:38:20] AAA you can turn a new lead you can do
[1:38:23] anything you want but the spirit on the
[1:38:25] inside of you is condemned because it
[1:38:29] comes from a sex birth
[1:38:31] but God give us a new birth that
[1:38:35] produces a water a blood and a spirit so
[1:38:40] if you take the spirit of the new birth
[1:38:42] you have taken the spirit of God and it
[1:38:45] comes into your life now if the spirit
[1:38:47] of God comes into your life now you're
[1:38:50] in a different world you're in a world
[1:38:52] of believer
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:54] if God is true amen because when God
[1:38:57] comes into your life his spirit is the
[1:39:00] spirit of Grace now I just thought about
[1:39:02] something this morning we were
[1:39:03] discussing how that that Lazarus come
[1:39:06] out of the Tomb and God loosed him from
[1:39:08] this grave clothes we talked about how
[1:39:10] the Prodigal Son returned and God put
[1:39:13] Heaven father put shoes on him and wrap
[1:39:15] him in a robe and we talked about how he
[1:39:18] was restored you see he comes to life
[1:39:21] and then he's restored and so is the
[1:39:24] Church of the Living God but do you see
[1:39:26] what God does in the end time it's look
[1:39:30] the spirit that created the world to
[1:39:33] begin with has moved into the church to
[1:39:37] restore the church to its original
[1:39:40] eating condition
[1:39:42] you know if you if you like to study the
[1:39:45] Bible do you all know that the world is
[1:39:47] coming to a great conclusion here pretty
[1:39:49] soon under Atomic Warfare
[1:39:51] how many knows this is right do you know
[1:39:54] the Millennium the whole earth is
[1:39:55] annihilated for the Millennium and we
[1:39:57] walk upon the ashes of the wicked and
[1:39:59] there's not root nor Branch left now how
[1:40:02] does that happen the prophet of God said
[1:40:03] by the atom bomb
[1:40:05] so the atomic bomb clears it off that's
[1:40:08] why the devil remains till all the way
[1:40:11] through the Millennium to the end of the
[1:40:13] Millennium now watch he remains chained
[1:40:16] by circumstances
[1:40:18] he can't do nothing because he ain't got
[1:40:20] nobody to do it through so he's changed
[1:40:23] by circumstances but at the end of the
[1:40:26] Millennium God raises up the wife from
[1:40:28] judges the devil and his angels cast
[1:40:30] them in the Lake of Fire and then burns
[1:40:33] the Earth for the second time
[1:40:36] but this time he does it with Holy Fire
[1:40:39] every hybrid everything that ain't
[1:40:42] original every demon every devil will be
[1:40:45] completely burnt off of the face of the
[1:40:48] Earth and you said preacher what are you
[1:40:50] talking about I'm talking about God says
[1:40:52] I will give you a new spirit but then I
[1:40:55] will put my spirit on the inside of you
[1:40:58] and God can come and deal with your
[1:41:00] spirit and he can change your life but
[1:41:02] when the spirit of God begins to come
[1:41:05] into the church it renovates the soul
[1:41:08] and the original renovator can you think
[1:41:11] about this if you're going to renovate a
[1:41:12] house let's just take a house you're
[1:41:14] going to renovate a house and the
[1:41:16] greatest renovator in the entire nation
[1:41:18] lives in your neighborhood yeah yeah and
[1:41:21] you say Sir would you take my house
[1:41:24] it's condemned there's no way it can do
[1:41:26] anything but could you take this
[1:41:28] condemned house and renovate it and make
[1:41:30] a mansion out of it and if a man takes
[1:41:33] the job his reputation's on the line now
[1:41:36] if you can get that renovator to do the
[1:41:38] job wouldn't you let him do it and the
[1:41:41] renovator that will renovate the heavens
[1:41:43] and the Earth and put the Earth back in
[1:41:47] its hidden condition has offered if this
[1:41:50] time and age to come into you by a
[1:41:53] spirit and renovate your life
[1:41:58] you got all these things out of order
[1:42:00] he'll put them back you get all these
[1:42:02] things out of place he'll set it all
[1:42:04] right back in order and renovate that
[1:42:07] life
[1:42:09] he said preacher what are you talking
[1:42:10] about you know the Bible said the spirit
[1:42:12] of Elijah shall return on the last day
[1:42:13] right
[1:42:14] brother bam said it's nothing but the
[1:42:16] spirit of God under the ministry of
[1:42:18] restoration
[1:42:20] it's restoring it's you see it's the
[1:42:22] Holy Ghost it's not another God it's the
[1:42:25] Holy Ghost but he's in the ministry of
[1:42:27] restority I shall restore saith the Lord
[1:42:30] It's God restoring the Church of course
[1:42:33] when he begins to restore the church he
[1:42:36] has to shove out everything that don't
[1:42:38] belong there
[1:42:39] oh God yeah now now you all know it's a
[1:42:43] spirit right it's what we're talking
[1:42:44] about it's a spirit do you know that
[1:42:46] whenever you start exposing a devil it
[1:42:48] starts losing his power that's right
[1:42:50] y'all know that right
[1:42:52] when you start exposing a spirit that
[1:42:54] starts losing its power
[1:42:56] now if you let's just say while you're
[1:42:58] preaching I've seen it happen a lot of
[1:42:59] times why I'm preaching a certain Spirit
[1:43:02] maybe is affecting the congregation or
[1:43:04] expecting certain lives and when God
[1:43:06] starts dealing with that Spirit you can
[1:43:09] almost now brother man could literally
[1:43:11] see a black streak that would move but
[1:43:14] and I've never seen maybe more than once
[1:43:16] a black street I've seen it but not
[1:43:18] maybe more of once or twice as the most
[1:43:20] but I've literally could almost
[1:43:22] sometimes it's like they're the only
[1:43:24] person in the building I'm probably
[1:43:26] saying too much right now but I'll just
[1:43:27] say it like this it's almost like that
[1:43:29] person is isolated there's a whole
[1:43:31] congregation but it's just an isolated
[1:43:33] person and then in a second oh there
[1:43:36] they are right there and those two
[1:43:38] Spirits are connecting and they're
[1:43:41] literally uh how could you say it
[1:43:43] they're actually obstructing the moving
[1:43:46] of the spirit or they're blocking the
[1:43:49] channel of the gift that's working in
[1:43:51] the Pulpit because Satan is being
[1:43:53] brought out and exposed that he's going
[1:43:55] to lose his position he's going to lose
[1:43:58] his place to hide because we're moving
[1:44:00] we're moving to you can can he get it
[1:44:03] like this the devil don't care where he
[1:44:04] hides can I say this
[1:44:06] now I'm a hillbilly I'm sorry I just
[1:44:08] come from the hills I'm a real simple
[1:44:09] guy but back in the summer y'all got
[1:44:12] copperheads up here I never seen one in
[1:44:14] Ohio but comprehend we get comprehends
[1:44:16] rattlesnakes cottonmouths and we live
[1:44:18] right next to a creek so we had all
[1:44:20] three on our property and and you know
[1:44:22] what I found out if you go outside on a
[1:44:24] warm evening and you and you go out and
[1:44:27] you see a big Copperhead laying there
[1:44:28] and if he sees you and you pick a hole
[1:44:31] up and you're gonna cut his head off
[1:44:32] he'll Run for the closest whatever
[1:44:35] he don't care if it's an old boat laying
[1:44:39] on its back he don't care if it's a weed
[1:44:41] bed he don't care if it's a pile of wood
[1:44:43] he don't care if it's a couple sheets of
[1:44:46] tins he does not care where he hides so
[1:44:50] long as he escapes the end of that hole
[1:44:53] and the devil don't care where he hides
[1:44:55] he'll get into a little Grudge just in
[1:44:58] your family he'll get into a little
[1:45:00] misunderstanding in the church or he
[1:45:02] don't like me she don't like me they
[1:45:03] talked about me they don't believe me
[1:45:05] well they just see and the devil will
[1:45:07] get right in there
[1:45:09] and whenever the gift of the Lord starts
[1:45:11] working in Ministry those spirits will
[1:45:14] start getting together and they'll try
[1:45:16] to withstand that preacher amen and
[1:45:19] while he's preaching you won't even
[1:45:20] realize it the congregation but you'll
[1:45:22] think why is he acting like it's
[1:45:24] something wrong why has he not got that
[1:45:26] fire today why ain't he really just
[1:45:28] preaching away right now it's because
[1:45:30] there's a resistance against him and
[1:45:33] he's standing there preaching against
[1:45:34] that Spirit now you Faithful what you
[1:45:37] ought to do when you see that happening
[1:45:39] you ought to literally stand on your
[1:45:41] feet and say preach it preacher preach
[1:45:44] it preacher preach it preacher preach it
[1:45:46] preacher because what you're doing is
[1:45:49] you're Excavating that Devil's spot to
[1:45:52] hide
[1:45:53] come on if you expose him you'll have to
[1:45:56] leave come on you think about this right
[1:45:58] now but if that happens in the black if
[1:46:01] that happens in the in the uh serpent
[1:46:04] world or in the devil world what about
[1:46:07] the light of God that begins to move in
[1:46:11] a in a spirit likes in this building
[1:46:13] tonight when that Liberty's there and
[1:46:16] the power of God is just coming one word
[1:46:18] upon another you know what's actually
[1:46:20] happening that light in you is
[1:46:23] connecting with that light back there
[1:46:25] and back there and over there and after
[1:46:27] a little while it just starts jumping
[1:46:30] back and forth and after a while the old
[1:46:32] church is just a radiant light of the
[1:46:35] glory of God and the angels are moving
[1:46:38] and God is moving and energy and
[1:46:40] strength and anointing and Healing
[1:46:42] Begins to come into the church because
[1:46:45] the power of God is taking over the
[1:46:47] building faith is rising in its
[1:46:50] anointing what's going on amen God is
[1:46:53] moving God is moving do you know brother
[1:46:57] Brown said the devil ain't nothing but a
[1:46:59] shadow
[1:47:00] now he's a real devil
[1:47:02] but he's a shadow in the light of God
[1:47:05] I was preaching one preaching one day at
[1:47:07] home with the home church and I was
[1:47:09] preaching right away I talked about the
[1:47:10] woman at the whale
[1:47:12] and when the Vindicated word come up and
[1:47:13] started talking to her vindication
[1:47:15] killed the spirit that had been
[1:47:17] directing her life and she was a free
[1:47:18] woman
[1:47:21] and I said something along the line she
[1:47:23] never was a prostitute to begin with
[1:47:25] but nobody had ever offered her a higher
[1:47:28] thought than religion or Pharisees but
[1:47:32] when the Redeemer come he took her back
[1:47:34] to the original thought that God had and
[1:47:37] the thought he offered was so high it
[1:47:40] lifted her above her physical life and
[1:47:43] when I said that I looked in the back
[1:47:45] and there was a black cloud come right
[1:47:47] out of the Pew like a like almost as big
[1:47:49] as my jacket I've seen it rise right up
[1:47:51] out of the back toward the church and
[1:47:53] hit the ceiling and go out like that and
[1:47:55] I started to just let it go and finally
[1:47:57] I said no I'm going to prove to the
[1:47:59] crowd it's happening right now and I
[1:48:01] spoke that and told what happened and
[1:48:03] the lady in the back started screaming
[1:48:05] and shouting because it actually had
[1:48:08] took place the spirit had left her under
[1:48:11] the Vindicated word what's going on in
[1:48:14] this building right now the foolishness
[1:48:17] of preaching is pushing the devil out of
[1:48:20] the mind of the Church of the Living God
[1:48:25] I charge the devil in the name of Jesus
[1:48:28] Christ he's a trespasser and a squatter
[1:48:31] and he don't have any right in the
[1:48:33] church he has no legal claims on you at
[1:48:36] all
[1:48:37] now I know brother Branham actually
[1:48:40] takes a a there's actually a place in
[1:48:42] the in the message where there's a two
[1:48:44] women sitting next to each other one's
[1:48:46] got a hay fever another one's six the
[1:48:48] Indian lady brother random I could read
[1:48:50] it to you but I'll just I'll just tell
[1:48:52] you what it is basically and and they
[1:48:54] were sitting there next to each other
[1:48:55] and brother Brown discerns the woman and
[1:48:57] when he looks at the woman he said ma'am
[1:48:58] he said you I see you got hay fever I
[1:49:01] see you real sick he said God just heals
[1:49:03] you and then the morning he says this he
[1:49:06] stops and says now the lady sitting next
[1:49:09] to you is sick also take your hands and
[1:49:12] put on her and begin to pray in the name
[1:49:14] of Jesus now watch this they both come
[1:49:16] in under a spirit they were both sick
[1:49:19] under a spirit but when the prophet
[1:49:22] began to deliver the girl the delivered
[1:49:24] woman and turn and put her hands on The
[1:49:28] Other Woman and brother Brown said she's
[1:49:30] healed I see it leaving her now he said
[1:49:33] I see a light coming from the woman
[1:49:37] pushing that dark Spirit out can you
[1:49:41] imagine hey man standing there you don't
[1:49:43] think your hands are powerful you don't
[1:49:45] think your faith is powerful but listen
[1:49:47] to me if there is a teaspoon of God in
[1:49:49] you all Heaven is on the inside of a
[1:49:52] Believer that's got the Holy Ghost you
[1:49:54] tell me has God got a weak part I'll
[1:49:57] tell you no he's all-powerful he's
[1:49:59] all-knowing and it don't matter where
[1:50:01] he's at he's still God and he's still
[1:50:03] got power
[1:50:05] Glory he's a preacher what are you
[1:50:08] talking about I'm talking about the
[1:50:09] power to push out every Spirit that's
[1:50:10] unlike God's in this building right now
[1:50:12] and it's in you and all you've got to do
[1:50:14] is start pressing against that thing and
[1:50:17] tell it it don't belong there amen there
[1:50:19] ain't nothing wrong with you
[1:50:21] there ain't nothing wrong with your
[1:50:22] preacher there ain't nothing wrong with
[1:50:24] this message there's an invisible band
[1:50:26] trying to cut off your hearing and make
[1:50:29] you hear things a certain way make you
[1:50:31] even understand your own misunderstand
[1:50:33] your own Pastor make you misunderstand
[1:50:36] the ministry make you misunderstand your
[1:50:37] family make you in every time you
[1:50:40] misunderstand somebody that builds a
[1:50:42] cage
[1:50:43] he said preacher why are you saying I'll
[1:50:45] tell you why I'm saying it because I was
[1:50:46] reading one day and the spirit of the
[1:50:48] Lord actually put it on my heart he
[1:50:50] actually showed me Amen in the scripture
[1:50:52] where people had misunderstood and what
[1:50:55] it caused in their lives do you know
[1:50:57] brother Branham actually tells us
[1:51:00] amen that we have got to recognize the
[1:51:03] devil at every one of his tricks
[1:51:05] that's how we overcome now we recognize
[1:51:08] the devil every one of his tricks and
[1:51:10] we've got to recognize the devil is real
[1:51:13] some people say there's no devil it's
[1:51:15] just a thought he said now there is a
[1:51:16] real devil he's just as real as anybody
[1:51:19] he's a real devil and you must recognize
[1:51:21] that he's real you must know that he is
[1:51:23] a devil but at the same time you've got
[1:51:27] to recognize that the devil and he's
[1:51:29] against you but to overcome you've got
[1:51:31] to recognize that God is in you greater
[1:51:34] and mightier than he is
[1:51:37] [Music]
[1:51:38] now brother Bradham actually y'all y'all
[1:51:41] heard the story uh brother Brown said he
[1:51:43] saw a vision with people and they were
[1:51:45] in that in those bars of Hell remember
[1:51:47] that he said in big old bars and he said
[1:51:49] the person said brother by them deliver
[1:51:51] the people they're good people you
[1:51:53] remember he says that in the vision he
[1:51:55] says they're good people have you ever
[1:51:57] noticed there's a little something in
[1:51:58] there he says you have been
[1:52:01] misunderstood
[1:52:04] oh my
[1:52:06] God you mean that we're good people
[1:52:08] they were good people but they were in
[1:52:10] bars
[1:52:12] because they had misunderstood
[1:52:16] but you know what that was made a
[1:52:17] misunderstand
[1:52:18] it was a spirit
[1:52:21] it was a spirit that made them hear
[1:52:23] things
[1:52:24] at a certain skew
[1:52:26] made them hear things a certain way
[1:52:29] now listen
[1:52:30] if you could just move that band off
[1:52:34] you can hear the message with clarity
[1:52:37] you can hear your ministry with clarity
[1:52:40] you can hear the tapes with clarity
[1:52:43] now right now I believe this with all of
[1:52:46] my heart
[1:52:47] I believe that Jesus Christ defeated
[1:52:51] Satan and every one of his powers at
[1:52:54] Calvary

[1:53:00] has to be shed for you
[1:53:04] stripe has to be taken

[1:54:38] now you said preacher I don't know I
[1:54:41] don't know if all this I don't know
[1:54:42] about all this well let me tell you this
[1:54:45] when David Livingstone went to Africa
[1:54:47] y'all remember the story David
[1:54:48] Livingstone is a great missionary and
[1:54:50] when he went to Africa he he wanted to
[1:54:51] he wanted to missionary and not die so
[1:54:54] he actually met one of the great African
[1:54:56] tribes and he made a deal with one of
[1:54:59] the great Chiefs of the tribe and went
[1:55:01] in Covenant with a guy he literally went
[1:55:03] into a blood Covenant with an African
[1:55:06] Chief and they had to give exchanges for
[1:55:09] their Covenant and when they when they
[1:55:10] they actually mingled the blood and and
[1:55:13] the chief said to David what will you
[1:55:14] give me and he said he said what do you
[1:55:17] want chief he said I want that white
[1:55:18] Coach you were so David gave him his so
[1:55:21] his sport coat
[1:55:23] and the African Chief said what do you
[1:55:25] want for me he said I want your
[1:55:27] ceremonial tribe I want your spear your
[1:55:30] ceremony and spear out of your tribe I
[1:55:32] want the one you carry I want the chief
[1:55:34] spirit
[1:55:34] he said well okay so he gave him the
[1:55:37] chief spear somebody said why do you
[1:55:39] want that spear for because as he went
[1:55:41] on his journey throughout the tribe as
[1:55:43] Africa those tribes didn't know who that
[1:55:46] man was they had no respect at all for
[1:55:48] that man but every time he got into a
[1:55:51] problem with one of the tribes he just
[1:55:53] held that Spirit up as a sign he was in
[1:55:57] blood Covenant with the chief of Africa
[1:56:01] let me tell you this we have been given
[1:56:03] a message from God that speaks of our

[1:58:59] about a powerful people in the name of
[1:59:01] Jesus Christ the authority of God that
[1:59:04] has been given this church
[1:59:06] it's a preacher
[1:59:08] Richard what are you talking about let
[1:59:10] me tell you what I'm talking about
[1:59:11] I'm talking about the Lord is here to
[1:59:14] remove Every curse
[1:59:16] I read the prophet he said it like this
[1:59:18] he said see he said tonight someone's
[1:59:21] been standing here Bound By An
[1:59:23] oppression from Satan foul Spirits has
[1:59:24] tried to put Pride upon her he said
[1:59:27] endowed here to remove the curse of the
[1:59:29] enemy
[1:59:33] God has come into this building tonight
[1:59:37] to remove the curse of the enemy he said
[1:59:40] preacher how in the world how in the
[1:59:42] world do you expect change to happen
[1:59:44] just in this meeting
[1:59:47] I'll tell you what what happened to
[1:59:48] Aaron's Rod when they took it in the
[1:59:50] holies of holies
[1:59:52] it didn't take a week to change
[1:59:55] there was a spirit in there
[1:59:57] what happened when Jesus spoke to the
[1:59:59] tree
[2:00:00] it didn't take a year for change
[2:00:03] because he spoke to the life that was in
[2:00:05] it
[2:00:06] and if you come in here tonight you look
[2:00:08] at God speaking to the life to the need
[2:00:10] of the people in this room listen I I
[2:00:12] know what I'm talking about I'm not
[2:00:14] standing here tonight just reading you
[2:00:16] out of a book
[2:00:18] it's kind of like brother Brown said I
[2:00:20] went out in California the other day and
[2:00:21] met a man who wrote A he wrote a book on
[2:00:23] the gift
[2:00:23] and brother Brandon said I went out
[2:00:24] there to meet him I said what kind of
[2:00:26] gifts you got he said I don't got any I
[2:00:27] just wrote about him
[2:00:32] I'm God Anthony I just wrote about him
[2:00:33] and many times you hear guys talk about
[2:00:36] the message and they talk about God
[2:00:40] but they never seen him
[2:00:42] they've never seen the power of God
[2:00:43] change situations
[2:00:47] I don't mean that in a condemning way I
[2:00:49] mean that in that there is a reality to
[2:00:52] what I'm talking about
[2:00:55] there is nothing can you say it with me
[2:00:58] nothing
[2:00:59] there is nothing that can stand before
[2:01:01] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:01:05] nothing
[2:01:07] you know I'll just I'll just tell you
[2:01:09] this as musicians come I'm standing in a
[2:01:11] meeting in India one time
[2:01:13] I came into that meeting
[2:01:15] it was a girl sitting back in the back
[2:01:17] in the middle of the meeting and when I
[2:01:18] was preaching I started telling a
[2:01:21] testimony from the scripture
[2:01:23] about that hell was created for the
[2:01:25] devil and his angels now the reason I
[2:01:26] said that's because when I was at home a
[2:01:27] young man asked me if if God's so good
[2:01:30] why is hell so bad
[2:01:32] and I didn't know one of the other
[2:01:34] preachers said well it was just a it was
[2:01:35] just a uh a contrast
[2:01:39] good and bad and I said well I don't
[2:01:40] know about that so I walked to the
[2:01:42] carnival when I did it literally I I'm
[2:01:44] not I'm not storying to you this is what
[2:01:45] happened a whirlwind set down on me and
[2:01:48] I Heard a Voice speak to me and he said
[2:01:50] he said hell was created for the devil
[2:01:53] and his angels
[2:01:54] and right behind it another scripture
[2:01:56] said to me I was not willing that any
[2:01:58] man would perish but that all would come
[2:02:00] unto repentance
[2:02:02] answering the question because they were
[2:02:04] trying to insinuate that God wasn't a
[2:02:07] good God
[2:02:08] and you know what you know what happened
[2:02:10] when the spirit of God began to touch
[2:02:11] that
[2:02:14] I went into Andy and told that story and
[2:02:16] there was a girl sitting in there she
[2:02:18] fell out in the aisle when I quoted the
[2:02:21] scripture Matthew 12 25 49 believe isn't
[2:02:23] it hell was created for the Devil's
[2:02:25] Angels when I said that
[2:02:27] she fell out in the floor Riley just
[2:02:30] literally like a snake crawling on the
[2:02:32] floor
[2:02:33] later they the deacons had to come and
[2:02:35] get her they took her out and then later
[2:02:37] brought her up she just she was a street
[2:02:40] lady she didn't know anything about
[2:02:41] religion she just seen the sign coming
[2:02:43] to come in the meeting they brought the
[2:02:46] lady up into the prayer line and she
[2:02:47] singed again common the minute I put my
[2:02:50] hand on her same thing that demon
[2:02:52] manifestation started coming out
[2:02:53] now them brothers in India they didn't
[2:02:55] mess with that Spirit about 20 of them
[2:02:57] gathered around wouldn't let it out of
[2:02:58] the prayer line they just gathered
[2:03:00] around the thing and we began to pray
[2:03:01] and the minute the thing hit the ground
[2:03:03] the woman just right on the ground and
[2:03:06] when she got up she was sane and
[2:03:09] sensible
[2:03:10] completely a different woman
[2:03:13] from a demonic depressed woman
[2:03:16] and stood up completely in a right mind
[2:03:18] in an instant
[2:03:19] because the spirit left her
[2:03:24] the spirit that was doing that to her
[2:03:26] left her in the name of Jesus Christ one
[2:03:30] of the most amazing things
[2:03:32] four or five people behind that girl was
[2:03:35] an older lady real kind looking lady she
[2:03:37] come in the prayer line through the
[2:03:39] translator she says I have high blood
[2:03:41] pressure would you pray for me I started
[2:03:43] praying for her and I had my eyes closed
[2:03:45] and I'm praying and all of a sudden I
[2:03:47] feel something kicking at my shins and
[2:03:49] hitting in my hands I opened my eyes and
[2:03:52] this kind old lady has turned into a
[2:03:54] demon manifestation her tongue sticking
[2:03:57] out just like a stick out of her mouth
[2:03:58] her eyes are rolled back and she's
[2:04:00] screaming at me and squalling and
[2:04:02] kicking it and then now guys this was on
[2:04:04] film some words we still have it
[2:04:05] somewhere I don't remember where it's at
[2:04:06] now but in some words I still have this
[2:04:08] we got it on film and she was doing all
[2:04:10] this well I didn't know so he starts
[2:04:13] praying for the lady I mean I thought
[2:04:14] she had high blood pressure so we
[2:04:16] started playing for the lady and the
[2:04:18] spirit starts manifesting and we pray
[2:04:20] for her and prayed for in a minute
[2:04:22] she dropped right on the floor just like
[2:04:24] the other lady but when she woke up that
[2:04:28] same Spirit was there we pray for prayed
[2:04:31] for prayed for in a minute there she
[2:04:33] went again
[2:04:34] she woke up the Same Spirit was on her
[2:04:37] in a minute I'm looking I just backed
[2:04:39] off kind of backed off and I know the
[2:04:41] brothers were watching me and I backed
[2:04:43] off and I just started looking at her
[2:04:44] funny and I started praying and I said
[2:04:45] Lord what's going on here
[2:04:47] and and just a millisecond
[2:04:51] he said do you remember the maniac in
[2:04:53] Oregon
[2:04:56] they said brother Branham is the man
[2:04:58] delivered he said no he said he's passed
[2:05:01] out in the spirit
[2:05:03] but when he awakes he'll have it because
[2:05:05] he worships the spirit
[2:05:08] so I let I told him to take the woman on
[2:05:11] we finished the prayer line that night
[2:05:13] the pastor the host Pastor came to me he
[2:05:15] said brother Lawson what happened in
[2:05:17] that meeting that you turned and prayed
[2:05:19] and then you put the woman out and then
[2:05:20] you kept praying he said what did God
[2:05:22] speak to you I said he told me she
[2:05:24] worships the spirit leave it alone let
[2:05:26] it go on pray for the people he said the
[2:05:28] same thing happened to me four or five
[2:05:30] years ago on a Prayer Line same woman he
[2:05:32] said God told me the same thing he said
[2:05:34] I'd always wondered what was going on
[2:05:36] but the spirit of God began began to
[2:05:39] move
[2:05:40] amen
[2:05:41] in in Bombay India the brother that
[2:05:44] hosted the meetings has just passed away
[2:05:45] I came into a school building you
[2:05:47] probably heard me tell it I came into a
[2:05:50] school building to hold a meeting
[2:05:51] and when I come in that beat the school
[2:05:53] building in India that sometimes they
[2:05:55] don't have the money for a church so
[2:05:56] they hold it in the school building so
[2:05:58] we go in the school building they got
[2:05:59] all these Hindu gods like you got that
[2:06:01] on the wall they'll have posters but
[2:06:03] they're Hindu gods because it's a Hindu
[2:06:05] government and they had these Gods these
[2:06:07] poster boards all over the wall in
[2:06:09] behind me when I walked in the room
[2:06:10] first thing I said was could y'all take
[2:06:12] them down so I can preach in here I'm
[2:06:14] going to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[2:06:16] Christ I don't want these things behind
[2:06:17] me they said brother Wayne we can't
[2:06:19] touch anything he said we can use the
[2:06:20] building that's all I said well let it
[2:06:23] be whatever it is we'll preach the
[2:06:24] gospel so they filled the room up
[2:06:26] literally it was just a packed place
[2:06:28] there was there was preachers about oh I
[2:06:30] don't maybe 15 20 of them and they were
[2:06:33] they were about as far as from here to
[2:06:34] the wall from me sitting on the side
[2:06:36] like this and the congregation was here
[2:06:37] and the place was just packed three four
[2:06:40] five hundred people probably at least
[2:06:42] 500 and they were packed in there well
[2:06:44] in the middle of the sermon I was
[2:06:46] preaching about the absolute of God I'll
[2:06:48] never forget it I was preaching about
[2:06:50] the absolute of God a caterpillar when
[2:06:52] he goes up the tree there's something
[2:06:55] that is absolute tells him he has to do
[2:06:57] it see God created the butterfly not a
[2:06:59] caterpillar right
[2:07:01] so God said he'd be a butterfly so one
[2:07:03] day he starts wanting to be a butterfly
[2:07:04] something comes over him
[2:07:07] and he says I don't want to climb the
[2:07:08] tree but something says you're going to
[2:07:11] climb the tree
[2:07:12] he said I don't want to get a factory
[2:07:13] but there's a thus saith the Lord
[2:07:16] that forces him to a cocoon and when I
[2:07:20] said that I said in the absolute of gods
[2:07:22] in this building tonight
[2:07:23] and I started preaching about the
[2:07:25] absolute of the almighty God and when I
[2:07:27] spoke concerning the absolute of God
[2:07:29] again woman falls out in the aisle
[2:07:31] literally just falls out in the island
[2:07:33] this is a totally different meeting
[2:07:34] total different city one just falls out
[2:07:36] in the aisle at first at first honest to
[2:07:39] goodness I thought she was getting a
[2:07:40] blessing I thought well the woman's got
[2:07:41] under the spirit but then I felt the
[2:07:43] spirit it was on Earth
[2:07:45] it was a real creepy thing and it
[2:07:48] started coming up the aisle and the
[2:07:50] spirit of the Lord now of course I was
[2:07:51] young I just started preaching I just
[2:07:53] started and I think it was my first or
[2:07:55] second trip to India and the spirit of
[2:07:58] the lord gave me the scripture when I
[2:07:59] went over there Bands To End season and
[2:08:02] preaching preached the word Timothy
[2:08:04] remember that so the minute that all
[2:08:06] this is happening I'm thinking what do I
[2:08:07] do I just preach the word so I just kept
[2:08:10] preaching kept preaching kept preaching
[2:08:12] and then the Lord checked me he said
[2:08:13] pray for the woman so I stopped there's
[2:08:16] a brother standing back there a pastor
[2:08:17] and he kind of cut across I said brother
[2:08:19] and bow your heads congregation bow your
[2:08:21] heads let's pray the woman's having a
[2:08:23] problem here let's pray and ask God to
[2:08:25] deliver the woman and when I bow my head
[2:08:27] I started praying they were praying
[2:08:29] everybody were praying and when we got
[2:08:31] done praying I I lifted my head and
[2:08:33] brother Samuel I was going to continue
[2:08:35] preaching I was going to go right back
[2:08:37] into my sermon I lifted my head and when
[2:08:39] I started I don't remember what I was
[2:08:41] going to say but this is I started to
[2:08:42] say something I heard myself say if the
[2:08:46] woman don't rise up from the ground God
[2:08:48] is not even God
[2:08:50] why they recovered my mouth
[2:08:53] I'm serious it scared me what who says
[2:08:55] something dumb like that God ain't even
[2:08:58] God's God no matter what happens right
[2:09:01] right but it wasn't me that said it
[2:09:03] right and the moment when I said that
[2:09:05] just in that instant
[2:09:07] there was a fog a mislike just started
[2:09:10] filling the room now I don't understand
[2:09:12] it someday someday if you would get to
[2:09:14] Glory we'll ask God what it was but it
[2:09:16] was like a like a mist and fog filled
[2:09:18] the room this is what those pastors said
[2:09:21] they said brother Wayne we couldn't see
[2:09:23] you no more it's like you almost
[2:09:25] disappeared in a fog upon the platform
[2:09:27] and when that happened there was a wind
[2:09:29] started blowing in the room and when the
[2:09:32] wind started blowing that woman stood up
[2:09:35] the whole congregation started rejoicing
[2:09:37] and this wind goes
[2:09:39] and brother when we turn around and look
[2:09:41] those posters have been ripped off of
[2:09:44] that wall and they're laying on the
[2:09:46] floor this woman standing up the power
[2:09:49] of God is in the building because
[2:09:51] nothing can stand in the presence of
[2:09:54] Jesus Christ

[2:33:51] made the promise to them
[2:33:53] that you shall be endued with Spirit
[2:33:56] from on high that was the promise and
[2:33:59] the Bible said they went and began to
[2:34:02] Rejoice before the Holy Spirit ever
[2:34:04] failed because anything that God says is
[2:34:08] sure
[2:34:10] every promise that God has made and he's
[2:34:13] Vindicated to you tonight there's not a
[2:34:16] devil big enough that can stand against
[2:34:18] it or take it away

[2:34:44] the flesh for a long time
[2:34:46] Hallelujah we confess the promise of God
[2:34:50] how many remember that time when that
[2:34:53] man was looking at the screen and the
[2:34:55] nurse came in and like that testimony
[2:34:57] brother Wayne was given they kept on
[2:34:59] testifying and saying God's already
[2:35:01] healed us and that nurse it wasn't the
[2:35:04] nurse it was a spirit that was trying to
[2:35:07] discourage him and it said oh you don't
[2:35:09] know what you're talking about as far as
[2:35:11] medically she knew more about the
[2:35:13] situation but what they knew is the god
[2:35:16] who's above every situation had already
[2:35:18] addressed that need and he said what
[2:35:21] you're looking at is your instruments he
[2:35:23] said but we're looking at a Divine
[2:35:25] promise that God made for us I'll tell
[2:35:28] you tonight we're not looking at a
[2:35:30] church we are looking at witnessing the
[2:35:33] resurrected Lord Jesus
[2:35:35] right here Among Us I tell you the
[2:35:38] water's troubled tonight it's time to
[2:35:40] step right into it and take every
[2:35:43] promise that belongs to us This Is War
[2:35:47] This Is War how many say This Is War
[2:35:50] amen it's declaring war on Satan's
[2:35:53] kingdom his Kingdom's coming down

[2:39:44] Hallelujah
[2:39:47] glory be to God
[2:39:51] and say it clear tonight the devil's not
[2:39:53] our buddy he's not our friend who's not
[2:39:54] to be an occupant
[2:39:56] and I tell you what the spirit of God is
[2:39:58] set right from the very beginning in
[2:40:00] this meeting
[2:40:01] I'll tell you I'll tell you it's a
[2:40:03] really privilege as a young person but
[2:40:05] for every one of us in here
[2:40:07] but as a young person it's one of the
[2:40:10] first things
[2:40:11] we can recognize that of how the devil
[2:40:14] will try to use your mind
[2:40:16] and you know he'll come to you and you
[2:40:18] hear it in your own voice
[2:40:20] and that's why the devil then will play
[2:40:22] upon that and say well see that's you
[2:40:24] because it's in your voice but he's a
[2:40:27] liar
[2:40:29] because you can judge it by the desire
[2:40:31] that's in your heart there is a
[2:40:34] repulsion against that Spirit that's not
[2:40:36] how I want to be that's not who I am and
[2:40:39] so you're standing against it and this
[2:40:42] is why we always want to take our stand
[2:40:44] with the word of God because it's clear
[2:40:46] every time that the enemy comes you can
[2:40:48] always judge that spirit it's always
[2:40:50] there to try to tear you down to cast
[2:40:52] you down to bring you down to hold you
[2:40:54] down that's what he wants to do
[2:40:56] but the spirit of God is here to lift
[2:40:58] you up
[2:41:05] that you can walk in and receive every
[2:41:07] promise
[2:41:08] you you know and the wonderful thing
[2:41:10] about it is is that we don't have to
[2:41:11] carry the cross we don't have to bear
[2:41:13] the stripes we don't have to do nothing
[2:41:14] but accept what he's already done
[2:41:18] and I think it's so wonderful and so
[2:41:20] awesome of a mighty God that would come
[2:41:22] right on the scene right here tonight
[2:41:23] and would challenge that devil and let
[2:41:26] it be known that the only thing that's
[2:41:29] holding us back is a spirit
[2:41:33] Hallelujah but that spirit's been Cast
[2:41:35] Away
[2:41:36] you hearing me that spirit's been Cast
[2:41:38] Away now what do I do get that place
[2:41:40] filled with God and you and I are
[2:41:43] responsible just like if you get a room
[2:41:44] in your house or your bedroom you get a
[2:41:46] you know you get a drawer cleared out or
[2:41:48] you get something then that's an empty
[2:41:50] space right you got rid of some stuff
[2:41:52] now you gotta fill it with good stuff
[2:41:55] you fill it with the word of God you
[2:41:57] invite the word in you see many times
[2:41:59] we're waiting on things while I'm
[2:42:01] waiting on this feeling no wait on what
[2:42:02] God has spoke to you personally God has
[2:42:05] spoken to you right here in this meeting
[2:42:06] how many have witnessed God has spoke to
[2:42:08] me in this meeting
[2:42:10] young people you Witnesses of that God
[2:42:12] spoke to me then as God has spoke to you
[2:42:15] he has anointed you because that spirit
[2:42:18] is Cast Away no matter what that Spirit
[2:42:20] was it's been cast away because Almighty
[2:42:23] conqueror has come on the scene and he's
[2:42:24] anointed your heart to stand and believe
[2:42:27] that now let your life be filled let it
[2:42:29] be filled with the word of God just take
[2:42:31] the word of God and fill your life with
[2:42:33] the word of God because in the word of
[2:42:35] God Is Power
[2:42:36] and a confession of what the Holy Spirit
[2:42:39] brought right here the this this right
[2:42:41] here today of a confession is very
[2:42:44] powerful
[2:42:45] so when God has touched your life just
[2:42:47] like when it was mentioned right here if
[2:42:49] salvation has come to your door then
[2:42:51] right here at this very moment you start
[2:42:54] with a confession that I am saved
[2:42:57] I am saved and you keep confession it
[2:43:00] and you watch your body will obey that
[2:43:03] confession because what you are
[2:43:06] confessing is the work of a money
[2:43:07] conqueror who has come and made
[2:43:09] something real to you of what he's done
[2:43:12] for you so what your confession is not
[2:43:14] empty words it might seem like it
[2:43:16] sometimes but it's what God has done for
[2:43:18] you and you watch your life start
[2:43:20] matching what you're confessing is the
[2:43:23] power of a confession amen he's the high
[2:43:26] priest of our confession it's the same
[2:43:28] way with our healing same way with our
[2:43:31] healing you know you know you know what
[2:43:33] maybe tomorrow morning you might feel
[2:43:35] bad your feelings don't have nothing to
[2:43:37] do with it
[2:43:38] there's going to be days you feel like a
[2:43:40] Christian in days you don't feel like a
[2:43:41] Christian but you're it is not based on
[2:43:43] your feelings it's based on the
[2:43:45] all-sufficient work of the Lord Jesus
[2:43:47] Christ what he's done in your life and
[2:43:49] you know it by the desire that's in your
[2:43:51] heart so what I do feed it with the
[2:43:54] right things
[2:43:55] feed your life feed your experience with
[2:43:57] the right things amen watch God continue
[2:44:00] to move
[2:44:01] amen you know what God has come and said
[2:44:03] here in this meeting I'm with you I'm
[2:44:06] with you I've been with you the whole
[2:44:08] time as a matter of fact there's no way
[2:44:10] that a man could stand right here even
[2:44:12] if he was sitting in this assembly for
[2:44:15] months there's no man that could stand
[2:44:17] right there and go right down the very
[2:44:19] thoughts of your heart and begin to
[2:44:21] uncover things but I'll tell you what
[2:44:23] the lovely Lord Jesus did
[2:44:25] he went right down and began to minister
[2:44:28] and you know what he was saying I've
[2:44:29] been with you the whole time matter of
[2:44:31] fact I've been the one you've been
[2:44:32] bumping into
[2:44:34] you've been bumping into me
[2:44:35] [Applause]
[2:44:37] into me so you know I'm the one that
[2:44:39] you've been bumping into I'm the one
[2:44:41] that's also been coming to you and
[2:44:42] bringing conviction in your heart about
[2:44:44] things in your life what's he doing he's
[2:44:46] letting us know of his faithfulness and
[2:44:48] his mercifulness and his loving kindness
[2:44:50] and if God will do that when we don't
[2:44:52] deserve it how much more will we reach
[2:44:54] out and take a promise of God and say
[2:44:56] Lord I'll take you at your word Lord how
[2:44:58] much more
[2:45:00] oh I tell you when we are serving the
[2:45:03] Living God the Mighty God aren't you

[2:45:55] it that God he thinks so much of you
[2:45:57] that God would come right down along the
[2:46:00] way and begin to uncover things and and
[2:46:02] give you Victory these are things right

[2:46:07] your Christian journey and you can pull
[2:46:10] it out and whip the devil on every day
