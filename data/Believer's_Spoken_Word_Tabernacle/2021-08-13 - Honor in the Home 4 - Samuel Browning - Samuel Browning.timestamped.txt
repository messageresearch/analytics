[36:24] we just have
[36:27] been in contact today with
[36:29] sister um
[36:31] cindy or cynthia soriano and she had
[36:35] just
[36:35] just been in contact back and forth with
[36:38] her regarding brother o'elle
[36:41] both of them had
[36:43] come down with
[36:45] sickness virus whatever we want to
[36:48] call it or refer to it as
[36:52] and sister cindy she's doing she's doing
[36:54] much better but brother owell i just
[36:57] he's um
[36:58] he's at the hospital and so we want to
[37:01] just remember
[37:02] our brother in prayer he needs a real
[37:05] he needs a touch from the lord
[37:07] and
[37:09] i know there's
[37:10] others at times that there's other needs
[37:13] that's that's out there as well and so
[37:15] um
[37:16] we want to just i told sister cynthia i
[37:18] just told her just moments ago that we
[37:20] would just just take brother owell
[37:23] before the throne of god we've been
[37:26] praying throughout the day
[37:27] and
[37:28] you know how sometimes things are in
[37:30] other places they're not even the same
[37:32] as they are here
[37:34] and so um but irregardless
[37:37] as we've said over and over nothing has
[37:39] taken god by surprise
[37:43] nothing has taken god by surprise
[37:45] and god is is over every
[37:48] situation
[37:50] and we're here tonight we're standing
[37:52] here
[37:53] because of his grace
[37:55] and it's his grace that's given us
[37:57] promises that when we've been in need
[38:00] it's god's grace that's given us
[38:01] promises that we can take a promise and
[38:04] hold to that promise
[38:06] despite every situation and whatever is
[38:08] going around
[38:10] we can hold to that promise
[38:12] sometimes there's situations and things
[38:14] that arise sometimes and no matter what
[38:16] it can be sometimes a person can get a
[38:18] report
[38:19] from the doctor's office and that report
[38:22] that comes in it can
[38:25] it can kind of give you a blow
[38:27] and uh
[38:28] you know brother ben would brother brown
[38:30] when he would tell us even when it comes
[38:32] to healing he said
[38:34] it starts out with the right mental
[38:36] attitude
[38:38] and brother branham would he would go
[38:40] into that and say
[38:42] you know mayo clinic would come behind
[38:43] and say brother brown that's absolutely
[38:45] truth
[38:46] the attitude that a patient takes when
[38:48] they receive that news
[38:50] is what really will determine
[38:53] some of the outcomes
[38:55] brother branham he he goes on to say it
[38:57] like this he said if taking the right
[38:59] mental attitude
[39:01] can actually take
[39:02] a condition in a body
[39:04] and just
[39:06] bring it right in
[39:08] subjection and though it may never leave
[39:10] the body through the right just the
[39:11] right mental attitude brother graham
[39:13] said how much greater if it falls back
[39:15] into that subconscious then it's gone
[39:19] but either way
[39:21] it takes grace to have the right mental
[39:23] attitude
[39:25] and we just want to approach the throne
[39:27] of god right now
[39:30] on behalf of our brother
[39:32] and also some of you probably know i
[39:34] don't know if the prayer request i
[39:35] didn't get the sound back there right
[39:36] away but
[39:38] sister patsy
[39:39] and they just lost
[39:41] her mother here today we just got a call
[39:45] right before church

[44:26] oh god just take the lord your word and
[44:28] just speak to our hearts now
[44:30] in the name of jesus christ
[44:34] amen and amen
[44:36] amen amen god bless you let's let's look
[44:39] here in the scriptures in first
[44:41] corinthians 13.
[44:53] first corinthians 13
[44:56] and if we could just for the sake of
[44:58] time i'm gonna
[44:59] i want to go right to verse four and
[45:01] we're just remember we're drawing
[45:04] from this of charity and where paul had
[45:06] went through in the very first three
[45:08] verses there's a
[45:10] there's a lot of great things or
[45:12] accolades or a lot of things that would
[45:14] be
[45:15] visible that could be done the moving of
[45:19] mountains
[45:20] giving to the poor
[45:22] even one giving their body to be burned
[45:24] i mean that would be something you would
[45:26] think wow what a
[45:28] what a great sacrifice but but paul
[45:30] brings
[45:31] all of these things that could be done
[45:34] and paul as though it just to remove it
[45:37] back and say
[45:38] what's behind it all
[45:40] because everything that we do
[45:43] god is not looking at what's done it's
[45:46] what's behind it
[45:48] it's what's behind it and this is where
[45:50] that real true greatness
[45:53] is the love of god on display that's
[45:55] that's true greatness it
[45:58] so when we bring it on down
[46:01] a person may
[46:03] you know you might say brother samuel
[46:04] what gift do i have in my life or what
[46:06] do i have to offer what
[46:08] the greatest thing that you have to
[46:10] offer
[46:11] is your life to the lord
[46:14] because you might never you might never
[46:16] maybe you you might never preach the
[46:18] gospel you may not sing specials or you
[46:21] might
[46:23] but you're used as a vessel that the
[46:25] love of god could be displayed through
[46:28] so
[46:29] i think it's fitting in this time that
[46:31] we look at
[46:33] when brother branham would speak of how
[46:34] remember he would tell us in the message
[46:36] look
[46:37] and he would he would give us a word of
[46:39] caution
[46:40] that the unfolding of this word in this
[46:43] hour he said don't go to thinking that
[46:46] you're going to walk into hospitals and
[46:48] they're going to be emptied out
[46:50] that's not what's going to happen
[46:53] but he's dealing with the love of god
[46:56] that would be on display
[46:58] in our life and i i look in the
[47:00] scriptures where when it speaks of the
[47:02] building
[47:03] in the restoration in the building of
[47:05] the tabernacle and the scripture says
[47:08] who
[47:09] hath despised the day
[47:13] of small things
[47:15] because remember it's small things
[47:17] that lead to greater things
[47:20] it's small little foxes
[47:22] that spoil the vine so
[47:24] the greatness real greatness is the
[47:26] display of the love of god i believe
[47:28] we're we're in agreement with that
[47:30] verse four
[47:31] charity suffereth law
[47:34] and is kind
[47:36] charity envieth not
[47:38] fonteth not itself and
[47:40] it's not puffed up
[47:43] it does not behave itself
[47:46] unseemly
[47:48] seeketh not her own
[47:50] is not easily provoked and thinketh
[47:53] no evil
[47:54] may god bless the reading of his word as
[47:56] you're being seated
[47:59] i'd say as we visit this over and over
[48:01] again and how god just would continue to
[48:04] guide us through this part i i would
[48:06] venture to say that without a shadow of
[48:08] a doubt that
[48:09] in each of the times that we have to
[48:11] come back to
[48:13] different parts in our life and things
[48:16] to wear that
[48:17] it might be
[48:19] a moment a day a week or sometime later
[48:22] in different times that we can always
[48:24] come around
[48:25] and the spirit of god when the spirit of
[48:27] the lord dwells within our life
[48:30] that's the love of god
[48:32] and the love of god will always it'll
[48:34] bring real conviction to our life
[48:36] that even how things were
[48:38] done or conducted or even in our
[48:41] behavior because
[48:43] the reality is is that the desire that
[48:45] we would have as a child of god is that
[48:48] our lives would would be in such harmony
[48:51] with him
[48:52] that we want to be in such a way it
[48:55] would be like if if this microphone here
[48:57] or the microphone i have on and
[48:59] sometimes some of you you've known this
[49:01] when you've been here that every once in
[49:03] a while i have to have this cord
[49:04] replaced that goes from the mic
[49:06] into the belt pack because sometimes
[49:09] that cord gets a little weak and it
[49:11] starts making static and pop pop pop pop
[49:13] popping even though i can speak through
[49:15] the microphone we could continue on with
[49:17] service but that pop pop pop pop pop
[49:20] would become a little bit
[49:23] bothersome
[49:24] you'd say
[49:25] just switch microphones so that you can
[49:27] be
[49:28] you can just focus on what's being said
[49:30] in other words to remove every
[49:32] distraction from around our life and and
[49:34] that's what the spirit of god that's
[49:36] even when god comes and deals with our
[49:38] life to correct us
[49:40] god comes to correct us so that our
[49:42] lives might be
[49:44] without any distraction just a channel a
[49:47] vessel that's open and it's surrendered
[49:49] to him
[49:50] and i i look at this here with with our
[49:54] our our our behavior and we've been
[49:56] looking at it in this manner
[49:58] and rather than just saying that love
[50:01] does not behave itself rudely but rather
[50:04] taking the the focus on of how that love
[50:07] is one is that which really it seeks
[50:11] to honor even when honor itself may not
[50:15] even be
[50:16] uh something that you could say is due
[50:19] to a person or due to something but yet
[50:22] love itself is what governs our lives to
[50:25] even as we gave certain examples of you
[50:28] know brother branham and i could have
[50:30] more to share of things that how that it
[50:32] wasn't brother branham it's the love of
[50:34] god as brother brown himself allowed the
[50:36] love of god to have the preeminence in
[50:39] his life and to see
[50:41] that was that was with the purpose so
[50:43] that god
[50:44] might continue to move and to work and
[50:47] deal with his life and it wasn't just
[50:49] about so that his ministry brother
[50:51] branham's desire was never that the
[50:53] ministry would be big brother braham's
[50:55] desire was always that jesus christ
[50:58] would be glorified
[51:00] that was the whole purpose brother brown
[51:02] never wanted i mean if you really
[51:04] consider it they could have had the
[51:06] biggest building in the world and
[51:07] nothing wrong with a big building they
[51:09] could have had a building that would
[51:11] have outshined and anything else that
[51:13] could have been and i'm talking about
[51:14] after things started moving along the
[51:16] round but you realize that was never the
[51:19] focus you come to the very end there in
[51:21] the i love it in the resume of the
[51:23] church ages and they put it there right
[51:25] inside the the sleeve of the tape case
[51:28] and they put that paragraph there and
[51:30] when brother ram says there's one desire
[51:32] that i've had not for one moment he said
[51:34] have i wanted people that they would
[51:36] follow me or to start an organization
[51:39] but he said i've strove for one thing
[51:40] and that's that that man and woman might
[51:43] have a true relationship with jesus
[51:46] christ and by that become new creatures
[51:50] in christ jesus and i i'll say that
[51:52] that's the love of god that was been
[51:54] projected in this generation
[51:57] so when the message when we talk about
[51:59] the message i believe this with all my
[52:02] heart the message that god has sent in
[52:04] this hour
[52:06] is a display and a projecting of the
[52:09] love of god that overthrows bitterness
[52:13] it overthrows malice it overthrows all
[52:16] the you say brother samuel how can you
[52:18] say it because it's the word of god and
[52:20] there's nothing can stand before the
[52:24] word of god
[52:26] it overcomes think about your life and
[52:28] my life before the love of god come to
[52:31] us we were in the bitterness of bondage
[52:35] we were in the bitterness of life but
[52:38] the love of god come to you and i to
[52:41] draw us to bring us to lead us out of
[52:45] bitterness into the love of god
[52:48] so what overcame bitterness the love of
[52:50] god
[52:51] there's nothing as great as the love of
[52:54] god that's why solomon could write in
[52:56] the song of solomon that
[52:58] you know if a man would try to give all
[53:00] his substance for it it doesn't even
[53:02] measure up to whatever it is there's
[53:05] nothing floods cannot overthrow it you
[53:08] love the love of god is so great it's
[53:11] it's so great and so precious and so
[53:14] when we look at this and we've been
[53:16] dealing with this thought of honor in
[53:18] the home and i want to just jump right
[53:20] back in here and move a little bit
[53:21] further here this this this evening
[53:24] and thinking remember in the parallels
[53:27] we're looking at this that this is a
[53:29] parallel of christ and the bride and the
[53:32] husband and wife and within the home in
[53:35] verse 21 it says submitting yourselves
[53:37] one to another
[53:39] in the fear of god wives submit
[53:43] yourselves unto
[53:45] your own husbands
[53:47] as unto the lord
[53:49] that didn't say just to any man but unto
[53:52] your husband
[53:53] and think of think now in the spiritual
[53:57] to what who is our husband the lord
[53:59] jesus christ and he is what the word
[54:03] so the word itself does not play with
[54:06] emotions the word comes to present
[54:09] itself that i am your all sufficiency i
[54:13] am all that you have need of i am here
[54:16] to provide for you
[54:19] is that what the word does
[54:21] and so what what when the word is being
[54:23] preached
[54:24] it's not an idea it's not a personality
[54:28] when the word is being ministered it is
[54:31] the husband our lord jesus christ that's
[54:34] being ministered that's where it was as
[54:37] the body itself was growing down through
[54:39] the ages feet legs pies on and on and on
[54:43] it's god building his body through what
[54:47] upon this rock i will build my church
[54:51] what is the rock the revelation of
[54:53] himself
[54:54] who is he the word our husband
[54:57] so it is that part of it this is why
[55:00] brother brahm could say in christ a
[55:02] mystery he said the secrets that he's
[55:04] revealing not to flirters but to those
[55:08] that genuine that that have a desire to
[55:12] know god his wife his children that's
[55:16] the ones that god reveals himself to
[55:21] so what a privileged people we are
[55:24] wives submit yourself so as we're going
[55:27] to come back to this and i want to just
[55:28] i i really want to hit this part as
[55:31] we're looking at it last week the word
[55:33] here in submit notice wives submit
[55:35] yourself this is not a forced
[55:39] of forced doing at all
[55:42] we are not here because we're forced to
[55:44] be here
[55:47] we're not
[55:49] but what it is it says wife submit
[55:51] yourself so the submission is actually
[55:54] it's not the husband's doing it's the
[55:56] wife's doing to watch is before her
[56:00] she's submitting herself unto the
[56:03] husband it's not a demand it's not a
[56:06] command it's not a it's not well you
[56:08] have to do that's not what it is at all
[56:12] are you with me
[56:14] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[56:16] husbands as unto the lord so as we were
[56:20] kind of looking at that last week as
[56:22] unto the lord so even when things
[56:24] himself seems to be hard
[56:27] as unto the lord that's why paul could
[56:29] say with servants and masters and other
[56:32] things we can apply in life when it
[56:34] seems to be hard remember as unto the
[56:37] lord
[56:38] it is as unto the lord so here if we
[56:41] could pull that definition up with
[56:43] submit
[56:44] and submit itself is to subject oneself
[56:48] to submit to one's control to yield to
[56:51] one's admonition or advice to obey
[56:55] to be subject so
[56:57] it's a in in a non-military part of it i
[56:59] want to bring this in it's a voluntary
[57:02] attitude of giving in cooperating
[57:06] assuming responsibility and carrying a
[57:09] burden
[57:12] now
[57:13] when brother brandon was here he
[57:15] referred to a quote about completely
[57:16] surrender do you recall that
[57:20] where you have someone who wrote in a in
[57:22] in a question that said brothers brother
[57:23] branham
[57:24] brother brown i i just can't i can't
[57:27] seem to completely surrender to the lord
[57:29] jesus brother braham doesn't know if
[57:30] it's man or woman but brother brahma
[57:32] here as he begins to take the direction
[57:34] as though as it's a woman and brother
[57:36] branham writes it and he's his response
[57:38] was and he he parallels it of how that a
[57:42] woman would would give herself
[57:45] to her husband and brother i don't have
[57:47] this up there but let me just refer to
[57:48] it he says if you're a woman don't you
[57:51] have to surrender to your husband to be
[57:53] a wife surrender all you are a little
[57:56] lady when you're married virtuous fought
[57:58] all your life to stay virtuous but one
[58:01] day you found a man that you love you
[58:04] were com his completely the things that
[58:07] you'd fought against all your life and
[58:09] tried to live clean and clear and
[58:10] virtuous now you surrender every bit of
[58:13] it to him you put yourself completely in
[58:17] his hands notice what he says you put
[58:20] yourself completely
[58:22] in his hands
[58:24] he says you are his see that's that's
[58:26] what coming to the new birth the new
[58:28] birth cannot come without complete
[58:30] surrender
[58:32] god doesn't for it the holy ghost is not
[58:34] a forced thing that god gets somebody in
[58:36] a headlock and they say mercy i submit
[58:39] no that's that's not what it is
[58:42] god god can deal with the life then
[58:44] maybe they're kind of stubborn and
[58:45] hard-headed and god just starts taking
[58:47] things out of the way you know starts
[58:49] taking out feathers out of that because
[58:51] if we're comfortable in the life that
[58:54] we're in that's a problem
[58:56] but god knows what to do to get our
[58:58] attentions to where we surrender to him
[59:03] that's what the whole preaching of the
[59:04] gospel is about it's not about a
[59:06] commitment sign a card be here on
[59:08] thursday be here on sunday that's not
[59:11] what it is it's a surrendered life that
[59:13] then as brother brahms says he brings
[59:16] his life in and now he lives his life
[59:21] through your
[59:23] your life
[59:24] so that what others see
[59:26] they can see the same old temple but
[59:29] what they're beholding is that you're
[59:32] not the same person you used to be
[59:35] you don't go along with the same things
[59:37] your appetites and all those things are
[59:39] different what's happened to you you've
[59:42] received another spirit
[59:45] are you with me you've been united with
[59:48] that part of christ of where you always
[59:52] belong to him but now that spirit that
[59:55] part of the original spirit has come and
[59:58] sought you out and has brought you to a
[1:00:00] place of surrender so what have you done
[1:00:04] as a bride of jesus christ you have
[1:00:07] submitted yourselves unto him
[1:00:11] glory this is why it's not a church it's
[1:00:14] not a personality it's not an idea it's
[1:00:17] not a movement it's jesus christ
[1:00:22] amen the rest of the stuff it'll never
[1:00:25] work it can religion religion it
[1:00:28] religion is only a covering it never
[1:00:30] brings relationship
[1:00:35] you put yourself completely in his hands
[1:00:38] you are his all that you have stood for
[1:00:40] in decency and morale and everything
[1:00:42] like that you turn over to a man because
[1:00:44] you surrender yourself to that man he
[1:00:46] says can't you do the same thing to
[1:00:48] jesus christ just surrender yourself
[1:00:50] that way all that i am all my mind all
[1:00:54] my thoughts
[1:00:57] so when we look at this let me just read
[1:01:00] here a portion from where we were we
[1:01:02] were at and then we're going to move on
[1:01:04] here uh
[1:01:05] even a little more tonight but out of
[1:01:07] the satire and church age and brother
[1:01:10] adam is bringing this in here and he
[1:01:12] says now a woman is not meant to have an
[1:01:15] iron disposition
[1:01:17] she is according to the holy scripture
[1:01:21] to be submissive to the male that's
[1:01:24] commanded of her now remember when you
[1:01:25] see the word command command itself is
[1:01:29] the words that's given for leadership
[1:01:32] is that right jesus said a new
[1:01:34] commandment i write unto you
[1:01:36] he said you did not believe moses how
[1:01:38] shall you believe my words
[1:01:41] what was his words it was the message it
[1:01:43] was the commandments is that right paul
[1:01:45] said let him that is spiritual meaning
[1:01:48] spirit filled born again
[1:01:50] acknowledged that the things that i have
[1:01:52] wrote unto you are the commandments of
[1:01:56] the lord
[1:01:57] so it's remember thinking with this term
[1:01:59] this thought in mind it is not something
[1:02:02] to where we are operating in a manner of
[1:02:04] fear of if i don't do this so i'm not
[1:02:06] going to make it or if i don't know
[1:02:08] it's operating under the divine love of
[1:02:11] god that you desire to please him in
[1:02:15] every way even when there's things that
[1:02:17] are brought to our attention that maybe
[1:02:19] we're not even aware of but the holy
[1:02:22] spirit will bring it to our attention
[1:02:24] and we say yes lord and forgive me we
[1:02:26] quickly turn from that why because we
[1:02:29] are a part of the body of jesus christ
[1:02:32] his wife
[1:02:38] woman who is truly female
[1:02:41] all female
[1:02:42] will be of that disposition now without
[1:02:44] me dealing a lot and going in a lot of
[1:02:46] teaching we all have different
[1:02:47] temperaments
[1:02:50] right melancholy same guy all that we
[1:02:52] got all of us have different
[1:02:53] temperaments david said i'm fearfully
[1:02:55] and wonderfully made
[1:02:57] is that right
[1:02:58] god did not have every one of the
[1:03:00] apostles they were not the same
[1:03:02] paul was different from peter brother
[1:03:04] bram tells us things that ought to be if
[1:03:05] you judge peter by james you'd be in
[1:03:08] problems
[1:03:09] because he said peter was that you know
[1:03:10] it's kind of bolsters james was always
[1:03:12] that you know that quiet and that
[1:03:14] prayerful type and so forth but they
[1:03:16] were used of god according to the
[1:03:17] capacity that god desired to use them
[1:03:19] for
[1:03:21] remember he's jehovah jireh providing
[1:03:23] for himself
[1:03:25] so brothers tell me what are you saying
[1:03:26] that what brother branham is dealing
[1:03:27] with here that god is not desiring
[1:03:30] because as he's made us that we try to
[1:03:32] emulate somebody else or try to be like
[1:03:34] somebody else yet yet paul would write
[1:03:37] through titus of how that the elder men
[1:03:40] that have passed through journeys in
[1:03:42] their life as young men middle-aged men
[1:03:44] and so forth that they are to help the
[1:03:47] young men to teach them to be
[1:03:49] sober-minded also to as husbands an
[1:03:52] example that's live it's not something
[1:03:55] to say ah they're coming on they'll
[1:03:56] figure it out on their own no paul says
[1:03:59] this is a responsibility of the brethren
[1:04:02] in the local assembly oh my
[1:04:06] boy i don't know we're going somewhere
[1:04:08] here
[1:04:09] oh by the same i've done paid my dues
[1:04:11] what was your dues
[1:04:13] i've done raised my children you ain't
[1:04:15] done
[1:04:16] the bible says in the book of
[1:04:17] deuteronomy you're to teach the children
[1:04:20] and thy children's children
[1:04:23] it's not done it's not something where i
[1:04:26] done paid my dues now granted you know
[1:04:28] maybe for those of you that you know
[1:04:30] maybe i'm kind of prophesying of where
[1:04:32] you're at right now you say man with a
[1:04:33] grandchild it's a little bit better you
[1:04:35] know brother samuel i can prophesy and
[1:04:37] send them home you know and deal with
[1:04:38] these these things like this but you
[1:04:40] recognize it never ends it never stops
[1:04:43] and really what is our desire even i
[1:04:46] think here sitting here tonight there's
[1:04:48] some of you that my goodness you've been
[1:04:50] in you serving the lord for so many
[1:04:52] years what a testimony it is to this
[1:04:55] assembly and even as young people it's a
[1:04:58] testimony to this assembly you see the
[1:05:00] encouragement goes back and forth but
[1:05:02] what a testimony in the midst of a time
[1:05:05] in an hour where you see lives that have
[1:05:08] held through thick and thin where
[1:05:10] there's been ups where there's been
[1:05:11] downs you can look across this assembly
[1:05:14] and you know there is tests and trials
[1:05:17] that has been faced that we don't know
[1:05:19] nothing about but they have held to god
[1:05:22] it shows this message works
[1:05:28] it works
[1:05:32] this is why even within titus paul would
[1:05:36] write to how that the women of the
[1:05:39] sisters they would actually be one now
[1:05:42] they're not you know the brethren aren't
[1:05:43] standing up and holding seminars and the
[1:05:45] sisters holding seminars and but there's
[1:05:48] ways to go about things to be an example
[1:05:50] as paul would write this in titus you're
[1:05:53] all with me
[1:05:55] he would write this what is this these
[1:05:56] are things that we can't forget
[1:06:00] where where we've come from
[1:06:02] and even the experiences that we've
[1:06:04] learned that we sow them forward
[1:06:08] i mean i trust by god's grace i when i
[1:06:10] sit down you know with my boys and at
[1:06:13] times you knows we're sitting there as a
[1:06:14] family in the living room or and when
[1:06:16] i'm out with them and i have just the
[1:06:18] time just just with just with them and i
[1:06:20] can tell them i'll say now look i expect
[1:06:23] that there's things i said that even in
[1:06:25] times to come i expect you to learn from
[1:06:28] dad's mistakes
[1:06:31] i hope that's okay
[1:06:33] i said because i have not been perfect
[1:06:35] but i hope you to learn from them that
[1:06:37] things that you can see where dad's been
[1:06:40] right up front and honest with you that
[1:06:42] you can take it and you can sow forward
[1:06:45] these things in coming
[1:06:48] is that right
[1:06:49] this is a responsibility these are
[1:06:51] things i know these are not things that
[1:06:53] we look at and say oh that's real deep
[1:06:55] let me just say this if this message
[1:06:57] does not produce a life outside of
[1:07:00] church then it's no good
[1:07:03] this message is to produce a life not
[1:07:06] just in church many have got that this
[1:07:09] is not a church live this is token
[1:07:13] lifetime
[1:07:15] are you with me it's a life that's to be
[1:07:18] lived outside of these walls
[1:07:22] oh my
[1:07:23] my goodness
[1:07:25] who is a woman who is truly female all
[1:07:27] female will be of that disposition not a
[1:07:30] doormat
[1:07:33] no real male look look take this in real
[1:07:36] real carefully no real male
[1:07:39] makes a female a doormat
[1:07:44] but she will want now notice this he
[1:07:46] will not make
[1:07:48] now but she will want to be under
[1:07:52] authority and not rule over the mail for
[1:07:55] he is the head of the house notice how
[1:07:57] it's placed in here what is governing
[1:08:00] all of this the love of god
[1:08:02] the love of god is what causes where a
[1:08:05] husband does not make a wife a doormat
[1:08:08] because he's treating himself that way
[1:08:12] hello
[1:08:14] neither now look with that that
[1:08:17] governing then it's the love of god that
[1:08:19] here that a wife a woman she'll want to
[1:08:23] be under that authority so it shows
[1:08:25] there's got to be that which created to
[1:08:27] want to desire to be under that
[1:08:30] authority
[1:08:32] that's there
[1:08:34] my goodness
[1:08:36] and i without getting into all of this
[1:08:38] here
[1:08:39] tonight but
[1:08:41] let me just move on because i don't want
[1:08:43] to i i just don't want to dwell with the
[1:08:45] rest of that that portion of the of that
[1:08:47] quote right now
[1:08:49] but there's a responsibility in verse
[1:08:51] 23.
[1:08:53] how many know there's responsibility
[1:08:57] can we say the word responsibility
[1:09:00] that's a big word isn't it
[1:09:02] there's certain things a lot of times we
[1:09:03] want in life and it comes with more
[1:09:05] responsibility
[1:09:07] is that right
[1:09:11] i mean when you know you you want your
[1:09:12] driver's license and then all of a
[1:09:14] sudden you get your driver's license oh
[1:09:16] i gotta pay car insurance
[1:09:19] now i got to help out with gas
[1:09:21] whoo now i got to check the air in the
[1:09:23] tires now
[1:09:24] more responsibility
[1:09:26] there's pleasure but it comes with
[1:09:28] responsibility
[1:09:30] is that right
[1:09:32] and responsibility my goodness
[1:09:34] responsibility is not a bad thing this
[1:09:36] the the the time that we live in the age
[1:09:39] that we live in the world you say
[1:09:40] brother samuel why would you even do it
[1:09:42] because the world itself remember
[1:09:44] we are not wrestling against flesh and
[1:09:46] blood we're wrestling against
[1:09:48] principalities
[1:09:50] there's all things of laws and
[1:09:52] everything else that is against the
[1:09:55] family
[1:09:57] it's against husband and wife it's
[1:09:59] against all this satan would love
[1:10:02] nothing more than to try to come and
[1:10:04] twist that all around it's a spirit it's
[1:10:07] not the people they don't realize what
[1:10:09] they're under
[1:10:12] they don't reckon that's why you feel
[1:10:13] sorry for it that's why when brother
[1:10:15] bram could say in the message shalom
[1:10:17] father forgive them for they know not
[1:10:19] what they do brother brahman says i've
[1:10:21] come to recognize that that people don't
[1:10:24] know what they're doing it's insanity
[1:10:27] because of the darkness that's upon them
[1:10:33] it doesn't mean that we excuse it it
[1:10:35] means that you recognize it's a spirit
[1:10:38] and spirits travel through words they
[1:10:41] travel through all sorts of channels of
[1:10:43] media everything else spirits comes in
[1:10:47] is that right
[1:10:52] it's a responsibility in verse 23
[1:10:56] for the husband
[1:10:59] is the head of the wife even as christ
[1:11:03] is the head
[1:11:04] of the church
[1:11:06] and he is the savior of the body when
[1:11:08] you think of head
[1:11:10] the word head is the same right here in
[1:11:12] the scriptures used in the book of
[1:11:13] colossians throughout it deals with the
[1:11:15] life of the body
[1:11:18] the head is the life of the body the the
[1:11:22] the the headship of the authority but
[1:11:24] notice the husband is the head of the
[1:11:26] wife even as christ is the head of the
[1:11:30] church and he is the savior of the body
[1:11:33] so what does the life bring it brings
[1:11:36] savior to the body
[1:11:38] what is savior savior it's it's a it's a
[1:11:41] saving
[1:11:42] it's a delivering
[1:11:44] it's a preserving it's a providing
[1:11:48] i'm glad that it just don't one time he
[1:11:50] delivers
[1:11:51] but i'm glad like paul said paul said
[1:11:54] when i was in a trial paul identified i
[1:11:56] might not have had lion's breath
[1:11:58] breathing on me but the trout that i was
[1:12:00] in god delivered me out of the mouth
[1:12:03] of the lion
[1:12:06] and paul also said that
[1:12:08] when i'm going through the roughest of
[1:12:10] times he's not away from me it's a time
[1:12:14] of fellowship of his
[1:12:17] sufferings
[1:12:19] oh he's a friend that sticks closer than
[1:12:21] a brother
[1:12:23] glory be to god
[1:12:25] glory be to god
[1:12:27] my i'll tell you i could just stop right
[1:12:29] here and just love him a little bit
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:33] oh when i've been sick and maybe i'm not
[1:12:35] able to do something that i normally
[1:12:37] would be able to do he don't love me any
[1:12:39] less that's the time that he draws me up
[1:12:41] next to him and loves on me a little bit
[1:12:43] more
[1:12:44] i'm not saying brother samuel you were
[1:12:46] sick and you weren't able to stand here
[1:12:48] in the pulpit that don't mean he don't
[1:12:49] love me any less when i'm there and i'm
[1:12:51] sick he's loving on me he's taking me up
[1:12:54] closer to him in that time i need that
[1:12:57] love and that ministry and that care in
[1:12:59] that moment
[1:13:01] what an example
[1:13:03] he is to us
[1:13:09] oh god help us
[1:13:11] he's the savior of the body verse 24.
[1:13:13] now notice 23 was dealing with the
[1:13:16] responsibilities and we're going to move
[1:13:18] into this
[1:13:19] verse 24 is the wife
[1:13:21] yielding to provisions that are made
[1:13:24] available to her
[1:13:26] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:13:30] christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:13:34] husbands
[1:13:35] in
[1:13:36] everything now remember as is fit in the
[1:13:40] lord
[1:13:42] husbands will not ask i'm talking about
[1:13:44] even believing husbands okay
[1:13:46] i i can't even i'm not even in the place
[1:13:49] of dealing with situations of things of
[1:13:51] unbelieving spouses but i'm dealing with
[1:13:53] this aspect of it here because remember
[1:13:55] when brother brown would take that in
[1:13:57] colossians and he would say wives submit
[1:13:59] yourselves unto your husbands as unto
[1:14:02] the lord as is fit in the lord brother
[1:14:04] bram said if if a husband were to ask
[1:14:06] you stop going to church
[1:14:09] you're not disobeying the fedship when
[1:14:12] you say
[1:14:13] i love you and i respect you as my
[1:14:15] husband
[1:14:16] but god is first
[1:14:19] oh i want you to wear these shorts i
[1:14:21] love you and i respect you but god's
[1:14:23] word is above
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:27] so then when we when we look at it in a
[1:14:29] way so then what would it be between a
[1:14:32] believing husband and wife it should
[1:14:34] actually be the display of the word
[1:14:37] because a husband doesn't want to bring
[1:14:39] anything inside of the home or inside of
[1:14:42] that relationship that would not be the
[1:14:44] word on display
[1:14:46] because it's to be submit as unto the
[1:14:49] lord
[1:14:54] so there's an atmosphere now i want you
[1:14:56] to think of this notice how it's went
[1:14:58] back and forth the word submission is
[1:15:00] used here
[1:15:02] within the word subject there is the
[1:15:04] same as the word submission
[1:15:06] i want you to look here in verse 25 and
[1:15:08] i'm just being purposeful in the things
[1:15:10] that i'm saying here in verse 25 i want
[1:15:12] you to look at this atmosphere what's
[1:15:15] been said
[1:15:16] of
[1:15:17] the church it's went back into that
[1:15:19] place in verse 24 the church is subject
[1:15:21] unto christ so let the wives be to their
[1:15:24] own husbands and everything notice the
[1:15:26] next words husbands love your wives even
[1:15:30] as christ also loved the church and gave
[1:15:34] himself for it this is impossible
[1:15:37] without the holy ghost
[1:15:40] because the holy ghost is the love of
[1:15:42] god
[1:15:44] remember brother branham he takes us in
[1:15:45] christ revealed in his own word
[1:15:48] and i'm not going to refer to this to
[1:15:49] make you squirm i'm just going to say it
[1:15:51] in the manner brother brahms dealing
[1:15:53] with it all through the message of how
[1:15:55] the field love and agape love and
[1:15:56] brother i remember he's gathered around
[1:15:58] with brethren
[1:16:00] they're already married they've got
[1:16:01] children and brother bran begins to
[1:16:03] speak speak to them and say
[1:16:05] let's just say
[1:16:07] that before you were married there was
[1:16:09] no engagement there was nothing
[1:16:12] and here you in a dream you dreamed
[1:16:15] concerning this of your wife or you know
[1:16:18] of this young lady and then she comes
[1:16:20] and tells you
[1:16:22] after all this that she could be happy
[1:16:24] with someone else now remember they're
[1:16:26] not married brother bram takes them back
[1:16:28] to where they're not married are you
[1:16:30] with me
[1:16:31] i didn't lose nobody here did i okay
[1:16:33] because i want nobody to think
[1:16:34] no no ain't no loopholes here
[1:16:38] but brother braham is saying in the
[1:16:39] manner when he brings it up there before
[1:16:42] the brethren he's dealing with those
[1:16:44] things and he's saying in this manner
[1:16:48] he's trying to help them to see he says
[1:16:50] what if she said to you
[1:16:52] that she actually could be happier with
[1:16:54] another man i really feel toes curling
[1:16:57] up my toes kind of curling up right now
[1:17:00] then you could you say to her do you now
[1:17:02] what brother bram says do you love her
[1:17:04] well enough to say god's blessings rest
[1:17:07] upon you my dear go with this other man
[1:17:10] are you saying
[1:17:12] where's he
[1:17:14] at brother perry said gonna give him a
[1:17:16] little bit of fivefold
[1:17:20] are you with me
[1:17:22] see i when i when we read these things i
[1:17:24] believe as believers that we don't just
[1:17:26] it's things that we recognize that that
[1:17:28] the prophet being under the
[1:17:30] inspirational holy spirit is giving you
[1:17:32] and i things to that our lives to really
[1:17:35] to really pray about
[1:17:37] he's drawing them those brethren into a
[1:17:39] place he says now look if your love is
[1:17:42] correct you would do that for you are
[1:17:45] interested in her
[1:17:49] welfare
[1:17:51] notice what it's about not you
[1:17:54] her welfare
[1:17:57] oh my
[1:17:59] everybody's still alive right
[1:18:03] if you love her then i want you to keep
[1:18:05] these phrases if you love her then you
[1:18:08] want her to be happy
[1:18:11] brother said the same way with god god's
[1:18:13] will whether i'm happy with god's will
[1:18:15] or not i want to live so he will be
[1:18:18] pleased with what i do
[1:18:22] i mean hey
[1:18:24] brother branham himself you know he
[1:18:25] wanted to live he wanted to live a lot
[1:18:27] earlier in the mountains
[1:18:30] right
[1:18:31] but it wasn't god's will at that time
[1:18:37] but then it came to a place that it was
[1:18:39] god's will
[1:18:40] remember the rabbi said regardless if
[1:18:43] yeah i want to please him
[1:18:46] because it's his will that i desire to
[1:18:49] do so brother batman is dealing with he
[1:18:51] says now see that's the same way with
[1:18:53] the genuine love
[1:18:55] for god he says i don't care what part
[1:18:57] of the body i am
[1:18:58] i don't care what part that god asked me
[1:19:00] to do whatever
[1:19:02] it doesn't have to be anything of
[1:19:03] significance it's just i want to do i
[1:19:06] want to please him
[1:19:08] and he says that's the same thing about
[1:19:10] your wife so when you found now bring in
[1:19:12] that parallel same thing about the wife
[1:19:14] it doesn't matter
[1:19:16] it could be so grandiose oh my this will
[1:19:18] really stand out but even if it's times
[1:19:21] where there's things that seem very
[1:19:23] minute and can seem like well that don't
[1:19:25] seem very grandiose but everything
[1:19:28] matters
[1:19:30] think about it in this assembly right
[1:19:32] here think about in the assembly in the
[1:19:34] body to have a service like this tonight
[1:19:39] it don't just happen if there wasn't
[1:19:41] people and brother brandon you know he
[1:19:44] he complimented on that that was that
[1:19:46] was quite something as well too i i
[1:19:48] think about that i've mentioned that
[1:19:51] there's people that they they take care
[1:19:54] to make sure that the building is ready
[1:19:56] the building is clean things have been
[1:19:58] not just that but it's things that's
[1:20:00] going beyond themselves
[1:20:03] if i can just get myself to church on
[1:20:05] time now it's things that goes beyond
[1:20:06] that
[1:20:09] hello you guys with me
[1:20:10] it goes beyond that and we're not
[1:20:12] talking about just cleaning the church
[1:20:13] we're talking about things it keeps it
[1:20:15] goes beyond that and it isn't it doesn't
[1:20:17] have to be things that's noticeable
[1:20:20] because if it's things that you do and
[1:20:22] every time you do and god used me here
[1:20:24] and god used me there god that's a
[1:20:26] braggart
[1:20:28] it's a braggart
[1:20:30] you know you don't tell everything of
[1:20:32] god use me here i did this here that
[1:20:34] that's
[1:20:36] that's elevating self
[1:20:39] but there's things that are done behind
[1:20:41] the scenes that make it possible right
[1:20:44] here tonight
[1:20:45] there's lives that no doubt across this
[1:20:47] building could stand up and say i've
[1:20:50] been praying for the service here
[1:20:51] tonight
[1:20:53] many many different needs my how do we
[1:20:56] get on that
[1:20:59] the atmosphere
[1:21:01] husbands love your wives
[1:21:04] even as christ also loved the church and
[1:21:08] gave himself for it now think of this
[1:21:11] husbands love your
[1:21:12] wives it's a display
[1:21:16] of real genuine
[1:21:19] affection
[1:21:21] and it's affection that has
[1:21:23] has a definite
[1:21:24] a real care within it
[1:21:28] it's a it's a display of an affection to
[1:21:30] have a real delight and a pleasure in
[1:21:32] them and i want you just to listen to
[1:21:33] some of these things that i have down in
[1:21:35] showing respect
[1:21:39] in doing honor
[1:21:41] to them honor to them doesn't mean
[1:21:42] bowing down before them
[1:21:45] that's something we were talking about
[1:21:47] but honoring them as paul peter would
[1:21:49] write as the weaker vessel
[1:21:52] is that right
[1:21:53] i mean a glass vase on the table you
[1:21:56] don't play around it
[1:21:58] is that right
[1:21:59] matter of fact if there's a glass lamp
[1:22:00] you tell the kids i quit throwing the
[1:22:02] ball around in here take it outside
[1:22:04] why there's a possibility that they
[1:22:06] could knock that glass off
[1:22:08] and it could shatter
[1:22:10] so
[1:22:11] showing honor or doing honor to and
[1:22:14] seeking
[1:22:15] a contentment a satisfaction of pleasure
[1:22:19] and a quiet constant and comfortable
[1:22:21] dwelling in providing all things
[1:22:24] necessary for them
[1:22:26] think of that providing all things
[1:22:27] necessary for them
[1:22:29] not to have the latest dress that's not
[1:22:31] necessary
[1:22:33] i understand you know sisters you want
[1:22:34] to look beautiful and pretty but well i
[1:22:36] don't have the latest the exact color
[1:22:39] you know on my kitchen walls just that's
[1:22:42] but there are things providing all
[1:22:44] things necessary for them in reality you
[1:22:47] know brethren and you've heard this said
[1:22:49] over and over before
[1:22:50] it wasn't until the sister came on the
[1:22:52] scene we started moving furniture
[1:22:55] adam had to start moving trees
[1:22:57] she don't like it here move over here
[1:23:02] is that right
[1:23:05] is that true
[1:23:06] you
[1:23:07] so
[1:23:08] but but it's done in delight providing
[1:23:11] all things necessary protecting them
[1:23:13] from all injuries and abuses
[1:23:16] concealing their faults
[1:23:20] that's a powerful thing isn't it
[1:23:22] see what i'm reading about you say
[1:23:23] brother simon where are you drawing this
[1:23:25] from the attributes of christ
[1:23:28] the attributes of christ husbands love
[1:23:30] your wives even as christ so loved the
[1:23:31] church he conceals our faults our
[1:23:34] shortcomings
[1:23:36] he doesn't spread it around oh he's weak
[1:23:38] in this she's weak in that they failed
[1:23:40] this many times he don't do that as a
[1:23:42] matter of fact he so conceals it by his
[1:23:45] grace he's not concealing wrong but he
[1:23:48] conceals our faults with his own grace
[1:23:52] in our lives
[1:23:58] and he covers our weaknesses he covers
[1:24:01] our infirmities
[1:24:03] and and entertains the best opinions of
[1:24:06] our persons and actions it's okay if in
[1:24:07] your heart you say out of me help me
[1:24:09] lord
[1:24:10] it's okay
[1:24:12] an endeavoring endeavoring to promote
[1:24:15] a spiritual good and a welfare this is
[1:24:17] what the lord jesus does for us
[1:24:19] over
[1:24:21] and over
[1:24:22] and over again
[1:24:25] sure we failed him many times but he's
[1:24:27] never failed us
[1:24:30] is that right
[1:24:32] he doesn't put something but he covers
[1:24:35] our weaknesses
[1:24:37] remember brother braham says you keep
[1:24:39] your weaknesses covered by the blood of
[1:24:41] jesus christ
[1:24:43] there's things that as brother brown
[1:24:45] would we would deal with our lives of
[1:24:47] how that you reign over things in our
[1:24:49] life he gives us grace to reign over
[1:24:52] things in our life he gives us grace
[1:24:54] through tests and through trials and
[1:24:56] through adversity he gives more grace
[1:25:01] he's constantly protecting us
[1:25:04] how that god watches over us he provides
[1:25:08] for all of our needs i i tell you may
[1:25:12] god help us and
[1:25:13] to not take anything for granted he
[1:25:16] provides for us again and again not just
[1:25:19] the natural things of life but the
[1:25:21] spiritual necessities of what you and i
[1:25:24] have need of how many times where we've
[1:25:27] been down or or discouraged and he'll
[1:25:30] come right along and he'll minister
[1:25:32] right to our life not that we deserve it
[1:25:35] but he does it because he's our husband
[1:25:38] and we're his wife and he loves us
[1:25:41] that's his care to you and i yeah
[1:25:45] oh my
[1:25:46] so even as christ also loved the church
[1:25:50] and gave himself forth so notice we've
[1:25:52] been looking at why submit yourselves
[1:25:55] unto your own husbands and then it jumps
[1:25:57] to church it's subject as the church is
[1:26:00] subject unto christ in in all things i
[1:26:04] want you to notice
[1:26:06] here the requirements
[1:26:07] you'll find throughout this chapter and
[1:26:09] you find another in other and other uh
[1:26:12] letters there that were wrote by the
[1:26:14] holy spirit through paul it'll deal with
[1:26:16] wives being submissive but the
[1:26:19] requirement for the husband is love
[1:26:23] why because without love submission
[1:26:26] can't be
[1:26:29] so submission is to be a voluntary it's
[1:26:32] to be something of a yielding it's a
[1:26:34] giving in and it's a working together
[1:26:39] so what is over it all
[1:26:41] love
[1:26:44] oh my let me let me just let me let me
[1:26:46] have just a few moments is that okay
[1:26:49] so it brings into that place so for that
[1:26:52] for a wife if it would be hard for a
[1:26:54] wife to be in subjection
[1:26:57] i mean because
[1:26:59] no man is just going to walk up to a
[1:27:01] wife
[1:27:02] and or a woman and say you know what
[1:27:05] you're my wife and i want you to go do
[1:27:07] this or what more
[1:27:14] she might be the new gold medalist
[1:27:17] and i would encourage a ron's sister run
[1:27:23] run run run as fast as you can and don't
[1:27:25] let him catch you
[1:27:27] because there's a wrong approach
[1:27:30] christ never approached us like that
[1:27:32] see it's the approach of christ
[1:27:35] god approached our life by wooing
[1:27:38] drawing us to a place of surrender
[1:27:41] is that right
[1:27:43] that's why you could say well you know
[1:27:45] our courtship was this long another
[1:27:46] person says our courtship was this long
[1:27:48] and i there's no such thing as saying
[1:27:50] well the courtship should only be this
[1:27:51] long and it should only be those are
[1:27:52] young people you know i've taught these
[1:27:54] things it's no such thing it's got to be
[1:27:56] this law it's a wooing that takes place
[1:27:59] it's the same way in a church a person i
[1:28:02] tell you what they ought to be moving on
[1:28:03] right now there ought to be things
[1:28:04] they're moving on a little bit further
[1:28:06] this is not a work of man
[1:28:08] man can't order this if man orders it
[1:28:11] and it's done under man it'll come back
[1:28:14] because it's man but if god's doing the
[1:28:17] work brother then god's laying in by his
[1:28:20] love there's a dismantle of the holds in
[1:28:23] the things of life that's why brother
[1:28:25] branham says as you fall in love with
[1:28:28] jesus you become love
[1:28:33] is that right
[1:28:35] so it restores this is why then for
[1:28:38] everything that's required there of a
[1:28:40] wife it's the spirit of love the
[1:28:42] christ-like love
[1:28:44] on the part of the husband that makes
[1:28:46] the duty
[1:28:48] very easy
[1:28:50] so as the wife the single duty
[1:28:53] subjection submission the single duty of
[1:28:55] the husband is love
[1:29:00] what a what what a balance
[1:29:02] what a balance within this
[1:29:04] song of solomon chapter two verse three
[1:29:07] as the apple tree among the trees of the
[1:29:09] wood
[1:29:10] so is my beloved among the suns
[1:29:14] i sat down under his shadow
[1:29:18] with great delight
[1:29:20] this is
[1:29:21] the
[1:29:22] bride
[1:29:24] the shepherd girl
[1:29:26] that solomon had sought out this is her
[1:29:28] response she's not made to
[1:29:30] she sat down under
[1:29:33] him
[1:29:34] with great delight
[1:29:37] and his fruit was sweet to my taste
[1:29:40] isn't it wonderful to serve the lord
[1:29:42] isn't it wonderful to be under his
[1:29:45] protection
[1:29:46] that's what his shadow is it's his
[1:29:48] protection
[1:29:50] we are hidden in him
[1:29:52] he's providing for us all that we have
[1:29:54] needed
[1:29:56] lord i i i need i i need help
[1:29:58] financially i've got that covered
[1:30:00] lord i'm weak
[1:30:02] i'm your strength
[1:30:04] lord i
[1:30:05] i
[1:30:06] i need healing i'm your healer
[1:30:09] lord i i i need deliverance i'm your
[1:30:12] delivery see he is all things
[1:30:15] to us
[1:30:17] he becomes all things he's a satisfier
[1:30:20] of our needs
[1:30:23] oh i know sometimes the husband you're
[1:30:25] thinking i want to say amen but that's
[1:30:26] some big shoes to fill in but remember
[1:30:30] it's christ
[1:30:32] this is the thing to present it's the
[1:30:34] lord jesus christ we give ourselves to
[1:30:36] him
[1:30:37] he guides and directs us and he's the
[1:30:40] one that helps us to fulfill what he's
[1:30:44] called us to do
[1:30:46] god's not called us as husbands or wives
[1:30:48] to do things that is beyond our measure
[1:30:51] he's called us to do things
[1:30:54] that
[1:30:54] are
[1:30:55] completely in line with the measure
[1:30:59] of grace that he's given to us
[1:31:04] and his fruit was sweet to my taste he
[1:31:06] brought me to
[1:31:08] the banqueting
[1:31:10] house
[1:31:11] and his banner his standard
[1:31:14] over me was love let me just let me end
[1:31:17] here tonight we'll just stop here
[1:31:22] so there's a governing effect here of
[1:31:24] love remember
[1:31:26] brother would write about how
[1:31:30] remember
[1:31:32] he would deal with the pentecostal
[1:31:33] church and so many
[1:31:36] even when you find some of the latter
[1:31:38] rain was starting they started to it was
[1:31:41] reaching out
[1:31:42] for gifts and
[1:31:45] and i don't believe when everything
[1:31:46] first started that it was something
[1:31:48] wrong i believe there just was a hunger
[1:31:50] for the supernatural i really believe
[1:31:52] that
[1:31:54] but how the spirit of god
[1:31:56] i look coming
[1:31:58] would guide the church of the living god
[1:32:00] into a place to realize there's
[1:32:02] something deeper than a gift
[1:32:05] and that's the giver himself
[1:32:08] because if you get the giver
[1:32:10] then all the gifts come with it
[1:32:12] you know i mean if you get
[1:32:15] him
[1:32:16] he's the complete package
[1:32:23] he is the feast he is that's why brother
[1:32:25] brown could say in spoken words original
[1:32:27] seed
[1:32:28] he could go into all those things in him
[1:32:29] as the millennium in him why because
[1:32:31] it's an unfolding
[1:32:34] that's why he talked about the seventh
[1:32:36] seal as a roman candle goes up
[1:32:39] keeps every one of them goes up why he
[1:32:42] keeps on folding himself
[1:32:46] oh my
[1:32:48] oh i love him don't you
[1:32:50] oh i love him
[1:32:51] that's why brother branham when he would
[1:32:53] deal with this and he would speak about
[1:32:54] the gifts he says
[1:32:56] the gifts must be governed
[1:32:58] by love or they're not effective
[1:33:01] so everything i want you to think about
[1:33:03] that the gifts must be governed by love
[1:33:06] or they're not affected so is it with
[1:33:08] everything in our lives
[1:33:10] if it's not governed by love it's not
[1:33:12] effective
[1:33:15] it must be governed by love
[1:33:18] love is the motivating
[1:33:20] factor you see
[1:33:22] god did not just come down
[1:33:25] and pay the price for you and i redeem
[1:33:27] us
[1:33:29] simply because well he cared about us
[1:33:31] but his care was he desired to bring
[1:33:35] comfort
[1:33:36] to our lives
[1:33:39] see there's things that a person can do
[1:33:41] out of care but
[1:33:42] we're talking about as a husband a care
[1:33:45] a care that cares the desire
[1:33:48] to
[1:33:48] really make happy
[1:33:51] that wife
[1:33:52] is really to see to her delight i sat
[1:33:56] down under
[1:33:58] his shadow
[1:33:59] with great delight so what caused her to
[1:34:01] say setting she didn't say i sat down
[1:34:04] under his shadow oh man
[1:34:06] no it was with great delight
[1:34:08] it was with great delight and you know
[1:34:10] you can tell
[1:34:12] my
[1:34:14] this is a match made in heaven
[1:34:17] come on somebody
[1:34:18] i believe that for my wife and i it was
[1:34:20] a match made in heaven it was just two
[1:34:22] that dropped down i believe that
[1:34:25] it was complementary
[1:34:28] some of you don't know what to say amen
[1:34:29] or not
[1:34:31] [Laughter]
[1:34:34] it's okay
[1:34:36] but i believe that
[1:34:38] it's a match it's how because god knows
[1:34:41] the corresponding part
[1:34:44] and so the effectiveness that is within
[1:34:47] it is even in the things that we do that
[1:34:49] it's governed by love that's why there's
[1:34:52] nothing should be done in a church
[1:34:54] but that it would be governed by love
[1:34:57] the ministering of the word is to be
[1:34:59] governed by love speaking the truth in
[1:35:01] love
[1:35:02] that don't mean you know that powdered
[1:35:04] sugar is flying out of my lips like spit
[1:35:06] does
[1:35:07] but it means it's governed in love it
[1:35:09] has the best interest
[1:35:11] is that right
[1:35:14] love this is why as brother brahman say
[1:35:16] i told you as closing and i am
[1:35:18] love should govern
[1:35:20] the home
[1:35:22] and this is where brother brahm comes
[1:35:24] into that place and he's talking about
[1:35:27] how it should govern let that be the
[1:35:29] brand says the principle
[1:35:32] love
[1:35:33] first
[1:35:38] love
[1:35:39] first
[1:35:41] i just close it in this manner we just
[1:35:43] pick it up
[1:35:45] when god
[1:35:48] god came and he sought us out
[1:35:51] i think how the love of god began to
[1:35:53] move upon our life
[1:35:55] it brings conviction
[1:35:57] it draws upon our heart
[1:35:59] but the love of god is
[1:36:01] you find how the love of god begins to
[1:36:04] move
[1:36:06] upon a life and you'll find things
[1:36:08] beginning to disappear from that life
[1:36:12] what's causing it to disappear what's
[1:36:15] causing it to something that was held
[1:36:16] here
[1:36:18] of great value to them maybe something
[1:36:19] that meant a lot to them
[1:36:22] but the love of god coming it causes
[1:36:24] that life to release it
[1:36:27] and take a hold
[1:36:29] upon him
[1:36:30] who's taken hold upon their life
[1:36:32] what's doing that the love of god
[1:36:36] what is it that dissolved the difference
[1:36:38] the chasm between us and god the love of
[1:36:41] god came down
[1:36:43] and spanned the breach
[1:36:46] but we could not get to him but he came
[1:36:48] and he spanned
[1:36:50] the breach
[1:36:52] to where that between god and man
[1:36:54] there's no longer a chasm it's the
[1:36:56] reality is is that
[1:36:59] a person doesn't have to go any longer
[1:37:01] without being a fully
[1:37:03] manifest son and daughter of god
[1:37:07] because the love of god
[1:37:08] has made a way for us
[1:37:11] love governs everything
[1:37:14] love governs that this so
[1:37:16] i would
[1:37:17] i would invite us in this manner
[1:37:19] to say it like this if there's things
[1:37:21] that we could say
[1:37:23] well you know
[1:37:24] brother samuel i i think there's some
[1:37:26] things that
[1:37:27] maybe fallen out here or fallen out
[1:37:30] there or fallen out there
[1:37:32] you know brother brahm says in one place
[1:37:34] he says
[1:37:36] he says
[1:37:37] when you when you can't overlook your
[1:37:40] brothers and sisters mistakes
[1:37:42] you've fallen out of love
[1:37:45] because we are all we all have
[1:37:46] shortcomings
[1:37:48] are you with me we all make mistakes
[1:37:52] god doesn't set us down and say no you
[1:37:54] stop doing this and you stop doing that
[1:37:55] and you stop no no the answer is not
[1:37:57] that the answer is love
[1:38:00] the love of god
[1:38:03] so it's falling out of love is what
[1:38:05] causes
[1:38:07] all the prickiness and everything else
[1:38:09] to stand out
[1:38:11] is that right
[1:38:13] so what removes
[1:38:15] takes cactus needles and brings leaves
[1:38:22] what does that
[1:38:24] his life
[1:38:25] letting his life just move let water
[1:38:27] come
[1:38:29] let water come invite
[1:38:31] invited i i would say tonight just like
[1:38:34] within every one of us i would say it in
[1:38:36] this manner lord
[1:38:38] let the holy spirit
[1:38:40] just be so preeminent lord in our lives
[1:38:43] let the holy spirit just lord if there's
[1:38:45] something that you feel like you've went
[1:38:47] astray here or and every one of us
[1:38:50] i've got my hands up i say lord because
[1:38:53] i want you to understand when brother
[1:38:54] samuel stands here i'm not standing here
[1:38:58] with just a bunch of fingers going there
[1:39:00] when i'm standing here i want my life to
[1:39:02] be changed
[1:39:03] i want this word
[1:39:05] to come and to further change my life i
[1:39:07] want to be more like him
[1:39:09] i want to be more like him even many
[1:39:12] times as we're standing right here and
[1:39:13] the word just continues to open and i
[1:39:15] believe that's our heart's desire we can
[1:39:17] come back to say lord
[1:39:19] love first
[1:39:21] love first
[1:39:22] that be the principle
[1:39:24] amen you love him
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:28] let's bow our heads heavenly father
[1:39:32] lord jesus
[1:39:35] i i thank you lord for how
[1:39:38] for your grace and mercy lord
[1:39:41] lord as
[1:39:43] we look in these examples lord in the
[1:39:45] scripture and as you're
[1:39:47] you're here to teach us and to edify us
[1:39:50] every one of us lord
[1:39:53] and we want to grow lord
[1:39:56] lord no doubt tonight i
[1:39:58] there might be some someone here someone
[1:40:01] streaming or will archive this
[1:40:04] that lord
[1:40:05] their whole
[1:40:06] view of serving you
[1:40:10] it's changed
[1:40:12] they realize
[1:40:14] it's not
[1:40:16] your work their works
[1:40:19] that you want
[1:40:22] your desire lord
[1:40:24] is surrender
[1:40:26] under the love of god
[1:40:29] that you have everything
[1:40:31] provided for them lord
[1:40:34] to take care of every
[1:40:36] every need in their life you you have
[1:40:38] what's needed to take care of that old
[1:40:41] sinful nature
[1:40:42] and to release them
[1:40:44] from a life
[1:40:47] of bondage
[1:40:48] into liberty lord i pray tonight god
[1:40:52] may they just as you took us there and
[1:40:54] that quote at the beginning
[1:40:56] may they just come to a place of
[1:40:58] surrender and say lord all that i am all
