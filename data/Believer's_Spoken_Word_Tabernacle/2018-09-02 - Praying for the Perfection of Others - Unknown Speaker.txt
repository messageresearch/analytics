think God sister Rita Costello she gave that testimony this morning and just the other day amen I you know you know just the other day when she she called and gave me the report and you know I tell you I've just been in my heart just rejoicing and you see the very things that God God has been doing yeah and he's been doing and I I just want to it's something that I I believe that we hope that we really take account of these things to recognize that what God is building our faith in his word that's that's the whole thing now now you know a person says well I don't need signs and miracles we don't need if you're a believer this moving and God has revealed the truth to you it's true you need no sign or miracle to convince you because it's been revealed to you but we do need signs miracles corners at the end of the 3rd Exodus message the Prophet in prayer he said Lord would you every once in a while do something among us to let us know that you're with us now I'm just going to tell you there ain't nobody bigger than the Prophet in this age I just tell you that right I'll just tell you that right out I think we agree with that that that's that's the star to the age we're not lifting him up to a god status but I I'm telling you right now he recognized those things to set it in line for us that you know what listen this is even to where he would say and turn the message perfect faith he said all our hearts long for those real apostolic times I believe that there I'll tell you what I you know hey my heart is thrilled within the revealing of the word I you know it's just things that that God will do and as he's opening this word I tell you that thrills my heart but you know I love I love hearing testimonies and seeing God move just something about it I just I just love seeing God move it just to me it's not just God moving but you see God moving for the needs of his children that's precious that's precious that's wonderful because he's still the same yesterday today and forever and he's declaring that over and over you know testimonies that we could go on and on throughout the year but I believe with all things that everything it places our faith to recognize that if there's a promise and you've got a need in your life you stand on that promise because that promise is the word and he is the word that is a promise to us amen you love you I'm so glad to just be a part of the family of God I'm glad to be a part of what God's doing in this hour thank God that my eyes are open thank God that our eyes are open to see this amen I know I'm not the preacher this morning but I'm stirred up brother Oh L I'm just want him to take his time this morning he's got many different things to show us here from the work that is going on there in the Philippines and I believe that we will be blessed and so it's not all so you know to to minister to us as well and I know that it'll be placed all the way throughout there and I'm just so thankful for brother Rowell and sister Cindy their friendship their love their service to the Lord I really I really really really just just appreciate them and love them very dearly and it's good to have my little nephew Nathaniel and Lydia wonderful to have you all with us this morning amen sure others they're out there from meetings and things and the other visitors are here god bless you richly man we

expecting to eat when you come to the house of God we're expecting be bring me to a restaurant I want to eat and I believe we've come here this morning we have an expectation we want to hear from God we want us we want to see the Lord as he would unveil himself through his word and speak to our hearts Oh amen I tell you and I just unruhe guards to that of the miracles the testimonies those things that God has been doing I believe it would be good for us even in in our times to be mindful to thank God for all that he's been doing I believe that maybe we never get to a place to where we're just well lord I it's just like it's like a handout and let us always be thankful for everything that he does everything amen well let's turn our let's turn our attention to to the word of the Lord this morning and just invite brother ro Alvin that he would come amen just take his liberty this morning amen we appreciate further royal for 18 years now brother royal has been coming and it's just been a very precious thing I still heard they still remember the first time I picked him up I picked him up the car had no air-conditioning or nothing you know it just was newly married and so we had all the windows down all the way from when I picked them up to meet brother ray but I'll tell you it's been just a wonderful wonderful friendship and Brotherhood and it's just a wonderful privilege that they would come by and God would allow us to have two services with them in the Fellowship for the room love you he meant musicians thank you this morning thank you this morning amen the Lord is good so it's good to be in the house of the Lord David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and I thank God for my relationship with butter Samwell and sister Kim of course it goes all the way back to my relationship with Mary Jim browning and she's a path and because this church has become a big part of the ministry in the Philippines and I hear of people that just believe the message and they're living the message but in the Philippines we cannot cope with the open door that the Lord has the Lord has been opening for the message we just cannot cope there's just so many things that transpire in our country many people accepting the message that churches even as a whole group of Pentecostal churches if some come from the Baptist's they come to the message as a whole so we we are just thankful and we wish to share some of the things that the Lord has been doing in our country sorry but I have to start from the beginning yeah okay I hope this doesn't take long I have three presentations to show you this morning and this is about the resettled iya community in Mount Pinatubo zambales the Philippines in 1981 the volcano Mount Pinatubo which had been dormant for 600 years erupted and you can see in the picture the extent of the eruption it did not blow out the lava and did not that a switch into Indonesia and Malaysia it was that expensive eruption list of this of this volcano they say it's the biggest eruption at the second of this of the century I think second only to mount health at st. Helens I think so hundreds of thousands of people were displaced as a result and the eight tribes who live around volcano area was affected the most the ATIS are what you would call the pygmies you know they look like small african-american brothers people from Africa dark-skinned only they're a lot smaller about four feet tall but they look exactly exactly alike they look exactly like the Africans kinky hair dark skin and we see we see them in this picture you know evacuating with their stuff carrying their stuff with them and they live for many years in the evacuation areas and resettlement areas that our government provided for them this is how the crater looks today it has become a tourist attraction it's a beautiful place now people go up there just to see the lake to the area but we were able to get in contact with the tribal leaders because and we find out that after the eruption 15 years after the eruption some of the either people went back to the place where they used to live and they started planting stuff and they found out that the soil in the area was very fair tile and so a lot of them started going back and the government actually started a program of resettling these eight tribal people to go back to where they used to live these are tribal leaders the main leader was pallab and what was the other one is a minister and the woman was pastoral arena he she she's and she works under the Presbyterian Church that does missionary work in the same place and the one to the seated at the right Moses but as soos is one of the leaders that is being raised of the Lord in the IT community to present a message to the to their people here's one we discussed about having an evangelistic service and reaching out to the people that have been able to return and resettle in the area and this is the big vehicle that we rented because this is the only one that's the only type of vehicle that is able to cover area because of the road conditions our beer we now have a handful of native church workers and we carried a lot of supplies on a 4x4 weapon carrier yes I know all the world war ii vehicle called the weapon carrier we set off to peanut Oh Pinatubo mountain ranges these are missionaries from from our church and it's started raining before we left the nearby town of botolan zambales everyone was soaking wet as we reach our destination says here burying the heat of the Sun after the rain you know it rained and then the Sun shone it was very hot after after the rain hot and humid now this is one of the houses of the people that resettled in in the area of Pinatubo is actually gia is actually the chieftains house a typical Negrito house you see I look like a giant before the house because it's just a small heart we call this a bahai football grass hot and we're gathered around the plot were they said we can build a church and praise the Lord we are the first one of all the organizations that work in the area the religious organizations that work the missions in the area where the first ones to build a church in this area thank you Lord and this is the picture of the men that came to the our evangelistic meeting that we held in this place this is a multi-purpose area which they erected in the well the government has erected in the community so they can hold such events this is the woman preacher that's trying to help us and this is another house it was given his family was given two acres okay so this is the tribal chiefs house as you can see the road runs into the river that's the reason we need to have a high vehicle and one that will not stall in the mud and in the sand and if you miss the I wrote here you get to write a carve-out card if you miss the once a day trip to of the weapons carrier it runs once a day and if you fail to catch it then you have to write the card ball card can you see the carbo card the drive it took us about three hours to get to where we're going but when you get when you when you write the carb out card it will take you about at least at least seven hours to get there or you don't want to write a carb out card you can take out other means of transportation now this either children have to walk two hours to go to school the nearest school this is what I'm talking about if you miss the weapon carrier you get to write a carbo card or this we call it the Skylab it's a little scooter one two five school scooter Yamaha and the Filipinos are very inventive they put some wooden planks on the other side of it so it can accommodate more people I counted and there are twelve people on this one motorcycle and the Japanese people the tourists when they see this because this is the mode of transportation down in Mindanao besides in Mindanao and they're scratching their head how in the world this Philippines the Filipinos can do this it's only designed for one person and now they're carrying it's carrying 12 now this vehicle they added a third wheel like a sidecar they call it a tricycle there's 15 people in this speaker now you can see the mountain raids not far from both from the volcano that erupted in 1991 see it's a beautiful place this is the house where women of the community cooked food for the 200 families that attended the evangelistic serving service evangelistic meeting in in the place called bagong Silang and you see that the men are carrying steel ramps there they're carrying scaring steel ramps to keep our truck from stalling in the sandy lahar field so we had to cross the river a dozen times to reach our destination the beautiful Mount Pinatubo range this is how it looks today and this is a picture of the newly resettle eight of villages most of them they will be coming to our church once we finish the church and we are looking to dedicate the church in the month of March next year here's the church that we built as you can see it's still not complete so I hope you can pray for the work in Pinatubo amongst Titus and then I want to show you the next one I know how to work this okay next one is the tribal churches of the allowing goof-up islands we read in Isaiah chapter 24 verse 15 where it says were for glorifying the Lord in the fires even the name of the Lord God of Israel in the Isles of the sea which means that the name of the Lord should be ministered to the people that live in the islands of the sea do you know that the Philippines is an archipelago which is composed of 7,000 Islands 7,000 Islands and our neighbours Indonesia in Malaysia there's at least 30,000 islands between these two nations so we live in a place where there are thousands of islands and God willing we are doing the best that we can by the help of God to reach these islands for the glory of God this is the map of the Philippines Philippines mainly made up of three island groups the first is Luzon Island which is the northernmost island the biggest island and then you see that smaller island cluster of islands in the middle it's called the Visayas besides Islands and then the orange island is the second-biggest Island which is the island of Mindanao there is a Marshall rule being imposed in Mindanao Island Mindanao right now because certain elements of the ISIS they went over there and started recruiting Muslim extremists to their group and they actually took over a city city of morale we in Mindanao and that's the reason our government fought these forces and martial law is still being imposed down there now our country's made up of 12 regions and by the grace of God in all the 12 regions of our country we are able to establish churches that believe this message amen now the long island to the southwest the long island plowin do have a pointer here okay this is the island of Palawan so Long Island probably 600 kilometers long and in recent years we were able to win a lot of Ministers on this island which resulted in two Brits resulted in many many churches coming into the message I'm not able to move okay you see this man the clicker is not working so this is northern palawan some of the islands that we go to she can see in this picture are the waters are very shallow and the boat are not the boats are not able to come in right into the heads of the coast of the island as you can see the boat is over there that's the boat we have to walk from the island to the boat coming into the islands we have to get off the boat and walk to the shore because the waters too too shallow there are a lot of islands like this in allowance allowance made up of three hundred islands there's three hundred and it's right in Palawan and these are the brothers trekking the mountain called Montelena Han in southern palawan you see there's no other way to get to the place where we're going but to walk you can't use your motorcycle here you can't use your your 4x4 vehicle you just have to walk walk for eight hours and there's a church there in McDonald and walk another five hours and you reach the village of valuing this one lost this brother lost her soul to win a soul because the the path is so muddy and you have to we're tracking shoes but this brother or ordinary rubber shoes to go there and he lost his soul this is when they stopped at a shelter about halfway to where they're going in MA in mutton or now this church you have to walk 13 hours to get to this church church in between in mouth knock telling a hand they call it the cathedral 100 meters or 3,000 feet above the sea level that's the pastor's house we're helping him with we help him with the roofing and also the church roofing on the side of the parsonage and now we're helping him put was in his church it's a typical village in up in the mountain this tribe is called the path but oh it's known to be unreached they are still and reached as far as civilization is concerned and they they they meet very simple very poor lives this is the view from up there and the whole region is actually owned by the tribes and they told us that 200 acres are available for our use they told us you can plant whatever you want you can graze animals or do whatever you want you can use it for many years no limit said because they're the ones that tribal people are the ones that owned it by law and so they're letting us use the area to start a plantation or grace some animals ok this is the chieftain his name is Burt wing and I said here coffee maker / rice cooker that's this the metal pot pot is where they cook the rice and also make coffee out of it this is the congregation up in Bell wing you see how the mothers carry their children there carry them with clothes or piece of cloth tied around their bodies see they're very primitive and you can see the the dirt floor and and the benches this is typical of the tribal churches in Palawan the benches are fixed to the ground and to the wall and there's no way to keep the dog out they have no doors and here's the mother's singing a song to the Lord listening intently to the preaching of the word that's another picture now this is another church we've been working with for many years in some percent and northern palawan they see a place called a livable world and the main source of living there is fishing see that's a fishing boat and they gave me two two fishes they're like family of tuna tuna fish okay I want to show the third one this will be the last one by the way in the island of Palawan we have been working with sixty churches 60 churches I can say half of them are now solid in believing the message but we are still working with the other half because you know the pastors of this churches they they heard the message in our mr. Expo seminars and accepted the message but it's kinda hard for them to teach the message right away to their people you know they taught their people Trinity for say ten years and it's hard for the minister to stand before the people and say oh by the way what we told what we taught you for 10 years is wrong and now this is the right teaching so it's kind of hard to do that so what we do we go to these churches because they invite us and they ask us to come on a regular basis so we can minister the message to the people little by little until they come to a complete understanding of the mess so we're working on we're working with 60 churches now he meant so pray for us now this last presentation I call it the outreach continues covering the farthest islands in our country book of Saint Luke chapter 14 verse 22 and 23 says and the serpent said Lord it is done as thou hast commanded yet there is room after they invited all the people still there is room the Lord said called the heart called those that are that have infirmities called the poor and after they called them invite them to the wedding still there is room and so the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled so the Lord wants to see his house full amen the Lord still continues to invite people to the wedding and he wants to see his house full belly bottom said when that last name is redeemed in the rapture we'll go and now if you were in the quickening at his beginning that's what he comes to redeem and your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life in his thinking at the beginning and he come to redeem all the names that's in the book or in that book no more not one more just what is in there when the last name is redeemed then he takes his book and claims what he has redeemed so that last name has to come to realization that he's a seed of God and the only way for him to know that is for him to hear the word the word of the hour ministered to him and brother Branham said this in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I said now don't wait for the missionary to come you take the same message and go to the tribes where the white man can't even go this is what barban said and one one of the men that he went out was a hidden one day and the next day he went out and he baptized up to as many as a thousand a week in Jesus Christ he then one day and the next day he got he got converted and then he started telling the message this fellow hidden still felt tribes people and he was baptizing a thousand a week hallelujah periban was saying Bible skin surveys of Bible School and seminaries is just a waste of time because the heathens the tribal people can take this message to their own people word the white man can it go I mean I don't expect better but it Sam to go up 13 hours to Mount McDonough hunt I know it's gonna kill him and he's afraid of snakes and so what about this but everyone said this said oh my that's that's what it is don't wait to educate a missionary to go to go in let the man take the message to his own people for God is doing a quick work the end is at hand I believe that you know my heart and then better Burnham's says this and once the message once more but that you have done it it will go I will take it and put it into foreign missions he has taken an offering a missionary offering and said I'll put it to foreign missions and go over myself to bring the people that hasn't the privilege that you have here to bring this same gospel to those who cannot afford to send for me or pay my way that day to who are underprivileged might have the same privilege that we have here and not one penny of it will be spent for you know drinking smoking it will be for the kingdom of God and I trust that God will in that give you a great mention in so much as you have done unto the list of this my little ones you have done it unto me and may the Lord bless you the list of God's children you know we sometimes want to be the greatest the most most popular the biggest but you know Christ is interested in the least of this my little ones and if you help these people the least of these little ones God has a blessing for you God will will mention your name at the day of judgment and then he said this divine healing said and I appreciate many of you people are poor people and tonight you probably may be put in the last nickel that you had and on that great day when we stomp stand up here at the judgment seat of Christ and you hear those heathens screaming when I after you hear my name called and I got to come and stand on the tape recording well the tape recording will be played and the screen will show it all and some of those natives and heathens from other countries saying oh brother branham if you hadn't had come I'd have been lost this native people people from the tribes the enriched people will be giving credit to better Branham if you hadn't come we wouldn't have we would have been lost and then God we looked down to you and say you were the ones that sent him the people were giving the credit to brother Branham but God gives the credit to the people that sent better random you may never see any of these tribes people in the Philippines that I'm talking about but you were the ones that sent the missionaries the Rev em said if you can't go send somebody Palawan Island this capo helps the tribes in Palawan Island the man used to be a Dean in their Bible school Pentecostal Bible school but he attended came at attended our mr. x4 seminar and saw the revelation of the message and accepted it right away so he's now working with his wife the Sega Malian couple reaches out to the remote tribes of southern Palawan and they are shown here with a stack of tribal Bibles that we bought from the cool new tribe submission the new tribes mission is an American organization and I just admire their zeal for the missions because they go to remote places mountain areas the farthest island and the missionaries stay with the people sometimes they stay there for five years I've talked to one the state in an island for 10 years and what they do they study the dialect of the people and you know Philippines made up of so many islands it's like an island has a different dialect so we got about a hundred dialects over a hundred dialects and this missionaries they learn the dialect and they begin to translate the Bible in that dialect and so this particular Bible is translated in the Ala when your dialect and we bought them for something like a dollar a dollar a copy or a dollar or $50 50 per copy and so we bought we bought a bunch of them and distributed them amongst the leaders some of the leaders they can read and write they're not educated at least they can read and write and so we this couple now is helping train the leaders of the tribes to become ministers and these are some of the young leaders of the town Durant tribal tribe the youth leaders but the Edward trains and equips tribal youth try but the tribal youth people with ministerial tools you see him in this picture holding youth meetings and baptizing people baptizing new people to the message we gave him a dis motorcycle in 2015 and he used it over rough roads or the mountain roads just trails sometimes until he can't use it anymore he took it to the mechanic three months ago and then we can't accept there's nothing we can do to make this work again so we're helping him in another motorcycle motorbike to continue doing what it's doing brother Edward Saku Marion is responsible for starting dozens of churches like this amongst the tribes and these people don't ask for much all they ask is money to buy five kilos of nails because the number is readily available in the mountains where they live so they're up there only asking for nails to build a structure villagers for themselves here here's a picture of new believers being baptized in water no one's standing to the left that's an evangelist from my church but a little solo and that's me baptizing other people in the town of Kazan southern palawan again this is a typical tribal Church in Palawan again you'll see the dirt floor and you see the pews they're not like your pews that you're using here in your church they're fixed on the ground and fixed on the wall it's difficult but they're happy amen these are not dry walls these are bamboo was woven bamboos praise God these the mountain church I think I show you this picture Inbal wing up mount mantle Egan mantling on now these are the brothers that work together to reach the farthest island of Palawan never read this mr. Minnis ministers that saturate the islands of Palawan with a message of the hour the group is being led by brother Salva Susan is the one standing in the middle this man here his name is brother Salva Susan who was number two men in their apostolic organization he was number two he came out received the message and because he was very influential in their organization many of the churches came out to receive the message [Applause] hallelujah and now there's about I can think of about 15 churches in the Visayas and Mindanao that belong to their use that belong to their organization that are inviting this brother by the zelda susan so he can come and share the message to them so and this this brothers are all ministers brothers in the picture all ministers and balasana susan is we're helping him train these brothers so they can gain knowledge of the message and have the ability to share them with others pray for this ministers again this is a regular service in in allowing it's in a place called that Barone's near puerto princesa it's an agricultural area just outside the city again you see the dirt dirt floor and the benches that are fixed to the ground into the wall typical because there are 300 islands in Palawan we have been praying for a boat that we can use to evangelize the region of Palawan and i think i sent a picture to better sam about an old boat that we were using and we were gonna repair it so we can upgrade it and and use it for a missionary work but before we're able to do anything the typhoon came and destroyed the boat I think I showed that to you and better Sam said he shared it to the congregation and so we decided to just build a new boat and your church has helped us so we can build this new boat this is a big boat 50 foot long 50 feet so it can carry between 30 to 40 passengers and this is the last picture that they sent me they had it painted up installed the engine and had it ready to go in August race alone I think we have to give the Lord a clap offering thank you thank you for helping us and this boat can also be used as a livelihood project to help the people of Pawnee Island they're the ones that maintain these boats but they're gonna use it to number one to ferry people from the mainland of Palawan to Quran Island and back and also to catch fish they're going to be using for fishing and so that they can earn income and the income will help the ministry in the province of zambales I think I showed you a picture about Pinatubo you know two boys in the province of zambales and this brothers this is not this is not ice but you're saying they are not glaciers this is ash asked that came out of Pinatubo volcano just piled up there and the path was formed by people walking across it and so they this is bother hey soos I know you have a brother so hisses here we have we have one too but their suits one of the item brothers who works as an evangelist now to reach his fellow itis this is the road to Pinatubo where we were building a church and this is a small group of believers they be used to belong to the Presbyterian Church but now they came as a group as a whole church to the message and that's my assistant pastor there but a boy DeLeon but Sam met him and so as you can see the women they were all wearing slacks nobody wears skirts but we have been working with this group and sister Chi Chi and the ladies in our church are helping them with dresses and skirts also the church in Hong Kong they're sending us clothing from from the church in Hong Kong once every three months so these sisters can have skirts and dresses this one of our evangelists but a bang oxalis or Gabrielle oxalis he is the teacher of our item or pigmies brethren in some ballast see we gave them motorcycles we purchased two motorcycles that they can use to follow up on their outages in zambales this is brother his sous one of the pygmies that got converted there and this is the church that we're rebuilding in Pinatubo Lord willing in March we will be dedicating it to the Lord hope hopefully the Lord will provide for the roof and we'll be dedicating it in March now in in Mindanao southern Philippines this is a picture of a church that I standard started back in the 90s 90s and it's a growing church again you can see the dirt the dirt floor but they don't have the fixed benches here in this part of the Philippines now this is brother Aaron Allen or sabbia he pastors a church that I started in surah god I sent our IP because this brother is dead now he passed the way he passed he was preaching a convention for churches came together in a convention and somebody came with a gun and gunned him down while as he was preaching the Word of God he was actually killed in action what a way to die killed in the post of duty that's the same the coffee now in mystic city the island of Mindanao we conducted this mr. Expo seminar about 40 ministers from different denominations came and out of this 40 16 for ministers and 16 members accepted the message and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they were mostly Pentecostal Trinitarian people and they accepted the Lord and and then after the four were baptized then this other ones came also and received a message I think there was 12 of them that came to receive the message so a total of 17 pastors came to receive the message now they're holding the tablets that we give out to them because these are cheap tablets made in China that they can use to study the message so they can minister the message to their people and we want you to pray because I think there's about a hundred new ministers now that we're working within the message and we are praying that we'll be able to give each one of them a tablet like this a cheap one the only about 50 to 60 dollars a piece in our country now it's a picture of me with butter and Tony Molina oh and our evangelist but the little solo you know sometimes we we are prejudiced over ministers that work under denomination or organizations I was thinking they are well supported by the organization but I was wrong this man worked for the Assemblies of God for twenty years and he was able to start sixty churches under the Assemblies of God not educated on the grade three education elementary education that's why it's not a full planche a it's nothing ordained minister with the Assemblies of God organization but because of his gift supernatural gift miraculous gift of healing and truly anointed minister we asked him to I invited him to minister to my church and he could not speak our dialect with Tagalog he was speaking Cebuano the dialect that they speak down south but the process of the Lord came that day because of his sincerity and the Lord just vindicated him and God just blessed our heart after he ministered now what I'm trying to tell you is that for twenty years he was given 30 dollars a month a stipend by the organization for 20 years and his wife was taking care of 40 children in an orphanage and was given the same amount of money 30 dollars a month and this brother told me before I even heard the message I've made up my mind to live this organization because you know I'm doing the best that I can to help the people and serve God but the leaders of the organization they're just exploiting me and so when he heard a message he accepted it he gladly accepted it and he started going to this sixty churches that he started and ministering the message to them but then the leadership of the Assemblies of God got wind of it and he was called to a convention or to the minister's conference to be officially excommunicated and they the leaders actually insulted him before the pastors of this sixty churches that he started you know and they belittled him and they say now his believing is believing a call he's following a man now is believing a cult and teaching strange doctrine so oh we are excommunicating this man and you don't have to invite him to your churches and the brother did not say anything just thank them for the 20 years that they've helped him and walked away from the meeting but what they did to this man backfired on them because all the pastors of the 60 churches that he started sympathized with him and now have opened the doors of their churches and wanted it to come and minister the message to them praise the Lord hallelujah so now one by one he goes to the churches and they decide to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and this church this is better Tony moly no that's him that's by the liter solo and their first cousins and this is another group that this started and they all came to the message glory to God and this is another group in healing men and later that but Anita solo baptized another group another Church now this is brother francisco molino the one on the left they're brothers tony Molino and francisco Menino's are our brothers and by the tony now takes care of the church in Henan and Nathan that's about how many sixty members now of that new church in Henan and Leyte so more people get baptized somebody said but the little solo is always baptizing people in the water you know it's beginning to look like a fish it's always in the water imbecilic seed in mindanao same thing is happening this is the latest harvest pastor Jimmy come out is the name of this person in yellow is but a little solo wearing their glasses his congregation of 25 decided to be baptized I said next week but this was this report was given last month so this was the group that's what the first baptized and then again another expose held in Tulum by bananita solo and five ministers from this group are now inviting us for follow-up Expo seminars in their areas now this is coral island it's a beautiful Paradise Island if you can look it out on the internet that palawan is now has just been recently voted as the most beautiful island in the world allow an island look it up and this is the island of Quran we have a church in this island and this is the pastor its name is brother see there's manda and he has a gift of his craft is to build guitars for people he just gives them away and when I saw this girl we started our church started finance I'm financing this enterprise so we give him the money to buy the materials and he makes the guitars and yes so far made 40 guitars and we gave them away to the new new churches that came out of their denominations and to a lot of them there's that's just the only music that they have so thank God for this brother see that's him working in this job now we bring the guitars and finish to our church these are these are placed now in Thai time and there's a brother there that knows how to finish them so we can give the guitars a nicer finish so these are happy with this appearance of the guitars so this year we're hoping Lord willing we'll be able to give a hundred more guitars to the churches the new churches that have come this is Manila the island of busan that's where I am this is the camp-meeting that we hold there November 1 is also a big holiday and we hold a convention every year in our in Manila in our church in Thai Thai resolve and that's where brother Sam preached last November 1 I think this is the November 1 meetings there where you preach during our camp meeting this is a picture of the campers preparing to leave the grounds and this is our church balcony we're about a hundred people can sit but during the night the balcony is transformed into sleeping areas the brothers and sisters actually sleep on the floor they just lay them their mats down and they sleep on the floor so we utilize every space available so that campers are able to sleep during the night and that's why I don't I don't know if you seen this sleeping quarters last time it wasn't there okay we just built this kind of a balcony as additional sleeping quarters for the campers for the campers to sleep on this is our church and this is these are all young people we host a quarterly youth convention in our church were probably six hundred young people come together to for fellowship and to hear the word of God and this church help us build this this facility your church help us build this facility when Belle Browning was still alive glory to God and now it's being used for the glory of God it's a picture of the 800 young people that come to our annual youth camp eight hundred young people overseas of course we started churches overseas I started one in Milan and another one in Dubai because there are a lot of Filipino migrant workers that migrate to these places to work so were they work we start Bible study groups which developed into churches the one in Dubai we asked seven of our brothers that migrated to Dubai to start a Bible study group and then I advised them to announce that they're having a service because the the the group has grown into about 30 people and so I advised them to announce it over the internet that we have a service taking place at a certain certain place and little did we know that there are believers from Africa and India Pakistan and other nations of the world that have been working in Dubai for 10-15 years now having no place to go to for church so once they found out that there's a church in Dubai then they started coming there's there's about 120 believers now in this church in Dubai and then I started one in Hong Kong this is the church in Hong Kong mainly composed of sisters because there are no work or jobs available for brothers so I a brother took up the burden of pastoring this church for six years but then he had to come home because he was his contract working contract expired and so now we're still praying for a brother that will take up the burden to Pastor this church right now I'm still in charge I'm still the pastor of this church they call me their long-distance pastor and they just stream our services every Sunday that's better browning in the church in how come what year was this is the Chi Chi 90 ha mm maybe here mm yeah mm and better browning you know he shows this to the brothers and the brothers here said Vera browning you look like a king there with your harem these old sisters hallelujah and so uh praise God that's the last thing so you want to thank the Lord for what God is doing I hope you're ready to hear the word now let us all stand for the reading of the word I entitle the sermon praying for the perfection of others this is selfless service to the Bride of Christ in the book of Colossians chapter 1 verse 7 to 13 before I let you be seated let's read it together as she also learned of a prepare us our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of Christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit now this is st. Paul writing about this fellow fellow worker named Epirus who is also who also declared unto us your love in the spirit this was what Epirus did he declared and to Paul he just made simply me the report of the kind of love that the people had in colossus in the spirit verse 9 for this course we also since the day we heard it look at the effect of this report do not cease to pray for you and to decide that she might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding this is the effect of what Epirus did that she might walk worthy now paul and the others they tried their best now to help these people in the collage in church that you that he might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being football in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened beador mind according to his glorious power and to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life are we all partakers I trusted your heart verse 13 who has delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son delivered us from the power of Laodicea and now we belong to a kingdom the bride of Jesus Christ another scripture before I let you be seated verse 12 and 13 of Colossians chapter 4 says up opera's who is one of you a servant of Christ saluted you always labouring fervently for you in prayers now this is a Papa's ministry a pauperis was not the dynamic preacher he did not speak in conventions and big meetings but the Bible says he always labored fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God this was what a populace did praying for the people that they can stand perfect in the will of God for our bare him record that he has a great zeal for you and them that are in Laodicea and then in here here uh police these are the words of god let's pray Heavenly Father we want to thank you Lord for this service today thank you for the words that we have just read from the pages of this holy book and we just ask that you would come now and make these words come alive into our hearts in mind make it a part of our lives Lord we thank you we ask that you reach down to the needs of the people and bless your people your bride this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen may be seated hallelujah so I think it's important to pray for the perfection of others amen especially in this day and age that we're living in the Bible spoke the Lord Jesus spoke about this age in Matthew 24 where he said because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold this is the age that we're living in and this also the aides were we were we aspire to attain perfection because the message that we believe it's a message to perfection the Lord Jesus said be perfect as the Lord you're referrin in heaven is perfect and I believe he will not require it of us perfection Jesus would not require it of us if we are not able to attain it hallelujah and so I think a paparazzo's is so little said about him in the Bible it's a fellow servant of st. Paul I think he was with the st. Paul one time when he got imprisoned in Rome and I believe a popper us was mentioned in the Bible because he's he's giving us a good type of a believer a believer who prayed for other believers and specifically specifically mentioned in closure in Chapter four believers in Laodicea of course legacy this is the age that we live in were iniquity abounds and therefore the love of many rocks Kol and I believe app operas ministry is so important in our H and his ministry is to pray for the perfection of other believers you know a lot of time we think of our own perfection when we pray we usually pray for all needs and if we're honest about it you know how much time do you pray for the needs of others compared to the amount of time that you pray for your own needs sometimes we become very individualistic especially here in the States you know I do what I want to do you do what but you want to do I don't care to each his own but we understand that no man is an island we need other people to help us attain perfection and the challenge is how we can be on a par us to other people our brothers and sisters to see that other other people attain attain this state of perfection and to be able to labor in prayer like a Papa's did so that others may attain it it's not an easy task because Satan will definitely try to derail your effort it's a lot easier to be selfish and think of your spiritual growth and perfection in the Lord but the reality is you cannot make it without me you know what a mom says that last name in the book should be redeemed I think he meant not only experienced a rebirth but to be justified sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost and adopted amen into the kingdom of God that's the purpose of this message when this last name has been finished and then the rapture the rapture can come meaning when that last name in the book comes to perfection Alleluia even if you come to perfection and I don't make it to perfection you think you can go you won't go in the rapture you're gonna need me to come to perfection like you came to perfection you you have to help me come to perfection hallelujah and I believe this is a great task for each one of us the ministry of Epirus laboring and praying so that others can come to perfection the word if operas or the name of operas is actually a biblical name which means covered with foam somebody has been covered with foam you know here in America we want to baby-proof our homes and when we may be proof our homes we try to cover everything you know the corners the sharp edges so that so that the babies can roam free and not be hurt that tells me that a popera is a person who has loving kindness Oh Papa Roz is concerned for loved ones and his approach is not offensive his approach is non-toxic he is harmless as a dove but he's wise as a serpent but harmless as a dog you know I used to think when we first started holding the mr. Expo seminars and they they actually they actually started something like that here in Ohio invited to 200 ministers to come to a seminar they had the auditorium ready and the leaflets ready and the tape recording and the equipment ready and but al-ameen Jenkins was supposed to present the message to the people the ministers that were invited and out of the 200 that they invited by phone only two showed up and in the beginning when I first started this in the Philippines it was so hard to get the ministers to come and the ones that come the very few ministers that come they only come to debate you but then I look back and the Lord was showing me that I was I was not doing it right there was something wrong in the way I was going about it I was approaching it the wrong way I was full of knowledge but have no discernment no wisdom no love for the people and so I started changing my approach and I began to identify identify myself with the ministers in denomination and I'm trying to reach because all of the message ministers they shunned the denomination of people they already marked they already labeled them as foolish virgins they have the mark of the best you know and and once we have that kind of a mindset of most denomination of people they can the people can look through it through you they can see what's in your heart that's the reason that we we we have we get that kind of reproach we get that kinda kind of can't think of good response from the people because they are thinking this man thinks he knows all things he can't learn from us but he has everything to tell us to teach us well then change that and just become one with the brothers with the ministers you know they we are tender we attend their denomination of meetings their fellowship and they promote all kinds of doctrines and all kinds of even products they sell business and what you call the energy chi not working not working multi-level marketing and but we have to be patient and be just be one with the Brethren you know and feel what they feel and you know help them when we see that that they need help and we did this for for about two or three years without even inviting them to a seminar but then when they felt that we that we have become I have become one with them they felt the love and concern the genuine concern the sincerity next time I invited for mr. Expo seminar then a lot of Ministers came and that's how the the Expo seminars have began bearing fruits and now I meet Minister First Minister from different nations ministers in the message down in North Carolina where we attend a camp meeting every year and they they wonder what is it about the Philippines what is about this mr. Expo seminar this is the only nation on earth where this is working how come it doesn't work in other countries it has something to do with your concern with your sincerity with your intention your motive as first my motive was just to gather the people so I can teach them I didn't want I didn't really want to be identified with them and be a part of their ministry and help them but they could they could see that they could feel that in me and when I changed that and I became an and I pray for them they know that I'm genuine concern for them when they come praise God and now the Expo seminars have become very very successful I think of at least 200 churches that came to the message because of the Expo seminars namath hallelujah app operas also means she knows oh my yep operas means she knows they're familiar with the quotation spoken what is the original scene here is the secret but Bream says the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word the word is in the bride and she knows what God wants done with the word hallelujah and she does it in his name and she has thus saith the Lord then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit Watership until it is grown and serves its purpose so appopolous she knows she doesn't just know here but she knows here I think it's important the revelation drops from the mind to the heart hallelujah when it drops to your heart that's when it begins to be a part of your life and it begins manifesting in your life it becomes second second nature to you the message becomes you the bride will be a complete body there's nobody can add anything to it or anything taking anything from it if you would it would be a fake body of God but the body of Christ is not a fake body it's not going to be missing a finger it won't have three legs no more no less it would have maybe like six fingers on one hand and three arms and something to add to add something to take something away from it it would be one arm short or one finger short it's the complete body of Jesus Christ and in Christ being the male the groom the bride is represented in him also in this two are one it's gonna be a complete body of Christ the body of Christ is complete and therefore the Bride of Christ is complete wherever I'm said God is that even complete without you that's why every single one of those names in the book has to become completed or perfected hallelujah until it happens we're going nowhere in the book of Philippians chapter 2 verse 4 it says look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others as a Christian becomes mature in the word and in the spirit he becomes more and more selfless he thinks less and less of himself and more and more about others it's more concerned about the needs of others than himself the Christian symbol is the cross not the crown but across and across is the symbol of sacrifice self-sacrifice this reason the Lord said if you really want to follow me take your cross and follow me daily sacrifice be able to you should be able to lay your lives down hallelujah to sacrifice it to give something away in order to get something give something away to get something oh my unfortunately sacrifice has been erased from the vocabulary of a lot of Christians second Corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 for we are glad when we are weak are you strong and this also release even your perfection my what a statement from st. Paul it's ok a spear consider weak as long as you're strong it's all right that we are in need of nothing we are wanting of things in this life as long as you're provided for I believe this is the true attitude of a true Christian selfless concern for others hallelujah Bertram says eternal life is living for others that there was something about the Jackie Benton and about this particular code let me just read it first now the first thing that I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that is perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't got it turn the line how many can say Amen to this eternal life is living for others it proved it when it comes in the lamp of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others and so I was rehearsing this to brother Jackie Jackie Benton you know him lady Jackie Benton told me over there oh well that has become a code that people like to code just another code it's good to hear because we talked about what happened to brother Allen's church I think I thought the church about what happened to our church in Miraz mr. Church said I led into the message where they demolished the church along with 60 homes and we held church out on the street in the middle of the street we had services there and we call about upon the other churches in the area to come join us because they lost their charts and we just came together helped the Brethren in baraz and we made an appeal to the churches to come help this brothers they lost their homes they lost their church my brothers and sisters they are still suffering up to this very day they are still suffering some people came some people prayed with us but they didn't help I think of what the Bible says when your brother comes to you hungry and in need don't just say okay god bless you I'll be praying for you you have to do something hallelujah it turned the life is when you live your life so that other people can benefit from it not not your wife or your children or kinfolks your family but other people can benefit from it you're not living it for yourself but you're living it for others hallelujah this is the true sign of maturity I don't care how much you know about the message if you're not concerned for the well-being of fellow believers in Christ it amounts to nothing see our example is this Matthew 20 verse 20 even as the Son of man came to be ministered came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life as a ransom for Mary this is what Christ did he did not come to be served he came to serve other people first John chapter 3 verse 16 hereby we perceived the love of God because he laid down his life for us we need to be able to perceive the love of God he laid down his life for us look at this next part of this verse and we ought to lay down our lives for our brethren I say amen to this verse hallelujah if you really perceive the kind of love God has for you you'll be able to lay down your lives for the sake of the Brethren even brother Branham needed prayer even Butwell needed the help of the believers let me read it to you believing God brother Brown said when I first started with these claims here started proclaiming the message I told my church stay on your face and pray you know you had the new year the gift divine healing - he had the Commission it been commissioned to go around the world and show that Jesus is still alive manifest to give heal people but he need the backing of other people he said I told my church staying on your face and pray oh my he didn't ask the people to go out there and try to accumulate money but he asked the people to stay on your face and pay he said then God begins to move the first thing you know I heard calls coming from Africa from all over the world how did it get there I don't know but prayer went up but Ram says pray believe when you pray this is it he said believe oh I believe it with all my heart I believe in the power of prayer as gifted as better Brenham wars I don't I don't know a person that's more gifted and better built in the New Testament he said this thirst thing for life we are a unit he said that's the success of my meeting he has to abuse it to what it's because real godly people pray for me that's it that's the recent success says that that's that's the reason for the success in my meetings when I come in and introduce these things about the visions and things there's many and old mother and dad sister and brother setting out there that believe that with all their heart and the Holy Spirit drops right down on them if they if they didn't do that I have no way of doing it think about it if people did not support me and pray for me I had no way of doing it no matter how great it would be for myself it has to be for you the same and then it says we have to do a unit two of us together to make contact with God you as a believer and myself as a believer on my mine what powerful statement we have to do it together hallelujah first thing spotlight first thing for life won't be long we need one another more now we need one another more now than we ever did need each other it's now leave the seer when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and they don't want to associate with that you're getting on dangerous ground is this is the kind of attitude that you have you're getting on dangerous ground you isolate yourself but if I'm said right then keeping away from the church you try to keep away from the church you simply think you can do it all by yourself no you cannot make it by yourself you need other people Paul need other people even Jesus needed other people but apparently needed other people in order to be successful in what you did hallelujah so don't keep away from Church butter brown said find one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a real Christian oh my then we've got fellowships he said protection people love you and pray for you do you realize your church is your protection when you're in fellowship with people of like faith you're actually protecting each other you're under the protection of the church as long as you are a part of that church Alleluia like I said we tend to be too individualistic and too exclusive sometimes just us for and no more you do your thing I do my thing hallelujah but you see this is a corporal thing honey no the church is a corporal thing it's a corporal unfair Alleluia when the Holy Spirit came it did not just come to one or two brothers and then the next day five or six brothers when the Holy Spirit came they were all filled with the Holy Ghost at one time they had to be sitting in one place and in one Accord hallelujah what am I telling you this is a corporal affair we're in this together Alleluia no man is an island that's the reason the Reverend talks about this fellowshipping you know when when a brother or a sister is this fellowship he does he doesn't want to take correction and Bertram says then the church takes its protection out from that brother or sister that won't be corrected we don't pray for him anymore when people in the church stop praying for you you lost your protection because the prayer of the Saints is your protection you come under the protection of the Holy Ghost when you become a part of the church Philemon chapter 123 there are solutely Epirus my fellow prisoner in Jesus Christ oh my Paul was a fellow prisoner and that paparazzi look to him as a fellow prisoner what is a prisoner he's limited in what he can do he said the mercy of the warden or the one that's keeping the prison amen if the pv if the warden tells him you can't go to the bathroom then he can't go to the bathroom and crisis our warden and we're all prisoners of Christ and a pop press is a prisoner a fellow prisoner of Christ I look at you as fellow prisoners where inmates together for convicts together or what I've said ex convicts together Malone we're still in it as I know we're convicts together with inmates together we cannot do anything outside of the will of God outside of this world we're imprisoned in this world I'll do you this is a limit the word is our limit hallelujah murder Bram said it becomes second nature to you and selfish life are you reading with me can you read the words and self is life not the second thought not to think about it but you are so dead to the things of this world and so alive in Christ and so walking on the highway that this things are just an automatic thing praying for others become automatic to you you don't have to be prodded you don't have to be scolded by the Deacons pray you don't eat the pastor telling you to pray it becomes second nature to you it becomes automatic to you hallelujah it becomes it's just a lot of automatic thing you just do it not saying well you know the Lord would the Lord would Lord want me to do that and you're being restrained the Lord wants me to do that to do that but one said it's not that you're just part of him his Spirit is in you and you act the way that he acted hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah so she knows a popera she knows and it's the promise ask and it shall be given to you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open to you for everyone that seeketh receiveth and he that seeketh fight find it and to him that knocketh it shall be opened and or or what man is there of you whom of his if his son ask bread will he give him a stone or vfe as fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give you things to them that ask him but you have to ask in faith faith is a revelation ask in Revelation and this is the confidence that we have in him if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us you have to know the will of God and this was what a purpose prayed about so that you can stand perfect in the will of God knowing the will of God hallelujah James 4:3 said you ask and receive not why the reason is you ask amiss you have a wrong reason for asking something in prayer you have a wrong motive you want to get healed so you can party again you want to get healed so you can go out there in the world I wonder God is not listening to your prayers you have the wrong motive you ask a mess that she may consume it upon your loss hallelujah brother Branham says don't think of yourself more highly than the others we're on the same level here there's no big eyes and small use we're all children of God better Bream says if the brother you think is a little wrong or the sister saying Lord don't let me never have a root of bitterness spring up because it will affect him and it will take Christ out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you and it will it will run him from the tabernacle here it will kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here and it will hurt your pastor it will do everything see don't do that don't hold any bitterness against anybody people hurt you but don't hold it against them people killed the Lord Jesus but before he died he utter despair Father forgive them for they know not what they do he actually forgave the ones that killed him are you listening he actually loved the ones that hurt him and nailed him to the cross he loved them that's why when James and John reported to the Lord that the samaritan village they didn't want to receive him they were they wanting their wanting to know well what do you want us to do would should we call fire - for fire to come down from heaven and consume these people listen to the words of the Lord the Lord said you don't know what spirit you are all disciples walking with Jesus ministering with Jesus for three and a half years chosen by Jesus himself but they are of a wrong spirit think about it you can be a believer this message and have a wrong spirit about you Alleluia and then it said the Son of man came to save these people I did not come to kill this people I came to save that should be a lesson to all of us he came to save and we don't know who he will say we really don't know if you think about it God's the only one that knows you know what I learned in ministry benebalm said preach as if everybody will believe even though we all know not everyone don't believe only those that have been progestin ated before the foundation of the world will believe but you cannot be selective when you preach I'm only going to preach about these people because I know they will believe it they're easy to preach to not them people these are gangster these are drug lords who are you to say that's the only one that knows hallelujah and it's the wrong spirit to try to discriminate people and Balram says pray as if everyone is going to get me get here but we understand that not all that everybody is going to get here only those that have enough faith to be healed will be healed what a lesson that is that should be our approach that should be our attitude every time we we try to share the Word of God to people don't try to label them anything think of them as a soul that has a chance to be saved hallelujah low to God even those that do wrong those that that are living in sin we don't have a right to discriminate them listen to this quotation the church in this condition god you sweated it out for us the Holy Spirit come down and convince people that they were wrong they were sinning their spirits were arrogant they become hostile snoopy okay stupid what does it mean snooping on other people's lives the best way to do it is Facebook you become they become hostile Snoopy know-it-all I don't need anybody I know the meeting the deacons who tell me what to do I don't think no pastor no she don't know it I'm not willing to repent not willing to forgive people that's done things wrong against them they wasn't willing to but today the Holy Spirit took the Word of God place it right in their gentle hearts I hope this is what this God is doing today right in our midst he's pulling the Holy Spirit and placing it in gentle hearts and said no do you want to come back to where you watch the first time you come to the altar come back to where everybody you love everybody and you love me with undying love and doesn't then just rise up and come to the altar you don't want to be the church boss third John chapter 1 verse 19 to 10 this is the church church boss now I wrote unto you to the church but they ought Diotrephes who love it to help the preeminence among them receive it as not were for if I come I will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither that he himself received a Brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casting about casted them out of the church now this is the church the church boss if I say it's not okay then it's not okay if I say don't start the ship with this group of people you're not the fellows for this group of people if I don't receive you nobody else should be dis receive you and the church boss I have the preeminence here the three Church Jesus Christ as the preeminence he's the only one that has the preeminence hallelujah Colossians chapter 1 verse 28 whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom what's the purpose that they may present that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus so by the sample I believe this is the main purpose of ministry is to be able to teach everyone so that we can present every man perfect in Christ Jesus is that your purpose last verse then we'll close in Luke chapter 22 verse 32 Jesus Christ told Peter but I have prayed for you Peter that by faith fail not and look at business next part of the verse and when thou art converted strengthen your brethren Jesus did not say Peter you're too hot-headed too hot-headed too big mountain to arrogant you will never make it but the Lord said but Peter I have prayed for you that your faith fail not knowing that Peter would deny him three times after Jesus said that Peter denied him three times you know if you put yourself in the position of Jesus you see Peter denying you three times you'd think Peters Peters faith failed he denied the Lord three times but it wasn't too late for Peter he was able to bounce back from there and receive the Holy Ghost on the day of panicle and became the spokesman of the church on the day of Pentecost and received the keys to the kingdom of heaven amen hallelujah and he heard the word upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell will never prevail against this I give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven hallelujah Jesus prayed for Peter but the story did not end there but jesus said after you're converted after you're perfected there's something you should do strengthen your brethren so you think you're perfect you think you're already sanctified you already have the Holy Ghost you've been adapted to this to the body of Christ the kingdom of God you have something to do pray for the perfection of others because if they don't make it you won't make it there won't be a rapture amen the rapture is not going to take place for three months one day some of you will be Lim missing and then the next day the rest others will be missing little by little huh the nothing's gonna take it's not gonna take place that way the rapture is gonna take place in one at all at one time because this is a corporal thing and we are enjoying corporal grace from God hallelujah you need me I need you can you shake the hands of the one sitting beside you and say you can't make it without me you can't make it without me might as well pray for me pray for my well-being if I have a weakness pray for me labor hard like a profess don't don't cease to pray for me hallelujah maybe I denied the message sometimes I denied the Lord Peter did two three times but that doesn't mean he has already failed amen after your converted help your brothers strengthen edify the people of God be our strength to your church forever you are be faithful to your line of duty if your cause to be the janitor of our answer be the best damn janitor it can be you've got to be a mother the children be the best mother you can be hallelujah well god bless you [Applause] [Applause] believe you can recall things that even even quotes that I've stated here you before preaching on Sunday services and even of things that have been spoken on Thursday services filling up that which is left of the sufferings of Christ and that was for the body and it's true that this is an echo but the Brian I've got an echo here it's it's so true I don't want to add to that but I tell you if everything that we do and when we do it all of our actions and everything I believe we ought to consider is for the whole body brother branham he actually makes the statement in the message in the adoption series he says that it's not only lining up with God but it's lining up with one another and that's part of the body of Jesus Christ and I believe that you believe that I really believe that with all of my heart I want I want more of that in my life and I'll tell you that's really the things that I've been seeing and been witnessing within even my own life I want more of it it's a great great great victory it's a great victory you know to think of it that the Lord Jesus himself when that woman was brought and she was guilty of adultery but What did he say neither do i condemn you go and sin no more is that right then he went to Calvary he took it he took it for all of us and you know sometimes in reality for a church you've got to take it sometimes you got to take it as a pastor sometimes I have to take it you have to do it I don't say that to Pat myself on the back I say that because you know what it's it it's in you and it's within me to want to defend it's there is one to defend we've seen that very beginning of the fall she did this he did that she did this she that's that's part of that first nature but that inward part see the part is what God's dealing with maturity maturity is in our knowledge of the mystery maturity is is recognizing that opposing spirit and not allowing it to work within our lives that's part of maturity maturity isn't that you don't make mistakes you know that that's not maturity maturity is you recognize it and quickly turn from it that's maturity maturity is recognizing the importance of those things and we're a body I think of the things even as I stood here on Thursday night in other parts member we talked about the puzzle I don't know when that was before I ministered last Sunday or what-have-you but the puzzle you can't put a whole puzzle together with just one piece missing and when Paul alludes to even this of the body you can't just have one system of the body and call it a body you can't have just a circulatory system and say we got a body no it's part of the body so it's all part of the body of Jesus Christ in the wonderful you say Lord helped me just to be faithful to the part let me take my from you Lord that the rest of this great program of God might go forward without any interruption I believe he's faithful don't you well I tell you what I just appreciate the Lord so much he's so good to us amen some of these very things that just wasn't counsel this week something's very very things that was spoken right here the individual could identify a set word by word I tell you God is so good at me he's so good he is so faithful and so mindful of our needs oh I love it the Lord is so good to us I want to be more I want to be more and more like him amen and we love this don't we because this is the part and I'm not I don't mean to keep you but this is a part us a message that is so short called humble thyself it's so short it's a shorter that I think it's one of the shortest messages besides one in a million brother branham he deals with that and he says we want to see the working of that third pool in our midst the working of Christ he said then it will take every one of us working in humility brother BAM you know he gets up and he he comes back to it again after brother Vail speaks in the middle of it he comes back to it again and I believe that that is exactly our long as a believer we want to see more of God we want to see more of him in our life and the reality of it is is that it's it's us that keeps him from us not seeing more of me but all how glorious it is we can say Lord a sacrifice is a sacrifice let me sacrifice in order that you might be glorified you're loving the word just reaches down and just challenges that's doing it amen oh my I just love him I just so appreciate that brother royal that was so rich so rich I you know there's messages and there's things I always enjoy I always feed and there are things it's like this that was said that I believe that how the Lord brought it here this morning I just these are things that I just so so appreciate so much Amen from the word of the Lord amen so we want to continue to remember them in prayer Roel when sister Cindy and the the work that is going on there within the Philippines and you know I I told you what I'm gonna preach after this but I the points that brother Rowell made and I think they were so so clearly identified I think with every one of us myself was God first got ahold of my life I looked at it when I would witness to someone and I had to approach I rushed right in to introduce the message I was so and I looked at it in a manner of saying if they didn't see it and they resisted it you know something's wrong I was wrong and God brought me around to that reality and every one of us have been there every one of us you can see this is what this is the understanding that we have it's like this remote presentation or looking and the word the objective is first of all look at the condition of where maybe the person is and I don't care if they've got a nice suit and whatever more but you look at the condition of that soul and you think of that how can I help them sometimes I've never said anything to them to go into the gospel but I'll see them and I can start talking to I don't know oh god what could be the day could this be of soul right here I don't know but I know one thing wherever I go I want to leave that place better than when I got there because after all the gospel is not a letter it's an action it's a life that's that's to be lived to reach out to that life amen don't you loving it all the results are in God's hands it's not up for me me or you can't make no one elect me there can we make someone who is not that and the beauty of it is just shine your light that's the beauty of it you know you remember the quote I read here some time ago we were talking about billboards on the Thursday nights you know let your light shine brother Graham said concerning when you go he said to a man is putting a roof on and that man may be using a hammer he said and you've got an automatic nail and he said don't walk up to him and say what you got is no count he said you'll never hear you but what you present is say my you're a good roofer why you doing this job and really mean it really mean it they doing a tremendous job but he says then they say hey have you ever considered this you know this this right here have you ever seen one of these he says and then the man saying no I never seen one else he said then you can freeze that what you brother brems says it's nothing wrong with what we have he says it's our presentation it's our presentation oh my I say Lord Jesus it's like this screen right here that have all these little chips on it to try to bring reflections or colors that's what we want our lives to be doing is live Lord and let all the little chips the diamond chips let it reflect you just right oh hey man I I didn't say those things to take your time I just my heart just just so bubbling up you know you know my heart when I look across these things when this is being preached today I don't just see this as a church I don't see this just as a message of a church I see if at first as a father I see Peppers as a grandfather grandparent seeing needs he's very sensitive and I see it all across yeah you brought you probably think oh we're gonna hear this again thank you brother oh thank you for yielding sister Cindy thank you for standing behind him everything okay amen so appreciate that could we just bow our heads and we're just gonna let you be dismissed amen Lord Jesus I don't even feel like the words think you would cover it the Lord we're grateful this morning that you spoke to the depths of our hearts these are things Lord that are not just simple this is depth Floyd it's our life it's the molding it's character it's laying down of our lives Lord honing in well God in the great purpose that is so grabbed ahold of our lives [Music] lord I pray I want to take these things and we want to take him Lord as an assembly and I want to pray over Boyd you want to pray over these things Oh God not only for my own life but for the lives of others Lord each and every one in this assembly for it is the truth Lord those things Lord you know that you come and just broke it right out here this morning but has bubbled up Lord through my heart Oh God we are a body we are a unit Lord Jesus Oh God we need one another that part of Christ and my brother my sister I need that Lord as much as they need that part of Christ in me we need one another Lord like a a great puzzle Lord each having its piece and part and Lord within it and father may we continue to shine that light Lord father when circumstances sometimes can be discouraging when we don't see results but Lord God may we stand upon your word and faith to know that your word will not return back to you void sometimes Lord it's how do we even respond and react after that word has been shared and it's seemingly no result that we can see but o God we recognize more and more as mature believers that results itself that we can see on the outside must first become a reality on the inside Lord as your prophet told us and we see it so clearly you hid in the death of Christ but you were manifested in the resurrection so lord help us to die to ourselves that it might be made manifest through our lives Lord O God for forgiveness and all of these great attributes Lord are not things that we do with our lips but they are conditions of our heart Lord oh Jesus let our heart O God be inline and in tune with you Lord then father it will reflect on the outside as a great picture show of redemptive grace or God and mercy Lord that is extended one to another father we love you Lord and we say Amen this rapture is a rapture of the entire body of Jesus Christ this is our burden this is what we are praying for Lord all Lord thank you Father this morning I pray that you'll just refresh your children lord i I just know Lord oh god from the attentiveness our hearts of hunger Lord and we have been fed this morning from your table would Oh God would you refresh each and every one now go with us Lord as we go our separate ways for the work that's going in the Philippines Lord O God we pray that you'll just richly strengthen the Brethren Lord Oh God just granting Lord just increase Oh God that this work

Christ god bless you for a visitor's was here god bless you this morning amen certainly appreciated having you here why don't we turn around and shake hands one anothers you're being dismissed in the name of the Lord and greet one another in Christian love thank you Jesus [Music] [Music] cancer [Music] [Music] no one else can touch a heart back here [Music] it says wrong [Music] falling in love Jesus [Music] only we love
