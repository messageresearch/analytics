And he's still he's still bringing us along. You know, we're standing here tonight. We're here seated tonight standing and we're trusting him. You know, in one reality, it's just some things that Brother Trevor and I just just fellowshipping about, you know, within today. And it's really the the real heart of the gospel is rest. and just how that it's not about what you can do. It's about accepting what he's already done. It's the same way in every in every part of our life. It's, you know, you've heard me give my testimony many times. There wasn't one thing that I quit. Wasn't one thing I stopped, but it's what he did.

And you know, one thing I'm grateful about God. I'm glad that God didn't get me and push me behind the back and say, "Come on, boy. You need to keep you need you need I'm glad that God he's not a pusher. It's not the three pushes. It's the three pulls. &gt;&gt; Not the three shves. It's the three pulls.

I I just so appreciate each and every one of you the sacrifice being out here tonight on this nice, warm, lovely Northern Ohio evening. It is warm compared to what we're going to be facing on Monday. But it's good to be together, isn't it? And I appreciate it. just uh want to say thank you. I just so appreciate your sacrifice and I know there's always things you have to lay aside on Saturday where you in order to be here for the meeting and but I believe and I pray that God will just so richly bless you. &gt;&gt; How many say that say Lord you you've done it before &gt;&gt; and I pray that God just blesses each of us ju each of you so richly. Amen. Tonight amen for all the efforts and sacrifice that's been made. And we're just we're we're glad to have our friend with us tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Trevor is a friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a real friend here to Believer Spoken Word Tabernacle as well as to uh Brother Nathaniel and and the saints there. And of course, Brother Nathaniel wasn't able to be here tonight. Um just some sickness. And of course, we know what that's about. And so, we want to just hold Sister Charity and some of the kids up in prayer. And I know we've got different ones that would have been here as well, but of sickness. But I'm thankful he's still Jehovah Rafa. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we just thank God. We want to remember, I don't know if on the request it was read about Sister Rachel Hannah. We sent that out to you, but please be in prayer for her uh tomorrow morning. Um that for the the surgery and also just want to have prayer that the Lord will just there's she's been able to get comfortable. But those of you know what it's like when you're in the hospital and there's only so much with that they can give you to kind of, you know, calm you down. So, she has to have her gallbladder removed tomorrow morning. U but we we thank God for his mercy. And we thank God for doctors because God performs miracles as the prophet taught us through surgery. So, we just um maybe as we stand and we can just have special prayer for sister Rachel and also brother brother Nathaniel's family and I know others and we may have already prayed about it but I don't believe we can pray too much. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so let's just pray together and as we pray just invite God just uh Lord speak to my heart. You know my needs and um I take take the gift in brother Trevor's life and just just speak to me tonight Lord. Heavenly Father, oh God, how we are so thankful for your mercy and your grace. So grateful, oh God, to really be a real partaker of what you have done on Calvary and through the resurrection. I appreciate, Lord, as I look out here just seeing all the sacrifice, Lord, where I know things have been laid aside in order to be here tonight. Father, if I could see that, how much more can you see, Lord? I pray that God that you would so pour out of your blessings Lord to every need tonight. Grant it Lord may you overrun our cups Lord with your presence. I pray that God that you'll just move Lord Brother Trevor aside and just speak to our hearts in such a personal way. And Lord we remember Lord Brother Nathaniel's family tonight. Lord they wanted to be here. And I know there's others, Lord, in the assembly here that wanted to be as well. Would you go, Lord, to Sister Charity's need and the children there, Lord, and and sickness, Lord God, like them. There's many of us, Lord, been through weeks of it, Lord. But I pray that God, you'll touch them. May the angel of the Lord, make a visitation right there tonight, Lord God. May you touch them, Lord, and give them strength, Lord. I pray in their bodies, Lord, through each one for every need. And for Sister Rachel, Lord, I pray, God, that you would just move down, Lord, in that hospital there tonight, Lord. I pray that God that you would just just sweep over her, Lord, tonight. I pray, Father, may there be such a calmness and such a peace, Lord God. And there'd be such a rest, Lord God, that she would, Lord, receive tonight. Father, we just ask that you would guide and direct, Lord, the hands of the doctors tomorrow. Lord, we know it's there's nothing that's impossible with you, Lord.

Amen. Amen. Brother Trevor, come on. You are awesome in this place, mighty God. Yes, you are awesome in this place of the father. &gt;&gt; You are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awesome in this place. My God mighty God. &gt;&gt; Yes you are awesome in this place. My mighty God. You are awesome in this race. &gt;&gt; I'm a father.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Good to be gathered together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I want to just greet you and uh thank you musicians. Appreciate it very much. We'll get right into the word. Not that don't be scared there. Just, you know, we got to get right into the word. There's a lot. That's not what I mean. I just, you know, we we we've had a wonderful song service and I don't think we need much for introduction, so we can just get right into it. I'm excited about this this topic tonight. Have you turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 6? Um, we'll just look at a few verses here before we get into our thought. And um, of course, happy to be back in our normal January thing. Brother Samuel put me on the calendar before I even confirmed with him that I was coming. I said, "Okay, brother." Like, "Hey, is you know, how's this work?" He's like, "It's already on the calendar." And I was like, "Well, I'm just now telling you I will be there." So, but um happy to happy to be back, of course, and and be in fellowship together. So 1 Corinthians chapter 6, we'll look at verse 12, and it says, "All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any." Also look at verse 19. What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God? and ye are not your own. Okay, the back screen's just in up tonight. That's fine. I have it here. It's all It's all good. I just wanted to make sure that that's that's working. So, praise the Lord. So, just just a real quick comment on this on this uh verse right here before we go to um chapter 15 for another verse. Um, so what what Paul is saying is here your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which which tells you that your body is not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's the temple of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And that's a that's a pretty important distinction &gt;&gt; because sometimes we judge our body as if it should be the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? And that's not fair because it's the temple of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own. Um looked at verse or chapter 15 and verse 31. We look at it and Paul says here I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I die daily. This is the Apostle Paul speaking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we look to you tonight for everything. Father, we look to you as we've sang. You are awesome in this place. And we know because of your promise that you are here with us, Lord. We can feel your spirit, Lord. Lord, we're asking for your anointing, Lord, to to use me and to to speak to the hearts. And Lord, that we would that we would grow in you and that we would Lord that we would Lord whatever happens Lord may you be glorified &gt;&gt; because Lord we see that you are truth and that you are good Lord and Father we just want to be wrapped up in your love and in your truth father as brother Samuel said it how how this is just about rest father so tonight Lord may we rest may we truly see the rest that we have in you Lord God and Lord even as maybe I feel pressured, Lord, to perform or to preach well. But Father, may even myself, may I just rest that you may take hold of your gift and use it, Lord, tonight. We ask it, Lord, and give you the glory and honor and praise in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You may be seated. So, this now that we've we've read 1 Corinthians, our title tonight is Romans 7. uh that which I do I allow not. But I want to look at these very quickly again in 1 Corinthians before we get into Romans 7 to recognize as as I've said this is this is the Apostle Paul speaking. He says I will not be brought under the power of any. Why is Paul talking about that? What is Paul saying? like, you know, we we we need to make sure and not that we're going to, you know, update our Bible versions and get out of King James or New King James, whatever it is you might use, you know, so that we can get in to some contemporary weird paraphrase or whatever, but but to like but to recognize like this language has meaning and and and you know, and we we look at it as, you know, so much so many times we look at Paul and it's like that's old, that's history, that's you know, it's it's not like now, but it is like now like Paul Paul, it's not like Paul was different than us. It's not like Paul is going through different, you know, experiences. I mean, yes, he doesn't have a car. He doesn't have air conditioning. You know, we'd pray for him, but you know, he's well, it was historical a bit, but you know, BUT IT'S BUT IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT THAT HE'S living a different life. It's not that he's feeling different FEELINGS OR HAVING DIFFERENT THOUGHTS like not that he's not dealing with different things. He's he's dealing with things that are PULLING AT HIS BODY that are pulling on his flesh to WHERE HE HAS SO TO WHERE HE IN in in a moment of of writing is writing and saying, "Look, there are all kinds OF THINGS THAT MAY BE GOOD OR MAYBE BAD, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE POWER OF THAT THING. Though I WOULD FEEL PULLED BY THOSE THINGS, though I would be susceptible to those things." Yes, even the apostle Paul, the first church age messenger would have been susceptible to be bring being brought under the power of of any kind of habit or any dare I say to use a 2026 now word addiction &gt;&gt; because if YOU'RE BROUGHT UNDER THE POWER of something and you're going why am I doing this? I I don't I shouldn't and but I just I can't seem TO HELP MYSELF. WHAT IS THAT? But that's an addiction. AND SO PAUL IS SAYING, I DON'T WANT TO BE BROUGHT INTO ANY ADDICTION. I DON'T WANT TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE POWER OF ANYTHING. EVEN if it's a dis, you know, EVEN IF IT'S A GOOD ADDICTION, &gt;&gt; what's a good addiction? Brother Trevor was like, "Well, we have no problem with coffee addictions, you know. We just we just don't we just I might not be invited back anyway." BUT, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE PRO LIKE THAT'S IT'S LIKE, WELL, THAT'S FINE. You know, it's drugs, but it's you know, it's legal. And it's it's socially acceptable drug addictions. That's that's what it is. And you know that, you know, like don't just point your FINGERS AT BROTHER SAMUEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, you have yours, too. &gt;&gt; You know, and we'll be, you know, brought under the power of me. No, and not be invited back. And praise the Lord. There we go. SO, SO EVEN THE APOSTLE PAUL IS TALKING ABOUT I DON'T WANT TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE POWER OF THIS THING. I DON'T WANT THESE things to CONTROL ME BECAUSE I WANT MY FREEDOM in Christ though some things are lawful and some things wouldn't be. I DON'T WANT TO BE BROUGHT I DON'T WANT THESE THINGS CONTROLLING ME. And we we talked to the youth uh last night and and we talked about liberty and choice and how you know how these things go together. You can't have choice IF YOU DON'T HAVE LIBERTY. And so if you GIVE AWAY SOME OF YOUR LIBERTY TO SOME ADDICTION, IT NOW IS NARROWING CHOICE DOWN IN YOUR LIFE. AND SO THEN AS WE SAID, THE body is the TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND YOU ARE NOT your own. But that that does mean that yes, your body is not the Holy Ghost. Your flesh until look until we take until Jesus comes and we take a rapture and and are there with him for three and a half years a marriage supper and come back on this earth in the millennium WITH A GLORIFIED BODY BECAUSE WE'LL BE CHANGED in a moment in a twinkling of an eye. Your flesh will never be perfect until the millennium. That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; Guess what? &gt;&gt; Jesus died to make your flesh perfect. &gt;&gt; It was his atonement. DON'T EXPECT THAT YOUR FLESH WILL BE PERFECT OR SOMEHOW YOU WON'T YOU WON'T EVER HAVE A FAILURE OR EVER make a mistake. &gt;&gt; This is the sermon where brother Trevor helps you feel good about your own sins. No, no, there's a point to it here. You might feel that way for a while. Um, but we're because we we want to talk about righteousness and how how we become righteous. And so anyway, and then we we we into 1 Corinthians 15 again, we're talking about the Apostle Paul, seventh church age messenger, one of the stars and the right hand of God in the book of Revelation. Like what a position. But he HIMSELF HAS TO DIE DAILY. WHY? Because there's things in his life, there's things in his flesh that he is struggling over that he is that he is learning to overcome by the sacrificial death of his own will to that thing. &gt;&gt; How many want to be like the Apostle Paul? &gt;&gt; You know, you know, I mean, hey, cuz he was a man &gt;&gt; like we are. or woman, of course. So, we want to turn now into Romans chapter 7. If is it okay if I lower this a little bit because I just feel like I'm popping it and if it's a problem, I'll bring it back up. But, um, Romans chapter 7, we're going to start at verse 14. And so I, you know, I was I was talking to a friend of mine about this chapter and I was like, "Yeah, Romans 7, you know, and I'm just talking about as if as if he just knows what Romans 7 is." And, you know, he's like, "Trevor, I hate you so much because you're so smart. You know these things, you know?" I was like, "Could you tell me what you're talking about because you just said ROMANS 7 IS IF I KNEW?" AND I WAS LIKE, AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY." like yeah that's this you know it's this the which I do I allow not you know scripture because AND AND I JUST I just thought like everybody knows that because I just remember you know being 15 16 whatever teen and reading this scripture and going oho someone knows me &gt;&gt; like like Lord help me from help me to move my life from Romans 7 to Romans 8 &gt;&gt; you know I really want to get in Roman Romans 8 cuz I feel like I'm STUCK IN ROMANS 7. AND SO I just feel like like I just expected that when I say Romans 7, you know, that everybody understood because everyone else has been there. &gt;&gt; Like you read this, you went, "Yes, this is just it should be LIKE WE SHOULD ALL KNOW WHAT THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S just our life," &gt;&gt; you know. And so anyway, maybe maybe you'll understand more when we read this if you don't yet. But um verse 14, for we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal sold under sin. For that which I do, I allow not. For what I would, that do I, that do I not. But what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I consented to the law that is good. You know, and if I would just sped through this, you know, if I was just reading this at, you know, at preacher fast, you know, for that which I would, I do, I allow not. For that would I do not. That what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I do, and everybody's like, wait, whoa, how what, Paul? What? you know, and and and sometimes we we go through this and we're like, I have maybe William Shakespeare understood what you were saying, but uh but I'm not William Shakespeare, so I mean so it's JUST LIKE LET'S SLOW DOWN LIKE LET'S PROCESS this like let's look at this, you know, and so for that which I do uh for that which I do I allow not. SO PAUL IS SAYING THE THINGS THAT I DO, these are the things that I don't wish I I don't allow myself to do. Wait, wait a second. If you don't allow yourself to do it, why are you doing it? Right? You know, for that for that which I would I don't do. But but here but the things that I Oh, I hate that thing, man. I will Oh, I hate that. I Yeah, we're doing this. How how many want to be like the Apostle Paul? &gt;&gt; Do you think he's JUST DO YOU THINK HE'S just writing like Yeah, mere mortals are like this. Uh not seventh church age messengers like myself, you know, we don't uh I'm writing about your experience, not mine. &gt;&gt; No, Paul is writing something very human, VERY VERY NORMAL. PAUL IS WRITING ABOUT HIS own life, &gt;&gt; he's not I do, I allow. He's talking about himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not. So Paul is like this is these are the things that are good. I need to do this. I know I should do this. Everything in me says do this. Oh, hey. For the good that I would, I don't do the evil which I would not that I do. Now then, if I do that that I would not, it's no more I that do it, but it's sin that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, waring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members. And I really love this next verse. I'm so glad Paul wrote this next verse because what I love about it is Paul Paul, you know, Paul exclaims something here and I'm just like, "Thank you, Paul, BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE FELT like this AND NOT KNOWN HOW DO I WHAT DO I SAY?" AND PAUL SAYS, "OH WRETCHED MAN THAT I am, &gt;&gt; who shall deliver me FROM THE BODY OF THIS DEATH?" AND I'm so like I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW OFTEN I HAVE QUOTED THIS VERSE. &gt;&gt; Maybe not out loud, maybe under my breath as I go. I hate that thing. Oh, wretched man. &gt;&gt; God, deliver me from the body of this death. &gt;&gt; I hate myself. Why am I doing this? The Apostle Paul gave us this language. &gt;&gt; You see, it's this sermon about you feeling better about your failures. It's all we're going to talk about. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself self serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. SO HERE WE ARE AND WE FIND OURSELVES JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL FOUND OUR HIMSELF STRUGGLING with things in our life. Struggling with powers, ADDICTIONS IS OUR IS OUR 2026 WORD FOR IT. If there's something you hate that you're doing &gt;&gt; I mean what do we call that today? &gt;&gt; Like I mean it's it's an addiction. I hate that thing. Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; I NEED POWER OVER THIS THING. &gt;&gt; WHAT do I DO? CUZ I SHOULDN'T DO THAT AND IT'S WRONG. AND SO TODAY WE STRUGGLE. THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S MANY THINGS OUT THERE, YOU KNOW, AND AND YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE YOU KNOW, BACK IN the days of your I said that recently and somebody was like, "What on earth does that even mean?" We're just old days, you know? How old? I older. Okay. Just just let's go 1800s. Okay, if there was an addiction in the 1800s, it was, you know, in somebody was ADDICTED TO SOMETHING, WE PROBABLY KNEW BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS USUALLY A SUBSTANCE THERE. There was there was smoking, there was drinking, there was, you know, there was there was something on the outside that could be seen that was an addiction. And everybody, you know, so there was a little bit of a social, you know, uh, stigma to an addiction because you could, you know, at least you like, yeah, that's the town drunk. What does that mean? IS THAT THAT'S THE GUY IN the town that's that's addicted to alcohol and and and maybe he even hates it, but he's he just he's screaming, "Oh, wretched man. I I shouldn't have done that." Anyway, you know, LIKE, RIGHT, HE'S GOT PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; But it's 2026 now. We're so like we're we it's those ARE STILL THOSE ARE STILL PROBLEMATIC. BUT BUT THERE'S so many more now because science in OUR DAY HAS FIGURED OUT HOW ADDICTIONS even happen. &gt;&gt; AND THEY'VE NOW HIJACKED AND tuned to addict you so that they can make money &gt;&gt; AND MONETIZED ADDICTIONS. AND NOW THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. NOW THEIR VIDEO GAMES AND PHONES AND BLAH BLAH blah blah blah. SOCIAL MEDIA, ALL THIS STUFF THAT preachers preach about is so terrible in our age and killing us all. STOP DOING IT. NO, THAT'S NOT THIS SERMON. RIGHT. But it's that but if that's if like this sermon isn't for the unconverted, this sermon isn't YOU NEED JESUS COME. NO, THIS SERMON THIS SERMON UNDERSTANDS YOU. YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN SAVED. YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN CONVERTED. AND YOU YOU ARE FINDING YOURSELF DRAWN TO THINGS JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And saying, "GOD, I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS THING. MY I FEEL THEY'RE SO WRETCHED. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S SO MANY THINGS IN 2026. I'M BEING PULLED BY AND I KNOW IT'S NOT HEALTHY. I KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT, &gt;&gt; you know. And so, you know, it's like, well, hey, what what do we do about it then? What what is it that we you know what's the answer? Brother Trevor, give us the sevenstep program to getting over social media in 2026. And if we follow your new guide available on messageteer.com, you can No, it's not there. I'm just kidding. I had to mention my website for Sister Kayla. She was like, "What? You have a website?" So anyway, but you know, brother Trevor, I WANT TO BE RIGHTEOUS. I WANT TO GET OVER THIS THING. I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO SCREAM, oh wretched man that I am. WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT THIS? GIVE ME THE WAY. HOW WHAT'S PAUL GOING TO TELL US TO, HEY, TO GET OVER THIS THING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, SO THAT GOD CAN JUST PUT OURSELVES IN THE CHANNEL WHERE GOD JUST GOES BOOM, YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE AND IT'S OVER FOR YOU. Anybody ever prayed that &gt;&gt; Lord just just I am so wretched. &gt;&gt; Take this thing because you know I mean we are at you know 998 Lord. Two more and we're going to have to go to four digits and counting how many times I have failed in this thing. I obviously Lord am too much of a loser to get over this thing. And so I'm just going to need you to come and take this away. &gt;&gt; How we doing? Everybody there? &gt;&gt; Anybody? Right. I mean, just so you know, is just me saying what I've said, what I've dealt with and and and surely YOU'VE STRUGGLED IN THE SAME IN SOME THINGS IN THE SAME AREAS AND AND AND GOD SCREAMED OUT, "OH, WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM. WHO SHALL DELIVER ME FROM THE BODY of this death? And and so, YOU KNOW, AS I WAS STUDYING AND PUTTING THIS sermon together, um, Brother Barry had asked me to do a a youth meeting. And so, this this was on my heart and I was just putting some things together and I was looking for something. I remember on my on my phone. And I don't even remember what I was looking for, but I was I was um you know, searching through some some older texts and and I came across this this text message that I had gotten from a sister and and you know and I just AND I WAS LIKE, WOW, THIS IS Romans 7 in modern language. And I just thought, how man, I'm gonna I'm gonna use this. And so after I got done, I asked her for permission and she was good with it. I should have probably asked before, but well anyway, so we redacted the names and protected the innocent and all of that and but I thought but BUT IT YOU KNOW I JUST I SAW THIS AND I THOUGHT Lord how many how many are right here and and need and and need ENCOURAGEMENT AND NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHAT GOD IS SAYING AND HOW HE'S HOW WHAT THE PLAN THAT HE HAS FOR US. And so I thought, well, this would be I I just believe that this would this would be very meaningful for us to understand Romans chapter 7, maybe in a more modern language. Hello, brother Trevor. I'm so and I'm sorry for disturbing you. There's just something I would like to talk to you about. You see, I have been a Christian my whole life. &gt;&gt; This is the this is an interactive part of the sermon, just so you know. So if you can identify with this sermon when I pause awkwardly, you just go ahead and raise your hand. &gt;&gt; So okay, I was born in the message. &gt;&gt; And all my life I tried to live a Christian life. &gt;&gt; I got baptized at 13 years old. We can act like I got baptized young in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Okay. And I always tried to live how I ought to not not so bad, right? Okay. Pretty good person here. However, I started to go downhill since a few weeks. There was a time I felt far from God because of sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, I would be ashamed and I would feel too bad to pray &gt;&gt; and go to church. I sinned and I did something I knew I could not do but still did it. &gt;&gt; Wait, where have I heard that before? I I I the things I could not that I do. &gt;&gt; And I was like, I don't know if this sister knows it, but she's identifying herself with the Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; Sounds terrible, doesn't it? I mean, my goodness, how could you identify yourself with the Apostle Paul? I mean, out of all of the scripture that you could people in this scripture, you can identify yourself, you know, it's not Herod, right? I mean this is like you're you're SPEAKING LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL not Herod &gt;&gt; and after doing it I would feel bad and ask for forgiveness &gt;&gt; but then when I'm in this situation again I would fall again and sin again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks, bro. You You were getting ahead of me there, right? &gt;&gt; So, what advice do you give? Put yourself in my shoes. You got a text from a young person that needs help and this is what she's saying. What's the answer? Now, you don't have to shout out the answers. This is just that part where we just sit here and think about it and we come up with all the answers that we can come up with. And then, you know, Ben knows this is the part where it's like, doesn't matter what answer I come up with, it's going to be wrong. He's going to destroy it. What's like what but like what's our standard message answers? You know, like what do what ARE WE GOING TO SAY? What are we going to do? WHAT? WHAT? WELL, SISTER, YOU KNOW, UH PROBABLY BE GOOD TO get away from these things, you know, probably be good to be getting get some good meetings, you know, come to the altar, you know, talk to your pastor a little bit, you know, maybe I know like just get, you know, find a youth camp, sign up for a youth camp. You'll be there for an entire week. You'll be completely away from that thing. you'll have time to really reflect reflect and pray and come to the altar and seek the Lord and really really get some strength. Sound like a pretty good answer. No. No. Because you already know what the next slide's going to say. I'm pretty sure, right? This is like you're leading us to an answer we all think will be right. It obviously cannot be right. So then, SO I WAS HOPING THAT I MIGHT CHANGE at the camp and stop doing what I was doing and become a better Christian and that God would forgive me. So I prayed and cried and I felt blessed. &gt;&gt; You've been there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank God for deliverance. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, I'M NOT FALLING AGAIN. AND I WOULD NOT PERMIT it to happen again. And I felt good again. But then getting back home, I fell in the same situation again and sinned again. &gt;&gt; I just get angry at myself and cry. And I think I SHOULD NOT PRAY BECAUSE GOD HAS TO BE upset and I'm scared he PUNISHES ME. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW BECAUSE I FEEL SO BAD, WRETCHED THAT I was blessed, blessed at the camp and that God forgave me and now it's like I threw all away by falling and sinning again. &gt;&gt; Now it's LIKE I TRY TO HIDE FROM GOD. THE FLESH desires are just strong. and I do what I don't want to do because when I'm in the situation, it's like I'm not myself and I don't feel bad in the moment. But when I come back to myself, I start to cry and get angry at myself. Please, could you help me? Because I'm scared I get punished by God and he won't give me his blessings because of my attitude. I really don't know what I should do now. So, life tip, if if you don't want questions like this, don't start speaking internationally at youth camps. Just throwing that out there. JUST BECAUSE NOW, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY? What are you going to do, sister? Your life sounds uh surprisingly like my own. There's really nothing you can do. We're all in this together. And we just thank God for the grace of Jesus Christ. Go forth and trust God. I have no answer for you because we are the same. Just like the Apostle Paul. Well, that's not an answer. I guess I can't use that answer. That answer doesn't give any hope. That answer doesn't deal with any of the underlying issues. What are the underlying issues? What should we what should we look at? What how we how do I tell this the sister what she's crying out for? She wants to be righteous. She wants to do the things she she knows she should do. SHE WANTS TO DO THE THINGS THAT INSIDE IN HER DESIRES IN HER HEART OF HEARTS that Holy Spirit in her in her life. SHE'S SAYING THESE ARE THE THINGS I WANT TO DO. I WANT TO DO THEM. I HATE THOSE things and that's what I'm doing and I don't want to DO THOSE THINGS ANYMORE. I I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN AVENUES ANYMORE AND WAKE UP AND COME TO MYSELF AND GO, "What am I DOING HERE? &gt;&gt; GOD forgive me." &gt;&gt; COMING TO AN ALTAR AND repenting again and again and again until repentance fatigue has taken hold. Anybody ever felt repentance fatigue before? &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know if you've heard that as a phrase before, but it's a thing. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know, Lord, we can do this again. I can come. I can be at the altar. I can repent and I CAN BE SINCERE AND I CAN MEAN IT, LORD. But we all know what's going to happen. Sorry. Is this a little too real? Is this like &gt;&gt; Sorry. Was I Everybody's like, "How does he know me?" &gt;&gt; How do we WHAT IS SHE WANTS RIGHTEOUSNESS. SHE WANTS TO DO THIS. WE WANT TO STOP SAYING WE WANT TO STOP THANKING GOD FOR WHAT PAUL SAID. OH, WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM. LIKE, LORD, thank you for a I wanted THAT FOR A SEASON, BUT NOW I DON'T WANT TO THANK YOU THAT PAUL SAID THAT AGAIN. like I I want to be over that phase in my life. I want to step into a new era of my life that's not that I want to be righteous. Okay, praise the Lord. How do we become righteous? Well, I mean that's obvious. Stop sinning. Hello I be I began TO TELL HER, YOU KNOW, SISTER, it just seemed, you know, from what I could just knew of her life and what I could understand, I just felt like she is now she had now become and I misjudged her age by a few years, but I was essentially right that, you know, when you're, you know, when you're, you know, she talked about when she was younger, you know, SHE JUST LOVED GOD and just wanted to serve him and everything was just so simple and so easy and oh it was nice and YOU KNOW BUT NOW I struggle it's like hello you this is ex this is this is normal life because now you're coming you know now the hormones are happening in your life and your brain is getting bigger and you know all of these things now you've got all these chemical things going on and you know your amydala is fully formed which you can you so NOW YOU HAVE FULL RANGE OF emotions and the prefrontal cortex hasn't DEVELOPED UNTIL YOU'RE 25 SO YOU'VE GOT AND I'M JUST LIKE THERE'S got to be a sermon in here. I just don't know what it is. LIKE LORD, WHY DID YOU DESIGN US LIKE THIS TO HAVE A FULL range of emotions at like 16, BUT UNTIL 25 TO HAVE THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX to like control those emotions &gt;&gt; and be able to make decisions? &gt;&gt; It's like I don't know. I don't know why, but the Lord made us that way &gt;&gt; and we all go through these times. &gt;&gt; And so some of that's natural. And and so we're now we're we're we're fighting fighting against our own our own emotions and our own problems and all of these things that are going on and and things are now things are there's desires that are coming into our lives that we you know we never we never had before cuz it used to be the boys had cooties and now you looked and you're like we hi and like it used to be EASY AND NOW IT'S hard and all of these kinds of things begin to happen you know sister, some of this is that, YOU KNOW, GIVE YOURSELF a little bit of grace. You know, these these things these things are happening. You've got to, yes, there's a there's some responsibility there that we should get to a place where we control some of these things and we put up the correct safeguards and that sort of thing, but you know, BUT BUT BUT GIVE YOURSELF SOME GRACE. You know, you're the these things happen, you know, and but more than that, you know, I just wanted to discuss that as a concept because again, that's a terrible answer. It's like, "Oh, you're struggling with some sin." That's totally normal. Teenagers struggle with sin. It's okay. That's maybe not the answer. So, but we're coming to something, you know. So, I said, but what I recognized is I recognized that there wasn't hope there and there was a lot of fear there. I'm scared. SHE SAYS THAT GOD PUNISHES ME. Why are you scared that God punishes you? &gt;&gt; Is that truth or is that a lie? And so recognizing this, I thought, "OH, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SEND HER." YOU'RE probably very familiar with this quote, but in the MESSAGE BLIND BARNAMEUS, "GOD WILL NEVER JUDGE YOU FOR being a sinner. He can't judge you because you He can't judge you because sin was paid for at Calvary. And you're a not a sinner, you're a rejector. See, he judges you for rejecting salvation when it's been offered to you. BUT JESUS, JOHN, WHEN HE SAW HIM, HE SAID, "BEHOLD, the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." And all sin question was settled at Calvary. So, so explain to So I told her, I said, "Look, sister, I want you to read this quote every day for two weeks, not because it's some kind of mantra or some kind of, you know, work yourself into THIS QUOTE." AND NO, BECAUSE I I SHE SHE IS SO SHE WAS SO FAR FROM removed from the truth of this quote that I needed HER TO TO ESTABLISH HERSELF IN THIS word in this truth because she could never move on UNTIL SHE RECOGNIZED THAT GOD WAS HE MAD AT HER FOR her sin? WELL, HE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT it before THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD and had ALREADY PREDETERMINED THAT HE WOULD COME IN THE FORM OF JESUS CHRIST AND THAT JOHN COULD SAY, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD." THAT MEANS ALL THE SIN. AND SO GOD CAN NO LONGER BE MAD AND WANT TO PUNISH YOU BECAUSE ALL PUNISHMENT FOR SIN HAS ALREADY BEEN POURED OUT on one man. &gt;&gt; So you CANNOT BE SCARED OF GOD PUNISHING YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NO PUNISHMENT LEFT FROM GOD TO POUR OUT. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL SORRY FOR JESUS AND SAY, "WELL, YOU TOOK YOU TOOK SO MUCH PUNISHMENT." YOU KNOW, I REALLY SHOULD TAKE SOME OF THAT BACK. &gt;&gt; Last I checked, WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE CATHOLIC. &gt;&gt; WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN PENANCE. WE BELIEVED IN THE COMPLETE ATONEMENT OF THE OF THE DEATH OF JESUS CHRIST AT CALVARY. &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAYS, "I I JUST GET ANGRY at myself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know what that is? It's a It's mental penance." &gt;&gt; We message believers are really good at that one. You see, cuz nobody sees us, right? Nobody sees us walk on our knees with our beads up the steps to touch the feet of the statue. Nobody sees us DO THAT. OH MY. BUT oh man, does But doesn't it feel good, man? Doesn't it feel good to beat yourself up a little bit inside to atone just a little bit? Doesn't it just make you feel better? God, if I can just atone myself by just being mad at myself, &gt;&gt; even though you've already TAKEN ALL OF MY PUNISHMENT, BUT GOD, IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO JUST, I don't know, bathe completely in the GRACE OF JESUS CHRIST AND THE COMPLETE finished atonement that you have wrought for me SO EFFECTUALLY ON CALVARY. LORD, THAT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO ME. OUCH. That one was wow. So, &gt;&gt; so maybe we should READ THIS QUOTE ONCE A DAY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO BE GROUNDED THAT THE LAMB OF GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. THE PRICE HAS BEEN PAID. THAT THE THE FATHER ISN'T SITTING THERE IN JUDGMENT ANY LONGER LOOKING DOWN ON US AND SO I I'm going to don't you dare mess up again if you do you and I are going to have amen praise the Lord so I sent this to her and I told her read Romans 5 all the way to Romans 8, you know, and because what we're finding here is what we'll what we'll see is that Romans 7 is a transitional is a transitional chapter where because Paul has been speaking of grace. You know, we he started in Romans and in with with chapter 1 and talking about they they forgot God and and all of these bad things began to happen and all the way down to 2026 like problems. they men working meant with men that which is unseammly and all of these all of these issues. What? Why? Because they forgot God. AND THEN AND THEN PAUL BEGINS TO build grace in there. He begins to turn and talk ABOUT GRACE. AND YOU'LL HAVE SUCH VERSES such as, you know, the wages of sin as death, but the gift of God I is is life in in Christ Jesus our Lord, which I totally butchered that one. Did you understand like Romans 6:23 and Romans 3:23 and you know BUT BUT ROMANS 5 SHALL WE CONTINUE IN SIN THAT GRACE MAY ABOUND? GOD FORBID HOW SHALL WE who are dead TO SIN LIVE ANY LONGER THEREIN? &gt;&gt; So he's he's dealing with the concepts OF GRACE AND HE COMES TO CHAPTER 7 AND HE BEGINS TO WELL WE'RE under grace. We're living under grace, BUT WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING. BUT GRACE HASN'T TAKEN. BUT HAS GRACE MADE US RIGHTEOUS WHERE WE'RE STILL BEING PULLED DOWN THESE THINGS? AND SO HE'LL TRANSITION US THEN INTO THE SPIRITFILLED LIFE SO THAT we'll live and walk in the newness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; But the body is still the temple of that spirit. &gt;&gt; It is not that spirit. And so I sent her, you know, some of these kinds of thoughts. And so, so she said, "It helped me a lot. I was worried because I felt like I would throw the grace of God away by sinning again and again, but I really need God's help and the strength to resist the desires of the flesh. You are right. Looking back, things seemed easier and nicer. But growing and becoming more mature, I started seeing and realizing things are different as they used to be, or that it gets more complicated. And now I'm 19 years old. I just wish I would be the same Christian girl I was about three years ago. I think that's a pretty interesting line because what I would say is sister, you still are. &gt;&gt; The fact that you would reach out to a brother and ask for help on this issue indicates you are the same Christian girl you always were. &gt;&gt; That has not changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want to be the same girl again. that was close to the Lord and so innocent. I am mad at myself and sometimes I look in the mirror and speak bad at myself. I just think the Lord has to be up so upset at me and I feel a little lost again. Speaking bad at yourself in the mirror. What scripture is that? &gt;&gt; Your personal penance there. Any I mean how many people look in the mirror and you you stupid. &gt;&gt; That's not scriptural. &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm not worthy of reading the Bible and praying. It's just hard to get back to God after sinning. And I really don't want to fall again. I'm also scared that God will punish me. I'll pray and I would appreciate if you could pray also pray for me. God bless. Now, before I forget, because we'll get to the end of the sermon and I won't wrap this up. Um when I reached out to her again and said, "Sister, I just want you to know like I just felt inspired to use this. I hope that was okay. I would like to be able to continue this. I think it was a blessing for so many." And uh and I wanted to know how she was. I reached out to her. How you doing? How's this particular thing going for you? And she said, "Well, Brother Trevor, you've just written me on my wedding day." And I just I just that was beautiful, you know. So she's married and she's happy and you know still still serving the Lord. And she was so happy. &gt;&gt; She was so happy to know that her struggle and this note could be a blessing to other people and maybe somewhere in that there was some purpose in it that God can even take her problems and turn them into blessings. Okay. So, lie number one that I found out of this. My sin is probably greater than Jesus can forgive because I've known better than to do this for years. Anybody ever think that I can't be forgiven? I knew better and I did it anyway. See, that's that that that means that this is unpardonable sin. It No, no. That means I hate this thing. I know better than to do this thing. I shouldn't do this thing. Why am I doing this thing? Oh, wretched man that I am. That just means you're the Apostle Paul or similar to him. Which last time I checked, if I would have if I would have just said, "How many really wish you were just like the Apostle Paul?" You ought to have been like, "Man, that'd be an upgrade. And now we're like, man, wish that would have been an upgrade. Even after my first sin, I repented, TOLD GOD I WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN. THEN I FELL INTO it again. I obviously don't have God in me. You know, isn't it just like the devil to do these kinds of things, to say these kinds of things to you, to try to tell you, you know, one and done or 50 and done or a hundred and done or a thousand and done or a thousand and one for sure and it's over, man. I mean, there's just there's limits, right? I mean, you can only sin so many times the same thing before it's just you're just it's over. Well, it just depends. Have you rejected God? Like, have you rejected his grace? Because that's that's the issue. Have you rejected his grace or haven't you? And because he's given it to you. He's given it to you. And if the devil want if the devil can get you to say, "Well, hey, if you you know what I want you to do, Paul, I want you to keep a chart and I want you to keep a tally." And if you happen to get to more than falling more than 365 times in any given year, I you should really what you should really you should really consider that you're just not a Christian. that it's over for you and the grace of God can't help you. And if you believed that lie and rejected God's grace, that that would be problematic, far more problematic than falling into something that was pulling you, some addiction that you were struggling with 365 times in a given year. Again, it's a sermon about feeling better about your sin. which you all know is sarcasm for those that maybe don't know me so well. SO WHAT'S THE ANSWER? BROTHER TREVOR, I FALL. I LIKE I YOU SAID, "HEY, I'M REALLY HOPING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE us some hope and not just comfort about feeling good about our sin. Seems like if you if we leave right now, we'd be sitting here going, "What in the world was he tr how? What?" I love that part about Jesus Christ and the grace, but I don't it's just I'm not better. I'm not more righteous than when I came in the doors. And so what what gives brother Samuel? I don't know if we should have him again. Brother Tor, what is the answer? HOW LIKE I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS ADDICTION TO CHOCOLATE and I just, you know, I just I've PUT IT IN A BOX AND I PUT IT UNDER A lock and key and you know and I and then I went and got a hammer. I just needed that chocolate. And that chocolate can be whatever. I don't know what it is for you. Maybe it's actual chocolate. Maybe it's I DON'T KNOW, RIGHT? WE HAVE all kinds of things and WE'VE STRUGGLED AND WE TAKE INSTAGRAM breaks and you know, I think he just did. No, I'm not talking about you, you know, but just, you know, like like and we you know, it's like we put things UNDER LOCK AND KEY, YOU KNOW, WE SMASH OUR PHONE and all you did was made a thousand dollar mistake. You know, we had we had one brother that we used to laugh about. You know what we need to do is we need to have our DVD rental service. And this was back in the days of DVDs, you know, is because the brother, you know, he would he would repent and come back to God. He'd throw away all of his DVDs. AND THEN SIX MONTHS LATER, you know, it's like, well, that would I mean, and he'd go he'd GO AND HE'D BUY ALL THE same DVDs all over again. I thought, I can monetize this. Like, bro, is just like, hey, I'll just CHARGE YOU HALF PRICE EACH TIME. AND THEN, you know, this, you know, if you're going to do this anyway, I might as well profit. Somehow that didn't seem right, so we never did that. But, you know, what's the answer, Brother Trevor? How do we get over these addictions? How do we get over these things that pull us? We're trying to die daily. We want to have this righteousness. We want to find ourselves less less and less and less and less and and not not struggling any man. So what the answer is is to law better. Of course you know you know how to law better. You know IT'S LIKE THIS TIME Lord I'm never going to do it again. This this No, but this time I am serious. This time I'm going to read my Bible every morning. I'm going to pray more. I'm going to do all the right things. I'm really I'm just gonna dig in. And this this time, not like those five or 10 or 30 other times where I said exactly THE SAME THINGS, BUT THIS TIME I'M really going to do it better because I'm Oh, I'm mad at myself. And I am I mean, what else am I going to do? I've got to do something. I can't just I can't just give up. But it's never worked. &gt;&gt; Why has it never worked? Anyway, let's read a little bit more of Romans 7. We'll go back to to verse one. And Paul says, "Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the law, how the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. But if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then, if while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she should be called an adulteress. But if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. And isn't this an interesting passage on the wait, what are we? This is just suddenly we got marriage and divorce and it's it's really nice of Paul to just stop for just he's like grace and then there's this part that we just read but just sandwiched in here there's a little marriage and it's like oh yeah I forgot to tell you like hey if a woman is married she's bound you know and she can't be married and you know but if he dies she can be married to another one and okay just wanted you all to know that because in 2026 you know they're going to take these verses and some of the things that Jesus said and they're going to take the message marriage and divorce and they're going to put them in a folder and when they need to talk about marriage divorce issues. They've got everything here so we can reference it. And so that's what we do now with these verses. And it has nothing to do with the continuity of what Paul is talking about through Romans or wait that seems awkward now that I just said it doesn't seem like maybe that's right. But this is how we treat these scriptures. We think of them as marriage and divorce scriptures and we catalog them in marriage and divorce. But if we take the continuity of what Paul is talking about and going through grace, what is he talking about? Wherefore, my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law. So Paul has set up the marriage and divorce law that everyone is familiar with and now applying it spiritually. Wherefore, my brethren, you're also become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from the law. That being dead where we were held, we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. The answer is not to law better because BECAUSE THE LAW THE FRUIT of the law brought forth death. It never brought forth any life. When we were married to the law, the only THING IT COULD DO IS BRING FORTH DEATH. BUT JESUS PUT THAT TO DEATH BY THE CROSS AND WAS RAISED IN NEWNESS OF LIFE. AND NOW WE HAVE A NEW HUSBAND. NO LONGER BOUND TO THAT HUSBAND AND HAVE NOW COME AND ARE REM ARE NOW MARRIED TO JESUS CHRIST WHO IS RISEN IN his grace &gt;&gt; AND IN THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW MAN. AND SO OFTEN NOW LET'S REPLAY WITH THIS IDEA HERE. NOW LET'S REPLAY THE IDEA. GOD, I KNOW I HATE THIS THING. I shouldn't do this. And I'm GOING DOWN AVENUES AND BREAKING MY BOX TO GET TO MY CHOCOLATE EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I SHOULDN'T. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And I FIND MYSELF AND I WAKE UP AND I COME BACK TO MYSELF AND I GO, "WHAT AM I DOING? I FEEL SUCH LIKE SUCH A LOSER. I SHOULD I SHOULD I'M GOING TO GO REPENT AGAIN. I'm going to, YOU KNOW, DO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD DO, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DO. That's that's what the law tells us to do." Of course, you know, if you've sinned, you come and repent. And so, what do we do? We come, we we maybe we wait for a service or that's really, really good. AND WE COME TO THE ALTAR and we pray. AND I'VE JUST GOT ONE question for you. With the things that you were dealing with in your life, how long do you need to be at the altar to really get forgiveness? What's that? Not that long. You haven't been really struggling lately, have you? Yeah. So, Matthew, it's Matthew, right? Matthew, the things that you've been dealing with. How long do you need to be at the altar? You know, couldn't be long enough, right? Can you do you want to maybe tally some things up that you know you're struggling with? You know, you've got a nice piece of paper here. Nobody has to see the camera's not just don't camera on the you know, you could just tally the things and then maybe just write beside it how many minutes you feel like you should pray at the altar for. Anybody ever do that? How long is long enough? Brother Matthew says, I I mean, actually, I don't think if we're going to tally minutes, I don't think there's enough minutes. &gt;&gt; We'll pray for him. What's I mean, but what's the what's the what's the answer? HOW LONG SHOULD WE BE AT the altar? You know, like I mean, it's like, well, this was a really bad one. And and for God to know that I was really sincere about repenting, that's a 30 minute deal. if I don't do 30 minutes, like I I mean, I don't know how God would know. I don't even know if I'm sincere at 30 minutes. So, I don't know how God would know because God doesn't know everything, you know? Wait, that wasn't true. But I think that in the moment, and I struggle with these things and now, and all you're DOING IS GOING BACK TO YOUR FIRST HUSBAND. ALL YOU'RE DOING IS GOING BACK TO SOME AND HONESTLY, IT'S NOT EVEN it's like that's not even first husband. That's like some kind of tradition that you've baked up in your mind about how long you're supposed to be at the altar to actually have adequate repentance for whatever stupid thing it is you just did. &gt;&gt; You say, "But brother Trevor, like what are you saying? Like are are you saying that if you fall into something you can pick you can recognize that you you you just you you are you saying brother Trevor when you you walked down that avenue that you knew you shouldn't have walked down and that you came to yourself and you thought I am such a loser that you could look up and say thank you Lord Jesus for your grace I know by what you have already done I am forgiven and you feel like you could be forgiven in that moment &gt;&gt; is That would is are you are you are you for real, brother Trevor? Are you really really because that just doesn't seem right. That doesn't seem LIKE LIKE THE PRICE HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR YOU LIKE THAT THAT ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THAT YOU WOULD ACCEPT THAT THAT OLD HUSBAND IS DEAD. AND WE TRY TO BE MARRIED TO BOTH AND IT DOESN'T WORK. AND WE FIND OURSELVES PULLED BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH AND NEVER REALLY BRINGING ANY FOR ANY FRUITS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS. BUT SITTING THERE TORN BETWEEN BOTH HUSBANDS, NEVER REALLY ACCEPTING THAT THIS OLD HUSBAND HAS BEEN PUT TO DEATH AND THAT WE CAN NOW SERVE HIM IN THE NEWNESS OF SPIRIT. AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN THAT PATH TO SIT THERE AND BEAT YOURSELF UP FOR TWO WEEKS, PUT YOURSELF IN THE DOGHOUSE, SPEAK BAD AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR, &gt;&gt; and repent for whatever amount of time you think is legitimate. ALL YOU'VE DONE IS WASTED TIME TRYING TO DO YOUR OWN WORKS OF ATONEMENT WHEN HE HAS ALREADY ATONED FOR IT FULLY. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND ALL IT TAKES IS TO REC RECOGNIZE GOD, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HERE I AM BEING JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL AGAIN. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. RIGHT. SO, brother Trevor, are you saying like what you're saying here? It just seems it seems to me what you're saying is is that it's not true that I'm a special kind of loser of a sinner &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I WAS, YOU KNOW, THAT I WAS A WORSE SINNER THAN MOST EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS CHURCH. WELL, EXCEPTING SO- AND SO. BUT I MEAN, let's all be real. But seriously, WOULDN'T THE DEVIL DOESN'T THE DEVIL WANT TO DO THAT TO YOU? ISN'T THAT WHERE YOUR MIND so often goes? No one has my problems. NO ONE'S AS MUCH OF A THEY'RE ALL BETTER than I am. I AM A SPECIAL KIND OF LOSER. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I'VE BEEN SAYING JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL. BECAUSE NOW IF THAT GETS IF THAT GETS EMBEDDED INTO YOUR MIND WHEN THE DEVIL COMES TO SAY you you're such a loser of a SINNER YOU CAN SAY YEAH ME AND PAUL &gt;&gt; WHO I REMIND YOU DEVIL WAS ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS THAT THE ONE OF THE SEVEN STARS IN THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD. IF YOU WANT TO COMPARE ME TO THE APOSTLE PAUL GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; I'M GOOD WITH THAT COMPARISON DEVIL. GO AHEAD. KEEP COMPARING ME to him &gt;&gt; because IF I'M A SPECIAL KIND OF SINNER MERELY BECAUSE I DID SOMETHING THAT I KNOW BETTER AND THAT I ABSOLUTELY HATE IN MY LIFE BUT I STILL DID IT THAT JUST MEANS I'M LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL &gt;&gt; AND GOOD GOOD TRY DEVIL TRYING TO GET ME TO BEAT MYSELF UP AND ATONE FOR MY OWN SINS WHEN I KNOW SOMEONE HAS ALREADY DONE IT SOMEONE HAS BEEN BEATEN SOMEONE HAS BEEN BRUISED SOMEONE'S BEARD BEARD WAS PLUCKED OUT. SOMEONE HAD SPIT IN HIS FACE. &gt;&gt; SOMEONE HAD STRIPES AND BREATHED HIS LAST BREATH SAYING IT IS FINISHED. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO, DEVIL, JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL, WHEN I COME TO MYSELF, I SAY, "OH, WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM, BUT RIGHT AFTER THAT, I WILL RECOGNIZE &gt;&gt; THAT JESUS IN THE FORM OF FLESH, for sinful flesh, &gt;&gt; put sin to death &gt;&gt; in the flesh, &gt;&gt; which is Romans 8:3. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And recognize devil, you would like to attach me to my first husband, but that first husband died at Calvary. &gt;&gt; And so now, devil, I am not going to waste my time &gt;&gt; with any kind of self-penance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I, you know, I've I've preached a number of youth camps now in my life. I've had enough I mean I can't how many hundreds of youth have come forward in prayer lines prayer line after prayer line and you begin to deal with them and it's like hey man like brother Trevor I'm a dirty rotten sitter stinks to be you I mean not like me did you know I have a website messagene.com which means I I don't have problems like you have. &gt;&gt; NO, ME AND PAUL AND YOU. We're all together in this. &gt;&gt; But if we spend our if all we're DOING IS GOING TO SPEND OUR TIME BEATING OURSELVES UP AND NOT HAVING FAITH, WE'LL never get to the first base. WE'LL NEVER GET STARTED. I I I I've gone to young people I you know just literally like like I mean we're like we're like man it's like 11 p.m. Service ended TWO HOURS AGO. THIS YOUNG man is beating. I MEAN LITERALLY GOD. OH GOD. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; What a sincere guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What? Two more hours, bro. Two more hours. Keep it up. We'll be in the back. &gt;&gt; Brother Trevor, you should go lay hands on that brother and pray for Yeah, that was an hour ago. Is it works that he needs to do? &gt;&gt; Went to the young man. I said, "Brother, can I talk to you for a moment?" So, I think you've been here before. I think you've done all this before. I think this is the not not the first time you've been crying at an altar, beating literally beating the altar with your hand, crying out to God at what a wretch you are. This isn't the first time you've done that, is it? No, brother. No. And it's probably over the same thing in your life. Yeah, brother. Yeah. You know what? You're going to need to believe God. You're going to need to believe that he can forgive you. You're going to need to believe that he already did forgive you. You're going to need to be able to send. And I, you know, I I'm not I you know, I'm not just saying, "Hey, forget it. Stand up. Accept it. Go your way." Because, man, it's late. Sorry, that was too real. Oh, that's not what I'm talking about. But I'm talking about what you're doing right now is futile &gt;&gt; and it will never change anything unless you couple that with faith in the word of God &gt;&gt; to recognize that he has died for you. And until you can accept that in faith, all your beating on the altar is not doing it's we're wasting your time. Frankly, you're wasting my time. And there's pizza in the fellowship hall. Let's go. &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding, you know. I'll stay late if we need to stay late. But man, like let's make it let's make it worthwhile. &gt;&gt; And faith to believe what God has already done is what this is about. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you'll never you'll never you'll you well you'll never go you'll never get started on your path to righteousness without faith. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans chapter 5 quickly. Just a few more scriptures before we finish up here. My timer says I'm done. But Romans chapter 4, WHAT SHALL WE SAY then that Abraham our father as pertaining to his flesh has found? For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for &gt;&gt; righteousness. Brother Trevor, I want to be righteous. I don't want to go down these things. Well, you know what? Abraham was righteous. Why? Because of faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Righteousness begins in faith. And if you never start with faith, you can never start your journey to righteousness. You can ne IT DOES ALL OF THE ALL I DON'T CARE how many guard RAILS YOU PUT UP. I don't care HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT STAYING away from chocolate. YOU COULD LOCK THE CHOCOLATE UP AS AS HARD AS POSSIBLE, BUT UNTIL you have faith, all you're sitting all you're doing is you just want chocolate that's locked up. &gt;&gt; All right. And you're no more RIGHTEOUS THAN YOU EVER WERE until you have faith that God forgave you in the first place. &gt;&gt; So Abraham ver continuing on in verse 18 says it says WHO AGAINST HOPE. OH brother Trevor it seems hopeless. I am so hopelessly addicted to this chocolate. I have fallen to chocolate a h 100,000 times. There is no hope for me. Abraham who against hope &gt;&gt; believed in hope. &gt;&gt; I read this scripture a few months ago. The sister caught hold of it. She hasn't been able to have a child and it seemed like it was hopeless for her. She's, I don't know, a few months pregnant today &gt;&gt; because she recognized that she could believe in hope even though it seemed hopeless &gt;&gt; that he might become the father of many nations. Hallelujah. According to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead. when he was about a hundred years old, neither the deadness of Sarah's womb, he staggered not at promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was also able to perform. And therefore, it was imputed to him for righteousness. Brother, it's Trevor, I want to be righteous. You're going to need against hope, believe in hope. You think you're GOING TO GET PULLED DOWN THIS WAY AND PULLED DOWN THIS way and you've been addicted and it seems hopeless that you'll ever get away from this cycle of fall and rise and fall and rise &gt;&gt; just like the Apostle Paul &gt;&gt; but against hope seems hopeless but believe in hope &gt;&gt; believe that God is able to perform it and let me tell you what Abraham at every brother Trevor like but brother Trevor you just don't realize like my I'm Just my flesh is my flesh is I mean my flesh is unbelievably strong in its desires as compared to anyone else in this church. My flesh is strong. You don't understand. Abraham could say, "My goodness, I'm wrinkled. I'm old. I walk around with a cane. I'm a hundred years old. My wife is 90. She's hunched over. Her hand is hands are wrinkled. She's not having a baby. As according to our flesh, this is impossible. &gt;&gt; And don't we feel like that some days? God, according to my flesh, to get over this problem that I struggle with in my life, it's impossible. I mean, you might as well just say I'm a hundred and I'm I mean, I feel like, you know, I mean, my knees hurt from all the times I've been kneeling at the altar. I've got hundredy old knees because I've repented so many times. Like, it just seems so awful. Did it matter to Abraham? No. Why? Because of faith. And that faith was counted to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; So, I guess it depends on what do you mean by righteousness? Does righteousness mean I've stopped sinning? Or does righteousness mean? I believe that God is able to perform &gt;&gt; in my life. &gt;&gt; What he's promised, HE CAN PERFORM NO MATTER THE WEAKNESS of the flesh. &gt;&gt; So go ahead and turn to Romans chapter 8 and let's read the first few verses there. I don't have them on the slide. which says, "There's therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death." Why? This is a call back to Romans 7:es 1 through3. I'M FREE FROM IT. WHY? BECAUSE HE PUT IT TO DEATH. I'M married to the spirit now. For what THE LAW COULD NOT DO in that it was weak through the flesh. GOD SENDING HIS OWN SON in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh &gt;&gt; but after the spirit. Brother Trevor, you didn't give us seven steps to be better. You didn't actually tell us how we can stop doing these things. You actually seem like you don't even It doesn't even seem like you care how bad at this thing I am. You're right. I don't. And when you can get to a spot to where you recognize the grace of God is so complete is so amazing. &gt;&gt; Brother, BROTHER TREVOR, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO IN IT. &gt;&gt; The the lamb of God has taken away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; Let let's start there. LET'S BEGIN TO BELIEVE the word of GOD AND SAY, "GOD, I I FEEL LIKE SUCH A FAILURE. I I I JUST BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. IT'S ABOUT TRUTH. WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU. CAN you believe that tonight? CAN YOU ACCEPT THAT FOR YOURSELF? NOT NOT JUST FOR OTHERS. THAT'S GOOD for those people because they, you know, they're not the SPECIAL KIND OF BAD I AM. NO, IT'S FOR ME. IT'S FOR you as an individual TO RECOGNIZE THE GRACE OF GOD IS ALL COMPLETE FOR YOU. AND WHEN I PUT MY FAITH IN WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE, GOD DECLARES ME AS RIGHTEOUS. AND IF I AM RIGHTEOUS BECAUSE OF THAT, THE CHOCOLATE DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE. AND NOW I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT. NOW MY EYES ARE FOCUSED ON CHRIST. NOW, NOW THERE'S STRENGTH COMING INTO ME BECAUSE ALL THIS WAS DOING WAS CAUSING WORRY. AND THERE WAS NO FRUIT CUZ I WAS MARRIED TO THE LAW, BUT NOW I'M MARRIED TO THE SPIRIT. AND THERE'S FRUIT AFTER FRUIT. AND THERE'S GROWTH UPON GROWTH UPON GROWTH. THERE'S LINE UPON LINE, PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT. AND AS I'M GROWING, THESE THINGS ARE FALLING AWAY. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE AGAINST HOPE, I BELIEVED IN HOPE. AND HE COUNTED MY FAITH AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; AND I WASN'T WORRIED about it anymore. &gt;&gt; I didn't spend two weeks talking bad about myself in the mirror, making my knees hurt at the Look, I'm not against coming to like, if you feel the need to come to the altar and repent, you come to the altar and repent. Nothing against that. But if it's so that you can feel better about yourself, you you're wasting your time. &gt;&gt; But if it's coming and saying, "God, I just want to dwell in your presence so that I can just be reminded &gt;&gt; that you have already done it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he has he has t he has taken care of it. And all you're doing all you're all you're I'm in the mirror and I'm at the altar and I'm you know kicking myself and not going to church and not reading my Bible not praying because I feel like God doesn't want to talk to me cuz you know I was just mean to him and I let him down. Well yeah he you know are you getting stronger in your two weeks of penance before you can pray again? &gt;&gt; He's like brother Trevor but I really want to be righteous. Okay. By so by by not praying for two weeks, you like this is going to help you be righteous. &gt;&gt; Like you like forgive me for just a minute here. Like like he's like, "Okay, here's brother Trevor's quintessential sarcasm coming out." Like it's for a purpose. Like I want this to seem so ridiculous to us that we're never tempted to do this again. Your two weeks of PENANCE OF NOT PRAYING DOES IT CANNOT MAKE YOU MORE RIGHTEOUS. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; BUT FAITH IN WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY DONE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; And now we SPEND THE NEXT TWO WEEKS GOING, I'm a loser. But God, you &gt;&gt; you But God, you love me. &gt;&gt; And God, it seems, you know, it just seems weird, Lord, because I just said I was a loser, but you love me. So now what I'm saying is is God, you love losers. And I struggle with that. So must not be true. It must mean then that I'm actually not a loser. I'm actually a bloodbought &gt;&gt; spiritborn &gt;&gt; son or daughter of the living God which then by definition like I you are not you are you are among a class of the most elite winners who have ever elitely won anything ever because like it just you it's like you're a child of almighty God &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; it's like I'm pretty sure like there's a podium of, you know, one, two, and three, and you're like, "Yeah, yeah, you get away people like I just you can't handle my winningness." Like the all like Jesus Christ himself wants to spend the rest of eternity in flesh with me in my flesh. He wants to be around me every single day. Like you can't like winning can't be defined any deeper than that. So though in your flesh you may feel like a loser. faith, the eyes of faith sees and recognizes that because of what God has done and that I have that that he has placed the desire in me to call out to him and say, "God, I want what you have done for me. I I am I I am defined as righteous because you have declared it. I am defined as a winner because of my relation to you." &gt;&gt; It's what we spend and you musicians, you come before I talk anymore, but That's what we spent winter youth retreat this year talking about was recognizing our truly what our who our who we are because of our identity in Jesus Christ. And it starts with recognizing who he is. And then when you see your part in him, &gt;&gt; it's like wow. And this is part of that to recognize he desires you and did this grace all for you. And so it I guess you can just have to choose then in Romans 7 is beginning to transition us from law &gt;&gt; into spiritfilled life. &gt;&gt; And if you're living in the spirit then just I would just say keep believing him. It seems simple but if you're walking daily with him these things are going to fall away. &gt;&gt; Is there smart things? Is there wisdom? Is there things? Yes, there's practical things that you can do. You can put chocolate in your box and put it under lock and key. That's that's maybe helpful. Accountability partners, all the rest. Not saying anything against all that. Maybe all of that's a great idea. But if it hasn't started with faith first, &gt;&gt; it's not going to be righteousness when you get done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, Lord, we look to you now, Lord. There's other scriptures, maybe other quotes, Lord, about Lord about how it's our duty to repent. And but it's the guide that takes us the rest of the way. Oh, Father, you as the Holy Spirit are guiding us and leading us. And Lord, your prophet declared that it was it was you who would take us on. So, Father, we just want to yield and surrender to you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we want to be washed by your grace. We want to be we want to be taken away. We want to be captivated by your love and by your grace for us, Lord God, to recognize, Lord, that Lord, not to not to give us an excuse, not to not to Lord, give us any uh that that we would sin again and again. Father, it we hate it, Lord God. But Lord, you've already made the way. Oh, how we love you, Lord Jesus. Oh Lord, maybe Lord, let your spirit, Lord, come. Speak to our hearts, Lord Jesus, about the depth of your grace. How you want to live inside of us. How you want to make us righteous, Lord. How you want to walk with us every day. Lord, come and speak to our hearts. We love you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. I was made for more. Just a little song that says I was I was made for more. I know who I am. I know who you are. The cross of salvation was only a star. And now I am chosen. I'm free and forgiven. I have a future and it's worth living. You switch to my slides, brother. I've got the words.

I was born and raised back to life again. I was made for more. So why would I make a man in my shame? A fountain of grace is running my way. I know I am yours and I was made for more. Let's do that verse again. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; Why do we know who we are? Oh, I know who you are. The cross of salvation was only the start. Now I am chosen. I'm free and forgive. I have a future and it's worth living cuz I wasn't made to be tempted and great. I was called by name. I was born and raised. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. up again. &gt;&gt; I was made from home for so &gt;&gt; why would I make a bed in my shame when mountain of grace is running my way. I know I am yours and I was made for more. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was made for more. &gt;&gt; There's a fountain of grace. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like if you if you desire the grace of God, you can like it is it is the title wave of all title waves. If you desire it, it it it is coming for you and there is just there is I mean it's like stand there, you know, I used to have a boss that would tell me, you know, there's so much work coming at you. You know, it's like you've got the tsunami coming and you're holding a Dixie cup. And it's like like this is like, "Hey Lord, I want some grace. Go ahead, take your Dixie cup of what you think he's going to bring to you and just let that tsunami of grace come and just &gt;&gt; like just take you away because it will if you'll let if you'll let God do it, he is going to do it in your life." Like that you can just take it to the bank. He has promised it. So let it become manifest in your life. Get get out of the way of the WORD OF GOD. STOP looking at yourself in the mirror and all of these things. Like just stop tending the grave. There's a fountain of grace headed your way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um hallelujah. Just trying to think of this song in my head. I'm amazed that you love me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I'm amazed. I'm amazed that you love that you love me. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed how you came. &gt;&gt; Through your preious blood, I found porn. My sins, they're washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. No one knew how alone I was feeling. and the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Oh, I laugh and said my life was fine without you. &gt;&gt; I was covering up the secrets. I cried. But then one day someone told me of your mercy &gt;&gt; and the love you showed on a hill. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Aren't you thankful for that day you died and purchased my redemption? It's when you roast in power and set my spirit free. I'm amazed. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed, Lord. I'm amazed how you car through your presence. I found I found and my sins are washed away. They're all washed away. &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; Hey, they're washed away. Lord, it's true. There have been days, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, and I have failed you. Lord, you know the many times I've gone astray. &gt;&gt; All the things that I would do that I don't do. &gt;&gt; But I've learned that your love is stronger than my weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Is it just words and your ear? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every time I &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. No one else has ever cared for me like you are. No other friends could ever be as close to me. And I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. &gt;&gt; It's knowing you. &gt;&gt; You are everything I'll ever need. I'm amazed. Oh, worship him now. &gt;&gt; I'm so amazed. I'm amazed. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed how you care. Through your preious blood, I found porn. And my sins are washed and washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. And through your precious blood, I found I still know how much you really care for me. Through your preious blood, &gt;&gt; my sins are washed. They're all washed away. &gt;&gt; All my sins are washed away. &gt;&gt; All my sins, they are washed away. All washed away. &gt;&gt; All of my sins. &gt;&gt; My sins are washed away. All my sins there. I'll cleanse and wash all. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Isn't God so good? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. That was just &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So wonderful. &gt;&gt; Such wonderful real real instruction &gt;&gt; ministering to our hearts. It really exposes the the enemy. &gt;&gt; You know, we I was sitting there and I was thinking about sometimes when the terminology of of addictions is me is is mentioned, it can go clear to right out to so many other things. And yet, it's not limited. My mind went right back to where when God said when they came into the land, he said, "When you get into the land, &gt;&gt; I want you to tear down their posters." This is scripture. &gt;&gt; I want you to tear down their altars. I want you to remove all remnants of what's there. And when you think about that, that may seem kind of um how do I place that in my life? Mental fatigue or repentance fatigue. &gt;&gt; I got it right now. Repentance fatigue. Mental pentance. And you know what all those things are about? It's about us. It's about how we feel. It has nothing to do with Calvary. &gt;&gt; But yet &gt;&gt; religion has wanted to attach us to that because religion is what you can do. &gt;&gt; Salvation is what he did. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it just like this. He said, "You could lay on this altar." You know, Brother Bram wasn't against wasn't against altar calls, &gt;&gt; but Brother Bram said, "You could lay on this altar." He said, 'They could bring you every meal and you lay here for days. He said, 'But it will never do you any good &gt;&gt; unless you accept what he's already done. That's why when the Bible says that how beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings and that is our God reignth that what what what he has already done what you look at and say I need this done in my life he's already done it &gt;&gt; and there's nothing that we can do to achieve it but if we can look away to him &gt;&gt; I think that was that was so powerful bringing that in within Abraham because if if that's where The devil would like to get our focus is upon your failures, on your shortcomings, upon man, I messed up again or this or that. No matter where you're at in your walk with God, you'll never get stronger or overcome where you're at if you keep looking at your failures. &gt;&gt; You see him more than just one who is there to forgive you. He's there to put strength in you. &gt;&gt; And I'll just say it to you like this. You might as well go ahead and get ready to say that the things that once used to torment and used to bother, but God is giving you grace &gt;&gt; to rule over those things. &gt;&gt; I find it incredible how brother Brandham would take the message by faith. By faith, Moses and faith is the victory. And he would say it, he would phrase it in this way. He would say that now the things that once ruled you, you now rule them. &gt;&gt; And how that there are things in our life that somehow that we can be expecting God to just, well, God will just strip everything out. God's put you back in charge. And you're a son and daughter of God. And let me tell you, you're always in charge. But we have to look to our source of strength, &gt;&gt; and that's the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what that be that becomes greater than anything else. &gt;&gt; And let God prove himself in our lives. &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's a reality. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. And I know when brother Trevor was going into that uh I love that part about I liked all of it, but I love that part about So what does staying away from prayer for two weeks do for you? &gt;&gt; I mean, you see how the devil does that where you don't you don't even feel like you're worthy. Let me tell you, on your best day, you're not worthy. &gt;&gt; On your best day, you're not worthy. If you had 10 days in a row, you're still not worthy. He never said it. It's a throne of grace when you're worthy. You don't need a throne of grace when you're worthy. We have a throne of grace. We have access to God by the grace of Jesus Christ. And you know what? We've got a high priest. I'm I'm not preaching. And I'm just We've got a high priest that I'm going to tell you, he's not you're not looking at him through a curtain and he's standing on the other side of the curtain going, "Lord have mercy. Wow. You mean you were tempted in THAT WAY? WOW, that was bad." We're not talking about an earthly man-made priest. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a great high priest &gt;&gt; who was tempted in all manner such as we are. And I know others like to take that scripture, but without sin. He had to be to be our atonement. &gt;&gt; He had to be to be our atonement. But when the spirit of God has come, do you realize the prophet said, "You are more innocent than a baby." &gt;&gt; That's what the power of the new birth has done. &gt;&gt; You know, it would just be simple tonight just to say, "God, make it real what was being said tonight." Cuz I'm going to tell you, when this gets real in your heart, look out, devil. Look out, devil. Look out, devil. You can never ever go to battle with the enemy ever feeling as though that I am worthy enough. David, when he came to Goliath, he said, "You come at me with this accusation. You come at me with sword and spear, but I want to announce to you, I'm not coming at you in the name of David. a bear killer, a lion killer, but I'm coming at you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, we've got a name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said I'm not preaching. I'm just No, you can't have my coat. But I feel good. AND YOU KNOW WHY I FEEL GOOD? IT AIN'T just about me. I'm sitting right there as a pastor and also thinking about young people and to me when I'm sitting there and it might be areas that God's already brought me through, but I rejoice that THE PEOPLE OF GOD ARE BEING BROUGHT IN LIBERTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS ALL ABOUT. IT BRINGS US INTO LIBERTY OF A FINISHED WORK OF CALVARY. THAT'S WHY I rejoice because he is standing as the unveiled Christ, the mighty conqueror before us. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love him. &gt;&gt; I just love him. &gt;&gt; You know, you know what you're experiencing tonight? You're experiencing that eagle anointing lifting us up. &gt;&gt; It It's lifting us beyond man anointing and and man, and what what what I can do and this. And that had its time, but now it's eagle time. &gt;&gt; This is bride time. You see this is why even when it comes to certain things where a person could say yeah back in 1970 somebody told me this and this and this happened in my life that was 1970. &gt;&gt; God is still God. &gt;&gt; But sometimes the things that worked and when I say worked back there what it really was was a sincere heart. Are you hearing me? Cuz sometimes you can hear and a person say I tell you what you really got to GET DESPERATE. WELL IT'S TRUE. YOU DO got to get desperate. You really got to pound on the altar. It wasn't because you pounded on the altar. Hello, somebody. The reason what moved God was a sincerity of heart. And if the same God could take Peter and in the house of Cornelius while he yet preached the word, the Holy Ghost fell. Why? Why? They weren't even at the altar. God saw the sincerity of their heart. And that's the whole that's the whole what God is doing even in a service. That's why walking right out of this service right here out of this service what God has done in hearts &gt;&gt; to where you know what you don't have to be afraid &gt;&gt; because there's you got a big brother. There's one who's greater than no matter what sin and no matter what's taking place. And God knows God knows what you need and he's got it. He's got it. Just trust him. He's got the strength. What you need, what must I do? Do what he's told Abraham to do. Abraham, I'm El Shadi. Come on up to my bosom and just draw from me more of me into more of you. &gt;&gt; And you get more of God in on the inside, Brother Samuel. But I It ain't about whether you're worthy. Draw from him. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Isn't the Lord good? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, inside here. I I'm running all around inside here. And as I said, it ain't about it ain't about me. I am so so happy for the word of God &gt;&gt; coming. And I you can just sense it. You can just sense things breaking and holds and &gt;&gt; the devil's being put in arm bars and he's tapping out. I mean, because the spirit of God taking that word and just pinning him right in the corner. God has a there. This is a special unique gift. I'm not lifting up brother Trevor, but I'm grateful for the diversity of gifts. &gt;&gt; Aren't you? &gt;&gt; It it just goes to show you we need that diversity of gifts. &gt;&gt; I mean, there were some things that Brother Trevor said last night. And I'm not even going to go into it right now, but we were sitting in a living room and thought, "Dear Lord, I never even But God has the gifts the way they are." I'm so thankful. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful, man. We leave out here. We can leave out of here tonight fat and sassy. I mean, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Ain't that right, brother Matthew? Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Thank you, Lord. You know what God doing? breaking away traditions &gt;&gt; and it's freedom. Those traditions were human stressors that was created and God just breaking them away. You know why you need to enjoy, you're right, you need to enjoy the righteousness of Jesus Christ and let him take you. Let him take you where he needs to take you. Let him do like brother says the Holy Ghost. He'll take you to your healing. He'll take you and your life. What God brings you through, it's an overcoming in your life. Brother Samuel, will I ever be bothered again? You'll be bothered, but you rule over it. &gt;&gt; And you know how you rule over it? By the righteousness of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Don't you just love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say, "Lord, I love you. &gt;&gt; I just love you, Lord. Just so appreciate your mercy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So good. So good. You got a song? We're going to let you go. We're We're going to let you go. It's just good, isn't it? Oh, I know it.
