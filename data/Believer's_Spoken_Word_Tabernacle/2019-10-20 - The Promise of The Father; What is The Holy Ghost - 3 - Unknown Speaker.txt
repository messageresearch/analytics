amen you love him it's good to be a Christian this morning a man it's good to have Jesus on the inside amen amen hallelujah sometimes you know you just don't even think the word thank you just don't seem like a knife you feel like that I just I don't feel like thank you even as a is enough many times I said Lord forgive me I seem like I don't have words that I want to express to you but I so appreciate the the mercy of God he has truly given to us life and life more abundantly John chapter 14 verse 10 that's where I'd like to begin pick up this morning amen just so thankful to be here with you Lord willing you know that this coming Thursday will leave for the Philippines but the Giri and myself and then we return I think it's that first Monday night leaving back out of there in November I think it's November 2nd or 3rd I know I got to be back here before that wedding so I think over there I think over here I'll leave out on a Sunday night it helps me because I don't like to be going along if I could I just do three days and leave and come back I love the people but I'm a homebody I like being here and and it's you know I want to be here I feel like I've said to my wife and said to others I said I don't feel like I've got enough services to preach everything that I feel that that is necessary and but God knows God knows that some of you get nervous I'm not going to create more services but I that's really how I feel and it's not it's not necessarily more preaching but remember what the Word of God does it makes us aware the Holy Spirit comes down and makes us aware of what that he has already given to us makes it and he's makes it real to us so Lord willing we're over there and I really really covered your prayers we the heart of the of the truth we've got is is there youth retreat so I have about four I have about four sessions I'll be doing the morning teaching sessions on some things that pertain to the young people at that time and then we have the convention right after that and then we'll be stepping back on a plane and coming back home I might be able to fly without the plane they put a picture of my wife in front of me and and my children and and of course you all are always before me I get sad thinking about leaving and that's really how that's really how it is from my heart so brother Alexander McGillis will be here this coming Thursday and Sunday and then the following week brother Dale Smith from Buford South Carolina he will be here on Thursday and Sunday as well so brother Dale it's been a few years since brother Dale's been here but I I know you'll get a real blessing out of it so and I'll tell you what I've just been enjoying the Ministry of the word I really have been I come back from you know North Carolina and I enjoy just set here in feeding it's it's a lot of times I it's kind of rare that I get that but I love to be able to do that and I'll tell you what God has certainly been speaking to us there is no break in the economy of God there is a continuity of the Holy Spirit among every one of us amen I just think of it I was talking with the when I was in North Carolina was talking with brother Brian Naidu from South Africa and we were speaking and some of the things we were speaking about and and I just had told him I said these are some things I said I was debating on speaking in this meeting and and and and he said oh my goodness he said I just had spoke on those things you see it don't matter where we're at it's the same Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost so amen well let's get on the word I could talk to you all day John 14 10 believe us Val not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works now I want you to look at this now the words that I speak unto you I speak not of my self but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake very verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now he recognized what greater greater would mean not more in quality but more in quantity and to remember that the greater works that would be done it's even it's it's beyond just laying hands on the sick and then being healed that is a part of it but it is dealing with his life coming in to the Church of the Living God his redeemed body and then that same life moving through and the imparting of that same life it's about his life the continuation of his life because remember if the sicker healed and everything else and there's no continuation of his life then Jesus does not claim that church there there must be a continuation of that life amen amen we see that all the way through the gospel so here in verse 13 and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son he shall ask anything in my name I will do it verse 15 if you love me keep my Commandments I'll tell you that's a real key right there many times this the lack of that verse right there is what keeps people from receiving the Holy Ghost so realize you fall in love with you and whatever he says to you do it is that right if you love me keep my Commandments and I verse 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not I love this verse I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also out that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you amen god bless you amen bless the reading his words your being seated I want to continue to deal we've been looking at the promise of the Father and what is the Holy Ghost and not that I would think for a moment that we are ignorant of that but I realize that we have new ones young ones but I believe that it's for all of us and I believe that the preaching of the word of God if we if we miss this you miss everything if you know all of the teachings and doctrines and know all the word and yet you missed the life you miss everything because all of the teaching and all of the life in everything was to point us into a place that this same life would dwell within you and I as sons and daughters of God so this is the very this is the very heart of the gospel is that this life would manifest the rain and the victory of the Lord Jesus Christ through our lives and when we we recognize as he says here in verse 16 this word comforter and we'll read it in not multiple places here in the scripture this morning and when we we look at it he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever now then when we look at this he said I will pray I will make the request because he is the true atonement where God has become one of us it was God in Christ as Paul said reconciling the world unto himself not imputing our trespasses to think about it God coming down and creating a body and stepping into it not because we were worthy but he himself alone is the only one that can redeem us there was there's no other creator but Almighty God Satan's are perverted but is not a creator but God created a blood cell that he could come down and pay the price and then through that offering would be able to transmit this life back into you and I as as believers and I want should not not to dwell upon this this morning but we recognized that the Holy Ghost is not something that doesn't belong to us but the Holy Ghost belongs to sons and daughters of God it is alive that was promised to us so that in the receiving of the Holy Ghost it is God actually receiving you and I back into himself he makes complete provision that you and I can come back and dwell within him it's all His redemptive work he ascended to to the throne of God where he is our perpetuation for our sin he made me think of this God made me pay for my sin in him Isaiah 53 is very clear this is the report of Almighty God in that who hath believed our reports he made me pay for my sin in him the ransom has already been paid now the request is made the scripture we read now that request is made by the body of the Lord Jesus Christ ascending on high and remember here he comes up from the grave and remember he told Mary he said don't touch me for I have not yet ascended he ascended up and to think how quickly this was done he ascended up was presented the one who is accepted and remember there other Old Testament Saints that had been waiting on the promise of the Messiah to come remember the the Bible says he led captivity captive and here they are walking up the earth for about a period of 30 to 40 days the Bible says in the book of Acts chapter 1 that he met with his disciples for 40 days they were scattered but he gathered them together and when he brought them then together remember he led them out there to the Mount all of it and as he led them out the Bible said he ascended up before them and as he ascended up as they're standing there looking and you know gazing think of it the angel said at that time why stand you here gazing I believe was on my heart it was an announcement you're looking at here the glowing away but there is a promise that he said if I go away I'm coming back and he was just talking about the second corporal coming but he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you can't you see how the angels of God even present about our life when the angels of God the true angels of God encourage us in the promises that are for us amen they encourage us to take the real presence of God believers one of another it is the encouragement in the promises of God to wear that Paul would say we are to exhort one another we are to comfort one another I'm telling you that is what that comfort and that exhortation is because of his life within us that makes that word real so it is no longer just our words when we speak exhortation when we comfort one another it is Christ in us encouraging one another Paul called him like this in the opening of Corinthians the God of all comfort now the requests the body has entered in now to set upon the right hand of God on the throne of God now here he is seated there the body of Jesus Christ entered back in with the resurrected Saints I wish I could preach on that for a little bit but as they ascended up remember David said he will open unto me the gates of salvation when they ascended out remember a gate is a place of transaction and when they ascended up remembered there was a cry from the inside that said who is this king of gold and when they asked the call from inside the city there were saints that were there at that moment that were able to answer definitively it is the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord mighty in battle and when they spoke of the transaction that took place on Calvary they felt the effect of that transaction when that life itself went down to hell but hell could not contain it health of not wholly a member plane could not hold it there it rose in triumph on that Easter morning and it brought with them the Saints that had been waiting and had been looking for that promise and as they Rosa they had a testimony brother they had a witness they had a proclamation hey you got the same kind of proclamation who is this King of glory who is this triumphant one who is this word of God that you speak up who is this Emmanuel who is this victorious one you can say it is the Lord Jesus Christ in me Christ his name Laurie he entered back in to glory and he sent back the Holy Ghost a man is the comforter the Spirit of Truth verse 17 said for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you it's a very key the Word was made flesh but now the word must be made flesh in them see the word was dwelling with him but the purpose is that the word might come to dwell in them when God sends his word his message to every generation it's God visiting that generation remember the seven stars are in the right hand right hand of Almighty God here as it says in Revelations 1 and it speaks of the peace and everything that comes from the true atonement there must come that life that that that the believers are called to in that age that same life must come to a place of reproducing the life of the Lord Jesus Christ to actually bring forth the life the world that's ministry you realize that the Ministry of the word that you're under here in this church if you go out there and live any different way your approach your life must be an example of what's preached here so if you go out there and you run around and you live in your way and you and you do all sorts of things you are not a you are misrepresenting good truth of Jesus Christ that is preached here and I don't know how to polish it up but your hypocrite but you don't have to be a hypocrite you don't have to be a hypocrite you can live with that light on the inside of you is that right it should be a reflection of the light of the word that is ministered and the notice you know when we look at this what the holy ghost is it is the Spirit of Christ within us it's a sign we talked about that the sign of circumcision a seal a covenant it is the same spirit of God in the Church of the Living God think of it you know when Jesus would say here he is standing here and he would say I always do that which is pleasing to my father hallelujah this must this is to be the desire of every believer now in reality there's not one of us in here that can say I always do that which is pleasing listen to me now but from the soul when that soul has been changed and filled with God's presence you know what I'm talking about the Bible said whosoever is part of God that's not commit practice sin he is delivered there is there is nothing holding over his head why because the seed of God remaineth in him I always do that which is pleasing to my father oh my I come not to do my own will but but the father that sent me and he that sent me said Jesus he is with me and as the father has sent me so send I you the father that sent him came in here and worked through him he meant the same Jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you and if that spirit think of this if that spirit living in Jesus Christ made him do and act the way he did you have some general idea how it will do when it's in you because that life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change its nature for its God he meant notice Jesus says in verse 25 of the same chapter these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you Jesus said my peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid you have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you if you love me look at this statement you would rejoice because I said I going to the Father for my father is greater than I now I think it's safe to say that the disciples they didn't have a clue of what was going on and what was getting ready to happen do you mean that they would be even regarded as true disciples even if they didn't understand everything discipleship is not based upon understanding it's based upon faith and faith will tell where our senses cannot be clearly there are things that you cannot explain I wish I could preach a little bit this morning on another subject but I'm not even want to go there but you recognize sometimes how God will deal with things and it's the very hidden wisdom of Almighty God how God could move in such a way and God would use men who are full of mistakes and failures and faults and God would say I'm gonna put their writing in the scripture because it wasn't them as men it was the Spirit of God but it takes the discernment of the Holy Ghost to recognize that hidden wisdom the rest of the world says they're men they made mistakes this one did this and this one did that and this one did that but the believer said but I see card I see God same in you and me I wish I could preach that this morning hallelu I go away and come again unto you glory be to God you know that was very much of how it was in the visitation of Abraham and Sarah in verse 8 in chapter 18 God come down and God used to form a flesh are you with me he used the form of flesh to his speak the promise to Abraham and Sarah and that word spoken was sent to dissolve the very doubts in Sarah's heart the promise was believed or the brand would say like this one place the promised those slightly doubted it was believed but you see the power like brother Timothy was preaching on Thursday the power of God's Word of God to bring his word to pass sovereign grace will override the doubt it will cast it out it will dismantle it brother it's not up to you and I to try to dismantle it the word has within it the necessary power to cast out all unbelief and he moved from Genesis 18 to Genesis 21 you see that must be the transition within every life in every age in the age we're living in not just rallying back here in Genesis 18 hope God use the messenger God use the messenger that's to miss it you must recognize God use that vessel it was a word to this generation that was needed in this out the promises of God that have been placed above this generation Jesus Christ has been pleased upon this generation sir the ministry in this in time but the Bible says the Lord visited Sara he was not a fleshly coming but it was the same Lord who spoke the promise and that same Lord visited and performed the word in Sara's life yeah man the word must become material you agree with me it's not good enough just to have it hear the word was made to become fresh I can't remember this or I can't quote that that's not what it's about he brings that to you as you have need of it the scripture is necessary for instruction in righteousness of how that we ought to give ourselves unto God but remember the Word made flesh his word Christ Himself comes in and takes over your thinking he takes over your me and he lives his own life through you I know we know some of these things but I'm here to stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance sometimes it's our little things that we forget we forget who's in the ship storms arise we forget who's in the ship wake him up [Music] [Applause] if you love me you and rejoice because I said I going to the Father for my father is greater than I stronger this is what the word stronger than I because remember it wasn't the body the body was necessary to pay the redemptive price but Jesus and the father there are not two separate people it is created a body of tabernacle that he might come and dwell in and pay the price of redemption God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself Amen he told them in John 16 remember he kept saying a little while a little while a little while and you read in John 16 where they were troubled at the same and Jesus caught it that they were troubled with it a little while a little while what's he saying a little while and Jesus and let him know he takes the example that of a woman who is preparing to give birth as she comes into that place there's great sorrow there's great pain that comes in but Jesus let him know that he was in that you're gonna have mourning there's going to be sorrow but your sorrow is going to turn to joy you are going to rejoice again oh brother they couldn't think they didn't understand what he was saying listen to me not only did they not understand what he was saying but even when it took place they were all scattered they were walking around with gloom they were all down but remember he said you're gonna rejoice he knew that the present conditions not happening according how they thought should happen then he would bring blue sadness we thought it should have been him that woulda redeemed his rep but brother when he come on the scene after his resurrection brother and made himself known to them even those that said I don't know if I can believe it or not Jesus did not shy away from them they were elected to receive it the Bible says in the book of Acts they were witnesses chosen for him to make himself known to them and when he came to them it removed all doubt it didn't matter if they had to touch his hands come on now he broke fish and an open then the bread it opened their eyes is that right there was a rejoicing that he had raised but Jesus let him know hey listen up there's going to be a temporary rejoicing you remember I told you that I'm doing there's gonna be a joy that will come to you that no man will be able to take from you and that joy that he was talking about is the imparting of that life that through that birth that then the life would come the indwelling of the very jolly of Almighty God how many knows the Bible said the joy of the Lord is our strength even when you feel weak the joy of the Lord let the send the I don't feel happy acid joke the joy of what below not new stock points all of those things they're fine but nothing is real joy outside of the Lord people put themselves in debt looking for joy they'll go from things or things you think looking for joy there is no joke outside of Jesus Christ [Music] amen I've come that your joy might be full oh my they were comforted by the word being made manifest to him think of how Noah think about this comforter here just for a moment think of how Noah felt when the word here it was spoken to him remember the Bible tells us in in the book of Genesis nor was already a righteous man come on friends he was already a righteous man no was already praying God saw in no and it wasn't because all his works but no he saw something within Noah and how did God what did he see he saw one of his own attributes and God comes and speaks to Noah build an ark it's gonna rain now he didn't tell him to build an ark to go you know just so you have a nice boat to go out on the water with it didn't make sense that he build it on dry land boy this stuff leaching over on her it didn't make sense to build it on dry land if you're gonna build a boat building where the water is at but God likes hiding from the wise and prudent he gave her a little something to criticize go ahead and put this on your blog post come on somebody but God said it's my hidden wisdom what about that but when the rain fell there were no it was this this is that which was spoken not received a comfort when they think of it all of the critics that came to him in that day Noah's the revelation he received from God put him into action ho glory be to God amen it seemed it did not even seem right for him to cut down the the tree that he used it would have seemed like he should have used up tree but God said I can't use any wood that's not willing to surrender you see God in a hidden oh my god hiding himself in simplicity God takes a wood the tree and he drains the life out of that tree and then he takes this of another tree and takes the light from that tree and seals the wood from these trees it is Jesus Christ the comforter the Holy Ghost being made manifest right there when all the opposition arose against Noah he was comforted because he had received the word of the Lord only one that he didn't have problems he was not that he did not have shortcomings he was not that he didn't make any mistakes as a matter of fact I think of how the brand was dramatized and in conflict between God and Satan he said they got into harken Noah said boys it's gonna rain tomorrow no rain came boys it's gonna rain tomorrow ho I know it's coming he's right he knows it's coming because God called him into the ark and got shut the door he's known this has been God all the time hey come on now you and I never thought we'd be hearing this time he's coming he's coming he's coming he didn't come that day didn't come that day no Brad said one of the boys think about this one of the boys looked around to know it looked to Daddy has it all been a mistake no said no sir son God spoke to me here's the ark were set man come on somebody it comfort him when the Hebrew children had to stand there and remember they prayed they prayed they fasted and they waited on God they did not receive a word from God they were going to be thrown in the fiery furnace because of their stand that they would not bow to that image of Daniel they said Daniels a prophet of God but he is never to substitute Jesus Christ and I will not worship a man God uses problems but they never meant to be worshiped you see what it is it's the exaltation of an image oh my when the reality is is that the image of Christ is to be displayed in our lives it wouldn't matter if you never walked the streets of Jeffersonville at all you don't have to do none of that to be accepted in the beloved come on somebody amen we are not fanatics we are believers we know who we have believed in as partners to the Lord Jesus Christ the true automa the true perpetuation it's generated by the lies on the inside of us amen we will be taken enrapturing grace by the Lord Jesus Christ thank God for every part is that right I just say this plain as I know how to play it say it you take this message away this message is not books and tapes it's the inspiration of Jesus Christ that is poured out in this hour you take it'll answer well I'll just stay with the Bible without the inspiration of the author coming upon the word we are left to our own presumptions but when the inspiration is poured out whether there's there's waters that have been polluted waters that they held within them death but notice Elijah said bring me a new cruise bring me a cruise that has never been used before a cruise that is separated from traditions and idolatry and creeds and the nominations a bring me a cruise and put so in there brother he took that cruise and he put that salt in the water he said the Lord kill these waters and water symbolize people it was a comfort when the word came like that the Hebrew children walked to the fiery furnace they didn't know brother joy what was going to take place billy-ray they didn't know they were going to be delivered as far as how it came out well I feel like preaching a little bit they prayed they fasted they brought it up at prayer meeting Tuesday night prayer meeting come on now they set the prayer request prayer request after prayer request but the joy Bibles at a place that as soon as their name was written all I know what they're going to pray for you don't matter how many times we pray for it we are praying not because repetition makes it better we are praying because you promised God and we're standing as believers and believer said that God's Word can't fail just jump it fail I'm gonna keep standing here and pray and knocking and believing and expecting they were comforted and they got there in the midst of that fly that fire they walked in the midst they're amazing those who threw him in were consumed paradox after paradox their hands were bound they go into the fire their hands are then freed the king looks over and said did you not cast three men in the fire he said I see a fourth one lock into the Son of God wrote the Bible said when they came out of there their clothes did not smell like smoke [Applause] that's a mystery brother Milton I like Cracker Barrell but a lot of times I go to cracker but I like the fireplace but it's a mystery how they came out of there without smelling like smoke you go to crack the barrel come out smelling like smoke come on now they came out of there unpainted brother don't you see the power of standing on his word that word is comfort in our life the enemy can try to bring all sides of fear and say this will happen this will happen but listen the God who has permitted the test he does not leave you to your own devices he makes himself known in a greater more personal way is there witness of that every time on and on we could go with how the word that was spoken the spirit of Christ would bring comfort to them down through the ages here was in the days of the disciples here the Word was made flesh that was a comforter they can handle it shake hands with it talk with it it was a comfort to him but remember he said I'm going away but I'm gonna send the comforter back to you hey man here he was the Word was made flesh among them in John 16:7 it says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away they didn't want him to go away they tried to prevent his departure even Jesus himself he left them and even in that he loved their fellowship but he knew in order to bring this life within them he would have to go away he prayed three times let this cup pass from me aren't you glad that he took a cup I'm glad I'm glad I'm really glad it's expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come to you but if I depart I will send him unto you he knows your address he knows your address and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more true righteousness is the person of Jesus Christ in you the Pharisees were righteous people but now through the offering of the Lord Jesus Christ he comes to reprove their righteousness because it is a self-made righteousness nothing wrong with them trying to live up to the world but remember true righteousness is that of the righteous one on the inside a judgment because the prince of this world is judged in that wonderful because he has been judged then judgment can be measured in met at the house of God if the enemy has a life bound judgment can come and lift what's on that life lift the condemnation judgment can be addressed at the house of God it can be lifted off the believer and put back up on the devil this is what the comforter comes to do the comforter ain't some big squishy marshmallow I have to say that because our English language you know has softy Betty what the comforter is it's the person of Jesus Christ and the very presence of the Holy Ghost here instead of instead of the corporal body being here it proves that Jesus was righteous and he went to the Father he is as the Bible says the faithful and true witness in the midst of the church so this comforter will try to get to just a little place here there's no way we can get to it all but to a little place the comforter is here in the greek it's called the Parakletos which is also known as the advocate one's advocate that's mentioned in first John chapter 2 verse 1 and verse 2 it is summoned this comforter is one who is summoned to one side called to one's aid it pleads another's calls on behalf of their defense you and I could not plead our case guilty I said we were guilty hallelujah but there's an intercessor one who now exalted to the right hand of God he's there to plead for the pardoning of our sins and I want to understand plead it's not him begging please please no there has been a transaction that has made to receive that men the Holy Ghost is is that of which the Lord Jesus has prayed I will pray my father that he will send the comforter whether he went praying for something that wasn't the will of God or percent thing that was brand-new remember this prayer is only the utterance of a very mind of God and heart of God we were already in God's mind before there ever was a devil it was already saddled Bilal was slain in the mind of God and when that reality strikes our heart brother our security and our safety is in the Lord Jesus Christ and the comforter makes that finished work alive and real that you were always a part of me the comforter comes to make it real to us it's the love of God that were unable to be separated he's one that is summoned to the side of another to speak on our behalf where we are looking at we know we're guilty I want you to think of this now listen to me if I could just is it just coming to me now if I can somehow very very late this here we stand and we recognize when the preaching of the Cross the preaching of the gospel it brings conviction the Holy Ghost brings conviction to the sinner it brings conviction to our heart to draw us and bring us to the place to recognize there has been a propitiation that has already gone before us the Holy Ghost is the one that brings convictions they go what Peter preached on the day of Pentecost after Peter preached the death burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ that this is the fulfillment of the prophecy and that which you're seeing and hearing is the life of God that is being made manifest what did they do the Bible said their hearts were pricked and they said what shall we do to be saved you see the preaching there of the atonement it was making known to them the way that had been opened they already knew it but now he wasn't just reading about it but now here comes a man that is a witness of the true atonement rather he had some he read about it's what he has experienced they met he was one who was guilty as guilty could be here was a Peter think other think of this think of the irony of Almighty God that God would choose a man to be the spokesman his one who denied him when they asked him hey you talk like a Galilean hey do don't you know him and the Bible said he cursed he fled away but it's the very one that God chose to be a spokesman but brother something happened on the day of Pentecost they were already called the Bible says in John 15 they had been sanctified by the truth come on when they went up there to wait on the Holy Ghost they were already sanctified clean vessels but they needed to be put in service and they were already claiming now when the Holy Ghost descend Briella Peter did not walk out of there with a monkey on his back but he's still guilty he knew he had been cleared because the Holy Ghost is the comforter that announces to you the sin question you said how does it do that because the old man the old nature on the inside God Himself comes down and annihilates that old nature and that seed on the inside he raises up by his quickening power and he seals it that's why the Bible said you are a new creation in Christ Jesus I'm telling you there is power to lift condemnation over your life [Applause] Oh God when you have been gone again the change this guy looks the same I mean the matter you know the guy mentor who ever was I mean I had to they wiped off everything got there got themselves in order according to God's Word but the inside man is the man who's changed everybody else can look and say oh that's Samuel but see the inside man has been changed the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews chapter 10 the conscience that conscious that soul that has been purged there's no more desire for sin amen the inside man that's why we said me you know a weeks ago I remember when it was but there can be no that'll come to your address and you look at it and say wrong guy RTS return to see wrong guy that guy don't live here no more they met when he has come when the comforter has come he will do the same things Jesus said that I had done while the comforter is in me we read that in our opening text is that right it's him that doeth the works the father that dwelleth in me its life within us there is not a tree that can bear the fruit without the life being within it is that right he goes on to say if you can't believe me believe me for the very works sake it was according to the Word of God the Spirit of Truth is the comforter and he says to us in that end where we read the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these remember Jesus would say in John 5:19 that the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do whatsoever things he doeth these also doeth the son likewise see the realization these things that we have heard and know it becomes more real that it must be him when the Spirit of God instructed the prophets pick up your pen and write and he wrote of this verse of scripture because it's time now where the bride it has come to the completion we're not we're not in the I age it's moving out to the very intelligence has stepped into the body it is where God has taken over his body and for redemption are you with me if truly he's taking over his body his temple it has been growing growing throughout the ages as a holy habitation for God but now it is God how God is dwelling than us as he dwelt in every age and it was him that performed the word in every age through surrender vessels are you with me now it's the same God that is working inside of you and I it must be him performing the word in us there's nothing wrong we ought to have a longing and a desire to see more of God in our midst we ought to have a desire to see more of him in our lives Bertrand tells us in perfect faith he said oh we are longing for those apostolic times once again he also warned us further after all it will not be a big public show there's some things that we cannot explain and never will be able to explain of why this one is healed and this one's not but in irregardless we stand in the in the faith in the truth helmet to know that God is already healed us are you with me it must be the realization it is the father himself reveal see he must reveal himself then it's us believing us yielding that believing part is part of the yielding then it is the Spirit of Christ working in us and through us to perform his word my my mind let me just let me let me go on here he will bear witness notice in John 15 I'm trying to get here now John 15:26 Jesus picks it up again when the comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because we have been with me from the beginning the lie of Jesus Christ in the believer it is our comfort that there is one that has stood in our place is standing in our place and is in us with him being in us and us in him he is our advocate before the throne we do not stand then as guilty we stand as completely free we stand with his life in us we stand with the righteousness of God in our lives you with Minnelli but Sandow still make mistakes and then I'm not talking about you you understand when I talk about mistakes I'm not talking about willful sin and and an excuses for four four habits and everything that's not what I'm talking about at all you understand that so he gives us notice one of the points here and I'll just close on this coming down through here one of the points with the comforter it gives to us not only life but it gives to us power is that right it gives us life and power it the Holy Ghost does not come and give us and give us life and then we've got to go wait for power no the word has been restored to let us know that life and power come at the same time are you with me it gives us divine strength on the inside so it's not our power remember the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works Jesus when he was assembled with him in Acts chapter one verse four he told them you shall not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you that's a lot of contrary to how things have been talked in minutes in many churches around even you win when we look how the Prophet is on the scene where you already found the mixture of spirits coming in and they were teaching experience as evidence instead of it being based on the word are you with me and that is why the arguments could arise a person could have an experience but yet the life not match the word they can have an experience with in church and yet no power to live a godly life come on friends we're talking about its disses the hour where the prophecy of the word for the building up of Jerusalem a habitation remember he told to ruble get the plumb line out stop measuring up Jerusalem amen let's get it back to its original standard they don't want to lessen it what good is a Holy Ghost that comes down upon your friends but don't give you no power to live outside die understand their listen to me now thank God for the Holy Ghost dealing with hearts but I want you to understand when it deals with your heart he deals with your life that's him making himself known that I am a Living God and when you know your life needs to be changed open up the door of the one who's present doing the knocking don't just walk out and say oh praise God that was a wonderful service thanks Carl listen friends we thank God for all of that but that's got to come a power only inside a power that lives above sin that's what the comforter does the comforter the Spirit of Truth that causes you to stand on God's Word live guys sink or swim we don't gotta take back from nothing are you with me when I have to stand back from nothing we don't need we don't have a bunch of wishy-washy people stand down stand down let the devil take this course not since they men the Holy Ghost is here commend the abstract to the title deed the quickening power of caught has come to the Church of the Living God there is no excuse to live in sin you shall receive power this is for you after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me you know the Bible says and no man can call Jesus Lord but by the Holy Ghost he's the lord of that temple where you can say I once was but no longer it's a comfort on the inside no longer am I the same you are his victory is being declared through the life oh my look at this word power here for a moment 2nd Corinthians 13:4 for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God for we also are weak in him but we shall live with power by that we shall live with him by the power of God toward you how how you living by the power of God Paul how are you doing what you're doing by the power of God that dwelleth in me see that tower it's a liberating power it doesn't connect you to your past it ties you back into your destiny hey man it is the link that connects you amen Romans 1-3 concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according all of that according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead that's real holiness real holiness on the inside will generate holiness on the outside hey man this is the spirit of holiness raised him from the grave it set him apart there have been others that died and they're still in the grave come on Rob others that have lived and they're in the great but there is one who rose from the they put him in the grave remember he Rosa and he tramped over how did he rise up that body old girl repeated God that body was laying there lifeless motionless but brother there's a promise are you listening to me there was a promise in the world that destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again he stood on that water the amount of seven you know some backgrounds about David now don't you have you read some things we wrote about David not or no you know the whole thing might be a little shady Jesus knew I was the one who inspired David come on somebody i inspired David to say what he said and when the Spirit of God come upon the Apostles they look back and called David a prophet don't scratch your head just say thank you Lord I believe it cause you're never gonna figure it out hey man it's God hiding himself hey man think about this here he is laying lifeless and hopeless but the Spirit of God comes upon him and raises that body up brother that's the same way that it has come to you and I it is it is the Spirit of God that comes to raise you and I it gives you power brother to live and look to him as your justification but I have justified on the Lord by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ he gives you more power to live a sanctified clean line and he then puts his power on the inside of you more power it's Jesus living in a factory worker it's Jesus living in the businessman it's Jesus living in the biskits maker come on somebody hey man it's Jesus living his life through his church then I'll not be hard if you just surrender come on you look at the fashions and everything else and you look at a fashion magazine or whatever more you surrender you open your spirit to it your eyes is that I gave you let an image come in and then you go to searching for what kind of shoes they got in this and and that and this and that what is it it's an image that's coming in that takes over that you'll sacrifice all sorts of things to be done in order to get a certain look what is it it's an image that you're trying to become stop trying you get yourself in debt and not only that you don't want to match the spirit of this world that is a trap in this world to get people to where they're always looking there remember it's a false representation because it's God's desire to form his own image and his life inside of you now you are not made to look at that and take that image on you were made to reproduce the very image of Jesus Christ that's why you need to look away then when you get to looking at him you start letting the righteousness of God move into your life if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the ditch also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you I really am closing right now but it is a reality this is what the comfort is you seeing that in the midst of circumstances that could come about those who live before the Old Testament those here in the New Testament after the coming of the Holy Ghost they were not exempt from tests and trials as a matter of fact Jesus let him know in John 16 I believe 32 or 33 one of those scriptures there he let them know that in this world you're going to have much tribulation but in me you have peace every time you make a even you stand for God's word Satan is always there to assail you but don't fear the same God who has made his word known to your life and to your heart and it's called you to it and you surrendering to that the same God is present to back up that word and to give you the comfort that you need we are comforted by walking in his word you know how many times we've seen examples now I think I guess it was all along but you see it more now and I know the insanity is just incredible in this world that we're living in now but how many times you see people where they're been children and here they are now 13 15 years old some 17 they've been locked in a cellar all their life you're not told about this it's not like a once there is that news story no it's where new where are that news stories they're not just somewhere out in in California these types of things happen right around in here how many times I don't know maybe it's just because the you know it's more reported or more widely broadcast I don't know but one thing that I look at is you find many times that those individuals come out they don't know how to walk they don't know how to talk there's certain things and you seem so malnourished it wouldn't matter if they put their push their meals under the door part of nourishment and growth is that direct communication part of nourishment and growth is being in the light you know how it is we're coming up here in Northeast Ohio we're coming up into a time where even where the darkness and as it keeps on getting darker pretty soon you're be pouring your milk on your cereal and it'll be dark then you'll be sitting down with your bologna sandwich at dinner and it's dark right not at one of they tell us in those times get out a little bit in the sunlight and get at least a little bit of light and I think what they say take vitamin D or something I don't know you know is that right vitamin D they tell us that why because we need sunlight we need light and sunlight itself I never forget when when when Benjamin when Ben was born there was a condition in his body that was not fully developed and then he had that little bit of a yellow jaundice it was that and there was another little condition that was within there you went to the doctor for the joy you know what the doctor told us and said you got to you have something you can lay him in we said well we got a bassinet you know that you know that you have plenty of windows we said yeah and so we had there in the trailer we had that with that little pop-out place on the trailer there we pulled back the windows we would lay him in the bassinet we would open the windows pulled up the shades where it was just complete sunlight coming in there they said you laid in the sunlight and that itself will the satellite will take care of it it was something inside of his body that had not been completely formed plus he was also dealing with the jaundice brother the light had the killer and if God poses testimonies like that I believe with all my heart under the sunlight of God's presence of Jesus thou the stream of all my comfort you are more than life to me who have a honor beside thee whom in heaven bothy I'm

[Music] [Music] [Music] you think of it like this we didn't get to this this morning but another term for that word comforter is one as an advocate it's the same it's the same process same word that is used there but you know one of the meanings of that of an advocate is there's one who is standing there not only to deliver all of the promises to us and to bring us into them but it's also the very one that when we stagger into something ignorantly he's there to make intercession for us when we stagger into a trap that's been said there's one who can stand for us Jesus Christ the righteous brother he's not just standing somewhere way out there but remember that same life inside of you and I is the same life that walked here in that body of flesh that body of flesh is seated on the throne and that same life has come back down on the inside and that same life dealing or living on the inside the worshiper once purged has some no more desire for sin the desire is to please him and him fully we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous I'll tell you right now this morning we have an advocate you have one who's already stepped on your side you have one who already before coming in you was the one who could draw you with the reality to let you know I've already paid the price I tell you this morning save your time trying to get worthy enough save your time you say how can I save my time except what he's already done if you you could clean yourself up Calvary wouldn't be needed but Calvary is where the debt was settled Amen where Jesus could say it
