and not come out and they applied the blood to be safe and uh he said the same thing's happening today we're told to go into our house and stay and not come out and he said and the same thing needs to be done we need to apply the blood because if the blood saved them then the blood will save us now as that plague is passing by so i just want to sing this morning about this blood who has the power

gossip [Music] god [Music] [Applause] okay [Music] it's [Music] [Music] so so [Music] oh [Music] this is [Music] you know if the world is going their way going to destruction the bride is going out to rejoice that's the truth this is the thought that lord gave me this morning about two boys remember the stories of the brand talking about the one boy they go into a trance mother was willing to like at a store in the world trance and she yelled oh no then there was another boy had never seen his look himself in the mirror right and he cried out mama that's me it depends what you're looking at right so we're going to look into god's word and the mirror of his word we will see ourselves today amen let's think about the love [Music] i love this song [Music] is [Music] everybody [Music] again [Music] [Applause] [Music] god [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] that's me right now [Music] reviews god [Music] oh [Music] let's stand together [Music] if [Music] yes [Music] oh the love of god oh my amen yes lord [Music] praise the name of the lord don't you love him amen how many of you have that testimony there be not enough ink to write of the love of god amen what he is what he is to us personally amen to certainly see where he has brought us from amen and where we're going amen it's a wonderful it's a wonderful reality the love of god amen a love that cleanses us a love that sanctifies us a love that positions us a love that corrects us the love that directs us and that same love is rapturing us amen the same love amen well we're just so so happy to be here and we want to just turn our attention to the word but look could we just pray and just bow our hearts before the lord as we prepare to look into the word here this morning heavenly father it's just a lord a great privilege that you have given to us that we could be gathered together once again lord knowing that there's many needs we we have gathered here lord with a real purpose in our heart and lord that's true that's to see you i said we might look into the word we might take account of our lives dear god that we go out of here better people closer to you more determined strengthened encouraged in you so we ask the lord that you will help us because we know that it will take more than our mind to do that it will take a supernatural work of almighty god lord we believe that you're still the same god we believe lord that you still open eyes you still turn hearts you're still saved you still feel with the holy ghost you still heal lord you're still delivered you're still the same god so lord this is our expectation this morning we ask the lord you would just direct us now in your word we pray may we be sensitive may we o god our hearts be open may we be moved in you lord i pray in jesus precious name amen amen first corinthians chapter 10 is where i'd like to to start here i want to go to verse verse 1 and we'll read a few verses and then let you have your your seats in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 moreover brethren i would not that you should be ignorant i mean he's grateful that god's desire is not for us to be ignorant it's to be mindful of where we're at the hour we're in to also to have that understanding of our walk and where we are i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea in other words they had committed to the direction that moses was leading them we know it wasn't moses as the man but god makes known his will his word his leadership god will take it comes into the word for that hour and god has a vessel that is set aside and there are vessels that receive that same leadership that was present in the life of the messenger so they've committed to this is what paul was saying they committed this to receive that direction that come through moses we're all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat when you think of it this was not they didn't you know this wasn't like going to a fair and there's all kinds of food stands this wasn't out there i know it's a simple but it wasn't out there who provided what they had need of god did the same god that brought them that sent the messenger with a message and the pillar of fire to confirm the promise is the same god was letting him know i'm your provider he had everything taken care of and did all drink the same spiritual drink amen god brought the manna god brought even the water from the rock it was spiritual it was spiritual it was god providing for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ you see many of them could have looked at the rock and looked at the manna and they just looked at it as something you walk you take or you drink and they looked at what came out in the natural but they failed to recognize who is it that's bringing this about why is he doing this so they failed they failed to connect what was actually going on but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness i'd like to continue to speak to you this morning on in that thought we were looking at the admonition to the spiritual mind may god bless you as you're being seated and i'd like to continue to read in this on this portion of it and uh just very intentional upon these these points just feeling just to move through this and we know that it's very it's a great blessing uh to have that of a spiritual mind and to recognize that even before you are where you are today if you hear a setting here and no matter where you're at whether you're in journey into the promised land to receive the holy ghost or you have already received the holy ghost there was always that part about you that was spiritual that did not come in the new birth that the spiritual part was already there jacob before he ever came to bethel jacob was already spiritual esau had no value to him for this birthright he sold it you see it would be one thing if you could think whatever might be of a value of a cost but to show you how lightly when god said he lightly esteemed it he sold it for a mess of pottage which was something to satisfy an earthly carnal desire but jacob was spiritual he wanted that birthright all the odds were against him there is absolutely no way if we're just looking at it in natural there's no way that jacob would be able to receive that birthright that which belonged to the firstborn we bring it down to you and i the odds were against us we were without hope let me just say it like this even though the jews had the covenants and the adoption that was spoke to them but they were hopeless without him coming and bringing them into that you see nobody could bring us into this promise outside of the lord jesus christ himself there was no man could do it no man knowing heaven nor on earth no one could do it but jacob was spiritual he was moved beyond all of the things that were around him that would tell him what are you doing this is not possible you'll never receive it i mean it's not even allotted to you look it's not even according to the law but there was a law of god already pulsating on the inside jacob just didn't know how to possess that law yet are you with me as the son and daughter of god you were always the son and daughter of god but you did not know how to possess that law but it took one of our own kind coming to you and i in order to restore this bride tree in order to restore us back to a place to where now we possess that law on the inside well law am i talking about the law of god as a son and daughter of god you're not trying to conduct yourself as a son and daughter of god it's a life within you jacob was already spiritual even within everything that was around him so the spiritual part is we're looking at this even here this morning a spiritual mind and you find how that paul would write of this here in the scripture and it's not paul think of it paul himself he knew exactly it wasn't my knowledge but this experience that he had received because paul was among those pharisees he had his training he had his teaching he had his same belief remember he was a persecutor of this way he came against that of the church of the living god but yet paul was spiritual but yet within that he was persecuting the church of the living god you see he needed help he needed alignment he needed god to come and let him see the very thing that you really desire and you're looking forward to it's been a fulfillment and god comes to him and makes it known to him and when god reveals it he doesn't have to teach paul paul do this and paul do that but paul he just lays it down and he says what would you have me to do what was that it was the inside spiritual man that no longer was walking by the orders of the sanhedrin he had received higher orders he had received orders of a heavenly voice that now has thundered on earth and spoke to his life it superseded all other orders just like when god has spoke to your life it supersedes your natural family tree it supersedes everything why because the abstract ties you back in not to a family tree but to the tree of life [Music] hallelujah and paul having that experience remember when jesus stood there with the pharisees and you know this they were letting know their pedigree you know like they have a horse or whatever morning you know they're letting the horse know you know the horse this is this pedigree and this is his dad and this is his mom right like when you know i went to buy a dog i want to know what what what's what's the dad like what's the mom like i want to know i mean if they're crazy and nutty i don't want them because this thing travels on down boy we could preach here couldn't we we got crazies and nuts in our families and we came with those jeans but there was another gene on the inside god did not unite with that gene of the natural birth but god came and gave spiritual birth to that gene that was on the inside the world thinks we're crazy the world thinks we're an oddball the world thinks we're a nut but what it is is we've been threaded amen we've been threaded to the right nut amen glory be to god and here jesus said remember their pedigree that they're standing on our fathers didn't eat manna in the wilderness and jesus said and they're everyone dead he was not talking about just you know buried he spoke spiritually see jesus was speaking standing here and here god was veiled in a body of flesh they were hearing him with natural ears they were not hearing with spiritual ears this is why they withstood him regarding the sabbath why because even in reading of the sabbath they didn't have understanding they could quote it they could read it but they didn't have understanding and jesus said they're everyone dead they're eternally lost now as we look here in the scripture let's read just a little bit further in this in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 6 let's keep going now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted now let me just make some some points here on this remember there was their desire we want meat we're tired of this manna who was that about them selfish desires were still present they were walking in the word but they still had selfish desires and everything was about them let me just say this very clearly the heart's desire of a believer is to be fully in the word let me say we we we need uh we need encouragement in the word we need to the word to be rightfully divided we need it to be rightfully divided in our life sometimes and i'll say this even to the spiritual mind you can sometimes get in a rut and you start pondering you start thinking and if you keep going in that manner and you start thinking in the negative the enemy can step right in there and then you find yourself under a cloud of doubt but you see this is where the word must be rightfully divided and the holy spirit in you and i he rightfully divides the word but we've got to rest on him to interpret that word sometimes if we've come here there when the holy spirit has come he'll come and he'll break that word he breaks it like he broke the bread before like he's opened and unveiled himself in our life to let us know who we are in that experience within our life and then he breaks that word and we say oh now i see it and what happens the cloud the darkness it goes away but they were asking things and it was all about them it wasn't enough it had nothing to do with the furtherance of the word you see what should have been first was the promise depends on what you're feeding on who wins white dog or black dog depends on which one's feeding and you still have to walk and live in this natural life as much as you would like you and i would like to check out of it there's things that comes comes my pathway i'm sure is yours and you know what it's like i don't i don't i don't feel like giving time to that right now anybody else feel that way sometimes we want we won't create a list because i'm sure you've got yours and i've got mine sometimes we look i don't feel like giving time to this but we realize there's things that we have to attend to in the natural but yet this this is where it comes to a place we do not want to be so occupied to where that christ is second or last place in our life but he's to be the first place in our life that's not just something we say it's what comes out and is expressed and lived out in our life that a person can see it's brother brown would say it make it so clear he said your life he said as a christian he said if you're truly a spirit-filled christian he said you your neighbor will truly know it i know it isn't going to be necessarily your neighbor is going to come over and say hey i know you believe the message of the hour i know you're a spiritual christian you know what it is they know something's different about you is that right they can't put a finger what church you go to what denomination you belong to denomination don't change me a church didn't change me changed you the same one paul met [Applause] the same one this message came to introduce me to and bring me into union with glory be to god verse 7 neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written notice the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play brother brandon would take this this this quote or the scripture and he says a person can say bless god i'm not an idolater the brahman said oh no no no no he said all you have to be is idle i-d-l-e in other words not going anywhere and whatever is an idol what is an idol it cannot hear it cannot see right an idle you got to pick it up put it down carry it here carry it there but see god's desire is not we're not packing around the message but the messages inside of us it's the spirit of god moving in out packing his word see to be idle you see idol itself it's just to be setting down brother brahma says you come to church go home and you do nothing about it let me just say this it's where we give our lives to god and you may not understand everything that's going on and let me just clue clue you in a moment don't look at it like oh my goodness you know if it was like brother samuel or so and so my goodness look how very many oh look you don't understand it cast down imaginations that is not helping you at all but what is it it's to recognize who's speaking to you and to recognize that word and say god let that word be formed in my life like david over and over and over and over you read it in the psalms quicken thou me according to that word quicken thou me according to that word quicken down me then i might live out thy word oh god we want it to be alive in us this is why after a service this is why as we go through we don't just leave it here but we go out we're reading we're reading realities of why they were overthrown no the bible says neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand remember they went up to the feast of bel pior why go to the feast of baal pior god said you're a separate people what does what does the feast of baal pure you're not called to that feast god brought you out of egypt that you might have a feast with him it's not it's it's you're done with the world it's like elisha you burn every bridge that's behind you you're done you're finished you see this is where what what more i'm just saying very plainly where else it's to whom shall we go i'm not looking for anything else this message has revealed to me jesus christ and i see who i am let me just say the ministering of this word supernaturally has been the vows upon my soul the coming of the holy spirit to unite us to him in union we're not looking for another message sure a lot of sure a lot of great men has god used men god has used men but to recognize when god sends a message that message is to call us back to the word back to the character of the living god oh my neither commit fornication they they went and they forsook their love and their devotion brother brahm uses the scripture and he'll speak of like how's a husband and a wi-fi he said brother brown said how would it feel he said let's just examine the scripture in terms of your relationship with your wife how would it feel he said if your wife only came once in a great while and put her hand on your hand and say honey i love you samuel that's all mushy brother bam said never let the honeymoon die i like god being mushy on me i like being mushy on him are you with me it's like you know marriage of course i know every vehicle now has those consoles they're pretty nice you can rest your arm charge your phone and all that stuff too and you know but man back in the days it was a straight bench you know you got married and she sat right there beside you but then things start coming starts drifting cares of life things are drifting that's why there has to be times of reuniting amen that that's very much in the natural in that of husband and wife it's purposeful you see you take account it's like when you tell your wife and say hey wait wait wait wait honey or a wife tells her husband hey honey can we talk not just keep going on but you sit down and you recognize something's wrong that's spiritual discernment well we're getting quiet in here maybe i need to come down here and preach today it's it's reflection because sometimes there's things that get out of line and it's got to be brought back in line and the only way it gets brought back in line you've got to have some real honest open communion feelings can get in the way everything else but this is where there's got to be some open honest communion for what reconciling preach brother samuel of laying down man i don't know we just i'm saying but that don't have nothing to do with it then why did god have paul take time not only with the corinthian church with the colossian church and with the ephesian church amen because sometimes the things that we look at are lit as little things are the very things that are hindering god from moving greater neither neither commit fornication let the love and devotion be to him and him alone i mean friends listen you understand you can tell where people's love is just watch their life you can tell where their love is right people never miss work but they miss church like nothing and brother branham told us he said you can miss a day of work now he wasn't giving you know something your union hasn't bargained for but what he was saying is he said you can do that but don't you miss church it's value it's it's a value you place on it you know how you can tell people you can say everything but it's the value whatever you value will come out in your life i know sometimes it's just like when you we speak of these things when when we we we we're looking at it i think these are things that we have to be very uh mindful of and to know exactly what god's desire is in our life notice he goes on to say let me read these verses here neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents how did they tempt christ they spoke against moses and the word some of these things you wonder you look at it and you say how in the world could they even say anything i mean when's the last time you walk through a parted sea i mean you get up every morning just walk through a parted sea they've already already been through the red sea when's the last time you saw a national power defeated not with a mighty army but with a simple humble man anointed with god a prophet that the pillar of fire was vindicated through when's the last time you saw that it's not a god of history it's a god of the i am [Applause] how could you speak against moses how could you speak against him how could you speak against how could you speak against god you recognize when they spoke against moses god said i'm taking that personally because that's the veil that i'm veiled in that's the veil that i've chosen to vindicate my word through i am his credentials this is what god was saying i am his credentials this is why it's not the word of a man coming to you and i it's not the word of a man a word of a man stir you up in your reasoning but the word of god it searches through the depths of our heart it causes us to reflect and he gives us strength and courage to rise above every doubt and every unbelief what is that that's god's credentials of himself neither murmur murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer every time attached to trial something came along oh no not this again how many times we repented of that i didn't fix that thing two weeks ago now it's right or maybe it's something else that comes along you you understand what i'm saying neither murmur you they they were murmuring what were they what was the murmuring about they were offended at what was taking place around them like moses god i've been following you why is sickness coming why is this coming i mean i'm your child i'm the elect i'm the royal seed and god says uh-huh but for me to bring that out my strength is made perfect in your weakness and god said i will take sickness from among you they came to the waters of morrow god showed up and let him see something that was standing there that they probably here they are oh this water's terrible oh this water is terrible and here was a little bush not a great big stained glass something a simple little bush a tree and moses was directed of god to get the tree and go take it cut that and place it in the water speaking of placing the atonement in the word in that of the lives of the people because water speaks of multitudes of people is that right placing the atonement the atonement is there and ever present to minister to our needs he's not just a god who saved your soul and filled you with the holy ghost but that's his commitment to say i've got everything taken care of for you i will see you through that's some meat to feed on oh my now all these things happened unto them for end samples and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world will come notice they were these were wrote for our admonition wherefore look at this in verse 12. wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall what's paul speaking of where a person becomes confident in things outside of the word being inside of them there is no other ground that is solid ground outside of the revelation of jesus christ in our soul to know who we are there's no other ground you can't stand upon sensation you cannot stand upon what i have gifts or or i can preach or my i can shout no there's no other ground that stands on that kind of a ground to say well you know i enjoy the word my you know i've got joy there's no other ground to stand upon outside of that solid ground of the word inside of you and you are inside of him that solid ground upon that ground you can face anything because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world so my thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart my thoughts are not based upon these things out here but it's simply based on the simplicity of i know where i was hallelujah and i know where he brought me to amen i know what he's done for me and that his love that part that he sowed on the inside of my life it has captured where the rest of the world said get out but on the inside that part that said have you seen my beloved have you seen my beloved can you tell me where my beloved is at that show on the inside where was it it was a place that was calling out for the word it was a womb that was already ordained for the word to come into and he was calling this is a place of rest this is a place of rest come o great dove come dove into my soul that rest this is a place of rest [Music] amen let every man take heed this is why branham would take and spend so much time here within even this chapter verse 13 there hath no temptation taken you but such is common to man oh brother samuel i would have made it how would have made it but you don't know what the devil no no no whatever came anybody's way it wasn't because it was above what any man could be tested it came but the reality it wasn't the test that brought you out it wasn't the trial oh this trial this trial took him out the trial didn't take nobody out all right come on somebody the chester the trial where lot's wife was walking it wasn't the tester trial that turned her around it was her heart was not fully surrendered to god the devil wants to make it so hard and you know the reality is it's not about you being a better moral person the word calls to that are you with me but that's not christianity christianity is where you are zeroed in and united with god well that person says well i don't drink no more praise god there's more to overcoming than just drinking i don't smoke no more praise god there's more to overcoming than just not spoken we're talking about the overcoming life on the inside of you where you and christ are no longer twain but you are one the scriptures speak of this great love story all the way through right it's the plan of redemption unfolding it's the secret god has laid out all the way through he even wrote it in the heavens he wrote it all the way through it's a secret but he's unfolded that secret slowly slowly unfolding it through lies if you catch that that ought to be something that's a very great encouragement for your life amen god doesn't unfold quickly he unfolds himself slowly the wheels of prophecy turn slow but sure and your life is a prophecy it's now made known in the word amen there's things you see about your life now that you never saw before even the clarity oh no you could say maybe years ago 5 10 20 30 years ago oh i know i'm a son of god but that reality has become more real it's become more real and it keeps on becoming more real the prophet stood at eagle rock and he makes this declaration he says oh god that you have opened your word he said this has led me to a faith i never had before 1965 why our faith grows our faith grows our faith grows just like your faith will grow in a service that's the same thing that's happening in the expanse of our lives spiritually oh but i love this next part but god is faithful somebody say that not was yes brother greg he is yeah he watched but he did once yes [Applause] and he that is is the same he that was and he that was and he that is is the same that shall be when is that it's a revelation of jesus christ who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but i tell you that's something to hang on to and say god i i feel like this would be on me but you see what i can't see give me grace to go through this lord but will with oh i like that will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you might be able to bear it amen hallelujah wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry he said i speak as to wise men are we wise this morning hallelujah judging what i say you see they were all partakers of spiritual things brother brown said they could sit and enjoy hearing the word preached they could even have joy oh speak in tongues prophesy shall sing they were partaking of spiritual meat you know they could say that's quail it was spiritual that quail was not there god provided that water oh that was just water i know i drank that water it refreshed me but it was all spiritual who i don't want to say in their right mind but who in their mind would say hey you're thirsty brother joyce says man yeah i'm awful hot man i'm thirsty here brother joey let's go to this rock and get some water rock right but sam i thought she was maybe 10 i think you had a whale somewhere or let's go some but see god hides in simplicity amen he is a fountain in a dry and thirsty land there might be times that dryness comes about your life but let me just tell you look to him because he is there with you and say god where is this place of oasis lord you've led me through this hot desert and in the desert is where prophets are molded in deserts is where his children are molded god you know i got need openness and nourishment and sustainment you've led me here and i don't want to run from here i want to receive what it is you're trying to mold in my life but i need some strength lord that's eating on the word that's looking to him that's not murmuring that's looking to him who is your all-sufficiency because our flesh is just like any other flesh if it be possible they were all partakers of spiritual things this is where it comes they failed to spiritually discern who was in their midst teaching does not bring discernment teaching of the spirit as far as where the spirit reveals brings discernment but just teaching alone does not bring discernment are you asking me discernment comes by the spirit of god when the holy ghost comes in a meeting and he comes through the word he gets in his brother bram said in god of civil age he said he gets in the word he begins to uncover satan amen he begins to reveal he begins to take the cover off he begins to expose him he begins to come and give courage he begins to come and give strength what was it those nutrients were already there within the word you here you are carrying it around and the nutrients already there but what happens he comes and the fire comes upon the lamb and then with that word that you've read and it might have been something you read even in devotion this morning and it's something that caught you but now what is it it's the spirit of god it's almost like you knowing what's on the menu and now the spirit of god said now it's time for that rail that lamb to be roasted with fire oh that's a wonderful thing but we also have to eat the pertinents thereof and when we leave out of here brother and this is where we got to eat it with bitter herbs this is where we're eating the lamb now it comes by experience it comes to dying out it comes just giving ourselves to the word not just walking away my that was a my what a service but did you recognize who's in our midst hallelujah that's keith did you recognize who was in our midst did you recognize what was what was being said i'm not saying you understood it all i the main important thing is you recognize who's in our midst it's something that's drawing you in you see it's drawing you beyond you we need to be challenged beyond our own thinking our own thinking remember it's carnal it limits us it's a sound barrier but there is a wind there is a force there is a strength that comes to lift us beyond that sound barrier what is that the mind of christ setting down they failed to they failed to discern who was in their midst they failed to discern his faithfulness to his word of promise brother bryan when when he showed up moses remember when moses stood there it was this was not a show he let him know the god of our fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob he met me and he told me to tell you this what did he say i am that i am i am action me that was that if it's spiritually discerned this is not just something that's taking place and says oh wow this is another healing ministry oh like so-and-so's healing ministry no it's not no it's not this is the message of the hour the focus is not on divine healing but divine healing is to get the attention of the people that there is a living god who is present the same god that can heal the heal the sick raise the dead is the same god who comes on the sea to give life to those who are spiritually dead he comes to awaken arise and shine they failed to discern it even standing there in egypt they failed to discern it they fail to discern god's faithfulness because when god brings his word that word of promise that god gives it's a word that comes to call us out and take us into amen brother drake you know how it is you do you're a plumber god bless his heart he likes his trait god bless his heart you know how it is you get into something you know you know you're like oh man i can't finish this i gotta finish this job you get halfway through it and something's still going on it's still leaking you don't tell the customers i don't you know what just put a bucket underneath here it'd be good sure it'll catch it and you got to keep dumping it god doesn't do things halfway he does a total deliverance a total job the same god that has brought you this far will safely take you home so he ain't gonna put you know homer buckets underneath it we'll catch this dripping you know we'll throw it out and then you know after service make sure you get the bucket back and and catch the drip no no let me get off a plum before i get down they failed to discern his provisions of grace god has sent a prophet they were in egypt living beneath oppression serving another master serving another nation this was not the character that god had called and ordained for their life god said before i can never that character oh preach before that character can never be made manifest i gotta get you out from under the condemnation i gotta get you out from underneath the oppression of the tax master i've got to set you free and bring you into the land where your character can be unfold it failed to discern here's a prophet god thought that much about me that he sent me a prophet that's how i feel i'm just trying to stay on this one focus this is the inspiration we live under this is the inspiration this inspiration of the word that's been opened in this hour this is how i look at things when i read the bible i'm not reading it through the eyes of a man when i'm hearing the message i'm not hearing it through the eyes of a man i love the statement brother branham makes in third exodus he said he he said sent the seven angels back to us with the inspiration of those seven seals we're living in that inspiration brother william that's what it is inspiration has come to you and i the letter killer but the spirit giveth life amen not just old people remember in that vision when the seven angels as they came and they were there waiting on the prophet and when the prophet came there here came those angels that were waiting for him to get there and they picked him up in that constellation and in the midst of the message coming forth god spoke concerning the young people that right brother brown says i remember what he said to me concerning you young people glory be to god what is it that you don't have to wait to a certain age much much we could preach on that it's that the same life the same truth the same word the same victory the same reality that there's a young people that in the face of all the evil and debauchery and the temptations that are upon this generation let me just tell you something the devil would like to even you know as i heard people would think and my dad sometimes would say oh he said i hate to think of my grandkids living in this age but let me tell you something if the coming of the lord carries another hundred years there's gonna be parents and young people that'll live victorious and this message and the glory and the joy will become greater and greater and later and greater because it's taking it higher and higher it's not man taking it higher it's the coming of the lord we're getting closer it didn't see the pillar of fire they didn't discern that they didn't discern it didn't catch that i know maybe not everybody saw that but i will tell you this the cloud that was by day and the pillar fire by night that was their present yes i mean to think about it you're encamped and the enemy can't get to you you're standing there and let me just say maybe like this like brother chris you're not the enemy forgive me let me use it for example it beat us like me or brother crass or brother richard and here we are brother adam they're all back their enemies they're trying trying to get at me but god said i'll be the go-between i'll be the one who fills the gap i'll be the one who stands in the breach hallelujah hey man i'll be the one that stands there as an abstract that stands between you and the enemy that's what the real holy ghost and the seal of god is it's that part of the pillar fire our inheritance that has come to you and i we are sealed until the day of our redemption we are under the inspiration of the cloud the world that has been opened in this hour and we have received a living experience our on the inheritance what does it do a spiritual admonishment what's it do to make us aware make us aware make us aware of where we're at what's going on this is why the scripture said they in psalms 106 7 when god said through david our fathers understood not the miracles they didn't understand they didn't understand what was going on they were just eating oh man man this is good wow whoo thank goodness man i'm glad we got water today man i'm glad we got manner today translate that to what paul was speaking is that people were partaking but they never were being changed the word that you and i are called to feed upon there's a lot of difference between just hearing and feeding you can listen and not be a feeder when you feed it translates into your life you can tell by looking at some of us we just don't taste food oh i just eat a little bit yeah right a little bit too much i just eat a little bit you know i just need a little problem is you're not feeding right right you like hors d'oeuvres yes and no depends on how big of a plate you give me to get them all durbs with i don't like them little things look like golf tees let's eat our croissant and let's imagine we're getting food can i have a spot of tea give me a plate sister anna like brother louie when he came to the fellowship dinners that brother brought his own plate brother william you would have really liked brother louie he was a man's man when he came to the fellowship he brought a platter not a plate a platter he did we're talking about being a feeder when we were looking at things like even as we were going into this on thursday night is to recognize feed on that word feed on it take the word into your life feed on that word there's not just listening i'm not talking about where here you are you know you're here in the service and my i've got to remember every word that's that's still listening if say god you speak to me it's when you leave out of here say god lord let that word become flesh in me where you give yourself to it where you meditate in it day and night your life is challenged you don't walk away from here and forget what kind of a person you saw but with the challenge with the challenge comes encouragement they failed they failed to understand the miracles they were overthrown they came to the very purpose that the message was given for to be united with christ he brings us into the body the finishing the setting for the rapture the whole message is capped off in the token because in him in christ under the blood full of the holy ghost in him every promise is ye and amen the grounds that belong to us as believers are not just ministered to us they are quickened to us why the purpose even when you prepare to baptize somebody sometimes i've been known in the past i've had people that come and say i want to be a baptized why why he said why would you say that because i want you to understand this is not a catholic tradition i want you to understand that this water does not change you i want you to understand that this isn't just i did something bad and i want to feel better no no no no we're not playing games why do you want to be baptized it's different many times sometimes i didn't have to ask that question it begins to come right out of the heart god's been dealing with my heart god's been dealing with my life i want to serve god i want to be united with god i don't want to just come to church i don't want to just be a part of a church i want to be united with jesus christ because remember they were all baptized brother braham said god permitted them to be baptized come through the principles of christ experience healing experience all that and yet they were overthrown why they never went all the way right right there was no discernment but think of caleb caleb was standing there and here they go across to look in the land they were but they were in the minority 2 against 10. caleb and them came across and what they saw they said dear lord these guys are too big to miss how can that be because the word is an exposure it exposed them what did it expose it exposed this just like israel was looking at goliath oh look at this guy he's got a big old armor he's got a big old you know spear he's got a big old this and he's got a big old that david said he's a philistine all right all right yeah man he's a big guy man you ever check his website out that guy you see all the statistics he's got you ought to see all the stuff he's got his blog david said he's uncircumcised david said you can take all of his websites all of his stuff it comes down to one thing he's uncircumcised you know what that means he's uncircumcision is where he's vulnerable he's under a curse oh my mama you see he was different david was looking was spiritual discernment that took him beyond just what was in the natural this man is a philistine he's uncircumcised we are the children of god amen they weren't feeling like the children of god they weren't acting like the children of god but god had to have one man come on the scene and let them know who they are one man glory be to god that god could get in his hand and demonstrate the power of god that belonged to them as covenant born sons of god caleb standing there hallelujah as he was standing the word had given caleb vision caleb made the declaration if the lord delighting us that word if it ain't used like in a manner like i don't know maybe you know if it weren't used in that way that word is used to try to help them get out of the blindness therein they were seen perfectly here but their blindness was here they were blind to who was in their midst they were blind to his grace they were blind that was a spirit of grace they were blind to his faithfulness to his promise they were blind oh what was this when you walk out and you you god provides manna what is this where the complaining and the murmur god provides quail what is this where the water comes what is that that is god's expression of love that just as i have provided a fountain in a desert i prefer i have prepared a table in the wilderness and the same god that will take you over but they understood not what was it they failed to accumulate in their heart all the signs all the wonders what was all the spiritual food they failed to accumulate in their heart brother branham makes that statement i read from that on thursday night the very next paragraph he says we're on the sea troublesome times are ahead hey listen friends in this hour it requires faith to be made manifest it's not faith that's out there saying i got this and i got that and i got this and i got his faith to recognize he said don't you fear to go anywhere for the never failing presence of god is with you whether so ever thou cost i could say something here but you would probably think i'm political but god didn't call us to a spiritual bunker house to go hide in a spiritual basement are you with me brother brown said a man that runs in the basement something's wrong when there's light shining are you with me it's light to come out this walk in the light faith to walk and to live in this hour is to come back to where you're standing examine where you're standing examine the love of god in your life and then let the perfect love cast out all fear amen god never intended for us to be subservient to fear he wants us to walk in his love amen if there's one if there's one bunker that god wanted us to fall into brother brown says it over and over he said it's not a fallout shelter it's a falling jesus it's a falling jesus amen oh my we're protected in him amen you see what caleb had let me just bring this down here but when i say bring it down don't don't go ahead and go to the bathroom in your mind don't go ahead and leave and go and check out and go to your favorite steak steakhouse spiritual admonition they all had the word preached to him but caleb and joshua well joy they had been accumulating all along the things that god had done for them right you know how personal they took it caleb said if i had been the only one oh now i feel like preaching now if i had been the only one god would have still sent this message how can you say that caleb your great-grandfather is a duke of edom you're of the lineage of esau hello somebody a kenyan site you see his first birth was against him but it was spiritual down there beneath that first prayer he was not going to be controlled by his first purse there was something greater even when brother's saying he felt like giving up when it looked like there's no hope but something on the inside what was that supernaturally god was sounding and he was calling out to caleb the rest of him cut her looks and said what promise have you got caleb even took it personal god told my prophet my messenger to select me to represent judah he was he was he did not have a gene of judah in him are you with me but god chose him god chose you and i you would look at him and say well what about the jews because the jews would reject him when he came but this gospel would return to the jews he would come to the gentiles and then come back to the jews who is it the lion of the tribe of judah his life inside of you and i the preserving brother brian of his word of his truth is spirit-filled people the words out here people can hack and cut that oh we're going to change the version of the bible you can't change this version this is an authorized version it was a personal book signing by the author himself man hallelujah it's been a personal book signing it's the authorized version it ain't king james it's king jesus amen it's an authorized version of the word that which was written is now made fresh [Applause] we could take our bibles take the tapes take the books take all those things maybe someday they will but there's one thing about it you cannot take the word from out of our hearts that word was there inside of that seed the message only come to declare it and say lazarus come forth this message called our nay come forth [Applause] [Music] this message is the chapter 11 of john standing between 10 and 10 stands in the midst and says come forth i believe i feel like preaching hallelujah amen lebron said with caleb and joshua he said what was it they were positionally born in christ they had a knowledge of the word and the word became manifested remember every one of those israelites had the word of god preached to them but it only taken effect upon caleb and joshua to realize what it was all about everybody else getting this wonderful my what a move of god man wasn't that good man wasn't this they were enjoying all the same all the same spiritual blessings but for caleb and joshua you see the inspiration as it was poured out it was anointing them with faith faith to believe in the impossible faith that would carry them and give them strength to cast down imagination you see satan his job is to try to talk you out of the promises his job is to try to hide from you who you really are but god comes to disclose who you really are to discern who is in our midst who it is that's speaking to our hearts amen as a person that the purpose god deals with their life here they repent baptized in the name of jesus christ that they might come into that place to receive the gift of the holy ghost and to receive the gift of the holy ghost i'm stopping we'll pick this up it doesn't mean your battles are done brother brian it'd be kind of hard to fight a battle if you don't know somebody's there it's got strength be hard brother carlos if you think man how am i going to see brother aaron this is the ground we got to stand on the thoughts our ground that we have to stand on is is i know in whom i have believed amen and i am persuaded how can you be so perseverant because i heard his voice he's spoken here he spoke in here he laid claim on my life how do you know he laid claim on your life how do you know did you feel it no because feelings left me how do you know you still make mistakes how do you know ooh somebody says sicking how do you know how do you know because i know what i was before this token came and i know what i am now i know the things that i used to love i don't love no more and i have believed every word of god that's ground to stand on and if you don't have that ground this morning come on come on get on over here in the promised land anything that's holding you back repent repent means to clearly not just say well i can't help this and no no no repent say god forgive me lord eternal repentance and let god take you because when you come into this i want to drop this when you come into this this place this land brother brabham says this is the land of the overcomers this is the land where overcomers make manifest the overcomer that has already overcome and prevailed in them can i have just a human battles wars killings fightings that's all part of the land of canaan but it's not fighting like oh no i gotta fight this belly again no no you recognize it's made person of you this is my promise this isn't your land get out well you don't understand we built a city here this is where a city is at this complex has lingered in your family a long time get out get out this is the land of the holy ghost this is the land where sons and daughters exercise their authority by the quickening power you don't know how you know how thick these walls are that we built god didn't take battering rams to get him down you know what god said to do brother you know what he said do he said march around him and blow the horns sound the music i'm not gonna go all around the church i'll get too tired but god told a march around the walls brother greg and that's where mine would say how is marching around walls going to take down stones i mean really have you considered the mortar have you considered what had to lift these uh rocks up there and then if you had a brother like brother mark beside you brother mark would have the calculations they had to use this particular thing to get it up there and to put it down but that wasn't necessary god said i give you the land as i was with moses so i be with you when you come to an obstacle stand still remember the commission that is upon your life speak and go forward amen hallelujah and walls on their seventh day brother walls the seventh time around brother drake then walls begin to move paradox explain to me how ray rahab's house was still standing [Music] because her house was not resting on the foundation of jericho her house was resting on the foundation of god's revealed word under the token though everything was shaking all around but in the midst of it it said oh my this shaking's going on but in that house the glory of the lord the shekinah glory was there they said praise god this shaking's going on it's time for deliverance what was it spiritual minded they caught what was all about it had an effect upon him and they had to eat that meat of the word what did god tell them in joshua 1. be thou careful mindful to observe all that moses has spoke to you observe it all give value to it give place to it in your life regardless of how you feel or how you think your place to it yes be strong and have a good courage observe those things which moses has spoken what's wrote in the law and meditate on them day and night it's alive you're taking that word and meditating through meditating through your life the thought comes i'm redeemed another rhymes you'll never forsake his own amen sickness i'm gonna get you i'm the lord that healthy amen it's a pulsation it's a heartbeat it's his life you'll never make it he's the author and finisher of my faith you don't understand anything he is my wisdom amen look at you you're not growing i'm not a mushroom i'm an oak tree yeah but what does that mean i'm growing little by little by little amen but i'm wrong this is the value of the word we come into these places as we come into the land this land that we're in battles wars fighting he is our sufficiency he is our strength amen how is it master how is it that we're able to stand in this hour oh brother samuel because i'm listening to medical experts you might as well forget it i know that might be touchy with some people but the reality of that's not why we're standing they're as confused as everybody else is one time this way one time this way this way this way this way they're not saying we want we don't walk around arrogant you understand but we also are not ignorant to what's going on we're not ignorant to that but we look at these things that we're facing how not i'm not talking about the virus this is that's a small thing compared to the spiritual things that's going on amen how are we standing it's by his grace and i say this with just let me just i'll just stop here we we we pick it up it's not enough and i i i pray it's just for everyone as you look to this as your home assembly and you look to me as your pastor i speak from the depths of my heart don't let it just be a partaking of spiritual meat and spiritual dream and spiritual blessings but let god bring you to a place if you haven't come there what's been ministered to you this morning is why not i am for you the same god that brought you out of egypt will take you all the way and i say for each for each and every one of us don't stop eating when you come into times in your life we don't we do not grow up overnight right there's times when we we make mistakes this is where you have to eat and i'm not just talking about humble pie that's part of it but i'm also talking about with eating on the word to take in the word and it's not things brother aaron when you sit down and eat you don't sit there and look at the steak you're eating because i know you like steak you don't sit there and look at the steak no matter how big the cut is and say wow look at this hey hey amanda look at this vitamin in here whoa aaron look at that vitamin e you don't do that right i know you like steak too you don't do that i know this is simple if you want better examples you ask god to inspire me with different ones you you don't think that way do you sister do you think that way oh my this chicken can you see oh look at that grandma protein you don't do that you know what you do you know i'm hungry and in here is sustenance for me you're not worried about who can the vitamin k get to the adrenal glands move to the neurotransmitters can it make sure that the potassium gets there to calm me down so i'm not so you don't worry about that if you're eating like that just remind me not to go out to eat with you because you disturb my what do you do what do you do you know what you just eat you let the body take the nutrients where it needs to go and that's what eating strong meat is you're not worried and looking at where is this going where is that going you're just eating on the word you're trusting the body you're trusting the inside man to take the vitamin a and get it where it needs to go you're trusting the inside man to take vitamin e where it needs to go you know there's vitamins in that word hallelujah let's stand that's spiritual admonishment don't listen to me those are even on the internet listen to me i know i'm not the only one listening to messages over and over sometimes they get into a series of things and there might be messages god will bring me right back into listen to this one listen to that one listen to listen listening listen and there's things i'll set there when i say set there brother what i mean is the other day let me tell you there could be a couple yeah i was this was this was the other week i listened this particular message better listen to it have my little airpods in and doing something real spiritual you know what it's doing cleaning out the car and i heard read abraham say so anthony how many times i listen this message now my wife can tell you i do this all the time how many times whoa and it's like i never heard that but when you hear that part what is it it's another key it opens the picture a little bit more you see it's not me prying i want i'm not prying i'm just listening i'm feeding and then all of a sudden really brian here comes one of those raven i don't want to call an angel or raven but brother branham used that example with elijah here he comes by [Music] so whatever your favorite one is baloney fried bologna filet mignon or whatever drops it and all of a sudden oh glory to god thank you lord what's happened nourishment has hit brother aaron and you say lord it's so precious that's what i want in my life that's what i want you hear the word the words calling you what's it called what's the word doing the words calling to the character on the inside is feasting on that word as a molding and a shaping that's going on i hope you don't miss the example that i felt impressed to give what i'm trying to tell you is don't miss your opportunities to feed on the word what should i do you put on a message you go in devotion if you're in devotion in the morning you put on a message say lord give me my daily bread this day lord help me to glean what i need to but samuel sometimes i i'm work put it on while you're working put it on while you're ironing it put it on while you're doing the dishes put it on i don't care if people call me cardinal or what some of the greatest times i have because i'm out in the dirt around the landscaping but i'm listening i might be walking walking on the path but i'm listening sometimes what it is to me i'm so open in that moment i know i probably scared away a lot more deer than i probably could have shot if i'm a good shot that is but my point is is that it's making yourself available if you never go to eat if you never go to eat [Music] how are you going to get nutrients [Music] i know sometimes it seems like in this dna or intermittent fasting you don't want to be intermittent spiritually why starve yourself for god from god give him everything give him everything the bible said we're to be fat i like that this part in the scripture would be as fat as calves in the star the word fattens us up but it don't make us lazy when we really receive it you know what that fat does what does the fat do for the animals that's going into the wintertime like you see the deer right now they're they left the beans they're on the acorns now white oak and red oak than pin oak those acorns are a lot of fat is that right the bears them bears and bears get a lot of they gain a lot of weight why they're getting ready to hibernate they need fat for their body to endure during the time of hibernation that's what the word when it speaks of being fat as calves in a star it doesn't mean that we'll wallow around and can't hardly get around oh i can't do nothing boy this word is so good no no no no no it's talking about the nutrients necessary nutrients and strength in our life to live even in times of winter when all the beautiful leaves are gone when you can't seem to find a where's that flower at i wish the flowers were here but it gives you something to say there'll be another spring [Music] i've taken it's been some time but i trust here this this morning that this has really been we've taken this spiritual admonition because i don't believe i'm looking at people this morning we're just coming to church to play around i'm not speaking to people who are just coming to fulfill a duty i'm speaking to the bride of jesus christ it says there's one thing that i have one goal and that's the rapture and i want to live every day every moment as if it's the next moment i want to live pleasing to him i believe i'm speaking to people i say i see what the spiritual mean the spiritual drink i know what he's saying to me brother drake you leave out of a service it's as though you were the only guy here and he spoke to you and you said this is what was spoke to me someone said really man it's tremendous and then sister rebecca said to you yeah but this is what he said to me did you see what it is it's personal [Music] it's not a church growing us [Music] it's the life of christ himself that's maturing us let's pray anyone want to be remembered in prayer no matter where you might be say god remember me lord amen heavenly father you have swept over our soul you have spoke to us lord words of life spiritual admonition now father according to every desire that's behind every hand lord will you minister according to their request and their need their hand went up because lord they know it discerned to know that they're in your presence to know that you're the god of your word to know that it is your grace and your faithfulness to your word to know that lord who you are to know who they they are god it it's that reality and so lord as they raised their hand that was a defiance of gravity but i think lord on the inside it was like that where jacob defied his natural birth and persevered to the birthright it's where rahab denied the curse that was upon that city and the spiritual part on the inside persevered for the true token its lives and hearts oh god that where the
