grateful for what God has done and what he's doing in our midst man you love him we certainly just so grateful for His grace let's turn in our Bibles if we could to Romans chapter 9 verse 25 if we could begin reading there I just want to read a few verses of scripture verse 25 Romans 9 as he saith also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them you're not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God Isaiah also cried concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work were the Lord make upon the earth as Isaiah said before except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as Sodom and made like unto Gomorrha a man I'd like to speak to you on a thought called preserved preserved let's just bow our heads and word of Prayer Lord Jesus there's not one of us Lord that ever gathered here this morning Lord are those that would even Lord be at home be streaming this sort would archive it later there's not one of us that can say that we don't have need of you but father day by day the more that you work in our lives just the more helpless we realize that we are in ourselves and we see Lord God the greatness of what it is to trust you because Lord we are your workmanship Lord you started this work in our lives you will finish apart performing it to the day of Jesus Christ this is Lord our rest is in you we pray Heavenly Father this morning that you would just move among us and speak to us in a very personal way Lord there's no way that I can deliver the thoughts that have been so accumulated on my heart from the past few days Lord but father I'm trusting you that Lord gave the inspiration as it dropped Lord one thought after another that you would deliver Lord father to our hearts and may you find hearts that are open Lord and may we be so transformed Lord God and changed Lord God here this morning we pray Lord God for every need that's here for every sickness Lord for Lord whether it be of a sickness in the physical realm or God or on the spiritual realm Lord either that in the body or that in the soul order in the spirit father you are our healer Lord I pray that God that you would just move on the Lord God may our hearts be warmed in your presence Lord and drawn to you I pray in a great tenderness Lord father with a desire to be more fervent Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we ask you Lord in Jesus name Amen god bless you be seated some of you know some of you maybe didn't know this past week my family and I we had had it kind of it had it planned out for vacation and I think my wife for doing that in planning it because those things if it was left up to me to be planned out he'd never get done and I'm glad she did that and some things that I want to just kind of just just take a pause from some of the other things that we have been dealing with Lord willing we'll resume here on that but during this time you know I it was truly a time of a great refreshment and rest I probably one of the I told my wife I and told others I said I think it's the best vacation I've ever had and my wife said honey it's the only vacation that we have taken and then that's true most of the time you know the family when you know the Lord would lay it upon the heart to go and maybe do meeting somewhere I'm so focused even before going to those meetings that you know it probably is really isn't much fun you know I'm just focused on that and sometimes we may take a day here or there but after that you're always so spent and you are just it's such a relief and but I really do think God for this time that we had together and as I stood there we were over there in the state of Pennsylvania and you're Lancaster and we went to we went to a place which is probably pretty common to many of you as that as known as Gettysburg and I stood there we went on multiple sites and climbed multiple places went through the battlefield over three days just taking in everything standing in places and listening to Rangers and different ones described it listening to orators and reading things throughout the museum and those things that were there and I'll just be very honest with you it was overwhelmingly sobering it was places of great somber I turned to one man who was there at the place of really what was known as Pickett's Charge and I turned to the man I said you know four days I said this has been very sombering and the man looked at me he said I've been here multiple times he said there's not a day that I don't come here or a year that it's not still sombering because you you realize where you're standing that there are not just lives they've been given but the calls and I looked upon these things and there was much inspiration that really began to drop in the heart within the last day that we were there and things just began to just mount up and my wife I handed her my phone on the way out and I told her I said just start typing certain points that I'm giving to you just type and I'll I'll pick it up later a lot of times she does that for me and I it doesn't make much sense to her but it does to me when it's dropping and so so I had her to to take those things down there are many things that even as we were coming there I was journeying there we went to to Lancaster first and we were journeying there and the thought kept striking my heart on preserved and I had no idea that this is something what was going to evolve out of this or that inspiration that I would be speaking this I was just thinking on the fault merely of inspiration and this is the thought that I was I was just reflecting in my meditation was throughout even the time that we were there in Lancaster I was just I was thinking in this thought line over what is true preservation and I was thinking this what does it mean to be preserved and how is it that God preserves his outworking in the fulfillment of his message those thoughts I set there we were we were at a place there in Lancaster and those thoughts I was just meditating on those thoughts and and reflecting on that and I begin to think of these things and that the word preserved then it began to strike me on the way out of Gettysburg there the other morning and I think of things that were brother Branham he refers in this hour that we're living in he speaks in 1954 he'll speak in prayer into the Lord and he'll make a statement where he says I were happy to know that the man's blood is down through the ages though it costs that blood we're sorry that it cost it but it brought this Bible that it does it to us tonight as free literature and we can read it as American citizens and have a right to worship you according to the dictates of our conscience the way we read the word and we're thankful for our nation and for our people and for the freedom that we have you see friends these are something you know that it's not just something those of you that have known me you know the stand I'm not just looking at the doctrine that God has brought to us and restoring these great truths one thing that I look at i watch how brother branham's approaches on things those are many of the things that I'll study behind it's me it's more than words there's a stairs that there's an approach of things and it's a character and I want my character to be shaped and I believe it is by the same Living God who shaped the character of the Prophet that's my desire because this is to me what makes this the message so glorious is is to even see how that what we were what was brought to us was not just something that we were told to do this and don't do this and don't do that but it's it's much greater than that what was brought to us by the presence of the Living God God even brought it on display in the life of the Prophet he brought it on display and I I there's more than I could say within that but I I come to this point where brother brems says we're thankful for a nation and for our people and for the freedom that we have and we pray that you'll preserve this Lord I look at this and I think of statements many things begin to ring in my heart even as I stood there in the National Cemetery and then on the way back and things just begin to accumulate I thought of the freedoms we enjoy and the prophet of God in this hour he pointed out and it wasn't just something that was said loosely it was shown within the scriptures of where we are you understand there were men than all that had even during the time where the Prophet was here and those that had been before it where they had made a different announcements that the coming of the Lord is here and it's gonna happen in this particular state and it's gonna happen in this city and all of those things no doubt both men were inspired but their inspiration was not according to the channel of God's Word it's like this when you look at a map I think here we were we elected not to do there and I'm now give you my our whole vacation thing but I want you to understand this we elected not to do the bus tour because to do the bus tour of the battlefields it's two hours long I don't want to just mean I want to walk in these places some of these places that you might seem well this is important but there's other places that I want to just I want to get out and walk I want to move in some of these places I want to just take some of the sin so here we are we're listening to an audio dramatization and these points that are being made within these places and as I'm looking at the map the one time I had the map well I seen the map I seen the route of the audio tour on the map but the problem was is that where I was at and how the audio tour map was depicted here I needed to turn it the right way because of where I was positioned and and I didn't realize that and Here I am I'm going around and thinking where is the starting pot spot for this where where is the starting spot you know and I'm just looking at and I realized you know then it dawns on me and once it dawns on me once I turn it I said oh I see it now and I'm so thankful that God came in this hour and this map that you and I have this blueprint that I couldn't see where I was at I didn't know who I was but he said turn the picture like this and and then I can begin to see him and I see who who he is I see Christ being revealed I recognized God's voice in this hour I think God for that it took God to come and say turn it oh okay now I know where I'm at now I know where I'm at it's a big help to know where you're at because then you can know what next road to look for brother Brown made a statement and in in in admonishing us in Christ the mystery of God revealed he told us that these when we think of this this statement of the Lord may you preserve this freedom and when I think of that a look at how that brother told us in Christ the mystery that these gatherings that we are having now and in might I say oh just like this they will be fond memories he spoken that message and went through other places and let us know within this hour let me tell you something this was not the wisdom of a man this is the wisdom of God when he would take messages live like the 3rd Exodus and speak to us bringing all the way up from the scriptures and show us what happened in Egypt was a parallel and a prophecy of this hour where just as it was in Egypt they would raise up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph and he would begin to persecute the children of Israel but yet all of that was under God's plan because Israel had to get back into her homeland so all of these things being identified of what you and I are seeing taking place around us I really believe this with all of my heart that without God giving the light of this message in the hour we would be nothing but guessers and presume errs and assuming things and wondering and I'll tell you this here without an anchoring in the heart we would be filled with fear listen them but the Bible is clear men's hearts are failing for fear never before has the drugs and everything and I'm not talking about street drugs I'm talking about prescription drugs never has it been but you see it's like an undercurrent wherein they cannot put a hold upon it but remember just as nature is experiencing her nervous frustrations for the event that is upon us in the in the in in the coming of the Millennium the tribulation so is the world though they don't recognize what's going on they're aware something is soon is to take place and let me say this to you it's an old story it's been told a long time but there is a literal Jesus and there is a literal coming hallelujah and it's in this time this hour that Peter could prophetically speak by the Spirit of God and saying that people would look and say Oh things continue on as they always have with no alert to what's going on I think God for light in this hour I think God for this message that he sent to us I consider it how that the Prophet he I told Paul we were standing there in one place he and I were together in the National Cemetery we were standing there and I told him I said Paul I want you to look at this here you have and here you have at this place was the turning point of the Civil War this might be a matter of opinion and that's fine but you know when you look at generally in them and those those men that had continuously won and such calculating such they had all they had a lot of wisdom are you with me but one move you take Stonewall Jackson that's killed in the battle before then he falls back on to Longstreet and I'm not here to give you a history lesson I'm just trying to show you this one point I stood there and I told Paul so Paul do you realize that there's no way it could have been two nations I said what was it that stepped in sovereignly and even where these men would take these positions to where even the North the Union would get there first and take the high ground what was that that's the sovereignty of God because the Scriptures did not say to lambs it said there was a lamb who rose up it was not a North in the South it was a lamb that Rosa you see God he's watching over his word hallelujah it could not be it could not happen in that way and that's exactly as you look at the prophet standing in this hour and he's able to identify the trumpets that have met have been blown he's able to look at it and say what was it that caused that world were warned to stop on the eleventh month and the eleventh day at the eleventh hour at the 11th minute what was it nobody else knows they don't understand but that was the signal that this is the final outpouring of the Holy Ghost the final visitation to the Gentile the 11th hour worker as spoken of in the scriptures you see this way let me say this to you this is one thing this message it will not take you outside of the scripture it'll place you in the scripture you might be looking at something but all you got to do is follow him and he'll turn it and you see where to make the turns it places it perfectly of where we're at that you and I can see where we're at we're living in that day even where you look I don't have time to read all of these scriptures but in Revelation 7 here in the latter part of verse 6 it's speaking of the tribulation that's breaking upon the earth but then it immediately goes in the beginning of Revelation 7 and it's speaks of God's pace of grace that where he will not allow all of this to be consumed and wiped off until he has sealed the servants of God speaking of the Jews you see the Jews were not in Palestine and to think of it even in this age listen to me now we're men from even other places and where that that little place of Israel a little country if I put it upon a map you could look at that map and you could overlook it's just a small little thing let me tell you something it's not about the size it's God who is with her it's not about your size it's the God who is behind you hallelujah when you're standing on his side then you can say if God be for us who can be against us one of the one little nation and yet God notice God's he's faithful to perform his word I trust that we can take such a hope in this this morning aloud the Spirit of God to minister this tree down to your need and don't just leave it up here to realize that everything that's needed in your life and in my life it's not going to be me and you putting ourselves in place it is God Himself that is placing his children for not only did he give a message to call us out but within this same message is our inheritance a man it is the Moses Commission and the Joshua Commission hallelujah it's what's in there and everything that you have need of healing in your body deliverance the Holy Ghost everything everything all of that positioning he is the one who brings us to that place doesn't force it think of this and I spoke on that here with the Jews and how that that airline how that they move them back to the homeland and they begin to make secret missions and rendevouz to get them back there in their homeland never before was she recognized as a nation but here she is she has her own flag she has representation I'm asking you who did that that's God because he said in his word that that the fig tree when you want to know what time it is look at the fig tree if you want to know what time it is whether you're early for work late for work or it's lunchtime or whatever more you've got a clock to go by God gave a timepiece that the believer could look at and you recognize when you're looking at Israel hey this is a promise and we're living here in this time and I'll ghosts much to say this right here if there's no other reason why that the man who was put in presidential power if there was no other reason for this nation than to declare that Jerusalem is the capital and move the embassy if this for no other reason let me tell you about this right here that was not the voting booth that was not the Electoral College it is the sovereignty of God for the Scriptures declare that God lets powers be that be the Bible said that he lifts up Athenian you'll take down a team so we need not be focused on who is king who isn't king who could be we need to be focused and make sure that Jesus Christ is our King [Applause] because of this kingdom there is no in [Applause] so when I think of this passage of Scripture that was so inspiring to my heart as were just we're leaving out of there I thought of how that they found a grain of wheat that was in the Garner's of Egypt from the days of Joseph you remember Joseph he's not fully aware of why he's in Egypt he's been sold into slavery has been rejected of his brothers I don't have time to go through all of these parts because I know some are not aware of these types that are sitting here but that was all the portrayal of the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ he was rejected of his brethren but while he was away he took a Gentile bride when the Gentile bride has put away in the palace in rapture of and promised of the word then he reveals himself to his brethren which is the promise laying in the scripture you see these are not things that have been contrived from the intellects of man or from putting man's theology and bookstores together no no this is what God has already declared in his word and God has sent inspiration in this hour that these things are not just things that are to be but we see them as modern events that are made clear by prophecy Oh glory be to God I think of this when they planted that that kernel of wheat that they found from the days of Joseph thousands of years old but that had the germ of life in it they planted it and it brought forth the same kind of a crop it's showing that germ of life if that same life be present Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also if you planted you bought from the store and probably most in this I know there's some you know gardeners setting in here and things like that I don't want to call them professional even though they probably are but you know they could look at something and say no that's not a tomato plant so let us plan to go back to the store get we're going to plant plant just somewhere else we needed more tomato plants but you could look at the characteristics you understand if you wanted a tomato plant you're not going to be acceptable a lettuce plant but how do you know what it is plant it and when you plan it the germ of life that is already there will declare itself god is promise and I this is even for those it's a good revisiting point for all of us but even for some that would be new or coming in among us or maybe for your heart you've wondered why is this speaking of a message what is this it's a scriptural term a message it's just like when you look at a text message or whatever more it's something that's intended and it's sent a message God has already had it laying here but when the Holy Spirit comes upon it he sends it he said I've sent my word and it will not return back to me void are you with me and there is a text thread that is then open and many prophecies and things of the scriptures begin to be linked together and you no longer just have one little part but now a picture is beginning to come forth a whole thread begins to open up a scarlet all the way through the scriptures where you see the blood all the way through the plan of redemption why because this is no longer we're not just looking and saying that's the Bible we see it this is the book of redemption this is where my name is written it's in here that I find my identification it's not just history but it's a book of prophecy for me so God God will send a messenger a messenger has a message gotta send a prophet I want you to think of this how a channel of inspiration will become open because as the Prophet placed it in one place and the message the rapture you find this see this is the thing you find this all the way through the Old Testament when the Israel would get away and they would get away from their inheritance you see inheritance is more than just living on the land that belongs to you but inheritance is having everything that belongs to you let me tell you something there was something much more valuable than the dirt they were standing on and that was the presence of the Living God there's nothing more valuable than the presence of Jesus Christ this Bible and I think God for it I think God how many could carry this how many places that it's in and from what I was told you know brother Mike Seaver was sharing it with me here a couple of weeks ago they actually told him don't send Bibles in that have thin paper because when you send them into the prison they tear out the pages and roll them up for cigarettes because that paper makes good but let me tell you something that's not everybody there might be let me tell you something there might have been many that where that's what happened to it but I believe with all my heart there's some lives that have been touched by God coming down and bringing conviction and turning their hearts around and they begin to value more than paper they value the God who inspired the word and brought the mix into the heart to where they would come to know that there is someone there is someone who cares there is someone who can do something about my situation because let me tell you something there's a greater prison than any federal prison there's a greater jail than any local county jail and that is the prison cell of unbelief in your heart where you're bound in unbelief where but there has already been a price that's been paid and let me just tell you this right here the keys not a hidden key it's a simple key that will unlock the door his faith in what you are hearing that's a living God who is touching my heart that's for me that freedom that Liberty that's for me and you watch by the key of faith if thou canst believe all things are possible that key if hey we'll unlock the door that you can walk free I think God for that there's a channel of inspiration the profit directed by the holy ghost leads us into this place where David would see the need to bring the ark back to Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem you see where the Ark of the Covenant was here the presence of the Lord would come the Ark of the Lord the Urim all these things listen to me what's this watch the Urim in the days of Saul the Urim where they would go before and these the lights the BRIT on the breastplate of the high priests when something was to be spoken a dream something was to be said or they were needing needing to know God's will they were to bring that before that Urim and someone but the Bible says in the days of Saul they stopped consulting the Urim and the Sun watch this the Prophet picks this up here the Spirit of God points this out these are not just loose statements that are in their scriptures but he points it out that that's why David even acted the way he did and when David looking at the Ark of God needs to come back he said he had the right motive and right objective and I believe that's always something that were to check because the motive and objective is something that can be sensed behind it he said David had got this revelation he had the right motive he had the right objective listen to me it was the will of God to bring it back to Jerusalem the Prophet brings it over and he says see it is God's will for a revival in this generation but he's separating it so that you and I might see here must there is an appropriate Channel David consulted thousands and the Prophet said the reason he did that is because the Urim had been done away with in the days of salt let me just say it like this habits can become habits very quickly that's why we don't want to be habit people I'm talking about in our walk with God if you put your keys always on the coffee table on that time like that do it in otherwise you who knows you may read your bike to work I'm talking about that that serving God is not something that that we desire or should we ever we ought to be sensitive that it doesn't become a habit it ought to be a love affair and and there's all sorts of the conditions of this age that are there to try to pull you and tear you away from that all of us so we're not let's not be ignorant of that but let us be conscious of this right here to say Lord this age is truly an age unfit for humans to live but you are still God it was unfit for Daniel to live in the da lion's den but you were there with him it was not a fit place for Daniel and the rest of the be believers there in Babylon has he stood there on the cabinet but you were with him you see it's inviting God on the scene calling Jesus on the scene for your need in your life in your situation he's a personal God to every one of us that's his desire so here there has to be a channel of inspiration that's open blue Bram's talks about how he said them ecclesiastical groups in the message rapture they'd get everything all mixed up and he would send a prophet raise him up from nowhere as Bible readers you know that you try to trace back where Elijah come from it's like they step out of nowhere you know what it was listen to me very carefully they were nobodies there was nothing revered about them oh this is gonna be a great orator this man's gonna be a great speaker someday this man on the contrary God takes weaklings people who are despised why would he do that that he might manifest his glory I love that my prayer is is just as the Prophet over and over reiterated in perfect strength throughout that message God let me die the Prophet made that a prayer unto God for what he said God the revival that's coming on there's no way that I can do this but Lord it'll take your strength so let me move back that's the same way with a rapture that's the same way in everyday life that's the same way in every whatever your need in situation is it's the same way this morning all you can have to say is Lord help me to get out of the way he'd send a prophet raise him up for know where he belonged listen this this is important he belonged to none of their situations he should have said denominations no situations is appropriate because it's situations now he belonged he belonged to none of their situations and speak his word I'm standing there and some of you I know that are no doubt very versed on this and my son Paul he knows things when we goes down through different things he associates things by by dates of events in history so when I need to know what happened on a certain war in this event Paul help me he can tell me I wish I was better in that you know but I'm standing there and you know I heard this over and over I read it in a museum I heard it over and over I heard of the standing at the National Cemetery I heard it when we were there at the David wills House where President Lincoln I stood in the bedroom where he put the finishing touches on the Gettysburg Address and I just stood there and I told my wife I told the rest of them I stood there and looked the same bedspread you know they redid the wallpaper I stood right there and I said my to think of this the inspiration it fell right here you know President Lincoln they have him standing out before the people in front of that house in that evening after dinner and he tells them I don't know what I'm gonna say tomorrow you say well I thought he had some ideas down there's a lot of times I have ideas down but I don't know what I'm gonna say you don't know you don't know but the inspiration I thought I looked at that little table I seen that chair and you're just looking at all this this is going on and you're seeing inspiration things because here you find something in this the war still going on but here they're going to dedicate what has happened on that field where men have fallen and they said it would equate today of all the lives that are lost if it was by our population it would equate to six million men that's incredible that's very sombering but this is a point out this is where I was just enthralled I kept looking at this there was a man by the name of let me get his name correct Edward Everett and this man is the one whom when David wills was inviting them to come and speak and dedicate that National Cemetery and all these things he was a noted orator of the day he was well noted he was a college president he was a politician he and this is the thing the man spoke for two hours and what they wrote to Abraham Lincoln at the end we would like for you to show up but make it a few appropriate remarks but see it was expected of this Everett fellow it was nothing in those days as they said for somebody to speak two hours I'm not trying to get that back this morning but the people expected that and you know this is the first time I heard that man's name I read about his name the only thing that I I've never even read the speech yet they say a copy of the speech is out there but there's not been active guarantee there's not one of you in here if you ever had to learn anything about Gettysburg and when we would we're teaching in school and having the kids remember the Gettysburg Address and other things like that I never ever had them to try to remember it because I didn't even know Edward Everett he's plugged for two hours and the Gettysburg Address was two minutes and 34 seconds and that included pause for applause sale was not a long work that was needed it was a short quick work hallelujah it was it was the capturing of thoughts of what had taken place and even Everett itself would write to Lincoln and say what I do it took me two hours you were able to adequately conceive and bring forth within two minutes it's not the length it's not the quantity it's the quality I always thought a brother Roy shoes berry god bless her brother brother Roy was there that night and you know I think was back at it might have been back in 96 or somewhere there and sitting on the front row in those meetings and he said you know brother Roy I won't try to go in his voice but brother Roy said you know what he said the devil can't do anything he said God can take the shortest verse of scripture in this Bible and whip Satan all over this platform so truth jesus wept we can preach on God coming down and becoming man are you listening we can just take a text visa sweat and preach about redemptive work Oh Lord but here what's in this Gettysburg Address I'm not going to read it to you but there's things that are mentioned here within this where he speaks of a new nation you know that how he Abraham now watch the church says Abraham Lincoln starts this address you might say I didn't think this was a history chord this is not a history course this morning I'm going somewhere he starts by referring back to the original motive and objective and the original document four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal you see he was not loosely gathering things these weren't just contrived ideas here etched back to the original document and he's pulling the words that were given in the original document and he's applying it for right now he's letting it be known that our words know that they're not gonna be remembered but these words are remembered he said they're not gonna be remembered but what has happened on this field will be remembered and he goes on to make this of these last few remarks he says here he says that wery highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain those lives that risk their lives to bring this Bible to where you and I have a copy of it they died not in vain the profits of all that were hacked in pieces and all they died not in vain men gallant men the Prophet will use those words gallant men that it whittled before us I think of how brother Ram said the first time I stood he said I went to Los Angeles he said I remembered Aimee Semple McPherson and I wanted to go where she was buried and once you think of this listen this is a character point he was not condoning women preaching you asked me this is a character point on this this is how to handle these things but he was faithful he understood who that that light it was limited light that was there at that moment but what he appreciated was how that her call was for a real Holy Ghost life and that's what he think God for he went there to her two men brother Brent says I got many of her tapes and books in my office and he also think of standing there it might be Azusa Jubilee brother brems stands there and he talks about her I said I stood and aim is simple Macpherson's office before coming out here and I think God for such a life he goes on he speaks of gallant soldiers that have went on brother Bram stands up at a prayer breakfast and he stands there he says thank God for all of these veterans that are in here because if they hadn't went and laid the groundwork we would not be where we are today and I'm telling you this let me just put it to you like this I thought of this I'm sitting there I'm thinking here it is fifty three we're standing fifty three years later after God has taken home his prophet there's things he wanted to see but he knew would come to pass so I want to hope I'm alive to see her put on those robes of Resurrection I hope I'm alive to see that revival moving in the church we know it was starting right then he was he was desiring that even to where he would make the statements an indictment I'm praying and he said it's not hard to pray this because it's a promise in God's Word that also is a point a promise in God's Word is something there resonates in the heart of us as believers that we pray for the fulfillment of that promise I really believe if we spent more time praying on the fulfillment of God's promise instead of so much about our needs I believe the presence of God would accompany our lives more to give us grace to go through our needs I really believe that I'm a witness and I believe you are too how many times that God has ministered to your knee tore my knee and I wasn't even praying about my knee I was praying about somebody else it's a body you can't figure that out that's God God put it that way oh my men they did not die in vain my that's where I think of men that have gone on before I'm talking about that have carried this message they carried it there's no way that we could be where we are today listen it wasn't their strength but they yielded their strength to God like for the lineal under the inspiration wrote that song now that the title of it slips my mind but the voice of living waters and he catches my inspiration they forsook their houses they forsook their land they've how that God had going because you know not everybody could be a pastor and stay at home sometimes some people have to be apostles somebody has to be the complete fulfillment of go you into all the world and preach the gospel and then there's another part within there when that's when that work is established there God appoints a man to oversee that work are you with me so it's God's working it's it's not man it's God's working I thank God for all those lives you you realize this friends let me just say this to you very personally there's no way on my ministry alone or this church make it it takes the complete five full ministry for me you know where I've stood for years I don't have meetings just to have meetings I don't have people just to have people come through it's a burden on my heart when I got presses upon my heart he knows what it's all about well brother Samuel they might get up and preach the same thing that you already preached that doesn't matter what matters is that our lives are touched and helped that's what matters needs are met god knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing you all okay I'm not gonna try to preach this all in one day there's many multiple things here and I don't have them all in front of me so I wouldn't do that but here we have highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom think of these words that this nation would have a new birth of freedom how can you have a new birth of freedom you remember what he's doing he's going back to the original document what was the original document why why was it that we fled other less listen to me now you see these things are not spoke of in secular world but why was this even that of the of the pilgrims there's many of those things right there people just think oh they got on a boat and they came over you know from England and it was there it was the oppressiveness you know what they were fleeing here for it wasn't for a better land they came here for religious freedom then the land they didn't know what it held as a matter of fact they knew each time the thing that history does not depict in schools is how that they themselves even would have to go into other countries and how multiple times they were caught before ever making it here but the Prophet you know 1965 invisible Union he brought our attention back to this they landed our forefathers landed on Plymouth Rock they landed for that freedom of worship you see listen spirit that Antichrist spirit has been chasing after that dragon that spoke of in the Book of Revelations joke a joke writes of it and so does David calling it xi and it writes of those things all the way down through joggle speak up and metaphorically it's the same demon spirit that even try to swallow up the very birth of Jesus Christ but God's program cannot be defeated it will not be defeated because God can't be defeated God's program is God in flesh [Applause] and we can rights this a new birth of freedom ho ho there's nothing like real freedom outside of a real new birth in Jesus Christ you can join the church and you're still not free but a real new birth how do I receive the Holy Ghost there's a document and there's inspiration that's poured out repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins he who fulfilled the Old Testament releases the life of the New Testament that ties us into the book and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what the document says I just tryin to look at it here a real short a little two to the two and a half minute speech but where it was coming from this he was not just speaking on deriving figures from antiquity and comparing this and comparing this he let it be known what has taken place but this there's a new birth of freedom hallelujah and that government listen is now and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth now I find it interesting that there are five copies of the Gettysburg Address and not one of the original copies is there in Gettysburg they're in different places library Library of Congress and this is where drawing a thought on preserved is striking is that they have taken of the original document in the Library of Congress they have so studied the case the materials because this document they want it to be preserved they don't want no oxidation no discoloring they're interesting in preserving the document so much that they look at the materials the variants of gasses that are in there and so they'll they remove the oxygen and they leave this container this glass so the people can look in there and they can look at the Gettysburg Address they can see it and they say oh it's been preserved but I ask you is that how its preserved is that how it's preserved because the document itself like our Bible or we can bring it our message it can be preserved by glass oxidation and yet it yet it's not preserved because unless this is written on the heart it's not preserved do you realize when you have been born again of the Spirit of God listen to me now they could come in here and demand every one of our Bibles they could demand you turn over your phones your tablet's turn over every one of your books and your tapes but you know what the word has already been wrote on your heart don't get me wrong I don't have to have this nor do I have to read the message or listen to it to be able to live an overcoming life but I do need it because it is the light of the hour and God has inspired it just as those who did not have the Bible Abraham job the rest but they knew it by revelation and the Prophet said that's the important thing you with me I'll tell you this right here there's times when over the years you've heard me say it over the years even before it that faster I get on something in order the Lord inspires I listen to a message I don't know how a little over and over a whole ream of message I just keep listening to a listener listen to him listen to him listen to mr. it might go on for months you say why because what I know it's not by my my intellect catching everything I wait on the Holy Spirit to inspire these things and the one thing about and when I look at it I you know for me I may be simple and I know I am but I take things and I hear how the Prophet he'll say certain things in the scriptures he referred to that I know that is not the mind of a man it gives light upon this way like I referred to you last week here he is standing in the message let your light so shine before men and he says this scripture says except you become as a little child he said see what that means is is to forgive like a child there's an offense come and a child they're back playing together again I said oh god help me help us help us Jesus you see you say well specimen that word it it deals with my heart that's what you want you want a water that deals with your heart I don't know how many times I'm standing in the yard repenting driving the clock repent come on somebody because the wire is dealing and it's moving in my life but let me tell you something thank God there is something that brings you and I to a reality that we can look at us at home what is it he's breaking amnesia away from our lives who else could do that but the Living God he's got a channel and he has visited us or glory if it's not preserved in the hearts of the people that all we have is a historical document a memorial of a historical speech given at a historical event by a historical figure or president whereby we have no connection nor true understanding of its meaning to us or our lives in other words we don't know who we are never was a time think of this time right here you know Scofield refers Scofield refers the term that Scofield uses for tribulation is anarchy and then incredible think of what we're living in this time I'd venture to say that our country has probably never been more divided than any I'm not here on a political stump speech I'm bringing this into the scriptures to show you these things are identified with this you don't know who you are and this our people it's an absolute I think of it like this it would be hard for us to get people to go fight in the army to go fight for the United States of America you know why people so despise being an American now I can't speak for them out there but I can refer you to how well it's again coming back to the character the Prophet could stand and say here in many places he says she's rotten to her core she's had the word ministered to her she had a time to accept it and in 1956 she turned it down you look on your computers Google it up look at the effects of things after in 1956 look at divorce rates look at all these things you say well what does that have to do with it it has everything to do with it you cannot walk away from God and remain the same but this is the things that happen but the brown refers to where when men would come with the ministering of the word I'm going to come down here the ministering of the word and after a messenger would go forth he said he'd start seeing things where people's lives he said they would come to church to have a great emotional time but he says when they leave are they living in it and walking to walk in it means that your life our lives are regulated by it that this is an absolute in our lives it's an absolute but it says no doubt when John was writing these things in first John John seen these things and he says what happens he says he says it like like this to where but that Antichrist spirit comes in and it comes in under cover it comes in a reason and human understanding and he says he's calling the people get back to Pentecost the real true experience but as usual there's an if he's in church you know some of you familiar with this you as usual people don't heed God's warning for someone not to heed God's warning they have to have some sort of a security or at least a sense of security to not heat it I'll tell you in this ours we said moments ago we want the word to deal with the hearts there is no security outside of the Lord Jesus Christ this is our place of refuge in him and this high priest he ever liveth we ain't never going out of this city a matter of fact we're gonna be raptured in this astronaut our high priest the Lord Jesus Christ he paid the price that revival fire notice he says it's built upon the sacred word so wonderful look at this it's built upon the sacred word so wonderful and the manifestation of the spirits so blessed that a little fear creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on but you see when God sends the messenger he sends the messenger and he sends the message and he has children on earth that he has already equipped with the ability to hear and he is the one who plants the word in our hearts he is the one who calls us to himself he is the one who fulfills the word that is spoken and brings it into manifestation in our lives it is him no flesh can glory in his presence and brother Branham laid that so clear and at dinner bed with Jesus Christ in 1964 he said people have had the wrong slant on prophets they think it is the prophets doing that he said it was not the prophets it was God in the prophets he said their flesh cannot glory no more than the flesh of Jesus Christ can glory for Jesus himself said the side can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father doing see it shows there has to be eyes a channel a vision that's all pan that you can see what the father is doing the father was doing something he was doing a mark ass work in their day and yet the Pharisees looked at it and said you're Beelzebub are we talking about the same document oh yeah we're talk about the same document really Jesus stood there before him What did he say in John 5 he said I'm not the one who's accusing you Moses is accusing you they were faithful followers of Moses listen to me now I'm not gonna dwell on this point they were so faithful that even among themselves they had their own sex SCCT divisions are you with me I'm not just Pharisees and Sadducees I'm talking about even among the Pharisees see there's nothing can unify outside of the revelation of Jesus Christ and that is what our focus is to be upon I'll say it very clearly there's gonna be things until God - we're raptured out here they're gonna be little ideas things you might feel a certain way a certain brother feels a certain way or this or that or one or more you know what it's it's in God's hands just as much as I'm trusting God if there's wrinkles in me to iron them out God we're in that I'm not responsible Oh I'm responsible for is to give myself to God like you are I said it before if I have an idea that where I'm going to preach there might possibly this might disturb somebody I will wear white and I'll wear it with all humility because you know why I don't care I don't care if I've got to wear polka dots I just want to serve his people if it bothers people that I wear a suit than it has a vest although saying I wouldn't know I'm not interested in that I don't want to hinder the word from reaching its mark that's a whole separate thought that's also part of being preserved I'm thankful God's dealing with our lives aren't you I'm thankful he brings these things really to the forefront of what the focus is hmmm that little fear comes in how do we keep this how do we preserve this because back to this point that though we could preserve all of these words and I think God hey I thank God for the battles it's been fun I think God for the laboring of all the brothers where they've transcribed and so forth the message I think God for their I think God that I've got on my phone I think God for them I know it was a brother that did that and I think that brother for doing that and dedicating all those things and just doing it he didn't even ask for money he just dedicated it I think God for that I look at those little things you know what I look at these are not just it we will give an account for it but I look at it what things have been provided to us what tools what different things let me move to this I'm gonna we're close and we'll pick it up here so the font how do we preserve well it's God who sent it it's God who watches over it it's God who keep it now very clear as the Prophet would would bring this in these places of how that you would have let me just skip this come down into this place my if I can get there you are still okay I'm getting there and just to think I didn't include everything in The Book of Revelations chapter 5 it speaks that there is a lamb and it the book of Revelation is filled with symbols just give me your attention for about five more minutes these symbols are symbols that are only interpreted by an angel revelations one an angel lowercase he is sent to John notice this messenger was not even though it's to all but had come with a specific one in mind to declare to John those things which must shortly come to pass seeing God's time for you and I have 2000 years but in God's time but how do we preserve that the Bible speaks of the lamb and the lamb having seven horns and it speaks in this manner here's the lamb lamb a type that of the Lord Jesus Christ our Passover lamb that perfect sacrifice he not that is offered up now but remember the time that we're living in it points back to the true atonement the Lamb that has already been offered you with me in Leviticus 23 I know some will be some won't be but what I'm saying is that now is is not an introducing of a new gospel it is declaring the true atonement the true Passover lamb the true token that was offered back there in redemptive work and it unveils all of these things all the way on down and the Prophet picks picks this out and he says those seven horns is how the lamb protects his rights his rights he protects his rights the Prophet says it like this that's the lambs protection those horns what he protected his rights with on earth was a god-sent group of people that's protected so he's protecting his right how is he protecting his rights by a god-sent group of people not by having a document out here but by that being in here for as he said through Paul Paul said that the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained therein what a ministry that xcellent there was it written in stone on Mount Sonia but now God was letting it be known there he didn't come and write it in stone enough he wrote it in the heart of flesh he came and pressed his own image forth in our life and let me say this this preserving this preserving you realize listen to me now in closing you can come to this church you can come here under the canopy and presence of this message that is preached in this hour you can come under under all of that but remember the preserving of it it must be in your heart because if it's not in your heart there will be a trial there will be a test there will be an offense that will arrive there will be something that will arise that will take what you thought to be a new birth of freedom and it really not a new birth of freedom but a new birth of freedom is where the document oh it's not preserved in pressurised glass in Washington it's sealed in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people who won't even read the Bible and come and look at the document but yet the document is on display in you you are God's looking-glass Alleluia they're seeing this Liberty in your life what is this this is God's way of preserving his word because he said in the book of Jude will I find faith if it was up to me or you our strength no but it's him it is him that worketh to perform his away so he will find faith because it is not our faith it is his faith the life that I now live I now live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me and he what he did he sent a messenger to me with a message specifically for me to let me know I was there included in the automa I was there in God's mind before the foundation the world where men have drifted from the document where men have despised it and they were going to bid on it for pity's but God came down in this hour and he picked up the constitution of his word and he put his hair and begins to take the ball and he began to play the symphony the divine orchestration what was looked at has just some other piece they were auctioning off pieces of it God don't move the same way y'all don't give the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is so much women dressed this way men all these are being auctioned off but God said I'll take that oh this is more than four score and seven years ago from eternity I loved you I had you in my mind my thoughts we're all about you you've always been the apple of my great songs I have even inspiration I've poured out your name has always been here and now my presence is here to remove doubt you are mine you are mine I have taken you to myself I preserved you as my workmanship and my word is sealed in your heart my rights of movement the flow of the Holy Spirit the gifts all of those things my rights I have protected in your heart I'd say Oh God Oh God my hands up to heaven in my heart let me give him her dying breath let me give everything I've got me lay aside lay aside differences give everything we've got for this final charge this lap this finish line give everything that we've got for this last moment this short quick word preserved in his presence a new birth of freedom a Liberty pardon me but I feel like general Armistead from there of Northern Virginia and he took his hat and rammed that sword up and he looked around at them boys they knew they were heading to their death but these words is what rung in my heart and I believe to be so fitting for our lives he said men think about your homes this day think about your sweethearts this day think about your children this day think about this and I say with all of my heart let us think about our families let us think about how God Himself has brought forth this word let us be focused on the rapture let us be focused on him with all my heart but the Brian would you come please sing that I pledge allegiance to the lamb if you haven't pledged allegiance to the lamb this morning this would be a good time be a real good time if he spoke to your heart and dealt with your heart and you might realize brother Simon hunter I get this battle to stop at this battle of the Battle of where within me these desires he already won the war you may not be aware that that that your battle has already he's already won the war but I stand here as a forced support excuse but I'm a spokesman for him to let you know this battle is already over and you can walk you can walk free you can have a new birth of freedom you can walk in deliverance you can let the change be the chains of the past you might look at your life and say I've been a failure at this I've been a failure at that but you can let that be a hasp in this morning in his presence he can raise you into a newness of life to where it's a real preserve don't you love gonna be to God hallelujah [Music] see Brian you would like prayer this morning we'd be glad to pray with you if you'd like to stand I know you've been sitting a while let's worship Him and whatever your need is if you want you're at that point so how I want to give my life to the Lord completely I don't know where you're at this morning God does but I want to give that opportunity because I don't know there might be somebody here that does not know that real Liberty I don't want you just to be associated with the church cuz I don't get that data fail then that'll get all the cares of life will wear you down but I'm interested and that's you're in Jesus Christ where you go to church where God places you that's between you and him that ain't nothing to do with me but I'm interested in your getting in Jesus Christ that's you and know this Liberty because if you know this Liberty then he can place you where he wants you and that Liberty is still sing to the brain [Music] Christian's brought before tyrant Stroh they were told that he would smell if they would renounce aim of price they chose to die
