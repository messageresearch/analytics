see it manifested when this mortal puts on immortality this corruption shall put on incorruptible do you believe that amen i hope that's more than just a fairy tale to you today we talk about it we sing about it but it's gonna happen amen it's not gonna happen for everybody but there's people with a faith a rapturing faith it was laying in the messages but it's been transferred today amen well hallelujah appraisal we're gonna have church it's no longer just in the messages amen but i believe when that mighty angel come down and he gave that book john said i'm gonna take the book i'm going to take this message i'm going to run with it i'm going to eat it i'm going to let it speak out of my life amen that's why we're here today amen i hope that's why you're here today i hope we didn't just come to be seen and heard of men we just come to be entertained we come because we believe these bodies these pest houses that we've had to contend with from the moment we were born we will have to contend with them no longer hallelujah praise god we're just so grateful to be with you here man i i just i feel good i want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ god bless you richly good to see each one that could be here today um i guess we'll just go ahead and go straight to the scripture here i was going to say i don't want to prolong the time but i probably will when i preach anyway so we might just get into the word amen that's why becomes the word amen and the word is not just a dead letter to us it comes with power the kingdom of god is not in word only but in power if you have your bibles we're going to be looking into uh i don't know where i'm looking into st john the second chapter i had a book marked i opened to it i'm like is this the right place i'm looking at the wrong page it's not a very good excuse is it saint john the second chapter we're actually gonna look here in a couple different scriptures uh st john chapter two and then i'll also have you turn to the 69th psalm this morning as well and uh why you just standing there with your bibles opens up let's go ahead and bow our heads for word of prayer amen heavenly father we are so grateful lord to think of this great event which is not just impending but which has already begun in our lives the coming of the lord jesus christ lord of people that are they're being caught up by revelation into heavenly places even today under the sounding of the voice of god lord we believe this same word which we have heard which we've believed will one day quicken these bodies lord it's already bringing them subjects to the word by your holy spirit and lord we just ask now we invite you to come and minister in a special way lord help me as a man to move out of the way father because i i am i am keenly aware even now that i am unable to meet the needs and the desires that you have for these people but i just ask oh god you take my lips like you did the prophet isaiah lord allow me to speak to this people may you purge us with a coal and with fire lord that we could say what you'd have us to say lord that we could present ourselves not just me as a minister today but each one of us can lift our hands and present ourselves like that prophet and say here am i oh lord send me lord wherever you'd have me to go to my to my church to my home to my family whatever you would have for me lord hear am i oh lord i present myself a living sacrifice to you which is my reasonable service lord have your way in my life here am i oh god send me lord i'm willing to go if you'll send me o god i'm willing to go wherever you go with me father lord i believe today just come and bless the word in a mighty way may come and speak that which is needful father not that which we desire after our own flesh lord so many times in my life i i had a desire and an ambition within myself but lord your spirit come and you took those things out of me lord that warned of you lord my desire my ambition today is just to be a prisoner to the word and will of jesus christ lord make that the chiefest desire in each of our hearts today we pray we commit this service now our lives our souls into your loving hands as a faithful creator we ask these things in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ and the church says amen saint john the second chapter let's read verses 13 to 17 here and uh we'll just start here let's see verse 13. amen and then like i said we'll also go over to the 69th psalm here in just a moment saint john 2 13 says in the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and dubs and the changes of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the ox and poured over the changers money and over through the tables and he said unto them that salt doves take these things hence make not my father's house and house of merchandise and the 17th verse is why we're going to turn another place in a second it says and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house has eaten me up amen if you turn me to the 69th psalm we're going to look there this morning as well at the scripture that they were reminded of and then i'll have you be seated here psalm 69 we'll start in verse 6 and read down to verse 9 and this is the psalm of david he says let not them that wait on thee oh lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face i am become a stranger unto my brethren notice who he's a stranger to amen and an alien until my mother's children why for the zeal of thine house hath eat me up and the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me may the lord bless the reading which words are seated i told myself i was gonna try and keep my jacket on a little bit today and be prim and proper and i've already decided that was a tactical error so we're done amen i want to speak about this thought this morning and into this afternoon the zeal of this house amen and i think it's very interesting we uh we're all familiar with this scripture of course jesus in the temple and the money changers and him going in and actually if you look at the timetable of it in the scriptures i believe it happens twice once at the beginning of his ministry and once near the very end of his ministry and it's interesting like i said you look at this and it's a very portrait of a religious gathering amen because we understand that satan he is not a creator amen and don't ever let him tell you that he is a creator sometimes he'll try to convince you that he's just you know he's got things a certain way and he's engineered satan's eden to where nobody can make it out but listen he's doing the same thing he's done for thousands of years because he can't do anything different i mean he has no new strategy his strategies unbelief to get you to walk away from the word of god just like he did back at the beginning he's got the same strategy today and god has got the same strategy if you believe my word and you receive my word you will live amen it's just that simple and then we try to complicate it sometimes we try to make it about the gathering or this or that but i want to encourage you today wherever you're at if you believe this message and you believe this word of god and you're holding fast to it it's holding fast to you you have no reason to fear today no matter what diseases rise up no matter what happens to the dollar in the economy or everything else we have a place a resting place today amen we're not shaken with the world we find a place of rest hallelujah we have received a kingdom which cannot be moved and don't ever let the devil tell you otherwise he's the one that's got a reason to be shook up listen that's why he's doing what he's doing today he knows he's got a short time he won't tell you that but the bible has testified his days are numbered but for you and i our time we're just rising up our moments just begun amen we look at the religious world today and it's a very portrait just like here in the scripture it's a religious gathering amen satan is just trying to imitate the plan of god he's got nothing to claim the originality amen he looks at the works of god and he wants to imitate it and that's all he can do amen you've got a group of people here and they are observing in the scripture that we read they're observing the passover amen now all these pharisees and these scribes and these jews they're observing the passover and yet the passover himself is right there and they missed it amen praise the lord they were going about their business their business in the in the house of god but yet jesus was about his father's business amen so they're all doing the same thing they're just doing it for two different kinds of masters amen here's a group of people and the bible testified they were zealous for their traditions they were zealous for their religions but jesus was jealous that day too when she just walked in there and he saw the corruption and the pollution of it the zeal this house began to eat him up to where he he took this scourge and he fashioned this and he drove it out of the house amen that's the very same thing today and brother man talks about this he says this in the manifestation of the spirit he says the same people that believed in god i want you to really think about this for a moment now they believed in god and were zealous of god killed jesus amen paul would testify later years later what would he testify they were zealous but not after knowledge amen they were zealous after their own righteousness being ignorant of god's righteousness they would not submit to god and so it is the book of galatians tells us in the fourth chapter that the natural always persecutes the spiritual it's always been that way and brothers and sisters let me just say it's always going to be that way until we leave here so if you're uncomfortable with it now you better buckle in amen because people aren't just gonna love you tomorrow they're gonna say all the message people they're just such a blessing they're just such a wonderful group of people we just love them if you're hated today for his sake i'm not talking about because you did somebody dirty in a deal somewhere i'm not talking because you won't do your job at work if you're hated for his sake today you're going to be hated for his sake tomorrow you're going to be hated next week you're always going to be hated for his sake okay man but you and i we can rejoice let them disciples when they were cast in prison when they were beat up and they walked out and the pharisees said we can't hold them in what we got to let them go but don't you preach in that name anymore they walk that knot with their heads hung low they didn't walk out defeated well praise god i don't know what we're gonna do we're just being so persecuted nobody likes us they walked that rejoicing but they were accounted worthy to suffer for his name and say hey man they were mad like david said they were estranging their own brethren the very people that should have received them jesus in the temple the very passover doing the father's business the very ones that should have received them were the very ones that rejected them they're the most holy city they're the most holy people crucified the most horrible death him the most holy one man it's one thing when you get a you know you look at the newspaper you look over all these people they're persecuting the church when's your own brother in doing it what's your own people doing that's where it hurts hey man hallelujah my my brother says this in the seven church age book and the latest in church agent says this it says now this false church has a zeal amen make no mistake about it amen well man they're just so zealous yeah what are the zealous for the jews were zealous too oh praise the lord i hope i'm not talking about you all now you can get excited about this i'm not talking about yourself but the false church has a zeal too he says this it is her zeal has literally been that of the jews john 2 17 the zeal of thine house has eaten up but it is a wrong zeal it is for the house of their own building it is for their own creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put out he says they have put the word out for their own ideas they deposed the holy ghost and made men leaders now there's been a lot of talk about insurrection lately amen and we put this in the news and the insurrection washington this and that you can think what you want either way but what i'm saying is this what is insurrection it's not that they politely ask jesus and then they deposed him the holy ghost amen the bible says they deposed the holy ghost in other words they didn't ask him politely hey can you not come back to him on the midweek service this is the last service we want you around they didn't just gently say listen we voted about it and we just uh we just don't really want what you've got and we we've would like to kindly ask you if you just kind of quit showing up to church no it says they deposed the holy ghost amen they took up arms and they run him out by force out of his own church of his own workmanship on his own building they run him out with violets they shoved him out and now he's on the outside of the ladder to see in church knocking on the door trying to get back in [Music] he didn't shut the door he didn't run himself out they run him out let's not run him on though let's buy them if we're going to invite him let's make him welcome go ahead and praise him amen we want to be welcome here we're not trying to run him out we're trying to run into him there's one place the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and i say praise the lord hallelujah my my he says they have put aside amen eternal life as a person you should think about that for a second that's what they did there they do it with well i listen to the tapes i was in the prophet's meetings oh i can quote every quote listen the pharisees could quote the scripture better than i can amen jesus said you search those scriptures you think you've got life in those scriptures i'm the one they testify see they've missed the eternal life is not a doctrine it's not just a cree it's a person jesus christ and the person is what they like they've got all the right kinds of doctrines they've got good ideas they've got the right kind of order but the person is missing hallelujah they make it good works or even church conformity well praise lord we're gonna bring right down now we're not just talking about the baptist today we're not just talking about the good old methodist church well we look the right way we dress the right way we do this that who is the person of jesus christ is the token on display in your lives it's got to be more than just your outward the tokens got to be on display i mean i didn't come here today hopefully you didn't come in today to display my outfit my ability and my personality i come to display jesus christ you come today to display that jesus christ is you the same yesterday today and forever he says god is calling for another zeal that's the zeal i'm going to preach about another zeal i don't want to just preach about zeal i want to preach about another zeal hey man it is the zeal to cry i am wrong oh man i thought that's where we get excited hey i'm wrong we don't get excited about that one do we i am wrong now who is going to say that i'm going to ask you who's going to say that give me a couple hands here hey man listen that's a real tall question hey mean we can find somebody who's right everybody's right amen you can find every kind of podcast every kind of youtube video everybody's right everybody's an expert you can find somebody that'll say it the way you want amen we've so taylor made our ideas and our education our media to where somebody someone will say what you want to say no matter how outlandish it is no matter how ridiculous it is amen everybody's right it's not hard to find somebody that's right or at least thinks they're right everybody thinks they're right that don't make you special you say well i believe the word of god i do this i'm right everybody says that nobody's sister goes well i'm just wrong all the time except the believer they realize i'm wrong but god is right every day when i get out of bed every night when i lay down my idea is wrong my leadership's wrong my thoughts my ambitions they've got to die not just when i first get saved [Music] hey man we've got to die every day listen a lot of people get to the altar and feel bad about but who can live in a state where they're on a cross day after day after day and say you know what i'm still wrong he's still right i want to see the zeal of the lord you get you found out how wrong you are amen you you get broke up and say you know what it's not about me it was never about me it wasn't about my righteousness it's his righteousness his ability his discernment his wisdom his power in the church [Applause] hallelujah amen everybody's right living in the book of judges of the rest about everybody's writing their own eyes amen i don't listen they can hold another sermon now i mean they can tell you that they're this and that or they've got their own identity they can identify themselves amen outside of even natural science and biology and this that they've got their own ideas and if you don't like it you're in trouble because they're right everybody's right about what they think amen well hallelujah christ is always right listen let me let me just say this there's something more important than being right because you can be right for the wrong reasons amen well you you can know that two plus two is four and misuse that amen it's something more than christ just being right he is righteous and then i i don't wanna just be right i don't wanna argue with people and be right about what i think and write about what i say i want to be righteous by the righteousness which only comes from almighty god listen when jesus made the call in this hour he said be zealous and repent amen i want you to think about this how did that come to pass the scripture tells you he stands at the door and knocked the very next thing amen these also repent and he says behold i stand at the door and knock he said if a man would hear my voice hallelujah if anybody here's my voice let him open the door and i'll come in that's striking to me because he says i'm knocking at the door if you hear my voice something where did he speak i thought he was knocking he didn't say hello in there like he's knocking so where'd he speak but the prophet tells us in the in the in the seventh in the seventh seal that there's seven straight thunder he says they're one right in a row one two three it begins to knock on the pulpit and i was listening that one and it struck me these seven unknown thunders the prophet said that's what weakens up the bride amen when you realize these thunder's coming out it's god knocking at your heart god trying to get back into his church hey man there's more than just a man some hillbilly some evangelist knocking at a pulpit but these seven thunders come to wake up a bride why is he waking you up so you let him come in open up the door get out of bed let me come in i mean it's time to quit laying around it's time to quit feeling sorry for yourself and just moping around bed and feeling all depressed wake up you arise you shine your light has come now's the time to get up now's the time to fight now's the time to hold hallelujah we sit around get beat up too much church hey man come on somebody help me out here we get beat up all the time we let the devil push us around and bullies around he ain't pushing christ out of here amen he might have pushed him out of the church he might have pushed him on a man's ideas but don't let him push him out of your heart he said i don't care what the world says i don't care what the rest of the church says that's for me and my house we're gonna serve the lord i'm gonna give him a place i want him to come in and give me hallelujah listen he didn't show up tonight knocking at the door to pay you a social call come on someone he's not here to flirt with you tonight he's not looking to give you a visitation he wants you to be the habitation of the living god a temple of the holy ghost he wants to sit down in your house he wants to break bread in your house he wants to commute in your house see the world looks at these sevens thunders it looks at that prophet it looks at these tapes you know what it just sees another man well you know we had a great healing ministry but it kind of just went off that's what they say amen that's what they see they can't see what actually took place amen it's just a bunch of this and that not listen it's the same thing that happened saint john the 12th chapter amen saint john chapter 12 jesus speaking there they said father you come and glorify your name and this great cloud overshadowed them amen they said i'll have glorified it he says i'm going to glorify it again amen and the bible says that those that stood by they said well it was just a sound of thunder oh just the angels speaking they've done the same thing today in this message well i believe that god sent a prophet yeah that's the angel speaking amen but did you recognize the voice behind the voice we believe in them seven thunders yeah but have you recognized the one that spoke and then we if who believes in seventh hundreds we all raise our hand amen they can do that other places and not even have god married two and three four times and this and that and all kinds of nonsense in their church that don't make you special but to recognize the voice and jesus said this voice didn't come from my sake the voice came for your sake and then will you bring him god did not send a prophet to this generation to exalt the name of william branham and come for your sakes he wouldn't even let that man die for your sake because he had a message to deliver to the people amen that's how much god loves you that's how much god wants you to recognize it was him speaking amen oh my my mind it's the same thing he's done this day the conditions are the same as they we're about then the religious world they're they can talk about listen they know who william branham is even listen to these character preachers they know exactly who he is but they won't bear the reproach of the word they want his blessings they want his gifts they want all this other kind of thing but they don't want to be bought they want to be identified with the reproach of the word amen cause that's their zeal we've got another zeal this bride's got a different kind of zeal than that hey man she's not worried about how popular or how influential or how much money she's got she wants to make sure i'm right with god i don't need to be writing a side of the world i'm going to be right with god amen you look at churches today especially you know you're more charismatic churches and things and they're all crying out for revival they're praying for revival yeah brother talk about them doing the same thing we're going to have a revival we're waiting for revival we're going to have revival hey man now let's sit there and have a meeting say oh yeah we're having a revival they were having revival and then they said they're waiting on i'm so confused you either got it or you don't amen listen they're saying they've got revival oh this pentecostal church we're having revival and the next moment we're waiting for god to send revival and i'm sitting there scratching my head because that only makes sense to me amen listen their own words testify against them if they need revival that means they're dead you don't revive something that's alive you revive something that's dead amen they're dead while they're yet limited twice dead up their fruit withered they've got no fruit but this bride she has already been revived quickening power has come and made her don't manifest to her listen you've got as much revival today as you want because god's giving you as much as you can handle not even waiting to parcel it out and ration it out and one day i'll give you a little more revival for the you can have as much god today as you want you're gonna have as much of god in your life as you can as you can surrender to today listen he wants you to have it more than you want it it's his pleasure to give it to you quit acting like god some sort of pauper and he's just don't you know porcelain out little bits and this and that you're some sort of we're not beggars we are not beggars we're not even servants we're not even subjects we are sons and daughters of god we're eating at the masters table we don't need to eat crumbs today amen those days are over we're done eating crumbs we've been made to sit down in heavenly places with christ jesus [Applause] [Music] they missed it amen that's what it is brother said they missed it but listen quickening power testified what brother i'm saying the rising of the sun quickening power testified to us what that's our lord up there that cloud that came over jesus they just thought was an angel they thought it was thunder what was god almighty and in this day when science took pictures of it and then it's in magazines and they try to explain it away and try to scientifically prove that which cannot scientifically exist but what brother said they're just not looking at the right way you turn this way you look at the right way that's our lord up there god has come down again in a cloud more than an angel more than a messenger it was god speaking to us he glorified his name and in this generation in this hour he has glorified his name again because the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god when he glorifies amen in you and i he didn't glorify in a building he didn't glorify an organization oh hallelujah it's him up there 1963 testifying jesus christ is the same yeah not just in william branham's life not just 30 years ago today in 2021 in the midst of the greatest darkness and the greatest deception and the greatest battles you've ever gone through in your life he is still the same yesterday today and forever christ's been put out by the church someone let him in i got a witness somebody let him in somebody let him come in he's not on the outside of the house when you're doing this i'm thinking don't most people live in their own home hey man praise the lord listen he's not just filling out the paperwork for you he's not just sitting there and proxy for somebody else this is his dwelling place this is his permanent residency he don't need to file a change of address he don't need to update his details everything's accurate exactly what this bible said it's who he is it's who he is amen hallelujah brother bram says this he says remember jesus said when he was here on the earth talking to a bunch of people who was very religious very fine very cultured a very zealous people of god but jesus said to them in vain you worship me teaching for doctrine their traditions of man remember how pious those people was and how zealous of god he says i believe who were counting the people who were more zealous today or that day they would be more zealous than we are well that's pretty humbling isn't it he says far more when it comes to keeping the traditions and the laws and things they live by though they sure did they actually live what they believe they just believed wrong they were sincere but they were sincerely wrong amen he says and they were very zealous of god and they believed god but jesus made god made flesh among us sit in vain do you worship me he says now he didn't say they didn't worship him they are worshipping him but in vain amen amen i want you to really watch this for a second here these jews in this temple they're very zealous for their traditions they've got zeal and jesus has seals they're about their business he's about his own the father's business amen they're observing the passover he is the passover amen they've got zeal but when jesus had zeal when he began to manifest his zeal the disciples took note of him they said they remembered it was written in other words the zeal in jesus's life testified to the scripture amen that's a lot of people were zealous over a lot they get zealous at ball games they consult pep rallies and everything else amen but when they saw jesus zeal it reminded them of the word in other words jesus's zeal was identified by the scripture and this bride she's got another kind of zeal it's identified by the word and then she can jump she can shout but more than that she can live it there's a life inside of her that can perform the will of god that will obey every word in this bible [Music] listen jesus wasn't just another zealous man there's a lot of zealous men in the temple that day amen but he wasn't just a zealous man the bible said he was eating up with it it consumed him it had devoured him amen hallelujah i looked that word up here i'm like what's that mean in the greek you know what eaten up means it means eating up means exactly what it says in other words it consumed everything within him it began to gnaw on him and it aided him and devoured him because he couldn't hold his peace no more jesus couldn't sit there and hold his peace any longer he had to do something about it that was the zeal in his life amen you get that kind of zeal you can't sit still something in you've got to do something for the kingdom of god you look at this man saul of tarsus who would later become known as the apostle paul listen he tells you when he was a pharisee he said he was exceeding zealous in other words their results i was even more zealous he said brother ben talks about the scripture here in galatians 1 uh 14 he's talking about this in the adoption series he quotes paul he says i profited in the jewish religion above many minor equals in my no nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of their fathers number of them says now remember not the word of god the traditions of the fathers traditions of the church in other words i guess i was a methodist to the core i was a baptist to the core i was a pentecostal to the core brother graham says oh where are you i want to be god to the core hallelujah yeah he says that's it hey man i hope you know what i'm talking about amen you talk to some people man especially politics the way it is well i've been a lifelong democrat i'm a lifelong republican i'm a libertarian i'm this i'm that maybe somebody in the green party i guess i don't know we still do that well i'm a lifelong i'm the i'm this to the car i'm i'm listening to the car i just want to be god of the core i'm going to be the best american i might not be the best this or that oh if i got nothing else in my life to look at god i want you to be the very center in the core of my life i want to be god to the core inside it out and all the way through from the crown of my head to the souls of my feet let it testify for the resurrected jesus christ in my life oh my hallelujah i tell you what praise the lord amen some people i i don't want to be jealous for my own tradition i don't want to be sad some people are very us in the church for their idea i mean they'll let you know they'll go to the pastor i got an idea for the church they'll go to the deacons they'll go to the song leader they'll go to the sound guy i know i do we should do this in the church we should do that in the church well i hope you're that zealous about jesus as you are your own ideas i mean i think we should do things this way and i think we should do things that way well can you still love your brother even if you don't want to do it your way amen praise the lord that's the truth anyhow amen listen paul paul pratt why was paul so zealous that's what i really want to come to for a moment here amen why was the apostle paul and they said this was saul of tarsus why was he so zealous as a jew he tells you why because it profited him i tell you what you get a good paying job you'll be zealous for that job you'll show up and you'll make the boss happy and you'll clock in on time you'll clock out a little later and you just make everybody tell you what money makes a lot of people jealous hey man they think they find a scratch off on the ground with the right numbers they get zealous they get excited amen some people are like that with church well i've got a position i've got this and i've got a lot of prophets in that's why they're excited about it i'm real excited about taking the cross up to calvary not real excited about getting persecuted oh i profited him he said well you don't gotta get quiet i mean i'm talking about you hopefully man listen he told you it's the same thing with the jews he said they profited by their religion that's why they were so zesty it's not special oh my you know i made fifty thousand dollars this week oh praise god he praise god when you lose fifty thousand right oh man well i knew it was gonna get kind of let's get a little tight in here amen listen this man saw tarsus he was a pharisee the pharisees concerning the law he was blameless circumcised on the eighth day saturn to gamalia uh just just uh hallelujah he was just a pinnacle very echelon of what the jewish religion could produce and so much that he persecuted the church he said but those things that were gained to me yeah i was jealous they were game to me gained to me i counted them loss for the excellence if there's another deal right there when you're willing to lose to getting christ no matter what does your reputation no matter what does your name or your fame or your influence i'll do anything i'll pay any price i'll lay down every advantage i'll throw away every game that i might have jesus christ i've got to suffer if i've got to bleed if i've got to be hated for his name let me have jesus you can take this whole world but give me jesus it doesn't matter what else comes along whatever let me have jesus or let me die let me perish [Music] this is really good i had to think about this for a while this is good these men were zealous they were zealous so when jesus come and upended them and took away what profited them we took away what benefited them these men that were zealous became jealous why were they so jealous of jesus because they were zealous for gain jesus wasn't going to let them get away with that so they become jealous because they were zealous for what profited them listen that's no different than the sinner of the publican hallelujah see jesus represented everything that would that would cost them their benefit he was a threat to everything that they stood for and that they believed in listen these men in the temple they weren't just going to church to have a good time this was their livelihood oh help me out now their whole life was caught up in this religion they weren't just walking away from a church they were walking from an entire lifestyle an entire income everything that i had was wrapped up in this and jesus represented an existential threat to everything that they were and everything that they believed that's why they hate him they were jealous of him because they were zealous for their traditions for them listen for them to admit that they were wrong and to a pet would be to forfeit everything they had gained in their life god help us never get to a place where we can't forfeit everything we get so comfortable well that's why i got a good standing at the church i got a good job i'm this and i come from good family if you can't lay that down for jesus christ you're of all men most miserable you're in the worst place you can be right because when you try to save your own life you're going to lose it but if you lose your life for this kingdom for this gospel you'll find it amen amen well we still got pharisees today praise the lord hey man we've got scribes and pharisees they love long salutations they love flattering titles they love to have the best seats they love to to to devour widows houses the bible says amen praise the lord listen you got people they won't have nothing to do with churches they can't be the center of attention they don't have nothing to do with church but don't benefit them somehow well i might lose money i might lose fame i might not be popular if that's the only reason you're going you're going for the wrong reason you're not i praise god i hope that listen this house of god i trust that this house of god is not a place where we can come and be seen and heard of men we can come to get some some esteem from a man we come here to submit to god almighty god whatever you have to do in my life let me testify at the end of the day we're unprofitable servants we have done that which was required of us we presented ourselves a living sacrifice it's a reasonable listen we owe him just that much he deserves all the praise he deserves all the glory if you've got to live out of a cardboard box and eat soda crackers and drink breasts while the rest of your life he's still been good to you he still give you more than you deserve now they're shaking up and they're worried here comes jesus we gotta do something about him i mean he's he's threatening our way of life he's actually threatening your whole life you've got to die receive this life amen hallelujah praise the lord i tell you what they hated jesus so much they did every they did everything they could to destroy his influence they sought to undermine him and slander him and tell rumors about him they even they killed him all because of money all because their results for their traditions amen my my you look at a man like saul of tarsus a persecutor of the church blasphemed god that's his own confession he said i was the chief of sinners this man looks so good and he was so styled and so influential and so powerful and so intelligent he said i was a blasphemer in the persecution of the church the very cheapest of sinners but those things which were gained they're not gain to me anymore oh saul of tarsus he met that same light on the road to damascus one day that same way that come down this generation it struck him off his high horse that little sarcastic hook no sideways mouth jew it just went around like it was a big shot it knocked him off his high horse even changed his name called the apostle paul something happened in that man's life things that that every man would count as gain listen think things that were crazy he just laid all that down for nothing he just walked out of the job laid down his title laid down everything because he found something greater now let me let me fix that something greater found him something plucked him like a brand from the fire he wasn't willing to walk away god had to take that out of it god had to get a hold of that man's life said no i've chosen you you are a vessel you're appointed to be a light to the gentiles you're going to suffer you're not going to profit from my name you're you're gonna suffer things for my name is hank so i'm gonna make you an example of the long suffering of god well that's not the example most of us want to be there's a partner that's going into it actually here's ananias i want you to go down there and lay hands on this man i've ordained him to be a prophet i've ordained him to be an apostle i've ordained this man to do this and here's another ass in a vision i don't know about that you sure about that lord yeah you're in a vision aren't you did i stutter that man you might not look at his life and see anything godly in it but god's in that man somewhere god's fixing to do something in his life you'll know it because i'll forfeit everything that used to be dude amen let me say this this way this man was a zealous man as a pharisee but now you look at a converted apostle paul a man that's zealous not after the tradition of his fathers not after the rudiments of a carnal commandment a man that's zealous for the kingdom of god you say i want that kind of zeal i need a greater zeal my life what's the secret it's actually real simple yeah see paul had this kind of zeal a believer will have another kind of a zeal what is it here's the secret the apostle paul was jealous i got an eyebrow there you go hey buddy listen the apostle paul was a jealous man he said what listen he wasn't jealous of another man amen those those chief apostles that walked into the church of corinth they could sit there and boast about their gifts they could boast about their calling and paul said they've got nothing to compare those are messengers of unrighteousness amen he says but i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy he wasn't joseph a man he was a jealous position he was the jealousy of god in him over a bride that's what made him zealous amen he was jealous for god's sake that made himself see when he was carnal he was zealous and it made him jealous but this man had a jealousy for the things of god it made him zealous for the kingdom well holiday i hope somebody gets that hey man the the fervency and the desire in his heart to see to present a chaste bride unto jesus christ was the driving imperative every moment of his life this man can testify i've been shipwrecked i've been beaten i've been hungered i've been thirsted i've done all these things if any man let him boast the man what's the boss i'm gonna glory in my infirmities i've suffered for this church i'm blessed for this church i'm willing to die for this church that's his credentials not the size of his bank account not the power of his influence not his worldwide fame i'm ready to suffer i have suffered i will suffer i'll lay my life down he said i can even wish myself a curse for my brethren's sake that they might be saying woo it's a whole nother kind of zeal isn't it right man zealous amen he was zealous for the people of god hallelujah he was a stranger to his own brethren he bore the reproach of christ there was his zeal you want to see a zeal that's what it looks like amen listen jesus that's the kind of zeal he had they didn't adore him for the zeal he showed that day in the temple they didn't say oh man he just loves god what a wonderful worshiper now they hated him for it and that was the zeal of god on display why because it wasn't a zeal for anything but the house of god the same kind of seal paul had not a natural building not a natural house the house of law of god's habitation his church [Music] praise the lord i'm gonna appreciate anyhow the devil don't like it and i don't care the devil don't like it i like it even more hey man listen i'm not gonna let i'm not talking about this microphone now amen i'm not gonna let the devil shut me up you should let him set you up either he'll talk at you and he'll run his mouth he'll do everything he can to shut you down you get in his face listen jesus didn't back down to the devil he said it is written you've got that today i've got a right to speak the word of god i've got a right to prophesy again the scripture speaks of you and i the scripture is spoken things over your life i'm not here by chance you're not here by some sort of happiness we are upheld by revelation we are guided by prophecy we've been placed by god the devil don't like you you're in a good place you know when you've got the devil sitting up you're in a good place the devil man you better make him mad right now the devil ought to make you mad well i'm gonna get ahead of myself harry man listen it makes jesus mad why because you're his passion you're his desire he knew he was gonna suffer he knew he was gonna die and then he did it anyway because you were his joy the joy that was set before him you're his bride he said i ain't gonna let the devil man handle them anymore you look at isaiah 53 everything christ did who'd he do it for he didn't do it for himself it wasn't gained to him he did it for you that's the zeal of god and the believer today to do something for somebody else because eternal life is living for others it's from life and about how exciting you are or how popular you might be the weakest lowest most insignificant person in the world but to god you're somebody he suffered for you he died for you he rose again for you don't let the devil tell you you ain't worth now that [Applause] you get on the you get on these like online they sell stuff online or whatever and they say i got this paper clip and it's covered in red plastic came in and i want i want five dollars for it i'm like what are you talking about five dollars for that thing he said don't try to talk me down i know what i got well that man don't know what he's got but i know what i got god paid a price for me i can't sell out to the world i can't forfeit this world god paid too great a price for this soul it's worth ten thousand worlds of god what you got in your life it's worth ten thousand worlds to god you're not holiday don't let the devil talk you down i know what i got you know what you have you can't pay any price for what i got amen listen this prophet preached this message he went to preach these seals he said you don't know what it's going to cost me it cost me 10 000 friends a man that was once esteemed around the world preached around the world seven times right everybody wanted him in the rings everybody wanted to see that gift when he started preaching i'm a father of one all right we start preaching jesus christ the same this message the unveiling of this word he knew it was gonna cost him with those things which were gained to him he didn't even esteem it that prophet didn't buy none he'd been paid for a long time ago that man paid a price paul paid a price jesus paid a price that men paid a price and we just think we're gonna skate by i don't think so brother and sister it might cost you everything but my zeal says let me pay it anyway i'll forfeit it all for christ [Applause] well hallelujah i tell you what you hear this all the time well i'm just going to preach in that it might not be real we're all well received but it's the truth anyhow man you hear people all the time well you know i just i just love my church i love going to church i love the people there i love the worship and i love the officers i love my pastor i love the church you don't love the church you love your position you don't love the church you love your ministry you want to know if you love the church how much can you love that lowest least person in the church that person nobody else thinks about that person nobody else pays the attention to if you can love that one that shows you love the church this is the pharisees love one another sinners love one another let me ask somebody how much can you love that one that nobody else wants nothing to do with listen he loved you when you were unlovable he desired you when you were undesirable that's the love of god [Applause] just like a pharisee they just love what they've got oh we got this we got that hey that's all great that's fine nothing against that if you can't love that one you can't lay down your life for that one you missed it amen praise the lord i had a man come to me one time i probably should tell the story but i'm already fixing too though had a man come to me one time he said and i'm gonna cover where i'm not saying this i'm saying this for a reason not to point something myself but this man told me said you know she said i just i really appreciate how you you always think about these people in the church and people in churches that other people forget about and i think he meant it as a compliment but i didn't take it that way praise the lord hey man wow you know you always think well you're supposed to right all right it made me feel good about myself that made me feel bad doesn't everybody do that look i'm not saying that for pretense that's how we're supposed to be i mean listen i didn't you know this morning thank the sun for rising or think the trees were staying their place that's what they're supposed to do that's not common to me yes it is why don't we think that way we all all think that way all right amen listen you've probably heard me tell this story before i'm gonna tell it again when i first got saved i heard the stories it was in a it was a fox book of martyrs talking about saint lawrence he was a deacon i think it was in the church of rome he was a deacon there does anybody know this story well you're fixing to either way this man was a deacon in a church room and emperor valerian summoned him to the throne he said i want your church to pay tribute to me i'm the emperor now i want you to bring me all the riches of your church in three days you return with the riches of your church saint laurent said i'll do as the emperor vince in three days he came back with every lame every blind every deaf person everybody that couldn't even walk he carried and brought them they all come to this at the emperor valerian he brought them before the throne and rome right and everybody was so wrong he was angry says how dare you i'm a powerful man i'll have you killed for this i'm an emperor i told you to bring me the riches of your church [Music] great emperor i have this is the riches of the church this is the riches of christ's purchase see so different than what the world looks at see the emperor's looking for something to gain from it he said listen this is [Music] glory this means something to god more than money more than fame they can't even walk in and bring themselves to church that means something to christ or the making you and me more than making you money he died for that one that you think's nothing that man was insulted by that offering but that was the greatest gift god can reach the lowest the most infirm the weakest the most discarded the outcast that's what makes god so great he's that humble a poor man can't humble himself that low he's already low to begin with this is the greatest the mightiest more than ever the king of kings and the lord of lords he suffered and died for that one he thought it was trash but that was god's great purchase of his blood [Applause] how dare we today sit here and try to exalt ourselves or some other thing that's the present that's the treasure that what nobody thinks about no there's nobody cares about them god cares about them if god's in you god will care about them tell you what listen let me say it this way the zeal of this house you fall in love with jesus you'll fall in love with one another if you fall in love with another one another that z will eat you up it'll make you lose some sleep but not when you're praying for one another it'll make you it'll agonize and bother you it'll keep you up cause something on the inside is burning you i've got to see souls for christ i've got to see a deliverance it's christ in you that's the zeal of this house because the other love one another god is jealous over you with a godly jealousy you're worth more to him than buildings and god and celery and fame you're worth everything to him [Music] listen many of us many of us not all of us we've been hurt somewhere in our lives we get hurt by people at church we get hurt by family we get hurt at a job whatever it is we're going through things and we get hurt we've got problems you know what sometimes it just drives you to your knees sometimes it just breaks you you get to a point where it just eats you up on the inside but if the zeal ever gets inside you one time and it eats you up like that it'll do something in your life more than just make you feel bad and then when the zeal eats you up it'll start keeping you off you'll start driving driving the things out of your life that are not a god this seal won't let you settle it won't let you compromise it won't let you sit idle there's something on the inside of a believer it's got the zeal of this house it's their burning desire it drives them [Music] i'm going to keep pressing on i'm going to keep pushing i'm not going to back down now i'm not going to walk away if nobody else wants to serve god as for me and my house we're still going to serve the lord i've got to keep going listen there's been times brothers i'll be honest with you sisters brothers and sisters there's been times i wanted to give up i wonder what not from god that time about abandoning god but i just want to just want to go lay down and live in a cave and be a hermit just walk away from it all amen but listen the more i tried to hold it back the more it was like a fire shut up inside my bones the more i wanted to quit the more god said you can't quit you didn't start it sometimes i wouldn't give up and says you didn't start you can't lay it down you can't quit i ain't done with you it's not up to you to decide when god's done with you you don't make that call you don't make that decision do you think jesus says a man wants to go in there and fill a bunch of tables over but god inside and said i can't let that stand i won't let that rest my father's house is a house of prayer not a house of merchandise yeah hallelujah the ones in this world aren't gonna toss you around hey man we're gonna go we're gonna keep pressing on because the zeal inside of us is greater than just excitement it's our passion it's our focus it's our drive we'll cut through every enemy we'll burn every bridge we're going to push forward in the name of the lord amen some of you know what i'm talking about i mean your world's just falling apart you ever been there i've been there once or twice your world's just falling apart you just don't know how you're going to go on but guess what you're here today that wasn't you was the zeal of god in your life something inside of you greater than your ability greater than your own human desire has brought you here today some of you might even feel like giving up today you might have woke up this morning said i'm in the most discouraged darkest place i've ever been my life i'm a christian maybe even i'm a christian and i've never felt more discouraged i've never felt more disheartened amen now is not the time to back down now's the time to call god on the scene wake jesus up in the boat say god somebody's gonna fight for this kingdom you've never left yourself without a witness can i tell you about some people in the bible amen listen amen there's a man by the name of elijah we had a prophet the same spirit today that first elijah in the bible he went to mount carmel amen he had a showdown with some prophets of baal amen what did he say when he got up there he goes and hides in a cave he gets so discouraged he stopped to spot some woman chasing him now he begins to call on god and what does the man say god i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts that was his jealousy i've been jealous for you lord i did these things with your word because i've been jealous for the lord of hosts i believe we've had an elijah look at this day i believe our eleazar was not willing to find some some other woman to compromise he had to find that one that would water the camel that would come back and marry isaac because that's the kind god was looking for believe you've got to have a certain kind of testimony amen it's not my testimony it's god's testimony in us we're more than just a good church member we're more than just a good pew warmer god inside of us won't rest until we see the purpose of god fulfilled you take a man by the name of jehu anointed by prophecy he was anointed to say jezebel i think we got something like that here today amen you've been anointed by the prophet to destroy this jezebel system who didn't sit around in question he didn't get out a book and read it and try to study it he got on his chariot he rolled out and he made war on jezebel let me say today i'm declaring war this afternoon on satan i ain't going to rest until i put jezebel on the ground and she's eat up by a bunch of unbelieving dog i can't rest he come by jezebel's son he said oh could you come to make peace with us you know we can all just co-exist together we can live peacefully we can have peace he said there can't be peace while jezebel's boredoms pollute this land there'll be no peace jesus said i didn't come to bring you that kind of peace i've come to bring you a sword he said i don't have nothing to fight the devil with today that's a lie you've got a sword the sword of the kings in your hands you've got what it takes to defeat jezebel you've got what it takes to defeat your flesh you've got what it takes to defeat the devil anytime anywhere under any circumstances look he didn't give you some dulled up rusted old thing amen you've got the sword of the king we know it works because he's used it before his sword is still the same all right he rides over that man says oh let's have pieces and no let's kill you he sticks an arrow right in his chest and he he don't slow down he don't back up he rides right over and keeps going brothers and sisters quit slowing down every time the devil tries to flag you over i'm not trying to stop at some sign somewhere my destination has already been determined i'm going to destroy jezebel and nothing's getting in my way i'm sorry jehu he didn't call out for peace he didn't call for soul strikes listen there's one good way to find peace with your enemy kill him all right never got to worry about him breaking the treaty never got worried about fighting him again you just slam and bury him in a deep deep grave where he never gets up again jay who said i didn't come here for social acceptance i didn't come here to be your friend i come for one purpose i'm gonna throw down jezebel from that hot place i'm gonna throw her down to the dogs he run by that man saying you know what you get up here i said get up on my chariot he said would there be one today i went on the chariot brothers and sisters there's room up here on the chariot today get up on the chair and come and see he said come and see my zeal for the lord of hosts that's the kind of zeal i want you to see today that kind of defeat the enemy what the pharisees had that's he won't defeat the enemy made him a slave that zeal made them slaves to satan this deal in your life will defeat the enemy we're not backing down we're not comfortable we're riding on it this message is my cherish and the word of god is my sword the spirit of god's blowing at my back i've got a tailwind pushing me towards destiny we're going to defeat the enemy we're not going to defeat him by our intellect we're not going to defeat them about being a better class of people the next we're going to defeat them by the holy ghost these bodies we're not going to fix them up we're not going to reform they shall be changed you look at a man by the name of phineas in the bible say that couple that was in that act and god said because of phineas his zeal has been an atonement for the people of israel hallelujah praise the lord oh yeah that's a pretty good kind of zeal to happen man god takes notice all right man this time just make an awesome confession to you here hey man this might not sound popular or politically correct but it's the truth anyhow you know i guess i'm just an angry person by the way he's so angry all the time i got a reason to be hey man i got a reason to be angry i see what the devil does to god's children i see what the devil tries to do in my own life and then we just sit there and we just hope it works out somehow you ought to get mad at the devil every now and then listen shaman got mad one day that's when something happened we sit there and we take it from the enemy we wonder why am i going through this because the sword's sitting on your shelf collecting dust it's time to rise up saints students of god it's time to rise up you're the army of god today it's time to rise up get a little mad with the devil today [Music] yes sir you get mad at some enough you'll do something about it listen you did it plenty of times in the world you get mad enough about something you'll you'll vandalize this or y'all this listen if you did that under a wrong kind of a spirit under the wrath of man what's the righteous indignation of god going to do in your life when satan begins to rise up it's going to do something about it it's not gonna attack your brother his sister's not gonna attack that unsaved one that's gonna attack the devil if you recognize he's the enemy amen listen jesus did something about it he was jealous over the house of god he'd come for a purpose he did something about it amen he didn't run around blowing his top off but he did something with his anger his righteous indignation fulfilled a purpose think about this now every example i just maybe there's other ones i'm not thinking of amen but every example in the bible of a man's zeal on display always ties into him being angry anytime the bible talks about means else it's because he was mad he was fighting mad fighting mad with the enemies of god hey man well holly sound well i'm just not that kind of person listen you man if you've got a wife and some guy comes out here in a white van and tries to hog tie your wife and put her in the van you're gonna sit there and fold your hand and say well i just hope she makes it out somehow well maybe the lord deliver i'll tell you what you'll get on that man's face you'll find him you'll die if he got you to save your wife hey man don't tell me if you feel that way about your wife but feel your love and you can't feel that way about the church of the living god [Music] listen you'll fight the enemy for her you'll stan listen brother brother had that dream one night he saw that woman who said it was like my mom and it was the church that man looked like his dad but the catholic church he was beating him he was beating her down that man was beating that woman down that sweet cut three-sided club amen maybe god will send somebody god did send somebody said elijah he said i i didn't have the strength to fight that much where you're at today i don't have the strength to fight that man i can't do that he said but also muscles grew on me great big faith muscles he had power he didn't know was there you know what he didn't go up to that man of that dream would you please take your hand off her that's not very nice you should stop doing that no he went up to that man he got right in his faces you've got no right to strike her you strike her again you've got to deal with me clear the deal of god today you take your hands off this blind satan you deal with her you gotta go through me first you ain't coming in my home you ain't covering my trick you will have to go over my dead body first [Music] i wanna fight like banana that mighty man in the bible i'm gonna fight till my sword cleaves in my hand i can't even let go of it anymore i'm so used to whipping the enemy if i've got to die let me god kill him satan died defeating the power of the darkness i don't want to die in a bed i'm talking spiritually now i'm not talking about naturally [Applause] let the devil run around i'll die if i gotta die man let me fight satan with everything i've got if i ain't got a tooth left in my body i'll gum him to death please got that wishbone religion still well i wish this works out i wish they'd get safe i wish they'd get him throw out the wishbone i'm so sick of wishbone religion amen we need a backbone get in there and give the devil what's for he ain't scared of you he's scared of the one in you greater is he that's in you he's still greater it's not even close we're just going to edge them out it's not even close god in you is vastly greatly far beyond anything that the devil could ever produce quit acting like the devil's a threat he ain't a threat to you amen hallelujah you get mad enough for the devil you'll do something about it you'll pray for your lost loved ones like you've never prayed before you'll pray for those in need you'll get you'll do more than pray you'll believe yes i was praying let's believe god let's act like we mean it let's take our ox goat or our sword or our jawbone or whatever you got beat the devil down to death don't just take that bone and smite him once or twice you stick every hair you've got in his body amen you left you that magazine and you reload and you keep going you make sure he never gets up again [Applause] he's got no right to strike you i feel that way he's got no right to strike you all right that's why i'll die if i got too i'm not saying that for pretense you can take whatever you want about me it don't matter anyway i will die for this bride of jesus christ i will suffer i'm not i hope this i'll be your testimony now help me out somebody i'm willing to suffer for this bride i'm willing to die for this bride i'm willing to fight you say well god's people they're just not violent that's not what jesus said pilate said well where's your army at why did your servant's fight say well if my servants were of this world they would fight all right that's not what they can't fight or don't just they got to fight the right enemy if they were of this world they would fight let me tell you there's spiritual wickedness in high places we've got weapons that are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds he didn't call you here to negotiate he didn't call you here to compromise let's lay out the enemy [Music] no like i said automate you man make the mess let me try to steal your kids oh yeah if a natural man come and try to take your kids from you you'd do everything in your power to protect that child you'd be right to do it amen but how much more will satan try to come in and steal your prayer life steal your devotion steal your testimony we just let him walk in well hope they make it somehow time to plot the machine gun it's time to gun some enemies down yeah and then i want the devil when he tries to show up my house i want to see a bunch of bodies laying around the property a bunch of heads on spikes man i don't want to go there that's where devils get defeated that's where god whips the enemy i'll go down the street somewhere i'm going in their house [Music] big bulldog out front with a bunch of teeth and a bunch of rocket launchers and everything else i wanted to look at my house and say i ain't going there they got the token i believe a man can so completely serve god hallelujah somebody tell the devil don't know what to do with them [Music] see people there the brother you see these things go in the churches people sell out see people walk away you shouldn't get mad about that you should get mad at them it's wrong for you to be mad at them let's go out to people i'm not mad at them i'm mad at the devil that made him do it i'm not mad at that person listen paul loved them people that hated him hey man i'm not mad at them i'm at the devil see the donuts they'll try to smoke screening well you can't get mad about that that's not right now the bible says be angry that's right let me say this it doesn't say if you be angry says be ye angry and sinnah but don't let the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the don't mess around with the devil if you're mad at him put him out i wouldn't even let the sun go down i wouldn't live one night and defeat i wouldn't lay down my head one night in defeat i said you know what before i go to bed before i lay my head down i'm gonna make sure it's all settled with god i'm gonna make sure it's all settled between me and the enemy i'm laying down and i'm going to rise up again the lord's going to sustain me don't give place to the devil listen if you and i are not willing to stand up for the truth i'm not just talking about the letter i'm talking about each other amen if you and i are not willing to stand for the truth who will right that's where elijah's at when nobody else is doing all this i got seven thousand hey man it might not be a lot of people but there's some people somewhere that's going to stand up for the kingdom of god they're not going to be quiet they're not going to hold their peace they're going to cry out they're going to get loud they're going to get mad about it [Music] for zion's sake the bible says i will not hold my peace he said for jerusalem i will not rest right let me sit this way and you're free to disagree with me if you'd like but i would say if you don't feel that way there's something wrong yeah big man except if you didn't feel that way then after i said there's something wrong you must have wondered you must be trying to get out of your marriage you let your wife get kidnapped like what are you doing man you didn't take the license plate number something would be wrong when you see the church of god afflicted when you see the enemy try to come in or whatever if you didn't feel upset about there's something wrong with your testimony all right that's right i might question if you even care we're actually obligated to fight because we're enlisted you're part of an army ain't man whether you want to cross over jordan or not you're enlisted to fight you're committed to the battle amen listen you're gonna have to fight your way to hell you're gonna have to fight your way if you're gonna fight either way you might as well fight and go to heaven when did we so weak some jellyfish man we just listen i'm all over the place you forgive me then i just try to be loved by the listen men in this country man this country i'm not even trying to justify her either way but listen men in this country 200 some years ago they were willing to die for the cause of liberty they'd rather die than not have liberty amen these were men that were rugged they signed their name on a declaration of independence so we'll live free of rule from an enemy where we'll die right we've got such a place we can't even walk outside of the house without getting defeated well just don't do this to me man why you all shook up by the devil right right right i'm here remember praise the lord why would you get all shook up he he's not even your biggest enemy you are right you realize satan's already defeated don't make him eye like he's so mean zeal this house is eating me up is the zeal this house heating you up it's another zeal amen not the zeal to be religious it's the zeal for this kingdom it's a reproach that most moses saw it i better say novice here has to give up with moses and the natural had to give up but he saw the reproach of christ and he esteemed it greater than the riches of egypt that's the zeal john was preaching about the wilderness repent yes turn your heart towards god who is he preaching to he wasn't preaching to a bunch of sumerians he wasn't preaching to a bunch of moabites some are preaching it to his own people repent why will you die all right amen he said there was no other course the brotherham says in the church of the book there was no other course then there is no other course now all right we're trying to find another rat we're not here to bypass our problems we're here for grace to go through it we're going to plow right through it let me see when the enemy says there's no way out we're gonna make a way out god in this is gonna make a way out there's no way out for my family god's gonna make a way there's no way for us to get over this sea god make the way when there is no way [Music] the king all right god gonna make a way for you how would you get out here god's gonna make a way for you this time tomorrow you'll be eating barley you'll be selling barley you'll be selling this now the king's like oh hey there's no way that can happen what's the license home well there's no way it's going to happen for you you're not going to be there to enjoy it but it's going to happen whether you're there or not and a bunch of lepers rose up that night said you know what we're starving where we're at sorry listen i've been in the world i've been in the carnal church i was starving a leper trying to find a way i'm just trying to find listen god's assuming you're on a garbage can that can't find somewhere to eat i'm so glad i found a seven-course meal i found spiritual food in due season they said we're gonna go down to the enemy's camp we might go down there and die but if we go down there at least we'll die fighting we're gonna die here anyway we might as well go down there guess what they got down there and that enemy everybody's so worried about we can't defeat them they got down there guess what one one of them around that's right god had already run them he said you know what we can't keep this to ourselves we can't keep the service something will happen us and we do it's bad luck we can't keep this to ourselves we've got to tell somebody the enemy's kim's defeated there's food for us to eat we don't have to live under oppression we don't have to live under tyranny we can go free today that great king that doubted he didn't eat but then the lepers ate that day and people ate that day money the barley was sold again what am i trying to tell you you don't have to live there anymore don't let fear keep you behind the walls don't let fear keep you from taking what the enemy stole from you you go down to the enemy's camp you take back what he stole from you god is with you as i was with moses so shall i be with you might as well die like a man that's not politically correct man or woman or whatever you might as well die on your feet amen let's not go out whimpering and sobbing and threatening about our lot in life let's go die like heroes let's go out with our war song and let the enemy know he never wants to deal with me again tell you what you have i don't know how many people we have to study history or military or whatever amen but there's one thing you never want to do with an enemy hey man sun tzu talks about this hope that's okay he says whenever you attack an inmate you never want to completely trap him you always want to leave him out of the scape why is that you say that doesn't sound doesn't make sense as long as he has a way to escape he will try to escape rather than fight you right but as soon as you have nowhere left to run and you have nowhere to retreat you will stand and fight like you've never fought before because now you're fighting for your life when you've got no escape plan that's when you really start fighting let me tell you brothers and sisters too many christians today they still got an escape plan they still got daddy's little idol in their pocket well jesus don't come through for me i've got daddy's idol we've got too many backups there is no other way out let's stand and fight we're gonna fight and live or we're gonna fight and die but either way let's fight amen let's fight the enemy with everything that's in us amen is that right you lose your life you might find it he said the way he has to repent why will you die let's live let's live for god amen ours is not to make reply ours is not the reason why ours is but to do and die [Music] i think i'll go another round he said brother you're not in a match for him oh i'm tagging out then i'm on jesus sent me ready to go another round amen he's not worn out by laodicea god's not tuckered out god's not tired he don't need a break god's ready to go [Music] god and you is ready to go when you walk out of here today i hope you aren't done i hope you're just getting started hey man i want to say like john paul jones i have not yet begun to fight oh looks like they're getting beat up looks like they're going down oh i just haven't started yet that's all i'm just getting warmed up you think you've seen god move watch what he's gonna do let's just let's not just talk about what god has done in our lives let's talk about what god's doing god doing something in your life today he's gone doing something in your life today you want to testify you want to shut it from the top of the hill god's doing something in my life he's not going to work in me he's going to finish it god ain't going to let me go god's not going to let me go down in defeat that brought some of you 20 30 40 50 years he ain't to let you go down now [Music] let's quit playing church hey man quit playing around man said well i'm a christian i just i don't i don't have that much to fight me well listen people will fight you over there sleep church they'll fight you over a piece of turkey christmas dinner hey man they'll fight you over politics hey man come on somebody they'll fight you over the economy they'll fight you everything else we're just gonna i don't want to fight for the things are gone listen i got something worth fighting for i found something worth dying for i i can say like the apostle paul none of these things move me i don't hold my own life dear i'm pressing on this message this gospel which is from priests i'm preaching i'm standing on it i'm pressing the let's keep going amen i want that kind of zeal zeal that won't let me rest till i see the purpose of god fulfilled in my life in your life no matter what it costs no matter what how bad it looks no matter how bleak things get i must see the purpose of god fulfilled amen nothing else was satisfied listen i don't know where you all come from different backgrounds and things let's just a young person understand my voice person's being tempted whatever amen listen i've been in the world it ain't got nothing to give me i know what it's like to live under the wick of the task master i've got no desire to go back under it i don't care if you're sitting in a church or you're sitting in a jail cell you can be under the task masters whip right right go to church and claim to love god i have to have more than that i'm not satisfied as a content slave i'd rather die a poor man free hallelujah i'm just all over the rainbow today going up and down the horizontal rainbow you know our culture we're in this victimhood everybody's a victim and i ah this person did that and this that and i've been oppressed my great great son so well praise the lord somebody amen i'm not making liar those things i'm telling you something we live in this society everybody wants to be a victim why because there's money in it well i spilled coffee on myself at mcdonald's i'm a victim well i drink some drano i ate a tide pot i'm a victim everybody's a victim and people coming to church i've just been a victim all my life i've been a victim to the enemy i've been a victim of the devil quit glorifying satan you want to make him a victim today you want to let him know he ain't got a hold of me anymore i don't serve the devil i serve the risen jesus christ and him alone listen we can't brag enough on jesus we can't testify enough about jesus he's more than

nevertheless you either go home or they all die that's when you're done not talking about going home from this building somebody probably wouldn't do that already hey man do it every day hey man stand your feet i say if you're gonna have to fight anyway if you're gonna be in a battle anyway you're gonna have to go through all these things listen you say well i don't want to suffer well you're gonna suffer either way you might as well suffer as a christian hey man the bible says if if you're buffing for your fault there's no glute you see some people oh you know i just i don't know why i'm going through this you know what i was speeding the other day it's 35 miles an hour going 85 they took my license i just don't know why god's doing this to me oh god probably trying to tell you you're fool i guess [Music] you did that to yourself but if you're buffeted and it's not your fault the bible says then the spirit of glory rests on you for so did they to the lord if you're gonna suffer you
