[29:22] [Music]
[29:25] man what you faithful for the Lord
[29:27] tonight amen well we just think full
[29:33] vengence God has given us an opportunity
[29:34] to be able to gather here tonight and we
[29:39] sent out the the email we got that sent
[29:42] out today and I wanted just to kind of
[29:45] address a few things here and the Lord
[29:48] willing on the services on Thursday and
[29:52] Sunday and probably speak on some things
[29:55] that are relative even to and some and
[30:00] some encouragement and guidance for in
[30:03] these times that we are we are in I want
[30:07] to let you know as a church this is not
[30:09] a time of persecution okay this is not a
[30:13] time of persecution as a matter of fact
[30:16] brother Branham would even tell us in
[30:18] the end the question is an answer 64
[30:20] he's asked a question he gives a very
[30:21] short answer to it and he's asked the
[30:24] question will the church the bride go
[30:27] through persecution like the early
[30:29] church did where the remm said no that's
[30:32] exactly what he said because the promise
[30:35] that we are looking for is rapture and
[30:38] that's could come at any moment we are
[30:40] not waiting as the people of God for
[30:43] this event to take place or that event
[30:45] to take place there's one event but
[30:47] we've been caught up in and we are under
[30:49] anticipation that if any
[30:52] to be caught away of everything within
[30:57] this that we right now are working to
[31:02] try to comply the government has not
[31:04] asked us to do this as far as to mandate
[31:07] that they could have very easily have
[31:08] done that especially you know some of
[31:11] the measures that the state of Ohio has
[31:14] already taken some of the first out of
[31:16] the states to have done that there are
[31:18] certain states that don't even have any
[31:20] reports of this cases of the virus and
[31:23] and we know that you know regardless of
[31:28] of what what is done I think that it
[31:31] would be the best in our interest to
[31:33] comply to what they are asking in this
[31:36] right here as citizens of this country
[31:38] never forget one thing that happened and
[31:41] I always thought this has been one of
[31:43] those experiences that has always stayed
[31:46] with me brother bill was there with me
[31:49] as well as a brother herb and it was in
[31:51] the time when we were in Honduras and a
[31:55] situation we were supposed to have won
[31:57] over the final meetings was in Ermita
[31:59] that night and different ones were
[32:02] travelling even behind us from
[32:04] Tegucigalpa all the way to our Mita we
[32:07] got there and when we turned down in a
[32:09] road you've heard me tell the story we
[32:11] turned down in a road and a man had just
[32:12] shot a man right in the head and he
[32:15] falls out of the truck no maybe no
[32:17] further from us - with him where sister
[32:19] Caroline and sister need are setting but
[32:21] for me I've never seen anything like
[32:23] that in my life I think the only gun I
[32:25] seen was maybe a water gun let alone
[32:28] something like that and I never in and
[32:31] it's so nonetheless it just really you
[32:35] know unnerved everybody and we that was
[32:38] right next to the lane that was next to
[32:41] the the church courtyard how its set up
[32:43] we backed out of there and and
[32:46] thankfully the Lord just watching over
[32:47] us even there we were able to pull into
[32:49] the church and people begin to gather
[32:51] and and just a wailing I never heard
[32:54] wailing before in my life people just
[32:56] started gathering in the
[32:57] I've got bigger and bigger and they're
[32:59] the pastor in in there Mita was he was
[33:02] there and and that different people were
[33:04] coming together and I never forget
[33:06] brother browning what he mentioned in
[33:07] that time he let the brother know he
[33:10] said look he said I don't think it would
[33:13] be wise for us to have service tonight
[33:15] he said but let's do this one thing he
[33:18] said let's just very solemnly not loud
[33:22] but let's just those who were there
[33:24] let's just gather together offer prayer
[33:26] for that family he said because it won't
[33:29] and he said for them here we would be in
[33:31] here rejoicing and there he said the
[33:33] whole community is right there wailing
[33:35] you don't want to add contention and
[33:37] strife two things and so I've always
[33:40] looked at that example and just as the
[33:44] Lord was just kind of quicken it to me
[33:45] you know in different times and and even
[33:47] right now I know that we walk in that we
[33:50] go around parking lots and sometimes you
[33:52] see where there's still cars that are
[33:53] out and things like that and people have
[33:55] to attend to different businesses and so
[33:57] forth but I think it would be the best
[34:00] thing after prayer just looking at it
[34:03] that we just we just comply with it
[34:05] they've asked for 15 days and and and
[34:09] thank God one thing i thankful for is
[34:11] that we already have the capabilities to
[34:14] at least do the streaming so I'll be
[34:17] standing here the Lord willing we'll
[34:18] have a song service and and I'll
[34:20] minister the word of the Lord during
[34:24] this time and the Lord willing we should
[34:26] be able to resume because they've only
[34:27] given the 15 days we should be able to
[34:29] resume on Thursday April 2nd the other
[34:34] the other part within it is that we've
[34:38] mentioned that within prayer request if
[34:40] there's any to be submitted because I'm
[34:43] not just talking to it those who are
[34:44] here I know online if there's prayer
[34:46] requests to be submitted just submit
[34:48] them through the email address we gave
[34:51] and that will that will then be read
[34:55] during the services because we want to
[34:57] bring those before the Lord in prayer as
[35:00] well as continue on as usual if there's
[35:02] anything with Facebook any urgent prayer
[35:05] requests we want to be able to bring
[35:06] that before the Lord and the Saints of
[35:09] God is
[35:09] and you can you could contact my wife
[35:12] she can get that posted there right away
[35:15] also I had mentioned on there you know
[35:20] I'm thankful that we're able to do the
[35:22] streaming and those things we've never
[35:24] had to do anything like this before I
[35:26] really don't I don't I don't recall
[35:30] anything we've ever had to do like this
[35:32] so it's kind of some uncharted waters
[35:34] but but God is faithful to help us and
[35:37] navigate through them I'm just glad that
[35:39] we can still maintain in contact and be
[35:41] able you know to deliver the word of the
[35:44] Lord even during this time and tried to
[35:47] stay as much as we can connect it
[35:50] together as a body of believers and I
[35:53] know it's not the same even at times
[35:55] where I've not been able to be here and
[35:56] I've had the stream it's it's it's not
[35:59] the same and it certainly won't be the
[36:02] same with me preaching the pews because
[36:06] I'm not I'm used to preaching to a
[36:07] lively congregation that really just
[36:11] pulls on the on the word of the Lord and
[36:13] just really loves the Lord and so I
[36:15] believe God will help us and give us
[36:17] what we have need of to encourage us in
[36:20] this time I tell you I think God has
[36:23] really just like the service here on
[36:27] Sunday it was as every service but it
[36:30] was so timely of what the Lord would
[36:33] Minister to our hearts because you and
[36:36] you look at the scripture that brother
[36:38] and Nathan was reading there and I just
[36:42] had told him before I said you know when
[36:43] I walked up here I said I had on my mind
[36:45] to talk to the people about peace I said
[36:48] but I just couldn't get to it but you
[36:50] see God knows that inspiration and no
[36:52] doubt that inspirations what's on your
[36:54] heart - I told him I said I just had
[36:57] that those hold those scriptures I had
[36:59] just rehearsed those scriptures before
[37:00] praying for brother the other night over
[37:03] the phone and and we just thank God for
[37:05] His mercy just God is so he's so
[37:08] personal I don't know how many times we
[37:11] say that but I still I just I'm always
[37:14] amazed and I love to see how God just
[37:17] comes by with her
[37:18] special delivery you think Lord there's
[37:20] another special package for me yep
[37:22] another one another special delivery
[37:24] with your name on it it's just so
[37:26] precious and you know I think tonight
[37:29] brother Mark Schaefer we want to
[37:32] continue remember him in prayer he's at
[37:33] home and the Lord has has been with our
[37:36] brother there's been some bumps in the
[37:38] road but yet nothing that takes our eyes
[37:41] off of the final expectation of complete
[37:45] healing amen the scripture said they
[37:48] shall recover it didn't talk about all
[37:50] the little things in between but we have
[37:52] to promise they shall recover and in a
[37:54] recovery is healing and for sister barb
[37:57] here we thank God for His mercy just
[38:00] touching sister barb and we with just
[38:04] everybody that knows just been rejoicing
[38:06] and and and how did the Lord move for
[38:08] her she was sitting in a doctor's office
[38:09] and then before she ever seen the doctor
[38:11] she said I believe my heart I believe
[38:13] it's right back in line right now and
[38:15] God just put her on her her her heart
[38:18] right back in line let me just say this
[38:20] to you right now and that go and that
[38:21] came out like that
[38:22] among other testimonies you watch what
[38:26] God is doing and will continue to do in
[38:29] the midst of even times like this he
[38:33] shows his love and his care amen
[38:37] sometimes well you know it was a no for
[38:39] sister barb here it comes down to maybe
[38:41] like the last moments or the last hour
[38:43] but God's always right on time and you
[38:46] know these are witnesses and testimonies
[38:48] for us that no matter what we might be
[38:52] praying for is nothing is is is we're
[38:55] not down to the finish until God until
[38:59] God steps in until God says and so we
[39:02] just look at that sometimes they don't
[39:03] come in the time we're looking for it
[39:05] but nonetheless as a believer we know
[39:07] when we've prayed and asked the Lord we
[39:09] know expect those things that we prayed
[39:11] for and God is always so faithful with
[39:14] that also in that email I mentioned and
[39:18] I want to mention to to everyone we you
[39:22] know over the course of the time there
[39:25] are things that are still necessary that
[39:27] even when we're not
[39:28] here on a regular basis we're the church
[39:30] things are still running to maintain
[39:32] curtain current temperatures and things
[39:34] like that so in gave an address where we
[39:37] would have a box that at least secure so
[39:41] in order to continue to support the
[39:44] ongoing expenses even during this these
[39:47] times here I know some people you know
[39:50] they they maybe they do all of their
[39:52] tithes and offerings right the first of
[39:54] the month or somebody does in a second
[39:56] however you do it if need be during that
[39:59] time don't forget to continue to support
[40:01] the church if you've already done what
[40:04] you normally do during during a month
[40:06] well then you you know this wouldn't
[40:08] apply to you but if at any rate you're
[40:11] able to send them to that address right
[40:13] there so and I want to say it like this
[40:18] you know this is not what we did with
[40:21] this right here we certainly somebody
[40:24] said brother send me are you afraid no
[40:26] I'm not afraid at all I'm not afraid I
[40:28] think God what peace what comfort you
[40:31] know are you worried about you know if
[40:34] they don't have a hand sanitizer wipe
[40:36] when you go to to put your hand on the
[40:38] shopping cart no no I'm not at all
[40:40] because it not that we're being ignorant
[40:43] of it but we understand that within
[40:45] everything that we're looking to the
[40:47] Lord in prayer because I don't have no
[40:49] doubt I mean you know the hand the cart
[40:51] might have been sanitized and I may have
[40:53] that white but who knows who I'm walking
[40:55] next to in the store who knows what they
[40:57] have who know and this has been going on
[40:59] I mean this isn't just something you
[41:01] know we're talking about something now
[41:02] but in everything let us remain
[41:06] steadfast to trust the Lord I just give
[41:09] you a little testimony you know my wife
[41:11] and I we we went out you know on on
[41:15] Monday which you know we have our
[41:19] groceries or we'll pick them up there
[41:21] you know once out of the week we for us
[41:24] we kind of just we just do the weekly
[41:25] shopping trip you know and uh because
[41:27] maybe my taste buds can change from week
[41:29] to week and so you know we we do that
[41:33] put our menu together and then we just
[41:34] she orders the stuff and gets it from
[41:37] the store
[41:38] they weren't doing that this week you
[41:40] know for us to pick it up and sometimes
[41:43] that's worked out good for our schedules
[41:45] because she can call me and say hey will
[41:46] you stop and pick this up and they just
[41:48] put it in your trunk for you that's kind
[41:50] of nice you know but anyhow they're not
[41:54] and I understand all that but you know
[41:56] we were just looking at it and I told
[41:58] the boys on Sunday night I said you know
[42:00] because for them and this was all ties
[42:03] in for them I told them I said you know
[42:05] I think I said in our praying and said
[42:07] we need to really evaluate how we're
[42:10] praying I said because we I was praying
[42:12] for them and not for the rest of the
[42:15] school kids there's there's a part of it
[42:16] that probably with teaching how if I was
[42:19] still teaching how to did a little
[42:20] praise break at first but I'd have been
[42:21] a little bit upset because when it gets
[42:23] down to the testing time I didn't want
[42:25] no days out of school but for them in
[42:27] college where they're at they wanted to
[42:30] be there they wanted they they just felt
[42:32] hey I want to be there to where I can
[42:33] interact with them and so we were kind
[42:35] of praying in that direction but then
[42:37] when I started looking at it I said you
[42:38] know we I think we need to pray and like
[42:40] you this in this manner and that is look
[42:44] for the Lord just to guide us through
[42:45] this time because we don't have any
[42:47] timelines on this we have right now the
[42:50] 15 days that they just came out with but
[42:52] other than that we just need the Lord to
[42:54] guide us through it and look for the
[42:56] blessing within it and I tell you what
[42:58] there's been blessings already that for
[43:01] them by God's grace that's been coming
[43:03] out but then the part with the shopping
[43:05] when a wife and I were able to go to the
[43:07] store and you and you know it was just a
[43:08] first I didn't know I was gonna see I
[43:10] thought boy is it gonna be just bare
[43:12] shells everywhere you know I didn't know
[43:14] and and and of course and our Walmart
[43:17] that's normal but and we went in how we
[43:21] we got out and and and and we went to to
[43:25] target there she said let's just try
[43:26] there I said well okay so we got in
[43:28] there I'll tell you what we found what
[43:30] everything we had meet up on our weekly
[43:32] list now that may not seem like much but
[43:35] for me it was a whole lot because it
[43:38] just shows that you know what I have
[43:40] found even before this term of
[43:43] coronavirus or whatever more that
[43:45] every time that we've had a need God has
[43:47] supplied that need and they've been
[43:50] something that sometimes that you know
[43:52] might seem silly to you but there's
[43:54] certain times I don't want to pay a
[43:55] price on a certain shirt or a time and I
[43:58] just don't want to pay it I just said
[43:59] Lord well you you know what I have need
[44:01] of it you just provided and you know
[44:03] what there it'll be clearance and they
[44:06] get a good price and I just think God
[44:07] for it I've really prayed that way and
[44:10] so God is faithful God is faithful
[44:15] through it all we just wanted we want to
[44:18] stay focused and just look to him the
[44:20] Lord was certainly and he is making a
[44:22] way through through all of this and
[44:24] through it all within our lives we
[44:27] cannot determine what the world is doing
[44:29] but in our lives in our hearts we can
[44:32] look to the Lord for the blessing that
[44:34] God has in it for our lives of how that
[44:37] our lives might be further enriched by
[44:40] his presence how that he'll make his
[44:42] word even more real and more sure in our
[44:45] lives so this is certainly not the the
[44:49] streaming is certainly not the ideal
[44:51] setting for us to have a service but I'm
[44:53] thankful we've got this option I really
[44:55] am I'm thankful that God has provided
[44:58] that and we'll have that that running
[45:00] and if anybody has any you know
[45:04] questions you can submit that question
[45:06] you know does anybody have any questions
[45:08] here tonight about anything yet for the
[45:13] Ritchie
[45:16] well the next prayer meeting is March
[45:18] 31st and I just I think we'll just have
[45:20] to see where where where that's at
[45:22] because actually I think that's the 15th
[45:24] day if I'm counting it right so we'll
[45:29] just have to see whether or not we have
[45:30] that I'm kind of looking at we'll just
[45:32] definitely have I think probably we may
[45:34] have to cancel that one I'm not sure and
[45:38] do this the first Thursday we can meet
[45:40] it is April 2nd as a congregation so as
[45:44] a whole congregation those are listening
[45:45] those who will hear it those are here
[45:46] Lord willing April 2nd on a Thursday
[45:49] night we should be able to resume
[45:51] completely meeting back here all
[45:54] together yes good question anybody else
[46:01] did I leave anything out
[46:07] you usually catch everything anybody got
[46:14] anybody else got a question and all it
[46:15] will be recorded and they will be
[46:17] streamed the services so it'll be both
[46:20] it won't just be stream but it also be
[46:22] recorded as well yeah yeah well not all
[46:29] but you know you you'll be able to step
[46:32] in yeah yeah yeah well we won't do that
[46:36] no we'll just stay with it cuz you have
[46:37] to be here and you know probably between
[46:41] you and Paul just have to take it
[46:49] brother bill has to be here he wouldn't
[46:51] know what to do if he can't be here like
[46:55] all of us but I mean bill might be
[46:58] sitting out in the parking lot at 8:30
[46:59] in the morning just set here I'm just
[47:02] picking with him but I know brother bill
[47:05] he he called me from the church here on
[47:06] Monday morning he was already over here
[47:08] so I just wanted we're allowed to to to
[47:12] have that we've got the different trying
[47:14] to cover the different areas back there
[47:15] to for for these types of gatherings so
[47:18] that's a good question better bill
[47:20] anybody else okay
[47:27] well let's take their requests here to
[47:30] the Lord in prayer brother Danny I don't
[47:33] know if you wrote did you write a
[47:34] request in here okay go ahead why don't
[47:37] you go and say okay
[47:53] okay
[48:15] yeah
[48:17] yeah

[49:29] yeah
[49:31] yeah
[49:39] you know
[49:42] yeah
[49:55] you
[49:58] yeah
[50:07] you know it's true that a lot of what we
[50:10] see around us where people are being
[50:11] driven with fear and it's it's a shame
[50:14] that those things are allowed to go on
[50:17] in in that you know because you see
[50:19] things I guess in my mind I think of it
[50:22] people buying things that they know
[50:24] there's no way in the world they can use
[50:26] perishable goods and how many of that's
[50:28] gonna how many how much that's gonna get
[50:30] thrown away and people are gonna end up
[50:32] being in debt because they've you know
[50:34] come under fear and these different
[50:36] things like that it's a real I tell you
[50:37] as a people of God it's a time to really
[50:40] to be thankful that we have a place of
[50:43] rest and that we have that to rest in
[50:47] the Lord to know that it's God that is
[50:49] our provider let me just tell you before
[50:52] Corona was it before that that word
[50:54] coronavirus was ever out there before
[50:56] and these other things let me tell you
[50:58] something
[50:58] it wasn't giant ego or Walmart or Target
[51:00] or anybody else that provided your food
[51:03] God has provided our food and that's the
[51:07] real reality and because our wisdom it's
[51:09] God that's provided for us and so you
[51:13] know with that we want to continue to
[51:14] remember I remember the different ones
[51:16] that are even I think of the
