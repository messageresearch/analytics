[25:45] though you may be seated for the Brian
[25:47] did you come
[25:50] song
[26:39] god bless you
[26:41] I prayed sorry to read a quote first
[26:44] that goes along with this song
[26:49] just really spoke to my heart what if
[26:52] they were that was in the token message
[26:56] 1963 what if you were had committed a
[26:59] crime and you were going to be tried in
[27:02] a federal court and you know that if
[27:04] they found you guilty that you were
[27:06] going to die you were going to be going
[27:09] to electric chair or the gas chamber
[27:12] whatever public execution they were
[27:15] going to have for you maybe hung or
[27:17] something lynched whatever the penalty
[27:19] was and you know that you were guilty
[27:23] and you know you were guilty and you
[27:26] must die if you don't get something some
[27:28] attorney to represent you that you can
[27:31] get out of the out of that thing and now
[27:34] you would want to have the best attorney
[27:37] that you could have and getting an
[27:39] attorney
[27:40] that was a good shrewd attorney you
[27:42] would feel that your case was a little
[27:44] could relax you could relax a little bit
[27:46] because you had an attorney but still
[27:49] there would be a question whether this
[27:51] attorney could change the judges idea or
[27:54] change the jury if this attorney which
[27:57] his shrewd speaking and the knowing of
[27:59] the laws could change that and could
[28:01] plead your case and prove that you
[28:04] should live but yet in all his great
[28:06] Authority in his great speech that he
[28:09] could make and the impression he could
[28:11] put upon the jury or have the judge
[28:14] you'd maybe you might get relaxed for a
[28:17] few minutes but still there could be a
[28:21] question in your mind can he do it but
[28:24] in this case the judge himself became
[28:27] our attorney God became man
[28:29] there was no attorney could do it but
[28:31] could we couldn't find one Moses and the
[28:34] law of the prophets nothing could do it
[28:36] so the judge both so the judge became
[28:39] both the jury attorney judge himself and
[28:42] took the Justice of his law in his own
[28:44] hands and paid the price for it himself
[28:47] how much more secure can we be and sent
[28:50] his own life back upon us as witness
[28:53] that he has accepted it how say
[29:03] I stood in the corner the judge turned
[29:09] my way it looks like you're guilty now
[29:16] what do you say
[29:21] I spoke up Your Honor I have no defense
[29:29] but that's when mercy walking
[29:36] oh mercy walked in and pleaded my case I
[29:46] call to the stand of God's saving grace
[29:54] the blood was presented that covered my
[30:01] sins

[38:56] to Genesis 18 I want to just go right
[39:00] into this portion Scripture
[39:07] say it's good to be good to be back home
[39:10] and even though I'm only was only gone a
[39:14] service but I feel like I was gone an
[39:16] eternity and so we but I do want to say
[39:20] we certainly appreciated your prayers we
[39:23] had three services there and the Lord
[39:27] just really moved in a real special way
[39:29] I just had a wonderful just a wonderful
[39:33] outpouring of the Holy Spirit and we
[39:35] just thank God for that and so they
[39:39] asked me to greet you it's first time I
[39:41] ever been there was up in the eastern
[39:44] part of Canada and it seems like within
[39:47] the past a year and so I've been in
[39:50] Canada there quite a bit I was thinking
[39:52] about what brother Harold Hildebrandt
[39:54] said he said do not come to Canada and
[39:56] say you're going to the mission field
[39:58] he said because you're not Canada is not
[40:02] the mission field so those of you know
[40:05] brother Harold Hildebrand you know he
[40:07] would say things like that but you know
[40:09] it was I tell you it was a real real
[40:11] honor brother Ivan Carr is the pastor
[40:14] there brother Ivan's 89 years old but
[40:16] you wouldn't know it you met him you
[40:19] wouldn't know it sharpest and I'll tell
[40:22] you what he's got so much life and he
[40:24] preaches he keeps on he preaches at
[40:26] least you know they have during the week
[40:29] they have four services a week and and
[40:32] it's not just a few people show up
[40:33] though they every service the whole
[40:36] congregation is there it's tremendous
[40:39] and so you know they they let me know
[40:43] when we're gathering here you just
[40:45] preach the people love the word
[40:47] everybody comes and they expect to hear
[40:50] the word so you just preached so we I
[40:53] just wanted to bring greetings back to
[40:55] you from them maybe you might never get
[40:58] the chance to meet them on this side but
[41:00] we will on the other side amen there's a
[41:02] group of believers that are really
[41:03] pressing on there and my just and
[41:06] brother Carmen Mills for some of you
[41:07] that know him maybe some of you don't
[41:09] brother Carmen stands there as an
[41:11] associate so we just had a just a
[41:14] wonderful time there with the saints of
[41:16] God
[41:18] we want to look right into the word
[41:19] tonight and I'm just gonna read a few
[41:21] verses scripture out of Genesis 18 let's
[41:25] begin in verse 1 and the land the Lord
[41:29] appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre
[41:32] and he said in the tent door in the heat
[41:35] of the day and he lift up his eyes and
[41:38] looked and lo three men stood by him and
[41:41] when he saw him he ran to meet them from
[41:44] the tent door and bowed himself toward
[41:47] the ground it said my lord if now I have
[41:50] found favor in thy sight pass not away I
[41:55] pray thee from thy servant let a little
[41:59] water I pray you be fetched and wash
[42:02] your feet and rest yourselves under the
[42:04] tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread
[42:07] comfort you your hearts after that you
[42:10] shall pass on for therefore are you'd
[42:13] come to your servant and they said so do
[42:17] as thou ascend and Abraham hastened into
[42:20] the tent unto Sarah
[42:22] and said make ready quickly three
[42:25] measures of fine meal knead it and make
[42:27] cakes upon the heart and Abraham ran
[42:30] into the herd and fetched a calf tender
[42:32] and good and gave it unto a young man
[42:35] and he hasted he hasted to dress it and
[42:38] he took butter and milk and the calf
[42:40] which he had dressed and said it before
[42:42] them and he stood by them under the tree
[42:44] and they did eat and they said unto Him
[42:47] where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[42:52] Behold in the tent and he said I will
[42:56] certainly return unto the according to
[42:58] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[43:00] shall have a son and Sarah heard it in a
[43:03] tent door which was behind him may God
[43:07] bless you bless the reading of his word
[43:09] you may be seated
[43:11] I want to just take this just for a few
[43:15] moments and and the part that I'd like
[43:18] to do without trying to cover so much
[43:21] ground very familiar ground but yet in
[43:23] in many of this here
[43:26] I just feel pressed to take it in this
[43:29] way as we look in the hour and the time
[43:31] of which we're standing
[43:33] I believe it's I believe it's always
[43:35] important we see down through the
[43:37] Scriptures where the people of God have
[43:40] always been a made aware of where they
[43:44] are standing in time and what God is
[43:48] preparing to do in that hour and you
[43:51] think of just that right there that in
[43:53] itself to know what God is doing in this
[43:57] hour and what is prepared in this hour
[43:59] and to be a part of that that's all the
[44:02] grace of God because for many to
[44:06] recognize and to see even to have come
[44:09] in contact with the ministry and the
[44:12] message that we have received yet to
[44:14] many it's not a message to many it's
[44:17] just a supernatural moving of God and
[44:19] they don't they didn't have not
[44:21] recognized of what God has done within
[44:24] this hour and to see that that is that
[44:27] is the grace of God that has come that
[44:29] has come to you and I and when you look
[44:32] at this within Abraham and to see the
[44:35] responsibility that where we stand in
[44:37] this time and we've been looking at the
[44:39] scriptures of where that how God taking
[44:43] out that of a Gentile bride and where
[44:46] that we stand in this hour in the very
[44:48] closing moments of time of God finishing
[44:52] up with the Gentiles and to see that all
[44:55] of this is rolled out within the
[44:58] Scriptures it's not just it's not just
[45:00] scriptures that are within the New
[45:02] Testament but it reaches back what is
[45:04] wrote in the new is only written from
[45:07] the prophecy there that even went forth
[45:09] from the Old Testament and yet many of
[45:12] the prophecies that we even look at and
[45:14] what we're reading here are things that
[45:17] are events that happened then but yet
[45:19] were prophetic of the hour and the time
[45:22] in which we're living in and it takes
[45:25] to open this for you and I within this
[45:27] hour and this time you know God could
[45:30] have opened these things and made it
[45:33] known to any generation in in a very
[45:36] special way that God reserved it in for
[45:40] this time because this time that you and
[45:42] I are living in is a time when the book
[45:44] itself has been taken by the Lamb and
[45:47] when the Lamb has taken the book
[45:49] remember he is he is claiming all that
[45:52] he has redeemed and through the taking
[45:55] of this book when the Holy Spirit now in
[45:57] its fullness comes in and takes a hold
[46:00] of that book he is revealing the very
[46:02] plan of redemption that has been all the
[46:05] way down through the scriptures even
[46:07] from that as we looked at in the life of
[46:09] Adam whether it was the mystery that was
[46:11] inside of Adam and yet here was Adam but
[46:14] yet within Adam was his bride and there
[46:16] had to come the the separation there had
[46:19] to come to sleep and the rest to where
[46:21] God could bring forth the bride and then
[46:23] present that to Adam and then we we look
[46:26] at this here within Abraham's life and
[46:29] we find that in Abraham being on a being
[46:32] on a journey and we find that where this
[46:35] would be in this moment I want to draw
[46:37] your attention here when we look in in
[46:39] the scriptures you notice that within
[46:42] all the times that God has spoke to
[46:45] Abraham the Bible has said many times
[46:47] that God appeared to Abraham he came to
[46:50] Abraham in lights and dreams and God
[46:52] also would come you know and make
[46:54] himself known there and as that in the
[46:57] in in the office of Melchizedek he would
[47:00] let him know that I am Melchizedek and
[47:02] then here in this time we we find that
[47:06] how that the Bible says in the opening
[47:08] verse that the Lord and capital L
[47:10] capital L capital R capital D this is
[47:13] the Lord Himself appearing and coming
[47:17] down to make himself known to Abraham
[47:20] and notice the scripture comes in and I
[47:22] I believe it's there within the third
[47:24] verse and it says and Abraham said my
[47:28] lord
[47:28] capital L lowercase old lowercase R
[47:32] lowercase D he is recognizing that here
[47:35] here is the Lord himself up
[47:38] hearing in flesh an Abraham when we you
[47:42] look at this within the scriptures here
[47:44] it's something that I believe that we
[47:46] can identify because Abraham in the
[47:49] previous chapter Abraham has just taken
[47:52] a hold of the promise of God and he's
[47:56] believing that promise of God remember
[47:58] God has just revealed himself to Abraham
[48:01] as El Shaddai I and Abraham you know as
[48:04] has taken that promise and and brother
[48:06] branham would say it like this
[48:07] he says when a real Christian can get a
[48:10] hold of a promise of God and believe
[48:12] it's for them that is the key right
[48:16] there when the believer can get a hold
[48:19] of the promise of God and believe it's
[48:21] for them you see this is think this is
[48:25] the thing to recognize that when God
[48:27] made the promise it's God made the
[48:30] promise with you as the believer in mind
[48:33] and so here how that he goes on to say
[48:37] and then that believer he's satisfied
[48:39] while he's nursing the strength all he
[48:43] said what a satisfaction of just knowing
[48:46] that God said so so here is Abraham
[48:49] sitting in his in his tent and you know
[48:52] to think of how that Abraham would be
[48:54] would be looking within his tent and
[48:56] brother branham would dramatize it in a
[48:58] manner you know that he said Abraham you
[49:00] know it must have been something that he
[49:02] lifted up his head and when Abraham
[49:04] lifted up his head he jumped up quickly
[49:07] and the Bible says here as we read in
[49:09] verse 3 that Abraham or verse 2 it said
[49:12] when Abraham saw those 3 men coming the
[49:15] Bible says he ran to meet them from the
[49:18] tent door it was something that that was
[49:21] within Abraham that arose that Abraham
[49:24] knew that there was something spiritual
[49:27] about these men it was something that
[49:30] caused Abraham to rise and Abraham to
[49:34] stand up and brother branham would say
[49:35] it like this he said it was the spirit
[49:37] in Abraham that told him go to them and
[49:42] to see says there's something about
[49:44] spirit-filled people that recognizes the
[49:48] presence of God and he goes on to say
[49:51] you know he's
[49:52] it's something about a spirit-filled
[49:53] believer that they must be he says
[49:56] magnetized to the Spirit of God because
[49:59] when you look at it it was not that they
[50:02] in the flesh looked any different from
[50:05] anybody any other stranger that had
[50:08] passed by the tent it wasn't by the way
[50:11] that they looked but it was that on the
[50:13] inside something that registered with
[50:17] Abraham that he ran to meet them and
[50:19] that was because the Spirit of God had
[50:22] alerted him that go and meet him he was
[50:27] magnetized to that and brother branham
[50:29] you know we would go on to say of how
[50:31] that you know Abraham sitting in that
[50:33] door he said he knew that there was
[50:35] something real and the spirit had
[50:38] declared it but you know he goes on to
[50:41] speak to us and let us know that he says
[50:43] how did he know that it's because he
[50:46] kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere
[50:49] all the time that he could recognize
[50:52] right from wrong all the time that's a
[50:59] real key to our lives is staying in a
[51:03] spiritual atmosphere that's the warfare
[51:07] that we face as a believer
[51:09] do you realize whatever the promise is
[51:12] that God has made Satan's objective is
[51:15] to try to trouble the atmosphere to
[51:19] hinder you from receiving the promise
[51:22] that God has for you and and you know
[51:25] you think when you you look at that
[51:28] brother Andrew Glover won't even see
[51:29] remember he preached on the overcoming
[51:31] opposition he opened up with the quote
[51:33] where you know different ones were
[51:34] praying for the Holy Ghost and about the
[51:36] time like Lois sister Lois Branham about
[51:38] the time she was getting ready to
[51:39] receive it you know her knees would
[51:41] start hurting or other things will start
[51:42] happening and brother brems says that is
[51:44] just satan they're trying to get your
[51:47] mind off of the promise even when
[51:49] brother Branham was going to go pray for
[51:50] a little Georgie Carter remember he
[51:52] couldn't find a place to kneel down he
[51:53] was being stuck with thorns here and
[51:55] there and finally brother BAM just said
[51:57] you know what I don't care no more I am
[52:00] just going to pray and seek God for this
[52:03] need so - racking
[52:05] naj that for us that staying prayed up
[52:07] it's something that not only are we to
[52:10] have a prayer life where we and our
[52:12] lives are off but a prayer life is not
[52:15] just something that's confined to this
[52:17] of a of a room or just being in our
[52:20] bedroom or or having a place yet I
[52:22] believe that that's important that we
[52:24] need to have prayer with God because in
[52:27] prayer that's where the secret of the
[52:29] mysteries are in prayer is where its
[52:31] submission comes in listen if you can
[52:34] really be honest tonight that's exactly
[52:36] what the devil wants to try to take he
[52:38] wants to try to take prayer because it's
[52:40] through prayer as it says in the book of
[52:42] Jude that we are built up our most holy
[52:45] faith praying in the Holy Ghost
[52:48] not a--not if every one of us if every
[52:51] time that we prayed there was always you
[52:53] know the guarantee that we were going to
[52:56] enter in to the Spirit of God and my we
[52:58] were gonna free you know since the
[53:00] Spirit of God and be carried away you
[53:02] know it wouldn't probably be so much of
[53:05] a hard thing but many times or times
[53:07] when we do pray there's times when we
[53:09] don't feel anything there's times when
[53:11] we don't seem to have a very great
[53:13] spiritual connection but we realize that
[53:16] even in the midst of prayer when we are
[53:18] praying that he himself even though we
[53:21] don't feel him but we do have an
[53:23] audience with the king and that's where
[53:25] faith itself can stand there and we know
[53:28] that we're not just saying words out
[53:30] here but our heart is being poured out
[53:32] to the Lord and his word prayer you find
[53:35] that how that not just in that
[53:37] closed-off moment but even throughout
[53:39] the day the Bible says I would that men
[53:42] were praying everywhere lifting up holy
[53:44] hands is that right now when you look at
[53:47] that part of the scripture lifting up
[53:48] holy hands that refers to the banner of
[53:51] the word that God has given within this
[53:53] hour it's to lift up the hands like the
[53:56] hands of Moses were exalted when we are
[53:59] praying we are praying in the Holy
[54:01] Spirit we are lifting up the banner of
[54:03] the word the word that God has revealed
[54:06] to you and I we are to take that word
[54:08] pray over that word applying that word
[54:11] to our life meditate upon those things
[54:13] don't allow a service just to be
[54:16] something that we
[54:17] into and it's dismissed from your life
[54:19] if there's going to be things within
[54:22] this service as it is in every service
[54:24] you won't remember everything but there
[54:27] will be something that God will say
[54:29] personally to you that God desires that
[54:32] you would take pray over that water that
[54:36] and expect that to come to pass you see
[54:39] this is exactly what God made known to
[54:42] Abraham when you look in Genesis 17 the
[54:45] Bible here within this 17th chapter how
[54:48] much takes place so quickly in Genesis
[54:51] 17 Genesis 12 God calls Abraham he calls
[54:55] him a cause Abram in justification there
[54:58] are chapters that go by
[55:00] prior to Genesis 15 to where Abraham
[55:03] himself becomes sanctified gets all
[55:05] cleansed up from habits and everything
[55:07] else but you see listen now look from
[55:09] Genesis 12 to Genesis 15 what was it
[55:13] that brought Abraham to a place of
[55:16] sanctification
[55:17] it wasn't Abraham's work it was Abraham
[55:20] abiding in the grace of God under the
[55:24] love of God and God was working in
[55:26] Abraham's life to bring about what he
[55:29] had already spoken hey let's just be
[55:31] real God when God spoke to Abram the
[55:34] Bible's clear it's God that called him
[55:36] out of the ur account deeds it was God
[55:39] who said when Abram was in a condition
[55:41] still making idols still making other
[55:44] gods he had all sorts of habits and
[55:47] everything else about his life but God
[55:49] said I called you to be a father of many
[55:52] nations God already made the promise it
[55:55] had nothing to do with Abraham's works
[55:58] it had everything to do with God's grace
[56:01] so what we want to abide under is the
[56:05] grace of God not our works we want to
[56:09] let grace you see when there's grace
[56:11] that is fourth unit isn't it just trying
[56:13] to balance us out here you realize what
[56:15] grace is grace is not something where it
[56:18] is a demanding but grace is where you
[56:21] are relenting and submitting to what God
[56:24] is moving upon your heart and your life
[56:26] to do there might be things that you've
[56:29] got to pray about and you
[56:30] stand there upon god's word and there's
[56:32] times where god will bring your life to
[56:34] showdowns like he did with Abram and lot
[56:37] God brought a showdown to where the
[56:39] separation could take place but in all
[56:42] things it is God's grace moving in your
[56:45] life for him to perform his word through
[56:48] you and I because after it came out you
[56:51] know think about this now let me just
[56:53] preach for a few moments you think about
[56:55] it in Genesis 15 after the chapter of of
[56:58] sanctification where the blood has been
[57:01] shed
[57:01] now you look what takes place right
[57:03] after Genesis 15 in this journey here
[57:06] the very next chapter is Genesis 16
[57:08] we're sorry I herself now think of this
[57:11] she operating there under that of
[57:14] sanctification she goes forth to try to
[57:17] bring forth the promise on her own works
[57:21] and it won't work
[57:24] it began with grace it's going to take
[57:27] grace you see when when Sarah I was
[57:31] working it looked like she's working in
[57:33] conjunction with the promise but in
[57:36] actuality she's becoming more stronger
[57:39] against the promise of God instead of
[57:43] resting and said I don't know I don't
[57:46] understand that but God said you're
[57:49] going to be the father of many nations I
[57:51] don't know how it's going to be but I'll
[57:53] join in with you and crazy but she took
[58:00] the works of the flesh and it produced
[58:03] an Ishmael there's still trouble with
[58:07] Ishmael today yeah well you see God he
[58:15] takes this now in Genesis 17 and the
[58:18] opening of this chapter now where they
[58:21] have come to a place of complete
[58:23] deadness and God speaks to Abraham in
[58:27] Genesis 17 and he lets him know here he
[58:30] says I'm the Almighty God
[58:32] he lets Abraham know they're in one of
[58:35] the opening verses and verse 4 my
[58:37] covenant is with thee
[58:38] is that right you see this is the return
[58:42] of the Holy Ghost in
[58:44] and the restoration of the gifts my
[58:46] covenant is with thee but then the very
[58:49] next verse verse five now here it comes
[58:53] no longer shall thy name be called Abram
[58:56] but thy name shall be called Abraham so
[59:00] now you have the return of the holy
[59:02] spirit now write quickly here one verse
[59:06] later you have the positionally placing
[59:09] in the adoption in the body of Jesus
[59:12] Christ as we said last week God Himself
[59:15] came down and that fifth letter there in
[59:18] the Hebrew alphabet that that that of
[59:22] the that of the age that fat five
[59:24] numerical value speaking of grace God
[59:27] spread Abraham's life apart and he
[59:31] inserted himself in the midst of
[59:34] Abraham's life because God did not want
[59:37] Abraham's he wanted Abraham you see it
[59:43] is not us reproducing ourselves but it
[59:47] is God's own life that is being
[59:50] reproduced through us and that's why
[59:52] brother Branham could say that had that
[59:55] Abraham when God gave Abram that name
[59:58] his own name because Abram was to
[1:00:01] reproduce the faith of Elohim through
[1:00:04] his life and that's what a real believer
[1:00:07] is it's not our faith it's God's faith
[1:00:11] you're not here tonight by your own
[1:00:14] faith you're here
[1:00:16] because he made a promise by his
[1:00:19] presence real to you and faith has rose
[1:00:23] in your heart to stand on that promise
[1:00:25] and as a believer the same God then
[1:00:29] moved on you for that promise is the
[1:00:31] same God that will move on you for every
[1:00:35] promise and you just be as obedient and
[1:00:37] the simple as it was when he moved on
[1:00:40] your heart that's exactly how the
[1:00:43] rapture is
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:48] Abraham was in a place where he was
[1:00:51] spiritually prayed up and the promise
[1:00:54] had already been made when God brought
[1:00:57] it to a place to where he lets it be
[1:01:00] known to Abraham that Sarah you're gonna
[1:01:03] have a son by Sarah thy wife and by the
[1:01:07] way he lets him know don't you call her
[1:01:09] Sarah I know more see there was a hidden
[1:01:13] character down there you see what God
[1:01:17] speaking to is the depth because the
[1:01:19] Bible is clear I believe it's in second
[1:01:22] Chronicles and when it's given the
[1:01:23] genealogy and it given the genealogy
[1:01:25] says and there is an abram out the same
[1:01:28] is Abraham let me tell you something
[1:01:30] there is that of Carlos and metal Samuel
[1:01:33] and that of power and that of Richard in
[1:01:35] that of day but the same is also a son
[1:01:39] of God amen we know your house had the
[1:01:43] same as Aaron and the same as a son of
[1:01:45] God it's the same thing it's God letting
[1:01:49] us know that he's speaking to the
[1:01:50] character down on the inside amen
[1:01:55] God did not call Abram because he was
[1:01:58] worthy he called Abraham because Abram
[1:02:02] was a part of God hallelujah and the
[1:02:09] same was called Abraham hallelujah Oh
[1:02:17] beloved what love is this that we should
[1:02:25] be called the sons of God the world did
[1:02:30] not know him no more than it knows us
[1:02:41] Abraham was in a place I want you just
[1:02:44] to this is a very simple but it's
[1:02:49] something I believe then it's a part and
[1:02:53] to be a part of our lives God has just
[1:02:56] spoken to him he's letting know there's
[1:02:59] got to be a seal in your flesh Abraham
[1:03:03] remember makes the petition oh that
[1:03:06] Ishmael would live before you
[1:03:09] why would Abram ask that it was because
[1:03:12] he loved Ishmael it's because Abraham is
[1:03:14] staring and seeing the deadness of
[1:03:19] himself he's dead and he's right in the
[1:03:24] place God wants him sometimes God not
[1:03:30] just sometimes let me correct that God
[1:03:33] lets us come to the end death that life
[1:03:37] can come life can't come as long as
[1:03:40] you're still alive but when it's death
[1:03:44] and you know what God let him go
[1:03:47] now Abraham in his body fake in his body
[1:03:52] he's completely dead he can't father any
[1:03:55] more children right now Sarah's been
[1:03:58] bearing the whole time but God lets him
[1:04:01] know Sarah is gonna bear a son and I'm
[1:04:04] gonna tell you what his name is
[1:04:06] it's Isaac I'm gonna establish my
[1:04:11] covenant with him and furthermore God
[1:04:16] lets it be known yeah I heard what you
[1:04:17] said about Ishmael yeah I'll bless him
[1:04:20] he'll have you I'm megachurches and
[1:04:22] we'll do this and we'll do that and
[1:04:23] you'll have programs and everything else
[1:04:25] but my covenant is with Isaac and God
[1:04:31] clarifies it in Genesis 17 21 and he
[1:04:35] says my covenant will I establish with
[1:04:37] Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee
[1:04:41] at this set time in the next year this
[1:04:47] word right here this is no messing
[1:04:49] around with an address it's as punctual
[1:04:53] this isn't well someday you'll get well
[1:04:55] this is affirmative in the next year you
[1:05:02] know what that means there's got to be
[1:05:07] nine months so between Ronettes spoken
[1:05:10] and the three months that leads to the
[1:05:12] nine months there it's gonna have to
[1:05:13] come a transformation Lord in order for
[1:05:19] this to happen you're gonna have to do
[1:05:21] something because the way I see myself
[1:05:23] and the way that I see the promise of
[1:05:26] the world you know what you're asking
[1:05:28] for you're asking for one to feel the
[1:05:30] preach you're asking for one that can
[1:05:34] put his hand on where you are and the
[1:05:36] handle where God has called you to be
[1:05:39] don't you realize that's what the Holy
[1:05:41] Ghost is the breach in your life that
[1:05:44] yelps you to the word where you are
[1:05:47] prisoner of jesus christ you are united
[1:05:50] in the word by the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:05:53] Holy Ghost himself that standing in the
[1:05:56] gap Alleluia will repeat of God and your
[1:06:04] need he knew your need knew my need knew
[1:06:08] he would be here and God has provided
[1:06:10] for himself how can we be united outside
[1:06:16] of him so Abraham knew that this was
[1:06:25] coming now you think about it brother
[1:06:29] Brian within the set time next year
[1:06:32] Abraham Abraham was setting in the tent
[1:06:35] door brother Graham tells us he said
[1:06:38] Abraham was in the door lot was in the
[1:06:41] gate he said I'd rather be in the door
[1:06:43] than being the gate because the door is
[1:06:45] in the house Abraham was in the house
[1:06:48] lot was on the gate come on
[1:06:51] thank God for gate for those who are
[1:06:53] gated for God so loved the world he gave
[1:06:55] His only begotten Son that whosoever
[1:06:57] believeth in him should not perish are
[1:06:59] you with me but to be in the house
[1:07:02] it's ordained to be in the house and
[1:07:06] Abraham is sitting in the door he's
[1:07:09] looking because there's been a promise
[1:07:12] made that Sarah is going to have a son
[1:07:16] and now here Abraham looks up and he
[1:07:22] sees these three men coming and he runs
[1:07:25] to meet them the Spirit of God Abraham
[1:07:28] you think Abraham one meditatin in the
[1:07:30] word Abraham no that was meditating in
[1:07:33] the word he was thinking about the name
[1:07:35] change he's you know recovering there
[1:07:37] from the seal in his flesh he's bearing
[1:07:40] the seal of God's covenant there in his
[1:07:43] flesh here he is you know he's receiving
[1:07:45] strength from God he's nursing why
[1:07:48] standing there in the tent door and
[1:07:50] about that time remember as we read in
[1:07:52] the scripture he went and told some
[1:07:54] young men go get onion
[1:07:56] young calf otherwise known as the fatted
[1:07:59] calf kept up for special / special
[1:08:02] occasions
[1:08:03] go get that fat and captain prepared he
[1:08:06] told Sara quickly me get three cakes of
[1:08:09] flour and need him quickly he's telling
[1:08:12] her and brother random wouldn't bring it
[1:08:14] like this he said Abraham was telling
[1:08:16] Sara Sara
[1:08:18] this I believe is our day of visitation
[1:08:23] you see the Spirit of God was connecting
[1:08:27] him with the promise that was made in
[1:08:30] the other chapter but now the God who
[1:08:33] made that promise was appearing there
[1:08:36] before him in human flesh the same God
[1:08:42] that it dealt with him in portions down
[1:08:45] through that the the ages had given him
[1:08:49] strength to walk out of the earth Saudis
[1:08:51] had given him a little more strength to
[1:08:53] live a sanctified life and now comes and
[1:08:55] releases his strength in him by the
[1:08:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost changes his
[1:09:01] name brings the seal of the circumcision
[1:09:04] in his flesh and says you are going to
[1:09:07] receive the promised son very no ands
[1:09:15] ifs buts maybes with God every promise
[1:09:20] that God has made you will have to fight
[1:09:24] for it
[1:09:25] you will have to fight for it and you're
[1:09:28] fighting for says this is my promise
[1:09:31] idiots worth it it is mine oh my this is
[1:09:39] why you know brother dad said I want to
[1:09:41] be so acquainted with him he said I want
[1:09:45] to I want to see him I want to recognize
[1:09:47] him when when I when I see him I want to
[1:09:50] be so acquainted with him I'll know him
[1:09:52] on the very first sight I recognize that
[1:09:55] it's god that's my heart's desire as to
[1:09:57] be as Abraham was now let's let's bring
[1:10:01] this in this manner here God is showing
[1:10:07] and laying out through this visitation
[1:10:10] God is laying out in this time where it
[1:10:15] is a capping and bringing to
[1:10:19] manifestation the coming of the son that
[1:10:24] has been promised
[1:10:25] they started out walking in that promise
[1:10:29] now God there is coming a time where now
[1:10:34] the very fullness of the God whom self
[1:10:37] the Lord who made the promise now to
[1:10:40] come on the scene and now to perform
[1:10:43] that promise that he himself has made
[1:10:47] now when we look at it here you see all
[1:10:50] of this it pertains that's why that that
[1:10:53] this in the scriptures it's not just
[1:10:56] it's not stories its prophecy for this
[1:11:01] same thing remember the Bible says in
[1:11:03] the book of Galatians that how that the
[1:11:06] blessing of Abraham through the cross
[1:11:08] has passed upon the Gentiles and God had
[1:11:12] already preached to Abraham that that
[1:11:15] Envy shall you know shall you know
[1:11:18] shouts out dominations be blessed
[1:11:20] that shall be a father of many nations
[1:11:22] and those so then if we as Paul would
[1:11:25] bring this in if we be in Christ by that
[1:11:29] of the Holy Ghost we are Abram Abraham's
[1:11:33] seed because we are identified in Jesus
[1:11:37] Christ now to think here at the closing
[1:11:40] out before the coming son here with
[1:11:43] Abraham what we're reading before the
[1:11:45] promised son could be received God comes
[1:11:49] down and reveals himself through human
[1:11:52] flesh there's a reason that he does this
[1:11:57] because the revealing of himself in
[1:12:00] human flesh is to raise the faith and to
[1:12:04] bring a uniting for the oncoming son and
[1:12:08] then to receive the oncoming son it's
[1:12:12] also to announce there is judgment and
[1:12:14] destruction that is coming that's the
[1:12:17] same way it was when the Lord Jesus came
[1:12:20] at the end of the Jewish dispensation
[1:12:24] let me just slow down look when he come
[1:12:27] now at the Jewish dispensation he
[1:12:30] reveals himself in Matthew 8:20 and he
[1:12:33] call he refers to where he is standing
[1:12:36] as that the son of man foxes have holes
[1:12:39] and the birds of the air have nests but
[1:12:41] the Son of Man
[1:12:42] nowhere to lay his head in Matthew 16 13
[1:12:47] through 16 Jesus remember he's asked
[1:12:50] them who do men say that I the Son of
[1:12:52] Man am and some said you're John the
[1:12:56] Baptist and some said Elijah and some
[1:12:58] said Jeremiah or one of the prophets see
[1:13:01] all of them were portions of him they
[1:13:05] were all portions of him they were all
[1:13:09] pointing to him they were all
[1:13:12] reflections but he is the true light and
[1:13:16] so he's asking them who are men saying
[1:13:20] that I am and to see their referring
[1:13:22] back to will your John the Baptist's or
[1:13:24] it's Elijah or it's Jeremiah but he
[1:13:27] turns to them and he says who do you say
[1:13:29] that I am because what's important is
[1:13:32] you got to know who he is to you is it
[1:13:37] just a historical figure is it just
[1:13:40] something that happened 2,000 years ago
[1:13:42] or is he real tonight to where you
[1:13:46] recognize what was done 2,000 years ago
[1:13:49] was a manifestation of what was in God's
[1:13:52] mind and I was included in the vicarious
[1:13:56] suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[1:13:59] that was me that He shed his blood for
[1:14:02] me he was wounded for my transgressions
[1:14:06] he was bruised for my iniquities the
[1:14:08] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:14:12] you understand you come to the place
[1:14:14] that Calvary is not a wholesale affair
[1:14:17] but Calvary is a personal revelation
[1:14:20] what was sung about tonight where there
[1:14:23] comes a living reality there that the
[1:14:26] Living God
[1:14:27] our judge became our attorney and he
[1:14:30] shed his blood and he sent back the Holy
[1:14:33] Ghost as a token there that you can say
[1:14:36] there has been a pass from death unto
[1:14:39] life
[1:14:42] who do you say that I am now watch this
[1:14:47] Peter answers thou art the Christ the
[1:14:51] Messiah the son of the Living God
[1:14:56] remember how he made himself known to
[1:14:58] Abraham the Lord appeared right the
[1:15:03] fullness of God appeared and Abram went
[1:15:08] running and said my lord capital L Laura
[1:15:11] Cates all lowercase R lowercase D
[1:15:14] agonize that which is one that in
[1:15:16] relation to that a flesh God become
[1:15:19] flesh hallelujah Abraham knew who
[1:15:27] Dorsett so when they're asking who do
[1:15:34] who do men say that had the Son of Man
[1:15:36] am
[1:15:38] who was standing there the Virgin born
[1:15:41] son of God that right virgin born body
[1:15:45] made in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:15:47] right he had to come and through that
[1:15:51] way the Bible says in Galatians 4 that
[1:15:53] he had to be made of a woman made under
[1:15:55] the law to redeem them who were under
[1:15:57] the curse of the law when he appeared to
[1:16:01] Abraham you see that could not be a
[1:16:04] shedding of blood and a Redemption and
[1:16:06] of putting away of sin but there was a
[1:16:08] uniting with the promise that would
[1:16:11] speak of what he would do at the end of
[1:16:14] the Jewish dispensation and he would
[1:16:16] also point to the time that we are
[1:16:18] living in in the ending of the Gentile
[1:16:22] dispensation let me just for sake of
[1:16:29] time when Jesus stood before the Jews in
[1:16:33] John 8
[1:16:35] and he began to talk about the same and
[1:16:39] they said well you know are you greater
[1:16:44] than Abraham who are you
[1:16:49] he's dead
[1:16:51] are you are you greater than the
[1:16:53] prophets they're dead who make us thou
[1:16:59] thyself who are you Jesus let him know
[1:17:04] I'm not packing around my own honor the
[1:17:09] Father honoureth me in other words I'm
[1:17:14] going around toot my own horn the seal
[1:17:19] of the Father is impressed upon my life
[1:17:23] that's the ministry of the son of man
[1:17:25] the fullness of the Holy Spirit the seal
[1:17:28] of God has come right there has to be a
[1:17:32] sealing of God's people before
[1:17:35] destruction can come it's all of this
[1:17:40] place all of this lays in here and he
[1:17:42] goes on to tell them he says Abraham
[1:17:46] rejoiced to see my day and he saw it now
[1:17:54] what did Abraham see Abraham saw what we
[1:17:58] just read right here and he saw what
[1:18:01] they were seeing God was manifested in
[1:18:05] flesh he was standing there and then
[1:18:10] notice when he stood there before Sarah
[1:18:12] he was he desert the word discerned the
[1:18:16] secrets and intents of the heart this
[1:18:18] was not this ministry was not something
[1:18:21] that was to glory in the outward
[1:18:24] appearance come on somebody this
[1:18:27] ministry takes the cover off of sin it
[1:18:31] takes all of this self-made
[1:18:33] righteousness and takes it right down to
[1:18:36] the core where you could have men that
[1:18:38] you couldn't put a finger on their lives
[1:18:40] come on now they had everything just so
[1:18:43] right and they did this so right and
[1:18:45] this and but Jesus looked at him and
[1:18:47] said you're full of dead men's bones you
[1:18:50] know what a disgrace it was to touch a
[1:18:53] dead person you weren't even allowed in
[1:18:55] the camp they were full spiritually of
[1:18:59] dead men's poles it was things of the
[1:19:03] past but they couldn't recognize the God
[1:19:06] that they read about they couldn't
[1:19:08] recognize him standing in their midst
[1:19:11] this is what the promises were all about
[1:19:14] the promises weren't about that you can
[1:19:17] recite the ten commandments that you
[1:19:19] knew what Moses said here you know what
[1:19:22] Elijah said there that he what it was
[1:19:24] all about it's that you recognize the
[1:19:26] one who sent Moses the one who said
[1:19:29] Elijah the one who spoke surger mind
[1:19:31] that you recognize that Living God that
[1:19:34] was there living in every portion and
[1:19:37] every reflection of the rainbow that is
[1:19:39] gathered up into the supreme light of
[1:19:42] all life and it's shining
[1:19:44] in a light of redemption hallelujah
[1:19:49] that's what was important and men that
[1:19:54] were so astute let me just tell you
[1:19:56] right now you need to turn around and
[1:19:57] just black the devil's eye right now you
[1:20:00] might look at and say I don't understand
[1:20:02] this I don't understand this I don't
[1:20:04] understand this but I'm asking you can
[1:20:07] you recognize him because if you can
[1:20:10] recognize him he'll see to it that you
[1:20:13] understand what you need to understand
[1:20:15] when you need to understand that I would
[1:20:18] rather be here tonight in that condition
[1:20:20] than to know this message in and out and
[1:20:23] not be able to recognize him alone
[1:20:31] I'd rather know him because not to know
[1:20:36] his water his life but to know him this
[1:20:39] life if you know his word and you don't
[1:20:42] know him then his word don't have no
[1:20:44] life and power in it and you don't have
[1:20:46] a living vindication in your life but
[1:20:50] when you know him you know the life
[1:20:52] giver that raised up Jesus from the
[1:20:55] grave you know that same God that raised
[1:20:58] that body up that was cold that was
[1:21:00] stiff and he raised it up out of the
[1:21:03] tomb whether he can raise promise after
[1:21:06] promise after promise in your life he
[1:21:09] can raise you higher and higher and
[1:21:12] higher by what that same quickening
[1:21:15] power he took the woman at the whale and
[1:21:19] quickening power raised her from a
[1:21:22] prostitute to a saint
[1:21:24] it only did it raised her took what
[1:21:28] God's thought was all the time that word
[1:21:31] came had redeemed her it scattered all
[1:21:38] the darkness like Genesis one it broke
[1:21:41] back the clouds
[1:21:47] here who was at the ending and this
[1:21:49] Jewish dispensation who are you Jesus
[1:21:57] looked at him and said Abraham rejoiced
[1:22:01] what we read today
[1:22:03] Abraham ran to meet him Abraham said go
[1:22:07] get the fatted calf
[1:22:09] go get make cakes Sarah this is our
[1:22:13] moment of visitation the Lord Himself
[1:22:18] has descended him with a shaft come on
[1:22:22] somebody Amen the Lord not a part but
[1:22:25] the Lord Himself this is the mystery of
[1:22:28] the coming of the Lord the Lord Himself
[1:22:31] descending in that of a shout what is
[1:22:33] that the Living bread of life the
[1:22:36] outpouring of the Holy Ghost that pokken
[1:22:40] life bearing a man that can they connect
[1:22:46] all these promises together here takes
[1:22:48] the Holy Ghost and it takes the Holy
[1:22:50] Ghost to make it live in our life here
[1:22:55] was a closing out of that Jewish
[1:22:56] dispensation and Jesus let him know
[1:23:00] before Abraham was I am hope they didn't
[1:23:07] have a piece of bread in their mouth
[1:23:08] they probably choked because they're
[1:23:11] thinking year before Abraham you ain't a
[1:23:15] man more than 50 years old he wasn't
[1:23:18] talking about this he was talking about
[1:23:21] who he was he said I am the resurrection
[1:23:24] and the life God came down and created a
[1:23:30] body to dwell in to pay the price of
[1:23:34] redemption to bring you and I'll back to
[1:23:36] himself and that same God that came and
[1:23:39] paid the price of redemption and
[1:23:42] ascended up on high sent back the Holy
[1:23:44] Ghost and has been bringing a Gentile
[1:23:47] bride down through the ages down through
[1:23:49] the seven ages and now here we are
[1:23:52] standing in this time for finishing up
[1:23:55] of that time
[1:23:56] two ways not coming in a term as far as
[1:23:59] to redeem her he's already done there
[1:24:01] but the coming of the Lord now is to
[1:24:04] claim what he's already redeemed you see
[1:24:09] you and I just recognize that we were
[1:24:12] included in Redemption but you already
[1:24:15] redeemed he already paid the price on
[1:24:21] Calvin and before Calvary in the mind of
[1:24:25] God your name and my name was wrote on
[1:24:28] the lamb section when it wrote his name
[1:24:30] down because we are not identified in
[1:24:33] our own name in the day that God made
[1:24:37] them male and female he called their
[1:24:40] name Adam we are identified in the name
[1:24:44] of the world and his name is called the
[1:24:48] Word of God the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:24:59] closing out of the Jewish dispensation
[1:25:02] he makes himself known as the Son of Man
[1:25:06] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:25:10] it's the fullness not a portion the
[1:25:13] fullness but you know what that's making
[1:25:16] ready for the upper room Genesis 18 is
[1:25:23] making ready for Sarah's womb come on
[1:25:27] somebody you see here it is where he has
[1:25:31] made known to them like you did in
[1:25:32] Abraham the sign of the Messiah brother
[1:25:35] Dan will say like this let me read it
[1:25:37] out as straight as the gate he said you
[1:25:39] know you say he was standing Jesus
[1:25:40] before these righteous Jews that could
[1:25:42] not believe him to be the son of God and
[1:25:44] they called Abraham their father
[1:25:47] he was letting them know what he was
[1:25:50] that he was doing the same things in his
[1:25:53] flesh that God did in another flesh when
[1:25:57] he met their father Abraham Jesus also
[1:26:04] said I'm just moving here Jesus also
[1:26:07] said in Matthew 24 for as the Lightning
[1:26:10] cometh out of the east and shyness even
[1:26:12] unto the West so also shall also the
[1:26:14] coming of the Son of man be
[1:26:16] this is not the coming of the Son of Man
[1:26:18] whether it were the earth were those
[1:26:20] inhabitants of the earth who remain in
[1:26:22] the tribulation and even after it's been
[1:26:25] revealed to Israel this is not what the
[1:26:27] scripture pertaining to this scripture
[1:26:29] is pertaining to the evening light that
[1:26:32] comes in this hour
[1:26:34] it's pertaining to the angel of the Lord
[1:26:36] that same angel in Revelations 18 one
[1:26:39] that says that great angel who the earth
[1:26:42] was lightened with his glory they manage
[1:26:45] the fullness of the Holy Ghost that come
[1:26:48] to the Church of the Living God the same
[1:26:51] angel of God that led him out in a first
[1:26:53] Exodus but same angel of God that came
[1:26:57] in the second Exodus and is the same
[1:27:00] angel of God in the third Exodus that's
[1:27:02] leading us as a letter from a natural
[1:27:05] land to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:07] and now leading you and I to the baptism
[1:27:10] of the Holy Ghost into in my father's
[1:27:13] house are many mansions the same angel
[1:27:19] of the Lord
[1:27:30] this was why I want to read these quotes
[1:27:32] to you here brother Branham says as it
[1:27:37] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[1:27:40] in the coming of the Son of Man Elohim
[1:27:42] the strong one would come down in human
[1:27:44] flesh
[1:27:45] hello him the strong one would come down
[1:27:47] in human flesh and would manifest
[1:27:49] himself by knowing the secret of the
[1:27:52] heart of the one he was talking to just
[1:27:55] exactly what his son did when he was
[1:27:57] here on earth
[1:27:58] dwelling in human flesh what flesh your
[1:28:03] flesh my flesh the Holy Spirit Himself
[1:28:07] coming down in human flesh and dwelling
[1:28:10] showing signs in another part he said
[1:28:23] here it is it's the same angel that met
[1:28:27] Abraham you think about that brother
[1:28:30] here the previous chapter he's already
[1:28:33] made the name change and here shows up
[1:28:36] strangers how many of you ever had a
[1:28:42] stranger show up to you and call you
[1:28:44] your name you'd want to know how does
[1:28:47] this person know my name
[1:28:50] the first thing going through your mind
[1:28:52] they might give you a list and tell you
[1:28:54] where a million dollars are but you
[1:28:56] ain't even thinking about what they're
[1:28:57] saying you're thinking about who told
[1:28:59] him my name you see what God did he made
[1:29:04] himself known Abraham recognized who it
[1:29:08] was come on somebody it was Abraham that
[1:29:11] caught the visitation that was coming it
[1:29:14] was Abraham that told Sarah the Lord is
[1:29:17] come here this is our visitation Sarah
[1:29:20] get ready what a faithful husband
[1:29:24] Abraham was he let Sarah know this is
[1:29:27] our day a visitation probably to God and
[1:29:34] here here it was that same angel he came
[1:29:39] there and her name has just been changed
[1:29:41] and
[1:29:42] Abraham's name had just been changed in
[1:29:44] the previous chapter he one lakh they'd

[1:30:27] speaking there is a communion that takes
[1:30:30] place brother Graham says look at this
[1:30:35] the same angel that met Abraham this is
[1:30:37] very important not me this is just a
[1:30:41] vessel he can use you're a vessel he can
[1:30:46] use you see the ministry here it was not
[1:30:49] a ministry of where this is done and now
[1:30:53] God goes away we're not living back in
[1:30:57] Genesis 18 what i preaching to you
[1:30:59] tonight is history I've got to lay this
[1:31:02] for what for what we're coming into this
[1:31:04] present this is history to live back in
[1:31:07] Genesis 18 and in that time when here
[1:31:10] it's come down in human flesh to live
[1:31:12] back then that time is back in history
[1:31:14] it's now to be filled with the mystery
[1:31:18] of God in your womb not just for guts
[1:31:23] and a prophet and they're wonderful all
[1:31:25] these testimonies and all those things
[1:31:26] honor listen we we thank God for the
[1:31:29] Ministry of Malachi for if it had not
[1:31:32] been for the Ministry of Malachi for
[1:31:35] revelations 10 7 you and I would have
[1:31:38] never known who was in our midst
[1:31:41] it took an eagle for the Eagle to
[1:31:45] declare himself come on somebody
[1:31:49] it took a sheaf for the wave sheaf to
[1:31:52] make himself real to you and I it
[1:31:55] wouldn't take Eagle theology it took the
[1:31:58] living flying eagle the power of God to
[1:32:02] move down that you and I might recognize
[1:32:07] but once we've recognized Malachi for
[1:32:12] revelations saying they have served
[1:32:15] their purpose and the message that has
[1:32:17] come it comes now to reproduce Jesus
[1:32:22] Christ in bride form not another message
[1:32:28] but the Holy Ghost producing and
[1:32:31] reproducing producing and reproducing
[1:32:35] the world in our life it's growing and
[1:32:38] multiplying not me this is just a vessel
[1:32:45] he can use sometimes I think people
[1:32:51] glorifying the vessel too much you're a
[1:32:55] vessel he can use you see if the devil
[1:32:58] get your eyes just on that you feel the
[1:33:00] recognize you're a vessel he can use
[1:33:02] well I ain't like brother branham God
[1:33:04] don't want you to be like brother
[1:33:05] branham he wants you to be you
[1:33:13] he manifest his glory through you now
[1:33:17] say I'm not a preacher I'm not of this
[1:33:19] I'm not that you don't have to be that
[1:33:20] you just be a believer and let him
[1:33:22] manifest his power through your life oh
[1:33:29] brother man says you let him know that
[1:33:31] the very God that talked to Abraham that
[1:33:33] dwell in human flesh some kind of flesh
[1:33:36] he created we are flesh look at this
[1:33:39] that he created and promised through the
[1:33:43] righteousness of his son that we'd be
[1:33:46] sanctified and given gifts that his
[1:33:50] spirit would move in us like it did
[1:33:52] before the destruction of Sadr
[1:33:58] your flesh and my flesh consecrated to
[1:34:04] his purpose
[1:34:04] you're not the prophet of the hour I'm
[1:34:07] not the prophet of the hour but a
[1:34:09] prophet has come and the prophet used
[1:34:12] him a prophet went off the scene but the
[1:34:16] prophet still stays here
[1:34:18] the Prophet is the Spirit of Truth
[1:34:23] that's what brother Brown called the
[1:34:25] prophet of the hour is the holy ghost
[1:34:28] that's why that we are to recognize who
[1:34:32] it is that has spoke to us behind the
[1:34:35] flesh veil because who else that has
[1:34:41] spoke to us is the one that performs the
[1:34:45] word in our midst and in our lives and
[1:34:48] is the very one that will translate us
[1:34:51] into the rapture program said just
[1:34:57] before the coming of the end time the
[1:34:59] world would get like it was in Sodom
[1:35:01] it's there ain't it it's there see how
[1:35:05] God leaves these things out like a map
[1:35:07] in the mall you're here the world would
[1:35:11] get like it was in Sodom when a man came
[1:35:14] down in human form three men two angels
[1:35:16] and God himself the Bible said he came
[1:35:18] down and manifested himself there by
[1:35:21] turning his back to the tent where Sarah
[1:35:23] was and told Abraham and Sarah what they
[1:35:25] were thinking in the tent he said now
[1:35:27] Jesus said at the day when the Son of
[1:35:29] Man is being revealed in other words the
[1:35:32] Son of Man the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:35:35] his self is talking about the fullness
[1:35:41] not just a portion of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:45] but the fullness of the person himself
[1:35:53] this is why you had a question where a
[1:35:56] person turns around and they you know
[1:35:59] they ask brother branham you know oh the
[1:36:01] question a brother branham some say
[1:36:04] could brother branham could Jesus look
[1:36:06] like brother man brother BAM said it's
[1:36:08] the same spirit anointing me that was
[1:36:14] there and he said if you that have the
[1:36:18] Holy Ghost it's the same spirit
[1:36:20] anointing you come on somebody you see
[1:36:26] as we said here even the other day that
[1:36:28] when we look at it and recognize that
[1:36:31] the eyes themselves are not outside the
[1:36:33] body dies are in the body and the eyes
[1:36:37] are what let's light in the body come on
[1:36:40] now the random himself is a part of the
[1:36:43] many membered body it is the message
[1:36:47] that you and I the message and the
[1:36:49] messenger and we recognize we are under
[1:36:52] the authority of that word that God has
[1:36:56] vindicated in this hour this is our
[1:36:59] message I don't know you we've not been
[1:37:03] given a message to talk about historical
[1:37:06] things but this is a time for that which
[1:37:10] was spoken to come to pass a man not
[1:37:14] just to rehearse things of the past but
[1:37:17] that this word he comes to pass in our
[1:37:20] life I want you to think of this brother
[1:37:23] M says the church and went from
[1:37:25] justification through Luther through
[1:37:27] sanctification through wrestling through
[1:37:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:37:32] Pentecostals he's dealing with the
[1:37:34] church remember Jesus was given a pure
[1:37:36] undefiled bride at the day of Pentecost
[1:37:39] mature it was a bride aged he came he
[1:37:44] came in bride form the son of man was
[1:37:50] here what was he doing the son of man in
[1:37:52] the closing out of the Jewish
[1:37:53] dispensation what was next to come there
[1:37:57] in the womb of that Church of the Living
[1:37:59] God the church from Pentecost did not
[1:38:03] start out as an infant girl
[1:38:04] it was a fully matured woman when God
[1:38:10] laid Adam to sleep took out of his side
[1:38:12] he what did he do he brought after he
[1:38:14] had brought her forth he brought her and
[1:38:16] she says she shall be called woman she
[1:38:18] was taken out of man and he said that
[1:38:20] that how man shall leave his father
[1:38:21] mother and cleave unto his wife and they
[1:38:23] shall be one they will want when they
[1:38:26] walked out of the upper room hallelujah
[1:38:31] he that had come in the flesh and now
[1:38:34] come in their flesh are you with me
[1:38:39] that is why in x19 for others who were
[1:38:43] preaching about the coming of the Lord
[1:38:45] and what God had done in John's ministry
[1:38:47] and my and their wonderful in John's
[1:38:49] ministry and they were talking about
[1:38:51] Jesus ministry and Paul said hold on a
[1:38:54] moment
[1:38:54] have you received the coming of the Lord
[1:38:56] I mean the Holy Ghost I see come in your
[1:39:00] flesh yet are you talking about what he
[1:39:03] did in that flesh what he did in that
[1:39:05] flesh now the atonement has come and
[1:39:08] you're to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:39:11] it was the ending of the Jewish
[1:39:14] dispensation the manifestation of the
[1:39:17] Son of man and that led them to the
[1:39:19] outpouring of the Holy Ghost then we see
[1:39:24] the Fallen woman takes place here in the
[1:39:26] fusion Age after that Bride age of about
[1:39:28] 20 years what happens the seed goes in
[1:39:31] the ground and the Dark Ages right you
[1:39:33] put a seed in dirt is that right then
[1:39:35] the seed starts to come forth it'll
[1:39:37] shoot then it comes up to a tassel then
[1:39:40] it comes up from a tassel you've got
[1:39:41] there you've got to shuck and the shuck
[1:39:43] looks like the seed but the seed is
[1:39:45] inside right so there has to come a time
[1:39:49] where the seed that's in the shut that
[1:39:51] the seed comes out of the shot right so
[1:39:56] you have all of these parts and where it
[1:39:59] is speaking in this hour at the ending
[1:40:01] of the Gentile dispensation that so
[1:40:04] shall the coming of the Son of man be
[1:40:06] has the lightning shyness right from the
[1:40:10] east and to the west this is speaking of
[1:40:13] this time we're living in
[1:40:15] I'm closing your okay I'm closing you
[1:40:21] okay
[1:40:27] we just cross here
[1:40:30] but the church will go through all of
[1:40:32] this
[1:40:35] and go right on in let me finish this
[1:40:37] quote and go right on into the
[1:40:41] perfection of the son of man that when
[1:40:46] husband and wife will be the same self
[1:40:52] persons
[1:40:57] who's taking us there he has what's done
[1:41:02] it grace grace grace grace grace God
[1:41:15] will be so manifested into his bride his
[1:41:20] church till they will both be the same
[1:41:26] they are one
[1:41:32] the token of his life to where we are
[1:41:36] identified by his life in his life
[1:41:46] we're living in the day of the seal of
[1:41:49] the Living God the seal of the Living
[1:41:53] God
[1:41:55] remember grieve not the Holy Ghost
[1:41:58] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:42:01] redemption Martin Luther did not have
[1:42:05] the seal Wesley did not have the seal
[1:42:08] Pentecost did not have the seal but here
[1:42:12] at the end time the seal comes because
[1:42:16] it's God
[1:42:17] listen it's God testifying to his
[1:42:21] workmanship I have brought the bride to
[1:42:27] perfection and he puts his seal upon it
[1:42:33] and remember he who the father has
[1:42:37] sealed the son of man it is Christ
[1:42:41] himself in bride form same life same
[1:42:49] reflection same manifestation same Jesus
[1:42:55] and with that he's just like when
[1:43:02] they came and said no I will return unto
[1:43:08] the according to the time of life now
[1:43:12] who was the I brother Brian that's
[1:43:13] talking is the I the flesh or is the I
[1:43:17] the I am behind the flesh it was the I
[1:43:20] am behind the flesh and it caught what
[1:43:25] was in Sarah's heart she left in her
[1:43:30] heart
[1:43:33] me how pleasure with my lord
[1:43:37] this has been and he's an old man too
[1:43:43] but he caught you wasn't reading her
[1:43:46] eyes or reading her mind like I catch
[1:43:49] her facial motions she was in the tact
[1:43:52] behind him but he revealed the sign of
[1:43:56] the Messiah he revealed the secrets and
[1:44:00] intents of the heart
[1:44:02] you know what that was to do that was
[1:44:04] liberating Sarah it was God taking the
[1:44:10] sails off of Sarah the sails up down
[1:44:15] that had ever sailed up but the word
[1:44:19] forced the issue and here he stands she
[1:44:29] laughed in her heart and Sarah said no
[1:44:30] no no I didn't know Graham said you see
[1:44:35] our stupidity y'all with me I say amen
[1:44:40] to that
[1:44:41] every time I've heard it ever read it
[1:44:42] amen he said our failures our mistakes
[1:44:46] he said in preaching revival none of us
[1:44:49] would be here including the preachers to
[1:44:52] preach it but he said what it is he said
[1:44:56] you say I make failures he said Abraham
[1:44:58] made failures but what it is he said
[1:45:03] it's that word in you and you are a part
[1:45:07] of your husband the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:11] and it's the word working in you the
[1:45:20] female could not be circumcised but her
[1:45:24] circumcision was in that of the male so
[1:45:30] the seal that we bear upon our life is
[1:45:33] the seal of the Living God the Lord
[1:45:36] Jesus Christ come on it ain't a church
[1:45:39] seal it's the seal of the Living God
[1:45:43] hallelujah and more identified in his
[1:45:46] life God would have slew her but she was
[1:45:53] identified in Abraham remember when he
[1:45:57] came he said where is Sarah thy wife
[1:46:03] God knew they were Bible sweethearts
[1:46:06] they were identified in a oneness a
[1:46:10] union and God if he did touch Sarah he
[1:46:14] too had to kill Abraham and in order for
[1:46:17] God to take us he had to kill Christ but
[1:46:23] he can't do it alone even of all the
[1:46:28] times that even in our hearts where
[1:46:30] we've sent her now I don't know I don't
[1:46:31] know if I could be with me on I don't
[1:46:33] know me and I don't know you're looking
[1:46:34] at yourself
[1:46:37] how can I do this how can i it ain't
[1:46:39] what you can do it's what he already did
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:44] so they didn't just break the seals off
[1:46:47] your life but stand you let him break
[1:46:50] the seals off your life and you watch
[1:46:52] that transforming power it moves down it
[1:46:56] changes it transforms it releases it
[1:46:59] breaks holes
[1:47:01] I'm so glad about that
[1:47:10] I trust it's a little bit clearer to you
[1:47:12] not though these things are new to us
[1:47:15] new to some but I believe it's good as
[1:47:19] all Spirit of God would give unction to
[1:47:20] go back into this and to think about
[1:47:24] where we're living within this time and
[1:47:28] the question was asked and I think it
[1:47:32] bears asking tonight is there anything
[1:47:36] too hard for the Lord capital L capital
[1:47:42] o capital R capital D nothing
[1:47:52] you might say brother Samuel I don't
[1:47:54] feel like I got much faith don't confess
[1:47:56] that don't you even confess that faith
[1:48:01] itself is what says God has promised it
[1:48:05] God will fulfill it what do i do get
[1:48:11] yourself in the tent door and start
[1:48:13] praying and start expecting you pray and
[1:48:19] you take a hold of that promise and you
[1:48:21] expect God to come because what God said
[1:48:25] in the previous chapter
[1:48:26] he didn't scatter something this was not
[1:48:28] something was just well some years to
[1:48:31] come he said within the set time this
[1:48:34] next year I'm coming I'm coming and I
[1:48:41] think I'm gonna come I'm gonna come in
[1:48:44] Sarah - you see that's why in the hour
[1:48:49] that we're living in when the rest of
[1:48:52] the church world is looking for when the
[1:48:54] Son of Man would come in great power and
[1:48:56] glory and that they're looking for all
[1:48:58] of that they're looking for a part there
[1:49:00] that's in Matthew 24 and revelations 1
[1:49:03] and all of those little parts that are
[1:49:04] there looking for it in that way but the
[1:49:07] coming of this the coming of the Lord in
[1:49:09] this hour is actually a going he has
[1:49:14] come in his bride
[1:49:20] come on now and you know what that means
[1:49:23] here the bride the marriage of the lamb
[1:49:26] has come and his in his bride she has
[1:49:31] made herself ready we are going to the
[1:49:35] wedding supper we are going to see our
[1:49:38] bridegroom there is a literal Jesus
[1:49:46] there is a literal Jesus that's heavy
[1:49:51] [Applause]
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:54] and his spirit have been pulled out to
[1:49:59] make the church ready what we do stay in
[1:50:05] your tent door just keep staying in your
[1:50:07] tent door and when it comes to that
[1:50:09] moment you'll know when to run you'll
[1:50:13] know you're magnetized to the promise
[1:50:19] let's pray your lord I pray Heavenly
[1:50:25] Father tonight your God when we look at
[1:50:30] where we're at in this hour nor do we
[1:50:33] don't take it lightly we're hard to be
[1:50:37] sober to be serious I pray father if
[1:50:42] there's one among us one that would be
[1:50:44] listening or one that would hear this
[1:50:45] service that God if they're not ready
[1:50:48] may they make their preparations and
[1:50:50] tonight
[1:50:51] may they Lord I pray your God just
[1:50:55] giving to you letting the grace of God
[1:50:59] work in their life
[1:51:04] Lord to see Abraham's life from Genesis
[1:51:08] 12 all the way he kept walking all he he
[1:51:14] had failures he made mistakes but the
[1:51:21] grace of God it kept moving in Abraham's
[1:51:26] life Lord the same way you're moving in
[1:51:31] our life your God I pray right now

[1:51:56] been called by you you might have used
