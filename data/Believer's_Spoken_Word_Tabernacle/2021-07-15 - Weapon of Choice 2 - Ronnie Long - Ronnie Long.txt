the one that we're looking to father god we just give you the lord complete control lord that you just have preeminence in this service and lord we have need of you to speak tonight father as we surrender ourselves to you lord may you just move in in a mighty way we pray jesus name amen amen god bless you tonight it's going to be in the house of the lord with you and thank you for the songs that were sung amen you you got uh stuck with me again two weeks in a row but um i kind of ward a little bit with moving on but i'm just gonna go back to joshua 10 if that's okay and uh didn't quite get all the way there last week so we just trust that the lord is still is still bringing inspiration amen praise the lord the 10th chapter of joshua in the 22nd verse then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmoth the king of latish the king of eglon and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight and afterwards joshua smote them and slew them and hun hang them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening so you may be seated may god bless his word tonight and i know uh if maybe if you weren't here last week we just we'll just re face it for a minute here but but uh brother bannon would preach the message uh the greatest battle ever fought and he would talk about how there's five there's five gates or there's five inlets to the to the soul and there's there's one way to to to control that and that's by self-will there's there's one thing that governs all those gates and that's self-will and so last week we kind of got into how that these five kings uh we labeled them as those five inlets to the soul and i think it's uh it's uh imagination memory conscience reason and affection and and these these kings as if it were or we we typed last week and then and then the gate to the cave being your self-will right that remembers that and if you weren't here now you're caught up so but last week we just got into a little bit of of uh of of what it is to battle our memory and what it is to battle our imagination but overall we're talking about battling our self-will and and really giving a full surrender to god that we can overcome our self-will and our self-decisions and our in our own it's not a mind over matter type type sermon but it's an actual faith in god's word that if we could just lay aside our own cares if we could lay aside our own reasons like joshua said here he said this this example that i'm giving you that you're putting your foot on the neck of these kings these great kings that everybody was so afraid of this example here he said but fear not nor be dismayed because every enemy that you come against you will be able to do this same exact thing too and i believe once we've conquered the devil and once we beat a devil and once we know what it feels like to have victory then it's much easier for us to enter into it the next time because we know that the word will work the same way it did on that one it will work on the next one and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if he defeated that devil by the truth there he'll have to defeat the next devil by the same truth so if we could just if we could just look to these things and it be encouraging to us it's not it's not a a downer message or uh or a feel bad in ourselves message because we have a battle against self-will but it's a promise that god gave us that we can overcome these things and there will be a generation that will overcome these things and i believe i expressed that last week i believe we are that generation that will overcome these things and i believe we're seeing them overcome uh day by day i was so encouraged when i got done last week the brother back here told me that he was reading joshua 10 on the way to church and and how he was going over that very scripture i thought well the lord's in perfect control and and i know that he has a time and he has a season for for every person for every stage of life and sometimes the word might just be for a specific person in the building and maybe it didn't mean much to you at that time of life but somebody else is at a different season but but god is on time every time and i know that if we have a question or we have a desire or we have a longing for a deeper relationship with him he on time to answer that request tonight i i myself i i am being pulled more than i ever have been pulled to to live a fully surrendered life to god to to get rid of my own thoughts and to get rid of my my inabilities maybe we were born with or maybe you inherited down and you might have a certain personality or a certain nature because you were born that way with it but there's a season for everything to come out there's a season for for every king to be called out of the cave and to be put under your feet and a lot of times we're we're kind of set up in this life for failure by our own nature but god placed a victorious seat in there before there ever was a personality trait handed down before there ever was a nervous spirit that you maybe got from your your grandma or your grandpa or a lust spirit that you inherited from some family member before that was ever there god put a a a seed of victory inside of us and and that's what we're trying to dig down to we're not trying to overcome this by our mind or or by our own intellectual conception but we're trying to dig down deep enough so we can find that seed that god planted here before there ever was a trial before there ever was a rainy day before there ever was a mistake made in your life god put that seed in there and many times we have to we have to go through the desert and we have to walk a long walk before we realize that that we just need to surrender god has a very uh particular way of getting us to surrender and for moses he had to go through life for 40 years and and and learn all these smarts and educations and and how to how to control this and control that and just to find out that he would have to go wander in the desert for another 40 years and forget everything that he learned about it and paul would have to forget everything that he learned about in his life and and just become a surrendered vessel that he could be used by god and i don't think we're going to get there any different than that and so last week maybe we we we conquered the king of memory and we conquered the king of imagination but uh brother bannon would say that those those things that were given are all right as long as they line up with the word of god now our memory is a gift of god if it lines up with the word of god and our imagination can be used of god if it lines up with the word he says they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them now imaginations conscious memories reasons and affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word then get rid of it you you blow a flu right quick remember last week we talked about cleaning out the channels if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it that's right the engine if your memory if your imaginations if your conscience anything disagrees with what's on the inside get rid of it what you got then you've you've got a solar system i like that a solar system it's god that set the stars in order and said hang there till i call you then stay there that nothing's going to move them when god can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with god behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there that's right he come around and say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts hallelujah now i know that all of us have probably professed a healing in our life and then there the devil comes to say well you don't really feel any better but what the prophet is telling us there is look past what you feel and feel past what you feel it and look to the unseen realm that god promised that you would be healed and that's what he's speaking of clearing out a channel where we're not depending on what this feels like or what we can see with these natural lives but we know that there's a greater promise there that god said if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and that is a promise from god and we believe it's still in effect in this day and if god said it that settles it in my mind now now my my senses might argue with that they might say well what about this and what about that and they pull us this way in that way but if we can get that channel cleared out if we can get that flu cleared out and just have a have such a contact with god in our faith that we know no matter what it looks like it might be looking like it's pulling the other direction it might look like we can't get under it or we can't get around it we can't get over it but brother brahm said that's the time when you give in to self-will and you say lord i can't fight this anymore but i have faith that your word is true i have faith that you are god and you are a rewarder of those that diligently seek you and i seek after your face tonight and i don't know how i'm going to get through this situation but you promised that i would get through it and he said when those channels are gone when they're cleared out you could just say hallelujah enemy comes against you says well you don't feel any better your mind battle's not any better tonight than it was last week you just look past what you feel and get that channel cleaned out he said glory to god it shines out certainly just as clean and clear for the word of god to work through the power of god see that's the main thing we've got to give a way for the power of god to work in our life we can't have it filled with doubt and what ifs what about this it says that your battleground your battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit you can have little consciences and little feelings little sensations all these things but that has nothing to do with it that's just little sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends he says oh god let none of them miss it that's where our battle is taking place it either is going to accept this or it's going to reject it we can't walk down the middle we can't stay on the fence we can't have one foot in and one foot out and and then we wonder why we're struggling in our life and we wonder why we can't seem to keep a victory in our life is because we have one foot in and one foot out but he said you'll either reject it or you'll receive it you'll either accept it or you'll deny it and so we have to make a decision remember we're talking about the weapon of choice it's in our hands uh this this battleground it's in our hands it's it's it's something that we are deciding with what we are going to choose we're going to choose what god has placed within our our life before there ever was a battleground now we have to recognize who we are and what's in there i believe we know that but he goes on to say what caused that because because eve never disbelieved it but she just took a reason that would be reasonable this would be all right and it caused every death every sickness every sorrow every heartache and how are we going to get back in if it caused if it cost 6 000 years of this how are we going to get back with anything less than every perfect word the way it's written the devil won the battle over the human race by reasoning with the human race just reason why it stands to reason this would be it stands to reason if the reasoning is contrary to the word then the reasoning the reason is wrong the word is right just the way it's written don't put any private interpretation to it just say it the way it's written and believe it like that see god has took care of it it's just exactly the way it's supposed to be so let's just believe it that way i think that sounds pretty simple right church let's just believe it the way it's written let's not put our own interpretation to it and i'm talking about your own your own imagination your own reason your own conscience your own affection and maybe you want don't want that to quite go this way because you have affection that's fighting against that but it's time to just take the word for what it says and don't put your own interpretation to a lot of times we throw that off on denominations or it's denominational move but i'm just talking to the individual tonight what about you you receive the word it can't put your own interpretation to it he says now it's the word every word the holy spirit in a man every sentence in the bible the holy spirit in you will punctuate it with an amen because the holy spirit wrote the bible and if he's in you how can he say well that was for another age or that was for this or that was for that how can he say that and be the holy spirit in you can't do it he has to say amen to it because he wrote it in the first place right so if we have the baptism of the holy ghost we can't do anything else but say him into this word so if we took on the headship of christ and we took on the baptism of the holy ghost we have surrendered our weapon of choice we have surrendered what we want and what we're going to dictate and we're just going to let god have his way how many would like god to have his way in your life how many would like god just to make every decision in your life or you wouldn't have to you wouldn't have to wander and you wouldn't have to guess and you wouldn't have to to play that game in your mind but you would know without a shadow of a doubt god chose this way for me and if you have that confidence let's just use this for example if god told me that i was gonna go fishing today and i was gonna catch five fish now it might sound crazy but what if god came down and he told me you're gonna catch five fish today you better believe i'm gonna buy a fishing pole and i'm gonna go out and i'm gonna go fishing i don't care where i'm at i'm gonna find a body of water why because god told me that now it might sound simple to us but but what about if god told you that you're going to overcome every circumstance in your life now a lot of times we walk through this life defeated and down and we're afraid and we're we're scared to reach out in our faith but god who created the stars and he created the galaxy and he created the earth and and he was here before there ever was a problem or there ever was a circumstance he told you as an individual that you will overcome every enemy that you face in this life every every situation that you can't seem to get through you will be an overcomer on the other side that's not a guesswork that's not a maybe so but i'm getting my fishing pole and i'm going fishing remember the story brother ma'am said when when there was a there was a woman sick and she was dying and they were having a war of whether let the catholic priests come in and do the blessings for death or whether they would let brother branham come in and pray for her and and you remember the story and and so they they decided let brother branham come in and pray and he waited on a vision waited on a vision and he said thus saith the lord shall live and the man says goodbye i'm going to get my house ready my wife's coming home tonight see if we could have that kind of faith in every promise that god gives now we have a thus saith the lord for every promise of god we don't need a man here to stand here and say that promise is for you as an individual but god said let there be light and there was light as he said let there be an overcomer there would be overcomers i believe we got to fulfill that prophecy in our life i believe we are the overcomers of this age we can't put it off for another age we can't put our own interpretation on it but we have to overcome that spirit of reason that's the that's the hardest one for us to overcome because it's how our mind works it's how we tick it's how we we go back and forth and you're probably reasoning why i'm up here right now and some of us are thinking thoughts a million miles away and some of us are in the moment and some of us have seven different thoughts going on at the same time but all that works together in in our our old nature it works together to fight the move of god but a surrendered life it can be used by the lord a surrender life it will be used for the purpose that it was given he says if it's the word it is so now we know we've got counterfeits everywhere that's right it's a battle you've got to know your enemy you've got to know your armor your armor is the word your enemy is something that will reason against it now i tell you dear you don't have to do this our church is the biggest church we got more uh-huh intellectual giants and you listen to him a few minutes he will have you so far away from the truth till you won't know where you're at that's right now we find this great enemy of god now as long as they will believe that word i can never get to them this is satan the great enemy of god as long as they believe that word i can never get to them as long as that little family in eden keeps behind that word i can never touch them neither can he today amen he's still blocked off that's right but if i can use some real good strategy and just reason it out i give some human reasonings because she's human if i can just give human reasonings then well well we'll win the battle satan and his angels but then eve gave away so therefore we know our enemy by his attacks maybe you didn't get it just right the way i said it we know our enemy when anyone any spirit any person tries to disagree with god's word are we in agreement remember that's your enemy that's your enemy he says it again we know his old attack that's the one he broke the human race down with and that's the way he breaks them down yet today and that's the way he gets you away from god is to disbelieve his word and the only way that you can ever stay in fellowship with god and talk to him in the cool the evening is to stay fortified in the word on both sides let the curtain of god's word drop all around you and be a drop right in the middle of it that's right then you're fortified another message you would see well what's my subject it's the conflict i'm just laying it foundation and then we'll we'll parachute quick i'm not going to keep you a long time the conflict satan tries to get you to reason about it and don't you do it you'll probably hear be sick of these quotes about not reasoning but you will never say that nobody told you and don't you do it but after you become a christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word didn't know i was going to say that i'm just going to say it again but after you become a christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word remember last week when i read that quote about no man has a right to preach the gospel unless first he's met god face to face and then he says and no person has the right to call themselves a christian unless they've met god face to face on the sacred sand so then he says once you become a christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word you are when you become a christian you're placed behind the word of god now there's your fortress your safety oh my every promise in that is yours only thing you have to do is just reach and get it and go right on with it how you know it's going to work i don't know how it's going to work i don't know the only thing i know that god gave his children the best attack that they could have and the best thing to attack with because he knows the working of the enemy this message is the most powerful weapon on the face of the earth the devil hates this message with everything that he's got he's throwing reason in your mind he's throwing reason at your family he's throwing reason at the church he's throwing reason at somebody you know because he hates this message with everything that he's got why because it is the attack that god gave the bride in this age there is no other weapon that will defeat him in this stage but the message of this age it can't come another way it's not going to be in another time it didn't come in years past we didn't miss it but it's right here right now the weapon of this age will defeat the enemy of this age there is no other way for him to be defeated you will not defeat him mind over matter or by intellectual conceptions or by if that was the case we could all just go move to dallas and go to church with brother joel but it's not by our thinking or by our intellectuals but it's by the word of god and god has a season for the word to come out and be revealed and i believe we are living in the season of revelation and i believe we are in the season of a manifested word where it's not just words on a page or some testimonies of a kentuckian but it's right now in a flesh life where we can walk it and we can talk it and we can feel it and we can touch it and we see it happening in our life one step at a time of course the devil's against us of course he's raging against us with everything it's not just you sitting there it's me and it's your neighbor it's the one next to you and the one thing that we all have in common is the devil is trying to fight us right now in this moment why because he's scared of what you possess he's not scared of you he's not scared of your words he's not scared of your your power or your strength he's scared of what you possess and what you possess is the vindicated word of god in this hour there is nothing that scares him more than that now maybe i'm going a little fast here but that just energizes me because i know that despite my mistakes despite my faults or my insecurities or my inabilities this word will prevail no matter what this word will overcome every devil no matter what this word has already defeated every enemy even death itself and what do we have to fear if death is defeated there's nothing else to fear because we know where we're going if he should come and take me today i'm not afraid of death because it's just a gateway to the fulfillment of this word this word trumps all this word goes before everything and he gave it to the church the word why did he give it to the church because the word is eternal and if god made a promise that is eternal there's nothing nowhere can stop it turn every atom upside down and turn it backwards could never pierce the word of god one little word see because jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail see it's the best weapon there is it's the word of the eternal god now what is the word of god the word of god is god himself so god gave the believer himself amen it's god himself he gave the believer himself to attack the enemy by in other words he's the father and the word is god then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing in the forefront of his children there you are he's standing out there for his children what are we scared about the rapture is sure the coming is sure every blessing that's been promised us is ours it all belongs to us i take that and i'll run with it i'll take that and i'll i'll defeat every enemy in front of me and if it didn't get him the first time i'll just whack him again with it every promise is mine every chapter every verse every line every promise is mine and if he doesn't move just hit him with it again and if he doesn't move just hit him with it again because you know this word will prevail despite your own inabilities despite your own flaws this word will prevail against the gates of hell they tried to come against it and they tried everything they had but it's already been proven that this word wins every time so if we're fortified behind the word we can't lose if we're fortified behind the word there's nothing that can stop this move there's nothing that can stop the bride because we are fortified behind the greatest the greatest weapon that there ever has been on the earth and it is the weapon of this word it's not just gentle and meek and kind but it has a double-edged sword in it and it will cut down every enemy that stands within your path it will cut down every every reason in your mind every imagination that it will cast down it will cut down every foe that you're fighting in your life today i know because it's fulfilled in this hour that's the very thing our faith is based on that the word will overcome oh satan might say come around over on this side and i'll reason it out with you uh oh you got behind the father then see don't you do that you stay right there where the father stands right where it says it's thus saith the father see thus saith my father thus saith my father it's going to defeat him as sure as the world it's got to all right but when you get out from behind that like eve did the battle is lost now poor eve she listened she lost her place she got out from behind the fortress now you think about that and just put it into it put it into something that we can make tangible and and we have a we have a fort that is impenetrable there's no way you can get in there's no way that you can overcome it there's no way that you can break through the gate there's no way they've tried and tried and tried to try but but as soon as we step out from that fortress as soon as we step out from that fort then we're out from under the protection of it we're just out there vulnerable and we're just on our own and it's real quick we find out how weak we are when we step out from under the word when i would try to do good evil is always present and as soon as i slack off on the things of god boom it seems like i just go right back to where i was before now i'm not just saying that about you that's our that's our walk but see he says it's your mind that opens the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's true these battles has raged since the day of the garden of eden the battle of the human mind satan started it what did he do when he met eve he he didn't deny god's word but he whitewashed it he stopped up some little channels here somewhere he said he said but surely god had not said stopped up some little channels somewhere got in the way just a little put a bit of a little log in the way and and and and and dammed up our our our walk with god and he put a little blockage there in the channel remember i think we referenced that last week about the message getting in the spirit brother graham says you got to blow the logs out of the channel you got to clear out every log in the channel and you got to you sometimes you got to dig pretty deep to clear out your old your old affections and your old imagination and your old reasons you got to dig pretty deep and and brother branham would bring in the scripture uh dig this valley full of ditches right and he would say that that jehoshaphat there he was he was partnered up with the king of israel uh jeroboam i think it was or jerome and and they came together in a partnership now one of them was a righteous man and one of them was just a hypocrite pretending to have the faith right we're not going to go back and read it i know we all know the story and so they end up unevenly yoked on this venture together and and a lot of times that's how it works when you're a good righteous person and there'll be somebody there that wants to attach on to that because they know that that you're righteous and god will hear you and so they'll attach themselves onto you but in reality they're just bringing you down and so you got to be mindful of that when we walk through life and maybe that was for you young brothers here or somebody out there but but you can't be unevenly yoked and walk in the perfect will of god and so they find themselves out in the desert and they find themselves in and and they've gone out on this trip and they've they've prepared and they've thought about battle and they've brought their weapons and they brought their swords and they brought everything that they could think of to get out there and battle but you know what they forgot one thing and it was the water they started out an adventure through the desert and they forgot to pack water for them and for their camels and for their animals and there they are out in the middle of nowhere and they've run out of water and sometimes that's how we end up in our own spiritual walk is we'll have made it seven days journey like they did and then they realized we don't have water and a lot of times we'll come to church and we'll play the part and we'll we'll sing the songs and we say amen but then we find out i don't really have the holy spirit with me or it's i left it back somewhere i don't have it like i used to have it or i i realized that i have i need more of it and so they found themselves in that condition and and we know the whole story won't go through it and they call on the word of the the prophet of the lord and he comes and there's so much there to preach on but we'll just we'll just get to the point he says make this valley full of ditches now that doesn't make sense in your reason that doesn't make sense in your mind that you would go out and use the last little bit of strength you have to go out and dig holes in the middle of the desert but that's what the prophet said to do and then brother branham would use a type of of a soldier going out there and he would begin to he began to dig out his ditch and he says there he would find an old coffee pot or an old tea kettle or or some old thing an old cobblestone down there that was from prior civilizations now we might just read over that but it really talks a lot about our struggle in life there's a lot of things in there that we didn't put there we didn't put that coffee pot in there we didn't put that cobblestone in there but here's this soldier is he's digging down in the dirt and he's hitting things that he didn't bury there but he's got to dig him out of the way to have a clear channel and so maybe you didn't put that mind battle in there and you inherited it and you and you got it somewhere and you picked it up along the way and you never planted it in there but you have to dig it out you have to take a shovel and you got to dig it out by the word of god because there's no other way he said if you just dig if you just dig this much that's all the water you're going to have but if you can dig this much then that's all the water you can have you can be full of the water but if we're not full of the spirit of god we've got to get the shovel out does that make sense if we're not full of the spirit of god like we want to be we got some more digging to do we have some more things to surrender we got some more self-will to give up we gotta we gotta dig down a little deeper now it's not your fault you you were born with that maybe you were born with that nervous spirit or you were you were born with that that depression upon you but you've got to dig it out you can't just leave it there it's stopping your water from flowing it's stopping your revival from coming we've got to take the shovel of the word of god and dig it out now i know that's that's a rough analogy but that's the way the prophet brought it we've got to make the valley full of ditches and you know what happened they dug it out and they dug it out and they toiled with it and they ward with it and the next day when they woke up the whole valley was full of water why because they surrendered their self-will to the word of god they surrendered what they thought was the right thing to do to what the prophet of god said to do and it ought he god honored that move by filling that full of water we we know the rest of the story that when the kings their enemies looked out upon him they just saw seas of red and i think that's a prime example of how when the enemy looks at us he cannot see past the blood of christ as long as we stay in this fortress as long as we stay behind the word he can't see us he can't get to us he can't touch us there's nothing he can do to us because we're under the fortress of the word of god but we've got to make a total surrender it's no coincidence that we're seeing a second crucifixion of the word of god in this age a total surrender it's not going to be any different than it was when you could just imagine how christ what he must have heard going down the the road of golgotha and and and all the things that were said and people that maybe had followed him and heard him preach and and were there for the miracles and they ate the bread with the five thousand and they were lepers that were healed and they were they were they were blind that could see and there they see him dragging his cross down the road and and they would say see i i told you he wasn't a prophet i told you that he was just a man and i told you it was just emotion or it was just a sensation and and there he is dragging his cross fulfilling the very thing that they're speaking about it's no it's no coincidence that we're facing the same thing in this hour i told you it was just some emotion or it was just a lot of hype or there was no factual things behind it and the very people that that maybe were blessed by the message of the hour coming are now turning their back on it why because it was prophesied that they'll crucify him again but there were people that still recognized them as the coming christ as the christ that was bearing the sins of the world that was taking them to the cross that would be their eternal destination they were watching their eternal ticket walk down the road of galgotha they couldn't carry it they couldn't bear it but it was the word becoming manifest and i see that in this day i see this message being my eternal ticket over there there is nowhere else i can look to there is nowhere else i'm interested in hearing from but i know that i came in contact when i recognized this as eagle food i came in contact with a supernatural being that is a me that's somewhere out there that i know that god had in his mind before the foundation of the world and when i came into this message that made contact with me and no matter what devil tries to break that out of me you cannot take that from me why because i've overcome that choice this is the truth if god puts me in hell tomorrow this is the truth i will stand on this word there is nowhere else there is not another foundation there is nowhere else to run to i'm not going to be reasoned out of it why because i was given a revelation before there ever was a mind to battle before there ever was a battleground chosen this word was put in my heart the devil can try a real believer cannot run from this he can't walk away you can try you can backslide you can back up you can sin you can you can depart from the ways you can run from your parents you can run this way you could but you cannot leave this word because god will not lose a one he cannot forget them he has not forsaken them there is not a prodigal out there that he can't touch there is not a situation out there that he can't reach down and just at any moment activate that gene scene in that person he did it for me friends i wasn't looking for him when he activated it in me i was running i was a hypocrite i was looking for anything but this life and he came down and activated that seat in me why because he won't lose one he can't it's part of him they're just as much part of him as as this is my arm i'm not going to forget about it i don't know i know where it's at all the time and he knows exactly where you are you might be looking to run the opposite direction but god has other plans for you and when god interrupts your plans it's a supernatural event all reason cast down all imagination casts down your affections cast down no wonder why we're fighting such a battle in this age with affections the bible speaks about it man turning away from natural affections and many of it's sneaking into the church now maybe it might get a little a little tight a little rough here but but it's got to be preached about it somebody's got to take a stand i'm not just going to put it back on the prophet and push play let him say it but i'll i'll take the same stand he's he stood for because i believe it is the word and we cannot let that little devil come in here and just make us slide a little bit when did the men of god be more concerned about how they look than how they approach the father when did we become more concerned about about fitting in with the fashion world it's not just on the women it's in men wearing designers that are owned by homosexual people and and wearing clothes that are designed by by perverted spirits and it snuck his way into the church and to our young people and and and we just deal with it i'm not going to deal with that i'm going to preach the gospel i'm going to preach the truth and even if it hurts my own flesh and blood i'm gonna preach the truth of this gospel we shouldn't lighten up we shouldn't let up we shouldn't it's not time to let off the gloves it's not time to to let the pressure up but it's time to preach the word without favor without natural affection our affection turning from from from from having an affection towards god towards anything else anything that exalteth itself above the lord we've got to overcome that affection we've got to overcome that reason it's time to draw the king out of the cave i like how joshua did it put your foot right on the neck of that you know why because once can you imagine being the other four men of war that he called and the first one comes up and he grabs the king of jerusalem out of there and he throws him on the ground and he puts his foot on their neck and the other four say you can do that you can put him under your foot you can take that mighty king that that we've been running from and we've been scared of and we've been afraid of and you can put them under your foot oh yeah and those other four i bet ran up to those other kings and grabbed him i got something to say to you i know i've been battling you for 33 years this reason and this imagination and this affection it's time for you to come under my foot i don't know how old everybody else in here but that's how long i've been battling mine we got to put them under our feet and say i'm surrendering everything that i am i want to get rid of every bit of self-will the power of your choice has held you back from a complete victory i can say that from my own experience the power if you would have chose that years ago you'd be so much further down the road and i know there's veterans in here and elder people but if the shoe doesn't fit just say amen we've got to surrender our self-will it's the only thing that'll liberate us it's the only thing that'll free us we're never going to just wake up one day and be satisfied with our own our own ambitions or our own goals or our own imaginations we're not it's not just going to change that way but we've got to surrender our self-will to god's will if we can surrender what we want to what he wants you can wake up and say his mercies are new today his mercies are new today i feel the goodness of god in my life i feel his presence all around me why because your will is dead i know that hurts us tonight it's the hardest thing that we have to do is to kill our own will but it's the only way we're gonna make it i know if you think i'm taking off my jacket means i'm going long but i'm not we've got to possess every gate now we're not going to do it by our own power we're not going to do it by i'm just going to push through this i'm going to i'm going to prevail through this i'm going to fast for two weeks and i don't care what it takes i'm going to overcome this but if we could just make a surrender if we could say god i want to make a total surrender to you i want to take humility like i've never taken it on before that's the hardest thing i think for us old-time christians to do is take on the real humility and say you know what i need more of god i might have been coming to church and sitting in a pew for 40 years i need more of god i've got to have more of his spirit i've got to i've got to have more of him making my decisions i've got to have liberty because if there's not liberty then you might as well give me death if if i can't have liberty in my walk with god if i can't have liberty to praise him no wonder why their spirits coming against the movement of the spirit in the church and saying that we can't have liberty in our worship and that we're only allowed to sing these songs and we're not allowed to play drums and we're not allowed to clap and we're not allowed to sing and we're not allowed to say hallelujah no wonder why there's a spirit coming against it because it hates liberty it hates liberation in the children of god and i rebuke that spirit in the name of the lord jesus christ to say that you cannot have my liberty you cannot take my freedom you can lock me up into jail like paul and silas but you will not take my praise you will not take my worship you will not take my song even if you if you bind me up in chains i'll sing till the walls come down why because i know who my maker is and you and your jail and your chains are no match for him they are no match and he does he he deserves more worship now in my situation chained to the wall put yourself in paul's shoes standing for his word oh you think he would just come down with a shout and just grab paul before they captured him and there he is in jail chained to the wall he says you know what silas god's been so good to us i can just imagine paul and silas there just just sharing testimonies of god just a little chorus come up hmm how sweet [Music] the sound and then silas chime in that had saved like me i once was lost but now i'm found oh i was blind remember this is paul singing but now i see and they can just hear and the walls begin to shake and the other prisoners begin to what's going on around us and what's happening around us but what was happening was the son of god was making contact with his maker he deserves the praise no matter what spirits you're you're fighting he deserves the praise no matter what much you're crawling through he deserves the praise no matter what affliction you're fighting today he deserves our praise and no spirit is gonna take that from me no no no person is going to dictate to me how i praise my god because he deserves everything that i can give him [Music] and we know they went free why because their chains were gone that song broke right through their chains my if we could just try that friends if we could just get out of our comfort zone in the way that we're comfortable worshiping and in the way that we're we just have a limit and that's as far as we'll go but if we could ever break past that god will break every chain that we have if we could ever get past the way that we're comfortable worshiping the lord he will break every bind that we have he will break every chain he will break every wall he will even tear down the stronghold of the enemy and others around us will go free it wasn't just paul and silas that escaped but everybody around him broke free out of that jail why because the praises of god will break free from every yoke of this world if we could just get past our comfort zone and say god you're worthy no matter what i'm going through you're worthy give me liberty or give me death i don't want to just walk this way and crawl my way through and just wowzy wowzy woo and woe is me and maybe i'm going to make it and tomorrow i'm not even a christian and the next day i come to church and maybe i'm gonna make it no but give me liberty or give me death let me know who i am let me know where i stand let me have a revelation to see that my eyes are open and though he should slay me yet i'll trust him though he should cast me in hell yet i'll love him because i know that he is my maker and there is none beside him no one else is going to get my praise with him he deserves every breath that we are oh david would say let everything that have breath praise ye the lord because he recognized my mistakes it doesn't matter what my mistakes are they're going to happen tomorrow but he deserves my praise he deserves my praise he's always on time paul and silas weren't worried they weren't afraid that he wasn't on schedule but right in that moment he showed up on time and and no brick wall stopped him no chain stopped him no guard stopped him but when god wants to wake up that seed when god wants to make a supernatural meeting with you there's no building that can stop him there's no spirit that can stop him there's no there's no demon in hell that can stop him there's nothing that can stop god from reaching one of his children we got to recognize who we are say lord i'm your child i have need of you i'm in a situation i don't know how to get around it i don't know how to get through it i've tried to ignore it i've tried to set it aside but it still keeps coming back just sing his praises and watch him show up on the scene [Applause] it works every time it's never failed it will bring him on the scene without fail he's always on schedule you think he should have showed up years ago you think he should have showed up months ago before you said that thing or before this took place he should have showed up but he's always on schedule the three hebrew children are walking into the fire thinking surely god's gonna come blow this out surely god's gonna come make a way or we're gonna we're gonna jog off to the right at the last second and we're gonna miss it but there they go into the fire think about it they're believing trusting that he's he's the heavenly father he's a supernatural god thinking anything's possible the fire could just extinguish the door could just blow off the place there could be a there could be a a a wall just break loose and we run but no he's always on schedule there they are the three three hebrew children about to take that step past their reason pass their affection pass their self-will oh he never promised that the cross would not get heavy that the hill would not be hard to climb he never offered our victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says given they could have bowed right there and it would have been all over just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again he's never missed an appointment friends he's never laid he's always on schedule and you think that they take that last step into the fire this is it and they prepared to meet their maker little did they know he'd come in a way that they never expected him to come and how many men did you throw in that fire well we only put three well i see four and the fourth one is in the likeness of the son of god whom they never had met before he had never walked on the earth before but they recognized that presence is a supernatural presence friends he's never late you might think he forgot about you you might think he's forsook your situation but he's right on time but look what it required from the three hebrew children total surrender total surrender how did they know he was going to show up i can't explain how but i know he said he'll be there i'll not leave you i'll not forsake you i'll be with you even in you a total surrender you know we make a total surrender it puts us in the most the most dangerous place that we can be to fight the devil the devil hates it when we can make a total surrender why because we have nothing to lose i don't have anything to lose i i don't have nowhere to go back to i'm not fighting to go backwards i have nowhere to retreat from but i've made a total surrender and me fighting as if i have nothing to lose makes me very dangerous to the devil because i can stand on every promise without fear without failure without discouragement without doubt because i know that there's nowhere to go back to i've burned every bridge behind me i've laid it all down i'm going onward though he saved me yet i'll trust him jesus didn't come to the potentates and the kings and the priests he came to men who had nothing to lose he came to fishermen who didn't have clothes he he came to men who didn't know their name they couldn't read they couldn't ride he said those are the guys i want i resemble that remark those are the guys i want maybe we're not worth nothing in this life but god came he said those are the people that i want those people that can fight like they have nothing to lose those people that can come into a battle and never look back they can never just like joshua i want to note that these five kings were drawn out on the same day that joshua set for the sun to stand still can you imagine the faith that was built up in the troops of god that man just told the sun to stand still and it obeyed it should be tomorrow by now and the sun is still in the air well let me say to you that the sun is still in the air he's still there he's still working on your behalf and though you can't see him he's working and though you can't feel him he's working just hold your position hold the line don't give up right those three hebrew children could have taken a knee right there at the threshold and and they could have went back but you see they had nothing to lose what were they going to go back to being in bondage what are you going to go back to friend the devil dictating to you how your life's going to go and you're going to be strung out on this prescription to the next day and what are you gonna go back to there's only one way for a real christian there's not backwards there's not right there's not left there's only one direction we're going and it's onward satan would love to destroy that revelation you have you're going to fight it tomorrow i guarantee i'm just going to apologize on my behalf for bringing it to you you're going to fight it tomorrow i guarantee it but hold your position don't move an inch don't back up an inch don't back up don't don't give him a quarter of an inch but hold the line right there and he'll know that you really came in contact with that revelation that will liberate you from every fear that he has oh he's fighting with everything that he's got church he wants us to stay back and he wants us to hold back why because we will destroy him with this revelation the word is in me the word cannot fail the word has already defeated you boo devil blue devil remember the story the guy said the devil get closer to him and he would say boo and he'd get bigger and he'd get afraid and he'd get bigger and then finally he said boo devil the devil gets smaller that's just a silly illustration to some of us but it's reality friends boo devil oh you think you had me but i got news you think you had me in a corner but i've got nothing to lose i've got everything to gain by defeating you everything that i love is on the other side of you so you better watch out devil because i have the best weapon that there is to defeat you i have a weapon that's already it knows your weak spot it can poke you right there you you came against the wrong son of god you came against the wrong person wandering through this age because this weapon we'll defeat him every time any place anywhere we've got to recognize who we are we've got to make a total surrender we've got to surrender everything that we are we could just turn to the book of luke as we're trying to close he says if i believe i believe if a man ever come in contact with christ all the devils out of hell will never make him deny it again if you just imagine you got there it's something different but you know no matter how much disfigured i'll ever be i'm a human that's right because i was born a human and if you ever get christ in your heart you're a christian you're a son of god a daughter of god it makes you act different look different walk different talk different associate in different parties amen you'll never forget it if you ever make contact with him you believe that to be the truth i know we do praise the lord and the 23rd verse the 9th chapter and the 23rd verse and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me how many times have we read right over that verse and not really taking it into context if any man follow me let him deny himself my that's hard to do oh it's a hard it's a hard hurdle to deny your own self-will to deny everything that gears you and and everything that moves you and and to look past what you feel and what you see and but you know what you've got nothing to lose where are you going to go back to what are you going to turn to who else has the words of eternal life peter would say where else are we gonna go but to this rock are we gonna we're gonna find a way through our own math and our own skills and our own science and our own intellect we'll never find it that way but he said if any man follows me let him deny himself daily take up your cross and follow me i believe that's our commission in this age deny ourselves cast down every imagination and every reason and every affection and take up our cross and follow him not just not just walk into battle but be fearless in battle abraham said when joshua recognized who he was he was fearless in every situation when david recognized who he was he was fearless in every situation when shane recognized who he was he was fearless in every situation when brian recognized who he was he was fearless in every situation when mariah recognized who she was she was fearless in every sin why because god's word cannot change it won't be different for you than it was for david it won't be different for you than it was for joshua i believe with my whole heart if a child of god needed the son to stand still in this hour he could say son stand still and it would obey him why because we're back to the same authority we're back to the same word we're back to the same revelation that joshua had do not let the words of the prophet depart out of your mouth be strong very courageous and i will give you the lamb be strong and very courageous and i will give you your healing i will give you salvation i will give you your family it's a promise from god in this hour that we can walk fearlessly into every battle that we go into passed our doubt past our imagination past our fear why because we've surrendered our self-will invincible army does not mean that you won't be hit at right right she will be in invincible army doesn't mean that he's not going to hit us it just means that whatever he hits us with will not stop us because we cannot be stopped because we are invincible and if if we are invincible then what do we have to fear brother brahma will say you can't lose once you get that revelation you can't lose there's nothing that can take that from you remember remember in that meeting brother branham would would pray for those two sisters no they wouldn't get in the prayer line they were in the shadow uh trying to get in the shadow of him as he was staying in the hotel right so he walks they were planning on him walking by and they were going to be healed in his shadow like peter but instead he finds him there in the parking lot of the hotel and he says what can you sisters what what can i do for you say well we couldn't get a prayer card and we couldn't make it the line and she's got you know i think it was mental illness and she's got mental illness and he said uh well let me pray for you and he began to pray and he got a vision he said thus say the lord you'll be healed and right then in that moment she was healed and you know what they began to do they began to testify about it they began to go share with this one and that one and say we met him in the parking lot and he pronounced healing and i can think clearly for the first time in years and i've been delivered from that spirit and they began to testify and then two men came to him in the parking lot and they said we're from the fbi remember we're from the fbi and and and and we're we're here to to expose william branham as a false prophet this isn't anything new we're facing friends we're here to expose william branham as a false prophet and and you've been testifying about your healing and you know it really wasn't that way and and we're going to use that testimony against him and you better stop testifying if you love him because we're going to use that against him and what is it's a fear tactic of the devil stop testifying about what god's done for you stop testifying about what he's doing and and what you believe he's going to do because it's really going to bring a reproach upon your faith of course the devil's going to tell you that friends but you know what they did brother branham happened to be walking through the parking lot and they were packing their car and he said well what are you doing he said we're leaving the meeting we're so sorry we're so sorry that we did that to you we're so sorry that we we testified so much till we got you in trouble and he said well what are you talking about what are you talking about well there's two guys from the fbi here and they're gonna they're gonna they say they're gonna expose you and and you're just a fake but we know it's the truth because she was healed and and we're so sorry to bring that reproach upon you and and and she said i i hope you're not mad and brother bam said no why would i be mad he said the devil's mad the devil's upset because you got your healing and and he said let the fbi come you know why because he didn't have anything to lose he said let him come investigate me you know what happened later that night he was in service and he said there's two men here and you're claiming to be the fbi and you're claiming to expose me tonight he said but you're two backslidden preachers that have gotten away from the will of god that have gotten away from the things of god and you're trying to scare people out of this meeting he said come down here and face me you know what they wouldn't come they wouldn't come face him why because he had nothing to lose he was a vindicated word prophet he knew that god told him it was thus saith the lord it was not his word but it was god's word through his lips if we could get the same revelation in our life to know that we have nothing to lose let the fbi come and investigate me come on let him investigate you come on fbi what i have nothing to lose come on devil what are you gonna expose me as a fraud you can expose me as a fake i have nothing to lose because i know that god called me i know that god filled me with the spirit i know that god placed me in this age to defeat you upon your own battleground you chose the battleground and i'm going to defeat you on this battleground because i have thus saith the lord that's a quote the bride will have thus saith the lord why because she stands upon every word she stands upon every promise and though the gates of hell will come against me they shall not prevail why because they already lost the battle once and they'll lose it again friends we've been made more than conquerors in this hour let the enemy come let the winds assail there was demons on every wave that cast up in the boat but you know what he said we'll crest every one of them by the word of god we're promised people with the promised word in a promised hour god's not missed us he's not late he keeps his schedule every time and just when it looks like you're going down in the battle he shows up [Music] the prophet of god would call him our captain of deliverance just when it looks like there's no other way he shows up but we've got to get rid of this old mind we've got to get rid of this whole this whole temper this old imagination this old conscious this old reason we've got to clean it out get the shovel of god's word out and dig it out we got to make more room for him i say less of me and more of him dig out every unbelief dig out every doubt every maybe you've prayed for things for years and years and years and to the point where you you feel discouraged in your mind hold the line god will show up right on time he has not forgotten your prayer prayers do not expire but hold the line and keep fast to that faith he will show up he will deliver that's not my words that's a promise that's an eternal promise of the father he will show up on time parents don't give up on your kids there's nowhere they can go that's too far there's nowhere that's too deep you might think that they've said too much but what is that to god when he comes and he changes that heart that's your understanding of it that's not god's don't lose faith on them hold the line hold the line of this word don't cave don't compromise don't back up hold the line friends we've been given a perfect word we we we were given a perfect profit in a perfect age so that makes us perfect overcomers we have to have battles to overcome we have to have trials to be victorious we have to have sickness to be healed we have to have been lost to be saved we have to have had a self-will to make a surrender i choose now lord take it out lord take out my own decisions and my own reason and my own will and take out my own ambitions and take out my own my own what i think would be would be liberating give me your liberty give me liberty in your word give me liberty in your spirit i i want to worship you like i never have i i don't want to do the same thing expecting different results but i want to reach past what i feel i want to look to an unseen realm we could just stand to our feet tonight if we can fight every battle like we have nothing to lose you know that poor that poor woman was beat up abused nobody nobody thought she'd ever make anything of herself nobody thought she'd ever succeed she'd ruined her life she'd thrown it away but she heard of a jesus who could forgive sins now you think about that in your own reason there's a man walking and some say that he's beelzebub and some say that he's just a false prophet and some say he's just a good man and some say he has good morals but some say he can forgive sins and she takes everything that she has she burned every bridge she took every penny she had this isn't about money it's about your self-will and she dumped it all out she said fill up that box with oil we know the story but she goes it wasn't an easy road she takes the box she walks into the house and there all her critics are and there he is at the other end of the house and she has to take that box and walk past every critic saying who knows what calling her who knows what bringing down every condemnation she's overcoming her her her imagination her conscience her memories she's overcoming everything one step at a time why because she sees something at the other end of the room i've got to get to that jesus i've got to get to him i need to lay aside everything that they're saying everything that i'm remembering you don't think every spirit in hell was raging against her to try to stop her from making it across that room i've got to get to jesus and when she gets to him maybe in her mind she thought i'd say she'd say i'm sorry or she'd say forgive me or if thou be or you know when she got there she got into his presence she didn't have words there was nothing she could bring to say but overcoming all of those affections and all of those reasons and all of those memories by the time she got to his presence she was so overwhelmed all she could do was weep all she could do was weep at his feet being in that august presence knowing that all of those memories all of those imaginations just like that had been forgiven she washed his feet she poured out everything that she owned everything that she was she poured out on his feet she began just weeping and washing his feet and i love you jesus i praise you jesus something that nobody had done before this wasn't she wasn't following a pattern but she was really getting into the spirit of worship and there he brings out her accusers and then he says those words of eternal life to her thy sins which are many are all forgiven the greatest thing we can do is overcome our self-will friends i hope i hope it made sense tonight and you can you can take something to heart from this we are chosen to do this this isn't a maybe or i think you can do it but you're chosen to overcome the greatest enemy that you have and that's you you're chosen to overcome it you've been given the weapons to overcome it you've been given a gene seed i believe it's time to deal with the kings in the cave i've had enough of it i've had enough of my imaginations and my reason and my i had enough of the devil i believe that it's time that the children of god take the sword it is also written it is also written it is also written you know what you do that a few times and that devil's gonna leave you know why because he's recognizing who you are as you come into authority you're saying i know where i'm at devil you can you can make me sick you can you can battle my mind you can bring rain on me you can make it a cloudy day but i know i know where i'm going friends it's time i believe we're at the closing hours i believe we all know that we can feel it in the air i believe that's why the word of god is coming at a greater anointing than it ever has come i believe that it will we are we are breaking in to that short quick work don't misjudge the time deal with it now amen if we could just bow our heads jesus we love you lord father we thank you for all that you've done father and all that you're all that you promised to do god we hold fast to every promise in your book father every promise in your word lord but more than that you came to us in this age father god while there's

[Music] let us die to ourself tomorrow and the next day in the next father let us die to our self-will oh god let us let's not let that king back in the cave i believe the spirit has provoked him out tonight let's just put our foot right on his neck place authority over the top of of our mind you said we could have a sound mind you said we could overcome every battle on on whatever battleground it might be and this might be satan's battleground but by the authority of the word of god we will win every battle we will we will defeat every foe because we are the invincible army god you never said it wouldn't come without price you never said it couldn't it wouldn't come without pain but lord you said we'd make it on the other side oh god father may we make a total surrender to you lord forgive our own our own wants father may we just cling stronger to your word father than ever lord take my own my own ambitions father and give me yours lord may we just be like those saints of faith lord oh god some of them bound with chains and some of them with their back up against the wall but lord sometimes it takes that moment for us to realize that you are our answer lord may we look to you tonight father in our situation god i pray for every situation lord if we have a a special need i pray we can raise our hand tonight lord you recognize that situation lord no doubt we've tried to get around it no doubt we've tried to to battle our own way through it but i believe your presence is here in this building lord and i i pray that these saints of god would draw their sword of faith would draw the sword of the word and would proclaim liberty over every situation in their life that they would proclaim victory lord over every discouragement that they're facing because god you are a prayer answering god you have not forgotten us lord you have not forsaken us but you are right on schedule and lord i believe you'll show up right in the moment of crisis lord let us hold the line tonight with our swords drawn looking for you is our answer lord i would just commit these things to you lord i ask that you would just lord connect it all together we pray lord forgive your servant
