[40:07] chapter 2 verse 1.
[40:10] and it says and you hath he quickened
[40:15] who were dead in sin or in
[40:18] trespasses and sin
[40:22] i want you to notice the condition that
[40:24] we were in
[40:25] we were dead where in kind
[40:28] past ye walked
[40:31] according to the course of this world
[40:36] according to the prince of the power of
[40:39] the air
[40:41] the spirit that now worketh in
[40:45] the children of disobedience well why
[40:48] doesn't it work
[40:49] in you anymore because you're no longer
[40:53] a child of disobedience
[40:56] so if you're not a child of disobedience
[40:58] then that would mean you are a child of
[41:01] obedience obedience to what
[41:04] the word of god and when you're a child
[41:08] of obedience
[41:09] then the spirit of god is what works
[41:12] through your life amen look at this in
[41:15] verse three i like this
[41:17] among whom also we had our
[41:21] conversation that's our character our
[41:23] conduct
[41:24] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[41:29] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[41:32] and of the mind notice how paul brings
[41:34] these together fulfilling the desires of
[41:37] the flesh
[41:38] and of the mind the mind being the soul
[41:41] and whereby nature the
[41:44] children of wrath even
[41:48] as others
[41:52] but here's the difference but god
[41:56] amen but god who is rich in mercy
[42:01] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[42:05] even when we were dead in sins
[42:09] hath quickened us together with christ
[42:12] by grace ye are saved
[42:15] and hath raised us up together
[42:18] and made us sit together
[42:21] in heavenly places in christ
[42:25] jesus that in the ages to come
[42:28] he might show the exceeding riches of
[42:30] his grace
[42:32] and his kindness toward us through
[42:34] christ jesus
[42:36] for by grace are ye saved
[42:39] through faith and that not of yourselves
[42:43] it is the gift of god
[42:47] not of works lest any man
[42:50] should boast for we are
[42:54] his workmanship created in christ
[42:58] jesus unto good works which god
[43:01] hath before ordained that we should walk
[43:04] in them
[43:06] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[43:08] of the word as you're being seated
[43:12] i want to just i want to speak to you
[43:14] this morning
[43:16] we've been dealing with operating by the
[43:19] faith
[43:20] of the hour
[43:24] and if you haven't it'd
[43:27] probably be good for you to go back and
[43:29] listen to the message
[43:31] perfect faith
[43:35] brother banham deals with how that jesus
[43:38] walked
[43:39] in a world of perfect faith
[43:43] because he said he knew who he was
[43:46] and brother brown goes on to say he says
[43:50] that he relied upon what the word
[43:55] had made him then he comes back around
[43:58] he says
[43:59] can't we rely upon what the word
[44:03] has made us so it's bringing us back
[44:07] into a place as we were looking at that
[44:09] a little bit the last time
[44:11] how that love itself it takes love to
[44:14] bring faith it takes the love of god
[44:16] working on our lives now our love alone
[44:19] won't do it but it must be our lives
[44:21] being
[44:22] influenced directed and drawn
[44:26] by the love of god this is why even in
[44:29] these scriptures that we have read here
[44:31] and many other places in the scripture
[44:34] we recognize that it's a sovereign work
[44:37] of god it doesn't mean that we don't
[44:40] have anything to do
[44:42] but what it means is that we're not
[44:44] acting
[44:45] on our own but what it is is we're
[44:48] acting in obedience
[44:50] to the spirit of god who's dealing with
[44:52] our life so
[44:53] the reality is is what it comes down to
[44:56] it's
[44:56] it's us yielding and god
[44:59] doing that's the whole work
[45:03] of god dealing with the life bringing it
[45:05] into
[45:07] that of the new birth and then even from
[45:09] the new birth
[45:10] it doesn't stop it only continues on to
[45:13] the very change of the body
[45:16] it's a work that where you or i no
[45:18] matter who a person is can take
[45:20] credit for anything that we've done
[45:24] i like how brother branham says that at
[45:25] the end of god be with us where be all
[45:27] the miracles
[45:28] he said god if there's anything that
[45:31] you've been able to
[45:32] do through us he said it's because that
[45:35] you were able to override our rebellion
[45:39] and move through us now when you you
[45:42] look at that you
[45:43] realize in overriding our rebellion if
[45:46] it was not for god's grace coming and
[45:48] dealing with our life to where that we
[45:51] would surrender our our hearts and our
[45:54] lives
[45:56] we wouldn't surrender but it takes god
[45:59] to come
[46:00] and god to work in our life and that
[46:03] continues on
[46:04] in our walking and our journey and i
[46:06] want to i want to speak upon these
[46:08] thoughts we're just
[46:09] just building and i just how god just
[46:12] seems to be just
[46:13] moving within this and i want to speak
[46:15] on a redemption of sons and daughters
[46:19] because redemption itself as
[46:22] brother branham you you would hear those
[46:24] of you as you listen to the message and
[46:26] you see within scripture
[46:28] redemption itself has two parts to it
[46:32] first of all to redeem means to bring
[46:35] back to its rightful owner
[46:38] now very simply our old nature
[46:42] does not belong to god
[46:45] god doesn't god doesn't want he's not
[46:47] come to redeem
[46:49] the old nature that don't belong to him
[46:53] there's no way that adam could claim
[46:55] that cain
[46:56] was his are you with me
[47:00] but abel was so you see god when he
[47:02] comes in redemption there's a part that
[47:04] he's redeeming which is
[47:06] not the son of james and pat browning
[47:09] not the son of charles and elebrano
[47:12] not the son of so-and-so bales that's
[47:14] not what he's coming to redeem
[47:16] he's coming to redeem the son and
[47:19] daughter of god
[47:20] that is there on the inside but yet not
[47:24] in a living form yet
[47:28] redemption is to claim back your
[47:30] redemption is not how
[47:32] where you know sometimes it's thought to
[47:34] believe they sometimes will just take
[47:37] redemption in just a general term but
[47:38] redemption is actually
[47:40] bringing back what rightfully belongs to
[47:44] one
[47:44] and in order for that to come back to
[47:46] one there must be
[47:48] a satisfying of whatever debt or
[47:51] whatever lien
[47:52] whatever it is that's against it
[47:55] from keeping the owner to fully
[47:58] take possession of it but once that
[48:02] debt has been settled there's nothing
[48:06] to stop the owner
[48:09] from going to make claims on what
[48:12] belongs to him
[48:14] amen this is why
[48:17] brother branham would say it like this
[48:19] in redemption is two parts
[48:21] it says there's a the first part of it
[48:24] and once
[48:24] that i know it's very simple but it's
[48:27] coming out
[48:28] of and then it's entering
[48:31] into listen how he says this first he
[48:35] says
[48:36] you have to come out
[48:39] some people wants to bring the world in
[48:42] with them but you got to come
[48:46] out of the world to enter into christ
[48:48] notice
[48:49] you've got to come out of the world
[48:52] you have to come out of unbelief to
[48:56] enter into faith there cannot be
[49:00] one thing in your way to
[49:03] really have genuine faith you must
[49:06] absolutely
[49:07] leave everything that's contrary to the
[49:11] word of god
[49:12] behind to enter into faith you know
[49:15] sometimes i think
[49:17] these things are very simple we let the
[49:19] spirit of god and i i don't mean to make
[49:21] you understand when i say very simple
[49:23] i'm saying even as i read over this and
[49:25] i'm studying
[49:26] and there's things sometimes i come back
[49:28] over just moments before
[49:30] maybe you know coming out or the days
[49:32] before looking back over all of a sudden
[49:34] the spirit of god every time when he
[49:35] comes to anoint the word
[49:37] it doesn't become it doesn't become
[49:39] complicated
[49:40] it becomes more simple it's the things
[49:43] that god is showing to you and i
[49:46] so when we look at this leaving it
[49:48] behind we recognize
[49:50] how do you leave something behind is
[49:53] when you
[49:54] move from where you are toward
[49:57] and you're going somewhere you you can't
[50:00] stay
[50:00] in the same spot and say well i'm coming
[50:03] out of
[50:04] coming out of you're being drawn you're
[50:07] going
[50:07] somewhere and you've got to get your
[50:10] eyes looking to the one who's
[50:12] calling you and keep your eyes there
[50:14] satan's
[50:15] business is to distract your
[50:18] eyes and to get you looking and
[50:21] everything else
[50:22] but listen if you'll just look to him
[50:25] and you'll walk
[50:26] towards him you will find that the
[50:29] things that you
[50:30] thought to be impossible you will find
[50:34] is no longer baggage that you're
[50:36] carrying
[50:37] but you have left it behind why there's
[50:41] a greater
[50:42] pull that you are yielding to
[50:45] and it's god who's working to remove
[50:48] that
[50:48] in your life this is all part of
[50:52] redemption look
[50:53] when they got out in the wilderness they
[50:55] started to look around
[50:57] tests come every child of god who comes
[51:00] to every son of god
[51:01] who comes to god must first be chastened
[51:04] and tried
[51:05] god deals with our life he corrects us
[51:08] he even
[51:08] as we're coming in the journey and
[51:11] process of the new birth he's dealing
[51:13] with our life
[51:14] get rid of this let go of this and let
[51:16] go of that
[51:17] he's working in our life it's a child
[51:20] training that's going on
[51:22] is that right there's a school master of
[51:24] the holy spirit
[51:25] until we come to the faith so he's
[51:29] working in our life he's dealing with
[51:31] with our
[51:32] with our hearts you see when they got to
[51:34] a spot in the wilderness
[51:35] they finally come to a place they
[51:37] started looking
[51:39] back to egypt oh if we could only go
[51:42] back there
[51:43] oh it was so much easier but have you
[51:46] forgot about the taskmaster's whip
[51:49] have you forgot about the one who made
[51:51] you do things that you didn't want to do
[51:54] have you forgot about that labor and
[51:56] that toil and that servile
[51:59] condition you were in what you say
[52:01] what's happening
[52:02] they're already they're going back into
[52:04] that of egypt
[52:05] but there was joshua and caleb
[52:08] that even when the rest of them looked
[52:11] over in the land
[52:12] and they seen opposition and they seen
[52:15] obstacles
[52:16] joshua and caleb did not denounce the
[52:18] obstacles
[52:19] but they chose to focus on god
[52:22] who had brought them out that that same
[52:25] god
[52:26] was present to take them in this is
[52:29] where
[52:30] redemption it's a coming out of and it's
[52:33] a going
[52:33] and an entering into this is why every
[52:36] person
[52:37] who is sitting here this morning and
[52:40] every
[52:40] every every person must have their
[52:44] true exodus
[52:47] must have a real spiritual exodus
[52:51] within their life wherein that they come
[52:53] out of the world
[52:54] and separate from unbelief by faith
[52:58] and come into the faith of god where
[53:01] you're no longer an old
[53:03] creation amen you become a new creation
[53:08] now
[53:08] watch out the scripture will take this
[53:11] in second corinthians chapter 6 verse
[53:13] 14.
[53:14] notice this admonition paul here he is
[53:17] he's speaking you find
[53:19] in the book of corinthians you find
[53:21] ephesians on and on you'll find
[53:23] where paul here the spirit of god is
[53:25] dealing with hearts and lives that's
[53:27] already been placed
[53:28] has come into this adoption then you
[53:30] also find the spirit of god moving back
[53:33] for those that have not come into that
[53:35] position yet and god is working
[53:37] and ministering and then he also breaks
[53:40] over
[53:40] to in everything the word of god it
[53:43] never
[53:44] takes from you what god has placed in
[53:48] you
[53:48] the word of god only builds the
[53:51] confidence
[53:52] that god has already placed in you
[53:55] by the baptism of the holy ghost it's
[53:58] god this
[53:59] is why this is the true foundation
[54:02] of every believer is the faith of
[54:05] god operating in our life that's our
[54:08] foundation
[54:09] that's how as a believer we face every
[54:13] day
[54:14] life every circumstance we are facing it
[54:17] by the faith of god in our life even
[54:20] when we don't
[54:21] feel him even when we don't know what to
[54:24] do
[54:25] even when it seems like everything else
[54:27] is breaking
[54:28] loose all around us but it's the faith
[54:31] of god
[54:32] paul said it like this the love of god
[54:34] constrains us
[54:35] that means holds us together amen it is
[54:39] the love of god
[54:40] that is shed abroad in our hearts it's
[54:42] an anchor let me just say
[54:44] it's something you can't get away from
[54:48] because it's not something that you did
[54:52] it's what he has done
[54:55] this is why paul was saying this blessed
[54:58] hope we have as an anchor that enters
[55:02] into within the veil
[55:06] words it like this be ye not
[55:09] unequally yoked together with
[55:12] unbelievers
[55:13] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[55:17] with unrighteousness and what communion
[55:21] hath light with darkness and what
[55:24] concord this is agreement hath christ
[55:27] with beloved
[55:28] or what part hath he that believeth with
[55:31] an infidel
[55:32] paul in this these two scriptures he's
[55:34] talking about
[55:35] the company associates
[55:42] you see this is very important because
[55:45] a life that is starting out with god and
[55:48] god begins to deal with that heart
[55:51] you find that when you get this place to
[55:54] say
[55:54] well god's done something it can even
[55:58] listen to me
[55:58] it's even for those who have crossed
[56:01] over into the new birth
[56:03] this is why it's also important that you
[56:05] don't get around and among
[56:07] a bunch of unbelievers
[56:11] they start talking well you know this
[56:13] this is what they're saying about this
[56:15] disease and
[56:16] this is what they're saying about this
[56:18] listen don't
[56:19] listen don't look down on them that's
[56:21] all they know
[56:22] they're bound with the spirit of fear
[56:25] you're not you've not been given a
[56:28] spirit of fear
[56:30] you've been given wisdom to know what
[56:32] you don't have nothing to prove by
[56:34] standing there
[56:35] well i'm going to tell them this i'm
[56:36] going to tell them that there's a listen
[56:38] to me brother man talks about the holy
[56:40] spirit
[56:40] the way even god's working in your life
[56:43] it starts to move like a little buzzer
[56:45] that's going up
[56:48] that means get out of there
[56:50] [Music]
[56:55] get out of there it's company it's
[56:58] associates
[56:59] this is why as god well let me just go
[57:01] on and read here
[57:03] and maybe we'll come to some things
[57:04] verse 16
[57:06] what agreement look at this agreement
[57:08] half the temple of god
[57:10] with idols what do you do with idols
[57:14] get them out you got to get them out of
[57:17] the temple
[57:18] it's got to be purged is that right
[57:21] for ye are the temple of the living god
[57:25] now paul's not talking about our body
[57:29] he's not even talking about our spirit
[57:31] he's talking about
[57:33] ye that seed gene
[57:36] of god that part that was dead
[57:40] that is the temple not made with hands
[57:46] that is a temple that the lord himself
[57:49] pitched that is where god comes
[57:53] to dwell in that part in that life
[57:56] that is as we've been looking for weeks
[57:58] that's the betting ground
[58:00] that's the virgin ground that's the womb
[58:04] that's the seed
[58:08] for ye are the temple of the living god
[58:10] as god
[58:11] hath said i will dwell in them
[58:14] very important i will dwell in them
[58:19] never forsake them but dwell in them
[58:22] and i will walk in them
[58:25] oh my and i will be their god
[58:28] and they shall be my people
[58:32] wherefore come out from among them
[58:36] and be separate saith the lord
[58:39] and touch not the unclean thing and
[58:43] i will receive you
[58:46] you see how we respond to the word
[58:49] shows our faith in him
[58:54] remember ultimately what is the faith of
[58:57] god coming down
[58:58] it's the circumcision of the holy ghost
[59:01] it's the seal of god
[59:03] it's god coming to a place to accept our
[59:06] faith
[59:07] is that right so there must be a
[59:10] responding
[59:11] you show your faith your faith
[59:14] is shown as you separate you come
[59:18] out from you see god cannot
[59:21] deal with a life or with a heart as long
[59:24] as it's there
[59:26] in the wrong company you understand what
[59:29] i mean by dealing with
[59:30] god will deal with the heart let me just
[59:32] say this to you very clearly
[59:33] some of you might have been sitting on a
[59:35] bar stool but the spirit of god
[59:37] dealt with your heart you never stayed
[59:40] there on a bar stool
[59:42] is that right you're in a different
[59:44] situation
[59:45] but the spirit of god begin to call to
[59:48] you
[59:48] like it did to abraham and you begin to
[59:52] walk away
[59:53] from where you were
[59:57] tell me that the word don't have power
[59:59] in it
[1:00:00] tell me about that that the holy ghost
[1:00:03] don't have power on it
[1:00:05] hallelujah that god would walk right in
[1:00:08] when a person is sitting at a bar have a
[1:00:11] fifth of whiskey in their head
[1:00:12] and the spirit of god could say you
[1:00:15] don't belong here
[1:00:16] this is not your residence i'm telling
[1:00:19] you
[1:00:19] when jesus goes into a bar to call out
[1:00:22] children
[1:00:23] they do never return to that bar they
[1:00:26] are delivered
[1:00:27] from that condition he begins to draw
[1:00:32] aren't you glad he come to where you
[1:00:33] were
[1:00:35] i think the brother sing that song he
[1:00:38] came
[1:00:38] looking for me
[1:00:42] wherefore come out from
[1:00:45] among them and be ye separate saith the
[1:00:49] lord
[1:00:50] and touch not so no the first part deals
[1:00:53] with associates
[1:00:54] the next part touch not the unclean
[1:00:57] thing those
[1:00:58] things that would be present and is
[1:01:00] around that you're aware of it's not
[1:01:02] your associates
[1:01:03] but it's things in your life that the
[1:01:05] spirit of god is dealing with your heart
[1:01:07] what's he trying to do
[1:01:09] he's wanting to completely purge and
[1:01:11] cleanse your life
[1:01:12] but the way that he does that is
[1:01:14] changing our
[1:01:16] thoughts concerning it
[1:01:19] it's god working
[1:01:22] so the reality is that you know when we
[1:01:25] look at it and this is where it says
[1:01:27] and i will receive you
[1:01:32] brother says it over and over not just
[1:01:34] in future home but he says it
[1:01:36] in an earlier part in the message he
[1:01:37] says and he says it like this in an
[1:01:39] earlier part of the message he said
[1:01:41] i don't think we need to be saying i've
[1:01:43] received the holy ghost
[1:01:44] he said we need to be saying the holy
[1:01:46] ghost received
[1:01:47] me then he comes over in future home in
[1:01:51] 1964
[1:01:52] and he says you never received the holy
[1:01:54] ghost he
[1:01:55] accepted you
[1:02:00] don't repeat it it takes it all out of
[1:02:02] our hands
[1:02:05] is that right so here it's god
[1:02:09] the true redemption is him receiving us
[1:02:13] by imparting his own life his quickening
[1:02:15] power
[1:02:16] into the temple not made with hands and
[1:02:18] that's the new birth
[1:02:20] you see to separate completely to the
[1:02:23] word
[1:02:23] bible word himself how can you say
[1:02:25] listen to me simple question
[1:02:27] how can you separate to the word without
[1:02:30] the word
[1:02:32] you're separating to a creed right this
[1:02:35] is why brother brandon when he preaches
[1:02:36] you must be born again
[1:02:38] in 62 or at the end of 61. he said this
[1:02:41] is why there's so many false
[1:02:42] births because what it's false teaching
[1:02:48] this is why the new birth this is the
[1:02:50] error
[1:02:51] the new birth is not accepting christ
[1:02:55] that's error to be born again
[1:02:58] is the new birth is the seal of the
[1:03:01] living god
[1:03:02] is to be circumcised it is a
[1:03:05] process that god brings
[1:03:08] us through unto himself what is it
[1:03:11] it's redemption calling us out
[1:03:15] and into well you say why has that been
[1:03:19] now listen if i if that's on anybody's
[1:03:21] toes
[1:03:22] i apologize for stepping on your toes
[1:03:24] but i may be jumping on them here in a
[1:03:26] little bit
[1:03:27] you understand that it's you know we
[1:03:28] understand these things why has satan
[1:03:30] done that
[1:03:31] because he realizes that if
[1:03:34] people get the true revelation and the
[1:03:37] deity of god
[1:03:38] comes down in the tabernacle of god just
[1:03:41] like it did
[1:03:42] in the days of pentecost brother it'll
[1:03:44] turn
[1:03:45] this world upside down
[1:03:49] that's why he's afraid of it this is why
[1:03:51] jesus said you shall know the truth the
[1:03:54] truth
[1:03:54] is not just a doctrine the truth is
[1:03:58] the person of jesus christ and he
[1:04:01] is the living word
[1:04:05] hallelujah so here is a
[1:04:08] separate from all the old associates
[1:04:13] you must recognize listen to me now it's
[1:04:15] very simple
[1:04:16] you must recognize that the same same as
[1:04:19] the spirit of god
[1:04:21] is drawing you to come out there's also
[1:04:24] a spirit
[1:04:26] that you were bound by listen to me
[1:04:29] remember
[1:04:30] as we were dealing a couple weeks ago
[1:04:32] brother bran said i
[1:04:33] would have surrendered my heart to god a
[1:04:36] long time ago
[1:04:38] he said but there was a devil a spirit
[1:04:42] that hung over me that kept saying
[1:04:45] wait a little longer
[1:04:49] see how conniving that devil is he
[1:04:50] didn't say don't do it at all
[1:04:52] don't ever do it just wait just wait
[1:04:59] but then through the preaching of the
[1:05:03] word
[1:05:05] devils are cast out amen
[1:05:08] sometimes you might see a manifestation
[1:05:10] of a
[1:05:11] of a hole that's that's been in a
[1:05:13] person's life and other times you don't
[1:05:15] see any manifestation
[1:05:17] but the devils are fleeing
[1:05:21] right rather either in prayer right here
[1:05:24] or right even through the preaching of
[1:05:26] the word let me just tell you something
[1:05:28] what is it that heaviness and that part
[1:05:31] that's on you
[1:05:32] but yet when the word is going forth
[1:05:34] it's ministry
[1:05:35] it's calling to a son or daughter of god
[1:05:38] you start to believe him oh my
[1:05:40] brother brahm said it like this he said
[1:05:42] you raise up one little part in you
[1:05:44] he said the spirit of god says yes and
[1:05:46] he said there's a part in you that says
[1:05:48] yes and it goes again in the spirit of
[1:05:50] god you believe because the word is yeah
[1:05:52] and amen
[1:05:53] every promise in him and that word is
[1:05:55] being preached yes
[1:05:56] yes yes and all of a sudden what happens
[1:05:59] the yeses
[1:06:00] in you start getting closer together
[1:06:03] what is it the oppressor
[1:06:05] is actually being cast out that one that
[1:06:08] will hold you back
[1:06:09] it is casting out what should i do write
[1:06:12] to him
[1:06:12] with open arms and say lord jesus
[1:06:16] lord receive me
[1:06:21] sometimes this old associates and things
[1:06:24] like that let me just
[1:06:25] i want to just just laying this in and
[1:06:27] going just in this
[1:06:29] the lord just been dealing with my heart
[1:06:31] on this with faith
[1:06:32] you see sometimes what we're looking at
[1:06:36] is just as the spirit of god is drawing
[1:06:38] us
[1:06:39] and then to recognize the old associates
[1:06:43] and the other things that's around
[1:06:45] there's a spirit
[1:06:47] that we were bound by and influenced by
[1:06:50] it's still present working
[1:06:53] in your associates
[1:06:58] i said this it's true you take a room
[1:07:01] full of people
[1:07:02] and they ain't never met one another
[1:07:04] before let's just say
[1:07:06] you get them out of youth camp and let's
[1:07:08] just say there's
[1:07:10] a hundred of them okay maybe manageable
[1:07:12] crowd and you get a hundred of them
[1:07:15] you watch you'll find some that are
[1:07:18] there
[1:07:19] and they might have come for the wrong
[1:07:21] wrong reasons
[1:07:22] does that bother you by saying no
[1:07:24] because i've prayed with many that stood
[1:07:26] right there and said brother samuel
[1:07:28] i came here for the wrong reason but god
[1:07:31] has turned my heart they didn't even
[1:07:33] know why they were there
[1:07:39] i just love how the lord works
[1:07:42] but you watch how all of a sudden
[1:07:44] they'll connect together
[1:07:45] you'll start finding something you're
[1:07:47] like why is this pocket together
[1:07:49] why is this pocket together you know why
[1:07:51] it is there's spirits
[1:07:55] and sometimes you don't recognize it's
[1:07:57] spiritual it's trying to do
[1:07:58] it's trying to build up an unbelief this
[1:08:00] is why brother graham said sitting right
[1:08:02] there
[1:08:03] in the meeting where you'd have where
[1:08:04] once called out
[1:08:06] cancer or this and he said right across
[1:08:08] the building another
[1:08:10] devil with the same one what you're
[1:08:12] trying to do fortify
[1:08:14] against the word but i'm talking to
[1:08:17] believers this morning
[1:08:19] i believe there's more right here this
[1:08:21] morning as believers
[1:08:22] baptized with the holy ghost as sons and
[1:08:25] daughters of god
[1:08:26] that are tabernacling a part of that
[1:08:28] great pillar of fire and as it's come
[1:08:30] together
[1:08:31] it's uniting together and satan would
[1:08:34] like to
[1:08:34] affront the word of god but there is a
[1:08:37] chain of
[1:08:38] faith that is building throughout the
[1:08:40] building it's moving in hearts
[1:08:42] it's getting stronger it's pushing back
[1:08:45] the darkness
[1:08:52] it's still present to work in those
[1:08:54] associates and if you don't watch
[1:08:56] brother brown you know he spends
[1:08:57] countless times dealing with this
[1:08:59] you don't watch you'll find yourself
[1:09:01] right back in it
[1:09:03] now remember i'm talking about somebody
[1:09:05] that's in journey to the new birth
[1:09:07] you see sometimes let me just get down
[1:09:10] personal
[1:09:11] sometimes it might be your job
[1:09:15] or it might be your family
[1:09:20] and you might say i really can't leave
[1:09:23] those associates
[1:09:26] well what should i do have a positive
[1:09:30] confession
[1:09:33] you confess and do this should be what
[1:09:36] you've done
[1:09:36] anyhow when you get up from the altar or
[1:09:39] from your seat
[1:09:40] or whatever you confess you get up and
[1:09:43] say
[1:09:43] i am a christian when you feel that
[1:09:46] burden that has been released from your
[1:09:49] life
[1:09:50] you then can stand he's the high priest
[1:09:53] of your profession
[1:09:54] he will act upon what you are saying i
[1:09:57] am a christian i am a believer i'm no
[1:10:00] longer the same
[1:10:03] oh i know you you're just the same old
[1:10:06] well truly you might still have and have
[1:10:08] that same old nature
[1:10:10] but there is a work of god that you are
[1:10:13] testifying to
[1:10:15] i am no longer a sinner i
[1:10:18] am a christian
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:22] am right the bible said man believeth
[1:10:25] unto salvation as i write
[1:10:29] and with the mouth confession is made
[1:10:32] unto righteousness it's very very
[1:10:35] important
[1:10:38] now does that mean on the first time
[1:10:39] around that the devil's going to shut
[1:10:41] his mouth remember
[1:10:42] though that person that individual
[1:10:43] family member job associates or whatever
[1:10:46] more
[1:10:46] remember they are still under the
[1:10:48] influence of the spirit
[1:10:49] and when god begins to deal in your life
[1:10:51] it's as if the devil calls
[1:10:53] reinforcements
[1:10:54] and whatever he can to try to come at
[1:10:56] you
[1:10:57] and to try to hinder you i'm telling you
[1:10:59] god is speaking to somebody this morning
[1:11:01] he would try to call do what's he trying
[1:11:03] to do he's trying to build up
[1:11:05] an armor or an armory or an influence
[1:11:09] against what do i do you stay on your
[1:11:12] god-given ground
[1:11:13] you stand there to know that god touched
[1:11:16] my heart
[1:11:16] there was that lift that release that i
[1:11:19] felt and then what do i do
[1:11:20] don't stay there you get in the word
[1:11:23] well brother samuel i don't seem to
[1:11:24] understand anything
[1:11:26] but the word has power in it it has
[1:11:28] power
[1:11:29] to break the hold of unbelief i can't
[1:11:31] put it all together
[1:11:32] god's not asking you to put it all
[1:11:34] together he's the one to put you
[1:11:36] together
[1:11:37] what should i do pray read you might be
[1:11:40] driving
[1:11:40] oh god help me lord jesus lord you're my
[1:11:43] savior
[1:11:44] lord the work you've done lord god i
[1:11:46] want a fullness in my life see god just
[1:11:54] don't take us
[1:11:55] it's not you know god walking around
[1:12:02] but the same man looks foolish to think
[1:12:04] that way is foolish
[1:12:06] that's not the work of god of god
[1:12:09] doing that amen
[1:12:14] verse 18. boy and i will be a father
[1:12:18] unto you oh i love that
[1:12:23] and ye shall be my sons and daughters
[1:12:27] you see what what's happening he's
[1:12:29] ministering the rights
[1:12:31] these are the rights that belong to you
[1:12:34] as the son and daughter of god
[1:12:36] what right you've got a right to walk
[1:12:38] away from the associates
[1:12:40] you've got a right to not touch the
[1:12:42] unclean thing you've got a right there
[1:12:44] is a power oh glory be to god
[1:12:47] there's a word and there is the enforcer
[1:12:49] of the word the holy ghost
[1:12:51] that will come behind and he'll enforce
[1:12:54] that word in that standard
[1:12:57] he will be up i will be a father unto
[1:12:59] you
[1:13:00] and ye shall be my sons and daughters
[1:13:03] saith
[1:13:04] the lord almighty
[1:13:07] amen the almighty one the lord almighty
[1:13:12] he who was before
[1:13:16] amen he who holds sway
[1:13:19] power and authority
[1:13:22] i will be your father so you see it's
[1:13:25] the word
[1:13:27] that is sounding out now think of this
[1:13:29] term of father notice i will be
[1:13:31] your father you could say well isn't god
[1:13:35] already my father in one way yes and in
[1:13:38] another way no
[1:13:40] because in order to be your father he
[1:13:42] has to father you
[1:13:45] you see with myself being the son of
[1:13:48] james and pat browning
[1:13:50] there had to be that james brown
[1:13:54] though here i was within him and you can
[1:13:56] go back on back on back on back on back
[1:13:57] grandfather great grandfather on
[1:13:59] i was there and it was packed all the
[1:14:02] way
[1:14:03] on down but there had to come where
[1:14:06] james brown
[1:14:08] he himself through marriage would come
[1:14:11] and unite with a bedding ground they
[1:14:14] would unite together
[1:14:15] not just he would walk and take the
[1:14:17] bedding ground but it had to be
[1:14:19] to where he would woo patricia may
[1:14:22] brown he would woo her they would fall
[1:14:26] in love notice
[1:14:27] before the betting ground ever becomes
[1:14:29] into a place
[1:14:30] of really receiving the seed there must
[1:14:33] be
[1:14:34] a love affair it's a love affair that
[1:14:37] governs the imparting of that seed here
[1:14:40] i was
[1:14:41] within my daddy but in order for him to
[1:14:43] father me
[1:14:44] there must be a bedding ground to where
[1:14:47] that seed
[1:14:48] that me could actually be reparted or
[1:14:52] placed in that bedding ground
[1:14:54] if that's how it is in the natural then
[1:14:56] how much more
[1:14:58] in god because look god himself
[1:15:01] when you and i dropped from our mother's
[1:15:03] womb god himself
[1:15:05] when we were taking the breath of life
[1:15:07] there was that seed
[1:15:09] our representation the real identity
[1:15:12] of the son and daughter of god it
[1:15:14] entered us right then
[1:15:16] it was the womb or the betting ground
[1:15:19] or the good ground that eventually the
[1:15:22] father himself
[1:15:23] would come and impart his life into that
[1:15:27] betting ground
[1:15:28] and then when he does that it breeds out
[1:15:30] all the call
[1:15:31] it brings out all the hybridity it
[1:15:34] breeds back
[1:15:34] a son and daughter of god one who has
[1:15:37] papers
[1:15:38] that he's a thoroughbred one who has
[1:15:40] identity
[1:15:41] that is of the same stock of how god
[1:15:45] has brought us all the way down
[1:15:48] i will be your father
[1:15:53] lord i want to be father he said come
[1:15:55] out
[1:15:56] come out from among be separate
[1:16:00] touch not the unclean thing but lord you
[1:16:02] father me first he said no
[1:16:05] no i'm letting you know the potential
[1:16:07] that's in you
[1:16:10] well what's doing it love is drawing us
[1:16:14] oh my don't you love him this is why the
[1:16:17] bible would say
[1:16:18] in galatians 4 when the fullness of time
[1:16:20] was come
[1:16:21] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:16:24] made under the law
[1:16:25] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:16:28] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:16:31] son so there had to be
[1:16:32] a redeeming first he could not come
[1:16:36] and begin to deal with our hearts deal
[1:16:38] with our lives
[1:16:39] and say i will be a father unto you i
[1:16:41] will be a father unto you
[1:16:43] if there had not been the work of
[1:16:45] redemption already taken place
[1:16:48] listen what are you saying we're saying
[1:16:50] that the work of redemption
[1:16:52] that all that was needed he fulfilled it
[1:16:56] he is our boaz he redeemed us brother
[1:17:00] brown would put it this way and souls in
[1:17:02] prison
[1:17:02] we were redeemed there at calvary
[1:17:06] but he says now when god deals with that
[1:17:08] heart he's calling the names
[1:17:10] that are on that book and when that lame
[1:17:14] has been called and thoroughly splashed
[1:17:17] beneath that bleach then it has been
[1:17:20] thoroughly
[1:17:21] redeemed well what's happened the
[1:17:24] redemption
[1:17:25] of the redeemer is now revealed and
[1:17:28] vindicated
[1:17:29] in a redeemed subject of god where god
[1:17:32] himself
[1:17:33] is now now making known this is
[1:17:36] my redeemed subject just as he came down
[1:17:39] on the river jordan he laid claim on
[1:17:42] what he himself
[1:17:44] had made is that right
[1:17:47] he never come down and said now i will
[1:17:49] claim this body of mary they don't want
[1:17:51] the body from mary
[1:17:52] mary did not even give an egg to it
[1:17:58] it was a virgin birth it was without the
[1:18:01] assistance
[1:18:02] of man it was without that of any
[1:18:06] any any human instrumentality it was the
[1:18:09] creation of god
[1:18:11] god supplied all of our brother says it
[1:18:13] in there in the lady will see an age
[1:18:15] god supplied he said that over them that
[1:18:17] egg and god also
[1:18:18] supplied that life that sperm so it was
[1:18:21] indeed
[1:18:22] a creation of god that god there in that
[1:18:25] womb and then coming through that
[1:18:26] it was the very the very life the very
[1:18:29] cell
[1:18:30] the very blood the very tabernacle of
[1:18:32] almighty god
[1:18:33] and god said this is my beloved son
[1:18:37] in whom i'm well pleased to dwell
[1:18:40] in that's what the holy ghost does
[1:18:43] when he comes to sons and daughters that
[1:18:46] was a pattern
[1:18:47] at the river jordan he comes to every
[1:18:50] son and daughter of god
[1:18:51] he did it in corinth he did it on there
[1:18:53] on the day of pentecost
[1:18:54] it's not the holy ghost falling upon us
[1:18:57] and making us sons
[1:18:59] no it's the holy ghost coming and
[1:19:02] raising up sons that are laying in a
[1:19:05] dead
[1:19:05] state in that life
[1:19:09] who glory be to god this is what real
[1:19:10] redemption is so he came
[1:19:13] in order to redeem them that were under
[1:19:15] the law oh my
[1:19:17] boy somebody that loved us huh that we
[1:19:20] might receive the adoption or
[1:19:22] the placement of sons in ephesians 1 5
[1:19:25] having predestinated us unto the
[1:19:27] adoption of children by
[1:19:30] jesus christ to himself god had to
[1:19:32] become
[1:19:33] one of us and he had to pay the price
[1:19:36] become our mediator the right kind of a
[1:19:39] mediator
[1:19:40] he had to pay the price shed the blood
[1:19:42] that you and i
[1:19:43] would be able to come back to him
[1:19:46] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:19:48] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:19:50] grace wherein
[1:19:51] he hath made us accepted in the beloved
[1:19:55] amen do you make yourself accepted
[1:19:59] no he hath romans 8 15
[1:20:03] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:20:06] bondage again to fear
[1:20:07] but you have received the spirit of
[1:20:10] adoption
[1:20:11] whereby we cry abba father
[1:20:15] and the spirit beareth witness with our
[1:20:16] spirit that we are the children of god
[1:20:18] i love this quote here in the message
[1:20:20] shalom oh my
[1:20:22] our heavenly father he's praying we are
[1:20:24] so grateful to you
[1:20:25] that we that we can even be privileged
[1:20:28] to address you
[1:20:29] as our father for father means
[1:20:33] that we have been begotten of the great
[1:20:35] god
[1:20:36] that created the heavens and earth and
[1:20:38] we are so
[1:20:39] happy for this privilege that we can
[1:20:42] think
[1:20:42] in our hearts and then that we are sons
[1:20:45] and daughters of god
[1:20:47] and then to see you strictly identify
[1:20:50] yourself
[1:20:51] in the midst of us that you are our
[1:20:53] father
[1:20:55] how changing our thoughts
[1:20:58] from the things of the world and
[1:21:01] changing
[1:21:02] our motives and objectives and attitudes
[1:21:05] and every phase of us
[1:21:09] to love you to believe you and know that
[1:21:12] your promises are true
[1:21:14] aren't you glad you don't end with the
[1:21:15] new birth
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:18] he keeps on moving and dealing and
[1:21:20] working in our life oh my
[1:21:23] god you see what we're speaking of is
[1:21:26] that old nature that we received
[1:21:30] it came by that sexual birth between
[1:21:32] father and mother
[1:21:34] when we dropped from our mother and we
[1:21:37] took that breath of life
[1:21:39] you see there was a spirit human spirit
[1:21:41] that we were given
[1:21:43] and eventually we went along for a while
[1:21:46] and we
[1:21:47] we come to an age of accountability i
[1:21:49] realized sometimes that's not always in
[1:21:51] concrete and stone that it happens at
[1:21:54] age 12 or this
[1:21:56] in today's world and you find sometimes
[1:21:58] it happens much much sooner
[1:22:00] but at any rate the age of
[1:22:02] accountability is where you begin to
[1:22:04] really have
[1:22:05] a real recognition of right and wrong
[1:22:09] where you begin to realize i'm wrong
[1:22:13] this is wrong i shouldn't be doing this
[1:22:16] and you see it begins to deal with your
[1:22:18] life now
[1:22:19] let me just say it to you that old
[1:22:21] nature
[1:22:23] is receptive to the influence of the
[1:22:25] devil let me just put it in simple terms
[1:22:27] he's buddies with the devil
[1:22:32] that old nature his nearest kin is the
[1:22:35] devil
[1:22:36] amen hello
[1:22:44] glory be to god in the eyes
[1:22:47] i would go into that from ruth but ruth
[1:22:49] and boyz but i think we just need to
[1:22:50] stay here that old nature is receptive
[1:22:53] to the influence of the death
[1:22:55] you know it starts when here we are
[1:22:57] young nobody had to teach us
[1:22:59] how to lie i didn't knock that plan over
[1:23:04] he did it it keeps going
[1:23:07] keeps going he's going it's receptive
[1:23:12] to that spirit what we're reading in our
[1:23:14] text
[1:23:15] it's it's receptive and it'll align
[1:23:18] many years in disobedience he's saying
[1:23:22] something to you
[1:23:22] it can sit right in a church
[1:23:26] and it'll sit here for so long and not
[1:23:29] even move
[1:23:31] and it'll align with the spirit of
[1:23:33] disobedience
[1:23:35] you're okay you're all right you don't
[1:23:38] need to
[1:23:38] just wait it'll be all right you just
[1:23:42] brother samuel kennedy yeah he can do
[1:23:44] that but you see
[1:23:46] when god begins to deal with that heart
[1:23:49] and that life as god's dealing with that
[1:23:52] that old nature
[1:23:54] you see what god's doing it's like the
[1:23:56] prodigal son
[1:23:59] it begins to align with the spirit of
[1:24:02] god that's dealing with it
[1:24:05] you see you think about legion i think
[1:24:07] of how brother brown puts it like this
[1:24:10] legion was on the other side of the sea
[1:24:14] and when jesus jesus heard the call
[1:24:17] to come there it was the call
[1:24:20] from that seed on the inside
[1:24:24] legion needed deliverance
[1:24:28] he needed help it was a calling out to
[1:24:30] life
[1:24:31] jesus crossed that sea for one person
[1:24:36] and when he got there brother brown said
[1:24:38] like this
[1:24:40] he was there in that tomb with all them
[1:24:43] devils on him
[1:24:45] but he said when he heard that jesus had
[1:24:47] come
[1:24:48] he wasn't going to let those
[1:24:51] devils keep him there
[1:24:56] brother i need power to do that when you
[1:24:59] begin to hear him
[1:25:01] you begin to hear him talking him draw
[1:25:03] let me tell you something brother even
[1:25:05] within that right there
[1:25:06] of a life that's not even regenerated
[1:25:09] fully yet
[1:25:10] but you begin to incline and align with
[1:25:13] the spirit of god
[1:25:14] there's not enough devils that can hold
[1:25:17] you back
[1:25:20] hallelujah when you're determined i've
[1:25:23] got to get to
[1:25:24] jesus what's that called
[1:25:28] desperation
[1:25:31] amen you see god deals with
[1:25:34] that old nature just like he just shows
[1:25:37] it
[1:25:38] even as he dealt with when israel here
[1:25:40] they are
[1:25:41] coming up to the red sea they come to a
[1:25:44] heart a tight spot
[1:25:45] but god opens up a way through that red
[1:25:49] sea
[1:25:50] and pharaoh just thinks he's going to go
[1:25:53] ahead and he's going to follow him over
[1:25:55] and overtake him but what the devil
[1:25:58] didn't
[1:25:59] know that day
[1:26:02] it was a trap for him
[1:26:05] see god has a way of working and god
[1:26:09] working on that old nature and to bring
[1:26:11] it into a place
[1:26:12] to where it will align and it's a trap
[1:26:15] that's
[1:26:16] set that he might destroy it
[1:26:21] i'm talking about building up in faith
[1:26:23] now it's about building up in faith you
[1:26:25] see
[1:26:26] this is where this is where god
[1:26:30] simple statement brother brad makes god
[1:26:32] will never save
[1:26:33] a man against his own will
[1:26:36] you never heard anybody walk around
[1:26:37] saying you know what god saved me and i
[1:26:39] didn't want to get saved
[1:26:43] maybe you didn't get saved god don't
[1:26:46] work that way
[1:26:48] salvation is of the lord but it ain't
[1:26:50] god coming down
[1:26:52] and getting a right
[1:26:55] you see god will not work in opposition
[1:26:59] to our will
[1:27:00] listen to me now but god works to a
[1:27:02] place to where
[1:27:04] our will will actually surrender
[1:27:08] to his will
[1:27:11] when that takes place then
[1:27:14] god moves down fully to
[1:27:18] take care of that old nature
[1:27:22] this is all his work this is where
[1:27:25] you see when jesus would say in john 12
[1:27:28] 31
[1:27:29] now is the judgment of this world thou
[1:27:31] shalt
[1:27:32] the prince of this world be cast out
[1:27:35] and i if i be lifted up from the earth
[1:27:38] will
[1:27:39] draw all men unto
[1:27:42] me i will draw them it is that which
[1:27:46] from an
[1:27:46] inward pull i will impel
[1:27:50] i will draw them unto me
[1:27:53] sacrifice has been offered up the
[1:27:55] redemption has come
[1:27:57] now the spirit of god begins to move
[1:28:01] throughout the earth well how does the
[1:28:03] spirit of god move
[1:28:04] through the word the spirit of god can
[1:28:08] deal with the person let's say the man
[1:28:09] dwight moody who came to the lord that
[1:28:11] night maybe whether to white moody knew
[1:28:13] anything about the lord or not
[1:28:14] that's really not to any concern right
[1:28:16] now at this point but what had to be
[1:28:18] is the spirit of god would deal with his
[1:28:21] heart go to the meeting
[1:28:23] go to the meeting go to the meeting or
[1:28:24] maybe that sister who was 99 years old
[1:28:26] when she was led to the lord you know
[1:28:28] fully in in the meetings there brother
[1:28:30] branham and he meets her on the other
[1:28:31] side
[1:28:32] there had to be something the spirit of
[1:28:33] god was leading them oh glory be to god
[1:28:36] i thank god brother branham he'll pick
[1:28:38] it up he said that possum
[1:28:40] that was right there at his doorstep he
[1:28:42] said what was it
[1:28:43] god had led her to that place and he
[1:28:46] says what about you sinner tonight
[1:28:48] what about the love of god that has led
[1:28:51] you to this meeting
[1:28:52] he said oh can't you just let the love
[1:28:55] of god move into your heart
[1:28:57] for a loving god that would lead you to
[1:29:00] this place
[1:29:01] oh he says if you just love him grace
[1:29:04] will be projected and he'll come in and
[1:29:07] do a full work
[1:29:09] do you know what he said if you love him
[1:29:12] just love him
[1:29:15] say oh jesus
[1:29:18] how will draw oh men unto me
[1:29:21] you see this is where as a scripture
[1:29:24] jesus would say in john 6 43-44
[1:29:28] all that the father hath given me notice
[1:29:31] hath given me will come
[1:29:35] to me over in matthew
[1:29:39] come unto me
[1:29:42] all you they're having heavy lady right
[1:29:44] so come it means
[1:29:45] a come means to move from one place to
[1:29:48] another
[1:29:49] but you might be sitting right there in
[1:29:50] your seat but right here
[1:29:52] in that old nature it's moved from one
[1:29:54] place to another
[1:29:56] it's actually being led the spirit of
[1:29:58] god is dealing with mild nature
[1:30:00] mild nature you mean god is dealing with
[1:30:02] that yes
[1:30:03] because he cannot just come in and rip
[1:30:06] it out of us
[1:30:07] it's got to be surrendered
[1:30:11] remember faith cometh by love
[1:30:16] brethren talks about this of the new
[1:30:18] birth let me just
[1:30:19] let me just read this here he deals with
[1:30:22] how
[1:30:22] he says before i don't think i have
[1:30:25] these up there i just stabbed my notes i
[1:30:27] just want to refer to certain parts
[1:30:28] brother brown talks about how a birth
[1:30:30] itself is a mess
[1:30:33] he said anybody knows no matter where a
[1:30:34] birth happens it's a mess
[1:30:37] and he says it will make you and brother
[1:30:39] bran will go into things squall
[1:30:40] ball wash all the pain off your face
[1:30:43] it'll do things for you
[1:30:45] that you didn't think you'd do you'll
[1:30:47] carry on like you never think
[1:30:48] you do it's a mess now maybe nobody has
[1:30:51] pain on their face
[1:30:52] but you see the squalling and balling
[1:30:55] does not
[1:30:55] start here nor does it stop here the
[1:30:58] mess itself is not because somebody gets
[1:31:00] up
[1:31:01] and they've got all kinds of mess around
[1:31:02] their face people can have all kinds of
[1:31:04] mess
[1:31:05] and they've never dealt with this mess
[1:31:06] on the inside
[1:31:08] are you with me you see it's god trying
[1:31:11] to get this man
[1:31:13] on the inside but the mess is where
[1:31:15] things
[1:31:16] are fading away they can let loose
[1:31:19] listen right here
[1:31:20] while the words being preached right
[1:31:22] here you don't even have to wait to the
[1:31:24] end
[1:31:24] it can actually the spirit of god can
[1:31:27] move out
[1:31:28] and absolutely bring such a redemptive
[1:31:31] work of coming out
[1:31:32] and going into amen but it may not come
[1:31:37] exactly that way
[1:31:40] for everybody because as brother branham
[1:31:43] said some people
[1:31:44] die real hard
[1:31:47] but praise god they die is that right
[1:31:51] some die real hard you see this is why
[1:31:55] when it's fear brother says many they
[1:31:57] fear that new birth
[1:31:59] because of the mess but what it is it's
[1:32:01] the mess
[1:32:02] having to give this up having to give
[1:32:03] that up will here never come of fear
[1:32:06] see the holy ghost does not come and
[1:32:08] override fear
[1:32:09] the holy ghost comes and he moves into a
[1:32:12] place to where
[1:32:13] we are surrendered in his love
[1:32:16] he will not open because remember he
[1:32:18] doesn't want our life to be governed by
[1:32:20] fear
[1:32:20] it has been governed by fear ever since
[1:32:22] we come to that even that
[1:32:24] realization more and more of the age of
[1:32:25] accountability it's governed by fear
[1:32:27] this is why he's not calling us to the
[1:32:29] spirit of bondage again
[1:32:31] this is real liberty it's a real setting
[1:32:33] that's free
[1:32:34] so you see how the spirit of god will
[1:32:36] work in that place for the brown woods
[1:32:38] he would say it like this
[1:32:39] in such a place he says before you can
[1:32:42] be
[1:32:43] born you have to die
[1:32:46] and some people die awful hard they kick
[1:32:50] ball scream and carry on
[1:32:52] and that's true many many of those
[1:32:53] things that is doing it but you know
[1:32:55] listen as we just said mess itself it's
[1:32:58] where things are fading away
[1:33:00] out of that life it's where there is a
[1:33:03] releasing
[1:33:04] and a letting go brother brown would use
[1:33:06] this term
[1:33:07] over and over throughout the message and
[1:33:09] it's the term
[1:33:10] rot he said if you want to bring forth
[1:33:13] fruit
[1:33:13] die to yourself your own man-made
[1:33:15] theology be born again of the spirit
[1:33:18] and the resurrection get rid of the old
[1:33:21] spirit
[1:33:22] of selfishness and dryness that's in you
[1:33:24] notice
[1:33:25] get rid of take on new life
[1:33:28] it's messy unless a grain of corn falls
[1:33:31] in the ground
[1:33:32] and rots unless a man rots to his own
[1:33:35] theology
[1:33:36] he writes brother then goes through
[1:33:38] baptist methodist pentecostal theology
[1:33:41] until you rot to those things
[1:33:45] and give yourself into the hands of god
[1:33:48] listen i thought i didn't have anything
[1:33:50] to do with it you don't
[1:33:52] it's you rotting rotting away
[1:33:57] giving yourself into the hand of god
[1:34:02] brother iran would say it he says then
[1:34:05] the old man
[1:34:06] will die and the new man will be born
[1:34:10] christ jesus we will rise
[1:34:14] now you know brother brown would go on
[1:34:17] and he would tell us in god rich in
[1:34:19] mercy he said to die
[1:34:21] is not enough it's got a rot
[1:34:26] right
[1:34:30] a seed has to rot not just die
[1:34:33] the rot is where all of that
[1:34:36] seed coat which is that hard part that's
[1:34:39] around the seed
[1:34:40] everything has to rot it's a rotting
[1:34:44] to our own ideas it's a rotting to our
[1:34:48] own thinking
[1:34:49] this is the coming out and being
[1:34:51] separate and touching off the unclean
[1:34:53] thing
[1:34:53] see it's god how can it rot you know you
[1:34:55] could hold a seed right here
[1:34:57] and that seed will never rot you can
[1:34:59] have it right there it'll never rot
[1:35:01] or let's just say as it is right here
[1:35:04] that that old nature well what makes the
[1:35:06] old nature
[1:35:07] rot same thing when you put a seed in
[1:35:09] the ground
[1:35:11] you get the moisture around that seed
[1:35:13] and that moisture starts breaking it
[1:35:16] down little by little you can come back
[1:35:20] here on thursday nope no sprout
[1:35:23] you come back sunday oh no no sprout you
[1:35:26] come back
[1:35:27] no sprout no sprout but remember
[1:35:32] where it takes place first
[1:35:35] is down beneath the soil right
[1:35:38] now when that old nature is rotted
[1:35:42] away and then that new man on the inside
[1:35:45] can come out
[1:35:45] i pulled out many seeds there in science
[1:35:47] class and you pour them out to where
[1:35:49] then it'll be laid open like that many
[1:35:51] times we'd use the bean
[1:35:52] you'd pull it open and i'm beneath the
[1:35:54] soil you would see
[1:35:56] that little itty-bitty plant it was a
[1:35:59] little itty-bitty
[1:36:00] leaf you didn't see it above the surface
[1:36:02] but just
[1:36:03] give it time it will eventually come
[1:36:06] above the surface
[1:36:07] what's doing it the light and the
[1:36:09] moisture this
[1:36:10] is why it's necessary that we be
[1:36:14] under the word of god that brings a real
[1:36:17] bird
[1:36:18] that'll rock them old ideas that'll
[1:36:20] convict
[1:36:21] and convict you of sin that'll deal with
[1:36:24] your heart
[1:36:25] it'll deal with your life and say you
[1:36:27] need to separate
[1:36:28] from that old selfishness you need to
[1:36:30] get rid of that malice you need to get
[1:36:32] rid of that pain
[1:36:33] you need to get rid of that old worldly
[1:36:35] appetite you need to stop
[1:36:37] looking at the wrong things
[1:36:40] and whether he calls it out verbatim or
[1:36:43] not
[1:36:44] the spirit of god is here to bring
[1:36:45] conviction
[1:36:49] you see it's very important you've lost
[1:36:52] rot
[1:36:56] oh my can i have just a little bit more
[1:37:01] this is why paul would say
[1:37:05] in one direction of it of romans 12 2
[1:37:08] and be not conformed to this world
[1:37:12] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:37:16] of your mind he's not talking about
[1:37:18] this matter between our our ears
[1:37:21] that's our brain but your mind and your
[1:37:24] spirit oh that's connected
[1:37:26] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:37:28] of your mind that you might
[1:37:30] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:37:33] and perfect will of god
[1:37:36] i want you to think of it here like this
[1:37:42] that prodigal son where he was at
[1:37:47] he was down there in the pigpen right
[1:37:50] now what what what what took him there
[1:37:54] his own desires got to a place
[1:37:59] that those desires oh you could have
[1:38:02] this
[1:38:03] could do this man this is so dull here
[1:38:06] you could have such
[1:38:08] such freedom oh my wouldn't it be
[1:38:10] wonderful
[1:38:11] to have this and this and not his
[1:38:14] desires
[1:38:16] took him from father's house
[1:38:19] that's what happened in the garden of
[1:38:22] eden
[1:38:24] as a result that first birth and that
[1:38:28] nature that we receive
[1:38:30] but as he was down there brother brown
[1:38:33] puts it very clearly
[1:38:34] he said the angel of the lord
[1:38:38] began to deal with that boy's heart
[1:38:41] it says mom and daddy prayed for him and
[1:38:44] the angel of the lord began to deal with
[1:38:46] his heart
[1:38:48] once you think what happens he gets to
[1:38:51] the lowest point
[1:38:54] sometimes that lowest point still don't
[1:38:57] turn somebody
[1:38:59] right god knows what it takes
[1:39:03] what is it and what it takes is to where
[1:39:06] the person
[1:39:08] begins to change their thoughts
[1:39:11] towards home right well who can do that
[1:39:15] the angel of the lord he begins to move
[1:39:18] this boy is still covered over
[1:39:20] in all the pig manure and everything
[1:39:22] else but he's
[1:39:24] his his desires his thinking is changing
[1:39:28] he starts thinking now father's house
[1:39:30] didn't change
[1:39:31] you know when he went away from father's
[1:39:32] house this is too tight this is so
[1:39:35] strict
[1:39:36] this why is this and why was that
[1:39:38] father's house didn't change
[1:39:41] standards didn't change father didn't
[1:39:44] send him messages
[1:39:45] come back we've learned better you don't
[1:39:49] have to do this
[1:39:50] this isn't really necessary father's
[1:39:52] house didn't change
[1:39:54] who was changing he was
[1:39:57] he was he was changing his desires
[1:40:01] his thoughts were changing toward that
[1:40:05] of father's house this is why when god
[1:40:08] would deal with our life let me just
[1:40:09] try to bring it to this place in souls
[1:40:11] in prison brother branham would deal
[1:40:13] with it he says
[1:40:14] it's the soul that god is that's in
[1:40:17] there
[1:40:18] that soul is what god is
[1:40:21] working on if he can only get that
[1:40:24] nature that spirit to agree with him
[1:40:29] you mean you mean that new nature no no
[1:40:31] he wants the old nature to agree with
[1:40:33] him
[1:40:34] in order to kill him he's got to have
[1:40:37] the old one
[1:40:38] agree with him
[1:40:42] this is the word that soul is what god
[1:40:45] is working on
[1:40:46] if he can only get that nature that
[1:40:49] spirit
[1:40:49] to agree with him then that
[1:40:52] nature dies the nature
[1:40:56] and the love of the world dies and the
[1:40:58] things of the world
[1:41:00] is dead right so that nature
[1:41:04] oh i'm wrong i'm wrong
[1:41:09] what's happening is bringing it to a
[1:41:11] place
[1:41:12] getting ready to kill it
[1:41:15] right getting ready to kill that old
[1:41:17] nature this
[1:41:19] is somebody who loved us
[1:41:23] love produces faith
[1:41:27] what led back to that place where the
[1:41:29] nature dies
[1:41:32] it's the love of god notice if you love
[1:41:33] the world or the things of the world
[1:41:36] the love of god is not in you and a man
[1:41:39] must be born again so this nature
[1:41:42] has to die and the nature of god comes
[1:41:46] and lives in you god is the only thing
[1:41:49] there is that never
[1:41:50] begin nor never can end
[1:41:53] the brahman goes on that says this is
[1:41:55] why we're baptized into his name
[1:41:58] that we might come forth in his name in
[1:42:00] his death
[1:42:01] in his resurrection that we rise again
[1:42:03] testifying to the world
[1:42:05] that we have new life
[1:42:08] that the old man is dead
[1:42:13] we buried that first nature
[1:42:16] he's not just dead right
[1:42:21] there's been a funeral preached amen
[1:42:25] there's been an obituary of how that old
[1:42:28] rascal was
[1:42:30] he's dead he's not been hung up
[1:42:34] not been put in the closet
[1:42:37] come on now he's dead and he's been
[1:42:40] buried amen amen there's a sound
[1:42:46] the old man is dead he used to live here
[1:42:50] lives here no more amen so then what
[1:42:53] does paul call it
[1:42:54] the new man all right amen
[1:42:57] remember i'm gonna say it like this he
[1:42:59] said so many times people are talking
[1:43:00] about let's put a new coat on the man
[1:43:02] put a new coat on the man he said we got
[1:43:04] too much of that right now
[1:43:06] we need a new man in the coach
[1:43:09] get a new man in the coat then the cult
[1:43:12] will reflect
[1:43:13] the new man on the inside amen if the
[1:43:16] man on the inside
[1:43:17] ever gets really changed and really born
[1:43:20] again then you don't have to worry
[1:43:22] the cult will only reflect the work of
[1:43:25] redemption
[1:43:26] on the inside it will reflect the very
[1:43:29] image
[1:43:29] and life of jesus christ we bury that
[1:43:33] first nature that first nature is gone
[1:43:36] and now we are the nature of him
[1:43:39] he lives in us and we don't do our own
[1:43:42] will
[1:43:43] we do his will we don't think our own
[1:43:46] thoughts
[1:43:47] the mind is what thinks the mind that
[1:43:49] was in christ he's in every believer
[1:43:51] there is the soul and that's what we're
[1:43:54] speaking of
[1:43:55] paul said to be carnally minded as death
[1:43:58] but to be spiritually minded is life
[1:44:01] the carnal mind is enmity against god
[1:44:03] for it is not
[1:44:05] subject to the law of god neither indeed
[1:44:08] can be
[1:44:09] think of it god bringing that carnal
[1:44:11] mind bringing that
[1:44:13] that first nature into a place to where
[1:44:16] it's
[1:44:17] laying down the bible says he giveth the
[1:44:20] holy ghost to them that
[1:44:22] obey him what's he doing he's bringing
[1:44:25] it to a place
[1:44:26] of submission now he's not playing
[1:44:30] remember that old nature
[1:44:32] he ain't the father of that old nature
[1:44:36] he don't claim that right the only one
[1:44:39] he claims
[1:44:40] is his children his children
[1:44:43] are the firstborn amen they're born
[1:44:47] of his spirit washed in his blood
[1:44:50] they're no longer the same person
[1:44:53] they used to be they're not just trying
[1:44:57] to do right there's been a
[1:44:58] change on the inside that has taken
[1:45:01] place
[1:45:02] their desire is to please god
[1:45:06] the things of the world has passed away
[1:45:10] it's a perishing a rotting a passing
[1:45:12] away
[1:45:13] there's a new man a new woman
[1:45:16] a son or daughter of god on the inside
[1:45:20] that carnal mind can never be subject
[1:45:24] to the law of god it cannot please god
[1:45:27] this is why god
[1:45:28] must move to eradicate it
[1:45:31] to move it amen
[1:45:35] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:45:37] cannot please god
[1:45:39] you might think well this heaven i mean
[1:45:43] i combed it if you got here
[1:45:44] i combed it today or i did this or i did
[1:45:47] that but when he's talking about in the
[1:45:49] flesh is
[1:45:50] you're no longer under that same nature
[1:45:55] you're no longer under that first
[1:45:57] husband
[1:45:58] you're no longer under that there has
[1:46:01] been a death
[1:46:03] a burial and you've had to be married
[1:46:06] again to jesus christ
[1:46:10] what did this love
[1:46:14] love this is why the bible says and ye
[1:46:18] are not in the flesh but in the spirit
[1:46:21] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[1:46:23] you
[1:46:23] now if any man hath not the spirit of
[1:46:26] christ
[1:46:27] he's none of his let me close on this
[1:46:29] one we'll just stop
[1:46:32] the brahms talking about healing
[1:46:33] yourself the message the great
[1:46:35] commission let's talk about healing
[1:46:36] of the physical body he's talking about
[1:46:40] how that physical body has got to die
[1:46:42] it's got to perish he said
[1:46:43] so did the soul have to perish
[1:46:48] the thoughts the soul
[1:46:51] is the nature of the spirit
[1:46:54] and those thoughts and so forth in you
[1:46:58] had to perish before
[1:47:01] the new man could be borne into you
[1:47:05] to make you a new creature in christ
[1:47:10] you see some so many times it's the
[1:47:12] fault is it been well
[1:47:14] god will just come in and then he's the
[1:47:15] one that eradicates everything
[1:47:18] it's surrendering to him it's aligning
[1:47:21] with his word see god deals with our
[1:47:23] heart
[1:47:23] by justification calling us to himself
[1:47:26] then sanctification is where brethren
[1:47:28] explains in future home
[1:47:30] is where he sets the mind in order for
[1:47:33] holiness
[1:47:34] where you begin to think about things
[1:47:37] differently
[1:47:38] you begin to as you're aligning i don't
[1:47:40] want to do this i don't want to do that
[1:47:42] this would displease him
[1:47:43] i don't want to do that i need to get
[1:47:44] rid of this and i need what is it it's
[1:47:46] sanctifying
[1:47:48] he's getting it lined up this is the
[1:47:50] part where brother ram
[1:47:51] tells us and the scripture says a new
[1:47:53] heart and a new spirit i will give you
[1:47:55] think of that a new heart and new spirit
[1:47:58] that is
[1:47:59] figurative of god dealing with our it's
[1:48:02] figurative
[1:48:03] of god dealing with our life to bring us
[1:48:07] to a place to say father
[1:48:11] i'm leaving i'm calling i'm here you
[1:48:14] call
[1:48:15] i'm leaving my kindred i'm leaving my
[1:48:19] associates
[1:48:21] i'm leaving i i'm not i don't want to
[1:48:23] touch that unclean thing
[1:48:24] what's he doing he's calling and you're
[1:48:27] yielding
[1:48:28] it's the spirit of god working and
[1:48:30] wooing
[1:48:31] and drawing us to himself
[1:48:34] sometimes that rotting as we said i'll
[1:48:37] close
[1:48:38] sometimes this this process itself you
[1:48:41] can set
[1:48:42] a person sometimes can maybe for a long
[1:48:44] time
[1:48:46] it isn't god's fault
[1:48:50] god doesn't have down a pattern that
[1:48:52] well you're going to get the baptism of
[1:48:54] the holy ghost set right there on the
[1:48:55] pew
[1:48:56] or at the altar or that god doesn't have
[1:48:58] that kind of a pattern
[1:48:59] but the pattern that god does have is
[1:49:01] that you are going to come
[1:49:03] through hearing the word amen
[1:49:07] the spirit of god is going to deal with
[1:49:08] your heart
[1:49:10] your heart will be turned to him you
[1:49:12] repent of
[1:49:13] your sins see this is one of the major
[1:49:15] problems
[1:49:17] is there's not been a real repentance
[1:49:20] the holy ghost will never come where
[1:49:22] there's not a real repentance
[1:49:24] but the bible says repent and be
[1:49:27] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:49:29] that's all part
[1:49:30] of justification god calling the life
[1:49:35] yet what made the person do it is still
[1:49:37] there then god begins to deal
[1:49:40] to now where the mind thinking
[1:49:43] i don't want to do that i shouldn't do
[1:49:45] this i shouldn't do that what's god
[1:49:47] doing he sets the mind
[1:49:49] in order for holiness
[1:49:52] it's god aligning everything
[1:49:55] of that old nature that he might move in
[1:49:59] not just move in but take care of that
[1:50:02] old man
[1:50:03] this is coming out of and going into
[1:50:08] this is what redemption is all about
[1:50:12] it's not god coming in where we're at
[1:50:15] but god calling us
[1:50:17] out see what's happening this the spirit
[1:50:20] of god is calling
[1:50:21] to a son and daughter of god it's
[1:50:23] beckoning that you see
[1:50:24] the flesh itself remember what jesus
[1:50:26] said flesh and blood
[1:50:28] profiteth nothing
[1:50:31] is that right i might say that that my
[1:50:34] flesh
[1:50:35] has been blessed it has
[1:50:38] because my contact with my heavenly
[1:50:41] father
[1:50:42] has has allowed this house to get well
[1:50:46] it saved it from a whole lot of more
[1:50:47] scars it's really it's
[1:50:49] it's done it real well and matter of
[1:50:52] fact one of these days
[1:50:54] it's going to be changed
[1:51:02] it's god working sovereignty to move
[1:51:05] that life
[1:51:06] into a complete and full agreement
[1:51:09] with him god working on that life
[1:51:14] moving on that life come out be a
[1:51:17] separate
[1:51:18] touch not the unclean thing i will
[1:51:21] receive you unto myself
[1:51:23] i will be a father unto you
[1:51:27] and you shall be my sons and daughters
[1:51:30] saith the lord almighty
[1:51:34] samuel what do i do surrender
[1:51:38] surrender surrender sometimes i've heard
[1:51:42] over the years i've had people that'll
[1:51:43] call me what does brother samuel mean by
[1:51:45] dying
[1:51:46] what does he mean by dying out see you
[1:51:48] can't explain that
[1:51:50] but it's when you if i could make it try
[1:51:52] to make it as simple as you can
[1:51:53] it's when you get tired of being you
[1:51:58] when you no longer love the world you
[1:52:02] have a hatred for it
[1:52:04] you have to detest for it that's god
[1:52:07] turn in your heart
[1:52:08] then it's time god moving to a place
[1:52:11] to remove that old nature then that new
[1:52:14] nature sets in
[1:52:17] it's a work of redemption i tell you
[1:52:19] what a wonderful
[1:52:20] time that we're living in friends this
[1:52:22] is a time that we're right now
[1:52:24] you realize we are right now on the very
[1:52:27] verge
[1:52:28] of crossing over
[1:52:31] it's a time of such seriousness it's a
[1:52:33] time of sincerity that's not to scare
[1:52:35] you
[1:52:36] but it's a time to let the spirit of god
[1:52:38] search us out
[1:52:40] it's a time to make decisions it's a
[1:52:42] time to where
[1:52:43] if the spirit of god if it's never moved
[1:52:45] to that place in your life and
[1:52:47] that old man is still there it's a time
[1:52:49] to say lord god
[1:52:51] lead me to that place lord i want to be
[1:52:54] completely submissive
[1:52:55] to where that new man can be born on the
[1:52:58] inside
[1:52:59] and the new man that's been born on the
[1:53:01] inside the spirit of god that moves
[1:53:04] within our hearts says lord
[1:53:06] i want to please you i don't want
[1:53:07] nothing lord between me and you
[1:53:10] it even grieves you it can it can
[1:53:12] convict you
[1:53:13] if there's something that you've either
[1:53:15] thought wrong spoke wrong
[1:53:17] he convicts you right there why does
[1:53:19] that your heavenly father
[1:53:21] and he let you know this is not how a
[1:53:23] son or daughter
[1:53:25] acts or conducts themselves and he
[1:53:28] corrects you
[1:53:28] in your desires yes father i have a
[1:53:31] father
[1:53:32] lord i don't want that in my life
[1:53:34] sometimes things can come
[1:53:35] so subtly but the spirit of god comes
[1:53:39] down
[1:53:39] he begins to move on your life and what
[1:53:41] happens
[1:53:42] that desire that's already there that's
[1:53:45] pulsating on the inside
[1:53:46] a desire that desires to please him
[1:53:49] above everything else
[1:53:50] what does it do it stirs that up it's a
[1:53:52] new man it's a son and daughter of god
[1:53:55] on the inside that says father
[1:53:58] forgive me maybe i've had this feeling
[1:54:02] had this grudge or i've had this but all
[1:54:05] of a sudden the spirit of god
[1:54:06] passes over your life and you realize
[1:54:10] i didn't even realize i had this i
[1:54:13] remember years and years ago i remember
[1:54:14] different times sometimes you
[1:54:16] your ministry you don't know why god
[1:54:17] takes you down a certain pathway
[1:54:20] the spirit of god was dealing in a
[1:54:22] situation
[1:54:24] and right in the service here an
[1:54:26] individual
[1:54:27] there was something clear back in their
[1:54:29] life truly a christian
[1:54:31] through and throughout but there's
[1:54:33] something they realized
[1:54:36] that they had harbored since a young
[1:54:38] person
[1:54:39] against one of their parents right after
[1:54:42] that service was over
[1:54:44] they went to that parent they didn't
[1:54:47] even pause
[1:54:48] they went to their house said forgive me
[1:54:52] i've had this bitterness that i didn't
[1:54:54] even know i had
[1:54:55] in my heart or if he to god
[1:54:59] what is that it's a son and daughter of
[1:55:01] god that when the spirit of god
[1:55:03] the this x-ray the scan of the holy
[1:55:05] ghost begins to go over like we're
[1:55:07] talking about on thursday
[1:55:08] it begins to deal with that life and
[1:55:10] there's something about it
[1:55:11] as a son and daughter of god you say
[1:55:13] that's not who i am
[1:55:15] and you realize that in your life you
[1:55:17] don't make excuses for it
[1:55:20] you're not dwelling here no more
[1:55:24] get out
[1:55:28] let's pray amen if you want to be
[1:55:32] remembered in prayer this morning
