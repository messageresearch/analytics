this morning amen praise the name of the lord amen so good to be in the house of the lord so good to be gathered together amen in his presence amen is this these are truly the highlights of our life amen to be in his presence because what takes place in the presence of the lord it then affects everything else throughout the course of our life god don't need a lot of time he just needs just a moment think of it for the rapture itself will be changed in a twinkling of an eye even before you could bat your eye that's how fast the change will come it shows god working among his people to bring us to a place of such yieldedness such trust in his presence god only needed five minutes and it wasn't even five minutes he needed but it was five minutes in the presence of the lord where moses walked out as a conqueror where 40 years of training could never accomplish it it just shows god knows what every one of us have need of here this morning i'll tell you i just want to take in the word of the lord as it's coming we had such a wonderful time here on thursday just a wonderful word of the lord that god has given to us and i'll tell you that way of dying there's no other way to replace that but to think of it that through that through the new birth in our life because it can't come without a death to self but that makes way for dying daily how many testify to that dying daily thank god that there's a greater life on the inside to bring this other part in subjection and we desire to please him don't we amen just so enjoyed every my goodness the song song service and just enjoyed the the special singing amen i i love that so much what uh what a word that god has has given to us and i want to say here this morning as we prepare to turn the service over to brother jerry so glad to have he and sister mina here with us and um lord willing he'll be ministering for us here this morning and then as well on thursday evening for us uh also want to say it's just been a real real joy and a real privilege for us as a congregation to have sister soriano here with us amen and we're going to have a little foretaste of what that marriage supper is going to be like because we have a fellowship dinner planned this for this afternoon and we just are we want to just take that time and it gives you a time to be able to express your love to sister soriano appreciation and also to fellowship with one another amen i'm just so glad for that aren't you well you know it does something in my heart brother branham when he could see in the message shalom he said i see you all have brought your lunches [Music] in order to sit down with one another after this service and have a meal together he said that just warms my heart because fellowship is not just an option it's essential it's a part of the christian walk amen so we just we're so thankful to that the address is posted there it's a different place than we've been before but if you don't have it the address just it's posted in the bulletin boards it's there in the amherst historical society also want to remind you brother jack duff will be here on sunday august 7th so that's two weeks from um this

know but so we're just looking forward to to a good time amen i'll tell you what all we have is good things ahead amen what we have is good things ahead sure there's tests there's trials to come but that's not the focus of the believer amen we we already have received a token amen we know where we're going amen and we thank god for that amen also brother barry before i turn the service over brother barry asked us to mention once again there's still some spots open for the men's meeting anyone would desire to go i know there's many brothers that have already signed up here for that and to go so if you need that link just see us we'll also try to get it out maybe sister roseanne will try to send it out by email this link that brother barry sent out here today as well so how many ready

there's a lighthouse on a hillside that overlooks life [Music] that i might see and the light that shines in darkness now we'll savely the sword if it wasn't for [Music] no more and i thank god [Music] to him for jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin he had shown a light around me that i might clearly see if it wasn't for lighthouse tell me where would this ship be [Music] you know everybody lives around us they say why don't you just tear that old lighthouse down the big ships they don't sell this way anymore there's no use of it standing round but then my mind goes back to that stormy night when just [Music] that stand up there on a hill and i thank god [Music] [Music] of sin [Music] he has shown the light around [Music] please me if it wasn't for the lighthouse tell

that have been sung lord and the worship that has went forth lord your holy spirit moving over the people now i ask god at this point of the service lord me lord you anoint me to do what you called me to do lord and to get out of the way that you may come and speak words of life to the people lord we ask this dear god in the name of jesus christ and give all the glory to you amen amen praise the lord i'd like to read from john chapter one begin at verse 45 read down through verse 51. philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did rise jesus of nazareth the son of joseph nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith in him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael said unto him whence knoweth thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou was under the fig tree i saw thee nathanael answered and said unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel and jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under fig tree believeth thou. thou shalt see greater things than these and he said him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man you may be seated i'd like to title this message this morning in whom there is no guile to be without guile means to be free of deceit it means to be free of cunning or hypocrisy or dishonesty or in thought or action anything false beguiled means to deceive or to lead astray just the opposite of having no guile there was one in the garden who was full of guile and the bible says that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field and that he used his beauty and his substitute to beguile the woman and the way that he did it was by starting out quoting her the words if we could say the serpent began to preach a sermon to eve and it he got eve to agreeing with him he got eve to saying amen what you say is true and then after he got her going along that path then he injected something that was a little different from the message of the hour but he started off by using quotes of the message and eve said yes it's true we can eat of every tree the garden of every tree of the garden except the tree of knowledge of good and evil for in the day we eat thereof we shall die and the serpent said surely you'll not die i mean why would god create you just to kill you surely he's not going to kill you surely you're not going to die but what god knows is the day you eat thereof that you'll be as gods friends i want you to know something they already were as gods they had rule over the earth the prophet says adam could speak to a tree and move it from one place to another they were already gods over this this earth but you see satan wanted to be god over the earth and the only way he could do it was to knock man out of his position [Applause] and so he went excuse me but he went to the weakest league he didn't go talk to her why adam was present he waited till he could get her off to the side away from adam to where he can begin to work on it but look at the way the devil does it today he doesn't want to come while christ is present he wants to come to the church if he can gets you a side where you're aside off to yourself and then begin to talk to you and you see where eve went wrong was she began to listen the church began to listen i'm going to tell you something there are many out there today that are trying to beguile the church of god you see what do i do about these sites and believe the sign and all these different things don't listen to them i'm not afraid you'll be deceived because the prophet said this this eve of this age cannot be deceived [Music] [Applause] but why give it your time it's a waste of time listen i was never in one of brother branham's meetings but i know it's true i know that he spoke the squirrels into existence i know that he's that when he spoke a little fist came back to life so how do you know the same way i know that god come down through jesus christ and took mud and anointed a blind man's eyes and he saw again i wasn't there but i believe why because there's something inside of me that says amen to it i'm not afraid of being shaken i don't want to hear their argument [Music] [Applause] let me just bring this into perspective for you in this world today there are those that argue for the lbgt or whatever it's called all right i'm not going to be deceived by them because i know what the word says but i don't want to give time to their arguments i don't want to give time to what they have to say because i know what the word says and i know that the word said that before the great and dreadful coming of the lord that he would send elijah the prophet and no man that stands up today and puts all of his filth on the internet can stand up to the elijah that came in this day [Applause] amen it isn't about him calling someone's name out or telling him where they're from telling things that nobody could know but god it isn't just that he never failed it never would he never once had to say oh excuse me uh i'm sorry i got that wrong let me see them bring eyes into eye sockets that had no eyeballs and say excuse me little girl i forgot to ask you what color you wanted [Applause] the word that we have received did not come through enticing words but it came through power and demonstration of the spirit [Music] [Applause] it didn't come in a beguiling way when it came to call out of pride from the beginning ways of the religions of the day [Applause] remember adam and eve they hid themselves before they realized they were naked the prophet said show me an apple that could do that he said let's start passing out the apples friends listen brother branham saul as it were he saw a woman wearing like fig leaves just things to cover up certain areas they don't even do that anymore it's went beyond that the prophet said before the coming of the lord this world will go totally insane when i was a boy and heard those words i had a different thought on perhaps what they meant i was thinking about people losing their minds going into institutions and all that no friends this world's insane it's they wear around things it makes you think of the story of the emperor's new clothes the bible says they're naked and don't know it he said who told you you were naked adam said the woman you gave me she gave me the fruit night eight she said the serpent beguiled me the serpent deceived me why because she began to listen to him and after some time it began to sound pretty good i think about these people who have left churches over their pastor leaving the message and then they begin to go back and listen to what he has to say and listen to what these others have to say and the next thing you know they leave and go back like a dog going back to its vomit paul says they went out from us because they were never one of us i've got i've got no interest in listening to the devil i've got no interest in listening to the serpent i got no interest in listening to the serpent's seed this is a day of identifying jesus told us that when they speak evil of you rejoice in that day and they cast your name as he he says rejoice in that day because so did they the prophets and i've always went to that scripture and said that was an identifying scripture because it shows identification there were those that are fulfilling the part of the prophecy that jesus prophesied and they're casting people's names out as evil but there's those that are having their names cast out as evil and it shows what side there are i would not want to be standing in the shoes of one that's casting out the prophet's name as something evil he was a man he was not god but he was a prophet and the bible says touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm god said to the serpent because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go listen friends if he was already on his belly what kind of a curse would this have been [Music] he wasn't the bible says he was the most subtle beast of the field not serpent not reptile there were reptiles but he was not a reptile he was a beast brother says they're looking for the missing link he says and they've been trying for thousands of years to get a chimpanzee to talk and they'll never accomplish it he said they can get it to do sign language they can get it to to tip its hat they can get it to smile he said that's like gehan hall to a horse god so [Music] cursed the serpent to where now it is not even recognizable that's their missing link the prophet said was the serpent in the garden it was a beast walked on two legs the closest thing to man listen he says i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed two different seeds right here god tells you the serpent had a seed i don't see why it's so hard for people to accept serpent seed because it says it here clearly this isn't something some man made up between thy seed so the serpent had a seed and her seed and her seed was the promise of one to come that would restore creation back one that would come that would redeem man back from its fallen state because he said it shall bruise thy head i want you to know that on calvary he crushed his head [Applause] god put him plumb back words friends what what did he do he changed the molecular structure of the serpent and caused him to crawl on his belt and he says from this day forward you shall the dust shall you eat so he wasn't doing it before that turned me to second corinthians chapter 11. verses two and three paul writes for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as a serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ here we find paul saying as the serpent beguiled eve i fear lest that your minds would be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ what is the simplicity that's in christ only relief [Music] well how is this going to happen only belief how is he going to do it only belief you know a child faith the bible refers to it a child like faith perhaps i've told you this story before but years ago when my family and i lived up here our youngest boy nathaniel he was sick he was just just a young child i don't even remember if he was in school yet or not and the other his siblings were going outside to play in the snow and his mother told him you can't go outside and play you're sick and so he left and he went upstairs and he found his papa brother bill and he says papa i'm sick pray for me so he prayed for him nathaniel came back downstairs and began to put on his coat his mother said i told you you couldn't go outside you're sick he said i'm not sick anymore papa prayed for me [Music] [Applause] and he wasn't sick anymore look friends this this i'm not telling you some kind of fairy tale i'm telling you when he put on his jacket he was no longer sick why because he didn't believe he was he believed that prayer [Music] [Applause] my little granddaughter rose she gets something wrong she comes with papa pray for me why because she believes that once she's prayed for everything will be all right i thank god their parents teach them like that but that childlike faith that's the simplicity that's in christ if we could have that childlike faith whatsoever you ask in my name you shall receive it if you ask for a fish will i not give you a fish hallelujah that's the bible he says your earthly fathers know how to give good gifts how much more to your heavenly father that he knows what you have need of before you even ask but he wants to hear his children ask friends look he's my hero [Applause] when my children were growing up if they broke something at home they would take it to their mother and say here fix this and she miraculously would fix it to them tape glue or whatever it took fix it if it's broke mom can fix it she was their hero when they were little children now they have a problem they call me dad i got this dad i need that and you know what i do it doesn't matter i go and do it you know why i like being the hero god is your hero he is there for you and has always been there for you he said that he will be with us even in us [Applause] hallelujah so it isn't just that you're looking for somebody that's out here but he's right in here [Applause] he's here to heal friends you're not going to need divine healing during the millennium once the rapture takes place you're not going to need divine healing why because we're going to be restored back to the way it was at the beginning [Music] but we need it now now is when we need divine healing and he said i'm the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases a double l hallelujah i'm sure if we give time there would be many testimonies throughout this assembly of different things that god has already healed you from he's still that same god today hallelujah i think when you go home tonight brother branham says and humble thyself if you'll read the book of jude where it says i earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints they got away from from it how man of corrupt mind and so forth have come in and beguiled the people away from the real things of god when the children of israel were in the wilderness and there were snakes serpents that came in among them poisonous serpents and god instructed moses to make a brass serpent and put it on a pole and then if anyone was bit when they looked at this brass circle on the pole they would live and what the br brass represents judgment and the serpent represented sin from the garden and it was made of brass because it represented that sin had already been judged when was sin judged when he said her seed will bruise thy head he had already judged sin so when they looked at this representation of the brass serpent on the pole sin being judged they were healed they lived sin has already been judged today divine judgment had fallen upon sin brother adam says patmos vision judgment had already passed upon him when he was when yet there was no sinner salvation being entirely of the lord he trod the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of god alone his vestures were dyed crimson with his own blood the fiery furnace of the just judgment of wrath god was his portion he suffered the just for the unjust thou art worthy o lamb of god for thou has redeemed us by thine own blood he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed the lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all he suffered as no man ever suffered even before the cross he had shed great drops of sweat like blood from his body as in the intense agony of the ordeal ahead and the very blood separated in his veins the chastisement of our peace is upon him how many times have we been in situations where we felt no peace no rest but god would come in his infinite mercy and he didn't sit down and explain to you how everything was going to turn out right he just comforts you with his presence and your faith that everything's going to be all right because his word says all things work together for the good of them that love the lord that are called according to his purpose a peace that passes all understanding just comes down upon you so how are you going to get out of this i don't know but he's the liver corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ brother branham said here's the simplicity of prayer your faith he said it's not how long your prayer is it's if you believe he was talking to a man who had tuberculosis brother branham prayed and said dear god you who have made the death here in the blind see and the dumb speak thou can heal our brother of this tuberculosis i pray father you'll grant it may leave him in the name of jesus christ god bless you my brother now look it's not how long the prayer is it's your faith that does it christ brother adam said preached in simplicity is what stirs the people if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto me christ preaching simplicity not the deceitful words and and wily ways and oh i've got this great mystery you must understand now i'm the only one that's got this god gave it to me and if william branham was here why he had to sit and listen to me you say surely not oh yeah that's been said a man one preacher said and he got his people believing he was the only one that had the true revelation of the godhead and that if brother branham was here he'd have to sit down and listen to him to get it straight well they didn't believe that he was the prophet that come to finish all mysteries then they didn't believe the word then cunning ways deceitfulness beguiling the people men have come and tried to call people out one one man preaching called out a certain sister i won't name her but y'all she's well known but they called her out and said you've got such and such a problem if you know this sister she stood up and said no i don't you're wrong yeah you do you just don't know it well time proves all things you know she didn't have it when christ is preached in simplicity yet in its power when christ the living god has been brought to reality to the people that's what god did in this last age we we hear that brother branham's ministry came to introduce christ to this age well didn't people already know christ didn't people already know about christ they had been beguiled they had been led astray from the word that had been delivered to them in their day and so god sent a prophet to tie up all the loose ends and bring everything back and put us back on the path of the word but he saw in a vision the presenting of the bride of course he mentioned about the bride of miss usa but then when he mentioned about said the bride must come again and you mentioned about the bride of christ coming and he saw some couple getting out of step in the back he said stay in step that's what god's telling us today that's what he's telling us in this time the messages that you hear preach is god telling us getting us in step get us back in step do not be beguiled like eve was beguiled away from the simplicity which is in christ jesus brother says i'll tell you brother what we need today is old-fashioned simple gospel holy ghost preached in his simplicity when we say god heals friends then he's up to the challenge you can put it to the test he'll heal some years ago there was a sister in my assembly she was very sickly and she was constantly going into the hospital and anytime she would go into the hospital i would go up and pray for and god would raise her back up her brother tried to entice her away from the church she was she was uh single she was on her own she had no family around there around our church but she came faithful and [Music] even times when she had to sit in a wheelchair she came and was faithful the brother tried to entice her away to come down move where he was at and we'll just have church up here on the mountain last i heard he was getting high on cocaine but she said no god sent me here she said god told me this that brother jerry was my pastor and i'm not leaving here so many times as i said she went in the hospital the last time she went in the hospital her brother showed up there the same time i did and they led us in the back and she would always ask me brother jerry is god going to take me is this my time is god going to heal me and i would pray for her time and time again and god would raise her up but this time there was something different it dropped in and i told her i said sister what more healing could you ask for than to be in a new body in the next few moments that was good enough for her she had been holding the doctors off from giving her any kind of medication that would make her go unconscious until i got there to talk to her after i left from talking to her because they had her in intensive care they only let you in there for so long then she told them go ahead and give me the medicine she was in so much pain her legs had bust open and then i got a call later on that night from someone and they said brother jerry said she's unconscious she's up here at the hospital said i've got something i want to confess to her could you come up here and and pray for her that god will bring her back to so i went up there and i asked the nurses put him aside said i'm her pastor i want to ask you if she come back to how would her state be they said she'd be out of her mind i went in there i didn't pray out loud i just took all of her hand i said god if there's nothing stopping her from crossing over and being with you then go ahead and take her don't bring her back awake in this life and i walked out they called me by the time i got home they called me said she's passed she was healed she was walking in a new body [Applause] she no longer had all the diseases and ailments that she suffered in this life hallelujah that's the simplicity of the gospel philip findeth nathanael and say to him we have found him who moses in the law and the prophet said right jesus nazareth son of joseph nathaniel said unto him can any good thing come out of nashville that's a bad place he was skeptical philip didn't try to say anything else to convince him he just said come and see come and see for yourself so nathaniel gets up and he goes to see for himself and as he's approaching jesus says behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile there is nothing false about him jesus never said he was without sin he said he was without guile he was without deceit friends there's not a one of us can stand up and say we're without sin in the bible it says if any man say he is he hasn't sinned he's a liar but we can be without guile we can be without deceit we can be without falseness brother of adam says he never liked anybody who put on something they like uh you remember in the bible when the pharisees came jesus gives this parable by the pharisee two men come to pharisee in a publican the pharisees stands and said i think the i'm not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers even as this publican i fast twice a week i give tithes of all i possess he didn't say a thing about pride because he was full of that but the publican you know what a republican was he was a look friends israelites looked on other israelites the republicans they were tax collectors for rome and they looked at the other israelites that would stoop to becoming a tax collector for long for rome they looked down on them they wanted nothing to do with them can you imagine the other disciples when god when jesus called matthew we don't want to associate with him [Music] but in the bible the republicans smote his breast he wouldn't even lift his eyes up to heaven he smote his breast and said god have mercy on me a sinner and jesus said which one of the two went out more just the pharisee was trying to justify himself i don't do this and i don't do that and i don't do this and this is what i do i fast and i i give my tithing and which one was more just the one trying to justify himself or the one steeped in self-deception and guile the pharisee was full of guile full of deceit saul got lifted up in the bible he didn't obey god he kept the best of the of the cattle the best of the sheep brought even brought the king back i have kept all the words of the lord samuel says what's this lowing of the ox that i hear and here's what he tells him he says thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the lord commanded thee stephen before he was stoned spoken and talked about and said david the son of jesse a man after god's own heart but david wasn't free of sin david wasn't free of mistakes but he was free of guile psalms 32 2 says blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity in whose spirit there is no guile david when he was confronted with his sin he confessed and he asked for forgiveness saul made excuses well it was the people you know the people were pressing on me and because of the people i i kept the best and and besides we were going to sacrifice them to to god he says obedience is better than sacrifice obedience is better to obey god hallelujah then you nathaniel was not a man that was free of mistakes jesus never said that he never said that nathaniel was never going to make any mistakes but friends nathanael when he saw the demonstration of the power of god in jesus he said you're the son of god there was something inside of him that recognized he was skeptical when philip told him but when jesus spoke to him it touched something on the inside something a man couldn't touch something a man couldn't do but when he heard the words of almighty god it brought something alive within him it isn't man's words that have brought you to this message it isn't man's words that have brought you to this but it's god's word it's god's voice that is spoken through the men that god has placed it wasn't their words it wasn't their voices but it was the voice of many wallets eve didn't recognize the voice behind the voice the voice of the serpent had a voice behind it it was the voice of satan and i'm going to tell you something those that are trying to lead people away from this message they're serpent seed the voice that is behind them is the voice of satan recognize the voice i just believe that it happened amen hallelujah i don't have a facebook but i have saw on facebook some of these ones that look if you got a facebook i'm not condemning you but i've saw on facebook some of these ones who have left the message pictures of them sitting around a table outside drinking beer pictures of them with their cut hair and wearing pants why because they were under such bondage now they can do what they want they've been beguiled they've been deceived and they're being used by satan brother brahm says i've made many mistakes i still make them we'll always make them but when i make them the holy spirit tells me what's wrong then i repent right there that's the simplicity of the gospel that's the simplicity that's in christ jesus when you're made of wherever you you repent right then lord i'm sorry i didn't mean that i didn't mean to do that lord forgive me i didn't mean to do it you helped me now and i walk right on the same cause just no sooner than it goes from my lips if we confess our sins he is just you forgive them is that right the devil said you know what i tell you you're supposed to go do a certain thing you didn't do it uh-huh you sinned didn't you i say i confessed it said well i tell you no don't talk to me i have perfect faith in he who told me if i confessed my wrongs he'd forgive me so i confessed it just go on away from me i don't care anything about you anyhow so just keep moving on walk boldly right on into it if death lays there that's all right move right on into it with perfect faith that god has promised he'd raise you up at the last day i got a lot of respects for a man when he does make a mistake he's got the courage enough to rise and try again we're all going to make mistakes the best makes mistakes for i have made many mistakes in my life as we all have but i always be thankful to god for grace to let me rise and try again i believe the song is entitled forgive me lord and try me one more time i think it is if i fail or if i sin let me rise and try again take me back and try me one more time i love that we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them stumble and falling has not one thing to do with it a real true servant if he stumbles he'll get right up again if he wobbles god will pull him right back into the path as long as he's in the path of duty as long as he's in the path of duty god's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or a woman we're human when i got the whole yost i got it in here down in my soul i still got a human spirit i still got memories of my sin i still have to deal with reasoning i still have affections and imagination and this flesh is still in contact with this world this flesh didn't get the holy ghost this flesh is still in the fallen state this flesh still signifies that sin in the garden it still signifies of one who was beguiled but there's something in here that cannot be beguiled because man didn't give it to me and man can't take it away [Music] hallelujah there's not one thing that any man can say that will shake me i'm unmovable i'm at rest i stand firm like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved [Music] and one day i'll stand with the large redeemed before the throne of christ hallelujah got no time for their foolishness i know it for what it is it's the beguiling ways of the devil and the bible said there would be a great falling away before the man of sin was revealed and that's what that's what we're experiencing that tells you what time we're in where we're at on god's timeline the great falling away right before the man of sin is to be revealed and before the man of sin is revealed the bride goes up the bride will not be here hallelujah i'm looking forward to leaving i've got too much over there [Applause] i've got more laid up over there than i have here i've got more to go to heaven for than i did yesterday hallelujah there's not one thing can hold me here i'm thankful for all god gives me but not one of them am i willing to hang on to and miss the rapture over hallelujah no guile no deceit nothing false nothing put on brother adam said he hated somebody to have something put on remember he would quote uh congressman upshaw you can't be nothing you hate he said just keep that in mind when you try to impersonate something while you're just putting on god knows about it the people knows also just might as well just be yourself i'm not putting on to be holy it's not my holiness it's jesus christ's holiness i'm not putting on to be a righteous person but my righteousness is because of his righteousness i'm made worthy because he was found worthy brother and says oh deliver me from being an actor be what you are god will bless you you even down see sometimes ministers will do that they'll get up in the pulpit make their voices very big and say i have now received my degree like it had run shivers over you i feel for them people don't appreciate that just be yourself people will appreciate you more just be plain old sassafras hickory smoked ham sorghum molasses it'll do you good don't put on the bible says that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much elias was a man subject to life's like passions as we are elijah got weak elijah had struggles with his humanity he he felt fear lord just go ahead and kill me he got depressed he got down even after having such a glorious service that he had where he cut off the heads of 400 prophets saw fire come down out of heaven and consume not only the sacrifice but everything the water in the trenches and the and the the altar and all of it he came out of such a meeting and got depressed because of a woman that was after him he was subject to like passions he was tempted he was tested but yet when he prayed it stopped raining that was god judging israel for their sin the heavens came as brass judgment and when he prayed again it rained right he wasn't sinless but he was without guile elijah wasn't a put on he wasn't an actor friends when he was up there on mount carmel and he put out that challenge he said go ahead said uh call your god bill come down and set a fire to your sacrifice boy they were doing all kinds of things the bible said they even cut themselves and screamed aloud because elijah said maybe your god's gone on vacation maybe he's gone on a long trip and he can't hear you and they screamed the louder but no fire came down but elijah said the fire was going to come down and consume his his sacrifice that wasn't no put on he could say that because god had spoke it was thus saith the lord without the channel just see who's the true god god was obligated prove he was the true god hallelujah that wasn't a you can imagine then we find out who were the actors who were the ones who were putting on before the people who were the fakes who were the fakers but elijah was true he was real he was just who he was he never presented himself to be sinless but he presented himself to be a servant of jehovah hallelujah i don't know nothing false how can we say that because of the grace of almighty god just be yourself you know satan's always there to bring accusation and he'll always send one of his people by to accuse you well i thought you were a christian i am i remember my dad he worked years ago he worked at union carbide he was working on the docks and there was a man there worked with him it was constantly taunting him constantly tormenting him and
