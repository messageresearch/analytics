[29:30] Oh. Oh. But I have been delivered by the
[29:35] blood of the lamb. I've been covered.

[32:06] everything I have.

[35:55] your grace abounds
[36:00] to me like a fire.
[36:08] The fire
[36:13] that was
[36:15] burning
[36:18] Glory
[36:20] [Applause]
[36:23] [Music]
[36:30] that
[36:32] is holy.

[36:39] Hallelujah.
[36:40] Hallelujah.
[36:41] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[36:44] Amen.
[36:44] Amen.
[36:45] Let's just stand. Let's
[36:48] stand here this evening and
[36:51] man so good to be gathered together.
[36:53] Amen.
[36:54] Good to see each and everyone and Amen.
[36:59] So thankful for God's grace in each of
[37:02] our lives.
[37:03] Amen.
[37:04] Amen. You know, it's even in being here,
[37:06] it's overcoming.
[37:08] It's overcoming. And you wouldn't you
[37:11] wouldn't be here if there wasn't a
[37:13] desire to be here.
[37:15] And God put that desire within our
[37:17] hearts to be here. Sometimes we can feel
[37:20] it's a little natural because of what we
[37:22] have to press through. But there's
[37:24] something that gives you the strength to
[37:26] press through.
[37:28] Something that gives you that uncction
[37:30] to say, "Let's go. Let's move on beyond
[37:33] our feelings." And that's where we
[37:35] that's where we bring that flesh in
[37:37] subjection. But aren't you glad there's
[37:38] a there's a there's a call in our
[37:41] hearts. Lord, I want to hear from you,
[37:44] Lord.
[37:45] I want to hear from you. I want to be
[37:47] gathered. I want to see my brothers, my
[37:49] sister. I want to be I want to be right
[37:51] in your presence, Lord. Amen. God bless
[37:54] you this evening. Let's just approach
[37:55] him in a word of prayer before we look
[37:58] into the word.
[38:00] Heavenly Father,
[38:03] Lord, truly with the words of the song
[38:06] that Lord that have been
[38:10] expressed and sung here tonight,
[38:13] the only thing, our only desire is you,
[38:16] Lord.
[38:18] And oh God, I pray that you would so
[38:22] continue to guide and direct every part
[38:25] of our lives, Lord. For with that being
[38:27] the desire,
[38:29] Lord, show us the way, Lord.
[38:32] Teach us, oh God, in every aspect of our
[38:36] lives, Lord. Lord, our the greatest the
[38:40] greatest achievement in our lives, Lord,
[38:42] is to be pleasing to you. Lord, to
[38:45] believe, Lord, every word to be the
[38:48] truth, Lord.
[38:50] Oh, God. That's that's the greatest
[38:52] evidence your prophet taught us is
[38:54] genuine faith in the revealed word of
[38:57] this hour. Oh God, may your presence
[39:00] Lord as you're here Lord, may you sweep
[39:03] over, Lord, every heart, every life. You
[39:06] know every one of our needs, Lord,
[39:08] tonight, Lord.
[39:11] Even that, Lord, which lays before me,
[39:13] Lord, I just give myself to you that may
[39:17] you deliver, Lord, I pray God the word.
[39:20] And may Lord our hearts we want to be
[39:24] vessels Lord to receive
[39:27] from you tonight. Lord may you give us
[39:30] grace Lord that the human part can step
[39:33] aside both in speaker and hearer that
[39:37] Lord that you might just flow through
[39:40] us. Lord may the spirit of God may the
[39:43] word just flow through our lives and our
[39:45] hearts. Have your way tonight Lord. May
[39:47] we Lord as we our desire is to leave out
[39:50] of here better people than what we
[39:53] walked in Lord closer to you a greater
[39:56] hunger a greater desire a a greater
[39:58] determination and Lord a a where load
[40:02] has been lifted oh God and our hearts
[40:06] Lord just been encouraged Lord I pray
[40:09] may you come Lord you know every need
[40:11] that's among us Lord have your way
[40:15] Father I pray In the name of Jesus
[40:18] Christ. Amen.
[40:21] Amen. God bless you. Let's go right into
[40:25] the scriptures here tonight. I want to
[40:27] go right back to Hebrews 12. Yep.
[40:32] And uh
[40:34] I want to
[40:37] the Lord will help us to try to finish
[40:38] this portion here as we've looked at it.
[40:43] And uh
[40:48] every portion of scripture is so dear to
[40:50] our hearts. And at each time when I can
[40:53] read even in Hebrews 12, I just see how
[40:56] God taking a hold of our lives and our
[41:00] lives beginning to come along in his in
[41:03] the journey. And then even after our
[41:05] lives have been born of his spirit, then
[41:08] God continues to work with us and mature
[41:12] us and leading us on into a place of of
[41:15] adoption and just continuing to work
[41:17] with us. And I'm so thankful for that.
[41:19] Amen. So, we could spend a lot of time
[41:22] on that part and perhaps in some
[41:24] services we've studied on that quite a
[41:26] bit. But I want to just read this here
[41:28] tonight as it pertains because in some
[41:31] pre in another quotes, brother Brandham
[41:33] will actually refer back to this
[41:34] particular statement when he deals with
[41:36] certain things on the gifts. So in
[41:39] Hebrews 12 and verse 5, and ye have
[41:43] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[41:46] unto you as unto children. I'm glad God
[41:50] calls this to mind. My son, despise not
[41:54] thou the chastening of the Lord, nor
[41:57] faint when thou art rebuked of him. For
[42:01] whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth, and
[42:05] scourgeth
[42:07] every son whom he receiveth.
[42:10] And this is the key. If ye endure
[42:14] chastening,
[42:15] God deleth with you as with sons. So God
[42:20] doesn't treat us any different. And even
[42:22] as he speaks his word, his word goes
[42:25] forth and it just it speaks to sons. And
[42:30] so what happens is is sons will rise
[42:33] with that word. So God never picks out
[42:36] remember even as it he speaks to the to
[42:39] every every church age he will always
[42:41] make himself known. And as he makes
[42:44] himself known, well, that of that are
[42:47] the sons of God that are the elect in
[42:49] that age will rise under that light
[42:52] because that's the only thing that can
[42:53] bring forth a son and daughter of God is
[42:56] the word of God.
[42:59] So notice, if ye endure chastening, God
[43:03] dealeth with you as with sons. For what
[43:06] son is he whom the father chastineth
[43:08] not? But if you be without chastisement,
[43:13] now what this deals with is refusing
[43:17] his correction,
[43:19] whereof all are partakers,
[43:22] then are ye bastards and not sons.
[43:28] Verse nine, furthermore,
[43:31] we have had fathers of our flesh which
[43:34] corrected us, and we gave them
[43:37] reverence.
[43:38] Shall we not much rather be in
[43:40] subjection unto the father of spirits
[43:43] and live? For they verilely for a few
[43:47] days chastened us after their own
[43:50] pleasure. But he for our profit that we
[43:54] might be partakers of his holiness. Now
[43:57] I realize that when we read a scripture
[43:59] like this with on correction that not
[44:02] everyone had
[44:04] the example of how a father should be
[44:08] and how a father should actually correct
[44:11] their children.
[44:14] And so once again how that how that God
[44:17] will set the clarity here that they did
[44:21] it after their own pleasure there. There
[44:23] were things that they wanted to see come
[44:25] out in our lives. But the thing that
[44:27] separates God from even that of a
[44:30] natural father is everything that he is
[44:33] doing. He does not God doesn't get
[44:36] frustrated with us. God doesn't he he
[44:40] doesn't throw up his hands. He's never
[44:42] corrected one of us out of frustration.
[44:47] He's never lost his cool with us.
[44:50] As a matter of fact, when God's presence
[44:52] pulls away from our life, that's a big
[44:55] sign to us.
[44:56] That's right.
[44:57] That's a real big sign to us as as
[44:59] children of God. It's something that
[45:01] Lord, I I want to be I I want to be in
[45:04] your presence. But so everything he's
[45:06] done has been for profit that we might
[45:08] be partakers of his holiness. I want to
[45:11] We want to be more of a partaker to
[45:15] receive more of him, don't we?
[45:18] Now notice verse 11. Now no chastening
[45:23] for the present seemth to be joyous but
[45:26] grievious. Has anyone ever said yes
[45:30] correction?
[45:32] I mean I never did as a kid.
[45:36] I always always hated it because I knew
[45:38] it was what I hated more than the
[45:40] correction is I hated taking naps after
[45:43] I got to spanking. I wanted to be
[45:46] outside.
[45:48] But I also know this right here is that
[45:50] when I look back on it and through that
[45:53] correction that I received, I'm sure we
[45:55] can fellowship on this some is that
[45:59] I needed it. And at the time it was not
[46:02] joyous. I wasn't running around. Oh,
[46:04] Dad, thank you for that correction. Oh,
[46:06] I'm so glad. This is so wonderful. My
[46:10] opening up the windows and the neighbors
[46:12] here. know as a matter of fact we're
[46:14] sometimes sitting in a room and you
[46:16] think man they don't love me he doesn't
[46:18] eat oh how could they but you know we
[46:21] come to that after a while to realize
[46:24] that that's sometimes our first reaction
[46:26] to it but we begin to understand that
[46:29] love and then see it now in our lives
[46:33] is that right
[46:34] you know we don't see it right away we
[46:36] don't see the effects of the correction
[46:38] right away but we see it in our lives
[46:41] Now, so now no chastening for the
[46:44] present seemth to be joyous, but
[46:46] grievious. Nevertheless, afterward,
[46:49] afterward, it yieldth the peaceable
[46:52] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[46:55] are exercised
[46:58] thereby. So by receiving that correction
[47:00] into our life, then our lives become
[47:04] corrected or we are exercised and
[47:07] through that there's a yielding of
[47:09] fruit. Now, does fruit come up
[47:11] overnight?
[47:12] It doesn't. It's patience. It's
[47:15] watering. There's But in order for there
[47:17] to be fruit, there's first got to be
[47:18] seed that's sown. And seed, then there's
[47:21] that seed. The ground is broken up. Then
[47:23] the seed can be sown. Once the ground is
[47:25] broken up, then water comes upon that
[47:27] seed, then fruit comes. So those as
[47:30] we're exercising by sometimes the actual
[47:32] fruit of receiving the correction that
[47:36] has come to us does not show up until
[47:40] much much later. I want you to think of
[47:43] this right now. Think of where we're
[47:44] sitting right here in a message church.
[47:47] The message being able to be freely
[47:49] preached. God called out a word in this
[47:51] hour. God brought correction
[47:54] to to the church of the living God in
[47:57] this hour.
[47:58] Now at first a lot of things as things
[48:01] first started coming about it didn't
[48:03] really resemble but remember the more as
[48:06] we would lay in his presence and
[48:08] actually become exercised by that
[48:11] correction and we're still receiving
[48:13] correction. God is still dealing with
[48:15] our lives. That's why the prophet said,
[48:16] "Lord, may you reveal yourself. May we
[48:18] see the plainness of God in this hour
[48:21] that we would know how to behave
[48:23] ourselves and correct ourselves in the
[48:26] hour that we're living in. So you're
[48:29] seeing now fruits from receiving
[48:32] correction years ago and there's
[48:36] benefits even in our lives where there's
[48:37] things we've been corrected now. So
[48:40] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[48:43] down and the feeble knees and make
[48:47] straight paths for your feet. Now this
[48:49] is instruction on how to go about it.
[48:52] Lest that which is lame be turned out of
[48:55] the way but let it rather be healed.
[49:00] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[49:02] reading of the word as you're being
[49:03] seated. I want to I want to continue to
[49:07] speak here on this thought on receiving
[49:09] the benefit
[49:11] of of that of correction.
[49:14] And uh I want to come back into this
[49:16] quote here just for a moment to kind of
[49:18] set a little bit of the direction once
[49:20] again tonight
[49:22] where brother Bram says he takes from
[49:24] this passage of scripture in Hebrews 12
[49:27] and he said herein is now set forth the
[49:30] love of God. He desired in love a family
[49:33] of his own, a family of sons, sons like
[49:38] himself.
[49:39] There before him lies all mankind as one
[49:43] lump of clay. Out of that same lump, he
[49:46] will now make vessels unto honor and
[49:50] unto dishonor.
[49:52] So God never makes anybody believe him.
[49:55] Neither does he make anyone disbelieve
[49:57] him.
[49:58] God doesn't make anybody obey him.
[50:00] Neither does he make anyone disobey him.
[50:03] God simply reveals himself. And as he is
[50:08] revealing himself, God is making himself
[50:11] known. And that is what begins to have
[50:13] an impact upon our life as we get into
[50:16] his presence. He says then the choosing
[50:19] will be his own choosing. Then those
[50:22] chosen ones born of his spirit will be
[50:26] trained to conform to his image in their
[50:28] own walk. Now let me just say this the
[50:30] choosing is not something that is taking
[50:32] place even now. And sometimes choosing
[50:36] itself fruit itself you this is why that
[50:40] you can't just judge quickly on certain
[50:42] things. You have to allow it to come to
[50:45] maturity because there's certain fruits
[50:48] let me give you an example. There's
[50:49] certain fruits that Esau exhibited that
[50:51] you would have pinpointed Esau and said
[50:53] he's right on the money but give it
[50:56] time. And when you gave it time, you
[50:58] realized there was fruit that came out
[51:00] of or or not fruit we would say that
[51:03] would be that of of towards like that of
[51:05] a believer coming out of Esau. But then
[51:07] you would begin to see something out of
[51:09] Jacob that you never saw before. What
[51:12] was it? It just shows us it just there's
[51:14] manifesting and allowing God allows
[51:17] things and gives it time to manifest.
[51:19] So, you know, listen, if God wanted to,
[51:22] friends, and you think about it, God
[51:23] could even through the prophets's
[51:25] ministry. Well, let's just take Paul's
[51:27] ministry for example. Paul would write
[51:29] in other letters and commend men like
[51:31] Deeus. He would commend them and and put
[51:34] them forth. And you would think, "Oh,
[51:36] Paul knew Deeus was like that all
[51:38] along." No, no, he didn't. He only knows
[51:41] according to how God will allow him to
[51:43] know. The Lord Jesus knew about Judas.
[51:46] And here's the great thing. God knows
[51:47] how much to let you and I know because
[51:50] you know even in that sometimes the
[51:52] things that we can see you still have to
[51:54] commit things to God and to realize that
[51:57] even the Lord Jesus knowing who Judas
[51:59] was but yet he never treated Judas any
[52:01] different never acted never gave
[52:03] anything away but see God has a way of
[52:06] reserving things back for us even as he
[52:08] did the prophet when he would speak
[52:10] about you know he would have different
[52:11] helpers and things in the ministry
[52:13] different men and other things around
[52:15] even sometimes once in a while, brother
[52:17] would tell us how the spirit of God
[52:18] would let him know about somebody doing
[52:20] something or this or that. But think
[52:22] about that even within Deeus where Paul
[52:25] would write letters of recommendation
[52:27] and really that's how ministry would go
[52:29] from one church to another church is
[52:31] letters of accommodation and how that
[52:34] Deeus no doubt had entry into pullpits
[52:36] because of letters of accommodation by
[52:39] that of Paul. But then we also realize
[52:42] there came after a period of time Deeus
[52:45] forsook him.
[52:47] Is that right? Deeus eventually departed
[52:50] from the message. Now was it that Paul
[52:54] wasn't true? Now remember, brother Ram
[52:56] tells us, we can see it all the way down
[52:57] through the scriptures. God only lets
[53:00] his prophets know what he wants them to
[53:03] know. That's why Isaac could sit there
[53:05] and grab a hold of Jacob where Jacob had
[53:07] tied up all that hairy mess all over his
[53:09] arms to uh deceive his father. God God
[53:13] could have come through that office of
[53:15] Isaac and said, "I I know it's you,
[53:18] Jacob. I'm hearing your voice and I'm
[53:20] I'm feeling this and I God could have
[53:22] God could have done that, but he didn't.
[53:24] God could have also revealed to Isaac
[53:26] and and Jacob. He could have told Jacob,
[53:28] "Hey, your boy Joseph, this is what your
[53:31] boys have done to him. They did this,
[53:33] this, and this. He was a prophet. He was
[53:35] a channel. He was available. But God
[53:38] only tells his prophets what he wants to
[53:41] tell them.
[53:42] And if God only tells his prophets what
[53:44] he wants to tell them, that's the same
[53:45] thing where you and I. We're not ever
[53:47] going to get something out of God that
[53:49] is out of season, out of time, or that
[53:52] God doesn't want us to know, but rather
[53:54] rather to trust him and just walk with
[53:57] him. And for the the biggest part of our
[53:59] life as believers, it's walking with God
[54:02] and trusting him, looking to him. And
[54:04] you know, things in itself will manifest
[54:07] within its own time. Now, within this
[54:10] part of choosing, let me just say this
[54:12] to you. You'll never find God running
[54:15] down a person or say to you that voice
[54:18] that comes into your mind and says, "I
[54:20] must not be one of the chosen ones."
[54:23] You'll never hear the Holy Spirit saying
[54:25] that. I and I'm just telling you that so
[54:28] you know how to discern that voice
[54:30] because you'll never find that God never
[54:32] told Caleb or the or those other 10
[54:34] spies, hey, you guys are not even fit to
[54:36] take the land. God will never do that
[54:39] cuz he's never done that.
[54:41] But always God will come with a word of
[54:44] encouragement and word he will come to
[54:47] correct us. But you know what? He treats
[54:50] each one when he speaks his word as
[54:53] though all are sons and daughters.
[54:57] That's good.
[54:57] God doesn't say, "Well, let me just
[54:59] speak to the sons now. Let me speak to
[55:00] the servants." But God brings his word
[55:03] in every generation. And he speaks it to
[55:06] sons and daughters. And what will take
[55:08] place is sons and daughters will rise
[55:10] under that word. They will receive the
[55:13] chastening, the correction. They will
[55:15] actually respond to that word. Now
[55:17] sometimes it may not be exactly at the
[55:20] moment in time and my can be such a
[55:22] struggle with their flesh and so forth
[55:24] but it what what will actually prevail
[55:27] is that part of God that God has placed
[55:30] within that individual that will
[55:32] actually prevail and bring them into the
[55:35] place of the new birth. And then through
[55:36] that of the new birth, they have
[55:38] received a prevailing strength now
[55:41] operating in that part of the word in
[55:44] their life that will lead them on and
[55:47] give them the strength to continue in
[55:50] their journey to bring every part of
[55:52] their life in subjection to the word of
[55:55] God.
[55:57] So you remember from from that of the
[55:59] Holy Spirit coming into a life all the
[56:02] way through, it's victory after victory
[56:04] after victory after victory. It isn't
[56:07] just boom, one one snapshot. No, it's
[56:09] victory after victory. It is God's own
[56:12] life prevailing through a surrendered
[56:15] child of God. It is redemption proving
[56:19] its claims through your life by you
[56:22] receiving the strength to be able to
[56:24] bring your life in subjection to the
[56:26] word of God because you're not made to
[56:28] do it but you surrendered your life.
[56:31] That's how the new birth comes is
[56:33] through a full surrender. And then after
[56:36] as full surrender comes it never stops.
[56:39] Through that full surrender then what is
[56:41] it? It's Christ that has come in and it
[56:43] continues to work through our life. And
[56:45] what is act what is actually being
[56:46] displayed the choosing of God.
[56:50] That even overrides our thoughts
[56:52] sometimes our feelings. It because now
[56:55] listen when the Holy Spirit has come
[56:57] there's two there's two realms of us
[57:00] that are not converted. There's two
[57:02] parts of us that are not redeemed. But
[57:05] when that has come on the inside that
[57:08] that innermost part that's where
[57:10] redemption comes because what is
[57:13] redemption? It's to bring back what
[57:15] rightfully belongs to one. And that's
[57:18] what God comes to claim. He didn't come
[57:20] to claim our body. He didn't come come
[57:22] to claim our spirit. But when he came,
[57:24] he came to claim that part of himself.
[57:27] And then through that part, us yielding
[57:30] and Christ becoming preeminent. One of
[57:32] these days, we will lay claim on what
[57:35] rightfully belongs to us. There will be
[57:37] a change of the body.
[57:39] Hallelujah.
[57:40] Is that right? there that theophony that
[57:42] we have been tied back into by the Holy
[57:44] Spirit. The breach has been span span
[57:47] and here we are tied back in to that
[57:49] representation and it will lead us into
[57:52] that place of a body change.
[57:55] Glory be to God. Now, in looking at this
[57:59] here, I love how the prophet says, "Then
[58:01] those chosen ones born of his spirit
[58:04] will be trained to conform to his image
[58:09] in their walk." He reproves with all
[58:13] longsuffering,
[58:17] gentleness, and mercy. God's not
[58:20] interested in destroying.
[58:23] But you know there is there is
[58:25] correction but correction is not
[58:27] destruction.
[58:28] The Bible tells us that if we would
[58:30] judge ourselves we should not be judged.
[58:32] But if we are judged we haven't heeded
[58:35] to certain things then God comes around
[58:37] because he says I will not allow you to
[58:41] be condemned with the world. Then God
[58:44] brings correction to our lives.
[58:47] He does it with all longsuffering. Think
[58:49] about it. How many times God will deal
[58:51] with us on something in our life, deal
[58:53] with us on something, he'll minister.
[58:55] Maybe here you are, you're reading in
[58:57] your devotion. Here you are, you're
[58:58] hearing it. And then God will bring in
[58:59] another minister. Maybe you'll stream
[59:01] somebody else or you do and you're like,
[59:03] "My, this this just keeps coming." And
[59:04] you go to another meeting and this keeps
[59:06] coming. And what it is, we can continue
[59:08] to put things off or we can finally say,
[59:11] "Lord, I I I hear what you're saying."
[59:14] Because remember, God has given us the
[59:17] ability. I trust we want to have the
[59:19] discernment to have be able to look at
[59:22] our own lives and say, "Lord, I want to
[59:24] see where I'm measuring up with the word
[59:25] of God." That's why I've come to the
[59:27] house of God. I want to see where I'm
[59:29] measuring up. I want to see where my
[59:31] shortcomings are, and I want to see
[59:33] where I need to be. And I want to
[59:35] receive the grace that God has provided
[59:38] because God didn't call us together just
[59:40] to come down and tell us how wrong we
[59:42] are. That's not it at all. As a matter
[59:44] of fact, the way that God really shows
[59:47] how things are wrong is not necessarily
[59:50] by saying this is wrong and that's
[59:51] wrong, but he shows up and he manifests
[59:55] his character. And as he begins to
[59:57] manifest himself and sometimes, yes, he
[1:00:00] will have to speak so boldly to do what
[1:00:03] cracks sometimes the hardness that can
[1:00:05] get around our life. We can become
[1:00:08] backslid. We can, you know what
[1:00:09] backsliding is? Backsliding isn't that
[1:00:11] all of a sudden you stop reading your
[1:00:12] Bible sometimes and praying. Sometimes
[1:00:15] backsliding, remember what a backslider
[1:00:17] is, he's right in all his own ways.
[1:00:20] Where we become set in our own ways.
[1:00:22] We're right, everybody else is wrong.
[1:00:24] That's a backsliding condition. So God
[1:00:27] knows how to come down and bring a
[1:00:29] correction into our lives. I'm so
[1:00:31] thankful for that
[1:00:34] that he'll do that with longsuffering.
[1:00:36] He doesn't, you know, God will let it
[1:00:38] here sometimes on and on and finally a
[1:00:40] correction will come in our life and God
[1:00:42] gives us grace. He'll do it with
[1:00:44] gentleness, not to overthrow us. He does
[1:00:47] not want to extinguish from us or take
[1:00:50] from us that we are his children. This
[1:00:52] is what I'm talking about is the love of
[1:00:55] God. This is not a love that's based on
[1:00:58] how how much you can measure up and how
[1:01:00] much you don't. His love is
[1:01:02] unconditional. When God's choosing has
[1:01:04] set forth upon your life and the spirit
[1:01:07] of God makes it real to your life, the
[1:01:09] love of God, listen, God cannot love you
[1:01:11] any more now than he loved you before
[1:01:13] the foundation of the world. But it's us
[1:01:15] coming and actually beginning to see his
[1:01:19] love by the provision he made and the
[1:01:22] spirit of God being sent to our life to
[1:01:24] deal with our life, bringing us unto him
[1:01:27] through everything in our life. And then
[1:01:29] the spirit of God moving and working in
[1:01:32] our life through all of our ups and
[1:01:34] downs, through all of our shortcomings,
[1:01:36] through all of our mistakes, and yet
[1:01:38] through it all with gentleness and
[1:01:41] mercy, he reproves us.
[1:01:44] You know why? Cuz he knows we are but
[1:01:46] flesh.
[1:01:48] He has got confidence that true. He
[1:01:50] knows that part of himself that lays on
[1:01:52] the inside. But God is not interested in
[1:01:56] breaking your spirit or exasperating you
[1:01:59] because he can never tell Paul to write
[1:02:01] to fathers of how that they're to
[1:02:03] discipline their children. Bring
[1:02:04] correction but don't ever take spirit
[1:02:07] out of them. Point them in the right
[1:02:09] direction. Curb out where things are
[1:02:11] going wrong. Notice he chasens with nail
[1:02:15] scarred hands. So this is not one who
[1:02:17] does not have experience. He has
[1:02:19] experience. He knows what it was like to
[1:02:22] turn down butter and honey. Is that what
[1:02:24] Isaiah said? He knows what it was like
[1:02:26] to be able Listen, as a matter of fact,
[1:02:28] he understands the pressures. He
[1:02:31] understands temptation. As a matter of
[1:02:33] fact, brother Ram said in deity of Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ that the said Jesus was tempted
[1:02:37] with sexual temptation. He was tempted
[1:02:40] with women, tempted with drinking. He
[1:02:42] was tempted in all points such as we are
[1:02:47] and yet without sin. Wow. He is our
[1:02:50] provision. And so with doing that he
[1:02:53] chasens with nail scarred hands. He has
[1:02:55] an understanding because he became one
[1:02:59] of us.
[1:03:00] But does that understanding allow us to
[1:03:02] get by with it? Oh, I know the pool. I
[1:03:05] know because listen, the temptation he
[1:03:08] went through was not an act.
[1:03:11] All right.
[1:03:11] Are you hearing me?
[1:03:12] Hallelujah.
[1:03:13] You said I thought he was God. He was,
[1:03:15] but the flesh wasn't God.
[1:03:17] Because James says God cannot be
[1:03:19] tempted.
[1:03:20] Hallelujah. But yet the Bible said Jesus
[1:03:22] was tempted. It's such a mystery by
[1:03:24] great is the mystery of godliness. How
[1:03:26] God was able to so condens the right arm
[1:03:30] of God. How God through all of those
[1:03:32] little examples of personification of
[1:03:34] how that God would so allow himself to
[1:03:38] become one of us that he might be able
[1:03:40] to experience the things that we go
[1:03:43] through and all of this in order to be
[1:03:46] able to chasen us with nailart hands.
[1:03:50] When he brings correction, he brings it
[1:03:53] with understanding.
[1:03:54] Hallelujah.
[1:03:55] Aren't you glad for that?
[1:03:58] Oh, hallelujah. Sometimes this potter
[1:04:02] must take the vessel he's working on and
[1:04:05] thoroughly break it down in order that
[1:04:08] he may rebuild it exactly as he desires
[1:04:12] it.
[1:04:13] So, let me just say this to you.
[1:04:14] Sometimes, no doubt, there's things
[1:04:16] within our life that the Holy Spirit,
[1:04:18] there's times where there's areas where
[1:04:20] God will have to completely retrain in
[1:04:23] our life.
[1:04:24] There's thing complexes that have in our
[1:04:26] life that you know, you're not even
[1:04:27] aware of them that are there.
[1:04:29] Situations, things sometimes like I read
[1:04:31] that maybe didn't have a father or had a
[1:04:33] father that was abusive or had things
[1:04:35] and man, it just causes things to be
[1:04:37] drawn up. all kinds of experience that
[1:04:39] can come through life of even maybe how
[1:04:41] we relate to authority, how we relate to
[1:04:43] one another, how a husband and wife
[1:04:45] relate to one another. And God has to
[1:04:47] work through all of that to bring a
[1:04:50] retraining in our life. But listen,
[1:04:52] that's where the Holy Spirit is a tutor,
[1:04:56] is a teacher, and he comes to instruct
[1:04:59] you and I. God does not look at you and
[1:05:02] I and say, "Man, you're a mess. You know
[1:05:04] how much time I have to spend with you?
[1:05:06] you know how much I'll have to work on
[1:05:07] your character. God does not do that.
[1:05:10] And neither does God look at and say,
[1:05:12] "All I need is one night at the altar
[1:05:14] and one night at an altar and boy,
[1:05:16] you're fixed forever." No. When the Holy
[1:05:19] Spirit has come, you now have received
[1:05:22] the teacher on the inside. You now have
[1:05:25] become teachable. You now have come into
[1:05:28] a place where the spirit of God can
[1:05:30] begin to deal with our life. And he
[1:05:33] doesn't do it all at once.
[1:05:36] That's right.
[1:05:36] Think about it. If he would do
[1:05:38] everything at once about our life, it
[1:05:41] would so overwhelm us that we would be
[1:05:43] ready to throw in the towel and say,
[1:05:45] "What's the use?"
[1:05:48] That's so good.
[1:05:50] No doubt you felt that way many times
[1:05:52] when you come to see your shortcomings.
[1:05:54] When you come to think, Lord, why would
[1:05:57] why what would you ever what did you
[1:05:58] ever see in me? Lord, what was it about
[1:06:00] me? when you begin to see your
[1:06:02] shortcomings. But you know what? You
[1:06:04] can't give up because it wasn't you that
[1:06:06] started this.
[1:06:08] You can't let go because it's not you
[1:06:10] that's holding on.
[1:06:11] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:06:12] If it's you that's holding on, you'd
[1:06:13] have been you'd have been washed away a
[1:06:15] long time ago.
[1:06:16] But it's God that's got a hold of your
[1:06:18] life.
[1:06:19] And you know what? God will sit there
[1:06:20] and deal with our life. He'll hold on
[1:06:22] our life until eventually cuz remember,
[1:06:25] God is not in the business of making
[1:06:28] sons do anything. He doesn't want to
[1:06:31] make anyone serve him. He wants us to
[1:06:34] receive the correction in our life and
[1:06:37] then we reflect
[1:06:39] that correction.
[1:06:40] That is so good.
[1:06:41] But we do it not out of fear.
[1:06:43] No,
[1:06:44] we do it from our hearts.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah.
[1:06:47] You see, it only takes a little bit of
[1:06:49] time. If it's done simply out of a
[1:06:51] slavish fear, all of a sudden it take
[1:06:53] all it does is take just one little bit,
[1:06:55] one little thing, and all of a sudden
[1:06:57] everything is thrown away. And because a
[1:07:00] slavish fear is intellectual faith,
[1:07:04] right? It just just thrown right away.
[1:07:06] But if there's something down on the
[1:07:07] inside, you can't throw anything away
[1:07:09] because you didn't start it.
[1:07:12] But sometimes this potter and I I would
[1:07:14] say it in this way. I know this is quite
[1:07:16] a bit in here within this this this and
[1:07:18] there's a lot more to preach in there.
[1:07:20] But you know sometimes this is why
[1:07:21] sometimes when you look and you you can
[1:07:23] see somebody go astray for a period of
[1:07:25] time. Doesn't mean that they're not it
[1:07:28] doesn't mean that they're not even one
[1:07:29] of the chosen ones.
[1:07:31] You say what will tell that time
[1:07:35] man? It'll tell in time because every
[1:07:38] seat there will not be one child of God
[1:07:40] miss the rapture.
[1:07:43] There'll not be one. They will come
[1:07:44] right in line. It won't be a It won't be
[1:07:47] the rapture will be bring them in line.
[1:07:49] They will come back in line.
[1:07:53] But sometimes God has to has to allow
[1:07:56] God permits things to come to a
[1:07:58] situation in order to break it down to a
[1:08:02] place because the foundation has got to
[1:08:06] be right.
[1:08:07] That's right.
[1:08:07] Remember brother Brandham told about
[1:08:09] that man who had that dream. You know,
[1:08:10] Brother Brandham was talking to the
[1:08:11] young lady and they went to the house
[1:08:13] after that night and brother Brandham
[1:08:15] and the and the dad, they slept down
[1:08:16] there in downstairs and the man said, "I
[1:08:18] had a dream, Brother Brandham. And I had
[1:08:20] a dream. I built this house." And the
[1:08:21] inspector came and he came along. And
[1:08:23] when he came, he said, "Tear it down and
[1:08:26] burn it to the ground." And all Brother
[1:08:28] Brandham said, he said, "The water's
[1:08:29] right down here, brother. Did you want
[1:08:30] to go right now?"
[1:08:31] Hallelujah.
[1:08:32] At 2:00 a.m. in the morning, something
[1:08:34] like that. You know what it was, brother
[1:08:35] Ram? said, "It wasn't according to the
[1:08:36] blueprint." Right?
[1:08:38] So you see God, he is merciful, but he's
[1:08:42] but he's merciful in that he would deal
[1:08:44] with us as sons
[1:08:48] and he's looking for response of sons
[1:08:52] and daughters. So there's training that
[1:08:55] takes place in our life and and training
[1:08:57] you know is where you know it's not just
[1:08:59] something you just you know really I
[1:09:02] mean just one day some of you no doubt
[1:09:04] have been in jobs and you know they
[1:09:05] promise you training and you don't get
[1:09:06] training
[1:09:08] I think we can all all of us have been
[1:09:10] there sometimes we've got they all the
[1:09:12] procedures they have wrote down that we
[1:09:14] train everybody but really training is
[1:09:17] where it's not just really one day it's
[1:09:20] where you stay with somebody Right.
[1:09:23] Right. You You're there, you know, with
[1:09:25] them. You know, you know how it is like
[1:09:26] you walk in Cracker Barrel and no stars
[1:09:28] on the bib.
[1:09:29] That's right.
[1:09:31] Lord help us. You hope that somebody
[1:09:33] with there's somebody with them that got
[1:09:35] stars on the bib cuz they've been there
[1:09:37] a while.
[1:09:38] Right.
[1:09:39] I don't know. I think it's been weeks
[1:09:40] and weeks since I've been at Cracker
[1:09:41] Brown. It was months before that. But
[1:09:43] you know, you kind of know those things.
[1:09:45] I don't know what other restaurants
[1:09:46] have. You know, maybe we need to find
[1:09:47] that out.
[1:09:48] You you want somebody to stay with you
[1:09:50] so you know the ropes on things. Why?
[1:09:52] You're interested in doing what's right.
[1:09:54] And God is that he's that faithful to
[1:09:57] train you and I. When training, listen,
[1:10:00] training is not just with correcting,
[1:10:02] but training comes to actually instruct
[1:10:05] us with the desire to see that our lives
[1:10:09] would profit.
[1:10:10] And training there's got to be, you
[1:10:12] know, for a a particular skill or even a
[1:10:15] behavior sometimes. And you know, God
[1:10:18] even worked with that all the way
[1:10:19] through the New Testament. I I don't
[1:10:21] have time to deal with that tonight on
[1:10:22] even how that that that the children of
[1:10:25] God were to take things patiently, to
[1:10:28] endure patiently. You know, it's as as
[1:10:31] he wrote in Peter, you know, it's easy
[1:10:32] when you've done wrong and people, you
[1:10:34] know, correct you for your wrong and but
[1:10:36] when you do right and and you're
[1:10:38] corrected or something is said, then and
[1:10:40] he's dealing with take it patiently. So
[1:10:42] he's instructing the children of God,
[1:10:45] training them. You're going to come into
[1:10:46] these places. But you see, training can
[1:10:49] only be given when the subjects are
[1:10:53] ready for it. And you know, this is the
[1:10:55] thing that you know, God in this hour,
[1:10:58] he's seen that in the midst of this age,
[1:11:00] there would be a people that would be
[1:11:03] ready to receive the training of the
[1:11:05] word. And God delivered the word through
[1:11:09] his prophet to this generation. And then
[1:11:12] through that, God would take men
[1:11:15] faithfully taught, spiritfilled, coming
[1:11:17] out from under that light. And then God
[1:11:20] would begin to bring this word. I mean,
[1:11:22] we we've watched the message even over
[1:11:25] the years where the message under the
[1:11:27] thrust of God sent a prophet. That was
[1:11:29] necessary. That was God moving within
[1:11:32] that time. But then the spirit of God
[1:11:34] would begin to move and and taking the
[1:11:36] church a little deeper in the word that
[1:11:39] has already been revealed and begin to
[1:11:42] make known the the mystery, begin to
[1:11:44] make known who we are. And then the
[1:11:46] spirit of God working in our lives to
[1:11:48] instruct us as we're coming into this
[1:11:51] place of adoption and into a placing of
[1:11:54] sons and daughters of God. God
[1:11:56] continuing to work and move within our
[1:11:59] life. God operates within seasons. This
[1:12:02] is why that you know brother Brandham
[1:12:03] will take uh there in in Revelations
[1:12:06] chapter 1 the time is at hand and
[1:12:08] brother Brandham said see previously the
[1:12:10] time was not at hand. So God has
[1:12:13] reserved a time and a season like he
[1:12:16] said in Ecclesiastes for everything God
[1:12:18] knows the training that you have need
[1:12:20] of. Remember if he gave it all at once
[1:12:23] it would overwhelm us
[1:12:25] but he knows just how to work with our
[1:12:28] lives little by little. And so the
[1:12:31] training as we look at, think of how
[1:12:33] that Paul would write. Let me just run
[1:12:35] through a few scriptures. Paul would
[1:12:36] write even to that of the Corinthian
[1:12:38] church. Now they were wrong. That's
[1:12:40] true. But even in their wrong, notice
[1:12:43] how Paul would write to them and say,
[1:12:45] "Brethren, I would not have you
[1:12:47] ignorant." Because you could say
[1:12:50] something's wrong. That's one thing. But
[1:12:52] show me what's right.
[1:12:54] That's good.
[1:12:54] What's right?
[1:12:55] That's good.
[1:12:56] I mean, you can tell me I'm wrong, but
[1:12:57] tell me what's right. How do I get
[1:12:59] right?
[1:13:00] And so Paul would be able to speak these
[1:13:03] things. Now listen, we don't have it, as
[1:13:05] I've said before, in Ephesians, in
[1:13:07] Thessalonica, and all the rest of them.
[1:13:09] We do not have this teaching as it's
[1:13:11] laid out right here. Yet, we know that
[1:13:14] those saints did not just receive that
[1:13:17] at the altar one night. They were taught
[1:13:19] those things. But this is a revisit to
[1:13:23] certain things that are taking place in
[1:13:25] the Corinthian church. Now remember what
[1:13:27] Paul what brother tells us in 63 church
[1:13:30] order. He said what it was is the
[1:13:32] Corinthians made this an issue.
[1:13:38] They made it an issue. Now don't think
[1:13:40] that they were out with picket signs and
[1:13:42] walking around. We shall have spiritual
[1:13:44] gifts and we shall have spiritual gifts.
[1:13:46] No. What it was when you begin to look
[1:13:48] back down through things. Listen
[1:13:49] friends, there's many times what it is
[1:13:52] is our thinking about things is what
[1:13:55] hinders.
[1:13:57] And so God is even though that Paul
[1:13:59] would labor with them on the correct
[1:14:01] order, but he's trying to bring them
[1:14:04] from childish thinking into thinking
[1:14:07] like men. You see, he already listen,
[1:14:10] you can go back to first Corinthians
[1:14:12] chapter 1. I read this to you a few
[1:14:13] months ago. In 1 Corinthians chapter 1,
[1:14:16] look how Paul opens up. You know,
[1:14:18] quickly we'll always say, well,
[1:14:19] Ephesians 1, he told the church they the
[1:14:22] position that they had in Christ. Read
[1:14:24] first Corinthians chapter 1. And Paul
[1:14:27] alerts them to the position that they
[1:14:29] have in Christ. He tells them, you have
[1:14:32] come behind in no gift. The testimony of
[1:14:35] Jesus Christ has been confirmed in you.
[1:14:38] He's letting them know positionally who
[1:14:42] they are.
[1:14:43] Then he begins to bring the correction.
[1:14:45] That's exactly how brother Brandon will
[1:14:47] bring it to us. And he's showing us that
[1:14:49] out of 1 Corinthians chapter 1. Now
[1:14:51] notice where Paul would speak of this
[1:14:53] and we've looked at this before. Paul
[1:14:55] would bring it around and and he would
[1:14:57] speak to them concerning regarding the
[1:14:59] body of Jesus Christ. Now think about
[1:15:01] this. Paul would would would be so
[1:15:03] anointed by the spirit of God. And
[1:15:05] listen, you know, if it wasn't for the
[1:15:07] spirit of God, Paul would have never
[1:15:09] been able to pick up this analogy of the
[1:15:12] body of Christ. It's just no more than
[1:15:15] Paul would be able to pick up the
[1:15:16] analogy of a runner or of a soldier with
[1:15:19] a whole armor of God. But you see Paul
[1:15:22] being in certain experiences even when
[1:15:24] it came remember to the Olympic games
[1:15:26] and you know I fight I I fight not as
[1:15:28] one that beatth the air. He had
[1:15:29] experiences and the spirit of God would
[1:15:32] so anoint those experiences to be able
[1:15:34] to relay it to the people. Now look
[1:15:36] notice how God will work. You see then
[1:15:39] God is interested in that you and I
[1:15:41] would understand. So God would bring
[1:15:44] things down into ways that you and I
[1:15:47] would be able to understand it. And so
[1:15:49] Paul by the spirit of God would be able
[1:15:52] to relay this of the working within the
[1:15:54] body, the different gifts, all the nine
[1:15:56] spiritual, the five ministerial gifts.
[1:15:59] He would relay it in the body and not
[1:16:01] just those gifts but how that every one
[1:16:03] of us are a part or a member of the body
[1:16:08] of Jesus Christ. And then through that
[1:16:10] he would talk about the different
[1:16:12] diversities, the differences in
[1:16:14] administration. It's just like in your
[1:16:16] life, you have a hand that you write
[1:16:18] with. If I gave you a document to sign,
[1:16:20] you won't say, "Well, let me figure out
[1:16:21] which one I want to write with." There
[1:16:23] might be one or two of you in here, but
[1:16:24] you have a dominant hand and yet they're
[1:16:27] both hands. Differences in
[1:16:29] administration. You have an eye that's a
[1:16:31] dominant eye. Difference in
[1:16:33] administration. You see, God even has
[1:16:35] that among gifts, pastors, evangelists,
[1:16:38] and and so forth. Even among that there
[1:16:40] are differences in administration even
[1:16:43] to how the re the how much God will
[1:16:46] actually use a person or an individual
[1:16:50] or a gift. Who does that depend on? It
[1:16:52] depends on how God wants to use them.
[1:16:54] Right? There's a portion of stewardship
[1:16:57] that's committed to our lives. If
[1:16:59] something we get hotty with something,
[1:17:01] God will pull right back. If we become
[1:17:03] braggish with it, God will pull right
[1:17:05] back. If our life is not lined up with
[1:17:07] where it should be, God will pull right
[1:17:09] back. You might say, "Well, the spirit
[1:17:10] of God is still coming down on that
[1:17:12] person." That's because of the office
[1:17:15] that they hold. It's not because they
[1:17:18] are in the right frame where they should
[1:17:20] be.
[1:17:21] This is where the Holy Spirit is sets
[1:17:24] forth through ma Matthew 24. There are
[1:17:27] false Christ anointed ones. What brings
[1:17:31] that out? What manifests that? Time.
[1:17:34] Right.
[1:17:35] Time.
[1:17:36] So good.
[1:17:37] I know sometimes we're always so
[1:17:38] comfortable. Oh, I always knew this and
[1:17:41] I always knew this. I wonder if Paul had
[1:17:43] that attitude about Deus.
[1:17:46] You see what that is? That's
[1:17:49] instability. That's that's a complex.
[1:17:51] Yeah. Right.
[1:17:52] Paul didn't have that.
[1:17:53] That's right.
[1:17:55] That's good.
[1:17:56] Aren't you glad those examples lay out
[1:17:57] there?
[1:17:58] I'm so thankful to the Lord for that. So
[1:18:00] Paul would be able to say that. Now,
[1:18:02] Paul would write about the systems even
[1:18:04] in the body that you would see, your
[1:18:07] hands, your eyes. But what about all the
[1:18:10] 11 body systems that you don't see, but
[1:18:14] they're operating in silence?
[1:18:17] And I ask you, which ones are greater?
[1:18:20] The hands you see moving or my heart?
[1:18:24] My head that you see moving or my
[1:18:27] respiratory system?
[1:18:29] What's greater? Yet you don't hear it.
[1:18:32] That's right.
[1:18:32] You don't see it. My nervous system that
[1:18:35] everything, lymphatic system, all those
[1:18:37] things that are working and yet they're
[1:18:39] working in an unseen to your eye,
[1:18:42] but you know they're working.
[1:18:43] Oh yes.
[1:18:44] They're not making a lot of noise, but
[1:18:47] yet they're vital. Yet what Paul never
[1:18:49] said about the heart, he never require
[1:18:51] reads about the respiratory system. That
[1:18:54] is in between the lines to understand
[1:18:57] the heart isn't out there saying, "Hey,
[1:18:59] say something about me. Hey, say
[1:19:01] something about me. The lungs saying,
[1:19:03] "Say something about me." You see, the
[1:19:05] greatest parts of our life. You can cut
[1:19:08] my hand off, I'll live. You can take my
[1:19:10] leg off, I'll live. You can take a
[1:19:13] finger off, I'll live. But if you take
[1:19:15] out my heart,
[1:19:17] I'll die.
[1:19:19] You see, it's the most important things.
[1:19:21] That's why Brother Brandham says, "Still
[1:19:23] waters run deep."
[1:19:29] Notice he would even give the admonition
[1:19:32] follow after charity.
[1:19:36] Desire spiritual gifts. Desire them, but
[1:19:39] follow charity. Make sure that the gift
[1:19:41] you're chasing after or the gift is
[1:19:43] pursued, make sure you got to go through
[1:19:44] love to get to it. I think that's a good
[1:19:47] thing for all of our lives. No matter
[1:19:49] you see, you can apply that to every
[1:19:51] part of your life. No matter what it is
[1:19:52] that we're going after, make sure that
[1:19:55] you have to go through the love of God
[1:19:57] to get it.
[1:19:59] Lord,
[1:20:01] that's so good.
[1:20:02] But rather that you might prophesy.
[1:20:06] Once again, brethren, be not children in
[1:20:09] understanding.
[1:20:11] I'd say this stung a little bit.
[1:20:13] Yeah.
[1:20:14] Oh, yeah.
[1:20:17] How be it in malice be ye children, but
[1:20:20] in understanding be men. Now notice it's
[1:20:22] not it's not put downs.
[1:20:24] He's encouraging them. And he has
[1:20:26] through these scriptures. I skipped a
[1:20:28] whole bunch. We've been through them for
[1:20:29] months.
[1:20:31] He has instructed them on what to do on
[1:20:36] how with God's not the author confusion.
[1:20:38] All those things he's instructed on on
[1:20:40] the hows, on the wins, and how things
[1:20:43] are to be done and when it's to be done.
[1:20:44] He gave such such instruction to the
[1:20:48] Corinthian church. And the one thing
[1:20:50] about it is is that we know they
[1:20:52] received it. Now, I don't know if every
[1:20:53] one of them received it or not. I don't
[1:20:56] know. There might have been five that
[1:20:58] said, "Uh-uh, I'm doing as I feel led.
[1:21:04] We don't know if everyone received it."
[1:21:06] That's right.
[1:21:07] But what we do know is sons of God
[1:21:10] received it.
[1:21:12] Because you know why? the sons of God
[1:21:14] could recognize the word coming through
[1:21:17] Paul in that hour. That's why Paul said,
[1:21:20] "What came the word of God from from you
[1:21:22] to me?" But Paul said, "Let him that is
[1:21:25] spiritual or a prophet, let him
[1:21:27] acknowledge that the things that I write
[1:21:29] unto you are the commandments of the
[1:21:32] Lord." Brother Bram says, "Look at this
[1:21:34] Corinthian church." He told them what
[1:21:36] they was positionally in Christ, but he
[1:21:39] warned them of what was going to happen.
[1:21:41] and they corrected themselves and got
[1:21:45] straightened out with God.
[1:21:49] Now, I don't know how long there might
[1:21:51] have been, you know, they might have
[1:21:52] done some pouting or they might have
[1:21:53] done, you know, some festering. I I
[1:21:55] don't know. I I don't know. But what I
[1:21:57] do know is this is the thing. When you
[1:21:59] read second Corinthians, you find no
[1:22:02] nothing being mentioned about this.
[1:22:05] Again,
[1:22:06] you know why? They had received the
[1:22:09] correction
[1:22:10] and had the authority in their lives to
[1:22:13] correct themselves.
[1:22:16] They no doubt would feel the spirit of
[1:22:17] God coming on the same way because that
[1:22:20] wasn't going to change. But they knew
[1:22:23] how to yield. See, the word had brought
[1:22:25] through the instruction had brought
[1:22:27] discernment. Think about how the prophet
[1:22:29] standing there and laboring with the
[1:22:31] people of God. Not just in Brandham
[1:22:33] Tabernacle, but all the way through. I
[1:22:35] showed you that for months. Los Angeles,
[1:22:37] California, up in Oregon, down here,
[1:22:39] down because it's the prophet to the
[1:22:41] age. This was not just a message to
[1:22:43] Brandon Tabernacle. This message was to
[1:22:46] the church of the living God, to sons
[1:22:49] and daughters that would come into full
[1:22:51] adoption.
[1:22:53] That's who it's to. So then within this,
[1:22:56] this is where that the prophet would
[1:22:58] deal with this of how that through the
[1:23:00] receiving of this word, it actually
[1:23:03] would be able as the Corinthians at
[1:23:05] times maybe those who had had the gift
[1:23:07] to speak in tongues and here they were.
[1:23:09] The spirit of God would so anoint them
[1:23:11] and come upon them, but all of a sudden
[1:23:13] they would recognize, nope, nope, nope,
[1:23:16] nope. Uh Paul has just stepped up here
[1:23:18] to the platform right now.
[1:23:20] I'll hold it.
[1:23:21] That's right. And then as time would go
[1:23:23] on because brother Brandham takes these
[1:23:25] same scriptures and he says what Paul
[1:23:27] was actually teaching us in 1
[1:23:30] Corinthians 14. It was bringing the
[1:23:33] bringing the gifted people into a place
[1:23:36] to where it wouldn't be done within the
[1:23:38] public.
[1:23:40] He said that's what Paul was saying.
[1:23:42] I'll take a prophet's word.
[1:23:44] That's why the prophet said in questions
[1:23:46] and answers God being misunderstood. He
[1:23:48] said, "Someday, if you will allow me, I
[1:23:50] would like to come down right among you
[1:23:52] and with all of you that's gifted, be
[1:23:54] able to give you my understanding of the
[1:23:57] scriptures on these things if you will
[1:24:01] receive it."
[1:24:03] That's it.
[1:24:04] And but you see, how can we be able to
[1:24:07] correct ourselves just like this,
[1:24:08] friends? Don't don't just leave this
[1:24:10] even within these messages. I think
[1:24:11] that's what's been so beautiful as is
[1:24:13] with all the word of God. It applies to
[1:24:15] so many areas within our lives. When God
[1:24:17] deals with our life, there's something
[1:24:18] that God can speak to our heart, speak
[1:24:20] to our life right now here tonight and
[1:24:23] you receive you receive from the Lord
[1:24:25] and it might look so impossible. Maybe
[1:24:28] God is is calling you into a higher
[1:24:30] walk. He's calling you to let go of
[1:24:32] something, to lay down a weight, to lay
[1:24:34] aside a besetting sin. And if you can
[1:24:36] just look to him who's inspiring you,
[1:24:39] you can look to the one where you can
[1:24:41] say, "I can do all things through Christ
[1:24:45] who strengthens me." You see, at one
[1:24:47] time we had what the prophet calls in
[1:24:49] the Holy Ghost series, I can't. I can't.
[1:24:51] I can't. He said, but once you get the
[1:24:54] caner, you can.
[1:24:56] Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] You see what happens? The spirit of God,
[1:24:59] it brings us into that place. It equips
[1:25:02] us with the strength to submit oursel as
[1:25:06] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:08] It's training. Think about how brother
[1:25:10] Random would would train over the period
[1:25:12] of time with the people. Think about all
[1:25:14] the details even how the fluctuation he
[1:25:16] would say notice how this was spoke
[1:25:18] right here. Oh, he said how beautifully
[1:25:20] how that come around. Did you see I was
[1:25:22] just reading one again last night in 10
[1:25:24] virgins and brother said you see how
[1:25:26] this one spoke right here and how this
[1:25:27] fluctuation it came with the same length
[1:25:30] right there in time and oh you hear
[1:25:32] brother Neville right here. He just
[1:25:33] going on in admiration of and pointing
[1:25:36] those things out to the people. But you
[1:25:38] see it with such training to even as the
[1:25:40] things that we looked at some weeks ago
[1:25:43] to where the prophet would be able to
[1:25:45] bring discernment to those who would
[1:25:47] receive it between the gift and the Holy
[1:25:50] Spirit
[1:25:51] because he said that gift always wants
[1:25:53] to do it.
[1:25:55] Amen.
[1:25:57] Oh glory. So what does that require?
[1:25:59] Discernment. And you see discernment
[1:26:01] comes by the word and submitting to the
[1:26:03] word. So you see a a person even just
[1:26:05] with just the gift can say I feel led
[1:26:08] but who's leading?
[1:26:11] Oh I I know it was God because the
[1:26:13] results well the prophet talks to us
[1:26:15] even how he got results in the miracle
[1:26:17] lines and the angel of the Lord rebuked
[1:26:20] him.
[1:26:23] He says a matter of fact he said he had
[1:26:24] talked to him for 6 months.
[1:26:28] Incredible. So does does results is
[1:26:31] results always the ultimate approval?
[1:26:34] Because then we have to give false
[1:26:36] teachers that we have all signs and
[1:26:38] wonders following them. We would have to
[1:26:40] give them that's the approval. But the
[1:26:42] approval is by the word of God.
[1:26:46] There you go.
[1:26:48] So it's got to be teachable.
[1:26:52] That'll be teachable.
[1:26:54] You know, I worked with a lot of
[1:26:55] students and things like that. Worked
[1:26:57] with trying to get, you know, sometimes
[1:26:58] you work around and work with them. But
[1:27:00] you know what? You you can't make
[1:27:02] anybody teachable. God don't even make
[1:27:05] somebody teachable. He he he mids the
[1:27:08] warming rays of his of his spirit, of
[1:27:10] his word, to bring us into a place to
[1:27:13] where that we will submit and yield
[1:27:16] ourselves to him. This is why the Bible
[1:27:18] said, "Correct thy son, and he shall
[1:27:20] give thee rest. He shall give delight
[1:27:23] unto thy soul where now notice not right
[1:27:26] away
[1:27:28] but in the coming times
[1:27:31] because correction as it's coming forth
[1:27:33] right there. Oh man, it it hurts the
[1:27:35] parent.
[1:27:37] But in times to come.
[1:27:39] That's why brother Brown would talk
[1:27:41] about it. I gave you those examples. You
[1:27:42] take somebody, he said, "Here they are."
[1:27:44] He said, "They're a brat right here." He
[1:27:46] said, "What will they be when they grow
[1:27:47] up?"
[1:27:49] You see, time doesn't cure things.
[1:27:53] That's why correction even within things
[1:27:56] and the wisdom and and God, how do I
[1:27:58] respond to this and and taking care of
[1:28:00] this? Time doesn't always correct
[1:28:02] things.
[1:28:04] Where there is no vision, the people
[1:28:07] perish. This is the same word that is
[1:28:09] used in Exodus. When the people struck
[1:28:12] took off their clothes, they became
[1:28:14] loose.
[1:28:16] Let go. no leadership whatsoever.
[1:28:21] Oh friends, in this hour, God has
[1:28:24] provided us
[1:28:25] with real leadership.
[1:28:28] He's given us a clear vision of the word
[1:28:31] of God.
[1:28:33] You say amen to that.
[1:28:36] Now, notice here you see things. This is
[1:28:38] why that the scripture says, "But he
[1:28:41] that keepeth the law, happy is he, a
[1:28:43] servant, will not be corrected by words.
[1:28:47] For though he understand, he will not
[1:28:50] answer.
[1:28:52] And this is why that even a person you
[1:28:54] have to want to understand. So brother
[1:28:57] Brown said there's some people that they
[1:28:59] don't want to understand. There's some
[1:29:01] people he said that sometimes some do.
[1:29:04] But he said there's others that they
[1:29:06] don't want to understand. I'm not
[1:29:08] interested in it. I don't want to hear
[1:29:10] no more about it.
[1:29:12] But you see, God's interested in helping
[1:29:15] us to understand. Amen.
[1:29:18] Oh my.
[1:29:20] Now, notice within this,
[1:29:23] the Ram goes into this part and he's
[1:29:25] dealing with with the with the people of
[1:29:27] God. It was right there in 1963 in
[1:29:30] church order. And he tells them, he
[1:29:31] says, "A few years ago, you were
[1:29:33] children with these gifts playing back
[1:29:35] and forth. But you've been to school
[1:29:37] long now. It's time to be men. Not use
[1:29:42] these just to play with. These gifts,
[1:29:44] they're sacred. They're of God and you
[1:29:46] don't play with them. Let's let God use
[1:29:49] them. Notice, let's let God use them. In
[1:29:51] other words, let's take them out of your
[1:29:54] hands.
[1:29:56] And let's put them into God's hands.
[1:29:59] How do we put them into God's hands? Put
[1:30:00] them into the hands of the word.
[1:30:02] Right. That's right.
[1:30:03] But notice, not before, now. And the
[1:30:07] prophet, as I showed you quotes, all the
[1:30:08] way down through the years of the
[1:30:10] message, he would come back around. Oh
[1:30:12] my. He was thankful. were beginning to
[1:30:14] see gifts accumulating. Oh, and then he
[1:30:15] would tell the people, "Get ready.
[1:30:16] There's going to be people moving in
[1:30:18] here. Very gifted people coming in
[1:30:19] here." He would keep on telling 1961,
[1:30:21] "Question answers. God be
[1:30:22] misunderstood." Questions and answers 61
[1:30:25] keeps on continues to bring this up over
[1:30:27] and over. Oh, I I just can't wait till
[1:30:29] we can get to a place to where I can put
[1:30:31] the church back in order as I had it
[1:30:34] when I first started.
[1:30:37] Now, it wasn't that brother Brandham,
[1:30:40] you can never say that brother Brandham
[1:30:42] was against the gifts. He wasn't.
[1:30:45] But his desire was to get them into a
[1:30:48] place like he said, "Wait on your own
[1:30:51] ministry."
[1:30:52] He said, "If a minister comes here and
[1:30:55] waits before God on his ministry," he
[1:30:58] said, "You the rest of you should be
[1:31:00] that interested
[1:31:01] in your own ministry, too."
[1:31:03] That's so good. But remember what an
[1:31:05] example we had. Did Brother Bam all of a
[1:31:07] sudden corral everything right back into
[1:31:09] the back room? No, not at all. Did he
[1:31:11] all show up in 1963 when he just comes
[1:31:14] back into town? Hardly set foot back
[1:31:16] into town. Brother George was telling me
[1:31:18] about this. He hardly set foot back into
[1:31:20] town and they rushed him down here. But
[1:31:23] you know what? This this was a time and
[1:31:26] a moment that then the prophet had told
[1:31:28] them after the church had been built.
[1:31:30] Here's an order. Here's things I want to
[1:31:32] share with you. He didn't go around and
[1:31:34] tell them, "You're wrong. You're doing
[1:31:35] this wrong. You're doing that wrong." He
[1:31:37] labored with them for years.
[1:31:42] But then he says, "It's time to let your
[1:31:45] ministry be what it wants to be."
[1:31:48] And that's the way to put Brandom
[1:31:49] Tabernacle in service. Now, so for that
[1:31:51] to happen, Brother Brandham had to give
[1:31:53] instruction also to the veterans along
[1:31:57] the way. 1961, Brother Brandham speaks
[1:32:00] here, and I think this is what this is.
[1:32:02] This is very important because
[1:32:04] sometimes, you know, there's things we
[1:32:06] can forget of where God has brought us
[1:32:09] from. And I'm not just talking about the
[1:32:10] gifts now. I'm talking about with
[1:32:12] parents. Let me just stop here.
[1:32:15] Sometimes you can forget of what it was
[1:32:17] like to have children in church.
[1:32:20] And let me just tell you, everybody's
[1:32:22] children are not like your children.
[1:32:24] That's right.
[1:32:25] That's good.
[1:32:26] Are you hearing me? I mean, look at look
[1:32:28] at how even the examples that brother
[1:32:30] Brandham, even what he talks about in in
[1:32:32] church order in 1963 when he deals with
[1:32:34] children and and how children ought to
[1:32:36] behave in church and and looking all
[1:32:37] that, he understands all those things.
[1:32:40] He's seeing all of that. That's not an
[1:32:41] excuse, but it's this is where sometimes
[1:32:44] some of the things we're looking at and
[1:32:46] what we don't deem spiritual, but God
[1:32:48] might be testing our patience
[1:32:51] to see how where are you at in the
[1:32:54] stature with patience.
[1:32:56] Oh Lord man, I can I can tolerate my
[1:32:59] boss, but can you tolerate that family
[1:33:01] with children?
[1:33:03] Not so good.
[1:33:04] Come on now,
[1:33:05] preach with me, somebody.
[1:33:07] Yes, sir.
[1:33:07] That's instructions to veterans.
[1:33:11] Sometimes we forget
[1:33:14] and we're not all the same. Well, I'll
[1:33:15] tell you this is how I this is how
[1:33:17] that's not patience.
[1:33:20] But when maybe they might need a little
[1:33:21] encouragement,
[1:33:24] but sometimes as veterans,
[1:33:26] we can forget.
[1:33:30] We can forget. Oh, we got quiet. Maybe
[1:33:32] we just need to stop right there.
[1:33:35] Get this out of fifth gear and put this
[1:33:36] down.
[1:33:38] I'm not saying everything is right, but
[1:33:40] I'm saying God will test our patience in
[1:33:43] many different ways.
[1:33:45] True.
[1:33:46] How can Listen, let me just say this to
[1:33:48] you. You know when it's easy to be
[1:33:49] longsuffering? When you don't have
[1:33:51] nothing to be longsuffering about.
[1:33:52] Hallelujah.
[1:33:54] The easiest time I felt to be patient
[1:33:57] and when I don't have to be patient
[1:33:58] about nothing.
[1:34:00] That's true.
[1:34:00] The easiest time when I don't have to
[1:34:03] keep records because I don't have no
[1:34:04] records to keep on anybody.
[1:34:06] You know, I'm quoting from that chapter
[1:34:08] on love. That's easy then. But every one
[1:34:12] of those attributes of love are
[1:34:14] expressed.
[1:34:16] It will be adversity,
[1:34:19] situations that require us to die to
[1:34:22] oursel.
[1:34:23] Yes, sir.
[1:34:23] In order for those to be brought out.
[1:34:25] Yes, sir.
[1:34:26] Now,
[1:34:26] I'm sure not not any one of us are
[1:34:27] signing up for that. We're not, oh,
[1:34:28] Lord, I I want to be more long I do want
[1:34:30] to be more long-suffering, but I also
[1:34:32] would understanding with more
[1:34:33] longsuffering, that's just not something
[1:34:35] that's birthed in a prayer closet.
[1:34:37] That's right.
[1:34:38] Patience is not just birthed in a prayer
[1:34:41] closet. Oh, I'm going to get before God
[1:34:42] today and I'm going to receive more
[1:34:44] patience. You don't receive it that way.
[1:34:46] You receive it through the midst of the
[1:34:48] testing and the trying and the situation
[1:34:51] that will lead you to death to yourself.
[1:34:54] That's so good.
[1:34:57] 100%.
[1:34:58] Do it.
[1:34:59] Yes, sir.
[1:35:00] Lord, I really need more patience, but I
[1:35:03] don't know where to ask for him. Lord,
[1:35:04] be be merciful. That's it right there.
[1:35:06] Be merciful, Lord. Take it easy. Take it
[1:35:08] slow with me, Lord. Give me as I can
[1:35:10] handle, Lord. Train me, Lord. Help me,
[1:35:12] Lord.
[1:35:14] Just be honest with him, Lord. I I I
[1:35:16] help me, Lord. Hold my hand, Lord. I I
[1:35:18] want to be more patient. I'll tell you
[1:35:19] what kind of patient I want to be. I
[1:35:21] want to be the same kind of patience
[1:35:23] that you've been with me, Lord, toward
[1:35:25] my brother, toward my sister, toward my
[1:35:27] wife. Lord, hold my hand. Train me.
[1:35:29] Teach me.
[1:35:31] Amen.
[1:35:32] Help me, Lord.
[1:35:32] Yes, sir. Yes.
[1:35:34] Now, brother Abraham tells the the
[1:35:36] veterans back in ' 61. He said, "Now
[1:35:38] these that are speaking in tongues, many
[1:35:40] of them interpret and so forth are babes
[1:35:42] in the gospel. Don't offend them. Let
[1:35:44] them grow till that gift. Some of it you
[1:35:48] can see how Satan tries to weave into
[1:35:50] some of course veterans, we see that we
[1:35:53] can catch that and you'll watch it."
[1:35:56] Brother Ram, he goes on to talk about
[1:35:57] how that, you know, things will come
[1:36:00] around and then someone asks him the
[1:36:02] question right after this uh and and the
[1:36:05] spirit, brother Ram, is tongues and
[1:36:06] prophecy to be used during the service
[1:36:08] and 1961 same message. Brother Ram said,
[1:36:10] "No, but he says no, it should be used
[1:36:15] on this way and then told in the
[1:36:17] service, but for this time, for this
[1:36:21] present time, let him speak." Now,
[1:36:24] what's he talking about? No, it should
[1:36:26] be used that in a separate ministry.
[1:36:29] Here all of everything is in part,
[1:36:32] tongues, interpretation, discerner of
[1:36:34] spirits, getting everybody to church
[1:36:36] early.
[1:36:38] Brother Bram also talked about having
[1:36:40] saints meetings,
[1:36:43] just the gifted ones. Patmas vision.
[1:36:48] Why? Why would brother Brandon, what
[1:36:49] would he refer to over and over in the
[1:36:52] message? He said, "Because the scripture
[1:36:54] says if they come in among you and hear
[1:36:56] this, they'll say you're unlearned."
[1:36:59] And brother, listen, you brother
[1:37:01] Brandham says it over and over. Brother
[1:37:02] Brandham, I I want you to catch this.
[1:37:05] Brother Brandham was so mindful that he
[1:37:07] did not want somebody to blaspheme the
[1:37:09] Holy Ghost.
[1:37:10] Yeah, there you go.
[1:37:12] And he's tying that into the scripture.
[1:37:14] And that's why he kept on saying that
[1:37:15] Holy Ghost series and on and on through
[1:37:17] there. And then right after this, but
[1:37:20] but then you know you could say and all
[1:37:22] these things and brother B's talking
[1:37:24] about trying to you know a little kid
[1:37:25] trying to walk. Anybody ever seen a
[1:37:26] little kid try to walk?
[1:37:29] You know some of us got kids closer into
[1:37:32] that time and age and remember all that.
[1:37:34] Man, it's it's something else. I mean
[1:37:35] they're they're laboring to walk. And
[1:37:37] brother Brandon's referring to that
[1:37:39] right after that first paragraph I read
[1:37:41] there. He's talking about how they're
[1:37:42] just learning to walk. They'll fall down
[1:37:43] four or five times. But he says, "But
[1:37:45] brother Brandham, why didn't you correct
[1:37:47] this?" He said, "No, no." He said, "When
[1:37:50] Billy Paul back there first started to
[1:37:51] walk, he was up and down, down more than
[1:37:53] he was up, but he didn't know how to
[1:37:55] walk, but I believe he had a gift of
[1:37:56] walking. I let him walk a little while
[1:37:59] and then he got to stumbling his big
[1:38:00] feet. I tell him about it." You see what
[1:38:03] I mean? Like walking around, boy, watch
[1:38:04] your feet. Straighten. You know, you're
[1:38:06] not Hey, boy. You know, you catch them.
[1:38:08] You're walk. Hey, straighten your feet
[1:38:09] out. Right. You You got them on the
[1:38:11] bicycle. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1:38:13] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You pull
[1:38:14] them back. Why? You're train them.
[1:38:16] You're right there with them,
[1:38:17] right? That's what brother Graham's
[1:38:19] talking about. We're right there with
[1:38:20] them. The veteran sometimes you're going
[1:38:22] to see things and you can see how Satan
[1:38:23] can weave in there and see all that. He
[1:38:25] said, you see what I mean? Go along
[1:38:27] looking at something else and popping
[1:38:28] and something else. Pick up your feet,
[1:38:30] boy. Where you at? That's the
[1:38:32] difference. And then, Brother Bram says,
[1:38:34] now let them stumble and let them block
[1:38:37] along a little while. when you have to
[1:38:41] correct them. If they resent it, then
[1:38:44] you know yourself it wasn't God.
[1:38:47] That's good.
[1:38:48] Now, what is it that determines it
[1:38:50] wasn't of God?
[1:38:55] What is it that Brother Ram told us here
[1:38:57] and the multitude of other quotes that
[1:39:00] shows whether something's of God or not?
[1:39:03] The attitude.
[1:39:06] The attitude. If it's resentment, the
[1:39:09] Ram said, arrogancy,
[1:39:11] refusal,
[1:39:13] then you know it's not of God. So it
[1:39:14] doesn't matter if it could have been
[1:39:15] right on the dot, but it shows us it's
[1:39:18] not of God by the response. You say,
[1:39:21] "What do you mean it shows it's not of
[1:39:23] God?" It shows what's down there.
[1:39:28] Now, so it's must be the right attitude.
[1:39:31] I I I know that's a little strong. just
[1:39:33] just swallow it down because to resent
[1:39:36] something is to feel bitterness or ind
[1:39:39] indignation
[1:39:41] at a circumstance, action or person.
[1:39:43] Now, just be honest. Every one of us
[1:39:45] when you've been corrected, I've been
[1:39:47] corrected. Whenever we've been
[1:39:49] corrected, it stings a little bit.
[1:39:52] Can you say amen to that?
[1:39:54] But it's what we do with that.
[1:39:57] It's what we do with that. From that
[1:39:59] moment that we've corrected, we've got a
[1:40:01] choice whether to receive it or
[1:40:05] resentment can build in.
[1:40:10] So, we want the right attitude. Now, let
[1:40:13] me just pull from this in Hebrews 12
[1:40:16] real quick. I'm getting somewhere. In
[1:40:17] Hebrews 12, the right attitude. I know
[1:40:21] it's hard to have that right attitude.
[1:40:22] It was me when my dad was boy putting
[1:40:24] the putting the leather across my
[1:40:26] bottom. It was hard for me to have oh
[1:40:27] my, you know, I wasn't rejoicing. I was
[1:40:30] crying. I was hollering. A lot of times
[1:40:31] I'd get my hands back there and I got my
[1:40:33] hands back there. I got more swats.
[1:40:36] Had one of my boys one time that I they
[1:40:38] knew they they were coming down to get a
[1:40:40] spanking and they got quite a number of
[1:40:41] them. And so they had become they knew
[1:40:43] they knew how to maybe kind of help
[1:40:45] themselves. They walked down and they
[1:40:46] they were ready for me to give them the
[1:40:48] spanking because I had talked to them.
[1:40:49] This is what you've done and this is why
[1:40:51] I've got to correct you and this is why
[1:40:52] these things right here. So, I'll meet
[1:40:54] you down in in in my room there in the
[1:40:57] basement. And so, when they came down,
[1:40:59] for some reason, they had grown a little
[1:41:01] bit of weight. And I don't know, they
[1:41:04] had so much more padding than they had
[1:41:06] before.
[1:41:08] Now, every one of you as parents know
[1:41:10] there's been times that you have had to
[1:41:13] bite your lip cuz you they know just how
[1:41:15] to do things to try to get your anger or
[1:41:18] or get the thing disciplined. They're
[1:41:20] trying to get out of the moment. You
[1:41:21] know, that's where the oh, I promise
[1:41:22] I'll never do it again. I I'll never do
[1:41:24] it again. I'll never do it again. I'll
[1:41:25] promise I'll never do it again. Then you
[1:41:26] got those times like that.
[1:41:29] I don't know. May maybe it was the mind
[1:41:31] of an engineer. I don't know. You know
[1:41:32] that just solving problems, you know,
[1:41:34] maybe could have worked for FEMA or
[1:41:36] something like that. No, you would
[1:41:37] wouldn't want to work there. But anyhow,
[1:41:39] they came down there. But but you know,
[1:41:40] this the right attitude. So because we
[1:41:42] don't always see it. It's just like even
[1:41:44] when there was things of correction, let
[1:41:46] me even move it beyond the belt and
[1:41:47] things like that. There were things that
[1:41:49] even for even within our boys of things
[1:41:51] different ones is they you know each one
[1:41:53] of them is different. That's why I don't
[1:41:55] let me just say this about phones.
[1:41:56] That's why I don't say oh they've got to
[1:41:58] be this age before you give them a
[1:42:00] phone. There is a lot of stuff that can
[1:42:02] be gotten into. But you know you have to
[1:42:05] as a parent know each one of your
[1:42:07] children. That's why that even as God
[1:42:10] God in God gives to us what he sees were
[1:42:13] able to handle at that time. This is why
[1:42:16] sometimes you have a man, he wants a
[1:42:18] ministry where he goes out and he
[1:42:20] preaches at all these other churches.
[1:42:22] He's the one being invited. He wants to
[1:42:24] do this and he wants and sometimes you
[1:42:25] can just see those things kind of coming
[1:42:27] out. But you know what? If that's what
[1:42:29] God has for that man to do, then God
[1:42:31] will place his character into a place
[1:42:34] that God can entrust him with that.
[1:42:38] That's good.
[1:42:39] But if God has entrusted him with it and
[1:42:41] his character gets inflated, God knows
[1:42:43] how to deflate it. You know why? Cuz God
[1:42:46] won't share his glory with nobody.
[1:42:48] Or it could be singers or anybody else.
[1:42:50] Just let it apply all across the board.
[1:42:53] It's just like you can you you know you
[1:42:55] could do this right now as as a parent.
[1:42:56] Man, I'll tell you what, our children
[1:42:58] and this and that and this and that and
[1:43:00] you can have all this and it becomes an
[1:43:02] inflated source. And God knows how to
[1:43:05] deflate you.
[1:43:07] Sure does.
[1:43:08] Because sometimes you can become so
[1:43:10] inflated that you get to looking down on
[1:43:12] everybody else.
[1:43:13] That's right. But God knows how to God
[1:43:15] knows how to serve humble pie.
[1:43:18] He knows how to serve it up. He knows
[1:43:19] how to keep us in a place not not to rub
[1:43:22] our nose in the dirt, but to bring us
[1:43:24] back down to the place that we need to
[1:43:27] be. So, we're always in position to see
[1:43:30] him. He is my everything. And I am what
[1:43:34] I am be by the grace of God. And it's by
[1:43:37] God's grace.
[1:43:39] Father, mother, whatever and on and on.
[1:43:41] Hallelujah.
[1:43:42] It's God's grace. So the right attitude.
[1:43:44] Notice how Paul would speak of this here
[1:43:47] in the book of Hebrews in the first the
[1:43:49] first writing. Despise not. Despise it
[1:43:52] not.
[1:43:54] Don't become just oh my this correction.
[1:43:57] See even when God begins to take a hold
[1:43:59] of a life and God will begin to correct
[1:44:01] a life. You as a person comes and God is
[1:44:04] bringing his word over their life and
[1:44:05] there's some chastening that goes on.
[1:44:07] God begins to deal with them maybe about
[1:44:08] their associates and and maybe it's
[1:44:10] their wardrobe and other things. God
[1:44:12] will work with every individual's life.
[1:44:14] Maybe somebody has everything right just
[1:44:15] on the outside, but they are filled with
[1:44:17] so much pride on the inside, but God
[1:44:19] works with their life. And it's how that
[1:44:22] they how that they do as far as
[1:44:24] receiving that correction.
[1:44:26] That's good.
[1:44:27] Whether they despise it or not,
[1:44:30] but you know, the despising of it and
[1:44:32] and not nor fainting. I don't know about
[1:44:34] you friends, but I I've never
[1:44:39] any times where God has brought to my
[1:44:41] attention that I failed.
[1:44:44] Some area where he's corrected me on.
[1:44:48] It's not just something that I just
[1:44:49] shake off.
[1:44:52] Sometimes it lingers with me for days
[1:44:55] and weeks.
[1:44:57] Anybody know what I'm talking about?
[1:44:59] Yeah,
[1:44:59] even at times when you had a boss or
[1:45:01] somebody else and maybe they've come and
[1:45:03] they've they they've had to bring some
[1:45:05] correction to you and yet what you felt
[1:45:07] you were doing was the asset to the
[1:45:10] whole company
[1:45:12] and the boss comes to you and says
[1:45:15] that's not how I want it done.
[1:45:17] Now sometimes I realize we we're dealing
[1:45:19] with humans now but sometimes they're in
[1:45:22] positions to see where things could get
[1:45:25] to
[1:45:26] and how things could come about. That's
[1:45:28] good preaching.
[1:45:29] They're into that that we can't even
[1:45:31] see.
[1:45:31] You know, we all work. I mean, I worked
[1:45:33] with teachers and sometimes, you know,
[1:45:34] the teachers were grumbling about the
[1:45:36] superintendent and grumbling about the
[1:45:38] principles and grumbling about this and
[1:45:40] grumbling about that.
[1:45:42] That's true.
[1:45:44] Yeah.
[1:45:44] Oh, and every one of us were tempted to
[1:45:46] do the same thing.
[1:45:47] That's right.
[1:45:48] You could tell the boss, he could do
[1:45:49] this better. I could do this and I could
[1:45:51] do that. And you know what? God allows
[1:45:53] that to go on. And because you know
[1:45:54] what? That won't just stop with your
[1:45:56] workplace. It'll come right over in your
[1:45:58] home.
[1:45:59] Yes, it will.
[1:45:59] It'll come right over in the church.
[1:46:01] Yes, it will.
[1:46:02] But God knows how to work all those
[1:46:03] things out of our life.
[1:46:05] And and recognizing that, you know what?
[1:46:07] God sees a lot further than you and I
[1:46:10] can see. One day, our faith will become
[1:46:14] sight. But until that time, we have to
[1:46:16] walk by faith.
[1:46:19] Amen.
[1:46:20] Now, yes, sir.
[1:46:22] Brother Bram is here. He brings that
[1:46:23] correction in 63
[1:46:26] and he brings he actually comes down and
[1:46:28] and when you go back and listen to
[1:46:30] church order 63, brother Brown such a
[1:46:35] it's instruction. He never says anything
[1:46:38] to them.
[1:46:40] You're wrong. You've done this wrong. He
[1:46:43] never said that. He never said you're
[1:46:46] out of order. He never said it. You go
[1:46:49] back and listen to that message. I've
[1:46:51] listened to it. I don't know how many
[1:46:52] times. He never said it, but his
[1:46:54] approach to it was a further instruction
[1:46:59] about bringing the gifts that had
[1:47:01] accumulated.
[1:47:02] And remember how brother Bam even talked
[1:47:04] about that of seeing those gifts and oh
[1:47:07] when he says in Daniel's 70 weeks, oh he
[1:47:09] said that brother Neville and that gift
[1:47:11] of prophecy that God has given him. Oh,
[1:47:13] he said, "God has given me some relief
[1:47:16] so when I come in off the field, I can
[1:47:18] rest and God will work through that
[1:47:21] gift."
[1:47:23] Brother Brandham is so thankful for what
[1:47:26] God has provided. He sees it as a
[1:47:28] benefit of the body. It wasn't something
[1:47:30] that that was going to take away. It was
[1:47:31] something going to be a benefit. So,
[1:47:33] Brother Ram works to instruct the people
[1:47:35] and he's speaking to them and he's he's
[1:47:38] asked this question. Brother Ram, can
[1:47:40] Satan use the gift of tongues or
[1:47:42] prophecy in a person who has the Holy
[1:47:44] Ghost and brother Brandham, you know, he
[1:47:46] goes in to explain this and and show
[1:47:48] that yes, an evil spirit can get in
[1:47:51] there. And this is why that it it must
[1:47:54] be judged. It must be tried. And you
[1:47:57] realize as I went through that with the
[1:47:58] message where brother Bram will take us
[1:48:00] into certain times of how that a message
[1:48:02] is given. Someone's name's not called
[1:48:04] out. But brother Ram says that was a
[1:48:05] direct message to someone in here. And
[1:48:08] then you would find two or three people
[1:48:09] coming right to the altar. You'd find
[1:48:10] different ones. Brother Ram countless
[1:48:12] not just in Jeffersonville but brother
[1:48:13] Ram did that. You know remember months
[1:48:15] ago when I laid that in there of how
[1:48:17] there's been direct message. I've
[1:48:18] watched God do that just right here.
[1:48:20] I've watched God do that right here. Now
[1:48:23] notice when I see this, brother Ram,
[1:48:26] brother Brown Ram would say it like
[1:48:27] this. He says that when I begin to bring
[1:48:29] these things to the people, and he's
[1:48:31] talking about why we've seen people go
[1:48:33] on down there to Junior Jackson's, why a
[1:48:36] number of those people went on down
[1:48:37] there to Junior Jackson's. Now, this is
[1:48:38] eight months later, 1964. Brother Ram
[1:48:41] says, 'The reason of it is because when
[1:48:43] I set the church here in a certain order
[1:48:45] and I come back to see if I could get
[1:48:47] the manifestation of the gifts, half of
[1:48:49] them pulled away from it.
[1:48:52] Because when you would start to speak or
[1:48:54] preach or something, it was getting in
[1:48:57] such a place that you could hardly
[1:48:58] preach unless there was somebody spoke
[1:49:00] in tongues, somebody interpreting,
[1:49:02] somebody give the interpretation. Half
[1:49:04] of it never even come to pass.
[1:49:07] He never even said that in 1963 church
[1:49:10] order
[1:49:12] but he was seeing it was ready to bring
[1:49:14] an end to that place.
[1:49:17] But right here in ' 64 he's letting it
[1:49:20] be known these types of things these
[1:49:23] things were also going on. And the
[1:49:25] reason that these people left is after
[1:49:29] that teaching in 1963 in church order.
[1:49:32] You know them weren't the only people
[1:49:34] that ever left.
[1:49:37] Let me just insert this. The one of the
[1:49:39] times that I popped in there to
[1:49:40] Jeffersonville to visit my buddy down
[1:49:42] there and I come in there and and and
[1:49:44] they asked me at the hotel, "Oh, are you
[1:49:46] with such and such a church?" I said,
[1:49:48] "No, I don't even know that church." I
[1:49:50] can't remember the name of it,
[1:49:51] Nathaniel, you might know it, but it was
[1:49:53] at that one sister who was actually a
[1:49:54] Sunday school teacher at Brandon
[1:49:55] Tabernacle, Sister Bernice Hicks. Super
[1:49:58] huge following, a big following down
[1:50:01] there. Big churches. You know what I'm
[1:50:03] talking about. Right down from your
[1:50:04] house. all those things all the way
[1:50:05] through there. She was a Sunday school
[1:50:07] teacher at Brandon Tabernacle
[1:50:11] and she left. Not during this time. And
[1:50:15] here's the thing. Many people followed
[1:50:17] her.
[1:50:20] See, you you see what what it is. It's
[1:50:22] something. It's whether or not you are
[1:50:24] ordained to it or not.
[1:50:26] That's right.
[1:50:27] It's whether or not you're ordained to
[1:50:29] it.
[1:50:30] And I think look what look how brother
[1:50:32] Brandon just watch this. Brother
[1:50:34] Brandham says, "You know how it was
[1:50:35] getting to that place?" He said, "But
[1:50:36] then he said, I I I told the brethren."
[1:50:38] He said, 'You know, they were the
[1:50:39] brethren kept on as they were, you know,
[1:50:41] kind of coming to coming to me and and
[1:50:43] so forth. And brother Bram says, "But I
[1:50:46] let them go ahead a while." And I said,
[1:50:48] "Watch it." I wa let them go. They're
[1:50:51] babes. Remember I read you that quote.
[1:50:53] Let them go for a while. Watch it,
[1:50:54] though. I told the brethren, there's
[1:50:56] witnesses here. Let it alone. After a
[1:50:58] while, we'll find out whether it's of
[1:51:00] God or not. If it cannot stand
[1:51:02] chastisement, then it's a bastard child.
[1:51:06] Now, Brother Brandham had already told
[1:51:08] him before the teaching was brought
[1:51:11] when left ones were coming to him,
[1:51:13] "Brother Brandham, you need to bring
[1:51:14] this teaching. Brother Brand, you need
[1:51:15] to bring this teaching." And and he had
[1:51:16] already been telling the veterans of
[1:51:18] what not to do. But remember the
[1:51:19] veterans, others were seeing certain
[1:51:21] things. And brother Brandham is saying,
[1:51:23] "Let it go on for a while until"
[1:51:27] And brother Brandham says, "When we when
[1:51:28] we bring this, it'll show. If they
[1:51:31] cannot take the chastisement, then it's
[1:51:33] a bastard child." He said, "That's
[1:51:36] exactly when the Bible said when the
[1:51:37] chastisement come, what happened?" Did I
[1:51:40] tell you not long ago, ask the pastor
[1:51:41] here, "What about this? What about
[1:51:43] that?" I said, "Just let it alone.
[1:51:44] They're babies." See, in other words,
[1:51:46] they're all children of God, all sons of
[1:51:50] God. We can't judge it, but watch when
[1:51:54] it really comes to pin down to the word.
[1:52:01] Now look at this.
[1:52:03] Oh, brother Samuel, if I would have been
[1:52:04] there, I could have judged it. I don't
[1:52:06] think so. Brother Brown himself, he
[1:52:08] says, I can't judge it. See, God only
[1:52:11] reveals to his prophets what he wants
[1:52:14] them to know.
[1:52:17] And he let it go on and on. But but I've
[1:52:19] seen certain things were out of order.
[1:52:20] this or that. They're babies. But now
[1:52:23] when the time come and the word was
[1:52:25] brought down,
[1:52:27] their response would show whether it was
[1:52:30] sons or bastards.
[1:52:33] That is so
[1:52:34] whether they received the chastisement
[1:52:36] or rejected it.
[1:52:39] Their attitude would show.
[1:52:42] This is why brother Ram goes on to says,
[1:52:44] I wanted my church, this is part three,
[1:52:46] I wanted my church to try to come
[1:52:48] together. And when we begin to break out
[1:52:49] here, the Holy Spirit speaking in
[1:52:51] tongues and so forth, somebody asked me
[1:52:53] and said, "Now, Brother Brandham, is
[1:52:54] that all genuine?"
[1:52:57] I said, "I'm no judge." I tell you what,
[1:53:00] let's bring it to a spot. Let it go a
[1:53:03] while and bring it to a spot until the
[1:53:05] word is presented on it. Then watch it.
[1:53:09] If it's the Holy Spirit, it copes right
[1:53:12] with the word. If it doesn't, it won't.
[1:53:16] Hallelujah.
[1:53:18] It was not about feeling, not even about
[1:53:21] accuracy. It was about how would it
[1:53:23] respond to the word of God.
[1:53:29] You see, this is why the scripture says
[1:53:31] that if we do not receive chastisement,
[1:53:34] God dealing with the life, God working
[1:53:36] with the life, I don't need to do that.
[1:53:38] I don't need to hear that. I don't need
[1:53:39] to do that. Then that's where brother
[1:53:40] Bam says we become, we become
[1:53:43] illegitimate children. God is looking
[1:53:46] and speaking to all as children, but
[1:53:48] it's our decisions
[1:53:52] on whether we'll receive it or not.
[1:53:54] And that's with any correction, not just
[1:53:56] the gifts, with any correction, how
[1:53:59] we'll receive it.
[1:54:02] It tells these things.
[1:54:05] Notice Brother Ram says that's just
[1:54:07] about the only way you can tell it is
[1:54:09] then it judges itself.
[1:54:13] It'll if it flies up, it ain't the Holy
[1:54:15] Spirit. It'll fly loose. But if it's the
[1:54:18] Holy Spirit, it'll just meekly follow
[1:54:21] right in line because that's what it is.
[1:54:24] It's a dove.
[1:54:26] The Holy Spirit's a dove.
[1:54:30] It won't come down upon a wolf.
[1:54:33] Is that right? But if you've got to be a
[1:54:35] wolf, you can get back to being a lamb.
[1:54:37] Just repent of it and say, "God, I'm
[1:54:39] sorry that I acted like a wolf and
[1:54:42] allowed that wolf to come up."
[1:54:44] Brother Bram said, "Then that dove can
[1:54:46] fly right back down when you become a
[1:54:48] lamb again."
[1:54:49] So good.
[1:54:51] It'll just meekly follow right in line
[1:54:53] because that's what it is. It's the Holy
[1:54:55] Spirit going right to its own order.
[1:54:59] Don't you love him?
[1:55:00] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:55:01] Hallelujah.
[1:55:02] Let's stand.
[1:55:13] Sometimes I wish this clock would stand
[1:55:14] still.
[1:55:16] No doubt you're sitting there saying, "I
[1:55:18] feel the effects of it running."
[1:55:20] But
[1:55:26] you know, Brother Brandon would tell the
[1:55:31] I could we could speak on of how that
[1:55:35] of reverence and respect. Even I would
[1:55:37] instruct the veterans.
[1:55:40] Brother Brandham would say this in the
[1:55:41] message respects. He would say it in
[1:55:43] question answer 61.
[1:55:45] Just like you heard him say when they
[1:55:46] asked brother Brandham. Brother
[1:55:47] Brandham, what is it? The Rem says,
[1:55:49] "Well, I can't judge it."
[1:55:53] I don't know, but we'll see when the
[1:55:56] word comes.
[1:55:58] Remember, because it was the one brother
[1:55:59] who asked Brother Bram the question,
[1:56:00] "Brother Bram, sometimes when people
[1:56:01] speak in tongues in the church and
[1:56:03] interpretations given, Brother Bram,
[1:56:05] sometimes I feel it's such a funny
[1:56:08] feeling that comes over me and I don't
[1:56:10] know is is is that wrong, brother
[1:56:12] Brown?" Brother Bram says, "Well," he
[1:56:13] said to the brother, he said, "It might
[1:56:17] be that it's wrong." He said, "But
[1:56:19] brother, don't ever judge anything on
[1:56:21] your feelings."
[1:56:22] There you go.
[1:56:22] He said, "Because your feelings can be
[1:56:25] wrong."
[1:56:28] And we do have feelings.
[1:56:31] And just because we've got a feeling
[1:56:32] don't make it the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:34] That's right.
[1:56:35] [Laughter]
[1:56:38] Yes, sir.
[1:56:39] See the brother Brandham right here. I
[1:56:41] can't judge it. He says, "I don't know,
[1:56:42] but let's do this. Let's bring it to the
[1:56:44] word. Let's let's see our response to
[1:56:46] the word. Let's see if it measures up
[1:56:48] even to the character of the word." When
[1:56:51] you're given the word, let's watch and
[1:56:52] see the character that comes out. So, in
[1:56:55] this admiration, this is why brother
[1:56:57] Brandham would say in the message
[1:56:58] respects, he would say, "Now look," he
[1:56:59] said, "when the Holy Spirit is falling,"
[1:57:01] he said, "Oh, I've been in meetings and
[1:57:03] I've seen people get out of order." He
[1:57:04] said, "I've seen him get in the flesh."
[1:57:06] He said, "But I'll never say nothing
[1:57:07] about that." He said, "Because I want to
[1:57:09] tell you why. They're God's children,
[1:57:11] too.
[1:57:13] And he said, I what I pray in my heart,
[1:57:15] Lord, they want to come to your house
[1:57:18] just like I do. He said, don't ever say
[1:57:20] nothing against it. He said, because you
[1:57:24] can blasphe the Holy Spirit.
[1:57:26] Brother Brand would say in another place
[1:57:28] in the message, Investments,
[1:57:31] Brother Brand would talk about how that
[1:57:33] even in that time of not saying anything
[1:57:36] against certain things, he said because
[1:57:37] we can blasphe the Holy Spirit. Now,
[1:57:39] this quote that I'm referring to you is
[1:57:41] 1963.
[1:57:43] And this is something
[1:57:45] that he's preaching at another place and
[1:57:48] he's just been interrupted
[1:57:51] by someone speaking in tongues.
[1:57:54] Now, Brother Brham, you have the
[1:57:55] opportunity to call it out and blast it
[1:57:58] as wrong. Say it's of the devil. You got
[1:58:01] the opportunity.
[1:58:03] But one thing you find about brother
[1:58:04] Brandham, and I'm not lifting up brother
[1:58:06] Brandham, it was Christ. That's what we
[1:58:08] see. That's what I see.
[1:58:09] He was a gentleman.
[1:58:11] Christ is a gentleman.
[1:58:13] He wasn't going to tear up a meeting. He
[1:58:15] wasn't going to be able even. He would
[1:58:18] say in this particular quote, "Oh, it
[1:58:20] must have been something important. The
[1:58:22] Holy Spirit interrupted the meeting."
[1:58:24] Oh, he said this. Well, brother Samuel,
[1:58:27] how do we know what's right? God gives
[1:58:29] you pastors.
[1:58:30] Yeah, there you God gives you pastors
[1:58:32] that are able to go into the word and
[1:58:35] rightfully divide it by the spirit of
[1:58:37] God taking that gift.
[1:58:39] That this was not something that was
[1:58:41] being approved of, but it was something
[1:58:43] where the spirit of Christ was in
[1:58:45] respect holding a meeting together so
[1:58:49] that the word could continue to deal
[1:58:51] with someone's life.
[1:58:53] And yet he would admonish the people,
[1:58:55] don't say anything about it because you
[1:58:58] could blasphe the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:02] What an example.
[1:59:05] What an example. No doubt you have. I
[1:59:07] have. You see things and oh, I think
[1:59:08] this could be in the I think this could
[1:59:10] be wrong. I think this could be in the
[1:59:11] flesh. No. There can be things that can
[1:59:13] get get out of hand and there could be
[1:59:15] things that can get out of order. And
[1:59:16] God has God has things to bring that
[1:59:17] right back in order, but
[1:59:20] I definitely don't want to be found
[1:59:22] speaking against something.
[1:59:26] Do you?
[1:59:27] No, sir.
[1:59:28] So there's such an an admiration.
[1:59:32] Brother Brandon says, "A real child of
[1:59:34] God will take his correction."
[1:59:37] Let me read this to you. A real child of
[1:59:40] God, he said, will take his correction
[1:59:43] and he'll say, "Yes, Father, it's your
[1:59:45] word. I've got to straighten up now.
[1:59:48] I've got to do what's right." You know
[1:59:50] that's truth. An illegitimate is the one
[1:59:52] that always backs off and the fly in the
[1:59:55] soup just trying to upset something. But
[1:59:58] the real child of God admires
[2:00:02] to be rebuked and straightened up.
[2:00:05] Now wait a minute. I thought the
[2:00:06] scripture says that no
[2:00:10] chastening
[2:00:12] is joyous at that moment.
[2:00:14] That's right.
[2:00:15] So when does this come out? A child of
[2:00:18] God admires to re rebuked and
[2:00:20] straightened up. You know that can
[2:00:22] happen right within a service.
[2:00:24] Right after the word, the cutting of the
[2:00:26] word has went forth right on our life.
[2:00:27] Brother said that's the time to worship.
[2:00:30] You've recognized where you're wrong and
[2:00:31] there's been correction and you've right
[2:00:33] there right in your seat right while the
[2:00:35] word's coming forth. You've submitted to
[2:00:37] the father of spirits. You've submitted
[2:00:40] to almighty God and said, "Yes, Lord, be
[2:00:42] it unto me." You don't got to go through
[2:00:43] and do 50 pences. You don't have to drag
[2:00:46] across. He's already done it for you.
[2:00:50] All you have to do is accept that
[2:00:52] correction of the word. And right there,
[2:00:54] the spirit of God goes to work. And
[2:00:56] thank you, Lord God.
[2:00:58] Amen.
[2:00:58] You can begin to worship.
[2:01:00] There's a there's an admiring. There's a
[2:01:02] straightening up because in what he's
[2:01:04] doing, he's showing us things that is
[2:01:07] between us and him. That's right.
[2:01:09] Things that can bring us into a greater
[2:01:12] place with him.
[2:01:14] I know I got you standing.
[2:01:17] Brother Brown talks about brother
[2:01:19] Neville.
[2:01:21] Can I just give you this little bit so I
[2:01:22] can finish this?
[2:01:27] Brother Bram talks about how he had to
[2:01:28] come to brother Neville.
[2:01:32] He said I had to take a word to brother
[2:01:33] Neville about prophesying over everybody
[2:01:36] that comes by this altar. Remember
[2:01:37] brother Brand Brother Brandon was
[2:01:39] thankful for this relief. He talks about
[2:01:41] it even in question answers. God being
[2:01:42] misunderstood about the prophecy right
[2:01:44] in the prayer line and those things that
[2:01:46] was taking place.
[2:01:47] He said, "I had to come to brother
[2:01:48] Neville about prophesying everybody that
[2:01:50] comes to this altar here." He said,
[2:01:52] "God, I told him really called him."
[2:01:54] God, I told him, he really called him
[2:01:55] down about it. Don't do it. You'll shove
[2:01:58] him out in the flesh and then you'll
[2:02:00] have a false prophet. Let him do just as
[2:02:04] the spirit leads him to do. Don't try to
[2:02:07] pull anything out of God. Now when
[2:02:09] brother Neville would pray for people,
[2:02:11] people were coming to the altar, but you
[2:02:12] see what was happening. Brother Bram
[2:02:14] brings this up in trying to do God a
[2:02:15] service 1965 even. He said, "What it is,
[2:02:18] remember, you'll shove him out. You'll
[2:02:20] have a false prophet."
[2:02:22] I know some of this, we've had some of
[2:02:23] this going on even around wanting to
[2:02:25] pull words out of people. What do you
[2:02:27] see about me? Can you say something over
[2:02:30] me? Can Can you Can you God's already
[2:02:33] given his word.
[2:02:35] There you go.
[2:02:36] God's already given his word. There you
[2:02:38] go.
[2:02:38] God has there'll not be another ministry
[2:02:41] like the ministry of Malachi 4.
[2:02:44] That was a prophetic ministry.
[2:02:48] No one stands before and judges a
[2:02:50] prophet. But that is to be judged every
[2:02:53] time.
[2:02:54] Yes, sir.
[2:02:55] And if someone says that ain't me,
[2:02:59] if it's returned back, hey, what you
[2:03:01] said about me, that that's not right.
[2:03:03] Here's my parents. That's not this isn't
[2:03:04] right. Somewhere along the line,
[2:03:07] something's got to come to order.
[2:03:11] That's good.
[2:03:12] But look where this look what brother is
[2:03:14] telling. He comes to brother Neville.
[2:03:16] Now, I want you to notice what's being
[2:03:17] said here. It's the people that's got
[2:03:20] because why what did brother tell us
[2:03:21] about Peter? When the supernatural
[2:03:23] happens, people get all enthused,
[2:03:25] right?
[2:03:26] But he says you'll start pulling on him.
[2:03:29] Brother Brandham says people squeeze in
[2:03:31] on those kind of people and they want to
[2:03:33] pull something from them. What does God
[2:03:35] show you about me? What did the Lord
[2:03:37] show you about me? What? And and he
[2:03:39] comes to that place and brother Bram
[2:03:40] says who will do it is you'll shove him
[2:03:42] right out in and make a false prophet
[2:03:44] out of him.
[2:03:48] Now I wonder when he came to brother
[2:03:50] Neville. Brother Neville's the pastor of
[2:03:52] this church. Now I wonder if brother
[2:03:55] Neville, he's not coming to him because
[2:03:57] he said something wrong.
[2:04:00] The spirit of the Lord did not bring him
[2:04:02] to brother Neville because you
[2:04:03] prophesied over somebody and they didn't
[2:04:05] get well.
[2:04:07] I've searched that all the way through.
[2:04:09] Talk to many. It was not what happened.
[2:04:12] But the spirit of the Lord alerted
[2:04:13] brother Brandham. Go talk to him
[2:04:16] and tell him not to be doing that over
[2:04:19] everyone. Don't allow people to pull.
[2:04:23] And I love how brother Brandham brings
[2:04:25] it in church order. He's showing the
[2:04:27] those that are there gathered there in
[2:04:29] 1963.
[2:04:30] He said the Holy Spirit I had to bring a
[2:04:32] word to brother Neville to correct him
[2:04:33] on something he was doing and the Holy
[2:04:35] Spirit has made me an overseer of the
[2:04:37] flock. Then it's my duty to tell you the
[2:04:38] truth. And I'm very grateful to Brother
[2:04:40] Neville. He heeded
[2:04:42] to the truth.
[2:04:44] Ain't that tremendous?
[2:04:46] Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
[2:04:47] And let me just say this to you. Brother
[2:04:50] Bram goes on and he comes around. I just
[2:04:55] over the time, you know, for me, I just
[2:04:56] don't think he's dropping. I want to see
[2:04:57] what did brother Brandham say? Did he go
[2:04:58] on to commend brother Brandham on
[2:05:00] prophesying? He does. 1964 questions and
[2:05:04] answers. He talks about how that the
[2:05:06] spirit of the Lord moved upon brother
[2:05:08] Neville to call somebody on the phone
[2:05:10] and prophesy over this person. You've
[2:05:13] tried aa, you've tried this, you've
[2:05:15] tried that, but thus sayaith the Lord,
[2:05:18] God delivers you from your drinking.
[2:05:20] It'll be in a few days.
[2:05:21] Hallelujah. And the man comes back
[2:05:23] around and gives a testimony. It's been
[2:05:25] 68 days and there's not any aa or
[2:05:28] nothing. I'm totally free.
[2:05:30] And brother Brandham uses that example
[2:05:32] for someone who says, "Brother Neville
[2:05:34] prophesied over me, 1964 questions and
[2:05:37] answers and said that I would receive
[2:05:38] the Holy Ghost in a full assurance and I
[2:05:42] haven't received it as of yet. Should I
[2:05:45] keep on?" Brother Brandham said,
[2:05:47] "Absolutely."
[2:05:49] That's good. Absolutely. You keep
[2:05:52] holding on. And what does he do? He
[2:05:55] refers them right back to that example
[2:05:58] of Brother Neville prophesying over that
[2:06:00] man whom God set free.
[2:06:04] You see what made the difference?
[2:06:07] Brother Neville heeded to the truth.
[2:06:11] That made the difference. And that makes
[2:06:13] a difference in our lives. Sometimes
[2:06:16] friends, it can just start with just a
[2:06:17] little thing in our life and things can
[2:06:20] just start fraying, fraying and fraying
[2:06:21] and fraying. But we'll never get any
[2:06:24] closer to God
[2:06:26] until that gets corrected.
[2:06:28] True.
[2:06:28] Now, you think you could tell the church
[2:06:30] church systems and world out here that
[2:06:31] they're not any closer to God? They'll
[2:06:33] tell you they're closer to God.
[2:06:34] That's right.
[2:06:35] They'll tell you they love God more than
[2:06:37] anything else. the expansiveness of, you
[2:06:40] know, ministries and everything else.
[2:06:43] But that's no sign of God's approval.
[2:06:47] The only sign of his approval is in the
[2:06:49] beloved and that's in the word.
[2:06:53] I want to be a son through and through.
[2:06:55] Don't you
[2:06:57] Lord? Whatever you ask of me, whatever's
[2:07:00] asked, Lord, God, help me, Lord. Let me
[2:07:02] let me be in that place, Lord. Let me
[2:07:04] let me respond to that that chastening
[2:07:06] of the Lord. Oh, I know it gets it gets
[2:07:08] hard sometimes, but you know what? He
[2:07:10] does it for our benefit that we might be
[2:07:13] partakers of his holiness.
[2:07:16] Let's pray.
[2:07:18] Heavenly Father,
[2:07:21] Lord, a word that as you would speak to
[2:07:24] our hearts and you know, Lord, I've I've
[2:07:26] looked at this, Lord, for a long time,
[2:07:29] Lord,
[2:07:31] passing through it, Lord, and just
[2:07:33] seeing just the the straightness
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:38] and how that Lord, you working just even
[2:07:41] in this channel,
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:44] laboring, Lord, many of them, Lord,
[2:07:47] right there before it ever came to that
[2:07:48] message there in church order. And even
[2:07:51] then it was instruction.
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:56] Brother Brown was even preaching. He was
[2:07:57] instructing.
[2:08:01] And many Lord, they set their time and
[2:08:03] time again.
[2:08:05] They heard instruction
[2:08:08] prior to that.
[2:08:11] But I wonder Lord how many of them
[2:08:15] walked away
[2:08:18] and they walked away because
[2:08:22] they felt led.
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:27] How many Lord went out from that Lord
[2:08:30] Jesus?
[2:08:33] Oh God,
[2:08:36] when it was brought down to where your
[2:08:38] prophet said, "Let's let's let the word
[2:08:41] be the judge." And when the word is
[2:08:44] brought, it'll judge itself.
[2:08:47] It'll show
[2:08:49] what it is.
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:52] Lord Jesus,
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:56] right here and right now,
[2:08:59] I want my life. If I believe the rest,
[2:09:01] Lord, could speak this with me as well.
[2:09:04] I want my life to be examined.
[2:09:08] Right now is our time of purgatory.
[2:09:12] Lord, I thank you for every time you've
[2:09:14] corrected me. I
[2:09:16] [Music]
[2:09:18] I admit, Lord, there's times, Lord, it
[2:09:20] just it cause us, Lord, because we just
[2:09:24] we don't want to let you down.
[2:09:28] Then I thank Lord how that you worked
[2:09:30] with the Corinthian church. There's
[2:09:33] things that they were doing. As Paul
[2:09:36] said, when I hear when one come among
[2:09:37] you, one's got a psalm, one's got a
[2:09:39] this, one's got a that, one's got a
[2:09:40] this. They really felt that way. Lord,
[2:09:44] what a victory it was for them to come
[2:09:47] to a place
[2:09:50] to be able to receive that correction.
[2:09:53] And when they would come into the house
[2:09:54] of God, come into the service,
[2:09:57] [Music]
[2:09:59] Lord, the more as they surrendered, it
[2:10:00] got to a place
[2:10:02] that those who continued on as sons of
[2:10:06] God,
[2:10:07] they didn't have that pressure of, "Oh,
[2:10:09] I've got to sing or I've got to do this
[2:10:11] or I've got to do that."
[2:10:13] They learned
[2:10:15] and were taught how to yield. Lord, that
[2:10:20] was a victory. It wasn't a victory that
[2:10:22] just something happened overnight.
[2:10:26] I would say Lord by the experience even
[2:10:28] in my own life of how things and the
[2:10:31] rest of us can fellowship on this.
[2:10:34] It was through much dying and
[2:10:37] submitting.
[2:10:40] Lord Jesus, help us. Help us, Lord,
[2:10:43] throughout our lives. There's nothing,
[2:10:45] Lord, that you will ask of us,
[2:10:49] to take us out of your will.
[2:10:52] Your desire, Lord, is always to help us.
[2:10:56] Your desire, Lord, even as you
[2:10:57] administer that through Paul, is that
[2:11:00] the body might be edified,
[2:11:03] built up in love. Lord, I pray, God,
[2:11:06] help us, Lord. Help every one of us,
[2:11:09] Lord Jesus.
[2:11:12] from pastor Lord to janitor to every one
[2:11:14] of us Lord God, husbands, fathers,
[2:11:17] mothers, daughters, sons, Lord, help us
[2:11:20] Lord God as sons and daughters of God.
[2:11:24] Lord Jesus
[2:11:28] as you train us, Lord.
[2:11:32] Oh, how we're thankful for your
[2:11:33] longsuffering, your gentleness,
[2:11:37] your mercy.
[2:11:39] Lord, you know just what we have need
[2:11:41] of.
[2:11:44] Lord Jesus,
[2:11:46] I want another refilling of the Holy
[2:11:48] Spirit.
[2:11:50] Hallelujah.
[2:11:51] I believe, Lord God, throughout this
[2:11:53] congregation, there's others that could
[2:11:55] say the same thing. I I don't want more
[2:11:57] of it, Lord, to do signs and wonders. I
[2:12:00] don't want more of the Holy Spirit that
[2:12:02] I might be able to somehow preach
[2:12:04] better. No. No. I don't want that.
[2:12:07] I wanted that I could be more of a
[2:12:09] servant, Lord, like you were.
[2:12:15] I want more, Lord.
[2:12:18] I can look, Lord. We can look through
[2:12:20] the word as the word comes before our
[2:12:22] lives. I can see it. We can see our
[2:12:25] deficiencies,
[2:12:26] but we can see through that that you are
[2:12:28] our strength, Lord. As we'll surrender
[2:12:31] our weaknesses, acknowledge them, Lord.
[2:12:34] Surrender to you. Then you will pour
[2:12:36] your strength into our lives and you'll
[2:12:38] use your strength to accomplish the job.
[2:12:44] Help us, Lord.
[2:12:46] Help us, Lord. We're in a time in an
[2:12:49] hour and a season, Lord. We can't think
[2:12:51] like children no more.
[2:12:56] But Lord God, in becoming a man, one of
[2:12:58] the clearest things is putting away
[2:13:01] childish things.
[2:13:06] No, the gifts are not childish. No,
[2:13:09] that's not what Paul was saying at all,
[2:13:11] Lord.
[2:13:13] It was the thinking.
[2:13:16] It was that about them,
[2:13:19] but becoming
[2:13:21] men,
[2:13:23] having an understanding,
[2:13:24] [Music]
[2:13:26] discernment, coming in like your prophet
[2:13:29] brought it between the gift and the Holy
[2:13:31] Spirit.
[2:13:33] Oh God, help us.
[2:13:36] Help us, Lord. I pray, Father.
[2:13:39] Lord, every area of our life, Lord, no
[2:13:41] doubt, Father, right here today,
[2:13:44] decisions that we make today,
[2:13:48] even regarding your word
[2:13:52] will affect us in days to come.
[2:13:57] Sometimes Lord, decisions that's made
[2:13:59] within a home,
[2:14:02] a family,
[2:14:03] it'll affect it. Those decisions Lord
[2:14:06] cannot be buried. They come, they come
[2:14:08] forth and it'll affect.
[2:14:12] Oh God, may we take the discipline of
[2:14:15] the word right now. May every one of us
[2:14:17] in here.
[2:14:19] Oh God, grant it. I wonder if we just
[2:14:22] couldn't lift our hands to him and say,
[2:14:23] "Yes, Lord." if that's your desire. Yes,
[2:14:26] Lord. I want to take that discipline of
[2:14:28] the word right now. I want my life,
[2:14:30] Lord, to follow the discipline book
[2:14:34] because one of these days, the atoms of
[2:14:37] this body is going to follow under that
[2:14:39] discipline of the word, that hour, that
[2:14:42] season, that time, and there will be a
[2:14:44] change that'll sweep right over us.
[2:14:47] Grant it, Lord God. I pray, Father. Help
[2:14:50] us, Lord God. Help us, Lord, as your
[2:14:53] children. Give strength, Lord, to each
[2:14:55] heart. I know some of us, Lord, we're in
[2:14:58] different places, Lord, even in our
[2:14:59] walk, in our journey. But God, may you
[2:15:02] continue to minister strength, Lord,
[2:15:04] that father as hearts and lives said,
[2:15:05] "Yes, Lord. That's your word, Lord. I
[2:15:08] want to see that word in my life." Grant
[2:15:10] it, Lord, as a son and daughter of God.
[2:15:14] We love you, Lord.
[2:15:17] Thank you, Father. Lord, we're not
[2:15:20] illegitimates. We're sons.
[2:15:23] And if we receive it, if we endure the
[2:15:25] chastening, then God deals with us as
[2:15:28] sons.
[2:15:30] Thank you, Father.
[2:15:32] Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:34] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your
[2:15:36] mercy. Oh, aren't you glad how he deals
[2:15:39] with us? Aren't you thankful how he
[2:15:41] ministers to us? His word just goes over
[2:15:44] our life.
[2:15:46] Thank you, Lord God. Oh, I want to rise
[2:15:49] to meet it. Don't you? I want to rise to
[2:15:52] meet it Lord

[2:17:30] calling me to yourself.

[2:18:03] Yes, Lord.
[2:18:06] Oh,
[2:18:08] God.
[2:18:10] Draw me and guide me. Lead
[2:18:15] me. Walk beside me for I give my life
[2:18:23] to the Pers.
[2:18:27] One more time. Take me, Lord.

[2:18:32] Take me,
[2:18:35] hold me, hold me, use me,
[2:18:42] build me. Oh, I give my life
[2:18:48] the pot.
[2:18:52] Hallelujah.
[2:18:54] Call me Lord. Lord Jesus, call me.
[2:19:00] Guide me.
[2:19:03] Lead me, walk beside me.
[2:19:09] I give my life to the pro
[2:19:15] hands.
[2:19:19] Amen. God bless you tonight. I know I I
[2:19:22] kept you a little longer and wanted to
[2:19:24] try to get that in tonight.
[2:19:27] Amen.
[2:19:29] Oh, I thank God for his mercy. Don't
[2:19:31] you?
[2:19:32] Yes, he does.
[2:19:33] Hallelujah.
[2:19:35] Oh, I just I just so appreciate him. So
[2:19:37] appreciate just such a wonderful
[2:19:39] presence, a wonderful atmosphere.
[2:19:41] God is so good to us, friends.
[2:19:44] He's so mindful to us.
[2:19:46] There's no doubt there's things that you
[2:19:47] can sit right here tonight and know
[2:19:52] God would give direction to our lives.
[2:19:54] And boy, there's certain decisions we're
[2:19:56] glad that we didn't make.
[2:19:57] Yes, sir. Right.
[2:19:58] Yes, sir. And then there's other
[2:20:00] decisions we did make. Boy, how we're
[2:20:02] thankful for God's grace that he he
[2:20:05] didn't just take away all the
[2:20:07] consequences. God has a way of leading
[2:20:09] us, guiding us.
[2:20:12] It sometimes allows the sting of things
[2:20:14] to be felt a little while. You know why?
[2:20:16] Sometimes the sting is instruction.
[2:20:19] That's right. So true.
[2:20:22] Yeah. Sometimes the things that you know
[2:20:25] sometimes seeds that are sown. Oh, we
[2:20:27] don't like those seeds that are sown.
[2:20:28] Well, I'm just going to I'm going to
[2:20:30] come to the altar and ask God to get rid
[2:20:32] of that whole crop. No. Once a crop has
[2:20:35] been sown, it's got to come to harvest.
[2:20:37] But if you can recognize what's wrong,
[2:20:40] then God can give you the grace to walk
[2:20:43] through that bitter harvest as a son and
[2:20:45] daughter of God.
[2:20:47] But you'll learn from that. We learn
[2:20:50] from it. not to sew the same kind of
[2:20:52] seed. But what if God What if we came up
[2:20:55] and God just said, "I will burn the
[2:20:57] whole field down. You won't have to deal
[2:20:58] with any of that.
[2:21:01] We'd end up doing it again."
[2:21:04] You know, that's like, "I promise I
[2:21:06] won't do it. Oh, daddy, don't whip me.
[2:21:07] Don't me. I promise I won't do it
[2:21:08] again." But God knows how sometimes,
[2:21:10] even through the the training of things.
[2:21:13] But you know what? I'm glad that when we
[2:21:15] have to go through a bitter harvest, I'm
[2:21:17] glad he's right there with us.
[2:21:18] Aren't you? I'm glad that he don't just
[2:21:21] just abandon us. He deals with us as
[2:21:23] sons if we endure chastening.
[2:21:26] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:21:28] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Brian, won't
[2:21:31] you come and dismiss us in a word of
[2:21:33] prayer? Amen.
[2:21:36] Brother Gabriel, the black mic.
[2:21:38] [Music]
[2:21:40] Thank you.
[2:21:42] Let's bow our heads.
[2:21:45] Heavenly Father, Lord God, we come. Lord
[2:21:47] God, thank you, Lord, Father God, for
[2:21:49] the word you've brought to us, Lord,
[2:21:51] today, Father God. Lord, we Lord, we
[2:21:54] just come, Lord, humbly, Lord God,
[2:21:56] asking you to just continue working
[2:21:58] through our lives, Lord, to draw us
[2:22:00] close to you, to walk in your footsteps,
[2:22:03] Lord, Father God, that you walk, Lord
[2:22:04] God, that we may be more like you, Lord
[2:22:06] God, that the world may see you through
[2:22:08] us, Lord, Father God. Oh, Father God, we
[2:22:11] just love you, Lord God. We just want to
[2:22:14] live a life, Lord God, that would draw
[2:22:16] more people to you, Lord, Father God.
[2:22:18] The last soul, Father God, that would
[2:22:20] come to you, Lord, Father God, that may
[2:22:22] draw us close, Lord God, to the rapture,
[2:22:25] Lord God, that we are desiring, Lord, to
[2:22:27] see you, Father God.
[2:22:30] Lord, we love you, Lord. Again, Lord,
[2:22:32] Father God, we thank you for the
[2:22:34] teaching, the guiding, the chastisement,
[2:22:36] Father God. Lord, we just want to give
[2:22:39] our will and our life to you, Lord.
[2:22:41] Father God, humbly Lord God, that you
[2:22:44] may continue working in our lives,
[2:22:47] Father God, we just ask, Lord God, that
[2:22:49] you be with those that could not make
[2:22:50] it, Lord God, that Father God, that they
[2:22:53] somehow will hear this message, Lord,
[2:22:55] Father God, Lord, that it may stir their
[2:22:58] hearts, Lord, Father God, to draw them
[2:23:01] back to you to where they need to be,
[2:23:03] Father God, that you would want them to
[2:23:05] be, Lord. We love you, Lord, Father God.
[2:23:08] We give you all the glory and honor and
[2:23:09] praise in the precious name of the Lord
[2:23:11] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[2:23:20] Take me,
[2:23:23] hold me,
[2:23:26] use me,
[2:23:28] fill me.
[2:23:31] I give my life unto the water's hand.
[2:23:40] Lord Jesus, all me.
[2:23:44] Yes, Lord.
[2:23:45] Guide me. Lord, lead me. Walk beside me.
[2:23:53] I give my life to the part of sand.
[2:24:01] Hold me and guide me, Lord. Jesus call
[2:24:05] me.
[2:24:07] Guide me.
[2:24:10] Lead me. Walk beside me.
[2:24:15] I give my life unto
[2:24:19] the potter sand.
[2:24:23] I give my life
[2:24:27] my life unto
[2:24:30] the

[2:24:33] Lord Jesus. Yes Lord
[2:24:39] [Music]
[2:24:41] and broken.
[2:24:44] I came back
[2:24:48] to him.
[2:24:50] I was a vessel
[2:24:53] so unworthy.
[2:24:56] Though I was a soul
[2:24:59] scarred by sin.
[2:25:02] Oh, but he did not
[2:25:06] despair.
[2:25:08] He started over
[2:25:13] again.
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:15] And I bless the day.
[2:25:21] He didn't throw
[2:25:23] the clay away.

[2:26:26] Oh, molded in
[2:26:30] his image.
[2:26:32] That's how he wants me
[2:26:35] to say. But when I stumble
