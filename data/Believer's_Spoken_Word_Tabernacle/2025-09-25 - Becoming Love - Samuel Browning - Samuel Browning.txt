God bless you. And thank you, musicians. Amen. Amen. So good to be together here once again. And I want to just read here from a few portions of scripture. And as we just prepare to look into the word of the Lord and Amen. There's just nothing like just an opportunity to be able to come together and just to be able to amen to feast on the word of God. Amen. Amen. 1 John chapter 3 and verse 11. You know what I love about coming and putting our feet under the table is, you know, it's just little things you, you know, in in God's word that all of a sudden God will just send a brother by and he'll point something out. And one thing I love is I heard a brother mention about uh one of David's um Saul's sons uh that was there, one of those that had left over, you know, that actually had the the crippledness in his feet. But when he came to the what was the name? &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, we'll get I'm not going to try to pronounce that right now. But at any rate, I think we all we all know. But this is the thing to me that I I just it just you know, it just struck me. I heard it months and months ago, but you know, when David invited him to his table, when you got under when you was at the table, his crippledness &gt;&gt; was under the table. What was on the table was the meal and the meat. And I'm thankful there's a place where every bit of our lameness and our crippledness and things is not just hidden, but it's right there where God can take care of every situation. Amen. Where everything is just right out. Amen. Amen. Before God. Amen. To give us the strength and encouragement we need. Let's look here in verse 11. For this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. Now watch how Paul John writes this. Wherefore slew he him, because his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous. You know that, you know where this happened? Right in church. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's where everything set in at first. Brother Bam, we'll go through that over and over. Jealousy set in because what Cain saw is how God accepted Abel's sacrifice and then jealousy set in in his life. So the reason that he did what he did is because his own works were evil and his brothers were righteous. Now watch verse 13. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. I want you to just watch this scripture here tonight. We know we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Now notice John's writing about the brethren. How many believe that the love of God is something to be expressed to all? Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But it's just like in your family, among your children, the love that you have to them is on a different degree than it is to somebody else's children. &gt;&gt; So this awareness would be where John would write of this and John's one that would write over and over through the chapters about the love to the brethren. So there must be something about it in this fellowship what we would be uh partaking of that there would be a communion of fellowship and even within that there would actually be a declaration from our hearts that indeed we are abiding in eternal life because we love the brethren. So it's not just love. You know, many people can talk about love and say we have love and there's many pe you know no doubt many people there's no doubt people on your job and you're thankful for they're lovely. &gt;&gt; I mean who who likes I mean I I like working with people that are lovely, &gt;&gt; right? I mean appreciate when I go to the mountain meat counter or wherever I go and in a store or whatever more. I appreciate people that are lovely. &gt;&gt; You appreciate that. But this is something that we're not just talking about lovely, but we're talking about that absolutely agape love. Now, he that loveth not his brother abideth in death. In verse 15, whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. Verse 23, if we'll skip there. And this is the commandment that we should believe on the name of the son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment. Now watch how John continues to bring this together because a person could say, "Well, I love the brethren." But John continues to bring this down by the spirit of God that whosoever would believe on the name. So what is the name? Well, the name is Jesus Christ. But what is the name? The name is his own life. The Bible tells us in the book of Revelation, his name is called, not is, but is called the word of God. So how does God reveal his name? He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. How does he do that? By revealing his word. And he reveals himself to his children. So it's God revealing his name. And there's no situation, no need, no condition that's beyond or above the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you've received the spirit of God in your life, do you realize that the name of Jesus Christ has been exalted in your life and in your spirits? &gt;&gt; It's been exalted above whatever you were before and every past. It's been exalted above everything within the family. Let me read this again. that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment. Now what John brings these two things together and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I want to speak on becoming love. And we've been looking at pursuing the right thing, but I want to begin to work and begin to drop this part in here on becoming love. There's some different things that we've touched on that if the Lord would help us here even over the coming weeks of different parts that if as he would see fit for us to look at here. But I think that when we look at this on becoming love, even as John would write of this down through the scriptures, as we said, there's many times where we can read in 1 Corinthians 13 where Paul would express of what charity is. And yet there's many times where even some of those attributes of what charity would produce, longsuffering, it doesn't keep any records and so forth and so on. All of those things is what is an actual product of charity, of the love of God being in our lives. So, it isn't something that we're just as though we're striving to do this, we're striving to do that, but it's it's actually deeper than us just, you know, wanting to be lovely. It's more than God. When God begins to speak to us about the love of God, he's actually talking to us about his own life, who he is, and who we really are to become. Because if we are sons and daughters of God here tonight, how many believe you're son and daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Then as a son and daughter of God, you you never had a beginning. You were always eternal with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you've come into this life into time. And then God by his spirit comes to manifest or reveal that part that was always in him as a son and daughter of God. And that expression comes out that not only do we love the brethren, but we also are walking right in step and have a love for the word because we cannot love our brother and not love the word. &gt;&gt; It it won't work. were not then we could love our brother but it's not the right degree because the only in order to actually have that right kind of love it would have to be agape love because there's been times we can look back over our lives and think of many people that we enjoyed being around and so forth but you just let conditions change just let friendships change just let something to where that you maybe have to write them up you have you cross them in some way on the job or something happens and all of a sudden you're being snubbed Am I right? &gt;&gt; Those are things what happens the conditions changed. But see this is why we needed something deeper than just our felio love because felio love is simply based on that of conditions. That's why we need more than that even in our marriages because in just in our marriages yet we will love our spouses with felio love. But if there's not the agape love that's down that's back there behind that that's able to put that into its right place and actually be the source of motivation then all it takes is conditions to change and then situations begin to move apart. See, this is why that even as we look at this and I I don't I'm just I know I'm kind of off here right now, but we understand that conditions themselves, we've been looking at that conditions themselves will change with time. We can see that right among us even as as husband and wife and there's things that will change. There's little idiosyncrasies and then there's even situations that change in life. The prophet tells us every seven years we go through a change. He tells us there's two major changes in the message indictment. There's the change from that going into uh that of a young young lady, a young man and then there's a little change later in life and going into that of a you know an older as we get older and different changes. All these things are changing even in our body. Certain things change even about us. That's why there's got to be something that is constant that will give us grace that when certain things change, God remains the same because he said, "I'm God and I change not." So in looking at this on becoming love, let me just read here a quote to you out of broken sistns. Brother Brham is talking about to brother veil him and brother veil were discussing on what you know maybe the evidence of the Holy Ghost is and brother Brandham you know when they're talking about it at one point brother Vale was actually you know looking at it and saying I I just can't I just can't see it speak being speaking in tongues and brother Bram said I can't see that either and he said you know he says I I'm never taught that and neither do I he says but the only thing brother Bram says the most perfect evidence that I could think of now this is 1964 you can see that over this is the most perfect evidence I could think of is love. So we got to talking on that and then I thought that sounded pretty good. So I just held that if a man has got love. But one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out. And he said the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word. Neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word &gt;&gt; then then then Dr. prevail was saying to me that's scriptural. John 14, many of you are coming back to mind. John 14, John 16, John 15. When he the Holy Ghost has come upon you, he will reveal these things to you that I've taught you and you will and will show you things to come. So there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost. He has never told me anything wrong yet. That is the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word, you can receive it. Brother Ram says because Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost has come you'll speak with tongues. He never said the Holy Ghost come you never do any of those things. But he said he will take these things of mine and show them to you and will show you things that is to come. So there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost according to Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we look at this here, this portion within the scripture, John is not writing and being contradictory at all because remember the Lord Jesus, he said, "A new commandment I give you that you would love one another as I have loved you." Now remember who he's speaking to. He's speaking to that of the disciples that are gathered together. And by this all men will know that you are my disciples. Well, who is he? He is the word. Is that right? So all men will know by the expression of divine love that we are disciples of the living word. Because in order the the actual product of being a disciple of the living word is to follow that word will also be to recognize that other part of the word that lays within each and every son and daughter of God. Because every son and daughter of God all the way down through the ages, we were called to take our place in the body of Jesus Christ. Everyone has your allotted part within that. Every elect seed of God, you're a part of that word, that word to be expressed. This is why that the prophet would say it over and over. He said, "I could preach a Lutheran message, but it would never take an effect upon you." Wesley's message, it'll never take effect upon you. Pentecostal's message, it'll never take effect on you. But there had to come the message that God in that was that was intended for this hour and this season. There would be a seed on the earth that was ordained to receive the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that would be poured out in this hour. And when I say the Holy Spirit, I'm talking about the word because the Holy Ghost and the word are not two separate things. This is why that when the Holy Spirit, a person has actually been baptized with the Holy Ghost, been sealed away with the spirit of God, it has now become a portion or a part of the word expressed in their life. So what is inside of your life being expressed? It is a part of the word for this day. So when that has happened, there's no way that out of that life that a life that's actually been spiritfilled where the spirit of God has sealed it. There's absolutely no way that there could come out anything from that life besides an amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; If it comes out any other way, whether it's an attribute of unbelief and oh, you don't have to do this and you don't have to do that. It it doesn't matter how many baptisms they've had on their spirit. &gt;&gt; What matters is has it ever come to that soul to where they love God more than anything else. And when they love God more than anything else, and I'm not talking about just loving a thought or a concept. God is not a figment of our imagination. He is the word. And how does he reveal himself and make himself known as the same yesterday, today, and forever. I'm God and I change not. His nature does not change. How does God reveal himself? He reveals himself in the form of the word. Think about it. walking on the road to Emmas. When he was there with them, their eyes were withholden that they should know him. Now, the prophet says in one place, he said they had a little bit of an idea that it was him. But you see, we needed more than just a a perhaps or a maybe or a I presume or I think. But God wanted them to have a certainty. And there's no other place that you can rest your faith in than the word of God. And so what he did has God himself moving down there and through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, he so established their faith in God's work of the atonement to where when it came time for their corresponding part to go into the upper room. They did not go in there with uncertainty. They went in there with a certainty knowing that God has fulfilled his word. And that part that belongs to me, God has made a way that then now this word regarding what Joel said that he would pour out the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God would actually be able to come through the opening of the blood that was shed back upon the worshipper and bring the worshipper back into that place of perfection of fellowship with God. The Bible says they went to the upper room with joy. Now let me just tell you, you don't come to get the Holy Ghost with sadness or uncertainty. Yes, within our hearts, yes, there should be conviction. There's grieving. But let me just say this to you. You come with a thanksgiving that first of all that God has revealed himself to you to be the same. And if he's done that, that's a sure sign right there that if God's making himself known to you that he's the same, that's a sure sign that the Holy Ghost is for you. The Bible said, "Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness. They shall be filled." Brother Brown, why am I hungering this way? He said, "It's a sure sign. The Holy Ghost is upon you, and it's God leading you to receive it." You see, God doesn't want to confuse us. He wants to build our faith because after all, the Holy Ghost is the seal of God accepting our faith. Think about that. It's God who's actually the one revealing himself to you and I. His loving kindness. It's his mercy. And what does it do? It raises our faith. And God steps in at that moment. What is God doing? God is actually honoring the effects of his love being expressed to our life and there being that part that's caught back and God recognizes. You know what God is saying? He's saying the same thing that he said regarding Abel's sacrifice. When Abel and Cain came before the gate, when God looked at Cain's sacrifice, all he could see was Cain. But when God looked at Abel's sacrifice, he couldn't see Abel. He saw himself. And God honored that sacrifice. And Abel obtained a witness that he was righteous. Righteous by what? The revelation that it was blood that took him out. And it must be blood of an innocent one bring them back in. So Abel was a worshshiper hidden beneath the blood because revelation had made a way for him to come back into fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; So here within this God is love. The Bible tells us God is love. And I put that scripture there because John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the word." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the word was with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the word was God. Yes. &gt;&gt; So God is love and God is the word. &gt;&gt; They come and they operate. It works together. Now I want you just to think of this in the scripture here in 1 John chapter 4 and verse six. We are of God. I love that. &gt;&gt; Can we just say that together? &gt;&gt; We are of God. &gt;&gt; He that knoweth God heareth us. It has a meaning to them. This isn't just, oh, you know, uh, you know, I got to go to church and I, but it has a meaning to us. And, and the word, it has a meaning. You say, what do you mean it has a meaning? It's something that stirs our heart that we just can't get enough of God. This word, it has a meaning to us. It isn't just gibberish. It isn't just something that's just being said, but it's it's it's a word. It has meaning. It has substance to our lives. &gt;&gt; That's right. He &gt;&gt; that is not of God heareth us. Heareth not us. Hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Wow, we don't need that. We don't need to hear that. We don't need But you see, if there's something that is God in his grace has given you the ability to hear, it's not you. It's not you your ability, but God has given you the ability to hear. The Bible said over and over through every one of those ages, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the church. God giving his revelation and direction. Now watch this. Verse seven. Beloved, let us love one another. For love is of God. &gt;&gt; And everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. Now watch how John goes on. He that loveth not knoweth not God. &gt;&gt; For God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. Here in his love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us &gt;&gt; and he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. And if we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us. Look, notice that. This is some very incredible statements here. If I can, if I if you would allow me to say it in that way, it's a litmus test. It is something that that checks cuz you know, you could sample the water and say it don't taste very acidic. Let somebody else who's a little bit more sensitive, they'll say, "Oh, no, it's very acidic." But there's one way to tell it is put an actual strip, a litmus test on it and that'll tell. The litmus test will not lie. So when we consider this, if we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his spirit is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit. So a person could read right there and no doubt many have. But remember the word is not disjointed. It is complimentary. It goes together. And to recognize that the word, God is the word. And it was the word that actually began to condensed to become one of us in redemption. What brought him down was his love, his desire for fellowship, his love for his fallen creation. Why was it in the beginning? God never sent an angel when the fall took place in the beginning. But God himself came down in the garden. And remember when they were going out, how many times you hear, brother Brandham, dramatize it when they were going out and God made and took the clan the the skins of an innocent one and threw them back in there so they could take those skins and put them on and stand in his presence. And as they walked out of the garden, the B brother Ram tells us, he said, "How that great pillar of cloud, it came down and begin to spell Lo V. I will make a way back for you." &gt;&gt; And to think about it, God wasn't going to give us some way, but the way back to being a son and daughter of God would actually require God himself to become one of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no other way for us to get back there than other than for God to become one of us and make a way and open the way back for you and I. What did that for you and I? Certainly not because we deserved it. You might say, "Well, we were always sons and daughters of God." But let me remind you, the condition that we were living in, some of us could not even get along with our own selves, much less anybody else. So, who in the world sweetened you and I? who in the world God through and by his grace coming down and his life coming and dealing with our hearts, he begins to deal on your heart, you begin to receive a new heart. You begin to receive a new spirit. Still not filled with the spirit of God yet, but God says from those two things, then I will put my spirit right in the midst of your being. &gt;&gt; Well, what is that new heart? What is that new spirit? It's a portion of the Holy Spirit. it now when the Holy Spirit himself has come. It has now been portion after portion now leads to the very Holy Spirit himself coming to dwell in the house that he's cleaned up and set aside for himself. So notice this, no man hath seen God at any time. And if we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us. So So a person could actually say, well, you know, I I I love everybody. I love everybody. And you know what? You couldn't dispute that. And not that we're interested in doing that. But if a person says that they love the brethren in the right way and yet their life does not match up with the word of God, it's something within the word. Oh, you don't have to do that. You don't have to do that. All you got to do is love the brethren. But that's not all the story. Loving the brethren is only now a product of the word abiding in our life because God is love and God is the word. So what will love be? It will be the actual product of God himself dwelling in the midst of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my, look at this. Hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world. How do how do you see that? How do you testify that? Well, look what he has done for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's not just something you're looking at it as, well, I I receive him in salvation. Many, there'll be many that will be saved, but they do not see him in the expression of his word in this hour. That that is reserved alone for the bride of Jesus Christ. Yet God, what does he do? The prophet tells us he broadcasts this message to all. God broadcast it to all. And God's not in here saying, "Well, you can't have it and you can have it and you can't have it." No. But God knows when he begins to reveal himself. There are those that have always been a part of him that is just like a magnet that's pack passing down through. When those things are magnetized to him, they will actually be drawn to him. Cuz he said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me." So, we're not lifting up a denominational idea of Jesus. We're not just lifting up, well, he he's a savior. He is a savior, but he's also a redeemer and he's a deliverer. And God's desire was that there would come an absolute witness of what has been revealed in our life has now become a testimony that I am redeemed. It's not just me that's saying it but the father that dwelleth in me. That portion is actually identifying I am no longer what I used to be. And there is something that reality that has changed inside of my life. What's happened? Christ has made his abode. He's taken his rest in his temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you become a display, a witness &gt;&gt; that you can say in your own life, your own witness out of your own life, what he did for me, he'll do for you. &gt;&gt; People you come in contact with in the job and everywhere that God has us dispersed. Listen friends, if God wanted us to live in some kind of a commune and all all of a sudden on this property, we put a bunch of trailers and had a bunch of stores and we didn't leave anything else. God's not interested in creating a cult. Oh, amen. That's great. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; He's not interested in creating a commune because you know why? There's more of his children that's out there. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say it like this, too. There's more that are not as far as his elect, but they need to see the expression of who he is to even come to salvation. &gt;&gt; They may never come to see this truth, but if they're saved, I'll say, "Thank you, Lord, for touching that life." That's one more life that was stripped out of the hand of the enemy. They may never see this truth, but as long as they are saved, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him. So confession is by a life. &gt;&gt; It's not just what we say, but it's the life that is lived. That's why the life that's lived, Lord, let let everything that I what is being expressed, let it match your word. &gt;&gt; Let everything, let every attribute, if there's any unbelief, whatever it might be, Lord God, out of my life, it's dress, it's whatever more, let it all be resolved that it might be you that's expressed completely. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God. And we have known and believe the love that God hath to us. God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. So you were the prophet would take this over and over. You were as a son and daughter of God. You're his attribute. You were with him clear back in the loins of God's mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God coming down, he had to become one of us. And when God became one of us, as the prophet said, he transferred us from the loins of God's mind into the loins of Jesus because he was the word made flesh. We were here in him. Listen to me. This is why the prophet said, "We went to Calvary in him. He made me pay for my sin in him." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You see, and it became because of him, it allowed you and I to come to a place to lay down our own life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because of him. And when he got up on that Easter morning, we got up with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why when the Holy Spirit comes to deal with your life, your life has not meant to just lay here and and among the world, but there is a resurrection. There's an identification that's calling on you to say, "Come up higher." &gt;&gt; You you you've got a higher purpose. There's there's more in your life. Well, you know, even you can say, "Well, I'm saved." But then God begins to deal with your life and you realize, "Wait a minute. There's something more. I there's something I I need more. And what it is that you need is that portion of God that God allotted for you. And Jesus made the way that you could have that part of your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're his attribute. And notice how God God built himself an attribute. God could not, as the prophet said, fellowship in the spirit. So God became man with us. He built himself a house, a body to live in. And he come down so he could we could touch him. And he says, "Now you being flesh," this is out of the same same portion, "and him being flesh, then you can fellowship now cuz he was God's attribute of love and God is love." He was God's attribute of love. God is love. And Jesus was God's attribute of love. And when the attribute of love was displayed, which that was God himself, all the attributes that hung on to him come to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what was he? What is he? Love. &gt;&gt; God is love. God is the word. And when that great attribute of love of the word was displayed, every attribute that hung on to that attribute, &gt;&gt; came. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; You know, how many of you heard Brother Bram say over and over all the way through the messages on love and he says it like this. He said, "When love is projected &gt;&gt; and comes to its end, &gt;&gt; Amen. Then sovereign grace steps in. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a lot there's a lot of thick cream right there to be applied to every one of our lives in in every situation when love has been projected. Remember litmus test comes back into our own life if when we're looking at it because when love listen when love is being projected love itself is holding you love is overshadowing it's pulsating through your emotions and your feelings and it's it's just because love remember is what produces faith &gt;&gt; or brother Sam I've been projecting love but I ain't seen no change then you've not been projecting agape love. You might you might be, but don't don't don't just all of a sudden make a detour and don't put it on your timeline because let me tell you, love was projected and it was 2,000 years and then grace stepped in. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? All the way down through the prophets, every one of them were speaking of Christ. The Bible said in Isaiah 53, he was he is sorry, he is despised and rejected. It was Christ in Abraham. It was Christ in Moses. It was Christ in Noah. It was Christ in David. It was glimpse of the Messiah with messianic promises all the way down. What was doing that? Love had been projected. And when love's projected, sovereign grace will step in and produce what love has called for. &gt;&gt; I I just to me I would be simple enough to say, God, let that be that kind of love, &gt;&gt; Lord, because my you know, felio love just just as much as like you starting on a project and man, you start painting a wall and all of a sudden you realize, man, this thing, who in the world put wallpaper on this wall? this this pain ain't even going on, right? Man, what in the world we got to do? And what you thought was a day job now becomes a weekend job, &gt;&gt; right? It becomes frustrating. But see, that's how feel love is. Felio love can become frustrating because it's based on conditions. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you this. What are you giving me back? &gt;&gt; But that's why there's got to be more than felio love. Because if God never answered another prayer, &gt;&gt; if everything turned against us, we would still have the strength of God's love to not only stand but even love those that's turned against us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, he was the attribute of love displayed and all the father has given me will come to me. They had to be predestinated. If you wasn't, you won't be there. Now, watch how brother Brandham simply places this way back in 1952. He says, now we know drinking and carrying on is sin. The whole thing is because of unbelief. Those are only attributes, &gt;&gt; right? All the attributes, no matter what it is, dress and everything else that comes out and uh immorality, those are all attributes. It's just like it's like a a person saying, "Well, I need to stop this and I need to stop that." What it is, remember, every one of those every one of those attributes is a symptom of unbelief. &gt;&gt; And that's what we got to get where we have to come to is is that what's the root of the problem is unbelief. Because like the prophet said, when you believe, you won't do those things. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I know that sounds it sounds very simple, but it's it's the gospel truth. Because if you believe God in Jesus Christ to be his son, you are absolutely not going to do those things. He said, "He that's born of God does not commit sin." You must believe. The whole thing lays in faith. How many How many heard brother Bam say, "Brother Bram never said if you feel it." He said, "No, brother said like this." He said, "Did you ever say hear Jesus say, "Did you feel it?" He says, "It's not did you feel it? Do you believe it?" Amen. &gt;&gt; You see the word, listen, in order for the word to produce itself, you first got to agree with it. &gt;&gt; You have to agree with it that the word is true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Take the word above your own thoughts. And don't let your thoughts determine whether or not that the word is worthy to be taken. There's a battle. Remember the prophet said in greatest battle ever fought, he said there's a battle sitting behind right before each and every one. He talked about the young girl who was sitting there and bound in that in that cot or whatever. And he said Satan is standing right there battling against her mind, &gt;&gt; battling against her. We're in a battleground. This isn't a place to relax. This is a battleground. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the whole thing about it is is the contest is Satan is wanting you to try to take the word by your reasoning. And your reasoning is based on you. &gt;&gt; But you've got to take the word above your reasoning. And when you take the word above your reasoning, thy word is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the word it will over it will move beyond. And as the word flows down, it will blow out that reasoning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan is there to always confess that he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but already passed from death unto life. He said, "Do you believe?" That's the truth. There it lays. There isn't nothing else that you can do. Only believe. Now watch this. And if you believe then them little immoral things just drop off like that. &gt;&gt; And you believe you become love. &gt;&gt; Not becoming lovely. &gt;&gt; You become love &gt;&gt; because why? You are becoming the absolute expression of what love has called for. &gt;&gt; Who is love? God. He is the word. You are now an expression of what love has called for. My my my love did not call for a hybrid son and daughter. But love called for give me an heir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God issued that through Abraham give me an heir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abraham was willing to say Eleazar. But God said no that shall not be thine heir but one that comes from thine own loins. What was that? That was God expressing his desire for his hes &gt;&gt; and he couldn't take anything else outside of his word. His heirs would be that of his word. That's why we are joint hes &gt;&gt; with Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As you believe, as you believe, &gt;&gt; let me just say this to you. Don't put God on a timet. Don't become anxious. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Don't become anxious. Even when you're hearing the word of God, let me just tell you something. When God is dealing with our lives and conviction strikes, you don't want to be anxious. Just submit to the word right then &gt;&gt; because the whole purpose God listen, you know how blessed you are to be able to receive and heed to conviction. &gt;&gt; You know how blessed you are? Amen. &gt;&gt; There was there was religious men when Stephen started to preach that as soon as he started to preach the gospel. These were men you couldn't put a finger on their lives. &gt;&gt; Right? Soon as the gospel, the word started getting preached, you seen that old spirit like Cain rise up. The Bible says they &gt;&gt; on him with their teeth. All right. &gt;&gt; What brought that about was because Stephen was preaching the revealed word of the hour that Jesus Christ is indeed the answer of the messianic promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought God from history to a present in God. He brought it from will be will be until he has come. He is here now. And this is the fulfillment of you crucified him and now this life that you are hearing. This spirit is his own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were brought to a moment to a junction. &gt;&gt; And what happened? Like Cain, they got jealous. &gt;&gt; They could say they loved Moses, but they couldn't love Moses and hate and hate the revealed word. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's why Jesus said, "Your righteousness has got to be a lot bigger than the righteousness of the Pharisees." &gt;&gt; Cuz if you love them that love love you, you're no different than them. &gt;&gt; Religious people at the time, they listen, they could not do any more than what was allotted to them in the measure even in that time. But once the word came across their path, it brought something out of them. Much different with the woman at the well. She was one the condition she was in. Uh, I'm going to tell you, if you go by conditions, you would seem like, man, we want to associate with these guys. These are some good Orthodox guys, man. I mean to tell you, they're right on the money. You can't. They tithe on ants. They tithe on men. They do this. They do that. But her, on the other hand, my if I hang around her, I might get a reput. You know, her reputation might be like, man, what are you doing hanging around her? You never know. But Jesus, his reputation is made around that of taking sinners that which they're named. The prophet said it like this. The dogs wouldn't even howl their name. But you let the spirit of God come down and take a hold of that life, the spirit of God will so transform that life and his name will now be displayed through a trophy of his divine visitation. &gt;&gt; My goodness, what does that love? You see, the love of God does not leave you in your sin. &gt;&gt; The love of God don't do that. The love of God has provided for you and I what we have need of in order to become a fully manifested son and daughter of God. Not just title only, but an absolute fully manifested son and daughter of God. Of course, we realize we're still growing and growing in our lives. But notice, you believe, you become love and love is God. &gt;&gt; So, you're becoming like God. That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So God transforming your life was his spirit has come down and where his word where his so transformed your life you become love. Not just loving the spirit of God dealing with our lives, working with us, drawing us in repentance. We're made more lovable. Dealing with our lives, sanctification, made more lovable. But when the Holy Spirit has come, &gt;&gt; then you have become love, an absolute expression of God himself. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; And these other things, you don't have to quit doing them. They just quit themselves. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "It isn't it isn't you quitting anything. It's them quitting you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's just like, you know, there were people that, oh, they they all of a sudden, you know, they, you know, they wanted to hang around and oh, they wanted to call me and come out and continue to do this and do that. Eventually, after hearing enough of my testimony and just just letting them know, you know what? What happened to you? I said, you I don't know if you read your Bible or not. I said, but you know who I met? I met the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. They walked in when I was selling suits one night and wanted to laugh and giggle and cut up at me when I was fitting suits. And so after all that was done, you know, they were standing around. I said, "If you want to know what happened to me," then they would get, you know, other ones and there would be these young ladies that would come by. I said, "Let me just say say tell you, you know who I met? I met the Lord Jesus. I met the same one that Paul met on the road to." I said, "Do you ever read your Bible? I met the same one." Oh, I wasn't very many months in serving God. But I'll tell you just a little bit of that testimony right there and all of the things that was going on before. Give Browning a little bit. He'll be right back out in that. But there was a testimony. I wasn't just saying something, but there was a declaration. I knew from the desires from within my life. &gt;&gt; It had changed. I did not want that life any longer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What was happening? It wasn't me quitting my friends. They quit me. &gt;&gt; Now notice he says they just no desire to do it. The worshipper being purged has no more conscience or desire of sin. And when the worshipper is purged, when he is born again, when his old nature dies and a new nature sets in, then he's a part of God, a son of God, he gets new life. And that Greek word there is Zoe which means life of God. And you become an offspring of God. And God cannot hurt you without hurting himself. &gt;&gt; So what is it based on? It's believing. You don't stop believing. You continue to believe. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, I don't see this. Don't stop believing. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Because the rapture hasn't come yet. Don't stop believing. &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't seen this prayer. Don't stop believing. That's the time to believe. &gt;&gt; It's easy to believe when everything feels right, seems right, looks good. But when when even when you can't even see anything around you, you say, "What do I do?" Stand up on what he has revealed to you already. And don't give up one iota to the devil. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Don't give up one iota because then that's ground you got to go back and reclaim. &gt;&gt; It becomes futile of trying to go back like Israel did that time there under I think Omar or whatever more going into Hezbollah and they go in there five of a day and come back at night. How dumb was that? Y'all know what I'm talking about. You got to go back and retake the same positions all the time. &gt;&gt; Don't you realize that the devil is a liar? &gt;&gt; How do you know when he's lying? Every time he opens his mouth, &gt;&gt; stand on what God has done for you. And that is your confession that what he's done, he will finish the work in my life. regardless of my feelings, regardless of my thoughts, regardless of my circumstances. You know what that is that's coming out? That's love. Love to trust him. Even when you're standing before giants, you trust him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know what Caleb and Joshua became? Love. &gt;&gt; You know what the rest of them became? Freddy cats. &gt;&gt; Fear. What's the opposite of love? fear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; The whole thing was not based on whether they had their their abilities. Their ability was if God be for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a love for God to trust him. Even when the circumstances said, "Then we're greater than you." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God is greater than any circumstance of your flesh. &gt;&gt; He's greater than anything of your DNA and anything of your birth. The grace of God is greater. It's more greater and able to take care of every situation and God is more than willing to do that. What must I do? Believe him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if if that seems like a struggle, here's a scripture that is given for you and I that even that man that came before the Lord Jesus where his boy was in need of deliverance. Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I say we throw down pride. Right? &gt;&gt; You're not, Listen, in the Father's house. This is not a place to be intimidated. This is not a place where you've got to show off. This is not a place where you have to put something on. This is not a place where you have to pretend. Your father loves you. You say, "How do I know he loves me?" He came down and he made paid the price for you and he sent back the Holy Ghost. This message did not come across your pathway just by chance. Oh, brother Samuel, how many other people it did? I'm not talking about other people. I'm talking about you. You're the one that's here tonight. And you've got to have that kind of a faith that the word did not get delivered at the wrong address. The word was delivered to the right person. I am a part of this word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He is the apostle &gt;&gt; and high priest of your profession. &gt;&gt; That's so good. What you say he is, that's what he is. Oh, I don't know if I ever make it. &gt;&gt; That's not what he is. &gt;&gt; Well, I must not be. That's not what he is. &gt;&gt; Well, one of these days I'll be healed. That's not what he is. &gt;&gt; One of these days I'll be delivered. No, that's not what he is. &gt;&gt; I say tonight, we ought to just stand on that when the love of God pouring in so rich right here and say, "Devil, you're a liar. You're trying to take from me. You're trying to rob the privilege of a son and daughter of God. Right here, I have that possession right here as a son and daughter of God. Deliverance is mine. Salvation is mine. The Holy Ghost is mine. Healing is mine. &gt;&gt; When that word is drawing on your heart, lay hold on it. &gt;&gt; How God reveals himself to you, don't turn loose of it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Say, God, let my if there's something in my life that is not in the condition for that to be made manifest, then Lord God, remedy all things to where my life becomes a fit channel for that word to be made manifest through. &gt;&gt; That's how we handle the sons and daughters of God. Yes. So good. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, this is why the scripture can I I'll just I'm put it up here, but I'm going refer to it. This is why Paul said, "From henceforth, we know no man after the flesh." &gt;&gt; Now, Paul never knew Jesus in the flesh. That's right. &gt;&gt; Never did it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Paul saw him after his death, burial, &gt;&gt; and resurrection, &gt;&gt; and after the Holy Spirit. He'd already turned back to a pillar of fire. And what Paul received being the messenger of that age was greater because he was the prophet of that hour and it was given to that of the Gentiles. And notice how Paul would write this. There might have been those who walked around. Let me just say this to you. Do you know how many saw him ascend on Mount Olivan? You know how many saw him ascend? 500. That's what the Bible says in the book of Corinthians. 500 saw him. How many went in the upper room? 120. &gt;&gt; What happened to the 380? &gt;&gt; See, you got to be careful. Don't just gaze at the message. &gt;&gt; God don't want you to become enamored and gazing at the message. But remember, the message is all about getting underneath the blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; That's so &gt;&gt; Is that right? 120 went on up there in the upper room and they got the Holy Ghost. Y'all know what I'm talking about. It's in the Bible. The prophet deals with it as well. There's 120. That what had meaning of what this was all about. No doubt. And 380 of them walked away and said, "Wow, what a service." &gt;&gt; My goodness. Did you see how that there the space and the light just grew between his feet? And as But that was it. But 120 went on to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; They knew what that meant is the promises for me. &gt;&gt; That's my Passover. That's my sacrifice. You see, when this message is revealed to you, it's not revealing a man. It's not revealing doctrines. It's revealing the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. It is the revelation of Jesus Christ breaking forth upon your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We know no man after the flesh. We've known Christ after the flesh, but now we know him no more. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, and old things are passed away, and behold, all things are become new. Brother Ram goes into talking of this form and he talks about how you and I are can you and I are held apart by the physical body. Yet we're united in our hearts when we've received the Holy Spirit. It's actually Christ in you uniting with Christ in me. &gt;&gt; So it's it's it's God uniting himself together. Now, brother Brandon would say it in this way. Remember, I'm dealing with this on becoming love. He says, "When you think of it, really, we have never seen one another." Did you know that? We have never seen one another. You hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever's on the inside. So then when we talk to each other, we're really not talking to the body. It's the spirit inside. But the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside. Remember when Jesus spoke to those Pharisees, he said, "You're of your father, the devil." &gt;&gt; Who was he talking to? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not this. He was speaking to the spirit that was behind him. &gt;&gt; Right. He also told them, "You're full of dead men's bones." &gt;&gt; He also told them, "You shut up the key into the kingdom and you do it for everybody else." &gt;&gt; He here he was dealing with them. You all of those things. What was he dealing with? Outwardly. Outwardly, these men, the prophet said, you couldn't put a finger on their lives. Listen to me now. Brother Bram said, when it came to fruits of the spirit, nobody could outdo him. And he said, here was Jesus walking into the temple that day. And he began, like a couple Sundays ago, we went through that, he began to kick things over. He wasn't having a temper tantrum. We know that &gt;&gt; he found things in the temple that shouldn't be there. &gt;&gt; That that that that that really living for God is not a life of convenience. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not about what's convenient for me. &gt;&gt; But it's something that even that we in ourselves would have to labor over. They could go buy a lamb. But the prophet tells us in the study, he says that what it is instead of raising lambs, they could go buy one. If you don't have to raise that lamb, you don't have to feed it. You don't have to clean its pin. You don't have to look over it. You don't even have to keep up with it. Oh, it's sick. Oh, we got to watch this. We got to that. You know what that takes out of you? That takes something out of you. So, when you offer that lamb, you are offering a part of yourself. &gt;&gt; And when he came in the temple, he moved all of that out of there because they were going in and buying something instead of it being a part of them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God was expressing that's what he came to do. He did not send something that it wasn't a part of him. He came himself. &gt;&gt; He gave himself for you and I. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus is not a second person. &gt;&gt; It's the very God revealed. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "I've always held that he was the deity of God." &gt;&gt; And the message shalom. Therefore, when we speak to each other quickly, we can understand right away whether we are Christians or not because there's a fellowship &gt;&gt; in the spirit that we talk from. &gt;&gt; So, you see it vibrates one to another whether we are Christians or not. Therefore, we have never seen one another. Watch how he picks this up. Jesus, no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him. In other words, God was identified, the person of God was identified in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. So, he was the expressed image of God. You catch that. The person of God was identified in the body &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now remember like the prophet said it's two yet it's one because remember it's not the flesh was God yet the flesh was the flesh of God. &gt;&gt; The flesh was not God yet it was the flesh of God. &gt;&gt; You hearing me? Same for you. The flesh that I'm looking at, Congalles, that I know is Joshua, but the flesh is not Joshua, but Joshua is in that flesh. &gt;&gt; That's Joshua's flesh. This right here is not Samuel Browning, but this is the flesh of Samuel Browning. Samuel Browning is in the flesh. God was in Christ reconciling the world &gt;&gt; unto himself. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he has reconciled us unto himself. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Brother Bram says it like this in the message of rapture. He said, "I've always preached he was deity, not just a man. He was God manifested in the flesh." God, the attribute of God of love. The great attributes that come down display here on earth of God. Jesus was God's love which built a body that Jehovah himself lived in. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. What God was, he manifested through that body. That body had to die so he could wash the bride with his blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says it like this. The love of God is shed abroad. Where at? In our hearts, not our spirits, &gt;&gt; in our hearts. The love of God is spread, shed abroad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In our hearts by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit is not something different from God. &gt;&gt; It is God, &gt;&gt; right? These three are one. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's three that bear record right in heaven. The father, the word. That's the That's how it says it. The word, and the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And these three are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you've received the Holy Spirit, you have received your deposit of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then you having that life on the inside of you. How does the life travel? Through the body. &gt;&gt; And then what what are you bearing? You're bearing his name. &gt;&gt; Yes. There you go. &gt;&gt; You're bearing his life. As Jesus said, I've come in my father's name. So can you say by the word of God that's been revealed to you and in your life and through your life, I have come in my father's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just give you just a few more scriptures. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; It's going to be so long since ne till next Thursday and I'm already ahead of this for next Thursday. But notice in 1 John 5:1, whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Once again, a person could say, "I believe he's the Christ." &gt;&gt; So, I'm born of God. &gt;&gt; But remember, he's the anointed word when we're expressing that. &gt;&gt; He is born of God. Born again. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, you can't say we're born again and we're still doing the things of the world. You understand what I mean? God God works things out of a person's life. takes takes the desire the very nature of the life and then God continues to move through our life and give us overcoming grace through every every little obstacle in our life because when God gave you the Holy Ghost he didn't take the giants out of your land he didn't he didn't demolish Jericho he didn't take care of AI he said I've equipped you &gt;&gt; and now you go into the land and you tear down every one of their posters that's what it says in Deuteronomy you tear down every one of their idols in other words the things that's been troubling and has been there of a trouble or what becomes to be known to you as an area of trouble of where that in your life you experience defeat. Learn from it and tear those things down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Well, I know I know brother Joshua and he's it ain't about brother Joshua." It's about things that when you see that are a snare. It's like this. You could take a person, but here it is. I know different brothers and my goodness, you talking about being wonderful fishermen. Not here, but I mean there is wonderful fishermanmen here. You understand? In other places, man, they were part of bass tournaments and everything else. They lived for all of that. But when God got a hold of their life, the Holy Spirit took a hold of their life. And just little by little by little by little, you know what? Their pastor never had to tell them, "Go sell that prize bass boat you've got." &gt;&gt; You know what happened? The more they believed, feeding on the word, they became love. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't them quitting and selling the bass boat. Eventually, it just it come to that place. This is crowding in on my time with Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; You see, that's part of the redeeming work and becoming love. You begin to recognize that. I don't want anything crowding in on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this. And everyone that loveth him that begget, loveth him also that is begotten of him. Remember, bride won't persecute bride. &gt;&gt; Bride won't tear down bride, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's not a characteristic of the bride. Oh, you bunch of dead people. That's not characteristic. &gt;&gt; That might come out, but if that's a son and daughter of God, they ain't saying they couldn't get in that way. Maybe their background maybe where things coming up. God will correct his children because God will not allow one of his children to talk about another one of his other children. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Sure, we got to hold the standard of the word, but there's a way to hold the standard of the word because the word is Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't have to tear down our brother. We don't have to diminish this. Just preach the word. And you preach the word. And you know what? The people are drawn to the word and they receive discernment &gt;&gt; instead of somebody instead of somebody else's word. Oh, that's a dead church. Or this is a dead. Oh, I got to go to so and what so and so says, "No man is my absolute." &gt;&gt; I don't care how many miracles. I don't care what they've had. No man is my absolute. &gt;&gt; But the word of God is my absolute. &gt;&gt; Is that your absolute? &gt;&gt; And when I'm talking about the word of God, I'm talking of this and the message &gt;&gt; because that is the word of God. &gt;&gt; You take the message away from this, we're left. &gt;&gt; But when the message has come, what does the message do? It brings forth the living word of God. It's where this was being sold on the auctioneers's table. Oh, we don't need to do that. Oh, we went nothing. Nobody was even bidding on it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But God come down in this generation. It wasn't a man with a seventh grade education. It was God who walked up in the shoes of William Brandham and picked up this word and begin to play Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And what everybody else said, well, you know, well, it don't matter too much and we just go this and you just believe Jesus and you don't got to worry about the Holy Ghost and you don't got to worry about all that stuff anymore. But God came down in this hour. You know why? cuz he had some eagles, some predestinated children of God, and what they needed to hear was a new song. &gt;&gt; They needed to hear the song played by the spirit of God from the chords of God's predestinated promises of his word in this hour. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel good. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God. By this, we know that we love the children of God. Let's stand. We'll just have to start here. So, we can't say I don't know. Remember, God has all kinds in his body, &gt;&gt; right? And just because they're not like me or they're not like you, don't make them odd. &gt;&gt; Don't make them not a part of the body. It's like in trying to somehow, let's just say, worship being so attacked as Ben. So attacked and trying to categorize things. And yet I think even when I was over in Ghana I was done preaching in that convention each of the services. First one I went I can't remember how many services I preached. I might have been only three and then I preach other places. The next time I went I preached seven. But every time the space from here to the first pew was about where Andrea is sitting. You know what took place and they just didn't work it up. They were so happy with the word. While the word was being preached, they were running up there. I thought they was going to take my place. Let me tell you something. When the word had so struck their heart afterwards, they got out there and were dancing. What'd you do? Got right out there with them. I might have been the only white boy among them. I was tell you the truth. Brother Jeff Snograss is supposed to go with me. Why? I mean we what what we we have a right to. But you see what have we tried to count? Well, you don't need to do that or this or that. It's just like every church is sovereign. &gt;&gt; This is why that what we need is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; God knows just what he's doing even in every locality and everything. You know what? God don't need us worrying about somebody else and this and that. You know what? You know what brother Bram called it when he got to criticizing people? Brother Bram called it word made flesh India trip a selfish spirit rising up in me. &gt;&gt; He said I'm not the one to go around and correct everybody and tell everybody that they're wrong. And yet in one way as the prophet of the hour &gt;&gt; he did have that authority. But you see one thing the prophet of God would show us in the openness of his life. I'm not highlighting him. I'm just trying to show you how God showed this openness to where that even in that right there, even though he might have had that authority, but yet the prophet would always deal with what's the motive &gt;&gt; and objective &gt;&gt; behind it. Just like we might have certain rights and we might have certain positions, we might have certain things, but what is our motive and our objective behind it? That's why you find remember when the prophet talked about he was corrected for calling them Ricky's and Ricettas right standing in the gap. The prophet said, "God let me to know that some of them are his children." &gt;&gt; And he said it like this. If they want to serve God if they only knew how. &gt;&gt; So is that the last time he said Ricky and Ricketta? No. After that he'd say it again. You know what the difference was? Motive. &gt;&gt; Right. where it was coming from. That's where the Holy Spirit's so reigning in our lives. That's what we want. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just be lovely. I I think that's wonderful, friends. I think it'd be my goodness, how wonderful, lovely. That was wonderful. But what we what God has called us to be is to become love. &gt;&gt; How many remember the quote? Pick up your pen and write. As she nears that capstone, she will be so much like him till she will be him. &gt;&gt; What is that capstone? Is that capstone faith? What is that capstone? Love. And who is it that's actually operating? The prophet tells us in statue of a perfect man that's actually operating all these virtues all the way down through. It's the head. It's the capstone. Because we're not being drawn downward. We're being drawn upward, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit has come into our life, he has sealed our lives. And then we begin to grow. He has the seal of the living God. You say, "Brother Sam, I thought that seal was up there on the capstone." It is. And yet, he sealed you. And yet, you're growing into a full &gt;&gt; stature. Your faith is growing. virtue is growing. Your patience is growing. Oh, that's why I love some of the last statements brother Brandham makes in Statue of a Perfect Man. He says, "You can't even get anywhere with this unless you're first born again." &gt;&gt; And then he stands there at the very last, I think it's paragraph 432 or something like that. He says, "Oh, with my hands up before this congregation, let me not cease, God, if I don't maintain my home, if I don't maintain this, if I don't maintain that, but let me maintain Christ, Lord God. Let me not cease until I see these virtues &gt;&gt; flowing freely through my life." Yes. &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham was a sealed son of God, but he realized we're growing in the stature &gt;&gt; of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; And when that capstone sets down in reality at the coming of the Lord, the rapture comes &gt;&gt; and it will pull all the way up. All that is started on that first base right there with faith, that first age, it'll pull all of them. The prophet said there'll be there'll be that or the dynamics will come into the church that will absolutely draw them out of the grave. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the head uniting with the body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And yet we realize right now we're not walking headless. We're walking under the headship of the word. And what is the headship of the word come to do? It's come to lead us home. &gt;&gt; How can you expect? How could we expect to be more like him if he didn't reveal more of himself? So then the rapture will be the same way as it was with Abel's sacrifice. God will finally look and say, "That's it. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's it." What does he sing himself? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will present to himself, &gt;&gt; a bride, &gt;&gt; glorious, spotless, &gt;&gt; without any wrinkle, any blemish, or any such thing. &gt;&gt; No imperfections. What's done that? His love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives &gt;&gt; even as Christ so loved the church that he gave himself for it to sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present unto himself a glorious church. So what are we the product of? His love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What his love has called for. I say, 'Lord, I want to become love. &gt;&gt; I thank God for what he's done in my life. And maybe that's for you tonight. You would say, you know what? That's that's what I want. I want to become love. Maybe I want that. I want that of the love of God, the Holy Spirit. Lord, I want to be that the expression that that of your word. I want Lord that seal in my life. Then you know it all starts with Lord remedy anything that's unlike you. &gt;&gt; Just be honest with him. Remedy anything because you know what? Those things anything that is allowed to linger will hinder your approach. Just allow God to remedy everything to his word. Then God begins to move in and he'll move into that place. And then as God has moved into that place as believers, we're gathered here tonight. No doubt many filled with the spirit of God already, but yet we're still becoming love. He's changed our lives, but yet we're becoming more and more like him &gt;&gt; through tests, through situations, through things that come our way, becoming more like him. This is why Paul would write over and over to the believers that your love would abound, grow greater. Come to full, this is what the word means. We'll get to it. Come to full maturity. &gt;&gt; His love is to be perfected in us. &gt;&gt; Come to its completion. &gt;&gt; I say yes, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you Can you sense that drawing upon your life, Lord? &gt;&gt; He's drawing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you love him, friends? &gt;&gt; Don't you appreciate his goodness? &gt;&gt; My Where would we be without him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're here tonight because of him. &gt;&gt; Right. We're here tonight because of him. Like brother Bram made the statement over and over. Brother Brand make this in the message. Oh, brother B, I don't know about me. I don't know. Brother Brand said, "Wait a minute. You're here tonight, aren't you? What do you think brought you here to church tonight? &gt;&gt; You said it was God. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes it's the little things that we overlook. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just, you know, I just it just was an idea that popped in my head. You know, ideas are not just ideas. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thoughts are not just thoughts. They're spirits. &gt;&gt; That's why when you entertain certain thoughts, you'll feel a certain way. start entertaining thoughts of the word. And the prophet says as you begin to just think upon his word and meditate on it, he said pretty soon he said you'll feel this go over. He said, you know what that is? That's evidence of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; His presence sweeping over you. &gt;&gt; Thoughts are not just something that's just, oh, it's nothing. It's spirits. But neither is the devil. Like some say, oh, the devil's just a thought. He's not a thought, but he gives thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember, he's got a bow with no arrow. &gt;&gt; He can shoot a lot of wind. &gt;&gt; He can shoot a lot. But God also, you don't have a bow. He has a sword. And where does that sword come? From his mouth. &gt;&gt; From his mouth. Hallelujah. That's all my I love how the prophet said, he said, you'll notice he said he never spoke of you being in his mouth. He said, 'You in his hand. &gt;&gt; He said, because it's that lukewarm church that he spurts out of his mouth. He said he never spoke of the church in his mouth. He speaks of the church in his hand. &gt;&gt; And you know what? We're in his hand and living by the word. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, you're so mindful, Lord, of our needs. And I know here tonight, Lord, no doubt what's here of your children, those of us, Lord God, that are able to gather here tonight. Others, Lord, that would desire to be here. You know each one, Lord, that's here a part and a part of this assembly, Lord. Others that would stream it. But I pray that Lord as you know our needs Lord I pray Lord Jesus may you move down Lord I pray as you have here tonight and if there's a heart Lord that is just looking and longing just longing for more of you Lord I there's things that I still see in my life it hinders but I believe you are not only able, I believe you're willing to take, Lord God, every desire out of my life. Let me become love. &gt;&gt; Let more of the same Holy Spirit that has drawn me continue to work on my life. Continue to work in me, Lord. Remedy everything of my life that Lord God, I want to be a fit sanctuary. I want to be put in service, but I know to be put in service, it takes you to met make me a fit tabernacle. For when your presence came down there in Moses' time, Solomon's time, when your presence came down after the sacrifices were offered, that was you declaring the finished work. The tabernacle was not finished when it was left empty. But the tabernacle was deemed finished when you stepped inside, Lord. Although as you step inside of our lives in a finished work of Calvary and true when Lord God that old nature has passed away, &gt;&gt; all things have become new and from that finished work in our life is a new creation. And behold, all things are new, Lord God, as we'll continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, growing up unto you in all things. Help us, Lord. Father, &gt;&gt; I believe right here tonight, Lord, when not only there's not only trophies that's here, I believe I'm one of them that have become love to that place, Lord, of where our lives have been sealed. And yet, we know that you're still working on us, Lord. that it's not something that is going to come from the outside in, but it's actually that part of a son and daughter of God on the inside that actually grows more and more in your image because this flesh is not Samuel Browning, but this is the flesh of Samuel Browning. Lord Jesus, I pray that Lord that you would do the work Lord for every heart and for each one of us. Lord, may you bring each one Lord to where we need to be. May you Lord God, I pray continue Lord just to Lord God drawing upon our lives and help us Lord most of all help us not to lean to our own understanding but help us to lean upon you Lord forgive us Lord God of our shortcomings Lord as you stand in view as you come in view my all that we can see Lord we see our littleness we see our need of You your prophet has told us that we must master the thought of human ability. And Lord, how at times that you help us with such divine grace to show us the need and that mastering of human human ability is to recognize we can do nothing &gt;&gt; of ourselves. But it's as we'll yield to you, Lord. Some some of us, Lord, well, I I'll say all of us, Lord God, how so many times would like to just say, "Oh, this weakness, this weakness." But Lord God, may we submit that weakness to you. &gt;&gt; Because those weaknesses are opportunities when they're surrendered to you for you to pour yourself into, and you'll use yourself. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. If there's one place we don't need to be ashamed as it was, but we need Lord God to be open, it's in your presence. Even Lord God, conviction itself. Sure. And there's things that we can feel shame, but there's a place, Lord God, there's a blood that's already been shed that can not only take care of the guilt, but it can take care of reasons as well, too. Lord, I pray tonight, Lord God, may you take each and every one of us, Lord, by the hand. &gt;&gt; Lead us, Lord, I pray, Lord, in this hour that our lives be that expression as your prophet said, as we believe, we become love. Help us, Lord. May we become love more and more and more. How long? Well, either until you say it's time to come home. Whether it's by the way of the grave or in the rapture, we know that Lord, you'll never let character be overripened. But when it gets to that place, it's like a flower that's come to perfection. and you pluck it out of the field and you take it, it's come to its place of perfection. Oh God, help us. Help us each and every one, Lord. Lord God, if there's one thing I want, I want more of you, Lord. Less of me, Lord. Lord, help me to die. Give me the grace to die more to Samuel. Lord God, not only me, but show every one of us, Lord God. &gt;&gt; It's really not something, Lord, of a great mystery. It's not something that's Lord hidden, but it's actually daily in our lives. Help us. Help us, Lord. Help us to live so close to you. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless your children, Lord, for every need that's here tonight. We place the name of Jesus Christ above every need, every request for the glory of God. Amen. And amen. Amen. Go ahead. Lead us in the course if you don't mind. Oh, we have had enough of getting everything we want. But we are weary of living this life just for us. [Music] And oh, forgive us all for seeking your hand and not your face.

Even though, Lord, it might have been things that maybe we wanted or maybe somewhere to go or this or that, but God, we value your will more than we value our wants. Thank you, Lord God, for your mercy, Lord Jesus. We are what we are by the grace of God. It's because of you, Lord. Lord God, we didn't even have the right kind of love to love you, but you first loved us. &gt;&gt; You made a deposit of your own love, of your own life. So, it's actually not us, but it's you through us loving right back. We're a reflection, Lord. We're a reflection. The church is not the sun. We're a moon. We're a reflection to shine the light in the absence. Lord God, grant it. Lord, may our lives, Lord, as we go among our families, go among different ones in the workplace, may it really shine the real true love of God. Oh God, that Lord Jesus, your love, your care, Lord, to become one of us.
