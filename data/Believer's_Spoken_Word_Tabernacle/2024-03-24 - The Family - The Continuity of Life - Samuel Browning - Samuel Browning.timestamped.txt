[37:10] be here this morning and uh so looking
[37:13] forward to What the Lord Has for us
[37:15] throughout the day and uh just so
[37:19] enjoyed the song service here
[37:22] and
[37:24] singing what a what an atmosphere to
[37:27] walk into
[37:28] to amen so we want to just turn our
[37:32] attention here just to the Lord in
[37:35] prayer as we go in prayer this morning
[37:38] uh I know there were different requests
[37:40] that were made known and mentioned and
[37:43] uh yesterday as I was on my way uh to
[37:46] the office here um I got a call and my
[37:50] aunt Linda or sister Linda cavillo she
[37:54] they had to take her by Squad the
[37:56] previous night night on Friday night
[37:59] early Saturday morning so when I went
[38:01] over to just went straight there to
[38:04] University to see her before coming back
[38:06] here and um she had pneumonia there in
[38:11] her lungs and then also an infection in
[38:13] her body and you know sometimes with
[38:15] some of the infections those of you that
[38:17] are in the medical field sometimes it
[38:18] can those infections can um leave
[38:21] someone to where they they have kind of
[38:23] like a blank and uh they you know
[38:26] sometimes they don't everything's pretty
[38:28] short and quick and yes and yes and no
[38:30] and yes and no so we just begin to pray
[38:33] and um as we begin to pray just the
[38:35] presence of the Lord just drawing near
[38:37] and she began to enter in there and then
[38:40] after we were done
[38:41] praying you know it was kind of back to
[38:43] the same responses but um we just let
[38:47] her just rest and I just ask that you'd
[38:49] remember her in prayer there's many
[38:51] needs brother Brian mentioned it and
[38:53] brother Alex when he was praying there
[38:55] are many there's no doubt others that
[38:57] maybe if if that need if someone
[38:59] streaming and your name was not read
[39:01] across let me just say right now we're
[39:03] going to lift it up before the god the
[39:05] Throne of God because every need is
[39:08] certainly there's many needs throughout
[39:09] the body amen needs that we need really
[39:12] a Divine Touch and my my aunt has really
[39:14] battled with that you know of the lung
[39:16] since she had a double lung transplant
[39:19] and she's really battled with that and
[39:21] um and we just uh know that God's in
[39:25] control I don't know how God's going to
[39:27] do everything but I know God's in
[39:30] control and I know that God can take
[39:32] those lungs and make them as though
[39:35] they're her
[39:36] own you know I I look at it and I I was
[39:39] just thinking about it as I was on my
[39:40] way to that hospital yesterday I said
[39:42] Lord you gave brother Ron Spencer a
[39:44] complete new set of lungs after that
[39:46] fire even where some thought well this
[39:49] cancer came from scars on their lungs no
[39:52] there was no scars on those lungs God
[39:55] gave a complete set amen now I look to
[39:58] God to do that you know God does things
[40:00] in his own way but he proves and he
[40:02] shows that he's God and it's all the
[40:05] supernatural it's all Supernatural
[40:08] because it God all healing comes from
[40:10] him so we just want to take not only
[40:13] that request but every other need
[40:15] there's many that are not here sick and
[40:19] I know we even had to cancel an event
[40:20] there on Friday evening where at our
[40:23] home my wife and others were getting
[40:25] together the uh young sisters so I know
[40:29] there's sickness Among Us in the body
[40:31] but let's just go to God In
[40:34] Prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we are
[40:37] are so thankful Lord for your mercies
[40:40] once again Lord father as our brother
[40:43] Alexander stood here Lord and prayer was

[40:54] here and those that are streaming Lord
[40:57] others in situations like that of the
[40:59] hospital Lord where sister Linda is

[41:28] are dealing Lord with sickness Lord and
[41:32] circumstances Lord that father have
[41:34] seemed to be Lord of a setback but Lord
[41:37] you are still almighty God so Lord above
[41:41] every one of these situations we take
[41:43] every need as that was already prayed
[41:45] over and placed here Lord and above it

[41:51] Christ for you're the almighty God the
[41:53] creator of heavens and earth and Lord

[42:05] special way God May the same Angel of
[42:08] the Lord just brood Lord over her body

[44:08] also I I seen uh brother Josh and sister
[44:11] amariah we were pulling in and uh most
[44:14] of you know where I thought about when I
[44:16] seen uh sister amariah uh here and uh
[44:20] just how the Lord brought her through
[44:22] that uh accident that she had been
[44:24] through and uh that was just about a
[44:26] little bit over a month ago and how that
[44:29] God is so merciful and so I we're so
[44:31] thankful for that and just ask you would
[44:33] just continue to keep her in prayer as
[44:35] well uh some of you that's been through
[44:37] something like that you know sometimes
[44:39] there can be a you know sometimes just
[44:41] things sometimes can kind of linger a
[44:43] little bit but just ask that God will
[44:45] continue to minister Amen to her as well
[44:48] amen and just continue to strengthen her
[44:50] so we're so thankful to have her and uh
[44:53] brother Josh here with us and uh of
[44:55] course I here brother Alexander here and
[44:58] uh and he and sister Marie and the
[45:01] family my well you all are
[45:05] home and we're just so glad to have them
[45:07] here with us and uh my brother Alex has

[45:25] Lord oh my but uh we certainly love them
[45:28] and so appreciate brother Alex has has
[45:30] just been so gracious to stand in here
[45:33] many times and uh you know he's I know
[45:36] one thing we we've been benefited each
[45:38] time amen we so appreciate the ministry
[45:41] amen of our brother and I know he's just
[45:42] got back from Honduras here he's been
[45:44] back for maybe a little month and a half
[45:46] or so and so um we also want to remind
[45:49] you as we prepare to turn to the word in
[45:52] Deuteronomy chapter 6 I want to remind
[45:54] you of the youth meeting this evening at
[45:56] 5:30 brother Paul uh will be coming in
[45:59] for that brother Paul Le Fontaine so
[46:00] we're certainly looking forward to that
[46:03] amen this this this
[46:09] afternoon and I certainly just ask just
[46:12] really covet your prayers here this
[46:13] morning that the Lord would just help us
[46:16] I want to speak here I want to just take
[46:19] a a moment here I had taken two services
[46:22] in January on the family and I want to I
[46:25] told you then I wanted to just stick
[46:27] with just doing a service a month on the
[46:29] family and so I just had this has been
[46:32] on my heart for some time and I want to
[46:34] speak on this and I believe it will very
[46:36] much will speak even and tie into that
[46:38] of the
[46:40] Resurrection as well in Deuteronomy
[46:43] chapter 6 and verse 6 and these words
[46:46] which I command thee this day shall be
[46:49] in thine heart I want you to notice the
[46:52] the priority the words that I speak
[46:54] shall be in thine heart that's first and
[46:58] thou shalt teach them that's second
[47:01] diligently unto thy children and shalt
[47:04] talk of them when thou sest in thine
[47:07] house and when thou west by the way and
[47:11] when thou liest down and when thou
[47:14] risest up so if the Lord will help us
[47:17] I'd like to just speak on that thought
[47:19] on the continuity of Life continuity of
[47:22] life may God bless you bless the reading
[47:24] of the word as you're being seated when
[47:27] we think of this in terms and looking at
[47:30] that of um of continuity and probably
[47:33] this morning I can probably safely say
[47:37] that the first part of that where we
[47:39] read for a text is where I'll really be
[47:41] uh dealing with here this morning is in
[47:44] that of the words that I would command
[47:47] you this is what's to be in your heart
[47:50] and um when we think of that of the
[47:53] continuity it's that which is something
[47:56] to to be unbroken and consistent
[47:59] existence or operation of something over
[48:03] a period of time it's also a state of
[48:06] stability and the absence of
[48:09] disruption and uh I think if there's one
[48:12] thing for sure that we could see we look
[48:14] even across in that of the world there
[48:17] is no
[48:19] continuity there in the world at all and
[48:22] I'm going to say this here if you take
[48:26] Christ from our midst there's no
[48:28] continuity Among
[48:31] Us he's the key he's the key that's the
[48:36] key to the door that's the key to
[48:39] everything it's his life he is the
[48:41] continuity to all things this is why
[48:45] that when you think of how that God
[48:47] would set this in even in the book of
[48:49] Exodus of how that when it was to be a
[48:52] new beginning for them and how that God
[48:54] would take of and address them when it
[48:57] came time to be delivered from that of
[49:01] Egypt God made a promise and when God
[49:03] makes a promise it's up to God to keep
[49:05] that promise and God's the one that has
[49:08] to step on the scene he doesn't entrust
[49:10] his word to anyone else to fulfill it
[49:13] but God fulfills his word by himself now
[49:17] he'll use vessels he's always used man
[49:19] but it's not the man that's doing it
[49:22] it's God operating through the man so
[49:25] that it'll always be a continuity God
[49:28] never breaks continuity the scripture
[49:31] says in Malachi I'm God and I change not
[49:36] right he's the same yesterday today and
[49:39] forever yes sir he's immun he's he's
[49:42] immutable in his ways I means
[49:44] unchangeable he's in that and he's
[49:46] immutable in his nature this is why that
[49:50] where Satan himself knows that the real
[49:54] true continuity of of God's own life and
[49:57] the True Church of the Living God is
[50:00] that of Mark 16 which is his church with
[50:05] his life in it carrying out what he
[50:09] began and so when you think of like it's
[50:11] just like your Bible our Bible is
[50:13] separated in Old Testament and New
[50:16] Testament it's groom and bride and that
[50:19] coming together is complete and so been
[50:22] yet the new never took away never did
[50:25] away with the old but the new is the
[50:27] Fulfillment of that of the old is that
[50:30] right it's the continuity so you know as
[50:33] much and sometimes uh you know men and
[50:36] and they can't help it they're inspired
[50:38] and directed that way to and they'll
[50:40] spend their lifetimes to try to disprove
[50:43] and try to you know look at and how this
[50:46] is this doesn't fit here and this
[50:47] doesn't fit here and I think if my
[50:49] memory serves me correctly there was a
[50:51] man that just they wanted to disprove
[50:53] the Bible so bad and with things and
[50:56] there's been many but you know they
[50:58] wanted to just stand upon that of King
[51:00] David and then here after 60 some years
[51:02] of their life they find an artifact that
[51:05] declares that indeed there was a David a
[51:07] King David on
[51:09] Earth I I don't know what really became
[51:12] of that man but I I would trust in my
[51:15] heart that at that time after all those
[51:17] years of trying to disprove something I
[51:19] would trust that it would take the mercy
[51:21] of God and say Lord forgive me I've been
[51:23] wrong I that's what I trust at that
[51:26] that's what took place but I realize
[51:29] that within it all that it's just a
[51:31] privilege to be a believer it's it's a
[51:34] real privilege that God himself because
[51:36] to believe is not something that
[51:38] altogether that we have done on our own
[51:41] but God has given us Grace to believe
[51:44] it's because he's graced us with his
[51:46] presence true there must be something on
[51:49] the inside to respond but if you don't
[51:52] have him pulling on that part of himself
[51:54] then how can you respond so the seed can
[51:57] only respond to to the author and from
[52:00] where it come from so this is why that
[52:02] we must have him the quickening power
[52:05] that life right among us moving and
[52:08] doing and Performing the same as he's
[52:11] always done and so when we think of this
[52:14] in Exodus 12 it's like that of a family
[52:17] where how that God would say it's it's a
[52:20] time of taking the lamb and killing the
[52:22] lamb and you know putting the the lamb
[52:25] over the the the door post they had to
[52:27] put it all over the doorpost and they
[52:29] never put it on the threshold because
[52:31] you're never to walk over the blood
[52:34] you're to walk under the
[52:37] blood and and they inside of that house
[52:40] would take that lamb and they would eat
[52:43] that lamb they would roast it and they
[52:45] would eat it with bitter herbs they
[52:48] would eat and all of those things have a
[52:49] part but you see it was regarded as
[52:52] though there was one lamb that was slain
[52:54] for all of Israel yet for all of the
[52:56] families being that it was a type it
[52:59] would require as God said let every man
[53:02] take a lamb to his house according to
[53:05] the number of his
[53:06] children my I feel like preaching and
[53:09] this is where I'm going anyhow but you
[53:11] see God didn't say just take it for you
[53:13] but he said I want you to count your
[53:15] children and however many children there
[53:18] are I want you to make sure that there's
[53:20] enough lamb to go around for every one
[53:23] of them what are you saying brother
[53:25] Samuel I don't care where they're at
[53:27] right now you have taken this Lamb with
[53:30] them in mind there is enough lamb to go
[53:34] around let me tell you something there's
[53:37] enough Holy Ghost there's enough power
[53:39] there's enough Deliverance to break
[53:42] chains and bondage in
[53:45] lives Hallelujah just because he healed
[53:48] one he's not diminished one
[53:55] iot
[53:57] Hallelujah so there's nothing that'll
[54:00] bring continuity like the Holy Ghost
[54:03] that's the beginning of continuity of
[54:05] our life you know we could all we could
[54:07] sit down uh you know let me just take my
[54:09] buddy here for a minute brother Alex if
[54:11] we sit down I now I'm going to say
[54:13] probably most of the time that we would
[54:15] we will agree I mean uh you know there's
[54:18] a lot of things that we can Fellowship I
[54:19] know where he stands on this message and
[54:21] I love that I I appreciate his stand so
[54:24] I don't worry about it when I the
[54:25] ministry have come in here I'm not
[54:27] having somebody in that I
[54:29] question right if you question the
[54:32] message then I don't I don't want to I I
[54:34] don't have a question about the message
[54:36] I I I I want somebody that that knows
[54:39] that they have met God the God of this
[54:42] word now when we sat down and we
[54:45] Fellowship you know there might be some
[54:47] things you know here or there that maybe
[54:49] brother Alex say well I you know I'm
[54:51] kind of seeing this this way and kind of
[54:53] seeing this this way and maybe I would
[54:55] say this you know like for example H
[54:57] what kind of pie you like I like oh I
[55:00] knew you was going to give me some of
[55:01] that
[55:02] man I knew you was going to say that I
[55:05] like Apple you all right man you all
[55:10] right supposed like Cherry hey man I
[55:12] love
[55:13] Apple I love it
[55:16] all but you see the my my my I'll pick a
[55:21] different
[55:24] example but you see you know know
[55:26] there's differences that that we might
[55:28] have and you know he might you know like
[55:31] uh you know this kind of pie and this
[55:32] one like this kind of pie and there's
[55:34] sometimes there's things that you know
[55:36] maybe this one would see this a little
[55:38] bit and see this a little different and
[55:40] you know maybe some people have the the
[55:41] penny March when it comes in their
[55:43] Church to birthday times like they had
[55:45] in brandom Tabernacle and and maybe some
[55:47] people don't do it you see some of those
[55:49] things we can look at and say well I
[55:51] don't see uh continuity necessarily
[55:53] within that but what's important is is
[55:55] that we have continuity in his life if
[55:59] we have the continuity of his life he
[56:02] will lead us and guide us into all truth
[56:06] you see sometimes we're trying to hammer
[56:08] out all the specifics and we got to get
[56:11] everybody believing the same way and we
[56:13] got listen that they been trying to do
[56:15] that the Crusaders and everybody else
[56:18] there's only one way to get everybody
[56:21] believing the same way and that's for
[56:24] God himself to have a a personal meeting
[56:28] with
[56:30] you Hallelujah because when we're in
[56:33] love with him then even though we might
[56:35] disagree with one another but we've
[56:37] still got love for one another because
[56:40] that's my brother that's my
[56:43] sister is that all right now so it
[56:47] matters first of all it's about
[56:49] individuals being lined up when
[56:52] individual is lined up with God in
[56:54] harmony with God in a continu ity of
[56:56] life then it can come down from
[56:59] Individual then it moves the husband
[57:02] wife and then through the family which
[57:04] brings us back to our text first let
[57:07] these words be in thine heart sir then
[57:12] teach them right is that right and some
[57:15] of the ways remember uh the ways that we
[57:18] teach is not altogether Always by words
[57:21] is the greatest teacher is example amen
[57:24] a lifel lived this is why the prophet
[57:26] would tell us in this manner and say
[57:28] that the message of the hour is not only
[57:31] to be the flame or the light of the hour
[57:36] but it is to be the flame and the light
[57:38] inside of our hearts this is why that
[57:41] through the message of the token and he
[57:44] would preach that message multiple times
[57:47] and when he preached that message I want
[57:49] you to understand now that listen the
[57:51] message of the hour if you just stop and
[57:53] look at the titles of this you might say
[57:55] brother Samuel I think you're making too
[57:57] much well I'm I'm sorry you feel that
[57:59] way but to me the titles are an
[58:02] announcement that when we look at that
[58:04] of the token the prophet had been
[58:06] laboring and moved before God he had had
[58:10] a burden for the Church of the Living
[58:12] God and there there was a need to bring
[58:16] stability in lives and a confidence I
[58:19] mean you can't do nothing when you do it
[58:21] work at your job if you're the least
[58:23] little bit unconfident in what you're
[58:25] doing you better not step behind that
[58:27] machine cuz you're sure the world your
[58:29] fingers might be coming off you've got
[58:31] to be confident in what you're doing
[58:34] this is why sometimes you know that when
[58:36] somebody explains something to you this
[58:38] is just me I want to re I want to
[58:40] refresh it back to you is this is what
[58:42] you're saying I want to State it back to
[58:44] you because I like my fingers I I I like
[58:46] certain things and you see God makes his
[58:49] word so plain before you and I and this
[58:53] is why when it comes down to that of the
[58:55] token let me be very simple with it
[58:57] we're talking about God's own life we're
[59:00] talking about the Holy Spirit we're
[59:03] talking about the reason that God
[59:05] himself stepped down from glory and
[59:09] became one of us because not only that
[59:11] he would understand us but that he might
[59:14] pay the price and as a redeemer I hope
[59:17] you're hearing me this morning as a
[59:20] redeemer it must be somebody number one
[59:23] who's able to do it and second of all
[59:25] that must be willing to do
[59:28] it let me tell you your Kinsman and My
[59:32] Kinsman is not only able to do it he was
[59:35] willing to do
[59:38] it he didn't just do it for one person
[59:41] remember he made the purchase he did it
[59:44] once and for all for everyone of his
[59:48] redeemable children
[59:50] amen glory be to God I tell you there is
[59:54] sufficient power in in the offering of
[59:56] that sacrifice amen amen and the life
[59:59] that came from that back into the
[1:00:01] worshipper this is why that even the
[1:00:04] prophet would say in that of the message
[1:00:06] token when he's talking about applying
[1:00:09] it you know and he's talking about
[1:00:10] getting the trash out of your house and
[1:00:12] other things like that as he's going
[1:00:14] through that one of the most important
[1:00:16] things that he says as he says you
[1:00:18] believe it you apply it and let your
[1:00:22] loved ones see it in you and it'll take
[1:00:26] effect amen so it isn't altogether what
[1:00:30] we say or what we'll do but it is the
[1:00:33] life inside of us that takes an effect
[1:00:37] on somebody else I don't know about you
[1:00:39] but when I come in contact with another
[1:00:41] individual I I I'll just say it like
[1:00:44] this that maybe they're not ordained to
[1:00:46] walk in the light that God has given to
[1:00:48] you and I but I pray that the light that
[1:00:51] burns in my heart under the message of
[1:00:54] the hour would challenge somebody if
[1:00:56] they're a Baptist if they're a
[1:00:57] Pentecostal whatever their allotment is
[1:01:00] that it would challenge them to live to
[1:01:03] the fullness of the light that God has
[1:01:05] called them to live in are you hearing
[1:01:08] me that's the that's the kind of people
[1:01:10] we want to be is hearts and lives that
[1:01:12] are challenging and encouraging one
[1:01:15] another amen hallelujah let it take
[1:01:18] effect pray about it be in prayer be in
[1:01:21] consideration and with such love you
[1:01:23] know what love does when you're in the
[1:01:25] presence of God and I I will just say
[1:01:26] this we need a continual refilling of
[1:01:30] the love of God you know when when
[1:01:32] you're under his presence I tell you
[1:01:34] what as you come out of that after
[1:01:36] refilling it doesn't matter what's been
[1:01:38] going on it don't matter who said what
[1:01:41] it doesn't matter what it is that you've
[1:01:42] heard but there is a strength within you
[1:01:46] that won't allow things to stick in your
[1:01:49] life but in other words because you have
[1:01:53] received another refilling of the pass
[1:01:56] that you are under then you have the
[1:01:59] strength to give a pass to one
[1:02:01] another woo my my and you then operate
[1:02:06] like a redeemer then when you go and
[1:02:09] talk to that loved one you talk to that
[1:02:11] one that Lord I'm going to get them for
[1:02:14] you I'm claiming them for you you see
[1:02:17] this is why when Rahab she was told to
[1:02:21] apply to when remember she asked I want
[1:02:23] to be I want to be sure cuz I know
[1:02:26] destruction's coming so I want something
[1:02:28] that's sure she said I want a true token
[1:02:32] I don't just want a token but I want
[1:02:34] something that's positive I want
[1:02:37] something that's sure that when I'm
[1:02:39] standing in here and everything else is
[1:02:41] shaking I want something that's
[1:02:45] solid I want a true token now I want you
[1:02:48] to take this I want you to look at this
[1:02:50] that The Messengers when they came to
[1:02:52] her they did not altogether bring
[1:02:55] something different into her house but
[1:02:57] she already had something there but she
[1:03:00] just didn't know how to apply it this is
[1:03:03] why God did not need to send a new Bible
[1:03:06] the message never came to replace the
[1:03:08] Bible but the message came to show you
[1:03:11] and I what was laying here the whole
[1:03:13] time that belonged to you and I and say
[1:03:16] hey that carlet Scarlet thread you are
[1:03:19] always a part of God you are always in
[1:03:22] God's mind it has showed us how to apply
[1:03:25] the word and live as Believers that's
[1:03:28] what this message has done for you and I
[1:03:31] it's raised the word of God to a living
[1:03:34] reality in our lives and this is why it
[1:03:37] is very important that you that me as
[1:03:40] individuals getting under it first then
[1:03:44] going after
[1:03:46] others are you hearing me we want to
[1:03:48] have a place where we are we are we are
[1:03:51] tied to and and bringing back bringing
[1:03:54] one back to this is why the prophet
[1:03:57] would say believe for your safety first
[1:03:59] then for your loved
[1:04:01] ones is that all right now Psalms 133
[1:04:05] verse one I want you to look at this
[1:04:07] just for a moment the Bible said behold
[1:04:10] how good and how pleasant it is for
[1:04:13] Brethren to dwell together in
[1:04:17] Discord in
[1:04:20] unity how pleasant that
[1:04:23] is I think Unity is a wonderful thing
[1:04:27] if you don't like Unity I'll pause the
[1:04:29] service and I'll pray for you right now
[1:04:31] cast That Old contous Devil away from
[1:04:34] you because a real child of God loves
[1:04:38] peace the Bible said follow peace with
[1:04:41] all men without no man shall see
[1:04:45] God is that right that's why we are
[1:04:49] Children of Peace I love peace don't you
[1:04:53] and I'm not just talking about a piece
[1:04:54] of pie I'm talking about Peace p e a c e
[1:04:58] peace Shalom
[1:05:01] tranquility and you know what let me
[1:05:03] just tell you something peace is not
[1:05:05] come through compromise
[1:05:08] my peace don't come through compromise
[1:05:10] look where Israel s that right now look
[1:05:13] at the pressure they're trying to bring
[1:05:15] upon Israel right now you know the Bible
[1:05:17] said whoo when all nations would turn
[1:05:19] against her that's right these people
[1:05:22] let me just tell you something these men
[1:05:24] that are up there in Washington right
[1:05:25] now they are anointed with
[1:05:29] Devils you say brother Samuel how can
[1:05:32] you say that hey when the devil took the
[1:05:34] Lord Jesus up to the mountain he showed
[1:05:36] him all the kingdoms of this world and
[1:05:39] said if you'll Bow Down and Worship me
[1:05:41] I'll give him to
[1:05:43] you but Satan has a way of splicing
[1:05:47] things he only showed the good parts of
[1:05:51] those
[1:05:51] kingdoms he didn't show all the
[1:05:54] Brokenness and all the homes and ruined
[1:05:56] lives he don't show all of that he won't
[1:05:58] show you young man and young lady he
[1:06:00] won't show you all of the things that
[1:06:03] decisions you make right now where it'll
[1:06:05] be later in your life he won't show you
[1:06:07] all of that right you ain't never seen a
[1:06:10] Marbell man on on a on a billboard
[1:06:13] lugging around and proclaiming he's an
[1:06:15] empyema patient and when GL you know
[1:06:17] with a tank of oxygen what do you see
[1:06:19] you see them smiling the big old Smiles
[1:06:22] like they're having a good time but the
[1:06:24] Bible said that the pleasure of sin is
[1:06:27] but for a
[1:06:30] season let me tell you something on my
[1:06:33] worst day I'm better than I was on my
[1:06:36] best day when I was serving the
[1:06:41] devil
[1:06:44] Hallelujah that's what his life has done
[1:06:46] for me it changed my life it picked me
[1:06:50] up from a life in the gutters of sin and
[1:06:52] it raised me up in the newness of life
[1:06:57] oh my want the church makeover amen it's
[1:07:01] got to be his
[1:07:02] life how pleasant it is for Brethren to
[1:07:06] dwell together in unity it's like the
[1:07:08] precious ointment upon the head that ran
[1:07:12] down upon the beard even Aaron's beard
[1:07:16] that went down to the skirts of his
[1:07:19] garments so notice it don't it don't it
[1:07:22] don't start in the feet and move
[1:07:24] up but but the anointing is coming from
[1:07:26] the head
[1:07:28] down brother let me tell you we're
[1:07:30] living in the hour right now where the
[1:07:32] head has United with the body amen and
[1:07:35] that same anointing that same anointing
[1:07:38] of the Messiah is working through the
[1:07:41] body of Jesus Christ it's working
[1:07:43] through the littlest pinky toe member
[1:07:46] it's working there because even if you
[1:07:48] are a part of his feet you might be the
[1:07:51] skin in the bottom of his feet but let
[1:07:53] me remind you so you can remind the
[1:07:56] devil of his position he's still under
[1:07:59] your
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:06] feet Oh Glory verse three as the D Now
[1:08:10] watch how this is described this
[1:08:12] ointment as the Dew not as a sudden
[1:08:16] rainfall but as the D of Herman if you
[1:08:18] look at what the promise was to the
[1:08:20] firstborn the firstborn promise to those
[1:08:23] when Jacob received that blessing it was
[1:08:25] the do what does do do is something that
[1:08:29] comes down in the coolness of the night
[1:08:34] and the early
[1:08:35] morning you don't hear it it's a silent
[1:08:38] coming but you will see the effect of
[1:08:42] its
[1:08:43] coming is that right you'll see it when
[1:08:46] you wake up of a morning my the Dew
[1:08:49] that's upon that of the grass it's come
[1:08:51] you never heard one d drop descend
[1:08:53] sometimes we hear the rain we hear the
[1:08:55] snow know but the Dew itself it is the
[1:08:57] moisture that's in the air and
[1:08:59] everything itself around the conditions
[1:09:02] and temperature it changes and it allows
[1:09:05] what was there in an invisible form of
[1:09:07] water vapor to now become visible and
[1:09:10] let me tell you something God's presence
[1:09:12] in our lives right now has taken and
[1:09:15] revealed the invisible God and made him
[1:09:18] visible in our midst that he not a
[1:09:21] figment of my imagination this is not a
[1:09:24] pipe dream this is a living reality that
[1:09:28] he is proving himself he's the same
[1:09:31] yesterday today and
[1:09:33] forever hallelujah it's the DW that
[1:09:37] descended upon the mountains of Zion for
[1:09:40] there the Lord commanded the blessing
[1:09:42] even life forever more so that that
[1:09:45] continuity of his Spirit it flows down
[1:09:48] to reach every part of the body the
[1:09:52] family the local body of believers that
[1:09:55] that's a precious ointment and that is
[1:09:58] the great great unifier or what brings
[1:10:02] the unity that God is looking for so the
[1:10:07] continuity nothing brings that
[1:10:09] continuity like God's life inside of a
[1:10:13] redeemed
[1:10:15] subject is that right that that's that's
[1:10:19] nothing that that brings that in that
[1:10:21] way now this is why that when we begin
[1:10:23] to see this I want I want to go to job 1
[1:10:27] and verse4 and I I wanted just just just
[1:10:29] to uh uh speak a little bit upon this on
[1:10:32] this on the continuity of life because I
[1:10:35] realized that when even that as we said
[1:10:38] God God mentioned in his text he said
[1:10:40] these words that I command you this day
[1:10:42] let them be in thine heart and then
[1:10:45] teach them to thy children and he says
[1:10:48] diligently now there's all I'm not going
[1:10:50] to deal with that here this morning but
[1:10:52] to really to to to instruct them to to
[1:10:56] minister to them ministering to their
[1:10:57] needs and and and those things of
[1:10:59] teaching and you know that don't mean
[1:11:01] that we got to get a pull pit and stand
[1:11:03] in our our uh uh living room or family
[1:11:06] room or whatever more no it's God give
[1:11:08] us the grace to break down the word and
[1:11:10] to break it down and be able to minister
[1:11:12] it even to their lives to be able to
[1:11:14] teach things that should be
[1:11:18] taught go brother I I'm very tempted to
[1:11:21] go about I'm not going to I want to lay
[1:11:23] this in here today on the life
[1:11:25] I want to lay it today on the life you
[1:11:27] see when we look at it like this in job
[1:11:30] 1:4 the Bible says concerning job his
[1:11:34] sons went and feasted in their houses
[1:11:36] every one his day and sent and called
[1:11:39] for their three sisters to eat and to
[1:11:41] drink with them and it was so when the
[1:11:44] days of their feasting were gone about
[1:11:46] that job sent and Sanctified them and
[1:11:50] Rose up early in the morning and offered
[1:11:53] burnt offerings according to the number
[1:11:57] of them all once again just like it was
[1:12:01] in Exodus where you take a lamb for your
[1:12:05] household according to the number of
[1:12:07] your children right and job offered for
[1:12:10] every one of his children job offered up
[1:12:13] a burnt offering first for himself right
[1:12:18] are you with me first for himself then
[1:12:21] he offered a burnt offering for each one
[1:12:24] of his children
[1:12:25] for job said it may be that my sons have
[1:12:28] sinned and cursed God in their hearts
[1:12:31] thus did job
[1:12:35] continually now brother brah says it
[1:12:37] this way in the way to have Fellowship
[1:12:39] he said job was a righteous man a man
[1:12:41] who feared God and troubles came to him
[1:12:44] but I want you to notice that just
[1:12:46] before the troubles come job made
[1:12:48] preparation for this trouble he said
[1:12:51] listen sinner friend there's trouble
[1:12:53] right ahead of you tonight and that's
[1:12:55] The Valleys of the Shadows of death you
[1:12:57] better make preparations for the only
[1:12:59] friend who can walk with you through
[1:13:01] that make preparations for it let me
[1:13:04] just say this to you I've been in I've
[1:13:06] been in situations where I'm thankful to
[1:13:08] God that you know sometimes the
[1:13:09] somebody's hearing is the last thing
[1:13:11] that'll go and where I was you know I
[1:13:13] got called in and different ones that
[1:13:15] hey will you come and you know it might
[1:13:16] have been 1 two in the morning or
[1:13:18] whatever and I went went over there to
[1:13:20] the hospice unit and there be to speak
[1:13:22] to to someone and would just say to him
[1:13:24] if if you can hear me and your answer is
[1:13:27] yes squeeze my hand and begin to tell
[1:13:29] them and begin to speak to them of
[1:13:33] Salvation now I I'm thankful for the
[1:13:36] Salvation of the Lord that God made way
[1:13:39] but you know not everybody has that
[1:13:41] opportunity at those last
[1:13:44] moments I walked into a room brother
[1:13:46] Bill called me we walked into a room and
[1:13:49] he was called by one of the neighbors
[1:13:51] and we walked in a few some years back
[1:13:53] and he we came over and and uh we went
[1:13:55] in and went in to pray for him and I'll
[1:13:57] tell you what we saw in that room we
[1:13:59] didn't have to really ask where was that
[1:14:00] man at we heard what was going on in
[1:14:03] there there was some real torment taking
[1:14:06] place in that room that man was walyed
[1:14:09] and looking at us and you know moving
[1:14:11] around all over the bed and when brother
[1:14:13] Bill and I begin to gather around of
[1:14:15] course he couldn't understand English we
[1:14:16] begin to gather around and just pray and
[1:14:19] ask for the mercy of almighty God and
[1:14:21] brother Bill be to speak to him you say
[1:14:23] what became of that I I don't know but I
[1:14:25] know what I saw in that time and I would
[1:14:27] encourage you right now don't count on
[1:14:30] the last minute
[1:14:32] amen make every moment
[1:14:36] count if you're here today and you don't
[1:14:39] know where your destiny lies and you
[1:14:42] know that you're not ready to meet the

[1:15:19] children away from our city we don't
[1:15:21] have any Christian schools there and I
[1:15:23] want them to get somewhere where they'll

[1:15:27] Fundamental School where they'll where
[1:15:30] they'll they'll learn to love the Lord

[1:15:35] them and saying well I hope somebody
[1:15:36] else could teach
[1:15:38] them no you see church is not to take
[1:15:42] the place of your time of devotion at
[1:15:46] home this should not be the first place
[1:15:49] that your children hear somebody
[1:15:53] praying and I'll just say it PL it
[1:15:55] should not be the first place that they
[1:15:57] feel the presence of God I trust they
[1:16:00] feel God's presence here I know he's
[1:16:02] here but God didn't intend that you just
[1:16:05] have to come here to the to the church
[1:16:08] to fill his presence he wants to live in
[1:16:11] your home and live in your life that
[1:16:14] through you it's a personal
[1:16:18] contact not drop him off at youth
[1:16:20] meeting and say brother Samuel fix them

[1:16:41] realize that you know what God if your
[1:16:43] mercy don't come on the scene not only
[1:16:45] to straighten this out but help me also
[1:16:47] to speak to the other one and say hey
[1:16:49] you got to stop aiming it this way you

[1:16:54] that it'll have an effect in your
[1:16:57] home come on
[1:17:00] Friends amen notice so I'm not just
[1:17:03] brother BR wasn't just looking for a
[1:17:04] Christian School to send them to to say
[1:17:06] I need somebody just to you know
[1:17:08] somebody's got to teach in the ways of
[1:17:09] the
[1:17:10] Lord you got to be careful where you're
[1:17:12] even sending your kids to
[1:17:18] yes amen you got to be careful you might
[1:17:20] even send them listen I remember there
[1:17:22] was a time here my wife and I we were
[1:17:24] looking that you know with Zachary being
[1:17:26] the last one we're about out of breath
[1:17:28] with homeschooling right now but God's
[1:17:30] given us Grace to make it you know bless
[1:17:33] her heart she's the one that's really
[1:17:34] been doing the labor and I'm just the
[1:17:35] principal and the and the math guy you
[1:17:37] know but uh you know the enforcer but
[1:17:41] anyhow you know we we we we get in that
[1:17:43] place and Ma you know uh you come to
[1:17:45] that we we got to looking at another you
[1:17:47] know another school that's you know out
[1:17:49] in a Southern place here from from us
[1:17:51] I'm not going to call their name and so
[1:17:53] we went out there and they said oh
[1:17:54] you're a pastor we we we we'll give you
[1:17:56] so many uh you know so much money you
[1:17:58] know that your your kids can come here
[1:17:59] and and make you know your child and and
[1:18:01] you know probably somebody will you know
[1:18:03] be a sponsor for and everything else and
[1:18:05] I got to I was looking around that
[1:18:07] school and my mind went back and I
[1:18:08] thought I remember to associating with
[1:18:10] some people from this school now I know
[1:18:13] everybody don't associated with don't
[1:18:15] represent that school but I remember
[1:18:17] that it it wasn't nothing like you know
[1:18:20] Angels flying
[1:18:22] around there you go and then I went in
[1:18:24] when they were going to have their you
[1:18:26] know morning devotion and I went in what
[1:18:28] a what a beautiful Chapel that they had
[1:18:32] and they've made that thing look like a
[1:18:34] concert hall black stage and black
[1:18:37] background and every I thought dear Lord
[1:18:40] am I am I back out in the world wow you
[1:18:43] know they got these rock bands and
[1:18:45] everything else up there and you know
[1:18:46] they're ministering to the young people
[1:18:48] there ain't ministering to the young
[1:18:49] people listen friends I'm not here to
[1:18:51] try to criticize people I believe that
[1:18:54] there is something that maybe they want
[1:18:56] to try to do good but let me tell you
[1:18:58] God's not interested in you just getting
[1:19:00] to a church cuz you can set in a church
[1:19:03] all your life and die and go to
[1:19:06] hell just getting to a church you ain't
[1:19:09] made it you've got to get to Calvary
[1:19:11] you've got to meet the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:14] in a personal way that's right that's
[1:19:17] where my heart burns when I look at that
[1:19:19] there's young people in needs that are
[1:19:21] there well you know I just couldn't find
[1:19:23] peace about it so you know you know what
[1:19:25] we didn't go that way I said you know
[1:19:26] what we'll just we're going to ask God
[1:19:28] and you know the Lord will just help us
[1:19:30] and guide us you know God knows what we
[1:19:32] have need of and God certainly made way
[1:19:34] with that and I I'm thankful uh for
[1:19:36] where where we're at now but I I'm just
[1:19:38] saying it in this manner that you've got
[1:19:40] we have to be
[1:19:43] mindful that's TR brother R says this he
[1:19:46] goes on that same quote he says because
[1:19:48] the teaching that I can give them around
[1:19:49] home yet when they get out around that
[1:19:52] worldly crowd the Devil is a R fellow
[1:19:55] and he pushes that into him now watch
[1:19:59] this he says but if you'll keep them
[1:20:01] under the spirit until they get old
[1:20:06] enough to receive the Holy Ghost brother
[1:20:09] Samuel how old is that is that 12 you're
[1:20:12] missing the quote it's not for you to
[1:20:15] push them it's for you to keep them
[1:20:18] under it God has reserved every
[1:20:23] experience the prophet tells us Satan's
[1:20:25] Eden your experiences are predestinated
[1:20:29] from the hand of
[1:20:32] God are you with
[1:20:34] me if you keep them under the spirit
[1:20:38] until they get old enough to receive the
[1:20:40] Holy Ghost and know what it's all about
[1:20:45] then God will take care of the rest of I
[1:20:47] like that if you do your part what are
[1:20:50] you doing I'm preparing for a
[1:20:53] miracle hey little woman woman of cabus
[1:20:55] what are you doing by making that cake
[1:20:56] I'm preparing for a miracle that's right
[1:20:59] hey those of you that are filling up
[1:21:01] those those empty uh uh uh uh uh barrels
[1:21:04] or jugs what what are you doing you ran
[1:21:05] out of wine what are you doing I'm
[1:21:07] preparing for a miracle amen amen you
[1:21:09] see you got to do according to the word
[1:21:12] you do that first then the miracle
[1:21:14] follows the word because the miracle is
[1:21:17] to come and make manifest the word that
[1:21:20] you're walking in obedience
[1:21:23] to so here keep them under the spirit
[1:21:27] until they get on all that's the same
[1:21:28] manner that even has been from the Old
[1:21:31] Testament with Abraham on down on down
[1:21:33] on down it was the same manner when the
[1:21:35] Lord Jesus when he raised even before he
[1:21:38] raised from the dead remember he called
[1:21:40] the disciples to him and he had them
[1:21:43] around him they could see they could
[1:21:46] watch him he even would correct them
[1:21:48] remember when John was all upset because
[1:21:50] you know they wouldn't receive the Lord
[1:21:52] Jesus and he said should we call Fire
[1:21:54] Out of Heaven now John knew that story
[1:21:57] he you know no doubt he had had stars on
[1:21:59] that in Sunday school on his chart he
[1:22:01] was a Firebrand but you know when the
[1:22:03] Lord Jesus took that that scripture and
[1:22:05] begin to apply that he said wait a
[1:22:07] minute you don't know what Spirit you're
[1:22:09] of so he was showing him even how to
[1:22:11] apply the word and yet after the after
[1:22:14] the crucifixion they all went their
[1:22:16] separate ways sheep that were scattered
[1:22:19] that was the promise of that was God
[1:22:21] would fulfill or would come to pass but
[1:22:23] after he was raised from the grave what
[1:22:26] did he do he gathered his disciples
[1:22:30] together and pointed them to the upper
[1:22:33] room right so he gathered them under
[1:22:37] there's nothing that can unite outside
[1:22:40] of God himself coming around his
[1:22:43] children is that right now there'll be
[1:22:45] others remember there are many that were
[1:22:47] that are attracted many that even when
[1:22:49] he came back in for the feast that were
[1:22:51] attracted but yet not all of them were
[1:22:53] Eagles right some of them just looked at
[1:22:56] it a little bit and fin that h h no no
[1:22:59] no they they went away but you couldn't
[1:23:01] get rid of the elect of God but it was
[1:23:04] necessary that they were held underneath
[1:23:07] the spirit of God As a matter of fact
[1:23:09] the comforter himself that was dwelling
[1:23:12] Spirit of Truth dwelling behind that
[1:23:14] body of Flesh told them that you that I
[1:23:17] will be in you even with you to the end
[1:23:21] of the age so they were held under the
[1:23:24] reality of God but now when the spirit
[1:23:27] of God has come on the day of Pentecost
[1:23:29] now is the same life that was in there
[1:23:33] the same Jesus that was there the same
[1:23:36] one that lived in that body was now
[1:23:39] living in their
[1:23:41] bodies it was the continuity of
[1:23:45] Life there was a continuity so that's
[1:23:48] the same way with this message when you
[1:23:50] think about it God takes a message like
[1:23:54] like when you look at that of Exodus
[1:23:56] where Moses was to go down to Egypt you
[1:23:58] will find a little portion of scripture
[1:24:01] where God made a promise that I will
[1:24:03] bring them out with a mighty hand but
[1:24:06] all that God will do when he takes a
[1:24:08] hold and begins to fulfill that word
[1:24:11] then he begins to unfold himself in the
[1:24:14] midst of his people and this is the same
[1:24:17] way with the message of the hour God
[1:24:19] just did not send and drop to you an i
[1:24:22] and say hey this is the message of the
[1:24:23] hour but God labored with you and I he
[1:24:26] labored with this generation can I just
[1:24:28] repeat the words of the Prophet The
[1:24:30] Prophet would stand there in perfect
[1:24:32] Faith he would say it in other places
[1:24:34] and he said you know what I'm going to
[1:24:36] do he said I'm going to put my faith on
[1:24:38] top of your faith and I'm going to call
[1:24:40] out to God on your behalf let me tell
[1:24:43] you in this generation it wasn't a man's
[1:24:46] idea that has been placed over the Bride
[1:24:49] of Jesus Christ it has been the hand of
[1:24:53] almighty God and brotherr we're not
[1:24:55] raiding on a latter rain we have saw the
[1:24:58] cloud as a man's
[1:25:01] hand amen the cloud himself Christ
[1:25:05] himself right here among you and I we
[1:25:08] are under the message of
[1:25:12] adoption we are under a word that will
[1:25:14] mature you
[1:25:16] my I'm trying not to get over in Ruth oh
[1:25:20] my we are under a message that will
[1:25:22] supply and satisfy all that you have
[1:25:25] need of he is your goel he will perfect
[1:25:29] all that's lacking he's got your
[1:25:32] [Applause]
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:38] back notice in Acts chapter 16 same
[1:25:43] Principle as this was with job when they
[1:25:46] came Piers Peter or Paul and Silas man
[1:25:50] here they are locked
[1:25:51] up for actually helping somebody right
[1:25:55] and then they didn't help the Commerce
[1:25:56] of the world they didn't help that guy
[1:25:59] that you know he lost that person that
[1:26:01] was walking around with divination and
[1:26:03] speaking you know on behalf of those
[1:26:05] gods and things they lost
[1:26:07] Commerce let me tell you something right
[1:26:09] now when God got a hold of your life and
[1:26:11] a hold of my life there's places of
[1:26:14] business that lost our
[1:26:16] [Applause]
[1:26:20] business they lost our business amen
[1:26:24] that's good come on now some of you were
[1:26:26] some Heavy
[1:26:27] Hitters they lost your business and some
[1:26:31] of you just W Heavy Hitters I know
[1:26:33] there's people sitting in right here
[1:26:34] there was some of you that was Kingpin
[1:26:37] in this
[1:26:39] County woo you know what I'm talking
[1:26:42] about but notice what happened when
[1:26:44] God's grace got a hold of your life it
[1:26:47] interrupted the
[1:26:49] commerse everything that was going on in
[1:26:52] your life Hallelujah oh God has a way of
[1:26:55] interrupting what needs to be
[1:26:58] interrupted there's things from that
[1:27:00] come down from my family tree I'm so
[1:27:03] glad that he
[1:27:05] interrupted aren't you sir oh we need
[1:27:08] them kind of interruptions when the Holy
[1:27:10] Ghost has come it interrupts any claim
[1:27:14] that was there in that family tree
[1:27:16] that's what the continuity of this life
[1:27:18] does it puts us right back in position
[1:27:21] as a son and daughter of God uh acts
[1:27:25] 16:30 here they come in now notice this
[1:27:28] man had no doubt took into account what
[1:27:31] what Paul and Silas that they were
[1:27:32] Believers heard him singing heard him
[1:27:34] praising God the Bible says how he came
[1:27:37] and he fell down before their feet and
[1:27:39] in verse 30 said sir what must I do to
[1:27:41] be saved and they said you got to stop
[1:27:45] this that and this and that nope he said
[1:27:47] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:27:50] thou shalt be saved and thy house oh I
[1:27:53] love it the prophet will take this verse
[1:27:56] he said when you really believe there is
[1:27:58] a measure of faith that is released to
[1:28:00] you and you begin to lift above cheating
[1:28:04] lift above lying lift above living
[1:28:07] immoral lift above immoral dress what is
[1:28:10] it it's a measure of faith that is
[1:28:12] released to you as you believe so it
[1:28:16] isn't you quitting it it's the faith of
[1:28:19] God coming in and your will is lined up
[1:28:22] with God's Will and the the will of God
[1:28:24] is being done through your life believe
[1:28:27] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy
[1:28:31] house shall be
[1:28:36] saved amen now you know brother brand
[1:28:40] will pick this up when the in the
[1:28:42] message approach to God and uh Brana
[1:28:46] it's the approach to God and paragraph
[1:28:48] 33
[1:28:50] there bless her heart she has such a job
[1:28:53] to keep up
[1:28:55] here oh you
[1:28:57] say now brother brandham now wait a
[1:29:00] minute I don't believe that the
[1:29:03] influence of the father now he's talking
[1:29:04] about offering the burnt offering I
[1:29:06] don't believe that the influence of the
[1:29:08] father I believe it's an individual
[1:29:11] Affair but we are commissioned to pray
[1:29:15] for one another and to offer up our
[1:29:18] loved ones to God that he will save them
[1:29:22] so brother br's not contradicting that
[1:29:24] it's not an individual Affair but he's
[1:29:27] saying as job offered up the burnt
[1:29:31] offering
[1:29:32] continually for that of his not only
[1:29:34] hisself or his children you know you and
[1:29:37] I actually have it easier than job we
[1:29:39] don't have to offer it up we just have
[1:29:40] to accept what's been offered
[1:29:43] up job actually had to offer it up he
[1:29:45] had to take it out there separate it out
[1:29:47] on the altar he had to do that you and I
[1:29:50] have it easier all we have to do is
[1:29:52] accept what the sacri rice has already
[1:29:55] done for
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:57] us so he's not taking away that it's not
[1:30:00] an individual Affair it is an individual
[1:30:03] affair with every one of our children
[1:30:05] and every one of our loved ones it is an
[1:30:07] individual Affair now as we're looking
[1:30:09] at this brother R would say he says now
[1:30:11] in the midst of all this job kept his
[1:30:13] mind on God in the offering of the sin
[1:30:15] offerings he says now maybe the approach
[1:30:17] and you say was it in the New Testament
[1:30:19] too certainly it was if I get saved in
[1:30:21] my house should I leave my house not
[1:30:24] unless you have to I'd stay right there
[1:30:27] for Paul told the Philippian Jailer
[1:30:29] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy
[1:30:31] and thy household shall be saved the
[1:30:33] Sanctified wife sanctifies the husband
[1:30:37] live like a Christian now this is how it
[1:30:40] happens live like a Christian be like a
[1:30:43] Christian pray all the time believe that
[1:30:46] God is there and is God going to answer
[1:30:49] your prayer and offer it through the
[1:30:51] provided approach let me just tell you
[1:30:53] like this when instead of getting
[1:30:55] frustrated offer the
[1:30:57] lamb instead of getting upset offer the
[1:31:01] lamb why because you're to offer it with
[1:31:04] prayer consideration and in such
[1:31:08] love I mean if you ask your wife for
[1:31:10] something and you say hey come on now
[1:31:12] where's this at and she says here here's
[1:31:15] your
[1:31:15] eggs and I hope you
[1:31:21] enjoy wow that's good you would sayoo
[1:31:25] that was with
[1:31:28] love right you would say my that was no
[1:31:32] no but but look look how this is live
[1:31:35] like a Christian see friends this is the
[1:31:38] secret it's not our knowledge it's not
[1:31:42] even our frustration let me just share
[1:31:44] something with you I hope this all right
[1:31:46] if you if you you disagree with me fine
[1:31:47] you can disagree with me but you know
[1:31:49] what I I've got such a place and such a
[1:31:51] part I realize you know where I miss you
[1:31:53] miss seeing different and people maybe
[1:31:54] that's gone astray and you miss seeing
[1:31:56] them in the house of God listen they
[1:31:57] know they're not in the house of God and
[1:32:00] instead of walking up and saying hey you
[1:32:02] need to get back to church hey you need
[1:32:03] to get back to church I just say you
[1:32:05] know what what I want I what I look at
[1:32:06] is I want to be friendly to them I want
[1:32:09] to encourage them because let me just
[1:32:11] say this to you you might think I'm
[1:32:12] wrong but I don't want somebody to think
[1:32:15] that it's just coming here to church
[1:32:17] that you set under this roof it's got to
[1:32:19] be more than
[1:32:21] that because that's what they have
[1:32:24] that's all they had or they wouldn't be
[1:32:26] where they're
[1:32:27] at you can say we miss
[1:32:33] you and if you ain't seen somebody in a
[1:32:35] while in church don't chastise them and
[1:32:39] say hey how you doing stranger oh my
[1:32:44] wonder when the last time God asked you
[1:32:46] that when you gave him only those five
[1:32:47] minute
[1:32:48] prayers that's good come on friends will
[1:32:53] you say what are we doing brother
[1:32:54] Brandon PRS this same scripture and he
[1:32:56] preaches the message thy house and he
[1:32:58] says I am believing not only for my
[1:33:01] children but I'm believing for every
[1:33:03] brother for every sister I'm holding
[1:33:06] them up before the Throne of God are you
[1:33:10] hearing me job was not offering an
[1:33:12] offering with my I see him changing my I
[1:33:14] see this is going good my I see no he
[1:33:17] said per Adventure they sin as a matter
[1:33:21] of fact I'll read you a quote here in a
[1:33:23] minute brother said job seen
[1:33:28] worldliness
[1:33:30] wow but sometimes when we see
[1:33:33] worldliness we want to pout on
[1:33:36] God or we want to somehow chastise as
[1:33:40] reprimand as though and sometimes listen
[1:33:42] friends I realize sometimes when we deal
[1:33:44] with are all of our makeups this is
[1:33:46] where the part that's not in continuity
[1:33:48] I realize some of these parts about us
[1:33:50] is not going to ever be changed until
[1:33:52] the change of the body
[1:33:54] and there's certain things about us that
[1:33:56] we have to recognize hey that's still in
[1:33:58] me but I got to rule over that and God
[1:34:00] has allowed that to be in your life so
[1:34:02] he could dig it out of your life and
[1:34:04] manifest his glory through that air in
[1:34:05] your life
[1:34:07] amen he's there teaching you and I
[1:34:09] remember the prophet said when you go to
[1:34:11] talk to that loved one you're praying in
[1:34:13] Your Heart Lord I'm going to claim them
[1:34:16] for you now that don't mean you're spit
[1:34:17] and powdered sugar all over them it
[1:34:19] doesn't mean you're going along with
[1:34:20] their sin but it's just exactly like the
[1:34:22] prophet told Brother Billy Paul just
[1:34:24] read it here this morning in brother
[1:34:25] Billy Paul's testimony of how brother
[1:34:28] Bram told him said look I want you to
[1:34:29] remember that Daddy is your buddy when
[1:34:32] you go out you're going out in sin and
[1:34:34] the way you're going I want you to
[1:34:35] remember that Daddy is still your buddy
[1:34:38] but Daddy is not going to go along and
[1:34:40] condone your sin but when the rest of
[1:34:42] the world and your so-called buddies
[1:34:44] they let you go I want you to remember
[1:34:47] that Daddy is your
[1:34:49] buddy brother random just didn't tell
[1:34:51] him that every Tuesday morning he went
[1:34:54] fishing with Billy
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:35:00] Paul hallelujah oh brother Samuel I'd
[1:35:03] say he preached to him he did not as a
[1:35:06] matter of fact in the M well I I need to
[1:35:09] just keep on going here in the message
[1:35:12] the prodal 1950 brother brother Billy
[1:35:14] Paul I've got it at home the the
[1:35:16] testimony he slips into church finally
[1:35:19] cuz he had been sitting across the
[1:35:21] street on Doc's porch and would not come
[1:35:23] back into the church because of the way
[1:35:25] he was living but he was sitting on the
[1:35:27] porch across from the church yeah I'm
[1:35:29] talking about look at you know what I I
[1:35:31] am I'm glad in the way that God gave
[1:35:33] this example here is the prophet of God
[1:35:35] his oldest son you know what it shows
[1:35:37] you and I that just because he saw the
[1:35:40] angel of the Lord at age 11 but that
[1:35:43] didn't hold
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:45] him are you hearing me it didn't hold
[1:35:48] him it didn't keep him from smoking
[1:35:50] didn't keep him from playing cards amen
[1:35:53] right
[1:35:54] just so just because we're raised and
[1:35:56] got a knowledge of the message and you
[1:35:58] got books on the shelf and pictures on
[1:36:00] the wall it's got to be more than that
[1:36:02] it's got to be a display in your life
[1:36:05] it's got to be a reality where Jesus
[1:36:07] Christ is present in your home he's
[1:36:10] present in your
[1:36:12] life
[1:36:13] right and I ain't talking about it
[1:36:16] Christmas time or Easter time either
[1:36:18] bring Jesus out of the
[1:36:20] Tomb and don't just point to an empty
[1:36:24] you be a fi place for
[1:36:27] him my my my my my my my notice this cuz
[1:36:33] in that message the prodical
[1:36:36] son brother B brother Billy sat on the
[1:36:39] back the back room he fin came into
[1:36:41] church
[1:36:43] 1950 I'm giving these dates CU I'm going
[1:36:45] to read you some dates here in just a
[1:36:47] minute showing an example how this cuz
[1:36:49] when we look at the scripture job did it
[1:36:51] continually I love how the message of
[1:36:53] the hour
[1:36:54] you know what it is it's showing the
[1:36:56] application how that we apply these
[1:36:58] things that's
[1:37:00] right the deacons had a burden on their
[1:37:02] heart for Billy Paul so brother brandham
[1:37:04] come out and he's preaching the message
[1:37:06] the prodical son brother Bram said
[1:37:08] brother Billy said I know he didn't do
[1:37:09] it cuz I was there because he said Daddy
[1:37:10] wouldn't do things like that but the
[1:37:12] deacons came around to him and begin to
[1:37:14] work on him brother Billy Paul got up
[1:37:16] and walked out of the out of the church
[1:37:19] brother Billy says God was dealing with
[1:37:21] my heart he said I was fighting it back
[1:37:22] the whole service
[1:37:24] now brother Bram called them deacons in
[1:37:25] the back office and this is what he told
[1:37:27] him he said I see that you all have a
[1:37:30] burden for my son for Billy and I so
[1:37:34] appreciate that but don't ever do that
[1:37:37] again to him or nobody
[1:37:40] else it's got to be between God and that
[1:37:44] person what are you saying if you
[1:37:47] persuade them then listen friends the
[1:37:49] devil can come back back around and say
[1:37:52] you don't have nothing you were only
[1:37:54] persuaded into it but God knows how to
[1:37:56] get your
[1:37:57] attention God knows how to get your
[1:38:00] children God knows how to work on
[1:38:04] lives God don't shame his people to the
[1:38:07] altar he calls them in love and mercy
[1:38:10] and Grace and lets them know you are a
[1:38:13] value in my eyes I shed my blood for you
[1:38:17] you are always in my
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:22] mind
[1:38:24] hallelujah
[1:38:26] hallelujah my my brother Braham talked
[1:38:29] about sending his boy he says it like
[1:38:32] this he says in the message approached
[1:38:34] to God he said I thought about sending
[1:38:36] my boy to school knowing that everything
[1:38:37] Billy Paul that I drilled into him
[1:38:40] unless he becomes really converted
[1:38:42] really come to Christ all of his nature
[1:38:44] be changed he'd be swept out from under
[1:38:47] my
[1:38:48] hands oh Lord you mean he's been taught
[1:38:51] drilled the right teaching yeah he set
[1:38:54] under the right thing he saw the
[1:38:57] miraculous but unless his Nature's been
[1:38:59] changed that's
[1:39:01] right he'll be swept out am why because
[1:39:06] he is in with that old nature you are
[1:39:08] still in
[1:39:10] continuity With the
[1:39:13] Enemy this is why the new birth is
[1:39:15] important it brings you in continuity
[1:39:18] with
[1:39:20] God and God begins to work on your life
[1:39:22] even by new heart and a new spirit he
[1:39:24] gives that to you because before that
[1:39:27] you couldn't even get along with
[1:39:29] yourself then he said I'll put my spirit
[1:39:32] in you is that right because the very
[1:39:35] nature in him no matter being a good boy
[1:39:38] you he was a good boy having a minister
[1:39:40] father a religious home where we don't
[1:39:42] approve of any of the worldly things in
[1:39:44] our home we try to live by the grace of
[1:39:46] God like Christians ought to live the
[1:39:48] influence set before him he'd certainly
[1:39:50] walk over a righteous home look how this
[1:39:52] is worded he'd walk over a righteous
[1:39:54] home to be lost by if he's going to be
[1:39:57] lost he's going to have to walk over a
[1:39:59] lot
[1:40:01] right anybody like speed
[1:40:04] bumps I'm going to say put your hands
[1:40:06] down you're
[1:40:07] lying in one way back in the
[1:40:09] neighborhood where I live I wish they'd
[1:40:11] put some up where now because all that
[1:40:12] new development that they've done and
[1:40:14] you get people whipping around there and
[1:40:16] and everything else but you know what I
[1:40:17] hate speed bumps you know why you got to
[1:40:20] slow
[1:40:21] down if you don't slow down
[1:40:25] it just you know the bouncing all
[1:40:27] around so I don't like speed bumps but
[1:40:30] this is what the prophet is saying he's
[1:40:32] going to have to walk over speed
[1:40:35] bumps things that will slow him down to
[1:40:38] cause him to think that's good pre
[1:40:41] that's good preach and I want him to
[1:40:43] have to walk over my life he'd have to
[1:40:45] walk over the Bible he'd have to walk
[1:40:47] over the blood of Christ because I'll
[1:40:49] certainly by God's grace present it in
[1:40:52] front of him amen amen but if his nature
[1:40:55] isn't change he'll go right on just the
[1:40:57] same Billy entered high school and I
[1:40:58] thought oh my knowing that he he'd been
[1:41:00] baptized certainly but he never made a
[1:41:02] full surrender consecration to Christ so
[1:41:05] brother Braham is not he's not ignorant
[1:41:08] he's he's been baptized he surrendered
[1:41:10] his heart to God but he's able to see
[1:41:12] he's not been fully consecrated yet
[1:41:15] right and he knows how important that is
[1:41:19] he's that that that initial part that
[1:41:21] decision that step how wonderful that
[1:41:23] that is brother is able to see that he
[1:41:24] hasn't made a full consecration now
[1:41:26] knowing the nature of a child yet was in
[1:41:28] him how my heart yearned for him and how
[1:41:31] I'd pray I'd go out in my car and ride
[1:41:33] around and say this is how the offering
[1:41:35] up of that burnt offering and say God
[1:41:38] don't let my boy get wrapped up in that
[1:41:40] kind of stuff out there how that I said
[1:41:42] God I hope I pray his his mother's dead
[1:41:44] and I've been both Daddy and mother to
[1:41:46] him so please don't let him get wrapped
[1:41:48] up out there and get in trouble some way
[1:41:51] will you just protect him Hallelujah
[1:41:54] now remember when brother Billy Paul I
[1:41:55] don't know if y'all knew this or not
[1:41:56] it's in the message but it was one of
[1:41:57] those things that for me it wasn't until
[1:41:58] a few years back and then as I'm
[1:42:00] studying this is's going through that
[1:42:02] you realize remember brother ramam saw a
[1:42:03] vision of him smoking 13 years old 13-y
[1:42:07] old boy smoking and brother brandham
[1:42:10] just waited and then he mentioned it to
[1:42:12] brother Billy Paul what it was he'd got
[1:42:14] out there in school and got around some
[1:42:16] of the rest of the people you see you'll
[1:42:18] never find brother brandom in these
[1:42:19] quotes saying but I'm the prophet of God
[1:42:21] for this age they of the Lord visits our
[1:42:24] home he comes right in that Den office
[1:42:26] and that is enough no he knew he knew
[1:42:31] he's got to have his nature changed if
[1:42:34] not no matter how much that I have put
[1:42:36] in him unless that nature is changed
[1:42:39] it'll be swept right out of him that's
[1:42:42] right now this is
[1:42:45] 1955 brother brandom is dealing now what
[1:42:47] what he said this is what I want you to
[1:42:49] take into account I know I'm I'm taking
[1:42:50] a few moments here but I want you to I
[1:42:52] want I want you to catch this this is
[1:42:54] this is how we apply the token this is
[1:42:56] why I want you to catch this we're
[1:42:57] applying it by the life the life that's
[1:43:00] lived and you and I cannot speed
[1:43:02] anything up in our children but for
[1:43:05] goodness sakes I don't want to put the
[1:43:06] wrong kind of roadblocks in the
[1:43:09] way there you go brother you understand
[1:43:11] I don't want to put the wrong if look if
[1:43:12] they've made a decision and look it's
[1:43:14] not just when they made a decision I I
[1:43:16] want to see them serve God I want to I
[1:43:18] want to get them in every place that I
[1:43:20] can get them with the presence of God I
[1:43:22] want them to be in meetings I want them
[1:43:24] to be in fellowship with good brothers
[1:43:27] and good
[1:43:30] sisters maybe I shouldn't have said that
[1:43:32] good sisters
[1:43:33] but but we do want good sisters because
[1:43:37] I want good
[1:43:39] daughter-in-laws you go interviews not
[1:43:42] I'm
[1:43:43] just but watch this in
[1:43:46] 1955 that I'm reading out of 1955 in
[1:43:49] these prior
[1:43:50] messages right watch how brother
[1:43:53] brandham approaches this brother Billy
[1:43:55] Paul is not converted Yet brother
[1:43:58] brother brandham wanted to take him out
[1:44:00] of the school the reason I'm reading
[1:44:01] this is because he's seen the influences
[1:44:03] that was on his child right now this is
[1:44:07] I want you to take this tonight this
[1:44:09] morning don't take this as pressure you
[1:44:11] pray and seek God don't take it as
[1:44:13] pressure well I can't do that or I I
[1:44:15] can't homeschool that's not what I'm
[1:44:17] saying here that's not what brother
[1:44:19] brandham is saying what I'm saying is
[1:44:21] when we take from this here is to pray
[1:44:23] over it and you pray and talk to
[1:44:28] God what's amazing to me is sometimes
[1:44:30] when you hear things where people talk
[1:44:32] about their kids like they're dogs well
[1:44:35] I want my kids to be socialized they're
[1:44:37] not
[1:44:38] dogs who do you want them to be
[1:44:40] socialized with the
[1:44:42] world come on friends I'm reading quotes
[1:44:45] and there's a whole Bounty
[1:44:47] more we want them to be I I want them to
[1:44:50] be so under the presence of God I know
[1:44:52] what's out there
[1:44:54] I see the influences that's out there
[1:44:56] listen where I've Got Confidence for is
[1:44:58] that when their life is sealed away hey
[1:45:01] I God they're in God's hands God takes
[1:45:04] care of the rest of the way and that the
[1:45:06] greatest achievement has been
[1:45:11] done notice brother Billy Paul brother B
[1:45:14] talks about taking him with him in the
[1:45:16] meetings brother Ram said last night
[1:45:18] Billy Paul in the presence of the Lord
[1:45:20] Jesus he taken me a little early me he
[1:45:22] took him out of the pull pit than what I
[1:45:23] thought he should have done but he said
[1:45:25] Daddy you turned completely white
[1:45:26] brother BR said if that boy would give
[1:45:28] himself over to God he sees Visions but
[1:45:31] he's just in the Adolescent age and you
[1:45:35] pray for him see brother Brown believed
[1:45:37] his own message his son saw Visions but
[1:45:40] he never made that an
[1:45:43] Evidence hello somebody he believed his
[1:45:45] own
[1:45:47] message hallu see he's never given
[1:45:50] himself over to God Amen but he's just
[1:45:53] in the Adolescent age he's 20 years old
[1:45:55] right now and you pray for him I keep
[1:45:58] him in the meetings because I know what
[1:46:02] Young Life is and I was young once
[1:46:05] myself brother brandom how can you have
[1:46:08] him pass on out prayer cards because I
[1:46:10] know what Young Life is and brother
[1:46:13] brandom took him out of the school to
[1:46:14] keep him with
[1:46:16] him because he knew the influences that
[1:46:19] was there he saw the direction that
[1:46:22] brother Billy was going let me tell you
[1:46:23] in this day and age and hour we living
[1:46:25] in listen this is why there's got to be
[1:46:27] such a contact and such a relationship
[1:46:30] and that's where Satan hates that in the
[1:46:32] homes he wants to keep us busy going
[1:46:34] here going there going here going there
[1:46:36] going here going there what what's he
[1:46:38] trying to do he wants to keep that
[1:46:40] relationship in Array or disarray and
[1:46:43] broken but that is some of the most
[1:46:45] important
[1:46:46] times right amen I hate to say it that
[1:46:50] almost anymore the dinner tables almost
[1:46:53] out of the
[1:46:54] house I think it ought to be a priority
[1:46:57] amen I'm not talking about eating cuz I
[1:46:58] believe in that but I'm talking about
[1:47:00] getting around the
[1:47:02] table so what I'm saying here atmosphere
[1:47:04] is important atmosphere brings Faith
[1:47:09] amen my my I'm just going to have to
[1:47:11] quit there keep going thank you I will
[1:47:15] you're allowable to get killed after
[1:47:17] this
[1:47:18] service it'll be one less Tennessee
[1:47:21] and
[1:47:22] [Laughter]
[1:47:26] Volunteer
[1:47:28] State oh I love
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:32] it but you know friends let me just say
[1:47:34] it like this you want your children to
[1:47:37] fellowship and see that's important you
[1:47:39] be an
[1:47:41] example you want to see him fellowship
[1:47:43] with other people you be an
[1:47:46] example how can you tell them and lead
[1:47:48] them and tell them the importance of
[1:47:51] Fellowship well brother Samuel all I
[1:47:53] need is a word I can't get to that this
[1:47:55] morning but it's also Fellowship that's
[1:47:58] right fellowship with brothers and
[1:48:00] sisters of like Precious Faith amen is
[1:48:05] that right Fellowship is important and
[1:48:08] brother BR would tell sister Becky you
[1:48:11] know his his little daughter he would
[1:48:12] tell her in the message remembering the
[1:48:14] Lord there's a youth rally that's going
[1:48:16] on brother Bram said I told my daughter
[1:48:19] you make it your business to get in
[1:48:21] there she said I don't know nobody in
[1:48:26] there I said you'll know somebody or
[1:48:28] everybody will know you just go on
[1:48:31] anyhow I'm praying she receives the
[1:48:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost during this
[1:48:37] rally
[1:48:39] right now you know what brother bram's
[1:48:41] talking about here because at this time
[1:48:42] even months after this in the message
[1:48:45] desperation sometimes these are parts of
[1:48:47] the message that we can miss at first
[1:48:49] but brother Ram talks about how she's in
[1:48:51] a teeny bopper stage right she'll sat in
[1:48:53] the back of the church and want a chew
[1:48:54] gum while church is going on said she's
[1:48:57] in a Carefree the beginning of message
[1:48:59] desperation 1963 in September she just
[1:49:02] sat in the back and kind of don't want
[1:49:04] want anything to do with God that's the
[1:49:05] beginning of 63 or or in September but
[1:49:09] you know what happened there in March of
[1:49:12] 1963 she met
[1:49:16] George now here's some months later
[1:49:19] she's still not filled with the Holy
[1:49:21] Ghost remember she's just had her
[1:49:23] episode of running around and as far as
[1:49:25] running around going you know playing
[1:49:27] that rock and roll music she said but I
[1:49:28] was really bad brother Bram said yeah as
[1:49:30] bad as we wanted to
[1:49:32] get but notice this is what brother Bram
[1:49:35] says I can't read you the quote today I
[1:49:37] got in front of me he says now he says
[1:49:39] we had that going on he said but of
[1:49:40] course he said then she met George and
[1:49:43] that settled all that he said he's a
[1:49:45] good Christian boy did that mean she was
[1:49:47] born again no no it went until later as
[1:49:50] a matter of fact brother Bram allowed
[1:49:51] him to get engaged but said don't you
[1:49:52] you're not allowed to get married until
[1:49:54] you get the Holy Ghost wow
[1:49:58] wow are you hearing me now that my words
[1:50:00] that's brother George's words what
[1:50:02] brother Bram had told him right you see
[1:50:04] he brother Bram he saw the goodness of
[1:50:06] that company and that that encouragement
[1:50:09] and that company listen friends oh my I
[1:50:11] I could go on and on I I just we we we
[1:50:14] need to quit we need to
[1:50:16] quit but we want to keep our children in
[1:50:19] the right kind of company that's right
[1:50:22] want to keep them in the right kind of
[1:50:26] place and we want that continuity of
[1:50:28] life that
[1:50:30] atmosphere is what is so important
[1:50:35] amen when it says believe on the Lord
[1:50:37] Jesus Christ I want to drop this in
[1:50:39] because sometimes I know that as I told
[1:50:41] you before and I I think about different
[1:50:43] ones I know that some of you you don't
[1:50:45] have your children setting here with you
[1:50:48] and I always praying I'm asking the Lord
[1:50:50] and looking to the Lord because you know
[1:50:52] when God comes along and speaks to our
[1:50:54] hearts these are things that the Lord
[1:50:56] burdens my heart to speak even for young
[1:50:59] families and young ones coming on even
[1:51:01] for us as examples here in the church as
[1:51:04] older ones of God gave their's a
[1:51:07] position in there for you and I and a
[1:51:10] responsibility but when I I look here in
[1:51:12] this in this portion of scripture
[1:51:15] believe and thine and thy house shall be
[1:51:18] saved there's things that you know
[1:51:20] anybody could go along and let me just
[1:51:22] say this to you
[1:51:23] you every as I said before everyone's
[1:51:26] experience is predestinated from the
[1:51:28] hand of God it that's why a person might
[1:51:32] sit in church for 10
[1:51:34] years before finally it
[1:51:37] comes it's God dealing personally with
[1:51:40] an individual life I don't want to get
[1:51:42] in the way do you I don't I just want to
[1:51:46] be in the right way I don't want to I I
[1:51:49] just want to Lord you work with that
[1:51:50] life Lord you deal with that life let my
[1:51:52] life be an
[1:51:54] encouragement Lord don't let my life be
[1:51:56] a demeaning to somebody else let it be
[1:51:59] an encouraging aware that somebody else
[1:52:02] as they get around me and they get
[1:52:03] around others that there's just such a
[1:52:05] sweetness of the spirit of God you you
[1:52:07] know sometimes we we confuse sweetness
[1:52:09] with compromise and we have that in our
[1:52:11] mind of well bless God we've got to
[1:52:13] stand Rock Solid on the gospel
[1:52:16] listen Sinners love to come around Jesus
[1:52:19] that's right but they hated the fair
[1:52:23] Pharisees that's good that's good is
[1:52:26] that right they hated him Pharisees look
[1:52:29] down on themen but they came around the
[1:52:32] Lord Jesus they wanted to come and be
[1:52:36] where he was at not because he would be
[1:52:38] a good old boy with him but because
[1:52:40] there was something real there was
[1:52:42] something that was real that would
[1:52:45] pulsate from his life that they wanted
[1:52:47] to be around the prophet called that
[1:52:50] atmosphere atmosphere
[1:52:53] beautiful Hallelujah so let me just
[1:52:55] leave this with you those of us you
[1:52:58] that's praying for your loved ones maybe
[1:52:59] they're not setting here the prophet
[1:53:02] would take this up you ain't listen to
[1:53:03] that message thy house in a while my
[1:53:05] what a what a masterpiece brother R
[1:53:07] preaches there in 1962 thy house am and
[1:53:10] he takes that up and he says in that
[1:53:13] message he says when you're praying he
[1:53:15] says you believe for your teenage son
[1:53:18] your older son your older daughter you
[1:53:20] say how do I believe you believe he said
[1:53:22] in the same way for what God has done
[1:53:24] for you that he will do the same thing
[1:53:27] for their life he said let me and this
[1:53:29] is how he this is how he links this
[1:53:30] together he said let me give you a
[1:53:32] little insight into my life brother bam
[1:53:35] how do you stand there on the platform
[1:53:37] night after night and here you are
[1:53:38] praying for people Visions coming
[1:53:41] brother BR says you understand he says
[1:53:43] that is because when he came to me he
[1:53:46] spoke to me told me he'd be with me and
[1:53:49] I believe him wow and so brother br
[1:53:52] takes that same experience that says now
[1:53:55] I've said that cuz that's how you're to
[1:53:58] apply it to your children but God has
[1:54:01] said to you he has spoke to your heart
[1:54:04] he has confirmed his word in your life
[1:54:06] he's confirmed his word in my life but
[1:54:08] brother Samuel I didn't do this I didn't
[1:54:10] do that I didn't do that brother Samuel
[1:54:12] How Will I Know The Prophet takes it up
[1:54:14] in the message desperation How will I
[1:54:17] know when the token has come he said I
[1:54:19] feel that in your minds he said look at
[1:54:22] what what your life was and look at what
[1:54:25] it is now the desires that was in your
[1:54:27] life before are no longer there and he
[1:54:30] said that's how you know when the token
[1:54:33] has come you're not doing something out
[1:54:35] of a legal mandate it's because I love
[1:54:39] the Lord and the desires has been
[1:54:42] changed
[1:54:44] Hallelujah we can stand with an
[1:54:47] assurance and when I'm praying for my
[1:54:49] loved ones praying for my children
