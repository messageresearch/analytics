Lord and oh God that all of this world Lord losing sight around us Lord granted Lord we pray tonight Lord have your way Lord among us now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you musicians thank you amen if you would let's turn to Joshua chapter 1 amen we good night so good to be in the house of the Lord once again and I want to go to Joshua and Joshua 1 we want to read a few verses of scripture and uh I'd like to start with verse three the Lord will help us once again tonight I'd like to just uh continue to approach that subject on overcoming worry overcoming worry sir you know it always there's there's things that are always before us to overcome and uh the greatest the greatest battle that can ever be won is when we have overcome and that great battle on the inside has been won that Victory but then through that that gives us the strength to press beyond all the circumstances of life and you realize brother Brandon will talk about it in the message how can I overcome and he'll speak of overcoming as what we have to press through and then he'll go in another other part of it and deal with overcoming is what we need to surrender to so there's always a pressing there's times when we're going to have to press and there's times where we have to surrender and those are the times that the Holy Spirit just leads us on what to do because the real overcoming is always about our own will and we're always challenged within all of that so the overcoming with the Bible I love how it says that whosoever is born of God overcometh the world Amen and this is the victory even our faith it is didn't say that there would not be circumstances that we would not face but greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world that's our that's our comfort verse three every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee now God never said you wouldn't fail but he says I won't fail there you go that's what's important there you go because with if we're in him we can't fail he said I will not fail thee Amen brother brandom tells us over and over he said if it's my words he said it's a failure to begin with right away he said but if I'm standing here and I'm standing on his words then heavens and earth can pass away but my word shall never fail amen so that's where we're looking tonight is is is to him be strong and of a good courage For unto this people people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest so he he's laying a very very scriptural order that the the real prospering is by the word verse eight this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage I I like that question you know God's asking a question and he's and the question when God asks it he's asking Joshua to consider who is it that's commissioned you you've not been commissioned by just another mortal man you've not been commissioned by a seminary a the you you've not been commissioned by man you've been commissioned by God Lord have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with whether soever thou goest amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated when we look here brother brandham would say it like this and as I was with Moses in this message and he says Joshua in all of this knowing that the command was great but having the Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as we'd call it Reckless as long as he was pointed the right way he might break up against a hill that would knock him backwards but he was carried the right way and so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless and fearless in faith if were're pointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you nor forsake you he never forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us he'll be with us yes sir see God's desire when he sends his word is to drive away all fear and to understand that worry and fear are are not two different things but worry itself is where as we've been looking at to where a concern itself can just really work to overtake it and maybe at some point in time you've dealt with an anxious moment or anxiety or you've had a a panic attack or you've had something that can come your way a doctor's report or something that can be sad and and you there is a challenge that's there before you now just understand this when your soul is redeemed you still live in these other two Realms these outer two Realms are still sin and they can experience the effects and feelings and things that would come our way but that's why it's important to have Jesus Christ in the center of your life that's why it's important to have an anchor that when the storms gets rough and the waves start tossing and all sorts of thoughts and everything else can come and it it looks like you've prayed for something and everything is going in the opposite direction that's what matters who it is that's in your ship because when he's in your ship well that ship's not going to go down because he can't fail he's given his word and his word is sure God has proven it over and over again if we if we looked at just the mortality of man like if Joshua would just maybe if God would have just told him should have been sufficient but God knows how we are even as in our humanness and that doesn't stumble God it never stumbled God when he told Gideon I want you to go down and hear this dream if you're afraid take your armor bear with you god wasn't worried about that he just knew he needs to hear what's going to be said because what will be said if he's there to hear it it'll stabilize him and give him strength for what I'm calling him to do and so when God would tell Joshua very familiar to us but he would remind Joshua that as I was with Moses so will I be with thee he could recall as a Young Man Joshua could recall that as he could look at Moses and he had such a respect for for Moses as God's prophet he knew that Moses was not getting this leadership from his own accord or from the Egyptians but Moses was getting his marching orders from the logos he was following that Pillar of Fire and so Joshua could have that rest and that confidence he had that assurance that even when the rest of the spies Brethren that he went over with 10 to two they were outnumbered with those who said were not able to take it and they spoke of all the obstacles Joshua knew of all the obstacles that was set before him but Joshua was looking at the word like Caleb more than all the obstacles and if you look all around and even when uh uh any time of Promise is presented or anything in your life there's always going to be a lot of obstacles a lot of opposition but in that moment that's to realize the obstacles and the opposition are no match for the Living God if we're standing on God's word those giants that you see those tormenting thoughts whatever it might be if you'll stand on God's word God will bring them right down to size and let you see that he's God over every situation over everything that's in your inheritance he's God yes sir one of the things that here that God would deal with with Joshua and this like I said this is very familiar territory for us but there's always that part that when we deal with and think about overcoming even in worry that you know sometimes the thought can strike and and can move around of of failing and and what if I fail or what if I make a mistake like God moving a on your heart maybe God moves on your heart to send somebody a scripture or moves upon your heart to send them a quote or or to just call them and say I'm thinking about you and then all of a sudden you know you can get a thought well you know is that me am am I in my flesh or or is this or maybe I better not I don't want them and and all of a sudden we begin to wrestle with our own thoughts and our own feelings about things because I don't want to make a mistake I don't want to fail you can never fail or make a mistake when you're standing on God's word are you hearing me you can't do that when we're standing on God's word when we're being moved by God and we're standing on his word his word is a place where there's no failure and so look how it says in Romans 8 verse1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that is a very crucial point we're not walking when we're in Christ we're not walking after the flesh it's not about us it's not about because the desires in our life have been purified they they've been removed our only desire is I want to please him that's all I'm concerned about I want to know what he wants done I I want to walk after him I'm not walking after my own will I'm walking after his desire Hallelujah see that's the great difference of how that God works and he moves within lives and hearts and it's so wonderful because the word cannot fail you see this is why when God spoke to Joshua and Joshua put the word first that was that was the very ingredient for victory is getting the word first and so when the word is first there's a sure promise of Victory when we put God's word first it's the secret to a real successful and prosperous life it's important to put the word above our feelings feelings are not wrong but I want the word to be what allows my feelings to come forth is that right even when we I shout or Rejoice whatever it might be feelings within things even with praying about God's will for things I I don't want my feelings to lead me I want God's word to Lead Me sure I might feel this way but as the prophet said I keep praying I keep looking to God because ultimately when we put the word first you the word cannot fail amen hallelujah now here in the scripture when we think of this within failure and and remember of of failing and all of these things because if we would look at ourselves and and uh focus upon ourselves wow my that would be enough to shake anybody and you can find things that I probably won't even get to tonight and just just tracking the prophet over the commission and looking at things of how that God works to so stabilize a man for what he's called that man to do even in the advancement of life God stabilizes you when he calls you for the next appointment the next chapter the next juncture of life God does not leave you alone he is there to confirm all along every step of the way I'm glad about that aren't you notice here in John 14 and I want to just kind of deal with that word comforter for a minute he says I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you that's good he was announcing to them that the comforter that you're to receive he is with you even now he is standing behind this veil of flesh but he shall be in your flesh that's so good glory did they understand all of that they didn't oh my but you see this is why can man fail yes but God can't fail amen let me tell you something that's why the real you on the inside has never failed a real son and daughter of God that seed on the inside that had that has not been tampered with it's not a product of an Earthly Union that came directly from the loins of God's mind and when you repent you are repenting for allowing that old nature to rule in your life yes this is why the prophet could say when you've come through the washing of Water by the word and the quickening power has come to raise up that seat he said you are Justified as though you never did it in the first place where is the first place in the mind of God you can remember your failures you can remember the things that you did but that seed on the inside that son that daughter of God it never handled a beer bottle it never took a drink it never said a wrong word I'm talking about that genus that came from God hallelujah it who is it then it is the word inside of youall God is Jehovah Gyra he provided a resting place for himself verse 26 and the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things so don't get nervous he he'll give you what you need and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you John 15:26 when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth it's a direct witness not only has he been accepted but you have been accepted in the Beloved God has made one acceptance and when the Holy Spirit has come God has recognized your faith identified you were included in redemption's plan all along and the comforter has now come to solidify that in your heart yes sir beautiful failure how can I fail how can I fail brother Samuel you don't know how many mistakes I make I I'm I said how can you fail now let me take the same word comforter and let me pick it up and use it as it comes in the scripture with another attribute of what the Holy Ghost is in 1 John Chapter 2 verse1 My Little Children these things write I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propetuating where we would have for any students that they wanted to have tested for special needs and they felt that there was learning difficulties and things like that some of the things the test and things that initial Parts um we would administer and sometimes when I would stand in as a principal we would administer those tests we would stand there we would sit in those meetings and then I remember when it would get to certain places with maybe if a child there's certain things that begin to show themselves within over these different battery of tests it it's one of those things that to me I don't want to get political here but the bureaucracy you've got to jump through hoops to jump through another one sometimes you know you could start in September and that child would not get where they needed to get to until April that's right and it just it had nothing to do with us not meeting it just simply is just all of the all of the things you know that do this and do that and so forth but what it is is that when something had had come out that they could see that the the the child itself maybe there was a learning disability maybe there was a different other need that was present they would have then always then within the meeting they would have an advocate one who would be not this Advocate is one who knew what belonged to this parent that's good so they they would be there to watch out you know so you're not putting them in a cuz everything you do with that is always put it to uh placing them in an a least restrictive environment and so everything you do you have to watch all of these checks and things of action plans and those documents and I'm not saying that to get you lost I'm saying it to say say this that there would always be somebody that would be there as an advocate that would know what rights that child had and the parent and would be able to set right along side and and you had to be aware of that they were there to help that that parent along the way now let me say this to you you and I have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous there's sometimes that you might get yourself in a hole and you don't know how to get yourself out but there is one who knows how he knows how to lead you out and it isn't necessarily so much you're in a hole sometimes you get in your mind in different places when you have failed or you fallen short or you made a mistake or something has come about and you have that constantly before you let me just tell you something friends this is why that among Believers are you hearing me this is why that among Believers it ought to be something that we have so established in our heart we ought to be ready to forgive you say why because that's Godlike he said Thou Art ready to forgive Thou Art plenteous in Mercy and you can't do that unless you've experienced it this is why that when you see somebody else fail and you might look and see their error remember that's an opportunity for you to extend the grace of God to them and stand there with the same spirit of God in your life like an advocate and say that's not my brother it's not my sister they didn't mean it Lord don't hold that against them and go on that's what children of God do is that right an advocate because look at look here in the message what is the Holy Ghost the prophet said what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate what is an advocator what does it do it makes an advocate it has Mercy it stands in your place it does things that you can't do it's a propetuating sweet that's wonderful but that's your righteousness if you rest in it in that way well I've not done this I've read so many chapters I listen friends I believe there's something in us that we would get into the word of God but you understand our righteousness is not our own it's his righteousness and when we are in him The Advocate stands as our righteousness he stands for you and I Hallelujah man glory be to God it's your healing it's your life it's your Resurrection it's all that God has for you he's an advocate oh he said how we could go into details and speak of how it makes intercession for our ignorance sometimes when we got the Holy Ghost he said we ignorantly stagger into something and the Holy Spirit is there to make advocate for us that's Hallelujah sometimes the things you know let me just say this sometimes you can look and say you got to be careful because if you look and say how could that brother how could that sister stagger into that well you know what God God works out the rough edges on our lives yes and just be careful that the Judgment that you measure out is not measured back to you because you see there's a molding in a shaping of our character that takes place but when God brings things to our attention and it comes to light and we see it as God sees it then a child of God will quickly stand with the side of the Lord is that right notice the holy spirit is there to make advocate for us he's an advocator he's an attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for oursel because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for us and the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you can't understand understand and he makes intercession for us that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little fell now let's just look at this for a moment when you're little when you're little one you know it gets to a certain time of an age and you've told it don't do this and it goes ahead and it does it you didn't remove them from being your child you don't take them and say goodness sakes you're no longer my child you correct them love is corrective why would you correct them because you know that if they keep going that way that's dangerous and so will God God will correct us now listen friends when we stagger ignorantly into things you see God like a little child here we are there's no desire to do things that's wrong sometimes even where a person is has to realize even of Their Own makeup and how that they're made up and to recognize when sometimes they look and say how do I fall into this or how do I fall into that but you know when you can invite the spirit of God and say Lord teach me Lord teach My Hands to War because I don't want to keep falling in the same in the same hole all the time what is it that's a real son and daughter of God instead of putting blame on somebody else it's looking to God and say Lord teach me amen hallelujah that's so good Hallelujah he's an advocator when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you know when you're when your kid uh your little child when they walk into something and you know ignorantly you hadn't told them well you don't spank them after that you don't spank them if you hadn't told them if they touch it and you say no no that that's hot and and they touch it well you don't spank them because of that but if they get around it again and they you know how sometimes you've seen kids do this where they're they're told not to touch it and they'll do that's right well Grace Grace was there the first time now Grace is going to come in a different measure and it's going to correct you to let you know what I said I meant even though they may not understand it but there's a reason you're doing it for them right is that right you see we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything you say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this don't be afraid we have an advocate oh he stands by us he's in us and he makes intercessions for us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making an advocate for us all the time so not only does he stand there as our righteousness he's there to to to plead on our behalf to make intercession for you and I even at times when we don't even know what to say maybe you're in a situation and you don't you now you can't even get down you couldn't get down on your knees and pray you couldn't walk away and pray but God in the midst of it when your heart looking to God and now the Holy Spirit our Advocate begins to intercede on our behalf maybe that comes upon somebody else's heart to pray for us I don't know how that God will do it how that he does it but I just know that he does it that at times when we have need of an answer have need of Direction when we have need of Deliverance God is faithful and he cannot fail amen now think about how the prophet I like how he puts this uh in the message Jehovah Gyra he's talking about Abraham and how that Abraham you know had raised his hand and you know when he had taken Isaac up to the mountain there up to mount Mariah and remember he had w completely in full obedience to the voice of God and brother BM says it like this I want you just watch how he applies this here he says how that he no doubt could look at Isaac and say farewell my boy he raised his hand and about that time in full obedience even if you're doing something wrong and walking in obedience the Holy Ghost is there to stop you that's so good so God allowed the type to go so far and then God said stay your hand what did that the same spirit of God that led him to take Isaac up there brother Ram says you say I'm afraid if I ever receive the Holy Ghost I might act indecently don't you worry if it's the Holy Ghost he will know when to stop you and when to start you he's got the button in his hand so he knows when to turn on and turn off just throw yourself at his Mercy boy I tell you that ought to throw a lot of worries off right now oh I'm afraid I might this or I'm afraid I might this well I'm afraid I may not be sensitive to him oh yeah come on friends I'm afraid see God knows God knows exactly what he's doing he he works to dispel his fear and as long as we're in tune with him and we're looking to him we put the word first and we're looking to the Lord then the word cannot fail right amen this is why the scripture says in Psalms 37:23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand Psalms 145:14 the Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be be bowed down the scripture records in Hebrews 1:3 who being speaking of the Lord Jesus who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high so there there is no possibility of the word being overthrown you know know the word has never failed right never and the word Can't Fail right remember it wasn't the word that failed in Eden it was one of God's subjects that let down on the word and if Satan remember if Satan can get you to doubt your weapon then he's got you whipped because your weapon is the word it's what the word says not what your feelings say that's so good and The Advocate is there for you not only to stand there and make intercession for what you have done or maybe you fell here or I've fallen in this here and and I made a mistake it's not only there to do that but he's also to do for you what you cannot do to build up in your life to where the things that once haunted you no longer haunt you Hallelujah that's what the advocate's able to do yes sir he does now notice in the message one that he says we know we make mistakes but we mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but it's following his rules and following what he said do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of Duty but if he's off the path of Duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of Duty God's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of Duty yes amen oh my are you catching it tonight it isn't just God sitting down with us and sitting across you know a table from one another with coffee in our hands and saying don't worry don't worry don't worry don't worry don't worry that's not how God does it God God doesn't stabilize has us with just rapid fire of words but God stabilizes Us by his word that's the only thing that can a ever stabilize our hearts is the word of God listen friends that's why even in a service like this on overcoming worry this is where that even in this with failure if you can just say Lord let it drop down to the fifth rib I don't want to just be scriptures and quotes that I'm rejoicing in in I want to rejoice in it but let it so drop inside of me Lord God let it become so a part of me that I recognize Lord that you cannot fail and I can't fail by being in you hallu I might stumble and fail I might fall but he cannot fail and if I'm in him then there is a strength that upholds me that lifts me back [Applause] up that maybe when I feel lower than the padding underneath this carpet there is a strength of a hand that upholds me that lifts me back up and what does it do point me to the way back Hallelujah my my my oh my huh oh my my my my Glory Exodus 14 verse 10 sorry I'm off in another place here oh my maybe the Lord sometime will let me preach a message I spoke there at the youth retreat and dealt with a failing and went through just a Litany of people down through time people who were R rote off and told you'll never be nothing I'm talking about famous athletes I'm talking about people who end up being famous cartoonist yeah that's right come on they were wrote off and said you'll never be anything Walt Disney brother Brandon says it over and over and then you go to start studying it where even there were people that said there ain't nothing you can get out of this right let me tell you something God would allow those examples to be for you and I right okay I'm not going to go through the whole list but you even look at Michael Jordan didn't even make the high school basketball team you might say who's that that's a guy who pounded a a ball with air in it okay that that went around he didn't even make the high school basketball team his first year out but you know what he did he said he looked at that he hung up that where they have the cut offs and they have that where you didn't make the list he hung that every day he worked out he looked at that oh let me tell you something I'm not looking at a bunch of fallible men I'm not looking at a bunch of fallible men in women I'm looking at God's word that says you're not going to make it you've already made it because he already made it and if I'm in him the only thing I have to do is daily and Ming in my life Lord with all of my heart I want to give myself to you if there's things that I'm seeing in my life right now then Lord your grace is sufficient to give me the strength to move Beyond it Lord listen no matter what age you're at you're going to find you need the overcoming grace of God you'll find things in your age right now that if God carries when you're 50 years old you'll need the grace of God to overcome in another part of your life you don't ever get to a spot to say well I can hang it up buddy it's over with let's just let the trophies come in you're going to have to fight every day of your life you're going to have to tell the Devil he's a liar and stand right there on God's word day after day there's times you're going to have to press beyond your own feelings and go beyond your own thoughts and your own ideas but you have an advocate a strength on the inside Hallelujah and you're more than a conqueror hallu overcoming worry oh Exodus 14:10 I thought of this I thought oh my when brother joosu was doing that at testimony wasn't that awesome last week man oh man hallu I think what brother Joshua these these scriptures and I thought my he had them there in one of the closing slides and he was going through I think one of the things like brother justos way we were talking about it he said you know he says what God he said had called me to go through he said he may not have called anybody else to go through he said but God's called them to go through something different that's right but it's just to know he's the same God no matter the circumstance amen aren't you grateful for that amen verse 10 when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in egypt' hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people this is important fear ye not he he was not going to try to go back and try to convince him no he now is a word that comes and let me say this to you this word that was coming it was a word that was coming directly from God's mind yes sir as a matter of fact remember Moses speaks this he's prophesying it's it's not it's not Moses impression see this is why many people asking brother Brandon brother Brandon would you come pray for this one brother Brandon will you see a vision brother Ram said no no you got the wrong idea he said this is not Impressions no right many times he said people God will do something for when somebody one time he said and then here they go under Impressions no we're not they were not going by Impressions Moses wasn't living by an impression this was he was in tune with God and a crisis arose and there was something that Rose from within Moses that spoke to that situation hallelujah how many know what I'm talking about there been things it come out that you don't even know where did that come from it bypassed your reasoning bypassed your thinking Hallelujah I never forget when Benjamin had that that that uh that place on his eye that that tumor it was supposed to be we had already made plans to have that taken out and here my wife nudges me and I I know you may have heard that before but she nudges me to come up front she said you know after they've done everything over at Cleveland Clinic and you know sizing him up and getting ready for everything to take place and she said you why don't we just go up and have him prayed for I said well okay I'll take him up my dad was preaching that night I got up here and the brothers the deacons gathered around us and we begin to pray and as we're praying what came out of my mouth instead of asking God to be with us in the surgery what came out of my mouth and all I could say is I just heard myself saying it thanking God for his healing Hallelujah and I heard myself say that and now you know in your own mind you're hearing yourself and you're thinking why am I saying that right and it wasn't but what was it the next week we were sitting there at the dinner table and I looked over when I got in from work and I wasn't staring at it like oh is it going to go down I'm just telling you you you might think well brother Samuel I don't think you're that spiritual what more Hey listen I'm just being as honest as the day is long right now when that when that was spoken right there but the Lord I I looked over across at the dinner table my my wife was preparing dinner I looked and I said honey that tumor is going down sure enough she went over she said you're exactly right it's going down within what was it two weeks it was completely gone that's not what I did hallah I didn't make that happen that was God in his sovereignty hallu Hallelujah notice this is the same thing with Moses you see this is why it's trusting the Lord that as you're walking with God you put God first God will give you what you need to speak in that moment take no thought what you shall say oh they might try to trap me here they might try to trap me there the boss is calling me in here the union visor this and this and that and but take no thought what you shall say if you put God first you can walk in there and knowing that God is your partner God is standing right there with you he's an advocate when the prophet was standing there and great great intellectual men on a tax case and where they were at and at that moment the Holy Spirit alerted him to propose that question to them and then they seen the error of their way wow yes sir and the prophet you know what I like about it he puts it right back to the word take no thought what you shall say you know what you know what this message did this message did the same thing that every man down through time that caught a hold of the Revelation in their age for their word just like John wincliff when those men and I I can't some of the rest of them tendell and they they would stand there and say we're going to put a copy of this in the plow Boy Pocket why cuz it's important to know your rights those men risk their life so that you and I could have this Bible is that right yes sir standing right there upon God's word that you and I can take this word and applying it to our hearts my they dared against the opposition Hallelujah that's what this message has done the word the gospel was meant to live in in flesh the gospel has never brought a separation between you and God if there's anything that brings anything and I know that's a poor representation but if there's anything that tries to come between you and God the message never brought it am that includes a man's idea when a man wants to try to start interpreting the message and say this is Brother bram's opinion that's brother bram's thought that's a veil what I do move the veil aside because that Veil is a scarecrow are you hearing me this message is either of God or it isn't if it's of God we owe our whole lives to it let me just tell you I'm trying to say it but it's hard to get it out but this word came that it could walk with you down the school Halls this word came that it could walk with you and live in your life those men had a burden John tendel John W William tendel forgive me man I get their names right when they had that burden that was a burden God put upon their life and that's the same burden and it's come in a greater measure in the end time that God sent a message that this word would take on flesh hallu Hallelujah that there's no more fails between you and [Applause] God hallelujah when no man is your absolute but the word of God has been raised to a living absolute in this hour hallu shall I marry this one shall I buy this color of car ask God you're in contact with him come on friends you don't have to ask me what kind of TI is all right to wear I'm not your Holy Ghost come on now lot of freebies coming out of that verse tonight but you see what that does listen to me you know what that does it destabilizes the people when their faith and confidence gets fixed on a man and that's why this message come to put our faith and our confidence in the word of God you know what I'm talking about the denominations can say well they believe the Bible go start tracing them down on certain scriptures start with the godhead start with dress start with other things and see if they believe God's word ask them if they believe Mark 16 amen amen come on Friends amen you see you can't you can't hold this and say you believe all of it and then when there's certain parts of it well you know that's that's uninspired and we no longer need that well then what what means do we need the rest of it then either it's all the word of God or it's not you see I'm talking about overcoming worry hallu I've been burning for months to preach on absolute you can probably tell it's been spilling over for many months now fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord notice see it right so you're not going necessarily just what you're hearing yet you can hear it but when you hear God speaking you'll see it is that right you'll see it that's right is that right yes notice see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace I got to read this Redemption by power I've been sitting on this for a while now brother B said I love it after Jesus rose from the dead his words were constantly fear not that's what's the trouble with the church today is scared to death you're going to make a failure how can you fail when you're in Christ you can't fail you got everlasting life all demons in hell can't shake you you got everlasting life life Jesus said so so don't be scared of failure well I'm I'm afraid I'll get fanatical I'd rather have a little fanaticism than to sit still and do [Applause] nothing come on friends I'd rather you know listen you can't just put it all and get all the quotes and say oh that's Wildfire you also got to have the other set of quotes that says I would rather have a little Wildfire than no fire hallu let me just tell you something I'm not interested what's going on in another man's church I'm interested right here I'm I I and you know what God's called that man for wherever he's at and what he's supposed to do and God's called me here is that all right God knows what our needs are and you know what if there's a problem that arises here then we'll address it but I'm not going to preach in the Pulpit trying to correct another man that's a trap of the devil just preach the word stabilize the people God knows what to bring just as we have need of it because the whole objective in our walk with God is that your life would be stable and that your life there would be free from worry why because God is intent on leading you and building you up to be a full Powerhouse of the Living God that's man that's goodoo glory be to God M that's like kind of like sticking your finger in the H that's good not because me not because me notice notice notice he said I'm told about he said a Ballard's up there you know he said a fellow come to get a job from him and he said sign your name here he took his pencil where's your eraser at you got an eraser on your pencil yeah good answer he said I don't make no mistakes he said I can't use you cuz you ain't going to do nothing if you don't make no mistakes you're not doing nothing let's go brother be up and going don't wait for people to persuade you to Christ stand like a man or lady accept them and walk forward in Victory that's what God wants rugged ready soldiers you might not weigh 105 lbs but you can still be a rdy Brother full of power I think he might be hund now I'm not sure if you'll just let God have his way I've seen men that weighed 200 lb didn't have an ounce of man in them Moses said unto the people fear not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord that's good just march on don't get scared about nothing if you've accepted Christ as your savior go on brother randam I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost just keep moving don't fear I'm sick now brother brandom I can't go much further don't worry keep on moving see the salvation of Our Lord accept it and just move on how's it going to be the doctor turned me down now the fellow done the best he could but God hasn't done the best of his yet just a moment he said look the Lord will show you today for the Egyptians the a the the asay naysayers and the troublemakers say brother brandom if I could just quit smoking if I could just lay down drinking if I could just quit my stealing if I could just quit my doing this that or the other whatever it is that you want to quit don't worry just walk on God will take care of the rest of it Hallelujah if I could quit this quit that look there might be things that you as God deals with your life and God takes a hold of a life and you might know there are things that that I'm doing right now that Lord I I I I it can't continue on in my life well don't sit there and build a campfire on your failure keep walking on with God Amen brother the word has sanctifying power in it the blood has power to cleanse you and set you free Don't Be Afraid good if I know I could do it brother Bram I'd accept Christ right right now don't worry move on just go on you'll see the salvation of the Lord the Egyptians you've seen today you shall see them again no more forever it's going to be settled after a while the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak to the children of Israel that they go forward don't try to say I joined a church 10 years ago brother brandham I've been a good faithful member that's fine I appreciate but let's move on let's keep moving his wonders to perform just let me read this here when you're prayed for being sick you don't have to worry just how God's going to move that cancer how's God going to make that crippled limb come straight notice you don't have to worry about how's he going to do it just go forward in faith that's up to God to take care of that oh my notice the scripture goes on in icus 266 I will give peace in the land and you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and I will rid evil Beast out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and you shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall before the sword I don't read anything in there about failing brother Bron says it like this I'm just I'm just I'm just plugging these bullets in right now I got I got two more bullets ready these are like hoarders when you know something is moving in your heart to find God you don't know no fear you say can I walk brother Bram you really hungry to walk God's putting that in your heart I might make a mistake what mistake God will take you through it don't you never worry that if God is telling you that in your heart Hallelujah Don't You Love am glory be to God what are we doing overcoming worry in the message El Shai let me just read we drop this one we'll drop this one this is not leaflets to the enemy to surrender we're just dropping bombs now doing some Daisy cutter work on him people are scared out of the message El Shad ey oh if I I I I can't I'm afraid I might make a mistake make a mistake you can't don't do no worse than just to sit and do nothing about it get up and be going get the job done make some kind of an effort you've got to move oh I like this part when the Holy Spirit begins to move on a person he ought to walk with his shoulders back and his head up praising God CZ it's God's word it's God that spoke the word it's God that give the promise why don't we just stand and try that if God spoke to you you can put your shoulders back your head up oh I'm not a arant I know in whom I have believed he hadn't made me to be the tail he's made me to be the head God has spoke to my heart you see it ain't about us the word takes our vision away from us and puts it on him and when you get to looking at him you can see nothing but sure Victory because the word has promised Victory you never read in Joshua 1 a promise of defeat God never promised defeat and so when defeat happened when failure came along Joshua never questioned God he went and began to examine himself by the word he was so sure what God had said and God said I'll never fail you I'll never forsake you then Joshua knew God never left us somewhere we went away from him but he said everywhere our foot would tread he give it to us and Joshua went to God and God restored hallelujah amen why the same God that can lead you in Victory through your battles amen is the same God when you put his word first will bring you right back on course amen if you get off course it'll bring you right back on why we're following him we're following him you see that's what the grace of God let's stand that's what the grace of God comes to do and work in our lives is to get our our attention from off ourselves and on him looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith I I I know it's real simple and I don't it don't bother me a bit I I just I I like to preach the things that God puts on my heart that I know will help help his children and we look at things in overcoming worry I don't think there's anything greater that God could do than to make his word real and more real and more sure and there's no way to make his word more sure than when that word is inside of you that's what you that's what you rest on remember God he made his word three times he's raised that word made it positive he spoke it then that word became flesh and now that word is living behind your Veil yes sir God makes his word more positive all the time and that's how he raises the standard against the enemy so no matter even here tonight no matter of where you might be standing I want you to know that the holy spirit is here to stand on your behalf and I want you understand that that a walk with God in a Christian life is not about that you in your own life are perfect now that don't mean that we just you understand that we're not talking about people who get around and say well I can't get over this or I can't get over this no there is a place of overcoming and there is there is a place that where you can you can so move in God to where you can overcome and there is maybe there's things that you're dealing with maybe maybe it's physically maybe it's mentally maybe within your heart you say brother Samuel I've I crossed the Riven Veil where the where the glories never fail but I'm experiencing some things in my life that I need the grace of God for and I need his strength and I believe I'm an overcomer I believe greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world maybe you've experienced some news maybe it's been some depression maybe it's been anxiety maybe there's been some things that comes and the enemy wants to just torment you in your mind I'm telling you there there's an overcoming for that there's an overcoming but first of all you got you got to recognize don't let the enemy start putting you down because of what you're feeling in this realm you're going to experience things in this realm but this is why the Bible said perfect love casteth out all fear fear can come but perfect love says you can't stay here you can't stay here I belong to him amen God moving in your heart whatever the need is when God's moving remember hold your head up right the king of glory himself has stepped down to speak to your heart you can hold your head up shoulders back as a son of the king a daughter of the king you might say brother Samuel I don't feel like much of one no no but look what the word is saying about you that's right brother Samuel I I know I need more of God in my life I need a deeper walk I need I Lord I need the Holy Spirit Well then don't be afraid keep walking you see God listen a pastor cannot bring you in condition no man can bring you into condition but God God's the one who brought Abraham and Sarah in condition to receive the oncoming son that's why the confidence my confidence I'm telling you is in the word of God because the word in the beginning when the conditions were needed for life God spoke and he said let there be light and the first light that ever struck this Earth was the shikina light of almighty God it was the shikina light that broke back the the darkness that's so good it was shikina light that moved to separate it his word is there to change the conditions so that what conditions are needed to be met I can't me it on my own but God's word will bring and create the conditions that's needed for him to fulfill his word thank you Father that's why that even in every service listen friends I got confidence that God there could be somebody walk off the street right here tonight and God could take everything right here tonight fully baptize that that person right into the body of Jesus Christ it's it's a paradox then there might be someone that maybe just been coming service after service but they're making footsteps and there's a desire within their heart to serve God that's why we don't we don't judge one another we don't Jud judge I don't take my experience and judge you because God works with you in a personal way because you know when it's all said and done you're the one that's got to have that confidence that I've met God God speaking to my life you see that's where it goes beyond that of a words of a man it's not a man telling you you know God speaking to your heart you know that it's God dealing with your life you know that the word's Discerning your heart that's why you're not walking on a false confidence you're walking on the confidence of his word his voice that has breathed inspiration into your life it's God and God's creating the conditions that's needed even right here tonight yes he whatever the need is in your life whether it's for the Holy Ghost whether it's to overcome in some some area of your life maybe it's to overcome and lay aside a weight something that's been slow you down maybe it's a besetting sin but you know what his grace is [Music] sufficient let me just tell you tonight you're more than a conqueror through him who loved you I can do all things through him who strengtheneth me he's here to energize your faith Hallelujah oh I say tonight Lord let every bit of worry a failure a failing let let let me let me just look Lord let me just see you who cannot fail amen that's what this masterpiece is it's him who cannot fail and if I'm in him I can't fail because he can't fail true Hallelujah let's pray father Lord You're so mindful of our needs Lord Lord how we are thankful that you are mindful of Lord even the things that we would go through in our life and throughout this journey how I'm so grateful Lord for our advocate so thankful Lord that we've got an advocate it Lord Jesus Christ the righteous Lord God for every need that's here Lord tonight father whether it's for healing maybe there's just been Lord God a a worry a fear maybe Lord there's been one that they've looked Lord across their life and they found themselves failing Lord in the past maybe that little thought was whisper in right now maybe they've been dealing with that Lord of you're going to fail again this is just you but oh God may you breathe Lord God upon their life give to them what they would need Lord God beyond that of the Mortal voice of a mortal man Lord May the voice of God Speak Lord God father Lord to the hearts Lord to the lives Lord I pray that Lord Lord to encourage hearts Lord that Lord are standing Lord with a request Lord maybe it's a wait to be laid aside maybe it's a besetting sin Lord God that Lord that has been found again and again Lord that so easily to be said a May Lord I pray tonight Lord oh God worry be dismissed and realizing Lord to keep walking forward Lord may it be the moment Lord God that father that you bring to the realization in their life they're free they're free Lord the things that Lord God that they once look back over their shoulder they're free Lord I pray for even those that's not here
