I'm washed in the blood of the [Music] hallelujah what a wonderful reality amen amen and we thank God for his mercy and uh so glad to be able to be gathered together here once again and we certainly want to remember different ones in prayer I know that uh I had received a text here earlier today from Brother Rocco he wasn't feeling too well and I know that uh there's been some others and just the sickness and I heard that request um for Sophia there and I know there's it's just been kind of making its way around uh you know so we just want to just continue to hold up one another in prayer um also to I think you I think you may have mentioned it too there's um those that are on their way back from the winter youth retreat there in Tennessee and I know just scattered around just driving from there and uh um my wife uh also she's she had been a little bit under the weather and uh the Lord has been giving her strength but she had to go pick up Paul tonight so at about that time he was traveling back with brother Jesse and uh because Ben has other reasons to stay in Tennessee a little bit so so you know just the wonderful things too too bad we just can't take a car and just drive drop it to them you know how it is and so um but um so we just want to remember one another in prayer and um so glad to have uh my mom and brother Bill here back with us from Tennessee and uh amen we we sure miss them and you know we we we miss each of you we just don't say that you know sometimes you know I can't put my finger on who's missing because once everybody gets s seated in the back I I don't know I think if we ever replace the pews we'll just have 10 chairs sitting in the back let's have three back rows with 10 chairs but you know different ones of you set in different places and I can pick it out but then there's other times I'm looking and I'm thinking uh man was so and so there was so and so there and and this and I begin to think about that but we certainly want I mean that we miss you when you're not here amen and uh you know we're we're a family we're a body of believers amen so let's just we want to turn right into the the word of the Lord tonight and want to say thank you musicians God bless you um I want to the Lord would help us and I ask you to forgive me on Sunday uh my wife mentioned to me afterwards I got in the car and she said honey I was trying to get your attention she said but um you're um she said the slides and so I had everything here but I was preaching as though you were seeing them and so there's certain words that that emphasis you know that I would like to place on certain things that I just F on my heart as we come into it so I I sent we sent that email out with the slides and uh if any of you ever want the slides after we've done with it I'm it's just a simple click for me to get them and PDF them to you um but I know a different one saying hey we were trying to write things down we didn't know where you were referring to so so I certainly apologize for that um but um Lord may the Lord help us I think I caught it Midway through the service and I thought as though that Brianna had taken off the screen or something happened what happened here and so but anyhow I think we've got it straightened out amen don't you love technology when you can keep up with it and when it works it's wonderful so let's look here in the in the scriptures here tonight and we'd like to look at if the Lord would help us on this thought again on a savior and in the scriptures here tonight we want to read from Job chapter 26 and and verse verse 1 through verse 4 and job job speaking here he says how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength and how hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou pleni declared the thing as it is and to whom hast thou uttered words and whose Spirit came from thee if you read throughout that chapter you recognize job is is really putting before them the great oversight of God that is beyond the understanding of just man but he's bringing a point to them just how the Lord's been just pressing on our hearts to when we look at things is we we want to be a channel that God could use and it just to put it as maybe as a simple illustration I can this microphone that I put on each time before I come out the microphone does not come out here with a thought of what it's going to say the microphone has not studied it has not it a matter of fact it has nothing to say but the microphone itself is only a channel that whereby that a voice can come behind it and then that can be carried out to you and I and that's just exactly where we want to be as Lord I want to be that kind of a vessel and that kind of a channel we I tell you it takes the grace of God so that our our human Spirit isn't mixed in at all and that's just that's a that takes the real touch of the Holy Spirit Lord help us to just be so delivered into your hands and God knows how God knows just how to work and condition and move in our lives so let's just look at him look to him in a word of prayer tonight Heavenly Father Lord we are just so thankful Lord that you've made a way that we are able to be here and be gathered tonight Lord I know in in different parts lord of the state with certain things Lord with flurries and some snow Lord I just ask God for your hand of mercy and protection we ask God that Lord that you would just be over it all Lord we pray that Lord as we have gathered here tonight may you come in a special way Lord and just God give Grace that the man part could just get out of the way and that you could come Lord and just speak to our hearts Lord according to the needs Lord that we have Lord there's inspiration that comes that I Lord have Lord laying here before me but Lord ultimately it always comes down to Lord that that inspiration and you leading us Lord that we might Minister Lord to what the needs are that's Among Us Lord so we just want to commit ourselves Lord speaker and hearer together that father you would be glorified in our midst tonight Lord may you minister to each life in a very personal way and give us Grace to step aside Lord we pray Lord be with those Lord as the request have been lifted up Lord for those that are suffering in their body Lord with sickness Lord I pray that God that you'll just touch Lord each one in a special way may the angel of the Lord visit each of them Lord right where they are oh God God may you watch over those that's on the road and traveling we pray father we just Commit This service Lord and all that would be said and done into your hands For Your Glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I want to uh very quickly we I want to just come back into this place on on a savior and I'm going to go through uh some scriptures uh before I just try to Spring Forward here just a little bit but it's very clear that when job was expressing here uh to to the Brethren uh that were gathered there and you know they as we've said over and over I believe they had really good intentions but they lacked discernment and so there's sometimes you know the Bible says let us be uh Swift to hear and slow to speak that's usually a favorite scripture of brother Gomez's uh almost multiple times you know he'll repeat that to me and so uh you know it's something that is sometimes you know we can feel pressed as though uh we must say something or we must do something and we always want to be sure that it's God leading us and not us feeling under the pressure of uh somehow condemnation if we don't say something God knows exactly what he's doing he knows exactly whether it's to someone who does not know the Lord at all whether it's someone who's walking maybe in a little lesser light or maybe it's another brother or sister that's right here gathered Among Us or in another assembly God knows just exactly what you and I have need of sometimes it's a word sometimes it's just an ear sometimes it's just a heart sometimes it is just it's just enough just being present will say so many things how many of you probably have come to maybe a funeral or you've went to visit someone in the hospital and without even saying a word when you got there it was just your presence said enough and it was just an encouragement and so we know within this of looking at a savior we understand that it's not in our it's not in our power of for one human to save another human but there's only one Savior and that's God God is our savior and I want to just quickly go back through a couple scriptures and move forward from there as we look at this that it's God he he is our savior we're not we're not looking at you know by the grace of God through the opening of the word in this hour where the real true mystery of the godhead has been restored to the Church of the Living God that we're not you know we're not looking and seeing three persons three personalities but we recognize it is God who is above us God With Us it's God in us and that's a glorious Revelation that you find that it just it it never ceases it continues to be repeated all the way through because it is the truth from almighty God himself even when the prophet would stand there in uh in the first seal and declare that and and say you know is the Lamb has the book in his hand he said and here he is revealing these things he said and to understand that it is God himself that is actually revealing this and our Revelation is that it's not two or three separate persons but it's one one God and that's powerful because remember brother brandham said in his earlier days he said he always thought God was angry at him and Jesus loved him he said but then I come to find out it was the self-same person amen so notice in the scripture God has has designed this that that the strength and virtue of his own life would flow through the body and so when we look here in the scriptures Jonah says by inspiration salvation is of the Lord in Isaiah 43:11 I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no Savior and Isaiah 45 and if we just skip down there a little bit and it says and there is no God else beside me a just God and a savior and there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth Earth for I am God and there is none else in 1 Timothy 2:3 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth so it's it's God's desire that all would be saved that there would not be one that would be lost but God has a complete and perfect will knowing those who will will be saved and those who will be lost so his choosing is not something that he's doing in time but his choosing was already from before the foundation of the world and it was not choosing something that was not a part of him but God chose that which was always a part of him of in the loins of his mind of his children and so to think that when God coming he's coming to save what already belonged to him to redeem and so to think that attribute itself of Savior you know it was there within God but in order for that attribute to be released the prophet takes us in the church ages and he says it was then God could not God could not make the man to fall he said but God created and placed that man on the agency a free moral agency gave him a choice and when the man made noise says God knowing all knowing that man would make the decision that he would make then he said it would release that attribute of Savior and this is a powerful statement it would give him then reason and purpose of being that to me is a powerful statement in there it it sets it it sets it to the reality that God God is interested in revealing and manifesting his attributes not as though it's something that's like we would look at artwork on a wall and my isn't that marvelous but God manifest his attributes by taking upon his word and making that word to come to pass and as that word is coming to pass there are lives that are tied into that word from before the foundation of the world and experience the effect of the of God God's own life moving through that word touching their lives it's a it's a channel it's like I was talking about before of that extension cord that's plugged into this source and it reaches somewhere else it's not the extension cord that has the electricity it only carries it it's like the wires and and the outlets in the wall they only they only carry it they're not the electricity and that's the same thing for you and I it's that we're not God but here we are together in the body of Jesus Christ and it's God working through our lives so when we see this as he said God our savior Paul would write of this over and over in that specific phrase God our savior and he would say who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth that indwelling of God's life for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus and and you know remember uh brother BR says where Satan I want you just let me just pause here for a minute remember when brother Brandon would tell us in Christ The Mystery of of Christ The Mystery of God and he would get on that part of Trinity and he'd said Satan has told you those lies to make an idolator out of you you recognize Spirits travel with words this is why the spirit of God this is why where the word is preached the spirit will travel with it this is why when songs about the blood are sung the spirit travels with it so so the spirit this is why in the beginning when God said let there be light the spirit traveled with the word and this is why that the preaching of the word of God that Revelation as God would drop that Revelation for what you and I have need of taking from the open book and ministering in season what we have need of it's God's unction and God's Life coming to meet the challenge and to minister to you and I for what you and I have need of in this hour there's no doubt setting in this congregation that either tonight or we have testified of it or will if God carries where we've come and sat here as the word is coming forth and maybe overwhelmed in our minds overwhelmed with cares of Life overwhelmed with different situations and we've been saved for years filled with the spirit of God and yet God comes down and saves us not the saving of our soul but he delivers us from the grip of anxiety of depression of of gloominess of Mind battles he comes because he is Our Savior and I'm so grateful for that because if if I could help myself I wouldn't need him and that's why the prophet said the most godd dishonoring proverb is that God helps those who helps themselves he said that's the most God dishonoring he helps those who cannot help themselves I don't I'm just here tonight to say it I need him I need him not only as I stand here but I need him every day of my life I need the grace of God the quickening power to bring this word to pass and to express and live this word hallelujah who do you think it was that came to the prophet when he stood there beside uh the bedside when his little girl was being taken his wife was being taken and everything that Satan was saying and at that time he said I was about ready to say if that's how he's going to be but something he said rose up from within me who was that God our savior it was down on the inside when all reasonings had broke away reasonings was already going along with where the serpent was hissing but that genuine birth on the inside that typos it cannot Unite with unbelief it is Faith In God's word and what is it it's God our savior thank you Jesus Hallelujah so it's not this is why when the anointing of the the word has come it does not it does not uh when the word is being ministered and the opening of the word we don't see C we don't see we don't see three persons we see God being revealed from from there from Spirit to flesh and now once again return back into a body of Believers we see the same God all along hallelujah thank Father and sometimes I I I just just as I fell on my heart just to just de pressing just to mention that as it would come to me because sometimes these things we I don't want to say we willfully but we can take for granted and sometimes with young people and others and new ones that we have coming in and things like that it it is is absolutely essential to recognize that the same Holy Ghost is God himself that came down and took upon the form of humanity that he might redeem you and I back to himself amen none of so notice he says who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time God took a man took the agency of man and God operated through that agency of man in order to be a savior look at what happened there in the Garden of Eden God would have slew would have wiped Eve off but Adam stood there in the Gap in that moment when when God would have destroyed her and he stood there and he could stand there and he took her unto himself he became a savior for her how did that happen by his own life being in her how does how does this reality of Savior become to the highest and the greatest depth is when his life is dwelling inside of you and I to understand say yes he came to save us but he also the blood goes deeper for a deeper work of sanctifying power he goes to a deeper work to the very seal of the spirit of God and it keeps working to bring children of God to full maturity it's God working all along amen I'm glad about that aren't you he gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time in 1 Timothy 4:10 for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe acts 5:30 the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins it was the complete sacrifice God come down and took upon flesh God came down he showed it all in typed down through the Old Testaments as he would come through the prophets but this is Jesus was not just a prophet he is the god Prophet God come down and tabernacled for Redemption and the prophet would say it like this an unveiling of God he has come this time with the Redeemer anointing upon his life it was reconciling reconciling drawing uh all men God through that work was reconciling all men unto himself and remember if Paul said he has committed unto us the word of reconciliation we are ambassadors of of Christ we are ambassadors now notice Paul goes on to write here in Titus 3:3 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient Ian deceived serving divers lust and Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another that that's where we were living that was our address right there but notice but after that the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared the appearing God coming down and notice this this appearing not only God come down and he tabernacled within within the body that he himself had built by his own word but now this same God is tabernacling and appearing before the Church of the Living God in redeemed vessels it's appearing is God appearing in life have noticed how Paul says by through the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us I'm glad for that aren't you it wasn't about that we were worthy you could read that in the opening verse the scripture said that he died for the ungodly while we were yet sinners right so it was not something so notice notice within all of this a savior is not one who is coming and and somehow measuring who who is meat to be saved but rather it's coming with a heart and that desire and it's leaving it into the hands of almighty God God himself when he came down here among you and I he already knew who would reject him he knew who would accept him he even knew who would walk all the way up to John 666 he knew all of that but he even knew that Judas at the end would turn around and betray but it did not hinder the showing of love and kindness because that love and kindness being projected the Lord he knew there were those it was intended for and they would be accepted God already knew when he sent this message in this generation he already knew who would accept it who would embrace it that's why we're not working as though to try to make converts into Christianity by the message of the hour We're simply just ministering the word letting our light shine and let God do the work if there is a seed on the inside of there and I believe there is if there is then God will Quicken [Applause] it you understand what I'm saying right we're not trying to you know another movement to where we're getting people with everybody's got to dress this way and do this listen when we speak of dress that's according to the word of God that's been restored to us the message of the hour did not all of a sudden it wasn't a it wasn't introducing of things that were new but the message of the hour is God himself the very intelligence of God come down in a prophetic Ministry to show you and I the Lin the ends that were laid loose down through the scriptures and it restores it it's not something new it's the loosening of the word and the veil upon the eyes of the people and you know what that does it has an anointing oting with it it has an anointing that brings confidence it brings strength because you're looking at an open book which is a mirror and you see yourself as God always saw yourself nothing brings strength like that my we could say amen and that'd be good but notice notice what he did by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost let me go on not notice how R says this and I I ended with this the last time brother Ram says in God's gifts always find their place he said he come to redeem the whole creation and nothing could do it but God himself so God came to redeem the whole creation so that Redemption is not just of humanity but remember this Earth it's a redeemable attribute of God it's come through its water baptism it's come through that of the beginning of sanctification where the blood was spilled upon it it'll come it'll be a finishing of that sanctification as it goes all the way through the time of the Millennium and then here it will they'll come that it'll get its baptism of fire in the future home it's already it's a testimony but you see notice what God does God prepares the subjects he makes subjects ready for the place that he's preparing notice he come to redeem the whole creation and nothing could do it but God himself that's the reason that God does nothing outside of man he always works through a man because he had to use a man I want you to just lock on to that he always works through a man because he had to use a man God doesn't stop working through man is God's working he's still working in the agency even after a message has gone forth now that light has come and that light now moves through the body and it's the light of God it's God working through the agency of man that word because because without that we would be running with a message of somebody else but God sees fit that the message that we're to carry is not a message where our minds have been reprogrammed that's what denominations do they program a man to a certain way but that's not God's way God don't program man by their mind God his program is that his Spirit would dwell inside of you and I and it would be the holy ghost that would carry this word that's why though when the New Birth has come you are a witness you are a messenger of the same Covenant Hallelujah I think what greater of a witness that could be placed out there than a life that's been snatched out of the fire a life that God has totally cleaned that life up and God himself moved mes through that life and that vessel and it's undeniable it's God he always works through a man because he had to use a man a man is what he had to use to display look at this his attribute of savior he had to use a man in order to display that attribute of savior he couldn't use it he couldn't use a son couldn't use the Stars couldn't use the moon in order to display this attribute he took a man brother BR goes on to say he had to make him in his image make him something like him put him on free moral agency let him act any way he wanted to he could take his choice and he knew that that man by giving him his choice would fall so being that he had to do that he turns back around and makes the man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through a man oh my the whole work of Redemption come by a man right but same I thought we were just reading God is our savior it is God he is our savior but he had to display that attribute through a man and that man is the man Christ Jesus and that didn't stop there the Bible said in Acts 1 verse one all great theopus all that Jesus began to do and the prophet picks it up in the token and says and continue continued to do and he says his death didn't stop him it was only the loosening now it's coming into the body and it's that same life that's working oh my the whole work of Redemption come by man death come by the first man life come by the second Adam there you are he does nothing because he had to use man for that then he uses a man to redeem back again so deity became become Jehovah he says or become a child he become in the form of sin that he might redeem The Sinner there's the whole thing I'll tell you you talking about humility right there almighty God the great deity he became a child God was able to seow condens sin in order to create a blood cell and wrap himself in it and then come forth God works through man so this is what I want to begin to just I want to just take from where we were at there and let just let's just move back into scripture here just a little bit as we're looking at this because when job was saying how save how savest thou him that hath no strength so how how can this be done unless it God be present to work through the man so it's God working through man notice in the Book of Judges chapter 2 it says nevertheless the Lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them and when the Lord raised them up judges then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppress them and Vex them now remember within this of the Book of Judges this was a you know a time that God would raise up as the scripture said judges and you'll see here in a moment in the scriptures where it is declared that God operated he worked through those vessels as saviors because Israel was in a situation of here they were you know where they were being oppressed and uh you know things were what belonged to them was not taken from them the things that that belonged to them uh the enemy just come in and take it you know and and they were just a a trodden people but they weren't always that way the only way that Israel came into this kind of a condition is when they got away from the word right right you know I I've mentioned this before but it's very very very key because in this book it's mentioned twice in the Book of Judges that every man did what was right in his own sight and when we look at that it's very clear because these are men that when you look in the Book of Judges the the word Moses is only only mentioned four times and you would think well why why do they have to mention Moses why why would they have because God when he gave the word to Moses he said I'll bring them out and take them in it's a full message when God restores to Israel when he restores them back it will be a fulfillment of Prophecy that even God spoke when they crossed the Red Sea and Moses spoke under prophecy of how God would plant them in the land it would be a planting by God with the spirit of God moving in them to seal 144,000 that then when it returns back in that time of the of the future home there will not be any tearing down it will not be any removing God's word is still in fulfillment tonight he's not forgotten One Promise Israel there was types where they were planted but then here Israel would go astray but God himself knows how to plant in the time and in the season of when his life is come into the body so notice God would operate through these judges and sometimes Within These judges you find how God would operate through the different ones but here's one thing that was always key within this God would raise up saviors by his word according to his word and it would be God working through them to prove his word and what he thought of his word toward Israel remember Israel was in the shape because they got away from the word little by little by little this is our Authority is staying with the word even when our even when we we we don't have any feelings about it but staying with the word of God come on can we Fellowship on that there's sometimes when we don't feel very spiritual sometimes in keeping parts of the word we don't feel spiritual and we've got to press Beyond the flesh we've got to press beyond the pressures press Beyond ourself Lord but his word if if was stand with that word then listen as we're standing with the word this is not the word of a man that will crumble and fail this word is thus saith the Lord and when we walk with thus sayith the Lord walls come down ahead of us God is a way maker when we stay with thus sayith the Lord cuz it's not about us it's god making a way for himself so notice in in in here even when God remember when he raised up Gideon this was a this was very much a great key when God would raise up Gideon remember Gideon didn't feel that he was worthy as a matter of fact Gideon was in his own self he was afraid right uh you know he had experienced that you know like you know shamgar had experienced many times the enemy coming in and taking what they had sown and and you know they had they had planted and watered it and about the time of harvest here the enemy would come in and brother BR begins to talk about how that Satan sometimes will do a family he said Satan will do a church sometimes he said but you know when shamgar had come into that place and he he remembered what he remembered was he remembered what he already was he did not become a son of Abraham with a covenant he already was a son of Abraham he already had a covenant sometimes friends that this is what the listen this is what the gospel is all about it's not bringing something new to you it's to reveal to you who you are what belongs to you the rights as a child of almighty God you've got a covenant as a son and daughter of almighty God you're not some trotting down nothing but you are a son and daughter of God hallelujah hallelujah this is what the word came to do is to minister a Salvation the word had already come through the prophet but the angel of the Lord that accompanied The Prophet's Ministry stayed after the prophet went off the scene and he found Gideon and when he found Gideon Gideon did not think he was anything different than just a man but when he began to deal with him he come to a place to finally Gideon had got to this place here when he makes a statement and you know here he is he's looking at himself wherewith shall I save Israel that's right you're looking at himself how can I how can I do this behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I'm the least in my father's house God's got to break the complex around his life because it's one thing to have humility and then it's another thing for a complex to get in the way of humility that will lower itself under the word of God and say be it unto me according to Thy word so God is a tremendous you get in the presence of God and God just his presence just opens up and what it's doing is it's taking everything away from our life is is's dismantled because we didn't understand it these are things sometimes I hope I can say this that sometimes my family is poor Manassa I'm the least in my father's house that almost comes back like lonus blanket with Charlie Brown it's become something like a bottle or Pacifier that we feel safe with but God wants to let us know no that was meant to hinder and injure you I am your savior you don't have to resort back to a hurt or a complex or something else I am your savior I'm greater than your family straight you're a part of me Gideon hallelujah hallelujah and the Lord said unto him surely I will be I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man this was the key of God taking raising up to his word by his word saviors is it would be lives that would be one with his word and so God would operate with that Oneness through the man now watch this in the book of Nehemiah chapter n Nehemiah picks this up I love this nevertheless Nehemiah rehearsing this time we're talking of they were disobedient rebelled against thee talking about Israel cast thy law behind their backs slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocation they done enough to be defriended ohoo y'all this bring it down to present tense language is it they got enough to be drawn out of the circle is that right so they got a enough they got enough to receive you know silent treatment and it isn't that God himself when I want to say he was not silent in the way that we are silent but God was silent when they walked away from his word he is his word and there is no other voice but the word my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow is that right so notice here therefore thou delivers them into the hand of their enemies who Vex them so God he delivered them he turned them over into the hand of their enemies but he never lost one right right and in the time of their trouble when they Cried unto thee thou Hest them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies who gave him saviors God gave him saviors because it's an attribute of himself that when lives would get in trouble when distress would come and when they would repent of their ways then God delivered a savior listen friends the same way with you and I when our lives and our heart got to a place to where God ministering to our lives to where it would bring us to a place to where of surrender and recognize we're nothing you watch the Savior manifest himself at that time he's not standing there to condemn but he's standing there after conviction has struck the heart of an individual that he stands there to minister to you and I I am your savior and God will take he'll always come in the form of his word he'll always save by his word so God will take whatever whatever he choose to take whatever text because there's not one more word God and another word not God the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so it's always God manifesting himself by his word now notice when Israel coming into this that like the scripture said they could they could fail they would they would fall back they would fall but all this was types that was laid all the way through there wish I could go through and just just begin to preach on some of them Esther and different ones but notice there was coming the promise of what God had promised for he said in Luke Chapter 2 for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a Manger in Matthew 1:21 she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins you see what's he doing he's coming for his people with his mind on his Covenant this is why even when he descends in Revelations 10 with a little book open the rainbow about his head his mind is on his Covenant his word that's why that that that that this message and and and the coming of the Savior notice within it he shall save not his people in their sins but save them from their sins not in but from he's a deliverer this is the only one that not only can take all of the all of the condition away but he himself is able to minister the full strength of Salvation that deals with the very nature that caus man to do it in the first place he shall save his people from their sins oh elections all the way through the scriptures predestination all the way through the scriptures he came with a purpose oh my that's why this message it's a message of purpose it's not aimless wondering it's a message with a purpose we're looking at the coming of the Lord we're face to face with the Rapture it is a purpose the church is not aimlessly wandering with soup suppers and everything else we are purposeful for the coming of the Lord looking for that last one that's why we do what we do that's why we reach out that's why we encourage one another we are people with a vision and a purpose with the coming of the Lord and like Mori told Esther if you don't do it God will raise up deliverance from another area we have been mandated by the mighty Angel God help us amen now unto him look at the strength of this unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and majesty and dominion and power both now and ever amen now I want you to think of this here we just read of how God came down to display that attribute of savior he had to use a man to display that through now for that for God remember remember he's got to undo what was done in Eden remember what took place to fall in Eden this is why that even when you when you go to speak with others and you know sometimes you know it's always been been a struggle with people with serpent seed and it's really it's not among even amongst of the ancient rabbis but you find different ones and it comes down to this question why did it have to be a virgin birth that's just a question just you can drop that question and walk away why did it have to be a virgin why was that the specification why was it a virgin birth because it had to be separate from the sexual blood that was already polluted right this is why Peter calls it the blood of Christ right is that right this is why in The Book of Revelation it tells us that we have been loosed with a perfect uh perfect loosening through his blood and that it says in Hebrews 13 that not like Abel's blood Abel's blood called out against Cain and said he's guilty he's guilty he did it he he's guilty but this Blood speaketh better things and the prophet picks it up in the token he said this blood does what Abel's blood couldn't do he said this Blood says you old Cain you've been a b make believer but why don't you come on over under the blood and I'll Transform you once and for all oh don't look at me funny you brush can's teeth you comb Cane's hair but on the inside there's an able that's able is that all right here we have this cane we got this Ishmael out here but on the inside is the child of the promis and it's the child of the promise that sometimes we've got to put this guy out and say you know what you're not going to sit here and torment me this way you're not just going to take in every little thing but we're I'm putting what are you doing I'm silencing your voice oh my you realize that was an authority that Sarah came to Sarah came to that place of an authority not not disregarding her husband she wasn't she wasn't a dominating female that was under sari but once the word had come and God had breathed upon her life and changed her life when the word came forth through her life then Sarah came to a place and she realized when she saw ishmail taunting Isaac she's the one that told Abraham Abraham break away from just your human compassion and remember be tied to the word he cannot go on with the son of the promise said brother Samy you you're paraphrasing adding words I I'm I am but I'm not you you get what I'm actually saying she spoke with authority that was speaking to when the bride you and I as the Bride of Jesus Christ begin to recognize the things that are around my life that's hindering that's tormenting that's dragging down the child of the promise I put it out of the camp it can't be in my camp in my life any longer it's hindering it's hindering Isaac thank Hallelujah oh my now think of this God used a channel by the name of Mary brother Bram says it like this and God's gifts always find their places same message he said Mary the mother of Jesus in the city of Nazareth the meanest City there was in the land but out of there God chose a little lady to give birth to his son an incubator a womb a baby had to be born by he took such a pro person to do it God works through human beings to redeem human beings he can take you work through you to redeem Humanity if you'll completely dedicate everything you are God works through human beings in order to redeem human beings remember like the extension CT we don't pack it's not us it's the it's not us that that causes the electricity but we just want to be hooked up to the source because if you're not hooked up to the source you cannot impart electricity right if you get a little short along the way something comes up unconfessed sin or get a grievance or Grudge or what more it'll Kink it right but this is where there's got to be that repair why so the channel can flow now watch brother BR says if you're a young woman dedicate your morals if you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your mind dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all you are and let Christ work through that what a glorious thing yes amen listen well I I I'll go down another pathway it'll be another be another service but we want to we want to dedicate dedicate all that we are giving ourselves to him daily Moment by moment even in our mind sometimes you wonder why the things sometimes in our mind and we can search back but if we just look and say God let my mind be filled with the things of God I know we have our jobs we have other things but you know sometimes If we're honest sometimes we we can allow things either of the job or happenings of the family and other things we can allow it to dwell instead of taking all of that and committing it to him is that right then sometimes there can be things on our mind of of this to take our mind and you know it can be pleasure and other things else but remember if we'll dedicate our mind I tell you if we can just take that part of it dedicating our mind you'll watch the we'll watch the effect of it through every other area of our life because the word it enters in through the Mind first and it's not positive thoughts it's the positive word coming in the channel of our mind and it's the word that has life in it so the Greater Works this is what we're we're talking about the Greater Works this is what was promised to the Church of the Living God remember Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father brother Braham comes into that day on Calvary he said the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and giv into the hands of the church to impart life that's what Calvary meant he says watch this this is powerful he took stoop degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life now when brother R speaks of this this isn't me or you going up to somebody else and say I give you eternal life there's a prescription brother B goes into this same message and he said this is where the Catholic Church got off where where they themselves begin to take whosoever sins you remit to them are remitted whosoever sin you retain to them that are retained he said that's the truth but where the Catholics got off is they said I forgive your sins right a church can't forgive sins God is the savior it's God who pardons it's God who forgives the church is only an agency that points to a finished work and that heart recognizes that there has already come a sin Bearer for me he was crucified for me he suffered for me he bled and died for me he raised up on that Easter morning for me he ascended on high and for me he sent back the Holy Ghost and so that imparting of Life comes through the word how is that repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins Our Savior that's the Greater Works because brother BR points it out he says you could pray for the sick and the sick be healed but he said that's not the that's not what the scripture was promised of the Greater Works the Greater Works was that life that eternal life that would pass through the body this is this it was God's own life this is why friends that that life itself that the Holy Ghost Jesus said that the Holy Ghost he said the father would give it in my name it comes through the ministering of the word listen when I say even the ministering word a person can be setting and can be you know reading can be listening even into the message and reading and here they are they're they're in tuneing and uity with God I got many examples I could go into that the prophet pulls from but what it is is they've made contact with God in a personal way and this is why it can't be another Jesus because God God doesn't want us to take a name of a fallen condition right he don't want us to take the name Baptist that's a fallen woman he don't want us to take the name Pentecostal that's a fallen because when Eve she got the name Eve is when she had already fallen but God was God's desire is that we would bear His Image his likeness and it's him operating through his body it's him that was even telling as this life was moving it was him that even told Phillip when here in Samaria think about this Philip has ministered here in Samaria demons have been cast out the sick had been healed these people they were in a place they were ripe for the Holy Ghost to fall and God picks Phillip up and takes him down there to Samaria takes him down there to join to this unic right I believe Samar I believe I got that right I may but you you understand what I'm saying he takes him to join him down there but notice God brings Peter and them down from Jerusalem and Peter and them lay hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost it wasn't that Peter was the only extension cord he was a part and tapped into the body but God was showing in that it's not a Onan Ministry any longer it is a body it is a oneman Ministry in terms of there is one man by this man Christ Jesus it's a oneman Ministry in that God sends a message to an age and the people of that age are birthed under the light of that word and it's Christ that is flowing through the body Hallelujah absolutely listen the word has an effect the word won't return void this is aware that within it I want you to think of this here with Rahab I'm going to I'm going to close on this I want you to think with Rahab here for a moment I want you to think what she did the prophet said she made her house a place to receive the message now brother Brandon wasn't just speaking there if we read the full quote brother Brandon was not speaking there that she just became somebody who would just playing tapes in her house but he's he's bringing it down she made her house a dwelling place to receive the message because it's got to go more than just around you remember the prophet said just to be around it is not enough you've got to come under it it's got to come in you is that right now then then we become Witnesses of that same Covenant and I want you to think it was revealed I want you to watch this this scarlet cord Remember When when when when the spies came in she was testifying to them her faith had already been built right by what hearing the word of God just hearing the word what God was doing hey you think it ain't powerful sometimes listen sometimes friends we can miss the very channels that God wants to do sometimes and please understand me we want to get people we want to get to that place of Acts 238 but remember but sometimes before you can get to acts 238 you you've got to take what Jesus said when John was there and his eyes was all skimmed over and he said go tell John what you see being done sometimes it's just the testimony what is it that would build the faith in the meetings where many would be testifying of things you know and how God was working and they were seeing things and meeting and then the word was coming the same word now as the word would be ministering it was the word that was bringing the people off the Cs as they received it it was the word that was dissolving cancer and as that word was going forth RAB received that word and she said I know that the Lord had given you the land in other words here we are I I'm living in the walls of judgment and I can't get out this is a walled City and I've heard the sound of the trumpet but I need to get out of here I've only got so much time that I can get out of this walled City see I I've heard the Jubilee she said but I can't get out of it on my own but see she heard a word that brought faith that irregardless of her situation and the conditions of life I want you to understand what these Brethren with a revelation they went into her home something that was there in her possession all along but she hadn't realized it and it hadn't been put in its proper place that's what the message of the Hour come to do it's not a new Bible but it brings to the realization of what has always laid here and guides it to be placed properly that judgment that fear is passed away from our hearts and when the word the realization because what brings realization the holy ghost coming the Life coming upon that word brings a realization and begins to break back the veils and scales upon the life and then we can see it's him I was always a part of him and then here we take of that word and now we see how to apply that word that it's more than just healing the sick it's more than just the dead being raised but now Has Come For Life that'll seal us into the body amen oh my listen friends I'm not against signs and wonders but the bride of Christ is not following that signs and wonders is not a sign of of the Bride of Jesus Christ signs and wonders follow them that believe and there's always been a part of it that sometimes with Even in our Humanity of human nature we've seen it through the years those of you that are much older than me you would have somebody that would you know raise up and somebody you know they would say something and do something and you know and uh you know wanting to say something about somebody or whatever and all of a sudden then you'd have people running after them and running after this one and running it's why because there's a part within that of sometimes of that Humanity that's drawn to the supernatural but God brings us see in this hour we're living in we realize beloved believe not every Spirit but try it whether it be of God is will it stay with the word of God will it stay because this is what this is our safety is to stay with the word of God that's our safety is that right that's why Paul Paul even said he said I'm not your safety the Revelation is if I or an angel am come from heaven and say anything different than what's already been said let him be a cursed this is why Paul could go on to say with such Authority If any man think himself to be a prophet preacher or spiritual spirit filled let him acknowledge that the things that I have Wroten unto you are the Commandments of the Lord amen this is why back in the days of Paul any man that would want to try to say well you know this is Paul's opinion it was just tuned out tuned out that's that's why when the the Ephesian believers they tried them as false Apostles and the prophet said how did they try them by being false Apostles they tried them by the word and they said you're not saying what Paul said right right glory be to God oh my so notice Let me just let me just close on this one Statue of a perfect man remember that virtue look how brother brand says this if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have virtue and a pass that it can pass forward from me to the people I've got to have a pass I've got to have that token I've got to have that life I've got to have that because that is all the virtue and allows it to pass to others and you know sometimes you you might look and you might think well what what can I do but brother Brown says he goes on to say it like this he says what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds not there to draw from the check bounced somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner he said there's not much virtue can be drawn from that so sometimes the virtue that's being drawn is not altogether what we're saying it's our life that's virtue that constant steadiness look sometimes you you you might look and think about with with your children your family your loved ones your co-workers and it might seem like nothing's getting through it might seem like nothing's making a difference let me give you two examples brother brandham takes that little woman and he gives this story in many places in the message she God had done a work in her life but her husband was a drunk and they got down at the bar and these guys that were down there at the bar said there ain't no such thing as a real Christian right and he said at about that time that man raised up and said oh yes there is I know one ah there ain't no such thing as that he said yes I know one my wife brother brand pauses there he said see he said here she was at home thinking it wasn't getting through right brother Bram goes into that house shooting because what what what happens if we feel like something's not getting over you get discouraged you almost feel like just you know let's let's fold in the you know nobody's passing by in the flea market to buy anything let's just fold up the tables and go eat hot dogs or something you know let's just fold it up but brother Bram said see he says brother Bram applies that to zakus and Elizabeth he said when zakus got to be the most irritable he said that was the sign that God was dealing with with him and then brother Bram you know you know what happens with that story then brother Bram himself comes to that place in his own life where he felt like the message it's not getting acrossed it's not being received and brother R will take that same example and say he was contacted by Brother Williams out of after a full gospel businessman's meeting where a man had got up and begin to dispute things that brother brandham was ministering and he said the people and at that moment he said they just they froze and he said brother Williams came up behind that man and he said this is not how we heard brother brandham teach it and he said how many brother William said when he me made that statement after that man had left and or the man had walked off the stage he said how many of you'd like brother brand to come back out here in Arizona and to minister and lay these things back out he said brother brandom he said I had $100 bills I had $20 bills being laid in my hand right there to get your ticket to bring you back out here and brother Braham said think of it when it when I thought nobody's listening to me nobody's hearing it but God was working on the time so sometimes even in this here as a savior God help us to be faithful help us to be faithful when it seems like we're seems like we're up against a brick wall but remember it's not you that liveth it's Christ and sometimes in those times that God has it it's just us being tempered it's us just being molded into a place for God to further use and work through our lives I tell you we want to be that kind of a channel that the virtue of the Holy Spirit can flow through don't you we've got we got one example we got one one one uh purpose and that is Lord you know let's find that last one and as we're working to find that last one say God help me let me just be as a channel that you know to help somebody else along the way to encourage somebody else along Give me the give me the wisdom Lord whether it's something I need to say or it's a time to listen maybe even in your family is it a time to listen is it a time to speak God let give me the wisdom on what's needed right now and that's something that if Bill that if job's friends would have leaned on God for discernment within that instead of their knowledge of of the word if they would have leaned on God then God God himself I believe God can give the discernment and give us the strength I don't I'm not going to say that they would have come and give job the answers because God was building job's faith and his trust was solid within God because at the end of it all God lets job know I've been working the whole time but Lord I want to be a faithful Channel don't you if there's anything about me Lord any complex or things that Lord would be Lord just just dissolve it Lord dissolve anything out of my life that Lord would would be Hance guide me and show me and brother BR says as you are one with that word and you apply it the simple applying of the word you know our our simple daily walk with God you know the applying when we talk about applying the blood it it's simply taking the word daily in our lives it's through things even as we think about we embark on this new year that we have before us it's a time that to look and say Lord I want to be closer to you this year than what I was last year I want I want more of you Lord I want more of your life less of me in this year I want to be closer Lord and just the applying of the word through prayer through just even just taking the word just even on a daily a daily basis friends just getting into the scriptures on a daily basis you don't have to become a scholar but just get into the word of God it's just even if it's just just reading a chapter a day it's just getting into the word of God just even even when it comes to the message just it's it's not about you know don't don't set you know sometimes we can set such goals that are unattainable but just just a little bit just even if you do a little bit and you find what'll happen it'll just continue to build and build and build and build and build all of us have different time schedules is that right so we can't look at it all all through the same lens but the main thing of it is is that Lord I want to apply that word to my life I want that word applied in my life because that word it has power within it it has power to change that same word has the authority that brought Rahab to the place to realize what was in her possession don't you love him showed her how to apply it he's the same God tonight amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer heavly father Lord You're mindful of our needs Lord father even to deliver of your word in this generation Lord God to minister Lord salvation to our souls Lord oh God how we we thank you Lord for every every prayer for every sick that has been answered we thank you for that Lord we thank you for every every Mir Miracle God for the dead that's been raised Lord for cancers Lord that's been removed how we lord I I just rejoice in that Lord I rejoice in that Lord if it was a lord it it happened to Lord upon some and they never even went on maybe to serve you I know that that's a dangerous thing because Lord is you said in your word go and sin no more un L A worst thing come on you but father even how that you would would so provide with the desire to see Humanity be well that you know some Lord would never believe in Divine Healing and you'd provide that God you would allow doctors to be able to tap into a portion and tap into that Lord God and Father be able Lord through different things of medicines and ointments and surgeries and no wonder your Prophet Lord would tell us that dear God you perform Miracles through surgery Lord You Lord It's You Lord that is our healer Lord father no more than one man can save another man father there's no man that can heal another man Lord you are that you are and you alone are our healer Lord and so father we thank you for all of these things Lord just your goodness Lord to Lord to suffering Humanity but Lord I'm thankful that there's a there's a greater work there's a greater Lord a greater uh reality that comes into the heart of the believer of what Calvary made a way for Lord that father that we who were once separated alienated in our minds by Wicked Works Lord father Heaven our nature was contrary but father through and by like we read that scripture for when the love and kindness of God our savior toward man appeared not of works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he has saved us and washed us with the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus we are your workmanship Lord there's nothing Lord I I'm so glad every time Lord that myself or someone else Lord that's been sick I'm so glad when you have touched them Lord I'm glad Lord the times when I've been sick Lord I'm so glad oh God for your healing touch but Lord I've experienced it and so of each one of us of what it means to be healed in one area and then we find Lord here we are battling maybe in another area Lord we're healed of a sinus infection and then here we are battling with a cold but father it just shows that this this life in this life we have no continuing City this life is really not about this life this life is the opportunity to make ready for that life which is beyond this life Lord and that's why David under inspiration could write thy loving kindness is better than life Lord thy loving kindness is your mercy is your life that God that you would come and you would do a work in our lives in our hearts God you would bring us to a place melt down our will oh God to a place of surrender your love your kindness and then you step in in that moment Lord of surrender and you completely change our lives you bring Lord the healing to that soul that can never ever be reversed there's a healing that comes into that soul that changes us Lord we pass from Death unto life like we're looking on Sunday we become a living miracle in our lives that's the greatest Miracle there is Lord for once that soul that was sinick has been healed it can never never ever be sick again but Lord sometimes Lord how the enemy will come in these bodies and like your Prophet said that he said Satan would look at these bodies and say well I I can't get to them seemingly in their soul but I'm going to afflict their body and we know he has to get permission he can't do anything unless he gets permission he had to get permission from you in order to touch job so Lord when we can look at the circumstances that are are present that we are standing in Satan has had to get permission we're under your care that's why even as you stood here in the body of your son you spoke there to Pontius pilot and said you could have no power over me except it be given unto you for my Father which is above Lord then there's nothing that can happen to us nothing can take place unless Satan has first got permission and then Lord when that permission is granted like he told him concerning job you can touch everything else but you can't touch his life and father I'm so thankful Lord that there is a life on the inside oh God A Life That's not like Paul could say it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me I pray that God throughout this congregation tonight Lord those that would be streaming or those that would hear it Lord oh God may that be the testimony may that be the raise of the S so that would soak Lord into every heart and every life that Lord if if they never experienced to that depth Lord may they just Lord Just Surrender their hearts and say Lord I I want that depth in my life Lord I I want to know you in that way Lord I want to know you in a deeper and more personal way Lord oh God I thank Lord as husbands and mothers wives and grandparents and Lord deacons pastors brothers sisters musicians on and on Lord oh God we want to be available channels Lord help us Lord help us to be ready Lord give us strength that we would not become weighed down with the cares of life that that will take that will take more than human determination it'll take Lord yielding and applying ourselves to you daily Lord and you promised that you would give us strength sufficient for each day I don't have to worry about tomorrow my life is in the hands of him who holds tomorrow so Lord may you grant to each of us this day our daily bread oh God give us the strength that we have need of Lord may you help us Lord give us the wisdom Lord to be able to minister to one another help us Lord that we lord we're living in an hour in an age where it's so easy to become focused on self God forgive us Lord and help us Lord that we as you brought to us some weeks ago help us to live beyond our duties help us Lord I pray because that's what you did I want to we want to be like you Lord help us to be a channel that you can flow through Lord may you cleanse Lord every hindrance Lord as you bring it to our attention under your presence like you did get in Lord God may we submit our hearts to you that you would dissolve everything that's unlike you Lord help us
