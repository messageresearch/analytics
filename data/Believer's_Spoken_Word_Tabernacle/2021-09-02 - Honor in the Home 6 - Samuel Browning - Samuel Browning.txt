[Applause] hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord amen we're so good for that so glad so glad for the grace of god amen just want to give you a little bit of update here from brother soriano and they had with they'd put a they did the trach the tracheotomy surgery and he came through that very well i guess that's a procedure they do when they've been on a ventilator for for so long but and you know those are things that sometimes you think of tracheotomy i think of that in the past but you know some of you know a brother right now i don't know if any how many of you know brother bill younce but brother billiance had one and then you know they they not from covet but brother billiance had one from years ago and when there was a situation going on with his heart and they closed that right back up and brother billiards just resumed right back to preaching and things like that so we we just know that that's a process and so um he's he's had sister cynthia is able to be in the icu with him now and uh his his saturation levels on oxygen are really good they're right up to almost 99 which we thank god for that and uh his oxygen level uh it's about at about an 85 percent so some of those things are our processes after they've went through that that surgery and uh you know we just just tried to encourage and look at look at these things because you know the thing that we look at above everything else is the promise of god i know the things that the world looks at the world looks at things like as a ventilator and all those things as a death sentence but the reality is we look at the promise of god amen there's there's there's just there's nothing greater than the promise of almighty god and so there's never you know in a situation that's that's uh that our brother has been through and god has certainly been seeing brother roell through so i just give that report to you to encourage you because i can't tell you everything that's been happened moment by moment through the week as sister cynthia has just been relaying to me those different different events but there has been improvements and the things that you know that i just had expressed to them is footsteps are possession they got not the land all at once but little by little by little by little amen and we we certainly you know there's a battle but as the children of god that's where we stand within this time and we know no retreat we don't we don't turn back god said i will make you the head and not the tail and so there's never any defeat for a child of god and you know it's just like uh when you hear of a request you know sometimes there's a request or there's something that comes and you feel like you get a blow you know maybe you went to the doctor and something comes your way in it just feels like somebody just slugged you you know and that can happen we feel that in our humanity because the the baptism of the holy ghost did not take away our humanity but what it did it gave us a strength and a grace to order this humanity in the word of god so we have an inner power an inner peace and a direction and this is where we we look to god and we take the promises of god as situations and things arise god has everything covered i mean my goodness you you and i you know how it is when we try to go on a trip somewhere we try to plan for everything you know i take this and i take that and i take this and sometimes we still are trying to write little notes oh to remember this and remember that and remember this at the last moment and i won't ask you how many forgot things just like i did i'll tell you a little story on myself one time that i i got uh you know as when some things had just taken place where my father had just passed away and i got i had to go minister and i got at the end of the turnpike clear over there to get off and i realized i forgot the most important thing my briefcase i told my wife i said meet me at the amherst place and just bring my briefcase with you it's all packed up so i got there and i unpacked the briefcase you know and i get there just so i you know i'm i'm about you know about an hour away from church starting you know so i'm at that in a place and okay i know what you know god's given me on my heart to minister but i realize as i get my suit and everything on all i have to wear is these crocs that look like house shoes and they're they're a light tan and i have a black suit on brother samuel what did you do i went to the pulpit and preached with crocs on and a black suit and tie you know those are things i didn't mean for that to happen in that way and one of the brothers told me uh after this after the sunday service that was on friday night and i was able to slip out and buy some shoes you know for saturday service and sunday one of the brothers said i just thought it was a new style you know god has a way of humbling you you know and it just you have to come into those places what's the main purpose and what we're here for and i said all that to say this god has this remember this is the same case doctor's bag that dr moses used but the brahm said when a situation would arise there in the middle of the night he would reach in there and he said he had the same prescription that was given for every situation he said no matter if a baby was born or somebody's eye he said got poked out he said this the same scripture applied i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases and i'm just so grateful for that i'm glad that i'm glad god didn't name him i'm glad it's not superscription he named them all because we could say oh my god forgot about this but he said all all all that diseases so to know that god knows exactly where we're at and you know whether it's covet whether it's flu whether it's silent whatever it is cancer i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases this is where our trust is that is in him and i'm so glad he's faithful he's mindful aren't you glad for that tonight amen could we just approach him in a word of prayer amen let's just pray together heavenly father lord we want to say thank you for this opportunity that you've given us tonight that we could come together and lord jesus our gathering the lord if you lord would not come lord jesus it would be no more than just a protractive gathering but father we believe that lord that you're here we've each and everyone come lord some coming straight from their lord their occupations their jobs and other things and they just lord just even in their way in their trip here in the car have just lord just setting everything aside asking for your grace lord and we we all come here lord with a desire to hear from you tonight there are needs lord that throughout this building there are needs lord of requests that are here before us lord that are out across the internet lord we thank you for dear god you're working right among us in a special way and we ask that god that as we give you thanks lord for brother roel how we thank you lord for every victory lord and there's been lord some little things here and there that we've looked at and my it's like the lord it could be a blow it could be a setback but how we thank you for the encouragement lord and the fellowship of the holy spirit lord that in these times lord you encourage us and you strengthen us lord for god you lord have made the promise and you make good on every promised lord now we're just standing as a believer knowing all that we know to do lord and that's to pray and to hold up lord god every request lord including that of brother o el lord we ask that god that for every need that's gathered here tonight lord no matter what that need is but i pray right now god from our hearts may we just place it on the altar of god just lord invite you to come and minister to our needs in a very special way lord i pray that you'll just move among this congregation lord tonight may the holy ghost lord god that father as you're here present in this building may you just move lord oh god to speak to every heart and every life in a very personal way lord lord jesus we just give ourselves to you lord we love you and we thank you lord for this privilege you've given us we thank you lord for god just being with brother bill lord as he stands back your faithful lord at his post of duty lord how we thank you for our brother lord thank you o god for your grace and mercy lord jesus you are so faithful lord and we love you and we thank you father we just lord jesus look to you tonight that you'll come lord we can open the bible but we need you to come lord and to open our understanding lord to open the words of the book lord god to inspire it lord by the holy spirit to our hearts o god we pray quicken it lord to us and us to it we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen first corinthians 13 and verse 4 and then i'm going to read i want then to go into ephesians 5 once again in first corinthians 13 4 charity charity this is god this is the love of god this is god's own life charity suffereth long it's kind it envieth not it bonneth not itself and is not puffed up and it does not behave itself unseemly and i want to kind of if i can read that out of the amplified bible there i have that verse if we have it on the screen and it's pulling from this does not behave itself unseemly it's not conceited which is to be arrogant or inflated with pride it's not rude or unmannerly and does not act unbecomingly amen may god bless the reading of the word the manager being seated just wanna as we look at this we recognize that since the love of god is god himself and dwelling in the believer by way of the new birth that the love of god will always conduct itself in the word and so when we think of this this place here in the scripture does not behave itself unseemly we we see that there is a display of a behavior that would be according to the word that doesn't mean that things we we know uh would be easy or would maybe uh be going our way necessarily but when opposition arises this is where you realize in many of these in some of these things it deals with what's within it deals with casting out thoughts vaunting not itself and all these things that can come our way even feelings about things but then as it deals with remember brother brown talks about the things that you think about the things you dwell on that's why paul would say that you're to think upon things of a good report not just upon things that are true because there's a lot of things that are true that if you dwell on it very long it'll affect you in a negative way is that right you you know just like when we think about the spies that were in the land i mean to dwell upon giants being in the land that was truth but it was not truth that was to be dwelt upon the truth to be dwelled upon is god made the promise god is for us and they shall be bred for us so there's a there's a right truth and paul would balance it out that the truth that we are to dwell upon is that which has virtue that which has praise that which is of a good report that's the kind of truth these are the things we want to think on because whatever we think upon and dwell upon it creates an atmosphere around us and so when we think about even with the behavior and knowing that it's part of the character and we know that character itself is never made but character itself is a victory from battle after battle after battle and it's really not battling with someone else it's battling with our own selves it's bringing ourselves as paul would say i die daily this is why the lord jesus would say that let a man deny himself and take up his cross luke would write it daily and to see that it's a sacrificing daily it's a letting go but it's a letting go on the account and giving the word the preeminence in our life this is our desire in our lives is that he might be glorified so when we look at this the it's a behavior that's according to the word not necessarily a behavior that's according to the circumstances that's around us because the circumstances around us if we allow the circumstances to capture us our behavior could now come under the governance of whatever those circumstances are remember when brother branham was standing there and the maniac that came up there he got loose he had already uh you know done a preacher in out there on the sidewalk and he came walking up there and he spit right in brother branham's face and he said you hypocrite and he challenged he came right at him now brother brown says i chose at that time to think different thoughts he began to think different thoughts and thoughts concerning that man and that in itself now listen god didn't do that for him he had to do that and recognize the thoughts that he had he said the same thing about the bull said the same thing about the about the bees they were thoughts that were coming to him that was bringing fear and brother brown made the statement in all three of those things he said i made a determination i'm not going to die like a coward god didn't do that for him he made that decision but that decision within that invited the presence of almighty god now it's true there might be times in our life that our thoughts are out of line and you might say how do i get my thoughts in line i'd first be honest with god and say lord my thoughts are out of line i need help lord right now to help and give me strength because i want your thoughts to permeate and rule over my thoughts because as it said in isaiah 55 my thoughts are not your thoughts they're higher and in how isaiah went on to bring about those thoughts bring life bring nourishment bring refreshment bring delight so rather when we look at it it's not a behavior that's governed by circumstances in our life but rather it's where the actions then become under the governance of the love of god from our soul and you know the love of god makes no exceptions it makes no exceptions even when it comes into our life this is why paul could write grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption because there is the possibility of grieving him brother brown would say it like this he says as that dove which a dove is timid a dove is meek a dove is not burly but that dove then would take its flight and he says he says it's just taking its flight out there he says but now what you must do is you must come into a place to become a lamb to welcome him back so when we look at this the love of god it makes no exceptions it'll always direct us to the word even when it comes into our life to where is the lining up and it's saying lord forgive me or help me in this area you see let me just say it like this god has no problem with us coming to him and say lord help me lord forgive me in this area god is not bothered with that but what becomes a hindrance is when we stop allowing reflection in our life deflection is the worst thing in the world where everything is because of somebody else's fault i wouldn't do this if it wasn't because of somebody that's deflection reflection looks inwardly it lets the word come in because to say god help me to look inwardly that's real maturity because it's not always comfortable to look inwardly but i'll tell you what it'll do it'll help us to grow in the grace of almighty god for any of us that refuse to look into the word and really take a real examination in our life and it's not just why the word is being preached but even when situations arise about our life if we fail to really examine our life now let me just say this as it's coming to me that does not mean for us just to say man something must be wrong with me that's not examination examination you don't you know when you don't just look at yourself or or come to a part and say there must be something wrong with me you go to a mirror you might find a window on a car you start looking at things what's wrong is this wrong you know sometimes you try to straighten your hair if you've got it you know especially sisters you just try to look at certain things a rear view mirror you'll look at those different things why you need something that reflects the image so that you're able to care for or fix those things that are before you and this is what real the real ministering of the word does it doesn't start here and stop here but it can begin here but it continues with our life that's why after service is over it's not just like a meal at home where we just you know move our hands and throw down you know the napkin and say man that was a good meal it is a time of reflection it's where the word goes with us because the word is not a dead letter the word is a living person he's alive and he he searches out our life our desire is that our lives would be so pleasing to him and if there's anything out of the way we desire that it would be remedied with his word what has done that in our lives the love of god we can take no credit in that that is the love of god and that's a desire that it esteems his word this is this is where the real victory of the new birth comes in within our life and so when we look at this and we examine if i can just move right back into ephesians 5 and working to apply this here just of just a few moments here in ephesians 5 verse 21 the scripture said submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as christ as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything so let me just pause here for a moment the clear as we were looking on sunday the clear identification of the church because there's many churches but jesus never said he never said in his word will i find a church when i return he said in the book of jude will i find faith and it's not just faith because remember faith itself is believing there's a believing on and a believing in it's two differences but it starts with believing on him and his work to bring us to that place to where then we come in him by his sovereign grace then we're no longer believing on him we are believing in him that's security and so it's his life in the church of the living god that identifies his church his bride his wife because she's under his name which is his life his life being his character being his word i mean you could not think of the lord jesus having a wife that she looks into the word and says well i don't know that you know that was for days gone by that's not his wife he is god and he changes not is that right he cannot change he doesn't the bible as he said the word that's gone out of my mouth i will not alter it so we know that the identification of his wife of his church speaking in the spiritual level is one that reflects his his will his word his desires and that reflects the true oneness that was prayed for in john 17 that they might be one you see god does not want uh they're a divided opinion remember in the days of israel where some are worshiping bowel and they were worshiping jehovah too because a divided opinion a divided house there's not victory there and god's desire now let us look at what god's desire he could have taken bail he could or he could have taken all those prophets and he could have tried to lay everything out but how god has a way of dissolving the divided opinions and bringing real oneness is by a visitation of himself among his people god doesn't have to convince his people he just shows up the fire came from heaven it brought a reality among the children of god that which god had reserved for himself and what did he do it gave him courage to step out that of bowel the divided opinion was over with a visitation from god and i believe that with all my heart i hope you're understanding me now these are things friends these are principles in the word that it breaks on down into our life when you know when we look at it and we look at the word and where where we're to be in god but where we are in god is to reflect itself in our everyday life if it doesn't reflect itself in shoe leather then we're really not where we claim to be you see this is what paul is dealing with he deals with the warfare he deals with all this but yet paul is letting it be known if this isn't coming out on display then we're not where we need to be then we can we can look to god and say god let the fire fall amen let there be a dissolving let there be a consuming of the sacrifice o god i believe that if we're honest with god he'll come and never forget the statement brother branham made in the jehovah's gyrus series in grass valley of 1962 when he preached the three parts he took the last state and the last part and i never forgot this statement he said i'd like to come back here sometime and set up a tent he said because god has moved so wondrously right here and he's dealing with this point he said because there are people that's willing to be honest with god and he'll always come where hearts are honest god is not looking for let me find a church that's mistake free you can't find one unless it's the first church of the graveyard nobody complains of nobody there nobody offends nobody there are you with me but you see god's not interested in you and i being perfect he's perfect it's us coming into his perfect life under the perfect blood by a perfect holy ghost and then it's god working in our life his own perfection as he molds us and shapes our character to match his character that's god's working and boy i'll tell you what he's got a task but god knew what he was getting in for he knew what he was getting into husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but then it should be holding without blemish let me just stop here just for a moment we look at these scriptures and as paul he's giving that what is the spiritual and to be the heavenly significance of christ and his bride because that was the type that there was the hidden mystery that was there in genesis 2 when god laid adam to sleep and he took out of adam's side that rib and began to multiply it then he divided there that masculine and feminine spirit and he placed that feminine spirit there within that of of the body he created and he brought them together in a holy union and they're in spirit there here they are united and god would say they are one flesh so god marriage is not the institution of man marriage is the institution of almighty god this is why paul could say in the book of hebrews marriage is honorable when you look at those scriptures there and we look at ourselves as husbands we say well i can see christ and that he himself is is indeed you know my sin bearer he's my burden bearer i can see that washing of water by the word my he's cleansed me he cleaned up my life he brought a change in my life he's sanctified and cleansed my life and he's the one that's brought me to a presentable state but if we can bring this and bring it on in even into the natural but at the same time taking back over to the spiritual how many of us in our lives that even after this uniting with the lord jesus christ that is the spirit of god begins to deal with our lives depending on your makeup and your temperament there's things that god will deal with complexes that have been about our life for years maybe things before god ever started dealing with our life things that were said to us in a certain way or ways that we were made to feel excluded you know we can go on and on but what does god do god doesn't sit there and say don't feel that way quit feeling that way but god knows how to provide what is needed in order to loosen that you see what god said i'm gonna show myself greater than that complex i'm gonna show myself greater than that hindrance and every one of the thoughts that you had about yourself this is why as a spiritual in psalms 45 where how would speak of the bride in christ and here david would write about it and he would speak of it in this manner he would speak that to the queen that she would forget the land of her nativity i tell you god in his mercy he moves in our lives not only to dismantle our past but he ministers to you and i to where you and i it's not that we've got bigger heads now but our confidence is in him we see our littleness our need of him in a greater way but he has not demeaned us he has not torn us down for our shortcomings but he's ministered to us in loving grace because he knows that we are but flesh are you with me he knows how to minister twilight there's not one of us in here that are free from faults now listen we're not talking about you know getting together and singing kumbaya and we all got sin in our life that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about that there are faults there are mistakes there are things that we look at shortcomings there's weaknesses that are there in our life there's things that you look at in your life and say god i need strength lord i need strength and it isn't all together stripped out of your life but you know you need grace to rule over that in your life you can't let it get out of check and what does he do with his love he just doesn't come and say no uh don't do that shame on you he comes with his love to do what brings such grace that you and i might rise within his presence hey listen there's already fences of doubt and thought that try to separate you from the presence of almighty god but god's not interested so much in tearing down the fences he's interested in flooding our lives with his water so that the water rises above every division it rises above every thought that's what the coming of the holy ghost is all about brother it gives us strength to rise above our doubts oh my i'm glad he washes us aren't you i'm glad he keeps cleansing us i'm glad he keeps telling you and i i've always loved you i've always cared about you i've always watched over you you're the apple of my eye i've had you in mind all along you were in my great drama all along you know sometimes you look at it and say but lord you don't know what i'm going through he knows what you're going through but what he's trying to do is flood the situation with his love because there's nothing greater than the love of god brother we can try to figure things out like when brother adam stood there with that bull in that pasture it was not his intellect it was not his doing that undid that situation it was the love of god that came sovereignly down the same thing with the bees or the hornets that were there it came down within that sovereign time the maniac that was there over and over brother adam gives us examples of that you say brother samuel what are you saying i'm saying if we can just recognize of what has been placed within our hands and our lives the love of god and we can say lord i cannot win this battle on my own but the love of god is the greatest weapon that's ever been given to the church of the living god and lord by the love of god in my life i'm more than a conqueror you know a lot of these things even as i said within life itself god works to dismantle the complexes and other things in our life he he doesn't all you know god has such a way of dealing with things in our life and this is why brother brown would tell us over and over and he would give direction in the church age book and speak to as husbands pastors fathers and things like that and he would say god giving direction on even how to run our homes and he speaks of how in the ephesian age how christ praises his own remember in the ephesian age when he says i know thy works god would come with a rebuke but he would say i know thy works and how thou hatest them that that the works of the deeds of the nickelodeons brother braham said see we could learn something there on how to run our homes our churches and everything else christ praises his own he said he knows how to encourage us in the right matters and how to discourage us in the wrong matters he knows how to do that so well you know when he comes with his presence god works to dismantle holds upon our life you know we could just stay there all night and preach that and preach it for weeks but within that whole thing right there god works down into the depths of because a lot of complexes and things like that is subconscious it's things that's been placed and put within us that we don't even realize sometimes all the junk that's been packed within us is that right how many times did brother brown stand there on the platform now brother branham the angel of the lord would call out things if these things weren't important the holy ghost would have never called them out but how that you had a woman that was still dealing with fear brother that wasn't a fear isolated to dogs that was a fear that was affecting her for her healing in her own life it had troubled her and the spirit of god would care so much that he would go back in her life to where here she is as a little girl and she was chased by a dog when she got off the school bus even the color of her dress was called out why because god cares about that that needed to be exposed how the enemy had wanted to put that mark upon her life but jesus came along and the lord jesus pointed out that hold within our life see god over and over god's mindful of these things and i'm just going to be honest we know that god knows exactly how to do things there's things that you and i can look at one another and listen let me just tell you something friends you know the moment that we start looking at things through the eyes of our human understanding is the moment we get anxious and frustrated because you realize you can't do it any situation we look at but remember this is not a flesh and blood affair there are things that absolutely as we're looking at where the word has to be lived through our flesh but it must be under the orchestration of the love of almighty god my my my my well that was free we could spend more time on that but i'm glad that god moves down to dismantle those holes aren't you i'm glad i'm glad he's still doing that i'm glad he's still doing that right there because god he oh my i just got to keep going he is the you know what the amen i know i know some of us boy we pride ourselves on the final word but he is the final in this age he revealed himself as the a man is that right and so we look back as it said in isaiah that we are to bless ourselves in the god of truth which is the god of the amen and that is to receive from god it's not what somebody else has said it's not even what your thoughts about yourself what should i do take what god is saying about you through the word and look to him and say god i'm gonna stand on your word what you're saying about me are you with me you see this is where this is where it comes down even in our lives and this is this is a what a responsibility when we look at this chapter and we bring it out into the natural and i i say that in this manner that when we bring it out into the natural lives and things like that there's times that there are things that begin to become uncovered whether it's a complex or whether it's this thing right here well i'm not good at this or i'm not good at that but god in his grace and even as a husband in the natural can look to god and let the love of god so flow in our life to let god move and work to bring about the confidence the dismissing of the complexes and things that can be ever present there are you hearing me went a little quiet there but listen this word became flesh amen and when it became flesh now it yielded water and that water now is the nourishment for the seeds that were upon the earth the same way that word becomes flesh in us now if we allow that word to have free course it'll bring nourishment you see god is not the author of confusion god knows how to arrange everything together so it complements all of his great sovereignty we wouldn't even maybe you know if we were even looking at our assembly we wouldn't even put this together thank god he didn't leave it up to us but god's the one that's put us together god's the one that's assembled this congregation together god knows what each and every one of us the part within our life you might say my part but there's a part that you have to play just as much as there's a part that i have to play and we need one another lord that cannot be said enough amen verse 28 my goodness so want men to love their wives as their own bodies that's pretty straight he that loveth his wife loveth himself now we're living in an age where the the scripture prophesied men shall be lovers of themselves i mean you don't have to what this is an age of it's all that let me hear it selfies right i never forget when brother rose tell roe el soriano i don't know how many years ago and you know when he said my said when was it he said that all of a sudden you come out with this term self ease let me think of it now listen this is not a doctrine that if you take a selfie of yourself your you understand what i'm saying all right but we realize we're in a time that when the bible says men is talking mankind will be lovers of themselves where in reality you know here we are we are put into a place in a challenge where god deals with our lives as believers to come to a place where we lose sight of ourselves and submitting ourselves unto the lord this is all god's orchestration his working to bring us to a place of a new birth and then the new birth on the inside the love of god working in our lives because now it's not a war on the inside that war has ended this ground has been cleaned are you with me no longer two masters and struggling but that ground has been claimed our desire is to live for him but as paul said in romans 7 when i would go to do good evil is present is that right we recognize a war that we never experienced before but let me remind you greater is he amen that is in you than he that's in the world as i write oh my he beloveth his wife loveth himself because it is to be one within interest you know when we look at even for a man as he would take this and really take it to heart when a man in himself his the kindness that he would show to his wife is more than repaid you see everything and you realize these are not things that's all together come about up in society right now these are seeds things we see now are seeds that were sown years ago are you with me and remember if god tarries there will be seeds come out that will be sown and what does it do it further shows a degradation it further souls and evil but if that's the case there what about in this hour where the word comes to fruition in our life and there's a harvest there's a nourishing and then it sows back so there's there's a law of contrast that's going on is that right so then when we when we see this that what what is is actually sown there the kindness to to the wife it's more than repaid by the happiness that she will impart all the real care and concern that he chose to make her happy and that's a big that's a big statement it will come to more than what it actually costs you know when a man wants to really promote his own happiness in a real most effectual way it's where he actually does so by showing kindness to his wife and kindness itself just this is just the beginning of it kindness is to be friendly is to be generous it's to be considerate this is these are all parts of what charity really is right you see these are all parts of the fruit of the spirit that's why i said if if paul is dealing with this here in ephesians 5 he is in ephesians chapter 1 oh he's preached the adoption oh you're in christ jesus you are chosen before the foundation of the world then he has to deal with ephesians 5 to show to them that you can't pretend or laugh as though you're living so high up here that it doesn't reflect in your natural life it must allow it must be reflected in our natural life and it takes god's grace it takes the grace of god to do that us blessing lord help me strengthen me lord in these areas of my life because i believe that every every child of god desires to grow in the grace and knowledge of almighty god the bible says in first corinthians 7 3 and this is a part and i'm going to take this scripture out of where paul is dealing with the marital relationship but it plays a part within this first corinthians 7 3 let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband so notice the husband rendered to benevolence what is the kindness the good will what is due to her that is what is to be rendered unto her and so notice then or then that is likewise the wife unto the husband how do you and i love the lord he'll never accept our love we love him because he first loved us it's his love reflecting back to him what is it that holds us when the scripture says charity never faileth prophecies fail all these other things fail but charity never fails is that right so then what is it that reflects back because as god himself in the beginning when the fall even when the fall took place god never just wiped his hands and said oh my goodness i can't believe but his love is what drove and brought him down to whereas brother brown would describe it he spelled out l-o-v-e when he spoke the announcement of the coming of a seed that'll bruise the head of the serpent i'll give her a seed what was it that brought that utterance the love of almighty god that was christ right there reflected from the mind in the heart of almighty god reflected i will make a way back all the way down through the old testament shadows and types and glimpses of god's faithfulness and prophecy and everything that was laid out there all the way through it was the love of god that was on display all the way through in every scenario in every test every trial that was you could go through each one that may come to your mind right now when they face the greatness of the test or trial what was it that prevailed in that moment the love of god amen our love filial love this is all we can get to without the baptism of the holy ghost is that right the bible said god is love any man loved the world the love of god is not in him the love of god is the holy ghost right god's life quickened in that word so then what is reflected back to our life is the love of god so what is he seeing he's seeing his own love reflected back to himself you say brother samuel i feel like i love him less we always are in that place of the lord i want to love you more lord i want to love you more one has done that the love of god has its moving in our life and notice it's his love on display oh my see there's a law of harvest let me just say that mutual kindness and good will it's reflected or reciprocated back there's a law of harvest in in galatians 6 7 let me refer to this quickly be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting i don't consider investing in our family i'm not talking about well we're going to go on a family vacation and you know brother samuel we're just you know we're just going to invest in our family and not go to the house of god come on now that's not spiritual that's fleshly i'm going to preach it anyway you see in order for think god intended remember what he said to peter peter do you love me i love you you know the stories it keeps on going and what he said if thou loved me feed my sheep so part of the expression of the love of god that would come in peter's life is he would feed his sheep but not only the sheep feed my lambs so sometimes the things that we can look at within life of oh to be busy with this but remember eternal life is living for others brother branham would say it so clearly a person who lives them life for themselves lives a selfish life thank god for the new birth that delivers us from selfishness gives us a strength on the inside to bring that man down is that right ah you're not rising up here i know where you're going i know that fool that pool i know that are you with me oh my so whatsoever a man saw it that shall he also reap i mean you can't you can't show you can't sew you can't sow the you know oranges and expect to come out with apples you can't sow harsh words and expect kindness to come preach brother samuel amen let's just let god just say god just invite him see god's not mocked so we know there's a law of harvest now listen to me now it does not mean that oh brother samuel you got now listen to me now get out of the way of a track of thought of oh you don't know the seeds that's been sown let me just tell you something you can't do away with what's been sown but you can sow seed that will counteract the effect of the negative seed you've got a choice you're not well there ain't no choice no there's a choice esther came before the king of hazard and said hey tell them to stop this they can't destroy my people he said i'm god i cannot be mocked whatsoever man soweth that shall i also reap you know i pulled the blessing that in there but he said what i will tell you to do you tell your people to arm themselves and they go at it the day before is that right so we can't undo it oh i'm gonna take a shovel and like we're searching for land mines forget that sow the good seed because the good seed has life within it it'll counteract the effects of the bad seed is that right right oh my god's not a god who dwells upon keeping you in your past that's a devil that's right did you hear me god does not delight in keeping you in your past that's defeat that's the devil god desires that you go forward sure recognize where shortcomings are but part of overcoming is recognizing where we are and where we need to be and the grace to ascend to that place second corinthians 9 6 i say this he that soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly he that soweth bountifully shall also reap bountifully see it's what you invest that's right these are things as you know these are not scriptures that are limited to taking up offerings come on we're not carnal people we're spiritual we recognize these script scriptures have compound meanings the spirit of god in our lives brings it down to a place that we recognize what you sow sparingly you'll reap sparingly but whatever you you sow bountifully you'll reap bountifully if the word if the word is sowed sparingly it's a sparing crop are you with me but if the word is sold bountifully there's a bountiful crop is that right this is why it's in this is why as it's important that the word be ministered the word be sown the word be received the word be prayed over and the word say god let the word be alive within my life just let me just bring this down into layman's terms if you don't invest in your wife you don't invest in your family don't expect to reap anything kids do not come here with autopilot right are you with me just coming to the altar and saying i do not listen i'm not you understand what i'm saying i'm these things are just as i'm standing here these are things that we recognize it's it's things that we are invested in it's love that brings us to this place but now circumstances of life miscommunications misunderstandings anybody like being misunderstood i'm glad you didn't say i don't like being misunderstood and even of the times that maybe let's say that i could say my how how was this misunderstood or how and we can try to make our point of the misunderstanding no good you're wasting energy what needs to be done sow the right things sow the right things to where there are things as it comes about within within our life as the scripture would go on to say every man according as he perpets in his heart so let him give not grudgingly but of necessity there's things that you know and you should know what's the delight of your wife and what's the delight of your husband you should know that are you with me and i know sometimes you know you continue to grow within that you don't you know my i'm just i'm just getting all ahead of myself here but we're just going to preach with it you see we learn as we grow sometimes you can think i'm doing the right things and and and you might be doing they're good things but it's not going in the right channel you know i'm saying it isn't that it's wrong things it's just you know i'm doing this but see you're not i'm not seeing any results out of it and then you see things that all the confusion that comes about and misunderstandings and all these things and it just things just continue to build to where things are being done but it's being done grudgingly he likes this she likes this well by the time you've got to suffer nowhere in the scriptures in ephesians 5 you find me the word suffer see we we look at as though marriage should be or well it's a suffering no remember it was his love that caused him to lay down his life it's a sacrifice not a suffering are you with me there's times we have to suffer in other relationships maybe at a job and there's things that we have to lay our lives down and say lord help me in this but you see within a marriage it's not a suffering god never intended it to be a suffering it's a sacrifice are you are you with me i don't have my glasses on so i can't see your faces this is why in romans 12 he would speak of how that we are to present our bodies as a living sacrifice think about it it's not it's not a suffering on our part to live for god is there times of suffering in our body yes in our body but inwardly yes we have fellowship amen are you with me because he said through sickness and sorrow these are the vows that the holy spirit has placed upon my life that whether in health or in sickness whether in good times or bad times i'm faithful is that right so god loves a cheerful giver so there's things that we have to look and say god help me to find the right channels i know as i speak to a lot of times you know we're speaking to those that's been married for some time these are things that you recognize that you you you you don't try to just find these things out on your own and move around them you ask right you ask questions okay okay so i thought this about this helped me to understand right because evidently it's like i'm pouring water down an empty bucket and there's a hole at the bottom of it so tell me where the bucket is where it's got the bottom in it so when i'm pouring the water i'm making sure the water's getting in the bucket are you with me not just but i'm because otherwise we get frustrated by our own i'm pouring water i'm pouring water i'm doing this i'm doing that i'm doing that but it's missing the channel is that right it's just like when we look at there's a lot of things that a person can do for god but if you're not doing it in the right channel it's not even reckoned to your account right if it's not done out of love it's not even done out of our it's not even the right account is that right so we want we want to always find the channel of god that's why even in the purpose of god for our life we must find the purpose of god in our life and operate within that purpose right brother brown tells a man and i mean i'm i'm off here but i believe i'm on but brother brown tells it tells a brother this brother's a good singer he tells the brother he said brother he said i believe that's your purpose and calling in life if you'll just yield to it god will use you the brother had been kind of struggling what his purpose was but brother branham calls her right out he's just coming up there and he says brother he says i believe if you yield to that that's your purpose to sing sing the songs of the gospel that's what god that's a calling if you'll just yield to it god will use you you see these are things when we look at channels and avenues and every one of us are different this is why listen to me it's good to have examples in the assembly we must be it must start even from the pastor and his wife and it must be through the assembly of good relationships of husbands and wives are you with me it must be there because the scripture tells us you take a take a man who's a pastor if his house is so divided he don't have no business standing here preach brother sam i'm preaching from the word because it's to be an example it's to be what is there is that right but how much greater is to see the work the gospel it'll work and it'll produce these things in the lives of the people what a great example that it is to be able to see these things on display let me just let me read here just a few a few places here first corinthians 7. let me just read this first corinthians 7 7 32 paul said he that is unmarried cared for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married care for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife paul's not saying once you get married you become worldly you've got more cares see before that time when you wanted to pray you could go pray you say you know what i'm going to take time and i'm going to go away and i'm going to go away and just pray ain't nobody he had nobody to check in with you he had nobody to these are things you have to start looking at and caring things you have to look at that and and concerned but let me just remind you these are not things that are worldly neither is it becoming less spiritual let me finish this there is a difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman care for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married care for the things of the world how she may please her husband so god would not place something in our life marriage is honorable it's of god god would not place something in our life that would be a hindrance is that right god will not god will not he will not work against himself he will not place something in our life that would be that of a hindrance but yet remember how peter would write this of a husband and wife relationship that we are heirs together of the grace of life is that right when brother branham went up to stand there in the vision before the lord here they came with him is that right hope immediate they came with him his first wife that had passed on right and then and then the other and they went up there they were associated together in this life now that pleasing is to strive and to accommodate ourselves to one another's opinions desires and interests this is that's the meaning of police to strive to please and you know i'm i'm not i know i'm out of time here so we just we just wrap this up i know it's a news flash in this day and age but in the beginning god made them male and female simon what are you saying well that there are things that how that the wife looks at things and will look a little different than the husband does and the husband's going to look at things different than the wife does oh brother samuel that's real carnal no it's not right in the scripture when god placed israel i don't have time to preach this but when god placed israel into the land every one of those tribes had a certain quality some were cattle razors some were over oil are you with me some are over baked baked goods come on now all these things god placed them in a certain way and if you ask a certain tribe how to look at something they would look at it through the perspective of their placement are you with me god never expected judah to look at things as levi looked at things or as ephraim looked at things or as manasseh no god placed them accordingly in his body and god has placed us accordingly in his body even with all of our peculiarities now it's true sometimes our opinions our desires our interests sometimes we can have some lofty things and god has to bring him right back in the word he's faithful to do that god's knowing with the desires that we would have in him and that's the same thing when we look at that even with a husband and wife and that's why i come back even to that point sometimes you can look at things and you can look at these scriptures in ephesians 5 and you could think i don't feel like i'm making any traction on any ground because i believe that every one of us no matter how old we are i believe that we can grow grow and grow in these scriptures i believe it's god's desire that this word would be fruition in our life let me just say this to you don't when has the word is coming forth god knows you would be here he knows i would be here god knew this time even these things that would come out in this season i sure didn't see it but god's seen it so if god seen that knew that you and i would be here i'll tell you what i do i just reach up and just what i'm going to do lord thank you for your grace i just want to take it down in my life and lord as i take it and i chew on it teach me teach me lord teach me lord in my life and in my walk because god knows he cares he cares i want you to think about this one god knows remember the scripture says he knows his sheep by name yet you and i look as all sheep yeah they're all sheep white wool but he says i know him by name you know you can walk in we were i grew up there on on on a sheep farm and you'd walk out there and uh the man who you know you could walk right in the barn and the man would come out this guy could pick out the different sheet to me they all look the same yeah one might be fatter than the other in this one but you all look the same sheep god knows each of us by name brother simon what are you saying he knows our peculiarities god knows how to deal personally with each of us once you think about this think about how god knows how to deal with us there was a lady who needed a healing touch in her body her daddy had passed on she did not know about brother branham didn't even know brother branham was in town but her dad this is scripture remember joel 2 ephesians are first corinthians 12. here she is she lays down on the bed she's wore out from cleaning she was cleaning houses she lays on the bed and goes to sleep and god sends her a dream of her daddy that's passed on and her daddy tells her go to a certain certain address and be there at this time for your healing god didn't have to do it that way are you understanding me god's not an iron fist it's a standard of the word but god brings his word not compromising it but god knows how to get our attention he knows just how to speak to our life and god could have used anybody but he knew it would have an impact if he sent her daddy because what her daddy was a methodist minister and had a lot of respect for him and she got up not knowing where that address was but she began to ask questions long story short she made it to the meeting to the place she had to ask a few people in order to get there it wasn't something she stepped out of the bed and she morphed there it was a lot of things that she had to go through but she got there and god healed her say that because if god would care so much about the little details of our life knowing little things that we like i mean some people don't like mountains some people don't like planes some people you know some people like the desert some people like god knows the things that you would like and he placed him here upon this earth and how much more has he prepared for our the way for our heavenly home how much more did he prepare a way for you and i to come into a real relationship with him how much more if he went and he prepared for you and i how much more than when we look at it for husband and wife and this example and how that we are to conduct our lives how much more if he cares that much how much should we care and say god help me teach me lord teach me because i tell you the very thing i'm just i'll just speak very plainly the desire of my heart oh it's not a question whether i have my wife's heart or not but i want to i want to continue to win her heart i don't say that for any i'd say that that's the truth and there's a lot of things there's a lot of things that god's had to teach me and he's still teaching a lot of things i'm doug honestly there's some things that i'll just give you a little insight and i'm not giving this to you for an example but in one way i am as it comes to me i'm a very practical kind of guy i look at things in terms of in this example try to give her flowers they're going to wilt by her sweater it'll last for years now that was brother samuel my practicality there's nothing wrong with that god will use that practicality but see god had to teach me sweaters are okay and all those other things but there's certain little things to do and it's not just flowers but it's little things to minister when i can find out those things that minister to her i want to do it i want to do it god knows how to minister to our needs and he loves the minister of our needs as a matter of fact he busies himself to minister to our needs okay this this the bible says he delights over us oh brother samuel is that really possible it is possible it's possible that will be done on earth as it is in heaven it's possible to have heaven in the it's home to have heaven in the home let's pray heavenly father lord jesus as we look into this great mystery that paul would write regarding that of christ in the church lord our hearts are stirred within us because in the spiritual side of it lord as we identify ourselves as the bride of jesus christ not not as just something that we are doing but lord by your spirit dwelling within us that directs us into the word because and when the spirit of truth has come he will lead and guide us into all truth so lord this is a pulsation from our heart it's our love would have failed a long time ago but lord the love of god cannot fail so lord as we look into these portions of the scripture as you've been stirring our hearts lord we just as we stand here lord thursday night after thursday night but sometimes lord as we just barely seeming like as far as what's in front of me moving at all forward lord in the lord in an outline as things continue to be added and so forth but lord i believe that we're moving according to your mind we don't want to be in a hurry we desire that every one of us spoke god that this grace would so move in our lives that god as your prophet said if we can learn in these areas when he would speak the message love he said if we can learn to love it will affect our relationships it'll affect our home life i believe that i'm a witness of that i'm speaking to witnesses but lord we want more [Music] we want more we desire lord our lives to be more like you now lord i'm asking lord that you'll help us this is an awful tall task that is impossible for man within himself but lord it's not impossible with you so lord may we not throw up our hands and say my what can i do but may we throw up our hands to say lord i surrender lord continue lord teach me lord show me thy way lord let the word that i'm hearing god let it just let my life be molded lord not conformed to this world but transformed by the renewing of my mind granted lord the mind of christ to operate lord in our lives a reflection of your life help us lord help us as husbands lord wives fathers and mothers lord all throughout this building lord god we ask lord jesus that you would continue to help us what lord what child of god desires to walk about with presuming no child of god wants to presume we desire to walk pleasing to you there's things that we want to please you lord and this is why as we we ask lord here in the spiritual realm oh god we want to we want to please you we want to serve lord serve you better not just serve you we we believe that that's the lord you've called us you've ordained us you've brought us to that place we want to serve you better help us lord help us father i pray this is where lord it's a striving to please to accommodate ourselves lord as that word is
