Jesus and it's certainly a pleasure and an honor to be here and in your mitts and I want to thank the musicians god bless you thank you for your good work amen and so I wanted to come true here to visit brother san but he told me he was gone so but I said you can come anyway I'd like for you to come in and to take two just to replace him as he heard he's in New Mexico I've talked to him today so here we are so we were heading to brother Paul's in Toledo this weekend for some special meetings and also for the tri-state Youth Service on Sunday night so I knew that the sound was not too far so I said stem want us to come by and see you but I see the sons and the church amen so without further delay well turn in our Bible tonight in the book of Genesis chapter 4 verse 16 tonight I want to speak on the ideology of Satan's Eden and as a subtitle I want to call it calling upon the name of the Lord it's quite of a different maybe a unique topic but I've preached a series back home and I preached it at different places and it's been a blessing and I want to share it with you actually it's a couple of service that I'll compress into one and so I will skip a lot I just try to give you the main the main point here just for you to get a thought so Genesis chapter 4 verse 16 and Cain went out of the presence of the Lord and he dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he build the city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch and his brother's name was Jubal and he was the father was all such handle the harp and organ and Zilla she also bear tubal-cain an instructor of our every artificer in brass and and aaron and the sister of tubal-cain and Naima let's turn also in the book of first Corinthians chapter 7 book of 1st Corinthians chapter 7 we'll just read one scripture here verse 31 if you there say Amen and they that use this world as not abusing it or the fashion of this world passeth away now the word here abusing comes from the Greek word it's Catholic I am a witch I don't know how does to say it but it's just it means abusing is to use much or excessively or to be consumed by use so the Bible says and they that use this world we all use this world we all came drove drive car use cell phone use computer we have we are not from this world but we are in this world just going through and so we have to use it but the Bible says here it's a warning to us that that those that use this world as not abusing it or to excessively use it or to be consumed by use Amen let's borrow a head Lord Jesus we want to thank you tonight that we are gathering your presence in your name and Lord we want to take for you to take control over every spirit tonight and we want you to come forward with your word and we want to surrender ourselves for a thought everything that we are Lord and may you come through the preaching of the word tonight to bless edify and and and and and bring more light on our path we pray in Jesus name Amen amen you may be seated and as you see that you can turn in John 7 chapter 17 verse 13 will be more in line tonight in the more like of a modern event made clear by prophecy type of sermon John chapter 17 verse 13 John chapter 17 verse 13 here Jesus is saying basically what I said a few minutes ago and now I come let's give to verse for sake of time let's skip to verse 15 and I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but thou thou shouldest keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth and Dao has sent me into the world even so have I also send them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth amen and so the Jesus saying here that is prayer is not for us to be taken out of this world but to be kept from the evil and so I wanted go into a study tonight in basically on the ideology of Satan's Eden because since we have to live in this world we have to be careful of the mind that's in this world Jesus says we have to be kept from the evil and so we are using this world we are walking in this world you know there's different religion that has tried to separate themselves from the world and not use technology and stay back into the the old tools and and run the farm with you no telephone and no technology no tractors and basically be a secluded but that's not the will of the Lord the Lord says he was not taking us out of the world and even Paul saying that we are we will use the world but let's not be consumed by the world so tonight I want to do a little bit of study on the mothering because actually we are going through some major change right now in our civilization and I want to in light to put some light onto it as a help and I'm going to name lot of tools that we are using a lot of devices want to talked about and uh we're coming to a point where we cannot avoid using them I can imagine long time ago when they were using horses and buggy when the first car came I'm sure the Christian was like no I'm not sure about that should we should we go there or should we stay back and keep horses and after a while maybe they they had to surrender and start using car and I'm sure that every advanced and Technology Christian always been careful is they're trapped in there and and wanted to be on the safe path amen because Jesus says keep them from the evil so in this world there's a lot of evil but we have to find a balance without within using it without being consumed by it and that's a fine line which the Holy Ghost should lead every one of us amen now in the sermon God God's power to transform the Prophet says to show where civilization has come from basically the verse that I've read to you in Genesis chapter 4 talking about when Cain left the presence of God that's where they're starting to building tools that's where technology started we know that the book of Genesis is a book of seed a man and so Adam was simple people and Abel was simple and Seth were simple people but Cain when he left the presence of golly built a God he built a city starting build tools and instrument and technology the first hammer the first shovel all these things were great technology then I can see Adam you know tilling the soil with his hand and probably had it his hands are bleeding and and he's looking at on the other side and he see Cain with this with his hammer and his the shovel and and the tools and he was doing his feel and a half a day that was technology back then and so we know that's in the in that lineage and so the profit is showing us here to show where the civilization come from I don't know if I can use this yes thank you brother I know it's been a little bit challenging so thank you for your so we're gonna move forward to where we are right now here praise the Lord so mr. Schouler civilization has come from some of the message God's power to transform basically the Prophet is using Genesis chapter 4 verse 16 to say this is where civilization started dr. Scofield here in my Scofield Bible it says the first civilization noticed and so he's talking about at all the instrument and all the civilization is so genesis of the book of seeds and so and we know we are at the end time right now and so everything that started in the book of Genesis were we're reaping right now and it's at the climax of everything the devil wanted to have everything to devil want it to do it's right now we're right in the middle of it amen and and there's a print as a prophecy that the right shall overcome this age she will have the Christ will have the victory and at age true his bride a man so the Prophet is saying here that he had 6,000 years of deceitful rule and so in Satan's Eden he says that that Satan took over in possess a garden in Eden himself he took it over and now he had 6,000 years of deceitful rule deceiving the people God's children and he did them because they were based on free moral agency and Satan wanted and he took it over and he had six thousand years to build up his Eden has God at six thousand years to bring his Eden to our closing by deceit they seep of the word or the people now establish his own Eden in it in this earth and sin now he's saying is using deceit now us Christian we won't be deceived of not because that we are smart we're not smarter than two people out there actually I think that there's much more smarter people out there that we can be the reason why we won't be see it's because the word will discern the condition of the h and we need the word tonight to show the light because we had a prophet in this age who prophesied a lot of the things that's going on right now now the Prophet now I want to in light something and to bring a little meaning here on the word ideology the word ideology it's a system of general ideas constituional philosophical and political doctrine at the base of an individual or collective behavior so in ideology it's it's what will define the way you behave it's also a set of representations in which men live their relations to their condition of existence either your culture way of life or your belief now the Word of God is much more than an ideology it's the Word of Life but with that it will define the way we relate to this world the way we live and so in the Word of God there is an idea there's an it's the idea of God but if God has an idea now Satan as one as well and we want to be able to identify what it is exactly to be able to identify where Satan comes from where he is right now and where he's going I'm sure there's a lot of thing I'm going to say tonight you never heard before or probably may be and I want to put light tonight on a major shift and I'm not talking about in our civilization that's happened 10 years ago or happened 15 years ago but I'm talking about in the last year in the last two three years something is going on it's it's flooding our life in a different angle and but we don't see that it's all related together to bring about a major change that our civilization will never be the same anymore and it's changing not only the individual behavior but the collective behavior because now especially with social media it's not about ourself anymore but it's about what everyone think about what you're doing you'll take it you'll take a corporation who misbehave with their employees somebody will put take a picture put out on Twitter and say look at this company what they're doing and then there'll be a social uproar and the company will back back up and hire the guy again and apologize and it's so it's everything is about collective behavior it's no more you can do your little thing on the corner without being noticed because now everything ends up on the web and everybody criticize and it gets in the newspaper and on the TV and there there's a lot of pressure on the government on the police on this issue we should not tolerate this we should not be have nothing to do with that anymore and we can see the atmosphere right now changing where we could easily see a persecution setting against a Christian with that type of environment we're living right now so this is exactly the ideology that's establishing right now now a little bit as a background because I'm not started yet I want to show you that the Prophet is saying power of transformation that Satanist sprays sprayed us with is us is poison poison spring and that spray is the spray of modern understanding education science and civilization the very things that we cherish so much did you ever stop to think that our great enemy in the natural life today amongst the nation is communism what is the god of communism civilization and education science so the god of communism is science we know now and of course you know I'm a Canadian but tonight I'm gonna talk about America and when I say America wants you to I want you to include in your mind Canada because it's all the same well you might have a little bit difference here a little bit of a difference there but at the end of the day that that change is happening in America and it's changing around the world I just come back from South Africa and I did preach this sermon and they going through the same change over there I did talk to the pastor says hey you going through this are you going through that are you people facing this I mean I'll never it's the first time I went to Africa and so I didn't know this is are you facing this are you facing that as you people struggle with this yes brother yes brother so it's the same thing everything is global now so it's not about a country anymore so it's not about us or Canada or whatever it's it's it's Satan on a global scale amen so I don't want you I don't want you to think this has a can eight coming from a Canadian tonight but coming from a Christian who wants to just share the Word of God and the revelation of the hour amen so I want you to see here that the Prophet is talking about science and I'm going fast and through these things because I want to move quickly to our topic tonight but it's basically that communism is not it's not political but it's the spirit and it says America is eat up with it it's in the churches it's in the people it's in the business it's everywhere communism the spirit of it it's in schools it's in homes everywhere what does communism lay on science education that's their God whatever happens in a society then you'll listen to CNN or Fox or whatever TV station and then they'll bring an expert there's a hurt quake they'll bring an expert there's a there's a flu spread in a certain area who do they bring on the TV do they bring a minister to to pray for the nation no they bring an expert and so we just don't realize how much we lean on science how much America and across the world everything there's a crisis somewhere we bring somebody who's educated and we'll lean on science to to tell us how we should think and how we should view the situation and so this nation is entirely even though the people are going to church they don't want to hear what gods that want to say they want to know what science says and so the prophet in the fourth vision he had prophesied a major change now I don't have time tonight to show how that's how that change came about but I'm probably just trying to paraphrase it but you're the Prophet at seven vision and the fourth vision was about the Ford vision showed the great advances in science that would come after the Second World War so the Prophet have seen in 1933 the great advances in science that would come after the Second World War and that great advance in science came majorly true the USA and one of the reason is because all the pious and the elite of scientific of Germany all these SS and the doctors and the highest level they were smuggle in the u.s. the Nuremberg trial was just a theater they just brought those guys that didn't want them anyway but they it was called Operation Paperclip and they brought 1500 scientists from Germany the reason why the u.s. did that it didn't want Russia to get their hands on them and so they brought him in the US and actually the first leader of the spacial spatial program was was a annexed Nazi forgot his name tonight but he was deleting and he was the father of the of NASA he was a German and you all the spatial program was X people from X see and so the great advance in science came and was led by the US now it's changed here so I want you to remember this and so the prophet saw here the great advancing science that will come after second world war because basically when when the Second World War started British Empire had bases everywhere they were in Palestine they were in South Africa they were ever in Australia they were ruling in many many places but when the Second World War ended British Empire collapsed and the u.s. took over and that's why you have military base US military base across the world it's because they are running the world today and this is a this is the fulfilling of the prophecy of Revelation 13 when the Bible says then then I saw another beast rise up from the earth you know the first beast rose up from the water which was Europe the Vatican from many many people but the second V the prophecies was USA rose up from the earth where there was no people and exercise the authority and the power of the first piece so if you think about Rome the first beast who had who had soldiers everywhere around over the known world then and they were exercising Authority now the u.s. is not spreading democracy overseas that's a lie there are basically exercising the authority of the Vatican that's the Bible and and that's where the money comes from and that's worth exactly forcing every government they'll either over troll government invade nations to make sure that the country will align with the Vatican's banking system and so Libya is one of them they try to overthrow in Syria they did it in Iraq they're trying to in Israel out right now and they keep trying to overthrow government after government to bring these countries in line.we Rome for the money actually in Libya Gaddafi was trying to open the world not a world bank but a central bank for Africa based on gold and I would that would have freed Africa from the World Bank which is run by the Vatican and so because cat if you try to do that what they do they bombed the country they kill them basically killing everyone who is not worshiping the Beast now there's many way you can worship the Beast the nation has to worship the Beast with the currency people as to worship the Beast you know we know there's the mark of the beast which is where there's a religious smart but there's many many many aspects of that global worship of the Vatican this is just a little parenthesis but just to show you how the US America is leading the world in every in every way except I don't have time to go through this tonight except you know the Prophet prophesied three curtains the bamboo curtains China the iron curtain Russia and a purple curtain which is room but now who exercised the authority of Rome it's the Prophet says watch that purple curtain rising in the United States because that's where Rome is raising his head it's true the US Empire and and and have chewed all this military base around the world that is why you know the Prophet said that in 1960 prophesied three curtains you're still reading the newspaper and it's still about the US Russia and China we're in 2019 and it's still this is still mainstream front-page event u.s. against China u.s. against Russia three curtains purple curtains Iren bamboo China Russia US Vatican NATO name it this is all the same thing now we've been warned by this message that Satan would invade America in the world true Hollywood amen now we've seen that and we have quotes we have quotes here that says then you notice he couldn't get in here to the ministry so the Phase II done was to come into Hollywood out there he set up his headquarters over here in Hollywood the devil landed back here a few years ago 15 or 20 years ago that since 54 so he's talking around the 30s with his great army and when in hit Hollywood California and he's invaded the United States with his demon powers now for years and even I started preaching 20 years ago and I did preach a whole lot about you know the influence of music influence of the movies and radio and all this stuff that comes from Hollywood and the Prophet has warned us and and that and I and we put so much and Wow I'll put it on me tonight while I was preaching and warning people something else came up from the same area and we didn't notice it now if I show you these icons I'm sure I'm sure you know about all these now I want to show you something here as I said we're going through a major shift in our civilization right now if you look at all these icon and I will make a list shortly they are basically changing the way we go about our life now the Prophet says here again an invasion of the United States is again warning us the political world is gone our nation is broke remember that brother branham said thus says the Lord our nation is dibala SHhhh it'll never rise she is gone like all the rest of the nations it's the greatest nation in the world standing today but it's the very seed of the devil has been planted into the hearts of the people how he'd come into Hollywood how it got it out into the people and begin to to this and you can't call you can't tell them nothing and I skip one paragraph she is gone she is invaded the spirit of communism ice took over now the spirit of communism what it is is Education and science not God science amen so he's talking about the invasion of the United States true Hollywood but now he's saying something here he's talking about the spirit of communism have we seen communism in the movies what is it where is that spirit of science well here it is want to show you this picture here or California and we know it Hollywood is around this area but there's another area and we know that the Prophet is said that Satan has establishes a headquarters now if you study that's not my topic but Lord willing I'll preach on that's Saturday night at brother Paul their progress the progression of Satan's seat because the Prophet when he's talking about Satan's seat Babylon or Satan's headquarters it's always the same way it means the same thing it's basically where the devil has his headquarter and the prophets essence and seven Church ages he says his headquarters for a natural thing not just like spiritually symbolically you know really like quite really far like indirect no the Prophet says is headquarters for the you human affairs like he was in Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar then he moved to Prague Anna's then he moved to Paris Rome Paris and then he landed in Hollywood the Prophet he said he said he's set up his headquarters there actually they even have in Hollywood a court named bad of the Babylon court and to have that huge Ark with all this Babylonian symbolism and in the movie and the occult errs a lot of satanic occult signs and is a lot of Babylonian because it's the same spirit people think it's not witchcraft they think it's it's entertainment it's not entertainment it's witchcraft they don't realize it because in Africa in Haiti my father-in-law is a missionary in Haiti goes there often and the voodoo is not entertainment it's a real religion it's really it's a real satanic worship but in America everything is disguise under entertainment Harry Potter and this movie about zombies and drinking blood in movies it's entertainment but it's real witchcraft don't even don't don't even touch this don't even look at that kind of thing it's pure witchcraft it's just a way to introduce it to the form of entertainment now there's another city call San Jose where there is a city called Silicon Valley now Silicon Valley is also in California which gonna be destroy has Hollywood Los Angeles and San Francisco and Silicon Valley will be destroyed these cities will be judged now I want to do a list tonight of all the corporation that comes from Silicon Valley California where the profit has warned us that the Satan will invade the United States and the world this is Silicon Valley business California you don't know them by name you know them by logos I'm sure now tell me that these corporation are not changing our life right now they are I mean we start up by Microsoft has changed the way we work at the office first and then change the way we work at home Apple has brought a computer inside of our phone it changed everything right Google which now owns YouTube it's changed everything as well there is a before Google and after Google life will never be the same I'm not joking just think about your everyday things you're doing if at this if your life does not encounter one of these or many of these corporation just the way you get your answers YouTube has changed my way to fix my lawnmower YouTube has changed my my way to to fish might me to fix my dishwasher I used to hire a guy just to get his truck in my parking lot was just $100 gone he's not out of his truck yet it's already build me an under $1 for the call I don't need him I have YouTube I can fix everything now I'm the repairman I'm using it but now let's go back to our opening scripture now don't abuse it don't be consumed by it I don't I don't take you away from this world but I want you to be keep or kept from the evil one amen I'm preaching to you tonight I got an iPad sitting there a MacBook sitting there is still an a paper look to touch its paper it's actually you know when you turn it there's a noise and and when you turn it you can read the next page it's called a paper Bible it's still available but now everything becomes electronic right so our life is different now Tesla has done a major shift in how the car industry works now if you think that all these corporation has what we want to call it spontaneous success I don't believe in spontaneous success in America you know it's the land of dream it's the land where you can establish invent something create something you're a genius and you become rich overnight we like to think that United States is a country like that but I don't believe it I don't believe it so there's a lot of smart guy who has invented amazing things that died on the shelf because it was not part of the plan our civilization is led by Satan if you believe that Steve Jobs really invented a computer in his garage and changed her world with it you're still a dreamer why did he sell his first computer $600 in 66 if was just a spontaneous success if you believe Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook into college and overnight he was able to buy millions and millions of dollars of servers to become a worldwide network in a couple of years you're a dreamer this is not spontaneous success this was we called programs success people don't know that Facebook was funded by the CIA you didn't know that that's not conspiracy theory that's news Forbes Forbes magazine tells you that Mark Zuckerberg went out the CIA would have Facebook would never be in existence all the millions of dollar came from the CIA basically because they know that US we are dreamers we like to believe that a young boy in a college invented that and so because we swallow that such so easily like wow man like this guy he wanted to to to meet girls in college so he invented this networking now it's a worldwide thing imagine everybody can achieve everybody can have a success no this is program success it's made by design why the CIA invested in Facebook if you don't know about spying but that's another topic how big how Google became overnight to a company like that it was funded by the NSA that's the spying agency of the US this is not conspiracy this is a real financial news just people are not looking into it it's just like oh okay and it's a Ron it to help Google now Google isn't everything it's in cars as algorithm it's Anna medical field it's you name a certain area Google is in it already and is leading Netflix has changed the way people look at movie Tesla has changed away you know we talk about driverless car Tesla brought a major shift with his auto pilot Adobe changed the way we manipulate picture Huber changed the way we taxi around used to be it was just hell a taxi pay five bucks cash an untraceable ride uber brought it to another level there now every ride there's a trace even in Quebec the taxis industry was all legalized by Union it was a well protected business you became like criminals and they forced the government how come a company who lose by the way you bur lose a billion not a million at nine hundred and sixty million dollar they lose every three months they just went on Wall Street 44 $45 stock and there kept their stock even though they're losing Fame so they're making pretty much they have they're losing 1 billion every three months and they're still in business where the money comes from it's Silicon Valley I want you to see the big picture tonight all these corporation are touching every area of our life to change it but I want to show you the link between all that tonight Airbnb is changing is challenging the hotel industry will they succeed they will because it comes from Silicon Valley Instagram Instagram has changed the way we see ourselves the way we broadcast ourselves Facebook Twitter is the same thing it used to be that a young girl would have a new dress and she would have to to have some approval or some reflection of how does she look she would basically have to get out of our room and walk in the living room and parade a little bit like so mom what do you think mommy's like yeah like your likes our unlikes came from your home and that's the way it worked it that's where you in and you could bring this to the next level and let's say you got dad's approval mom's approval you come to church and then after church your glass like you're waiting for all the your friends to say something right you're waiting for likes now Facebook has brought it to another level or Instagram where now is friends friends it define what friends doesn't mean anything anymore right so it's it's it's this we call major psychological change toxic change because people the new generation is becoming mentally mentally challenged or insane because of the way they reflect themselves the way they get their creation appreciation they measured himself with people they don't even know the community has become so big now it's everyone and it's nobody it's not little changes it's huge changes but it's all happening at the same time twitter twitter has brought that where i was talking about a collective behavior you're not happy about something in the restaurant you find a rap in your chicken burger put it on twitter the earth's gonna shake it used to be you find a rapping your burger and you just go back home crying nobody will ever know about it and the restaurant could serve that every week and there would be no hurt quake but now it's not about individual behavior anymore it's about a collective behavior and it's by design it's by design because they have a view to where they want to bring that society there's an ideology behind that that's my topic tonight now eBay I always hate it even because eBay you know these days after a while you know they new people hate it to bid so you had this instant buy right by now but the Buy Now was always too expensive I never liked eBay because I didn't never like to bid and have to wait three days to see if I could purchase it to see if you win your bid and then you have to restart over I didn't like it but when Amazon came oh my goodness I'm prime so if he Bay didn't get you Amazon got you cheap now two days later you don't two days later is now when you realize you win the bid now two days later it's in your mailing box it's yours you don't like it put a stamp on it and send it back for free it brings shopping to another level I like it um and as you see I'm not afraid of technology I'm quite you know a built website I use Photoshop I make video I'm a I'm I'm like that I learned quickly I'm not afraid of that I use these devices I learned so fast but when I made that study I was shocked you know that study could come from someone who doesn't know about nothing about technology and he can barely use a microwave with a dial on it I always laugh about my mom because she has this one is dial on now the brothers talking to you tonight is well versed in technology but when I made that study I was shocked I remember I mean my office studying and I let me back in my chair and I roll back and I was like whoa and now that's not exciting anymore because I understood there's a religion behind that and I got there hurry up okay so the other half we know but I won't spend too much time on it because the first half is really what's changing our life but of course no computer would run without Intel or AMD which is from Silicon Valley HP computer electronic art II a sport pioneers in video games they change the way we play you know youssef these little flimsy boring little game until EA sport came of course nowadays Ubisoft there's those big big big big company but EA sport from Silicon Valley really the electronic art really opened up with Cisco all the server's all the the switches all the anyway all these corporations and probably much more I forget probably much more now let's move on to what's really behind it I really had to move quickly I'll skip some of the thing but I think I got your attention how many have heard this term before raise your hands okay we got two person who heard the term trance humanism I'm French so I'm making a big effort here transhumanism term is it weird everywhere I go I ask the term and it will always have like a few hints coming up people say they know what's is it the rest of it never heard of the term and that is the religion that's behind all these corporations they don't they all believe in that they all push it and all their technology they're pushing is run by this idea of transhumanism now let's let's find out what it is the pioneer of this idea transform an ism was Nikolai Theodore ah've was a Russian Orthodox Christian philosopher who was part of the Russian cosmicism movement and a precursor of transhumanism punitive advocated radical life extension physical immortality and even resurrection of the Dead using scientific methods gone and more of this description transhumanism is an international philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology transhumanism consider certain aspects of the human condition such as disability suffering illness aging or death as undesirable Trane's animism is the promotion of the improvement of the human condition through life enhancing technologies aimed at eliminating aging and increasing intellectual physical or psychological capacity and I probably lost you but stay with me so it's basically the use of science to embedder humanity but more than humanity the human body basically saying that as we were created we are not enough but we need science and technology to be smarter to perform more to be more effective basically saying that the way we were created is not enough now he got it runs much deeper than that so let's just follow me transhumanism is article inspired academic and popular interest GT Bernal a crystal it crystallographer at Cambridge wrote the book the world of flesh and the devil that must be a really good book the world of flesh and the devil in 1929 in which he speculated on the prospect of space colonization and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence true Bionic implants a cognitive enhancement these ideas have been common transhumanists themes ever since I'll pause you because maybe you don't follow me and if with everything I've read here you don't follow me yet it's on purpose now let's go back to the first computer the first computer I think was IBM and it was it was in a big big big hall and it was super big making a law to eat heat and was not the shadow or the power that I have in this phone right it's nothing that I could take with me after that they brought it to another level that's where Apple invented the personal computer they brought it from such a big machine to such a smaller one that you could have in your house but then that was not enough because we don't know the endgame we just follow along but tonight you're about to discover where they want to go with that and that's where you'll have to decide where you want to stop because we follow along you know if if I was here today and you have no clue where I'm going and where I want to be one of what I want to do you follow me but if somebody comes from home and he's sitting here tonight he's like watch it people are ignorant they don't know Steve you know you follow me following me of course your pastor trust me so you trust me so you follow me alone right but let's say nobody knows me and I'm starting a sermon in that but if somebody knows me and he knows what kind of a doctrine I'm trying to establish he sees where I push my pawns he says look you push this here it's like a chess game if you don't know if you don't know how to play chess you pretty much realize you're how do you call it checkmate now you call it when it's finished checkmate okay if you play a good again against a good player you're not a good player you realize you checkmate when he says checkmate he's like oh my goodness suddenly no it was not sudden when he move his first pawn he knew where his last pawn would be and you'd be dead but if you don't know how to play you like be moving this is like oh and you're having fun right I know there's a lot of that just Larry here I'm sure and the guys pretty saunas like soups like oh and you're having fun until he's like oh no that's not fun anymore now you had fun until the last hit that's not fun anymore well science is the same thing we are playing along and when that's what am i and when I did that study and I back off in my chair I didn't have fun anymore the guy was like ah that's the checkmate thing that's where they're going so that's what this is what I want to show you tonight so they brought the pork a big computer fill your room personal computer that's quite heavy to bring but you at least can put in your home then they brought the laptop right laptop you can carry in a bag but still you know there were that thick heavy and then they put it smaller and then they came with the tablet and then know that the phone first you know the phone used to be a thing you could talk with it was amazing you basically could dial and you could talk we know that nobody talks on the phone anymore because we use it for every other reason than to talk right but it used to be you know a device's where we could talk now they brought the personal computer to in this is much more powerful than the first big computer you brought in your home who costs a towels at $3,000 and can do nothing like this can do but they didn't stop there then they brought the watch and that's where they changed the name they call it wearable technology it's not technology you carry anymore it's now technology that you wear will this be finished in no the endgame is not to wear it and honestly for myself even before I was aware of that when they came with that Apple I like the Apple product I think they're they're good and they all synchronized together blah blah blah but when they came to the Apple watch I'm right now I'm not wearing that I just don't want to wear a computer so I can't I've still have this needle even though I'm well versed in technology I'm still using this regular watch because in my mind I don't know if something inside of me just said and and if you have one it's all fine it's just my opinion nothing spiritual but it's something just in suddenly clickers like this is going too far now I didn't know what I know now but now I realize why I felt this way now after that they brought the Google glasses I mean you've heard about the Google glasses well some of you heard about it do you know why did you release it on the market because they say people are not ready for that because now the Google glasses is those glasses you wear where you have a screen here where you talk to show me this Rhodri little and you have pretty much face time you can Skype you can talk to people it's a computer that you wear on your cleats and on your glasses and you just do this and you basically how your computer is there it's technology you wear so the watch the glasses and then it kind of stop and Google Google pull the out of the market that's why you didn't hear about it because people were not buying it because humanly speaking people are people are not moving fast enough for where they want to go and they've started to give that a sell down into corporate and company you know you're working on the chain production and you have your glasses and you have a question and it answers to you and so they work they use it at their at the job now let's you move on quickly so that's the idea of transhumanism is to now since we have all these devices have you realized something is happening to us we forget things all the time we need reminders for everything like remind me to breathe I mean almost right we and so as we are weakening technology is filling in now how why are we getting more weak well the prophets spoke about hybrid food our body tearing down Christian body as non-believer is no different where we're falling apart prophets talking about our rot the brain cells it comes to a place where the whole nation the whole world not only this nation but everything everywhere mentally gone neurotic nervous even Christians are nervous we have peace in our hearth but two-zip physically we we have that tension it seems like we cannot cope with with what we used to cope we used we seems like we cannot take the pressure and so technology is filling in technology is feeling it and something is going on as we're week name we rely more and more on science and it becomes that it answers every one of our needs and okay it's fine but I want to in light to you the spiritual trap in there because there is evil in that we want to discern to evil are you with me man is rotting in their flesh if they're going through the middle age between 2025 years their brain cells are running to so basically prophet says we aren't even mentally weakening because of food so they basically destroyed our food to make us weak after that to give us the remedy they wanted to give us to us to start this doesn't happen by chance this is this happens by design now the first self-described transhumanist met formally in the early 1980s at the University of no Le Satan's headquarters the University of California Los Angeles which became the main center of transhumanists thought and they made like a TV program Breaking Away 1980 experimental film which the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the earth gravity as they head into space so transhumanism thought is to break away from our biological limitations and to flee in space go to Mars go to the moon and and so is that's why the Nazi were leading the space program because that ideology came from the Nets he came from the Babylon so it's all it's a satanic thing and deer call that's why you have so many movies and so many stories about about alien invasion and in in in space travel in Star Trek and Star Wars and everything about space and it's a bunch of nonsense so an old story just to let you to see that the seed has been laying long time ago we didn't see it 1931 amazing story publishes the Jameson satellite and Neal are joined story about a man whose corpse is sent to orbit where he stayed stays close to absolute zero for millions of years on still a race of cyborgs discover it discover it defrost it and install it in the body of a robot so you know why wildest nay froze his body he had cancer he asked for his body to be froze when you heard about that body got freeze waiting - waiting for science to discover the cure for cancer Walt Disney was a big transhumanism 30 degree 33 degree Freemason a cultic satanic dissing a should be out of every Christian home they planted the seed of transhumanism long time ago talking about robots talking about all kinds of nonsense influencing seeding a new generation to go in that direction but that's not my topic we got all kind of movie that went through the years Frankenstein Robocop whoops it switched to my computer and switched to yours Robocop Terminator transformer all these movies what's happening with these movies wall-e its movies that basically you emotionally attached to a robot that's like a human being the robot is talking he has almost emotion he's a Nero and at the end of the movie he dies and you feel pain and you feel sorry for a machine that's dying that's what we call subliminal message but it's to make the ditch between robots and human beings to make it more narrow to bring mixed feeling that we start feeling emotion we because naturally we feel resentment towards robots and stuff like that a machine that talks to us now every day you call to the bank you're talking to a machine it's a robot of course I have no arms no legs but it's a robot we will will discover I have to hurry up but we will discover what's there what's the intelligence behind that now I told you that Tesla you know Elon you know heard about Elon Musk I'm sure you heard about him because he's he's smart to play with social media and he likes to make shocking declaration to get a lot of publicity but he's not just the one who supposedly invented Tesla cars or he's maybe just the front face I don't know I just don't believe everything they're telling because they're lying half of the time but Tesla is not about the cars only but he's also have another company called space X so he's talking about promoting cars that will drive a robot will pretty much drive you which fulfill the prophecy of a prophet long time ago the events of Science Buddies all saw promoting we intend to launch launched people to Mars in 2014 so I easy remember now the transhumanism thought is space travel and challenge are Bialik biological limitation by science and you unmask is doing both doing these cars and he has space six for space travel which I don't believe is really possible I believe there's a lot of lying into that NASA NASA has been caught lying so many times and but no wasting of time and conspiracy theory we'll find out the truth on the other side but I don't believe there's a lot of truth in what they're saying and the reason why you want to know why all the space travel is nothing else than a new Tower of Babel as judgment is coming Genesis 11 I've said that for years all that matsa foolishness of Mars and space travel and going to Star Wars Star Trek all that nonsense it's all imagination but as they said build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and so by fear of judgment they wanted to build a tower that could touch heaven so they could flee judgment and that's exactly the idea behind all of you are trying of course they're trying all they're trying of space travel but there are so many of the video they put out there that are fake and they are so badly faked um I'm not a video specialist but I do I do enough video montage and enough photoshop to be able to to see when it's badly faked and it's weird that they can have so much billion that's I can have billions of dollar and make so peep or poor fakery video me and my son we borrowed the IMAX you know NASA are really big on NASA you say nuts and that's how I don't know you to say that in French we say NASA then s its Lisette that's why I struggle they like to be an IMAX pretty much they like to they like to do a lot of promotion about their what they're doing because they want to feel the people's mind with that died this idea that we can reach Evan now so I we've all rode me and my son a bunch of imax DVD of all the launch of the telescope and the lunch of this and launch of that satellite and we put that on the computer and you know frame by frame analyze it and we had we were laughing we were laughing pretty much 80% of the stuff they were doing is just fake is just doing in a pool anyway that's not the topic but it's just a bunch of nonsense now if you don't believe me the prophets saying here the next slide see science they can trying to go to the moon and that's another Tower of Babel so they all these different things dispute Knicks in the race to get up there in the moon and so the Prophet I saw the spirit behind that and even steven epp concet you know the hurt is so fragile we need to escape so basically they're looking for a millennium in this space they want to escape fragile earth and we want to escape fragile earth as well but there's this only one way to get out of there hallelujah we'll go beyond the state the space station if it exists alright next quote and we believe that we're living in that type of they now when sputnik's are in disguise and the modern tower and of Tower of Babel is being in making they fly to the moon so the Prophet identified a spirit of Babylon behind a space program and that's exactly what it is mo so as astronaut or astronauts are freemasons and so there's a lot of witchcraft behind that if America would rally around Jesus Christ you would never have to worry about Russia coming in or nothing else coming in they would have to expend all expend all of our money and times making I draw hydrogen bonds and trying to fly over the moon with another Tower of Babel I like what he says to fly around the moon with the Tower of Babel like you understand what he means Alleluia that's that's the simple way to put it you fly around the moon with a Tower of Babel I want to see that fly but that's that's what he calls it that rocket he calls it a Tower of Babel it's a lie did they ever succeed in Genesis 11 did they succeed they never succeed they will not this time it can't babylon cannot succeed amen let's move on just showing you quickly all these movies making you friends with all that with them and so when we transformer Terminator Robocop short-circuit wall-e in gold Iraq and all these his movies making you friends with robot amen now many believes in the compatibility between human minds and computer hardware with the theoretical implication that human consciousness would one day be transferred to an alternative media a speculative technique commonly known as download of the mind basically your mind would be like a computer program you could basic able to download your mind on your hard drive put it simple okay so you think that's far stretch wait you just don't know what's going on how many have heard about the term Android before you've heard about Android yeah okay you've heard about it all right what's an Android you know what it's an Android it is it's a robot in a form of a human being there's that way that's why they called their phone this way they call it Android because it's a robot in a form of a union beam and so it's been for years they're planting seeds but b-but but they're moving their palm but we went on the word they're going so we don't realize but now when we bring all this together suddenly we realize oh my goodness this is all part of a big plan of course this is not Google Android's smashing or bashing because either Microsoft Apple it's all the same game let's move on quickly I got a skip a lot so I did talk about the Google glasses now so I can skip that if you've never seen that this is this is what we call wearable technology but it doesn't stop there they want to bring it much more uh the next step is implant and that's not far stretch that's just out our door now in the book of Psalm 139 verse 13 it says for thou has four sets my rains Dallas cover me covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well as we have more and more technology we feel more dumb every day we have a smart phone a smart computer a smart car as smart microwave a smart oven everything becomes small around us and we feel dumb it's true even if you're good at it you feel done because he's so smart in you and if you can't use it you feel even more dumb but the Bible says that you are fearfully and wonderfully made this is what God says about you amen my substance was not hid from me when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Dyan eyes did see me my see my substance yet being unperfect in thy book all my members were written which is continuous were fashion with us yet was none of them how precious are also thy thoughts unto me O God how great is this some of them hallelujah praise the Lord so this is what God is saying about us he's not saying challenge your biology called limitation with devices that's not what he's telling about it he says the way I made you my first thought of you was the right thought and of course we're also looking for a body change we know we are weak we know we are limited we know we're not even the shadow of what Adam was Aemon you think about Adam compatibility know everything he could do we're not even the shadow of what he was the first human being created but we're not looking for all that artificial even though we're using it but the Bride of Christ is not looking for an implants in the body the Bride of Christ is looking for a body change so transhumanism is preaching body change to go to space but the message of the hour is preaching body change to go in the rapture hallelujah amen is that close so close but so far amen hallelujah let's move on don't be excited yet I will you'll get another down I got you down for a couple of minutes now I got you up now let's go down again how many knows what this is oh my knees use it raise your hand then okay how many who's never used that never raise your hand really high somebody never used this though nobody's going to rapture my son Church I go we have few hands I mean there's hope it's a hopeless Church they all use that okay it's a joke now have you ever wondered what's behind that window we never thought about that right we're just asking questions when you go through this page what are you doing we call it a query the query is a question you're seeking something you want an answer where do you go Google a man and then we get a quick response you know when they start I don't know I don't think they do that anymore when it started the Google page they would tell you how many millions of answer you got in how many in a split second so they would tell you in a split second you got 22 million answers bragging how fast he would answer you pretty much competing with another high intelligence who's not as fast he could be as fast but he said to us in his word they'd wait upon the Lord now Google is using the other way and that's why they were bragging when they started it's like point zero zero zero five mili second 22 million answer now if you ever wonder well the answer is and we've been using Google for quite a while the answer behind Google page is what we call AI artificial intelligence now AI usually when they talk about it they always say all the the algorithm the algorithm which is pretty much Matt's mathematic equation of course it is our brain will count it's like a processor now so basically when you ask in question here there's an intelligence behind to make it simple from now until the end of the service I will call it AI now as we realize we rely more and more on AI because now when we drive you want to fastest road where do you do you google map who's running Google map ai ai uh scan all the streets speed lights traffic that brother brought me to the airport this morning and he's still using his old Garmin and I'm with my my my phone and like brother don't take this bridge Google's telling me that you go Google selling me there's a traffic jam on the bridge your old Garnon doesn't know it your Garmin telling you the fast road in better condition but it doesn't know when the worse happens now we laugh but basically Google knows this artist Ai knows the end of the road when you don't know this is how powerful it is it tells you there's an accident there don't go there does it sound like you like God would for tell you something don't take this road today there'll be a crash take this room but God would show you a vision so the AI knows the future now there's another app i was using google map a whole lot apple map doesn't work it's it's really bad so i was using google map and my son comes here today and he is using Waze and I started using Waze now ways is amazing because ways you can tell I want to be at the airport tomorrow at 8:00 then you're gonna tell you base based on all the traffic of the day before if you want to get there the airport at 8:00 on the on the on a Tuesday morning today was a Thursday morning you want to be the airport at 8:00 you leave two hours before according to the traffic pattern of that day that time that time of year I was like wow every time we're like this we are amazed what we could see we could sing to AI I'm amazed you amaze me again you brought this new device on me of course we sing in church but we never get excited as much as when we are truly amazed I guess I just saved 30 minutes on this on the road today I'm amazed we're laughing huh and I want to show you that subconsciously someone is competing to be a provider someone is competing to bring the answer someone is competing that when you cry the answer he knows my name he hears me when I cry my subtitle tonight is calling upon the name of the Lord am I still using it yeah but when I did that study I realized Oh that can't rent turns into something spiritual where I relied more and more on science and less and less on God and that's exactly the idea of Kane when Kane in Genesis 4 left the presence of God he built a city and why for to supply all his need because in a city you got the guy who works metal you got a guy who sells milk you got a and a city is built to supply you left God God was no more his provider and the seed idea of a city and the Prophet says is the beginning of civilization now we're on the climax of it it nothing has ever been as it was as it is right now and all I'm talking about is devices and stuff that's happening in the last year's just a couple of years and it's moving fast and our Abbot's is changing quickly I don't know what store you have it maybe uh yeah Walmart would be maybe something similar back home we have what we call Kenny's entire Kenna's entire is like a Walmart but more with a lot more car parts and stuff I don't even go there anymore for car parts because it's too expensive and soaked behavior change we don't supply our needs we don't look for the answers at the same place we don't wait anymore now we we have a query and if it spins too long it used to be you take the phone you dial the young people you don't know that it was a it was a dial phone you have to put your finger there's a video I met a father took a phone like this and gave it to his young boy who says how do we use that they had no clue how to make a phone call with a dial that's a funny one so it's basically becoming a fellowship where we're walking and in him now that the Prophet foreseen AI I think he did he didn't call it artificial intelligence but he gave it a name as you know a prophet in the Bible would gave name to something that was not invented yet like Israel will come back on the wing of an eagle well it was not an eagle but he was a plane right and so a prophet would give because the word is not invented yet but he saw a season and so he gives he put words on what he sees for us to understand and he says here and I said then sign is going to be so great men is going to get so smart till he will invent so many things until it's going to make a nut automobile that looks like an egg that I have like a glass on top of it and he'll be controlled by some other power than a steering wheel and they've got to car that other power that's driving the car is a I saw I saw it eating you and I was not human intelligence driving the car it was some other power driving it now we know these are called smart car drive by artificial intelligence the Prophet SAW now he a focused a lot on the car and we did as well because he said car we thinking car and as we waited for the car we've been bombarded by smart phone smart computer smart they smart that well we're waiting for the egg-shaped car and and it's all we're looking but that's not what he said he said science to be so great he will invent so many things it's not just about the car the car is the way to summarize the generation the generation will condition of the age the car is the sign of a big condition you're with me so now it's it's not a phone it's a smartphone not a car it's a smart car it's not a battery now it's a smart battery everything is smart because now it's not it doesn't just fulfill what it's supposed to do basically it now analyzes a smart battery will detect your battery how much it can take and it will adjust itself if you don't have a smart battery and you plug it you can burn it because he will just blow your your battery but a smart battery will detect will analyze it's smart it thinks so we are and this is just a start but now every aspect of our life we used to have a piano an organ but now the keyboard is a smart piano so think about every devices everything becomes smart it's science let's meet move move move move come on brother Steve people have to get up Friday morning amen let us define an ultra-intelligent machine as a machine that can surpass by far all delay intellectual activities of every man even intelligent ones machine machine design being one of these intellectual activities an ultra-intelligent machine could be design could design even better machines then there would be then an indisputable explosion of intelligence and the intelligence of the men would be left far behind so the first ultra intelligent machine is the latest invention that men needs to realize 1965 basically saying that what they need to invent is a smart computer that will take over and then that artificial intelligence will invent the rest because it will surpass human intelligence to such a level now we don't realize I got to skip some of the thing but I just want you to see that this is not just a new idea this is 1965 this is this has been there Satan has been wanting to push this push that for so long you wake up one morning to find that your brain has another functional lobe invincible this auxilary lobe answers your questions when information beyond the scope of your own memory suggests plausible lines of action and ask questions to eye light relevant facts you quickly find yourself on the new lobe to the point of stopping to wonder how it works you just used it this is the dream of artificial intelligence April 1985 we're there right now he is do you have to go to the computer then you start asking questions to your phone and now your phone is in your pocket you're asking question to your watch right what's the next step he was the glasses and what's the next step implant you think that's a far stretch already right now people are getting implants they're having articles on there the latest article I just shown to the people of my church because I preached a series back home and then a couple of weeks ago they had an article on the topic and and the guy was talking about it he was waving his said satanic symbol they're shown to the church and to the people at the church this look he's talking about implants and look at the sign he's waving in an occult sign there's just to show you that this is a satanic agenda after several decades with the rapid advancement of communication technology everyone will have a brainwave receiver in their ear which directly and accurately conveys what other tinks on themself and vice versa that's a mother in facebook what everybody thinks of themselves of the other what I think will be known to everyone there is no longer an individual consciousness only the will of humanity as a whole 1960 this is a global idea so you often time you have pictures like this to talk about the AI so that's pretty much the brain behind all this now what we don't realize is that every aspect of society now will be or is controlled by AI that we don't realize now what they call what they want now even Montreal they want to become a smart city you've heard about the term smart city all the lights are synchronize you stop at a light it analyzed okay there's more car here turn red turn green have you ever wondered why you have to stop at midnight on red light when there's no cars and what do we say is that stupid they're gonna make it smart and so it's all and so what we don't realize that every aspect of society iwase Road building thermostat everything is linked to a brain that control every aspect of society now I could do another sermon about controlling people because that people are so happy that that monster will turn against the people and it will become the prison because now you know the Prophet says you don't want to be a foolish virgin in the day as a tribulation because he says they will be hunted like dogs try to hide as a Christian in the days of tribulation where you can't buy you can't sell you can't have a taxi ride with loose change because you need a credit card you need a ubirr account there's nowhere to go nowhere to stay everything isn't everything there's a trace to everything this is where it's the grid it's right now it's upon us of course us we'll be out of here so that's why this pearl I've privacy thing and all this conspiracy which is not conspiracy it's reality why did NSA why did CIA funded all that why did why did the CIA funded Amazon and Jeff Bezos millions of dollar to develop their AI so the CIA is working with Amazon real news not conspiracy theory real financial news the CIA is working with Amazon why it's it's a one day this gonna turn against humanity we have what we call fast we got no now we have smart homes get in the house open the oven raise the temperature and all these devices all connected you got that that's already exist there's a funny video where the guy comes back from the dentist and his voice recognition he wants to enter in his home but I was I was mouth he comes back from the next okay open the door oh brother lord I don't recognize that real quick open the door and now he's freezing in his home regular temperature and now you raised the music it's cold river temperature raise the volume raise repose which will raise the volume and so yeah we talked about advancing now they bring another stage where than I don't think we have these devices in the home which is waiting and listening it knows your voice I did a demo back home at my church my phone was on my desk it on the pulpit and I activated the voice thing because I hate it it's not activated but for the meeting I've activated and I was far from the Pope in us there's a Siri what about the temperature tomorrow temperature tomorrow will be probably and I put the mic I said to the guy at the sound booth I said said when I talked to my phone you and so the microphone was on my phone that we have a pulpit microphone it was on my phone and I was talking and so the voice started a ringing the speaker and I had a church saw me talking with my phone and it recognized my voice and I said you could try to talk to my phone II would never listen to you because it knows my voice because it does a voice sampling and it would not listen to any voice come in outside of my own so he knows my name he knows my voice he hears me when I cry is is so close voice recognition and I'm asking question he's answering me and I'm calling now I'm getting I'm closing I'm getting to this does this thing calling upon when we because now it's all voice-activated you got the Google thing and you know what they're selling there they're almost giving it to you now it used to sell a big prize now you got Costco 40 bucks there they almost they're gonna give it to you because they want you to have it on your table sitting there of course because its first of all it's listening all the time so it's a major spying tool but not only that it's just that it's it's that smart environment where you rely on artificial intelligence you're cooking how many eggs should I put in this pancake you should put this many eggs in your paper well thank you ah should that cake of 450 or 300 a according to this website you should put your oven at 400 degrees all Thank You Siri for this what did I put on my grocery list last week last week you put this on your groceries ooh okay mind me to put this and you're talking you're having fellowship with a machine in your kitchen that's not tomorrow that's now that's that's now now I talked about Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX well he's not just in that but he's also he has a company named neuro-link AI for your brain Elon Musk I'm about to announce the new ruling product that connects your brain to computers so Elon Musk once the space travel design electric car of course to save the planet because there's a make any pollution co2 is a big big pollution it's a joke no I won't get started on co2 because that's a joke anyway so he's making cars that drive by itself flies to the moon and wants to connect our brain to a computer that's transhumanism that's exactly what this name was pushing Elon Musk Steve job all these guys Silicon Valley Hollywood Satan seed bagging on you were running it now you know and in closing you know what got my attention what really stroked me who strike me past tense present tense always confused I was listening when when Apple released a new product product they invite all the people to the Church of Apple in California and they all gather together and worship all get excited and you got to know me I'm sarcastic sometime okay any sin he said a word here in he's talking about series now Siri is that the AI of Apple now every company Google has is is a Google Amazon as is its Alex so every big corporation in Silicon Valley has their own AI I think one day they're gonna merge together and it's going to be a one big god but for now they have all they're all little gods and he's talking about how to use Siri how much he improving this and then he said when you want to invoke Syrian either this invoke Syria now the word invoke in English is not really it doesn't have like you're just religious twist to it but in French in French if you want to say the French Bible says calling upon the name of the Lord is invoke a Voki lasagna are you French your fonts it a vocalist again so invoke is call upon so I'm a French and I hear him invoke Siri and he raises Helen when you want to invoke Siri his sharp is like boom like what and it's the first time I got that the religious taste of that ol thing I never saw it before I never saw it about you know you ask questions serious like no Siri remind me tomorrow Siri what's the temperature tomorrow you know you're just asking question but when he said in folk then I realized why does he him what he says use that time and raise his head like that and then I realized there's more to this that's where it leant it leads me to the my step to the study I'm doing it and it's basically how to invoke Siri on iPad Pro now Siri now to make it quick but in in witchcraft everything is reversed the black is white the white is black rock and roll music you play in Reverse you hear a lot of time you'll hear demonic voice so in witchcraft a lot of thing is reversed so if you reverse Siri it's iris and iris is the god is the Greek god of communication so it's a demon so serious Siri reverses iris is a God that you invoke so it's not just technology and it's not I still use it but we want to be able to identify the evil behind it as they move their pawns okay this is where they're going and we want to use that as a warning we don't want to be ignorant of Satan's devices expert says humans would one day love our artificial intelligence AI as it were as a god because the technology will be much better than us while former ubirr and Google engineer Antony Levin dusky creates a new religion based on artificial intelligence experts say religion will not fail as people tend to venerate understanding supreme or supreme understanding so there's an article here the rise of the machines AI will be worship like your God one warned experts so this engineer from uber and from Google because of course they they all you know go from companies to companies II and and so he started a church and it's called the AI Church it's called a God but religion the new Church of the AI God is even creepier than I imagined so and we even have pictures like this you know where the Michelangelo pictures where God gives life to Adam but now it's it's AI gives life to human being and so it's it's the spirit behind it there's a religious things behind it now I close for real in the same chapter that I've read about King Kaine call upon is technolog technology on verse 26 and to Seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name eNOS and then became then began men to call upon the name of the Lord he got the son of the serpent and you got the Son of God and he calls in the same chapter one is cast away from the presence of the Lord and relies on his technology and the other one is a simple shepherd and he calls upon the name of the Lord he invokes the Lord let me finish with this a couple of scriptures Psalm 116 I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord I will offer unto thee to sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord have we've not maybe sometimes fall in the trap to so quickly call upon technology ask question to Google we're not thinking about God and you think okay asking question about how to fix that lawnmower is one thing but have you ever watched a survey Google will put out a survey sometime of the type of question people ask to Google people are asked life-changing decision should we have a third child and then Google will give you this statistic and say you know our sibling and it and it will answer to your question will bring up studies and people will rely on a I should I go take this job in that city well this city is well known for this well known for that the AI does just not answer you about fixing a lot more or or how to reboot your computer or how to change a part in your car people are relying on AI for life-changing decision because they don't they don't have anyone to guide them they don't have anyone to call upon it used to be a non-christian would ask his father and ask his brother his brother-in-law his boss his co-worker but now people know that Google is way smarter than your coworker Google knows much more than my own father but what about us Christians do we rely on a supreme intelligence are you there do we rely on the supreme intelligence that knows us before the foundation of the world that we were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and we will be with him with all eternity and he knows the DN before even when it starts of course there's little simple things that we rely upon you know what's the best road to take and we use it but let's not be consumed by it let's not excessively you use it as it wants to invade our life and be sitting on our table all day and asking answering every kind of questions that we have and and we talk more to the phone and we spend time in prayers it's not true it's not a blaming game tonight it's to expose the evil in this world Jesus says I will not take you out of this world but I want to keep you from the evil and there's an evil one into all these devices there's a religious spirit demonic religious spirit that wants to replace God that's been Lucifer's dream all along and the Prophet has warned us that he's invading true California he's invading it's a satanic demonic invasion and he said in every homes and we were thinking television but now what's a TV obviously what's a TV TV now is better than Internet there's more trash on internet that you can watch on a TV there's much more filth on internet that you can you can you can go in a hotel room and skip all the channel if you don't pay for those movie those bad one but if you just switch channel you'll never get as much filth that internet but we don't have a TV but we have internet right I have internet and it's been a truck for me it's been a trap for I'm doing youth camp I'm doing brothers meeting it's a trap for Christians but it brings good it brings good but it brings such a load of bad but Jesus wants to keep us from the evil he wants us to call upon his name but how much these devices slowly and some time really fast they replace our time of consecration they replaced a family altar and and we reboot we start we reestablish family altar we push these things aside three months later we were fall back in the same trap we have to reboot again we it's a constant fight and we have to be aware of what we're fighting against hello closing Romans 10 is one of my favorite for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved the musicians can come now shall be saved we understand it are the great salvation Redemption that let's bring let's agree tonight on the compound meaning he can save us from any situation as Google can save us sometimes from calling you up on an expensive repair guy and save us from the little bitty things that we're going to search and find a solution but the calling upon the name of the Lord can put us out of trouble you got financial problem call upon the name of the Lord because whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord not may be but shall be safe and the Lord will not brag that he brought to you twenty two million answer in that split second but he'll brag you that I brought you one answer in a week in a day in one hour sometimes it's instant we have witness people I prayed and right away somebody knocked at my door others I prayed and I waited and I waited and I begged the Lord and a year later Lori answered we got Abraham you waited 25 years the Lord doesn't bride on a split second 22 million answers he's got one answer and it's his perfect will and they not wait upon the Lord we'll get an answer why because in my distress I don't have it anymore to Samuel 22 in my distress I call upon the name of the Lord and cried to my god and neaten he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears and I could go even further saying that sometime you're calling upon and then there's no signal you're in a dead zone a dead zone we hate it but with Jesus there's nowhere you can go with have a dead zone you see on this highway big banner of the rise in greatest coverage sprint greatest cover everybody says they have the greatest coverage but nobody has even the shadow of the coverage of our Lord Jesus Christ every time you look in your soul you have five bars they want to implant five g's he has far better than that it's the fast as it can get it never been slow hallelujah that's our guy you know they need that I saw I have a father
