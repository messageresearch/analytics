[36:03] lord divine revelation just come lord i

[36:21] lord and to every need we pray tonight
[36:24] lord we love you and we thank you now in
[36:27] the name of jesus christ amen
[36:31] what's in ephesians 5 verse 21
[36:35] i want to just just read from there and
[36:38] just using this we've been coming from
[36:40] here and i just want to start here and
[36:42] just bring this as a background
[36:44] in verse 21 it says submitting
[36:46] yourselves one to another
[36:48] in the fear
[36:50] of god
[36:52] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[36:55] husbands as unto the lord for the
[36:57] husband is the head of the wife even as
[36:59] christ is the head of the church
[37:02] and he's the savior of the body
[37:04] therefore as the church is subject unto
[37:06] christ so let the wives be to their own
[37:09] husbands in everything
[37:11] husbands love your wives even as christ
[37:14] also loved the church and gave himself
[37:17] for it
[37:18] that he might sanctify
[37:20] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[37:24] by the word
[37:25] that he might present it to himself a
[37:28] glorious church
[37:30] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[37:33] thing
[37:34] but that it should be holy and without
[37:36] blemish
[37:38] so ought men to love their wives as
[37:41] their own bodies
[37:42] he that loveth his wife
[37:44] loveth himself
[37:46] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[37:49] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[37:52] the lord the church for we are members
[37:55] of his body of his flesh and of his
[37:58] bones
[37:59] for this cause shall a man leave his
[38:01] father and mother and shall be joined
[38:04] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[38:06] flesh
[38:08] this is a great mystery but i speak
[38:10] concerning christ and the church
[38:13] nevertheless let every one of you in
[38:15] particular so love his wife even as
[38:18] himself and the wife see
[38:20] that she reverence her husband amen may
[38:23] god bless you and bless the reading of
[38:25] the word as you're being seated
[38:27] i just want to
[38:29] just continue to
[38:31] speak on that that thought here
[38:34] on honor in the home and we've been
[38:36] pulling from this in first corinthians
[38:39] 13
[38:40] from the love of god
[38:42] and a lot of things that
[38:45] can be had
[38:46] as brother branham would would put it he
[38:48] says we have a lot of things he says we
[38:51] have a lot of theology we have a lot of
[38:53] there's a lot of other uh evidences and
[38:56] different things he said but the main
[38:58] the main evidence that we we
[39:02] rest and we can look at is the love of
[39:04] god and remember the love of god
[39:07] it's not a feeling
[39:09] but the love of god is god himself
[39:12] it's the holy ghost this is where paul
[39:15] would write of it that the the love of
[39:17] god
[39:18] is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[39:20] ghost
[39:21] john would write that if you any man
[39:24] love the world or the things of the
[39:26] world the love of the father is not in
[39:28] him
[39:29] and john would go on to write god is
[39:31] love so it's this is a love
[39:33] we're not born with this
[39:36] we're born here in this earth and we we
[39:39] learn as we come into that of a filial
[39:41] love and that's that's where that we are
[39:44] able to climb to there are the fostering
[39:46] and everything that takes place with
[39:49] between a husband and wife and children
[39:51] and so forth and we we learn those
[39:54] things and you know i just say it you
[39:57] know within this manner there are things
[40:00] that you know you take for example
[40:03] whether it's
[40:04] ducks or or whatever type of the animal
[40:07] and you know it's things that within it
[40:10] remember brother brown said science
[40:12] would call it instinct such as that duck
[40:14] will take out for the water nobody has
[40:17] to teach it or train it to go in that
[40:19] way
[40:20] it just takes out for him brother braham
[40:21] says science calls it instincts he said
[40:23] i call it god
[40:25] and so when we recognize even to how you
[40:28] know the geese or different ones will
[40:29] start moving together to fly south for
[40:32] the winter and so there are things that
[40:35] within that that when now we look at us
[40:38] and in our lives there are things that
[40:40] we that god has placed within us
[40:44] attributes
[40:45] that we don't uh come into or uh i guess
[40:49] say uh go out and bring these attributes
[40:52] into our life such as husband and wife
[40:54] and father and mother they are already
[40:57] packed within our lives
[40:59] it's just like whatever in reality what
[41:02] what god has for you as a young person
[41:04] what god has for you to do that's
[41:06] already packed in your life
[41:08] it's like a suitcase but it must be
[41:10] unpacked
[41:12] but there's one to unpack it and that's
[41:14] the one who packed it
[41:16] so we let god unpack what he has packed
[41:18] within our life and it's not the the
[41:21] things like brother bam talked about all
[41:23] the mud and the muck that's part of the
[41:24] first birth but we're talking about what
[41:27] god packed within that part of the seed
[41:30] that was buried beneath that of the dirt
[41:33] when the spirit of god moves upon that
[41:35] seed and the quickening power of god has
[41:37] come the experience of passing from
[41:40] death unto life it begins to unpack a
[41:42] son and daughter of god and then
[41:44] everything else that is there it begins
[41:47] to unpack itself as as we are in the
[41:50] presence of almighty god and so when we
[41:54] when we are are looking at at these
[41:56] things with that of the love of god we
[42:00] we recognize that the love of god as
[42:03] paul would write of it
[42:05] it is it is the most it's one of the
[42:08] most important things in our life is the
[42:10] holy ghost
[42:12] there is nothing more important brother
[42:14] brahman says with all the purposes in
[42:15] life if we miss that purpose we've
[42:18] missed everything
[42:20] it's and that is the number one main
[42:23] purpose in our life is to be united with
[42:26] jesus christ not just to know the
[42:29] message not just to know a church not
[42:31] just to know god sent a prophet but the
[42:34] objective in life is to be united with
[42:38] jesus christ in the power of his
[42:40] resurrection because when that is taking
[42:43] place i tell you you're talking about
[42:45] arrest it doesn't matter what comes your
[42:47] way it doesn't even matter the things
[42:50] that are out there you can rest in the
[42:52] lord to know that god has everything
[42:55] under his control
[42:57] and those are things you know think of
[42:59] how paul when paul could step away when
[43:01] he was on his way you know there even to
[43:05] jerusalem and paul on his way and he
[43:07] would call you know the elders and he
[43:09] would speak to them and let them know
[43:11] that you know this is my time of
[43:13] departure is nigh here and you know he
[43:15] lets him know there's going to be
[43:16] grievous wolves and men's going to arise
[43:19] from among you speaking perverse things
[43:21] to think of this that in one way you or
[43:24] i would look at that and say well let's
[43:26] shelter that off but paul had such
[43:28] confidence in the revelation and the
[43:33] sovereignty of god that a child of god
[43:37] cannot be deceived because god has given
[43:42] his word for what we have need of in
[43:45] this generation let me just tell you
[43:47] this that no matter what the enemy as he
[43:50] could try to raise his head up god's
[43:53] already got it covered
[43:56] god has sent his word in this generation
[44:00] remember brother ram says when the enemy
[44:02] comes in like a flood that the spirit of
[44:04] god raises a standard against the enemy
[44:07] and he does it by making that word more
[44:10] real and more sure how could you make it
[44:12] more real and more sure is when you meet
[44:15] the god of the word and now that word is
[44:19] now living on the inside of you by the
[44:22] power of the holy ghost that's the
[44:24] standard that backs the enemy down
[44:27] and that is the love of god as it moves
[44:30] within our life and you know
[44:32] love itself brother brown would write it
[44:34] would express it in this way love makes
[44:37] you do things i want you to think of
[44:40] that i'm not going to read these quotes
[44:42] but it's just the statements that
[44:43] brother brown makes love makes you he
[44:46] says in desperation because love itself
[44:49] he said we'll drive your faith out onto
[44:52] the battlefront it shows and you know
[44:54] very well just as i do there are times
[44:57] when the other realms are in opposition
[45:00] to that of the love of god there's
[45:02] things that can try to come into your
[45:04] spirit realm there's even thoughts even
[45:07] thoughts of disdain we can go on and on
[45:09] but this is one thing for sure when the
[45:12] love of god is there nothing can
[45:14] overthrow or get past the love of god
[45:19] he said brother samuel what are you
[45:20] saying i'm saying that there is nothing
[45:24] that can go on if it's wrong where the
[45:27] love of god won't bring you back to the
[45:29] word of god and bring about a repentance
[45:32] in your life and say i'm wrong that's
[45:34] what the love of god does
[45:37] it's active so love it makes you do
[45:40] things now you understand what i'm
[45:42] saying in that i'm not talking about
[45:43] living a life of sin i'm talking about
[45:45] things that even at times in our spirit
[45:48] that can get a little uh uh
[45:50] out of line or our thoughts or our
[45:53] feelings sometimes or we can be hurt we
[45:55] can be offended i'm preaching to humans
[45:57] tonight right well those things can
[45:59] happen like that and maybe not even
[46:01] intentional but thanks be to god
[46:04] for the love of god on the inside it has
[46:07] within it a cleansing power that is able
[46:11] to release the hurt and all that is
[46:15] within it and place it there in the
[46:17] hands of god through the blood of jesus
[46:19] christ thank god for the love of god
[46:22] there's nothing so great as the love of
[46:25] god
[46:27] oh my i wish i had more time just to
[46:29] speak on it maybe we'll take more
[46:30] thursdays on it
[46:33] but let's look here in ephesians five
[46:35] and i want to just i want to deal with
[46:37] this here tonight just to some things as
[46:40] we're looking at ephesians 5 and you
[46:42] know
[46:43] remember when we're looking at this and
[46:45] paul would write it
[46:48] paul is under this inspiration what an
[46:51] example that he has set before the
[46:53] church of the living god
[46:54] of how that a home should operate and i
[46:57] i want you to just to catch this here
[46:59] for a moment you know let me just let me
[47:01] just kind of give this and not not in a
[47:03] way as a disclaimer but just to put it
[47:05] out there i realize that in every sense
[47:07] sometimes you know i'm speaking to older
[47:09] speaking to all sorts and all ages we
[47:12] all can grow but i also realize there's
[47:14] young ones coming on and these things
[47:16] are just don't come by osmosis
[47:19] and paul was very very particular to
[47:21] tell titus speak these things teach
[47:24] these things tell timothy now as i said
[47:27] before this is part of pastoral work
[47:31] i love it
[47:33] amen
[47:34] see in ephesians 5 when paul would write
[47:37] of this under inspiration what an
[47:39] example that he's taking from is that of
[47:43] the lord jesus and his and his bride the
[47:46] church because remember it's his life
[47:50] that his life his love that is projected
[47:53] into the church that he sees reflected
[47:57] back to himself in other words the bride
[48:00] of jesus christ is the bride of jesus
[48:03] christ because not just because we were
[48:06] for ordained before the foundation of
[48:08] the world but because his spirit the
[48:12] holy ghost has come and brought us to
[48:15] him and raised up that seed on the
[48:18] inside that declares itself in our life
[48:22] to be a part of the bride of jesus
[48:25] christ how do we know because our lives
[48:28] and our hearts are submissive to the
[48:30] word of god when the word said turn here
[48:33] we turn there and our lives our
[48:36] testimony reflects jesus christ in all
[48:40] that we do and all that we say
[48:42] and so when we're looking at this great
[48:45] love story this great romance i want you
[48:48] if you would turn in the bible here go
[48:50] back to psalms 22 with me and i'm going
[48:53] to just deal with here tonight a little
[48:55] bit if god will give me just grace and i
[48:58] want to really deal with psalms 23 in
[49:00] the home psalms 23 in the home and look
[49:03] at psalms
[49:04] 22 and 24.
[49:07] now in looking at psalms 22
[49:10] 23 and 24 these are all messianic psalms
[49:15] they all speak of the work
[49:18] of redemption
[49:20] by god coming down and taking upon flesh
[49:24] in chapter 22 without me reading it here
[49:26] tonight
[49:28] it discloses the suffering of the lord
[49:31] jesus in other words
[49:33] life had to be surrendered laying down
[49:36] his life
[49:39] so he found a woman
[49:41] who was worth dying for
[49:44] are you with me he found one that he was
[49:46] worth dying for you see this is where
[49:49] when we look at john 3 16 remember it's
[49:52] the same way when boaz purchased there
[49:55] all of naomi's estate but he did so to
[49:58] get ruth
[50:01] are you hearing me he did it to get ruth
[50:03] and so within this here you find that
[50:06] then in psalms 22 the suffering and of
[50:09] the giving of life and what i want to
[50:11] say is it's a releasing and a laying
[50:13] down of life how could you and i enter
[50:16] in to his life how could we enter into
[50:19] the holy ghost how could we do that
[50:22] except god become flesh and he lay his
[50:26] life down and pave the way so that we
[50:30] could be united with him under the blood
[50:34] by the holy ghost you see it took god
[50:38] coming down and laying down his life
[50:43] oh glory be to god
[50:45] so then notice if you look in the
[50:48] scriptures you have your bible open i
[50:49] don't have this there on the slides but
[50:51] if you have your bible open then you
[50:53] notice in verse 22 of psalms 22 i will
[50:56] declare thy name
[50:58] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[51:00] congregation well i praise thee that's
[51:03] that's him walking in the midst of the
[51:05] seven golden candlesticks that's him
[51:07] proclaiming
[51:08] that name the victory the character the
[51:12] life he is now now he's give his life
[51:16] now he's raised in life to release that
[51:19] life back to you and i
[51:23] to declare his name
[51:25] when when that of a woman and a man
[51:27] comes together what is she doing she's
[51:29] taking on
[51:31] his name
[51:33] is that right
[51:34] so now
[51:35] where there was a separation
[51:38] there in eden now through christ we are
[51:41] still restored back to the original
[51:45] headship of the word
[51:47] is that right
[51:49] now let's look at this here in psalms 23
[51:52] and i'm just going to just deal with
[51:54] this a little verse by verse
[51:57] and i want you to notice here in psalms
[51:59] 23 verse 1
[52:00] the lord
[52:02] is my shepherd i shall not want
[52:07] so here in psalms 22 there's a life
[52:11] that's given psalms 23 leads into the
[52:14] caring
[52:15] for what has been purchased and brought
[52:17] to himself
[52:20] which then from the caring
[52:22] in psalms 24
[52:25] leads to the positioning
[52:28] open up you everlasting gates open up
[52:31] who is the see you can't get that
[52:33] position
[52:34] without all of this the giving
[52:37] and the caring
[52:38] it leads into that third part to reign
[52:41] as king of glory that's the same way
[52:43] that it is even within a marriage
[52:47] it's giving
[52:49] caring
[52:50] and that in itself gives position
[52:53] are you with me
[52:55] oh glory be to god so you see when we
[52:58] look at this in psalms 23 1 the lord is
[53:02] my shepherd that's pretty personal
[53:04] he's my
[53:06] shepherd
[53:08] i shall not want completely satisfied
[53:12] i don't have eyes for no other i'm
[53:14] satisfied
[53:16] the lord is my shepherd i'm content
[53:20] he's my i shall not want because he's my
[53:24] shepherd
[53:25] notice i want you to notice as a
[53:27] shepherd a shepherd will seek out
[53:30] in lives and seek out the right pasture
[53:33] shepherd is not one that's just
[53:34] haphazard of going around it's seeking
[53:37] out the right places the right to to to
[53:40] go to move into and the sheep in the
[53:42] right seasons and so forth as well as
[53:45] what it is that even we're able to
[53:47] handle at a certain time
[53:50] how many know that's true
[53:52] god knows what we're able to handle you
[53:54] know brother branham even wrote brother
[53:55] brown would speak of that in the um the
[53:57] sumerian church age and he would write
[54:00] about those those 10 days and how that
[54:02] that would speak of 10 years you know
[54:04] with dicletion and the emperor and the
[54:06] martyr that would take place brother
[54:08] brahman says god wrote that in there but
[54:11] he did not want to scare the church of
[54:14] the living god
[54:15] and see god would write and see god is
[54:18] so attentive to our needs and to our
[54:20] care he knows what to release just as we
[54:24] have need of it my my my
[54:26] oh my he doesn't god doesn't want to
[54:28] upset the church
[54:30] think of brother branham let me just
[54:32] talk just as he's
[54:33] leading brother brown would tell us in
[54:35] christ the mystery he would give us a
[54:36] little a little view into it and he
[54:39] would speak about the gift and how that
[54:42] the gift and it was more than a gift it
[54:44] was a prophet because it wasn't a gift
[54:46] it was a prophet and that that operation
[54:49] of there of the son of man in a son of
[54:52] man remember what a stewardship that was
[54:55] held in that time to where brother
[54:57] branham himself could say if certain
[54:59] things were disclosed it would get out
[55:02] amongst the people it could cause
[55:04] penitentiary offenses
[55:06] i mean to think if this one's connecting
[55:08] with this one oh boy i tell you what you
[55:10] need more than beacons you need billy
[55:12] clubs on them and holding their thing
[55:13] you see god knows
[55:16] god knows what what is able to be held
[55:18] you see god's desire
[55:20] within it he knows what you and i have
[55:23] need of and what we can handle this is
[55:25] where john john 16 12. let's listen here
[55:29] to the shepherd as he speaks i have yet
[55:31] many things to say unto you but you
[55:34] cannot bear them now
[55:38] he knows he's mindful of if i speak this
[55:41] right now you're not going to receive it
[55:43] you're not going to get it and it's not
[55:45] going to do any good it might trouble
[55:46] you
[55:48] god's not interested in the word
[55:50] troubling us he's interested in the word
[55:53] guiding us leading us bringing us to
[55:56] victory
[55:58] he's very attentive but you cannot bear
[56:00] them now how be it when he
[56:03] the spirit of truth is come
[56:06] he will guide you into all truth
[56:09] this is the evidence of the holy ghost
[56:13] not speaking in tongues not prophesying
[56:16] not praying for the sick and they're
[56:17] healed not preaching not understanding
[56:19] mysteries this is the evidence of the
[56:22] holy ghost because the love of god it is
[56:25] in love with god it is the spirit of
[56:28] truth that leads us into the word this
[56:30] is why a person can live a good clean
[56:33] moral life and still not have the spirit
[56:36] of truth what does the spirit of truth
[56:39] do the new birth it brings a hunger and
[56:42] a thirst and a desire for the word of
[56:45] god and the things of almighty god
[56:48] that's what the spirit of truth does it
[56:51] leads us into all truth he that hath an
[56:54] ear
[56:55] let him hear
[56:56] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[57:00] is that right
[57:01] now when we look at this the lord is my
[57:03] shepherd i shall not want how many of
[57:04] you had questions still got questions
[57:06] right
[57:07] sometimes we come into things in our
[57:09] life we pray for things and it doesn't
[57:11] it doesn't come about we got questions
[57:13] god is not bothered about questions
[57:16] even when someone passes on and we say
[57:18] what i don't know why
[57:20] why
[57:22] god isn't bothered that's not unbelief
[57:25] oh brother samuel you shouldn't mourn
[57:27] you need to know your bible the bible
[57:29] says we do mourn but we don't mourn as
[57:32] others
[57:33] come on now
[57:34] don't try to take those things away keep
[57:36] yourself balanced in the word we do
[57:39] mourn but we don't mourn as others who
[57:41] have no hope
[57:43] are you with me so now when we come into
[57:46] time there are times we have questions
[57:48] in our life there are times listen we we
[57:51] don't have altogether recorded here in
[57:53] the scriptures i wonder how many times
[57:55] sarah had questions
[57:58] wonder how many times uh brother noah's
[58:00] wife had questions are you hearing me
[58:04] wonder how many times each of them they
[58:06] had questions god's not bothered with
[58:09] questions
[58:11] but he did make a way
[58:13] god did make a way that questions can be
[58:16] addressed and this is where paul would
[58:18] say in first corinthians 14 and he's
[58:21] remember paul he's dealing with let the
[58:23] woman keep silence in the church she's
[58:25] not to speak she's not to preach in the
[58:27] church of the living god she's not to
[58:29] exhort help me now
[58:32] maybe i can bring it on down she's not
[58:34] to be an instagram preacher a facebook
[58:36] pastor hello somebody she's not to be
[58:39] that at all are you with me now
[58:41] now you know he goes on to say if they
[58:44] will learn anything
[58:46] let them ask their husbands at home
[58:49] that's a big responsibility
[58:52] it's a responsibility as a husband to be
[58:55] the spiritual leader of his home
[58:59] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[59:02] brother samuel these are big shoes to
[59:04] fill but if you got the big god on the
[59:06] inside
[59:07] he's more than a match for your shoes
[59:10] no matter if you wear size 7 or size 52
[59:14] he can fill her
[59:16] psalms 32 psalms 23 2.
[59:19] the next scripture he maketh me
[59:22] to lie down
[59:24] in green pastures
[59:27] not barren places
[59:30] notice he maketh me this is not a demand
[59:34] his presence
[59:36] as he brings me into this place he
[59:38] maketh me to lie down in green pastures
[59:42] he leadeth me beside the still water
[59:44] this speaks of a calming
[59:49] and the lord knows we need calming
[59:53] there's times we need calming in our
[59:55] life and he
[59:56] he leads us
[59:59] into green pastures
[1:00:02] see places where we get nourishment and
[1:00:05] as
[1:00:06] when we look at this even this this
[1:00:08] picture of this we're even talking about
[1:00:10] where the pests
[1:00:12] of the bugs
[1:00:13] and things would
[1:00:15] you ever watch wildlife sometimes i've
[1:00:17] watched deer even in our backyard and
[1:00:18] i've watched them out here when when
[1:00:20] hunting out here and you see them and
[1:00:21] the flies are coming on them and they're
[1:00:23] constantly that tail just flipping and
[1:00:25] flipping you've seen horses right i mean
[1:00:28] the mane on the horse we look at and say
[1:00:30] oh that's a beautiful tail that tail is
[1:00:32] there for getting them flies and
[1:00:34] everything else off
[1:00:37] because them flies are like a pest and
[1:00:39] like a nuisance
[1:00:42] this in this scripture he himself will
[1:00:46] actually has the authority and ability
[1:00:51] to remove even the pests
[1:00:56] [Laughter]
[1:00:58] aren't you glad about that
[1:01:01] whoo he making me to lie down in green
[1:01:03] pastures he leaded me beside the still
[1:01:05] waters questions and answers number
[1:01:07] three in 1964 brother branham i love the
[1:01:10] lord but for the past year i have been
[1:01:13] faced with a problem seeing sometimes
[1:01:15] i'm almost been out of my mind what is
[1:01:17] it please pray for me
[1:01:20] and my husband my brother you know he's
[1:01:22] going in and he says it's signed a
[1:01:24] sister in christ
[1:01:26] i'm just going i'm going to get into
[1:01:27] reading in here in just a moment but
[1:01:28] he's he's just he's looking at it and
[1:01:31] he's saying now if there's something
[1:01:32] you've done wrong just just confess that
[1:01:35] make it right and you know if it's
[1:01:36] something condemning you if it's
[1:01:38] something from way in the past just just
[1:01:39] make it right make it right and go on
[1:01:42] and then he picks up and he says
[1:01:44] he says but if there's nothing you've
[1:01:45] done that can be condemned of it's
[1:01:47] perhaps your nerves
[1:01:49] it could be many things that happened
[1:01:51] maybe some trouble back in your life
[1:01:53] maybe it's a woman here might be in the
[1:01:55] menopause time and i'm just going to
[1:01:57] pause here just for a moment
[1:02:01] there's times at different times that
[1:02:02] i've just witnessed here over
[1:02:05] over the years at times in the holy
[1:02:06] spirit just waking it up and hear it
[1:02:09] maybe i'm in maybe speaking with some
[1:02:11] things or dealing with some things and
[1:02:13] all of a sudden we just drop down wait a
[1:02:15] minute there's some things going there
[1:02:18] this is this is a condition that's going
[1:02:19] on behind the scenes
[1:02:22] and that menopause that's a real
[1:02:23] condition
[1:02:25] now what i'm going to say is this
[1:02:28] sister rebecca branham
[1:02:31] she she did a video
[1:02:33] and it was it was insight into the times
[1:02:37] where brother branham
[1:02:38] was uh speaking with her
[1:02:41] because there were times where sister
[1:02:42] rebecca and when sister media was going
[1:02:44] through this time right here but brother
[1:02:46] branham worked with such wisdom to
[1:02:47] explain the things that was taking place
[1:02:50] and going on
[1:02:51] because
[1:02:52] when brother brown goes into this and if
[1:02:55] and if you'd like to see that it's it's
[1:02:56] it's available we can get you the link
[1:02:58] because i would suggest i would highly
[1:03:00] suggest that if you're into the into
[1:03:02] this time or coming into the time it
[1:03:04] would be good to watch
[1:03:06] because it's very very good on how
[1:03:07] brother branham worked with this this
[1:03:09] was a situation that that home where
[1:03:12] there was a little of a contention here
[1:03:14] seemingly between sister media and
[1:03:16] sister uh rebecca but here the spirit of
[1:03:19] god come down and gave such wisdom
[1:03:21] without taking either side gave such
[1:03:23] wisdom to help her to see what's taking
[1:03:26] place this is really not your mother but
[1:03:28] he didn't tear her down either so that
[1:03:29] sister rebecca still had greatest
[1:03:31] respect for her mother
[1:03:34] it's just powerful
[1:03:36] i tell you you tell me god don't have
[1:03:37] the answer for what we have need of
[1:03:40] he sure does
[1:03:41] so if you'd like to have you can contact
[1:03:43] my wife or myself we'll get you the link
[1:03:45] i would i would just love for you to to
[1:03:48] to see that and it'd be oh brother
[1:03:50] samuel my wife no you might need to see
[1:03:52] it too
[1:03:56] maybe it's a woman here might be in
[1:03:57] menopause time that's when everything is
[1:03:59] wrong with her
[1:04:01] and there's nothing wrong with her yet
[1:04:03] everything's wrong with her and she's
[1:04:05] not just putting on
[1:04:06] she really feels that it's just as real
[1:04:10] any person that's nervous
[1:04:12] is that way oh so now he's also dealing
[1:04:15] with anybody who's nervous is that way
[1:04:18] so we got two conditions menopause we
[1:04:21] have nervousness and even how that those
[1:04:23] things can move together and notice he
[1:04:26] says
[1:04:27] and that and and any person that's
[1:04:28] nervous is that way and don't never
[1:04:31] disagree
[1:04:34] it's okay
[1:04:36] help me jesus
[1:04:39] because
[1:04:40] it's like
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:43] i have to use examples as they come to
[1:04:45] me it's like my you know my
[1:04:47] father-in-law told me you know when he
[1:04:48] was working there as a
[1:04:50] uh
[1:04:51] as an lpn
[1:04:52] you go into the you go into the the room
[1:04:55] of the residence
[1:04:56] here they are uh with dementia and
[1:04:59] alzheimer's
[1:05:00] and they're up
[1:05:02] at three in the morning they're getting
[1:05:03] ready because they're gonna go milk the
[1:05:05] cows
[1:05:06] what should you do you don't tell them
[1:05:08] oh there's no such thing as that you're
[1:05:10] here don't argue with them just help
[1:05:12] them get their clothes on hey yeah we
[1:05:14] got to milk them cows today we got to go
[1:05:16] do that because you know what happens
[1:05:18] when you argue it creates attention and
[1:05:21] they get angry
[1:05:23] are you hearing me now so when we look
[1:05:25] at this don't disagree this is an
[1:05:27] understanding that comes to it and the
[1:05:30] understanding is you won't understand
[1:05:33] but just understand that you don't
[1:05:35] understand
[1:05:36] [Laughter]
[1:05:38] and you husbands to your wife when
[1:05:40] they're in that time of life if she ever
[1:05:43] was your sweetheart you let her be right
[1:05:46] then
[1:05:47] cause she needs you
[1:05:49] she really needs your help she needs
[1:05:52] somebody to help her
[1:05:54] and understand her
[1:05:57] if we can say it like this
[1:05:59] she needs a good ear
[1:06:03] a good ear and an open heart
[1:06:06] is that all right
[1:06:08] and that's not something i would say
[1:06:09] this that's not something to wait until
[1:06:12] until till this time of life
[1:06:15] that's good right now
[1:06:17] talk to her take her up in your arms
[1:06:21] like she was your sweetheart she should
[1:06:23] be
[1:06:23] and understand her because she's going
[1:06:25] through a time that her entire makeup is
[1:06:28] changing and you must be good to her at
[1:06:31] that time
[1:06:34] i want you to look at this in psalms 94
[1:06:36] 19 let me just go through some
[1:06:38] scriptures here
[1:06:40] here as he makes us to lay down
[1:06:43] green pastures beside the still waters
[1:06:45] in the multitude david said in the
[1:06:46] multitude of my thoughts my anxieties
[1:06:50] within me thy comforts delight my soul
[1:06:57] david's not saying oh my that you know
[1:06:59] there's not times of anxious moments but
[1:07:01] he's saying what combats that anxious
[1:07:03] moment thy
[1:07:05] comforts
[1:07:06] delight my soul
[1:07:09] psalms 4 or
[1:07:11] psalms 4 philippians 4 verse 6 be
[1:07:13] careful for nothing that means be
[1:07:16] anxious for nothing
[1:07:17] that's easy to tell somebody hey don't
[1:07:20] be anxious
[1:07:21] don't be anxious like that's going to be
[1:07:23] like the
[1:07:25] you know hey
[1:07:29] don't be anxious
[1:07:30] like all of a sudden because you said it
[1:07:32] somebody's not going to be
[1:07:34] try that on yourself
[1:07:36] come on somebody
[1:07:38] oh you just got to take the word what
[1:07:41] about you taking the word when you go
[1:07:42] through something
[1:07:44] oh come on you're not in any pain what
[1:07:46] about when you're in pain
[1:07:47] [Music]
[1:07:50] well that was free
[1:07:53] be careful for
[1:07:54] nothing be anxious for nothing
[1:08:00] notice
[1:08:01] david i love this scripture psalms 56 3
[1:08:04] what time i am afraid
[1:08:07] i will trust in thee
[1:08:11] david's real
[1:08:13] david was an honest man
[1:08:15] i mean there might be times he tried to
[1:08:17] hide things but when he got in the
[1:08:18] friends of god and there are things that
[1:08:20] came out you're the man david said
[1:08:22] forgive me lord
[1:08:24] amen david was there before god and what
[1:08:27] david is writing there is times that
[1:08:30] fear that we can be afraid there's times
[1:08:32] of uncertainty but what time i am afraid
[1:08:35] i will trust in thee this was a decision
[1:08:39] to be made
[1:08:41] because you know why
[1:08:43] david had
[1:08:44] confidence in one that he could trust in
[1:08:49] taking the focus first peter 5 6 humble
[1:08:54] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[1:08:56] hand of god
[1:08:58] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:09:00] casting all your care
[1:09:02] all your anxieties upon him
[1:09:05] for he
[1:09:06] careth
[1:09:08] for you
[1:09:10] look at this in psalms 63 7
[1:09:13] because thou has been
[1:09:15] my
[1:09:16] help
[1:09:17] therefore in the shadow of thy wings
[1:09:20] will i rejoice
[1:09:22] did you catch that
[1:09:23] because that has been my help in every
[1:09:26] every other time you have been my help
[1:09:29] massacre the one who has come to my aid
[1:09:32] so now david says therefore in the
[1:09:34] shadow the protection of thy wings will
[1:09:37] i rejoice david do you mean there's no
[1:09:40] more tests there's no more trials do you
[1:09:42] mean there's no more times that you
[1:09:44] won't feel afraid no that's not what i'm
[1:09:46] saying at all what i'm saying is because
[1:09:48] thou hast been my help before
[1:09:51] that when things arise i am going to
[1:09:54] rejoice under your wings because you'll
[1:09:57] lead me to green pastures
[1:10:00] you cause me to lay down beside the
[1:10:02] still waters
[1:10:05] oh glory be to god my soul followeth
[1:10:08] hard after thee
[1:10:11] thy right hand upholdeth me
[1:10:15] psalm or philippians 3 verse 10
[1:10:19] paul would write that i may know him in
[1:10:21] the power of his resurrection and the
[1:10:24] fellowship
[1:10:25] of his sufferings
[1:10:27] it's like the vows that are said
[1:10:32] sickness sorrow
[1:10:36] things are good
[1:10:38] tough times and on and on all that comes
[1:10:40] in
[1:10:42] it's a it's it's a vow
[1:10:44] a word
[1:10:46] it's what what our lives
[1:10:49] have come into right here
[1:10:51] when that covenant is being entered into
[1:10:53] and notice the fellowship of his
[1:10:55] sufferings you know the things that
[1:10:57] you go through
[1:10:58] even when it comes to of a church
[1:11:01] comes to a marriage
[1:11:03] the things you go through
[1:11:06] if you allow god it'll make you stronger
[1:11:11] you don't come out weaker job said i
[1:11:13] know
[1:11:14] when i shall come forth from all of this
[1:11:17] i'll come forth as pure as gold
[1:11:21] that's what job said entering into it
[1:11:23] is that right
[1:11:25] i mean we're not taking in all the the
[1:11:27] account of down through time where job
[1:11:29] starts looking at himself and trying to
[1:11:30] start justifying himself
[1:11:32] but in the beginning joe knew
[1:11:35] when i get when i come out of this i'm
[1:11:37] going to come forth pure is gold
[1:11:40] he's recognizing there's one who's over
[1:11:42] this there's one who's watching over and
[1:11:45] there's a fellowship of his sufferings
[1:11:48] there's a time even you know sometimes
[1:11:50] we look at things and say god why am i
[1:11:52] going through this or lord this you know
[1:11:54] maybe there's things you prayed about
[1:11:56] you've been praying about and things
[1:11:58] you're waiting on and the doctor report
[1:12:00] you still got the same doctor report
[1:12:02] same doctor report and then the enemy
[1:12:05] let's just jump on his case a little bit
[1:12:07] then the enemy wants to come along and
[1:12:09] say well if you had faith that booger
[1:12:11] knows the quotes
[1:12:14] all right but let me just put it to you
[1:12:16] like this faith itself isn't always that
[1:12:19] it brings the promise to pass right then
[1:12:23] neither is faith itself oh that that is
[1:12:26] what's exhibited then after a period of
[1:12:28] time the promise comes to pass faith is
[1:12:31] being exhibited that no matter what
[1:12:33] takes place
[1:12:35] god is
[1:12:38] and what he said he is just and faithful
[1:12:41] in all his actions
[1:12:44] it's easy to have faith and say whoa
[1:12:47] glory to god when prayers are being
[1:12:49] answered
[1:12:50] are you hearing me
[1:12:52] and i don't want to just say easy to
[1:12:54] have faith but what about it when it
[1:12:56] comes down to times when prayers
[1:12:58] themselves are things that you're
[1:12:59] praying about and it seems like that
[1:13:01] there's no answer coming that's a time
[1:13:04] that really requires faith as well just
[1:13:08] as much faith as miracle working faith
[1:13:14] don't have time to go into examples on
[1:13:16] that but
[1:13:17] let me just say it like this
[1:13:20] because we
[1:13:21] i mean i'm challenged by this
[1:13:24] i'm challenged by this
[1:13:27] leadership
[1:13:29] leadership itself
[1:13:31] it isn't always having
[1:13:33] the answers
[1:13:36] brother brahma just said it very cleanly
[1:13:38] he said if you talk to a man he's got
[1:13:39] all the answers you better get away from
[1:13:40] him
[1:13:42] simple as that
[1:13:44] you got everybody they know they get
[1:13:45] away from them because that's wrong
[1:13:49] is that right
[1:13:50] i mean we can go on and on through the
[1:13:52] scripture leadership isn't always having
[1:13:55] the answers but it's having confidence
[1:13:58] in the living god who's guiding you
[1:14:01] and he is the answer
[1:14:05] he don't just have an answer he is the
[1:14:07] answer
[1:14:09] and he'll operate through his ordained
[1:14:11] channel
[1:14:12] to provide leadership it's like when as
[1:14:15] paul would write but i would have you to
[1:14:16] know that
[1:14:17] that the head of every man is christ the
[1:14:19] head of the woman is the man the head of
[1:14:20] christ is god
[1:14:22] leadership
[1:14:24] leadership
[1:14:25] is to seek him
[1:14:28] and recognize his leading if you're
[1:14:30] seeking after his will
[1:14:33] the greatest thing you can do is say god
[1:14:35] let my heart my spirit let everything be
[1:14:39] neutral
[1:14:40] just tell me to be sensitive just help
[1:14:42] me to be sensitive
[1:14:44] because let me just say this how many
[1:14:46] times are there's things right that we
[1:14:48] have need of in our life there's not a
[1:14:49] scripture wrote out
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:53] oh thou thou shalt take a trip to
[1:14:56] phoenix there this i wrote out in the
[1:14:57] scripture
[1:14:59] right there's things that you're that
[1:15:01] you can be asked to do and you're like
[1:15:02] lord lord i i need a word
[1:15:06] sometimes it isn't a word as far as that
[1:15:09] there's road out here but what you have
[1:15:11] need of is the word himself
[1:15:14] to come down
[1:15:16] and really bring a real peace within
[1:15:18] your heart and for that situation
[1:15:22] he leadeth me beside the still waters
[1:15:27] it leadership is to seek him recognize
[1:15:30] his leading and yield to it
[1:15:34] let me try to
[1:15:36] let's try to pick up verse 3 here in
[1:15:38] psalms 23. we may not get through all
[1:15:40] this here tonight
[1:15:42] psalms 23 3 he restoreth my soul
[1:15:51] indeed
[1:15:52] he restores
[1:15:54] our soul
[1:15:56] by that of the new birth
[1:15:58] but even
[1:16:00] in times
[1:16:01] and situations that transpire in our
[1:16:04] life like job
[1:16:09] job got to a place
[1:16:12] brother brahm said the messengers of
[1:16:15] satan were coming to him to try to get
[1:16:17] him to doubt his message
[1:16:20] trying to get him to doubt it
[1:16:23] because job job being a prophet knew
[1:16:26] knew there's an answer
[1:16:29] he knew that but he didn't know what the
[1:16:31] answer was
[1:16:33] job was being affected
[1:16:35] it wasn't just the trial itself as it
[1:16:37] goes on it's affecting you know what
[1:16:39] that trial did when you really can look
[1:16:41] at job it is a situation that brings to
[1:16:45] light and view the fragileness of
[1:16:48] humanity
[1:16:51] when god said there's a man who's
[1:16:52] perfect and upright he wasn't talking
[1:16:55] about the flesh of job he was talking
[1:16:57] about that job which was one of the sons
[1:17:02] that shouted for joy before the
[1:17:04] foundation of the world because this
[1:17:07] flesh and our spirit it can crumble
[1:17:10] sometimes under the midst of situations
[1:17:13] and trials that come our way
[1:17:18] there's an anchor on the inside that
[1:17:20] holds us
[1:17:22] and he restoreth
[1:17:24] my soul
[1:17:28] samuel these are big words for husbands
[1:17:30] and but remember you got a big god
[1:17:35] there's a big god not out here but that
[1:17:38] that great big god would make himself so
[1:17:41] small
[1:17:42] that he would come and dwell
[1:17:44] in that part of his word that channel
[1:17:46] that he reserved for himself in this
[1:17:48] hour in your life
[1:17:50] think of this he restoreth my soul
[1:17:52] second corinthians
[1:17:54] chapter one verse three
[1:17:57] oh hallelujah
[1:17:59] look how paul would write this
[1:18:02] blessed be god even the father of our
[1:18:04] lord jesus christ the father of mercies
[1:18:06] and the god of all comfort
[1:18:12] there's sometimes there's a lot of
[1:18:14] words or things that can be portrayed as
[1:18:16] comfort
[1:18:18] that's not comfort
[1:18:22] it's not comfort at all
[1:18:24] because it really doesn't minister to
[1:18:26] the situation
[1:18:29] but the god of all comforts so we're
[1:18:31] talking about a comfort that's higher
[1:18:33] than that of just human compassion
[1:18:36] yet we need human compassion are you
[1:18:39] hearing me now
[1:18:40] paul wrote in romans in first in first
[1:18:43] timothy there that this is the hour in
[1:18:45] this time where men are lovers of
[1:18:48] themselves truth breakers and without
[1:18:51] natural
[1:18:52] affection in other words let me put it
[1:18:55] in layman's terms instead of ducks going
[1:18:58] naturally instinctively by god to water
[1:19:01] they don't know where to go
[1:19:03] sometimes it's examples listen you don't
[1:19:05] learn to love by osmosis
[1:19:09] it's the examples that's put even in
[1:19:11] front of us and before us are you
[1:19:13] hearing me now remember in the random
[1:19:15] when he saw the pentecostals you hear
[1:19:16] brother ramble talk about this in a
[1:19:18] message bill graham didn't know what to
[1:19:20] think of how they were hugging one
[1:19:21] another and shaking one another and said
[1:19:23] god bless your brother so good he ain't
[1:19:26] never he had never seen anything like
[1:19:27] that before are you hearing me but he
[1:19:30] learned it brother brown had never even
[1:19:31] seen expressive worship remember they
[1:19:34] were dancing right out there on the
[1:19:36] floor and remember brother branham was
[1:19:38] sat and he said here i was in the seat
[1:19:40] of the scornful but then though god
[1:19:43] began to deal with his heart upon that
[1:19:46] of the word he started patting his foot
[1:19:48] oh my he was right out in the aisle
[1:19:51] dancing with those sisters
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:55] come on now
[1:19:57] you see when we look at it there's
[1:19:59] things that we
[1:20:01] we have to learn
[1:20:02] and i want to continue to learn and grow
[1:20:07] you know i thank god for the example i
[1:20:09] really do of of my of my father and of
[1:20:12] my mother i thank god for that i i'm
[1:20:14] grateful for a godly example but i don't
[1:20:16] limit it to the example that i've seen
[1:20:19] are you hearing me and because why
[1:20:21] that's limiting god
[1:20:24] there are things that it could go higher
[1:20:26] it can go higher it can go higher it can
[1:20:28] go deeper
[1:20:30] let me finish this
[1:20:32] second corinthians 1 verse 4 who
[1:20:34] comforted us he's the god of all comfort
[1:20:36] who does what comforteth us
[1:20:39] in all our
[1:20:41] tribulation
[1:20:44] so he's very attentive to what's going
[1:20:46] on
[1:20:48] he doesn't remove the tribulation
[1:20:52] but he's there to comfort us through
[1:20:58] that we notice that we may be able to
[1:21:01] comfort
[1:21:02] them
[1:21:03] which are in any trouble
[1:21:06] oh
[1:21:07] so experience
[1:21:09] through the fellowship of sufferings
[1:21:13] it builds within our life
[1:21:15] to be even more sensitive
[1:21:18] to these needs
[1:21:22] i've never let me just say this here let
[1:21:24] me pause here for a moment
[1:21:29] you know when my wife has had i think it
[1:21:31] was from when we were
[1:21:33] honey was it like a year right after we
[1:21:34] were married or within that year you had
[1:21:36] a
[1:21:37] kidney stone attack or whatever more
[1:21:40] never experienced anything she had never
[1:21:41] experienced anything like that
[1:21:43] and um
[1:21:47] i i mean you're you're just looking at
[1:21:49] it here i am praying
[1:21:51] satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus
[1:21:53] christ
[1:21:55] you know right and i'm not saying that
[1:21:57] losing i'm just saying i here i am i'm
[1:21:59] praying and i'm praying
[1:22:02] many times we had to go to the hospital
[1:22:04] oh brother samuel was that a weakness of
[1:22:06] faith no that was the pathway that god
[1:22:08] wanted
[1:22:10] sometimes god has to humble us down a
[1:22:12] little bit
[1:22:14] tap us down
[1:22:16] but you know
[1:22:18] i i couldn't understand you know that
[1:22:20] pain by god's grace i had some pain when
[1:22:22] i played football but thanks be to god i
[1:22:24] never had any serious injury i thank god
[1:22:26] for that
[1:22:27] i think some things i deal with today
[1:22:28] from that but i never had anything then
[1:22:32] i couldn't really relate to that
[1:22:34] i didn't look down and tell oh get up
[1:22:36] come on
[1:22:39] but it was a lot of things that then
[1:22:42] as i had to take i had to take her word
[1:22:44] for it and looking at i could see she
[1:22:46] was in pain
[1:22:48] you know
[1:22:49] not just been that but then
[1:22:51] when there had to be some times that
[1:22:52] came along my way with my back
[1:22:55] oh
[1:22:56] times when i'm walking through the
[1:22:57] school and i'm like this i get out of
[1:22:59] the car and i'm like this walking the
[1:23:00] whole day
[1:23:02] i can't even stand up straight and you
[1:23:03] got parent-teacher comments don't sit
[1:23:05] down because you set down the spasms
[1:23:06] just stand up wait for the next person
[1:23:08] to come in even when you teach the whole
[1:23:09] day but you what you say what are you
[1:23:11] saying brother saint that in through
[1:23:13] that
[1:23:14] god's comfort through that experience
[1:23:17] it allowed me
[1:23:19] to have a deeper understand not just for
[1:23:21] her but for others as well
[1:23:24] you see something's got to let you go
[1:23:26] through things sometimes
[1:23:28] and what he allows you to go through is
[1:23:29] not just about you
[1:23:32] but it's also that we might have a
[1:23:34] greater
[1:23:35] feeling
[1:23:36] one
[1:23:37] for another right
[1:23:40] let me close this here
[1:23:43] this is not gonna be sunday where i keep
[1:23:44] saying you know
[1:23:48] that we might be able to comfort them
[1:23:50] which are in any trouble
[1:23:52] by
[1:23:53] the comfort wherewith we ourselves
[1:23:57] are comforted
[1:23:58] of god
[1:24:00] i love this this quote let me read it
[1:24:03] this is brother neville praying brother
[1:24:05] branham's asked by the neville to pray
[1:24:07] and here's brother here's brother
[1:24:08] neville's words
[1:24:09] father
[1:24:10] the great problems and the trials of
[1:24:13] tomorrow will seem as nothing as we're
[1:24:16] able to hold thy hand and walk through
[1:24:18] with thee
[1:24:19] brother brahman said truly lord
[1:24:21] but the devil says we pray lord that
[1:24:23] thou would give us a deep seated
[1:24:25] compassion
[1:24:26] one for the other knowing that while one
[1:24:30] is in the deepness of trial
[1:24:32] and the hardness of testing that we too
[1:24:34] one of these days shall go through like
[1:24:36] circumstances
[1:24:38] god give us the spirit of jesus in us
[1:24:42] till we feel
[1:24:43] for each other
[1:24:44] enough
[1:24:46] until there will be unity
[1:24:48] between us
[1:24:49] until we can serve thee
[1:24:52] together
[1:24:58] restoreth
[1:25:00] my soul
[1:25:04] you know
[1:25:05] we write and i just close here
[1:25:08] you find it in the scripture and i i
[1:25:10] don't i'm not going to take any more
[1:25:12] time with it but you find in the
[1:25:13] scripture
[1:25:16] of the refreshing and how that paul
[1:25:18] would write
[1:25:20] of of the refreshing
[1:25:23] that they would receive
[1:25:24] in the midst of tests
[1:25:26] and of the midst of trial
[1:25:29] we know what refreshing is
[1:25:32] refreshing it's just as what it says
[1:25:33] it's like a
[1:25:36] it's just
[1:25:38] it's refreshing it's when you're beside
[1:25:40] the still waters you're it's a
[1:25:42] refreshing there's a it just has a way
[1:25:44] of bringing a cleansing and a you know
[1:25:47] it just uh puts a pep in your step and
[1:25:49] yet at the same time it just eases
[1:25:52] all the tension
[1:25:54] and paul would write
[1:25:56] of different ones
[1:25:57] philemon on and on different ones of how
[1:26:00] that the church of the living god was
[1:26:02] refreshed
[1:26:03] by you
[1:26:05] my brother
[1:26:07] god intended that by the refreshing of
[1:26:10] the holy ghost in our life
[1:26:14] that we would be a refreshment
[1:26:16] one to another
[1:26:19] even in our homes even in the assembly
[1:26:22] to be a refreshment
[1:26:25] one to another
[1:26:26] he restoreth my soul
[1:26:29] just like he did job when job had come
[1:26:31] through
[1:26:32] all
[1:26:33] of
[1:26:34] the tests and the trial and how things
[1:26:36] come around at the end the things that
[1:26:38] god lays down for job to do even at the
[1:26:40] end
[1:26:42] as it's all said and done
[1:26:43] it's god who restored his
[1:26:48] soul some through the midst of the
[1:26:51] greatest test and the greatest trial
[1:26:55] that's where
[1:26:56] the vows are proven this is where a
[1:26:58] christian life is really it's it's it's
[1:27:00] one thing a person can live so oh i tell
[1:27:03] you everything's going so good it's
[1:27:04] going so good it's going
[1:27:06] but what about when things themselves
[1:27:08] start going a different way
[1:27:11] that's what really shows
[1:27:13] christianity
[1:27:15] that's what really shows the goods
[1:27:18] are you with me
[1:27:20] i mean
[1:27:21] it's not about it's even in the times
[1:27:23] when we don't i think paul was singing
[1:27:25] about this tonight as he was ad-libbing
[1:27:27] in some of those verses
[1:27:28] even the times when you don't feel like
[1:27:30] it
[1:27:34] but he's still worthy
[1:27:38] even in those times
[1:27:40] he's worthy
[1:27:42] may god help us
[1:27:44] in our homes and our church in our lives
[1:27:48] may god help us
[1:27:50] but then just as we looked at a few
[1:27:51] verses tonight lord willing we'll pick
[1:27:53] it up next thursday here on psalms 23
[1:27:55] but to see
[1:27:56] this psalm
[1:27:58] in the midst of the home because it's a
[1:28:00] song
[1:28:01] of care
[1:28:04] one who has given his life
[1:28:06] now
[1:28:07] his life comes forth
[1:28:09] to minister
[1:28:10] care
[1:28:11] to our lives
[1:28:13] he cares about you even he cares for a
[1:28:16] life that is bound with sin he cares
[1:28:19] he cares enough
[1:28:21] to set you free
[1:28:23] he cares enough
[1:28:25] to bring complete deliverance he cares
[1:28:27] enough
[1:28:28] to bring healing to your life
[1:28:32] he's already done it
[1:28:34] if you just accept the care
[1:28:37] he cares
[1:28:38] do you
[1:28:42] pray
[1:28:43] heavenly father
