we come with all reverence and respect that you will Lord come and anoint us and we would be able to Lord and fit right into the channel that you have for us tonight dear Lord you know in the needs of the people lord I pray that you Lord God will just quick and me Lord to your mind for that Lord I ask for your guidance that you would receive all glory and the people would be helped and strengthened we pray in Jesus name Amen turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 14 and I want to begin reading at verse 25 and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and Peter answered him and said lord if it be thou biddest me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord saved me it immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto Him o thou of little faith wherefore did us now doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased he may be seated I would like to title this tonight wherefore did a stout doubt we when we first came to the Lord and give our hearts and dedicated our lives to him why Satan begin to fight you right then to try to get you to doubt the truth that that experience was real Satan had never led up but why are you still here where the Branham said it's because that you held out and he said if you'll do that same thing than any sickness that you have it will be gone too that you'll not doubt the healing touch and power of God I was thinking of the unique that in the scripture where Philip was was caught up and he came down to where the unique was the eunuch was reading from the scripture Scrolls and Philip asked him understand this what thou readest and he said how can i except some man children and so Philip began to expound to him the scripture and then as this as he began to dismount him descriptors they came across some water and the eunuch said here's some water what hinders what hinders us seen there's water what hindered me to be baptized and Philip said if they'll believe us with all that heart thou madest there was no room for doubt there and the eunuch didn't have any and I think of wondering how much time transpired from when Philip first showed up there to where when the eunuch said here's some water what does hinder me I would say that it wasn't a great expand of time so we see that the eunuch was elected to believe and Meeny let he believed and put off all doubt from him itself and believe with his whole heart and it was baptized Jesus said I'm the resurrection in life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me we in our walk we constantly have to fight down you're not exempt from it just simply because you're the elect of God you're not exempt from this battle simply because your bride you're not exempt from this battle simply because of a position that you might hold the Satan tries to come and bring doubt to each and every one brother Branham says I want to ask you something if by His grace he'll come tonight and do the same thing he did in the Bible times when he was here on earth will you cast all doubts away and no it's the devil trying to get you to doubt it's not your own thinking when thoughts of doubt come into your mind that's not your own thinking that's not coming from your reasoning or logic that may be the devil trying to get you to reason but it's the devil that tries to get you to doubt not your own conscience the message of proving his word brother Ram says if thou be the Son of God see he's always doubted it and he tries to teach others to doubt it he taught Eve to doubt and he taught all them to try to doubt it he's teaching you to try to doubt it and you that sitting right here if you want me to call your names it's been satan's been trying a long time to get you to doubt me now I know that there is times that that Satan would come and tried to get you to doubt whether this is the truth or not but there's something about it when you first heard it that struck so deep within your heart that you can say though he's battled me I've never doubted him after all that God's done for you and your life you see the miles that you've come over the obstacles the road that you've traveled down the different things that you have faced in this life when each time we face some new difficulty believing Satan's right there to try to get us to doubt and not maybe to try to get us to doubt God but to get him get us to doubt that he's going to do it for us but we should be able to look and say wherefore did us down down because we after all that he has brought us through there's times the Satan will come and try to get you to doubt your pastor try to get you to doubt the ministry that you said in there where the RAM said Satan has been trying a long time to get you to doubt need don't do that he said you just believed this word you don't have to believe me but believe this see if I say this word it's not mine it's his my words different but this is his Jesus said believe us now believe us now not that I'm in the father and father me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that are well within me we can say the same thing we stand behind this sacred s in words that we speak it's not of ourselves but it's the words of our Father that's within us turning to first Thessalonians chapter 1 verse two we give things to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father knowing brethren beloved your election of God for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake that's how that's how you know that's that's through how you find that doubt I told the folks at home I said I've been here long enough now there should not be a one of you doubt me says and you became followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much affliction with the joy of the Holy Ghost you know who you know what manner of men labor among you this gospel that you have here it's come in not just in word but it's come in power and in the Holy Ghost and it's a life-changing word and it changes you forever once you said under this word you're never the same and every service you come there's it's just you becoming more and more like Jesus why because the word is transforming it's the power of transformation the spoken word of God I've seen people to go through things where they begin to say why me why am I going through this and they begin to question maybe God doesn't love me maybe he doesn't care why am I going through this why am I facing death Paul said for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus there's nothing separate us from his love and he allows us to face things and go through things because we're going to grow by him I went through some trials myself that while going through them I didn't want to go through but when I come out on the other side I wouldn't take nothing for him because God always brings us out victorious and we always come out on the other side better than when we entered the tribe he counts us worthy of the trials it's character-building once the rapture takes place and we're caught up to meet him in the air there's no more character building so all of that happens here this is where we build character so during those character-building times it's not a time to doubt him no matter how long he goes on there's things that I face that I wanted them over quickly especially when it involved the life of someone else in my family I wanted it to be over quickly but guess what that's not always God's will but I can tell you this when it is over there will be victory and you'll come out better than you could have ever imagined this situation to come out I faced the trial went on for a year and he concerned a member of our family and one of the girls that we had adopted told some lies and we ended up in court and he went on for a year over right away it involved my son I wanted his name cleared I wanted it over right away I wanted her to admit she lied but even when she did admit she lied the the prosecuting attorney didn't even believe her belief she was lying when she said she was lying but you know what God had a provided way and God had a way which took us through a process that in the end there was professional testimony that he was innocent and that I never had imagined it would work that way I didn't think we'd have it would go through a wave a psychiatrist testifying but it did but you don't want it cleared his name forever they throw the case out God had a better way than the one how I thought it should have been handled I wanted it to be over as soon as it started but looking back though it took a year looking back I'm more than satisfied with the outcome partly I never doubted the love of God during but I did have to fight doubt I did have to fight discouragement I did have to fight depression and it seemed like then the devil didn't let up during the whole time but in the end he was a defeated foe when when I was fighting doubt the hardest I would get a hold of family members and tell him about what was going on and say pray for us I'd say request prayer for us at church I got as many people as I could praying for us I felt somebody's prayers got it reach through the Bible says to ask and you shall receive I figured it for a lot of people were asking if we were definitely going to receive I figured if there was a lot of people knocking the door was gonna be over for the Benham said in the message of persevering he said to his word is a sword the Bible said in Hebrews 4:12 it said the word is sharper than any two-edged sword it adjourns the thoughts that's in the heart that's what the word does now the only thing that can handle this sword is a hand and the only thing that can handle God's Word is failest if the word is a sword then faith holds it and grips it when people are dueling like two men meet with they're dueling that's you and the devil trying to get you to doubt now your sword that you've got it may be ever so good it's a million times better than his I'm going to tell you his is not even a sword it's a stick [Applause] but yours is a sword but if the ham that holds the sword is weak the snick can overcome it but no matter how little this hand is if it holds the Word of God with faith it can put anything down it is you don't have to say well the pastor has great faith it's not the pastor you can have great faith he said no matter how small the hand is that handles the sword it's if it handles it with faith you don't need some great position to be able to handle that sword of faith that's sort of the word to overcome doubt all you need is faith to believe when it looks like there is no way because that's where the Lord a lot of times likes it to come to it seems to where it looks like there's no way to overcome it there's no way around it no way through it no way under it to where it looks impossible because he is the god of impossibility [Applause] when it's I have often said this when we it's all said and done we could say it was nobody but the Lord that saw us through it it wasn't by our mitre our power but it was the Lord that saw us through it that's the way he wants it he's a jealous God he's not going to share credit with anyone he said see he's holding it in his right hand talking about the devil and you and your right hand and when your swords locked when you locked with the devil says is it so or not so now he's pressing to you saying say it's wrong say it's wrong you mustn't believe it but if you believe it see these swords come right straight down to the handles now if I can push his back with my handle the blade like that where I'm at I'm directly straight to his heart cuz I'm on the right side at his left and when I press with faith with the word Satan Jesus commissioned me to do this and we lock and raise up the hand of faith and say an angel met me on der it said so thus the first thing you know that throws the sword right straight in he's conquered I come to challenge you and thus saith the Lord that's the believer when he has faith to handle the work how many people know that the Bible says whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have whatsoever things that you desire you believe that's the word what do you desire whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them what do you do you believe like it's already done you believe like you already have it commit it to the Lord an angel and the Covenant brother bream says how do you do I suppose we're strangers God Almighty who created the heavens and earth who is his his presence I stand in now knows that your life could not be hid as far as his will would be he could reveal it oh my I just wish I could get I wish I could explain what I mean don't doubt your prayer is answered lady sitting right there with the red coat that's got the high blood pressure god bless you here he's calling someone out he says don't doubt your prayer is answered this is someone that didn't make it up to have a prayer card come through the prayer line it was somebody that we would say unfortunately was not able to get into the prayer line but she was praying and God answered her prayer and he wanted her to know that he answered her prayer not when she went to the doctor and found out her blood pressure was okay he wanted her to know right then and believe it without seeing it and say said don't doubt your prayers been answered he answers prayer that's that's why he's told us to pray to him the answers prayer when I talked to the Lord I don't talk with him I guess a great big intelligence or our fathers and all this or whatever I talked to him just like I'm talking to a person I would talk to him just like that I was talking to another man in other words just make it plain and simple I expressed to him what's on my mind what I'm thinking if my thoughts need to be realigned then he'll do it I heard one time a brother from Ireland preaching and he said if the service goes too long when you get in your prayer calls that complain about it he said you'll find out it's pretty hard to complain to God while you're on your knees but I I come to the Lord I talk to him about everything that I'm facing what's going on I expressed to him what I'm filming or how it's making me feel that way I figure we can get them feelings into the line - don't doubt he's there to answer your prayer if you've got faith that he's going to answer your prayer then you can get down with all sincerity and cry out to him knowing that whatsoever things you desire when you asked believing you receive it I was thinking about the story brother Branham tells about that silver-tipped grizzly and he was with a man he called brother bud and said where they were at you could see for miles where the brem said it was there was no trees or no nothing said it was just terribly lost as far as you could see that it wouldn't bear country it was caribou country and said you could see for miles and miles and brother bud said brother gram I'm not trying to doubt you but I know this area up here and all the times I've been up here I've never once seen a Silvertip grizzly he said they're rare and he said and I'm looking around and as far as I can see the eye can see there's no grizzly bears out there brother branham said you know what his answer was he's Jehovah Jireh he's your whole word Jenna he'll provide but I'm not trying to doubt you but I don't see work and come from the brother branham never doubted it why he wasn't looking at the circumstances he wasn't looking at the scenery as far as they could see there was nothing but that was just scenery where the bud was looking for some natural way for the Silvertip to show up I believe that if God showed brother Branham a vision about it that there was some supernatural involved you know how the story goes when they finally got the bear and he shot him why the bear started charging him and brother bud said I I believe he was gonna get it but I didn't know he was gonna be in our last but it happened Jesus said to Peter were for dinner style down when I like for something that I read the Prophet said about this situation he said at least Peter got out of the boat he had enough faith none of the others said if it's used and let me come walking on the water but Peter had enough faith to say I can get out of this boat and do it if it's you but the Bible says when the waves become bolsters in other words when the scenery when he begin to take in the scenery of where he was that's when he started to doubt the things that you go through is just scenery in the journey that you're on the answer is there and it comes supernaturally he's involved that song we sing he's got it all in control and if we believe that song says in one place in every Road I walked down I believe it's in his plan we need to have enough faith to get out of the boat we need to have enough faith as to say I believe in witness when the scenery says just the opposite get out of the boat take a step of faith now I don't know the Bible doesn't say how many steps that Peter took but he walked on the water so he took enough steps to call it walking just take it if all you God has taken enough steps to call it walking then his hand will be there to pull you along pull you up he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us he's there even when we don't feel that he is he's there even when your mind is not on him don't tell me your mind is on God all the time I know other than the better we're human we've got other we got things going on things we have to do in this life but we should keep in mind and everything we're doing we should keep him in mind with everything we're doing trust him no matter what the circumstances say no matter how that it looks and times it looked like it ain't gonna work out at all but he knows how to make it work out and the thing about it is you're his child he loves you and he cares about everything that you're involved in he cares about your job he cares about your car he cares about your house everyone's readers say one time he said he cares so much he cares what you had for breakfast this morning he cares for us why would we doubt him now there should be no place in our heart for doubt when Satan comes trying to bring doubt the way brother Adam said he would then there should be something immediately say identify that's him because it's trying to bring down there's someone here tonight maybe that's had an experience with God maybe you're a new Christian I don't know I don't know everybody here don't doubt don't doubt your experience don't doubt what God has done for you because he's got a whole lot more in store [Applause] amen and everything I face as it goes on seems like sometimes trials get harder it's supposed to I think about that message brother Brennan preached as the eagle stirreth its nest and he says that mother Eagle will begin to take all the feathers and all the fluff and everything out of the nest the nest is held together with briars and thorns and breath it's not comfortable once he starts pulling out all the fluff job don't want us to become comfortable in this world now I'm not talking about your natural comfort I'm talking about spiritually and every trial we go through reminds us reminds me that I'm just traveling through here this is not my destination I'm on my way somewhere else this is just a brief stopping over I've tried to tell my children as they were growing up and as new they were in high school I tried to tell them look it may seem like it these years are taking a long time but they're gonna pass quickly now I look around and see remember when I stood in this church some 34 years ago young boy got married right up here in the front now I'm not a young boy no more and I look around and say where did all that time ago this life is a fleeting thing it goes by quick when you're young you don't feel it so much the older you get the more you feel it how quick it is you kind of like to sometimes naturallyspeaking put the brakes on a little bit what you can't people try hold on to you but you can't I tell my wife I say youth is wasted on the young they don't even know what they got with this life it's we're not gonna be here forever it's we look at it and maybe think well I've been serving God for years and I've heard for years that the rapture was coming that's only been a short fleeting time if you think about it in the aspect of which I was just talking that time is just bleeded away it was short now here we are much closer I look around and I see the things that are happening in the world news but it makes me realize how close we're getting I remember a time going through where the wall came down in Germany and you know the Soviet Union disbanded and for a while nobody was afraid of Russia and now all the sudden that's changed again the guerrilla Brenham said don't fear them because communism friends didn't come up to have any part with the bride I believe brother branham said that God allowed communism to raise up to come against Catholicism so they're not even concerned with you because it's a bride of Jesus Christ and when those times come we're gonna be gone out of here anyway but I still believe what the Prophet said he said there was a bomb in Russia with the United States name on it and I still believe that and I believe there's judgment coming to this nation and I look around the shape this nation is in y-you I look back when I was a kid I would have never imagined it being in a situation in the shape that it's in now every religion they want every religion to be respected except Christianity we won't ever religion to be accepted every religion to be considered we consider them except for Christian you own the store during the holiday times they get to where they can't say Merry Christmas no more because it might offend somebody the only ones are not worried about defending or the Christian and homosexuality is took this nation over it ain't just out then the outsides now it's in your government as well and we look around and we see laws constantly being passed for them Sodom judgments coming amen we're getting closer it's a very dangerous time we live in because we've got to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints but it's also a wonderful time we're living in because of the fulfillment of his word amen I love you with all my heart I trust that I've said something tonight that's been a help to you encouragement encourage your faith amen you can call me head brother Brian god bless you this world is not my home just a passin through [Music] [Music] [Music] and I [Music] they're all expecting me that's one with Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and I can [Music] just over the glory man
