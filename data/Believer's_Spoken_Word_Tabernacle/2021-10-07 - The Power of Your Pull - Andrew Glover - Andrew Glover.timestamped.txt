[29:55] been arranged by him
[29:56] you know we we planned this week to have
[29:59] uh to have meetings this coming weekend
[30:01] and of course i've announced that here
[30:03] ever since last thursday that brother
[30:05] homer's not going to be here but
[30:07] this was arranged i believe by god here
[30:10] tonight
[30:12] and i believe that just i believe it's
[30:14] that way even for every every service
[30:17] sometimes we we
[30:19] we maybe miss that part of it but to
[30:21] understand that god is mindful and to
[30:23] know that this night he already had this
[30:25] night as he did every other part within
[30:28] his mind
[30:29] god has arranged it just as much as when
[30:31] you
[30:32] you've heard me say it time and time
[30:33] again when brother branham would talk
[30:35] about having the handkerchief in a
[30:36] certain place and the glasses in a
[30:38] certain place
[30:39] god himself has orchestrated this it is
[30:42] all under his leading for this moment
[30:44] tonight
[30:46] and the greatest thing we can do is you
[30:47] know it's just like they take a camera
[30:49] and they'll set it out there you know in
[30:51] a field and they want to try to catch
[30:53] that as the stars and the sky is passing
[30:55] by they'll open the aperture up and the
[30:58] eye and it'll just catch that whole
[30:59] progression of light and that flow
[31:01] across the sky we just want to capture
[31:04] what god is going to do here in this
[31:06] moment lord let my soul let my life just
[31:09] be like that great aperture that just
[31:11] takes in
[31:12] what it is that you desire for me to
[31:15] have and to experience here tonight amen

[39:51] sure to stand back and give you all the
[39:53] praise all the honor and all the glory
[39:55] for it's in the wonderful name of our
[39:57] lord and savior jesus christ we pray and
[40:00] all the believer says
[40:03] amen and amen god bless you this evening
[40:05] in the book of malachi
[40:07] the fourth chapter amen in the fifth
[40:09] verse god god bless you brother justin
[40:11] good to see you and your wife here this
[40:12] evening amen i i've been praying that
[40:14] they would be here too i have a right
[40:16] home
[40:17] i only bought a one-week ticket here so
[40:20] amen but we sure appreciate them coming
[40:21] down this evening and we want to look
[40:23] here in malachi the fourth chapter a
[40:26] very familiar reading in the fifth verse
[40:28] amen the bible says behold i
[40:31] will send you
[40:33] amen now a lot of people only see
[40:34] william branham and malachi 4 5 and 6
[40:37] but there's actually two other parts
[40:39] he says behold i which is god
[40:42] will send you which is the bride of
[40:44] jesus christ elijah which we believe to
[40:47] be william marion branham the prophet
[40:49] before the coming of the great and
[40:51] dreadful day of the lord
[40:53] notice this and he shall turn
[40:55] the heart of the fathers to the children
[40:58] and the heart of the children to their
[41:00] fathers
[41:01] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[41:04] curse now when he's doing this work of
[41:06] turning the prophet of god says or in
[41:07] other words he will rebuild the church
[41:10] again under the power of the holy spirit
[41:13] so he's not coming to do something apart
[41:15] from the holy ghost he's actually coming
[41:17] to fulfill zechariah 4 not by my not by
[41:21] power but by my spirit saith the lord so
[41:24] god is actually sending this ministry to
[41:26] the church in the last days if we can
[41:28] also look in the book of ephesians
[41:31] ephesians the fourth chapter ephesians
[41:34] the fourth chapter
[41:36] and we want to look in the eighth verse
[41:38] of ephesians 4. you love the lord this
[41:41] evening
[41:42] amen in ephesians the fourth chapter the
[41:44] eighth verse
[41:46] paul here
[41:47] are writing to the church he says now
[41:49] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[41:52] on high
[41:53] he led captivity captive
[41:55] and gave gifts unto men
[41:58] now that he ascended is what but that he
[42:00] also descended first
[42:03] into the lower parts of the earth he
[42:04] that descended
[42:05] is the same also that ascended up far so
[42:08] it's not two separate people it's the
[42:09] same god doing this
[42:11] up far above all heavens that he might
[42:14] feel all things now
[42:15] amen in the 11th verse and he gave some
[42:18] apostles and some prophets and some
[42:21] pastors some evangelists and some
[42:23] teachers now if somebody walks up to you
[42:26] and hands you a 20 bill or a 50 bill or
[42:28] 100 bill or even a dollar bill
[42:31] they've given you something now the next
[42:33] question is what is this for why why are
[42:35] you giving this to me
[42:37] and paul comes along and answers this
[42:39] and says for the perfecting of the
[42:41] saints
[42:42] for the work of the ministry for the
[42:44] edifying of the body of christ now the
[42:46] prophet of god says or to bring the
[42:48] church to a living faith in christ so
[42:51] he's given these gifts to bring the
[42:53] church to a living faith of jesus christ
[42:56] till we all come in the unity of the
[42:58] faith the 13th verse and of the
[43:00] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[43:02] perfect man and to the measure of the
[43:05] stature of the fullness of christ that
[43:07] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[43:09] to and fro
[43:10] carried about with every wind of
[43:12] doctrine by the slate of men and cunning
[43:15] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[43:17] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[43:21] may grow up into him all things which is
[43:23] the head even christ from whom the whole
[43:26] body fitly joined together compacted by
[43:29] that which every joint supply according
[43:32] to the effectual working in the measure
[43:34] of every part make an increase of the
[43:37] body and to the edifying of itself in
[43:41] love we ask the lord this evening to add
[43:43] the blessing
[43:44] to the reading of his word as you can be
[43:46] seated here this afternoon amen we thank
[43:49] the lord for the reading of the word of
[43:50] god amen amen from those scriptures
[43:53] tonight if the lord would help me
[43:55] for a few moments to see then i would
[43:57] speak to you on if i would title it
[43:58] tonight i want to speak to you on the
[44:00] power of your pull
[44:02] the power of your pull or maybe to say
[44:05] it like this pulling on or operating the
[44:08] gift that god sends to you amen i
[44:11] believe in this hour that god has sent
[44:13] some wonderful gifts to the church i
[44:16] believe god has sent many powerful gifts
[44:18] to the church and i believe that he has
[44:20] also sent gifts of rest he has sent
[44:22] gifts of peace he has sent the gift of
[44:24] power brother ram says he give us the
[44:26] gift of water which is the life of god
[44:28] the bread of god all these gifts he's
[44:30] given us but then we also find amen that
[44:33] god actually give gifts unto men now
[44:35] amen we didn't gather here tonight just
[44:37] to have another church service we didn't
[44:39] gather here just to see who was here or
[44:41] who didn't show up but we gathered here
[44:43] tonight on purpose and that is that when
[44:45] we would leave this service tonight we
[44:47] would not leave further away from god
[44:49] but whether we would leave closer to god
[44:52] now amen i know sometimes we get in our
[44:54] minds that maybe a thirsty night service
[44:56] or if you your church you have wednesday
[44:58] night it's just a wednesday night
[45:00] service or it's just a thursday night
[45:02] service and it's maybe not a convention
[45:04] it's maybe not a youth camp or a special
[45:06] meeting amen but i want to say that the
[45:09] message of the hour has made every
[45:11] service a revival amen the message of
[45:13] the hour has brought us away from the
[45:15] ideas of denominational revivals where
[45:18] that if the music is at the right speed
[45:20] we can have church and if the if the the
[45:22] right preachers in town we can have
[45:23] church but the message of the hour has
[45:26] released to us a word revival which that
[45:28] word is a never failing word the bible
[45:31] says heaven earth will pass away but my
[45:33] word shall never pass away so amen this
[45:36] revival that we're a part of this
[45:37] evening amen is a revival that will
[45:40] never pass away the prophet of god said
[45:42] in the second coming of the lord he said
[45:44] now we know that revivals only come by
[45:47] the holy spirit he's the one who brings
[45:49] revival we cannot do it ourselves he
[45:52] says we can only make the effort and god
[45:55] has to bless that effort he said and we
[45:57] trust that he will so amen it's not that
[46:00] you don't have anything to do amen we've
[46:02] all heard it said that the preacher
[46:04] didn't bring the revival in his
[46:05] briefcase right we've all heard it said
[46:07] that the the evangelist didn't pack the
[46:09] revival or a specific preacher amen but
[46:12] the holy ghost brings a revival but just
[46:14] when the holy ghost brings revival the
[46:15] prophet says amen that you've got to
[46:17] make an effort now that word effort amen
[46:20] is a vigorous determined attempt it is
[46:22] it is not something casual it is not
[46:25] something that you just look at and say
[46:26] well maybe i'll get involved or maybe i
[46:28] won't amen but you actually release
[46:31] yourself to the power of the holy ghost
[46:33] in the message the great commission he
[46:35] says i believe if we'll all get together
[46:38] and pray together and stand together
[46:40] that god will bless us together see if
[46:43] we'll get together if we'll pray
[46:45] together if we'll stand together amen
[46:47] then god will bless us together don't
[46:49] you think so he said i believe if he
[46:52] will if we'll put forth an effort now
[46:55] see he'd been the revival just the
[46:57] minister can't bring it it takes all of
[46:59] us together he said and you're sick
[47:01] people here i could pray a prayer of
[47:03] sick for everybody but you all helping
[47:06] me and we all together can pray a prayer
[47:08] for the sick for everybody here he said
[47:11] everybody in edmonton we sure can but i
[47:13] need you and we all need god so in order
[47:16] for a service to be a service of success
[47:19] we need god right amen we need each
[47:22] other we need a we need a man of god to
[47:24] preach the word we need a song leader to
[47:26] sing some songs we we need some people
[47:28] to say amen to the word right amen a
[47:30] prophet is showing you that when you
[47:32] come together and you pray together and
[47:34] you stand together then god will come
[47:36] down and he will bless us all together
[47:38] now in other words what the prophet is
[47:40] saying is you operate the gift now that
[47:43] word operation means of a person it
[47:46] means a control of the functioning amen
[47:48] or of a machine or a process or a system
[47:51] in the message glorified jesus the
[47:53] prophet of god introduces to us the term
[47:56] amen the operation of the holy spirit he
[47:58] said may those without the holy spirit
[48:00] be born again tonight with the holy
[48:03] spirit i pray father that all the sick
[48:05] and the afflicted everyone will be
[48:07] healed this night he said get glory out
[48:09] of the service for we commit ourselves
[48:11] amen to thee for the operation of the
[48:14] holy spirit in jesus name another place
[48:16] she said god in his mercy through the
[48:18] operation of the holy spirit reveals
[48:21] spiritual truth he meant the word itself
[48:24] in the message our hope is in god he
[48:26] said the holy spirit was upon the church
[48:28] at pentecost do you believe that amen
[48:30] and it come right down to the age right
[48:32] on down to luther amen to baptist to
[48:35] methodist on down through unto this age
[48:37] here he said it's the same holy spirit
[48:40] when people get amen up they get their
[48:42] faith up into a place that they'll get
[48:44] the blessings and then to realize it's
[48:47] there see then the same operation of the
[48:50] holy spirit will be operating in the
[48:52] church like it did back there just the
[48:54] same in other words he's showing you
[48:56] that if you can release yourself in the
[48:59] presence of god then it'll raise your
[49:01] faith to a level he meant to believe
[49:03] that this service is not just for the
[49:04] person next to you or it's not just for
[49:07] the preacher or just for the elders amen
[49:09] but this service is for every believer
[49:11] here tonight he's been down the message
[49:13] and i'm just laying the foundation if
[49:14] that's okay and the message things that
[49:16] are to be the problem of god is speaking
[49:18] of how that a natural birth is prepared
[49:21] amen so that the child is born as
[49:23] perfect as it can be in that message he
[49:25] said now thank you if god in his mercy
[49:27] has the mother before the little baby is
[49:30] born he said it's craving for some
[49:32] vitamins and the mother's word speaks
[49:34] forth amen died i want cantaloupe i want
[49:37] watermelon i want something other he
[49:39] said why he'll do everything he can to
[49:41] get that because he wants his child to
[49:43] be born as perfect as it can be and
[49:46] he'll do everything that he's able to do
[49:48] to get it he said then how much more
[49:50] abler is he amen he is a creator now
[49:53] think how able he is to prepare us a
[49:55] body he meant to live like his own
[49:57] glorious body if we want to live he said
[50:00] there is something in us that calls to
[50:02] live he said and there's something in us
[50:05] that calls to do right now watch this
[50:07] there's something in you that is calling
[50:09] out to live there is something in you
[50:11] that is calling out to do right he said
[50:13] then god will call somebody on the
[50:15] platform amen or the pulpit that will
[50:18] preach the absolute truth hey then let
[50:20] me sit like this he meant in all reality
[50:23] you're the ones that call me here
[50:25] tonight amen on sunday morning when your
[50:27] pastor stands behind the pulpit in all
[50:30] reality you're the ones that called him
[50:32] behind the pulpit amen it wasn't
[50:34] necessarily your physical being he meant
[50:36] but it was something on the inside of
[50:38] you amen that was needing something from
[50:41] god amen and god has provided a channel
[50:43] even where he can release the blessings
[50:46] of god upon the church of the living god
[50:48] he meant to recognize tonight friends
[50:50] that you've got a part to play in these
[50:52] services amen we didn't just come
[50:54] together to see who showed up he'd been
[50:56] in to sing a few songs and to hear a few
[50:58] scriptures and quotes we are here
[51:00] tonight amen for the operation of the
[51:02] holy spirit now the prophet laid out a
[51:04] powerful promise he meant that if you
[51:06] release yourself amen then the same holy
[51:09] ghost that operated in the book of acts
[51:11] amen would return in the church in the
[51:12] last days and would operate here in this
[51:15] church he been then what happened in
[51:17] those days he been the sick were healed
[51:19] he'd been demons were cast out they've
[51:21] been prison walls fell they've been
[51:23] demons lost their power amen people who
[51:26] was running from god amen the holy ghost
[51:28] arrested their soul let me say this
[51:30] tonight friends amen i think it's time
[51:33] to realize that god is not limited to
[51:35] just the four walls of this building
[51:37] amen he's not just limited to this
[51:39] platform he's not just limited to them
[51:41] jews amen but you may have a loved one
[51:43] right now that's running a hundred miles
[51:45] in the opposite direction of where they
[51:47] ought to be going but right here amen in
[51:49] the house of god on the thursday night
[51:51] under the operation of the holy ghost
[51:54] amen the spirit of god can drop in the
[51:56] building and faith can begin to build
[51:58] and right here while i'm preaching your
[52:00] faith amen can dispatch the holy ghost
[52:03] he meant to that wayward boy or that
[52:05] wayward girl and return him to the fold
[52:09] are you hearing me church we're not
[52:10] under the operation of a man we're under
[52:13] the operation of the son of man amen see
[52:15] he will call somebody amen to the pulpit
[52:18] that will preach the absolute truth he
[52:21] said see it shows that if you're a real
[52:23] child of god amen then you'll begin to
[52:26] cry out amen i know we've done away with
[52:28] amen i know we've done away with
[52:30] hollering and screaming but a prophet
[52:32] said if you're a real child of god when
[52:34] you hear the word of god you'll begin to
[52:36] cry out amen you'll begin to say this
[52:39] amen god take it away from me amen
[52:42] circumcise me from this take these
[52:44] things away from me he said because it's
[52:46] needed for your heavenly home that
[52:48] you're going to he's gone to prepare you
[52:50] because you've got to be a real word
[52:52] bride of christ in other words what the
[52:54] prophet is saying is we need some
[52:56] preachers back in the pulpit who will
[52:58] take the gloves off and we'll call black
[53:01] black and white white and sin sin and
[53:03] righteousness righteousness and don't
[53:05] worry about who it offends come on don't
[53:08] worry about who it hurts amen now i'm
[53:09] just going to take some liberty and
[53:11] preach here tonight if that's okay amen
[53:13] because i actually remember in the days
[53:14] when a man or god would preach against
[53:16] television everybody in the church would
[53:18] stand up and say that ain't nothing but
[53:19] the truth preach against high heels
[53:21] everybody in the church today man preach
[53:23] against makeup everybody said amen ain't
[53:25] been preaching against men wearing
[53:27] swords everybody said amen amen but now
[53:29] it's got to where the church is full of
[53:31] it amen so if a man of god says anything
[53:33] about it amen everybody wants up and
[53:35] they don't say amen and they don't show
[53:37] up hell we might as well preach that we
[53:39] they don't show up for two weeks i'll
[53:41] tell you why because they've not opened
[53:43] up their heart to the operation of the
[53:45] holy ghost listen friends if the holy
[53:47] ghost speaks to a man of god and reveals
[53:50] something in your life and it's
[53:51] hindering you from the promises of god
[53:53] and it's hindering you from a revival
[53:55] amen if a man of god's got the courage
[53:57] to say it's sin amen there ought to be
[53:59] some people and people in the pulpits
[54:02] it's got the courage to say that's the
[54:04] truth listen we've all been guilty at
[54:06] some time or another amen but thank god
[54:08] there's still a place to truth to repent
[54:10] of the things that are wrong when the
[54:12] word of god strikes our path something
[54:14] cries out god take it from it in that
[54:17] amazing the prophet said they actually
[54:18] will cry out and then god take it from
[54:20] me they won't make excuses of why they
[54:23] need it
[54:26] they won't make excuses of why they need
[54:28] it amen when a man of god hits makeup
[54:30] they won't make excuses of why their
[54:32] face is pale and they need to wear a
[54:33] little bit hey they'll say hell might as
[54:36] well preach that now and then they'll
[54:38] say take it away from me amen when a man
[54:40] of god hits unclean movies and homes
[54:42] they won't make excuses for why they've
[54:44] got them they'll say goddamn things
[54:46] shouldn't be there take them out of here
[54:47] are you hearing me amen listen friends i
[54:50] believe the house of god is a place of
[54:51] shouting i believe it's a place of
[54:53] rejoicing i believe it's a place where
[54:55] we ought to dance amen do we can't dance
[54:57] no more but i still believe the house of
[55:00] god is a place of correction i still
[55:02] believe it's a place amen where judgment
[55:05] begins at the house of god
[55:08] amen we're living in a time where the
[55:09] two spirits amen that begin in genesis
[55:11] the prophets that are coming to maturity
[55:14] we know what those spirits are they are
[55:16] a true spirit and they are a false
[55:18] spirit now when you begin to look at
[55:19] this you'll realize that we've all heard
[55:21] this statement amen that there is a true
[55:23] five-fold ministry and there is a
[55:25] falsified full ministry amen and people
[55:28] amazes me that people have actually
[55:29] tried to identify amen what a true
[55:32] faithful ministry is
[55:34] and what a false faithful ministry is
[55:36] amen but the amazing thing to me is is
[55:38] the bible identifies what a true
[55:40] ministry is and what a false ministry is
[55:43] amen the word identifies the true
[55:45] characteristic of the true faithful
[55:47] ministry it is found in second timothy 4
[55:50] 2 when timothy was being wrote to by
[55:53] paul he said preach the word
[55:56] amen the true identifying characteristic
[55:59] amen of a true ministry is preach the
[56:01] word the instant in season amen now
[56:04] watch this instant in season out of
[56:06] season amen smile never raise your voice
[56:09] always let everything slip under the rug
[56:11] hey then that may be what smiley face in
[56:13] texas says but that's not what the
[56:15] apostle paul said to timothy he said
[56:17] reprove and rebuke and exhort with all
[56:20] long suffering amen and doctrine see
[56:23] that preaching is not sugar coding amen
[56:26] it is preaching the word of god and it's
[56:28] not tickling your ears and saying things
[56:30] you want to hear it's saying what the
[56:32] church needs to hear amen that what the
[56:34] prophet said is the true faithful
[56:35] ministry amen will preach the absolute
[56:38] truth amen john says it this way amen
[56:40] then said jesus to the disciples which
[56:42] believed on him if you continue in my
[56:45] word amen then ye are my disciples
[56:47] indeed he says and ye shall know the
[56:50] truth and the truth shall set you free
[56:53] amen then what is the truth amen the
[56:55] truth is the word amen we got young
[56:57] people that needs to be free we've got
[57:00] marriages that need to be free we've got
[57:02] homes that need to be free we've got
[57:04] churches that need to be free and
[57:06] there's only one thing going to set them
[57:07] free and that is the word of god amen by
[57:10] the mouth of a holy ghost-filled
[57:12] preacher in the season that the word is
[57:14] being sent and then the prophet said
[57:16] this way he said what we need is
[57:18] somebody who will say it like it is amen
[57:20] the prophet said other visions was
[57:22] contrary to the bible he said but there
[57:24] was a man there micah amen whose vision
[57:26] was with the bible he said for one man
[57:28] who took god's word he said his vision
[57:30] lined up with god's word and it was
[57:32] perfect it was the absolute truth and a
[57:35] vision must line up with god's word he
[57:37] said a preacher amen must line up with
[57:40] god's word amen then that's a amen
[57:42] that's a burden that's been placed upon
[57:44] the ministry amen how can a man that's
[57:46] not lined up with the word amen preach
[57:48] to the church of the living god and tell
[57:49] them to line up with the word amen but
[57:51] when the lamb
[57:53] what can i preach when the preachers
[57:55] lined up amen then the church will come
[57:57] in line
[57:59] amen and i'll say it like this and amen
[58:01] just give me some grace for a minute if
[58:02] that's okay god called preachers are not
[58:04] cystified preachers
[58:07] prophet of god said what we need is is
[58:10] this he says while we ask the ministers
[58:12] of this that's in this building tonight
[58:14] he says that believes that this message
[58:15] that i preached he said that these
[58:17] creeds and man-made doctrines today is
[58:19] not of god but they are of man we really
[58:22] ought to go back to the bible way go
[58:24] back to the beginning he said then i
[58:26] want some of those ministers to walk
[58:28] forward and stand here with me while we
[58:30] lay hands and pray for these people he
[58:32] said see these people that seek him for
[58:34] god's blessings upon their life and some
[58:36] of you ministers if you will that that
[58:39] believes this to be the vital truth of
[58:41] god he said don't come no other way see
[58:44] be a man who believes it to be the
[58:46] absolute truth amen that if you're going
[58:49] to believe the message and claim to
[58:51] preach the message and the prophet
[58:52] saying don't be a amen be a man
[58:55] with the message when i look up that
[58:57] word be a man it means to put up with
[58:59] something it means to take
[59:00] responsibility for it then a prophet
[59:03] comes along and says and a man running
[59:04] from the presence he said when you see
[59:06] them in this day now the word of god has
[59:09] made these promises of things that we
[59:11] see happening now then we've got the
[59:13] responsibility to either face up to it
[59:16] amen or to walk away from it he said you
[59:18] cannot stay neutral you've got to do
[59:20] something amen you can't come in the
[59:22] church down come in the church door and
[59:24] go out the same person you came in
[59:26] you're either further away or you're
[59:28] closer to god he said every time you
[59:31] come in or go out amen but it's easy to
[59:33] shirk away from the responsibility amen
[59:36] let me sit like this i believe it's time
[59:38] amen that when we hear the word we
[59:40] receive the word and we take
[59:41] responsibility amen for the word we're
[59:44] hearing we've had enough pitchfork
[59:45] sermons
[59:47] we've had enough sir i'm just preaching
[59:49] what's on my heart if that's okay we've
[59:51] had enough sermons where people sit
[59:53] there and say well that's for brother
[59:54] brian that's for brother samuel that's
[59:56] for sister so-and-so amen no amen at
[59:58] some time or another you've got to stand
[1:00:00] up and say that's for me amen it's the
[1:00:03] word of god if it hurts then it hurts if
[1:00:05] it cuts then it cuts amen but god take
[1:00:08] it away from me i want to be a perfect
[1:00:10] word right
[1:00:12] when you begin to look at this you
[1:00:13] realize the prophet said god amen has
[1:00:16] sent these gifts now i said like this i
[1:00:18] believe we should be thankful for all
[1:00:19] that god has sent us i think we should
[1:00:22] be thankful for all that god is sending
[1:00:24] us and i think we ought to be thankful
[1:00:25] for all that god will send us amen god
[1:00:28] has sent us some wonderful things god is
[1:00:30] sending us some wonderful things and i
[1:00:32] believe god has got some more wonderful
[1:00:34] things he been descended upon the church
[1:00:36] but if i could take a minute can i tell
[1:00:38] you a few things i'm thankful for amen
[1:00:40] i'm thankful for a living god i'm
[1:00:42] thankful for a god who is the
[1:00:45] he is the first and he is the last he is
[1:00:47] the beginning and he is the end he is
[1:00:49] the prince of peace he is the king of
[1:00:52] kings he is the lord of lords he is the
[1:00:54] god that was the god that he is and the
[1:00:56] god which shall always be i am thankful
[1:00:59] for god amen i'll tell you something
[1:01:00] else i'm thankful for i'm thankful for a
[1:01:02] messenger that was sent by god he meant
[1:01:05] to deliver a word of truth in an age of
[1:01:08] deception in an age of error he would
[1:01:10] bring the correct understanding of the
[1:01:12] oneness of the godhead of water baptism
[1:01:15] of the holy ghost to the doctrines of
[1:01:17] the apostles he would restore those
[1:01:19] things i say thank god for sending a
[1:01:21] messenger i say thank god for sending a
[1:01:23] message amen without this message we
[1:01:26] would be in a famine without this
[1:01:27] message we would be starving tonight
[1:01:30] amen but god who is rich in mercy even
[1:01:32] set in amos shall be a time of famine
[1:01:35] such has never been seen before it won't
[1:01:37] be for bread or water it'll be for
[1:01:39] hearing the word of god amen but right
[1:01:41] here in the middle of this famine there
[1:01:43] is a church in sheffield ohio and then
[1:01:45] it's not starving and she's not
[1:01:47] dehydrated and she's not barely making
[1:01:50] it amen but she's received a message and
[1:01:52] is hoping to revive them amen i thank
[1:01:54] god for god i thank god for a messenger
[1:01:57] i thank god for a message but i'm going
[1:01:59] to go a step further and say i thank god
[1:02:01] for a faithful ministry who is still
[1:02:04] under their messenger amen faithfully
[1:02:06] preaching the message that god sent us
[1:02:08] in this generation
[1:02:10] amen how many says thank god
[1:02:12] for the gifts he sent us they've been
[1:02:14] seen in every service that we're in amen
[1:02:16] i said like this is another space amen
[1:02:19] that god has given us in the book of
[1:02:21] revelation 2 verse 21 jesus speaking
[1:02:23] there in the age he said i gave her
[1:02:25] speaking of jezebel a space to repent
[1:02:27] amen of her fornication watch this and
[1:02:30] she repented not amen so the time is
[1:02:32] going to come amen then there's going to
[1:02:34] be no more time of repentance
[1:02:36] the member says well he says in the
[1:02:38] five-time church age he said see do you
[1:02:40] know that this church was actually more
[1:02:42] wicked than ahab speak of the roman
[1:02:43] catholic church he said do you know that
[1:02:45] he repre that he repented for a while
[1:02:47] and walked softly before god but you
[1:02:49] can't say that at that roman catholic
[1:02:51] church no sir she has never repented
[1:02:54] amen but as stubbornly amen destroyed
[1:02:57] any and all who tried to help her repent
[1:02:59] watch that she is stubbornly he'd been
[1:03:01] destroyed all who was helping her to
[1:03:03] repent
[1:03:05] can you imagine somebody trying to help
[1:03:08] you to repent and you're stubbornly
[1:03:10] trying to destroy him well glory to god
[1:03:13] he said that is history now watch this
[1:03:15] but god kept raising up not only the
[1:03:17] messengers to each age hating them but
[1:03:19] he raised up some wonderful helpers amen
[1:03:22] for those messengers and then he gave
[1:03:24] every age some wonderful men of god and
[1:03:27] they did everything they could to bring
[1:03:28] the church back to god he said god
[1:03:31] certainly gave her opportunity and
[1:03:33] helped to repent did she ever repent and
[1:03:36] then did she show her first fruit no sir
[1:03:38] she never did and she never will he said
[1:03:42] she is drunk amen she has lost her sins
[1:03:45] in spiritual things amen then the word
[1:03:47] of god says that i gave her space which
[1:03:50] that word space means opportunity it
[1:03:52] means a small amount of time it means a
[1:03:54] portion of time it means off times i
[1:03:57] give her a space to repent and she
[1:03:59] repented not i sent a messenger in her
[1:04:02] age and she repented not i raised the
[1:04:04] pastors in her age and she repented not
[1:04:07] i raised up evangelists in her age and
[1:04:09] she repented not amen and the prophet
[1:04:11] opens the door of why she can't repent
[1:04:14] it's because she's drunk he meant on the
[1:04:16] natural things of the world he meant
[1:04:18] she's drunk on the ideas of religion
[1:04:20] she's drunk on theology amen but here in
[1:04:22] the last days is there anybody say oh
[1:04:25] god amen don't let me get blocked on the
[1:04:27] things of the world to where i lose my
[1:04:29] ability to repent
[1:04:32] amen now put your seatbelt on i'm going
[1:04:33] to preach for a minute amen because
[1:04:35] repentance is still in the bible amen it
[1:04:37] amazes me i've talked to people amen
[1:04:39] that's looking for things to change and
[1:04:41] the one thing you tell them to do is
[1:04:43] repent and they won't do it hey i've
[1:04:45] talked to people before and they say
[1:04:46] well i'm not going to let it go i'm not
[1:04:48] going to forgive amen but i want to
[1:04:50] change amen but let me say this even a
[1:04:52] prophet had to come to a spot where he
[1:04:55] had to humble himself and say i was
[1:04:56] wrong lord i shouldn't have told that
[1:04:58] lie i shouldn't have done that amen
[1:05:01] listen repentance is in the gospel from
[1:05:03] genesis to revelation amen you know how
[1:05:05] revival start is when people start
[1:05:08] repenting even you know how revivals
[1:05:10] break out is when people get before god
[1:05:12] and they kick out all the things of the
[1:05:14] world and they open up their hearts and
[1:05:16] they let the holy ghost come back in
[1:05:18] their lives and begin to rekindle the
[1:05:20] fire old church of living god is there
[1:05:22] anybody here tonight i can say lord
[1:05:24] don't ever let me get so drunk on my job
[1:05:27] and on my work and all my career and all
[1:05:29] these things that i cannot repent
[1:05:32] come on now amen we had listen i'm not
[1:05:34] getting in politics okay hey remember we

[1:05:39] least he knew where he was half the time
[1:05:41] amen we had a president who said he
[1:05:42] didn't repent he just did better amen
[1:05:45] let me say this that's the idea of the
[1:05:47] day we're living in that's the age we're
[1:05:49] living in amen you ain't got to repent
[1:05:51] nobody's wrong everybody's well am i

[1:06:01] white amen but with my god he said come
[1:06:04] out from among them and touch not the
[1:06:06] unclean thing and i'll say tonight
[1:06:08] friends what we need around the message
[1:06:10] is an old-fashioned amen st paul's
[1:06:12] revival and the bible holy ghost back in
[1:06:15] the church until every sin is forgiven
[1:06:17] until every iniquity is remembered no
[1:06:19] more are you hearing me listen friends
[1:06:21] repentance can open up more in a service
[1:06:23] than you realize
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:26] now i know when you go to priesthood
[1:06:28] repentance people get quiet amen but the
[1:06:29] prophet god actually faced this in a
[1:06:31] message called looking at the unseen he
[1:06:33] was speaking and he said see lord he
[1:06:35] said here is a revival he said i've
[1:06:37] fumbled around over here ain't been
[1:06:39] trying to find the lead to say something
[1:06:41] that would break a revival it seems like
[1:06:43] lord i just can't find that spot it
[1:06:45] seems that the people still can't get
[1:06:47] into it somehow the word goes forth i'm
[1:06:50] sure the spirit is here he said lord
[1:06:52] what is the hour that we're living in is
[1:06:55] it the hour of numbness
[1:06:58] is it the hour of numbness is it the
[1:07:00] hour that the church has been lulled
[1:07:02] asleep by the things of the world
[1:07:05] and by all the kinds of things that they
[1:07:07] have listened to that they should not
[1:07:09] have listened to is that our here lord
[1:07:12] listen a prophet of god is standing
[1:07:14] before a congregation in los angeles

[1:07:19] amen let me let me preach here for a
[1:07:21] second is this the hour of numbness and
[1:07:23] he says that right before the spirit of
[1:07:25] god comes down and takes control of his
[1:07:27] voice and looking at the unseen and says
[1:07:29] this is not william branham he has
[1:07:31] nothing to do with this amen this is the
[1:07:34] lord i'm using his voice he has
[1:07:36] surrendered himself amen let me say have
[1:07:38] you ever thought about where he was
[1:07:40] standing when he said that he was
[1:07:41] standing in los angeles where in 64 he
[1:07:44] would stand there and say amen they'll
[1:07:46] find you in the bottom of the sea amen
[1:07:48] from 59 to 64 there was a messenger to
[1:07:52] an age in an age
[1:07:55] in a community called los angeles
[1:07:57] california the very messenger himself
[1:07:59] was standing there and he was preaching
[1:08:01] the word and they were going on as if
[1:08:03] everything was okay they were not

[1:08:21] revival the revival was not just in the
[1:08:23] first pool the revival was not just in
[1:08:25] the second pool the revival was in the
[1:08:28] third pool which was the word which was
[1:08:30] the ability to say the word is right and
[1:08:33] i'm wrong
[1:08:35] is that okay
[1:08:36] is this that our lord then he comes to

[1:08:57] out running we ain't been out ain't been
[1:08:58] committing adultery and smoking amen but

[1:09:03] the schools were in the environments
[1:09:05] that surround us it's a day when it's
[1:09:07] easy to become numb
[1:09:09] come on church amen it's a day when it's
[1:09:11] easy to sit in a message church and
[1:09:13] become numb to the things of god to
[1:09:15] become none to the spiritual things amen
[1:09:17] when i say tonight let the holy ghost
[1:09:19] come down in the church tonight and let
[1:09:21] us awaken our sixth sense amen to
[1:09:23] recognize amen who is in our midst it's
[1:09:26] not just a preacher it's not just a
[1:09:28] pastor amen but the mighty god amen
[1:09:31] elohim himself i stepped down in this
[1:09:34] building tonight he is in the church he
[1:09:36] is not here to be a spectator he is here
[1:09:39] to be a participator he is the preacher
[1:09:42] he is the singer he is the healer he is
[1:09:44] the miracle worker he is the deliverer
[1:09:47] he is the mighty god amen can we open
[1:09:49] our eyes tonight and realize he is here
[1:09:52] he's in the church listen friends the
[1:09:54] prophet stood in a message and said look
[1:09:56] he said deity is not in heaven amen
[1:09:59] deity is an earth and do you realize
[1:10:01] that wasn't any kind of deity he
[1:10:03] identified that deity as identified
[1:10:05] deity he said and in the last days they
[1:10:07] have rejected
[1:10:09] oh god they have rejected identified
[1:10:12] deity and they put him on the outside
[1:10:14] but there was a bride
[1:10:17] there was a bride who had a word to hear
[1:10:20] from the lord
[1:10:22] amen the promise of god said see then we
[1:10:24] ought to recognize who is in our midst
[1:10:26] amen when we come to services even
[1:10:28] though it's a thirsty night amen we
[1:10:30] shouldn't come to say well let's get
[1:10:31] through the service we'll just see who's
[1:10:33] here the prophet said what we bring to
[1:10:35] each service amen identifies of what we
[1:10:37] think of the service you realize what
[1:10:39] the bible says in jeremiah 33 11 that
[1:10:41] the voice of joy and the voice of
[1:10:43] gladness and the voice of the bridegroom
[1:10:46] and the voice of the bride
[1:10:47] and the voice of them shall say
[1:10:50] praise the lord of host for the lord is
[1:10:53] good for his mercy endureth forever and
[1:10:55] of them shall bring the sacrifice of
[1:10:58] praise into the house of the lord so in
[1:11:01] the last days there is going to be a
[1:11:04] people who is going to have the voice of
[1:11:06] joy going to have the voice of gladness
[1:11:08] going to have the voice of the
[1:11:09] bridegroom going to have the voice of
[1:11:11] the bride and here's what amazes me
[1:11:13] she's still going to have to bring a
[1:11:16] sacrifice of praise into the house do
[1:11:18] you know why it's because of the
[1:11:20] pressures of the age we're living in
[1:11:22] even the devil fights us harder on
[1:11:24] thirsty than he does any other day of
[1:11:26] the week he fights you harder on
[1:11:28] saturday than he does any day of the
[1:11:30] week you know why because he knows
[1:11:32] sunday's coming
[1:11:34] he knows sunday's coming he knows
[1:11:36] thirsty not meekness well can we just
[1:11:38] take the breaks off and preach for a
[1:11:40] minute he knows thursday night meeting
[1:11:42] is coming and he knows when you get in
[1:11:44] the atmosphere and you begin to sing the
[1:11:46] songs and you begin to hear the praise
[1:11:48] and you begin to hear the word amen
[1:11:50] you'll begin to pray together you'll
[1:11:52] begin to stand together you'll begin to
[1:11:54] sing together and before long god will
[1:11:57] come down and begin to bless the church
[1:11:59] together the devil knows he'll put forth
[1:12:01] his best effort to keep you out of the
[1:12:03] house of god amen but let me let the
[1:12:05] devil know tonight his best effort is
[1:12:08] not enough his best effort is not enough
[1:12:12] we are here in the house of god if the
[1:12:14] devil can put all his effort into

[1:14:50] good for what you put in it amen let me
[1:14:52] say this friends sometimes in order to
[1:14:54] get something out of something you got
[1:14:56] to put something in it there will be no
[1:14:58] withdrawals if there is no deposits is
[1:15:01] there any members here of this church

[1:15:16] clap my hands i've come here god to give
[1:15:18] you my all
[1:15:20] the prophet of god talked about the
[1:15:21] three main giants didn't he he said what
[1:15:23] did they bring they brought gold
[1:15:24] frankincense and myrrh he said in other
[1:15:27] words amen deity in service to die that
[1:15:30] nobody had to ask them what they thought
[1:15:32] about whose presence they was going to
[1:15:34] stand in nobody they didn't have to open
[1:15:36] their mouth brother and say we think
[1:15:38] he's deity in service to die they looked
[1:15:41] at what they was bringing and by what
[1:15:43] they was bringing identified without
[1:15:45] them even opening their mouths what they
[1:15:47] thought
[1:15:50] can i preach of what they thought of
[1:15:52] whose presence they was coming into the
[1:15:54] prophet said and i say that to us today
[1:15:57] the things that we bring him identifies
[1:15:59] our thoughts about him do you understand
[1:16:01] what i mean if you believe with all of
[1:16:03] your heart amen every word of that then
[1:16:06] you'll identify it by giving your all to
[1:16:08] it amen but if you believe it's a good
[1:16:10] place to associate with some better
[1:16:12] people around church and things like
[1:16:13] that he said that's just about all
[1:16:15] you'll get just a few social hours
[1:16:17] he said but if you really believe with
[1:16:19] all of your heart
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:22] then you'll give everything that's in
[1:16:23] you to it and it identifies you that you
[1:16:27] believe the message that you believe it
[1:16:29] is to be the truth amen then there's a
[1:16:32] reason why the devil doesn't fight you
[1:16:34] during the song service there's a reason
[1:16:36] why he don't fight you during the
[1:16:37] specials amen amen they can sing for two
[1:16:40] hours and you wouldn't nod off he
[1:16:42] remember let the preacher take the
[1:16:43] pulpit and everybody starts nodding off
[1:16:45] there's a reason for that it ain't
[1:16:46] because your back's lit it ain't because
[1:16:48] you're a terrible person it's because
[1:16:50] the devil knows the potential between
[1:16:52] the preaching of the word and the
[1:16:54] pulling of the congregation he knows
[1:16:56] what happens when a man of god gets
[1:16:59] himself out of the way and begins to
[1:17:01] preach the word and the people get
[1:17:02] themselves out of the way and begin to
[1:17:04] receive the word he knows the mechanics
[1:17:07] and the dynamics come together and in a
[1:17:09] few minutes amen there'll be an ignite
[1:17:11] amen between the faith of god and the
[1:17:14] faith that's in the church and there'll
[1:17:15] be miracles and signs and wonders and
[1:17:17] deliverances and the devil don't want
[1:17:19] you to break through amen but i say
[1:17:21] tonight like a prophet said we're gonna
[1:17:23] break through he said i see a
[1:17:25] breakthrough on the audience tonight i
[1:17:28] believe that there is a breakthrough
[1:17:29] listen friends i believe there's a
[1:17:31] breakthrough in the house of god on the
[1:17:33] thursday night
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:35] the prophet said see he don't want you
[1:17:37] to begin to pull amen now listen to this
[1:17:39] he said because hundreds has received
[1:17:42] thee as their savior we're so thankful
[1:17:44] for it and the sick and the crippled
[1:17:46] amen they've been healed he said and now
[1:17:48] god has come into the midst of the
[1:17:51] people and their faith somebody shout
[1:17:53] out their faith
[1:17:55] their faith has drawn out supernatural
[1:17:58] words
[1:18:00] come on church your faith is drawing out
[1:18:03] supernatural words listen these words
[1:18:05] aren't in my human body amen they're in
[1:18:07] a gift that was deposited in me before
[1:18:10] the foundation of the world i don't
[1:18:12] control the gifts you control the gift
[1:18:16] come on amen listen i've been in i have
[1:18:19] seen the gift of god be in operation
[1:18:21] listen all you got to do is start
[1:18:23] pulling and devils will start falling
[1:18:25] all you got to do is start backing the
[1:18:27] word and demons will start losing their
[1:18:29] power
[1:18:30] i've done seen it happen before a few
[1:18:32] years ago i was privileged to be in
[1:18:34] india while i was standing the pulpit
[1:18:36] preaching there was a group of pastors
[1:18:37] over on the side of the platform i
[1:18:39] didn't know any of them and they didn't
[1:18:40] know me i didn't speak their language
[1:18:42] and they didn't speak mine even but i
[1:18:44] was preaching while i was preaching
[1:18:46] brother amen something come over me and
[1:18:48] i looked at that congregation of
[1:18:50] ministers and i said preach the message
[1:18:52] if it's in a little hut somewhere amen
[1:18:54] preach the message don't let the devil
[1:18:56] tell you what you're doing is in vain i
[1:18:58] didn't know why i was saying that but
[1:19:00] when i got done there was a pastor come
[1:19:01] to me and hug my neck and through an
[1:19:04] interpreter he said tell that brother
[1:19:06] amen i have got a little church in a
[1:19:08] village in india that i was about ready
[1:19:10] to close up because i thought i was
[1:19:12] wasting my time he said but that man
[1:19:14] don't even know where that church is
[1:19:16] ain't been but god knows where
[1:19:19] oh keep that devil out of here tonight
[1:19:22] amen that i didn't know where his church
[1:19:23] was i didn't need to know where his
[1:19:25] church was but god knew where it was and
[1:19:27] god had the answer amen before he had
[1:19:30] the problem are you hearing me tonight
[1:19:32] church then while the word is being
[1:19:34] preached you may have not talked to the
[1:19:35] preacher for a week amen but i believe
[1:19:37] there's supernatural words that begins
[1:19:39] to fall out of the gift
[1:19:42] the prophet said explaining to them
[1:19:44] their life of what they have done and
[1:19:46] what they must do and what will be
[1:19:48] in that beautiful out of the gift comes
[1:19:50] the past the present and the future
[1:19:55] a man that's never met you before can
[1:19:57] explain your life that has been your
[1:19:59] explain your life it is and can preach
[1:20:02] to you what shall be
[1:20:05] now the reason why that happens is is
[1:20:07] the plot of god said there's a hidden
[1:20:09] power in the message he said that's what
[1:20:11] we're trying to bring our churches today
[1:20:12] he said with a high staple and the
[1:20:14] prettiest pews and the best dressed
[1:20:16] crowd he said that don't break the toe
[1:20:18] hold no it takes the hidden power of the
[1:20:21] spirit of god it takes the word in there
[1:20:24] to break the hold it takes the word in
[1:20:27] there to break the whole amen how many
[1:20:28] knows the part of god told a story about
[1:20:31] an attorney who was arguing a case and
[1:20:33] he had watched another attorney and he
[1:20:35] he had he had memorized everything that
[1:20:38] attorney said everything he done and he
[1:20:40] went before the judge and he stood there
[1:20:41] and cried and he boo-hooed and he beat
[1:20:44] the desk and he stomped his foot and the
[1:20:46] problem of god said the judge finally
[1:20:47] said enough is enough he said if you're
[1:20:49] going to defeat this case it's going to
[1:20:51] take some long in other words emotion
[1:20:53] was not enough
[1:20:55] [Music]
[1:20:56] to defeat the
[1:20:58] to defeat the case it was going to take
[1:21:00] something with some strength in it and
[1:21:01] let me say this i love to shout i love
[1:21:04] to dance but in this laodicean age when
[1:21:06] satan has become the god of this civil
[1:21:08] age it's going to take more than a shout
[1:21:11] it's going to take more than a dance
[1:21:12] it's going to take more than emotion
[1:21:14] it's going to take the word in the
[1:21:16] church to defeat the devil and that word
[1:21:19] will defeat the devil anywhere anytime
[1:21:22] under any conditions amen see then what
[1:21:25] god needs amen as preachers amen in
[1:21:27] churches with spiritual courage who's
[1:21:30] got the word that's got the promise and
[1:21:32] it's got the power the father said see
[1:21:34] to press it out there and watch it come
[1:21:37] to pass amen david had the promise he
[1:21:40] had the word and he had the power listen
[1:21:42] david didn't know how that rock was
[1:21:44] going to find goliath's forehead amen
[1:21:46] but he knew if i'll just sling the
[1:21:47] slingshot
[1:21:49] come on if i'll just sling the slingshot
[1:21:51] amen that rock will go out there and
[1:21:53] it'll hit goliath right square in the
[1:21:55] head and david didn't know how it was
[1:21:57] going to happen but he just knew it was
[1:21:58] going to happen
[1:22:01] can i preach he knew it was going to
[1:22:03] happen so he stood there and he went to
[1:22:05] swing in that slingshot he went to swing
[1:22:07] in that slingshot and before long he let
[1:22:10] that rock go brother said f-a-i-t-h
[1:22:12] amen listen amen david didn't go down
[1:22:15] there and pick out the place for that
[1:22:17] rock to hit amen god had done
[1:22:19] predetermined
[1:22:22] can i preach to you like it's coming to
[1:22:24] me amen how come when saul or when
[1:22:26] goliath put on all that armor amen of
[1:22:28] all the places he could have put an arm
[1:22:30] or he should have made sure his head was
[1:22:31] covered amen but he left a little place
[1:22:33] open you know why amen because god knew
[1:22:36] he hulk
[1:22:37] god left that hole open for a rock to
[1:22:39] come in there and to kill that
[1:22:41] uncircumcised philistine and right here
[1:22:43] on a thursday night amen the devil's
[1:22:45] done everything he can to protect his
[1:22:47] old sorry hide amen from being exposed
[1:22:50] and from being exposed in this service

[1:23:10] somebody with the courage to push it out
[1:23:12] there and then i think it's amazing amen
[1:23:15] if this is okay to continue a few more
[1:23:17] minutes in the book of revelation one
[1:23:18] you'll find that john describes the
[1:23:21] sevenfold glory of the personage of
[1:23:23] jesus christ in the fourth fold he said

[1:23:28] waters which you know what waters
[1:23:30] represents it represents peoples

[1:23:34] prophet said his voice was as the sound
[1:23:37] of multitude speaking
[1:23:40] he said what are these it's judgment
[1:23:42] these are the voices of the multitudes
[1:23:46] of witnesses who by the holy spirit amen
[1:23:49] through the ages have testified to
[1:23:52] christ now listen to this and preached

[1:24:02] preachers who preach the saving power of
[1:24:04] jesus who preached water baptism in
[1:24:07] jesus name who preached the infilling
[1:24:10] and power of the holy ghost who stood
[1:24:12] with the word more than they stood with
[1:24:15] their own lives of all of them were the
[1:24:17] voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost
[1:24:20] down to the ages he said see now watch
[1:24:23] his voice his love his voice of love and
[1:24:26] care and guidance and protection was
[1:24:29] being declared
[1:24:30] through a voice of many waters he said
[1:24:32] oh if you would only see it's the waters
[1:24:34] that destroyed the world amen but it was
[1:24:37] the same waters that saved noah and also
[1:24:39] the same whole earth for noah listen to
[1:24:42] his voice the voice of his servants as
[1:24:45] he's called into repentance and to life
[1:24:47] many people want to get to life without
[1:24:49] going through repentance but the prophet
[1:24:51] said listen to the voice of his faithful
[1:24:54] servants as they call the repentance and
[1:24:55] then the life amen as you go on you'll
[1:24:58] find that the six fold amen i'm going
[1:25:00] somewhere of his personage was the
[1:25:02] two-edged sword right the prophet said
[1:25:04] like this i was up in sabino canyon and
[1:25:07] down came a sword it was a two-edged
[1:25:09] sword it was not a sword it was the king
[1:25:11] sword it was the word of the lord and
[1:25:14] the message that the patmos bishop he
[1:25:16] said out of his mouth amen watch this
[1:25:18] out of his mouth which where's his voice
[1:25:20] coming from his voice is coming from his
[1:25:23] mouth out of his mouth also goes amen a

[1:25:35] comes that word will come against all
[1:25:38] nations and all men and the word of god
[1:25:41] will show who did the will of god and
[1:25:43] who didn't it will make known the secret
[1:25:45] works of every man and while he did them
[1:25:48] it will divide asunder there won't be
[1:25:50] any respect before god all will be
[1:25:53] judged by the word no one escaping it
[1:25:56] they've been listening to me tonight

[1:26:04] world amen but there is a people who has
[1:26:06] heard the voice of many waters they have
[1:26:09] felt the sword come on amen let me say
[1:26:11] like this amen if you've got a pastor
[1:26:13] and i believe you do who is a man of god
[1:26:16] who preaches the word of god amen let me
[1:26:18] say this don't you think it's the man
[1:26:20] it's the word it's not the man it's the
[1:26:24] word
[1:26:25] he said how do you know that he is
[1:26:27] revealing the secrets of hearts and men
[1:26:29] in the age of which we're living who
[1:26:30] else can reveal the secrets but the word
[1:26:32] himself amen it is the same spirit that
[1:26:36] was in jesus the word that is present
[1:26:38] again in the church in the last stage as
[1:26:41] a last sign amen trying to head the
[1:26:44] people off from judgement for they that
[1:26:46] reject him the word are now already
[1:26:48] coming to a judgment amen crucified him
[1:26:51] afresh now paul said that the word came
[1:26:54] in power as well as voice right like a
[1:26:57] flaming cutting sword it went to the
[1:26:59] consciousness of men like a surgeon's
[1:27:02] knife and it cut out the diseases and
[1:27:05] set the captives free amen then when the
[1:27:07] world is drunk on the things of the
[1:27:09] world amen and they lost their sins in
[1:27:12] the spiritual things of god there is a
[1:27:14] fifo ministry who is running throughout
[1:27:16] the land with a sword in their mouth
[1:27:20] oh is this okay brother samuel with a
[1:27:22] sword in their mouth amen and right here

[1:27:27] the word is cutting your conscience free
[1:27:30] like a surge's knife amen see it's not
[1:27:33] the man the prophet says it's the word
[1:27:36] amen what did he say he said who did the
[1:27:38] word lord come to the prophet and god
[1:27:41] called the prophet because they had the
[1:27:43] word of god if a man has the word of god
[1:27:46] it's not the man it's the word that
[1:27:48] people's listening to it isn't the man
[1:27:51] it's the word see notice this if the
[1:27:54] prophets jeremiah isaiah elisha if they
[1:27:57] sent us saith the lord as long as the
[1:27:59] word was coming from them they were gods
[1:28:02] and god said himself he was the one that
[1:28:05] done the announcing because it wasn't
[1:28:07] man listen to this quote it wasn't man
[1:28:10] he took the man out and put himself in
[1:28:13] there to speak then it was not jeremiah
[1:28:15] announcing like a fire set up in my
[1:28:17] bones it was not elisha announcing amen
[1:28:20] a receiving of the double portion it was
[1:28:22] not ezekiel announcing amen that they'll
[1:28:25] be
[1:28:26] they'll be horseless carriages it was
[1:28:28] not those men the god of those men took
[1:28:31] those men out and placed himself in
[1:28:34] those men and when they spoke it was not
[1:28:37] the man it was the god of the man
[1:28:41] well don't leave it out there let's
[1:28:42] bring it to today when the prophet stood
[1:28:45] and said california's going under it was
[1:28:47] not a man amen he took the man out and
[1:28:50] he put himself in when he stood there
[1:28:52] and said amen this day this scripture is
[1:28:56] fulfilled it was not a man it was god
[1:28:59] who had taken possession of a man and
[1:29:01] let me go and bring it right here to
[1:29:03] spoken word tabernacle believer spoken
[1:29:05] word church let me bring it right here
[1:29:07] when a pastor stands behind the pulpit
[1:29:10] and begins to preach the word and says
[1:29:12] today is the day of salvation today is
[1:29:14] the day of redemption it's not the man
[1:29:17] the man is not here he has surrendered
[1:29:19] himself to god and god
[1:29:25] god has taken possession of the man it's
[1:29:28] not the man announcing it's god in the
[1:29:31] man announcing in other words there's a
[1:29:33] reason why god had to take the man out
[1:29:35] because this bride will not be
[1:29:37] manhandled
[1:29:40] oh
[1:29:40] god she will not be manhandled she will
[1:29:44] be a virgin word right
[1:29:48] the prophet said there'll be no
[1:29:50] denominational manhandling in the virgin
[1:29:53] birth of the bride she is commanded by
[1:29:56] god to come out of such and touch not
[1:29:59] their unclean things become not of their
[1:30:02] vultures

[1:30:05] five-fold ministry that would replay
[1:30:07] come on church amen you know why i had
[1:30:09] to send a prophet to each age it's
[1:30:11] because when they took things out of

[1:30:15] up with all kinds of deeds of
[1:30:16] nicolaitans all kinds of ideas amen when

[1:30:34] fall come by man as well he meant that
[1:30:36] if the church went into a poverty
[1:30:38] stricken condition by man he meant that
[1:30:40] i believe god can take another man and
[1:30:42] bring it out of the poverty stricken

[1:34:09] want to use it again i'm going somewhere

[1:34:22] season's over
[1:34:25] are you hearing me
[1:34:27] it's been there and it needs to be fixed
[1:34:28] so what you do is you call a handyman to
[1:34:30] come by and he starts working on the
[1:34:32] door and you know what you're watching
[1:34:34] him man two minutes he's got it fixed
[1:34:36] well in your mind you're thinking you
[1:34:38] know what that sink back here needs to
[1:34:39] be fixed too
[1:34:42] and that wall needs to be passed that
[1:34:44] plumbing needs to be repaired and we
[1:34:45] need to put with the light switch quit

[1:34:48] begin to say well while you're here
[1:34:53] would you mind to take a look at the
[1:34:54] sink
[1:34:55] and when you know that would you mind to
[1:34:57] take a look at this see what you're
[1:34:59] actually doing is you're pulling amen or

[1:35:09] that's too much to ask i really don't

[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:17] while you're here will you fix this and
[1:35:19] while you're here when you fix that see
[1:35:21] if we're not reserved ain't meant to
[1:35:23] pull in a natural gift then why do we
[1:35:25] become reserved to pull on a spiritual
[1:35:27] gift
[1:35:28] come on church amen what does it mean to
[1:35:31] pull amen listen this to pull means to
[1:35:33] exert force on someone or something
[1:35:37] it means to cause movement towards
[1:35:40] oneself
[1:35:41] it's to act as taking a hold of
[1:35:44] something and exhorting force to draw it
[1:35:47] towards one glory to god it means to
[1:35:50] force drawing someone or something into
[1:35:53] a particular direction or course of
[1:35:55] action then what he's saying is amen
[1:35:58] you've got the power he meant to pull on
[1:36:00] the natural gift because you want to get
[1:36:02] the full value amen then pull on the
[1:36:04] spiritual gift and get the full value
[1:36:07] out of that
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:09] let me let me i'm closing here listen
[1:36:11] the prophet said see wherefore he saith
[1:36:13] he sent a gifts led captivity captive
[1:36:15] and gave gifts unto me and romans 11 29
[1:36:18] for the gift somebody said the gifts and
[1:36:20] the callings of god are without
[1:36:21] repentance now listen to this word yes
[1:36:23] it means the grace or gifts denoting
[1:36:26] extraordinary powers distinguishing
[1:36:29] certain christians and enabling them to
[1:36:32] serve the church of christ the reception
[1:36:35] of which is due to the power of divine
[1:36:37] grace so in other words amen god has
[1:36:40] placed gifts in the body amen not to
[1:36:42] serve themselves amen but to serve the
[1:36:45] body of christ amen then let me say like
[1:36:47] this gifts of god are not earned amen
[1:36:49] gifts or god gifts of god are sent
[1:36:52] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:36:53] prophet john 1 there was a man sent from
[1:36:56] god the prophet said see he said now
[1:36:58] notice this he says watch god ordain
[1:37:01] these five offices god sent these amen
[1:37:03] why remember it's god's dress where in
[1:37:06] the church then when a true gift of god
[1:37:08] comes in the church it's not to edify
[1:37:10] the man it's to edify the church he said
[1:37:13] to bring the church to a living faith in
[1:37:16] jesus christ to the unity of the faith
[1:37:18] amen unto a perfect man that we be no
[1:37:20] more children toss to and fro he said
[1:37:22] see that the christian life should come
[1:37:24] to a stability then these gifts are not
[1:37:27] coming ain't meant to bind the church
[1:37:29] they're not coming to loose the church
[1:37:31] into worldliness they're coming to bring
[1:37:33] the church to a stability that he says
[1:37:35] we may grow up in him in all things what
[1:37:37] is all things all things is truth he
[1:37:40] said see now lord send your gifts which
[1:37:42] is secondary to all this that it might

[1:37:46] the church to bring us to a realization
[1:37:49] of your presence amen can i can i preach
[1:37:51] it for a second and we'll go home amen
[1:37:53] god sends a gift in the church amen a
[1:37:56] preacher amen a five-fold minister amen
[1:37:59] to bring a realization of the presence
[1:38:02] of god in the church amen the part of
[1:38:04] god says it like this in the presence of
[1:38:05] god unrecognized he says when he is not
[1:38:08] recognized amen that his power is not
[1:38:11] revealed when he is not recognized so

[1:40:26] him you reveal his power you release his
[1:40:29] anointing are you hearing me amen i'm
[1:40:31] going to close with this amen you
[1:40:33] realize there's three powers that's
[1:40:34] released when you recognize him i'm
[1:40:36] going to give him too quick from the
[1:40:37] scripture one amen is one with the
[1:40:39] infirmity who was bound over within
[1:40:41] herself
[1:40:45] can i buy five minutes
[1:40:48] she was bowed over then herself the
[1:40:50] bible says amen for 38 years she had
[1:40:53] been coming to church
[1:40:54] and i love this brother but one night it
[1:40:57] was a different service because the
[1:40:59] bible says jesus was actually teaching
[1:41:01] in the temple and she was sitting there
[1:41:04] bowed over if you go read christian
[1:41:05] history you will find that there was not
[1:41:08] one service she missed if anybody had an
[1:41:10] excuse not to be there it was that woman
[1:41:12] if anybody had an excuse amen not to
[1:41:15] show up and if they did show up if
[1:41:17] anybody had an excuse not to back the
[1:41:19] word it was that woman but okay brother
[1:41:22] samuel i read that one day and i about
[1:41:23] shouted my study down amen amen ancient
[1:41:26] history records that while jesus was
[1:41:29] teaching
[1:41:31] i gotta close amen let me just say this
[1:41:33] for people that gets all corporate
[1:41:35] people standing up when the preacher's
[1:41:36] preaching it actually happened a long
[1:41:37] time before we got here
[1:41:40] history records while jesus was teaching
[1:41:43] she recognized who was in the pulpit
[1:41:46] she recognized yeah that's the one they
[1:41:48] say amen is a man that's a crazy man
[1:41:51] it's the illegitimate child but she
[1:41:53] recognized brother that's a healer right
[1:41:55] there and the bible says she stood up
[1:41:58] and while he was teaching she said that
[1:42:00] ain't nothing but the truth
[1:42:02] she said that's the word lord and the
[1:42:04] bible says jesus turned and said woman
[1:42:07] thou art loosed and the prophet said
[1:42:09] what happened he said her genuine faith
[1:42:12] released
[1:42:13] his power to heal her can we go to the
[1:42:16] second one right quick it was a man
[1:42:17] named jairus amen his daughter was
[1:42:20] laying dead even but gyrus went out and
[1:42:22] he recognized who jesus was he was a
[1:42:25] secret believer but when he recognized
[1:42:27] who jesus was he come out of the closet
[1:42:30] and stepped out in full assurance this
[1:42:32] is a man of god this is god and the
[1:42:34] prophecy when jairus recognized
[1:42:38] when jairus recognized who he was it
[1:42:41] released his power of resurrection and a
[1:42:44] girl who was laying dead in the midst of
[1:42:46] the home was raised alive when one man
[1:42:50] recognized he is still the god that is
[1:42:53] able to raise the dead
[1:42:58] but here's one that blows my mind in
[1:43:00] closing
[1:43:02] it was the woman
[1:43:03] who washed jesus feet
[1:43:08] there was a gift in simon's house
[1:43:12] simon invited that gift in the house
[1:43:16] are you with me
[1:43:18] and put that gift in a corner
[1:43:27] and he's sitting in a corner and in
[1:43:30] walks a prostitute
[1:43:35] ian walks a prostitute and recognizes
[1:43:38] him
[1:43:42] he's in the corner everybody's ignoring
[1:43:44] him but she says that's him
[1:43:48] that's the one my mama told me
[1:43:50] met the woman at the whale
[1:43:54] oh god
[1:43:56] just around the menu will shout by
[1:43:57] ourselves that we have to that's the one
[1:44:00] that's the one that when they caught
[1:44:02] that woman in the act of adultery and
[1:44:04] they brought her before him to stoner
[1:44:06] that's the one that said you without
[1:44:08] seeing cast the first stone and they
[1:44:10] everyone dropped their stones she began
[1:44:12] and she's recognizing she's beginning to
[1:44:14] release something you know what the
[1:44:16] problem of god said she was releasing
[1:44:19] his power to forgive
[1:44:23] god have mercy
[1:44:25] she was releasing his power to forgive
[1:44:28] and the father said watch this he said
[1:44:30] she recognized his presence she released
[1:44:34] his power to forgive and notice this
[1:44:37] also
[1:44:38] she released the power of god to show to
[1:44:41] them unbelievers that he was a prophet
[1:44:44] for he knew who she was also release joy
[1:44:48] amen and power and eternal life oh god

[2:05:25] this testimony is on my heart i just
[2:05:27] feel to share it with you
[2:05:28] we're going to turn the service over
[2:05:31] i want you to know in these services
[2:05:34] when you're hearing the word
[2:05:37] and you speak out
[2:05:39] the lord hears you
[2:05:42] you hear me tonight
[2:05:44] the lord hears you
[2:05:46] what you say to him he hears
[2:05:50] brother brother samuel and i preached to
[2:05:52] youth camp a few years ago with brother
[2:05:54] mike walls
[2:05:56] i'd spoke that camp the year before
[2:05:59] and on friday night in the service
[2:06:01] while i was preaching the spirit lord
[2:06:02] was moving it was a good service
[2:06:04] people were pulling the work the young
[2:06:06] people was with me
[2:06:07] but all of a sudden there was a storm
[2:06:08] come in
[2:06:10] and lightning struck and the power went
[2:06:12] out in the building
[2:06:13] i think i've told you about that
[2:06:15] the power went out in the building and
[2:06:17] brother brian when the power went out
[2:06:18] that service went to another level
[2:06:21] it was like like at byc this year went
[2:06:23] to a whole new level and i honestly i
[2:06:25] thought
[2:06:27] wow
[2:06:28] we didn't stage that i mean when the
[2:06:30] power went out the people began to
[2:06:32] scream they were they were slinging
[2:06:34] chairs and dancing the aisles and
[2:06:35] hollering well
[2:06:37] brother when the power went out i mean
[2:06:39] lights everything out black dark nothing
[2:06:41] can't see nothing so i figured if the
[2:06:43] power went out then the microphone's not
[2:06:45] working
[2:06:46] so instead of just standing there
[2:06:47] holding the microphone brother i just
[2:06:49] laid it down
[2:06:49] [Music]
[2:06:54] the lights are out the power boards
[2:06:57] but the microphone still working
[2:07:00] i thought well i'm gonna pick that
[2:07:01] microphone up and i picked it up and
[2:07:03] these are the words i said sister
[2:07:04] browning god is still god
[2:07:07] his power is still here his word is
[2:07:10] still real and every devil is defeated
[2:07:13] amen brother when i said that that
[2:07:15] service would another level higher amen
[2:07:18] brother we weren't states in those
[2:07:19] things i left that meeting i went to
[2:07:21] africa and preached i traveled for for
[2:07:24] several years and you don't know the
[2:07:26] times i've set my office and thought
[2:07:28] what caused that to happen
[2:07:32] we didn't stage it
[2:07:33] right well the other day i got my answer
[2:07:36] i went out there to preach that camp
[2:07:38] again the other day and the brother put
[2:07:40] me on a golf cart to give me a ride and
[2:07:41] he said i need to give you a thanks
[2:07:43] i said well i appreciate it i appreciate
[2:07:44] you allowing me to come he said no do

[2:07:54] went out i said yes sir i do
[2:07:57] he said my daughter was sitting in the
[2:07:59] service
[2:08:01] thinking about leaving the church
[2:08:03] altogether

[2:08:24] next words see there's nothing to it

[2:18:26] spoken and he's challenged my life
[2:18:29] i love that
[2:18:31] amen how god comes down and he speaks so
[2:18:33] personally to our hearts and god was
[2:18:35] letting us know in this service that
[2:18:37] every service that it's not something we
[2:18:40] wonder about but we are the ones the
[2:18:43] reason god lays things on the heart
[2:18:45] causes things to go a certain way causes
[2:18:47] things
[2:18:48] i mean you know brother andrew you've
[2:18:50] been preaching for for a long time as
[2:18:52] well there's certain things that i look
[2:18:54] at sometimes when i can stand behind a
[2:18:55] pulpit sometimes whether it's here i
[2:18:57] feel like things hasn't even come
[2:18:59] together other times i've been places
[2:19:01] and i've had things laying right before
[2:19:02] me had an ipad had a steno pad and had
[2:19:05] everything laying before me and i get up
[2:19:07] there to start preaching and i don't use
[2:19:09] none of it right
[2:19:11] why because it's
[2:19:13] what is determined is based on the needs
[2:19:16] of the hearts of the people
[2:19:18] i want you to think of this every one of
[2:19:20] us in here every one of us including me
[2:19:22] when i set out there when brother andrew
[2:19:24] walked up here tonight
[2:19:25] my prayer was is god help him to be
[2:19:28] sensitive
[2:19:29] to what we have need of
[2:19:31] is that your prayer when a man of god
[2:19:33] comes across the platform
[2:19:35] then i think it ought to be the request
[2:19:37] that we would say my request would be to
[2:19:39] you is is god help me to be sensitive
[2:19:42] amen help me to be sensitive heading
[2:19:45] into that service help me to be
[2:19:46] sensitive lord when i'm sitting there
[2:19:48] and i'm hearing the word if we can get
[2:19:50] together on that and agree on that right
[2:19:52] there i'll tell you what there are some
[2:19:53] things that god will really begin to do
[2:19:57] he's being sensitive because
[2:20:00] it's not the preacher that packs it
[2:20:03] it's a work that goes on between
[2:20:05] you know brother brown said it like this
[2:20:06] in spiritual food and due season
[2:20:10] he said what it is he said there's a
[2:20:12] gift in you to believe
[2:20:14] there's a gift he said in me he said
[2:20:16] that god is placed there and he said
[2:20:18] what happens between those two gifts
[2:20:20] it's a channel
[2:20:22] and he said but in that channel that's
[2:20:24] where the secret food
[2:20:26] is at
[2:20:28] so the spiritual food in due season is
[2:20:30] that secret channel that's between the
[2:20:32] gift in a believer and the gift that god
[2:20:35] is using right there in the pulpit to be
[2:20:37] able to recognize it's not the man but
[2:20:40] it's god
[2:20:42] amen and god's speaking to our needs i'm
[2:20:44] glad that god i'm glad that god can
[2:20:46] choose different complexions to stand
[2:20:48] here in
[2:20:50] different statures whether they're wide
[2:20:52] or bubbly or thin or tall
[2:20:54] bald or have hair i'm glad god uses all
[2:20:57] sorts because what he's using isn't the
[2:20:59] frame of the man he's using the gift he
[2:21:01] put in there
[2:21:03] and i'm grateful that by the grace of
[2:21:05] god we're able to look past the frame
[2:21:06] look past everything else and hear his
[2:21:08] voice and recognize it's him i tell you
[2:21:10] what there's strength there's help
[2:21:12] there's liberty amen for each of our
[2:21:14] lives i'll tell you my goodness here i
[2:21:17] just i know that without a shadow of a
[2:21:19] doubt before we even started this
[2:21:20] service tonight god had arranged it and
[2:21:23] i can say amen to that tonight amen can
