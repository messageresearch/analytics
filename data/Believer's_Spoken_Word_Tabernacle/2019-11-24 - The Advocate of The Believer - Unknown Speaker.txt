TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and he is the propitiation for our sins would perpetuation is one who Proficio eighths or the atoning one the atonement so he is I want you to this is careful here he is not was is is is his present tense he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to take that thought this morning and we'll just see where the Lord lets us get to sometimes it's so hard well we'll just we'll see how the Lord lets us go within this here but I'd like to speak to you this morning on the advocate of the believer and and we've been dealing with the promise of the father what is the Holy Ghost and brother Branham would would take this in the message what is the Holy Ghost and this when he's just going through and laying down what the Holy Ghost is and he takes this and and he deals with this just for a little just for a little bit and I believe that as the Spirit of God would make it real to our hearts because we realized that with the light that has come upon the word in the hour that we're living it is not the light of man's understanding but it is the light of God coming up on the word that's needed for us in this hour in order for that translation to take place because God's desire within our life this is a promise he said will I find faith when I returned to the earth now he wasn't looking you know for churches even though we thank God for churches but to recognize that he he was looking for faith it would be that faith that even Jude would would write about the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that were to contend for that faith and that faith is not is not the the faith of a man or a man but that's the faith of God moving in man and so that's what it is that when we can recognize that that when we look at even Abraham and Sarah and see and we find this in the scripture it all goes back and forth through the scripture that of how God will deal with one to an age and God makes himself known then that one comes and ministers by the faith of God that promise over the people of God and the people of God then rising in that faith and then it becomes the same faith that has moved through the messenger carrying the message from the throne of God then the people of God operate by that same faith to fulfill what the message has called for so it is not if I could say it like this it is not us as the people who are fulfilling the word it is Christ in us fulfilling what he already said and what he has already laid out in his mind this is not a script that is good that has been wrote where there are editing marks now where there's things oh well we may be needed to rethink this or we need to know this has already been from the mind of God before it ever came into print it was already in God's mind the the Bible clearly declares in in the book of Peter that that there were holy men of old it wasn't that their flesh was holy but the Bible says there were holy men of old and holy mean that they were separated unto God they were separated from their thoughts from thinking matter of fact they were so separated that they they were so on that they spoke as God for even when the Elijah would say it will not not rain or Dew will fall from the sky until I call for it he spoke as God why because he was living in the presence of Almighty God to where God was able to move and to take over the faculties of Elijah as a type of what God would do in Christ and what God does in the believer hi mama mama I tell you I just feel good you see when we look at this the situation when you you you think of that with Elijah and Elijah look the humanity was still there so you and I could relate to it but yet when Elijah and Elijah both come to situations where there is death before them we see the miracles that were done but let's look at the dead babies there was that in Elijah's day there was that in Elijah's day so there was that of a child that needed to be raised to life and and both of them in in separate instances they did not know what to do in that moment but they knew this is what's important they knew that the Lord Jesus the one who had spoke to them Almighty God they knew he was the answer and so when they came into the room remember in I just closed the door behind him Elijah did the same thing they and they begin to move around upon the floor then the inspiration struck of what was already laying there in their in their bosom and they went and laid themselves up all the child Elijah laid himself upon the child nose-to-nose mouth to mouth everything was right on and and and he was the Spirit of God that moved that brought death to life and you and you look at it in this hour listen now it was not Elijah that raised up that man but Elijah was one who was yielded to the Spirit of God and God took over Elijah in that moment and that's the same way in enlasa you see Elijah had an example of how that God could so take over a man like Elijah - wherein Elijah would make the same request he said I want a double portion of that spirit he desired what I want to be fully taken over in my life like God took Elijah over and a situation presented itself death was present Elijah didn't know what to do but he walked and he gave himself to the Lord and here he moves upon that child and notice then when he when he moves upon that child then that child that was dead it comes back to life why because unless you surrendered himself to God and it was God that brought Deborah life where there was death and I said just like this that's exactly what the baptism of the Holy Ghost it does and is in the life of a believer he deals with the life calling a life in justification what's in dirt he's starting to take over he calls it in sanctification he's taken over he moves to the baptism of the Holy Ghost where he sets down on the throne of your heart and he has fully taken over you are no longer your own you realize I've been bought with a price I'm not my own I belong to him I'm certainly not going to ask you because every one of us can identify with this we all not only have been maybe some are maybe some will be where Elijah and Elijah were where there were needs that are present and you don't know what to do but this is what I want you to take from this here they closed the door behind them there's times you got to shut everything not just times you got to shut everything of the world out sometimes you know it'd be easy just to close the door and shut everybody else out but really everybody else ain't the problem it's our mind if we could somehow get in there and go and just turn it off like that you know I mean if we had like pocket doors closing that's really the shutting away and you see God he makes a way for you and I that that you and I as we come into those times we come into tests we come in to try we don't know what to do in those times but here's what is important is that you know in whom you have believed you know that he is the one that's got a hold of your life it's not so much you've got a hold of him he's got a hold of you and you're aware that there is one in the ship that is here in my time of need I may not know what to do right now but the answer is already here well what's the answer it's here because the answer is not just something out here the answer is the person of Jesus Christ amen so when we look at this here my goodness I tell you what man well listen you know that that was all free the believers advocate the advocate of the believer you know to think of this for you and I that that we have an advocate and I I just pray that God will help us to be able to bring this to a place this morning and I I don't want to keep you here all day and I know some of you may disagree with that you might think I like keeping you here all day but I don't want to do that I want you to get what needs to be got today and if we got to come with we got to continue on we'll do it on another time but but here's the thing the Bible is clear within this word advocate what I want you to understand and I know you do as Bible readers but the word advocate is the promise that Jesus made when he was here he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you again but he did not come back to them in a physical form we know he raised from the grave he walked around here but yet then he ascended to the throne of God to the mercy seat and he now comes back in the form of the Holy Ghost the same God that dwelt within that life and that body he said I will come to you I will not leave you comfortless in other words I won't leave you as orphans you're not going to understand what's going on Ben right now but you will understand it in time and it'll be important that you understand it then because it will work that faith will operate within your life not when when we when we when we look at this the word advocate itself jesus said that I will send the comforter unto you the same word comforter is the same word advocate they are the exact same words so now notice John I want you to watch here I've got to lay this sin in it in here today because it's important to see this right here it says my children these things write unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so the word advocate here is that of Parakletos which is comforter it's one who is summons to the side that has come to once a to plead our cause now I don't want you to get confused with plead as though somebody is beggin it's not a beggin Jesus didn't beg the pleading is to have what is needed and necessary in order to satisfy the requirements that have been made so he has what is he himself what is needed in order to plead our case oh my and he stands and as is there to intercede on our behalf now when we think of this you know you know no doubt for many of us we have examples of people and I'm not monk now on the on the general level who would stand in as advocates on our behalf we have things you know that I remember when things would take place in in and in the school setting well you know when when something had been done testing or whatever more and a student would require some other services some of the teachers and different ones know that sister Nita different ones that's been involved with that you you have people that come on board when you meet with the principal and everybody else and you as the teacher you've got parents there but you see the parents and the students don't know what their rights are they don't know what what it actually belongs to them but there is an advocate who is trained this is what they do for a living they are trained they know the laws they also know what accommodations should be given for that student or for that child it's just like with your Union stewards and you know forgive me I don't want to take you to work right now but you know you should have and we understand that door don't try to get all caught up in that thing well I need a different unions to her just just just bear with me a moment I'm just trying to give an example a union steward somebody who would actually be there to represent you who actually is there and and Antanas blue-lipped with the administration and what's taking place they know the things that are given to you they know of the rights that are given to you and and that in itself is here just on a or just on a small level you know an advocate I think of where you know with certain things that would take place in school there's things you know about it that a teacher not knowing they can say well this child is going to stay after at this time or whatever more but when certain things fall certain degrees get into documentation there they're there you cannot do that because they must be able to be on transportation going on the way home you what it is it's rights that's given to them so you can't say I'm holding you after school there are rights that are given by that document that ties them in to the federal government and that advocate can stand there and if somebody overrides it and I'll tell you what then next morning in the principal's office and that teachers gonna be down there as well they're the advocate that represents that child is going to be there the child does not have to be in that meeting the advocate is the one who stands there for what the child where the wrong has been done the advocate stands there let me just tell you something Jesus Christ the righteous is not there challenging their the Father but to understand his blood stands there as a witness to the devil to the accuser that the pardon has already been paid and what you are trying to accuse them of the pardon has already went forward and I'm standing here as their advocate there is blood on the mercy seat [Applause] [Music] hallelujah he becomes our advocate oh my I love this scripture here and in lamentations 3 here you find that Jeremiah moved by inspiration and he all the way through lamentations here he is praying and how the greatness was of Jerusalem and how they fell and they went into bondage they went into captivity and the city that was once full of joy is now full of desolation and and Jeremiah is recounting all this but him but he gets to about the middle of chapter 3 Jeremiah begins to be moved by the Spirit of God to forget not his tender mercies he begins to write under inspiration his mercies are new every morning you see God cannot forget his word he's not altering and there's nothing that you and I can do there's nothing that can be done to make our acceptable but there's only one in whom that we can be accepted in and that's in the beloved so the notice how that I love this in verse 57 it says thou drew us near in the day that I called upon thee thou settest oh my I feel like preaching thou set us fear not to my very men think about this here when the call was made to remind know what's here my is standing in has one that's representing on behalf of Israel and he's making that request he is actually taking upon and weeping you know we call Jeremiah the weeping prophet he is weeping but remember it is not a man's emotions that is weeping it is the Spirit of Christ inside of Jeremiah that is weeping and is recalling that word and here's your Maya he says when I begin to pray you know the Bible says that he says that when he says you shall begin to seek me you shall begin to hearken unto me and when you begin to cuddle me in prayer I will hear your prayer amen when you begin to seek me with your whole heart I will be found of you I'll tell you right now friends it's it's one thing we can come to church and I I believe that this is a place that that we need to find relief we need to find rest we need to find help we need to find strength but I just want to also that we would be very mindful that God desires more than just to give us temporary relief he wants to give rest Savio's he wants to give rest to our soul to wear that with inside in our life there is a rest and and too so so position us to where our faith is resting in him amen at times that's where that we need that of the word that's why listen to me this is why you would find word brother Branham dealing with different one's in the message and I think you know what you find it in different place in a message but I think I've even brother Welch Evans coming to him and you know brother Welch questioning whether he had the Holy Ghost or not and he said brother branham he said I never got it straight until I heard you teach on Hebrews 10 he said and when you've made that declaration that that the worshipper once purged has no more desire of sin he said then I seen it the experience of passing from death unto life so our experience is a word experience in order be to God aren't you glad for that because look that how else can we have faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God so it's got to be a faith that's resting in the Word of God and we rest in the word and God makes his word alive and makes it real he makes it sure to us personally oh my momma I think I just feel like preaching you say what are you doing well I don't know I'm trying to verse 57 thou drew us near I love that the Bible said in the book of James draw nigh unto God and He will draw not unto you well let's just preach on sons and daughters right now here is Israel all the way through the Old Testament prophecies I just love it you find of how here they are scattered all around throughout all the places and they've been scattered because of unbelief oh my you see what unbelief does it scatters it break it breaks unity but when God begins to move by his promise in order to bring things back in harmony with his word God takes that which is scattered by unbelief but my belief in his word God brings unity it begins to bring things back together like he could say in Isaiah 43 it says I would say to the north give up my sons I say to the south give up my daughters I say to the east say to the list notice God is calling it it is supernatural that sounding of God's trumpet voice that calls Israel back in her homeland and it's the same way with you and I it is the supernatural sounding of the voice of Almighty God that says to the North give up my sons to the South give up my daughters to they east and to the west we have not been assembled here but that of man I tell you ought to put that right in the devil States right now this morning you are not here by the call of man you're not here by accident you are here by coordination of Almighty God and God has called to your heart hallelu but 7 you don't know take that word and put it in his face now drew us near in the day that I call upon thee whoo it's like the prodigal down there he had he had all types of stuff all over him but you know what he began to draw near he smelt like a massive look like a mess but he began to draw near he was drawing near you remember drum man to God he'll draw nigh to you the Bible said that he said fear not oh my so there's a reason there's a reason I can say fear not in verse 58 oh look how this is capital L lowercase o lowercase R lowercase D adenine Oh Lord thou has pleaded the calls of my soul this word is used in relation to humanity Oh Lord thou has pleaded the causes of my soul thou has redeemed my life redemption is not according to how that man's mind has wanted now to conceive it and I don't want to say that they concede that that way down through the ages but it has slowly been lost the real reality of what true predestination is all about predestination is not that well I was a sinner on my way to hell but you know Jesus just had pity and mercy and he just hoped that I would turn around brother that's a reckless program that is not Redemption Redemption is coming to claim and bring back what always bound to you we were not we were not pigs become sheep we were always sheep but we had to have the quickening power to come upon our lives that would change us and move away that old nature that the real sheep and lamb of God on the inside to come up who can do that but V Lamb of God the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our soul oh my that has redeemed my life oh ma that's not an option that is essential that is essential in our life see this is what it comes down to the ministering of the gospel is preaching the rights that belong to us as believers you're not you're not willing I get good enough no sonship and as the Sun and as a daughter what is ministered to us is what belongs to us it was always ours it was ours clear from before the foundation of the world but remember there has been a robbery that took place there was unbelief that came in they went there we were sold out into sin we were represented by one madam come on Romans five but now there had to be one come around and represent us in righteousness in order to bring us back to where that we had fallen from and ministered to us our rights this is what the advocate does the Holy Ghost the spirit of sent back into the Church of the Living car to continue this work in ministers to you and I are rats you could be setting here this morning and you might have you know your understanding of healing well I'm just going to suffer for the glory of God but the advocate comes and lets you know that by my stripes you are healed the advocate lets you know I am the lord that healers all that diseases they advocate lets you know that I desire that you would be in health and prosper even as thy soul does prosper this is what the advocate does it comes to minister to you and I where the enemy wants to rob and steal and take away the privileges but the living Lord Jesus Christ he comes and lets us know as a son and daughter of God you're living beneath your privileges you need to rise up and you need to take what belongs to you and the first thing he has to tell us is fear not mother lujah that's the first words john heard on the Isle of Patmos fear not jump said I fell at his feet as dead what the words come fear not I am he that was dead in him alive forevermore and I've got the keys hey men I am the victory amen he stood right there and he ministers to John as the prophet would say it left courage and ability I love it those three orders love because without left there could be no faith left produces faith not cast out fear so must be left that's the order its wrote in Ezra minute love courage and ability that's what the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ he comes to minister how can he do that because he is speaking to his sons and his daughters that is the promise from the Old Testament politics enough in Hebrews to that I will sing and declare thy name in the midst of the church in the midst of my brethren will i exalt that name o God they meant to lift up the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in that name amen every devil is defeated in that name every devil has to turn lose it's in that name that they shall heal the sin in my name they shall cast out devils it is that name that manifestation of the very life of Almighty God it is what brings prevailing power to the Church of the Living God what is it the name of God it is all hallelujah it's the name of God that removes your reproach it's the name of God that removes blaspheming where the name has been blaspheme but when he comes brother he manifests his name it takes away all of the blasphemous accusations and all of their approach why he is calling you by his name whoo I feel like preaching oh you say brother Sam you just a nut hey this is what brings me joy I don't act no different at home than what I act here now that I'm not saying you got to act like maybe that's just my peculiarities if you're embarrassed with me just close your eyes and say thank you Jesus for your word but this is my life this is my joy amen it's my joy to look in upon these things because it is personal to you and I notice this my verse 59 o Lord thou has seen my wrong judge Val my cause notice Lord capital L capital o capital R capital D Jehovah you hold the self-existing one one who now remember as he reveals himself one who exists not with his family he who is his family are you with me when God thought of becoming tangible hallelujah he thought when he started becoming tangible he thought of you and me he wanted to have fellowship he wanted to have fellowship remember Adam could not have fellowship with all the other living creatures that were there no doubt it was nice to pet the horse or the lion's mane or whatever more but he could not have fellowship with those animals but there had to be one of his own kind one that he could have fellowship one that he could have communion with one that he could share his own life in his own substance one that could walk walk in that place with him you see the Lord Jesus has longed and waited for the time to come back as sons and daughters of God coming back into fellowship with says his children and he is loaned for the day when there is that uniting when this veil of flesh is finally dropped from our lives and we step from this mortality into that immortality he's made away he's made away for all of it he's got everything planned out so Oh Lord notice here on that verse 58 once again Oh Lord thou has pleaded the causes of my soul aren't you glad he done that for you thou hast redeemed my life Oh Lord thou has seen my wrong judge now my call so he didn't ignore the wrong but remember there was a plea that came up here's the wrong there is a plea that came up and there is the One God coming down and becoming kinsmen in order to bring the plea that was needed to satisfy what guilt was against us the Bible would say like this I want to lay these scriptures in and I don't want to run through but I want to get through it in Hebrews 7 verse 25 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them oh my you're not powerful that scripture is that the Bible would say and in another place in the book of Romans that while we were yet sinners Christ loved us and died for us he meant minhwan we were yet sinners we were ungodly there was nothing about us as far as what could be seen that actually could be lovable but God knew that there is a love that needs to be dispensed and when that love is dispensed I'm talking about his life the love of God is the Holy Ghost when that is dispensed into that life it will raise up a son and daughter of God they're down there beneath all the mud in the that's packed in them there down beneath that part there down beneath that water of humanity but when the light has come it begins to move up that pond Lily what's it do it it's pressing it's pressing where is it getting the strength it's getting the strength from one that is above it that is generating the power that's needed in order to come above the waters hallelujah though this world has failed we've all sinned and it's in the Bible says that the waters are the thickness and multitudes of people and spirits are permeating everywhere but the mercy of all muddy cult to move down and draw us to himself he ever liveth let me just say maybe there's one here or streaming or we'll hear this you might have been one who've been in and out in and out let me just tell you something I may give you the direct words the messenger brought us in this hour he said he sets there to sympathize with you he said you go he said back and forth he said but he stays there for you and what he does he invites you to come back are you with me not just where temporary relief you see he's holding there for you and I and that sympathizing with us listen to me now that isn't that in well you know how long is that going to be I don't know God's only obligated to give every person one opportunity so to see that he ever liveth to make intercession he's there to move upon on the behalf of that word let me just say something there could have been a son and daughter of God they could be in and out and in and out for years when I'm just gonna preach but I'll tell you this right here the Bible says he ever liveth to make intercession if they belong to him they're a son and daughter of God brother he ain't leavin hook behind he ain't gonna altar and say hey you know what I made one too many wedding garments hey you know what change the name tag on that plate right there we need to move that no sir that name is already there that name is a matter of fact he's already redeemed to the Holy Ghost makes real to you the redemption of the Lord Jesus Christ he lets you know your place is secure it's always been secured how no wonder David can say I'm just gonna follow this no wonder David could say that in the presence of mine enemy he had prepared a table for me he half a nut in my head with oil and my cup runneth over let me tell you something you are not going to a wedding as a guest you are part of the wedding you're not sitting at a guest table your seat has already been reserved [Applause] gourry the mother of the sons of thunder Zebedee she asked him she said yeah I would like you to grant my sons to sit on that rock and all that left and Jesus said he asked him he said are you able to drink that which huh and that ties with they said we are he said you shall be he said but that place to give it's not mine it's already been given it's already been given but the Holy Ghost goes to call us to recognize our position we're not acting like the Queen of Heaven because we got a title it is the life within us that lets everybody else know that this is his pride how she conducts herself the life that she lives is not because I want to sit there at that place it's because the reality of that position has moved into our hearts that's why we do what we do hallelujah Oh glory be to God verse 26 for such an high priest became us now Paul's talking about this Melchizedek that's such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh man high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was sense the law maketh the son who is consecrated forevermore so according then to the word now the word of the old God swore by an oath is that right God and it think how Paul would write that I love that Paul would write by inspiration of the Spirit of God God willing God willing desiring with the colours to show the Bible says to show the immutability of his counsel confirmed it with an oath I want you to catch this right here I'll tell you about how to spell the other day I was going through and going through that right there and my lord have mercy you know the sake of it the God look at this God didn't even have to do even utter another word what he has said he will perform but God wanted to show the immune ability of his counsel he confirmed what he said he swore by one there is nobody greater than himself he swore I will perform this so who is that it is God coming down the high priest I'm not canceling he came down and took upon a robe of flesh that's what the Bible could say that milk is acidic was made like unto the Son of God he was not the son of God he was made like unto the son of God but he had to become born of a woman why the Bible tells us in the book of Galatians that when we were we were shut up we were under bondage but he came in the fullness of time Jenna Galatians 4 he came in the fullness of time born of a woman that he might redeem them that were under the law is that right this is the coming it's a coming of the Lord moving in here verse 9 very bruised 9 24 for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands Moses Tabernacle Moses made that off a pattern is that right Solomon he made that off the pattern that the Spirit had given to David and David communicated the pattern by the spirit under Solomon so here he's entered into heaven itself this is not a type this is the fulfillment of that now to appear in the presence of God for us what are we talking about I'm talking about the Advocate he's there because the Bible tells us in Revelations 12 it talks about how that Satan is the accuser of the Brethren hmm I'm not wanting to let all this fly this morning because I know it welcome but God has a way and has dismantled the accusations of the enemy in revelations chapter 5 he has no voice are you with me he hatched no voice he's given no audience revelations 5 he's given no audience what the lamb has come in full view full pardon has returned to the Church of the Living God you know what it says it don't mean that he ain't trying to accuse but what it shows you're not God is not there's not even a voice that can even reach the throne of God are you with me it shows you the reality of the place that you and I are at and that's necessary for translation faith we maybe have to sit on that one right there but to appear in the presence of God when that accuser right now the Bible says he's the accuser of the brother when he comes up and he wants to accuse here is one seated that is there as the price that's been paid and there is a connection inside of you that connects you with your sacrifice there remember you did not come to him he came to you and he said fear not the first watch fear not why fear will try to paralyze you fear will try to keep you back fear will tell you you're not worthy but he said fear not that's the first words he utters when he comes out on Resurrection morning when the rising of the Sun fear not and that's a saint listen to me now that's the same way this resurrected Lord Jesus Christ the Living God rat here among us brother why he's taking his word he is ministering to sons and daughters of God he's letting you know that it was not you seeking after him I sought you out you always belong to me and he draws us to him and gives us of his right what is that it's casting out here because you're looking at it well I don't know like in a little Christian life you know I've always tried this and every time I try I fail he comes and says fear not if you look at yourself you've got reason to fear cause that ain't nothing in you or me I don't care how good you are there is nothing good there is one good and that is God he came to us and said fear not well that tradition I tried that fear not I don't even feel like I'm preaching I feel like I'm making an announcement this morning hallelu cheering every hold and every devil of unbelief and speaking to sons and daughters of God and say it fear not it is your soul crying out it was the soul I believe when Legion where he was bound he cried out and Jesus crossed the sea because he heard the cry of one Jesus will take a service like this that here you know I don't know which way I'm gonna go and he'll directed why cause he's still the same Lord Jesus that will tell you fear not Oh hallelujah he's appearing in the presence of God for us let me just have just a little bit more time I didn't say how much a little bit was but I want a little bit nor yet that he should offer himself often he don't have to keep on offering himself over and over again that would speak of the lack of perfection as the high priest entered into the holy place every year with blood of others and I remember that high priest the Old Testament he would enter in once a year showing that it's one sufficient offering there is one offering there is one Passover one atonement amen for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world I tell you man you catching this Benny must have have suffered since the foundation of the world the fall listen the fall didn't catch God by surprise the Bible says in Revelation 13:8 the lamb was slain before the foundation of the already the remedy was given before there ever was a sin problem the answer and the remedy the antidote was already given [Applause] no wonder Paul could do a little praise because Romans late and he could talk about whoever that he had called he had predestinated he had called he had justified he had already glorified it's a finished work before the foundation of the world and names were wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life this was not the church broader this is God's mind the lines of God's mind what security what does it show this is the fulfillment what was in God's mind I'm had to preach a little more he satisfied the requirement he met what God had called for in his mind where the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world listen to me Isaiah 53 Isaiah was caught up out of his senses and Isaiah records it not in a future happening he was bruised past tense for our iniquities he was wounded for our transgressions by His stripes we were healed at Jesus was the manifestation of that perfect Lamb of God and when that was met then that same life God's all in the eyes now comes back to the worshiper to bring us into that perfection when we have been chosen before him in what's happened here the laundry tickets have come together what was once dirty laundry that has been a match that was made and instead of it being dirty laundry it releases the real cleansing we might need to play a song and then keep home hmm but now once let me read that first part again for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but he is the perfect sacrifice but now once in the end of the world you said it went on for over 2,000 years but it's the end he said it is finished he's gathering his subjects under the finished atoning work of his own blood this is what Jesus ministered a time repent John repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand right they weren't playing with words and hand it means now comes the visitation it can come on for years but here is the working of it he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself Oh my Hall Jesus Hebrews 12 24 and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant not a pope not a pastor not a prophet but a prophet listen to me now I want to make this clear a prophet is the direct is a spokesman for Almighty God he is carrying a message from the throne of God revelations 1 vs. 4 vs. 5 and peace be unto you from Jesus Christ the Prince of the kings of the earth come on now and the seven stars that are in his right hand see it's a ministry of the finished work tying us back in to our inheritance the word comes as the trumpet to call us back to through the path of the word back into our inheritance and Jesus the mediator the one to go between oh lord thou has pleaded our cause he is the mediator one who has intervened Jesus is not the second person of the Godhead it is God become flesh for such a high priest became us no other man could do this nobody it was worthy Moses wasn't worthy it'll agile and were the great men of God but none of them were wising to do what God love could do hey man there had to come a blood that was not polluted they had to come one that would be able to separate us go glory be to God hallelujah and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of a war remember Abel's blood Abel was righteous Abel listen to me now Oh glory even though Abel here he was he come through and by you know an act of Adam and Eve but listen to me now Abel the Bible said was righteous one made in righteous because the revelation that came to Abel directed him to the lamb and Abel came and brought a lamb and Abel offered life blood life that was in his stead he was not righteous because he was able but he the Bible said he obtained a witness that he was righteous when able begin to offer up that sacrifice brother joy the Holy Ghost came found upon that sacrifice in United evil with his sacrifice and God was not looking at Abel he was looking at the sacrifice the sacrifice was crying out righteous righteous righteous that's why the power of divine revelation the Holy Ghost comes upon that word and he it speaks hallelujah and when Abel King rose up he got jealous about that he smote Abel Abel's blood cried out and Abel's blood came right out and said Cain is guilty God said I'm here in his blood you see the blood of Abel could not do anything for King it could only condemn him it could only tell him he was wrong you see just the blood of a man who was born in sin he could only condemn right because it's condemned already but the blood of Jesus now we're talking something different now we're talking about the answer now we're talking about the remedy now we're talking about settling the sin question so much so that the Prophet could stand in the message token and he said your pain if you stood against this word he said if you haven't believed he sent me tell you the blood of Abel would condemn you he said that you old Cain the blood of Jesus Christ can take you and change you Wow because inside of Cain is Abel let me say it again inside a keg is Abel and when Abel receives the witness of life Abell expresses he's able are you with me it's an advocate that's expressing in our lives are you with me only the brother of Jesus can bring about a change and the other blood condemns but we have been brought back brought back by the blood of Jesus Christ back into the state of innocence II as much as brother Branham would stand there I believe it's in the message standing in the gap and here he could talk about dedicating a child he said do you realize he said like this first he said that when you had been born of the Spirit of God and brought under the blood of Jesus Christ he said you're his innocent he said no let me correct that he said you are more innocent than a baby why because we're looking at the blood I said we're looking at the blood that's why when Jesus you know here this would be known in the Old Testament and it would be known in the Old Testament or Worthen but they would say well he whoever is born as a bastard child they cannot enter the congregation onto 400 years is that right they couldn't even come in that way because you see there wasn't a blood strong enough you know I'm quoting there was not a blood strong enough that could take care of that sin what was that showing that was a type to show that no animal blood it was all for nomads house it was required to be perfect it was required to be spotless but there is no bad that could bring us in to the sanctuary of God there was only one blood that could actually bring you back into the sanctuary of God back into the house of God back into what we are sons and daughters of God he will take the blood of Jesus Christ you might have been born a bastard child but there can be things all the way down your family and in your family tree but let me just tell you something you can take every single thing and you can tie it all up and wrap it all up and the blood of Jesus Christ has already town for it the blood of Jesus speaketh better things glory let me just have just a few more moments right don't you say already said that you're grinning like a possum these lemons let's get to this point here because this is very very very important and even as we are looking more into this the advocate of the believer and we'll go into this Lord willing next week when it came time for them to leave Egypt God let him know in Exodus 12 that this is going to be the beginning of months for you this is going to be a new beginning well who's the one that determines a new beginning him he's the one that determines the new beginning not talking about turning over a new leaf he's the one that brings a new creation he's the one that brings new birth he's the one that brings new life hallelujah he let him know this gonna be a new beginning and what did he tell him to do he said take a lamb and I want you to slay this win and I want you to take the blood and I want you to smite this to side post and I want you to smite that over-the-door you see his ad he let it be known I don't want you don't put it on the threshold because we're not to trample the blood of Jesus you don't walk on this blood you come under his blood you come free his blood you're not walking off for his blood brother William we walked through his blood brother just wait when they went through the Red Sea guess what the side post was right there they were walking through the side post and guess what he was over Egypt they had to walk out the door under the blood they didn't roll out a window that be a thief and a robber had to come through the door coming under the leadership of the Holy Spirit the Shepherd is the dog and my sheep hear my voice I know them by me her new you hallelujah glory and God said I'm gonna pass through Egypt this night I'm gonna smite all the firstborn I'm gonna execute judgment upon the highest of highs I'm gonna execute I'm gonna execute judgment on every one of their gods their gods at all of Egypt has been resting in and hoping in and trusting in I'm gonna execute judgement my wrath is gonna be poured out but here's the mercy of God aren't you glad for God's mercy you see that many way I'm not gonna preach at the mercy of God so many times how in situations that look so bleak and the mercy of God stepped right in it was a mercy of God that they were not consumed but you see God will never consume the righteous with the unrighteous you say they were not even under the blood yet but God was looking from his word when he sent His Prophet with the word he already know who would come under the blood he sent that message for them thy seed shall sojourn for 400 years God don't forget one of his promises you hear me I said God don't forget one of his promises we might get weary enough but doc don't forgive one of his promises but saying I did practice on praying hallelujah - let him renew and strengthen your faith this is what he said he said when I see the Blood I will pass over you the blood being under the blood was a representation that death has already come to this house one has died for all who are in in it one has died blood was there now watch this the focus and I the focus and I want you to get this the focus is upon the sacrifice the innocent lamb - the blood - the life on the lam the innocency of the lamb right God didn't habitants listen to me God did not have them inspect that lamb wondering if they would find fault are you hearing me he was not having them inspect that lamb just so that they would become knowledgeable what he wanted to do he wanted them to see how he was going to see dead that's why he said I want you to examine this lamb I want you to see every spot of it I want you to look at everywhere to let that deaf who could ever come and try to present something there's a spot here or a spot there you can say your it has been examined it has been what what what has made it accepted the word the word has said it has met the requirements and if he has met the requirements and has coming you then you are right we advocate I said we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous must an this is the true focus the focus it goes from the lam remember it's all tied together to the blood that was offered to the life of that blood because the Lamb of God already went to Calvary and they just tell you if you're a sinner this morning maybe even one that will hear this message there's already been in lamb that's went for you he already paid the price he already I find no fault in him there was testimony from all he did what was necessary he shed his blood and he paid the penalty is that right he pleaded our case he went in he said touch me not for I have not yet ascended he went there and here it was the presentation and then as he came back down and gave instruction for them that they as the believing children that they would come under the blood of the Lamb that was shed they would come under that blood as you sing about it this morning on the day of Pentecost wherein moved listen to me now it wasn't just looking at Calvary anymore it wasn't just talking about the blood that spilled on the ground but now it moves to the life that was within that blood coming back in the worshiper the Holy Ghost and what does he do he calls us to that perfection he brings us to that righteousness amen let's just bow our heads this morning is there anyone that would want to be remembered in prayer this morning God knows your need this morning he knows he knows your need whether it's sickness whether it's for healing whether it's deliverance maybe it's to come into that place to say I want to come under the blood fully he knows where you're at and God his faith we've examined we've looked at the lamb it's been examined it's been thoroughly proved the blood the life that same life that was within that lamb the same Almighty God our high priest has moved up and down the aisles this morning speaking to our hearts I'll say it to you right now don't go out of here this morning the same way you came in you just you call that devil a liar that's what he is because there's already a blood that has spoken for you you don't have to carry nothing you don't have to go out of here bound you don't have to go out of here this morning sick in your body you don't have to go out of here tormented in your mind you don't have to go out of here bound by sin because he is here not because her brother Sam I could lay my hands upon you but my hands can't do nothing for you but Jesus has already done it for me and he would just send me as he would send not just only his ministers but he would send every one of his believing children to minister entered speaking of that perfection that perfect sacrifice that perfect atoning life why don't you just say Lord [Music] from after me Lord which for those words fear not don't need a god your cheese's Father here we stand this woman our advocate Lord Jesus Lord you are here we sang that song in the early part of service he is here not here in a corporal body but he is here in his spirit that same life that same God who moved upon the earth in the beginning that same God who was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself father under the authority of the blood sacrifice by the Holy Ghost the Lord your Satan to take his hands off Satan you're defeated you've been stripped at countering My Lord Jesus he defeated you the grade couldn't hold him hell could not continue and every sin has been put upon you so as the Son of God anointed by the Holy Ghost under the blood how dare you take your hands off your life and you've been defeated these are God's children sons and daughters that have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb the father pass Lord right now but the needs that behind those hands that every focus right now that focus is not upon themselves their focus is on you as Paul withdraw our attention by the Spirit of God looking unto Jesus look away to Jesus where we're looking to Jesus right here in plain view right here before it's revealed from his word by his spirit were looking at Jesus look away don't look at your don't look at fans no look to him look to him when sin in an account moses was instructed to take that rod and take that that brazen serpent put it on that rod and and and put it out between the heavens and the earth it represented sin already judged judgment as with back on the accuser the blood of Jesus lifts it from every son and daughter of God and puts it wrapped back off be accused the one who made you do it in the first place Oh father right now Lord I ask God make it real to every heart would you just move right there Lord God make it real to every deal I made a number one that would walk out of here Lord God but yet they would walk out under the blood well in the name of Jesus Christ I

power moving through his body then move through Alachua that moved through elijah let's pray right now this priest of God Lord Jesus but now there are hands better lay upon my brothers and sisters hands than Lord you have to make work and father as those hands are laid upon one another that same quickening power that moved Lord God of all the lashes both when they threw a dead man in there Lord it came back to life Lord God when God was in the midst of battle Lord and it's all in his battle for naught but they threw him in there Lord and in the midst of the battle he came back to life father in the name of Jesus Christ we ask Lord God for that same Holy Ghost Lord that same quickening power Lord God but not your mood right now Lord God on these needs or better gathered Lord maybe there's one sweet lord o father there in battle for God but they've got weak Lord God maybe they've found it along the way but father we're looking Lord not to the bones of Elijah but we are looking to the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ and father we ask right now for that same light for God to move Lord God upon me right now Lord move upon that soul Lord move upon that man Lord move upon that body
