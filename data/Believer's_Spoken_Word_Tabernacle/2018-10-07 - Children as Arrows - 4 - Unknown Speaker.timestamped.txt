[37:49] and we want to go right on into the word
[37:52] this morning
[38:00] let's go to Psalms 127 I know that's a
[38:06] big shock isn't it Psalms 127 verse 1 my
[38:16] wonder word of the Lord just wonderful
[38:18] Thursday night
[38:32] Psalms 127 verse 1 a song of degrees for
[38:39] Solomon Wow what a what a statement to
[38:45] start out with this is that Solomon
[38:47] might know even though Solomon has been
[38:51] designated by God to build the house of
[38:55] the Lord David wants him to remember
[38:58] your designation is yielding your
[39:03] designation is not your strength except
[39:08] the Lord build the house they labor in
[39:13] vain that building except the Lord keep
[39:19] the city the watchman waketh but in vain
[39:24] it is vain for you to rise up early to
[39:29] sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows
[39:31] for so he giveth his beloved sleep low
[39:38] children are in heritage of the Lord and
[39:41] the fruit of the womb is his reward as
[39:45] arrows are in the hand of a mighty man
[39:49] so are the children of the youth happy
[39:54] is the man that hath his quiver full of
[39:56] them they shall not be ashamed but they
[40:00] shall speak with the enemies in the gate
[40:04] a man
[40:07] let's just bow our heads and award a
[40:09] prayer here this morning you ever need
[40:12] upon your heart you'd want to make known
[40:14] to the Lord and say Lord just remember
[40:17] me god bless you bless you this morning
[40:20] let's just go to the throne of God
[40:22] together Lord Jesus it's just a
[40:27] privilege and an honor Lord that we can
[40:31] be able to come together as brothers and
[40:34] sisters of like precious faith Lord with
[40:37] one desire with one motive with one
[40:41] objective Lord your God that's to hear
[40:44] from you Lord each and every one of us
[40:49] the Lord there are needs upon our hearts
[40:53] Lord as we know very very well Lord all
[40:59] throughout the congregation here we're
[41:02] either in a trial coming out of a trial
[41:06] or heading into a trial we're in one of
[41:09] those places this morning and how
[41:12] thankful we are that God once again how
[41:15] that you remind us that father you are
[41:19] over all things Lord and so Lord beyond
[41:24] behind the hands that Lord are lifted up
[41:27] and for every heart Lord we Sun a song
[41:30] here just moments ago and the desire was
[41:33] is that you would listen to our hearts
[41:35] for Lord truly we have this Lord in your
[41:40] word where you have made real to us and
[41:43] we have witnessed it as believers where
[41:45] the Spirit of God has made intercession
[41:48] for us with groanings that cannot be
[41:50] uttered Lord father testimony after
[41:54] testimony of that we are just Lord God
[41:57] desiring once again this morning Lord as
[42:00] you have heard our hearts crime that
[42:03] dear God that you would come by our way
[42:05] and you would speak to our our lives
[42:08] Lord in such a personal way Lord though
[42:12] it may not be that you would call maybe
[42:14] out the exact need you can do that Lord
[42:16] it's based on what you see Lord and
[42:19] what your will is but Lord as we look at
[42:22] it sometimes Lord it's just Lord where
[42:24] you will minister to us that will help
[42:27] us to be able to yield more and get out
[42:30] of the way that you might fulfill what
[42:33] we are what we are desiring and laying
[42:36] before you as a need Lord we realize
[42:39] more and more as we walk in this life
[42:40] and fathers were walking in you that the
[42:43] greatest need that we have and the
[42:46] challenge that always lays before us is
[42:48] us getting out of the way would you help
[42:51] us this morning and may father even from
[42:54] this service Lord God from in our lives
[42:56] Lord God the yielding father and the
[42:59] growth that would take place father Lord
[43:01] we just pray that you'll just come among

[43:06] and break the word of life to our hearts
[43:07] Lord we pray Lord ministering to every
[43:10] need that's here in the name of Jesus
[43:13] Christ amen I mean God blesses your
[43:16] being seated
[43:27] got to get my prop back out here
[43:33] we've been looking at this in the
[43:35] scripture on children as arrows and as
[43:38] we we took that the last time that we
[43:40] were together quite a few of the times
[43:44] here and looking at some of the parts
[43:45] within the scripture and we examining
[43:50] that of an arrow itself and you know
[43:52] there's things that God will use as
[43:54] we've said we see this in the word where
[43:56] God will use different symbols God will
[43:59] take things and the symbols themselves
[44:01] are used not because God has to use them
[44:05] but God will do that so that you and I
[44:07] can be brought into an understanding and
[44:10] so you know you think of even how that
[44:13] Paul himself would deal even in the book
[44:17] of Ephesians you you see it in the book
[44:19] of Corinthians you see it also in the
[44:21] book of Hebrews Paul will at times
[44:23] compare it to that of a race you'll also
[44:25] compare the walk of our life to an
[44:27] Olympian who is training like a boxer
[44:30] who would have to bring his body into
[44:31] subjection then you'll find where Paul
[44:34] will deal with in in Ephesians 6 and
[44:36] he'll actually put two things before us
[44:37] that where we are wrestling not against
[44:40] flesh and blood so there's a wrestling
[44:42] match that's going on and then Paul will
[44:44] go on in that same scriptures that are
[44:48] verses that are put there that we are
[44:50] clothed with the full armor of God and
[44:53] so as a soldier so it's a it's a war
[44:55] that we are engaged in so there's many
[44:57] different analogies and symbols that are
[44:59] used in the scripture to help our
[45:02] understanding and sometimes we can read
[45:03] over things and we not that we meaningly
[45:06] read over just to pass over it but I
[45:09] believe that God has a time that he will
[45:12] quicken things to our heart you know
[45:14] there's things that every one of us have
[45:16] read there's things that I've heard that
[45:17] brother Bam has said there's things I've
[45:19] read in the scriptures and certain
[45:21] things I just couldn't you know my
[45:23] understanding I knew there was something
[45:25] more it wasn't that I didn't believe it
[45:26] it's just I knew there's something
[45:28] deeper that's being said here
[45:30] now it isn't it for me to pry it because
[45:32] remember it wasn't the prophet who pried
[45:34] out these things it was God Himself who
[45:37] took the cap off the mountain so if God
[45:40] did it in order for this message to come
[45:42] to us than it has to be the same God to
[45:44] open these things to our heart
[45:47] and God will always do it in the right
[45:49] time in the right season and I believe
[45:52] that the word is always always in season
[45:55] for what we have need of it the word is
[45:57] not something that's set forth like for
[46:00] example what we heard on Thursday night
[46:02] of trials and and things like that there
[46:05] you know we how many times that we've
[46:07] heard and ministered with on trials but
[46:09] you see it's not about us coming to a
[46:11] place to where we have a memory of
[46:12] things and oh this is what's going on
[46:14] old this is what's happening but it's
[46:16] it's much deeper than that God gives a
[46:18] word for a season in that time showing
[46:22] you and I that the eyes of the Lord are
[46:24] indeed showing themselves strong in our
[46:27] behalf it's God coming to minister to
[46:30] our needs and I'm so grateful for that
[46:31] that it's a word that God speaks in
[46:34] season to our lives and as we look at
[46:36] this with arrows and and going through
[46:38] this week we've seen that there are
[46:40] indeed four parts to an arrow and you
[46:42] know I'm not here to try to educate you
[46:44] on on the home the times of the arrow
[46:46] but you know you have that you have the
[46:48] very shaft itself of the arrow and the
[46:51] material that it's made out of and we've
[46:53] we've looked at that and then you have
[46:55] also the you know you've got the
[46:57] fletchings of the of the arrow that have
[46:59] to be placed on the arrow in' and those
[47:02] fletchings are more than just things of
[47:04] color as a matter of fact now these
[47:06] colors right here I used to think those
[47:07] things were pretty nice you know I
[47:09] thought my that's a nice color but until
[47:12] I shot one of these and it I had to find
[47:14] it in the woods and that color doesn't
[47:16] do too well finding it in the woods
[47:18] because most of the leaves on the ground
[47:19] kind of look this color so I thought it
[47:23] was a great color but really the best
[47:24] thing it could I think now is probably
[47:26] white because white wood with that blood
[47:28] on it'll stick out like a sore thumb but
[47:30] at any rate that's not that's free there
[47:33] wasn't unspiritual about that well maybe
[47:36] there is if our lives are so quiet that
[47:39] the blood of Jesus Christ could shine
[47:41] forth so we have been another we have
[47:46] the other part here of that of you know
[47:48] the knock itself and then we have that
[47:50] where the knock you've got to have a
[47:52] knock there if you don't that string can
[47:54] slip all around and that arrow can come
[47:56] off of there in such a way and and then
[47:58] you have the tip itself which is the
[48:01] the thing that we want to look at a
[48:03] little bit closer here and and take the
[48:05] next part of it here I want to look at
[48:07] this this part right here these these
[48:09] fletchings and I want to look at these
[48:12] fletchings and these are things that
[48:14] actually when you look at it if an arrow
[48:16] did not have a fletching on it if it was
[48:18] just the straight shaft itself though it
[48:21] might have a knock upon it and though it
[48:23] might have an arrow the fletching itself
[48:26] is for a purpose of this arrow that that
[48:29] the back end will not get ahead of the
[48:32] front end it actually the the actual
[48:35] fletchings itself actually creates a
[48:37] drag so that the arrow will stay in
[48:40] humility I mean it will stay in the
[48:42] right order so that it doesn't get the
[48:44] back in front of the front so it's just
[48:48] a right way and this and yet this right
[48:50] here when we look at this character that
[48:52] is molded and and that can be shaped
[48:55] because these things it's very
[48:56] meticulous of how that you would apply
[48:58] this fletching and a lot of times guys
[49:01] will take it and they'll take the
[49:02] fletching and they'll kind of give it a
[49:04] little bit of a of a spin to it so that
[49:06] even when the arrow is coming off this
[49:08] flight and the spin and has it's going
[49:10] it they want to try to keep it as
[49:12] straight as possible in flight and
[49:14] that's the same thing that the character
[49:16] and the molding of character within the
[49:19] lives not only of our children but the
[49:21] same way that God does and works in our
[49:23] life and I'll tell you what you might
[49:25] think and I think maybe as a parent boy
[49:27] we got our work cut out for us but how
[49:29] about him but you know what he didn't
[49:32] pull back he didn't shirk the duty he
[49:35] knew everything that would be about us
[49:37] but his confidence is is his life
[49:40] dwelling in us and then that submission
[49:45] and that humility he will accomplish
[49:47] what he has ordained to be accomplished
[49:50] he sure will and he is doing that so
[49:53] when we look at this of the fletching
[49:55] because you know many times character we
[49:57] know character to be you know how and
[50:00] who you really are no matter if you're
[50:02] by yourself or other people are around
[50:05] your character is who you are when you
[50:09] think of it in the term of the of the
[50:11] Hebrew when they we look at the word
[50:14] name the word name itself actually means
[50:18] character and so when you think of that
[50:20] in terms of God calling the names of his
[50:25] children down through the ages it's God
[50:28] calling the characteristic of himself in
[50:32] that hour by manifesting his word that
[50:35] calls the people of the hour because we
[50:39] are identified in the name of Jesus
[50:42] Christ and when that name is manifest we
[50:46] are a part of that name and then we
[50:48] begin to recognize that we in ourselves
[50:52] are not of this world but we indeed are
[50:55] Pilgrims and strangers this world is not
[50:58] my home
[50:59] and we begin to recognize that there is
[51:02] a greater calling and a greater family
[51:05] of which that you and I are a part of
[51:08] and that is a family that is of a tree
[51:10] that knows no end it's the tree of life
[51:13] and we we can see that within that of
[51:16] character character itself it is
[51:18] something that the molding of how that
[51:20] we will respond and act and and in
[51:24] situations and I just reminded of the of
[51:27] the thought you know brother branham
[51:29] under the inspiration of God would speak
[51:32] to us so many times upon character and
[51:34] how that within character itself that
[51:37] it's not a gift nobody can give you in
[51:40] our character you realize that even the
[51:43] preaching of the word ELISA I'm saying
[51:45] the preaching of the word itself does
[51:47] not give you an eye character but the
[51:50] ministering of the word calls us in
[51:52] submission that he might mold our
[51:55] character and the real molding of our
[51:58] character when we say Lord I want to see
[52:00] more of the virtue this virtue of my
[52:01] life that bit the only way that any of
[52:04] the virtues come forth that is already
[52:06] within us is under trials and under
[52:09] tests they don't come forth in any other
[52:12] way how can brotherly kindness come
[52:14] forth unless there is a test that will
[52:16] bring that forth because you see it's
[52:19] got to be brotherly kindness not just
[52:21] not just something of where somebody is
[52:23] earthly in their makeup but it must be
[52:26] something for
[52:26] the depth of God's divine nature same
[52:29] way with temperance patience and all
[52:31] those other things so it's character
[52:33] itself is the very AMOLED and shaping
[52:36] it's not a gift but it is a victory and
[52:38] you know we can go throughout this a
[52:40] building you know this morning there are
[52:41] many things that I can even attest them
[52:44] only that the greatest victory itself is
[52:46] not so much when I would see certain
[52:49] things then take place or maybe my
[52:51] response within something or how that I
[52:53] can approach something and look at
[52:54] something now and think my goodness out
[52:56] I never approached it like that a year
[52:57] two years ago five years ago ten years
[52:59] ago but you can what were the great
[53:01] victory is is when you begin to
[53:03] recognize and the victory is starts from
[53:06] within you that's the great victory that
[53:09] means that no matter what comes along
[53:11] the victory you've already come to a
[53:13] place in your life to be able to lay
[53:15] down your will it don't mean that it
[53:17] ain't gonna be hard and we're not going
[53:18] to be tested but remember we're still in
[53:21] this sticker sticky
[53:22] taco burl shell but thanks be to God
[53:25] we've got the life of sweet life on the
[53:28] inside and there's a development that's
[53:30] going on and that development is by us
[53:32] surrendering to his working so as we
[53:35] look at this the thing that I'm just
[53:37] drawn to by the by the Holy Spirit when
[53:39] I was looking at this of character
[53:40] because we can begin to look at
[53:42] character and we could say well you know
[53:44] we do this and we can think no doubt of
[53:46] many scriptures we've used when we look
[53:48] at even the raising of children and how
[53:51] that the Holy Spirit would a brings
[53:53] forth and the tutoring and the raising
[53:55] of our life but I want you to notice
[53:57] here that every one of these fletchings
[53:59] right here it would do no good unless
[54:01] there was something to be able to bond
[54:04] these fletchings on this shaft the only
[54:07] way that character itself can actually
[54:09] be molded as their first has to be unity
[54:14] without unity there can be no character
[54:17] molding unity itself is actually what
[54:21] gives the word life and substance and
[54:25] meaning I want you to think of this for
[54:27] a moment think of Peters life brother
[54:28] Branham will dramatize this for us when
[54:30] he speaks of how that Peter you know he
[54:32] could hear his dear old daddy you know
[54:34] in brother Brent said he could see the
[54:35] tears remember all this of how his dad
[54:37] would tell him about
[54:39] remember what God had spoke through
[54:41] Moses regarding that the Lord our God
[54:43] shall raise up a prophet like unto Moses
[54:46] and from among the Brethren and you know
[54:47] the the rest of that of that story or
[54:49] the rest of that scripture and to think
[54:51] of it that that was more than just a
[54:54] word that was a promise wasn't it there
[54:57] was a promise of a redeemer all the way
[54:59] back from the Garden of Eden and it was
[55:01] there was that which you would have to
[55:03] recognize that there's things that
[55:05] brother Branham is saying in the in in
[55:07] that particular story that he may not
[55:09] say by words but it's being said and
[55:11] that is that there had to be something
[55:13] that no matter what it was within Peters
[55:16] life Peter we know you know he needed a
[55:19] touch from God in his life but no matter
[55:21] what it was he could not get away from
[55:25] what his dad had said now you can look
[55:27] and say well Peter was elected to that I
[55:29] will agree with that I will definitely
[55:31] say amen to that a hundred percent but I
[55:33] what I what I'm looking at here what is
[55:35] so pressed upon my heart there had to be
[55:38] something that was such an impression
[55:40] beyond the words that were called
[55:43] talking about the coming Messiah that
[55:45] actually there was a life behind the
[55:48] quoting and rehearsing of the prophecy
[55:51] that actually would cause Peter to
[55:54] actually look for it and it looked there
[55:56] were many men that rose up to being the
[55:58] Messiah but yet there was something
[56:00] about it how God had it so arranged and
[56:03] reserved within that hour and there was
[56:05] such an impression of that word and I
[56:08] believe it wasn't that Jonas was a
[56:10] forceful man that he was a dictator that
[56:13] it was something I boys I'm gonna tell
[56:15] you that I don't believe that at all I
[56:16] believe that the Holy Spirit that was
[56:19] there who gave the promise of the
[56:21] Messiah the same one who came down in
[56:23] the Garden of Eden I believe that that
[56:25] same Holy Spirit there who will bring
[56:28] that promise to pass God releases divine
[56:31] grace that moves upon the elect as it
[56:33] has down through the time to those who
[56:36] are gathered to that promise making
[56:38] ready for that promise to be fulfilled
[56:40] and then Jonas himself under that divine
[56:43] grace so it was not just words that he
[56:46] was Solon but it was actually word that
[56:49] was anointed by the grace of God that
[56:53] was something more than just word to
[56:56] wear that Peter could reverence the word
[56:58] and I believe with all my heart this is
[57:01] why that unity is so important when we
[57:04] look at that of the molding of character
[57:06] unity is one of the is one of the
[57:08] greatest things and I don't want to just
[57:10] say one of but it is the achievement and
[57:13] the desire of Almighty God so when we
[57:17] look at this here in Psalms 133 verse 1
[57:20] the Bible says like this from the near
[57:23] passage of Scripture a song of degrees
[57:26] of David behold how good and how
[57:29] pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[57:34] together in unity now this is what God
[57:39] thinks concerning unity notice among
[57:42] brethren those who are of the same
[57:45] parents God wants unity within the
[57:49] family dog wants unity within his family
[57:53] and the one one the heir God is even
[57:57] laying down in this scripture as he has
[57:58] all along that the real prescription for
[58:02] unity among one another is to first be
[58:06] united with him so then when we look at
[58:09] this it is good and how behold look at
[58:12] take observation how good and how
[58:14] pleasant it is how good it is and we
[58:16] look at this word how pleasant how
[58:18] agreeable and you know how delightful
[58:21] how sweet how lovely how agreeable it is
[58:25] for brethren to dwell together in unity
[58:30] think about this you know the arm the
[58:32] the good how many times we look in the
[58:34] scripture in the very beginning where
[58:37] God the Bible would say from each of
[58:40] those days how that God would speak and
[58:42] then he would step back and he would see
[58:44] what he spoke come to fruition in that
[58:47] time and God would step back and say
[58:49] behold it is good it is very good what
[58:55] was God looking at you see God had in
[58:58] his mind a full vision of what God
[59:02] intended to do but God is not
[59:05] in a hurry he's not dragging his feet
[59:08] but God is working so that every detail
[59:12] of what he has spoken for that day that
[59:17] it will come forth and when it comes
[59:19] forth the very manifestation of that is
[59:23] the characteristic of that word that has
[59:28] been spoken and when it comes forward
[59:30] then God can look and say behold it is
[59:33] good so this one we're looking at it
[59:36] it's the same way how can there be unity
[59:40] outside of the word there can't be in a
[59:44] unity any correct unity outside of the
[59:47] word it must be solemnly based on the
[59:51] word so then when we're looking at this
[59:54] here within the scripture such a harmony
[59:56] and a unity then you're looking verse
[59:58] two hears we go on down it says now look
[1:00:01] what this unity is like it is like here
[1:00:04] is a comparison it is like the precious
[1:00:07] ointment up on the head that ran down
[1:00:12] upon the beard even Aaron's beard that
[1:00:17] went down to the skirts of his garments
[1:00:22] so god this is God showing this of a
[1:00:26] perfect man
[1:00:27] he's showing what what unity does the
[1:00:30] effect of unity this unity of his spirit
[1:00:35] his presence in notice upon the head
[1:00:38] upon the head and as it moves from the
[1:00:41] head it's to flow down as he even would
[1:00:44] describe Aaron's face even Aaron's beard
[1:00:47] and he goes clear to the very end of the
[1:00:51] garments aren't you glad that that same
[1:00:54] Holy Spirit that came and anointed our
[1:00:57] Lord Jesus as now as it came back into
[1:01:00] the church after his offering up aren't
[1:01:03] you glad that you and I are part in this
[1:01:05] hour of the finishing up it's no
[1:01:08] different it's not a different Holy
[1:01:10] Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost and how
[1:01:14] has he returned by the promise of
[1:01:17] his word so has his word what is his
[1:01:20] word it is that which makes up his body
[1:01:24] so here the flow of the spirit and unity
[1:01:27] it takes there of a harmony that flows
[1:01:30] from the head down it shows them to you
[1:01:33] and I that unity itself was restored and
[1:01:37] is restored first through Christ the
[1:01:39] head is that right Paul Paul puts this
[1:01:42] forth here and Paul's reminding there in
[1:01:44] the book of Corinthians that every man
[1:01:47] would know that God being the head of
[1:01:49] Christ and Christ the head of every man
[1:01:53] NU'EST me and then he goes on down and
[1:01:56] brings it home down in the man the head
[1:01:58] of the woman he brings down the correct
[1:02:00] unity and the correct order that is set
[1:02:04] forth now when I look at this here in
[1:02:06] verse 3 as it goes on I love this it is
[1:02:09] as the dew of Hermon
[1:02:11] it's like God they just can't get a way
[1:02:13] of talking about unity he said let me
[1:02:17] give you another example it's as the dew
[1:02:20] of Hermon determine being Zion and as
[1:02:25] the dew that descended upon the
[1:02:28] mountains of Zion for there the lord
[1:02:32] commanded the blessing even life
[1:02:36] forevermore so there's a designated
[1:02:38] place of the blessing of God God
[1:02:43] designates where his blessing is poured
[1:02:45] out it is poured out upon Herman and
[1:02:49] Herman being that of sanctuary his house
[1:02:52] his dwelling that which he himself has
[1:02:55] chosen to inhabit and to think how God
[1:02:57] would describe it it wasn't something
[1:02:59] that's noisy you know like last night
[1:03:02] I'll tell you what that rain that was
[1:03:04] coming down it was some hard rain that
[1:03:07] lightning that was coming down it was
[1:03:09] lightning all that but some of your
[1:03:10] looks I can tell some of you already
[1:03:11] asleep and I wasn't that late either but
[1:03:15] I'll tell you what that rain was really
[1:03:17] coming down it was making a noise coming
[1:03:19] down but you see do itself doesn't make
[1:03:22] a noise do itself is not something that
[1:03:26] is to be belittled as a matter of fact
[1:03:29] it
[1:03:29] one of the blessings that God promised
[1:03:32] to Jacob who was inheritor of the blood
[1:03:36] birthright and part of the blessing is
[1:03:39] that Perdue of heaven would be yours now
[1:03:42] sometimes we could look at the dew of
[1:03:44] heaven and say what the dew of heaven
[1:03:46] what will the dew of heaven do the dew
[1:03:48] of heaven it comes down in such a
[1:03:50] stillness and such a sweetness you can
[1:03:53] walk out of a morning among your flowers
[1:03:56] walk up on your grass you can look at
[1:03:58] that there is avery freshman that comes
[1:04:01] in the morning by the do yet you don't
[1:04:04] hear it you don't see it you don't say
[1:04:07] hey honey you hear that dew falling
[1:04:08] outside you don't hear that at all and
[1:04:10] neither do you hear the do when it's
[1:04:13] ascending back up from where it comes
[1:04:15] from you do not hear that but the dew
[1:04:17] itself is accomplishing the work of
[1:04:21] which it is to do on our behalf they
[1:04:24] might say Lord I want rain
[1:04:26] I like services where the rain is
[1:04:27] pouring down to but there's also times
[1:04:29] that we need do and sometimes do can
[1:04:33] settle down just real soft you're loving
[1:04:44] that do settling down there in that
[1:04:48] sanctuary in that in that home you know
[1:04:50] I'll think about it
[1:04:52] it's a place I believe that that
[1:04:54] believes our desire as believers we want
[1:04:58] we not only warn but I believe our homes
[1:05:00] is a place that were the Spirit of God
[1:05:04] not just our homes but us where he can
[1:05:07] show up at any time because we never
[1:05:12] know what he's going to do because
[1:05:13] listen friends the whole thing of him
[1:05:15] showing up it might be him showing up to
[1:05:17] rapture our body you know it do the say
[1:05:22] the thing about it is if we are become
[1:05:24] more aware but the whole thing of this
[1:05:26] of the other spirit and that of the
[1:05:28] world that tries to work is to try to
[1:05:30] bring us out of that realm of
[1:05:32] expectation but I'm so glad that God is
[1:05:36] here he's not defeated and God knows how
[1:05:38] to bring his people under expectation
[1:05:41] now I want you to watch that this
[1:05:42] anointing
[1:05:43] now that the profit I always loved this
[1:05:45] quote why are people so tossed about
[1:05:47] think about the the statement why are
[1:05:49] people so tossed about bill dime says
[1:05:51] some people gets the wrong impression of
[1:05:53] what the anointing is he said did you
[1:05:56] ever think of that
[1:05:57] when was the greatest anointing ever
[1:05:59] given to anyone and what they did or
[1:06:02] what they what did they do when they had
[1:06:05] the anointing the greatest anointing
[1:06:08] that was ever give to anyone was Jesus
[1:06:11] Christ we have the spirit by measure he
[1:06:14] had it without mission one day he
[1:06:16] entered into the temple and picked up
[1:06:18] the scroll and read the Spirit of God is
[1:06:21] upon me for he has anointed me to preach
[1:06:24] the acceptable year to bind up the
[1:06:26] broken hearts to heal the sick give
[1:06:29] sight to the blind look what the
[1:06:31] anointing did for him the anointing upon
[1:06:34] his life it put him in such a place for
[1:06:37] what living for the Liberty that would
[1:06:40] come to others so it's not about me
[1:06:44] being free and me but no it's the Latin
[1:06:46] that anointing moving on his life he
[1:06:49] could look at what it what the Liberty
[1:06:52] that would bring to others recovering of
[1:06:54] sight to the blind
[1:06:54] but you know the Jubilee sounding all of
[1:06:57] those things not to think of that how
[1:06:59] could he stand there and say that in
[1:07:01] that way because he knew who he was he
[1:07:05] wasn't living for himself he was living
[1:07:09] for you and me and now notice and now we
[1:07:15] would think if such an anointing was on
[1:07:19] him that been prophesied eight hundred
[1:07:21] years before that it would come and here
[1:07:23] he was with that type of anointing the
[1:07:25] full blessing and anointing of the Lord
[1:07:27] upon him we would want to run all over
[1:07:31] the building scream and holler
[1:07:33] now the Church of Christ and the Baptist
[1:07:36] people hey man
[1:07:38] and in that we don't believe in
[1:07:40] screaming and hollering running off but
[1:07:41] he's trying to show us that an anointing
[1:07:43] it's not just something that comes and
[1:07:45] goes comes and goes comes and goes
[1:07:48] that's what he's trying to show us he's
[1:07:49] not belittling you know this as much as
[1:07:51] I do I found it very interesting I said
[1:07:54] after a meeting there in Virginia and I
[1:07:56] spoke there would brother
[1:07:57] Kenny captain we were talking there as
[1:07:59] ministers together and it was just
[1:08:00] incredible some of the testimonies that
[1:08:02] brother Kenny Capps was given of how
[1:08:04] that the prophet of God Himself how he
[1:08:06] got and entered so much into the Spirit
[1:08:09] of God he wasn't no dry stick-in-the-mud
[1:08:11] now listen friends we're not taken away
[1:08:13] you worship God according to the
[1:08:15] dictates of your heart but remember make
[1:08:17] sure the dictates of your heart are not
[1:08:19] dictating the way that everybody else
[1:08:21] can worship is that right just as much
[1:08:24] as maybe some that's not maybe as vocal
[1:08:26] and there might be others that are vocal
[1:08:28] and others in her vocal say why aren't
[1:08:29] these people vocal on their little said
[1:08:30] they were learner not vocal why are they
[1:08:32] vocal you see let that that's just
[1:08:34] that's just childish
[1:08:35] that's just foolishness don't let that
[1:08:36] stuff separate us and let's get united
[1:08:39] and let's worship God that's what it's
[1:08:43] all about you know sometimes you can be
[1:08:44] preaching to people they may not say a
[1:08:46] man
[1:08:47] but I'll tell you what I can still fill
[1:08:48] the pool that they're pulling on the
[1:08:50] Lord gen alright he said there was that
[1:08:58] anointing we would want to run all over
[1:08:59] the building scream and holler but the
[1:09:02] Bible said he laid down the scroll and
[1:09:05] sat down and precious words proceeded
[1:09:09] from his mouth that's what he done under
[1:09:13] the anointing whoo this is the dew of
[1:09:16] Hermon this is the do this is what words
[1:09:20] notice what words were used were
[1:09:24] ministering grace to the hearer it was
[1:09:28] it was a word that was seeking to edify
[1:09:31] a word that was seeking to loosen his
[1:09:33] confidence was this was not the words of
[1:09:36] Isaiah this was the words of his father
[1:09:39] Isaiah was a servant an instrument a
[1:09:42] prophet of God that was used and the
[1:09:45] Spirit of God quickened that portion of
[1:09:47] the word to him and he stood there at
[1:09:50] that time as the do oh my upon his life
[1:09:53] and there was a word that went forth
[1:09:55] what an atmosphere you know the Bible
[1:09:57] said never a man spake like this man and
[1:10:01] the Bible says that the common people
[1:10:04] heard him gladly
[1:10:09] Wow that's what he done under the
[1:10:12] anointing the anointing is not emotions
[1:10:16] the anointing is supreme power in
[1:10:21] control but some of you mean that after
[1:10:27] I get out of here Monday morning that
[1:10:30] you have the anointing is supreme power
[1:10:33] under control you see brother BAM tells
[1:10:36] us what in the message humble thyself
[1:10:38] what real humility is he says is being
[1:10:41] able to conquer yourself he said when
[1:10:45] you're able to conquer yourself you've
[1:10:46] got more power than the man that would
[1:10:48] run all around the building because you
[1:10:50] have been able to conquer yourself and
[1:10:53] let's just be honest that's the greatest
[1:10:54] person that's the person we've got to
[1:10:57] conquer over and over and over and over
[1:10:59] but thanks be to God we've got the
[1:11:01] mighty conquer on the inside greater is
[1:11:04] He that is in me than he that's in the
[1:11:07] world
[1:11:07] that's anointing because remember
[1:11:09] anointing is like how prophet would
[1:11:11] describe it there I think it's in the
[1:11:13] message who do you say this is in 64
[1:11:15] brother Brent says you know he says you
[1:11:16] take a young man that can look at a
[1:11:18] woman and he said she make a very fine
[1:11:20] wife oh what a wonderful wife she is oh
[1:11:22] my she would do all this and brother
[1:11:24] I've said it dudes no you know no good
[1:11:26] unless you make her your wife now we
[1:11:29] understand everything that has to be
[1:11:31] done but notice Bill Graham said that's
[1:11:33] the same way it is with the message he
[1:11:35] said you can sympathize with it now what
[1:11:40] does it mean to sympathize with
[1:11:41] something that's right now it's the
[1:11:43] truth it's right it's absolutely truth
[1:11:46] yeah that's right I agree with it yeah
[1:11:48] but that don't do no good but he says
[1:11:51] when you become one with it you take it
[1:11:55] you receive it and he receives you he
[1:11:57] said then the anointing is with you as
[1:12:00] it is with others but now remember the
[1:12:04] anointing is not emotions you might be
[1:12:07] making your biscuits of a morning right
[1:12:09] there under the anointing because what
[1:12:12] you're under the anointing of this word
[1:12:14] Christ you're under the headship of this
[1:12:18] word whether you feel like it
[1:12:20] or
[1:12:21] when Christ has moved into the depths of
[1:12:23] your heart and you're examining your
[1:12:25] life you know we examine a heart we
[1:12:27] examine our life to make sure that we
[1:12:29] are in fellowship with him because to a
[1:12:32] believer the worst thing that can happen
[1:12:34] is to be out of fellowship with him
[1:12:38] because to get out of fellowship with
[1:12:40] him you get out of fellowship with one
[1:12:41] another it just it just keeps going but
[1:12:45] we'll stay on this this morning so when
[1:12:47] we look at this unity of where it's at
[1:12:49] it is that anointing of that that you
[1:12:52] and I are under it is supreme power in
[1:12:55] control like knowing exactly what and
[1:12:58] how and that's what's here well I think
[1:13:03] what you could really preach on this
[1:13:04] court a long time that no and what and
[1:13:07] how does that mean that everything is
[1:13:08] laid out this is what's gonna happen and
[1:13:10] that's well let me ask you is that what
[1:13:11] happened when when God had the plane
[1:13:13] grounded in Memphis did the Prophet and
[1:13:16] all the house and wats to it I'm gonna
[1:13:18] go down this way there'll be a mailbox
[1:13:20] here I'll turn that way no matter of
[1:13:22] fact he didn't know why it was he didn't
[1:13:24] know what was going on he didn't even
[1:13:25] know why the Spirit of God had said
[1:13:27] follow me this way
[1:13:28] he didn't know but all he knew was to
[1:13:30] obey that whole example was destroying -
[1:13:35] you and I in this hour that the
[1:13:37] simplicity of God to obey his voice and
[1:13:41] God will you will move through our lives
[1:13:44] that is supreme power in control Oh
[1:13:49] glory be to God - unity itself unity it
[1:13:54] brings stability in a life you with me
[1:13:58] it brings stability when we're united in
[1:14:01] the right way sometimes when there's
[1:14:04] wrong unions even though a person can
[1:14:06] come out of that Union and realize oh
[1:14:08] that was a bad Union but sometimes there
[1:14:10] has to be a healing that takes place in
[1:14:12] order for them to trust for a true union
[1:14:14] so you see there God knows what he's
[1:14:17] doing God knows how to mold and to shape
[1:14:19] our lives because remember the whole
[1:14:21] attribute a whole characteristic of
[1:14:24] unity is stability and without unity
[1:14:30] think about this without unity nothing
[1:14:31] can be accomplished I won't ask you on
[1:14:34] how many of you
[1:14:35] have surgeries I know I've been to some
[1:14:36] of you most of you that's had surgeries
[1:14:38] and things but I know one thing you know
[1:14:40] when we come in the room you certainly
[1:14:41] wouldn't want doctors and nurses and
[1:14:43] everybody else saying hey I'll tell you
[1:14:45] what you took my parking spot no no I
[1:14:48] didn't I was Employee of the Month
[1:14:51] hey I'm handing him the forceps today no
[1:14:54] you're not I got here first and I got
[1:14:56] him on the tray now how many of you
[1:14:58] would feel like this is gonna be a
[1:15:01] wonderful surgery this is going to be
[1:15:04] wonderful
[1:15:06] you wouldn't just be asking me to pray
[1:15:09] your husband or your wife or whatever
[1:15:11] more you'd be saying you think we can
[1:15:13] reschedule this you think we could you
[1:15:17] think we can why because you recognize
[1:15:19] you're the one going under the knife and
[1:15:22] you recognize you're the one going under
[1:15:24] the knife and what is it about it you
[1:15:25] recognize there's got to be unity there
[1:15:27] I don't want them fighting over this
[1:15:28] kind of stuff right here because unity
[1:15:32] itself they might have differences so in
[1:15:36] some amount of took so and so's parking
[1:15:37] spot so and so might accenting
[1:15:39] so-and-so's pew so and so mine I did
[1:15:41] this or whatever more but when all of
[1:15:42] that is laid aside and said hey we got a
[1:15:44] patient right here with cancer and we're
[1:15:45] going in there to get that cancer today
[1:15:47] and all of them said what did you see on
[1:15:48] the report
[1:15:49] whereas this where's the blood levels
[1:15:50] anesthesiologist where's this set and
[1:15:52] they outside might have all sorts of
[1:15:54] disagreements but there's one thing
[1:15:56] about it they are there in that room not
[1:15:59] because they necessarily agree with one
[1:16:01] another but they agree with what they
[1:16:04] have been anointed for and that causes
[1:16:08] them to lay aside other things that are
[1:16:12] not so significant in an amazing you
[1:16:14] find things sometimes in families where
[1:16:16] things will be driven apart in such a
[1:16:18] way and then all of a sudden how
[1:16:19] there'll be something that God will
[1:16:21] permit and allow to come into that
[1:16:22] family and a sickness will come together
[1:16:24] people who wouldn't even talk to one
[1:16:25] another people who wouldn't even look at
[1:16:27] one another won't text one another won't
[1:16:29] call one another email whatever and on
[1:16:31] and on and on and on you let something
[1:16:32] happen you know what they're right there
[1:16:34] and beside the hospital bed all
[1:16:36] differences are forgotten what a shame
[1:16:38] it is it takes something like that to
[1:16:39] happen what a shame it is for that to
[1:16:42] happen
[1:16:43] oh my you're loving
[1:16:50] you might be sitting here this morning
[1:16:52] you might say I thought were preaching
[1:16:53] on family I am we are but it's bringing
[1:16:57] this down God showing you and I how he
[1:17:00] deals with you and I because remember as
[1:17:02] we've said over and over God will not
[1:17:05] ask you to do something that he himself
[1:17:07] is not only willing but has already done
[1:17:11] the very same things that he asks of you
[1:17:14] and I remember what he desires for you
[1:17:17] and I he already came down and he took
[1:17:19] his own walls upon himself now to think
[1:17:22] of this here in the scriptures and
[1:17:24] brother BAM we'll go through this in the
[1:17:25] message oneness and when you look at
[1:17:28] this in the message one this brother Ram
[1:17:29] sets this forth of how that God's
[1:17:31] program is that we would be one with him
[1:17:34] and once you just listen our brother
[1:17:35] brand brings this Luther have said now
[1:17:37] the first man and first woman in the
[1:17:40] Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[1:17:43] with God very important with God it's
[1:17:49] not one another than with God it's with
[1:17:52] God and with one another now watch this
[1:17:57] this is how what's this meter it's like
[1:18:00] a test meter they were in harmony with
[1:18:03] God so much so much how do you know they
[1:18:08] weren't such harmony God could come down
[1:18:10] at any time he desired and talked lip to
[1:18:16] ear with Adam and Eve
[1:18:20] that's the harmony
[1:18:22] that's the harmony that God desires for
[1:18:25] our life now listen friends weak we can
[1:18:27] let down you know our our spiritual
[1:18:29] bonnets as it were and many times
[1:18:31] there's the things and the cares of life
[1:18:33] that'll try to take away that openness
[1:18:36] that we could have with God and God can
[1:18:41] come by away and say hey this is this
[1:18:45] has taken up time of where you're
[1:18:47] thinking on me because remember y'all
[1:18:51] want to make I want you your way to be
[1:18:53] good and prosperous of a good success I
[1:18:57] want you to think upon me
[1:19:00] I want to draw near to you Psalms one he
[1:19:04] that's planted as a tree by the living
[1:19:08] water in his law does he meditate day
[1:19:10] and night you're aware of it as
[1:19:14] believers God don't speak to us just
[1:19:16] when we're at the house of God he speaks
[1:19:17] to us here but you see the whole part of
[1:19:20] it is not just so that it's here there's
[1:19:22] things that God will speak to our lives
[1:19:23] here and mana Sheena's his children but
[1:19:26] this is not your walk with the Lord this
[1:19:29] is only something that how you come and
[1:19:31] you see the value of coming together
[1:19:34] with brothers and sisters of like
[1:19:36] precious faith and receiving from the
[1:19:38] Word of God that as you even go out of
[1:19:41] here when you're in your own homes in
[1:19:42] your own places you're living a
[1:19:44] victorious life and the real victory is
[1:19:46] as we've said us getting out of the way
[1:19:51] and it takes the word the sharp sword
[1:19:54] for us to be able to receive the
[1:19:57] dividing of us from us my so much he
[1:20:05] could come down at any time he desired I
[1:20:07] tell you one thing that I've told the
[1:20:09] Lord and this is where I want to stay
[1:20:10] I'm just telling you this I've told him
[1:20:12] but if there's many times where he's
[1:20:13] woke me up in early hours there have
[1:20:16] been times where he went where I'm and
[1:20:18] maybe in the middle of doing something
[1:20:19] and have to say hey I need to stop over
[1:20:21] here I need to just put down certain
[1:20:23] things and write down certain points or
[1:20:25] do certain things I said this to him
[1:20:27] anytime you want to wake me up wake me
[1:20:31] up anytime you want to talk to me talk
[1:20:35] to me if I'm sleeping or whatever more I
[1:20:39] found some of those times just to be the
[1:20:41] most dearest of times early of the
[1:20:43] morning the center were you tired you
[1:20:46] know later on the day yeah and sometimes
[1:20:48] I did get a little tired maybe when it
[1:20:50] came near dinner but there was such a
[1:20:52] refreshment of hearing from him a little
[1:20:57] something maybe he dropped along with
[1:20:59] money but don't you meant so much to me
[1:21:01] it's just something that just encouraged
[1:21:04] me throughout the day it's something
[1:21:06] that would you know put a smile and
[1:21:09] here's something that I could just go
[1:21:10] forward with and say thank you lord
[1:21:15] getting an amazing how when was it John
[1:21:19] Wesley's mother that Susanna is that
[1:21:23] Suzanne and Wesley remember how it was
[1:21:27] so portrayed that with with her and her
[1:21:30] husband with her husband I think was it
[1:21:31] Charles that forgive me I can't remember
[1:21:33] right now was it Charles okay
[1:21:35] it was portrayed in such a way that of
[1:21:38] all the children that they had when you
[1:21:40] ask those children they each and every
[1:21:43] one thought they were momma's pick and
[1:21:46] when they all come together and all to
[1:21:48] sit around your no no I was momma's pick
[1:21:51] your mom her mom's what it was she had
[1:21:53] away she had time with each of them and
[1:21:57] we're talking about time we're talking
[1:21:59] about to where it was something to where
[1:22:01] they were made to feel special that's
[1:22:04] just something on a finite schedule how
[1:22:07] much greater with our Heavenly Father
[1:22:09] how that he's able to so minister to you
[1:22:12] and I that you and I could walk out of
[1:22:14] this service stand right in that parking
[1:22:15] on say hey did you hear this my one this
[1:22:17] Samantha yeah that was really good and
[1:22:19] there's something else that you've
[1:22:20] tucked away in your heart and then hit
[1:22:23] something God has come right by each and
[1:22:25] every one and lets you know you're
[1:22:27] special to me you're special
[1:22:36] notice what I've said now that is
[1:22:38] perfect oneness God and His creation God
[1:22:42] speaking lip to hear with Adam and Eve
[1:22:45] and they were so perfect in harmony with
[1:22:47] God till they were worn with God God and
[1:22:51] his family was one any man and his
[1:22:55] family a correct good noble obedient
[1:22:59] family is one with another any family
[1:23:04] and if there's something in the family
[1:23:07] that moves them apart then it's not
[1:23:10] right
[1:23:11] the family's broken somewhere now I'm
[1:23:15] not gonna elaborate on this part today
[1:23:17] but if you'll notice the discernment of
[1:23:19] the world narrows down not upon that of
[1:23:21] the family but it narrows down on what
[1:23:24] is the root
[1:23:27] what's the problem what's because what
[1:23:31] is it that's driving the family apart
[1:23:34] let's deal with that many times that's
[1:23:38] the thing that needs to be dealt with
[1:23:40] all of these other eruptions on the
[1:23:42] surface and you need to do this and stop
[1:23:44] doing that those are surface eruptions
[1:23:46] of problems that lie much deeper that's
[1:23:49] the truth it we don't want to work on
[1:23:52] suffering surface eruptions it's like
[1:23:54] trying to put caps on things it's like
[1:23:56] trying to blow out fires you know when
[1:23:57] they have those wildfires they don't go
[1:23:59] around trying to put out every little
[1:24:00] fire they want to go to where that
[1:24:02] source is at and they first of all want
[1:24:04] to keep it so it ain't spreading no more
[1:24:06] they first of all stop the spreading of
[1:24:09] it then they begin to go through and
[1:24:12] they knock out each one of them they'll
[1:24:14] put that border up where they'll
[1:24:15] actually lay that water down so it ain't
[1:24:17] gonna go no further you know that's the
[1:24:19] first thing to where you start at there
[1:24:21] might be something don't let the devil
[1:24:22] beat you up and over the head the thing
[1:24:25] you need to start on and say look
[1:24:26] there's things are separate I may not
[1:24:28] understand it may not know it I'm not
[1:24:30] going to look at it and say it's their
[1:24:31] fault this fault that fault
[1:24:33] but first of all let's unite together
[1:24:35] and let's get some water laid down here
[1:24:38] so it don't spread no further that's
[1:24:42] where it all starts what is that that in
[1:24:45] itself is uniting together so it don't
[1:24:48] affect no one else before you ever get
[1:24:54] it contained that's the first place to
[1:24:56] start boy mama hallelujah they should
[1:25:02] all be one father with mother mother
[1:25:07] with father children with parent and
[1:25:12] parent with children my goodness it's so
[1:25:15] hard for me not to preach this quote
[1:25:17] right here this morning but if I do I
[1:25:19] end up reaching things there's it's
[1:25:21] because all of this unity this is what
[1:25:24] should be this unity it's not just
[1:25:27] children being one with the parent but
[1:25:29] the parent is to be one with the child
[1:25:31] it's not just mother being one with
[1:25:34] father but father's to be one with
[1:25:36] mother this is Ephesians 5 submitting
[1:25:38] you
[1:25:39] selves to one another in the fear of God
[1:25:52] hyung just believe this I know this to
[1:25:54] be a fact this was demonstrated right
[1:25:56] here right through our prophets life it
[1:25:59] wasn't just something was demonstrated
[1:26:01] through the Lord Jesus right here there
[1:26:03] are things that we could go right
[1:26:04] through but I can't go that way this
[1:26:06] morning of how that these things in
[1:26:08] order to bring agreement and to bring
[1:26:10] unity notice they should all be one
[1:26:12] father with mother mother with father
[1:26:14] children with parent parent with
[1:26:16] children all in agreement and when you
[1:26:21] see that you'll see one lovely picture
[1:26:29] so the picture notice what people see is
[1:26:33] the unity that lays beneath the surface
[1:26:38] or the disunity that's God's purpose you
[1:26:49] believe that
[1:26:50] that's God's purpose and his purpose as
[1:26:53] father supreme was to be one with this
[1:26:55] family earthly family Adam and Eve and
[1:26:58] the only way that they could be one with
[1:27:01] the family or with God was because God's
[1:27:03] nature was in them let me just stop
[1:27:06] right here is the Spirit of God presses
[1:27:08] on my heart do not allow yourself to set
[1:27:11] there in that manner and say oh there's
[1:27:13] this there's this disunity there's this
[1:27:15] disunity but rather allow your heart to
[1:27:17] be united with the word and say I
[1:27:20] believe that is God's purpose and I
[1:27:23] believe that's God's desire for my life
[1:27:26] for my marriage from my home for my
[1:27:28] children stand upon that word don't you
[1:27:31] give the devil one ounce or one part of
[1:27:34] a ground to stand on you stand upon your
[1:27:36] god-given rights these are your
[1:27:39] god-given rights the Holy Spirit is not
[1:27:42] putting and pointing and putting us down
[1:27:44] but he's showing what belongs to you and
[1:27:47] I
[1:27:48] man and it is by the power of Almighty
[1:27:51] God that God desires and will and is
[1:27:54] manifesting his word oma the only way
[1:27:59] that they could be one with the family
[1:28:01] or with God was because God's nature was
[1:28:05] in them so that made them with God's
[1:28:08] nature in them than each other with God
[1:28:10] they all they become all one so God's
[1:28:13] nature dwelling on the inside bounnam
[1:28:16] says isn't that a beautiful picture once
[1:28:18] again
[1:28:19] picture picture this isn't God was in
[1:28:24] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:28:29] John 1 I believe it's John 1 15 or 17
[1:28:32] one of them right after says the Word
[1:28:34] was made flesh and dwelt among us it
[1:28:35] says and we beheld the only begotten of
[1:28:37] the Father full of glory full of truth
[1:28:40] and full of grace and then it goes on to
[1:28:42] say that he that through that of the
[1:28:44] only beloved that him he hath declared
[1:28:47] the father that word declared means for
[1:28:51] narrow manifests who make known openly
[1:28:54] reveal it's a picture in that wonderful
[1:28:59] what God does in secret Matthew 6 what
[1:29:05] the wanton be man who enters in and
[1:29:07] praise the father who sees and heareth
[1:29:10] and secret come on friends that little
[1:29:14] room is not a place here in this country
[1:29:16] that little room is that in Christ where
[1:29:19] the word itself and the anointing the
[1:29:22] presence of God is upon that word oh my
[1:29:25] that same living God
[1:29:27] right here among us to unite us with him
[1:29:32] amen glory be to God think of this a
[1:29:36] beautiful picture something that is so
[1:29:40] reserved within our hearts but he said I
[1:29:44] will openly make it known oh brother
[1:29:51] brems says isn't that a beautiful
[1:29:53] picture
[1:29:54] God in his family father over all
[1:29:57] supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches
[1:30:01] no nothing just joy unspeakable never to
[1:30:04] be sick
[1:30:05] never to be heartache I think that's
[1:30:07] what they were singing about that pay
[1:30:09] day you're awake right where they sing
[1:30:12] that special this morning when they sung
[1:30:14] about the payday send me a little time
[1:30:17] said waiting man I just got paid this
[1:30:18] Wednesday am I getting paid again this
[1:30:22] I'm talking about a real payday I'm on a
[1:30:27] real one
[1:30:28] no revita God never to be sick never to
[1:30:33] have a heartache just one with God and
[1:30:37] him again he says it what a picture
[1:30:40] because the very nature of God was in
[1:30:43] these people and therefore what they did
[1:30:46] they followed just in line with God and
[1:30:50] God with them made them one now let's
[1:30:55] move ahead to John 17 verse 17 and we
[1:31:01] look here we find the Lord Jesus here in
[1:31:04] intercessory prayer because truly
[1:31:07] there's never been any other greater
[1:31:10] unity then when God Himself came down
[1:31:16] and become one of us where that the word
[1:31:23] was made flesh and dwelt among us the
[1:31:27] greatest uniting heaven and earth
[1:31:29] embraced greatest uniting that took
[1:31:33] place oh my now watch watch what takes
[1:31:40] place of how that here the Lord Jesus
[1:31:43] he's in prayer and this prayer itself it
[1:31:49] comes to a place of intercession he
[1:31:53] recognizes that his time the purpose and
[1:31:56] verse 1 of where of his purpose upon the
[1:31:59] earth it's time now that it must be
[1:32:03] glorified so he recognizes his purpose
[1:32:06] now watch this here is the purpose
[1:32:08] that's coming and in the midst of it
[1:32:10] he's asking he's interceding on our
[1:32:13] behalf there's one request that he's
[1:32:16] going to make and that's I want their
[1:32:20] fellowship I want their fellowship you
[1:32:27] know what that was that was the same
[1:32:30] heart of God before there was Adam
[1:32:34] Stardust or molecule that wanted
[1:32:38] fellowship God just didn't want to talk
[1:32:42] to people but remember he had a
[1:32:44] closeness with these people these
[1:32:46] disciples were right around him but yet
[1:32:49] that was not true unity that was not
[1:32:55] restoring what had fallen in Eden that
[1:32:57] wasn't yet yet it had to be one where he
[1:33:01] would lay his life down in order that
[1:33:04] his life might come back upon us that we
[1:33:09] might be unified with him and the father
[1:33:12] so one great principle though it's not
[1:33:16] wrote here but it is wrote here that
[1:33:20] unity itself is not something that comes
[1:33:26] without a sacrifice unity comes by
[1:33:33] sacrifice and the only way it can be a
[1:33:39] sacrifice before he was ever put on
[1:33:41] Calvary's tree the sacrifice the lamb
[1:33:46] was already crucified right here his
[1:33:50] will was crucified to the will before he
[1:33:55] ever said anything out of his mouth it
[1:33:57] was already right here
[1:34:00] he was unified he was not notice his
[1:34:03] desire to be one it wasn't that he
[1:34:05] didn't love his brother and the Prophet
[1:34:07] tells us this
[1:34:08] he loved his brother he loved the
[1:34:10] fellowship with them he said he didn't
[1:34:12] want to go he loved the sunsets like you
[1:34:14] and I love the sunset but he real
[1:34:17] in order for his brethren to be one with
[1:34:21] him that he must pay the price that his
[1:34:26] life might come back in you and I that
[1:34:31] would be real oneness and through that
[1:34:33] oneness right there we have the
[1:34:36] expectation that's soon and very soon we
[1:34:39] will be united with our Lord Jesus
[1:34:42] Christ by the moving of this king inside
[1:34:47] of us a king inside of us that manifests
[1:34:50] that how everything else that was tried
[1:34:53] everything else that was done yet
[1:34:55] nothing could overcome that first birth
[1:34:57] but the king himself let it be known
[1:35:00] that I have overcome and you have
[1:35:04] overcome and that manifestation of the
[1:35:07] king
[1:35:08] manifesting his victory through our life
[1:35:11] when he becomes incarnate to us we will
[1:35:14] crown him the king of kings and the Lord
[1:35:19] of lords Nebuchadnezzar was a king of
[1:35:24] kings but he was not V what's this
[1:35:32] prayer for unity verse 17 sanctify him
[1:35:40] through that truth thy Word is truth
[1:35:50] in a powerful unity itself
[1:35:54] it begins with word in the very
[1:35:58] beginning God looked upon the darkness
[1:36:02] the bleak condition God said let there
[1:36:08] be light and when he spoke the Spirit of
[1:36:14] God Ruach went out and brother Brad
[1:36:17] remember how brother Branham dramatizes
[1:36:18] it when that word went forth
[1:36:20] he said that dove of the Holy Spirit its
[1:36:22] wings came around this earth and it
[1:36:25] begin to brood and COO over it
[1:36:28] who you see what that word did it was
[1:36:34] cooing to bring forth what he had called
[1:36:40] for the light was needed to bring into
[1:36:45] manifestation what he already had sown
[1:36:50] autumn mercy you can preach
[1:36:52] predestination all the way through these
[1:36:54] scriptures here amen
[1:36:56] God didn't plant the seed in you and on
[1:36:59] this generation it was like that was
[1:37:02] needed to bring the seed that he had
[1:37:05] already found in you and I and the light
[1:37:09] coming upon the seed it brings forth and
[1:37:12] because what was already there he could
[1:37:18] say I already knew you you thought this
[1:37:20] and you thought that what's he done he
[1:37:22] is by perfect love dismantling all fear
[1:37:27] or if I can only make it only make it he
[1:37:31] has already made it and you are in him
[1:37:34] by predestination the life has come to
[1:37:38] you and that cast you into the body how
[1:37:41] can you miss it you've seen your day and
[1:37:46] it's message you recognize the program
[1:37:51] of God and your part within it nobody
[1:37:55] can take that away from you you don't
[1:37:57] matter how many websites come up you
[1:37:58] don't matter how many things come away
[1:38:00] head-on
[1:38:01] another one thing to do with it I have
[1:38:03] found him and the reality is he has
[1:38:08] found me and if it hadn't been for that
[1:38:13] gene on the inside I wouldn't have been
[1:38:15] found forgive me for comparing us to a
[1:38:20] dog but Caleb Caleb means dog and you
[1:38:24] know they microchip them dogs you know
[1:38:25] they ask you you want to microchip your
[1:38:27] dog that way if your dog ever gets taken
[1:38:29] they can you know do this little scanner
[1:38:31] and they have no collar on it it might
[1:38:35] look like you don't belong to nobody
[1:38:36] honey let's take this in and make it a
[1:38:38] good member you don't belong nowhere and
[1:38:40] all of a sudden there comes a scanner
[1:38:41] across it this belongs to so-and-so you
[1:38:47] mean the same I don't know it belongs
[1:38:50] over here
[1:38:50] there was already a chip a seed by
[1:38:55] virtue of predestination that was
[1:38:57] already sown in your life it had his
[1:39:01] name inscripted in the water to be
[1:39:03] manifested this generation and when the
[1:39:07] light of God came across you recognize
[1:39:11] I'm not just here I'm not just a member
[1:39:14] I was not just a duck I'm not a chicken

[1:39:21] greater claim upon your life light
[1:39:28] manifest what he's already placed there

[1:39:39] scriptures can we do that

[1:39:54] of Lord help me come on your breach but
[1:39:56] oh ma let's let's just move here just a
[1:39:58] little bit as thou has sent me into the
[1:40:01] world even so have I also sent them into
[1:40:06] the world he knows as the father has
[1:40:10] sent me so I am gonna send you the
[1:40:15] father that sent him went in him in the
[1:40:22] wonderful train up a child in the way
[1:40:23] that he should go and when he grows old
[1:40:27] he will not depart from it Peter did not
[1:40:32] depart from it what was and it was the
[1:40:37] life that was there behind what Jonas
[1:40:39] was saying concerning Deuteronomy 18:15
[1:40:42] it was the life it was not the voice of
[1:40:45] Jonas it was God's voice divine grace
[1:40:49] that was rolling off of that promise and
[1:40:51] Rome and Jonas heart that he moved and
[1:40:54] made an imprint upon Peters heart let me
[1:41:03] tell you something
[1:41:04] God's Word can't fail it will not return
[1:41:09] back to him void and for their sakes
[1:41:16] look at this verse 19 and for their
[1:41:20] sakes I sanctify myself
[1:41:28] he didn't st. if I self because of
[1:41:30] himself he sanctify himself for their
[1:41:34] sakes we could stop right here and just
[1:41:38] say lord help us in our homes right here
[1:41:43] in the church let us live lives
[1:41:45] sanctified for others that God might
[1:41:50] move for others it's not about oh boy
[1:41:54] they need this or no no it's I want to
[1:41:57] be
[1:41:57] available don't you want to be available
[1:42:06] as for their sakes i sanctify myself
[1:42:08] that they also might be sanctified
[1:42:12] through the truth watch this moving the
[1:42:16] precious ointment moving down through
[1:42:19] upon the face the beard coming down the
[1:42:23] body that they might be sanctified let
[1:42:26] me tell you something
[1:42:27] sanctification if I could say it right
[1:42:30] it's contagious contagious yeah you live
[1:42:38] a sanctified life it'll affect
[1:42:39] everything around your home now you
[1:42:43] might say brother Simon I don't have TV
[1:42:44] we don't have TV we don't have cable we
[1:42:46] don't have this and that's all fine and
[1:42:48] good but even in the sanctification of
[1:42:49] your attitude
[1:42:52] it's effectual it catches it catches
[1:42:57] because God is able to work through that
[1:42:59] and that's our whole objective is that
[1:43:02] God might be able to work and why do we
[1:43:04] do it know we could say it I could say
[1:43:06] this or I could put this point in or I
[1:43:07] could say but for others you love him
[1:43:19] verse 20 don't think I'm not gonna read
[1:43:24] the rest of the chapter verse 20 neither
[1:43:30] pray I for these alone us for no more
[1:43:36] no no but for them also which shall
[1:43:41] believe on me through their word
[1:43:47] you know this confidence was is that I
[1:43:50] word your word my word is not going to
[1:43:52] be my word in your word
[1:43:53] it'll be his word but remember once his
[1:43:56] word is given for you and me it's our
[1:43:58] word when God said in the beginning I
[1:44:02] will give her see and the Prophet picks
[1:44:05] it up in the message oneness he said the
[1:44:07] woman has no seed but once God gives it
[1:44:10] to her it then is her see hallelujah
[1:44:16] this is my message this is your message
[1:44:22] they men the Holy Ghost is mine the only
[1:44:26] ghost is yours the rapture is mine the
[1:44:31] rapture is yours he's given it to me and
[1:44:36] we are one with him what the Spirit has
[1:44:40] said the prophecy and the bride says the
[1:44:45] same thing the Spirit believe on me
[1:44:54] through their word oh Jesus you're so
[1:44:59] wonderful in in wonderful God gives
[1:45:03] signs and wonders to accompany his word
[1:45:06] because there might be and we might we
[1:45:08] need to know how God will show up
[1:45:11] sometimes you read it all through the
[1:45:12] book of Acts if God were to help some of
[1:45:14] those people said I'm telling you what
[1:45:15] Paul's preach to you if you don't
[1:45:17] believe what Paul said tough but look of
[1:45:20] God's mercy God would come around and
[1:45:22] heal someone so that the governor would
[1:45:24] open up to Paul and hear what he had to
[1:45:26] say
[1:45:28] and we taste something God visiting this
[1:45:30] generation for you and I it's more it
[1:45:33] was more than signs and wonders it
[1:45:35] brought to a reality to us as the bride
[1:45:38] of Jesus Christ that he is here not in
[1:45:41] corporal form but he is here in the
[1:45:45] person of Christ his word it identifies
[1:45:50] us aware that we are what does he do
[1:45:52] by the things that you and I cannot see
[1:45:55] when it says you were at a clinic and
[1:45:58] you read a clinic and this and that and
[1:45:59] so forth and all these things and isn't
[1:46:01] that the truth thus saith the Lord
[1:46:02] you're healed you see you and I were at
[1:46:04] the clinic you and I couldn't see that
[1:46:06] you and I weren't fair I'm let me see
[1:46:08] who can I ask were you there let me see
[1:46:10] we'll get an investigation was this was
[1:46:12] this true was this all here you and I
[1:46:14] don't do that but look what it is you
[1:46:16] and I can see it did we not see it God
[1:46:19] even allowed one to be recorded on deep
[1:46:21] call to thee
[1:46:22] you and I can see those things what was
[1:46:24] that for that our faith in what you and
[1:46:26] I cannot see becoming material that our
[1:46:30] faith would be in this word that God has
[1:46:33] promised that that same word is becoming
[1:46:36] material in you and me because as the
[1:46:42] prophet said he said this is greater
[1:46:45] than the vision perfect faith perfect
[1:46:49] faith this is greater than the vision
[1:46:51] because he said that vision says
[1:46:53] something that's contrary to this we
[1:46:55] take this but you see what he's showing
[1:46:57] in perfect faith he's showing us the
[1:46:59] whole purpose of the ministry was to
[1:47:02] place our faith return it back return it
[1:47:07] back to the Apostolic fathers not some
[1:47:12] new thing that started no this is the
[1:47:14] finishing remember what precious
[1:47:16] ointment was on the head flows all the
[1:47:18] way down to the Bible says the skirts
[1:47:23] means the end
[1:47:30] I felt like I opened the can of sardines
[1:47:34] about this big and this thing's turned
[1:47:36] into a 55-gallon drum up here honey even
[1:47:40] got to any where we're going I just
[1:47:43] notice here here's the purpose notice
[1:47:45] that they might believe on me through
[1:47:47] their work notice the purpose of the
[1:47:49] word going forth notice the effects that
[1:47:52] it will bring that they may be one
[1:47:55] that's the work of the ministry there is
[1:47:59] only one ministry and that's the
[1:48:02] Ministry of Jesus Christ through the
[1:48:05] seven churches the work of the ministry
[1:48:08] it's God's work to unify us in faith
[1:48:11] it's God's work to perfect you and I
[1:48:14] it's God's work that you and I come unto
[1:48:16] the full statue of a perfect man it's
[1:48:19] God's work that they may be one as thou
[1:48:26] father art in me and I in thee see
[1:48:33] here's what would happen those that
[1:48:35] would just stay there and say oh my God
[1:48:38] was in Christ
[1:48:39] I know God manifest himself in that body
[1:48:42] but if they don't go on and receive the
[1:48:44] Holy Ghost they miss their day of
[1:48:46] visitation they fail to understand what
[1:48:49] has been manifest before them
[1:48:52] do you realize here here in the third
[1:48:54] pull opening of a Ministry of the Lord
[1:48:56] Jesus you know the first and second pool
[1:48:58] there was and there was that of the
[1:48:59] secrets of the hearts that were made
[1:49:01] known there were there were many
[1:49:02] diseases many things that were healed
[1:49:04] but here in the third in the opening of
[1:49:06] the third pool of his ministry John 6 he
[1:49:08] begins to sit down and you begin to find
[1:49:10] a weeding out and then has it continues
[1:49:12] to move on that third pole is coming
[1:49:14] into a place where the Ministry of the
[1:49:17] Lord Jesus is coming to the time of
[1:49:19] where the offering up and then through
[1:49:21] the crucifixion then through the
[1:49:23] resurrection he makes himself known to
[1:49:25] the disciples what's he doing he's
[1:49:27] gathering them to the promise by the
[1:49:29] promise and he's gathering them so that
[1:49:32] the promise now might be made manifest
[1:49:35] in them see not just to him in him
[1:49:41] not just to them but in them it's not
[1:49:45] just looking at the message but it's to
[1:49:47] have the message in you and you and it
[1:49:48] not enough to talk about the token is to
[1:49:54] get under it has thou father art in me
[1:50:00] and I in thee this is the kind of
[1:50:03] oneness not goodness how many times you
[1:50:12] hear brother Branham say over and over
[1:50:13] he said when people say I've got the
[1:50:15] Holy Ghost and he says that what spirit
[1:50:17] you have in you won't cope with the word
[1:50:18] how is that the Holy Ghost you see if
[1:50:22] you've got the Spirit of Christ within
[1:50:24] you remember he's in the father the
[1:50:27] father's in him you're in him and he is
[1:50:29] in you there is a unity so the Spirit of
[1:50:33] God does not break unity with the word
[1:50:37] alright notice that they also may be one
[1:50:41] in us that the world may believe that
[1:50:45] thou has sent me haha one enough see
[1:50:48] there's a plurality no that's just a
[1:50:50] lack of understanding on your part the
[1:50:52] reality is that Christ Himself is the
[1:50:55] manifested word and that manifested word
[1:50:59] is the father he is the word revealed
[1:51:02] from word to flesh it is the same
[1:51:07] because it is the same nature I am God
[1:51:10] and I changed not when he said I have
[1:51:13] come in my father's name the same
[1:51:17] character that the world
[1:51:21] why-why that the world may believe that
[1:51:25] thou has sent me so us being one
[1:51:29] together with him is a testimony he's
[1:51:33] come and he's coming
[1:51:38] he's come you weren't allowed to laugh
[1:51:40] 2,000 years ago no but he come that he
[1:51:44] might come in me and he came to me that
[1:51:46] he might come for me 3 comings that the
[1:51:55] world may believe you see your life your
[1:51:58] life my life is a testimony of His grace
[1:52:02] trophies of His grace
[1:52:07] remember here's the picture that the
[1:52:09] world may see verse 22 I'm coming down
[1:52:18] prepare for landing
[1:52:22] and the glory look at this and the glory
[1:52:26] which thou gavest me I have given there
[1:52:37] was nothing about self here
[1:52:39] nothing about self it's about you and me
[1:52:42] what you've given me
[1:52:44] the glory why that they may be one even
[1:52:52] as we are one you know what I'm seeing
[1:52:55] over and over here unity comes by
[1:52:59] sacrifice it comes by giving oh brother
[1:53:03] Samuel I've got a hundred dollar bill
[1:53:05] that's wonderful raise your hand we'll
[1:53:07] collect it put in the mission fun
[1:53:09] offering but I ain't talking about that
[1:53:10] kind of giving you can give all that and
[1:53:14] give everything else and you miss the
[1:53:15] principle part that God wants you to
[1:53:16] give God wants us to give of our lives
[1:53:20] and keep giving of our lives and the
[1:53:23] real giving of our lives requires us
[1:53:25] dying day later that they may be one
[1:53:30] even as we are one I in them and thou in
[1:53:33] me that they may be made perfect in one
[1:53:38] that the world may know that thou has
[1:53:43] sent me
[1:53:44] and has loved them that the world may
[1:53:55] know that you have sent me and that thou
[1:53:58] has loved them as thou hast loved me he
[1:54:10] loves you with the same kind of love the
[1:54:18] same no I'm on a boat this morning he
[1:54:20] loves you the same way he loves you the
[1:54:25] same way there's no storm that can sink
[1:54:29] your boat you with me all the Devils in
[1:54:40] hell
[1:54:40] canna sail against you but his love
[1:54:45] notice it's something that is seen
[1:54:50] friends I just say it like this don't
[1:54:54] let don't let the devil make a union or
[1:55:00] what is thought to be a union that you
[1:55:03] come to this church that's not a union
[1:55:06] with Christ I know brother Evans a
[1:55:09] prophet that's not a union with Christ
[1:55:12] and I you know I believe that the
[1:55:16] message is true that's not a union with
[1:55:17] Christ don't I'm just from my heart
[1:55:21] don't just take an association when you
[1:55:27] have access to the full promise
[1:55:31] you see there's no excuse to say I can't
[1:55:35] live a victorious life I agree with you
[1:55:37] but you let him who is the victor
[1:55:40] come on the inside and he'll live his
[1:55:43] victory through you he'll manifest that
[1:55:46] you are the victory of Calvary the
[1:55:52] reason that he went the reason that he
[1:55:55] come the reason that he would send his
[1:55:57] word even in this hour this is God's
[1:56:00] desire for unity a oneness think of how
[1:56:06] but the Lord Jesus himself would say it
[1:56:08] a new commandment I write unto you that
[1:56:12] you would love one another once you
[1:56:17] think of this a new commandment it
[1:56:22] wasn't a new commandment in the sense
[1:56:24] that God had not already said that in
[1:56:26] the commandments but God was releasing
[1:56:29] what was needed in order to do that
[1:56:34] because this is not our love it's his
[1:56:39] love we love one another with his love
[1:56:43] and showing that that in itself comes
[1:56:46] forth when Paul can even write in
[1:56:49] Ephesians 5 of the unity between a
[1:56:52] husband and wife he does not say
[1:56:54] husbands figlio your wives but he says
[1:56:58] agapo that's higher than our figlio how
[1:57:03] can that be if agapo is not in US and
[1:57:05] we're not in a gobble it must be the
[1:57:10] love of God within us and the love of
[1:57:15] God in us it triumphs
[1:57:17] it perseveres it takes a valuation of
[1:57:22] situations to recognize that the way
[1:57:25] that I handle this situation there's
[1:57:28] little eyes watching me and it's not
[1:57:32] that we're doing it because of little
[1:57:33] eyes watching us because the truth be
[1:57:35] known whether you got little eyes around
[1:57:37] you or not you got his eyes
[1:57:39] and whether you do it or not his I see
[1:57:42] here and so we want to walk pleasing to
[1:57:51] the Lord we want to make sure there's a
[1:57:54] union to where that character
[1:57:55] it's a molding and a shaping that our
[1:57:59] arrow is not going through air like this
[1:58:03] we want to make sure it's such a unity
[1:58:07] that that character can be molded if God
[1:58:12] did not become one of us
[1:58:13] then you and I could never be born again
[1:58:17] and without being born again we could
[1:58:20] never have our character molded to match
[1:58:24] his own glorious character unity
[1:58:28] precedes character but when unity has
[1:58:33] come then character starts being built
[1:58:38] character comes forth and you know what
[1:58:40] what's needed in order to hold these
[1:58:42] fletchings right in place God moves in
[1:58:45] our life moves in our life you know God
[1:58:49] allows circumstances to come in our life
[1:58:52] to Humble us
[1:58:54] I mean know that
[1:59:00] sometimes of old mind what I've got so
[1:59:02] much humility right there that's pride
[1:59:09] but God God knows just what to do so we
[1:59:12] have the right drag it's not gonna be
[1:59:15] head over heels flying straight to the
[1:59:18] prize suppose salmon he's got his work
[1:59:21] cut out for him I know I know we and we
[1:59:25] know that too but you know what greater
[1:59:28] is He that is in us then he that's in
[1:59:32] the world so when you look at that and
[1:59:34] you bring it down into the home you
[1:59:36] bring it down for your marriage you
[1:59:38] bring it down for your children
[1:59:39] don't try to start working on well I'm
[1:59:41] gonna work on her and I'm gonna work on
[1:59:43] him and we really need to work on these
[1:59:45] children stop
[1:59:48] unity first unity first and then unity
[1:59:54] will actually bring the effect of the
[1:59:58] training the teaching the molding how
[2:00:02] many heard that the Prophet how many
[2:00:03] heard the Prophet tells us in the
[2:00:05] message token he said when that token is
[2:00:07] applied he said speak to him in love he
[2:00:11] said they long to hear you say something
[2:00:13] to them I asked what is that
[2:00:19] that's Christ Christ in you Christ in me
[2:00:26] it's Christ with love and consideration
[2:00:30] so it first starts with unity unity
[2:00:33] let's just stop here is unity important
[2:00:38] sure is very very very important but
[2:00:43] unity in the right way in the right way
[2:00:47] let's pray Lord Jesus
[2:00:58] I pray father this morning
[2:01:03] or Jesus for the word that you have
[2:01:06] given to us we thank you Lord and father
[2:01:13] Lord from tenderness of our hearts this
[2:01:17] is our request Lord we want to give
[2:01:21] ourselves to this word to you
[2:01:29] mold is Lord Seamus Lord if there's one
[2:01:35] or more whether they're just sitting
[2:01:39] here now new or maybe they've been for
[2:01:42] years or God may there not be one that
[2:01:48] would take for granted the privilege and
[2:01:53] opportunity that you have made available
[2:01:57] that we have been and can be made one
[2:02:01] with you well it's not just one in our
[2:02:06] thinking what's deeper it's where we're
[2:02:09] one from within Lord Jesus I've read
[2:02:17] these statements here Lord that you've
[2:02:20] given to us Lord God here in this hour
[2:02:24] to where Lord within the Dominical world
[2:02:28] in many places they would read this same
[2:02:30] scripture but the Spirit of God picks it
[2:02:33] up in this hour showing that this is the
[2:02:37] only program that you've laid down the
[2:02:39] program of God that we would be one but
[2:02:42] it is not as men would so think and try
[2:02:46] to order it it's not just coming
[2:02:51] together as a group of churches that are
[2:02:54] bound together we realize the Lord that
[2:02:55] that very thought itself is also moved
[2:02:57] by a spirit binding the tears together
[2:03:01] for the burning
[2:03:04] but Lord God the people of God have
[2:03:07] always been and are united by the
[2:03:14] promise of God down through the ages
[2:03:18] Lord as your children has been and are
[2:03:23] united by the promise of your coming
[2:03:28] waiting for your coming Lord Jesus I
[2:03:34] pray this morning may there not be one
[2:03:38] young or old that God would place their
[2:03:42] refuge in this church they take that
[2:03:46] Lord as the old that that's a unity no
[2:03:50] it's the Lord God wonderful to be able
[2:03:54] to Lord to come among the order body of
[2:03:57] believers in people Lord God that would
[2:03:59] love you and pray for you and care for
[2:04:00] you
[2:04:01] the Lord God may may they realize the
[2:04:03] Lord God that in order for there to be a
[2:04:04] real true unity Lord that is for you to
[2:04:07] be in them or maybe some of them Lord
[2:04:11] God leave things of the world they can
[2:04:13] look at and they can say why I no longer
[2:04:15] drink I no no there's smoke and I no
[2:04:16] longer run around and I no longer do
[2:04:18] this then Lord God is that you that is
[2:04:22] the heartbeat of their life is it you
[2:04:25] the one that they crave and they long
[2:04:27] for that they delight in Lord is it you
[2:04:31] that they desire to please or God not
[2:04:36] just have they been where they no longer
[2:04:37] do these things but are you the all and
[2:04:40] the Sun and the theme and the desire and
[2:04:42] the delight of their life Lord God to
[2:04:44] where it is about you to where when
[2:04:47] people meet them
[2:04:48] people talk with them Lord God they know
[2:04:51] that Jesus Christ is the theme of their
[2:04:53] life Lord we're not talking about
[2:04:56] doctrine we're not you're not talking
[2:04:58] about somebody being able to explain
[2:05:00] this and laid this out in the scripture
[2:05:02] that's not what we're talking about
[2:05:03] we're talking about a life where Paul
[2:05:07] could say when Christ who is our life
[2:05:13] when he shall appear we shall be like
[2:05:17] him what I pray if there's one here this
[2:05:21] morning that would desire that Lord
[2:05:24] because that's your desire I pray this
[2:05:27] morning the Lord God as they would make
[2:05:29] it nook known by an uplifted hand Lord
[2:05:31] and say Lord I want to be united and I
[2:05:35] want the Holy Spirit down in the depths
[2:05:38] of my soul amen god bless you god bless
[2:05:43] those hands I don't want to be just one
[2:05:48] who is associated because I know that
[2:05:50] just being around this church that's not
[2:05:52] enough I must be baptized by one spirit
[2:05:57] into one body and if the question is
[2:06:00] arising in your heart right now here is
[2:06:04] what you yield to you first repent for
[2:06:08] maybe someone who's new repent
[2:06:11] acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as
[2:06:13] your Savior Lord forgive me of my sins
[2:06:16] and Lord Jesus I accept you as my savior
[2:06:20] and the next part of that step coming
[2:06:23] together is to be baptized in the name
[2:06:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ that baptism is
[2:06:30] not identifying you with this church
[2:06:32] here it's identifying you with your
[2:06:37] sacrifice that you are witnessing he is
[2:06:41] my Savior the Lord Jesus Christ to be
[2:06:47] baptized for the remission of your sins
[2:06:49] the remission means the loosening as one
[2:06:53] who is set free that I'm no longer gonna
[2:06:57] be walking underneath this sin bear oh
[2:06:59] my you might say brother Samuel I've
[2:07:02] known the Lord for many years I now be
[2:07:05] careful I'm not asking if you know about
[2:07:07] him I'm asking do you know him what the
[2:07:10] call of the Holy Spirit is is that do
[2:07:12] you know him do you serve Him
[2:07:15] or are you just acquainted with him
[2:07:18] don't just be acquainted with him be one
[2:07:21] with
[2:07:23] let him flow down through every avenue
[2:07:26] of your life and the last part of that
[2:07:29] is you shall receive the gift of the
[2:07:34] Holy Ghost his life that has been
[2:07:39] calling you and working in your life to
[2:07:42] draw you to repentance that has moved
[2:07:45] within your life to even open you to
[2:07:47] this place of which that you would even
[2:07:49] surrender right now you yielding to that
[2:07:51] life the Holy Spirit himself and then he
[2:07:55] moves down into the depth of your life
[2:07:58] to receive you in him what grace what
[2:08:04] grace I wonder this morning let me just
[2:08:09] invite you may be this morning you've
[2:08:11] not walked into the waters of baptism
[2:08:13] would there be any that would be willing
[2:08:15] and desire to say I want to be baptized
[2:08:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:23] okay god bless that hand god bless you
[2:08:29] sister amen I wonder if there's one here
[2:08:32] as we raise those hands ago you say I
[2:08:35] want that Union in my life now you
[2:08:39] believe it don't just raise your hand
[2:08:41] it's not just raising your hand with a
[2:08:42] hope so remember this is for you of how
[2:08:47] the Holy Spirit would take and direct
[2:08:48] these things to come in this moment of
[2:08:51] an open invitation this is God's grace
[2:08:54] ministered personally to you this
[2:08:57] morning

[2:09:15] this is for me and I ask the rest of you
