can't find no success nowhere and just as I gave up uh the job came to me almost like a whim so I went there and and I got there I said well I was just through an agency and after like a month or two working the bosses said we needed someone so they quickly bought my time out from the agency and took me in and they came to me the the my boss says I don't have a spot for you he said I'm going to make one wow and so then he went he he went to the plant manager he came he showed me around and says I we don't have a spot I'm going to create one for you so okay so then his boss is the owner so he went to them and uh through God's intervention I was able to land the job shortly last month eight years and so there's been many blessings that God has G me favor with the bosses and with the

us Amen in our walk with the Lord and so uh well I don't want to take any any time away from the word of God we were our hearts were so edified here on Friday night and um yes sir you know sometimes we you know you come away from a service and you know it's just it's so precious to just be able to meditate on the things of God and what God was saying because there's so many times that there's things that the Lord is is saying and and we it's never based on our um our our mind to be able to capture everything but just to meditate on the things that has been said things that struck our heart and I think of the scripture and how the the Holy Spirit took that on on Friday night and how they had toiled all night and there's a lot of things you know that we have that's tried to be done to toil brother brandham spoke of that over and over he said sometimes where he says a man can see somebody do something and say I can do that or I remember in when God begin to deal with my heart I thought I could do it I thought I could do it and and you know and you know God let me just say it like this God allows it shows that within it it's not based on our human strength our intellect right and when we can come to that spot to say you know what I'm tired yeah true I'm tired I mean a person who's drowning you know you come to a spot to say I'm tired I'm tired and I never forget as it comes to my heart right now I never forget there in brother Bill's basement that morning and that was what rang in my heart I said I'm tired Glory I couldn't get out of situations I was in I couldn't stop things that I was doing I I couldn't I couldn't do that and I realized that I had come to that but you know even in that I realized that even after God took a hold of my life and what he's done in my life and he did something that nobody no book no anyone could ever do but he came in that that's all that that's all that matters he comes in and I think that's the same way for every need that I've ever had in my life even since that time sometimes we've toiled to make things happen and toiled we felt like this this needs to be done but you know everything has to be in God's time and God is Sovereign yes he is God is Sovereign and the greatest thing that what I've learned is God so conditioned my heart to be sensitive to receive you to recognize you as you're moving that's what I want to be I want to be in that place to where when he's moving and and that's what I think about in this service right here today is God condition our hearts because when the water's troubled I I want to step in I want to step in you know the man who had the the condition brother Bram told us brother Bram actually told us in the message the man could walk right so it wasn't sometimes how things are projected and things on movies and things like that the man could actually walk brother bam said he could have walked but he said notice brother Ram said notice he could walk but he said what it was cuz he said every time I go to get there somebody steps in front of me we thought it was we thought just reading looking at he was helpless he he had to crawl he didn't have to crawl brother BR said he could walk amen but somebody stepped in front of me but you know what God has a has a Divine appointment with every one of us this morning I pray God would help us to just lay aside the cares of the life cuz we can't solve them anyhow God give us Grace to step aside from tiredness and weariness of mind or flesh and let's just enter in let's just enter in this morning and just pull on the gift of God it's such a such a privilege and an honor and I really mean that to have brother Homer he's a he's a good friend and I just to me you know I just appreciate the gift of God and I appreciate brother Homer uh I tell you how you see him in the pool pit that's how he is every time he loves this message with all his heart you go to tamper with it he'll let you know you he'll let you know but I just say you know God may we just pull on the gift of God we all have needs here this morning and I I'll say it like this we we not we can but I'm just going to go ahead and say it we're going to walk out of here different than we came in let's just lay Everything At His Feet this morning he's the mighty conqueror and say Lord you come and do the miraculous right here Among Us in my heart in my life whatever your need is just take God at his word just lay it there before him and just invite him to come Amen brother Josh is so good to have you here with us too amen so as brother Homer

y'all know that now Hallelujah I may not preach good but I sure can saying hallelujah amen but I thought you know it's so good to be in the house of the Lord and it's so good amen that you don't have to question that you got the word of God you know and you know and I I was raised in church all my life just about it you know and and uh you know and so we had this Doctrine and we had this and and I said you know and it's strange how that God Amen he he he opened our eyes amen and and and he enlightened us amen with what he wanted us to have you know this is not what I wanted it's not what you wanted because your whole nature is contrary to it amen amen your whole nature is an enemy to God Amen and can you say Amen sir amen but there was part of me and part of you amen that God was looking at amen you say amen that's the reason I said last night God had this thing rigged we call it predestination for knowledge but God rigged this thing he he amen you wouldn't come on your own he had to come looking for me sir amen and I didn't come just willingly all right amen Jas Jas didn't just come willingly it was a forced issue I'm going preach anyhow on amen so it's a forced issue God forced an issue over J us according to brother bam is that right now I'm going to say brother bam a [Applause] lot amen so I'm not going to worry if you don't like it or not I'm real humbled okay I'm a humble person but I want you to know amen you don't have nothing outside of this message amen Hey listen I read about Paul but I can tell you about brother bham I can amen I read the history of Paul and amen and never knew what Paul was talking about right that's why I was a trinitarian amen because we had no Revelation amen you say oh but my we Pentecostals had it no you didn't no you baptized under regeneration right all right true that's right amen amen so therefore it took this the light of this amen amen to show us what this was you say Amen if you want to look with me this this morning at Mark I don't know if it's evening or morning amen if you want to look at Mark chapter 5 amen and I want to share with you amen and if you ever heard me preach on this before play like you hadn't that's what John le Fontaine used to say amen he said play like you never heard this before amen amen so amen but it just seemed like I couldn't get away from it amen so I'm going to deal with it this morning amen and so we find out this morning in the scripture amen and the Bible said and they came over unto the other side of the Sea of gines and when he was come out of the ship he immediately there excuse me immediately there met him out of the tombs a man of unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no one could bind him no not with chains because he had been often bound with feathers chains and the chains had been plucked aunder by him the feathers broke in pieces and amen neither could any man and tame him and always night and day he was in the Tomb crying to in the Tomb amen and he's cutting himself with stones and but when he saw Jesus a far off he ran to worship him he cried with a loud voice and he said what have I to do with thee Jesus thy son of the most high God are Jew thee by God that thy torment me not for he said unto them come out of thy man the man thy unclean spirit amen but I want you to notice amen I'm not going to read the rest of it but I want you to notice Amen in this story today I want to take a I want to take a thought if I could amen a cry of one Soul as you're seated this morning I want to take a cry of one Soul amen and now now I want you to notice this picture amen now here's a maniac number one number Maniac totally out of his mind am man totally possessed of the devil but his soul was part of God yes his soul was a part of God I already feel his Spirit right now his soul was a spirit of God and all right in all through this thing amen his soul was crying out yeah and brother manam tells us on thinking man's filter he said your soul comes predestinated from God so it was your soul crying out it wasn't you all right amen you amen youd have been happy in the Catholic and the Methodist the Baptist but your soul cried out for the word of God and you say amen amen but I want to tell you something this morning amen amen when Jesus man made his journey amen now Jesus the Bible tells us in this brother benam says he said I I want you to notice amen he said when Jesus heard that cry of that Soul now that Maniac did not welcome Jesus neither did you neither did you amen you presented something to him I might be bad

God River you think are [Music] uncrossable mountain [Applause] you no but God's special [Music] oh when he will do one no other how can do as they play that song Softly I want you just to think about that this morning the holy spirit is here he spoke to our hearts you heard as the as brother Homer said that he said I couldn't get away from this I I know how that feels where there's things that brother Alex you know as well sometimes you just you can't get away sometimes you you don't even have notes for the thoughts you're going to preach you just can't get away from it God just dropped something because ministering is not about the man it's about the needs of the people that's that's what it's all about it's not about preaching there going be many preachers but Ministry is serving it's ministering to the needs of God's people and so when you consider it like brother Homer as he was ministering that I tell you there's there's not one of us can take credit we did not seek God and and and I think tonight even as the word just keeps coming it's all speaking of arrest that it's it's not about you or me it's about God coming on the scene yes sir brother Bram said it I love how he said it in the message if God be with us where be all the Miracles he said at the end of the message in the prayer he said God anything that's been achieved in our in our life it's because you overrode our Rebellion you overrode our Rebellion over and achieved it our desire it's it's trueth brother Bram said I'm not I'm not a Christian by my own desire the longing God put Within Me was that part of himself amen when God come to you come to me God knocking on your life is God recognizing that part that's on the inside I believe God is I I believe that with all my heart God is here to minister he's come and minister to our hearts what he would cross what he would cross what he cross to get to me I I'm just going to say it as plain as I know how I wouldn't have crossed what he had to cross to get to me I couldn't have done it I couldn't have done it he came to a pig pin where I was at where the prodical son was at the angel of the Lord came to the pigin I'm glad he comes right to where we're at and ministers to our need and you know what he comes in there he rolls his sleeves up and it begins to move Upon Our Hearts [Music] we're here because of his grace this morning yes sir I I'll just say it like this if there's any any any tug on your heart this morning sometimes the greatest greatest walk is just that that part that starts out with just saying yes Lord yes [Music] Lord God's that personal and I'll just say this I don't believe there's a need in this building this morning spiritual physical emotional Financial whatever your need is God's already got it covered if you'll just take him at his word remember Friday night these are not these services are connected right together oh the Lord allowed brother Homer to go into that part on nevertheless and that word nevertheless as he went in and defined that for us in spite of my feelings in spite of all the thoughts going through my mind in spite of Satan pointing out all my failures in spite of all that I'm going to take you at your word and I tell you if you can just just take out on that say look I'm not I'm not looking for anything but obedience to the word I'm going to let down the net you watch what God will do for you I'm telling you Church he's in the building this morning oh yeah he's right here this morning you don't have to walk out of here with the needs left unmet in your life God is here this morning to take him at his word he will do beyond what you can ask or think he's that kind of a God he's the only living God there is tired of toiling tired of weighing just say Lord I'm I'm I'm nevertheless in spite of everything I am going to let down the net look Beyond whatever you need to look Beyond whatever whatever failures whatever thing that you see well I see this look beyond that because that's only a distraction that's right that's a scarecrow to try to steal you away from what God is calling you to look beyond that I know what he had to cross to get to me and what he had to cross everybody said you know what give him a month he'll be back out here right his daddy sent him away to a camp got him brainwashed well if it brainwash would have done it then it could have should have done it a long time ago but you know what what it is it isn't serving God is not about Mind Over Matter serving God is about a sovereign God coming by and overriding our own will and turning our heart to him I'll tell you this morning you're a blessed person if your heart has even turned you're a blessed person to say Lord I want you there's a cry within Lord I Want You Lord let me tell you you didn't give yourself that that come from God that's why you didn't find yourself it's God finding himself in you w he wasn't lost but he knew exactly where you are I'm not here to preach I want to encourage you that friends we're right here in his presence yeah it'd be like going to a restaurant and not ordering anything this is a moment it takes just a moment in his presence you some might say Brother Sam I've got a real experience but maybe you've got a need in your life you might say well I just accept it right there in my seat you can but if there is something within that says you know
