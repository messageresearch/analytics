[33:37] fulfilling his word is what makes the

[35:40] amen amen God bless you amen if you turn
[35:44] with us in job 23 and it's so good to
[35:48] good to be back
[35:52] and as Paul said that was his first time
[35:54] flying that he remembered he was a
[35:56] little boy last time real little guy he
[35:59] was able to sit on his mom's lap the
[36:00] last time so he had kind of a baptism by
[36:04] fire this time I almost felt like I was
[36:05] making an overseas trip uh you know you
[36:09] fly to Atlanta and then from Atlanta
[36:10] over to Washington was over five hours
[36:12] on the plane there just from Atlanta to
[36:14] Washington so uh and you know it's not
[36:16] like it used to be you get a a big
[36:19] package of almonds with only three
[36:21] almonds in it and uh you know the
[36:24] napkins this big you know no but uh you
[36:28] know it's just uh little things and uh
[36:31] but we're just thankful to God for his
[36:32] mercy and just thank you for your
[36:34] prayers and I know you I know the Lord
[36:36] was really mindful of us here in a local
[36:39] assembly we were able to tap in when we
[36:41] landed there uh then driving up to where
[36:44] we needed to go two hours north of
[36:47] Seattle and um we were able to stream
[36:51] into the service and uh so that was
[36:53] really wonderful as well and it's pretty
[36:55] neat to hear you all all here the Sunday
[36:57] morning service and then we're just
[36:59] getting ready to go to service over
[37:00] there on Sunday morning so uh we just
[37:03] appreciate amen God's faithfulness and
[37:07] uh when I was listening to brother
[37:09] Nathan uh Minister uh little bits and
[37:12] pieces because I was trying to finish
[37:13] because I had to preach Sunday night and
[37:15] so I was trying to make sure I was ready
[37:17] to go for Sunday night and I was hearing
[37:19] the the thought coming and I thought my
[37:22] goodness it's like what I just preached
[37:24] last night there when we were preaching
[37:26] on the thought of God and that's my you
[37:28] know how mindful God is of our needs and
[37:31] uh my the word has such strength in it
[37:33] for our lives to encourage us I tell you
[37:35] if we ever needed encouragement it's
[37:37] right now and the only and the what's
[37:39] what gives us real courage is the word
[37:41] of God Amen what God knew and what God
[37:44] saw and what he sees in us so I just uh
[37:47] just so thankful for that uh so we want
[37:50] to look here in the word in verse 8 and
[37:53] um I know these scriptures you could
[37:55] probably you've probably uh We've read
[37:57] on them enough you could probably know
[37:59] him by heart now but uh we want to just
[38:01] draw from the thought here we don't want
[38:03] to just know him by thought by memory we
[38:05] want to let let God have an effect on
[38:07] our life amen what he what he desires to
[38:10] bring out of here so in verse eight
[38:12] behold I go forward but he is not there
[38:17] and backward but I cannot perceive him
[38:21] on the left hand where he doth work but
[38:24] I cannot Behold Him and once you to
[38:26] notice job knows he's
[38:29] working he knows that God is
[38:32] working but he says I can't Behold Him I
[38:35] don't know what's taking place right now
[38:37] he hideth himself on the right hand that
[38:40] I cannot see him so that's the
[38:42] manifestations of God I I can't see him
[38:45] but job says from the left hand I know
[38:47] he's working verse 10 but he knoweth the
[38:51] way that I take when he hath tried me I
[38:55] shall come forth as gold I want to
[38:58] really draw from these verses tonight my
[39:01] foot hath held his steps his way have I
[39:05] kept and not
[39:07] declined neither have I gone back from
[39:10] the Commandment of his lips I have
[39:12] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[39:16] than my necessary
[39:19] food I want to just pull from even that
[39:22] on verse 12 remember God had wrote the
[39:25] first Bible was in the heavens job job
[39:29] knew it you'll hear job recite this even
[39:31] as we come to further chapters job will
[39:33] recite certain constellations and things
[39:35] that's there and their
[39:37] meaning but job knows him by vision and
[39:40] so what job is saying is I'm just not
[39:43] content with what has been written there
[39:46] but I am waiting because man shall not
[39:49] live by bread alone but by every word
[39:52] that proceeds out of the mouth of God so
[39:55] job says I'm struck striving to live by
[39:58] every word that proceeds out of his
[40:00] mouth amen may God bless you and bless
[40:03] the reading of the word this
[40:05] evening I want to just draw continue on
[40:08] that thought of in his
[40:11] hands and um I really want to take the
[40:14] word just to allow a word for a subtitle
[40:17] or thought in our hearts is that of
[40:20] assurance I think there's no greater
[40:22] thing than Assurance when a person has
[40:25] assurance
[40:27] it's a confidence that's not a it's not
[40:30] an arrogance it's a confidence that
[40:32] brings a peace it brings a settledness
[40:34] it brings a rest now these scriptures we
[40:38] read here in verse 10 11 and
[40:41] 12 they are wonderful statements and I
[40:45] don't want to just say it statements
[40:47] just to be as those statements but
[40:49] they're wonderful thoughts that have
[40:50] been expressed but for you and I
[40:53] standing on this side of calvary
[40:56] and having the understanding where we've
[40:58] been admonished through the scriptures
[41:00] as even Jesus himself when he came he
[41:03] let the disciples know that be of good
[41:06] cheer for I have overcome the world in
[41:08] the world you'll have much tribulation
[41:12] so he's letting them know there's going
[41:13] to be much tribulation that even though
[41:15] you're receiving the promise of what God
[41:18] has given but yet there's going to be
[41:20] much tribulation Paul even spoke of this
[41:23] witnessing it not only the Believers
[41:24] could witness it in Paul's life but Paul
[41:27] would talk about the admonishment and
[41:28] strength that he and other believers had
[41:31] received from the Saints in thessalonica
[41:34] Saints and other places and just
[41:36] watching their steadfastness under the
[41:38] midst of trial because you recognize
[41:40] there's something greater than just the
[41:43] DNA of a person I think that there's one
[41:45] thing about it between us as Believers
[41:47] if there's something that we look at
[41:49] within one another we don't want to
[41:52] emulate one another or take one
[41:53] another's Spirit we want to be able to
[41:55] recognize it's Christ and my brother
[41:58] it's Christ and my sister and that's
[42:00] what it is that challenges or provokes
[42:02] our life unto good works because we
[42:05] recognize in our flesh every one of us
[42:07] in our flesh uh our flesh is no good but
[42:10] it's Christ on the inside that's what's
[42:12] good it's Christ and that so when we see
[42:15] this in verse 10 11 and 12 remember job
[42:18] doesn't know what's taking place he's
[42:20] looking at it in a manner when we read
[42:22] these scriptures job's looking at it in
[42:24] a manner as though remember I don't
[42:27] understand what's going on he's longing
[42:28] to hear from God he's looking at it
[42:31] within this part that everything that
[42:33] God has asked and required of me I have
[42:36] done it and I've not done it in a manner
[42:38] of fear I've done it because what he's
[42:40] revealed to me so job is is looking at
[42:43] it in in in a way when he doesn't
[42:46] understand what's taking place but I
[42:48] want to bring it to us as Believers that
[42:51] as Believers sure when things come our
[42:53] way we come to that place sometime times
[42:56] and it seems odd when things take place
[42:58] we're trying to kind of gather ourselves
[43:00] and maybe make sense of it and and
[43:03] there's an evaluation that comes upon
[43:05] our heart of is everything right with
[43:07] God and that should be a reflection in
[43:09] our life I I think that ought to be that
[43:12] ought to be something that's very
[43:13] apparent about our lives is is
[43:15] everything right with God because you
[43:18] know knowing that there are times that
[43:20] God will allow afflictions and allow
[43:22] things to come our way that's actually
[43:25] God trying to get our attention and
[43:27] bring correction to our lives and then
[43:29] there's other times where the tests and
[43:31] trials it's actually molding it is not
[43:33] anything that's wrong it's just God
[43:35] bringing more of himself out of our
[43:37] lives and so we want to be very clear
[43:40] and I think we've said that here over
[43:42] the time is that we just don't want to
[43:44] you know uh make an assumption and say
[43:46] that everything coming my way well it's
[43:48] just a trial but we want to be able to
[43:50] understand is it indeed a trial or is it
[43:54] correction is that right because God has
[43:57] promised he won't lose
[43:59] one are you hearing me and as a Believer
[44:03] there's things that we want to look we
[44:04] want the word to examine our lives and I
[44:08] believe the Holy Spirit it will bring us
[44:10] God listen God knows how to work with
[44:12] every one of our Lives we could say to
[44:14] one another examine Our Lives examine
[44:16] Our Lives examine our lives but you know
[44:18] God I've watched things just over the
[44:20] years I've been serving the lord God
[44:22] knows how to bring things to a place to
[44:24] where a life will really come to a place
[44:26] of examining if there's become a veil
[44:28] around that life and there's things that
[44:30] they themselves cannot see yet in the
[44:32] mind think everything's all right God
[44:34] knows how to break that
[44:36] Veil he knows how to break that and he
[44:39] he doesn't need me or you to break that
[44:40] Veil God knows how to break that Veil
[44:43] because remember you're his children we
[44:46] belong to him he's our heavenly father
[44:49] and so with that in mind I I look at
[44:52] these scriptures here that there is a a
[44:55] a a bless blessedness of an assurance
[44:58] that we uh are to have as a Believer and
[45:01] brother brandham you know in this
[45:03] message I've heard but now I see it I I
[45:05] just continued over months just
[45:07] continued to going through this message
[45:10] and brother Bram says it like this in
[45:12] that message he said job knew that he
[45:14] was
[45:15] right I think that's a powerful
[45:18] statement brother BR said in another
[45:20] place job had a noo Fellowship he knew
[45:23] where he was standing and I tell you in
[45:25] this we're living in it's important you
[45:28] know where you're
[45:30] standing Faith and Hope listen they work
[45:34] together but if if there's no faith and
[45:37] it's just hope hope can be the biggest
[45:39] enemy of
[45:40] Faith because what faith does faith is
[45:44] the revelation of the will of God and
[45:47] Faith deposited in the heart brings a
[45:50] hope which is an expectation for what's
[45:54] been revealed hallah and then that's
[45:57] that's then that in itself it's where
[45:59] there's a love of God operate in our
[46:01] life so job knew that he was right even
[46:04] when all the accusations we've looked at
[46:07] when friends wanted to come when uh you
[46:10] know church members and on and on as
[46:12] brother BR put that there and everything
[46:14] was coming around to him to accuse him
[46:16] and you realize God has permitted
[46:20] this God could have stopped every bit of
[46:23] it but God has permitted every one of
[46:26] these things to come from that of his
[46:29] his children being taken for all those
[46:32] things but God didn't do it he permitted
[46:34] it and God didn't permit it because job
[46:37] was out of the will of God job didn't
[46:40] God did not permit it because he was
[46:42] going to correct job remember as we
[46:44] looked at a couple weeks ago he was
[46:46] purging
[46:48] job and purging is where where there's
[46:51] growth and then we trim off certain
[46:53] things that come out of that growth
[46:55] we're in interested in more
[46:58] growth not just a bunch of lifeless
[47:01] shoots is that right we want everything
[47:04] channeled in our life there's a channel
[47:07] that God operates by so when we think of
[47:10] it of how that God will test his people
[47:13] at times and in this case brother Bram
[47:15] picks it up in this same quote in this
[47:18] case it was God testing job look at this
[47:21] statement the best man there was on
[47:23] Earth at the time that's a a powerful
[47:27] statement how could he been the best man
[47:29] on Earth at the time is because he was
[47:33] under the
[47:34] blood he was in fellowship with God he
[47:39] valued God's word more than he valued
[47:42] his own
[47:44] lifeall he steamed the word brother Rams
[47:48] picks the scripture up and then in the
[47:50] church age he says that the elect of God
[47:53] will esteem the word of God above
[47:55] everything else above every idea above
[47:59] every opinion they will esteem it more
[48:02] than their necessary
[48:04] food and he says they'll yearn to live
[48:07] by it I don't want to just know the
[48:10] word the word was meant to be
[48:14] lived are you with me the rain falls
[48:17] soaks me but the rain did not fall to
[48:19] what my clothes the rain came because
[48:21] there is seeds in the
[48:24] ground and this word come that it might
[48:27] fall in the very midst of our life and
[48:30] bring
[48:31] forth what are you saying brother Samuel
[48:33] I don't want just a good service I want
[48:35] to see God in my
[48:38] life I don't want just a feeling I want
[48:40] to see God in my
[48:45] life the best man there was on Earth at
[48:48] the time now watch this now he was
[48:50] holding him then who was holding job God
[48:54] was holding him
[48:57] the Revelation makes a man
[49:00] upright not just good in his living but
[49:03] it makes him upright from one who is
[49:05] cast down to one who is upright in the
[49:07] presence of
[49:08] God because that he knew Job was a
[49:11] prophet that had a vision from God he
[49:14] had exactly done what God told him to do
[49:17] and God was Duty bound to keep his
[49:19] promise to
[49:21] him if if you've not been through this
[49:24] message in a while it'd be good to go
[49:25] through this message I've heard but now
[49:27] I see I can't even tell you how many
[49:28] times I've just continued to come
[49:30] through it actually since last November
[49:32] but in this message brother Brandon is
[49:34] laying it very clear we want God to do
[49:37] things for us then make sure
[49:39] everything's lined
[49:41] up hello make sure everything's lined up
[49:45] in order for the fire to fall on Mount
[49:47] Carmel remember Elijah had to come bring
[49:51] the altar in order had to put the wood
[49:53] in order and the sacrifice had to be in
[49:55] order then the fire would fall that was
[49:57] according to the
[49:59] word so it's to place ourself into that
[50:02] place and say well God how can I come
[50:04] into that rightful place be obedient to
[50:06] the word whatever the word says do do it
[50:10] and don't wait for well I don't feel
[50:11] anything I don't feel anything special
[50:13] we're operating by the word making ready
[50:16] for the fire to
[50:17] fall sometimes we get so prone to we
[50:21] have to have a feeling for this well I
[50:22] have to have a feeling for this I have
[50:24] to listen the word is the word and the
[50:26] word's been sent before us is that right
[50:29] the Bible said even Paul said there are
[50:31] things that don't even have to be
[50:33] revealed to you it's recorded in God's
[50:35] word let every man know how to possess
[50:38] his San his vessel in sanctification and
[50:41] honor is that right the prophet said you
[50:44] really don't even need a revelation of
[50:46] order be baptized in the name of Jesus
[50:48] Christ it's written right in the
[50:51] word but you see what's happened is you
[50:53] you we can look at that and say Well
[50:55] it's got to be revealed it's got to be
[50:57] revealed that the word of God is a truth
[51:00] not man's ideas about the word of
[51:03] God that's what we've been called out of
[51:06] ideas of man opinions of man we've been
[51:10] assembled to the person of Truth
[51:15] himself
[51:17] Hall and all Christians now watch this
[51:20] all Christians has got to be that when
[51:23] the last struggle of our life comes com
[51:26] and death rattles are in our throat we
[51:28] must still hold steady and remember that
[51:31] God said I'll raise you up again at the
[51:33] last
[51:34] day see that's
[51:37] personal it's got to got to hold that
[51:40] our testimony our place in Christ we've
[51:43] got a hold to that excuse me our
[51:45] testimony our place in Christ our
[51:48] position what we are knowing that we
[51:50] have kept every word of his commandment
[51:53] blessed are they that do his his
[51:55] Commandments that they might have a
[51:57] right to enter in and when we know that
[51:59] no matter what anyone else has said this
[52:01] is what's powerful we've kept every
[52:04] Commandment that we see in the Bible
[52:06] that God has done told us to do with
[52:09] reverence and love and respect to the
[52:11] Creator who wrote the Bible there's a
[52:14] lot that could be said and preached
[52:15] within that is to do everything with
[52:18] love with respect with with that of who
[52:21] of of the great creator of what he has
[52:23] wrote within his word then we can stand
[52:26] there no matter what accusation comes
[52:29] you have an
[52:30] assurance of where you're standing with
[52:33] God this is the hour of great Assurance
[52:37] let me tell you something I have watched
[52:38] countless videos of this of Israel of
[52:41] the Israeli troops of the different
[52:43] things that they have said and even
[52:45] seeing them preparing to go into war let
[52:48] me tell you something even the reporting
[52:49] I've watched one gentleman that's been
[52:51] right there with the military going
[52:53] right into Gaza and everything say over
[52:55] and over is God is with
[52:58] Israel let me tell you something I say
[53:00] Amen to that it's true they got to be
[53:02] called to repentance but God is with
[53:07] them they picked on the wrong
[53:10] people you cannot defeat the promise of
[53:14] God you can't defeat
[53:19] it pardon me for saying it but it shows
[53:21] the insanity we've seen in our nation
[53:23] for years now and all around of
[53:26] individuals Marching for
[53:28] things it's
[53:32] Insanity are you hearing me I'm not
[53:34] making a political statement I'm just
[53:36] pointing out the condition of people
[53:38] it's
[53:41] insanity but God said he would preserve
[53:45] Israel pray for the Peace of
[53:48] Jerusalem and I say it in this in this
[53:51] manner right here that Israel when them
[53:53] soldiers going into battle and watching
[53:55] and just listening and taking that in
[53:58] they're not going in there with just
[54:00] some haphazard thought you realize
[54:02] there's one individual I saw 95 years
[54:05] old
[54:07] reenlisted I said oh God let that kind
[54:10] of zeal fall among the people of
[54:13] God come on church let that kind of
[54:17] Burden fall on lives just say hey wait a
[54:20] minute I need to be in the house of God
[54:22] hey it's important for me to pick up and
[54:24] get with it hey it's important for me to
[54:27] be active in the duty of Our
[54:31] Lord if they can get that excited and
[54:34] listen that's not a workup these are
[54:36] people that are committed
[54:39] right let me tell you that's what the
[54:41] Rapture is going to be about people that
[54:44] are committed to the vision of the Lord
[54:46] let me just say this not to put a damper
[54:48] on anything but if you're halfhazard
[54:50] halfway in halfway out up and down and
[54:53] in and out and you know really ser
[54:55] serving God doesn't matter you're not
[54:56] that diligent about it you're making
[54:58] preparations to be left
[55:02] behind but the same you're trying to
[55:04] bring fear upon no I'm not I'm trying to
[55:06] tell you the truth because that kind of
[55:09] an attitude is not a Rapture
[55:11] attitude is to alert and be awaken awake
[55:15] thou that
[55:16] sleepest now how did we get
[55:19] here but we're talking about
[55:22] Assurance assurance
[55:27] so the resulting I I want to just look
[55:29] at this from
[55:31] Assurance you
[55:32] know how many knows that in a trial
[55:36] that's a time to
[55:38] yield how many knows
[55:41] that it's a time to
[55:44] yield
[55:47] now when we're
[55:49] complaining we're not
[55:51] yielding and listen let's just be honest
[55:54] sometimes in our flesh we go through
[55:55] that and we have to come back and say
[55:57] Lord forgive
[55:59] me let's just be honest we're not
[56:01] talking I'm not talking to Sons and
[56:02] Daughters of God and I recognize we have
[56:04] to come back to that sometimes we have
[56:06] questions of why sometimes the grumbling
[56:08] that comes but here's what's important
[56:10] is you've got an assurance on the inside
[56:12] that brings you right back to where you
[56:14] need to
[56:15] be because the trial itself it's a
[56:18] moment to be yielded in the hands of
[56:23] God
[56:26] let me look let me look here in the
[56:27] scripture for 2 Corinthians chapter 4
[56:30] verse
[56:32] 17 for our light Affliction I wonder how
[56:35] many eyes Paul got when he wrote this
[56:38] light
[56:41] Affliction it should be heavy heavy
[56:44] duty for our light now watch this he is
[56:47] he is writing this under inspiration of
[56:51] us to consider that the Affliction that
[56:54] the test that the trial do not make more
[56:58] out of it than what it actually
[57:01] is for our light Affliction which is but
[57:06] for a
[57:09] moment do you realize how many
[57:12] came when the Bible said be faithful
[57:14] unto death there in that saman age and
[57:18] they came up to a place and there were
[57:21] those who were taken captive had the
[57:24] identity as a Christian but when they
[57:27] came there before the soldiers whether
[57:30] it's the arena or the state there were
[57:34] numbers of people that
[57:37] recanted how could they have recanted
[57:40] because they didn't have
[57:41] Assurance Assurance will affect your
[57:48] conduct but then you have others like
[57:51] polycarp that's walking and he hears a
[57:54] voice voice of the Angel say Play The
[57:57] Man Play The Man In other words stand
[58:00] like a man stand like a soldier of God
[58:03] stand
[58:06] steadfast polycarp could hear the angel
[58:08] just for a moment for those who recanted
[58:11] for just a moment of relief where are
[58:14] they that's right but for those who
[58:17] stood just under a moment what it seemed
[58:20] like it might have been hours it might
[58:22] have been days come on the Bible said
[58:24] there were those in Hebrews 11 that
[58:26] suffer C cural tortures but in all
[58:29] Essence it's a moment I don't care if
[58:31] it's days hours months it's a moment
[58:34] compared to
[58:36] Eternity it's to evaluate these things
[58:39] on that kind of a
[58:42] scale for our light Affliction which is
[58:45] but for a moment oh I love this worketh
[58:48] for us a far more exceeding and eternal
[58:53] weight of of
[58:55] Glory so what's working for us is to
[58:59] perform to accomplish to achieve what is
[59:01] it is that light
[59:04] Affliction that trial that test working
[59:07] out in our life see job didn't have the
[59:10] understanding of what was taking place
[59:12] in his life and that's why Satan was
[59:14] whipping him couldn't move him off the
[59:18] sacrifice but he was whipping come on
[59:20] three kinds of Believers as long as
[59:22] Satan could make job think it was his
[59:25] God that was doing it he had job
[59:28] whipped yet you couldn't move him off
[59:30] the sacrifice right but yet within it to
[59:35] understand that it was working that
[59:37] things that were taking place what job
[59:39] didn't know God was making something out
[59:42] of
[59:43] him God was working in his
[59:47] life J knew God's working but I don't
[59:50] know what's going on but here's what's
[59:53] important
[59:55] you and I cannot we cannot Escape we'd
[59:58] like to find exit signs like that in a
[1:00:00] test or a
[1:00:02] trial but Samuel why are you preaching
[1:00:04] on tests and trials cuz the majority of
[1:00:06] your Christian walk is tests and
[1:00:10] trials are you hearing me well I don't
[1:00:13] have test and trials then you might want
[1:00:14] to check your experience you might want
[1:00:17] to check where you're at with God I
[1:00:19] don't go out looking for tests and
[1:00:20] trials neither did job but remember
[1:00:23] brother BR said persec utions are a
[1:00:25] normal part of the Christian
[1:00:29] Life is that right and he said every
[1:00:32] church has them he said the church that
[1:00:34] doesn't is not
[1:00:38] God's but this is what's important is
[1:00:42] I'm we're not looking for my flesh looks
[1:00:44] for an exit sign let's just put it that
[1:00:46] way my flesh looks for an exit sign even
[1:00:49] my spirit would look for an exit sign my
[1:00:52] flesh my spirit wants to see an end to
[1:00:55] it right but yet the Soul on the inside
[1:00:59] that's the control tower that's what's
[1:01:02] important to bring everything else in
[1:01:04] line in the midst of that time and yield
[1:01:07] to the
[1:01:10] Lord in other words when Paul said I
[1:01:12] will glory in my infirmities Paul said I
[1:01:15] am a worshipper whether I'm up or
[1:01:18] whether I'm down whether I'm going on
[1:01:20] the mountain or I'm in the Valley I'm a
[1:01:23] worshipper now sometimes you notice
[1:01:25] people's worship and their worship will
[1:01:28] let you know where they're at now I'm
[1:01:29] not saying that we don't get down
[1:01:30] friends but what I'm trying to say is is
[1:01:33] that within it is don't let
[1:01:35] circumstances determine your worship
[1:01:39] because your worship is not about you
[1:01:41] your worship is about him who is the
[1:01:44] worthy
[1:01:45] one so whether I feel like it as far as
[1:01:48] I feel maybe chills or that that had
[1:01:50] nothing to do with it it has everything
[1:01:52] to do with he is worth
[1:01:55] Worthy is that right now notice this is
[1:01:58] what's important in verse 18 while we
[1:02:01] look not at the things which are seen
[1:02:04] that's what can get us in trouble is
[1:02:05] when we look at just what we see right
[1:02:09] that's where fear can come in that's
[1:02:11] where depression can come in so there's
[1:02:14] a place that you and I can look to
[1:02:17] friends what a what a privilege you have
[1:02:19] as a Believer a place and access to be
[1:02:22] able to look at things which are not
[1:02:24] seen But at the things which are not
[1:02:27] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:02:30] temporal but the things which are not
[1:02:33] seen are
[1:02:34] Eternal let's just bring this down right
[1:02:37] into shoe leather it's just like if you
[1:02:39] would get a report about your job oh
[1:02:41] they're going to do this X Y and Z well
[1:02:44] sure those things can it can Fear Can
[1:02:46] want to come in but if there is that
[1:02:48] hold on the inside that says wait a
[1:02:50] minute in the word he says I've never
[1:02:53] seen the righteous is forsaken pause I
[1:02:56] am one of the righteous ones by his
[1:03:00] grace not by my own doing now let's
[1:03:04] continue I've never seen one of his
[1:03:07] children begging for
[1:03:11] bread and I have the confidence that
[1:03:14] whatever door that God has opened that
[1:03:16] God will keep open as long as it's his
[1:03:19] will whenever God sees to fit to close
[1:03:22] it then he's got something better for me
[1:03:25] in
[1:03:26] mind that's able to look beyond the
[1:03:30] things that we
[1:03:32] see
[1:03:34] Hello sometimes the initial news can
[1:03:37] take the maybe take the breath out of us
[1:03:39] take the air out of us so let's not
[1:03:41] dehumanize and move us away from the
[1:03:44] humanity that we're surrounded in but
[1:03:46] let us remember that there is a place
[1:03:48] within us that is so much deeper and so
[1:03:51] much greater and a place that we're to
[1:03:53] draw from to affect us and move in this
[1:03:57] realm you see this this worketh for us
[1:04:01] is a far more an exceeding Eternal
[1:04:04] weight of Glory you know the whole thing
[1:04:07] that really when it comes down to it
[1:04:09] about us the thing that we take care of
[1:04:11] so much and we have to clothe it wash
[1:04:14] its hair and buy comfortable mattresses
[1:04:16] for it man comfortable chairs and you
[1:04:19] know have maybe have the heated seats in
[1:04:20] the car we baby it it's the thing that
[1:04:23] is worth the least
[1:04:26] amount 150 lb is 84
[1:04:31] so I mean you can figure well wherever
[1:04:33] you want to figure you are you might be
[1:04:35] over a dollar but
[1:04:37] still compared to the
[1:04:40] soul the soul is worth more than 10,000
[1:04:47] worlds that's the whole purpose of
[1:04:50] Calvary sure he took stripes for the
[1:04:53] healing of our body because he knew
[1:04:55] while we would be here in this life we
[1:04:58] would need Divine assistance there would
[1:05:01] need to be healing while we are here and
[1:05:04] our character is being molded and we're
[1:05:07] serving the purpose of
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:11] God but that's the real value is to have
[1:05:14] Christ's character inside of us molding
[1:05:17] our own life making us you know when you
[1:05:20] look at that of gold and probably
[1:05:22] there's others here that's maybe more
[1:05:24] astute and on this than what I would
[1:05:26] have ever been with gold but you
[1:05:27] recognize that gold itself to be the
[1:05:29] purest it would be 24 carats many times
[1:05:33] within jewelry and things like that
[1:05:35] they'll have a certain carrot percentage
[1:05:37] within it it might say 18 carrots but it
[1:05:40] all has to equal out to 24 so that would
[1:05:43] mean if there are if it's 18 carrots
[1:05:45] there are six other alloy materials that
[1:05:49] make up that piece of jewelry or
[1:05:51] whatever it
[1:05:53] is but then in order to get that gold
[1:05:56] out of it or for a pond broker to test
[1:05:58] it to see cuz you can take a piece of
[1:06:01] gold to him they don't know that that
[1:06:03] gold itself that it's gold through and
[1:06:05] through they don't even know how much to
[1:06:07] even give you because it might be that
[1:06:09] it's a piece of an article that's simply
[1:06:12] coated in gold and it's not very many
[1:06:16] carrots whatsoever but then again it
[1:06:18] might have that piece cuz most every
[1:06:20] jewelry jewelry is not you will not find
[1:06:22] a piece of jewelry that's 24 Karat
[1:06:24] because gold is too soft it has to has a
[1:06:27] part within it of other mixtures of
[1:06:29] alloy silver lead and so forth that are
[1:06:31] all part of that compound to actually
[1:06:33] make it strong whether it's necklace
[1:06:35] ring and and whatsoever more but in
[1:06:37] order to make it to take that let's say
[1:06:39] they were to gather up a lot of gold it
[1:06:42] maybe chain and everything else think
[1:06:44] about it when they would make even that
[1:06:46] in the uh in the Ark of the Covenant and
[1:06:48] all of those arrangements in the
[1:06:50] Tabernacle God remember what God said it
[1:06:52] shall be overlay played with pure gold
[1:06:56] now they brought that stuff out of Egypt
[1:06:59] but that stuff they brought out that
[1:07:01] jewelry was not pure gold but it had to
[1:07:03] go through a process it would be like
[1:07:06] them wanting to get make gold bullion or
[1:07:08] gold blocks out of something they would
[1:07:11] actually have to take that gold whether
[1:07:13] it's in the jewelry the ring or whatever
[1:07:15] more and they would have to so put it
[1:07:17] together with uh with another
[1:07:19] combination sometimes borax and things
[1:07:21] like that and they would bring it
[1:07:23] together and when they would also put
[1:07:25] lead within it the the gold itself will
[1:07:28] sink down and Unite with the lead and
[1:07:30] the rest of the materials float free
[1:07:32] then they'll take the gold and the lead
[1:07:34] and they'll take that and in order to
[1:07:36] separate the lead out of it they'll take
[1:07:38] another process and separate the gold
[1:07:40] and Lead then it goes down you got to
[1:07:43] get the silver out of the gold they'll
[1:07:44] take you through another process
[1:07:46] sometimes the nitric oxide and things
[1:07:48] like that and break it down to where all
[1:07:50] you're left with is pure gold brother
[1:07:52] Samuel what are you say that it's a
[1:07:54] process because the character in our
[1:07:57] life it must be a gold likee character
[1:08:01] he said at the Book of Revelation in the
[1:08:04] lady of see and age buy of me gold
[1:08:07] that's been tried in the fire a pure
[1:08:09] gold that's why the coming of the Holy
[1:08:12] Ghost in This Hour is not a mixture of
[1:08:15] man's ideas they had mixture down
[1:08:18] through even in ausa Pentecost there was
[1:08:21] a mixture within it but God in this last
[1:08:24] days was not just going to release a
[1:08:26] portion but it would be the fullness of
[1:08:29] Christ himself coming free from any
[1:08:33] mixture that's why the bride in this
[1:08:35] hour the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:08:39] because not only is the Lamb here but
[1:08:41] there's a bride on the scene that can
[1:08:44] receive the material the true gold of
[1:08:47] God and be brought forth and presented
[1:08:50] to
[1:08:51] him this is all God's work
[1:08:54] so the same part working in our life
[1:08:58] it's called working in our life God will
[1:08:59] take a hold of a life he's working out
[1:09:02] you know all the different things like
[1:09:03] brother Bram let me just read this quote
[1:09:05] out of time test Memorial memorials he
[1:09:07] said long years ago before they had the
[1:09:09] smelters they used to take the gold how
[1:09:12] they would know how that it was right or
[1:09:14] not with all the sludge was out of it
[1:09:17] all the iron pyite the Fool's Gold how
[1:09:20] many glad he takes the fool's gold out
[1:09:21] of you and
[1:09:22] I glad he takes that or say now I didn't
[1:09:25] have no fool's gold in me now you're
[1:09:27] foolish to think that you did we had
[1:09:29] fool's gold in us but see what the
[1:09:31] presence of God did was to separate us
[1:09:35] from everything that is not or will not
[1:09:38] bleed to Divine
[1:09:40] Assurance all the fools out of it
[1:09:42] beaters beat it beat it turned it beat
[1:09:44] it turned it until the beater sees his
[1:09:46] reflection in the gold that's the way
[1:09:48] God does his church he gives you trial
[1:09:52] after trial tell test after test trial
[1:09:56] after trial boy this sounds right don't
[1:09:58] it test after test until the Life of
[1:10:02] Christ is reflected in your life until
[1:10:07] you become peaceful sober Meek gentle
[1:10:12] humble ready submissive willing anybody
[1:10:15] else can say help me
[1:10:18] Lord Oh Brother Sam I've already arrived
[1:10:21] there yet really why are you still here
[1:10:25] why are you still here well I'm just in
[1:10:27] a holding pattern just to show everybody
[1:10:29] else what an example looks like oh
[1:10:32] really really I thought he's the
[1:10:35] Prototype I thought he's the example
[1:10:37] that every son and daughter of God is to
[1:10:39] be
[1:10:41] like in that case if God wanted to bring
[1:10:43] another example he would have left the
[1:10:45] prophet here because in our generation
[1:10:47] that was the closest that would have
[1:10:50] been upon Earth to that of the life of
[1:10:52] the Lord Jesus
[1:10:54] is that right a son of man revealing the
[1:10:56] son of man now here it is in Bride
[1:10:59] form is that right but notice God
[1:11:02] working individually you know many of
[1:11:04] these parts and things in our life that
[1:11:06] it would be things that nobody else
[1:11:08] would know about us sometimes these are
[1:11:11] things that we don't even know are
[1:11:12] lacking or that we should be we think
[1:11:15] we're in certain places in our life and
[1:11:17] God brings us through certain things to
[1:11:20] bring us to a place of recognition do
[1:11:22] you realize that even in the test or
[1:11:25] trial you or I do not recognize oh I
[1:11:27] know what God's doing he's trying to
[1:11:29] make me more Meek oh I realiz no that's
[1:11:31] a no it all God is not doing it that way
[1:11:34] but God brings us to a place of
[1:11:38] submission how can the how can the clay
[1:11:41] tell the Potter I know what you're doing
[1:11:44] right yep you're working Pride out of my
[1:11:46] life yep I know it it's divinely
[1:11:48] revealed to
[1:11:52] me
[1:11:55] we don't know it I said we don't know it
[1:12:00] you see that's all part of
[1:12:01] submission is we submit like job listen
[1:12:05] job didn't know what was taking place
[1:12:07] you or I know when a test or trial comes
[1:12:10] we've examined our hearts and examined
[1:12:12] Our Lives then we can stand there with
[1:12:13] an assurance that I know there's nothing
[1:12:16] between God and I and if he wants me to
[1:12:18] know anything he'll let me know it but
[1:12:21] in the meantime I'm going to keep on
[1:12:23] keeping
[1:12:25] on is that right that's not going to be
[1:12:28] a time that I pull away and pout on God
[1:12:30] get CAU on God well I'm not praying as
[1:12:32] much I'm not being that diligent within
[1:12:34] the word I'm just kind of down and and
[1:12:37] I'm just a little bit sad no that's a
[1:12:39] time to keep standing there what a joy
[1:12:41] that is to a real believer when you know
[1:12:44] that there's nothing in your life
[1:12:46] between you and God and if there is
[1:12:48] something when you repent of it and you
[1:12:51] make it right what a joy it is that you
[1:12:53] can stand in the presence of God while
[1:12:56] you are waiting for inspiration to
[1:13:03] drop I know it's been said a whole lot
[1:13:06] you know but it's true it takes a whole
[1:13:09] lot more muscles to
[1:13:13] frown the Bible said happy is the people
[1:13:17] whose God is the Lord is he your lord
[1:13:20] well then you ought to be happy that
[1:13:22] doesn't mean that you're a bubble
[1:13:23] dancing and running but it means there
[1:13:25] ought to be a happiness about your life
[1:13:27] there ought to be a joy no you don't
[1:13:29] understand this situation it didn't say
[1:13:31] happy is the people whose life is
[1:13:34] perfect who everything is smooth it said
[1:13:37] happy is the people whose God is the
[1:13:40] Lord not happy because everything is
[1:13:43] going my way or let's bring it up to
[1:13:45] this present day happy is everything
[1:13:48] when I've got Good
[1:13:50] Vibes like a young man I was sitting
[1:13:53] beside coming back from Australia he
[1:13:54] said yeah he said you know everybody was
[1:13:56] really friendly over there and and
[1:13:58] everybody said I just got Good Vibes
[1:14:00] when I went in the restaurant what in
[1:14:02] the world I mean some of this is just
[1:14:04] like I look at and think everything that
[1:14:06] we live around is based on Vibes and
[1:14:09] feelings when I went around so and so I
[1:14:12] didn't get Good Vibes I went
[1:14:14] around Lord have mercy we are people
[1:14:17] living off of
[1:14:20] feelings I pray to God that for the the
[1:14:23] Bride of Jesus Christ for us as children
[1:14:25] of God then we're not living by our
[1:14:27] feelings because by our feelings the
[1:14:30] devil will whip us every
[1:14:32] time is that right but he cannot set his
[1:14:35] feet on the Blessed ground of assurance
[1:14:38] that's down in the
[1:14:40] soul brother Bram said many times look
[1:14:43] at this turn your head from the things
[1:14:44] he's he's doing this so that we'll turn
[1:14:46] our head from the things of the world
[1:14:48] and look straight to Calvary to the one
[1:14:50] who's doing the beating many times you
[1:14:53] think it's strange because fiery trials
[1:14:57] and sickness and
[1:14:59] persecution no is it incredible because
[1:15:01] not all of us have the same trials and
[1:15:05] tests no we don't they're all remember
[1:15:08] brother Ram puts it in the church AG
[1:15:09] book personal Temptations seasons of
[1:15:14] Temptations so it's things that's so
[1:15:16] fitted maybe if God took your test or
[1:15:19] trials what brings test and trial what
[1:15:21] is test and trials it's breaking us down
[1:15:23] so more of Christ can come up maybe
[1:15:25] putting that that upon somebody else
[1:15:27] somebody else think you know there ain't
[1:15:29] nothing to this right here but God knows
[1:15:31] for each of us what's
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:40] needed I want you to watch this
[1:15:42] statement I'm about to read you can
[1:15:43] probably read it up there ahead of me
[1:15:46] but there are times we need listen
[1:15:48] friends we need the right hand I'll
[1:15:49] probably not be able to get to it
[1:15:51] tonight we need the right hand as a
[1:15:52] matter of fact that's what holds you and
[1:15:54] I up that's what gives us strength
[1:15:56] that's the that's what brings the
[1:15:58] Assurance in our
[1:16:00] life but in our life when the molding
[1:16:03] and the shaping and the working is going
[1:16:05] on it's not red sea parting Jordan
[1:16:09] parting it's us yielding and God working
[1:16:13] because remember when he was led as a
[1:16:16] lamb to the slaughter dumb before her
[1:16:22] shear
[1:16:24] our identity was in there to be shaved
[1:16:28] off for wool to be cut
[1:16:32] off many times he says you think it's
[1:16:34] strange because fiery trials and
[1:16:36] sickness and persecutions it's only done
[1:16:38] to test you to get the dirt out of you
[1:16:41] to get the sludge out of you to get the
[1:16:43] slowness out of you to wake you up to
[1:16:46] the place where you can look and see the
[1:16:48] reflection or men can see the reflection
[1:16:51] of Christ in you Christ in you the hope
[1:16:53] of glory now I'm sure probably what I'm
[1:16:55] getting ready to say nobody else has
[1:16:56] ever felt this way so you know you just
[1:16:59] say oh man brother Samuel's so carnal
[1:17:02] but there's things that I God has
[1:17:04] brought out and I have seen in my life
[1:17:06] and I thought man oh man years ago I
[1:17:09] thought I was hitting high on the
[1:17:12] hog I mean I felt like man I had a hold
[1:17:15] on certain things but you know what God
[1:17:18] permits those
[1:17:19] things I think I probably am the only
[1:17:21] one feeling that way
[1:17:23] but there's certain things you begin to
[1:17:25] realize you see what I'm trying to say
[1:17:26] is there's certain things I could not
[1:17:28] see and God didn't ask you he doesn't
[1:17:31] ask me to come to a to your life and say
[1:17:34] hey here's a clipboard here I think I
[1:17:35] think you need to work on this in your
[1:17:36] life you're a character what good would
[1:17:39] that
[1:17:40] do you understand because just telling
[1:17:42] somebody does not mold
[1:17:44] character the preaching of the word
[1:17:46] right here does not mold
[1:17:49] character that only comes by test and
[1:17:52] trials
[1:17:54] the preaching of the word is to let you
[1:17:56] know who you are to encourage you to
[1:17:59] inspire you God will impart strength to
[1:18:01] your life to keep pressing in what he's
[1:18:05] called you
[1:18:06] to that's why it's important for the
[1:18:08] ministering of the word cuz if we're not
[1:18:11] receiving the ministry of the word then
[1:18:13] we find ourselves not progressing and
[1:18:15] not living up to the purpose and calling
[1:18:17] of God like we need to be is that right
[1:18:21] so things that God will work in our life
[1:18:23] and bring out God wants to bring the
[1:18:25] dirt out of us God wanted to bring dirt
[1:18:27] out of Samuel brownie he wanted to bring
[1:18:29] sludge out of Samuel Browning oh brother
[1:18:32] Samuel you mean for yeah for years God
[1:18:34] works and he works and he works and the
[1:18:37] thing that I can look back down through
[1:18:39] time not just years and years ago but I
[1:18:42] can look back down through there and say
[1:18:43] God thank you for your mercy when I
[1:18:46] wasn't even aware of it but there are
[1:18:49] things that in your own time and in your
[1:18:52] own season you see fit to work out at
[1:18:55] that
[1:18:56] time think of it how would it be if you
[1:19:00] went into a class let's say you signed
[1:19:02] up for art let's just pretend you
[1:19:03] weren't good in art you were like me
[1:19:05] that couldn't even draw a stick person
[1:19:06] and you went in there to sit down what
[1:19:08] if somebody overwhelmed you and started
[1:19:11] critiquing every little thing that you
[1:19:13] did and every little part you ought to
[1:19:16] sat like this you ought to be doing this
[1:19:18] you ought to be doing that you would be
[1:19:20] so overwhelmed you'd say what's the use
[1:19:21] of trying right see God doesn't do
[1:19:25] that God does not overwhelm us at the
[1:19:28] beginning he doesn't overwhelm us God
[1:19:31] knows what we're able to handle he knows
[1:19:34] the tests and trials and what we have
[1:19:36] need of to be molded out in our lives at
[1:19:39] that time he knows the strength that we
[1:19:42] need he knows the encouragement God
[1:19:43] knows the encouragement that you need in
[1:19:45] every service and he'll move a little
[1:19:47] bit of that of the right hand and give
[1:19:48] you encouragement just to let you know
[1:19:50] and remind you I'm right here that's
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:55] right but it stabilizes
[1:19:58] us it stabilizes us when we can look to
[1:20:01] the Unseen and that message looking to
[1:20:03] the Unseen brother Ram said when a man
[1:20:05] once catches that vision of the
[1:20:06] invisible God and knows that he's always
[1:20:09] present there's something that
[1:20:11] stabilizes that man's thinking it
[1:20:14] stabilizes his action in the time of
[1:20:16] distress and trouble do you catch what's
[1:20:18] being said here it'll stabilize his
[1:20:20] thinking it didn't say that his thinking
[1:20:23] may not try to spiral but there's
[1:20:24] something there to stabilize
[1:20:27] it it didn't say that in the midst of it
[1:20:30] that his actions may not get a little
[1:20:32] bit I don't understand I don't know but
[1:20:34] there is something that's there that'll
[1:20:37] stabilize his
[1:20:39] actions so let's just give Glory where
[1:20:41] it belongs it belongs to the Lord it
[1:20:44] isn't that man that is such a tremendous
[1:20:47] brother a tremendous sister they're
[1:20:49] always saying the right thing and
[1:20:52] responding in in the right way but you
[1:20:54] ain't seen them behind closed doors you
[1:20:56] ain't seen them when they first got the
[1:20:57] news so don't make an idol out of 84
[1:21:00] cents worth of
[1:21:02] dirt let Christ be your example sure we
[1:21:06] see him sitting in the house of God sing
[1:21:09] We recognize we as Mortals recognize the
[1:21:12] struggle within other mortality and we
[1:21:16] know that my brother my sister I may not
[1:21:18] know what you have went through and are
[1:21:20] going through this week but you're still
[1:21:23] standing you had to fight through
[1:21:25] thoughts you've had to fight through
[1:21:27] discouragement you've had to battle but
[1:21:29] look where you're
[1:21:33] at it'll still make him look upward this
[1:21:36] is why it's so powerful this is why the
[1:21:39] necessity of the Holy Ghost teaching
[1:21:41] will give out on you but to have the
[1:21:44] word himself on the inside you can't
[1:21:47] fail it'll make him look upward and
[1:21:49] above the things that are happening
[1:21:51] around him because he's looking at the
[1:21:53] Unseen yet by a promise so he not just
[1:21:58] vague but he's got a promise he's
[1:22:02] looking at the Unseen through a promise
[1:22:05] remember even how
[1:22:07] Abraham when Abraham didn't have a Bible
[1:22:11] but Abraham had received Revelation from
[1:22:14] God he received revelation God had spoke
[1:22:17] to him even by
[1:22:18] Vision when Abraham said I'm going to
[1:22:20] have we're going to have a baby
[1:22:23] the people looked at him and said you're
[1:22:27] crazy I mean think about it but you see
[1:22:30] what Abraham what have been revealed to
[1:22:32] him that nobody else could
[1:22:35] see what did Abraham do he acted on what
[1:22:39] had been
[1:22:41] revealed see Abraham wasn't just going
[1:22:43] along and saying oh this is what God
[1:22:45] Said do and this is what God said Do no
[1:22:46] whatever what God had revealed to him is
[1:22:49] you are going to have a son so Abraham
[1:22:53] made preparation for it when the baby
[1:22:57] came
[1:22:58] along then they saw what he'd been
[1:23:01] talking about brother BR says when we
[1:23:04] can act whatever is in our heart when we
[1:23:06] can act out that Revelation then other
[1:23:09] people see God in
[1:23:12] you see it's acting out what's in our
[1:23:15] heart let me just try to get to a place
[1:23:17] here tonight Ephesians
[1:23:19] 1:1 and whom also we have obtained an
[1:23:22] inheritance being predestinated
[1:23:24] according to the purpose of him who
[1:23:28] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:23:30] his own will I think this is powerful
[1:23:33] because our lives are not spent should
[1:23:35] never be spent on trying to figure out
[1:23:37] how can I fit God into my purpose no you
[1:23:40] got the wrong you got the wrong way it's
[1:23:43] the purpose of him all things work
[1:23:46] together to his purpose it's not seeing
[1:23:49] how God can fit into your purpose what's
[1:23:51] important and where overcoming and
[1:23:53] strength lies is to find out where you
[1:23:56] belong in his
[1:23:57] purpose because that's the purpose
[1:24:00] that's Eternal out of that all these
[1:24:02] other things it's temporal jobs and
[1:24:04] everything else sure God puts it on
[1:24:06] Earth to do a certain thing but that's
[1:24:08] temporal one day if God carries you'll
[1:24:11] not be doing
[1:24:12] that of course I don't know in the
[1:24:14] environment we're in if there'll be in
[1:24:15] retirement but you know if God
[1:24:18] terries we won't we won't be here so
[1:24:21] what's important is to realize what's
[1:24:24] the Eternal
[1:24:26] part the Eternal part that's what
[1:24:28] everything else that we live by we
[1:24:31] operate by so if there's anything that's
[1:24:34] going to be accomplished in our lives
[1:24:36] it's got to be because of his doing
[1:24:38] notice this is what the whole point is
[1:24:40] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:24:42] glory who first trusted in Christ let me
[1:24:44] read this next
[1:24:46] scripture in Revelations
[1:24:48] 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:24:51] the lady oans right
[1:24:53] these things saith the
[1:24:55] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:25:00] beginning of the creation of
[1:25:05] God I want you to watch how brother Bram
[1:25:07] takes this I don't think I put this in
[1:25:09] the in the notes Brianna but just just
[1:25:12] listen brother Bram takes this scripture
[1:25:14] and he says now I want to show you what
[1:25:18] I find in the thought of faithful
[1:25:22] I love
[1:25:24] that I love that the same inspiration of
[1:25:27] God takes it and says regarding
[1:25:30] overcoming the thought of that scripture
[1:25:33] is not so much what we are to overcome
[1:25:37] but it's
[1:25:39] how because the what makes no difference
[1:25:42] once you know the
[1:25:44] how is that
[1:25:47] right the thought of it now watch this
[1:25:49] you know we often talk about the great
[1:25:51] unchanging G Now watch how the prophet
[1:25:53] places this whose word does not change
[1:25:56] and when we speak of him after that
[1:25:58] manner we often get a view of him that
[1:26:01] makes him seem very
[1:26:03] impersonal it is as though God made the
[1:26:06] whole universe all the laws that
[1:26:08] pertained to it and then stood back and
[1:26:11] became a great impersonal God it is as
[1:26:15] though God made a way for salvation for
[1:26:17] lost mankind that way being the cross
[1:26:19] and then when the death of Christ was a
[1:26:22] atone for our sins his resurrection gave
[1:26:24] us an open door to him God just folded
[1:26:27] his arms and stood back it is as if we
[1:26:31] majored in believing in a great Creator
[1:26:35] who having created lost personal
[1:26:38] interest in his
[1:26:41] creation he said I want to say too many
[1:26:43] people are apt to think that way but
[1:26:46] that is wrong thinking thank you
[1:26:50] Lord hey if there's ever a people that
[1:26:53] need this you and I need it the faithful
[1:26:55] and true true witness but that is the
[1:26:58] wrong thinking for God is governing in
[1:27:01] the Affairs of men right now he is both
[1:27:05] Creator and
[1:27:07] sustainer let me just tell
[1:27:10] you none of this right now that's in the
[1:27:12] world has taken God by
[1:27:17] surprise there's things that's taken You
[1:27:19] and I by surprise even over the past few
[1:27:23] years right lot of things but never
[1:27:26] taken God by
[1:27:28] surprise God's in control of it he's
[1:27:31] watching over it he's governing in the
[1:27:34] Affairs of men now notice Colossians
[1:27:36] 1:16 and 17 for by him were all things
[1:27:39] created that are in heaven that are in
[1:27:41] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[1:27:43] be Thrones dominions principalities
[1:27:45] Powers all things were created by Him
[1:27:47] and for him and he is before all things
[1:27:49] and by him all things consist
[1:27:53] he is a sovereign God and by his own
[1:27:56] counsel he purposed The Plan of
[1:27:58] Salvation of his own elect which he
[1:28:01] fornew the son died upon the cross to
[1:28:04] establish the means of Salvation and the
[1:28:07] Holy Spirit carefully executes the will
[1:28:10] of the father he is working all things
[1:28:14] at this moment according to the purpose
[1:28:16] of his own will he is right in the midst
[1:28:19] of it all he's in the midst of his
[1:28:21] church this great Creator savior God is
[1:28:24] Faithfully working amongst his own right
[1:28:27] now as the great Shepherd of the sheep
[1:28:30] his very existence is for his own he
[1:28:34] loves them and he cares for them His Eye
[1:28:38] Is ever upon them oh he says our lives
[1:28:43] are HID with Christ and God I'm so glad
[1:28:46] that my God abides faithful he is true
[1:28:48] to himself he won't lie he's true to the
[1:28:51] word he will back it up he's true to us
[1:28:54] he will lose none of us but raise us up
[1:28:56] in the last day I am glad that I am
[1:29:00] resting in
[1:29:03] his
[1:29:05] faithfulness aren't you glad for that
[1:29:08] and this is that faithfulness the
[1:29:10] prophet quotes being confident of this
[1:29:13] very thing that he which hath begun a
[1:29:15] good work in you will perform it until
[1:29:20] the day of Jesus Christ Christ two more
[1:29:23] scriptures and I'll close the Lord will
[1:29:25] perfect that which concerneth
[1:29:29] me I I believe these ought to be
[1:29:33] confessions if there's one thing we can
[1:29:35] have on our phone instead of having all
[1:29:37] them news apps and liars and everything
[1:29:39] else coming up we ought to have this
[1:29:40] kind of stuff popping up of a
[1:29:42] morning notification the Lord will
[1:29:46] perfect that which concerneth me
[1:29:48] reminder 12:00 p.m. the Lord will
[1:29:51] perfect that which concerneth me
[1:29:53] reminder 300 p.m. the Lord will perfect
[1:29:56] that which concerneth me I'm fine with
[1:29:59] those kind of
[1:30:00] notifications let them be a banner
[1:30:03] everything else in front of me thy mercy
[1:30:06] oh Lord endureth forever forsake not the
[1:30:08] work of thine hands Romans 8:28 and we
[1:30:12] know that all things work together for
[1:30:17] good to them that love God to them who
[1:30:21] are the call
[1:30:23] according to his
[1:30:28] purpose all things even the things
[1:30:32] that are not good he didn't say the
[1:30:35] things are good all things
[1:30:39] work if we can accept it even our
[1:30:44] mistakes will work for the
[1:30:47] good if we're willing to accept his
[1:30:51] Grace Grace place that God would
[1:30:53] instruct us God would move Upon Our
[1:30:56] Lives guiding us back in the right way
[1:30:59] helping us strengthening
[1:31:02] us you know it's not comfortable to look
[1:31:04] at your mistakes it's not comfortable to
[1:31:06] look at where we failed but my heart's
[1:31:09] desire believe it's your heart's desire
[1:31:11] I don't want to displease the Lord I
[1:31:13] want Christ to be glorified in my
[1:31:17] life not a billboard to where that it's
[1:31:20] everybody else has to see but I this
[1:31:22] just for me it's something beyond what
[1:31:24] everybody else sees it's that Assurance
[1:31:27] in my heart it's an assurance that
[1:31:30] listen that runs that runs in our life
[1:31:32] that even takes in our thoughts on
[1:31:37] things our attitudes on things our
[1:31:41] feelings on things because we can be
[1:31:43] very good at hiding our
[1:31:46] thoughts or our feelings about
[1:31:49] things but if we're allowing around you
[1:31:52] long
[1:31:53] enough we know when you're
[1:31:56] faking come on
[1:31:59] church right we don't want to be
[1:32:02] fakers we don't want we want God help us
[1:32:07] Lord are we going to get to a place to
[1:32:09] where oh my when a test or trial comes
[1:32:12] my when we don't feel it in our flesh or
[1:32:14] in our spirit no but it's recognizing
[1:32:16] instead instead of just staying in a
[1:32:20] place of complaining
[1:32:22] grumbling instead of looking at it well
[1:32:25] when this is over I'm really going to
[1:32:26] give a testimony how about just be a
[1:32:28] testimony while it's going
[1:32:30] on I I want to be a billboard that
[1:32:33] displays Jesus Christ I don't want to be
[1:32:34] a billboard that says Hey Brother
[1:32:36] Samuels Under Pressure right
[1:32:39] now friends I'm not putting nobody down
[1:32:42] but I'm saying we don't want to be that
[1:32:44] way because it isn't just about showing
[1:32:46] that to somebody else it's about God
[1:32:49] working in our lives
[1:32:53] he's wants to work in our
[1:32:55] lives and a test or trial is just not an
[1:32:58] automatic guarantee that he's working in
[1:33:01] our lives will we
[1:33:02] yield because Paul said three times I
[1:33:06] prayed God take this from me take it
[1:33:10] from me because you know what Paul
[1:33:11] looked at this is a hindrance that's how
[1:33:13] Paul was seeing it it's a hindrance I
[1:33:16] have to write in big letters my eyesight
[1:33:19] coming and going it is a h
[1:33:25] an but then when God let him know my
[1:33:28] grace is sufficient for you Paul he
[1:33:30] didn't have to tell Paul Paul this is
[1:33:32] why and this is this and this and that
[1:33:34] we realize Paul recognized that that
[1:33:36] messenger of Satan was given to Buffet
[1:33:40] him to keep him in a place so that God
[1:33:45] could actually use him to the purpose he
[1:33:47] was called for and Paul knew he was
[1:33:50] called for God knows you and I we need
[1:33:54] that and this is why Paul said I will
[1:33:58] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:34:01] of Christ that word power of Christ
[1:34:02] means the tent of his dwelling May rest
[1:34:07] upon my life I want him to be pleasing I
[1:34:11] want to be pleasing to him don't you
[1:34:14] Lord that even in the midst I want to be
[1:34:16] able to raise my hands I want to be able
[1:34:17] to worship I want to be able to say Lord
[1:34:20] just give me Grace someone
[1:34:22] Lord what what it is that you're
[1:34:23] bringing out of my that as a test or
[1:34:25] trial sometimes the durations can maybe
[1:34:27] it'll be a little bit longer and there
[1:34:29] are things that God can begin to point
[1:34:31] out in our life that's so
[1:34:34] specific but it doesn't never produce uh
[1:34:37] I know what this is about but it brings
[1:34:40] about when God makes that known Lord
[1:34:43] help me I I I don't want that to be in
[1:34:47] my life in that way I've given excuses
[1:34:51] for it I've given reasons that it could
[1:34:53] dwell in this Temple but now you've
[1:34:56] allowed this to come about to show me
[1:35:00] that there are things to be molded in my
[1:35:04] life the trial never came to destroy you
[1:35:08] the test never come to destroy you it
[1:35:10] came to free
[1:35:12] you it came to free you when they walked
[1:35:15] into the fiery furnace they were
[1:35:18] bound explain to me how the ropes were
[1:35:21] burn off of their hands explain that to
[1:35:24] me how that happened and yet there did
[1:35:26] not smell of smoke on their
[1:35:28] garments how did it burn the bands on
[1:35:31] their hand and not singe the hairs on
[1:35:34] their
[1:35:36] arm you can't explain it the only thing
[1:35:39] you can say is it's
[1:35:41] God and every test or trial that God has
[1:35:44] ordained listen God's not on the outside
[1:35:46] of the
[1:35:47] Furnace when they went entered in amen
[1:35:51] when when they entered in there was the
[1:35:53] fourth man he was already there waiting
[1:35:56] on
[1:36:00] him oh friends Hallelujah he hasn't
[1:36:03] stepped back as an impersonal God even
[1:36:06] when we're in the midst of the test or
[1:36:08] trial he's not far off he's right
[1:36:12] there there's an
[1:36:14] assurance he's right
[1:36:16] there I know where I'm standing with him
[1:36:19] I know what his desire is for my life
[1:36:22] and my heart says
[1:36:26] amen he's right
[1:36:28] there oh I say Lord just mold me make me
[1:36:33] Lord give me the strength I'll say it
[1:36:34] like this as we close in this moment
[1:36:37] give me the strength to
[1:36:40] stand how that I should stand the way I
[1:36:45] should stand give me the strength to
[1:36:47] stand as a Son of God as a daughter of
[1:36:51] God in the midst of a test or a
[1:36:55] trial you love him amen musicians would
[1:36:59] you
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:15] come sometimes we don't get to the parts
[1:37:17] and places I think my we I told you when
[1:37:20] I first started preaching preaching this
[1:37:22] I said it'll probably take three parts
[1:37:24] and I'll move through it that's how I
[1:37:25] seen it when I preached it as one
[1:37:27] message and brother Nathan's but we just
[1:37:30] skipped over a lot of different things
[1:37:32] and
[1:37:33] points but you
[1:37:35] know I believe with all my heart that
[1:37:38] God comes to encourage us and remind us
[1:37:42] he's right there with
[1:37:45] us he's right here with us he's leading
[1:37:48] us he's guiding us I think it's an
[1:37:50] opport opportunity for us as Believers I
[1:37:52] think it is it's a real
[1:37:54] opportunity surely when every test or a
[1:37:56] trial comes our way as a Believer we
[1:37:58] examine our lives and
[1:38:01] remember God doesn't hold anything back
[1:38:04] from you if there's something that's out
[1:38:06] of place or out of line God doesn't hold
[1:38:09] that
[1:38:12] back but you also know that God will
[1:38:14] test you according to the word that's
[1:38:17] been
[1:38:18] delivered it's just like a person
[1:38:20] surrenders their heart to
[1:38:22] God they repent of their sins maybe
[1:38:26] there's things and habits in their life
[1:38:27] they're still struggling with they're
[1:38:29] coming into that place of
[1:38:31] sanctification and they leave out of a
[1:38:34] service or a
[1:38:35] time and they begin to make a confession
[1:38:38] of what God did for them on a service on
[1:38:41] a weekend or wherever it is and they
[1:38:43] begin to confess but B says you as you
[1:38:45] confess what he's done he said you watch
[1:38:47] you to work righteousness in your life
[1:38:51] now watch where the test or trial will
[1:38:53] come you have those at work family
[1:38:55] others around you will laugh at
[1:38:58] you but understand it really isn't those
[1:39:01] people it's the enemy trying to use and
[1:39:04] pull upon
[1:39:06] them to accuse you in a way to pull you
[1:39:09] away from what
[1:39:12] God has begun to do in your
[1:39:15] life then you take a life that then
[1:39:17] begins
[1:39:18] to God is cleaning that life up up and
[1:39:21] here it comes into a
[1:39:23] place desire after desire is leaving
[1:39:26] habit habit after habit things are
[1:39:29] leaving and then Satan will come along
[1:39:32] and try to accuse him well that's just
[1:39:34] you doing it on your
[1:39:36] own you know Works don't get you very
[1:39:39] far it's just you trying to do
[1:39:42] it but say how do I know that that Satan
[1:39:45] watch the effect it has on
[1:39:48] you discern the Spirit not by what's
[1:39:53] being said but by the effect it has on
[1:39:55] you if it's trying to tear you
[1:39:58] down then it's not of
[1:40:02] God because nobody can take desires out
[1:40:05] of your life but God
[1:40:07] himself there's things that you can have
[1:40:10] self-will to say well I'm going to stop
[1:40:12] doing this I'm going to stop doing this
[1:40:13] but what's different is when desires are
[1:40:15] being taken it's because the love of God
[1:40:18] is taking greater preeminence in your
[1:40:24] life habits do not flee out of
[1:40:27] law they flee out of divine love coming
[1:40:31] forth then how the enemy can come around
[1:40:35] bring
[1:40:36] accusation it just
[1:40:39] he the way that he'll try to come even
[1:40:42] when lives his lives have been changed
[1:40:46] transformed by the spirit of God Satan
[1:40:48] will come around and he'll want to try
[1:40:51] to bring accusation with that well
[1:40:52] that's just
[1:40:53] you there's nothing really different
[1:40:56] about your
[1:40:57] life but you see that's where it's got
[1:41:00] to be something that you
[1:41:02] know that within me it's not I who's
[1:41:07] living I never brought this change in my
[1:41:11] life he did am he's taken out the
[1:41:15] desires of world and he has placed his
[1:41:18] own life within H how do I know that
[1:41:21] because he has changed me from Death
[1:41:23] unto life my whole desire is to please
[1:41:27] him that's all I live for that's all I
[1:41:29] care about that's what every decision in
[1:41:33] my life is weighed around and even when
[1:41:36] I've made something a decision something
[1:41:38] I'm a little unsettled about I bring it
[1:41:40] right back in line and say
[1:41:42] Lord is there something that I make a
[1:41:44] wrong
[1:41:46] move see this is
[1:41:49] where we want to be stand
[1:41:51] standing and I tell you stand on what
[1:41:54] God what he's doing in your life stand
[1:41:58] but always keep moving have an assurance
[1:42:01] that you can stand in your
[1:42:03] life where God touches your life God
[1:42:05] draws your life and you keep walking
[1:42:07] with the
[1:42:09] Lord even after the Seal of the Holy
[1:42:11] Ghost has come this is really where job
[1:42:14] was standing accusations all around him
[1:42:17] but to
[1:42:19] know that God is worth
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:22] working oh my you love
[1:42:25] him God is
[1:42:29] working I remember when the Lord first
[1:42:31] got a hold of my life my goodness
[1:42:35] man everything you seem like you're
[1:42:37] walking on clouds man
[1:42:44] alive I can still remember my dad in the
[1:42:46] other in the other church when he was
[1:42:48] preaching in one night dad got the
[1:42:50] preaching and he talked about how the
[1:42:51] enemy wants to come and say well you
[1:42:53] ain't even
[1:42:54] bride and big mouth me sitting on the
[1:42:57] second row or front row I said you got
[1:42:58] to be kidding
[1:43:00] me never forget dad just stopped the
[1:43:03] service and said Samuel thinks I'm
[1:43:07] kidding see I hadn't come into those
[1:43:09] places
[1:43:13] yet what I'm saying is is that the tests
[1:43:15] and trials you know this I'm speaking
[1:43:17] many I'm speaking to Veterans even been
[1:43:19] serving the lord youall longer than me
[1:43:23] but even to recognize does Satan ever
[1:43:25] pull it back does Satan never pull back
[1:43:28] on on anybody and say I tell you what
[1:43:30] man you're right on the
[1:43:32] money no no no remember he's always
[1:43:37] there brother BR tells us like this for
[1:43:39] every servant of God I don't believe
[1:43:41] that's just prophets or that's just
[1:43:43] ministers when I hear brother brm say
[1:43:45] that and I have heard but now I see I
[1:43:47] believe every servant of God is one who
[1:43:49] has a heart to serve God he said Satan
[1:43:51] is always there to accuse that servant
[1:43:54] of God let me just tell you something no
[1:43:57] matter where you're at your walk with
[1:43:59] God you know what the ultimate goal is
[1:44:01] but don't bow down to Satan's
[1:44:06] accusations keep going
[1:44:09] on because he doesn't know you he
[1:44:12] doesn't hold your identity it's Christ
[1:44:15] who holds your
[1:44:16] identity I tell you if this is a service
[1:44:18] that it was a service of salvation and
[1:44:20] God saved my soul I would be on fire
[1:44:23] with
[1:44:24] salvation I would be thanking the lord
[1:44:26] and I'll tell you what the rest of the
[1:44:27] people here would be thanking God with
[1:44:29] you we understand there's more to it
[1:44:33] same thing with sanctification same
[1:44:36] thing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:38] and the Seal of
[1:44:39] God I say Lord keep molding us
[1:44:43] Lord may we stand with that Assurance
[1:44:46] when that all sorts of accusation can
[1:44:49] come around may we stand with that
[1:44:53] Assurance Heavenly
[1:44:56] Father oh
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:00] Lord father how we are so thankful
[1:45:05] Lord in the times of your working in our
[1:45:09] lives times that we're not seeing the
[1:45:12] right hand as far as
[1:45:17] manifestations those are all necessary
[1:45:20] and Lord God we desire him Lord we we
[1:45:23] know Lord Jesus that you're still the
[1:45:25] miracle working
[1:45:29] God but Lord in our lives
[1:45:32] individually I'm thankful we can come to
[1:45:35] a place as
[1:45:38] Believers that in order for us to have
[1:45:40] Victory we don't have to have every
[1:45:43] moment a right- hand
[1:45:48] manifestation Lord not that we're bigger
[1:45:50] not that we don't need you but we
[1:45:52] realize that even in order to stand in
[1:45:55] the time of a test or trial it takes the
[1:45:58] right hand of God to uphold
[1:46:01] us so sometimes Lord when we look at it
[1:46:04] after you have drawn our lives and our
[1:46:06] hearts to
[1:46:08] you Lord you've brought Lord a a
[1:46:10] transformation in our
[1:46:13] lives then Lord God as we are there
[1:46:16] being held in the right hand of God
[1:46:21] Lord how powerful that right hand
[1:46:25] is I think of when the prophet
[1:46:28] himself was standing there and his wife
[1:46:33] had been
[1:46:35] taken then he stood there right up next
[1:46:38] to that little crib that little unit
[1:46:42] where little Sharon Rose was
[1:46:44] at he said he couldn't tell me that
[1:46:47] there
[1:46:48] wasn't a god
[1:46:51] but he what he wanted to try to do is
[1:46:54] convince me that he didn't love
[1:46:58] me oh
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:02] God as that conversation went
[1:47:06] on Satan coming into the
[1:47:10] reasonings the prophet tells us Lord
[1:47:13] every reasoning was agreeing with
[1:47:18] him he said I was about ready to
[1:47:22] say if that's the way he's going to
[1:47:27] be but he said out of that Soul oh he
[1:47:31] said think if that new birth that TI
[1:47:34] poost hadn't been there out from
[1:47:38] within came forth the
[1:47:42] voice though he slay me yet will I serve
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:48] him Lord Jesus
[1:47:51] that's the right hand of
[1:47:53] God it did not take away and bring back
[1:47:57] sister
[1:47:58] hope it did not bring back sister Sharon
[1:48:02] little Sharon Rose it didn't bring her
[1:48:03] back but the right hand of God upheld
[1:48:06] the prophet during that time as the left
[1:48:11] hand was
[1:48:15] working did it all of a sudden that
[1:48:17] moment go away
[1:48:19] no Lord God as those Lord of us that
[1:48:23] have been around the message that even
[1:48:24] though I've ministered on these things
[1:48:26] last fall within some of these
[1:48:28] parts he was in despair he didn't want
[1:48:31] to live any
[1:48:35] longer he went Lord while working on
[1:48:37] those lines to reach out and touch that
[1:48:40] power voltage he took the glove off his
[1:48:43] hand then he said the next thing he
[1:48:45] remembered was waking up on the

[1:57:13] me I think it was just just powerful the
[1:57:15] services the Lord brought here Thursday
[1:57:18] and Sunday
[1:57:20] brother Nathan preaching on that God's
[1:57:23] economy brother Alex who was ministering
[1:57:26] on the adjudicator of a greater
[1:57:28] world just
[1:57:31] tremendous God reminding us and calling
[1:57:34] us to our high calling and then to think
[1:57:37] within that of the economy of God every
[1:57:38] one of us is everything is so unique the
[1:57:42] way that God has made
[1:57:44] us God hasn't made every one of us just
[1:57:46] exactly
[1:57:48] alike even though the calling that God
[1:57:50] has for
[1:57:52] us everything is always it's it's Unique
[1:57:56] it's personal so with
[1:57:59] that comes the personal molding personal
[1:58:03] testing personal because God knows what
[1:58:08] he's wanting to bring out of our life
[1:58:11] when you consider that our light
[1:58:13] Affliction worketh for us an eternal
[1:58:17] weight of glory god getting out all the
[1:58:21] sludge I I I
[1:58:23] hope I believe we understand it you know
[1:58:27] there's things that God used even when I
[1:58:28] taught
[1:58:30] school God will use even others is not
[1:58:33] just things God just this situation
[1:58:35] happen God will use sometimes the
[1:58:37] situations that's around us to help us
[1:58:40] to see the greatness of our need for
[1:58:44] him or just how we need more of you how
[1:58:48] we need you
[1:58:50] you know God will even do that you can
[1:58:52] be witness to somebody talk to somebody
[1:58:55] and you realize it's like running into a
[1:58:57] brick wall all of a sudden why would
[1:58:59] that be well you could say well brother
[1:59:00] Samuel they may not be ordained of it no
[1:59:02] it might be that God has said you've
[1:59:05] done what I've asked you to do now pray
[1:59:08] and look to
[1:59:10] me is that right sometimes it's us to
[1:59:13] get Stones together get the O wood
[1:59:15] together get the sacrifice together but
[1:59:17] only God can bring down the fire
[1:59:21] and so sometimes these things that God
[1:59:22] permits different things to come our way
[1:59:26] it's what we are in God's
[1:59:28] economy that adjudicator of a greater
[1:59:30] World M it was a masterpiece weren't
[1:59:32] they those services I don't just say it
[1:59:34] because they were what was preached but
[1:59:36] say oh God let the word so soak down in
[1:59:38] our
[1:59:39] lives we want to be
[1:59:41] changed we want to be molded Lord help

[1:59:49] has for us I tell you when I listen to
[1:59:51] that I I I listen to that the services
