[27:11] Oh God
[27:12] we know that even if we would be setting
[27:14] the Lord all gathered under this roof he
[27:17] would still be needing the Holy Spirit
[27:19] to bring us in unity Oh God and harmony
[27:23] Lord so Lord we're asking that God even
[27:25] as were gathered here tonight and those
[27:27] that Lord are watching that are

[27:58] our hearts were brought in to speak
[28:00] with Lord those things that Lord that we
[28:03] would have need of Lord that would be of
[28:05] a great benefit in direction to our
[28:07] hearts in this moment Lord we love you
[28:10] and we praise your Lord just commit this
[28:13] service and your hands now the name of
[28:16] Jesus Christ amen amen if you'd like to
[28:21] stand with me if we will stand and read
[28:24] in Acts chapter 11 and certainly want to
[28:28] greet each and every one of you that as
[28:32] you are gathered in your different
[28:34] places and certainly this is not an the
[28:40] ideal setting sometimes myself I've had
[28:44] to stream from home it's not the same as
[28:46] being here and but we're just looking in
[28:50] this time right here in a special time
[28:52] that the Holy Spirit will just you'll
[28:55] come right there where each and every
[28:56] one of us are at he'll minister right to
[28:59] our hearts he knows just exactly what we
[29:02] have need of and so we're just looking
[29:04] to him in this hour we want to go to
[29:07] Acts chapter 11 and I want to read just
[29:09] a few verses of Scripture and then we
[29:11] will let you we'll let you be seated
[29:14] in Acts chapter 11 and verse 27 and in
[29:18] these days came prophets from Jerusalem
[29:21] unto Antioch and there stood up one of
[29:23] them named Agabus
[29:25] and signified by the spirit that there
[29:28] should be great dearth throughout all
[29:31] the world that dearth meaning famine and
[29:34] which came to pass in the days of
[29:37] Claudius Caesar then the disciples every
[29:41] man according to his ability determined
[29:44] to send relief unto the Brethren which
[29:47] dwelt in Judea which also they did and
[29:51] sent it to the elders by the hands of
[29:54] Barnabas and saw may God bless you and
[29:59] as you're being seated and bless the
[30:03] reading of the word you know we I
[30:08] mentioned to as a congregation on
[30:11] Tuesday
[30:13] just just praying about this and just
[30:15] kind of already feeling this direction
[30:18] even heading into last weekend that if
[30:22] it came about that we were something
[30:27] where they narrow the time that we could
[30:29] actually or the number of people that
[30:31] could meet they haven't forced anybody
[30:34] to do anything like that but I I just
[30:37] really felt to comply with that even as
[30:41] people would it would be a sight for
[30:43] people to drive by here that are in
[30:46] quarantine and they drive by the church
[30:47] and see a field parking lot here that I
[30:51] feel would be very disrespectful you
[30:53] know that we we just want to be able to
[30:56] comply I want to be very clear on this
[30:58] as I said to the church on Tuesday this
[31:01] is not persecution we are not facing
[31:04] persecution the scripture that we are we
[31:08] are looking at here tonight I want to
[31:10] just speak a little thought and perhaps
[31:12] go begin into this on God's provision in
[31:16] trouble sometimes and to see that we in
[31:20] our lives we will see upon places in the
[31:24] scripture that God God is not we
[31:27] understand the author of confusion but
[31:29] God has everything right under control
[31:34] he's directing everything and so with
[31:38] within this when we we look at it we
[31:41] find that there are times there's never
[31:44] been anything that was laid in the
[31:47] scripture that that we would not
[31:49] experience suffering but rather we do
[31:52] experience suffering the scripture would
[31:55] say all that live godly in christ will
[31:57] suffer persecution we also suffer in
[32:01] terms of sickness at times we suffer in
[32:04] terms of loss many different things we
[32:07] could go through we're not exempt from
[32:09] that but God has given us a provision
[32:12] that when suffering does come that we
[32:15] are able to endure and to make it
[32:18] through that of the suffering so here we
[32:21] find a setting in the scripture where
[32:24] the the
[32:26] Church there in Judea there in Jerusalem
[32:29] there the Spirit of the Lord has come
[32:32] upon a prophet by the name of agamous
[32:35] but the Branham was clear to tell us
[32:37] that he said this was not the gift of
[32:38] prophecy he said AG Abbas was truly a
[32:41] prophet the Spirit of the Lord was there
[32:44] to speak and to think of God's provision
[32:47] you know God did not have to give this
[32:49] warning to the church and whatsoever
[32:53] God did not even have to express this
[32:55] but you see God is is already he gives
[32:58] sight to his church even though there
[33:02] are things that you know that we did not
[33:04] have anything of this nature or the name
[33:08] spelled out for us but yet we know that
[33:11] within the scriptures that there are
[33:13] things that are already hitting the
[33:16] earth have been hitting the earth there
[33:18] are plagues that have already begin to
[33:20] be poured out when but the RAM will talk
[33:21] about that of influence or was already
[33:24] poured out because of the rejection of
[33:26] the Holy Ghost
[33:28] and yet we we realized that within this
[33:31] in these things that God makes a
[33:33] provision that you and I can have a rest
[33:36] and have a comfort that he has
[33:38] everything under control
[33:39] and so when we we look at it it's not a
[33:42] time of persecution that we are in we're
[33:45] not facing that we want to be I want to
[33:48] be very clear because I believe with all
[33:51] my heart is to live in a time of balance
[33:54] and we're to take our encouragement from
[33:56] the Word of God
[33:57] there's undoubted that the scriptures
[33:59] that maybe that I would read tonight or
[34:01] even others could read in oncoming
[34:03] services but the difference in this hour
[34:06] where the Holy Spirit has anointed our
[34:09] eyes for the Church of the Living God
[34:12] we're not just looking to make it
[34:15] through we are anticipation of the
[34:18] coming of the Lord the rapture the
[34:21] change of our bodies that's where our
[34:23] expectation is at so when we look at
[34:27] this setting of the scripture this was a
[34:29] great famine that was taking place
[34:31] during the days of Claudius Caesar this
[34:34] was prior to the besieging of Jerusalem
[34:37] that was spoken
[34:39] there that would take place by Titus and
[34:42] AD 70 which remember there was not one
[34:45] elect child of God that was caught
[34:48] inside Jerusalem in that besiegement
[34:51] they had received the word of the Lord
[34:53] they were able to look into the prophecy
[34:55] and to think they were alerted in that
[34:58] hour in that moment that they were not
[35:00] caught inside of Jerusalem so the same
[35:03] God is the same God who moved here on
[35:07] behalf of this mean it's the same God
[35:09] that's moving on behalf of our need even
[35:12] here tonight and you know when we we
[35:15] read these scriptures in acts 11 there
[35:17] are some key scriptures that are are
[35:21] given prior to this reading that would
[35:25] take place in the book of Acts and and
[35:27] one thing that I want us to we are I
[35:31] believe we're mindful of it but
[35:32] sometimes we can get away from it and
[35:35] that is Peter has made it very clear in
[35:38] the the the very first part of this
[35:41] chapter that it was the leadership of
[35:44] the Holy Ghost that directed him to take
[35:48] the gospel to the house of Cornelius
[35:50] he's bringing it down that there was
[35:53] God's timing to unlock the door to the
[35:56] Gentiles into that of the gospel where
[35:59] that the Holy Ghost would fall on the
[36:02] Gentiles that were gathered there in the
[36:04] house of Cornelius through their
[36:06] tenderness and receptiveness to the
[36:08] revealed word of the hour where Christ
[36:11] Jesus Christ was revealed from word to
[36:14] flesh he revealed himself by his power
[36:17] through his word and he came upon the
[36:20] elect subjects that he had redeemed it
[36:22] was God who had moved I want you just to
[36:24] think of this this is where a part that
[36:26] I'll be dealing with it God moved upon
[36:29] Cornelius his heart and Cornelius is
[36:31] praying and seeking after the Lord and
[36:35] God is dealing with Peter's heart at the
[36:39] same time remember God is not going to
[36:42] use an angel God's agency is man so God
[36:46] is going to use that agency of man and
[36:48] it will be God because remember it would
[36:51] God coming down and
[36:52] and moving through the his own the body
[36:56] that he created for redemption that God
[36:59] would actually redeem you and I'm and
[37:02] now through the Holy Spirit he committed
[37:05] the word of reconciliation to where that
[37:09] Peter was just a vessel in the hands of
[37:12] God
[37:13] to deliver the word that was to be
[37:16] Express pokken there to the house of
[37:19] Cornelius so this is the thing that
[37:21] happened in this time Cornelius and them
[37:24] were looking for leadership and there
[37:27] was a leadership of the Holy Spirit to
[37:30] direct them into the word for that hour
[37:33] and God always knows God is the one who
[37:36] lines everything up and the whole thing
[37:38] that we'll look at just for a few
[37:40] moments God gets everything in position
[37:43] so we understand this when we look at
[37:46] these scriptures when I I read this part
[37:49] we read for a text where I I look at is
[37:51] the first part of it it clearly gives us
[37:55] to where even then leadership of the
[37:57] Holy Spirit on the timing of wind to go
[38:00] to the Gentiles when to deliver the word
[38:03] and I'll say that the true Church of the
[38:05] Living God is no different is to be no
[38:09] different
[38:09] we are under and to be under the
[38:12] leadership of the Holy Spirit we are not
[38:16] to be dominated by the thoughts and the
[38:18] feelings and the fears of man we are we
[38:22] are not had to be as you know this the
[38:25] the poem would say dumb driven cattle we
[38:28] are to be under the unction of the Holy
[38:31] Ghost in this hour let me just say it
[38:34] very personal we don't take our
[38:35] leadership from any news agency our
[38:39] leadership the pressure of what we do it
[38:41] is to come from the Holy Spirit he's the
[38:45] one to direct you and I he's the one
[38:48] that directs us into the comfort of the
[38:50] promises that he is the one that
[38:52] supplies all of our need and to
[38:56] recognize that even as you know the the
[39:00] disciples would be scattered here and
[39:02] you know there was the persecution where
[39:05] they were scattered
[39:06] of Jerusalem and you know that
[39:08] persecution it had to happen in order to
[39:11] get them out of the boundaries and get
[39:14] the word into the places where it had to
[39:17] go so God also notice he also is aware
[39:22] this dearth this famine is going to come
[39:24] upon the land so God is bringing a word
[39:28] to them in Antioch and in Cyrene and and
[39:31] Venus and all those places God's
[39:34] bringing a word to them there are Jews
[39:36] that are gathered there and a word is
[39:39] being delivered to them of the
[39:41] visitation of where they have looked for
[39:44] the coming of the Messiah and they have
[39:46] looked for the outpouring of the holy
[39:47] spirit now here comes the word to bring
[39:50] deliverance to these Jews that are
[39:52] gathered in these places did all the
[39:54] Jews receive it they did not there were
[39:57] many that stood against it but
[39:59] nonetheless there were there were
[40:02] ordained Jews that were elected to life
[40:06] that were to receive it and as they
[40:09] received it in Antioch remember Paul
[40:12] gathered there as the Bible said a year
[40:15] with them and as they gathered there
[40:18] together then came the news what we read
[40:20] in our text where there was a famine
[40:23] that struck the land and just as God had
[40:27] ministered to the needs in the lives of
[40:30] those who were in Antioch by God
[40:33] depositing of his life giving of his
[40:36] word that would lead those people into a
[40:39] real union and relationship with
[40:42] Almighty God they also would have
[40:45] natural necessities that when the need
[40:48] arose they were able to minister you see
[40:52] the body is under the leadership of the
[40:55] Holy Spirit he is still Jehovah Jireh
[40:59] tonight he is the Lord that provided for
[41:03] himself and if I could say it like this
[41:06] you know it is not for us to be anxious
[41:09] or to be worried you know in this hour I
[41:13] I want you to understand this we are to
[41:16] be a people that change should be
[41:19] even more prayerful than we've ever been
[41:21] before
[41:22] it ought to bring us to be more sincere
[41:24] than we've ever been before in all that
[41:27] we ought to become even more deliberate
[41:30] and intentional in our prayer life in
[41:32] everything because remember it is God
[41:36] that is providing for you and I in this
[41:38] hour the same God that's provided for us
[41:41] all along it has not been our reasoning
[41:44] that has provided for us it has not been
[41:47] our hands it has been God that has
[41:49] directed us and God provides for himself
[41:55] just for a pause just a moment and I
[41:58] won't dwell on this too much tonight but
[42:00] just for a little bit there is a greater
[42:03] this was a famine that was being spoken
[42:05] of here in the book of Acts that was a
[42:07] famine that affected all of Judea this
[42:11] affected there were believers gathered
[42:13] in Judea this was not the believers that
[42:17] were there in Judea when this famine
[42:19] came upon the earth they were not exempt
[42:21] from feeling the pressures of this
[42:24] famine they were not exist from
[42:27] suffering as others of this famine amid
[42:30] you said it personal
[42:31] they weren't exempt from going through
[42:33] the grocery store and not seeing certain
[42:36] cans of food are you with me we see as
[42:39] the bride of Jesus Christ it does not
[42:41] give us a pass from suffering it does
[42:45] not give us a pass but in the midst of
[42:47] this time if we can allow it God will
[42:49] draw us nigh
[42:50] he'll draw us closer to him he'll mold
[42:53] and shape in her lives and make us more
[42:56] fit for the journey this is not a time
[43:00] that we're just you know waiting we'll i
[43:03] I wait til this pass let me just say it
[43:05] to you very clearly do not let our hopes
[43:07] be upon the fact of we're just gonna get
[43:10] back to normal their main dis there may
[43:12] be a new normal let our expectation
[43:15] remain steadfast on the Lord amen that's
[43:19] our comfort amen that's what we're
[43:22] looking to and so there's a greater
[43:24] famine then than even that of a natural
[43:27] family that famine is going on in the
[43:30] land right now it's prophesied in the
[43:32] last day
[43:33] as it was in the Book of Amos of how
[43:35] that God would say I will send a famine
[43:38] in the land God said I'll sin that it
[43:40] will not be a famine for bread or water
[43:42] and truly up to this time let me just
[43:46] speak for our country for the most part
[43:49] in our country we've not had any walk
[43:51] for bread or water and let me just say
[43:54] very clearly in our country we've not
[43:57] had to experience the things that our
[43:59] brothers and sisters have already been
[44:01] experiencing just even a few years back
[44:05] when you know I'll just maybe even last
[44:07] year even when brother you know brother
[44:09] Stephen aballay had contacted me and
[44:11] different ones resources were being
[44:13] committed because the brothers and
[44:15] sisters that were there they didn't even
[44:17] have rice
[44:20] you see these experiences these are
[44:23] things that sometimes we and I've saved
[44:26] this very graciously we become so tunnel
[44:28] vision with things let me tell you
[44:30] they're already experiencing those even
[44:32] brothers and sister in years past in
[44:35] Russia they had to wait in line for
[44:37] bread and wait in line for these things
[44:39] these are not things that are new to
[44:42] them and I just you know I just speak
[44:47] from my heart just of these things that
[44:49] we are we are in in the midst of this
[44:52] time that we see a famine that's in the
[44:56] land that's far greater than in than
[44:58] anything of a want of food I really
[45:02] don't believe there's anybody even with
[45:04] the stores being bare here and there I
[45:05] don't believe there's anybody really
[45:07] that's in want of food but to think of
[45:09] it there's a greater famine and that's a
[45:11] famine for the hearing of the words of
[45:14] the Lord and the Bible talks about the
[45:17] condition they'll wonder from sea to sea
[45:20] they'll go from north to east a run and
[45:24] they'll seek for the word of the Lord
[45:26] and they shall not find it remember them
[45:29] remember the famine will be in the
[45:31] hearing well I'll tell you blessed are
[45:35] you who can hear and that he that hath
[45:38] an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying
[45:40] to the churches it's a time of
[45:43] operation it's a time to be ready it's a
[45:47] time like the Lord spoke to us even last
[45:49] Thursday be ready as brother Jerry stood
[45:52] here in minister be watchful and in that
[45:55] scripture that portion of 1st
[45:56] Thessalonians 5 he read if you'll notice
[45:59] the word sober is mentioned multiple
[46:02] times which means to be calm collected
[46:05] temperent in one's mind the wonder so
[46:09] this there's a greater famine that's
[46:12] going on you see it in people's lives
[46:14] they go to church but they still live in
[46:17] the world they're still up and down in
[46:20] there all let me get personal here you
[46:22] can hear the prophet every day of your
[46:23] life but if you don't have the Holy
[46:25] Ghost your life is still unstable you'll
[46:29] be wandering to and fro you've got to
[46:31] have the token you must have the Holy
[46:35] Ghost when you have the Holy Ghost he's
[46:38] the one that takes that word and your
[46:40] life is no longer life of famine but he
[46:43] reveals himself to you it's a must in
[46:48] this hour it's a time to be checking up
[46:51] it's a time for every heart in every
[46:54] life to really be checking up to be sure
[47:00] glory be to God the Bible would speak of
[47:04] this moment here in the book of Acts it
[47:08] would talk about Stephen you know his
[47:11] ministering about the dearth the famine
[47:15] that encompassed all the land of Egypt
[47:18] and Canaan and great afflictions and it
[47:22] says our fathers found no sustenance but
[47:26] when Jacob heard there was corn in Egypt
[47:28] he sent out our fathers first now
[47:32] remember when Abram left when he came
[47:37] into the land he left the land in the
[47:39] beginning of Genesis 12
[47:41] he left the land because there was a
[47:43] famine he went down to Egypt God never
[47:46] told him to go there is that right God
[47:50] never told him to go there you remember
[47:53] that it was even in times where he
[47:55] returns and
[47:56] 13 that the land itself does not look so
[48:00] good and it's even recalled that the
[48:03] land is barren they're having problems
[48:06] with the flocks and the herdsmen of lot
[48:09] in that of Abraham where they're not
[48:11] finding the sustenance is that right
[48:14] there comes up a separation lot looks
[48:17] and sees the well-watered Plains of
[48:20] Sodom and he leaves the side of Abraham
[48:24] and he goes and pitches his tent toward
[48:27] Sodom eventually we find out what
[48:29] happened Sodom overtook his life he
[48:33] would it would a play it would have been
[48:34] a place of safety for lot to remain
[48:38] under the guidance and direction of
[48:41] Abraham but instead not separating
[48:44] himself not removed any protection that
[48:48] he had around his life but yet Abraham
[48:52] standing there as a believer that even
[48:54] when lot was taken captive Abraham
[48:57] looked in it as though lot lot belong to
[49:00] me God gave me the land he belongs to me
[49:03] so Abraham had power because he was
[49:06] separated and he went and he overtook
[49:09] Kings and brought him back now
[49:14] within this this this famine then we
[49:17] couldn't you know go into that of how
[49:19] that even where God would direct Abraham
[49:23] in a time where Abraham would would go
[49:26] out in Genesis 21 into the south country
[49:31] and it would be what we know as career
[49:33] and God would meet you know we know what
[49:36] Abraham did there you know once again he
[49:39] said Sarah you knows my sister but God
[49:41] after all of that had come about God met
[49:45] Abraham there and remember God revealed
[49:48] himself to Abraham right there and in
[49:51] wells that he dug Abraham dug wells for
[49:55] fellowship he dug wells for Union and
[49:58] God revealed himself there in the world
[50:01] that Abraham dug and remembered there
[50:04] were seven ewe lambs that were offered
[50:06] out there and it
[50:07] that well of bear Shiba which is that of
[50:10] the well of the Sevenfold covenant and
[50:13] then the Bible would tell us that even
[50:15] after this when in Genesis 26 when a
[50:19] when there became a famine in the land
[50:21] of Canaan and Isaac himself left and he
[50:26] went and journey toward arere and God
[50:28] told him come to a place that I will
[50:31] show you and I want you to abide there
[50:33] you see Abraham Isaac the scripture
[50:36] tells us he he prospered there in the
[50:39] Bible said he brought forth a
[50:40] hundredfold but it was something more
[50:43] than just his natural sustenance that
[50:45] God was wanting to do with for Isaac he
[50:48] was wanting to let Isaac know that I am
[50:51] the God of your father Abraham and the
[50:54] god who made the covenant with Abraham
[50:57] and the god who called out your father
[50:59] and I'm the God who will see you through
[51:01] he made himself personal to Isaac and
[51:05] when you read in the latter part of that
[51:07] scripture there's a change after that
[51:09] revelation at the well of Beersheba to
[51:12] where a hamlet he comes there a Babel it
[51:15] says hey we now see that the Lord is
[51:18] with you
[51:19] they recognized god had revealed himself
[51:22] there was a famine it got Isaac in
[51:24] position that God might reveal himself
[51:27] personally to Isaac and reveal his
[51:31] covenant and so God God has a way of
[51:34] taking situations and this is where as
[51:38] believers we have we we want to be
[51:42] sensitive and sure they're things that
[51:45] comes up that's not real comfortable for
[51:49] us there's things sometimes that come
[51:51] but we we don't want to be complainers
[51:54] we want we want to look and sometimes
[51:56] even if you're praying about something
[51:58] and you're praying in a certain way like
[52:01] as mentioned here on Tuesday night I was
[52:03] praying in a manner because I knew with
[52:06] with our boys and you know they were the
[52:09] oldest two are in college and they have
[52:11] labs that they've got to do and and in
[52:13] those classes they meet you know and and
[52:16] I just you know looking at that and I
[52:18] know that they they really it was more
[52:20] than than
[52:21] just college it was about being in that
[52:22] lab and being able to interact with that
[52:25] teacher and so we were praying in that
[52:27] manner and then you know I didn't make a
[52:30] big long thing of it but on Sunday night
[52:32] you know I I mentioned to them and I
[52:34] just kind of dropped in my heart I said
[52:36] you know we're gonna we need to pray
[52:38] differently because I realized how we
[52:41] were praying then and I'll just say like
[52:43] this how I wanted that for them because
[52:45] I knew what benefit how they were
[52:47] looking at that I wanted that for them
[52:49] but God began to move on my heart and I
[52:52] said Lord would now would you direct us
[52:55] help us through this time and we don't
[52:58] know what all is going to come out
[53:00] throughout this time but I'm asking you
[53:02] for your wisdom through this time and
[53:05] there's things that I could share with
[53:07] you that God has certainly made some
[53:10] wonderful provisions that we would have
[53:13] never even dreamed of or thought of and
[53:15] we still wish to have to apply ourselves
[53:17] we still have to trust the Lord but I
[53:20] just think that through it all sometimes
[53:22] which would be natural for us we want to
[53:25] pray and ask God to move maybe in this
[53:28] way but remember God he answers every
[53:31] prayer sometimes the way that the answer
[53:34] comes as maybe not the way that we're
[53:35] praying for it but the greatest thing we
[53:37] can do is say Lord here's my hand take
[53:40] my hand and lead me Lord through this
[53:42] time so God he knows what he's doing
[53:47] when he this word you know Joseph comes
[53:51] into a place of power he comes into a
[53:55] place of authority but remember it's
[53:58] it's the interpreting of the word that
[54:01] has now come to that of Pharaoh by that
[54:04] of a dream there was no other way for
[54:06] Joseph to come out to come forth but now
[54:10] think of how God would have it
[54:13] everything is in his time of how that
[54:16] you know the chief Butler you know when
[54:20] he was told and when Joseph interpreted
[54:22] both those dreams he said hey don't
[54:25] forget me remember me but yet you find
[54:28] it was a glog period of time
[54:31] before the chief buffer but Butler
[54:33] remember
[54:34] but you see a one time for Joseph to be
[54:37] remembered
[54:38] Belinda came a time when Pharaoh had a
[54:41] dream then in that time it was planned
[54:43] now to bring Joseph in position God
[54:47] allows circumstances to rise to get his
[54:50] people in position and this is exactly
[54:53] where the scripture would speak I love
[54:56] this very much in the scripture this did
[54:59] this whole allotment of Scripture is
[55:01] that ties in with Israel prophetically I
[55:03] love it very much and we find that how
[55:05] that the land of Egypt the Bible says in
[55:08] Genesis 41:55 that the land of Egypt was
[55:11] famine and when the people cried unto
[55:14] Pharaoh for bread Pharaoh said unto all
[55:16] the Egyptians go unto Joseph and what he
[55:19] says to you do we understand that
[55:22] scripturally no man cometh unto the
[55:24] father but by me in man there's a name
[55:28] there is only one name that is given
[55:30] we're bad men might be saved and that is
[55:33] through the name of Jesus Christ so to
[55:36] recognize they're in our midst of a
[55:38] famine there is one place that we can go
[55:40] to one that we can go to and this famine
[55:43] covered over all the earth the Bible
[55:46] says that all the countries in verse 57
[55:49] came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy
[55:52] corn because that the famine was so sore
[55:55] in all the lands now I want you to think
[55:57] the scripture would say of all the lands
[56:00] and just like our scripture where it
[56:02] says that there was an in our text a
[56:03] great dearth that covered the world the
[56:05] world meaning the inhabited earth at
[56:08] that time all of this famine had struck
[56:11] that of the inhabited earth and noticed
[56:14] all the countries and and Jacob and them
[56:17] they are not exempt from it God has
[56:22] provided for them in the land but you
[56:25] see God is moving behind the scenes and
[56:29] bringing his people into position is
[56:33] that right now let me just let me just
[56:36] say this we understand that the bride of
[56:40] Jesus Christ is not put in position by
[56:43] national force
[56:45] there's want to lay that very clear but
[56:48] the bride of Jesus Christ God puts the
[56:51] people in the bride by the baptism of
[56:55] the Holy Ghost so but yet God will lead
[56:59] us in position sometimes even if I could
[57:01] say it like this even when we are in
[57:03] position in Christ God God will allow
[57:07] situations God will allow things to
[57:10] arise that calls us to evaluate and
[57:13] reflect on our life and on our walk and
[57:17] this is a time I believe let me just say
[57:20] this to you and I I say it too even as
[57:22] parents this is not a time to be idle
[57:25] you say I'm at home but don't be idle
[57:28] because I dle idle leads to idolatry you
[57:35] then that's exactly what the scripture I
[57:37] can't do what's that tonight but you see
[57:39] all of this times I I'm looking at
[57:41] things all around people are trying to
[57:43] give the kids give the kids something to
[57:45] do give the kids something to do to
[57:47] occupy but as believers we have a
[57:50] scriptural pattern when it speaks when
[57:53] all of this was taken place in the land
[57:55] of Egypt the family got together it's a
[58:01] time to be energized in the promise of
[58:04] God
[58:07] when Jacob he heard the Bible said when
[58:10] Jacob heard that there was corn down in
[58:13] Egypt Jacob spoke to his boys he spoke
[58:18] to his sons and he told them go down
[58:21] there in verse two of Genesis 42 and buy
[58:24] from us fence that we may live and not
[58:26] die now think of this verse for
[58:28] Benjamin's not let go right now this is
[58:34] only the gathering there as they're
[58:36] coming back on eagle's wings but
[58:39] Benjamin's gonna be there at the right
[58:41] time come on somebody
[58:43] Benjamin's gonna be there too right and
[58:45] that notice here it's because
[58:47] everything's got to be in its right
[58:48] position when brother Branham was
[58:50] getting ready to go down into there to
[58:52] Israel remember the Holy Spirit said no
[58:55] this is not this is not the time that's
[58:57] not you that's not you see God holding
[59:01] in position because remember it is the
[59:04] revealing of himself by his power where
[59:08] the fountain is open in the house of
[59:10] David that brings us ceiling to the
[59:13] 144,000 making them ready for his
[59:16] physical visitation and unfolding to
[59:18] them so how God has everything lined up
[59:22] because everything must be in position I
[59:27] love this scripture Genesis 42 verse 5
[59:31] says and the sons of Israel came you say
[59:39] who was coming to get who was coming to
[59:42] receive oil who was coming to receive
[59:46] substance who was coming to receive life
[59:50] it was the sons of Israel who lizard in
[59:54] this hour that comes for life the sons
[59:57] of Almighty God the sons and daughters
[1:00:00] of God the sons returning to the Living
[1:00:03] God there's a word that has come out to
[1:00:06] call us back to the original sacrifice
[1:00:09] and the sons of the Living God
[1:00:12] turning to the original sacrifice the
[1:00:15] original baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:19] hallelujah the sons of Israel came glory
[1:00:26] be to God and Joseph looked at him and
[1:00:29] he remembered his dream he remembered
[1:00:33] his dream how God unfolded mercy in that
[1:00:37] hour they got in position
[1:00:40] you know the Bible also goes into this
[1:00:44] there was a there was a young men two
[1:00:48] sons one of the boys he had it he here
[1:00:53] he is just like the other he had an
[1:00:55] inheritance but for him he wanted to go
[1:01:00] out and live a righteous life I don't
[1:01:04] want I don't want father I don't want
[1:01:05] none to do with this just give me what
[1:01:06] belongs to me and let me go you see
[1:01:09] everything he was worried about he
[1:01:11] wasn't worried about his daddy Betty had
[1:01:14] you gonna make him fine here what about
[1:01:16] my part of the land who's gonna help see
[1:01:18] nothing about his decision was about
[1:01:21] anybody else but himself men shall be
[1:01:25] lovers of themselves you see that's the
[1:01:30] heart of the serpent nature
[1:01:32] it's a lover of self that's why he had
[1:01:38] to take one who was willing to come
[1:01:40] dance end in humility and give his life
[1:01:43] willingly for you and I that you and I
[1:01:47] might received that new birth that would
[1:01:49] deliver us from that old nature that is
[1:01:52] all about self and self will and self
[1:01:56] desires and advance within a heart a
[1:01:58] desire to please Almighty God and yet
[1:02:01] even each and every day we battle with
[1:02:04] that self even yet still that is out
[1:02:07] here even in these mortal bodies the
[1:02:11] things be to God overcoming power the
[1:02:15] word gives us strength we are not in
[1:02:18] famine the word gives us strength to
[1:02:20] bring it in subjection but there arose
[1:02:24] when this young young
[1:02:25] man was out there there owes a famine
[1:02:28] God allowed a condition to arise that
[1:02:32] would cause him to start thinking about
[1:02:34] home he begin to get hungry hallelujah
[1:02:40] you know God knows exactly he knows
[1:02:44] exactly where to get those that belong
[1:02:47] to him sometimes were playing for so
[1:02:51] many blessings that God said I'm trying
[1:02:53] to get him back home and you're wanting
[1:02:54] me to bless him treats brother Samuel
[1:02:59] there's a mighty famine in the land and
[1:03:02] notice but Bible talks about here he was
[1:03:05] he was eating he he would he would have
[1:03:07] even ate the same stuff that the pigs
[1:03:10] were eating but he didn't even have a
[1:03:12] chance to eat that look how low his diet
[1:03:16] had become his diet had become so low to
[1:03:20] where here he was willing to eat that of
[1:03:23] the pigs and yet he could not even have
[1:03:25] that portion he began the Bible said he
[1:03:30] said I perish with hunger
[1:03:33] he knew he was hungry and he knew
[1:03:35] there's only one place I can go I've
[1:03:38] gotta get back to father's house for
[1:03:40] father's house for his prayer let me
[1:03:43] tell you something whether you're here
[1:03:45] or whether you're on the internet you
[1:03:47] might be away from father's house and
[1:03:49] there is nothing in the world that will
[1:03:52] ever satisfy that longing
[1:03:55] you've gotta get
[1:03:56] the father's house and become a part of
[1:04:01] eternal life for only oh Jesus cries is
[1:04:05] their satisfaction hallelujah this is a
[1:04:10] time of preparation amen is a time to
[1:04:14] take that unleavened bread it's a time
[1:04:16] to take that bread of his life the
[1:04:22] Scriptures tell us another account in
[1:04:25] the Book of Ruth here I love this in the
[1:04:31] days of the judges the Bible said there
[1:04:34] came a famine in the land of Israel and
[1:04:37] so there was the man of Bethlehem Judah
[1:04:43] notice the famine came in the land of
[1:04:46] promise
[1:04:47] they weren't exempt that's why we
[1:04:52] realized as as a believer as a child of
[1:04:55] God there's no such thing as a painted
[1:04:57] up picture up or you'll never have no
[1:04:59] more problems you'll never have no more
[1:05:01] stress you'll never have no more tension
[1:05:03] the Prophet tells us when you become a
[1:05:06] Christian you add tension to your life
[1:05:09] but the tension you add is constantly
[1:05:12] it's a blessing am i pleasing to my lord
[1:05:18] there was a famine in the land see God
[1:05:22] is working to get them in position why
[1:05:24] he knows over here in this country of
[1:05:27] Moab is one of my daughters so God would
[1:05:32] take a whole family and move a whole
[1:05:35] family right there because of one that's
[1:05:39] the same God he'd removed Philip from
[1:05:42] the revival that was going on in Samaria
[1:05:45] and brought him down there for one Jesus
[1:05:49] in John 6 for one went by the well Jesus
[1:05:56] don't need a big old list like he's
[1:05:58] serving up some big old buffet banquet
[1:06:00] catered dinner he only needs one hungry
[1:06:02] heart brother and he'll
[1:06:04] my hungry heart he'll provide in that
[1:06:06] little room you'll come back with your
[1:06:08] ass he'll come back where you're setting
[1:06:10] up he is always when he hungry he is
[1:06:14] invited and said Lord fill me Lord you
[1:06:19] know it's a blessing to be hungry Jesus
[1:06:23] tells us that in John in Luke chapter 6
[1:06:25] it's a blessing to be hungry because if
[1:06:30] you're hungry that means you're not full
[1:06:33] it's those that are full right now that
[1:06:37] itself is judgment because the before
[1:06:40] right now leaves Leeds 200s later when
[1:06:44] there's a need for a reality and need
[1:06:47] for a living God it's better right now
[1:06:50] to be hungry and become fool than to be
[1:06:53] fool and be hungry that's what Jesus
[1:06:56] would say it is better to mourn now and
[1:06:58] then become joyful than to be joyful and
[1:07:01] now lead to morning amen because this
[1:07:07] world the reality of it wants that one
[1:07:09] what's that other the reality of that
[1:07:11] other land moves into our heart brother
[1:07:13] it's our deliverance it brings the joy
[1:07:16] of that land into our hearts they came
[1:07:20] into that country of Moab now watch this
[1:07:22] in verse 6 the Bible says then talking
[1:07:27] about Naomi her husband died what her
[1:07:31] sons died all that she has is her and
[1:07:35] her daughter-in-laws what I want you to
[1:07:39] see is through the midst of this look at
[1:07:41] Jacobs attitude look at the slums
[1:07:44] attitude look at how that even when they
[1:07:47] come they're even Jacob's sons when they
[1:07:49] come there and begin to speak with
[1:07:51] Joseph you'll find of how that there
[1:07:53] would even be Judah that would step
[1:07:55] forward in that hour you'll find how
[1:07:58] they would lay their lives on the line
[1:08:00] where Judah said my life in behalf of
[1:08:03] this lad let Benjamin go I put my life
[1:08:07] there on that hand think of it this is
[1:08:10] what I'm looking at is even the
[1:08:12] condition of their hearts
[1:08:14] they had now they were actually being
[1:08:17] relieved of themselves I'm telling you
[1:08:20] when you see right now many of you know
[1:08:22] how it is we see all sorts of things
[1:08:24] right now even right now the spirit that
[1:08:27] has already been pervading the wall is
[1:08:29] even heightening during the midst of
[1:08:31] this time such foolishness that people
[1:08:34] take and pull a paper out of one
[1:08:36] people's part and out of somebody's
[1:08:38] hands such foolishness and nonsense but
[1:08:41] it shows the reality of a people that
[1:08:44] are so in love with themselves oh god I
[1:08:53] don't want to be here during that
[1:08:54] tribulation time hallelujah I want to be
[1:09:00] under the blood and be sealed away
[1:09:02] because I lay in rapture it ain't just
[1:09:07] about that I'm not wanting to be here I
[1:09:09] want to be what he's at and if he ain't
[1:09:11] here I don't want to be here anyway he's
[1:09:15] not welcome I'm not welcome anywhere
[1:09:18] this wired this message is my welcome
[1:09:21] I'm not welcome anywhere had the Holy
[1:09:27] Ghost is not welcome I'm not welcome
[1:09:31] hallelujah then she rolls with her
[1:09:34] daughters-in-law that she might return
[1:09:37] from the country of Moab for she had
[1:09:39] heard how that the Lord had visited his
[1:09:43] people in giving them bread the very
[1:09:47] important spot verse seven so now she's
[1:09:52] heard that bread that the Lord notice
[1:09:55] that the Lord had given his people bread
[1:09:59] she hears about this now what's what she
[1:10:02] does where for she went forth out of the
[1:10:06] place where she was you seem to tell you
[1:10:09] something everyone whether you listening
[1:10:12] whether you here we are chargeable
[1:10:14] before God when you know there's a
[1:10:17] living reality that deals with your
[1:10:19] heart that lets you know you
[1:10:21] can be free it lets you know there is a
[1:10:25] bread that can give you strength to live
[1:10:28] an overcoming life you are obligated
[1:10:30] once you hear the word to Pumbaa word
[1:10:33] receive it and go into action in
[1:10:36] humility and reverence she went out of
[1:10:39] the place that she was in which they say
[1:10:44] something God ain't gonna drag nobody
[1:10:47] guarding dragging nobody to the altar
[1:10:49] God ain't gonna drag nobody in rapture
[1:10:52] it's all about yielding and they went on
[1:10:59] here home they went on the way to return
[1:11:01] unto the land of Judah we find how they
[1:11:05] came they came back Ruth oh or you know
[1:11:08] or fuh she went on her way she went on
[1:11:10] back she went back you know she she did
[1:11:14] not see anything in it for her at all
[1:11:16] Oh forth obviously needed was a little
[1:11:19] bit of discouragement and offer with a
[1:11:21] little bit of discouragement okay I'll
[1:11:23] go on back you see it was a
[1:11:26] discouragement but that discouragement
[1:11:29] itself it encouraged her just to go
[1:11:30] ahead and go on her way but for Ruth oh
[1:11:33] ma
[1:11:34] I think I'll build around tells us in
[1:11:36] the Holy Ghost series he said Ruth had a
[1:11:38] vision
[1:11:39] Ruth saw and Ruth was standing there
[1:11:42] steadfast she said don't you entreat me
[1:11:45] to return back to my people you see this
[1:11:48] gospel that came to the Jews and when
[1:11:51] the Jews family remember in the turning
[1:11:54] it down after every one of them were
[1:11:55] sealed and it turned unto the Gentiles
[1:11:58] there remember as it turned to the
[1:12:00] Gentiles of we who had no promises North
[1:12:04] in the covenants or the Commonwealth of
[1:12:06] Israel but all what joy that it has
[1:12:08] brought to our hearts no wonder Paul
[1:12:11] would write in the book of Romans he
[1:12:13] said lot lot eat Gentiles praise she the
[1:12:17] Lord Saint God for His mercy to you and
[1:12:20] I truly truly Amen they that would love
[1:12:27] Israel love the Lord God's not lost
[1:12:31] control
[1:12:33] this is why you know brother branham
[1:12:37] would say it like this and I'm coming
[1:12:39] down here on this he would mention to us
[1:12:43] he said in in the in the scripture that
[1:12:46] is written there to the lady you'll see
[1:12:48] an age these things saith the Amen these
[1:12:53] things saith the faithful and true
[1:12:54] witness and brother band said it like
[1:12:58] this let me just read this tree he says
[1:13:00] oftentimes we talk about the great
[1:13:02] unchanging God whose word does not
[1:13:04] change and when we speak of him after
[1:13:08] that manner
[1:13:08] we often get a view of him that makes
[1:13:11] him seem very impersonal it is as though
[1:13:16] God made the whole universe and all the
[1:13:17] laws that pertain to it and then stood
[1:13:19] back and became a great and personable
[1:13:21] impersonal God it is as though God made
[1:13:25] a way of salvation for lost mankind that
[1:13:27] way being the cross and then through the
[1:13:29] death of Christ has atone for our sins
[1:13:31] and his resurrection gave us an open
[1:13:34] door to him God just as Bay said it's
[1:13:36] just as though top folded his arms and
[1:13:38] stood back it's as if we majored in
[1:13:42] believing in a Great Creator who having
[1:13:45] created lost personal interest in his
[1:13:48] creation now I say this is how many
[1:13:51] people think but that is wrong thinking
[1:13:55] for God is governing in the affairs of
[1:13:59] men right now he is both creator and
[1:14:02] sustainer for by him we're all things
[1:14:06] created amen he is before all things and
[1:14:11] by him all things consist the son died
[1:14:14] upon the cross to establish the means of
[1:14:16] salvation and the holy spirit carefully
[1:14:20] execute the will of the Father his very
[1:14:25] existence and this are these are
[1:14:26] personal words to us his very existence
[1:14:29] is for his own he loves them and cares
[1:14:32] for them his eye is ever upon them well
[1:14:38] he said I'm so glad that my God abides
[1:14:40] faithful he is true to himself he won't
[1:14:42] lie he's true to the word he'll back it
[1:14:44] up
[1:14:45] he's true
[1:14:46] he will lose none of us but raise us up
[1:14:48] in the last day I am glad that I'm
[1:14:50] resting in his faithfulness let me just
[1:14:59] bring it to this place as we read in our
[1:15:03] scriptures there in acts 11 those
[1:15:07] believers when that would come that
[1:15:10] there is a dearth there is a famine they
[1:15:13] didn't know how long that family was
[1:15:15] going to last they didn't know how many
[1:15:18] years it didn't speak that but according
[1:15:21] to history because they said even in the
[1:15:23] scripture in the days of Claudius Caesar
[1:15:25] it was about to force her into his reign
[1:15:27] sort of been 45 ad but they didn't know
[1:15:30] how long that this was going to last but
[1:15:35] you see there was a comfort that they
[1:15:37] were drawn from it wasn't that they
[1:15:40] didn't feel the pressures it wasn't that
[1:15:44] you know fear wouldn't have tried to
[1:15:46] come around and try to grip but you see
[1:15:50] there was a rest
[1:15:51] there was a comfort through the word of
[1:15:54] the Lord I would say it like this they
[1:16:01] were already given to the Lord but I
[1:16:05] think some things no doubt kind of even
[1:16:07] turned up and they became even more
[1:16:09] deliberate I tell you through this time
[1:16:13] right here I I don't know I really don't
[1:16:18] know what you know hasn't has in store I
[1:16:21] don't know how things oh I don't know
[1:16:23] how things are unfold I know they've
[1:16:25] said you know 15 days but I'm not not
[1:16:27] worried about that in us as I speak to
[1:16:29] our congregation that's not what I'm
[1:16:31] worried about
[1:16:31] but my my heart has always been were my
[1:16:34] concern more than 15 days my concern is
[1:16:37] that every soul be found ready under the
[1:16:41] blood I'd rather every soul be found
[1:16:46] ready to go before the Holy Ghost to
[1:16:50] take this opportunity and this time oh
[1:16:54] god if you dive you know you don't have
[1:16:57] the Holy Ghost
[1:16:58] we can tell it's made real in your life
[1:17:01] say God fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:04] don't occupy and then don't occupy
[1:17:07] yourself with the things of the world
[1:17:10] but what the world's trying to do during
[1:17:13] this time maybe one day Allah will give
[1:17:17] you a marathon and movies will do this
[1:17:19] for free we'll let you have this for
[1:17:21] free we'll let you have this for free
[1:17:23] the trend to put anesthesia in the minds
[1:17:27] of the people to take the minds of a
[1:17:29] what they need to be considering these
[1:17:34] are judgments these are plagues that are
[1:17:37] being poured out and these are temporary
[1:17:40] minor things could pertaining to what's
[1:17:43] going to come it's a time to get ready
[1:17:49] it's a time to be sure there's a time to
[1:17:52] gather the family together it's a time
[1:17:55] to make sure you're under the blood it's
[1:17:58] a time to evaluate your life God have I
[1:18:01] been playing around have I taken coming
[1:18:04] to church for granite have I made little
[1:18:06] excuses here and there yeah I was
[1:18:08] preaching from my heart tonight it's a
[1:18:10] time to evaluate because as the Prophet
[1:18:15] told us in feast of the trumpets he said
[1:18:17] one of these days these will become fond
[1:18:20] memories let me just clarify this very
[1:18:26] clearly I'm looking according to how the
[1:18:31] word and how the Prophet brought it to
[1:18:33] us you say what what is that he said I
[1:18:36] don't see one more thing left to happen
[1:18:38] but they're chrome but the going of the
[1:18:40] church in the rapture every day we are
[1:18:43] living for the change but saying I'm
[1:18:48] waiting on this and I'm waiting on that
[1:18:49] you're waiting on the wrong thing
[1:18:52] it's to be looking to the coming of the
[1:18:55] Lord as the prophets asked the question
[1:18:58] and I read I mentioned it to you they're
[1:18:59] not will the church suffer persecution
[1:19:02] 1964 questions and answers locked the
[1:19:05] early church did he said knows her the
[1:19:09] bride goes in rapture
[1:19:10] sure we might there might be this or
[1:19:13] that here and there but you understand
[1:19:15] what I'm saying they're people that are
[1:19:16] waiting on events to take place waiting
[1:19:20] on this to happen waiting on that to
[1:19:22] happen those are not promises that were
[1:19:26] to be looking at we have a promise and
[1:19:28] what does a real promise do it creates
[1:19:31] expectation and we ought to be expected
[1:19:35] to meet our loved ones then to meet him
[1:19:41] in the air so this is the admonition as
[1:19:47] I believe that leave us with here
[1:19:49] tonight this is what Jesus and I believe
[1:19:52] that those saints of God I believe this
[1:19:56] is what where they stood jesus said when
[1:20:01] he was here standing in a body of flesh
[1:20:05] seeking not what you shall eat or what
[1:20:10] you shall drink neither be you of a
[1:20:14] doubtful mind doubtful means like driven
[1:20:17] on on a sea of time with ways does it
[1:20:23] say me what should I do
[1:20:24] should I should I should I take a
[1:20:26] circuit around time or maybe I ought to
[1:20:28] go to this club or maybe I ought to go
[1:20:30] through this store I'm gonna let me just
[1:20:32] tell you give me something better just
[1:20:34] pray ask God to direct you ask God to
[1:20:39] direct you say lord help me lead me to
[1:20:42] the place you know what I have need of
[1:20:46] for all these things look what this for
[1:20:48] all these things do the nations of the
[1:20:50] world seek after and your father knoweth
[1:20:53] that she have need of these things but
[1:20:59] rather seek ye the kingdom of God and
[1:21:02] all these things shall be added unto you
[1:21:13] fear not little flock for it is your
[1:21:18] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:21:22] kingdom I think of the example brother
[1:21:28] Branham would tell over and over because
[1:21:31] what was spoke right here in the Book of
[1:21:33] Luke Jesus spoke that in Matthew Matthew
[1:21:37] recorded the same way too it was
[1:21:40] speaking in deliverance of anxiety we're
[1:21:49] living in a time where the scripture
[1:21:51] said men's hearts would be failing for
[1:21:53] fear we're living in that hour it's been
[1:21:58] ongoing but we're seeing it more and
[1:22:01] more and we even see even how people and
[1:22:05] and I'm not you understand I feel sorry
[1:22:08] for the people I wish that I could speak
[1:22:10] to them I had a had a Mandy and just yes
[1:22:13] yesterday I think at the house replacing
[1:22:14] something in security-wise
[1:22:15] for us and the only thing I did you know
[1:22:18] he'd mentioned to me and we've had good
[1:22:20] conversations over the past years when
[1:22:23] he's taking care of things for me and I
[1:22:24] you know he told me he said yeah he said
[1:22:26] I you know he said I he said we've got
[1:22:28] he said I believe we've got plenty of
[1:22:29] food there at the house he said you know
[1:22:31] I went to eight different stores the
[1:22:32] other day and I told him I said well
[1:22:34] that you know just a little testimony I
[1:22:36] said my wife and I said when we had to
[1:22:39] go out and get what was on our list I
[1:22:40] said when we had looked it up at Walmart
[1:22:42] they didn't have it I said that what we
[1:22:45] did I said I didn't know what I was
[1:22:46] going to experience when I went out and
[1:22:48] said but I just said lord help us guide
[1:22:50] us and I said you know what God helped
[1:22:54] us to get it wasn't and never is
[1:22:56] anything extravagant but God helped us
[1:22:57] to get the very simplest of things he
[1:23:00] provided for what we had need of I'm
[1:23:02] very thankful for that because that's
[1:23:05] that's how I've always known him to be
[1:23:07] he's provided for us it has not been Sam
[1:23:11] Walton or anybody else that's provided
[1:23:13] for us hadn't been Sam's Club Costco or
[1:23:16] whatever more they weren't provided for
[1:23:18] us God has provided
[1:23:22] and I don't mean this scripture is not
[1:23:25] making light of planning its not making
[1:23:29] light of planning but what it is saying
[1:23:31] is is don't become consumed with these
[1:23:35] things like the rest of the nations do
[1:23:39] don't become consumed and you know how
[1:23:42] you know you can tell when somebody's
[1:23:44] consumed talked to them a little bit and
[1:23:46] whatever they talk about the most it
[1:23:49] tells you what they're feeding on
[1:23:53] brother Samuel I can't help it then do
[1:23:56] you know what do this one thing take
[1:23:58] your phone and put it somewhere else
[1:24:02] get off your new sites and everything
[1:24:04] else because I'm telling you there's a
[1:24:06] lot of alarmist on there anyhow
[1:24:09] I'm sure I may be pastor a few alarmists
[1:24:11] to the things be to God for his
[1:24:16] deliverance we don't need that we don't
[1:24:19] we need the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:21] we need stability and this time our
[1:24:24] children need to it's not we're not
[1:24:26] putting on a show but our children if
[1:24:27] God Terry's friends we don't know how
[1:24:29] long that will be here but our children
[1:24:31] even in midst of times like this
[1:24:33] they need to see the gospel in flesh how
[1:24:39] do we face these times of adversity how
[1:24:41] do we face it do we drift or do we say
[1:24:44] god I'm gonna just become more
[1:24:46] deliberate God just taking ahold of the
[1:24:48] Lord but the RAM tells a story you tell
[1:24:54] it in the message paradox he'll tell it
[1:24:56] in a message absolutely you're familiar
[1:24:57] with it as as message believers about
[1:25:00] the druggist during the time of the
[1:25:03] Great Depression
[1:25:04] he tells brother Branham where there was
[1:25:07] you know the lines were real long a
[1:25:08] doctor could rat out a prescription but
[1:25:10] you had to go down to the county and the
[1:25:12] county would give you the money to pay
[1:25:14] what the doctor had ordered for you he
[1:25:17] didn't have time to go to the doctor his
[1:25:18] wife was expecting here she was she was
[1:25:21] very sick she would have to be she was
[1:25:22] gonna have to be delivered you know at
[1:25:24] any time very hard time he comes
[1:25:27] straight to the pharmacy the young man
[1:25:29] who's there which is the druggist son he
[1:25:32] says to him I can't do this right now
[1:25:34] you got to go and stand in line and go
[1:25:36] like the rest time we can't do this
[1:25:38] but the villa bream says the old
[1:25:42] druggist was a god-fearing man and he
[1:25:47] overheard it and something caused him
[1:25:49] say wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:25:50] son let me see the prescription see this
[1:25:55] is where I look at this how the Holy
[1:25:57] Spirit would direct me to this year as
[1:25:59] I'm just studying here and looking at
[1:26:01] things today to see that the old
[1:26:03] druggist was still set aside enough
[1:26:06] where the Holy Spirit couldn't move upon
[1:26:08] him in this time of the Great Depression
[1:26:10] where people were lined up to get he was
[1:26:14] not where he was although for Londoners
[1:26:15] I'm all stressed out I'm all tense now
[1:26:17] my mother he was still separated enough
[1:26:20] that the Holy Spirit couldn't move him
[1:26:21] like he moves Simeon the Holy Spirit
[1:26:25] could move him to say let me see the
[1:26:26] prescription he could still be moved
[1:26:28] with compassion and he filled that
[1:26:33] prescription and when he went to put
[1:26:36] that prescription in the hand of that
[1:26:38] man but the band said that drug is told
[1:26:42] him he said when I seen the hand I went
[1:26:46] to put the medicine in it was a nail
[1:26:49] scars in that hand nail scars in that
[1:26:54] hand and this was the very thing that
[1:26:56] that druggist that he made mention in
[1:26:58] that time he said brother Branham since
[1:27:01] then Christ has been more to me because
[1:27:06] of doing that for that woman he saw that
[1:27:10] that is in as much as you done unto the
[1:27:13] least of these you're done unto me we
[1:27:15] don't know that even in the midst of
[1:27:16] this town I think as brother Richard
[1:27:18] gave the prayer request even there on
[1:27:20] Tuesday night that in the midst of this
[1:27:23] time let us be sensitive even when we're
[1:27:26] in the store when we're around the
[1:27:27] family's another place you don't know
[1:27:30] the opportunity it can be a time there
[1:27:32] might be a protocol that's in a time of
[1:27:36] famine and they're longing for bread
[1:27:40] they're in a time of fear
[1:27:44] and they need deliverance amen they need
[1:27:48] help they need guidance they need
[1:27:50] leadership let us not be so occupied
[1:27:52] with where we can get the next package
[1:27:56] of chicken the next package of hamburger
[1:27:58] let us be occupied and say God let me be
[1:28:01] set aside like that druggist was because
[1:28:05] that time of depression was a whole lot
[1:28:07] worse many many many many many much more
[1:28:09] than what you and I are facing but he
[1:28:12] was set aside and I really mean this
[1:28:15] with all my heart I've told people
[1:28:18] before if you can't handle Facebook get
[1:28:20] off of it and how to say it very plainly
[1:28:23] to the whole congregation if you can't
[1:28:25] handle the stuff get off of it and let
[1:28:29] God let God just become more real to you
[1:28:35] during this time let our experience
[1:28:38] deeper you know brother branham ends and
[1:28:40] what I just read to you out of the
[1:28:41] message absolute he says I'm not gonna
[1:28:45] call for an altar call he said I'm gonna
[1:28:48] make a consecration call right now
[1:28:51] instead right after he mentioned that
[1:28:53] about the druggist he said we want to
[1:28:57] consecrate ourselves to this absolute he
[1:29:00] said I've consecrated myself and I want
[1:29:02] to consecrate myself a new to this
[1:29:06] absolute of Jesus Christ I think that's
[1:29:09] a great moment in this time where we see
[1:29:12] taking place God moving for our lives
[1:29:17] and our needs and this time God becomes
[1:29:20] will become more dear to our hearts
[1:29:23] whether you hear whether you're out on
[1:29:25] the internet if you don't know the Lord
[1:29:27] in a personal way if you if you've never
[1:29:31] accepted him as your Savior this is a
[1:29:33] good time it's a good time to settle
[1:29:35] that make peace with God we have peace
[1:29:38] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:39] it's a good time to repent it's a good
[1:29:42] time if you've never been baptized in
[1:29:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not
[1:29:45] out of fear but because you recognize
[1:29:48] I'm not where I need to be and if you've
[1:29:50] not received the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:53] Ghost it's a time to say God let the
[1:29:56] determination
[1:29:57] of your grace come upon me Lord God
[1:29:59] because you won't pull me through a pipe
[1:30:01] or push me through the let me Lord lead
[1:30:04] me to a place of total surrender may we
[1:30:11] take this opportunity may we allow the
[1:30:14] Holy Spirit to build his kingdom into
[1:30:17] our lives I know I'm speaking maybe to
[1:30:20] many that are just even outside of our
[1:30:22] assembly but I just just speak to all of
[1:30:25] our hearts we're not to be governed by
[1:30:29] fear amen the Holy Spirit is not he not
[1:30:33] given us a spirit of fear but a power of
[1:30:35] a science on mind amen let's just bow
[1:30:39] our heads
[1:30:40] father more tonight we have come and
[1:30:47] we've gathered here Lord under these
