[36:07] tonight if you would to Psalms 32 I'd
[36:11] like to go back there tonight and just
[36:14] want to make mention to you here that we
[36:20] had mentioned about a fellowship after
[36:22] church on Sunday there at brother
[36:25] Richard and sister Maria's and if the
[36:27] weather was permitting and we just went
[36:29] ahead the weather just really doesn't
[36:31] seem to be cooperating and so we'll just
[36:33] postpone that off and we have some
[36:35] different fellowships that are actually
[36:38] planned out that we have set aside and
[36:40] some of the upcoming times so we'll get
[36:43] that information to you and I know
[36:46] brother Richard and sister Maria they
[36:48] had asked me just to to share that you
[36:50] know depending on the weather maybe in
[36:53] an upcoming Sunday if if it works out
[36:56] after everyone has eaten and things like
[36:59] that to be able to come over and and I
[37:02] know for the young people and everyone
[37:04] to come over for a little bit of
[37:05] fellowship we'll just keep you posted on
[37:07] that but as far as this coming Sunday
[37:09] that's been canceled so you just want to
[37:13] make you aware of that let's look here
[37:15] in the word of the Lord and I want to
[37:17] say I certainly appreciate that special
[37:18] tonight
[37:20] amen really really appreciate that amen
[37:25] Psalms 32 let's look at verse 7 we'll
[37:29] just we'll just start there tonight
[37:31] thou art my hiding place thou shalt
[37:36] preserve me from trouble
[37:39] thou shall compass me about with songs
[37:42] of deliverance Sayla look at this I will
[37:49] instruct thee and teach thee in the way
[37:53] which thou shalt go I will guide thee
[37:57] with mine I be not as the horse or as
[38:03] the mule which have no understanding
[38:06] whose mouths must be held in with bit
[38:09] and bridle lest they come near unto thee
[38:12] many sorrows shall be to the wicked but
[38:15] he that trusteth in the Lord mercy shall
[38:19] compass him about be glad in the Lord
[38:22] and rejoice you righteous and shout for
[38:25] joy all ye that are upright in heart
[38:30] amen let's continue tonight looking at
[38:36] that thought on looking through the
[38:38] prophetic limbs and just like you may
[38:41] God bless you as you're being seated
[38:43] just like you to draw your attention to
[38:46] back there into the verse verse eight
[38:49] and recognizing that the prophetic
[38:57] itself is never as never left and has
[39:00] never gone from the Church of the Living
[39:02] God because the promise that the Lord
[39:06] Jesus had made is that when he went away
[39:09] that he said I will send the Spirit of
[39:12] Truth back to you and he will lead and
[39:16] guide you into all truth and he'll bring
[39:19] to room to your remembrance the things
[39:21] whatsoever that I've said unto you so we
[39:25] we recognize that when we look here at
[39:28] the promise and to see that that God's
[39:31] faithfulness and I trust that we can
[39:33] look at that tonight and look into the
[39:35] word and you notice that in in verse
[39:38] eight as we were reading there this is
[39:41] not a maybe but it is I will I will
[39:45] instruct you on or the word there
[39:47] meaning I will cause you to act
[39:49] circumspectly or in wisdom to have good
[39:52] success I will instruct the gods not
[39:57] interested in failure he's not the god
[39:59] of failure Amen that's that's not that's
[40:03] not an attribute of God whatsoever and
[40:05] if we're born of God and attributes of
[40:08] God and that doesn't lay within that
[40:10] attribute of God and this is God's
[40:12] desire that that within the he will
[40:15] instruct us and that he would teach us
[40:18] in the way in which we would go and and
[40:21] that word I thought I was begin to look
[40:23] at that word teach and looking over it
[40:25] here within the in the Hebrew as it's
[40:27] mentioned it deals with directing like
[40:30] like a flow of water or we're in that an
[40:33] arrow would hit its mark God's
[40:36] interested in and there would be a flow
[40:38] and I look at that and to see what God
[40:41] is saying that the instruction is not
[40:43] something that would just remain as
[40:46] though a letter and it's something you
[40:48] can move away from but you see God
[40:50] instructs us in his word and we give
[40:52] ourselves to the instruction and the
[40:55] wisdom of the Lord and to realize that
[40:57] that real wisdom of God is not something
[41:00] that is it that is just confined to a
[41:03] letter but it is actually the very
[41:05] Spirit of God that when we can allow
[41:07] that word to have the right-of-way in
[41:09] our life it will produce just exactly
[41:12] what he said it will produce it's God's
[41:15] desire that the word itself would be
[41:18] able to flow through our lives and I
[41:21] think about when the word itself is
[41:23] flowing through our lives within the
[41:25] word there is not there is nothing
[41:27] impure but it as a matter of fact it is
[41:30] all purity and that word when it flows
[41:33] through in our lives it has the power
[41:35] within it to dissolve every doubt it has
[41:39] the power within it to cast out fear it
[41:42] has within it the power to stabilize and
[41:45] that you and I can begin to walk
[41:47] with even an expectation to to have
[41:50] something in a heart to say I'm looking
[41:53] for this to be fulfilled it flows
[41:56] through our life it's it's not just
[41:58] something that we hear but it's
[42:00] something that becomes a part of us and
[42:02] we become a part of it
[42:04] and so when we're looking at that word
[42:07] that I believe with all my heart that
[42:09] it's God's designed this words gonna hit
[42:11] the mark and let me just tell you
[42:13] something this word hitting the mark
[42:14] it's not left up to you and I for he and
[42:17] he never put any contingencies in here
[42:20] about you and I he said I will you see
[42:23] we're under his care
[42:25] we're under his tutorship were under his
[42:28] guidance he said I will instruct thee I
[42:31] will teach thee in the way that thou
[42:33] shalt go and they're wonderful to know
[42:35] that when you're walking in the will of
[42:38] God that that even if you should
[42:40] somewhat get out of the way that if
[42:42] you're walking in his will that God will
[42:44] bring you right back in line you know
[42:47] that's where the Prophet wouldn't
[42:48] instruct us and it said mistakes have
[42:50] nothing to do with it whatsoever he said
[42:53] as a matter of fact when you're walking
[42:55] in the path of duty and you said you
[42:58] would make a mistake he said God is
[43:00] obligated to bring you right back into
[43:03] the path of duty we could go down
[43:05] through the scriptures and show that of
[43:08] how many examples down through time of
[43:10] where different ones have made their
[43:12] mistakes but yet they but yet in the
[43:15] path of duty God would bring them right
[43:17] back in line we can look at Abraham's
[43:19] life and we don't even have to go any
[43:21] further but to see when God has made a
[43:23] promise it is God obligating himself to
[43:27] bring that word to pass hallelujah and
[43:30] then I look at this you know tonight as
[43:33] I go into that next part of it I will
[43:35] guide thee with mine I you know this
[43:39] word God here is one who is set to
[43:42] advise to give purpose to give counsel
[43:45] it's one who is ever present and this is
[43:49] what God is letting it be known that
[43:52] whether you feel me or not I'm present
[43:55] there to give you counsel to advise
[43:58] to unfold the purpose and the plan that
[44:01] I have laid for your life this is God's
[44:04] promise now I want to just just look
[44:08] here at a had a few of these scriptures
[44:11] here tonight if we could even kind of
[44:13] look at it there just a little bit and
[44:15] you think of how that you know even
[44:17] within in the scriptures you know in in
[44:21] in Psalms 25 verse 9 and 10 I know they
[44:23] may not have some of it up don't worry
[44:25] about it tonight
[44:26] in Psalms 25 9 and 10 the Bible says the
[44:29] meat he will guide in judgment and the
[44:32] meek will he teach his way I say God
[44:35] help me to be me because the meek shall
[44:38] inherit the earth
[44:39] and all the paths of the Lord are mercy
[44:43] and truth unto such as keep his covenant
[44:46] and his testimonies the Bible goes on to
[44:49] say in Psalms 33 18 behold the eye of
[44:52] the Lord is upon them that fear him and
[44:56] upon them that hope in his mercy in
[44:59] proverbs 3 verse 5 and 6 it says trust
[45:03] in the Lord with all thine heart and
[45:06] lean not unto thine own understanding
[45:08] and in all that ways acknowledge him and
[45:11] he shall direct thy paths glory what a
[45:15] what a promise that we have and you know
[45:18] God let it be known right here he says
[45:20] don't be like the horse don't be like
[45:23] the mule that that has to have a bribe a
[45:26] bit and a bridle whereby it is turned
[45:29] about from here and there but but rather
[45:32] walk and go about with a real
[45:34] understanding
[45:36] that's God's desire is that we would
[45:39] live and that we would go about with a
[45:41] real true understanding in our life and
[45:44] you know what understanding isn't about
[45:47] your mental faculties up here the real
[45:49] chief of it is is to understand his
[45:52] presence is to understand that he's the
[45:55] one speaking because remember your faith
[45:58] cannot be in your intellect your faith
[46:00] can not even be about what you can put
[46:03] together here
[46:04] is that God has spoken and even when you
[46:08] notice lack the brother man talks about
[46:10] the black brother we're in that he said
[46:12] he said to that man he said what if God
[46:14] told you to walk through a brick wall he
[46:16] said I would walk and I would be
[46:18] faithful to that because if God told me
[46:21] to do it when I got to that place that
[46:23] would be open for me
[46:26] faith is not sight faith does not need
[46:30] to see it as a matter of fact faith
[46:32] itself is a complete trust and reliance
[46:35] and what God has said a lot of things in
[46:41] itself can can happen that seem contrary
[46:43] but yet God is faithful now look at this
[46:47] you know within within the scripture I
[46:49] look at this things and you don't have
[46:51] to display a lot yet because then
[46:53] they'll get lost within that you don't
[46:54] have to do that and when I look at this
[46:56] within within the scripture I look back
[46:59] into st. John's 5 if you want to go with
[47:02] me to st. John 5:17 I realized that it's
[47:05] not there so let's just look in st. John
[47:07] 5:17 tonight if you just give me that
[47:10] scripture there that'll be fine you may
[47:16] have to turn with me a little bit
[47:17] tonight in the Bible evidently I sent
[47:21] him the wrong thing in st. John 5:17
[47:30] look what Jesus sent here jesus answered
[47:34] him to send my father work as hitherto
[47:36] and I work therefore the Jews sought the
[47:39] more to kill him because he not only had
[47:42] broken the Sabbath but said also that
[47:44] God was his father making himself equal
[47:47] with God then answered Jesus and said
[47:51] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[47:53] the son can do nothing of himself but
[47:56] what he seeth the father do for what
[48:00] things soever he doeth these also doeth
[48:03] the son likewise now look at this
[48:07] channel that is opened up God God has
[48:10] got himself a son again are you with me
[48:14] just like it was there in the beginning
[48:16] in the garden
[48:18] God had a son there in the garden he was
[48:20] able to reveal and make things known to
[48:23] Adam and Adam was able to speak
[48:26] according to the very mind and the
[48:28] desire of his father and now when you
[48:31] look at here that God's desire this was
[48:34] not something that would just be
[48:36] confined to the Lord Jesus but it was
[48:39] God's desire that this would be restored
[48:42] and brought back - to the Church of the
[48:45] Living God for in that he said the son
[48:48] can do nothing of himself but what he
[48:50] seeth the father do what thing soever he
[48:53] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[48:56] so there's a channel that's open you
[48:59] know Jesus was not walking just by the
[49:02] letter but it was intact there was a
[49:04] channel that was open to where the word
[49:07] within that day that was promised within
[49:10] that hour of a messiah he was actually
[49:13] seeing it be fulfilled and there was a
[49:16] channel that he himself was moved in to
[49:20] see what the father one had done in that
[49:22] hour we would call that and know that to
[49:24] be divine revelation for the father look
[49:28] at this for the father loveth the son
[49:30] and show with him all things that
[49:33] himself doeth and he will show him
[49:36] greater works than these that ye may
[49:38] Marvel and that wonderful you see you
[49:42] have to walk in what God is showing you
[49:44] now you see what God is showing when we
[49:48] look at the will of God there are many
[49:50] things that are laid out within his word
[49:52] you think of even God's will there are
[49:54] many things that Paul would even talk to
[49:56] the church there and even in the book of
[49:59] Thessalonians where he would say that
[50:02] what is the will of God to know how to
[50:03] possess your vessel under sanctification
[50:06] and honor that was to know the will and
[50:08] and in order for more to be open you
[50:10] have to obey what God has already set
[50:13] forth because God's not going to add to
[50:17] what is not being followed but you see
[50:20] as we as we walk within his will his
[50:23] word that he opens then there's more
[50:25] that will unfold to us within that hour
[50:27] and this is exactly where the Lord Jesus
[50:30] I love the scrip
[50:31] sir in verse 30 he says I can of my own
[50:34] self do nothing do you realize that body
[50:38] itself of the Lord Jesus could
[50:40] absolutely do nothing it was not the man
[50:44] Jesus who healed anybody it was not the
[50:48] man who healed but it was God Himself
[50:51] that was dwelling behind that vessel
[50:54] this is where that the man who himself
[50:57] remember when the Lord Jesus moved and
[51:00] He healed his eyes and you know they're
[51:02] asking him you know who do you say is
[51:04] and and he turns to those Pharisees and
[51:06] he says hey but these things have never
[51:09] been done since the world was was begin
[51:12] he said it had to be that God is with
[51:15] him so he recognizes that it's God that
[51:18] has done the work oh my I can't amount
[51:23] cell do-nothing huh
[51:24] I'll tell you this right here if this is
[51:26] the testimony and it is and it was the
[51:29] testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ then
[51:31] it is absolutely the testimony of each
[51:34] and every child of God I can of my own
[51:38] self do nothing I need him I need his
[51:44] strength I need him it's when we think
[51:50] that we can do something is when we get
[51:52] in trouble that's always every failure
[51:56] it's never been God has failed it's when
[51:58] we and ourselves get to relying upon our
[52:01] own self say lord help me not rely upon
[52:04] my own understanding but notice what he
[52:07] says here as I hear I judge and my
[52:12] judgment is just because I seek not mine
[52:18] own will but the will of the Father
[52:21] which has sent me if this would be
[52:24] applied when any thought comes to your
[52:26] mind or it would come to our mind
[52:28] there's been a lot of things we dismiss
[52:30] a whole lot quicker there have been a
[52:33] lot more things that we would not try to
[52:35] account as spirituality we would
[52:37] discount it and say that is not of God
[52:39] by judging is there virtue is there
[52:42] praise is there
[52:43] what is within this notice how he judged
[52:47] he said my judgment is just how can his
[52:50] judgment be just this was spoke of in
[52:52] the Book of Isaiah how can this be
[52:54] because he did not give himself to
[52:57] himself he gave himself to the father
[53:00] that dwelled within him in the message
[53:03] total deliverance I love the statement
[53:04] the Prophet makes here he said he
[53:07] himself was fully a man within his body
[53:11] but he said the inside was fully and
[53:14] completely God because that's the
[53:17] mystery God was in Christ reconciling
[53:19] the world to himself and the Prophet
[53:23] make goes on to make this statement in
[53:25] that same quote he said he could have
[53:27] been a man because he was a man but he
[53:31] chose to submit his outer parts to the
[53:35] inner of the spirit that dwelled within
[53:37] him and he did not walk by the outside
[53:41] he walked by the inside he could have
[53:44] been a man euros you could be a man you
[53:46] could be a woman you can live within a
[53:49] confinement to a natural realm of your
[53:52] first birth but when you are invited to
[53:55] be partakers of that new birth and you
[53:58] walk within that of the real born-again
[54:01] experience you're no longer confined to
[54:04] the census of this earth but you have
[54:06] been raised up out of those senses and
[54:09] you can choose to be a man you can
[54:12] choose to be a woman but when you are
[54:14] redeemed you no longer wants your own
[54:16] choice no longer do you want your choice
[54:20] anymore you want what he wants that's
[54:24] the real evidence of the Holy Ghost I
[54:26] said that's the real evidence of the
[54:28] Holy Ghost not if you can speak in
[54:30] tongues not even as the Prophet said
[54:32] your reaction to the spirit it's not the
[54:34] evidence but the real evidence is when
[54:37] that change has moved to the inside and
[54:39] Almighty God has so realigned and he has
[54:43] changed your very desires on the inside
[54:46] to where it is Christ that has been made
[54:48] alive to you it's so much deeper than
[54:51] just living a
[54:52] clean moral life but it actually becomes
[54:54] what Christ Himself is the very theme
[54:57] and heartbeat of your life it's more
[55:01] than belonging to a church it's
[55:03] something you realize I'm a part of him
[55:08] this great I nine this great eye of
[55:12] Jehovah Jesus was looking through this
[55:14] eye we talked about that the last time
[55:17] when Simon came up and he he could say
[55:20] well your name is Simon you're the son
[55:23] of Jews he talked about when he
[55:26] identified him Nathanael and the famous
[55:29] said when did you know me I knew you
[55:30] before Philip college here I saw you
[55:33] what was he looking through he was
[55:36] looking through the eye of Jehovah he
[55:39] was looking through this eye that were
[55:41] reading about tonight it was not the
[55:43] natural eyes of the virgin born body but
[55:46] there was within him he was ordained to
[55:49] be able to look through the eye of God
[55:53] glory be to God and the prophets the
[55:56] prophets themselves think of it the
[55:58] prophets that lived down through time
[56:01] and how they were moved in the spirit
[56:03] house how that Isaiah himself would be
[56:05] lifted up in the spirit to think of this
[56:08] when Isaiah prophesied that a virgin
[56:10] shall conceive that is against the
[56:12] normal thinking that had never been done
[56:16] there was nothing there was no scripture
[56:19] as far as all this had been done before
[56:20] there was nothing that had been based
[56:23] upon that but Isaiah was anointed within
[56:27] that he was raised up as the prophet put
[56:29] it like this he raised up out of his
[56:32] senses and when Isaiah prophesied I'll
[56:35] tell you when you read Isaiah 53
[56:37] you don't read something that is coming
[56:39] in a future tense but it says it like
[56:41] this he was bruised he said we were
[56:45] healed it was already finished in the
[56:49] mind of God when the lamb was slain from
[56:51] the foundation of the world I tell you
[56:53] what looking through the eye of God will
[56:55] do it'll let you see your healing
[56:58] it'll let you see your deliverance it'll
[57:01] let you see the rapture it'll let you
[57:03] see yourself in Christ
[57:05] that's what looking through the eye of
[57:07] God does not through mind not through my
[57:10] lens you'll never see yourself through
[57:13] my lens I can't see myself through your
[57:16] lens but I must be able to and it is
[57:19] only by seeing ourselves for his lens
[57:24] hallelujah God's eye oh my it's always
[57:27] been with the prophets down through the
[57:29] ages always been there the announcement
[57:33] of what was coming they could see ahead
[57:35] of time amen
[57:37] what was going to happen and I think of
[57:40] this within the scripture you know
[57:41] Abraham himself you know think of that
[57:45] that eye of God that's the same little
[57:47] white light that remember when Abraham
[57:49] wanted to know you how is this going to
[57:51] be how you gonna give him how is this
[57:54] going to be your saying I'm gonna have
[57:55] an air and the air is going to come
[57:57] forth out of my loins tell me how this
[57:59] is going to happen have all my how is
[58:03] the air going to come from the loins
[58:05] into manifestation how is the air gonna
[58:09] come from the loins into manifestation
[58:11] do you realize you and I has Paul said
[58:14] we were in the loins of Almighty God we
[58:17] were in the loins of God's mind and when
[58:19] God Himself became flesh we were
[58:22] transferred to the loins of Jesus and we
[58:25] were there we went to Calvary in him we
[58:28] died in him and we roles in him and
[58:33] Abraham said how is this going to be how
[58:37] would it be it is made possible through
[58:39] the Passover of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:43] whereby that life would come forth after
[58:47] the shedding of the blood to bring you
[58:49] and I into our land of promise
[58:51] what's your love him tonight remember
[58:54] this wasn't something where Abraham is
[58:56] totally out of commission it's God
[59:00] coming down between the sacrifices and
[59:03] God said I will
[59:05] I will it's that white life that logos
[59:09] that pillar fire its Christ that came
[59:13] down there I think of this there's such
[59:16] an assurance within the Covenant of
[59:19] God's Word I want you to look here in
[59:23] the Bible in John 3 and maybe I just
[59:26] refer to this here when Jesus come he
[59:29] spoke to them and he let him know that
[59:32] except a man be born again he cannot see
[59:36] the kingdom of God except he's born
[59:40] again he can't see the kingdom of God
[59:42] now I want you to think of this here
[59:44] just for a moment Nicodemus you know
[59:47] asked him the Christian how can a man be
[59:49] that is born when he's old how can he
[59:52] enter into the second time into his
[59:54] mother's womb and be born Jesus answers
[59:56] to him and says except a man be born of
[59:59] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:00:02] into the kingdom of God so there's an
[1:00:06] entrance into the kingdom of God as a
[1:00:09] matter of fact remember when when Jesus
[1:00:11] stood here before Pilate Pilate in them
[1:00:14] were looking to him as though that he
[1:00:16] had an earthly Kingdom he was a king but
[1:00:19] he was not a king of an earthly domain
[1:00:21] he was not the king of this world but
[1:00:25] here was the king of glory come down in
[1:00:28] such humility and what the king or the
[1:00:32] Prince of this world were Satan had
[1:00:34] taken it by deceit here was one who was
[1:00:37] standing there that was laying a claim
[1:00:40] and was going to bring back what
[1:00:43] rightfully belong to Almighty God and
[1:00:46] what belong to the sons and daughters of
[1:00:48] God he's laying claim on it and he's
[1:00:51] letting it be known this kingdom this
[1:00:53] world is not my kingdom if it was my
[1:00:57] subjects would act like this world does
[1:00:59] but my subjects is not of this kingdom
[1:01:03] he's letting it be known he is the king
[1:01:06] of a kingdom and he has some subjects
[1:01:12] and he's standing here this kingdom of
[1:01:14] God you know the kingdom of God is not
[1:01:17] something that can be explained it can't
[1:01:20] be explained you you you you you would
[1:01:23] you would run yourself in the ground
[1:01:25] trying to explain it because it can't be
[1:01:27] explained the kingdom of God is not
[1:01:31] something of natural it's the very
[1:01:33] spiritual essence of the very person of
[1:01:37] Almighty God it's God's own life his
[1:01:40] word made power there's a kingdom and
[1:01:45] you know anytime that there's a kingdom
[1:01:47] you know where a person is a part of a
[1:01:49] kingdom you know you can you can tell
[1:01:51] what kingdom they're part of you can
[1:01:53] tell maybe what part of the world they
[1:01:54] come from you know I think you know we
[1:01:57] were here in Sandusky here if just a few
[1:01:58] weeks back and I know you know times
[1:02:01] past when we would go there into
[1:02:04] Sandusky and sometimes you'd see
[1:02:05] different ones
[1:02:06] you know how they maybe looked and now
[1:02:08] they're walking around you could tell
[1:02:10] just by the way they looked and the way
[1:02:11] they're walking around you said they're
[1:02:13] not Americans
[1:02:15] you could you could look at and say
[1:02:19] that's a foreign student right there you
[1:02:21] can just tell by the way that it is and
[1:02:24] listen let me tell you something just
[1:02:26] the way that the other countries can
[1:02:27] pick you and I out and say those are
[1:02:29] Americans there's a way that we walk and
[1:02:32] we carry ourselves come on somebody you
[1:02:36] see what it is it's this this reflection
[1:02:38] of this land that we are here a land of
[1:02:41] our first birth or Nativity but yet when
[1:02:43] were born again of the Spirit of God we
[1:02:46] receive the life of that other kingdom
[1:02:49] and we have been raised up out of
[1:02:51] darkness and translated as Paul said
[1:02:53] into the kingdom of his dear son and
[1:02:56] we're no longer under the rule and the
[1:02:59] Dominion of our first birth there has
[1:03:01] been a change of administration on the
[1:03:04] very throne of our hearts aren't you
[1:03:05] glad when that's when that
[1:03:07] administration has changed there are
[1:03:09] things that maybe under the previous
[1:03:11] administration you walked according to
[1:03:13] certain laws you walked according to the
[1:03:15] Prince of power of the air but when this
[1:03:18] new administration moved in
[1:03:20] when this new king moved on the inside
[1:03:22] you are no longer confined and bound by
[1:03:25] those laws but you yourself have been
[1:03:28] made free by the very spirit of Almighty
[1:03:31] God you are free from the law of sin and
[1:03:34] death you no longer walk by that way but
[1:03:37] you walk by the spirit because one
[1:03:41] greater one greater has set you free
[1:03:45] aren't you glad there was a strong man
[1:03:48] of the house but there was a stronger
[1:03:50] one that come in whooped him come on
[1:03:52] somebody
[1:03:53] there was a strong man in your house you
[1:03:56] couldn't get rid of that strong man but
[1:03:58] a stronger one came one day a stronger
[1:04:01] one came and overthrew that strong man
[1:04:03] and now the stronger ones on the throne
[1:04:07] who glory be to God think about this -
[1:04:11] I'm except a man be born again he cannot
[1:04:16] see the kingdom of God you know you and
[1:04:22] I both know that this term of being born
[1:04:25] again it's been I'll just say it it's
[1:04:30] been belittled it's been mocked it's
[1:04:35] been the value and the virtue within the
[1:04:41] word has been read to has been reduced
[1:04:44] not by God but men have reduced it to so
[1:04:47] many things over the time and now let me
[1:04:50] say this it's not the men but it's a
[1:04:53] spirit motivating I hope you're with me
[1:04:57] now it's a spirit that's motive in
[1:04:59] because you see Satan does not walk this
[1:05:01] he wants to keep this from the children
[1:05:04] of God he wants to keep this because he
[1:05:07] knows once that comes to a reality but a
[1:05:11] real true born-again experience is a
[1:05:13] liberation and it's setting me free
[1:05:16] and then there's something that you're
[1:05:18] called to that you realize I really can
[1:05:21] be free there is a real Liberty and then
[1:05:24] you can set your eyes on that you can
[1:05:27] set your sights on that and God Himself
[1:05:30] we'll bring you into the promise by
[1:05:32] building faith within your heart Satan
[1:05:35] doesn't want that
[1:05:38] you know why because he doesn't that
[1:05:41] reality when it moves into your heart
[1:05:43] it's that and it's that greater who went
[1:05:46] on the inside
[1:05:47] he's lost his Dominion come on somebody
[1:05:52] he's lost his Dominion but if he can
[1:05:55] reduce it to just church joining if he
[1:05:58] can reduce him just to believing come on
[1:06:02] somebody you see to believe is a
[1:06:04] wonderful thing and I think you always
[1:06:07] have to start out you have to believe
[1:06:09] right there's got to be something for
[1:06:11] you to believe in and how can you
[1:06:13] believe in and if you never heard but
[1:06:15] it's got to be brought to you so you can
[1:06:17] hear it and then believe in it and then
[1:06:19] that same God you've heard you believe
[1:06:22] in now become one with him but you see
[1:06:26] you can believe in something and never
[1:06:28] or believe on it and never become a part
[1:06:30] of it are you with me
[1:06:33] you can believe on it like like as
[1:06:35] brother Brent says like this simplifies
[1:06:37] with it well I believe it's the truth
[1:06:39] like he talked about Moses he said you
[1:06:42] know when you think about Moses down
[1:06:43] there in Egypt Moses could look upon all
[1:06:46] of that all of the bondage that was
[1:06:48] there within those who were bound of
[1:06:51] Israel and he could look at and say I
[1:06:53] believe like they do I do I believe that
[1:06:56] I believe God's going to send a
[1:06:57] deliverer I sure do I believe they're
[1:06:59] God's chosen people he believed all of
[1:07:03] that but there came a day that Moses
[1:07:07] himself made a decision
[1:07:10] he had to make a decision to become
[1:07:13] identified with them you see remember
[1:07:16] there was a time there was a window that
[1:07:20] Moses and Pharaoh were looking through
[1:07:22] they looked through the same window but
[1:07:26] they didn't see the same thing
[1:07:27] come on somebody Moses looked through
[1:07:30] that window and he saw people of promise
[1:07:33] Pharaoh looked through that window and
[1:07:35] he saw nothing but a people that was
[1:07:37] outcasts he saw people that there seemed
[1:07:40] there was no hope they were nothing but
[1:07:41] slaves but you see what Moses saw it
[1:07:44] brought him to a place to make a
[1:07:46] decision to where he would absolutely
[1:07:48] forsake the very riches and the
[1:07:51] treasures of Egypt he made a decision he
[1:07:56] made a decision not just to remain a
[1:07:58] sympathizer I know I'm preaching to a
[1:08:02] limited here on the Thursday night but I
[1:08:04] know there this goes to the whole church
[1:08:07] it's more than just being a sympathizer
[1:08:10] with truth but it ought to be something
[1:08:12] that within your heart better there to
[1:08:15] be a yearning to say Lord I want to be
[1:08:17] part of that and and if you're a part of
[1:08:19] that say Lord thank you for your grace
[1:08:21] Lord for including me and putting
[1:08:24] something within my heart that it's not
[1:08:27] just about coming to church let me tell
[1:08:31] you something it's easy to serve God
[1:08:33] it's easy to serve God when you're on
[1:08:35] the mountain come on somebody you see
[1:08:40] you can do that a lot of that with human
[1:08:41] strength you feel good but what about
[1:08:45] when you don't feel good what about when
[1:08:48] it's more convenient to stay home what
[1:08:51] about when it's more convenient to take
[1:08:53] the easier way come on somebody this is
[1:08:56] what shows what is really truly real
[1:08:59] Christianity on the inside because the
[1:09:04] road itself is not going to get any
[1:09:06] easier it's gonna keep getting harder
[1:09:08] but you know what your focus has an
[1:09:11] intellect child of God is never to be on
[1:09:13] the journey your focus is to be on Him
[1:09:16] who is waiting who is calling you
[1:09:19] it's drawing you it's to focus on him
[1:09:22] and press toward the mark of the high
[1:09:25] calling be a lot of discouragements
[1:09:30] there'll be a lot of you setbacks but
[1:09:32] you know what I'm focused on that we
[1:09:36] could go around this room tonight and
[1:09:37] everybody could talk about all their
[1:09:38] disappointments and everything else but
[1:09:40] you see when you have seen the kingdom
[1:09:44] of God you recognize this is something
[1:09:46] higher than you it's something higher
[1:09:49] than your church it's something higher
[1:09:52] come on some honey it's something higher
[1:09:54] this is something deeper than just
[1:09:57] recognizing God a sin a profit it is
[1:10:00] actually coming to the realization of he
[1:10:03] who sent the prophet and he who spoke
[1:10:05] for the prophet and has called us to
[1:10:07] himself
[1:10:08] it becomes deeper than just this deeper
[1:10:14] what does that be eye of God you see its
[1:10:20] to be united in the purpose of him he's
[1:10:23] invited us think about this he's invited
[1:10:26] us to share his life you see he was
[1:10:29] ready he could not invite us to share
[1:10:32] his life until he was in position come
[1:10:35] on somebody what good would it Darrin
[1:10:38] knew a boy to go and start talking to a
[1:10:40] girl he's not positioned to bring her
[1:10:41] into his life where he's established his
[1:10:44] position he knows who he is he knows
[1:10:46] where it belongs everything is
[1:10:47] positioned who had got quiet you see
[1:10:53] this is the pattern this is the pattern
[1:10:56] this is not a worldly pattern this is a
[1:10:58] godly pattern Jesus himself established
[1:11:02] and position and then he himself invites
[1:11:06] you in to share his life and in the
[1:11:09] sharing of his life he says I've already
[1:11:12] provided for you I know you're gonna get
[1:11:14] sick but I've already healed you I know
[1:11:16] you're gonna need times in your life
[1:11:18] where maybe the mind battles will get
[1:11:20] gray but my peace shall never leave you
[1:11:22] I know there'll be times where
[1:11:25] situations will arise in your life where
[1:11:27] you feel like you're no-count you don't
[1:11:29] think you can even make
[1:11:31] another step but my grace is sufficient
[1:11:33] my grace will carry you all the way
[1:11:36] through I'll tell you the truth of the
[1:11:40] matter is when we stand there on the
[1:11:41] other side I believe we're gonna
[1:11:43] recognize more than what we're seeing it
[1:11:45] right now that it's God's grace daily
[1:11:49] its daily it's him it's him it's been
[1:11:52] him and it will be him who you this is
[1:11:58] where except a man be born again he
[1:12:01] can't see it means understand the
[1:12:04] kingdom of God you know brother Graham
[1:12:06] said I like this and Satan's Eden he
[1:12:08] talked about how he says you know he
[1:12:10] came into where a man was preaching and
[1:12:12] he said you know this man he said was
[1:12:14] was preaching an intellectual gospel he
[1:12:16] was preaching in or in a place they said
[1:12:18] after he got done he said you know they
[1:12:20] see his crowd his crowd was really
[1:12:22] refined and really learned and and all
[1:12:24] of those things and and don't get me
[1:12:26] wrong there's nothing against of
[1:12:28] education and those other things like
[1:12:30] that but remember what Paul said you see
[1:12:32] in the book of Corinthians he said
[1:12:34] brethren you can see of yourself how
[1:12:36] that there are not many high noble and
[1:12:38] wise among you that are called you know
[1:12:41] how because not very many of them will
[1:12:43] be able to release and submit themselves
[1:12:46] to the working of God's power but let me
[1:12:49] just say it to you and I who are the
[1:12:51] weak who are the poor you and ourselves
[1:12:55] cannot come to the other place to the
[1:12:57] other side of the road what I'm helpless
[1:12:59] I I can't do anything there's no way I
[1:13:01] can do it no that's that's the wrong way
[1:13:03] as well but it comes to the place to
[1:13:06] recognize I can do nothing on myself
[1:13:09] but through him I can do all things
[1:13:14] that's realizing it in the right balance
[1:13:17] the Bible like the Bible says having
[1:13:20] absolutely no confidence in the flesh
[1:13:24] brother brems said it like this he said
[1:13:26] that man you know he said he asked some
[1:13:28] people at the end who would like to
[1:13:29] receive the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[1:13:31] finally he said a woman you know raised
[1:13:33] her hand and she said I want to do it
[1:13:35] and I want to receive him and program
[1:13:37] puts it down like this he says there's a
[1:13:40] scientific knowledge where they tried to
[1:13:42] make and under
[1:13:43] standing golf spa I want you to catch
[1:13:45] what he's saying they're trying to make
[1:13:47] the gospel simple
[1:13:49] let me just preach you for a moment
[1:13:52] you can try to water it down to try to
[1:13:55] get to a place I want them to understand
[1:13:58] it I want them to understand it now let
[1:13:59] me just say like this the Bible tells in
[1:14:01] the Book of Jeremiah God spoke to the
[1:14:03] pastor's within there he said you to
[1:14:05] minister this word and giving
[1:14:07] understanding to the word that has been
[1:14:10] given I don't believe that it just
[1:14:12] remains out here in mystery where we
[1:14:15] preach things of mysteries I believe
[1:14:17] that the same Holy Ghost that reveals
[1:14:19] the mystery can bring it right down into
[1:14:22] our lives he brings it right down into
[1:14:24] our homes to where we're not just
[1:14:26] fellowshiping about mysteries but we see
[1:14:28] it and apply it in our own life you
[1:14:31] understand to where the horse riders are
[1:14:34] not just looking at first seal second
[1:14:36] seal third seal fourth seal and on out
[1:14:38] but where it comes down to operation
[1:14:40] within our lives our discernment by the
[1:14:43] Spirit of God I believe that was on the
[1:14:46] heart so then was looking at this it's
[1:14:49] not making an understanding gospel you
[1:14:51] know I'll say it like this you know
[1:14:53] brother Branham made a prayer in the
[1:14:55] opening of souls in prison now I love
[1:14:57] this prayer brother Graham said I like
[1:14:58] this he said Lord he said I prayed
[1:15:00] tonight he said that you will give
[1:15:02] understanding to each and every one
[1:15:05] that's in here
[1:15:06] understanding to those that might be
[1:15:08] more increased and then to those who may
[1:15:11] not be that far along I just happen to
[1:15:13] believe and I know that God does that
[1:15:17] come on somebody you know what I want
[1:15:21] God to find me I want God to speak to me
[1:15:24] I don't want God to speak up here if I'm
[1:15:26] not up here I want him to speak right
[1:15:28] where I'm at you with me and you know it
[1:15:32] used to be like when you're in school
[1:15:33] you know and people 100 what client want
[1:15:35] math class you in general master what
[1:15:38] general math well class you in calculus
[1:15:42] hold dear Lord what biology you in
[1:15:49] biology which one you in oh I'm in AP Oh
[1:15:54] you know it gets a little status there
[1:15:57] but I'm glad that the real ministering
[1:15:59] of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:00] you don't give no status I'm glad he's
[1:16:03] there to minister to each and every one
[1:16:05] of us let me tell you something
[1:16:07] with each and every one of us as his
[1:16:08] children it wouldn't matter if there's
[1:16:10] two or three he said I'll be right there
[1:16:12] in the midst of you I will regard your
[1:16:15] needs what it is special and I'm
[1:16:17] minister to you as though within that
[1:16:19] service you think it was tailor-made for
[1:16:21] you and the other one over here will say
[1:16:24] that was right for me what is that that
[1:16:27] is a God who invests himself to minister
[1:16:31] to our needs according to our
[1:16:32] understanding I will agree there things
[1:16:36] sometimes that God speaks that it causes
[1:16:38] us to pray that I don't see but I need
[1:16:42] to see it it's something a battle stir
[1:16:44] me up and I'll say Lord Lord God open
[1:16:47] Maha's help me to see it Lord the way
[1:16:49] that I ought to say I agree with the
[1:16:50] Lord a man to it Lord but Lord open my
[1:16:53] eyes to it Lord God and God will do that
[1:16:58] sometimes you loving so to make an
[1:17:06] understanding gospel I don't believe
[1:17:10] that the gospel is something to be made
[1:17:12] complex I don't want you to leave out it
[1:17:18] here tonight and you will Eve out here
[1:17:19] scratching him what was that about I
[1:17:22] don't know but Wow
[1:17:25] what good does it do what good does that
[1:17:28] do I'm not here to waste your time but
[1:17:31] you see I can't mic and bring it down to
[1:17:33] that place but if I can give myself to
[1:17:36] God I don't care regardless of what men
[1:17:38] think whether men think you're here or
[1:17:40] there or whatever more this is about
[1:17:41] ministering to God's people
[1:17:43] it's about ministering to needs to
[1:17:45] encourage you along the way
[1:17:47] don't you love him for that to bring
[1:17:50] understanding to us but this type of
[1:17:53] understanding the prophets talking about
[1:17:54] is a watering down
[1:17:57] we're not trying to make the gospel to
[1:17:59] where it becomes all inclusive we preach
[1:18:02] Jesus Christ and remember as many as
[1:18:05] believed he adds to the church mm-hmm
[1:18:11] this is where but the RAM will say but
[1:18:13] you know he said the man said well you
[1:18:15] believe Jesus Christ
[1:18:17] well you're saved well the same brother
[1:18:19] Ram said but he failed to tell him these
[1:18:21] signs shall follow them to believe that
[1:18:25] is the scriptural identification of a
[1:18:27] believer these signs shall follow them
[1:18:30] that believe signs of all signs of life
[1:18:33] the signs of the Messiah the signs of
[1:18:36] Christ living through your life notice
[1:18:41] the rain picks it up out of John 5 he
[1:18:44] that heareth my word he said not just
[1:18:46] makes out to hear it but with his ears
[1:18:50] understands it anybody can hear it a
[1:18:54] prostitute can hear it and remain a
[1:18:57] prostitute a drunkard can hear it a lar
[1:19:00] can hear it and remain a lot but he that
[1:19:03] understand of my word and believe on him
[1:19:05] that sent me has everlasting life there
[1:19:07] you are no man can do that except God
[1:19:10] for ordained him aren't you glad that
[1:19:17] the word passed across your way and it
[1:19:19] didn't allow you to remain new gate
[1:19:23] allows you to remain in the Commission's
[1:19:25] you were in you know why this word you
[1:19:28] were magnetized to it and the word came
[1:19:30] by your way this is the water of the
[1:19:33] word and the spirit came with the word
[1:19:36] pack in the word right across your way
[1:19:39] and what did it do it removed the
[1:19:41] amnesia from your life to where you can
[1:19:44] really look and recognize that he is the
[1:19:47] Living God and I on this song I am his
[1:19:50] daughter and when you understand that
[1:19:53] you act like a son and daughter of God
[1:19:55] that's real understanding my brother
[1:20:00] Graham talked about the young fella out
[1:20:02] on the plantation notices in John 14
[1:20:07] oh my John 14 here remember as Jesus
[1:20:16] himself I referred to this an opening
[1:20:19] part of the service
[1:20:21] but Jesus says it like this in verse 15
[1:20:24] if you love me keep my Commandments and
[1:20:30] I will pray the father and he shall give
[1:20:33] you another comforter that he may abide
[1:20:35] with you forever
[1:20:38] if you love me keep my Commandments so
[1:20:43] the words that he's expression I trust
[1:20:46] that everybody's listening to me tonight
[1:20:47] if you with in your life you are looking
[1:20:50] and you are waiting on the promised to
[1:20:53] come into fulfillment in your life this
[1:20:55] is a prescription right here if you love
[1:20:58] me if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:21:03] what he's dealt with what he spoke to
[1:21:06] you on what he's ministering to you
[1:21:08] because remember he's not someone
[1:21:09] separate from the word he is the word is
[1:21:13] that right so if falling in love with
[1:21:15] him what is it doing he's drawing you to
[1:21:18] himself in obedience and the Bible tells
[1:21:21] us that he gives the Holy Ghost to them
[1:21:23] that obey Him sarahott and here that has
[1:21:27] walking look at this beautiful reality
[1:21:29] here as we are walking in step with the
[1:21:32] word various prayer that is already
[1:21:35] going up for us then that wonderful as
[1:21:39] our lives are submitting to the word the
[1:21:41] Holy Spirit in agreeance with that word
[1:21:44] the Holy Spirit is making intercession
[1:21:45] for us oh my thank God
[1:21:49] verse 17 even the Spirit of Truth whom
[1:21:53] the world cannot receive the
[1:21:57] intellectual mind scientific cannot
[1:22:00] receive it because it seeth him not
[1:22:05] neither knoweth him
[1:22:09] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[1:22:12] you and shall be in you so the same God
[1:22:16] that stirs up that heart stirs up that
[1:22:18] life and speaks truth to a lot it draws
[1:22:21] it to that place in submission side mine
[1:22:31] let me just go on I'm just gonna skip
[1:22:34] some of those verses brother brown made
[1:22:38] his statement just like this if I might
[1:22:41] go out or something if it did turn this
[1:22:44] on I don't know if it did or not but I
[1:22:45] just thought I would the Lord Jesus what
[1:22:48] we just read here he made he made it
[1:22:51] known that this guiding I it was not
[1:22:54] going to be gone from the church but he
[1:22:57] made known right here in this scripture
[1:22:59] we read that the church itself would
[1:23:01] have the privilege of looking through
[1:23:03] that same guiding eye that Oh God his
[1:23:06] people to all truth you could look right
[1:23:08] through the book of Acts
[1:23:10] you could look all the way through and
[1:23:12] see that it was the guiding eye you can
[1:23:15] look through each and every one of the
[1:23:16] letters that Paul had wrote to the
[1:23:18] saints of God they were all gathered now
[1:23:20] it was the same guiding eye that was
[1:23:23] guiding his children now look at this
[1:23:26] brother Graham said it like this I like
[1:23:28] this statement it just sort of just
[1:23:30] really just turned me around as I'm just
[1:23:32] meditating on it brother Graham said oh
[1:23:34] like this he said jesus said lo I'm with
[1:23:37] you always even to the end and he said
[1:23:40] we're nearing the end how many believe
[1:23:43] that the sister sung about it - not
[1:23:45] looking any moment for him
[1:23:47] we're nearing the end we realize we've
[1:23:51] arrived we've arrived there's where
[1:23:55] we're at the end time what God has
[1:23:59] promised to do in this hour he has done
[1:24:02] and he is doing is that right so here
[1:24:06] within it Jesus he said as Jesus
[1:24:10] confirmed that guiding I being with him
[1:24:13] in the days when he revealed himself to
[1:24:16] the Jews before the ending of that
[1:24:19] church age for the Jews or
[1:24:21] their dispensation you say he was the
[1:24:24] headstone is that right he was coming at
[1:24:27] the end of those of those Church ages to
[1:24:29] the Jews at the end of that dispensation
[1:24:32] is that right
[1:24:33] the Bible prophesied of that in the Book
[1:24:35] of Psalms and here that that he that
[1:24:38] would the same that was the corner he's
[1:24:40] also made the head the Bible declared in
[1:24:43] that same verse of scripture that this
[1:24:45] is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous
[1:24:48] in our eyes it's God's doing it's him
[1:24:51] that started to work it's him that's
[1:24:53] moved it all the way through and it's
[1:24:55] him coming to Capet it is the Lord's
[1:24:57] doing but we can have a spell just on
[1:25:01] that tonight
[1:25:02] hey man it's God who leads you and I
[1:25:05] it's God who gives you and I the faith
[1:25:08] to actually believe it's God who moves
[1:25:11] on our behalf and then he turns around
[1:25:14] and we watch him perform his word and
[1:25:16] bring it to pass in our life there's no
[1:25:19] glory we can take in it the only thing
[1:25:21] we can say it is the Lord's doing this
[1:25:24] is God's doing it's God that inspired me
[1:25:26] huh how did you know to make that step
[1:25:28] God inspired me to do it how did he
[1:25:31] inspire me to do it I don't know it was
[1:25:32] a fearless day it was contrary to my
[1:25:34] thinking are you with me faith is not
[1:25:37] important with your thinking faith
[1:25:40] overrides and is above you see that's is
[1:25:43] where faith itself is sovereignly given
[1:25:46] by Almighty God Alleluia I believe it's
[1:25:50] just like this tonight but there are
[1:25:52] things that I can stand here and testify
[1:25:54] and you could too but you would have
[1:25:56] never thought you'd have had the faith
[1:25:57] to be able to do but God has sovereignly
[1:26:00] placed that faith in your heart and you
[1:26:03] know what that is that's part of that
[1:26:04] experience in your life to let you know
[1:26:06] that no matter what comes your way no
[1:26:09] weapon formed against thee shall be able
[1:26:12] to prosper that he himself sovereignly
[1:26:15] gives that faith and the same faith
[1:26:17] that's needed that you overcome with
[1:26:20] daily is the same God that will show up
[1:26:23] and give supreme faith for the changing
[1:26:25] of your body he's the same God
[1:26:28] it's sovereignty no wonder no wonder
[1:26:33] what's that song say that's why we
[1:26:35] praise
[1:26:36] that's why we seen that's why we give
[1:26:39] him everything if you don't know what
[1:26:44] you just heard it
[1:26:48] Goro Tomita God felt like David tonight
[1:26:52] but look at this brother brems said like
[1:26:54] this at the end of that church age for
[1:26:56] the Jews he said I want you to notice he
[1:26:59] manifested it look at this now he
[1:27:01] manifested it by looking through the eye
[1:27:03] of God the Lord Jesus manifested the
[1:27:07] promises that was determined and that
[1:27:10] was set for that hour he manifested it
[1:27:14] by looking through the eye of God think
[1:27:17] about Moses now look at this just in the
[1:27:19] natural the Lord that Moses himself
[1:27:21] could look at the promises he heard him
[1:27:23] right he heard his momma talk about him
[1:27:26] he could even read over it but you see
[1:27:30] he only knew it by looking through
[1:27:31] natural eyes and hearing it through
[1:27:32] natural years but what he was seeing and
[1:27:35] what he was hearing was seeds that was
[1:27:37] been sown you see first of all God has
[1:27:41] to sow those seeds within you of truth
[1:27:44] you know that's why brother Ram is
[1:27:45] saying looking to the unseen he said
[1:27:47] where people would come and they would
[1:27:48] speak to him regarding you know the Lord
[1:27:51] he said I'll tell you what he said I
[1:27:52] read his word when I was young he said I
[1:27:55] when I read he said I read his word he
[1:27:58] said I believed that he was a living God
[1:28:00] he said in believing he said one day I
[1:28:02] met him personally what do I tell you
[1:28:06] this becomes it becomes very simple if
[1:28:08] you're seeking for the baptism of the
[1:28:10] Holy Ghost if you're seeking for God to
[1:28:13] move in your life for goodness sakes
[1:28:15] give yourself to the word and watch the
[1:28:18] Spirit of God will move down right
[1:28:20] behind it but if you desire it if you
[1:28:23] want it if there's a craving within you
[1:28:25] you'll find yourself falling in love
[1:28:27] with him and that are saying God that's
[1:28:30] drawing you will step on the scene and
[1:28:32] he'll unite with you as you're falling
[1:28:34] in love with him over and over and over
[1:28:39] Hey
[1:28:40] man he manifested that promise by
[1:28:44] looking through the eye of God I just
[1:28:47] read that out of John 5:19 the son can
[1:28:50] do nothing but what he seeth the father
[1:28:52] doing he see if it's open before him
[1:28:55] he's he's seeing it it's it's open it's
[1:28:58] an open vision before him it's something
[1:29:01] that is open to him to recognize what
[1:29:03] the will of God is I believe this with
[1:29:08] all my heart let me just pull up on this
[1:29:10] I believe this you might call me crazy
[1:29:15] but I believe you're a believer you'll
[1:29:16] see right with it
[1:29:17] I don't believe God's will is meant to
[1:29:18] be mysterious you might have to fast and
[1:29:25] you might have to pray but when you
[1:29:27] brought in one you want to know what
[1:29:29] God's will is God don't play around and
[1:29:32] he don't hold things from you the thing
[1:29:35] that what really has to be when we're
[1:29:36] praying for God's will sometimes we're
[1:29:39] so busy trying to look out here instead
[1:29:41] of really trying to see it from the eyes
[1:29:42] of our heart we're trying to look at it
[1:29:45] from the eyes oh you say well those same
[1:29:47] they're walking by sight no walking by
[1:29:49] sight it's much deeper than just you're
[1:29:50] not natural eyes it's by your feelings
[1:29:53] and by your thoughts and all those other
[1:29:55] things but remember when you're seeking
[1:29:57] for God's will according to your word
[1:29:59] remember how we are to pray that God
[1:30:01] father thou art in heaven hallowed be
[1:30:03] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:30:06] done in earth as it is in heaven that
[1:30:10] right it is submission to his will now
[1:30:16] you know and I know as believers when
[1:30:19] we've submitted to his will has his will
[1:30:21] always been comfortable and according to
[1:30:23] our liking I'm afraid to say Amen
[1:30:27] really well really is it it's always
[1:30:29] it's always according to our liking it's
[1:30:31] not what we have to go through it's the
[1:30:33] joy that we get from his will because
[1:30:37] there are things that he can lay out
[1:30:38] before us remember the cross was not
[1:30:40] joyous the Lord Jesus prayed if it's
[1:30:45] possible let this cup pass from me
[1:30:47] nevertheless
[1:30:50] not my will that will be done aren't you
[1:30:56] glad that he didn't get his will aren't
[1:30:58] you glad he surrendered his will and his
[1:31:01] will
[1:31:02] what did it do it brought redemption for
[1:31:04] you am I
[1:31:05] the surrendering of his will brought
[1:31:08] Redemption then what will be the
[1:31:10] surrendering of our will as we continue
[1:31:12] to walk with him
[1:31:13] it'll be the redemption of the body amen
[1:31:18] oh ma we are able to look through that
[1:31:21] same eye and see what it is that his
[1:31:25] desire is because his eye will reflect
[1:31:27] his will will reflect his spirit will
[1:31:30] really reflect his word but we don't
[1:31:33] have to be anxious
[1:31:36] what what do I do the Bible said be
[1:31:39] careful for nothing don't be anxious
[1:31:42] knowing that when we are heart and we've
[1:31:45] submitted to God than what God's will is
[1:31:47] for our life God will make that known
[1:31:50] I'll just say like this you're able to
[1:31:52] stand on this word it's not God's design
[1:31:55] listen if God has so clearly vindicated
[1:31:58] his word in this hour of what is the
[1:32:00] truth and God hasn't run revealed it but
[1:32:03] he's vindicated to be the truth to where
[1:32:05] that you don't have to walk around
[1:32:06] wondering are you with me you don't have
[1:32:10] to walk around wondering is this the
[1:32:11] truth you don't have to walk around
[1:32:13] wondering do I have the Holy Ghost or
[1:32:14] don't I have the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:32:16] have to walk around with that there is a
[1:32:19] vindication by the word are you with me
[1:32:23] to where you can stand in the 40 then
[1:32:25] friends if that's how it is with God's
[1:32:27] Word then how much more in our own walk
[1:32:30] with God in our own lives whether it be
[1:32:33] jobs the church we go to or wherever
[1:32:35] that how much more if the same God is so
[1:32:38] clear about his word isn't this God
[1:32:41] clear about the same little little
[1:32:43] details of our life and the church said
[1:32:48] but somehow there's a disconnect but
[1:32:51] I'll say like this it ain't on God and
[1:32:53] I'll say what rights that we have to be
[1:32:55] able to look and say God just as clear
[1:32:57] as you are in this hour as clear as
[1:32:59] everything is your will is defined right
[1:33:01] here and laid out then Lord God this is
[1:33:03] a promise for me in this hour you love
[1:33:07] them oh I'm so thankful for that let me
[1:33:10] leave you here with just one verse of
[1:33:11] scripture here and we'll just we'll
[1:33:14] close out with this here in the book of
[1:33:17] Zechariah I want you just to look at
[1:33:20] think of this verse of scripture here
[1:33:23] in the book of Zechariah it speaks of
[1:33:26] how here Zechariah is brother L referred
[1:33:31] to he read out of chapter four last week
[1:33:33] but I want to just draw your attention
[1:33:35] to verse one and the angel that talked
[1:33:38] with me came again he came again aren't
[1:33:45] you glad he comes again he don't just
[1:33:50] come on top but he keeps coming he keeps
[1:33:53] coming aren't you glad that the Holy
[1:33:54] Spirit keeps speaking aren't you glad he
[1:33:58] keeps ministering to your life being
[1:34:00] looked the angel that talked with me
[1:34:02] came again what part was that maybe I
[1:34:08] was part fifty and look what the Bible
[1:34:13] says right here and waked me as a man
[1:34:18] that is wakened out of his sleep he
[1:34:22] wasn't asleep but he needed to be woke
[1:34:25] up his eyes was wide open but he wasn't
[1:34:29] awake
[1:34:30] he was awake to everything that was
[1:34:32] around here that was going on with the
[1:34:36] rebuilding or the lack thereof but he
[1:34:40] needed to be woke up so the angel that
[1:34:44] talked with him before that same angel
[1:34:47] came to him again let me tell you
[1:34:48] something God knows your address he
[1:34:52] ain't never lost it
[1:34:53] he knows exactly where it's at your the
[1:34:56] coordinates of your house where you live
[1:34:58] it's bookmarked in his GPS whoa Cole
[1:35:03] Ravena God it's laid right out in the
[1:35:05] promise of this hour he's got a bookmark
[1:35:08] to deliver right down to your life and
[1:35:12] he woke me as a man that is awakened out
[1:35:16] of sleep God begins to speak to him he
[1:35:24] lets him see
[1:35:26] this here of the candlesticks the branch
[1:35:31] he lets him snow with what he notice
[1:35:35] what he shows him the Bible goes on to
[1:35:37] say that with just in this portion again
[1:35:40] they angel asked him what are you seeing
[1:35:43] so he's awakened he's awakened and he
[1:35:47] sees this candlestick and asks him what
[1:35:53] are you seeing in verse 4 so I answered
[1:36:02] the angel that speak to me and talked
[1:36:04] with me and I said what are these my
[1:36:07] lord what are these you see this was not
[1:36:12] look look what look what humility
[1:36:13] Zechariah was not standing there with I
[1:36:16] got to know everything I got to know
[1:36:18] this if I am called a God and really
[1:36:21] spiritual and really elect electing
[1:36:23] about knowing at all elect is about
[1:36:25] recognizing his presence who is the
[1:36:29] supreme omniscient omnipresent
[1:36:32] omnipotent one are here with me so
[1:36:37] here's a Cariah he looks upon it all he
[1:36:39] sees assembles and then he asks the
[1:36:42] question what are these oma I believe
[1:36:46] this is this is the prayer of our life
[1:36:48] Lord what you're showing me what is this
[1:36:51] sword show me how to apply it in my life
[1:36:56] show me don't just walk out of the
[1:36:58] service and say wow that was a wonderful
[1:37:00] serve no no no the Lord show me heart
[1:37:04] personally you see taking what he is
[1:37:06] speaking and you entering in and praying
[1:37:10] and the Bible says he that entereth into
[1:37:13] his / closet that he that heareth and
[1:37:17] secret cieth in secret also and he will
[1:37:20] reward thee openly glory be to God
[1:37:25] what are these my lord and then God lets
[1:37:29] it be known to Zechariah not by might
[1:37:32] not by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:37:39] Lord of Hosts not just saith the Lord
[1:37:46] but the Lord of Hosts he he who is the
[1:37:51] captain of the army that is present the
[1:37:56] host of the Lord the host that which is
[1:37:59] ready to go to warfare aren't you glad
[1:38:02] that he is standing here on your behalf
[1:38:05] you might feel like you're all alone but
[1:38:07] all if your eyes could only be open to
[1:38:10] see to recognize that the Lord Himself
[1:38:13] is here and the angels of God are
[1:38:17] present the Bible says that the angels
[1:38:20] of God are encamped about those who love
[1:38:24] him and fear his name not by might nor
[1:38:28] by power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:38:36] let's just stop here one who is awakened
[1:38:45] by the Lord I believe with all my heart
[1:38:50] we look at this and we see lord help me
[1:38:54] to be living faithfully in the hour of
[1:38:59] my visitation it's easy it's easy it's
[1:39:05] easy to get caught up and a lot of
[1:39:08] things of this life but remember don't
[1:39:12] let the things of this life be the
[1:39:13] ambition let him let him let him be the
[1:39:19] one and in order in this age to be able
[1:39:22] to fulfill these promises it takes the
[1:39:27] eye of God and looking through the eye
[1:39:30] of God and what understanding is opened
[1:39:33] to our lives in our hearts as we are
[1:39:36] able to look through the eye of God it's
[1:39:40] not something deep and mysterious it's
[1:39:43] something very very simple
[1:39:46] well the Lord Himself can move just as
[1:39:49] he did for Zechariah and though you
[1:39:52] might be looking at something and how
[1:39:55] many sitting around this room tonight
[1:39:56] how many things have we looked at right
[1:40:00] here within the scriptures how many
[1:40:02] things have we listened to and we have
[1:40:05] heard right in the message and then all
[1:40:08] of a sudden it's like something just
[1:40:11] opens to you you're reading it well it
[1:40:14] wasn't that you were reading in and out
[1:40:16] before but all of a sudden the Holy
[1:40:19] Spirit just wakes you up and you're
[1:40:22] looking at the same words but you don't
[1:40:24] see it the same way now he's wakened you
[1:40:27] up like a man who was sleeping and you
[1:40:31] no longer see it as just printed letter
[1:40:34] you see yourself you see him you see his
[1:40:39] will made known for your life because we
[1:40:42] know that his word is his will but when
[1:40:45] he comes on the scene then the Holy
[1:40:46] Spirit takes ahold of that word and it
[1:40:49] takes the seals off of that word and he
[1:40:52] begins to show himself there in the word
[1:40:56] and he shows you and here you are and
[1:41:00] here we are oh my goodness I I never
[1:41:04] seen that before my lord just does
[1:41:07] something to you now your might and read
[1:41:09] it and you may not have been looking at
[1:41:10] it you might be pushing your shopping
[1:41:12] cart right down the middle store and
[1:41:13] you're a meditation on what you've been
[1:41:15] reading all of a sudden the eye of God
[1:41:17] breaks for you oh my goodness I see it
[1:41:23] lo I am with you always even to the end
[1:41:28] of the world don't you love him Oh Lord
[1:41:32] Jesus let us live let us be alive unto
[1:41:37] Him the promise of this hour let's bow
[1:41:40] our heads in prayer Lord Jesus what how
[1:41:46] we thank you tonight thank you for your
[1:41:49] mercy

[1:41:55] and more that we walk every moment every
[1:41:58] day that we live we're more and more
[1:42:01] aware of the need of your grace your
[1:42:05] mercy your leadership in our lives Lord
[1:42:09] Father how we we want to step aside and
[1:42:15] we want to give that inner man the right
[1:42:17] away I pray that Lord that you wouldn't
[1:42:21] help us so many times Lord we are were
[1:42:26] encompassed about with different
[1:42:28] pressures with different needs and
[1:42:31] things that we must attend to in this
[1:42:34] life but father may we Lord God awake
[1:42:41] may we not walk Lord as a slumber or as
[1:42:45] those like Paul said that sleep in the
[1:42:48] night

[1:42:52] of the promise oh god I pray tonight

[1:43:21] things and the cares of life Lord have
[1:43:25] started to take a priority and may we
[1:43:28] Lord God walk with the right priorities
[1:43:31] Lord where it's you above everything
[1:43:34] else or god help us so lord jesus we
[1:43:39] confess that lord god of our own selves
[1:43:42] lord there are times that there are
[1:43:44] things that seem Lord so overwhelming
[1:43:46] but we refuse the Lord to walk by our
[1:43:49] feelings our sight we realize the Lord
[1:43:53] God that our feelings and our sight all
[1:43:55] of those things can lie to us but faith

[1:44:24] and we thank you Lord for your
[1:44:26] visitation again and again Lord to speak
[1:44:30] to a slide for if it was not you coming
[1:44:33] by our way Lord and waking us up Lloyd
[1:44:36] and making us aware of the hour of the
[1:44:39] time but bringing the word Lord down
[1:44:43] personal in our lives
[1:44:45] we'd miss it they'd go out of our head
[1:44:48] how many times Lord your prophet would
[1:44:51] say Lord help help him Lord they're
[1:44:54] gonna miss it Lord they're gonna miss it
[1:44:56] then he would call that name out or they
[1:45:00] didn't realize what was being spoken was
[1:45:02] for them Lord I'm thankful tonight that
[1:45:07] here we Lord said or stand here we are
[1:45:09] we realize Lord but what's being spoken
[1:45:12] this is for us but help us lord help us
[1:45:18] that our minds we would be woke to that
[1:45:20] place to realize this is me this is me
[1:45:26] this is for me he's speaking to me
[1:45:31] grant it Lord Jesus Lord God for every
[1:45:35] need for every life tonight Lord we
[1:45:39] commit it Lord into your hands asking
[1:45:42] all these things Lord for your glory in
[1:45:44] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:45:51] you know I shared that with you last
[1:45:53] time we spoke on this when my eyes begin
[1:45:59] to get bad and in school I didn't
[1:46:01] realize it I didn't realize that was
[1:46:04] what was happening when I started asking
[1:46:05] for people's notebooks and copying down
[1:46:07] their notes I didn't realize that's why
[1:46:09] I was squinting my eyes but all of a
[1:46:12] sudden one day I begin to recognize when
[1:46:17] some of the rest of my friends begin
[1:46:18] they get glasses and they begin to get
[1:46:21] things and I thought well that's that
[1:46:23] kind of strange my parents wore glasses
[1:46:25] but then I can remember when I begin to
[1:46:30] mention something just casually in
[1:46:31] conversation to my parents I said you
[1:46:33] know sometimes it's so hard to see the
[1:46:36] blackboard when I'm writing notes and
[1:46:39] that right there they took alert to that
[1:46:41] and they said I think we need to take
[1:46:43] you to the eye doctor and you know what
[1:46:46] I told you when they took me to the eye
[1:46:48] doctor for the joy they put them
[1:46:50] contacts in my eyes and I walked out of
[1:46:53] that optometrist office or the Doug
[1:46:57] there's things I could see that I
[1:46:58] couldn't see before
[1:46:59] assault trees or things that I thought
[1:47:01] was green lumps all along the way and I
[1:47:04] could see it as they got real close I
[1:47:05] could see the golden arches and knew
[1:47:07] they were even though they were fuzzy
[1:47:08] they were far away but I didn't know the
[1:47:10] exit for him but once those those were
[1:47:13] put on my eyes everything was channeled
[1:47:16] in through that lens the light that was
[1:47:20] reflecting off of all of those objects I
[1:47:23] could see it in great distinction it's
[1:47:27] all because of a lens that was put over
[1:47:30] my eyes to where I could see things that
[1:47:33] way and you know that's the same thing
[1:47:35] that God has given us as believers that
[1:47:38] I have God to be able to see him to see
[1:47:43] things for as it is and to be able to
[1:47:45] see ourselves don't you love him Oh
