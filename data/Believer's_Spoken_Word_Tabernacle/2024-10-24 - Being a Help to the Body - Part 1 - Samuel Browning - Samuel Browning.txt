need Lord those that's in the visible and invisible audience Lord may you just take us Lord under your control I pray we love you and we thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen did we get it worked out let's go to Job chapter 26 sometimes these wires that attach This Together goes out and don't let you know till you get up here I'm not one of those guys that like to I don't like to hold a microphone if I don't if I don't have to I'd rather not I always teasing them I say I get a different anointing on me when I hold it but uh I I just if we can if it'll work all right here then we'll do it this way but I want to read just a few verses of scripture here tonight as we would um look at this here in the scripture in job 26 6 verse 1 and remember um this is where that job we had went to job 27 last week and then then picked up back in job 25 where job 25 is actually the last time that one of the comforters or with accusations would speak and then this is one of the uh times where job begins to speak and job speaks from here all the way to where elu would begin to speak so I want to pick this up this is something the Lord just began to press on my heart here on on Saturday and um let's just read job answering that and said answered and said how hast thou helped him that is without power that's a question now remember bildad is they they've continued to bring accusations and bildad has remember in in in job 25 where we read he said how can a man be just before God and so we went through that last week and now here's job responding to him and saying how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength how hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is to whom hast thou uttered words and whose Spirit came from thee I'd like to speak if the Lord would help us tonight I'd like to speak on being a help to the body being a help to the body amen God bless you as you're being seated and if I could I want you to just just bear with me here tonight I just I feel like I have uh so much ahead of me and um and what I mean is is that not that I intend to keep you here long uh and you say you always say that but um you want to be want to I want to look at things within the season and time and what God has for this particular service and so I ask you just to just to pray and be in prayer with me on this here because there's so many things that where we uh in looking at this uh go ahead and switch it over Brianna if you don't mind on being a help to the body and I'd like you to think of this this question how are you helping the body that's a like a question just to just to ponder every one of these statements that we read now don't draw your toes up in your shoes and get on the defense that's that's not the whole purpose of this tonight but this is the thing that for us that you know we want the word to come and to examine our lives and and the reality of it is God as we see in the scriptures he's the vine we're the branches and he has no other hands but our hands he has no other feet but our feet and so when we consider that we know that uh brother brandham if I can just uh make mention of this here there's been a a quote that is so laid on my heart over the the past uh number actually the past time that we've been dealing with this in job and it so stood out to me what brother Bram said often times when he preaches Divine love there that particular message in Jeffersonville and he says so often he said we we pray for the sinner he said but that's not what God has ultimately called us to do he said God has called us to contact the sinner he said so many times we pray for him and yet so there's a there's an aspect to that right there of needs that we're praying for now sometimes that contact if we can look at it it isn't always that you know at that point of the contact to be able to set down and going through scriptures with them and telling them how wrong they are but you first got to be able to administer that of a care one for another and they be able to show someone that you care and those are things that when we look at it I know I'm speaking there of one who maybe is not walking in serving the lord right now but I believe that goes along with every part that we we would have here among us is that where the spirit of God would lead us in that place that there a care that would be shown and would be displayed in our lives and this is the questions that that job is asking these these Brethren and I want you to remember what what the scripture calls them job even refers to them as comforters that's how they came they came to be a comfort they they did not come with the intent to tear job down if you can really we can really understand it we we speak of it in terms of what they were accusing him but I want you to remember that Satan himself had come before God and he had told him and said you let me let me get at him let me take the things that are around him and and all of those things he he touched not only job's children he touched job's livestock all everything that job had and he also touched those of his friends he even touched that of his wife where would discern and say when she said enough is enough just Curse God and die and job was able to discern by the spirit of Christ within him and said thou speakest like a foolish woman I want to I want to just say it this way is that discernment is not an option in our walk with God there is something that we should desire each and every time in our life God help me to have the discernment that's needed for this particular situation let me let me say it like this remember when when sister Rebecca when she ran out of the house and remember brother bham heard her playing those rock and roll Tunes at the neighbor down the street you've heard brother George uh give a little elaborate on that what we read in question answer 64 how brother Bram had just walked up to the door and he heard that you know that sister Rebecca was sitting there and here the other little one uh little girl was sitting there and they were playing those rock and roll Tunes brother Bram never calls a scene at the door then brother just said it's time to go and they got in the car and they went on and ate dinner and everything else now I I would say it like this there's no telling that brother Bram himself within his own Spirit was tore up that's his little daughter she's 18 years old this is what I this is what I want to point to friends is that sometimes if we we we need to say God give me the right perception on how that even when I'm looking at the things that I'm seeing in the message message because what we recognize that God has not called you or me to stand in that office of a prophet but God has given to us he would show us glimpses that as a prophet if you remember a prophet would be one that would display even conditions as they would show in Israel they would show certain conditions that would be at God would have them to act certain things out but this this portion of it that God would this this little insight we would have with brother Bram in here is God would allow you and I to know the quality of the holy spirit that we have within us if if we can just yield to him the same God that gave the prophet Grace there is the same God for our situations we don't have to be a prophet to act a certain way we we don't have that there a Prophet is one who is a Divine interpreter of the word of God like Daniel was like Joseph was On and On Through the scriptures so when we look at this brother Bram himself remember at that point in time he he was getting ready he said in his mind what he felt like doing when Rebecca walked out of the house and when his when her mother you know coming later on had asked her not to be playing those songs in the house she walked out the out the door slammed the door and said what do you want me to be some old Wallflower now brother Bram could have that was a trap this isn't Sunday service but that was a trap that's his Spirit Well no doubt it was what was Satan trying to do provoke him it was trying to get him to act out in order to bring a further dissension than where she's already dealing sister Rebecca is already dealing with issues of an 18-year-old and if God can get the prophet drawn out into the flesh where he acts out in the flesh in regards to it it's only going to further build a wedge between them are you with me now oh now now notice why brother bam approaches this here in the right the word for the right season he comes along and he says what I felt like doing was going out after her and taking my belt after her he said but I can't do that right now she's 18 years old now if your son or daughter is still five the belt still applies but everything has to be done in the right Spirit right is that right yes you see even when brother Brandon mentioned that right there that was out of frustration that was out of of that but notice now here the spirit of God as a prophet would allow the Holy Spirit to have the rideway he said to he said to Sister mey he said mey she's 18 years old and he said these kids need a buddy beautiful he said we have to think 18y old thoughts now how however how old brother brandham was at the time you know that was going to be something that he was going to have to be able to enter into but how could he enter into that to think 18yearold thoughts now I want you to think of this now here is the prophet of God that is bringing to you and I the revelation of the word g is a channel but all even because he was the prophet of God God allowed him to be ex be able to experience the things of where the children would pass through that of the adolescence all of their times that they would come through and God permitted all of that it wasn't an act God allowed all of that so when you and I might have a window and an Insight that it's not just even don't limit this to where it's just that of teenage children it's showing us sometimes the response that we need we need the discernment of the Holy Spirit to not respond based on what we feel but respond based on what is needed in the season because what is in the season will actually be helpful at that time and this is why in everything that we do we have to be sensitive we we want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit to know God what is it that I need we would you would have me to say if there's something to say during this time because when it's all said and done I want to be a help to the body I want to be a help to somebody else and not just to the body I want to be a help to some that they may never even darken the doors of this church they may not even walk in the doors of any church I want to be a help to humanity yes sir amen is that right yeah I believe we feel that way as Believers and when God would ask a question you know of you and I and like job was asking questions there job was asking questions not that he wanted answers to but questions that bill dad and elas and the other they should have just stopped and said wait a minute here the I need a moment of reflection to actually stop and think how am I helping how am I strengthening others what kind of counsel am I giving so good how am I being a help now you know every one of us is just like when we go into the doctor and we can say well I think everything's going pretty good but blood work don't lie right scans don't lie and I say it like this with the Holy Spirit we want the great scan of the holy spirit because I realize those instruments they can get your results mixed up with somebody else name on it I realize those things can show up things that they they've got the wrong results I understand that but in this moment of standing in the presence of the word I want the word to examine not only my life but I believe that God would speak to us in this way that Lord perhaps there's ways that I could be helping that I'm not helping and I'm not a rare of it Lord so help me to be sensitive to the hour and the season that I'm living in in other words not to apply things just of the past but help me to be in season and out of season amen and I think we've seen that example as I was rehearsing that there of sister Rebecca there in the house of how to think 18-year-old thoughts that would be challenging to be able to go back into that place which we all have as children and you know what it's not just as children but sometimes when a brother or sister or something's a little indifferent it's a place to say to be able to have enough Grace to say Lord I don't know what's going on maybe something in their mind something in their heart I don't understand what it is but you know Lord that's my brother that's my sister don't let me just look at the outside and make a judgment or an interpretation but give me the discernment of the holy spirit that you might be a help through me I'm just speaking from my heart friends Hallelujah when the Lord begin to deal with me on this on Saturday there in the in the evening and these things just begin to roll and come and begin to look at it through the scripture of how hast thou helped him that is without power sometimes as we're looking around we we can look at one another you might even see a smiling face but you don't know what is down there and what that person might be going through and you can just assume everything's all right and they might be so overwhelmed and so overcome I tell you my heart few Saturdays ago we had a text and some of you no doubt probably watched the funeral there were brother uh brother Donnie Reagan and there's actually a brother that went to Brother Mike walls he had had contact there with brother Donnie and them brother Nathaniel And I as soon as my wife and I we got a text and I thought no way no way and when I got that text then sure enough then um here a sister called from in that area and called and begin to speak to my wife and I my wife and I were stepping out to get something just something real quick to eat and so I could get back in the office and I don't I just sat in the parking lot and I just wept I wept I said God help me help me make me sensitive make me more sensitive Lord to the needs that are present it just so so burdened my heart within that situation that where the brother you know he through through the situation had come to such a place and would take his life and but yet a real a real genuine believer I could read you quotes on this where brother B talks about the strength of the seal holding out and I got to looking at that and the burden that was upon my heart I said oh God help me to be sensitive and I I told her I said I don't even know if we're going to be able to go in and get something to eat I this is just it's overwhelming on my heart with this right here God there's there's so many needs and I say it to you because it's not just among older ones I don't know in a countless youth meeting after youth meeting and I've been in and seen young people that are dealing with some of these things that what might seem okay on the outside but down on the inside there's things that are going on but I'm glad that there is a God who cares he cares about your thoughts he cares about what you're going through the prophet said he's interested in what you anticipate in he's interested in all that's wrong he's interested in you hallall yeah the Lord just just as I become burning I I certainly didn't didn't know that we were even coming into this place here in job 26 as a matter of fact I had not even the intention or looking at this chapter many other chapters ahead and looking at it but the Holy Spirit begin to just pick this up and just Inspire it to my heart being a help to the body and how are you helping the body I'm I'm asking that question is not just put to you it's put to me and it's put to me in the sense that I this is how that I have prayed is God help me to be sensitive and Lord give me the discernment that I need at the time to listen and what to say and what words to say Lord Give Me Lord Jesus what the discernment that I need for this moment and this season amen cuz sometimes the discernment we need is we just need to be good listeners there you go there you go and Satan will tempt us to say something and you said Satan will tempt you to yes Satan can tempt you to say something you say how do I know that is Satan because it's always accompanied with anxiousness right the Holy Spirit we we're to speak the truth in love not anxiously that I got to force this in there that I got to get this in there that I got to correct this that's not the Holy Spirit that's Satan wanting to bring confusion and trying to put a wedge there but God is called you to be a channel you and me and he's given us the grace if you'll just wait on him he'll give you what help is needed even if it's to step back and say let's try to think 18-year-old thoughts let's be a buddy come on now sister mey didn't tell Rebecca well you know what you can play any rock and roll song you want because we're just going to be your buddy no that wasn't the right kind of buddy but she said honey she said I want you to know brother BR told her exactly what to say you know that's not welcome here in this house because the Lord has given us this house we are we are his children we are his servants now I want you to know that you might you might want to go that way but I want you to know that Mommy and Daddy are your buddies we're going to be your friends now it didn't mean that they were just taking their hands off and and where however she wanted to go but it meant that it's got to be somebody that's willing and able to stand there in the midst of that time and Minister the help that's needed in that hour oh I tell you as a parent sometimes you look back and you think there were years of three and four and five and six those were the we look at and say those were the cake years right and I don't really want to say that they were the cake years but because I know some of you are in that in those Realms I I don't mean that cuz it's every every year every year you go through it it it takes out of you so I don't don't misunderstand me but even as they as they get older I I've shared this with you that I I don't even in myself I it's not been less time I I I'm I'm I'm looking at it in things to where that if I see something a little going a little r or I feel something in my spirit my wife feels a little something her spirit I want to get right with it I I don't want to I don't want to get with it in the terms of we don't do this and we don't do that hey come on we we need to have some time to talk and I want to hear their heart right amen I want to know know what's on your heart I want to hear that and and God give me the grace and the wisdom to how to help them and guide them because you know what I was that age at one time I remember that it's like some of my boys I can look across the table and say now you're wondering how I how I know that that that's not a spiritual discernment I you and I think alike so I know how you think there you so let me just tell you what you're thinking on here and what you're thinking on there that's good yeah now I'm saying it and I just you know within these parts that you know what sometimes the things that you know the ways that we look at being a help sometimes you know I think maybe sometimes we've been like Bill dad in life has and we're looked at that this is's going to be a help but God knows what is needed to bring the help and what needs to be done at the right time I mean who would have ever thought that the minister presenting his wife with a of chocolates and talking sweet to her would have cast out a devil come on right you sisters are like chocolate you ought have been shouting on that one elbowing and ribbon or something but you see it it was the approach right yeah it was the approach so these Brethren I I don't I'm just going to say it from my heart I don't believe they had the wrong intentions I don't believe Bill Dad and life ass went there and the other went there said we're just going to strip him down I don't believe they had the wrong intentions but they had the wrong discernment and if there's one thing in this hour that we we need you know the Bible tells us within that of discernment it says that that strong meat belongeth to them that are full age to discern good from Evil let me tell you something the sharpening of our discernment in our lives is as we stay in his presence and we feed upon the word of God that's what brings discernment to what is good and what is evil and I'm talking about even in our thoughts and and the way the words that we would say we're living so close to him until we speak like he speaks think like he thinks act like he acts that's the privilege we have as the children of God to live behind the veil yes Lord Glory aren't you thankful for that friends I I'm so grateful for that and I I want to just say it in this way if we look at this being a help to the body look at this scripture here it says in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people notice the objective of our high priest right is reconciliation right it's reconciling it's bringing in Harmony in unity that's what the spirit of God it draws upon Harmony and unity for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to secur them that are tempted this word sucur when job like was asked he asked the question how hast thou helped that word that word help there is the same as this word meaning that how how hast thou supported how hast thou helped come to the aid of one who is without power now watch this here in the Hebrew series brother Ram says suur means to sympathize now there'll be some things let's just be honest some things we can't sympathize we empathize CU if I've not been through it I I can't sympathize but I can empathize y let me give you an example it's like a nurse who walks into your room and you have to have an iv put in and she walks in the room and you know sometimes you know bedside maners is everything oh yeah oh yeah they can walk in the room and treat you like a piece of Machinery maybe they've had a bad night maybe that's just how they are I I don't know I I'm not going to say that but when you understand that when they walk in you appreciate that time of where they'll not only put in the alcohol but they're talking with you and just kind of guing taking those extra moments rather than just saying hey give me the arm you appreciate that little bit of empathy now I know we might turn our heads and say you know they tell us to turn our heads so we don't Flinch you you appreciate all of that extra little what we call bedside care that that little bit of extra bedside care can be the can be the difference between them finding the right vein and not finding it it can be the difference between you walking out of there with only one spot black and blue rather than having a whole arm that's black and blue is that right but it takes a little bit for that nurse to actually understand that that her job or job description does it goes so far beyond what's written by the hospital or the doctor's office it actually has to be a Feeling that she has for that patient or that person suffering it'll change the entire atmosphere or situation that's there is that right amen so notice brother re says sakur means to sympathize that's the reason he become this he become he might be sympathetic with you you as you have your ups and downs and your little ins and outs and your Temptations get so great you can't hardly stand it he knows knows how to sympathize with you he sets there to make intercession he sets there to love you thank you Father you say well how can he understand ups and downs he never was up and down he never was in and out you say how can he experience that he listen the Bible said in that he was tempted he suffered suffered means that he actually went through a sensible experience brother man tells us in deity of Jesus Christ he was tempted with sexual Temptation he was tempted with drinking what are you saying he had to turn his head Brothers just like you do he felt the same pull a spirit that would want to pull him he felt that why he didn't have to do that but he did it so he might be the right kind of mediator in you and me and yet he was without sin because he was the pasc lamb and that imparting of his life into you and I brings us in to the sacrifice and the desire of our heart is to please him so even in our times of up and down now your up and down time may not have been where you were out of church a week right but your up and down time might have been sitting right here and you're down one week and up the next week sometimes we get down sometimes the cares of life I tell you what would be a good thing when you see someone a brother or sister says they're just not like themselves don't pour it on them but lift them up in prayer say Lord help my brother help my sister Lord I I don't know what they're going through I don't even know what kind of mind battles or what news they've received today Lord but God would you help them Lord sometimes you can look at some somebody else and say well it seems like they're up and down and up and down also remember every one of us are made up differently that's right brother Bram tells us of those of the different temperaments and makeups he himself was a Melancholy person which means High passion Melancholy could be up here and soar and everything so great but then let them get down in here that's a temperament and God listen through this listen now if God if God allowed you and me to be in such a place where we just soared the heavenlies all the times I would love that but if he didn't allow me to come down I would never be able to minister to you in the right way amen if I never came through times that I feel so alone times that I feel so discouraged times that I feel like is there anything taking place oh God if God did not allow allow me to come that way how could I minister to you and I'm not just talking about preach but I'm talking about being able to minister to you w I've realized more and more as I go on and I keep learning that God permits circumstances and situations because a minister is not one that can put a bunch of scriptures and quotes together but a minister is one who is indeed that I said God I don't want to preach sermons I want to minister to the body the devil can preach sermons J listen Judas was a man that could preach the prophet said he shared knowledge in the Mysteries Second To None Judas was a masterful preacher if we could say it like this in terminology that we've heard referred to Prince of preachers but it wasn't a minister [Music] I don't know about you but I don't want to be a preacher I want to be a minister amen I want to be a servant I say God help me I want to be a servant there's things that Lord that you see that needs to be diverted or change this way that this is not an outline in anything that God would give me God knows what he's doing it may just be that God has these things out here that it would so resonate in my spirit and he would take it and minister to the very need of his children maybe you all are just sitting here and getting a window as I preach to myself tonight and though you go astray I love this he won't forsake you amen he will still come after you and knock at your heart there's not a backslider in the building but what know that God knocks at his heart daily and he will do it as long as you're a mortal on this Earth for he's loved you he's redeemed you hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory be to God God knows how to minister help to us don't he why I want to we want to be a comforter I want to be a comforter there's times when we need God we need god with skin on it oh absolutely you know he is the comforter but you know he's he he he ministers Comfort through our lives to one another oh yeah let's just take a little bit of a journey here in the scriptures Paul and this is one of my I love this passage of scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse three Paul said blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of All Comfort who comforted Us in all our tribulation not just when I got out of it but in the midst of it he still comes to fiery furnaces he still comes to Lion's dims he ministers comfort in all our tribulations hallelu oh thank you Lord Lord why that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the Comfort wherewith we ourselves are com comforted hallah of God hallu that's so beautiful hallu to me I don't think I think it's so powerful that throughout the body right here that when there's times that sometimes I can know something that maybe one and you you all know this that that's been around here for a while if if I can find that somebody else is going through something and I'm not talking about something that shouldn't be disclosed but maybe it's something with a job maybe it's situations maybe it's something you know it's something that in other words that that would not be it's not withheld from an order somebody to give a testimony to somebody else about oh brother and sister when you have been through certain things like that why would I not recommend somebody else and say listen not only will God he's with you in this he'll bring you through it but here's a brother here's a sister why don't you talk with them because they've been right through it and right there and they themselves will know exactly how to pray with you that's God working through the body hallelujah we're not under nicadan ISM where it all has to be the pastor he is the holy spirit that works through the body Hallelujah so why were you comforted why was I comforted in my tribulation that we might be able to be a comfort to someone else I say God help me to be sensitive whether brother Aaron Brother Ray brother Samuel brother Bill somebody tells me hey brother so and so that help me to be sensitive Lord that if you deal with my heart help me to just be sensitive enough to say brother sister I'm praying for you maybe send them a text or a phone call you might say brother Samuel that's so little and insignificant let me tell you something the Lord Jesus will not even Overlook a cup of water being given to one who is in [Applause] need brother ra said sometimes we think things are so small and so little he said but God does not Overlook the little things you doen sometimes the very things that we think were so little insignificant and it isn't because we want some big name but you know sometimes we think well no maybe that's just me maybe that's just me when we should act on the pulsation of the Holy Spirit and say God as we minister to that brother or that sister maybe just sending a text for him brother you're on my heart today I want you to know I'm praying for you you're in prayer I'm lifting you up before the Throne of God I never forget I think it was at the beginning of 2015 or somewhere like that I don't remember the exact date brother Andrew Glover would probably remember it better than I would in that sense but if somewhere wrong that time and I woke up early that morning I had brother Andrew in my heart so so deeply I I just I said oh God I I don't know what it is and I just begin to pray and I got downstairs real early I begin to pray and I sent him a text and I just sent him a text and he said brother he said just keep praying I'll be with you in a little while little did I know he was there in India at that time and the authorities had been called on that meeting and they were trying to get them out of that meeting at that time and get them on a train and send them to another place oh my let me tell you something the same God knows about your need he knows about my need and what if I would have just taken it in that way I believe I don't believe that I had to send that text but I felt to send that text on I felt descended I didn't know what the severity of the situation was where the authorities were coming in to break up that religious meeting but God knew and God interceded friends don't don't you see the value God don't let me to become so Earthbound to where I'm not sensitive enough to you you see how Satan wants to get us so Earthbound to what we're thinking about is the next Earthly step listen friends we walk in this Humanity the holy spirit's not here condemning us I just say God help us to be aware of it it's Satan's desire he wants to get us into an earth bound thinking in EarthBound way because sometimes TR to be honest with you you know what I'm talking about emotionally and mentally we are exhausted at times from the day from the spiritual warfare that has been taking place and going on it don't even seem like you've got the strength sometimes to drive home the strength to move on and the strength to even do the simplest of thing sending a text making a call doing a phone doing a phone call but let me tell you something one of the greatest ways to receive strength in your life is to be a channel for the strength of God to flow through because you are anointed and ordained as part of the body of Jesus Christ you are not an impostor you are part of the body you are not some prosthetic that's been stuck on but you are a part of the body you've been born of the same holy spirit amen yes sir hallelujah oh God help us for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ and whether we be afflicted it's for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings we also suffer and whether we be comforted it's for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation Paul and these apostles were attacked because of the word they brought Satan tried to block it off he would try to hinder him but you know why Satan knew the power within that word and when that word would find Residence in the hearts of the Believers Satan would want to turn against that believer and turn against maybe that group of Believers but this is the strength whereby those Believers were able to live Victorious is by the comfort of the Holy Spirit as it would be ministered through Paul as a channel that is so good and others yes how many want to be a channel I I I I want to be a comforter a comforter means you remember in the scripture says I will not leave you comfortless I won't leave you alone oh my look at this living and dying buried rising and coming he Saidi so glad to know that he can be found amongst the Brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us he stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of Earthly reaching has come to its end he is still God and he loves us he was the expressing of God brother brah goes on to say oh how I believe that he Longs for his people to be so anointed Ed with his spirit that he that we could go to each other in trials and troubles and give the expression of his sympathy not my sympathy his [Applause] sympathy I hope you don't misunderstand me I get texts from all over the world I'm on different threads with brothers and pastors from all over the world I'm on other threads that are Pastors in certain regions and certain things like that there's all sorts of requests that come through and you know you you you put it down and to pray for that request as well too and and sometimes it might be if God lays up on our heart like I said before like that with happen with brother Andrew that maybe that text would be but let me just tell you something God never called me to Pastor any other body I love brothers and sisters all around but let me tell you something where my focus is at it's right here right right even if I'm not standing right here and God sees fit to take the gift here and Minister there my my heart is right here my prayers are right here I'm praying and looking many times studying for needs right here in the assembly even though I'm out somewhere else but studying for what's present right here hallelujah so what are you saying brother Samuel God might use me or you or somebody else to minister he has done that to others in other assemblies but listen friends when it all comes down to it at the end of the day it's what have we done with those that God has put around us it would be like being a husband that is absolutely uh here is a man that does everything so perfect but not in his own home or a wife vice versa you would say something's wrong with that but you see God has put us together as a body that's not me looking at Lord I I I'll do this for so and so over there but no let me be so Anointed with your spirit Lord that I might be able to minister to to someone else right here that's in need notice do not to be so Anointed with his spirit that I would walk on the water that I would pray for the sick and they would get well but to be so Anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles amen and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our heart that's been born of his Spirit to reflect in the church the love of the Living God oh yeah Hallelujah now if you can receive it in the right way even where the enemy would want to back you up and say well you can't do this because you can't speak good you can't do this because you know you can you you're just not able don't don't don't let the enemy back you up on it no no say uhuh I'm part of this I'm part of his sympathy I'm part of the sympathy I'm part I'm a chain I don't get to choose who it is but Lord let me be part where the where the sympathy in other words can be a help to somebody else let me be a Channel friends listen if we just step back just a little bit and you know what instead of instead of just let me just say it this way so you understand it instead of it just being and looking at I know sometimes we have requests brother Samuel how's this one doing brother Samuel how this doing maybe sometimes if we step back and we ourselves actually called as well and checked on somebody else well that's the pastor's responsibility well that's a it's we're a body right if my heart is hurting every part of my body ministers to my heart right not just one part of it don't underestimate your calling and your purpose of what God has for you to do in the body God has it so fitted that we would have the same care and compassion one for another is so good friends this is the working of the third pole Among Us yes it is the third pole is not a public show this is going to take place on the platform this in a prayer line the third poll is the working that is on in the private being displayed through our lives individually it's not a public show we're not going backwards it's for this word when you listen to the prophet as he brings the message humble thyself he brings it in such a way of how that third pool would actually work Among Us and remember the real Catalyst of the third pool is that of changing the changing in my life Hallelujah on oh I rejoice in the healing of the bodies I rejoice in Deliverance that's all part of it but the real reality is where the third pull bring about a body that actually is a servant to the leadership of the Holy Spirit to where he can say go here and we say Lord I don't understand it but I'm going to follow you say this Lord it seems like I should say this no say this Hallelujah Hall remember the one brother brother McHugh he had a dream that he had he thought it was jokey brother Bram tells us he thought it was jokey brother Bram said the very thing he thought was jokey was the very answer to his wife's healing you see what it took to him it was jokey it only took a prophet to point it out that it wasn't jokey this is your wife's healing the Lord I said God help us sometimes the things that we we Overlook you love him Andy we're in this together now this is this isn't just fingers like this this is is right here I told you right now you're invited in as I preach to myself tonight so if you say amen I just sick him Lord get on him good watch this one right here I love this brother Neville praying this is Brother Neville praying he's asked to pray father the great problems and trials of Tomorrow will seem nothing as long as we're able to hold thy hand and walk through with thee brother BR says truly Lord he said pre pray Lord that thou would give us a deep seated compassion one for the other knowing that whilst we're in the deepness of trial and the hardness of testing we too one of these days shall go through like circumstances God give us the spirit of Jesus in us till we feel for each other enough until there will be Unity between us until we can serve thee together hallu what a prayer what a prayer Hallelujah I want you to think of this here this scripture look how Paul would write of this now the god of patience and consolation this is Comfort but it's also understanding that's that's something that within that we're talking about with discernment Lord give me me the right understanding for this moment how to approach this particular situation Grant you to be notice Grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus so he's the standard and that God would grant you that this notice this is something that even in our Liv sometimes friends from the walks of life we come and it's not sometimes even from the walks of life sometimes it's the way that we're made up that we can get to looking at as though we're the kind of people that could sit in a corner and if nobody said hi it would not bother us whatsoever but remember remember you in yourself are not the body that's right I'm not the body the finger is not the body it's just a part of it so then we have to look beyond what we look at our needs cuz sometimes the what hinders us is we look at what we are and we than everybody else El ought to be the same way but everybody else isn't the same way as a matter of fact we're all going to be in places where we have need one from another and where I I tell you you know like it is brother Ram said he said I never knew what it meant to people he said when I would walk walk into the room he said and you come and visit people he not just himself he said but to have others he said I never really knew the depths of that until my mother was suffering on her deathbed and he said the different visits that was being paid to our home he said oh how much it meant as I seen brother Neville walk through the door how much it meant to see one another walk through the door listen don't ever underestimate and don't ever think that you have got to go there with some great big word listen your presence enough shows you care your text shows enough you care you don't have to write a great big thing but just that little bit and that moment in that time can express your care that is a brother Samuel this one needs to do this and needs to do that and needs to do this get them to the end first don't leave them stranded on Jericho Road that's another service this is what God has called us to do we want to we want to be a help I don't want to be according to what I think is a help but God give me the deser determent of this moment but I read this scripture here and I read it in a manner that you know what it tells me brother Shane is God will actually gift us he'll Grant to us he he'll he'll direct us on how to be likeminded like-minded don't mean we're all going to think exactly alike but we have the same understanding and it comes around that of the word we have that we have that same feeling one for another that you're not something separate you're a part of the body [Music] right amen why that you may be one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ look at job's life it was a living testimony it was a testimony there's many places we can pull but I'm just going to pull from this point tonight this was a testimony this wasn't what job actually had said this this is something that elipas actually said it was a Liv testimony among others Now watch how watch how they view this elifas answers and says in verse two if we assay to commune with thee wil thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking that probably would have been the best thing that a lifeas could have done at that time you see friends sometimes what it is is we feel like we've got to give an answer right we feel like we've got to and put things in such a way and we've got to say this and if we don't and wonder what it is if we don't say it we feel like we're a compromiser right you have to be remember it's your life that is Thunder against the devil it's your testimony that's the calling card that grants entrance that's that's what grants entrance on things is your testimony your life that care is that right now notice the greatest thing sometimes and probably as husbands we we've all learned this as husbands Sometimes the best thing is don't don't don't try to solve it just listen right cuz as a husband we're interested get right in there let's get right in let's just get this solved because we don't think that way as Men Let me refresh our memory for we're because of the age we're living in God made them hast thou not read God made them male and female in the beginning that's right I don't think like a woman thank God she don't think like a man thank God right and so sometimes those ways of thinking about things oh y'all getting quiet on me now woo maybe part two will just dwell right [Applause] here some of y'all come on get him off the ash sheep get him off the ash come on brother s we're going to pull right now but sometimes you know it doesn't make sense it does make sense cuz we feel like we have to have we got to give an answer somehow that's true and sometimes the greatest answer we can give is the care that's exhibited to just listening and not listening by what was that you said may I have your undivided attention see little things little things can so slip in and then it just becomes something that starts to be a dividing Factor resentment begins to build over things oh yes right just little things that'll just start start happening Lord how did we get here verse three behold thou Hast instructed this is his testimony this is what they're testifying thou Hast instructed many and thou has strengthened the weak hands what a testimony yeah many that's been overcome in things in their life you've instructed them sir yes yes sir so what what are you saying job was a Hands-On type of guy he was a Hands-On believer is that right this is this is what he was now notice thy words have upholding him that was Fallen prise God and thou has strengthen the feeble knees this was his testimony job was a channel he just didn't see great visions and great Inspirations and and speak this man had a testimony what he preached he lived God huj he was a living testimony and may I say it in this way I believe his congregation they caught that example as well I believe this message that God has so exemplified the character and example through and Life by the life of the messenger I don't know about you but when I hear about that man that stood there on the platform and brother randam was standing right back there with brother Billy Paul and he stood up there and said I'm regret to inform you brother brandom has not been able to make it tonight and he and Billy Paul are standing right there and Billy Paul said expose that liar he said no Billy let's go yeah amen drove around brother George gave me a little bit more insight on that building he said I'm going to drive around the front of the building I want you to get out and I want you to walk down across fromont the front the center section and walk out he said because people are going to see another advertisement and there's need needs in that building and they came there to be prayed for I want them to know that William brandham is a man of his word notice it wasn't about the brother I want the people's confidence not to be hindered and I don't want to blow up the meeting amen that was being a help what if it have blowned up the meeting what if brother Randon would have got in himself what if he would have accepted the provocation where Billy Paul was Billy Paul speaking at that moment has a son of God or as a son of William Mariam brandham he was speaking as a son of William Mary and brandom just as Jesus had to discern how Peter was speaking in that moment there comes a discernment Lord let me not get caught in the wrong Channel amen and then that man shows up in Jeffersonville within the next week and they're getting ready to sit down for dinner calls brother brandom on the phone but the said brother you're in town come on over for dinner we're getting ready and by the way are you going to be here on Wednesday night I'd like you to preach for us oh come on wow now this is from Brother George Smith and countless sources can you imagine well you can brother George said the gasp at the dinner table he did that to my daddy he did that you're going to invite him to come sit here after he did that to you oh Lord you see what I'm saying in with this right here is this to me as an example that God has called us to amen the what I've Got Confidence is the same quality of the holy spirit in him what it did in him it'll produce the same way in The Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not called to be a prophet neither are you but I am called to be a believer I am called to be a testimony you might not be called to preach but you're called to live and preach the word of God through your life you and I are all called to be an expression of this word let me try to find somewhere here notice in verse five but now it's come upon thee and thou faintest so in other words after job's been such a a channel for strength and now what's happening to you and you're fainting let me just say this if we could say this to Bill dad in life has he's not Superman and if you can accept it in this way their lack of understanding of the goodness of God they looked at the blessings of God as though the blessings of God everything is perfect and when Cloudy Skies oh God's angry at you well brother Bram had to sort through that in the Tabernacle when his eye was almost blown out with the shotgun brother brandham got in or with that with that rifle brother Bram got in a car accident and there was that circulating around the Tabernacle oh there must be some something in brother Neville's life there must be something in brother bram's life those things were circulating around there but listen to me God would take job's life and through his life he would actually teach them the grace of God in Trials God said this is better than a book it's better than just giving you a tape how about I let my servant job live a sermon Hallelujah cuz remember the end of this trial job had to pray for his friends they had to come and present a lamb he prayed God the final conclusion of his trial is where he would be able to actually pray for them with the right feeling and the right spirit let me read this scripture can I read just a few scriptures to you this is what we want to be guilty of it's lifting up one another amen everything we do Paul says is to edify right the body even the words and the things that we would speak right but Sam what is saying you just don't want to walk away from something and say well I told the truth right I gave them the word but what's important is you could give them the word but not give them the spirit of the word if you don't give them the spirit of the word you failed that's where we that's where we need the discernment because it isn't the word the letter the letter kth it's the spirit that giveth life is that right can I have these few moments we want to be guilty of lifting up that don't mean just patent I'm not talking about patent sin on the back but I don't think I should have to say that finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous that word pitiful means having a strong compass passion being tenderhearted as Paul said be kind to one another be tenderhearted friends I listen we're living in an age it's an age of hardness the Bible speaks of this age that it's without natural affection that is so true it's gone away truth Breakers somebody tell you one thing I'll be there it's nothing to break it no every people's words means nothing that's the spirit it's not the people it's the spirit of this age things has been sold all the way down through time it isn't just something that's come up overnight it's the crop of the hour that's been SED that is so good notice Paul would say for ye had compassion of me in my bonds this is what we want to have and I sometimes the bonds Paul writes of these bonds right here where they were giving financially they were giving of themselves there was needs that he had certain cares and Paul wrote of that but sometimes the bonds are not that simple sometimes the bonds are much deeper and I'm not saying that every one of us are qualified to go speak to somebody else and things like that some of those things right there is true God works right through and and by the ministry but let me just say this is if you'll just put in your part and say Lord here's my hands here's my feet Here I Am Lord like the sister saying tonight I want him to have all of me I I I I want to just be an instrument I want to just be a channel I want to just be a vessel Lord how you want to use me how many know he's a high priest that's touched am by the feeling of our infirmities then let me tell you you and I part of that body then let me tell you sometimes the ways and how he is touched it'll move through us and he will operate through our hands right he'll operate through our feet sure he'll operate through our lives it's not something you have to force or I have to force it isn't it isn't something that we're going out of here tonight and saying I am going to get the church registry and I'm going to text everybody on there that maybe that wouldn't be a good it maybe that wouldn't be a good it wouldn't be a bad thing forgive me it wouldn't be a bad thing but rather if we would come from way away from this here tonight in this part of it and say Lord help me to be more sensitive because who knows it might be the word that God has given you something that can actually minister to that brother or sister and you know what what it ends up being is how all of a sudden they'll get this text in the middle of the time or something or or a card or something that comes their way or just even a phone call say brother I'm praying for you Lord I I've got you on my heart Oh Brother s I'm so weary I'm so tired but if we go that extra mile if God's putting it on our heart then surely he's not leading us wrong brother I don't need to know what you're going through but I know this God knows just know you got somebody praying for you or standing right here in the corner for you that that's that's it that's the truth but but BR said it like this he says I like a good warm feeling don't you he's talking about how we shake one another's hand and embrace one another he said I hate that that old cold formal way we got people today they're so far away from one another you don't even care for one another that's what's the matter even church members get the same way they don't care for one another why if anybody does wrong trying to shove him down don't shove him down pick him up help him don't try to criticize him and tell somebody else go to him with your arms around him and today they're so afraid they don't even want to shake hands anymore just so you understand brother Brandon believed this so much that he quotes this multiple times they're going down the street and here stands a lady that says hello sister brandham hello sister brandom and brother Bram looks around and he says mey he said that woman over there she said she she said hi to you she said well I smiled he said smiled I'm just quoting and as he quoted in multiple messages he said that's not the way to do it don't just Nodge your head at her but greet that sister he wasn't just preaching to the congregation there at Jeffersonville it was an expression coming back now indeed that might have been just how sister mey was maybe there were things of life that was just kind of picked up but aren't you glad that God comes around and gives us Grace and says you know what a good old pump handle handshake is a right thing to [Applause] do yes [Applause] sir I'll stop here no matter how poor we are how we have to be run over how the world talks about you says anything about you it ought to make you keep your head up for the Morales of the rest of them we should never have words against one another we should always say the highest thing about about a brother or sister true you now it's not about them deserving it but it's always saying the highest thing about them right if one is down in the gutter don't never shove them any further down pick him up get him up out of there as quick as you can because it helps we should be an example we should live an example like we are Sons and Daughters of God the Eternal King we ought to conduct ourselves in that manner as Sons and Daughters of the king we should never do anything that would bring a disgrace let me just leave you on this slide I am My Brother's Keeper that is so good I am My Brother's Keeper what God would lay and place upon my heart what God places on your heart as you would stand and pray for that brother or that sister sometimes listen friends I understand that sometimes it's not about texting or calling but I think sometimes that we let those things go so much and we can become so occupied with the things of life that we just kind of brow that blow that off and you say well praying for him is the most important thing I agree I agree praying for him is the most most important thing but that little bit of showing compassion like job did job didn't only pray for the people he instructed many Lord he strengthened those who were feeble those who maybe were discouraged those that were down he just encouraged them maybe he didn't have to go through there and you say well job was a prophet I I don't believe that job always went and preached them a sermon maybe sometimes job just listened and would just remind him of the goodness of God sometimes just to be able to reflect on where God has brought you from what God has done in your life and how God will see you through can be of the greatest help to the rest of the body I don't know about you but this this right here tonight it strikes my heart I want to be a help I want to be more of a help I want to be more of a help if there's one thing at all I want to be more Cent sensitive I want to be more sensitive in the place friends that you might understand that even though sometimes there's things I can't get into it tonight but as we would look at it sometimes on the surface and we think this is this is what's wrong this is what's wrong and what we see on the surface is not what's wrong that's so true you can get everything corrected on the surface and everything beneath the surface be wrong remember the biggest part of the iceberg that the T sunk the Titanic was not what was on top of the water invisible it was what was beneath the water what was beneath the water cut the Hall of the ship where nobody could see the gash in there and the water pouring into the ship because it was beneath the surface I say God help us to be sensitive help us to be like the minute men were in the revolution help us to be sensitive if it's somebody comes to your heart in the middle of the night there many times like this friend sometimes it might be that where I I'll get up and I'll I'll pray sometimes it's simply was brought to me and trying to even get out of the sleep I'll say Lord remember brother so and so Lord and roll back over and go right back to sleep remember sister so and so Lord Lord remember this family Lord God Amen God knows what he's doing friends he sure does I trust tonight that as we've looked at some of this and looking at this tonight if we can just even allow the spirit of God to say Lord I'm not going to underestimate what you've called me to do I'm not going to I I help me to be a channel I may not be able to be like so and so God don't want you to be like so and so some people like brother Bram says are so gifted to testify some are in this way some are in that way but it doesn't matter I we don't have to be like nobody else just be sensitive to what God has you to because as you're an instrument and I'm an instrument then we can help one another as a body I say oh God May the Holy Spirit just continue to minister so deep in Our Lives May the word of God Lord guide us from the songs that are sung from the words that are that are mentioned from even to encourage somebody when they first come in that door you may not have seen them for months but if there's anything that should be the greatest help is to encourage him and say brother or sister it's good to see you so good to see you in the house of the Lord don't greet him and say stranger how are you doing you might as well have slapped them in the face spit in their face but you ought to be thankful that's what we've been praying about is that right that's what we've been praying about if there's anything at all we want to be an encouragement to one another because listen friends you don't know sometimes what's going down beneath the surface so I say Lord You're the answer not me just help me to be sensitive Lord is that your prayer that's what I want tonight just a real fresh consecration to him when this question is asked how hast thou helped how how did you minister to me Samuel when I was in prison did you come to me when I was thirsty did you give me drink Samuel when I was sick did you visit me when I needed ministering to did you minister to me God help us help us help us let's pray praise God hallelujah bless anybody else want to be remembered in prayer with me I'm just going to lift up for the lord lord and remember me God bless your hands I want both of my hands are up Lord help me Lord maybe as the musicians would come and play something softly heavenly father I realize Lord when I read Lord through this these things Lord that even as your Prophet would speak of it Lord that the feeling seems like it's lifting from one another now Lord it's not anything Lord that would ever be intentional Lord on our part but father sometimes through the cares of life we can Lord get away from Lord that place of really being sensitive sometimes Lord we we can become intimidated by our own weaknesses but father father May the burden that you place on our heart may that be Lord so much greater than any weakness Lord that we would have so many times Lord that that's how Satan would want to hold us back but Lord we're called to minister to one another right here in this assembly Lord yeah we're called as a body to minister to one another there's different ones Lord that father I I'm so thankful that throughout this assembly hearts Lord that would be moved by your spirit Lord that would call one another's names out in prayer they would send a text maybe a card maybe they would just greet the brother or sister and say I'm praying for you I want you to know I I love you I want you to know I love you I appreciate you Lord sometimes it isn't it isn't everything Lord of the amount of words that we would say it's sometimes Lord just the simpleness of just being yielded in Simplicity Lord I pray tonight Lord that as we lord would reflect I Lord right here in my heart you know it's me Lord when I'm ministering the word I don't just Lord and anything I Minister I don't look at the rest of the congregation my heart is being examined Lord my heart I Want My Heart Lord I don't want my heart left out of it I want more Lord I want more of the holy spirit in my life to make me more of a servant Lord like he was make me more humble Lord make me more sensitive Lord help me Lord I pray oh God I I realize Lord at times there's times where you've led me to minister certain things Lord whether it be here or other places Lord sometimes it's been things on the spare of the moment Lord but father I don't only want to be sensitive to minister in that way I want to be sensitive Lord when I'm maybe Lord riding along and you lay it on my heart text this brother let him know you love him let him know you're praying for him text this family Tex Lord say something here to them greet them get with this one Lord help us father oh God help us we want to be a help one to another Lord I think of it Lord God throughout this assembly Lord if it was all on me I just say it like this Lord even where the church is at today it wouldn't be here but I thank you God for faithful brothers and sisters that would go beyond the bounds Lord of even work time when they're weary or they're tired and they would call somebody talk to them Lord they would Minister to them in some way oh God I I love to see the body operate but that's what you intended there's needs that Lord we'll see within one another there's needs Lord that could be father down there maybe in brother Donnie's assembly Lord God brother Nathan bry's different ones Lord I wouldn't I wouldn't know about them needs you did not not Place me there Lord You've placed me here father these are my brothers and sisters these are those Lord God that you've called me Lord you've called each one of us to minister to the needs of one another Lord but father help us Lord that we can be the channel the right kind of a channel that the comforter himself might be able to minister comfort to someone else help us Lord I pray help each and every one Lord father where there's been Lord failures Lord we' we've all made mistakes Lord we've all let down in in certain times and areas Lord there's times where we should have gone and we didn't Lord God and there's times we wouldn't and we shouldn't have Lord but help us Lord would you give us Lord I pray the discernment of the Holy Spirit Lord to know what to say when to say it and how to say it Lord amen granted Lord I pray that when we would stand there on that day and the question is asked H how hast thou helped him who was without strength Lord God let me be a channel that the strength of the Holy Spirit can flow through let my brothers Lord every brother every sister Lord let them be a channel that the strength of the Holy Spirit can flow through Lord some times Lord the support we are to one another it's almost like the easel of a picture it just supports the picture Lord sometimes Lord It's just our presence Lord with one another that supports one another help us Lord I pray Lord God we love you Lord I believe I can speak freely for every brother and sister Lord as we're gathered here tonight we love you we love you father and Lord Jesus this is our desire

again I want [Music] to I [Music] never I want to share a testimony with you is this morning I woke up and I was praising praying to God I said Lord use me today Lord and uh so I was praying and I got up and it started coming to me I I'm painting my garage little by little and you know it kept on saying You Know The Enemy was saying you need to get get this done you need to do this and I said today's Church you know I have to get my clothes ready have to get ready and shave and but uh I went and I made my breakfast and I was uh sitting there and he said today you'll go the Home Depot and go testify I said okay Lord so you know and uh about 2 2:15 he say it's time for you to go go to Home Depot and you go look for that fella that you witnessed to the other day and I was listening to Billy uh brother Bram talking about Billy Graham and how Billy Graham said if he would go preach somewhere thousands would come and then the next year he comes couldn't even find one or two and he says why did Billy do that why did he say that he says now I I agree with I I really appreciate Billy Billy Graham and doing everything he does he he says he's remarkable out there and he says but what what is he doing he said like Paul why did Paul's Converse State he said because Paul stayed there till they got filled with the Holy Ghost he he made it made a made it that they would come to accept the Lord that's why they were there and he says and he says if Billy would have went there and did and followed up and I thought uhoh follow up that's what he told me this morning go talk to that Soul again and he says now it's time to for you to go Go Home Depot it was about 2:30 got there about 2:30 and I said Lord I'm going to walk he says while I was coming into the parking lot he said you'll park your car this over here you're not going to park it by the registers which I usually do he said you're going to park it over here so I parked it over there and I came in and walked down that aisle I says I don't know where he's at but I'm looking for him Lord and I started looking uh looking for him and when I came to the end of the aisle by the kitchen stuff I looked and there he was coming and IAL talked to him once again about the Lord and while I was talking to him sister Emma was there with her mother and he said you'll talk to Emma's mother too so I talked to her try to comfort her in her time that her husband's ped and uh uh her mother says please pray for me that's what's her last words please pray for me I said yeah and I told sister EMA I says sister EMA she's she's here she can testify I said I'm here to witness I came here to witness only to come to this Home Depot and I did what what he told me to do so I said goodbye and God bless and I left and uh when I took about 10 or 15 ft the devil said you you know you didn't do enough you know he said you didn't do enough you should have kept on and you could have said this and you could have said that but you have to have that discernment to know I I said Lord I says I did what you wanted me to do and say what you wanted me to say and I pray that you would reach out to must mother and touch her and comfort her and conso her in her time of stress and her de you know loneliness Lord touch her Lord and touch this one that I've witness to again and you know the devil said he ain't going to come to church he said he would today but he's not going to be there you know he ain't going to be there and when I came he's not here he said he was going to come you know but I did what God wanted me to do see and we can't go down through that channel and say well yeah where is he you know God know where is he at because God put it in my heart to go there just to go to Home Depot when when I left sister Iman I said to Sister Iman I says I only came here to testify and I'm turning around and leaving so God bless you I just thought that this was timely with the message you know uh being having that discernment to know what you what to say and what not to say and don't be anxious for anything but just trusting in God because God knows where they are at God knows how to comfort I just did what what he told me to do this morning and uh he said you have to go at 2:30 you have to go now you have to be there you have to go there and you know what when he was coming the young man when he was coming he was just leaving to go home if that's not Timely God bless you God bless you I say it to you like this you know that you can you can when you hear the testimonies and things just just to be mindful in this right here God speaks to us in so many different ways and he'll speak to us how he speaks to us that's right you know there's certain ways that God will speak to you or he'll speak to me that he may not speak to somebody else is as far as in that exact way but God does speak yes he does sometimes it's just it's just a a pulsation that God would just move on our heart at that moment and just to be obedient to it I remember one time I was walking I was as I go out and walk at Lake View Park and I kept making these passes and the Holy Spirit directed me back here to this young lady that was sitting there praise the Lord it was a young young black lady she was sitting there and she was reading out there in the in the reading in the middle and I I walked over and I just thought well no I'm not going to there was all people all around and I so then I begin to talk to her we just started to talk and I begin to just speak about just the things of God just to witness about the things of the Lord and and just begin to testify to her now she never ever came here but she does know where the church is at and we begin to just just begin to witness to her I'm not trying to pull nobody here but I just wanted to know that God God cares about you and I've walked by you I don't know how many times and the Lord told me about the first lap around I should have stopped but I ignored him and I went on think it was my mind sure I said so this is why I'm here right now because he told me but I doesn't want that out there I want that right here in the body right right right here in the body amen amen God bless you tonight you have a testimony okay praise God praise the Lord praise the Lord Saints I I have said I well before I left South Carolina I had told the Lord I said well God I said I I'm going to if they ask me for a testimony I'm going testify but tonight I was supposed to get here and enough time to sh share with you all the testimony of what God is doing in my life in South Carolina um I had promised him I was going to do that but I didn't get here early enough but I said at the end I had said well Lord if you want me to get the testimony let him ask for testimonies and since the brother was up here testifying I said I can't go back to South Carolina without giving this testimony because when God is doing the supernatural the more you testify God to do more and that's what I want to happen I don't have the pictures I didn't get here early enough to show to share with you all the picture the two pictures but anyways um to make a long story short my brother on August 8th um just maybe two months ago my brother um he was basically we couldn't find him nobody had heard from him for like three days they found we found him on the floor in his apartment it had been 4 days he was on the floor nonresponsive B barely clinging to life and so when EMS got there and everything basically he was barely breathing and um turns out he had a stroke he had a really bad hemorrhagic stroke on the brain and by the time they got him to the hospital um the doctors I mean we entrusted in them you know you go to the hospital and you're like okay man can help me at this point so they got him there and tried to bring his blood pressure down and they messed up my sister is a medical doctor and she will tell you when you have a stroke you can't just bring the person's blood pressure down like you know immediately it has to be gradually so they messed that up and he ended up having a second stroke so here he is basically fighting for his life having two strokes he's on life support he got all of the tubes coming out everywhere and so you know I to I I was just like Lord you know the doctor said even if he survives he'll be a vegetable The Impossible and I was just like Lord you know I had told my family I always testified to them when God speaks to me and I felt like it was for them I told them maybe two week two two months before it happened I said y'all the Lord spoke to me and said the death angel was coming and for you all to get sin out of your life because the Death Angel is coming and get up under the blood I don't know why he spoke to me and told me that and then this happened with my brother so so I was like okay when I was I went to his room and I prayed for two hours straight in his ear I said Lord I said hearing is the last thing for to go before a person dies but my prayer was like God if you you know if this is the Fulfillment of what you were saying don't let my brother suffer but I was like please just take him but I don't know what the will of God is in this situation so I just prayed like I I mean I prayed for life I was like Lord I don't know what your will is but let me pray I prayed 2 hours straight and I couldn't get up the next morning he just lay there he was in a coma nonresponsive there was nothing and I went home I said y'all I need a word from God I stayed after church um and we had a miracle service and I said Lord if the spirit of God you know the spirit of Miracles was there I'm I was like God I don't know if it's for you to take him but I said let me know something and the the man of God said he shall live and not die for the glory of God and I just held on to that I said God I believe you want to do a miracle prise so I stopped I said look family I said y'all just leave me alone I mean this has been going on so he stayed in the coma for a whole month Saints a whole month wow and I was wrestling with the angel I said look I got to pray and get a breakthrough I'm not talking about no pretty prayer I'm talking about agonizing before God until he answers back and one of the services God came down and it was like a miracle I said okay this is it this is it I said God I want you to go to the hospital and I want you to bring his Spirit back cuz he's gone and the Lord Vindicated that he had answered my prayer the next morning he had been in a coma for a whole month the next morning when my brother my other brother went in there said Paul was awake he was responding he was up watching television this is how God works you know the impossible so after everybody had shook their head and said nothing could be done he bought my my brother out of that coma and and just you know when you come out of a coma you know it's not like you know everybody says well okay my sister was like okay he's going to be depressed he could have problems with depression and this so he cried for a little while but then the depression left and everything and I just appreciate God because now to this day he took they took him and put him in rehab the left side of his body was still paralyzed and I told him I said look family I said I'm asking God to do another miracle for my brother if he raised him from the dead I know he can move the paralysis Hallelujah so just before I came that's why I said I'm testifying now before I came they said that they were going to have to move him to a nursing home Saints because he could he had that paralysis in the left side of his body but before I came he was walking walking and I and I just I just praise God because y'all I we before God and I praise God y'all you know it's something about just praising God because he is I told I told my brothers and sisters I said my brother is going to walk out of that rehab place and I said y'all trying to say he going to go to a nursing home he's walking out of there because the God that I serve is able okay and and and he is and I just said I I said when I go to Ohio I said I'm going to testify because when God is doing the supernal we got to testify and so I just want y'all to continue praying for my family God has been doing the supernatural to get their attention but they hardheaded y'all so just please remember remember the Noble's family I appreciate y'all and God bless y'all amen hallelujah amen amen why don't we just why don't we just be dismissed in prayer but we're just going to ask the Lord just to go with us and shake hands with one another after we're we're done it's been good to be in the house of the Lord I thank God for for the testimonies I thank God for the song specials I thank God for each one of those things heavenly father thank you Lord Jesus Lord you are so mindful Lord of of our needs Lord father just in every part in every aspect Lord through tonight that theme has rung Lord and has moved upon our hearts Lord who the songs of Zion through the specials through the testimonies through your word is Lord God we want to be a Channel of help Lord hallelujah we want to be a help to the body Lord to one another Lord Jesus however you Lord would choose to use us you've got us in a way you've made us a certain way for a certain reason a certain purpose each one Lord has a Ministry a gift in the body Lord and father I know that Lord there'll be individuals that I know I've spoke to some others Lord have spoke to others too dear God sometimes Lord that you know when I think when I first started serving you I would feel so defeated if I didn't see somebody come Lord to accept and embrace the truth of this hour I feel like Lord that I what did I do that I let down in some way but Lord you've taught me you've helped me to see that sometimes Lord I I can never give that to somebody else but God this has been my prayer ever since that you made that known to me is let me encourage every one of your children that God they might walk fully in the light that you've called them to walk in Lord God be a light if there Lord to come to this to this truth then Lord it'll be you to bring them Lord it'll be you to draw them Lord it'll be you Lord there'll be a hunger within them for more but I pray Lord God May Lord those that we rub shoulders with Lord and sometimes in the shopping place and the workplace and other places God May our life Lord be that dear God that would provoke one another Lord to live fully Lord what you
