together once again and just thank god for his hand that he has kept upon our lives and allowed us that we're able to be able to continue to meet together and we just you know we're living in a in a really a wonderful time uh and i i think we we we identify with that as far as the world it's a it's a terrible time it's a time of great uncertainty it's a time where you know where people are depending upon people but i'm thankful that we're our dependence is in the lord and that doesn't mean we have all the answers but we have the answer we have him that will lead us brother branham of justice hearing brother branham here this afternoon you've heard this story that he would express regarding a schwinn bicycle that was going to be given away and brother branham takes it in in this particular message and he relates it to the place of where all sorts of things are going on around us so back in 1955 he said all sorts of things are happening all around us he said but where i find my joy is in him and where i have my focus brother brahm then takes that story and you know there's just certain times that sometimes there's things that you've heard and maybe it meant something to you before but it just it just even means a little bit more to you just at that time because there was some boys that got on that board and they started to ride that bike now brother brahm tells us that the boys that got on that bike to ride it they were strong apt able boys in other words they were thought if anybody can do it they can do it and they got on there and they fell off brother brown said here come a boy that in the community that was regarded as a right but he climbed on that bike and he rode that bike clear to the end and the rest of the boys that were strong and apt man these were the guys that everybody was they're going to make it they asked they asked him how did you do it he said simple you fellas he said you got your eyes on what was going on around you he said but i kept my eyes on the end [Music] we've got a clear destination we are not a distracted people [Music] are you with me what is the attraction on the mount [Applause] we're a people where god has made a sign known to you and i that we have become united with that same sign and that's him are you with me that's him we've become united with not a church not an idea it's an attraction we have been attracted to him because he's what set us free and our eyes are focused on him let that be our testimony we're being hey listen i could preach a lot on this we're being tested we're being tested we will continue to be tested our character is being tested everything around us is being tested so in the midst of this time let us not be ignorant of satan's devices let us be mindful that just as much as he is always trying to work to put a kink in the hose to try to hinder our focus is in the living god god is seeing us through is that right god is seeing us through god will continue to see us through it amen let us just have our confidence in him amen let's let's look to the lord in a word of prayer before we read in our scriptures here this evening heavenly father we just lord take every one of these requests we take the needs that's on the heart the unspoken request lord we lift him oh god before your throne and we ask that lord you'll just come whether here whether over the internet no matter where we might and where we are gathered together may lord you go forth and minister to that need lord minister that you're the i am that i am minister to that life [Music] lord we just pray that you'll just come speak to our hearts tonight we love you and we thank you father in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's turn in our bibles to ephesians chapter 2. i want to say thank you to musicians we certainly appreciated your prayers we weren't here on sunday but the lord i know that you had a wonderful time in his presence with brother alexander and i think brother alexander for coming we kind of just swapped places i was down there ministering to the saints in in bluffton ohio brother ray erickson's the assembly there and the lord just so richly uh moved there on behalf of the needs of his children as well so we thank god for that because it's certainly nothing we can do it has to be him so ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 and notice paul these are familiar scriptures perhaps to many of you but notice how paul would take this and he says and you hath he quickened now he's speaking to the to the real you that has been quickened then he goes into the condition we were in who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein time passed ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation that's your character your actions your behavior your life among whom we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others if you can really receive this what paul is writing he's eulogizing a dead man you can't eulogize a living man he's still alive i mean if somebody came and said hey i'm gonna i'm gonna read a eulogy of you and you think me i'm not even dead why would you eulogize me but you see the word is eulogizing that first nature dead but there is that new nature that life that was hidden that was dead now has been raised up we're not reading a eulogy we're reading this is our life but god look at this but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us what was lovable about us nothing out here in this first character but god was looking beneath the darkness even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus on two good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen i'd like to speak here tonight on the sovereign working of the holy spirit may god bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated and when we look and you take the whole theme we could say plot theme the main idea what within the scriptures the entire bible there's one goal that god is trying to achieve we find that the the desire is that god's desire is to come and to live inside of his people there's no way that man could make himself fit for this but god himself is the one who does the work and the one who provides for us what's needed in order that we might prepare our lives for his coming you know you look at there's so many different angles when we look at in the scripture that all speaks of the same goal it doesn't matter um what a particular story or when i don't just even like to use the word story but when you look at every expression and every characteristic through the scriptures you see this whole goal is that god's desire is he desires to dwell inside his children there are things of how that god uh you know will will take it in a manner of like a man running a race but yet there is a right way to run that race you know how it is if that race is not run correctly then no matter how a person they could cross the finish line if they have not run it correctly they are disqualified right so there's so many different angles even how paul would take it as a soldier one who would even be be equipped for the battle that he is preparing to enter into and on and on through the scriptures we could go but we wanted even just to look back even how god would set this forth even in genesis 1 where in the beginning you find this the earth itself was under a condition of darkness darkness is judgment it was under that of us of a time of judgment but within that darkness it was void uh there was no uh indication of life but remember god had planted every seed beneath the darkness beneath the waters that was covering that that the earth god had already planted the seeds by his word and we find in the beginning where the holy spirit is brooding over the earth after god has said let there be light and the bible speaks and declares then the spirit of god moved you see the word making a call a purpose a desire the holy spirit comes forth which is the word to perform or to bring into expression what the word is calling for so it's this is god's working in our own individual life we hear what the word is saying but let me just say it to you very clearly we can hear with these ears but it's really hearing down in here and we sense the call of the holy spirit that's the brooding of the holy spirit that comes upon a heart comes upon our life and says i'm here to perform what the word is calling for and so the sovereignty of how that it comes that it's god working it's him that's working the scripture where it speaks blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled it is it's god moving to bring forth the desire that is down there on the inside you know a person can have a desire to serve god a desire to be right and yet they've never repented because the repentance doesn't bring the desire the desire is the hidden potential down on the inside in that seed it's something about it that a person can go all their life they can you know get be trapped into all sorts of sin and all sorts of marks and things upon their life but there's still something there about it that they know there's a god somewhere though they don't know about him and though they don't know you know how how will i ever get out of this but yet there's a desire that is there i will call it a thirst that god put within you and there's nothing in this world can satisfy that thirst that desire except the very god himself who placed that thirst that desire was in you and you know many things can come along and you know things that where it will uh try to suppress or to take away that desire but let me just say and that desire can never be quenched that desire can never be taken away uh it might go a long time before it ever comes into expression but when god has given that desire there is no matter of sin no matter how you would rank it there shouldn't be any ranking it doesn't matter about that at all it comes down because we see in the ministry of the lord jesus he could have come to the pharisees and turned them all around that they remember they themselves they were righteous they themselves were righteous couldn't put a finger on their life but jesus came and he began to deal with the inward man because that's what the messiah was coming for is to bring a change on the inside it's not about the righteousness how well that a person can you know what somehow perfect their body and their life of well i don't do this and i don't do that but yet if they still desire sin on the inside i don't care how righteous they are on the outside they still are guilty in the eyes of god maybe in the eyes of man they're innocent like whoa what a wonderful person but in the eyes of god they are still guilty see god came to deal with the inward man with the inward work with the heart with the life of man with that nature on the inside so god would move in such a measure that to bring forth the desire the longing to bring that into a place to where it becomes expressed it becomes expressed in that life because the real darkness the real darkness that covers our life or might be covering your life that darkness is that first birth but if you've received a word from god and god is there moving on that life and saying let there be light and you experience the brooding of the holy spirit where he's moving upon your life and beginning to change even how you think and beginning to change your heart and begin to open you that is a work of the holy spirit working to bring forth that desire to lift you above your first birth and to bring you to a new birth the bible says in ezekiel 36 i want to come back into this tonight in verse 24 for i will take you from among the heathen now remember god is writing this prophetically regarding israel but remember it parallels the hour and the time that we're living in let me read this for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land now what's your thing think about the jews here that where they had you know many were born in germany and uh there were those you know the ethiopian jews and you have those that were born in other countries you have the jews that were born here you have jews and romania all those other places but god said i will gather you so god is gathering bringing the jews into a place back to their land where he can make himself known to them in other words he's gathering them though they are jews he's gathering them out of the places of where they were born the land of their natural nativity this is what he did to abraham are you with me this is what he does for you and i he calls us out from the crowd from the life from the people that we were walking with just like abraham and he says come out from among them that is part of heeding in obedience to the voice and that is a sovereign work of the brooding of the holy spirit upon your life hallelujah to bring us into our own land our own place the real nativity of our life amen verse 25 then notice once now he's bringing them you see you've got to get him into a land you've got to come to a place where he can reveal himself i hope you're with me now he you got to come to a place where life is you can't come to a place where it's just just just church where it's just theology where it's just doctrine that's not the place of life you must come to a place of life where he is together because the bible said that where two or three are gathered together in my name and it's not just saying the name of jesus his name is his life his character his nature it's him amen is that right he said i am come in my father's name hallelujah amen and where where the word the meat is the the meat there where the eagles be gathered together so we might he has to draw us let me just give the example here you are as a person and maybe you're going about you know your own way and god sounds to your heart and you think i didn't hear nothing here he's not sounding to it here he's calling this down here this is the man he's trying to bring into a bear it's a supernatural call that begins to go forth that a person doesn't even understand what's going on god might deal with them in dreams god might deal with them in other ways but remember he will always deal with them according even to their makeup god knows how to get our attention amen so you must bring us into that place into that of our own land then he says in verse 25 then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean water speaks of the spirit speaks of the word from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you so the sprinkling of clean water if you catch it it's him he is the word this is the life that is coming forth it is the preaching of the word that deals with the stony heart it's the preaching of the word even when a person would say oh that's hard oh my goodness all this is said but you see god has to come it's not the hardness of the man preaching it is christ the man could just stand right here maybe don't even raise his voice it's not the man's voice it is the presence of the lord that begins to deal with that heart and there's times that god has to point out things that seem very very much maybe on the outside with how the outside is presented why because his desire is not that we patch up the outside and try to make the outside all nice no god is letting us know that there is something lacking on the inside and if you get the inside man you get christ in there the outside will reflect the inside i'm talking about a power the holy ghost is not an intellectual thought it is the power of god in that it brings us into the presence of one who is greater one who's able to minister to our needs that's why there's healing in the church are you with me this is why there's healing in the church this is why we need healing signs and wonders not just back there in the church i thank god we've had signs and wonders we've had that here it's not about signs and wonders of building us up you understand what those signs and wonders are it is a testimony to hearts and lives to see the living god not a man a man can't do those things a man cannot turn stage four cancer around that takes a living god to do that amen you can even take a person that has experienced healing maybe they didn't hang on to their healing maybe they lost faith but there was still healing are you with me jesus said go that way and sin no more lest the worst thing come upon you satan will be there to challenge healing are you with me it isn't just well you know i've been healed and might just go on no that's why the prophet said do not get around unbelievers do not get around doubters don't entertain any thought that comes up and says well uh this is just a few days and why don't you look at this you cast down every imagination are you with me because that's really where the prophet would say i wish i had a tent he said to lay in these principles on divine healing because many times people they leave and the spirit within that cancer has been cast out the life of it and then they go off they go off and then they begin to look and it grows in them but what it is it's like a dead dog that's been ran over on the road it is not that big and bloated when you first run over it but if you let it set it becomes big and bloated that is a sure sign when they say i'm sicker than i used to be that's a sign you've been healed are you with me you're talking about how to stand there on the water and saying devil you're not coming back here every time god ministers a promise to your heart you've got to stand there with the sword of the lord god has sovereignly come to you and you've got a right to stand there and say get out of here you're not coming back he wants to raise up his head take it off if it took off on monday get ready to take it off on tuesday thank you hallelujah there in the book of revelations he says behold i make everything new god's working the sovereign working of god it's not a patch up job you know it ain't like you take your tire into the store and you wonder oh my goodness is the tire any good and they say now we put some bubble gum on it or we can put a little bit of i don't know what you call that hot and sealed stuff or whatever i don't know you some of you are a little bit more versed in that than me it's a patch job you know sooner or later i better be watching this better not be my better not be making you know so many trips and i know they guarantee all these patch jobs you with me they they're guaranteed god don't bring patch jobs he ain't trying to patch your character that's not what the working of the holy ghost is all about he ain't trying to patch you up patch it up and make you a patchwork quilt he's interested in a full display of his own life and it is the holy spirit that works in our life through experiences did you know what i said experiences of divine grace it's the working of the holy spirit that is moving and he is creating he is making all things anew brother iran would take that word new and in this scripture here in verse 26 he says a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you brother braham said that just brings such joy to my heart you see everything that god does is new not recycled sorry tree huggers not recycled god don't recycle things he gives a new heart and a new spirit and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and the reality is is that no matter how what you and i would try to do you can't break a stony heart in somebody else that takes the sovereign work of almighty god it can take place right in church it can take place right while they're out there on the highway or on the job or other place god knows exactly where they're at amen is that right god knows how to turn that stony heart remember a stony heart is nothing you can sow any seed into that's right right well i'm gonna try to crack it i'm gonna try to crack it words don't crack it right well they need this so i'm gonna that don't crack it the matter of fact that'll make them resent you it's a spirit do you understand what i'm saying it's a spirit that's on them why is it when you go talk to somebody and and then you know and maybe you start talking about things of the lord and they begin to resent it you want to know why it's a spirit amen use discernment within that amen you cannot go to battle against the spirit with your own wits and your own reasoning but to recognize there's a greater power on the inside of you what do i have to do the same way god did it for you and i he didn't speak to that old character that old nature god came to call out that desire that one that's on the inside that's a challenge i said that's a challenge for us because many times we're looking at all the expressions and all these things out through here but you see the spirit of god makes us aware of these things we're dealing with spirits right it's not the person the spirits it doesn't listen to me it does not mean they're demon possessed it means they are influenced and available to that influence are you with me it doesn't mean they're demon possessed yet the devil needs to be cast out in other words there needs to come a place to there no longer is a welcome map that's put out there for him but god's the one to come down and remove the welcome man but you see a new heart it's a new way of thinking it's a new way of thinking you become open like you all of a sudden you see and we could we can all go back into this in our own lives you see lives all of a sudden they begin to become open what is it it's god sovereignly working because remember god is not going to put anybody into a headlock god is not going to make nobody serve him because that's not real servitude that's slavery based in fear a new spirit is where you begin to quit evil in your life amen begin to lay it aside you begin to recognize you see there's something if the spirit of god is dealing with your life and you begin to recognize lay this aside see it's moving in your life it's acquitting it's a laying and surprise paul said lay aside every weight things that are slowing you down are hindering you and the sin which does so easily beset you let me just say it to you like this don't say oh this is hard for me i don't know if i can do this that might be true because why the nature the old nature is still there but take the confession of the word the bible said in hebrews 3 he is a high priest that can be touched by our confession we are to confess what he has already done there is no nothing you can call into question in the blood of jesus you cannot say that it did not meet and suffice the very payment that was needed in order to ransom you and i brother he just did not pay the sin death he bought you out of the slave market this is what the blood of jesus when it was shed for you and i that's why when the spirit of god comes and deals with our life and as he moves in a heart and a life he wants he doing brother brown would also deal with this working and even this time in the new heart and new spirit here is the holy spirit as the tutor of the church of the living god are you with me it is brother samuel tutoring you it's the holy spirit he's the one who've been working in your life he's the one telling you saying hey lay that aside lay it aside don't look at oh this has always been no no hear his voice he's brooding what must i say yes holy spirit you're yielding you're yielding he's working and you and you understand this even the older ones are here you understand that this principle never ceases it's yielding it's him working so don't wrestle with it don't wrestle with it if dress is an issue don't wrestle with it what do i do have by faith apply the blood of jesus christ lord i lay this down in the name of jesus christ let me tell you there's power in the name of jesus christ the bible said if you say to this mountain be thou removed plucked up and cast into the undersea it shall be even as thou hast said brother man said you may not even see the mountain move but it's a grain of sand that has turned loose and that is a testimony the mountain's moving so what must i do look paul in that same scripture looking unto jesus the author he who started dealing with your life look to him don't get your eyes on anything else don't get your eyes on yourself keep your eyes on him amen now let me let me move into this place here brother brown would take us over and over into the scripture right in the midst of where we talk about the new heart and the new spirit in matthew 12 43 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man did you catch that it's not cast out he goes out willingly what causes the spirit to go out willingly repentance true repentance he does not cast out he goes out he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith now watch this i will return into my house see this is a house he drank in cursed in fornicated in did everything in this is my house i wasn't kicked out i walked out willingly amen come on you know how it is start talking about the lord at a family gathering you get people walking away like roaches crawling out when the light's been turned on you understand what i'm saying you don't have to tell them hey i'm going to talk about the lord get out of here just start talking about god start talking about it is that right see the enemy oh i hope you can understand this the enemy is not comfortable when the word when you begin to tune in to what the holy spirit is saying to the church when you begin to tune into that that makes the devil uncomfortable and he leaves [Music] yes here's what he said i will return into my house from whence i not cast out i came out and when he has come he findeth it empty all the things that he had there card tables everything else he had there let's say you know make up short skirts and you know even the men now with their skinny britches and things like that come on inspired by homosexuals all of the stuff that's out there you understand what i'm talking about you know he comes he finds it empty oh these things are no longer there they've been swept out not just swept over in the corner swept out it's been cleaned up it's been garnished amen then go with he i want you to watch this now it didn't say that when he comes to that house he sees it like it is that he goes right inside but he finds it that it's empty it's empty oh it's sweat it's garnish but it's empty you know what it means when there's an empty house it's available for occupancy are you with me a new heart and a new spirit come on god son i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit now notice then go with he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there my so now it's not just one unclean spirit he he takes with him seven other spirits and they enter in and they say man this is nice now they don't come back in let me just finish reading the verse and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also under this wicked generation now let me just tell you something remember the rebellion that was led in heaven was not playing rock and roll ain't how the angels were led away from their first estate and when the disco ball got put up there come on now it wasn't the saloon that got put up there it was shaped and told a tale a t-a-l-e are you with me he preached yeah you're right are you with me this is why there were angels that fell they fell with him they kept not the bible said kept not their first estate but you look at those devils those demons sure we see the debauchery even from now the fall you see even attributes and whatever more of sin but this right here if i probably were to give this scripture to many people and i'm not going to say to people here but maybe even for those here and you would look at this and say man more wicked than he's ever been you would think man this guy he's going to be a drunkard that's going around and beating people up he's going to be a drug head that's going to be doing this no no no no that's not at all remember when these seven other devils come in with this one it's not coming back in there to clutter the place up but it comes back in and it says my you know this is nice this place has been covered up but actually what they do they move upon that person and say you know what you're good you're fine look at you you used to be a drunkard you don't drink no more yeah it's all right i mean you don't have to go along with that real what they're talking about the holy ghost look at you your life is better than it's ever been why is that what is the more wickedness this is the words of the prophet coming in this word in this hour he says it actually becomes a religious devil where you can't tell them nothing where they become satisfied he says a matter of fact they become haters of god they despise the word challenging their life they look at it and say that's not necessary that don't need to be and yet you could maybe look at the life and say well man i used to know them they were a drug header there was a prostitute or it was this or was that and look at them their life is cleaned up but then when you begin to look at it a little longer you realize it's not a real beating of the holy ghost by the love of god on the inside it's a religious devil it is the worst kind it's the worst kind i would rather any day to deal with a prostitute a drunkard or anybody else than a religious devil even those who said in message churches i'd rather deal with that that's a dangerous place to be in because you know why the new heart and the new spirit is not the holy spirit but it is what god has gifted look god has gifted that new heart you realize before you could ever repent i just read the opening scripture it's the grace of god not of works lest any man should both but it actually is the gifting of divine grace that we have not merited or earned but grace has gifted to you and i that our faith oh my our faith was in shambles and everywhere else but remember god will not override our faith he will not work contrary to our faith but god comes to energize our faith over and over in the scripture remember daughter thy faith has healed thee daughter thy faith hath healed me my son by faith what is it it's god coming and moving behind that faith and moving the faith into a place to actually believe the things that god is desiring to do within our life so it's truly a gift of almighty god it's god's grace to you and i now when you think of it remember the holy spirit himself even as you would take another type it's like a husband and a wife or let's say you know a a couple that is courting dating and here they are you know they become interested in one another they become attracted to one another they've not yet made their vows their commitment the proposals not been made and accepted there's not been an engagement because the engagement itself is actually the new birth of the holy ghost are you with me the courtship itself is where god is dealing with that heart god is calling to that heart now think about it what man or what woman really what would you want to would you want to marry somebody that you're arguing with the whole time you're disagreeing with the whole time there's fussing and fighting going on the whole time every time you go out on a date it's always fussing and fighting and carrying on somebody disagree remember marriage don't change that marriage itself just makes it to where you're duking at one another right in the same house all the time are you with me this is the same way that the holy spirit he is not going to come into a place that's disagreeable and that is like a wolf he comes to that which becomes lamb-like one that actually can be led one that is actually you know being tamed and being moved upon by the spirit of god and is welcoming to his working this is what he will come to now we recognize that within any natural birth there's three stages you cannot skip a stage and there be a birth we realize it's justification it's sanctification and then the baptism of the holy ghost i have all three of them are workings of the same spirit it's god working to bring a person in justification to repentance to recognize that there indeed the lamb of god has been offered on their behalf and their sin debt is paid and that they indeed can be forgiven because you can't approach you can't approach him if you don't know you've been forgiven are you with me that's just even the first step just to be forgiven then we find within that you know it's just like when a woman goes to give birth the water breaks that's how that you know the brothers know it's time to go it's time to go the water has broke it's time to go what is that justification it's time to go it's making ready man it's getting close then you find the blood begins to come forth now as we're there within that birth we're going into a place listen to me we're going to a place where children are born is that right no matter it's in there it is within the womb but in order for that child to actually come forth into birth it must actually come forth and take that breath of life and then it begins to express it begins to develop it begins to grow when after it is born are you with me i know you know i've gotten speaking to some sisters that you know they're they're they're in couples they're expecting right now and you know you finally get to a spot i know how my wife and i were you know well not me but my wife you know but you understand what i'm saying it'd get to a place and finally she said man i'm telling you what i can't wait for zachary to get here i can't wait for paul or benjamin i mean to get here because because what it is the the child itself it grew inside the womb but it grew as much as it could grow within that place and it needed to be released let me just tell you it's the working of the holy spirit that is moving on a life he's growing and developing he's working until finally the heart says lord i want to be full of the holy ghost i want to be born again lord because we don't want to have stillbirth we don't want it we do want premature birth we want everything to be in the term the time the season amen now in first john 5 6 let's pick this up this is he now notice how john would write this this is he that came by water and blood notice how john would draw that to you and i by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood notice him re-emphasizing it because if he came by water only it's still sinful blood right yeah if he came by water only everyone everyone else came by water only but he is setting up here by divine inspiration that there has come water and blood what is in the blood within the blood is the dna is the life that's what we're talking about god wrapped himself in the creative blood cell all other blood was polluted there wasn't any man could redeem you and i i don't care how righteous he was how holy he was it was all together filthy reds before him amen it required god becoming a kinsman redeemer is he that came not with water only hallelujah but my water and blood amen amen he had to get himself a son because his son is who packs the father's name are you with me he packs the life of the father he's back in the genealogy right jesus said i am come in my father's name hallelujah right he came not by water and blood so what is it it's god coming under that family name here his life wrapped into the blood because there are more of his children sons and daughters real seed that they are trapped in that first birth and they need a deliverance through the blood cell where it pays the debt and releases the life in that blood cell to come back upon the worshiper when i say come back upon the worshiper not just here not just in the spirit your mind but to come and bring transformation on the inside for there are three what look how this goes let me let me finish that verse it's kind of like you know somebody taking away the plate and there's still a a morsel of cake there it is the spirit that beareth witness notice who beareth witness the spirit because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost three that bear record in heaven and these three are one not one like this like this it's three attributes of the same god amen thank you lord you're like brother drake you are a son to your father and your mother then you get married you become a husband then here you have children you have little draken that a little one that's that's on the way but what's your name your name is not husband your name is not son your name is not father your name is drake savage you are the same person manifesting in three different offices are you with me that's the revelation of jesus christ it was god become flesh the father who was above us he now came on and he created a body that he himself could come and dwell in a blood that he could pay the price that you and i could have confidence and say i repent of my sins i believe in the justification of god he had raised from the grave [Applause] and then the holy ghost who's the holy ghost the same god who came down amen that's why we don't baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost yet we do the name of what's his name jesus the lord jesus christ all right there's a lot of husbands here a lot of fathers here a lot of sons here but there's only one brian hannah at least here tonight these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth notice in earth these bear witness the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one notice it didn't say they are one they agree in one this is the sovereign working of god to bring a life unto himself to cleanse that life and to place his life in us is that all right see that unclean spirit when it goes out this is where brother brown is as he's laboring by the spirit of god he says what you find is this where it comes to place its intellectual conception now once you remember intellect just does not mean that a person is smart and that they're dry and formal no no no no intellect is a mind mind is connected to your spirit they can be dry and formal or they can be emotional are you with me that's that's the spirit realm are you with me that's a spirit realm this is why the prophet was letting us know it's not just emotion do we believe in shouting the church said amen do we believe in speaking in tongues do we believe in running jumping yeah amen we believe in all of that but we want to make sure what it is there's got to be a life that after all the emotion is done there's a life that is present outside of church [Music] you see these are the precious parts that which belongs to us as a children of god see brother brown would take this in the message future home because remember this earth is a redeemable attribute of god the earth is groaning and travailing the earth prior to the fall in eden the earth was under the control of a son and daughter of god there was no fear there was no sin and the earth was bringing forth in its beauty it was bringing forth was no death but then after the fall come god said this earth will bring forth thorns and thistles unto you you will you will labor by the sweat of your brown before that time it was not the sweat of the brah did adam have to tend to things yes did he have to lay was he labor yeah but not according to how we think laboring how was he laboring by the word by the word the same way it comes to you and i right now where there's things the holy spirit deals with in our life how we labor by the word yes lord be it unto me and we're depending on the transforming power that's in the word so the earth is groaning paul writes right the bible talks in genesis 6 the earth was filled with violence and god anoints a man by the name of noah noah being a prophet he was able to see paul said in hebrews 11 he was able to see the judgment that was coming but as he saw god showed him the judgment within that judgment god spoke mercy prepare an ark for the saving of your household and what did moses want to know preach peter picks it up he preached repentance repent repent and what happened here come the waters it wasn't just rain coming down the bible said the fountains of the deep were broke up they were walking and men were walking all around despising noah's message and they failed to recognize the earth standing in and out of water they failed to recognize that they were walking right there judgment was right there and what did god do he baptized the earth the waters covered the face of the earth this is why we don't sprinkle it's a complete submersion not just because of the earth that that water baptism is a testimony we're not even leaving out the nose of the individual it is a going into a grave what are we doing burying you don't bury live people you don't bury live people you bury dead people is that right you bury dead people and when they're baptized they are showing a clear conscience they are showing a work is taking place inside of their life they are heeding to the calling of the holy spirit buried in his likeness buried in his likeness he was buried in the grave but then he was raised in the newness of life amen you see the the walking into the waters of baptism the water doesn't change anybody well what is it it's this it's it's a declaring you're taking upon his name i'm identifying with his name i have repented of my sins and i believe i am forgiven these are tied together repentance and baptism see this is why in the heart let me finish this point and then i'll close this is why in the heart a inside the human heart a person they can come and they repent they repent and they can repent of their sin they're convicted by the holy spirit like it was on the day of pentecost they were convicted listen this is why if preaching alone won't do it it takes the holy ghost to bring conviction the holy ghost brings conviction to hearts and when that repentance notice what takes place when that repentance comes forth and they say lord forgive me have mercy upon me lord jesus i i repent of my sin you don't have to go through and name everything because remember behold the lamb of god it takes away the sin of the world all the other things are attributes but you have to say lord forgive me i'm a sinner lord i repent of my wrong lord i want you to be my lord and savior of my life you've got to make a stand upon it not just walk around with it and look let me just tell you something don't look at it and say i don't know if i can do it or not you listen it's not you that has brought you to even a place to consider this it is the working the sovereign working of the holy ghost what should i do let go and let god have his way amen once that forgiveness you see the forgiven but the snake it's still there in that heart what's a snake it's that old sinful nature it's what made you do it it's like you go around pulling pulling weeds out of a flower bed you know how it is if you don't get the root you better watch it it's going to come right back because you snapped it off when you listen to me now all of us been there i try to get the roots out sometimes i can't get them out do you go get a tool and get them out when it comes to spiritual things i want a tool but sometimes i get a little lazy in the natural and say now i'll go back and get it next time next few days with a cup of coffee around i'll get it but by saying i'm looking because you know why i know look right there because there's a root ball going with the surface but when i snap it off it looks pretty nice man that brown mulch and there ain't no dandelion sticking up there ain't no clover growing in it man it looks real nice but there's still roots there that's right oh hell it looks wonderful when a heart has come to the lord and they've repented of their sins that's tremendous that's a wonderful thing it's a wonderful thing when a person actually feels the load of sin lifted from their life they've repented you say what is that that's a supernatural experience of divine grace in justification then you can you can begin to walk up to walk up to him and walk up before him you've got some confidence in his working amen you felt that load what you feel is the load he already bore away you you're feeling what he already took and dropped in the lowest hell that's what you're experiencing so that snake is still there that root you're forgiven of your sins but the forgiveness of sins doesn't take away the snake it's still there that's the root of evil this is where repentance and baptism in the name of jesus christ he forgives our sins now then comes sanctification brother brown just simply puts it in this way it's the setting of our mind in order for holiness to think right holiness dress and it's not just dress it's actions he deals with lust he deals with malice he deals with envy he deals with ev why it's the spirit of truth bringing us in to the truth who is the truth not a doctrine not a church jesus said i am the way the truth and the life so it sets our mind in order for holiness you begin to think about the things that's going on oh i shouldn't do this oh i shouldn't do that well i shouldn't do this what is it sanctification working it's setting our mind this is the bible well i want to see more of god the bible says without holiness no man shall see god you want you want to see more of god become the way of holiness the bible says in the book of isaiah there will be a highway not a highway like this out here this is two-way traffic right there is not a two-way traffic when you were going to heaven it's a one-way amendment with me the bible said there will be a highway and it goes on to say there will be a way in the middle of the highway it shall be called the way of holiness when is it it's god his creation amen it's him working and you're walking you're walking you're walking you're walking walking in the way god's dealing with your life your mind your heart all of it's set there within sanctification and god is moving the things out of your life now i want you to understand this i have to pause your moment these parts there is no time frame such as this takes place this day or this month then you gotta wait for another month then you gotta no no no this can take place all at once even before a person walks into the water baptism in the book of acts there were those when peter spoke at the house of cornelius they were full filled with the holy ghost then they walked into the waters of baptism same thing in acts 19 when paul went through the upper coast of ephesus is that right you see it's not a time limit or a time frame but i want to just i i need just a few more moments because within it here it's setting our mind in order for holiness it's where you become aware of things maybe it's as i said i'm just trying to be very simple as god is bringing it here nothing we want to be deep anyhow we want it to be simple where you can put it in your lunch box and pack it with you but it's things that god brings to your attention it can it can be things addressed it deals with malice envy strife and all these other things is god dealing with a life to lay this aside lay this aside lay this aside it's god working and preparing and i want you to just take this as well he's working with your life you're not alone but saying i'm not in church you're not alone he's working with your life with a new heart a new spirit he's working then the next thing that comes is the baptism of fire and holy ghost it's the fire of god cleansing our hearts from sin and puts the holy ghost inside us then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us so it's not when the holy ghost has come it's not a struggle to live a christian life it moves from a mind of holiness it moves from the intellectual to the subconscious are you with me it's just like right now you get in the car you don't have to think about i mean unless you get a new car and you gotta but even driving even in your house you can walk around in the dark do you have to work look and say oh let me see how much is the step here well let me see when you go to somebody else's house i could say hey hey watch the step the first one's a little higher than the others i have to tell you that because you've never been there right but if you live there long enough you get used to it you don't even have to think about it you just make adjustments as things come amen [Applause] and i will put my spirit within you and calls you to walk in my statues i'm closing okay i'm closing because i i want i i just i want this just to just to settle out right here i will put my spirit within you so he's given us a new heart a new spirit took away the stony heart of the flesh the stony heart does this i don't want nothing to do with this how much longer is this going to be but a new heart and a new spirit it becomes open to the things of god right right it becomes open to the things of god but a new spirit is not the holy spirit but it is a work of it amen remember a new spirit it comes into a place and pressures can come you believe what what is it you believe well you know i mean my church teaches an hour to wear dresses new spirit my church believes we ought to have long hair new spirit all right because when you really get the holy spirit it ain't that you got to know where it's at in the word but you can just let them know i found a treasure amen i found something that's so much greater than cutting my a hair can say i found so much something so much greater than lust and pornography and all running around and all that i found something so much greater what do you mean you don't drink no more no you know the surgeon general and the cdc said this week that uh that whoever would drink a little bit uh it would could really damage their liver new spirit but when you really look i'm not trying to pin things down on evidences what the whole thing that i'm we're trying to bring within that is that your focus is on him who is occupying your life you're not ashamed of him it don't mean that you got the bible out and you can tell them this is exactly right here go to chapter so and so go to this right here no no no it ain't about you having a bible study it's about your life being a study that reflects the bible let's plan and then i'll share a few more things you see this is where i want you to see this just for more it's very important i want you to hear this he says and i'll cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them this is not and once you stand calls you it doesn't mean brother trevor it doesn't mean he's putting you in a headlock and saying come on you gotta do this you say oh lord oh lord oh i better do this if i don't do this let the lord he'll get me i might go to hell no no that's not what this is he's talking about i will come in you and i will live my life through you that's what his promise is see this is this is his focus this is what he desires for us and let me let me say this here i'm wrapping it up this when a person stops and they stop i don't need to do all that i don't need to do this you know people tell you well what's brother saying they're talking about i love god you can love him with your human spirit but that ain't the love of god when you love god it's from your soul and it's because the love of god is in you it's not you loving god it's the love of god in you loving him that's how you're able to pray for those who despitefully use you that's how you're able to love those who hate you why it's not our human level failed let's just be honest our human love says you did me wrong but agape love doesn't mean i'm going to go out and have lunch but agape love says that's my brother my sister or agape love can say you know what that man or that woman they're a sinner like i was right see that's one element right now it's gone from the world they have everything right now that's going on people are drawing lines don't you cross my line don't you do this don't you do that but are you ain't doing this and better you ain't doing that that's the spirit of the world but the real spirit of god on the inside i don't mean that some of us remember many times listen friends sometimes they're a trap or whatever you can fall in but i want you to understand this right here what it comes down to is that agape love is so much higher than filial agape love can pray for that man's soul to know or that woman is because it knows they're shackled they're bound that boss that would run you down that family member that would run you down it doesn't mean that feeling of love you're like oh oh i just i just love being around are you kidding you don't love being around that don't be hypocritical with it let agape rain the bible says live peaceably with as much that life within you so that tells me you need to have discernment there's just some people you don't need to be sitting at the lunch table with [Music] they're big mouths and everything else arrogant indifferent and so forth you what's what's the best thing well but at the same time i'm not really being a christian no you're being a christian you're using real wisdom that's what you're doing you don't have to clown for the devil you don't have to prove anything you can be away from the person but if in your heart you say lord help that man help that woman maybe they had a bad day maybe there's something going on maybe there's things in their life you see it becomes a new heart and a new spirit it becomes an impersonation and each of us know that in term impersonation [Music] you could try to impersonate me to try to impersonate somebody else when you try to impersonate you're not being yourself an impersonation listen with a new heart and a new spirit a person is trying to live the christian life and if they stop right there and say well i can do this i can do it i can do this you know what it is it's a new heart and a new spirit and they're impersonating everything that they do every walk every move they make you might say wow there's t's crossed eyes dotted wow this but if it's not here it's an impersonation god comes with a new spirit a new heart and then he puts his spirit on the inside then it's no longer an impersonation [Music] let me just say this i'm saying this to those on the internet and everybody and i hope if somebody's walking around their house right now and you think this is a time to get up for a drink i hope it's a time that the spirit of god brings conviction to your heart so that you understand it's not enough to walk around and say well i don't understand everything i don't know i don't understand that's a cop-out that's an excuse what i'm preaching right now and what i always have preached the whole time where god the very first message i ever preached august 1st 1996 first message god's witness you remember that brother bill god's witness went through elijah elisha acts 2 was talking about the life having the life the message is not about doctrines you can know all the feasts know all the seals know all of that and don't know him it's him it's a life it is to lead us into a union with jesus christ that's what it's about it's not don't allow the devil to make it complicated so if in your heart you can say i don't understand all this i don't understand all that just say lord reveal yourself to me make yourself available say god i want more than what i've got right now [Music] i know i'm preaching to hearts that'll pass from death unto life i know i preach in the hearts that that they have a full work in their life and i also know i'm preaching to hearts whether as here on the internet the archive i know that that i'm preaching the hearts that have stopped at a new spirit but i'm not angry with you god's not angry he's not trying to humiliate he's trying to uncover where satan is trying to keep you away from the real treasure that god is calling you to [Music] this this is where when it moves from a new heart and a new spirit where his spirit comes in and i'll leave you with this tonight this is where it no longer is you trying to live a christian life it's no longer you by intellect no i shouldn't do this or i should do that now listen there's parts of things as you come to it god makes you aware of certain things in his word but the intellect i'm talking about is where you're not looking around is so and so here oh paul's here oh i i gotta i gotta pause here so i i can't talk about the boss that way no no this is where it's not you having to be intellectually i gotta take a hold of this i can't do it no no it's where it becomes subconscious you don't have to think about it you know i think about it should i wear this should i wear it you don't think about it because it's his life and listen he is the word i i can't go into this tonight but you see he is the word it can't be a spirit-filled life and not walking in the word [Music] god has given grace for those who lived in overlapping times you understand but god a life that'll walk into the word it doesn't mean that we understand everything it's not what it is it's a life it's a life it's his life you love him tonight i took more than just a few moments i apologize but then again i don't apologize [Music] this is life this is life this is a needful it's a placing of his spirit this is the experience of the new birth it's a passing from death onto life and the love of the world has died within you lord willing we'll get into this a little bit more next week coming into that part where his spirit is there dwelling in you let's just pray if you'd like to be remembered in prayer just lift up your hand most importantly your heart before god he knows your need whatever the need might be god bless you lord jesus only you can come in the midst of a gathering of people and take a little lad's lunch and feed and minister to every need lord you're working in all parts you're encouraging us faith is is being built lord being strengthened

holy spirit has made them aware it's it's grace that is coming to them to let them know bring conviction in their heart to let let them know of things but now lord they stand upon your brooding your sovereign working and say lord i lay it down in the name of jesus christ not in the name of samuel browning or their own name not their own strength they lay it down in the name of jesus christ lord let it be a witness and a testimony of your working that'll further build faith in their life that which comes to their mind and their heart right now may they just in that way appropriate the blood and apply it and let it be a testimony and experience lord of divine grace working in their life oh god that builds faith lord in the promise where you are calling them into a full union with yourself [Music] granted lord we pray in the name of jesus christ may you feel every vessel lord those streaming those that are archived those that are here if there's any heart lord where a hand was lifted up
