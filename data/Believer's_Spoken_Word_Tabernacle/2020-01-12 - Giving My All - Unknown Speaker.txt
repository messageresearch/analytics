read the history on this song right here well let me just share it with you it really was inspiring to my heart just some months ago and there was a black black brother way back in this was in the leave right now at the beginning of the 1900s here and they wanted to the council wanted to present a Trinitarian belief and this black Minister locked himself away from this particular council that was going on and he locked himself in his room and he prayed and fasted he said I will not compromise on the Godhead now you look at the inspiration that was coming being poured out in this hour and the inspiration struck and he walked right to the platform out of that office on a Sunday morning and begin to sing that song as it came to him God it was declaring declaring it's the evening time it's evening time everything itself must declare Amen and in this time and then to think how that got profit in this hour reaches back and he pulls that song up and he says right here where we were at it shall be light in the evening time what was a promise is now a reality amen we're living in that hour amen when what was promises are now the reality amen we just thank God for His mercy this morning and it's so good to be here with you we want to lift the mission offering this morning and you just give us unto the Lord as the brothers will come and then we will go right into the word I just certainly ask we'll pray over the word as well and I just ask you to be in prayer for me as well I thank you for your prayers I am feeling I'm feeling better little by little and I just so appreciate the Lord amen don't you love him this morning Amen he sure is he's so good to us amen let's just bow our hearts in his presence Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege and an honor it is to be able to call you our Father and Lord by revelation Lord to see God you're working in our lives and Lord that we are your sons and daughters Lord has you you come Lord in our midst that you're changing our lives father we thank you for your mercy Lord Lord as we come this morning Lord into this part of the service Lord as we lift this mission offering lifted is unto the Lord your God to just a place it Lord into your hands Lord Lord to freely give and just Lord ask that God that you would take and multiply and Lord father we know that we're asking in your will we see God how that you have multiplied time and time again Lord Lord you see the needs Lord God among your people Lord I Lord you know my heart Lord I brothers that Lord that just Lord that I get Lord the different requests that come in and these aren't brothers that request a lot of things Lord there's things that I wouldn't even know about Lord unless they would tell me but Lord you see these different needs there's no way in the world that as there's no way as an assembly that we could meet every need and that's not what you've called for but you've asked us Lord to give unto you as unto the Lord and you would take it Lord multiply it and directed God to the youths Lord Lord we may never meet some of the different saints of God upon this lifetime but I think Lord how that Paul would be Lord moved by the Spirit of God and he would admonish those on in Corinth he would admonished some of the different churches Lord among the Gentiles and how that they the Lord would give Lord when Jerusalem when the Saints in Jerusalem were Lord under siege and under pressure Lord yet father there was a need that was there Lord you're still Jehovah Jireh you're the one providing for yourself Lord and we just dear God just desire that you just Lord bless the worshiper Lord now as they would Lord give may you take it and use it Lord for the glory of God Lord as we look into the word this morning Lord we want to give ourselves we've come here Lord I don't believe there's one person that's in this building this morning that has come here just to be seen we've not come your Lord just to fulfill a duty because it's Sunday we've come here this morning to hear from you lord we've got needs in our lives lord will you come and speak to our hearts speak to every life that's gathered here this morning Lord may you just walk up and down the aisles Lord just deal with every heart according to your tender mercy father dear God every one of our hearts may and Lord be drawn closer to you Lord when we would leave from this building should you tarry may we Lord leave as people that have been changed being changed Lord from glory unto glory may you save Lord every soul there's one that doesn't know your Lord will you just woo them to yourself this morning Lord harder life Oh God doesn't know you and the power of the Resurrection may you just move Lord up next to that heart that was so drawn Lord into that place Lord of complete surrender and take us Lord as Speaker and here together and may you receive glory come heal the sick Lord among us Lord there's many Lord that are sick some that are not able to be your father and we ask that God that the angel of the Lord will just move Lord for every single need Lord let it be another testimony of your love and care Lord we ask it Lord all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen don't you love him a man we certainly want to welcome the visitors this morning may God bless you some of you that are regulars but you're visiting I mean your God bless you as well it's good to see CH and every one of you and and just as it's it's it's so good to feel good and I know sickness it's not just been here but I know that it's been throughout and so we just we thank God for His mercy we want to look into the word of the Lord thank you musicians we want to look in the word of the Lord in Hebrews chapter 11 how many of you just enjoyed the services last week here amen I tell you I thought that I first I thought that was about the best communion service i've ever been in you say brother Samuel you you say them kind of things aren't well you know it don't get worse he gets better it gets better and you know what what becomes better about it it's because it becomes more personal becomes more real to us we see the grace of God working in our life amen just as you just pray with pray for me this morning as we look at this that God will just help me to deliver what he's put on my heart in Hebrews 11 only gonna read three verses of Scripture and then we will let you be seated in Hebrews 11 verse 17 it says by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called verse 19 accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure Amen may God bless his word and bless you as you're being seated this morning I wanted to go straight into that verse of scripture we've as you've been here or you've been catching up on the services even from the subject that we've been looking at out of numbers 15 we realize that God has ministered to us brought to us and called us into a land of promise when God gives when God sends a message the message itself when it's received it doesn't leave a person in the condition that they were when they heard it but it brings and it calls us out remember when God remember there's many compound every every scripture there's compound promises there where it would say out of Egypt I have called my son when God made himself known to Moses you recall that God said this is what I want you to go tell Pharaoh I want you to tell Pharaoh to let my son go Israel even mine firstborn that he may serve me and if you don't let him go I will kill your son God sent a word that would bring Israel out of bondage and bring them from bondage into a land flowing with milk and honey it was all God listen God made the promise God unfolded the promise to his chosen vessel his messenger his prophet God unfolded that moved Moses into that place in that time then as God unfolds that then God takes his prophet down here into Egypt the word is given blood is applied and here is a people that comes out under the blood and are brought into a place where they come into the fullness of the promised the wilderness and I know that these are things that for the most part of us we would understand that the wilderness just to come out of Egypt was not the goal of the promise that was part of it like in this hour there was a scriptural promise because you realized the Bible is not loosely just fitted happenings but it all speaks of one goal it's all unfolding of God's great purpose these are not stories that we look back on it's all the unfolding of God's one great purpose that God himself might fully live in his people and through the reclaiming of that where he fully lives in his people then to restore back this earth into its Eden Eden it condition of where from where it fell from because we understand that what we see when Jesus would say he says we are in this world but we are not of this world I'm in it but I'm not of it we realized that the earth in the world it's two different things the earth itself is his this of that planet of that of God's word that he spoke but the world is the system that entered in upon the earth it's just like in our lives our lives went through because of the fall we came in by under this first birth and this is why Jesus says you must be born again because there must come a change of the system within our lives and God did not entrust that to you or I to say will you change yourself we can't change ourselves we can't earn new leaves and we can try to do this better and do this better but it has to come a change on the inside and that change itself it has to come by a super natural birth a relationship with Jesus Christ that the scripture is true in the book of James it says draw nigh to God and He will draw 9 to you submit yourselves under the mighty hand of God it speaks to you and I in this hour that God's desire is never to override our will but God desires that our will would be surrendered to his will and then it becomes him operating by His Word in our lives to bring forth according to what he spoke which is according to what he thought it becomes a reflection of his own self that in it that in itself when we we we think of these things that how that God would call a life and God works on our life God molds our life he's shaping our life and let me just say it in this manner there there is something that when we as we said drawing close to the Lord that when God is dealing with a heart in any of our hearts no matter where you are at in your journey with the Lord I think it ought to be something that should be so of a declaration from our heart is Lord when you speak to me Lord I will obey like David woods would say Lord incline my heart Lord to fear thy name he would ask God incline my heart my incline means to give or to give towards or to do to move in that direction Lord you deal with my heart to be moved in that way and friends in this hour that we live in this is an age and I think we can all agree with it it is an age of such hardness it is an age that when we look at it and we see there is many troublesome things going on we we see the uncertainty even of things that we've come through in this past week where here's another war gonna break out or is this gonna break out we have the reality where the Spirit of God tells us when we begin to see all of these things which now love that is part of prophecy it's part of Scripture there is wars and rumors of wars all of those things are part of prophecy it's a maturing of time that we're living in but yet for the believer we can see those things but our focus is to be on the Lord and the promise to know as we see these things coming to pass lift up your head for your Redemption draweth 9 is to speak of where our focus is to be within this hour and we are bombarded and Satan's objective is to try to take our focus from what the real thing we ought to be focused on how many times that were the enemy suddenly suddenly has taken the focus and he's moved it away from the reality of Jesus Christ coming present in the heart and life as many could say you know I think we could say do you believe that God is in his and in his universe amen I believe that God is in his universe I I see God in creation do you believe that God was in Christ a man I believe that God was in Christ but we've got to come on down do you believe that that same God is in you it has to come down to that place that all of this God he wrote his first Bible in the heavens the Bible said in the Book of Psalms look we as you look not only in Psalms but in Micah and other places the stars themselves even the constellations they speak of God's great plan and it speaks even of our life where David could write in the Psalms that quino's every star by name you and I can look out at that the sky on a clear night and how beautiful it is to see the stars but I want you to look at it sometimes it seems like just a a massive amount you see this time you say well this one looks like this and it looks like this without without a telescope this one looks like this and this one looks like this but yet to think our Heavenly Father he knows every one of those stars by name he has set them there where they are by his own decree and every one of them in their own position as they're part of a of a constellation they are part of that great body it is it is a declaring of the very handiwork of Almighty God now to think that we don't want to just leave it in the stars but we bring it down to our life to realize that if God knows every one of those stars by name the scripture said that even the very hairs of our head are numbered he knows every part of our life David said in Psalms 139 he said how precious are thy thoughts toward me thou knowest my Uprising and my down sitting David said even before my members were formed before I was ever here in a body of flesh my name was written within your book and this is where David's strength is being drawn from is that God you have always known me but here is God unfolding to you and I that reality I've always known you you've always been with me you might say why would that be the significance because look at the look at the the burden of the holy spirit that would continue to make known in Abraham's life and if I could for a moment move to that of where Paul coming under the unction of the Holy Spirit Paul would write of the choosing of Almighty God he would write of that election of God he would write of how that God before Jacob or Esau was even formed he said Jacob I loved and Esau have I hated see it when the Bible says before anyone either one of them did any works why God already saw what was there within their life it's like you taking an orange seed or an apple seed and you plant them planting them does not make it an orange seed nor make it an apple seed but planting them only puts them into a place to where they can now begin to e grow and express the germ of life that was already inside of that seed and as that germ comes forth it begins to declare that it what it was all the time all the leaves all the fruit everything comes out of it as it dwells in the light and in the moisture it releases the mystery that's in that seed that seed can look so ugly there's nobody that I don't think anybody even myself being one who really enjoys gardening and things you know really you look at a seed and if you say mine this seat is beautiful or you take a beginning of a plant you're not you're not taking of how it looks now and says it's beautiful what you're looking at and you express that is what you know the potential that lace was in there well it should a think of it like this how could you and I know the potential that is given to us in this hour has sons and daughters of God if God had not demonstrated it once again in this hour we would not know the expectation that we are called to it would be left up to the focus of where just belonging to a church and so we we we we we subscribe to to this denomination or we subscribe to this so we go along according to their tenants but we realized by the grace of God we are not called to the tenants of a man that's not the focus in the hour but all along the churches have got the focus off of Jesus Christ and it's become old programs I've just got to say it too we're a church has become a business it's become a business of trying to you know patch up people's problems that's not what the Church of the Living God is about the what a poor excuse if I'm here to try to patch up problems we got trouble but there is one hallelujah that's why the claw would say looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith hallelujah he would catch up in Isaiah's vision in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of peace are my peace was upon him hallelujah peace was taken from him that we might have his peace I'd say thanks be to God there's a call within our hearts I I trust that for every one of us that his God would speak to us this morning I trust that there is something that resonates in our hearts that says Lord there's more for me there's more for me it's what I want to speak to you and we're looking at this offerings in the land of our habitation that giving my all giving my all you know one of the things that can actually hold a person back from giving them that they're giving their all it isn't that they don't believe that the word is the truth they can even look at the message that God has sent to us in this hour and say it's absolutely the truth I know I've been there it's the truth nobody's gonna take that from me but it's got to come to where you see you're a part of it when you see that you're a part of it then that itself dissolves the lack of sincerity the prophet saw this when he he opens up to preach the message of Paul a prisoner and he deals he's just dealing with the people talking with them and saying this lack of sincerity and he goes into so where the lack of sincerity it comes down because everything itself is made to be way up here we we look at men in the scriptures and yet in the scriptures we are admonished not to put men on pedestals as far as that they're not flesh and blood we're and Mohnish Paul had to deal with that Paul had to bring the church in line when they wanted to fall down and worship Him he said no we are men just like you but worship the Lord God will take the agency of man that is surrendered to him to declare himself to every generation and you realize you can only serve God as you receive the servants whom he sins are you ask me Jesus said when they asked a question what must we do that we might work the works of God what did he say he said the works of God is to believe on Him whom he had sent that's the work of God why why would Elijah in 1st Kings chapter 17 thinking of inspiration that was dropping on Thursday night why would it Elijah stand there and he would pray when he's he's looking to God and the fires gonna fall you know Elijah didn't wonder if that was going to happen Elijah was not up on Mount Carmel just doing things to be doing it he comes to the end he said let it be known I've done all this according to thy word what was that for what was that vindication what was the prayer let him know that that servant why because God has a mouthpiece amen God has a way that he leads you and I he leads us by his word by his spirit but it's not something that's loose out here and it's left up just to you and I but God sends his servants with his word and it's the Spirit of Truth let me just say like this it's not the Prophet packing the message it's a living God packing the prophet with the message and that's the same way it comes down to you and I it's not me packing the message it's the Spirit of God inside of us that's packing this message it must be the Holy Ghost when Peter never went out of the Upper Room they didn't go out of their say well here we've got our message and Alan we've got our documents now the same God that was there walking with them and revealing himself to them and had come in order to bring redemption to bring the purchase that the life might come into them they walked out of that upper room yet look like the same Peter he looked like the same Andrew but on the inside behind that veil it was Christ veiled in Peter so much so you know the Bible says in the book of Acts that when they lock them up they came over there and the Bible said they knew they were ignorant and unlearned so let me tell you they steal other parts of their humanity skill was on display they were ignorant and learned but the Bible said they took knowledge they had been with Jesus what was it was it because they were wearing the same clothes or they had you know the same everything was just right he wasn't about the outward because if you get the inward right the outward will reflect itself you see what what had happened inwardly was reflecting outwardly it was the image of Christ that had moved into their lives so what was being reflected Jesus Christ remember when he came when he came to Paul Paul he's alive persecutest thou me is that right and he said I am Jesus light pillar fire this was not corporal body but he was declaring I'm that same God blood was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself he declaring in this time and in this end this moment I am that same Jesus that's why we we had truly been redeemed it's not a second person of a Godhead or a third person there's no such things as that it's attributes and officers of the same god unfolding or becoming to humanity becoming to humanity it's draw this is why that the Holy Ghost it's not you see that the whole I'm I just gotta go with this as it's coming this is Satan's objective even with the Trinity doctrine is to break the relationship where God dwells in his people because if he can divide it up to words father to where its son to where it's Holy Ghost you got three different people when he breaks that up then if you have the Holy Ghost you don't have a tie back to the father but the reality is is to know that the Holy Ghost it is the father it is the son Jesus was the body the tabernacle that the Lord pitched he had to come and redeem us how spirit listen God is a spirit and a spirit can't bleed and die but what happens here Almighty God provides for himself a body he's coming to do what Paul said he comes as the captain of our salvation to bring many sons hallelujah Oh I just trust the Lord help me to bring this as he just so dropped us in my heart let me read you this out of Victory Day before I go any further he said now friends the God that has raised us from the things of the world and the corruption of this earth can't he much more give us eternal life and put us in a land where there's no death see we look at these little trials and we think they are something well either nothing but little testing times then you realize that the prophets are not he's not being a smart aleck this is the scripture Romans 8 he says the sufferings of this present time it's not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us there's not one of us not one of us not one not one that would drive across the bridge I don't care if it's lost in Henderson now one of us or the bridge over here I can't remember the name on it bascule bridge there's not one of us would drive across a bridge unless it's been tested it's gotta be tested because when you get on that bridge you're taking your life into your hands it can be a beautiful structure but the question is no matter how beautiful it is will it hold up that's why the Holy Spirit through the Lord has showed us over and over again we don't walk by sight you walk by faith this is like John in the Book of Revelations when he looks upon the woman she is adorned with scarlet and my decked out with crosses and my's just he heat the Bible says he was in all but when the Spirit of God let him know this bridge won't get you there it was pulled back and he was showed in her is the blood of the prophets the blood of the martyrs she proclaiming to stand for truth but yet she was an enemy of truth it wasn't just about having the gospel book laying around she's against that reality of Christ himself being brought forth in his people and that's the earnest desire of every Christian its earnest desire of every married woman she wants her children to bear the image of the one in whom she is given - and that's where the true bride of Jesus Christ we don't want to reflect where a person said oh you must be this oh you must be that we don't want to reflect earthly images we want to reflect the image of Jesus Christ where someone can look at our life and said there's a Christian not because we walk out of this church but because of the indwelling of his presence hallelujah indwelling our lives we look at these little trials and we think they are something why they're nothing but little testing times look at this God tested Abraham but when he got his v-day victory is when he went up there in obedience to the word now we read about it in Hebrews 11 let's go to Genesis 22 if we could he got his v-day when he went up there in obedience to the word God tested Abraham the Bible says right here in verse 1 then it came to pass after these things i wish we could just preach on after these things after these things that God did tempt Abraham that word tempt is the word in that that we would know in the here I don't know how to pronounce in Hebrew but it's the word I say and to assay when you would go into a place and you're looking to see is there oil here or is there precious minerals here what is here beneath the surface because you know looking at the surface you just bypass the property and say yeah yeah sell it to you for $5,000 but somebody who comes in and they know what's beneath the surface there may be little little clues that would stand out up here that would actually begin to make known to them there's something great value beneath the surface it takes somebody who knows what's beneath the surface let me tell you something you could look in the mirror you could look at all your failures you can look at it all and say why in the world did he choose me he chose you because of what's beneath the surface why did he deal with my life he dealt with your life because of what he placed within you this is why the scriptures that is its grace by grace we are saved not of works lest any man should boast it's why we recognize it's God's grace that has come to us as Paul would say and we feel this way and was the cheapest of all sinners you would say brother Samuel I didn't do this and into that you may have done what would be thought of as zero acts of sin but when he comes I don't care if you never did anything that you would say was wrong but when he comes grace is given to your life and brother you realize that there is something greater that has touched your heart touched your life nothing we deserved it and may I capitalize upon that for every young person here you don't have to go in the world to know God's grace you can know what it is for a Living God to come down and change your very nature that's grace in this hour God did test Abraham when they are say I'm have you ever seen one of them big drill bits where they go down way deep in the earth you sitting on top you know you just stand on time you watch them sometimes on the oil rigs just standing there how long's it's gonna be a long time what are you doing we're taking a core sample we're going to we're going to get a sample of what's beneath the surface they pour that core sample up and there can be the different strata or the different layers that's broke down and each one of those layers tell a story let me tell you something there's a deeper story than all the scars and marks of sin you might have a lot of sin marks of fossils in your life and say I wish had have never done that wish I'd have never done that but let him go deeper there's a lot of old dinosaur bones and no doubt you're ashamed let him go deep that let me tell you something nobody else has this kind of equipment he has a patent on this one nobody can go to that depth that depth in your life and in my life to where you wonder how could it be am I one of them if this and he keeps going he keeps going he keeps calling what's he doing he is pulling out of your what he put within you but what about all the layers of my life I am pulling out what I know is there and he pulls it out and you know what he says yeah I knew I was there the whole time did you catch that he says I knew I was there the whole time God is a family we do not become sons and daughters we always were sons and daughters of God he's bringing weather later we're gonna say what I do yield drawn and to God how do I draw man to God let every thought that is contrary to it put it aside entertain his thoughts what he said to you Oh God lord help us this morning he called to Abraham and he said he said unto Him Abraham and he said Behold Here I am he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest Abraham had another son called ish man it was a Sun that was brought forth based on the will of flesh trying to bring to pass the will of God Paul deals with it in the book of Galatians we see it and look look to this day Isaac Israel is troubled with Ishmael Ishmael hates Isaac let me just tell you what that is that if when we you look in the scriptures you realize it's the spirit of Satan because if he could establish the Jews then he could stifle prophecy but he can't stop the Word of God one of these days I'm going to shake the hands of those who win in the gas chambers they're there under the altar are you with me when God reveals himself to the 144,000 brother man takes her like this he said when Joseph steps forward over there to make himself known to the 144,000 that is alive he said at that time it'll also break over on those souls that are under the altar and they will all recognize who Joseph really is you see what's happening it's a converging of dimensions amen that's what's in fact is happening upon our lives now it's that spirit of that land that is overtaking on our lives right now Oh glory be to God take that only son I want you to watch this listen to me God is not bringing up Abraham's past there's a lot that like we could preach what's in here this is why Paul said I have learned to forget those things which are behind me and I reach forward you know what this you know this was speaking of it wasn't that Oh Abraham was walking around and he was so beaten down in his mind because he thought about is from hell he thought about all the misunderstandings he thought about no no this word that was spoken here was declaring what had come to fruition in Abraham's life you understand that God is speaking what Abraham is coming to and the word when it's spoken will bring forth out of Abraham what is there just the previous chapter previous verses is where Ishmael has been put out of the camp this is why look at Abraham's life look how it unfolds first thing come out from that country in that kindred obedience the same wall you obey what he is telling you to do well saying I won't alone want to be right over there you can't get there by jumping you got to take one step at a time country and kindred next thing he had to separate from God you as the prophet goes through this and you know that's hard there's a part of Abraham family this would be real see this is where it comes down to for us to realize these were not these are the prophets of old they were men the Bible said it like this he said in Hebrews 1:1 that God spake to the father's by the prophets 2nd Peter chapter 2 said that the the the the prophecy came not in old times by the will of man even though they were looking for the coming of the Lord but yet they couldn't make a prophecy come to pass because it's not their word but then he would be taken with what God had made known to him it start with one little scripture it will start with one little word you see what God's wanting when he gives us a word is that that word would become preeminent in our lives it takes over in our lives in a little by little by little country and kindred not Ishmael but there's a final fold to this final fold what God now is going to test Abraham will you obey all my word but you know this obedience you know as well as I do that of our children or anyone you certainly would not we don't have a desire that our children would obey us because they're afraid of us because like I think how the saying goes if I get it right that when the cat's away the mouse will play we don't want it to be about fear we want it to be by love that's how God disciplines us is by love real correction is with a vision in mind discipline is not than the belt or the one of the time outer WA that the discipline is where the results of that becomes effectual in the life right this is why the scripture said that the rod drives the foolishness out of the heart see God deals with the heart because we could obey out here we could obey out here well if I don't do this if I don't do that I if I don't do that brother Sam is gonna preach on me if I don't do this you know he's going to start talking about being in the house of God it just changed something friends that's not the depth of this word this is about causing you and me to really reflect wait a minute where are my priorities that's not something you evaluate before you come to the altar it ought to be every day of our lives evaluation where is my priorities this is talking about giving our all it's not about oh if I don't want to go to hell this thing you don't have to go to hell nobody has to go to hell a pair of those that end up those that even are there you know what they didn't have to go there they have to go there but they ran roadblocks they ran blockades were men there a mom and dad was praying a pastor a minister or somebody was trying to tell us hey you need help you need the Lord oh just okay I got this I could do this you know not right now they keep putting it off putting it off and they run the roadblocks thank God for roadblocks I'll be honest I don't like them in the natural when I'm driving you come up on detour this but thank God in the spiritual for roadblocks take Isaac Vann only son the one whom thou lovest Haziq was not just a baby a second about this time was about a 15 year old boy he's come to a place now think about it Abraham is investing his life not just now since a it since Isaac has been here Abraham's decisions every decision he's made has been because of this this promise that's why he made the decision even when luck was hanging around what was it that brought Abraham from Egypt back into Palestine it's because the sovereignty of God was moving on his life and God seemed fit to it it might have been real comfortable down there and God said let me get that comfort out of here well it's hard down here get back to the land thank God that he pulls out all the nice fluffy straw because you know what you and I need that there's parts in our journey we've needed that are you with me God doesn't look down on it and say oh my you know haha I've had to do this and I've had to do that no sir no sir he's working it out all the time he's getting Abraham into position for Abraham to see you need to separate from lot Abraham would have to die to that thought maybe I could make a believer out alot maybe I can do this and maybe I could do that and maybe I could do this and maybe I can do that come on now Abraham out of heart are you with me it shows Clare over in Genesis 18 when the Lord had come down in a body of flesh and made himself known before that tent door after he left out of there he said shall I hide from Abraham those things which do judgment was coming upon Sodom judgment you know that promise is the scripture for this hour Luke 17 30 even that shall it be when the Son of Man is revealed the son of man would be Jesus Christ as their rights revealing in what how was he before the tenth door it was there in a prophetic message that's the promise of the scripture to do what turn the hearts turn the hearts who's going to turn the arts not man God turns the heart God feels with the heart and here is Isaac fifteen-year-old boy Abraham's life has invested here every decision he's made there's been decisions that's come up and let's just look we can look at Abraham's life but let's bring it personal there's decisions that Abraham has made that he said I've suffered for that way I made the wrong one right there I reasoned that out and I suffered for that one but he's learning he's growing by the time he gets to this spot where he's that right here Abraham there has been a growth in his life yeah he's made mistakes he's made some decisions that would display the humanity but you know what God allowed that humanity to be displayed so that you and I would have confidence not in our own flesh but have confidence in the excellency of the power of God that is within these earthen fragile frail vessels that he might receive the glory because he said I will share my glory with no man hallelujah and they try to bring this to a point here God brings this to Abraham you can read I'll just let me just go through the scripture here and preach it he lets Abraham know it's evident by the scriptures that follow after this he's let him know get up to Mount Moriah and there's a place there I want you to get it's evident when you read further scriptures Abraham knew when it was time to stop and a sinned he had a promise that would allow him to ascend he knew because you know what the word was not just word to him the word was a vision so he would know as the Bible would go on to say he came there he saw the place afar off he kept walking towards it you see obedience it had already begun it was already there in Abraham's heart but God wanted that obedience to be displayed so the Bible says Abraham got up early in the morning but Mathew the Bible said he clave the wood this wasn't something that was easy like he already had he had to take and chop the wood he was chopping the wood to take up there for the sacrifice you know what that says you might say Lord what do I have to offer he provides what you need to bring well I'm gonna go out and become this person no no no no no no it's right there it's right there it's right there it's right there it's right there I don't know if he got blisters I don't know I don't know but I know one thing he got the wood was that wood he loaded up the Beast and they took fire did you catch that in the scripture they took fire with them they were not gonna Kindle fire on the mountain they were taking fire with them let me tell you something you're not gonna get fired but there is fire in your this whole array it keeps the quickening power keeps quickening quickening quickening quickening quickening the promises to our lives as I guess the question papa daddy look what reverence I'm asking you breach of family service either what reverence he knew the order of sacrifice Oh God he knew the order of sacrifice he knew what it meant sacrificing said Papa we've got the wood we've got the flyer the where's the lamb for the burnt offering where's it at and Abraham that word Abraham even through all his failures he had become so wrapped in that word till he lost thought of his own failures his own humanity his own abilities he becomes so ever he's so wrapped in the word till he speaks as god deity is speaking in this hour well where's the sacrifice my son God will provide for himself a sacrifice well listen Abraham was a yielded a yielded vessel he cut you know an Abraham had come to this is real maturity you know real maturity is realizing I can do nothing of myself here's Abraham he's on the would build Z ultra puts the wood he binds Isaac this was all remember it's all a type of Calvary but what was Calvary a type of because remember Isaac Genesis 22 he carried Abraham didn't carry the wood Isaac carried the wood Jesus carried the cross but remember remember before he ever went to the cross the victory was already won in Gethsemane the surrender of will before Abraham ever asked the camp he already had overcome wow how can you say overcome because he had overcome his own will thoughts that were badgering his man what's gonna happen if Sarah finds out about this you better not wake her up come on you know how brother branham dramatized that you better wake her up you see Sarah Muraki proven who Sarah was carted over this child of promise I've waited on this promise son for a long time we've been waiting on this promise of the coming of the Lord for a long time I'm not gonna let nothing hinder it no shucks no son of the bondwoman knows her separate me not going to let brothers you understand that there's certain things you tell you my boy so you tell your boy this just between me and you you tell your mama and they happen it again if you tell her that's on you and her then I'm I'm not getting in the way you're gonna get it you bet I ain't getting away you know I'm talking I don't see my boys know that little bit of confession honey good for the soul in there truth is brother and I know that I'm gonna get it too Sara would say wonder what are you doing but see he didn't look at this consideration the word brings consideration doesn't say bless God this is what God has told me to do and I'm gonna go do it Philippians 2 said look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus it breeds consideration he was considerate that Sara wouldn't understand this she wish you wouldn't understand this right now but this was something personal with Abraham and here they come into this place here is Isaac laid down it's an obedience he's not fighting Oh what an atmosphere what an atmosphere that token brings to the home the wonder the Prophet would say he said you apply that token and with love and consideration he said you apply that took it and said Lord I'm going to talk to that that son or that daughter or that loved one he said create an atmosphere you would have said create an atmosphere he said to where it'll be an atmosphere said they'll just fall into it let me just tell you something this ain't words of a man this ain't Theory I'm a product of this message I know it works and I know the reality of the power of what the word means come on now I'm talking to you talking to you and me both the power of what the word means in alive and in a home it creates an atmosphere Satan know he's wanting to fight that atmosphere Isak submits himself and here Abraham the Bible said he took the knife he reared back and about that time the Lord spoke out of heaven Abraham Abraham said Here I am look what he's saying Here I am I'm right what you've showed me to do I'm standing right here I'm walking in the light if you're in the light Here I am that's what God wants to hear out of our lives when he calls our name don't stay silencing Here I am you might say brother Samuel he's calling me I'm not a no I'm not in a state or situation I'm very proud of he's not looking at your state or situation respond to the word and say Here I am hey and here Abraham said Abraham stay your hand and the Bible says as Abraham stayed his hand God let him know he said because thou hath not withheld than only son the one whom thou lovest when God told him to stay his hand the Bible said Abraham looked behind him and there was a ram caught in the thicket answer me this question how did that Ram get there that Ram wasn't there before how did that Ram get there Jehovah Jireh how did God become a man God provided for himself a body and when he turned to see that Ram remember what Ram speaks of in the offerings it's one of the offerings were reading about in numbers 15 it speaks of one its substitutionary one that stands in our stead Helena there's water standing in our stead let me just tell you something it's not way out here but Peter would let it be known it's the hidden man of the heart that Ram was caught in the thicket it couldn't get out God became became fresh and the words of the Lord and they just come down here come to this point it comes to the place where God look at the words that ring out in verse 12 I want to read these words Genesis 22 12 lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God did not God know this before God knew it but God wanted to see it become fresh this is where Paul could write in Romans 4 and speak of Abraham was justified before God without works James picks it up and says faith alone is dead there must be works and not works that are generated by us the works are because of the eyes have been anointed in faith every one of us want to please God the Bible says without faith it's impossible to please God this is where it falls deeper that the depth falls into our lives God just did not save me for me to come to church church to keep you in fellowship as you heat to the word there'll be Milvian the word will come that brings maturing by by us dying and surrendering brings encouragement but God did not save us just for us to come to church it's deeper that he might live in side of us and remember it's not just about this life we are living for his coming Abraham took the Romney offered it up the Bible says in Genesis 15 I'm coming in the angel of the Lord called him to Abraham out of heaven the second time it said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and is not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I'll multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in that seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice Abraham it will tell you read it in the scripture he told them who they were riding upon the asses he said you stay here I am the lad will go yonder and worship and come again God has asked him to offer up Isaac but Abraham speaks if he's offered up God will raise him up because the promises are there in him in Christ every promise is yay and a man has a right but Paul said in second Corinthians 1:30 he hath made him to be unto us sanctification redemption perfection that he might receive glory how familiar I and the lad will go yonder and worship wonder we could have stopped Abraham Abraham can you explain how this is gonna happen you know what's gonna take place on that mountain well I know one thing we're gonna go worship and we're gonna come back down together how do you know that because he raised this one from the dead my stream of life was dead come on Romans four he had father had fostered an ish male finally God had to let it dry up there wasn't no more children coming you with me stream of life had dried up they were dead in order for Isaac to come forth God had to bring a change in their bodies are you with me don't tell me here they went down in Genesis in 19 and you know here that Sarah she's you know here the king of Greer when they go down there that all of a sudden how the King Wow you know here's a 100 year old woman I don't think so not even back there in no days I don't think so now I don't mean they're no disregard look I'm I know I'm 44 and I look about like 95 my pumpkin hitting everything you know but I what I'm trying to say is is that you know their bodies Sarah said in Genesis 18 she's the one in her heart she said how can this be seeing that pleasure has ceased between me and my Lord and the Spirit of God discerned what was in her heart thank God for discernment in our heart because you know what he does he dissolves doubts the doubts that we have because you know what we can't see ourselves but the word penetrates all the darkness all the down all the gloom over underneath and the where the light penetrates and look what I did she says no no no done I didn't laugh he said she laughed within herself and how can this be the reality comes down from where our lives were and where our lives as we look how can this be look away to Jesus looking unto Jesus they offer in the finisher of our faith you see what the word did you know what the word did it got her eyes off of herself the word by their head took our eyes off our self because as you look at yourself you only see defeat I'll never be I'll never make it I'll never you're only looking at yourself but if you can just heat to the word the word will take the eyes of your heart the in Illinois the eyes of your heart that'll look beyond these highs and walk toward the voice of the word Abraham you have not withheld that only son what I have given you you have taken it and you've given it all back to me what could Abraham offer what could Abraham what could you and I offer this is why the scripture says in Romans 12:1 brethren I beseech thee by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy acceptable which is your reasonable service meaning that's all you can do is just present yourself hey bruh hey I'm Abraham here here here are mine one of the greatest things that you find is when the words speaking to you it uncovers our life like like it did Sarah be honest with you I said be honest with him who speaking to you he's not here to shame you he's not here to intimidate you he's here to uncover and remove all doubt that's what he's here to do every doubt about your own self he's here to uncover everything so that what that knife might come even to those of us that's past that point of no return he's here making himself known in our life to call us beyond our own thinking listen to this this is all the patriarch Abraham I'm not said that a million times but this is about God's grace the last time and Abraham said look at this the RAM said and Abraham said I received him has one from the dead and I'm fully persuaded that he is able to raise him up from the dead that's the people now the seed of Abraham because he raised us from the dead we were dead in sin and trespasses and he who was able to change my mind you catch that he who was able to change my mind that's race starts first he starts to change your mind Helen he changed my thoughts change my nature changed me all over he can do as he pleases whatever he says I believe it's the truth and every seed of Abraham believes the same thing how are we walking up to Mount Moriah we're walking by the vision and the change that he has brought in our life as Abraham offered up Isaac as one who had been raised from the dead our lives are an offering because within us we were dead in sin and trespasses but you Ephesians two half he quickened we are walking with what alive that's been quickened he changed my nature so also change this mortal body redemptions unfolded on mount moriah Redemption comes to a closing on Mount Moriah Abraham not a disobedient to God taken the little boy and on this morning he told the servants you wait here with the mules and the son and I will go yonder to worship and he and I will return but how is it going to do it when he goes up to the top of the mountain to take his own son's life yet he says the child the lad and I will return he knowed listen to me he knowed that something had to happen if you need to pinch yourself right now pinch yourself right now say self wake up flesh you can stay quiet but I want the real me on the inside I need to borrow your ears right now he didn't know that he knowed that something was going to happen he didn't know just how God was going to do it that isn't his question he knows that God promised it and that's all we care to know God promised it how's it going to be and I can't tell you but God said so he will send Jesus Christ the second time he will come in a physical form he will claim his own there will be 1,000 years millennial reign upon this earth with him with the redeemed that's what he promised and we are looking for that hour to approach he promised to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out devils he promised to do it he's the same yesterday today and forever how I don't know he promised to do it we believe it that settles it when a man believes God this was a big old statement when a man believes God he believes all he says whether Samuel Abraham was a mature son of God absolutely it wasn't about that he understood it he believed what God said simply because God said it houses got me I don't know but I am the lad we're gonna go yonder and worship you stay right here we're gonna be right back how's that gonna happen I don't know how is he gonna change these bodies how are all those atoms I don't know one animal turn loose another atom I don't know but all I know is he said in a moment and a twinkling of an eye all I know is he said in John 14 if I go away I'll prepare a place for you in my father's house are many mansions dwelling places if it were not so I would have told you don't let your heart be trouble I'm going away to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself and I believe he's coming back like he said so what we going to do give our all give our all give to God by the surrendering of our lives what he has given to us the same of the surrendering of our lives yes let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus that our lives would be a surrendered offering unto Him every day not just not just once a week no no no not just twice a week not just three done daily daily and offering jesus said whosoever will not forsake father mother sister brother denying himself and taking up his cross says in the Book of Luke daily and following me is not worthy to be called my disciple I'll tell you this is the greatest privilege we have is to be able to take up not his cross he already took his cross but for us to take up our cross dying to self you know the new birth dying to self makes way for the new birth and you know if the new birth makes way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost it makes way for you to keep on dying I got real good news for you greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world hallelujah I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me where they're made more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ our Lord who could separate us from the love of God so high tell depp's different perceptions of things sickness health what what no I'm persuaded Paul said nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God we have through Christ Jesus our Lord I can't think of anything else that come from my heart you should be lord I surrender all I surrender all you think of how that a life you might look in your life right now and say better Samuel my life you don't know me he knows your life you could tell me all I can't do nothing about it I can't I can only point you to the one who's already done something for you I said he's already done something for you but I can tell you this right here that just as much as what you witness here a man that could step out of the way and God would take a gift here this morning just following his he just bringing it here this morning that same God if you will just submit your whole life if you if this is your life and you will take it I'll come up in a minute with you it's easier for you to come up here than me come down but like if this represents your life or my life and you represent the Lord it's as simple has taken this and saying Lord I've put my all in your hands and that's what it means for a surrendered life not look it's kind of wrinkly it don't look real good look at it it don't even measure it real good might have a stain on it no I give it to you you can't iron out the wrinkles you can't remove the stains but there's a blood I said there's a blood that removes all guilty stains and it removes the guilty stains and removes the very desire and changes that he lies what greater honor what greater honor he gave us this life what greater honor that we could do as a city I put it in your hands I put my life into your hands would there be anybody here this morning to say that's me Lord I'd take so one wrinkled-up this tattered stained up I put it into your hands god bless your hands anybody sittin over I give my all let it be a day of marking and memorial I give my all don't take it back you'll take it back don't take it back put it give it
