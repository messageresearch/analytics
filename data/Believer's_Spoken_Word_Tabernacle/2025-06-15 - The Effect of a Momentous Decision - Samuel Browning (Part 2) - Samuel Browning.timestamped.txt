[12:08] Oh,
[12:10] sweet Jesus.
[12:17] Hallelujah. Amen.
[12:20] That's the truth, isn't it? And God is
[12:23] so good and he's so faithful to us. He's
[12:26] faithful to his word. That's and that's
[12:29] that that's really what it is. When
[12:31] we're standing on his word, then we're
[12:32] in the place of safety. Amen. because
[12:34] God is faithful to his word. His word it
[12:38] cannot fail. Amen. It's so good to be in

[12:45] and uh certainly want to wish each and
[12:47] every one of the fathers here happy
[12:50] Father's Day. Amen. And may God richly
[12:52] bless you. I think it's a tremendous
[12:56] well it's a really it's a tremendous
[12:58] honor that God would you know he enable
[13:02] us to be parents and then also to give
[13:06] us the wisdom that we need because you
[13:09] realize as you you come along through so
[13:12] many things that um as I was telling
[13:14] them last week in South Carolina I was
[13:17] doing a a teaching session in between
[13:19] some of the services I had and I said
[13:21] you know there's things It's uh you come
[13:24] into it and you realize my Lord, I need
[13:26] your wisdom every step of the way. And I
[13:30] said, I've almost got to a place I said,
[13:31] I almost run from anybody that before
[13:33] they have kids that says, well, I'm
[13:35] going to do this and I'm going to do
[13:36] that and I'm going to do this and I'm
[13:37] going to do
[13:39] I almost want to say don't don't say
[13:41] that. Don't because I I found it to be
[13:44] the opposite and so uh and seeing that
[13:48] but oh how we need God's grace, don't
[13:50] we? man. So thankful for his leadership
[13:52] in our lives and and certainly I want to
[13:55] just say God bless you to each one of
[13:57] the fathers and um just so thank you for
[14:00] your stand. Amen. For this word I'm

[14:22] that light through one and then it
[14:24] spread through others and Amen. We're a
[14:26] product of that word. Amen. Like brother
[14:31] Brand when he went beyond the curtain of
[14:32] time and he looked he said, "Are all
[14:33] these Branos?" He said, "No, these are
[14:36] your converts."
[14:39] Amen. That word has brought has brought
[14:41] a real change in our lives. I'm thankful

[15:25] wanted to say thank you for your prayers
[15:27] while we were there in South Carolina.
[15:29] the Lord just the Lord just moved very
[15:31] marvelously within the the services and
[15:35] um we just so thankful to the Lord and
[15:38] um I was able to uh be there with my
[15:41] friend brother Brian Naidu and that was
[15:43] just a a real treat and um so but I
[15:47] really thank you for your prayers and I
[15:49] wish all of you could have been there it
[15:50] was a really good camp uh we had a lot
[15:53] of fun and uh you know how it is like
[15:55] this it says that um where where you're
[15:58] at you just jump right in and fit right
[16:00] in. So, you know, you're just there and
[16:02] they had a lot of activities for the
[16:04] with the young people and families. So,
[16:06] we were we just got right in there and
[16:08] had a good time. And so, uh sometimes,
[16:11] you know, you just kind of I have
[16:14] certain ways that I like in my
[16:16] preparations and how I approach certain
[16:17] things, but you know, sometimes you're
[16:19] in different situations. You just have
[16:21] to you go along with it and God knows.
[16:23] And uh but there was just u many many
[16:26] wonderful things that that took place
[16:28] within that meeting. So I want to say
[16:30] God bless you and thank you for your
[16:31] prayers for us. Uh let's look here and I
[16:35] want to read um I want to read a few
[16:38] verses of scripture and um yeah I'm back
[16:41] to Ruth.
[16:43] I really wasn't planning on this on this
[16:45] point. I've been looking over these
[16:47] things for well about a year and just a
[16:49] lot of these things have been
[16:50] accumulating. But I really felt after
[16:52] Thursday night's service to really take
[16:54] this approach in some of these things.
[16:56] So let's just look at this here in verse
[17:00] 6 and then we'll jump to verse 14. The
[17:03] Bible says, "Then she arose with her
[17:06] daughters-in-law that she might return
[17:08] from the country of Moab. For she had
[17:11] heard in the country of Moab how that
[17:13] the Lord had visited his people in
[17:16] giving them bread." Verse 14. And they
[17:20] lifted up their voice and wept again.
[17:22] And Orpha kissed her mother-in-law, but
[17:25] Ruth clave unto her. And she said,
[17:29] Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back
[17:33] unto her people and unto her gods, and
[17:37] return thou after thy sister-in-law.
[17:41] See, there was there was things that was
[17:43] still present in Orpha's heart that that
[17:47] turned her. there was still a love for
[17:49] those things. It turned her. This is why
[17:52] that when God even made a declaration,
[17:54] when we would come into the promised
[17:57] land, God told him, "Take out everything
[17:59] that's there. Don't even leave
[18:01] pictures." And on and on and on. And it
[18:03] really gets down to the real reality.
[18:05] The promised land is the word of this
[18:07] hour is the Holy Spirit and God-giving
[18:10] direction. Don't let anything stand in
[18:13] your life that would be against the word
[18:15] of God. And so we want to do that
[18:17] because if God said those things will
[18:19] become snares to your eyes. So we don't
[18:20] want to like brother Bram told us he
[18:22] said you know a little amalachite
[18:25] becomes a big amalachite. And when you
[18:28] look at what actually end up smiting
[18:30] Saul and killing him was an Amalachite.
[18:35] The very thing that Saul failed to take
[18:37] care of with King Aag the very same
[18:40] thing came and got him.
[18:44] So, we want to say, "Lord, search me
[18:46] through and through. I want the word. I
[18:48] I just I because if we're just obedient
[18:50] to the word, then God will take care of
[18:52] God will take care of everything." Verse
[18:54] 16.
[18:56] And Ruth said, "Entreat me not to leave
[18:59] thee or to return from following after
[19:02] thee. For whether thou goest, I will go,
[19:05] and whe where thou lodest, I will lodge.
[19:09] Thy people shall be my people, and thy
[19:12] God my God. Where thou diest will I die,
[19:16] and there will I be buried, and the Lord
[19:19] do so to me, and more also if ought but
[19:22] death part thee and me. And when she saw
[19:26] that she was steadfastly minded to go
[19:28] with her, then she left speaking unto
[19:32] her. Let's just go to the Lord in a word
[19:34] of prayer.
[19:37] Our heavenly father, Lord, how we are so
[19:41] thankful for these moments, Lord, that
[19:43] we have been given your grace, Lord, to
[19:47] come and to move upon our lives. And
[19:50] Lord, we just ask, oh God, that you
[19:53] would just have your way, Father, in the
[19:56] further part of this service, Lord, with
[20:00] these, Lord, thoughts that, Lord, that
[20:02] you've placed on my heart. And Lord, I
[20:05] just ask that God that you'll just allow
[20:08] me to step aside and you to just bring
[20:11] it, Lord, as you would see fit, Lord,
[20:13] and and to speak what needs to be
[20:16] spoken. And Lord, help us, God, to be
[20:19] recognized and aware when we've said
[20:21] enough, Lord. May you just have your
[20:23] way. Take the word to every heart, Lord.
[20:26] And just, Lord, minister to every need,
[20:29] Lord. Those that are sick in their body,
[20:31] maybe discouragement, Lord.
[20:34] Father, through the cares of this life,
[20:37] so many things, Lord, that we
[20:39] experience, Lord, in our and our body
[20:42] and our spirit, but Lord, you are the
[20:44] Lord that healeth all our diseases.
[20:48] Lord, you minister to every area of our
[20:50] life. And we just pray, God, that you'll
[20:52] just come and minister to every need,
[20:55] Lord, body, spirit, and soul. We commit
[20:58] ourselves into your hands in the name of
[21:00] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And God bless
[21:03] you as you're being seated.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:10] And so
[21:13] I think just to pause just a moment, I
[21:15] think some tremendous things. We were
[21:17] here on Thursday night and then you see
[21:20] where Israel took out uh certain dangers
[21:27] and uh you know that were imminent and
[21:30] we you see the world itself. It's it's
[21:32] really in a real shaky place already.
[21:36] And I just, you know, just pondering on
[21:38] those things of how that, you know,
[21:40] brother Bam was very clear. And I say
[21:43] this maybe for our young people and even
[21:45] as parents that's coming up. We don't
[21:48] want our children or our kids to get out
[21:50] there under the influence of that world
[21:54] because the world itself, you have to
[21:56] remember all of them. It's because
[21:58] there's been different ones that were
[21:59] just even offering up prayers for Israel
[22:03] during this time. And you can see the
[22:06] sentiments towards Israel continuing to
[22:09] turn even among we could say if I can
[22:12] use this word conservative
[22:15] individuals and you begin to see that
[22:17] and let me just say this to you where
[22:19] that's coming from that's that same
[22:21] Roman Catholic spirit. Absolutely. It's
[22:24] a spirit from hell. Yes, sir. because
[22:26] what it wants to do is destroy that seed
[22:30] because God has made a promise. I will
[22:33] restore Israel. I'm going to bring it
[22:35] back. And Satan you because Satan knows,
[22:38] listen, he knows his time is very short.
[22:42] And I want you to think about this.
[22:44] Israel is such a such a a small little
[22:47] place,
[22:49] but yet what's what what is it that that
[22:52] makes it makes the difference is because
[22:55] they are gods.
[22:58] Not not every not every Jew, not every
[23:01] Israel that Paul made that clear. Not
[23:03] all Israel is Israel, right? But yet to
[23:07] recognize that how God God is standing
[23:10] right there and no matter how much the
[23:12] enemy would like to build up and wipe
[23:14] them off, he can't destroy them. You
[23:17] know why? Because it's God's word. Amen.
[23:21] And I want you to think about that. Even
[23:23] within your life and my life and of the
[23:26] bride of Jesus Christ, the bride of
[23:27] Jesus Christ is not a a great big
[23:30] gathering of people. I know we can look
[23:31] and be look and say, "Well, beyond the
[23:33] curtain of time there were millions, but
[23:34] millions compared to what?" That's very
[23:37] small. That's right. And to be able to
[23:39] see that within that all of the forces
[23:41] of hell are targeted against this bride.
[23:46] The prophet made that clear when he when
[23:48] he speaks the feast of the trumpets and
[23:51] he and he and he and he um moves into
[23:54] that of Revelations 9 and how that the
[23:56] lid has been taken off of hell and he
[24:00] how that those streams of demon powers
[24:03] are coming out of there and remember
[24:05] they're like you know they describes and
[24:07] symbol of how that those spirits and
[24:09] those demons remember those spirits got
[24:12] in and began to influence Hitler and
[24:14] stolen. Is that right? They were
[24:17] channels that those those those spirits
[24:20] can influence.
[24:22] But I'm glad that God also has
[24:24] predestinated seed. That when the spirit
[24:27] of God begin to move, it can influence
[24:29] them into the pathways that God has for
[24:32] us. That's right. And this is where that
[24:35] according to you know when we look at it
[24:36] and the prophet would bring it so clear
[24:38] of how where the holocaust and all this
[24:41] is is has happened that you know um that
[24:45] it was the tender hand of Jehovah. It
[24:47] would that would not be something that
[24:49] we would say in a descriptive term that
[24:52] oh it was a tender hand but yet it was
[24:54] God getting his people back into
[24:57] position. And I want you to think about
[24:59] this. Israel since the time that Israel
[25:03] when they rejected um um the Messiah, we
[25:07] know there was a remnant that was within
[25:09] there that was sealed away and then
[25:11] there was a time where it turned away
[25:13] from them. And yet within this time,
[25:17] remember as even the prayer was made
[25:20] there that let his blood be upon us and
[25:22] upon our children. And now you find that
[25:25] even within
[25:27] uh those those Jews that were killed
[25:29] there in the Holocaust and right there
[25:32] you find that coming out in the fifth
[25:33] seal and they are beginning to you know
[25:36] cry for you know for a vengeance and cry
[25:39] for those things. So like the prophet
[25:41] points out there in the scripture he
[25:42] said that can't be the bride because the
[25:44] spirit of Christ in the bride cries to
[25:46] forgive.
[25:48] Is that right? So it's pointing out but
[25:50] see they were they were standing to all
[25:52] they knew those who who died within that
[25:55] place and then even when the bride is
[25:58] gone in rapture and the two witnesses
[26:00] the spirit of God in characteristic of
[26:03] Moses and Elijah sets down there and
[26:06] begins to call Israel that 144,000 to
[26:09] the true repentance I want to say this
[26:11] that it will only be 144,000 is
[26:14] according to scripture they will be
[26:17] hated and want you to think about this.
[26:19] If you can look at it that the hatred
[26:21] that is now is so uh broke up and
[26:24] divided across so many across so many uh
[26:28] uh platforms or persons or or groups but
[26:33] think that once the bride of Jesus
[26:35] Christ is gone because everything is is
[26:37] is really being honed in and targeted on
[26:40] the bride of Jesus Christ right now.
[26:42] Yes, Israel is experiencing pressure.
[26:43] But after the bride is taken up and the
[26:46] Holy Spirit begins to fall and the word
[26:48] is being delivered there into Jerusalem.
[26:51] Everything itself is going to turn even
[26:55] even in a greater way in that time. But
[26:58] you know what God said? He will seal
[27:00] them.
[27:02] And you know even when he stopped the
[27:05] wars, he stopped it because why? He
[27:08] needed to seal his servants.
[27:12] And that's the same way that's where it
[27:13] comes to you and I. If God had not
[27:15] stopped it and kept back those woes,
[27:17] where would you and I have been? Amen.
[27:19] You see, even in catching that that it's
[27:21] God's mercy that reached out and says,
[27:24] "It cannot take place until I've sealed
[27:26] my servants." So, we see that even
[27:28] within this this part within Israel, the
[27:31] 144,000, those listen, it's not going to
[27:34] be the Wall Street Jews that are turning
[27:35] against them. There will be some of
[27:36] that, but it'll be the very orthodox.
[27:40] Some of the very ones that will be so
[27:43] staunch and not, but you know, there's
[27:45] an elect.
[27:47] There you go. And the prophet said it
[27:49] like this. He says, "The same angel of
[27:51] the Lord that met me and revealed this
[27:54] message to me," he said, "He's on earth
[27:56] tonight running Israel back to the
[27:58] homeland." Hallelujah. God's getting
[28:00] everything in position. Everything in
[28:02] position. He's getting us in position.
[28:05] That's right. Amen. We're we're we're in
[28:07] a time that it's it's a time to be ready
[28:10] at any moment, at any time. And we can
[28:13] look at that and I say I could echo the
[28:15] words of the prophet, I stand with
[28:17] Israel. Amen. Amen. Oh my. Soon and very
[28:21] soon. Soon and very soon. Ruth herself,
[28:25] she was standing with Naomi.
[28:28] Amen. Is that right? to see the secular
[28:30] in the world. And I say this for the
[28:32] young people and things because the
[28:34] world and everything else, these pe
[28:35] these people don't have no clue what
[28:37] they're doing. That's right. Even all
[28:39] these individuals that were, you know,
[28:41] protesting, I'm not here for a political
[28:43] stump. I'm just dropping this in. These
[28:45] people that are doing this and
[28:46] protesting God, go live over there.
[28:48] That's right. Go live over there.
[28:51] Go live over there.
[28:54] Some of the individuals that were out
[28:56] there, I dare you to step foot in there.
[28:58] They'll they'll take your head off your
[28:59] neck in a moment's worth of time because
[29:01] they don't even put up with that kind of
[29:02] lifestyle. That's right. That's right.
[29:04] Come on now. But it's But you listen,
[29:07] pity the people because it's spirits
[29:09] that's anointed. It's the spirits that's
[29:12] been released. That's right. Right.
[29:16] Lucifer, I saw him falling. And here
[29:18] it's loosened in Revelations 9. But I
[29:20] love how Revelations chapter 10 reads,
[29:24] "And I saw another mighty angel.
[29:28] One who has a foot on the land and on
[29:31] the sea, they cannot rise until I get my
[29:34] people out of here.
[29:37] What a comfort that is, isn't it? Lord,
[29:39] let us press the mark with all that's
[29:41] within us. Amen.
[29:44] So, let's look here at a at a thought
[29:46] here just a few moments. And I know that
[29:47] counts against me, but uh I just uh we
[29:51] want to just say say a few things that's
[29:53] on our hearts. and um that that was
[29:55] free, but it it'll count. So, I want to
[30:00] just really deal with uh look at a a
[30:03] thought here just for a few moments. And
[30:06] I want to just I probably not going to
[30:08] get to the all of this here, but I want
[30:10] to deal with the effect of a momentous
[30:13] decision.
[30:14] The effect of a momentous decision. And
[30:16] you know, I want to say that in each
[30:19] time, um, Brother Trevor, I just so
[30:21] appreciate how the Lord used our brother
[30:23] in such a a wonderful way there on
[30:26] Thursday night. I told him after the
[30:28] service, I said, "You preached all of
[30:30] adoption. You preached the Hebrew
[30:32] series. You preached all of this in one
[30:34] service. You tied it up. Good. It was
[30:37] just beautiful." So, but you know,
[30:39] decision, I think it's a wonderful thing
[30:41] for me. I look that whether as a pastor
[30:44] or a son of God, a father or husband and
[30:47] so forth, I I think that when a decision
[30:49] is made to accept salvation through
[30:52] Jesus Christ, repenting of our sins and
[30:54] turning from him and walking with God's
[30:56] goodness, I think that's a that I think
[30:58] that's something to be celebrated. The
[31:00] Bible tells us that all heaven rejoices
[31:03] and to think about that and that's
[31:05] because with the ultimate desire is that
[31:08] that life would come into a full
[31:10] relationship. But first of all, they
[31:12] have to recognize they have a need of a
[31:15] savior. And just to have that decision,
[31:18] we we have this understanding by God's
[31:20] grace is that that decision is only the
[31:23] beginning of many decisions to be made
[31:26] in our walk with God. And we're here
[31:29] this morning. You made a decision to be
[31:31] in the house of God this morning. Uh you
[31:34] know, maybe you had to push yourself a
[31:36] little bit. You were weary. You were
[31:37] tired. But you're here. you made a
[31:40] decision as Paul said forsake not to
[31:42] assemble yourselves together. You know,
[31:44] he's placing that that's a choice.
[31:46] That's a decision. We you don't have to
[31:48] God's not there forcing us to do
[31:50] anything. It's a choice. And so when we
[31:53] find this here with Ruth, I I think this
[31:56] is so tremendous of how Let me just kind
[31:59] of move through a few portions here in
[32:01] the scripture because we we've come
[32:03] through uh quite a bit. And I I know in
[32:05] September is where I left off with this,
[32:06] but I want to just bring this along
[32:09] here. In Ruth 1, you see the Holy Spirit
[32:12] moving upon upon Ruth. God allowed
[32:15] conditions to arise and situations.
[32:18] Naomi's husband dies. Ruth and Orpha's
[32:21] husband dies. And Naomi begins to hear
[32:24] of the resurrection power. Barley season
[32:28] is moving there. And there's bread
[32:30] there. And so there's nothing to hold
[32:34] Naomi back where she's at. And Naomi now
[32:37] is going to make her journey to the
[32:39] homeland. And as Naomi is making her
[32:42] journey to the homeland, Ruth is
[32:45] accompanying her. I I think it's
[32:46] tremendous how that as I said moments
[32:48] ago when the Jews here returning back to
[32:52] their homeland and at the same time God
[32:55] is bringing a people back to our
[32:58] homeland, bringing a bride back to the
[33:01] homeland that God promised. You say,
[33:03] "What is that homeland?" The word of
[33:05] God, the Holy Ghost, not just not just a
[33:09] baptism on our spirit, but to actually
[33:12] come in to the word, Christ himself. We
[33:15] are by one spirit. We are all baptized
[33:18] into one body. That's where our
[33:19] inheritance lays. There you go. And so
[33:23] God working within in this hour in in
[33:27] this time because our destiny is not
[33:30] just not just to come into that place of
[33:33] that land but from there we have the
[33:36] promise in my father's house are many
[33:38] mansions. That's our representation. But
[33:41] the word is guiding us, directing us.
[33:44] He's taking us and the whole time he's
[33:47] there presenting or giving forth the
[33:50] influence of his person to do what?
[33:54] Cause decisions to be made that will
[33:57] lead us closer to him. That's so good.
[33:59] Hallelujah. When it's all said and done,
[34:02] we are his achievement. Yes, sir. Yes,
[34:05] sir. The crowning achievement. What has
[34:09] uh Calvary achieved when the blood was
[34:12] shed? It paid the price. Then he
[34:15] deposited those sins in hell, rose up on
[34:18] that Easter morning, and he and he said,
[34:20] "Because I live, you shall live also."
[34:22] And he sent back the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[34:26] So, it's not just not just to look at
[34:28] Calvary, but to recognize what Calvary
[34:31] made a way for you and I that we can
[34:34] come into that place of a relationship
[34:37] with him.
[34:39] What brought Calvary? the love of the
[34:42] father.
[34:44] God's desire to be one with his
[34:47] offspring.
[34:50] That's so good. That he might share his
[34:53] life with you and I and bring us back
[34:55] across the chasm and as a matter of fact
[34:58] to do away with any chasm in your life.
[35:02] That's so good. So good. And that's what
[35:05] the Holy Spirit comes to do is make that
[35:09] real.
[35:11] So the Holy Spirit moving upon Ruth and
[35:15] Ruth like the prophet said she caught a
[35:17] vision and though there were many things
[35:21] we don't read it in the scripture but to
[35:23] think when you even would begin to make
[35:24] a decision or or I you you have all
[35:27] sorts of chatter and all sorts of things
[35:29] and I don't know you better be careful
[35:30] with that. I I don't know that's a
[35:32] little deep that's a little on the stiff
[35:33] end. I I don't know. You don't have to
[35:35] be that, you know, not that Naomi so so
[35:38] strict and Naomi is so tight. But you
[35:40] see others, they were looking at it from
[35:44] their heart. What they saw is the
[35:47] strictness and and the tightness and the
[35:49] oh, we can't do that. Ruth was looking
[35:52] at it from her heart, but Ruth was
[35:54] looking at it and saying, this is where
[35:56] I want to go.
[35:58] This is what I want to do. She's making
[36:01] a decision based on what's in her heart.
[36:05] Orpha made a decision at the beginning,
[36:08] but what was in her heart brought her
[36:10] back.
[36:12] Lot's wife started out as an overcomer.
[36:17] But she heard the cries of her
[36:20] grandchildren.
[36:21] That's the prophet's words. And it
[36:24] turned her back. There was something
[36:26] that she valued greater than following
[36:30] the word
[36:33] Jesus. Oh my. Let us esteem God's word
[36:37] above everything. Amen. Above our own
[36:39] opinions, above our own feelings, above
[36:42] our own ideas, because because if if we
[36:45] don't follow the word, what chance,
[36:47] where what direction, what image, what
[36:50] what is it do our children have to
[36:52] follow? That's right. That's the truth.
[36:54] We want to be laying footsteps. Like
[36:56] remember that man who was drunk? He was
[36:58] drunk and here he was staggering through
[37:00] the snow and and he looked behind and he
[37:02] seen his boy doing this and falling down
[37:04] and he realized what he's doing is he's
[37:06] following in my steps. We want to lay
[37:09] clear steps.
[37:11] Hallelujah. Listen, you and I can't undo
[37:13] our mistakes. We can't undo our
[37:15] failures. But what we can do is look to
[37:17] God and say, "God, give me grace that my
[37:19] footsteps they would be clear. They're
[37:21] not here. They're not there, but they're
[37:23] a clarity of footsteps that's doing one
[37:26] thing, leading us closer to Jesus
[37:28] Christ. That if I go by the way of the
[37:31] grave, we continue on that same pathway.
[37:34] And that's what God has given us in this
[37:37] message of the hour is the path to
[37:40] sunship, the path to rapture, the path
[37:43] to full adoption, the path to sons and
[37:47] daughters of God coming back into full
[37:49] maturity. Amen. That's what this word
[37:51] has delivered to you and I. It's not an
[37:54] obscure, not a dismal, not not gray, not
[37:56] cloudy, not it's a clear day has broke
[37:59] for the bride of Jesus Christ.
[38:02] That's why the word could speak
[38:04] expressly that arise and shine for thy
[38:07] light has come. What light is that? The
[38:11] evening light.
[38:14] Hallelujah. The prophet has walked and
[38:16] where God ordained him to walk. But that
[38:19] light, it was an opening. It was a way.
[38:21] And what was it doing? Pointing us
[38:24] behind the veil. Come behind the veil.
[38:27] Come into relationship. Praise the Lord.
[38:30] So is the Holy Spirit working upon
[38:32] Ruth's life. Now look here. I'm going to
[38:35] read just a few a few portions here in
[38:38] Ruth chapter 2.
[38:40] And to think how the Holy Spirit coming
[38:42] there in Ruth 1, you know the word, let
[38:46] me just say this, the word, the whole
[38:49] purpose of the preaching of the word is
[38:52] to build confidence
[38:55] is to build faith to drive back doubt
[38:59] and unbelief
[39:01] so that you can you can see him clearly.
[39:06] Is that all right? And it is to awaken
[39:10] you and I to make a choice. See, it
[39:13] awakens us. We we we can't stay in the
[39:16] same place where we were. That's right.
[39:20] It's impossible. We're either getting
[39:21] closer to God or we're drifting further
[39:23] away. So, it God sends his word to
[39:27] anoint our heart and mind and then to
[39:30] awaken our hearts like it was doing for
[39:32] Ruth. And then those choices will
[39:35] declare who she was. And so yet at this
[39:39] point in Ruth 1, Ruth is not fully
[39:42] manifesting bride material, but it's in
[39:45] her.
[39:47] Are you with me? It's in her.
[39:50] There's certain fruits right now that
[39:52] praise God where she's starting out, but
[39:54] she's going going to have to keep
[39:56] walking. But God is faithful. The same
[39:59] angel of the Lord, the same Holy Spirit
[40:01] that sought her out, that sought you
[40:03] out, is the same Holy Spirit. He
[40:05] accompanies his word because he's not
[40:08] here to shove his word down our throat.
[40:11] He's not here to to push us into a
[40:14] place. He's here by his divine power to
[40:17] put the church in position.
[40:21] That's God's that's God's that's his
[40:23] that's his uh word that he's committed
[40:26] to. And so here, notice in Ruth 2 and
[40:29] these scriptures when when Boaz has come
[40:32] to Ruth and you know Ruth is saying,
[40:34] "How did I find grace in thine eyes that
[40:36] you would take knowledge of me?" Because
[40:38] remember, he's he's he's asking her to
[40:40] come and eat at at his table uh there in
[40:43] the field. He's he's he's commenced, you
[40:45] know, that there would be handfuls of
[40:47] purpose. Don't go to any other field.
[40:49] And and here's what he says in verse 11.
[40:51] It it says, "It hath been fully showed
[40:54] me all that thou hast done unto thy
[40:57] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[40:59] husband, how thou hast left thy father
[41:01] and thy mother, and the land of thy
[41:03] nativity, and are come unto a people
[41:06] which thou kneest not here to for." Now,
[41:09] what is it? Her decisions that are being
[41:12] made is it's it's faith. And faith is
[41:16] expressing itself in works in her life.
[41:20] She's not doing this in order to be
[41:22] accepted. She's simply responding to the
[41:26] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that is
[41:29] being poured out in the hour that she is
[41:32] living in.
[41:35] It was not her that sought out this
[41:37] field, but that representation
[41:40] within her. The Holy Spirit is guiding
[41:44] her into a place. She has no idea that
[41:48] this field is the field of one of the
[41:51] kinsmen. Hallelujah. She has no idea
[41:54] when she comes into this field of what's
[41:57] going to transpire and take place in her
[41:59] life. She has no idea that in this
[42:02] field, this is the field of the man who
[42:05] will redeem all of Amalecch's estate.
[42:09] Hallelujah. She has no idea of this
[42:12] field. My, it's wonderful. My, the
[42:14] blessings are falling. But she has no
[42:16] idea of that purpose that yet she feels
[42:19] the pulsation of the Holy Spirit. It's
[42:22] directing her life. And here she is just
[42:25] moving through the field. But little
[42:27] does she know Hallelujah. That her life
[42:32] her her vessel will be a chosen vessel
[42:36] for Christ to come forth through. Amen.
[42:40] And the very same almighty God, that
[42:44] word will become an absolute incarnate
[42:47] word.
[42:49] Hallelujah. And it will become incarnate
[42:51] and it will be passed over to Naomi.
[42:56] It will come to that place. An infant
[42:58] truth. Where did you get the scars in
[43:00] your hands? Any young person can answer
[43:02] that
[43:03] in the house of my friends. Christ
[43:06] moving through his body. Is that right?
[43:10] The life flows through the body. That's
[43:12] the purpose of the bride body. She
[43:16] hasn't she Ruth doesn't know know and
[43:18] understand the whole magnitude. Let me
[43:20] just say this friends. You and I are
[43:22] sitting here this morning and and even
[43:24] when God begin to deal with our life,
[43:26] this message means more to us now
[43:31] than it did at first.
[43:33] This grace means more to us now than it
[43:36] did before. it. It's becoming more real.
[43:40] You're seeing yourself. You're seeing
[43:42] your position and recognize it's not I
[43:44] that liveth, but it's Christ that liveth
[43:46] in me. Is that right? When when we are
[43:49] taken off the scene, that same Holy
[43:52] Spirit moves over there upon the Jews.
[43:56] Here she is. Look what Look what Boaz
[43:58] says. The Lord recompense thy work, and
[44:03] a full reward be given thee of the Lord
[44:06] God of Israel, under whose wings thou
[44:10] art come to trust. So notice Boaz is
[44:14] pointing out to her that that of God's
[44:17] of God's desire and to there would be a
[44:20] recompensing of thy work. Now what is
[44:23] her work? Her work is following the
[44:26] pulsation of the Holy Spirit. God's
[44:30] going to God's going to cap off his
[44:32] bride with himself.
[44:35] God caps off each of our lives with
[44:37] himself. Is that right? And you know
[44:40] what it all is when it's all said and
[44:42] done? It's because of his sovereign
[44:44] grace that you and I have made the
[44:46] choices we've made. And when we've made
[44:49] the wrong choices, it's his sovereign
[44:51] grace that leads us to a place of real
[44:54] humility and repentance and being lined
[44:57] back up in the way we need to be. Amen.
[44:59] Yes, sir. Is that right? Yes, sir. Even
[45:01] when they in the back of the line were
[45:03] getting out of step and the and the
[45:04] voice said, "Get back in line." Amen. It
[45:08] was God's grace to to keep everything
[45:11] lined up. And notice when it's all said
[45:13] and done, it will not be and it's not
[45:15] the heart of the bride petitioning God
[45:18] on behalf of their works. That's those
[45:20] who come up and miss having their
[45:23] vessels filled with oil and they
[45:26] petition him based on I preached.
[45:30] I did mighty men were miracles. I had
[45:33] healings. I had this. I had that. I had
[45:34] this. I had that. I had that. They had
[45:36] all sorts of things. Right? But Jesus
[45:39] said, "Depart from me, you workers of
[45:41] iniquity."
[45:44] You see, he's charging them because they
[45:47] knew what they were doing. Iniquity is
[45:51] to know what to do and refused to do it.
[45:55] That's what iniquity is. Is that right?
[45:57] I never knew you, never had a
[45:59] relationship with you. But that's not so
[46:01] with the bride of Jesus Christ. for the
[46:03] bride of Jesus Christ can withstand
[46:05] there and not standing at the white
[46:07] throne room but she's standing there in
[46:09] judgment with him and she's able to
[46:11] declare Lord it was you that's given me
[46:14] grace it was you that moved upon my life
[46:17] it's been you Lord that has inspired my
[46:20] heart it is you that has performed your
[46:23] word through my life Lord I'm a trophy
[46:25] of your grace it's all because of your
[46:28] grace
[46:30] hallelujah
[46:32] Now, you know, Ruth, she's she's
[46:36] gleaning. I want you to just think of
[46:37] this here for a moment because all
[46:39] throughout the congregation, I want you
[46:42] to think, where am I in this in this
[46:45] little book called Ruth? Where am I?
[46:49] Because with Ruth, she's gleaning. Oh,
[46:52] she's having a wonderful time gleaning
[46:55] in the fields. And she's gleaning from
[46:58] resurrection power. Gleaning from it.
[47:01] She feels it move upon upon her, but
[47:06] she's not a full partaker of it in in
[47:09] Ruth 2. She's not. She's receiving
[47:13] benefits from taking the word in her
[47:15] life and feeding on it. That's good.
[47:17] Listen, friends, even those that stayed
[47:20] around this message and now have turned
[47:22] their back and walked away and and and
[47:24] beset themselves as enemies against the
[47:27] vindicated word. this word when they
[47:30] were around it, it benefited their
[47:32] lives.
[47:36] They benefited from it to whatever
[47:38] degree, to whatever measure. But then
[47:41] you find here, here was Ruth. She's
[47:43] feeding on the word. What is the word of
[47:45] God doing? It's sanctifying her life. I
[47:48] want you to think of this. She she had
[47:50] already come under his wings and she's
[47:53] eating in his field. But after every
[47:56] day, she would go back to her own
[47:59] dwelling. Right. Right. Are you with me?
[48:02] She would she would gather and whatever
[48:04] she gathered, she went back to her own
[48:07] to to her own dwelling. And to see that
[48:11] was not the ultimate goal. This is why
[48:13] that friends how we appreciate and
[48:15] listen. We come to the house of God to
[48:17] feed on the word of God to hear God's
[48:20] word but listen with the goal and the
[48:22] desire not that we just have an
[48:24] enjoyment and go back to our own ways.
[48:28] Amen.
[48:29] It's not see the word was meant to have
[48:32] an effect. It was meant that the Bible
[48:35] said we are being changed from glory
[48:37] unto glory. There ought to be a greater
[48:39] desire. There ought to be more. A desire
[48:42] for more of God.
[48:44] See, God's desire as the word is coming
[48:47] is to build faith, is to build
[48:49] confidence, not that we just come and I
[48:51] I appreciate the blessings of the Lord.
[48:53] I appreciate the word of God. But we
[48:55] want that word to find its place in the
[48:58] depths of our hearts.
[49:00] That's why the prophet said a man could
[49:02] come into the holy place, the the that
[49:05] second realm and can enjoy feasting on
[49:08] the word of God and go back out and live
[49:11] the same kind of a life.
[49:14] I think it's wonderful to feast on the
[49:17] word of God. But remember, the word of
[49:19] God is coming to build confidence and
[49:22] faith in your heart that this is who I
[49:24] am. And it's God calling you you to a
[49:27] full relationship. Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:30] Hallelujah.
[49:33] Good preaching. And thank God for
[49:35] justification. Amen. Absolutely.
[49:39] Hallelujah. But remember,
[49:43] thank God for sanctification. But here
[49:45] was Ruth working out her own salvation
[49:48] with fear and trembling, gathering in
[49:50] from the field. But God's desire was for
[49:54] rest.
[49:56] Was for rest.
[49:59] Ruth, she was laboring of her own
[50:01] strength.
[50:03] Let me just tell you, rest is a person.
[50:07] She wasn't. She was laboring of her own
[50:09] strength. My wonderful and how all of
[50:12] But she was still in her own strength,
[50:14] right? You know, that's where even
[50:16] sanctification comes in is still in her
[50:19] own strength. You say, "Brother Samuel,
[50:20] do we still have to work out our own
[50:22] salvation and trembling?" Well, every
[50:24] man needs to know how to care and
[50:25] possess his vessel unto sanctification
[50:27] and honor. That's right. Right. I mean,
[50:29] you you begin to learn over time of
[50:31] things that you're not going here. Just
[50:32] like people you you know, it's like
[50:33] people you come in contact with at work.
[50:35] You have people at work, all they do is
[50:37] bicker, complain, criticize. All they do
[50:40] is strip down bosses and everything
[50:42] else. You know, they're the ones that
[50:43] can do it better.
[50:45] You eventually learn don't go around
[50:47] them.
[50:49] Simple. You see, you learn that. You
[50:51] learn how to possess your vessel and the
[50:53] sanctification honor. In other words,
[50:55] I'm not going to go there and dirty
[50:56] myself up. I already know what's going
[50:58] to come from that channel so I know how
[51:01] to possess. Amen. Amen. See, we learn.
[51:04] We're growing. We're learning. And
[51:06] that's even in our walk. Then in our
[51:08] rest, we learned that. Amen.
[51:12] She's She's enthused. Ruth was enthused.
[51:15] She was comforted every time. Here she
[51:18] is coming to Boaz's table. Boaz is
[51:21] stretching parched, you know, parched
[51:23] corn, barley, little barley broth to
[51:25] her. But she everything she got from the
[51:28] fields she was still having to work for.
[51:30] They were handfuls of purpose, but she
[51:32] still had to pick them up. Yeah. Is that
[51:35] right? Amen. But you see there, there's
[51:37] more. And she was getting she was
[51:40] excited. And I think that's wonderful.
[51:41] Listen, let me just tell you something.
[51:43] God's not knocking enthusiasm,
[51:45] right? He's not knocking being excited.
[51:48] But don't mistake excitement for the
[51:52] Holy Ghost. Amen. The Holy Spirit will
[51:55] bring that.
[51:58] He'll bring emotions.
[52:01] Right. But don't mistake sensations and
[52:04] emotions as the Holy Spirit. There's
[52:06] only one evidence and that is the word.
[52:11] Genuine faith in the word of God. Being
[52:14] able to receive the word of God for your
[52:17] day. Amen. Right. To take that word,
[52:20] live it, and that word be lived through
[52:22] your life.
[52:24] Is that right? I know. I know many many
[52:26] can say, "Well, you know, I believe the
[52:27] word." But it'll always prove itself
[52:29] out. It'll always prove itself out. Cuz
[52:32] we can say that intellectually, but you
[52:34] know what? It isn't up to me to decipher
[52:37] who's saying it intellectually. It will
[52:39] prove out. But it is God trying to
[52:41] encourage every one of us is if
[52:44] something is at an intellectual stage,
[52:46] don't leave it there. There's a start.
[52:48] But press on till it drops from here to
[52:51] here and becomes a reality. Amen. To
[52:55] where it's no longer I that liveth, but
[52:57] Christ that liveth in me, then you've
[53:00] got a power to break the hold of every
[53:03] curse from your family tree. Amen. Amen.
[53:06] You got a power that comes into your
[53:08] life to break the claiming hold of every
[53:11] complex. Amen. Are you hearing me?
[53:14] That's what this abstract does. The Holy
[53:17] Ghost does to the title deed. Amen.
[53:21] Praise the Lord. So here, he's the only
[53:24] one could give her rest. This is why
[53:27] brother Brandon would say over and over,
[53:30] not to know his word, his life, but to
[53:33] know him. That's right. Amen. To know
[53:36] him. Jesus said in the scripture, "Come
[53:39] unto me all you that are heavy laden,
[53:42] and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
[53:45] upon you and learn of me, for I'm meek
[53:47] and lowly, and you shall find rest unto
[53:50] your souls." For my yoke is easy, and my
[53:53] burden is light. In Hebrews 4, it says,
[53:56] "There remainth therefore rest to the
[53:58] people of God. For he that enterth into
[54:00] his wrath also hath ceased from his own
[54:03] works, as God did from his. Let us
[54:08] labor, meaning to be to endeavor, be
[54:10] diligent, therefore, to enter into that
[54:13] rest, lest any man fall after the same
[54:16] example of unbelief.
[54:18] There were those who came to God's rest
[54:21] and rejected it. Right.
[54:23] They came up to that of the Holy Ghost
[54:28] and they rejected it. True. They even
[54:31] walked in the land. Oh my and help their
[54:34] brethren fighting. Yeah. That's good.
[54:38] That's good. Right. Yeah. That's the
[54:40] scripture.
[54:42] And then they returned back over Trans
[54:44] Jordan returned back over the Jordan.
[54:47] Yeah. Now, I want to remind you, look
[54:50] what that decision led to. You just sang
[54:53] the song, there's no one greater than
[54:55] than than Jesus. Is that right? I want
[54:58] to remind you of that decision that was
[55:00] in that of Gad they were on. They did
[55:03] not come into the land. They dwelt out
[55:06] on the other side of Jordan. That's
[55:08] right. Look what happened to their
[55:11] children. Look what happened to that
[55:13] one. Right. Oh, this is why it's the
[55:17] most glorious and should be the most
[55:19] soughtafter to dwell in the land of
[55:22] promise. Amen. Listen, the peace that
[55:24] you feel when you come to the house of
[55:26] God, his presence, God don't want that
[55:29] just to be something that you experience
[55:31] here, he wants to make his abode in your
[55:34] life. Yeah. Not just something that
[55:37] comes on you and leaves and comes on you
[55:40] and leaves. But something that abides.
[55:44] The prophets had that where it came on
[55:46] them and left. Came on them and left.
[55:48] But the sign,
[55:50] hallelujah, of restoration was on whom
[55:53] thou seeth the spirit descend and abide.
[55:57] The same is he. That's what declares and
[56:01] places sons of God is the Holy Spirit
[56:04] coming to abide in our lives.
[56:08] Are you hearing me?
[56:10] Now listen, Ruth has had to make a lot
[56:13] of choices. There's been a lot of
[56:16] decisions that she has had to make
[56:19] within her life. A lot of things have
[56:22] come have come her way. You know, she's
[56:24] when when she begins you begin to make
[56:26] decisions to serve God. Every decision
[56:30] you that that you and I make, it ought
[56:32] to be something just to evaluate.
[56:34] Listen, we're living in an hour. We can
[56:36] we cannot be living in a time where
[56:39] well, I just, you know, I'll just go
[56:40] ahead and make this decision. I don't
[56:41] know if it's God or not. And well, if
[56:43] it's not God, you know, God's grace will
[56:44] get me out. That's listen, that's an
[56:46] immature life. That's good.
[56:51] That's making God's grace a despite to
[56:54] the spirit of grace. Listen, if God's
[56:57] grace can get you out, don't you think
[56:59] his grace can lead you?
[57:03] Listen, friends, sometimes the the
[57:05] things that even God is trying to deal
[57:07] with and work out in our life that even
[57:09] works to be our own greatest enemy is we
[57:12] somehow feel in under under a glorious
[57:15] message that God has given as no, I
[57:17] don't need anybody else. I don't need
[57:18] any part of the body. I can just do as I
[57:20] want to do. That's not that's not what
[57:22] that's not the the reaction to the
[57:26] spirit of truth. The spirit of truth
[57:28] when that is truly come and revealed to
[57:30] our hearts. It makes us to realize I'm
[57:32] depending on him every step of the way.
[57:36] And what I mean by that is we want his
[57:38] leadership in our lives.
[57:42] When the bride was walking in step,
[57:44] she's not walking out here on her own.
[57:45] Not out here on an island, not on here
[57:47] on an island, but walking in step with
[57:49] the body. And you know what that
[57:51] requires? Sacrifice. God will test our
[57:54] lives.
[57:57] To see how much is still there, how much
[58:00] of a lamb nature is there? Are we
[58:04] willing to sacrifice? Listen, the
[58:06] prophet tells us in Christity verse
[58:08] idolatry. He said, "Oh, how we want to
[58:10] see God move in our church." He said,
[58:12] "But remember, just like it was through
[58:14] Martin, just like it was through Iranius
[58:16] in the fruits and their ministry, it
[58:18] will take a great amount of sacrifice."
[58:22] He said, "Because the whole walk with
[58:25] God is a sacrificial move. It will
[58:28] require us," he said, to sacrifice a
[58:30] little time in prayer. It'll require us
[58:33] sacrificing to be in the house of God.
[58:35] It'll require us sacrificing our own
[58:37] ideas and our own opinions. But friends,
[58:41] I tell you, the hospitals could be
[58:44] emptied up. But you know what? That's
[58:47] all it would be. But when God moving
[58:50] down and giving grace and life's
[58:53] character being molded, that's rapture.
[58:55] Amen.
[58:57] That's rapture.
[58:59] That's the promise of the third pull in
[59:01] this hour. The other things is like the
[59:03] prophet said, every once in a while,
[59:05] Lord, do something among us just to let
[59:07] us know you're with us.
[59:10] Because the bride is not following signs
[59:12] and wonders. They follow her. Amen.
[59:15] That's so good. Amen. You see, there's a
[59:18] part like Peter, remember on Mount
[59:19] Transfiguration, I want you to think,
[59:21] think of the time we're at on Mount
[59:23] Transfiguration, the time of adoption.
[59:25] And within this time, Peter became
[59:27] enthused and excited under that
[59:30] presence. And the prophet said that is
[59:32] natural for a human being to respond in
[59:34] that way.
[59:36] But aren't you thankful for the word
[59:38] that brought clarity?
[59:41] We're not going to build this one up.
[59:43] We're not going to build this one up,
[59:44] build this ministry. We're not going to
[59:45] now it's Jesus Christ.
[59:48] He's the one that's exalted. Now notice
[59:52] here in in Ruth too as we're looking at
[59:54] this that you know Naomi it's Naomi that
[59:58] catches I mean Ruth she's just enthused
[1:00:01] she's coming back. My goodness. Look at
[1:00:03] all this grain. Yeah. She's not aware
[1:00:08] what this is. That's right. The
[1:00:10] blessings. Oh, you talk about blessings.
[1:00:12] Oh, what blessings. Oh, how wonderful it
[1:00:15] is to walk in all the blessings. Oh, the
[1:00:18] presence of God. But now Naomi is
[1:00:21] bringing her to reality. Ruth,
[1:00:25] where have you been today?
[1:00:28] Blessings like that, that which you are
[1:00:31] receiving, where have you been?
[1:00:33] Hallelujah. And she lets her know, I
[1:00:35] have been in a field whose name is Boaz.
[1:00:39] Oh, Naomi is cluing her in to where the
[1:00:43] divine blessings that are falling. I
[1:00:45] hope you're with me. Yes. You see, this
[1:00:48] is why that this message that God has
[1:00:50] sent is not another movement. Amen.
[1:00:54] This is not a Knox, not a Moody. This is
[1:00:56] not an Isuza Street Pentecost.
[1:01:00] This message, this message is Christ
[1:01:02] himself come right among us. It's Christ
[1:01:06] who has led us to this field of the
[1:01:09] revealed word of the hour.
[1:01:12] Oh my, this blessing. Almighty, this
[1:01:14] doctrine and and this wonderful. But
[1:01:16] Ruth, do you know what it's all about?
[1:01:18] Oh, it's wonderful. We see signs. We see
[1:01:21] wonders. We see this. Oh, I see the
[1:01:23] godhead. I I see the serpent sea. But
[1:01:25] Ruth, do you know what it's all about?
[1:01:30] That's so good. Remember, many parttook
[1:01:33] of the miracles in Jesus ministry and
[1:01:35] the Israelites when they were coming
[1:01:37] from Egypt all the way through. But
[1:01:39] David wrote under inspiration. The
[1:01:42] fathers understood not the miracles.
[1:01:46] That's right.
[1:01:48] Many followed the Lord Jesus for the
[1:01:50] miracles. That's right. But when it came
[1:01:53] time for the word, first pool had went
[1:01:56] first, second pool had went forth, but
[1:01:59] now for the third pull where Christ
[1:02:01] himself, who's been there through every
[1:02:03] pool, is revealing himself. Why is he
[1:02:07] revealing himself? Because the promise
[1:02:09] is there is a bride that is to make
[1:02:13] herself ready
[1:02:16] and a marriage of the lamb to come. So
[1:02:19] the bridegroom must reveal himself. And
[1:02:23] how does he reveal himself? By his word.
[1:02:31] Naomi told her he's one of our near
[1:02:35] kinsmen.
[1:02:37] Hallelujah. And Ruth says, "Well, he
[1:02:39] told me. He told me to stay fast. This
[1:02:42] is what he told me, Naomi. He told me to
[1:02:44] stay in this field." Hallelujah. That's
[1:02:47] what I'm going to do. He told me I hear
[1:02:48] what you're saying and I and I and I I'm
[1:02:51] I'm listening to that. I'm taking it in.
[1:02:53] But he told me to stay here in his
[1:02:54] field. He told me to walk by the rest of
[1:02:56] the maidens. Listen, there were others
[1:02:58] that were also widows. Yeah.
[1:03:02] But they didn't have the promise that
[1:03:04] Ruth had. Yes, that is so good. She was
[1:03:07] one out of a million.
[1:03:11] Are you hearing me? He told me that to
[1:03:14] stay right there close to the young men.
[1:03:17] Hallelujah. Naomi encouraged her and
[1:03:19] said, "Don't you go to another field.
[1:03:22] Don't you move. Don't you leave outside
[1:03:25] of this land of promise. Don't you leave
[1:03:28] from where the place where in this land
[1:03:31] it will bring you into adoption." You
[1:03:33] know, that's what the prophet tells us.
[1:03:35] When Cain walked out of the presence of
[1:03:38] God, the Bible said he went to the land
[1:03:41] of Nod, which is a land of wondering.
[1:03:43] The prophet said he left the land of
[1:03:45] adoption.
[1:03:47] He left the place that could actually
[1:03:50] bring forth. You see, Cain, Cain, God
[1:03:53] gave Cain an opportunity. It wasn't
[1:03:55] going to change Cain. He'd still be
[1:03:56] Cain, right? But if you'll do what your
[1:03:59] brother's doing Yeah.
[1:04:02] That's right. I'll be accepted. Right.
[1:04:05] It was going to make him an elect seat.
[1:04:07] But but if he did, he would remain in
[1:04:09] the category that grace has been
[1:04:11] allotted to him and he's received. But
[1:04:14] Cain refused it.
[1:04:17] He took God's grace and mercy and
[1:04:19] spurned it. In other words, as the
[1:04:21] prophet said, spit it back in God's
[1:04:23] face.
[1:04:25] Now, I want you to remember the prophet
[1:04:27] said, he had a church. He paid tithes,
[1:04:29] paid offerings. He said, "And Cain
[1:04:31] humbled himself, but he only had a
[1:04:34] certain level of humility he could come
[1:04:36] to. He couldn't come to the place where
[1:04:40] he would humble himself to the word of
[1:04:43] God."
[1:04:45] Cain could humble himself to orders and
[1:04:47] rights and this, but he couldn't humble
[1:04:50] himself to the revealed word. You know
[1:04:52] what it is? He couldn't just stand there
[1:04:53] and say, "You know what? I don't
[1:04:54] understand this, but I see God's
[1:04:56] presence vindicating Abel." But you know
[1:04:58] what it did? It showed that spirit that
[1:05:00] was there. It showed who his father was.
[1:05:02] It was the same thing that took place in
[1:05:05] heaven. He got jealous.
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:09] Jealousy. Where did it start? At the
[1:05:11] house of God.
[1:05:13] He saw God vindicate.
[1:05:16] Abel sacrifice.
[1:05:19] Oh, it should have been a rejoicing.
[1:05:22] Thank God I was in the wrong, but I see
[1:05:25] God's provided way.
[1:05:28] But instead his pride rose up. He could
[1:05:32] not submit himself and say, "I was
[1:05:36] wrong."
[1:05:38] You know what that did? That choice only
[1:05:41] showed what was in him. Are you hearing
[1:05:44] me? That choice that Abel made, Abel
[1:05:46] made that choice. It was not God putting
[1:05:49] the lamb in his hands. God revealed
[1:05:52] himself to Abel and Abel became under
[1:05:55] the influence of that revelation and
[1:05:58] made a decision to do what? Whatsoever
[1:06:01] the son seeth the father doing that
[1:06:03] doeth the son likewise.
[1:06:06] He came under that influence and now
[1:06:08] what happened in in what was displayed
[1:06:11] in works what became visual was actually
[1:06:14] what was in the unseen realm was
[1:06:16] becoming visible. Hallelujah. What was a
[1:06:19] vision was now becoming material.
[1:06:23] Are you with me? Now look at this here
[1:06:26] just for a moment. And this this this
[1:06:29] little portion the effect of a momentous
[1:06:32] decision. I want to just this is where
[1:06:35] it was just so resonating on my heart
[1:06:37] here in looking at these things with the
[1:06:39] decisions and how you remember this when
[1:06:43] uh Danny Henry in 1961 February the
[1:06:46] spirit of God moved down and Danny Danny
[1:06:49] Henry began to speak in an unknown
[1:06:51] tongue and um then there was one who
[1:06:55] interpreted and another confirmed it and
[1:06:58] this is what came forth in that men's
[1:07:03] breakfast.
[1:07:04] Now, brother Brandham, here he is. He's
[1:07:07] just reciting it what had been wrote
[1:07:09] down. Because thou hast chosen the
[1:07:13] narrow path, the harder way.
[1:07:18] Thou hast walked in your own choosing.
[1:07:23] Now, I want you to notice the spirit of
[1:07:25] God is commending the prophet. You have
[1:07:28] chosen this.
[1:07:32] That's so good. Thou hast walked in your
[1:07:35] own choosing, not forced. Think back to
[1:07:39] the message on Thursday. It's not God
[1:07:41] forcing things down our way. You've made
[1:07:44] this choice.
[1:07:47] Thou hast picked the correct and precise
[1:07:50] decision and it's my way.
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. Because of this momentous
[1:07:58] decision. Notice because of this. How
[1:08:01] many knows there's effects for our
[1:08:02] decisions?
[1:08:04] Listen, the prophet tells us when he'll
[1:08:06] take us to predestination each time he
[1:08:09] goes right back to that that was in Levi
[1:08:11] and how that or and Abraham when Abraham
[1:08:14] met Melzdc and Levi it was allotted to
[1:08:16] Levi that he paid tithe while he was in
[1:08:19] the the loins of his grandfather
[1:08:22] Abraham. Amen. That's why brother
[1:08:24] Brandon will take that throughout the
[1:08:26] message and he says see even your
[1:08:28] attitude
[1:08:30] towards the Lord Jesus towards the word
[1:08:33] of God will have an effect on your
[1:08:36] grandchildren.
[1:08:37] That's right. This is why it has an
[1:08:40] effect. The choices we make.
[1:08:44] Sometimes you know parents don't like
[1:08:46] seeing certain things within their
[1:08:48] children but you have to be able to be
[1:08:50] able to be very honest. We must be
[1:08:52] honest and say, "Has that been a
[1:08:55] characteristic displayed in my life?"
[1:08:59] And then all they're doing is is
[1:09:01] mirroring, reflecting an image because
[1:09:04] listen, we're not following words. We're
[1:09:06] following an image. Amen. And that image
[1:09:09] is Jesus Christ.
[1:09:12] That's real leadership. Yes, it is. Are
[1:09:14] you hearing me? Millions have this
[1:09:17] Bible. Yes, sir. But without the Holy
[1:09:20] Spirit,
[1:09:22] who was sent to be the lead and guide
[1:09:24] who is the author.
[1:09:27] That's why the prophet said they've been
[1:09:29] arguing about this and we need to know
[1:09:31] this language and this language. He said
[1:09:33] it's going to take more in this hour
[1:09:35] than a student comparing verse to verse.
[1:09:39] That's all good. He said, but it's going
[1:09:40] to take the Holy Spirit, the author of
[1:09:43] the book to come and reveal this book.
[1:09:48] Let me tell you when the seals were
[1:09:50] open, it was not another man. It was not
[1:09:52] a seminary. It was God himself who came
[1:09:56] down.
[1:09:58] Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] And that's why the prophet could say the
[1:10:02] lamb is standing here tonight with the
[1:10:05] book in his hand and he's beginning to
[1:10:07] reveal the contents of it. That's right.
[1:10:10] That's right.
[1:10:14] Amen. My I really I just feel like
[1:10:16] really really moving on. But I so good
[1:10:21] because of this momentous decision.
[1:10:24] Brother Ram had decisions all through
[1:10:26] his life. Let me just pause here for a
[1:10:28] moment. Did brother Brandham make some
[1:10:29] decisions that were wrong? Yes. Remember
[1:10:32] when he had this was not known but he
[1:10:35] realized it. Those men that made out his
[1:10:37] itinerary in South Africa he paid he
[1:10:40] paid for it. Not those men. He paid for
[1:10:43] it with that amoeba in his stomach.
[1:10:47] Is that right? He paid for it. You see,
[1:10:49] God was training. He was training.
[1:10:52] That's right. His prophet. But see, God
[1:10:54] allowed those glimpses to be shown for
[1:10:56] you and I. How that even through you and
[1:10:58] I, there's decisions we can make. And it
[1:11:01] isn't when those decisions are made.
[1:11:03] Well, there's nothing to it. There will
[1:11:04] be suffering. But you know what it does?
[1:11:07] It's just like when you and I have made
[1:11:08] the wrong decision when we were a child.
[1:11:11] What did our fathers do? that corrected
[1:11:13] us and there was a little bit of
[1:11:14] suffering for a period of time but what
[1:11:16] did it do in the long range vision? It
[1:11:19] corrected our actions.
[1:11:22] Amen. See, God's not God's not consumed
[1:11:26] with temporary.
[1:11:27] He's eternal, right? Our little our
[1:11:30] sufferings and things that that we go
[1:11:32] through the correction, it's all for
[1:11:35] this of the eternal
[1:11:38] because of this momentous decision. and
[1:11:40] he received the correction of the Lord.
[1:11:46] Brother Brandham, remember when he was
[1:11:47] doing the miracle lines and I referred
[1:11:48] to that a few Thursdays ago. Here he
[1:11:50] was, he was bringing your hardest case
[1:11:51] first and doing this and and and the
[1:11:53] angel of the Lord, Brother Bram says, he
[1:11:56] hasn't spoke to me in six months.
[1:11:59] Six months.
[1:12:01] I want you to think of this. I want you
[1:12:03] to think of this. Hadn't spoke to me in
[1:12:04] six months. And yet there was miracles
[1:12:06] taking place night after night. Wow. I
[1:12:09] want you to weigh this carefully.
[1:12:12] Notice what was burdening the prophet's
[1:12:15] heart. You see, hear from him. You see
[1:12:19] what what's the value? The value is not
[1:12:21] miracles.
[1:12:22] We believe in miracles. No, following
[1:12:24] the word, miracles will happen. You take
[1:12:27] the word. When when when the little
[1:12:28] woman here, she only had uh that of a
[1:12:31] meal and a little bit of cruc. She
[1:12:33] followed the word and the miracle
[1:12:34] followed the word. They ran out of wine.
[1:12:37] They filled up the vessels with water.
[1:12:39] The miracle followed the obedience. The
[1:12:42] Bible said, "Repent and be baptized in
[1:12:44] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:12:46] remission of your sin." And the miracle
[1:12:48] of the gift of the Holy Ghost will
[1:12:49] follow. The miracle follows the word.
[1:12:51] That's why the prophet said God never
[1:12:54] stressed the miracles. He stressed the
[1:12:57] word. Because if we get in the word and
[1:12:59] follow the word, miracles will follow
[1:13:01] the word.
[1:13:06] Because of this momentous decision, a
[1:13:10] huge portion of heaven will await thee.
[1:13:13] I'll tell you that's not just something
[1:13:15] we're coming to. We have received of the
[1:13:20] fullness of this word.
[1:13:23] Brother and sister, I know that's a
[1:13:25] mouthful. And I tell you, it becomes
[1:13:27] more precious to it. But to understand
[1:13:29] what God has granted to you and I
[1:13:32] through the revealing of this hour, is
[1:13:34] it something that we in ourselves have
[1:13:36] deserved? Not at all. Is it anything
[1:13:38] that we have merited in our own life?
[1:13:41] No. But what is it? And what has it
[1:13:43] been? It's been the divine grace of God
[1:13:47] that has influenced our hearts to choose
[1:13:52] him.
[1:13:55] That's what it is. And you know what?
[1:13:57] When this life is over, we got a body
[1:14:00] over yonder.
[1:14:03] This is an age.
[1:14:06] They have the clarity of this of this
[1:14:07] age. It was promised in this hour.
[1:14:11] What is what a glorious decision thou
[1:14:15] hast made. Yes,
[1:14:18] this in itself is that which will make
[1:14:20] come to pass the tremendous victory in
[1:14:23] the love divine. Let me just let me just
[1:14:25] try to let me just bring this bring it
[1:14:27] down to a couple points here.
[1:14:30] It could have been very easy for the
[1:14:33] prophet to have made a decision
[1:14:35] as many said, "Why don't you take this
[1:14:37] out in the nerve centers? Get out there
[1:14:39] in the big places and and on TV." Right?
[1:14:43] He could have done that. But you
[1:14:44] remember remember remember what they
[1:14:46] wanted. That's right. Well, if you'll
[1:14:48] just kind of compromise on a little bit
[1:14:50] of things. He said, "What do you call
[1:14:52] little?"
[1:14:55] What do you call little? You see, notice
[1:14:58] every word is just as important.
[1:15:03] Amen. Are you hearing me? Malachi 4 is
[1:15:07] just as important as John 3. Without
[1:15:09] Malachi 4, you can't see John 3 in the
[1:15:12] right way. That's right.
[1:15:13] Amen. Right. It's the same way. And the
[1:15:16] same way that Malachi 4, John 3,
[1:15:19] Ephesians 5 is important. That's good.
[1:15:21] So all the word, that's why the Bible
[1:15:23] said, "Whosoever shall add to the word
[1:15:25] or take away from it, it may not cut it
[1:15:27] out of the Bible, but to overemphasize
[1:15:30] or deemphasize is the same thing."
[1:15:35] Because it all should see Jesus Christ.
[1:15:38] Not because like brother Ramble say, not
[1:15:40] because I had to do it, right? Not
[1:15:42] because you were made to do it. That's
[1:15:44] right. You're not made to serve God. We
[1:15:47] all remember even as as children when
[1:15:50] here we come well maybe not all of us
[1:15:52] you know but whatever you were in maybe
[1:15:53] you were you know in a in a Pentecostal
[1:15:55] church or whatever more but you remember
[1:15:57] having you you're going to church and
[1:15:58] you're going through you really didn't
[1:15:59] want to go to church.
[1:16:01] you. Now listen, a relationship,
[1:16:05] a relationship, mom and dad, a
[1:16:06] relationship will cause and lead the
[1:16:10] children even when things they don't
[1:16:12] want to do out of respect for you,
[1:16:14] they'll do it. That's a tremendous
[1:16:16] thing. That's a tremendous thing. That
[1:16:19] that's a tremendous application. But we
[1:16:22] don't want to take that and call that
[1:16:24] the token. Amen. Brother Brandham's own
[1:16:28] nephew. Listen in the message paradox.
[1:16:30] It doesn't say it, but that's who that
[1:16:32] is. When his his own nephew, and
[1:16:35] remember the situation that took place
[1:16:37] between him and his girl and everything
[1:16:39] else, and here the father,
[1:16:42] brother Brandham's brother Brandham's uh
[1:16:44] uh brother-in-law, well, my son, my
[1:16:46] son's been born again. He's he's been
[1:16:48] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Uh
[1:16:50] he's he's been to the altar. Brother
[1:16:52] Bram said, that is vine and good. He has
[1:16:55] been brought in fellowship as far as
[1:16:57] with the rest of the saints that are at
[1:16:59] the local assembly. He said, "But until
[1:17:02] that man," he said, "Look at your own
[1:17:04] life. This is how you are as Germans.
[1:17:06] This is how your family is." He said,
[1:17:07] "But you're not like that. What is it
[1:17:09] that changed that in your life? It's the
[1:17:11] Holy Ghost." And he said, "That young
[1:17:13] man in his life, he can try within all
[1:17:17] of his intellects to overcome that, but
[1:17:19] he can't overcome his first birth.
[1:17:22] There's got to be a new birth.
[1:17:26] And that he said when that takes place,
[1:17:29] that'll be a paradox in that young man's
[1:17:31] life. And then he's already overcome.
[1:17:36] Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] Hallelujah. Yes. See, it's a momentous
[1:17:41] decision. It's choices
[1:17:44] that are being led.
[1:17:46] Not that I had to do this. Moses Moses
[1:17:48] made a choice. Every one of us have a
[1:17:50] choice. Listen friends, let me just be
[1:17:52] very very very very uh uh forthright and
[1:17:55] frank. We don't come in here and leave
[1:17:57] the same way. Every one of us, God is
[1:18:00] drawing upon our lives to make a choice.
[1:18:03] Oh, I appreciate his presence. I
[1:18:05] appreciate the services. But what choice
[1:18:08] is being made?
[1:18:10] Amen.
[1:18:14] See, we're all forced to make a
[1:18:15] decision. When the Lord Jesus, the word
[1:18:17] was being made flesh, they were forced
[1:18:19] to make a decision. Moses had to make a
[1:18:22] decision.
[1:18:24] And God comes forward to influence our
[1:18:27] lives to make the right decision.
[1:18:32] Do we? He comes forth to guide us. Like
[1:18:35] brother Trevor was talking about there.
[1:18:37] I love that. So I love that because it's
[1:18:40] it's God right there with us. He's not
[1:18:43] forcing us and making us and and doing
[1:18:45] this, but it's God leading us, right?
[1:18:48] Because you know what? You know what
[1:18:50] will drive sin and the world out of our
[1:18:53] heart is the word of God. That's being
[1:18:57] in his presence. This is what Think
[1:19:00] about this. God is a faithful father. He
[1:19:03] don't try to He don't try to intimidate
[1:19:04] us. He don't try to, you know, come out.
[1:19:07] Listen, he has a standard. Don't Don't
[1:19:08] get me wrong. He has a standard. He has
[1:19:10] a word. There's there's things that he
[1:19:11] has laid down in his house. His house is
[1:19:13] just not a a house that's full of every
[1:19:15] hateful and unclean bird.
[1:19:18] All right. That's that's not him. But he
[1:19:21] has standards. But there's a standard
[1:19:23] that's kept. But all the time he's
[1:19:25] working with us. His presence is moving
[1:19:27] on our life to draw us into that place
[1:19:29] of making a decision. And not just a
[1:19:32] decision of savior, but the decision
[1:19:34] Ruth laboring in the field. The decision
[1:19:36] to move on in. decision to submit to the
[1:19:40] leading of the word as Naomi is
[1:19:42] directing her into that of to request
[1:19:47] that of the kinsman right be fulfilled.
[1:19:51] I want you to think of this here.
[1:19:54] every one of our choices, decisions that
[1:19:57] are being made. You realize we spoke
[1:20:00] here a few weeks ago on lamp trimming
[1:20:02] time that the wise that was a result of
[1:20:06] her making choices. You say, "Well, she
[1:20:09] was elect and ordained." That's true.
[1:20:11] But she came under the influence of the
[1:20:13] word of God. And she she did, you know
[1:20:15] what? For her, she didn't take an
[1:20:16] offense. Now, it might have taken some
[1:20:18] period of time for maybe that was wise
[1:20:20] and she was acting foolish and she only
[1:20:22] had the the Holy Spirit upon her spirit,
[1:20:25] but it had to go deeper. It had to come
[1:20:28] to where it was oil in the vessel
[1:20:30] because the foolish virgin had oil and
[1:20:33] it ran out. That's right. See, it it
[1:20:35] wasn't sealed in. It could run out after
[1:20:38] a period of time. They shined the light
[1:20:40] of of salvation. They shined the light
[1:20:42] of sanctification, right? But it wasn't
[1:20:45] sealed in them. That's the promise of
[1:20:48] the Holy Spirit. It's got to be more.
[1:20:50] That's why the prophet said you can have
[1:20:51] it on your spirit every hour and moment
[1:20:54] of your life and still be lost and go to
[1:20:57] hell. You say, "What must it be?" It's
[1:20:59] got to come down to your soul and it'll
[1:21:02] change your nature
[1:21:04] to where then it becomes Jesus Christ.
[1:21:07] the same the same nature the same
[1:21:09] character the same life the same works
[1:21:12] his living presence in your life
[1:21:18] let me tell you with decisions you have
[1:21:19] to make sometimes the very people that
[1:21:22] you continue to hang around with are the
[1:21:23] very people that are holding you back
[1:21:28] you lay down on a on a on a dog's bed
[1:21:30] that's got fleas you're going to get
[1:21:32] fleas that's right
[1:21:35] you got to make a decision
[1:21:37] Come on. I'm speaking to all levels here
[1:21:39] this morning. You got decisions to make.
[1:21:41] And the decision itself, it was hard for
[1:21:44] Abraham, but God by his divine grace
[1:21:47] allowed situations to come about that
[1:21:50] would give Abraham grace to separate
[1:21:53] from Lot. Because listen, if you if God
[1:21:56] has called you and he didn't call you to
[1:21:59] separate, then you might want to check
[1:22:01] your call, right?
[1:22:03] Because when God calls, he calls for
[1:22:05] separation.
[1:22:07] He calls you to separate because your
[1:22:09] old associates will only drag you back
[1:22:12] down.
[1:22:14] Are you hearing me?
[1:22:16] Now, you have to go beyond the veil. Let
[1:22:18] me just I I told you I want to I want to
[1:22:20] tie this up here.
[1:22:23] Don't worry, I've got my time here.
[1:22:25] I got a few moments.
[1:22:28] I'm right in with where I started on
[1:22:29] Israel before, but that that was all
[1:22:31] free. But I want you to catch this
[1:22:35] here. She says, "I am Ruth, a handmade."
[1:22:38] I I'm not going to get to this to to one
[1:22:40] of the parts here today, but she's she's
[1:22:43] she's coming into this of I'm Ruth a
[1:22:46] handmade. Naomi said, "I'm going to seek
[1:22:49] a place of rest for you." And I want you
[1:22:52] to think of this.
[1:22:54] I I would love to deal with that here
[1:22:55] this morning, but I just want to move
[1:22:56] over that into this into this place here
[1:23:00] of of of verse 10. We'll come back. And
[1:23:03] he said, because when she said there in
[1:23:06] verse in verse 9, I am Ruth thine
[1:23:09] handmmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt
[1:23:11] over thine handmade for thou art a near
[1:23:15] kinsman.
[1:23:17] You realize the same word that's used
[1:23:19] right here for skirt. I didn't put that
[1:23:21] up there for you, but the same word for
[1:23:23] skirt is the same word I read to you
[1:23:25] moments ago where it says, "Under whose
[1:23:27] wings thou are come to trust." You see,
[1:23:31] her journey had went from wings to
[1:23:34] coming under his curtain. Her his wings
[1:23:38] was lifting. I bore you on eagle's
[1:23:39] wings. On and on we could go. In the
[1:23:42] book of Ezekiel, God spreads his
[1:23:44] curtain. You know what this is? It's all
[1:23:45] a custom of that which to take the
[1:23:48] reproach.
[1:23:50] Yeah. to spread that over. You know, the
[1:23:53] scourge is a type of the Holy Spirit.
[1:23:56] But after he's seen the confidence, but
[1:23:58] let me just let me just say this. After
[1:24:00] he's seen that confidence, her faith
[1:24:03] when she's coming to him, she has been
[1:24:05] in his presence for many weeks.
[1:24:09] Barley harvest, wheat harvest, she's
[1:24:12] been in his presence. She knows him to
[1:24:15] be a righteous man. She has the utmost
[1:24:18] confidence in him. That's so good. And
[1:24:22] she's led to the place to lay down at
[1:24:25] his feet. Mark that place. And when she
[1:24:29] asked of him, she listen to me. I want
[1:24:31] you to think of this. Look at the age
[1:24:33] here. He's 80. She's 40.
[1:24:36] Wow. What I mean, when you look at that,
[1:24:38] I mean, what 40-year-old goes chasing
[1:24:40] down? Not no offense to any 80-year-old,
[1:24:41] but what what 40-year-old? You see what
[1:24:44] I'm saying? You see why brother Ram
[1:24:45] always make that kind of little bit of a
[1:24:46] of a prod there regarding with uh uh
[1:24:49] Abraham and Sarah and there in the king
[1:24:51] of ger he says you know what which one's
[1:24:53] going to say oh grandma no it's not
[1:24:56] going to happen that way God changed
[1:24:58] them back
[1:25:00] are you with me God changed them back
[1:25:03] but this is what I'm showing to you that
[1:25:04] here he is that that for her notice her
[1:25:07] testimony she has been tested in the
[1:25:11] time of harvest
[1:25:14] During the time of harvest, she has been
[1:25:16] tested. God Boaz didn't put her in a
[1:25:20] bubble. Boaz didn't lock her away in her
[1:25:22] house and say, "Don't you come out here.
[1:25:23] There's a lot of young men." They're
[1:25:25] closer aligned to you
[1:25:28] in age. It's more becoming. He did not
[1:25:32] lock her away cuz she still has the
[1:25:35] choice free moral agency. That's right.
[1:25:38] Her decisions throughout that time of
[1:25:41] harvest is only going to prove the
[1:25:44] virtue that's already been there in the
[1:25:46] beginning. The virtue throughout to
[1:25:48] where that this he comes to her and
[1:25:51] says, "The whole city do know thou art a
[1:25:54] virtuous woman."
[1:25:57] She's been tested. Yeah.
[1:26:00] Let me tell you something. Let me just
[1:26:02] wind it down on this. She's been given,
[1:26:04] offered. If we can bring it in how the
[1:26:06] prophet does in the harvest time,
[1:26:08] supernatural offers.
[1:26:11] Brother Bram says Satan can hand out
[1:26:13] those gifts by the handfuls.
[1:26:16] He can hand out supernatural things and
[1:26:19] people will take the supernatural things
[1:26:22] and fail to take the giver himself.
[1:26:27] Pentecost went after supernatural
[1:26:29] things.
[1:26:31] Pentecost was just, oh my, it's like
[1:26:33] we're like this message. Oh, isn't this
[1:26:34] wonderful? Oh my. When he's a prophet.
[1:26:36] Oh, when when the when everything's
[1:26:38] taking place on the stage and and this
[1:26:40] is happening. Oh, that's a prophet. Oh,
[1:26:42] but watch his teaching. And they failed
[1:26:44] to recognize the teaching was the field.
[1:26:48] That was the field. And the Lord of the
[1:26:51] harvest had descended.
[1:26:54] The Lord of the harvest. Notice Boaz
[1:26:57] when he came and descended, he came to
[1:26:59] the chief reaper.
[1:27:02] And when that mighty angel descended in
[1:27:04] Revelations 10, he came to his prophet.
[1:27:07] Hallelujah. To the chief reaper, to the
[1:27:10] messenger of this age. Amen. Who is this
[1:27:13] woman? It's bride time. It It's time to
[1:27:16] declare this word. There's a bride on
[1:27:18] the scene.
[1:27:20] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:24] It was choices.
[1:27:26] Let me just close there.
[1:27:29] She's tested. You see this bride,
[1:27:31] brother Bram tells us, God of this evil
[1:27:33] age, she's to be tested by an every word
[1:27:36] experience. See, friends, this is where
[1:27:39] we don't want to take anything for
[1:27:40] granted. I'm not causing I'm not causing
[1:27:42] you to question yourself, but I think as
[1:27:44] the bride of Jesus Christ, knowing the
[1:27:47] bride as being a part of it, it's a time
[1:27:50] of reflection.
[1:27:52] It's a time to reflect in our life, the
[1:27:54] Bible said that we would judge ourselves
[1:27:56] that we should not be judged, right?
[1:27:58] that we allow the word we we take to
[1:28:00] what we're seeing in the word and allow
[1:28:02] the word to come through our lives. So
[1:28:04] you can be tested with a lot of things.
[1:28:06] You can be tested with you can be pulled
[1:28:08] here can be pulled here. Listen friends,
[1:28:10] how how many people how many from right
[1:28:12] gathered in this field and there's been
[1:28:14] ministries that have come into this
[1:28:16] field and the only reason they came in
[1:28:18] this field was to lead people out of the
[1:28:19] field. Hallelujah. And because lives
[1:28:23] were not were not drawn to God. They
[1:28:28] follow. And if that man goes off, they
[1:28:30] go off with that man. They go off here.
[1:28:32] They go off there. They go off there.
[1:28:34] Listen, sometimes it's not even
[1:28:35] preachers. Sometimes people follow lay
[1:28:37] people.
[1:28:38] But let me tell you, whoever you're
[1:28:40] following, the Bible says in in Hebrews
[1:28:42] chapter 3 or 13:7 before verse 8, it
[1:28:46] said, "Remember them that have the rule
[1:28:47] over you whose faith follow considering
[1:28:51] the end of their conversation." That's
[1:28:53] their character and that's their
[1:28:54] conduct. That's so good. If what they're
[1:28:58] saying doesn't match the conduct and the
[1:29:00] character through their life, don't
[1:29:03] follow it. That's right. Paul said, "You
[1:29:06] follow me as I follow Christ." Then
[1:29:08] you're not following a man. You're
[1:29:10] following the living word of God. You're
[1:29:13] following the character of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:16] And that'll lead you through every test.
[1:29:18] It'll lead you through every trial. No
[1:29:21] matter how things could pull upon your
[1:29:24] flesh and pull upon your spirit, no
[1:29:26] matter how many young men are around or
[1:29:29] how many maidens, I'm here for one
[1:29:32] purpose.
[1:29:34] And this is why. Can't you see this is
[1:29:37] why Satan loves to try to get in and try
[1:29:40] to break try to break us away from
[1:29:42] divine fellowship?
[1:29:45] Is that right? The prophet says he likes
[1:29:47] to get one isolated and out away. Look,
[1:29:49] you can sit right here and be isolated
[1:29:50] from the whole body. That's right, but
[1:29:52] let me just tell you, the Holy Spirit
[1:29:53] isn't isolating you. If he is, he's
[1:29:56] working he's he's working in in in in uh
[1:29:59] uh he's not working in harmony with his
[1:30:00] word. But he will always separate us
[1:30:03] unto the word. Is that right, sir? Lord,
[1:30:06] I want to be separated from the If
[1:30:07] there's anybody I want to be separated
[1:30:09] from, I want to be separated more from
[1:30:10] Samuel.
[1:30:12] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That that
[1:30:14] that's who I want to be separated from.
[1:30:16] He's he's he's the guy that's my
[1:30:17] problem. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:30:20] But let's Oh God, let's make decisions.
[1:30:25] How many say Lord? Amen. That's what I
[1:30:27] want. Amen. I want to make decisions.
[1:30:30] And I don't want to just it's not just
[1:30:32] making a decisions, but it's becoming
[1:30:34] under that divine influence. Where is
[1:30:35] God drawing upon your heart? You see,
[1:30:37] friends, that's why within this, it's
[1:30:39] not it's not a man threatening. That's
[1:30:43] this this this message is not a
[1:30:45] conformatory. It's not a conforming. Are
[1:30:48] you hearing me? You can Oh, you know
[1:30:50] where they they teach on dress. Listen,
[1:30:52] listen, listen, listen. Brother Brown
[1:30:54] covers this in 1950. I think it's 1958,
[1:30:57] the baptism of the Holy Spirit when he
[1:30:58] preaches those three series, why we're
[1:31:00] not a denomination, baptism, Holy
[1:31:01] Spirit, the serpency, and he talks about
[1:31:03] he say people can dress right to the
[1:31:05] point. Now, he's not taking away as
[1:31:07] though that that's not virtuous, but
[1:31:08] he's dealing with sometimes down on the
[1:31:11] inside.
[1:31:13] He says they could still be some of the
[1:31:14] biggest gossip.
[1:31:16] He's dealing with what's on the inside.
[1:31:19] That's what God come to do. If we get
[1:31:21] the inside right, the outside will take
[1:31:22] care of itself. It'll only reflect
[1:31:24] whatever whatever choices on the inside
[1:31:26] will reflect to the outside. That's what
[1:31:29] the Holy Spirit has come to do to
[1:31:32] influence our life. Not just to come
[1:31:34] into a place and say, "My, this is man,
[1:31:37] this is so wonderful. My the presence of
[1:31:39] God, my the atmosphere." It's God coming
[1:31:42] to influence us. Amen. Because remember,
[1:31:46] let me close on this point. I know I've
[1:31:48] been saying I'm closing, but
[1:31:49] predestination,
[1:31:50] brother Ram says this in two places.
[1:31:53] It's not God pushing you through. That's
[1:31:57] right. And pulling you through. Amen.
[1:32:00] Predestination looks forward to
[1:32:03] fornowledge.
[1:32:04] Amen. And God knows the decision that
[1:32:08] you and I would make. That's right.
[1:32:11] He said, "Now, the word didn't never
[1:32:12] said,"I predestinate William Brandham."
[1:32:15] He said, "But the word has said that the
[1:32:18] church is predestinated."
[1:32:20] And he said, "I'm predestinated as long
[1:32:23] as I'm in that church." Brother
[1:32:25] Brandham, do you believe you're going to
[1:32:26] be there? He says, "As long as I'm in
[1:32:27] that church." He's not talking about
[1:32:28] this building. The church is the body of
[1:32:32] Jesus Christ. That's 1 Corinthians 12.
[1:32:35] That's what we strive for is for the
[1:32:37] Holy Spirit coming into that place of
[1:32:39] rest. If you if you haven't received
[1:32:41] that, let that be the goal. Let that be
[1:32:45] let that be the direction for your life
[1:32:47] that Lord, I I don't want to just I
[1:32:49] don't want to just labor here in the
[1:32:51] field and laboring and toiling and weary
[1:32:54] against sin. I want to enter into rest.
[1:32:56] I want to enter into that place of rest
[1:32:58] to where I cease from my works. I want
[1:33:01] to in that place of rest, Lord, I want
[1:33:05] to make decisions in that place of rest
[1:33:07] to do what? Make myself available to
[1:33:10] you. Why? That his life might be
[1:33:13] reproduced in my life. Is that what you
[1:33:16] want? Amen. Lord, I want to make
[1:33:17] decisions. I don't want to just I don't
[1:33:19] want to just have an association, right?
[1:33:22] But I want to I want to abide under your
[1:33:23] presence. Because you know what? As you
[1:33:24] abide under his presence, you know what
[1:33:26] happens? There's fruit that comes out of
[1:33:28] your life. It's fruit that can only be
[1:33:31] brought from being in rest with him. And
[1:33:35] that fruit coming forth in your life
[1:33:37] like it did out of Aaron's rod, it
[1:33:40] settles disputes. It settles questions.
[1:33:43] It silences voices.
[1:33:46] That's what the fruit of God does in
[1:33:49] your life.
[1:33:50] Lord, I want to be more like you.
[1:33:53] Musicians, will you come? I want to be
[1:33:55] more like you. Lord, I want to be more
[1:33:58] like you. Yes, I want the Holy Spirit
[1:34:00] that the the the dove of God, the angel
[1:34:03] of the Lord, Lord, just influence us,
[1:34:06] direct us, Lord, guide us, lead us,
[1:34:09] Lord, draw us closer. Draw me nearer,
[1:34:12] Lord. I want to be drawn closer.
[1:34:15] Because, you know, he's he's leading us.
[1:34:18] He's leading us into himself. Amen. To
[1:34:22] become more and more like him. You know,
[1:34:26] you you get around sometime and we were
[1:34:28] talking about this, not my wife and I,
[1:34:30] but somebody they were talking about
[1:34:31] this and we were in South Carolina. He
[1:34:33] said, "You ever notice after so long a
[1:34:34] time, you know, a husband and wife, you
[1:34:36] start looking like one another?" I said,
[1:34:37] "If she looks like me, man, I feel sorry
[1:34:39] for her."
[1:34:42] But but to understand
[1:34:44] that, you know, you you you you know one
[1:34:46] another's ways, right? You begin to know
[1:34:49] one another's ways, right? You begin to
[1:34:51] know uh how to how to speak. you begin
[1:34:54] to know the things that that mean
[1:34:56] something, the things that are so
[1:34:59] personable. You know, think about this.
[1:35:02] The Bible says the earth is the Lord's
[1:35:05] and the fullness thereof.
[1:35:08] He all of his great majesty, the beauty.
[1:35:10] I mean, there's some beautiful places
[1:35:12] even now when it's not in its edic
[1:35:15] beauty. There's some beautiful places
[1:35:16] you can go to now. Yeah.
[1:35:19] But to think that God himself
[1:35:23] has he spent all of that, put it all
[1:35:25] within its its place
[1:35:28] and he owns it all. Right? And you can
[1:35:31] look and say, "What could I give him?
[1:35:34] What can I give him? What can I It's
[1:35:36] like that little woman who was on the
[1:35:38] ranch. She was tattered garments and all
[1:35:41] the others had nice gowns. They were in
[1:35:43] the actual ball and she's out here with
[1:35:46] dishwater.
[1:35:49] stuff all over.
[1:35:51] You see, he looked beyond all of those
[1:35:55] forms.
[1:35:57] No doubt he was so, oh my, will there be
[1:36:01] a bride? Is there a bride? And he sees
[1:36:05] this little woman and he's watching her.
[1:36:09] Look what she's doing. She's She doesn't
[1:36:11] have as far as the elegance out here as
[1:36:14] far as these maybe this fine gold a
[1:36:17] bracelet and man this nice embroidered
[1:36:20] dress. She doesn't have all of that and
[1:36:22] maybe her hair fixed just right.
[1:36:25] But what he looks and sees is character.
[1:36:30] He forsook all the forms of godliness
[1:36:34] and said,
[1:36:36] "Who are you?
[1:36:39] Me? Me?"
[1:36:43] He said, "I want you to be my bride. Me,
[1:36:47] me, I don't know about you, but I still
[1:36:51] feel that way.
[1:36:53] Me, me, Lord. You know, you find
[1:36:56] yourself pinching yourself. This this
[1:36:58] word, this word as it comes forth that
[1:37:01] God, your grace, your mercy, me, I keep,
[1:37:04] you keep pinching yourself.
[1:37:07] That's so true. But you never chose me.
[1:37:10] I chose you. Right. Right. Right? So he
[1:37:13] submits his choice
[1:37:16] across her life. He submitted his choice
[1:37:19] across our life. Now we had an
[1:37:21] opportunity whether to accept it or
[1:37:25] reject it.
[1:37:28] No doubt has he has had to move
[1:37:30] throughout our lives like it was with
[1:37:31] Gideon. Remember what Gideon said? My
[1:37:33] family, me, my family is the smallest of
[1:37:36] Manasseh. He had a complex but that
[1:37:39] complex could not stop or hinder the
[1:37:42] word of God from coming into fruition in
[1:37:44] his life. Yes, sir. Because you know
[1:37:46] what? God wasn't working on his complex.
[1:37:49] God was drawing upon who Gideon really
[1:37:51] was. That's exactly right.
[1:37:54] Gideon had to make. There's things that
[1:37:55] Gideon, he made decisions. Wait, wait,
[1:37:57] don't go away. And you know that. But
[1:38:00] God brought him to that place. That's
[1:38:01] the same thing God doing in our lives.
[1:38:04] You might say, "What could I give him?"
[1:38:07] He owns it all. All right. But you know,
[1:38:09] let me tell you, though he has all of
[1:38:12] this,
[1:38:14] but he was willing to come down and give
[1:38:17] everything for your love.
[1:38:21] He was willing to do it all to redeem
[1:38:24] you and bring you back to himself. He
[1:38:28] was willing to become one of us
[1:38:32] and pay the price that he might bring us
[1:38:35] back to himself. What could I give him?
[1:38:37] your life, your all. Surrender your
[1:38:41] heart to him. Give your life over to
[1:38:44] him.
[1:38:46] And as we continue to give, Lord, what
[1:38:47] what can I give? You know, sometimes the
[1:38:50] things when you don't even feel like
[1:38:52] praying. Anybody ever been there? Sure.
[1:38:55] Don't feel like reading. Don't feel like
[1:38:57] listening to a message. Don't feel like
[1:38:59] this.
[1:39:00] But it's in those moments of sacrifice
[1:39:04] that draws him near. Amen. That's the
[1:39:08] truth. You may not even feel him. You
[1:39:10] may feel like, "M, I've just had to
[1:39:11] press through this." And then the enemy
[1:39:13] gets over on your shoulder and says,
[1:39:14] "Yeah, look at you. You should have a
[1:39:16] heart for this. You should have a love
[1:39:19] for." And you do. That's right. You do.
[1:39:21] That's right. But sometimes
[1:39:24] understanding also dwelling in this
[1:39:26] realm,
[1:39:28] this body
[1:39:30] also doesn't want to do those things
[1:39:32] because the body itself is weak. That's
[1:39:35] right. But this is where as a son of
[1:39:38] God, we're not doing things by feelings.
[1:39:41] Are you hearing me? That's why we don't
[1:39:43] come to church whether we feel like it
[1:39:45] or not. What I I feels like good. Well,
[1:39:47] then if you do it by feelings, there
[1:39:48] going to be times you don't feel like
[1:39:49] coming. There's times I don't feel like
[1:39:52] there's times I don't. Right? Times you
[1:39:55] don't feel like worshiping.
[1:39:57] But it's in those moments when you don't
[1:40:00] feel like it and you think, "What can I
[1:40:01] give him? What can I give him? Amen.
[1:40:05] You're giving him of yourself. Lord, I
[1:40:08] sacrifice my feelings.
[1:40:12] I sacrifice my feelings.
[1:40:16] I want to worship you, Lord.
[1:40:19] Isn't it worth it? Isn't it worth it
[1:40:21] when we can just press beyond that? Oh,
[1:40:24] thank God for his mercy. Let's stand
[1:40:26] together.
[1:40:29] Hallelujah.
[1:40:33] Oh, my
[1:40:35] Let's just go to him in a word of
[1:40:36] prayer.
[1:40:38] I'm sure
[1:40:40] anybody want to be remembered in prayer
[1:40:42] this morning.
[1:40:45] Choices, Lord.
[1:40:47] Let there be choices, Lord. Make a
[1:40:50] choice. Even here this morning, no
[1:40:52] matter where you're at in your walk with
[1:40:54] God, make a choice.
[1:40:57] Make a choice. And I don't just say you
[1:40:58] make a choice, but I'm saying, Lord, let
[1:41:01] there be that influence this morning.
[1:41:03] Let there be such reflection, such
[1:41:05] introspection into our lives to be able
[1:41:08] to evaluate our own lives. Lord, what's
[1:41:11] he saying to you? What's he speaking to
[1:41:13] you?
[1:41:14] Heavenly Father,
[1:41:17] Lord, how we love you this morning. How
[1:41:20] we so appreciate, Lord, your mercies,
[1:41:24] Lord,
[1:41:26] truly they're new every morning,
[1:41:29] Lord. Just little little glimpses that
[1:41:32] we can see here with Ruth.
[1:41:36] Decision, one decision led to another
[1:41:39] decision,
[1:41:41] led her to make another decision.
[1:41:46] Lord Jesus,
[1:41:48] that's the same way it comes down to our
[1:41:50] lives, Lord.
[1:41:52] Lord, we all have choices and decisions
[1:41:54] we've made
[1:41:56] that we're ashamed of, Lord. Oh, they're
[1:41:59] different, Lord, when you've brought us
[1:42:02] to yourself, but yet still the thing,
[1:42:06] Lord, that would be shameful
[1:42:09] is the times that we've missed out.
[1:42:12] Lord, your desire
[1:42:15] to be able to use us.
[1:42:17] I thank Lord God that even in that place
[1:42:20] of relationship how that the dove
[1:42:24] oh God to brood over a lamb.
[1:42:28] Lord Jesus, may you find in our hearts
[1:42:31] this morning lamb nature. Lord,
[1:42:35] your prophet told us, Lord, showing us
[1:42:37] how that we can grieve like Paul would
[1:42:39] write, "Grieve not the spirit of God,
[1:42:43] the Holy Spirit of promise whereby
[1:42:44] you're sealed to the day of redemption."
[1:42:46] Showing that it can be grieved.
[1:42:48] Sometimes, Lord, your prophet tells us
[1:42:50] that grieving, it can take place just by
[1:42:54] our thinking.
[1:42:57] thinking
[1:42:59] towards this, thinking towards that. The
[1:43:02] Holy Spirit is timid. He's a dove.
[1:43:08] I love Lord the direction as your
[1:43:09] prophet would let us know.
[1:43:12] He said he hadn't flown way off. He's
[1:43:14] just out there on a branch.
[1:43:17] He said, "Just waiting on you to become
[1:43:19] a lamb again."
[1:43:21] Lord,
[1:43:23] we want to submit our hearts to you,
[1:43:24] Lord. Tenderize us, Lord.
[1:43:28] Father, through all the callousness of
[1:43:31] the spirits of this age, streams of
[1:43:34] demon power, Lord, coming through all
[1:43:36] forms of media, Lord, places that we go
[1:43:39] and things that we come in contact with,
[1:43:42] but Lord God,
[1:43:45] how we're so thankful, Lord, to be in
[1:43:47] this field.
[1:43:50] I'm thankful, Lord, not only to be in
[1:43:51] this field,
[1:43:53] but Lord, we're thankful that we've
[1:43:56] received
[1:43:59] that leadership
[1:44:01] into the holiest of holies, into that
[1:44:03] place of rest.
[1:44:05] We're thankful, Lord, for your influence
[1:44:07] upon our lives
[1:44:10] to direct us to override our own
[1:44:13] stubborn will, Lord God, to melt down
[1:44:16] our hearts, Lord, with divine love.
[1:44:19] Oh God,
[1:44:21] help us, Lord.
[1:44:24] Help us, Lord.
[1:44:26] Father, as months ago back in September
[1:44:28] when you, Lord, when we paused on this,
[1:44:31] the very last service where we paused
[1:44:33] from,
[1:44:35] was this where Ruth was in that floor,
[1:44:37] that threshing floor?
[1:44:40] Boaz was laying there asleep and resting
[1:44:45] right up near this great heap of
[1:44:49] revealed promises.
[1:44:52] And right there, Lord God,
[1:44:56] right there as you showed us, Lord, the
[1:44:59] pathway,
[1:45:01] it's from your feet
[1:45:03] to the throne.
[1:45:05] The pathway to overcoming leads
[1:45:09] through humility, Lord.
[1:45:11] Submission.
[1:45:13] I thank Lord God of how that Naomi
[1:45:16] instructed Ruth. She never went and told
[1:45:18] Ruth, Ruth, do not plead your cause as a
[1:45:21] victim of circumstances,
[1:45:25] but go there in submission
[1:45:29] as a handmaiden.
[1:45:33] I'm yours, Lord Jesus.
[1:45:37] That's where we're here this morning,
[1:45:39] Lord. I'm yours, Lord, to lay ourselves
[1:45:43] at your disposal.
[1:45:46] I don't want my way, Lord. We don't want
[1:45:48] our ways. We want your way, Lord. Not my
[1:45:51] will, thine will be done, Lord. Oh, God.
[1:45:54] That's where the victory, that's where
[1:45:56] it was really won, Lord, was there in
[1:45:58] the garden of Gethsemane, Lord.
[1:46:01] Oh, Lord Jesus,
[1:46:04] you prayed that three times.
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:09] Calvary
[1:46:11] was the manifestation
[1:46:14] of the victory
[1:46:16] right there
[1:46:18] in Gethsemane.
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:21] Right there. The victory.
[1:46:24] The victory was his own will.
[1:46:27] Lord Jesus,
[1:46:28] I'm so thankful.
[1:46:31] This is where we come. Lord,
[1:46:34] not my will, thine will be done.
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:39] You prayed, "Let this cup pass from me
[1:46:43] if thy will,
[1:46:46] but nevertheless, thy will be done."
[1:46:50] on and on through the scriptures,
[1:46:52] knowing your purpose of coming and when
[1:46:55] it came to that moment
[1:46:58] for that that scripture what was needed
[1:47:02] that crucial moment
[1:47:04] to set that Lord into place. It would
[1:47:08] require
[1:47:10] a dying to self before ever ever
[1:47:16] you died on Calvary before ever. right
[1:47:20] there in Gethsemane.
[1:47:22] That's where the real death took place.
[1:47:26] And Lord Jesus as Gethsemane
[1:47:29] is a type is that of the oil press, the
[1:47:33] garden of Gethsemane. Oh God,
[1:47:36] thinking of it. It was in a garden
[1:47:40] called Eden
[1:47:42] where the fall took place.
[1:47:45] But in that garden of Gethsemane,
[1:47:48] garden being a type of the bride,
[1:47:51] a chosen bedding ground, a place of
[1:47:54] rest, solitude,
[1:47:57] chose to bring forth his his ordained
[1:48:01] predestinated fruits.
[1:48:04] Lord, you're overcoming in this garden.
[1:48:10] Help us, Lord.
[1:48:12] Father, no doubt sitting here this
[1:48:14] morning, there's some, Lord, they've
[1:48:16] made decisions. Maybe some haven't even
[1:48:18] made a decision to really surrender
[1:48:21] their hearts to you. But I pray, God,
[1:48:24] may this be a beginning.
[1:48:26] May this be a beginning of many
[1:48:28] decisions,
[1:48:30] lives, Lord, that Father, as they're
[1:48:33] toiling in the field, may they
[1:48:35] recognize, Lord, that that's that's
[1:48:36] that's not
[1:48:40] all that you have for them.
[1:48:43] You want to put them to rest. You want
[1:48:45] to drive away that weariness, Lord, of
[1:48:49] them laboring against sin to where,
[1:48:51] Lord, it's you coming on the inside,
[1:48:55] changing that very nature, Lord, and
[1:48:57] living your life out through them, Lord.
[1:49:00] Grant it, Lord. Give strength to those,
[1:49:01] Lord, that they can realize there's
[1:49:04] associates that's pulling on their
[1:49:05] lives. Not that the people themselves as
[1:49:08] far as individuals wouldn't necessarily
[1:49:10] be bad, but Lord God, the company,
[1:49:13] the people that they're around,
[1:49:16] it weakens them. Takes right away that
[1:49:20] Lord God, where decisions have been made
[1:49:22] right here in your presence and then
[1:49:23] getting right back around and continuing
[1:49:25] that same kind of fellowship and it
[1:49:27] weakens them, Lord God, they don't want
[1:49:30] to stay. How how that's Satan's trapped,
[1:49:32] Lord, to want to keep them in the same
[1:49:34] place and then turn around and tell
[1:49:36] them, "Well, you're not one of them.
[1:49:39] Look at you. You're not one of them."
[1:49:41] And it's all the time the enemy, but
[1:49:44] Lord, we're not ignorant of Satan's
[1:49:46] devices. Give them courage, Lord God.
[1:49:50] Give them strength, Lord. where there's
[1:49:52] things, Lord, that would be so hard like
[1:49:54] it was with Abraham, God, may you bring
[1:49:57] about, Lord, the conditions that's
[1:49:59] needed, Lord. Father, as your children,
[1:50:02] Lord, standing with open hearts, honest
[1:50:06] before you, Lord,
[1:50:09] lead us, Lord. We're not asking you to
[1:50:12] push us. We're not asking you to pull
[1:50:15] us. We're asking you to lead us, Lord.
[1:50:18] May the great divine influence of the
[1:50:22] grace of God
[1:50:24] surround our hearts. Lord, arrest our
[1:50:28] minds, Lord.
[1:50:30] Granted, Lord God, may we, Lord Jesus,
[1:50:33] not look just at temporal values, but
[1:50:36] Lord, may we look to that of the
[1:50:38] eternal.
[1:50:41] Grant it Lord, I pray Lord in the name
[1:50:44] of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:46] Amen. And amen, Lord. Great leaders.
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:56] All
[1:50:57] the way.
[1:51:00] I'm going all the way.
[1:51:05] All

[1:51:41] turning back.
[1:51:43] All the way. Yes, I'm going all the way.
[1:51:51] All
[1:51:53] the way. All the way. I'm going all the
[1:51:58] way. Oh, I'm going all the way with
[1:52:05] my own decision.
[1:52:09] I made my decision.
[1:52:13] I'm going.
[1:52:15] Yes, Lord.
[1:52:18] I made
[1:52:20] my choice.
[1:52:22] I'm going all the way.
[1:52:26] Oh, I made my decision. Well, I'm going
[1:52:33] all the way.
[1:52:36] I'm going all the way with
[1:52:41] my Lord.
[1:52:45] I'm drawing
[1:52:48] going to be no turning back all the way.
[1:52:53] Hallelujah. No turning
[1:52:56] back. Oh, I'm going all the way.
[1:53:02] I'm draw
[1:53:05] [Music]
[1:53:07] I'm going all the way. Well, I'm going
[1:53:13] all the way with my Lord.
[1:53:20] It's all
[1:53:22] the way.
[1:53:25] I'm going all the way. Going all the
[1:53:29] way. Go
[1:53:31] the way. Going all the way. Going all
[1:53:36] the way.
[1:53:38] Yes. All the way.
[1:53:42] I'm going all the way.
[1:53:46] I'm going all the way with
[1:53:52] my Lord.
[1:53:55] Yes, I've made my decision.
[1:54:00] I'm going all the way.
[1:54:04] I've made
[1:54:06] my choice and I'm going all the way.
[1:54:11] Hallelujah.
[1:54:13] I made my decision. Oh, I'm going all
[1:54:20] the way.
[1:54:22] I'm going all the way
[1:54:26] in my
[1:54:30] Yes, Lord. I've drawn
[1:54:33] the line.
[1:54:35] I'm going all the way. Yes,
[1:54:40] I'm drawing
[1:54:42] back. No turning back. I'm going all the
[1:54:46] way.
[1:54:51] on the line. Yes, Lord. I'm going all
[1:54:55] the way.
[1:54:57] I'm going all the way.
[1:55:01] [Applause]
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:04] All the way home. Yes, I'm all
[1:55:08] the way.
[1:55:10] I'm going all the way. Going all the
[1:55:14] way. Yes. All
[1:55:17] the way.
[1:55:19] I'm going all the way. All the way,
[1:55:23] Lord. All the way.
[1:55:28] I'm going all the way. Oh, I'm going all
[1:55:35] the way
[1:55:37] with the Lord.
[1:55:40] Oh,
[1:55:42] going all the way with the Lord.
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:54] Don't you love the Lord?
[1:55:58] I tell you, you know, when you
[1:56:02] it it's all about when somebody from
[1:56:04] their heart said, "Oh man, I'm so glad
[1:56:07] to get away from that message. I'm so
[1:56:09] glad to get away from this. That's what
[1:56:11] was in the heart the whole time. That's
[1:56:13] right. That's right. And they did thing
[1:56:15] they did things. They conformed, but it
[1:56:18] was in their heart the whole time.
[1:56:22] Ain't it amazing that what someone looks
[1:56:23] at as bondage.
[1:56:26] You look and say, "This is freedom."
[1:56:29] Bondage.
[1:56:31] I came out of bondage. Hallelujah. I
[1:56:34] came out of bondage.
[1:56:40] I'm doing what I want to do. Yes. But
[1:56:42] the difference is when your nature has
[1:56:44] been changed. There you go. There you
[1:56:47] go. And you know what? God don't make
[1:56:49] nobody serving.
[1:56:52] You don't make mistakes either.
[1:56:57] He don't.
[1:57:01] But God don't make anybody serve him.
[1:57:03] You know, to me, that's powerful. That's
[1:57:05] powerful. All he just he brings his word
[1:57:08] in this generation and just waves it
[1:57:11] right over our lives. Hallelujah. And
[1:57:13] you know what? God's not worried that
[1:57:15] one's going to miss it. No, sir.
[1:57:21] Hallelujah.
[1:57:23] [Music]
[1:57:25] I had a person that got kind of critical
[1:57:27] of me and things and oh, you need to be
[1:57:29] doing this, you need to be doing that,
[1:57:31] you need to be doing this. And and I I
[1:57:32] picked up how the person was natured. I
[1:57:35] knew it. So I put my arm around him. I
[1:57:37] said, "Listen,
[1:57:39] you know what's tremendous?" I said,
[1:57:41] "There ain't going to be one name on
[1:57:43] that lamb's book of life miss it.
[1:57:47] Not one's going to miss it." God's going
[1:57:49] to ensure that everyone gets there. Of
[1:57:51] course, it didn't it didn't help. It
[1:57:53] just further flustered. But you know,
[1:57:55] the reality of it is it's not us making
[1:57:58] it happen.
[1:58:00] Hallelujah. It's not us that made it
[1:58:02] happen with our children. It's not us
[1:58:05] that make it happen. That's why the
[1:58:06] prophet said in humble thyself, just
[1:58:08] shine the light in humility. God will
[1:58:10] take care of it. Amen. That's our
[1:58:12] responsibility. Arise and shine. Just
[1:58:14] just let just let the life be reflected
[1:58:16] through your life. Just just be present.
[1:58:18] Some of you are going to go to
[1:58:19] gatherings today and maybe you've got
[1:58:21] children that's not serving the Lord.
[1:58:22] Don't give up on them. Just shine the
[1:58:25] light. Amen. Shine the light. Brother
[1:58:28] Bram said, "I'm holding." Brother Ryman
[1:58:30] tells us in thy house, he said, "I'm
[1:58:32] holding," you hold faith for your
[1:58:34] children. He said, "I'm holding faith
[1:58:36] for people that are sitting in the
[1:58:37] tabernacle that are still not where they
[1:58:39] need to be. I'm holding faith for them."
[1:58:42] Just shine the light. That's right.
[1:58:44] Shine the light. Let the word What
[1:58:46] What's What What was the greatest? Was
[1:58:48] the greatest to have just the tablets or
[1:58:51] was the greatest to be able to have the
[1:58:53] word made flesh?
[1:58:55] It's the word made flesh. Yes, sir. Let
[1:58:58] the word be made flesh in your life. Let
[1:59:00] that word because it's that it's that
[1:59:02] living Christ in your life passing over
[1:59:05] passing over their lives. If there's
[1:59:07] something that's there and I'm going to
[1:59:08] say I believe there is. We don't
[1:59:10] approach with I don't know if there is
[1:59:12] or not. That's not for me to worry
[1:59:14] because I'll tell you if lot of people
[1:59:16] could have looked at me and said there's
[1:59:18] nothing about his life.
[1:59:21] I'm not trying to preach again but I
[1:59:22] just think this is fitting. You could
[1:59:23] have looked at the woman at the well and
[1:59:25] said why give her the time of day? Look
[1:59:28] at her life. It's all messed up and
[1:59:29] ruined. But down beneath all of those
[1:59:32] other choices,
[1:59:34] [Applause]
[1:59:36] beneath it all, there was a divine
[1:59:39] appointment where his presence I have
