trevor was speaking about how god desires to have fellowship with us it's not what we can see but it's what he sees deep inside of us amen it's the very life key of b-flat b-flat start with the uh verse do you remember the verse on the road to emails [Music] three men walk that way [Music] as they reach their destination the two men asked the third to stay and as they talk together breaking bread and pouring wine [Music] i finally now realize the simplicity of his size how could he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within amen i prayed your lord take on my life i give it all to thee grant that every day help me church your commune with me and how can he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see i prayed your lord take all my life i give it all to thee [Music] oh grant that every day your commune with me let's sing that verse again on the road to emails three men walk that way as they reach their destination the two men asked the third to stay and as they talk together breaking bread i finally now realize the simplicity of his size and how could he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see i prayed the lord take all my life i give it all to thee [Music] oh grant that every day your commune with me one more time and how can he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more that within he can't see my prayer dear lord take all my life i give it all to thee oh grant that every day [Music] your commune with me grant that every day you'll come here with me [Music] it's just overwhelming as you think of it more and more god desires fellowship there's no way that we could get to him we couldn't restore him hallelujah only he could do that amen and i'm glad that he had a great yearning for fellowship weren't you amen amen to restore amen i'm so glad for that i'm glad to be in fellowship amen amen with the lord jesus so glad to be in fellowship with brothers and sisters of life precious faith see you some different ones it's always good to see we just want to just go to the lord in prayer sister brenda just had to leave her her mother had fallen there at home they're taking her mother to the er so we just want to remember sister brenda's mother in prayer as we go to the lord in prayer and just ask for his blessing on the further part of the service and that the lord would also move our sister to that need as well anybody has an unlift or an unspoken request you just like to make known before the lord amen he's mindful let's just let's just go to him right now lord jesus lord what a privilege it is once again to come to your throne lord jesus lord we're not standing here this morning as beggars but we're standing here lord as redeemed sons and daughters of god we did not make a way for ourselves to stand here but we are thankful for that way that has been made for us oh god into the holies of homes lord we are taking lord these requests lord there's many lord unspoken requests different needs lord that's upon the hearts of your children and lord we believe your god that behind the uplifted hand god is a faith that just just res just lord is with the resolve in you know that god that you are mindful you're more than able you're more than enough you care oh god for every need upon the hearts of your children lord as we take these needs every one of these requests lord for sister brenda that you would give her safe traveling mercies back home lord knowing her mind lord could be upon that of her mother lord which would be normal and natural that god i ask that you keep your hand upon her lord and i ask that god that you would move on the behalf of her mother right now lord i pray that father that may there not be one lord one thing wrong with her mother lord god i just ask oh god that father that you would move lord god on the scene right now lord god lord if there be anything out of place or out of line may you just move oh god oh father lord jesus and move it right back in place and right back in line oh god give her strength lord her mother lord she's lord older lord and in age lord and her lord lord's tips just aren't real balance but god you're mindful lord of our lord we just asked lord that you would move for this need in a special way father we pray that god you'll just continue lord to minister to the different needs lord right here in the assembly lord god even texts that i've received from different ones overseas we ask god that you'll continue just to move for each need lord we know that you're mindful lord and we're thankful for that oh god we're so grateful that we have such a heavenly father as you that we can come to lord and

song service has just just made a way we ask that you just come lord and just speak to our hearts now help me to get out of the way lord i need you hallelujah this congregation needs you lord we need you together amen may you just come lord in a very special way now in the name of jesus christ amen if you'd like to open your bibles i'd like to go back to the passage of scripture that we were reading from last week i'd like to just continue on with the thought of our part in the kingdom our heart in the kingdom matthew chapter 9 verse 35 jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing their sickness and every disease among the people when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as she having no shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray you therefore the lord of harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just say as well before i get right into this here this morning that um i just want to say you know on behalf of the trustees they could be doing this just as well and they probably will be doing it here in the future but just just wanted to make mention to you i wanted to thank you there was an offering i believe was right over thirteen hundred dollars that came in last week so i think that's about close to thirty 3 500 that's been collected for towards the building project and there i also want to say thank you for your prayers and continue to keep that in prayer of the brothers it seems like as we were praying about remember the quotes and getting the quotes back well thanks be to god we got the we got quotes back and we're only waiting on one more quote so it should be about i think it's six quotes is that right brother shane about six six quotes and so these brothers have done the the research to bring in someone here that you know would be where it would be somewhat of good good work so we just want prayer prayer as well may we just pray together that god will just guide and direct us on this here i also want to announce on this coming thursday brother benny perry from swanson south carolina will be ministering for us here you'll also be ministering at brother randy's on wednesday at 7 pm as well and more than welcome to to be there at brother randy's as well so this brother this coming thursday brother benny perry will be here from swanson south carolina and and he might actually be coming this way to actually get warmer weather with what they got in store coming today it's kind of kind of odd you know and amazing the things you when i was just talking to him last week and it was 80-some degrees and ah my goodness yeah i hated some degrees and i'm looking at my office window and i'm just i'm cold looking out the window but we thank god for his mercy and we want to just remember them in prayer as they would be traveling up i want to just continue on this thought on our part in the kingdom as we look at this and knowing that we there is a part that we we do have to fulfill and uh i want to read go back into a quote that i've read here a couple times to you one when in from the thursday the the message is on prayer which this also deals with prayer but to understand that the part that god has asked of you and i to do it's not us doing it on our own accord and then surrendering it to god but rather it's recognizing that it must be him do the work and fulfill it through our lives because all that was lost there in in the fall what was lost there of how that god would come down as brother trevor was going back into that on thursday night of fellowship with adam and eve and that fellowship was more it was not just speaking lip to ear but the fellowship was because they also had god's nature inside of them because that's the real fellowship without that fellowship then there cannot be the other fellowship so it's because of that there had to come about a restoring to bring us back into a true fellowship which would be under the shed blood of the lamb and so when we we see it that when we are looking here in the scripture brother branham he pulls this and this this quote that i want to read from and he's speaking how that the lord jesus spent so much time in prayer and if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only knew what time in prayer meant and remember we are made up of a series of courts body spirit and soul and we have decisions decisions are made not in the soul but decisions are made in the mind that's the battleground we have that in this we have the spirit realm as well and satan is always always out to try to draw us out to live our lives through those two outer realms and we're always defeated when we go when we go by those realms and those outer realms we can have feelings and impressions all sorts of things but when we're guided and letting our lives be under the influence of the inner man of that life that god has deposited on the inside then we're no we're not under the influence of of our own being or our own thoughts but we are under the influence of the mind of christ and that's something that we must we we find ourselves to be very purposeful in our lives it's not just things that just happens but it's things that we must be very purposeful with and this is why paul could say in romans 12 that we would present our bodies as a living sacrifice god god will not present our bodies for us we must present our bodies unto god our lives unto god and he said jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only knew what time in prayer meant sometimes when you're in prayer god changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen he said do you believe that it might be something's fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation let me just pause here for a moment the outer two realms can look at something and say i don't see any other way around this this seems like a done deal but the inner man is one who is strengthened by god and if we give the inner man the right away the inner man it's not saying that it's going to go that way but we have an access to the throne of god to recognize that it is god that can move on the scene and will move on the scene even in things that are thought to be impossible to man god can take situations and turn it right around we've seen that with healing we've seen it with other natural things within life we've seen it within spiritual conditions of even the direction than pathways that our life was headed but god stepped in and god interceded and god changed the course of the situation of our lives but the brahman said you would say if god knows it's going to happen what would my prayer do he said your and he refers us to this text that we read he said you remember when he stood there looking out upon the harvest he was the lord of the harvest and he said the harvest is ripe and laborers are but few pray ye the lord of harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest in other words pray to me that i will send laborers into my harvest which i'm telling you it's such a needy thing he said but part of it sees this part of it lays in human beings do you believe that the kingdom of god lays within the human being now we know that the kingdom of god cometh without observation the kingdom of god is not in word but it's in power and no man can even see understand the kingdom of god except he be born again is that right and it is the kingdom of god when this kingdom that was that we speak of of god's own life coming in to his children by way of the new birth and raising up a son and daughter of god on the inside that is a subject of the kingdom that has been born of the spirit of god and reflects the kingdom of god right here walking in this present world it's a kingdom that daniel was under the inspiration and said in the days of these kings the god of heaven shall set up a kingdom that will overthrow the rest of the nations and shall never be overthrown let me just say this that the kingdom of god by the holy ghost this is why the spirit of god when it would speak to us it is not an option to be born again you must be born again there's only one thing that can overthrow that nature that first birth and give you a power to reign in and to live a victorious life and it comes through and by the holy ghost coming and quickening that man on the inside you see what the holy spirit is actually doing is he's drawing the man on the inside there is that of the son and daughter of god that's magnetized to the holy spirit that's coming forth and that's what god is working on to bring into expression and that expression it ties you right back in to the tree of life and that tree is greater than your natural tree right there you've received an abstract that is greater than any claim that your natural tree could have upon you you have been brought back in contact with the tree of life himself the lord jesus christ amen i'd say praise be to god so it's the kingdom of god that lays within the human being jesus said in one place i'm the vine you are the branches the vine can't bear fruit the branches in the vine bears fruit and god cannot bear fruit of himself it's got to take the church he's got to take you branches to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the vine then fruit comes forth notice god wants your hands he wants your eyes he wants your tongue he wants your lips he wants your ears he wants your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through you so god's god's desire he will use the life that is sanctified and surrendered to his purpose and so it becomes god pouring himself into that life and god operating through that seed and then the hands express what's on the inside the life expresses what's on the inside in other words this outward man only gives a visible manifestation of the indwelling of the invisible god because that that working is that of the kingdom of god going forth in our life you see when we're under the kingdom of god under that by the new birth we're no longer we no longer care for the things of the world but our delight is in the lord jesus christ we're not just we're not just people that are good clean moral people that comes with it but it's it's deeper than that it's a people that are moved by the spirit of god to fulfill the will and purpose of almighty god that are in tune with god's kingdom amen and jesus here we referred to this last week and referred to in the quote in john 15 and i just want to go to verse 5 of john 15 and jesus said i am the vine ye are the branches so he's letting us know position he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing i want you just to hang on to this where without me you can do nothing he did not say that you were not going to do anything he just let you know that what you are called to do you cannot do it without me you will need me but i need you amen is that right yes amen verse 7 if he abided me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so notice if you abide in me you're dwelling in me your life is hidden in me and my words abide in you they find place in your life you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you it's very simple what you're going to be asking is his will which is according to his word that's dwelling in you you're not even because you're you're no longer walking by your earthly desires and as the word is coming forth you're you find under the maturity you're losing sight of the things of self and you're more in tune with with working and operating to please the lord jesus christ it doesn't it becomes more into that into that realm and we know that whatever fruit will come from whatever we yield our members instruments to that's right god will never yield god does not come down and yield the members of our body but he says you yield them right god says yields your members romans 6 and remembers to righteousness so we have we have an authority and yielding our lives to him and paul would write of this in romans 7 of this union that is now taking place between the believer and christ because our old husband that first nature were not just divorced from him he has to be dead is that right that's scripture because god will not marry will not become united the holy ghost will not come as long as a life is still alive to the world and loving the things of the world but you see god brings us to a place in our life the holy spirit not god bringing us but god dealing with our life and this is where as an individual when you've surrendered your life to the lord brother braham will say just this way and things that are to be he says when you've come to a place and you've offered your life to christ but if you haven't received the holy ghost yet he said ask god to add word on top of a word on top of word he said and come and get the holy ghost what a way it lays it right out that god is inviting us to say lord and word on top of word on top of the word lord bring me lord to that place that there is a desire you're stirring up in me let me tell you something a church can't stir that up that is the heavenly father that is stirring up that desire that was within you all the time and he's the only one that can satisfy that amen oh i love it it just takes it takes everything of flesh out of the way and it puts it right between us and god it's the vine that energizes the branch it energizes and we were looking at that last week on how that it's the vine that energizes or inspires the branch what to ask or we won't even know what to ask so it's working in a relationship abiding in me you see as we as we look at this i want to go now just into john 15 7 and i just want to just pick up and work with this divine energy that that divine himself the lord jesus is the vine the the children of god are the branches and it's the divine energy of the inspired word that directs us what to ask for in verse 7 once again john 15 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so there's no question it's not a question will it be done because where where not only that you or your life is dwelling in the word but the word is also dwelling in you so what you're asking for is the word which you're asking for the same thing you are amen is that right you're not asking for something different notice the life of the lord jesus when he came he came to demonstrate listen enoch and the rest of them had only heard stories from from great grandpa eat adam you know they were alive they had only heard testimonies about that and my heart adam could describe the presence of god coming down but now notice what was lost now christ there have been glimpses of it a glimpse here and a glimpse here and a glimpse here like rays of a rainbow but remember all of them come together to make that light and god is light it was god coming together now to display this is what god intended a son and daughter of god to be and this is what we had fallen from and so here the life of of the lord jesus it was in that of redemption work that is true but it was a life that within redemption that was also to express so that you and i could not just could have such a an idea to have such a if i can say an example that sat before us of what god intends every son and daughter of god to be the lord jesus did not operate on his own will though god listen to me now god so condescended into that place to where now he could experience that of that of a of a will but remember the lord jesus never moved by his own will he was tempted he was tested within that area come on now well you know man he was tempted with all sorts of temptations he was tempted with sin and everything else but he was also tempted to get ahead of the program of god he was tempted to do something and notice he had the power within him but he did not do it because he had the power within him he did what he did by vision under leadership of the holy spirit he was the word made flesh it was an example of what god was bringing back sons and daughters of god that would not be moved upon their own will upon their own feelings but would be reconciled to the leadership of the holy spirit and i say god help me to be more help me to be more help me to be more so this divine energy and i want to just just to lay this in and when this scripture here brother brahm talks about how moses failed in the first place and era of god's deliverance he said here's what's the matter it was the lack of having what the burning bush had and that's where our failure today is a lack having what the holy spirit has and the holy spirit has all good things for us if we receive the holy spirit then all things are possible and not only possible but promised to us is that right amen in him it yea and amen jesus said ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it if you abide in me in my words and you ask what you're willing to be given to you now notice brother braham takes this he says when we step into the light of god's word with the unction of the holy spirit to shine the light on it brother the impossible becomes little things then we are we we are built to be moved by the unction of the holy ghost i hear brother branham standing at the end of fundamental foundation of faith it's been going over and over in that message and brother ram's talking about the divine energy of god moving through the branches and what god has purposed the church of the living god to be and brother ram stands there he's praying for for a sister after he's prayed for many and you know discernment things have been called out and he asked he asked the lord jesus he said father he said will you energize me just now and energize this sister with your presence lord that this need might be met you see it's asking for his energy for his unction god knows what you and i need to be unctionized in he knows the the energy that you and i have need of in our lives god asks us to believe his word he sends the holy spirit to energize that word when he falls into it when the word's being preached and the holy spirit brings the word he energizes that and flashes the same light of god's blessed promise and god's provided a way of healing he says when you receive the inspiration that jesus christ died for your sickness it's that very hour that your healing has come when you receive from heaven that jesus died for your sins and you've accepted it you don't need any prayer for you then you've already accepted it it's settled now watch how he goes here you we can preach the word and explain the word but you have to receive the word he said that's what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the revelation something slips out of the unseen world yonder and comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says now i see it your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile and every muscle in your body seems to rejoice something's going to happen something you don't need a prayer line then you've got it then when we're ready and to receive it you see the branch has to be willing to receive it it's just as it is declared right here and what is spoken and you can look at your life and say well i don't feel like a son and daughter of god brother samuel you don't know the kind of life or what i'm living but but the point is is that what is being proclaimed to you is that you are free but whether or not you accept that that's your own choice god will not do it for us he won't do anything it's us to accept what he has already done and reconcile ourselves to that fact that i am a son of god i am a daughter of god and stand upon that amen i think that was a very good point to brother trevor and he was i know that was inspiration striking there on thursday night i'll talk to him about that i'm gonna talk to my mom about don't talk to him about it right because satan has made an attack upon god's working in your life amen right don't you let him minimize that working as well well it's nothing that's you're just moved by emotion you know what it is he wants to discourage and try to take away from the working of almighty god but you know it's god's working in your life you know it's something beyond your own abilities your own things it's god moving in your life hallelujah oh my now i want you to think of this if you abide in me and my words abide in you you see this words it's not just as we can look at the written word we can even look out in putting the message together but if but if it's not by inspiration or the word that would be used here rhema the spirit of god inspiring and opening that word and really moving it down personal in your life and it's just a letter letters can be matched up students can match up verses quotes and everything else but when god speaks directly and that person that life is recognizing my words my my spirit revealed truth has found its place in your life then there's nothing can stand before and it becomes a living desire amen you see oh my let me just let me just minister a little bit moses when he needed direction for the children of israel that pillar of fire was following them brother bran refers that and the god changed his mind as the logos as the word but he says moses got from there what was needed for the people of god so what came from the logos was the rhema was the need for that moment and moses was god's instrument to tap into that that now rhema word could come to the camp of the living god so when the children of israel were moved by that inspired word it was a reflection that they had come under the leadership of the pillar of fire it had been a direct communication between god and them through his prophet amen are you with me amen now this is where let me just refer to this a few places jesus said it like this and this word that is used here rhema of spiritually revealed truth he answered and said in matthew 4 4 it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every rhema that proceed us out of the mouth of god that's what we live by that's what our lives are orchestrated by you say what are you trying to say brother samuel i'm trying to say that every day of our life must be a fresh experience you can't live on last year's experience you can't live on last month's experience you must have a fresh experience every day of your life come on now organization make camps out of experiences of when god visited them but the only thing it is is a past memory amen god don't want to be a past memory he wants to be the living god he came to mary remember here the angel gabriel came to her with a message and remember as she as she asked how shall this be said the holy ghost shall overshadow thee notice and here he says for with god nothing no rhema no revealed word shall be impossible amen it's prevailing power in the word of god let me tell you what prevailing power it is sometimes we're looking out here only to prevail over the enemy we need prevailing power over our own thoughts about ourselves and it takes a revelation from almighty god amen come on now that's how we're living we're not living by bread alone we're living by every word of god that proceeds from his mouth for with god nothing no rhema shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word that word that rhema the word that has been revealed here's what she did with it verse 19 of luke 2 mary kept all these rhemas she accumulated she accumulated this accumulated she accumulated she kept all these things or rhemas of god these inspired words and pondered them in her heart right well i don't have to tell you as believers you go to take in the word of god and start thinking in your heart and pretty soon you're right i'm not the only one amen the presence of god will just draw near now it isn't all together when we're just thinking on it but as we give ourselves to it how the presence of god will draw near the bible says draw nigh unto god and he will draw nine to you and the reason many times we don't have the visitations like we should have within that is because we got our minds on too many other things and god help us we've got our face more in this stuff oh brother samuel i know all the drug addicts what about phone addicts come on now all right oh my oh let's say i don't have time no no no no we we we realize we do have time we do have time and i know time sometimes it's pressing but we understand what we're saying here in luke 2 29 lord lord notice simeon is praying this lord now let thy servant depart in peace according to thy rhema that word that you revealed now this word was revealed simeon saw it come to pass it put him in motion to where he got him up out of his office he walked down that line of babies that were being dedicated that day now after that rhema word that god had given to him that had inspired him as a branch of god now he prays according to what the revelation had said you're not going to depart until you've seen the lord's christ now once that junction of time has happened he now begins to pray for his departure oh glory be to god oh my my my it is something how a saint just knows when it's time to go amen right sometimes they start talking about it start talking about it you know i never forget where my dad my dad had begun talking about going home he had been talking about that for a year or over a year and been been asking things or been asking mom will you be all right and all these other things he had been talking about sure he was tired in his body but there was also a call where there had to be a satisfying that my race has been run the course that god has called me to do it has been run aren't you glad that god has everything under control notice and simon luke 5 5 speaking of peter and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless and thy rhema thy word i will let down the net now if anybody else would have said anything peter what peter was already saying we've done this we've been out here all night long and by the way he was an expert fisherman he's got a lot of people beatings and nowadays that have those trolling motors and i've seen been on the boat with a lot of the brothers right here from the assembly trolling motors and oh my there's the school and oh we'll go over here hey peter didn't have all that but peter was an expert fisherman are you with me but he but notice when the rhema word from god came he accepted that word over his own mental knowledge and conception about the things that were around him oh i went to god this morning that made god so speak to our hearts in such a way that we will take that above everything else that we see around us and rest in that word john 8 47 jesus said he that is of god heareth god's ramus his words therefore hear them not because ye are not of god now remember satan does not have access to the rhema of god he does not have access to that theologians don't have access to that that is not something that man can sit down and study and yet they don't have access to that that is sovereignly given by god is that right the father revealeth such undebates that right when jesus stood there in matthew matthew 16 he said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock i will build my church so revelation never the prophet puts it to us like this revelation does not come by natural endowments but revelation comes by spiritual endowment so it takes the dunamis of god the spirit of god to move upon the scene and notice think of this now god never gets ahead of himself man can get ahead of god man can get we can get so excited my goodness this is the time right now and this is the time right now we can get excited but remember our excitement does not speed up nor slow down the program of god one bit god's program is right on time and when god is ready to reveal his word it's in that season in that time there would be a group of people upon earth and an individual that god would have separated that god might be able to speak his word through his thoughts so that his thoughts would be communicated with us as his children so satan don't have access to this part you see it's just like the things as paul would write that the spirit of man only knows the things of man but it takes the spirit of god to reveal the things of god is that right and one thing we can be sure of is god will reveal it just as we have need of it amen is that right oh my oh my thank you lord now notice this energy this energizing this same energy or energizing this same word that the prophet would use over and over to energize the vine to our divine energizing the branches and energizing energizing us in his word this same word energize is a word that you use means the same thing as the stimulate it's the be that of dynamics it's to be that of which to fire up or to motivate it's which gives us the kinetic energy now there's two different types of energies i i know most of you here aren't in physics i never liked physics myself either had too much math in it for me but i noticed potential energy and kinetic energy potential energy is a rock that's just sitting here and you can look at it say oh lord if that man if that rock falls off boy it's really going to take his toe out that's potential but kinetic is where the rock is falling so kinetic energy this is what the energy of the vine is it comes to inspire us or put us into motion it's kind of like the sim card in your phone if you we can borrow that for a moment when there is a signal that comes that signal actually stimulates or it livens up or it stirs up and moves to speak or to direct the signal to your phone nobody else's phone goes off but your phone does why it is energized it's connected with that signal that's the same way it is with the economy of god that god is inspiring us with a signal from himself oh my notice now with that in mind notice how that when we would we are inspired then to ask the things that we need to ask for in john 14 13 and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it in john 15 16 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever ye shall ask there it is again ask of the father in my name he may give it to you all right the brother brown continues to pick up this text that we've read here about the laborers in the vineyard and i'm not going to read all the parts across the screen but i will refer to a few places brother brown would say do you know that there's some things that we have to do that god cannot do until we do it god can't do it until we do it he furnishes the energy but we got to do the job he says in other words just a power of decision in other words you ask me to do what i knows got what ought to be done you see he could not do it until they asked him to do it so god will never override our will but here inspiration comes to move upon our lives to speak to our hearts the very things that god knows what you and i have need of not only in our natural life but god knows what you and i have need of in our spiritual life that we might continue to grow more and more and more into his image god even knows even decisions that is laying before us tomorrow or in the future and god is there to inspire our lives that we might begin to ask that we would seek after him so when that decision would come around we are under the influence of asking him for his will now think of this i've chosen you and ordained you you know sometimes you know and i think it's just let me just say it this way it's sometimes it can become so much within our thinking and we look at it in a manner of how that you know it's just as though that well you know things are going to take place and god's going to do this and god's going to do this and god's going to do that but in reality remember he cannot do anything unless we first ask him or he inspires us you see god will never override somebody's will and say oh no you don't want the holy ghost no you're going to get the holy ghost no lord i really i'm not asking for it right now no no no no you're going to get it now we realize listen now there is how the spirit of god can move and it's not so much about these lips right here asking it's the spirit of god can recognize even while the word is going forth that the spirit of god it's one way it can fall right into a person's life and that light will be completely changed just like it was in the house of cornelius is that right just like it was there even in ephesus it can happen in that way but remember it didn't always happen that way there were other times where hands were laid upon them is that right this is why brother graham said there's no set pattern there's no set pattern but this is why that the spirit of god dealing within a life it moves upon our heart really it's the heart that begins to call out it's the heart that begins to yearn it's the heart that god is speaking to and then from out of our life then comes forth the request of asking what god is dealing with in our life so the chosen and ordained to bear much fruit does not mean that it's just going to happen all right it's just going to happen but it rather it requires seeking and asking think how you look at every look at the patriarchs look at the matriarchs in the scripture it was not god never overrode their will but they were pulled they were drawn by him ruth forsook the land of her nativity because she caught a vision she something that grabbed the whole of her your god will be my god right were you elijah lodge she was willing to forsake the land of moab see god begin to move upon that life so he cannot do it until they ask him to do it right brother ben tells us in my new ministry he's talking about god's program he says god has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you or if he can't move without us that's right and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost then we're in god's will doing his program so to move under the anointing of the holy ghost to move under where lives have been authorized and set aside by the holy spirit and put into service walking under the anointing of the holy ghost it brings us into that place now to follow his leading and to seek after his leading listen when the holy spirit has come the bible his he reveals himself as the spirit of truth he will lead and guide us into all truth not pull us into all truth not push us into all truth not drag us into all truth lead us into all truth amen this is why the scripture said be not like that of the horse that the got to be put in our mouths sometimes we've had to have to have a bit but that we don't want to have to have a bit put in our mouth we are compared in solomon one one that we i have compared the oh my beloved to one of pharaoh's horses in his chariots a thoroughbred one who knows who his papa and his mama is he's got pedigree he's got papers can trace it all the way back god's program and say god help us we don't want to be paralyzing his program we want to do what he's leading us to do and god doesn't do anything without man he goes on he says and identified christ of all ages in 64 referring to the same thing you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundance that your choice might be full he is depending on you asking and believing that you receive what you ask for all right charles spurgeon i mean who charles spurgeon is right oh man i'm a great man of god too charles spurgeon wasn't a messenger but he's a great man of god charles spurgeon here's look at charles spurgeon a man of prayer what he would say he says whether we like it or not asking is the rule of the kingdom there is no other way ask ask ask ask ask god don't get tired of you asking that thrills him when you ask him amen well i might ask him for something too big you can't you can't ask him for something too big remember to god the big things are just as easy as the little things [Applause] we're encouraged to ask for big things it's a partnership now let me let me kind of bring this down home a little bit now a little bit more remember it's a partnership god right there in those texts that we read god is setting forth a partnership with man so now it brings us to a place of realizing lord my life is to be moved and to be in fellowship with you not not just when we come to the house of god but daily in our life but even more so knowing that what god would speak right here when we come together god gives direction god gives leadership right is that right so now it brings it to a place of praying and seeking for every service all right amen you see when you're praying for something then you're expecting something right but a sure of of no expectation is no prayer so prayer when prayer is being is being offered up because it's not just random it's it's where coming before god and there's things that we are speaking we're communing we are asking him bringing to him the things that he is making known to us so every service every service should provide things very personally right that you and i would pray and seek after the lord in our own lives and the reason i say with praying and seeking because when we see his greatness and we see our insufficiency as brother branham put it at his feast of the trumpets or rather our inability to accomplish what he's asking and there's a good there's a good place within that to recognize our inability that's what drives us to prayer amen that's what drives us to pray i want you to think of this here the scripture would say i just want to try to get to a few a few places the scriptures in matthew 6 how matthew 6 6 can i have just a little bit here i don't want to i don't want to be rushed within this in this spot and i notice matthew 6 6 when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou has shut the door pray to the father which is in secret so it's an entering in there's an entrance there we are entering into a secret place with god listen you can even be in a secret place with god sitting in your car that's right are you hearing me now because closing here you the closing is in you going and clearing out a bunch of clothes out of one of your closets and then trying to cram yourself in there it's about entering in in other words going past all of the oh oh i just feel so tired oh my you know the flesh doesn't feel like praying or the listen the flesh never feels like prey okay it never does this is why brother bram said it's so easy to get away from praying and reading because the flesh is weak the lord jesus in a very climatic moment he asked the disciples while he's on the mountain hey watch and pray all right comes back all right all right it's like the challenge of this hour we're in listen the pressures that are all around us sometimes we look and say oh my you know the food we're eating yeah i understand there's a lot of things going on but it's not just food you can eat all the organic food you want but there's still pressures because this is not natural flesh and blood it is demonic forces in revelations 9 the lid of hell has been taken off but the bible says in revelations 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel hallelujah god will never be out done [Applause] and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee open i don't want to there's more to labor on that verse but i just want to get to this these places here he says in verse 7 don't use vain repetitions as heathen do god isn't heard by you repeating i'm going to repeat or i'm going to repeat i'm going to repeat no god isn't hurt by repeating all right you say well what does that mean it's god is here look what he's saying here for they think they shall be heard for them much speaking but bill be like that for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask you're asking what you know that he's making known you have need of and you're coming to him in faith amen and you're talking to him like a man all right amen praise the lord hallelujah amen after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name worship all right amen worship brother samuel i've got a bucket list of requests start with worship right amen that's right charles spurgeon also said in one place he said there's one one quick thing for prayer denial and that's cold formal prayers loaded requests and sometimes we have a lot of requests but praying isn't always about requests the bible and always in the scripture it says to to making known that your prayer the prayer and supplication so there's worship that goes for it now notice thy kingdom come here's the request thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread so we are longing for that time to come we're not here living endlessly we are living with a purpose life for the rapture right amen we are looking for that at any moment in any twinkling of an eye amen and so for this moment i need the daily bread that's needed for this moment i need the divine energy from almighty god the rhema word that's needed for this moment to minister to the need in my life to meet the challenge that god would let me know what he wants me to ask him for right now amen thank you lord and i want to just say i want to just dwell on this just a moment it struck me after i believe it was last week and i just struck me as i'm just here on the platform and we know i want you to say i want you to catch this the lord jesus would speak to you and i and say ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be opened unto you you're trying the desire to gain entrance a desire that you have a desire in him that only he can fulfill so here we pray for revelation as a matter of fact as brother brown would state it revelation is more important to you us and he said perhaps you realize we've looked at a few few places within that but revelation is very important amen but i don't want you to think of revelation as just mysteries because there's one revelation that is the absolute necessity and the center of all revelations and that's the revelation of jesus christ amen a school can't teach that amen that that is god himself here giving that revelation personally as he gave it to john that's the same way he does to every child of god him sure you can hear the word but it takes god to open amen it takes god to unfold that so but praying for revelation is not just to understand all the mysteries because a person could understand all mysteries and still not have the love of god the holy ghost judas had understanding in all the mysteries right yeah hey judas could have judas could have had held bible studies and explained the mysteries wide open knowledge of them all right that's right right you had understanding but the revelation is when we're speaking of it isn't confined to just understanding mysteries but it's rather it's looking to the lord who knows what we have need of yes amen i want you to think of this when samson was being when samson here was conceived by the noah and his and and manoa's wife samson's mother the angel of the lord came to them and let them know what the manner of the child was and what you shall do and manoa said ask him to come back see god holds the mystery and the plan for our lives yes amen it's god unfolding himself and unfolding our lives so we're praying for revelation i want you to want you to catch this in revelation in psalms 27 is everybody okay and in psalms 27 i don't want to read all these scriptures but david is declaring who the lord is to him he is my strength my life amen he is the light of my life then david describes all of the encroachments of the adversary trying to come upon his life to consume his life but notice in the midst of the encampment encirclement and and coming after his life notice what speaks forth out of his life in verse 4 in psalms 27 one thing have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after i'm desiring it and i'm going to seek after it i'll be seeking after it tomorrow seeking after in the next hour seeking after the next month i'm going to keep on seeking after this because this is the one thing that i've desired amen what is it david that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life amen his desire was to be right in the presence of almighty god don't just don't limit this and say oh inside of a church no we're talking about the true house of god which is the lord jesus christ which is his body his spirit dwelling in a many-membered body whose house we are it's dwelling in his presence in his life dwelling in the word david said i don't want to miss anything i want to be right in step amen i want to be right there when i read my word is being given i want to be ready amen i don't want to be so distracted with oh look what the enemies are doing oh my goodness look what's going on look i don't want to be destroyed i know that's all out there i can feel the hot breath wanting to come down my neck but there's one thing that i have desired these things are trying to distract and take away but there's one thing that i've desired and that that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life do what david to be whole amen the beauty of the lord amen and to inquire in his temple amen probably most of you are like maybe maybe you're not maybe you are maybe you're not i like art but art can bore me awful fast don't try to be spiritualized on me or nothing there's a certain other things can bore you quickly too if i started talking about hunting you might say oh god bless you this time i'll see you on thursday we have our natural likes or whatever i can go through certain things you know when we've been over the cleveland museum of art and i can go through there look at certain things and look at this and and you know there's some things you could just we just walk right by but then there's other things that catch you and you give more time to that than you do to any other display you see to behold the scripture says to behold david said this is why i want to dwell in the household that i might be whole that i might gaze look into the beauty the character of the lord his favor why because as i'm looking upon him i will be changed from glory unto glory amen david there's a lot of distractors i know but this is why i'm seeking after it daily because if i can behold his beauty be focused just captivated with that then notice what happens and to inquire at his temple to inquire means to make a request so things that i'm seeing causes me to start to inquire so as i'm beholding him it raises up within me there's inspiration to say lord be it unto me lord yes amen grant it lord let let my life be filled with more of the love of god amen help me lord jesus in my life lord give me strength lord in this area of overcoming my life now notice not just say it and walk away but behold to behold him to stay upon it in sincerity there are some things that have from our life just like that and then there's other things that stands out to us now god deals with our life about it and it stands out to a place we say lord i really want to overcome this what does it do now it's beholding in sincerity you're inquiring in his temple right now hold on this word to inquire it means to seek it means to look for it means to reflect there's one thing we could probably do more a better job on is reflect reflection sometimes that's where we've got to look and say just not hitting the mark just right here where it ought to be reflection reflection they used to have when i was in teaching methods before i ever went into student teaching they would have us write these big old lesson plans and i'd have to have a little section about like this little section and every time i taught this section of the lesson i had to write a paragraph after that lesson was over it was all about reflection did i do that when i got my own classroom no but you see that was framework teaching me right that good teaching there's reflection just like when what you do within your job or field of work mom dad whatever there's reflection within it there's reflection in our life and i'm grateful when we reflect oh we can look and we can see an image and we say oh god lord i i'm so ashamed lord i i don't like what i'm saying but if we'll look look into that perfect law of liberty and ask him he can change us amen give us strength in our life taking inventory in our lives this is why the scripture said in psalms 37 4 delight thyself also in the lord i tell you what a contrast to the day that we're living in amen it's a day think of it it's a day about do you just do me you too everything is everything is about just do as you feel the heart is deceitful above all things but i the lord do try the reigns of the heart you see we think of this with with revelation this is where we have to ask in our own lives because you see the things that we see church will keep us in fellowship that's true that's true brother brahms are coming to church it'll keep you in fellowship with one another but you see without a prayer life that is sincere and consecrated after the things of the lord that he's unfolding and you're beholding without a prayer life you'll never grow you'll never grow we'll never grow but it's prayer god has entrusted what he reveals is god is entrusting us to pray over those things you see this is where we we take inventory we we must ask questions in our own lives are we praying for revelation are we seeking for more of god no let's just be honest let's just be honest there are entrapments to get us into the rat race of life right sometimes there's seasons in life i remember for some as you go through sometimes you've got to go through training on your job i was going through college sometimes there's busier time but it's not a busyness that you're creating it's a season but this the enemy wants to bring entrapments to where the focus becomes off of the lord you say brother samuel but i've got a family it's all the more reason to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire because where your direction is your family's direction will be also is to set that direction to set the course and not allow the world to dictate what can be done in our lives we have to take that that very purposeful in our lives everybody okay amen i know this is just seeds you see just fallen but i want to the seed would drop see his prayer god bring inspiration it sets in motion remember how i remember with elijah elijah prayed earnestly he spoke the word but then he prayed earnestly that it would not rain his prayer wasn't like oh lord i slept out here and i spoke no he spoke according to what god told him to speak but after the word had been spoken he prayed earnestly what was he doing according to the word that was in him that was spoke out the lord jesus stood before the the grave of lazarus we know what takes place he says lazarus come forth the same almighty god that was more than a man could have also said stone be rolled away but instead he picks two women jesus surely you could have got the burly guys up there to roll away the stone no no he's wanting to show see that shows their faith in his presence take away the storm i don't know i don't believe they were big strapping you know they walked up there and martha mary walking up there you know and walking up but i believe they were inspired and the task before them looked like more than what they can do but they were inspired to go beyond limitation and roll away the stone they had something to do we have a part to do that revelation that as we pray for revelation it's that we might know god's will for healing for understanding for family life salvation for deliverance for needs to remind you the pharisees i'm closing and i'm making my descent the pharisees had a prayer life now stay with me the pharisees had a prayer life brother samuel you're saying the pharisees had a prayer life jesus said they made prayers in widows houses for a long time and he also brought up in these guys their prayers really they never left the ground because jesus said in these prayers all they talked about was themselves lord i thank you that i'm not like that guy right are you hearing me now so what i'm saying they had prayer and you could say my they pray a lot mind they pray you couldn't have put a finger if you're gonna come down this way do they have a prayer life but we realize that prayer life is more than just going through the motion it's entering in and getting in contact with god because of all their praying they missed him and of all their prey they called him beelzebub weren't getting before the throne right they had all their long philanthropies and everything else that was walking around but they weren't getting before the throne all right think of this now remember when they came to the lord jesus they said you know your disciples don't pray and fast you guys must not believe in praying fasting no more no no they believed in praying and fasting still but you see the pharisees raised that question and what it was they were still praying and fasting looking for the very thing that was there this is why the spirit of god threw the prophet in this hour in recognizing the day in its message he spoke of the voice of healing and he said they'll hardly print anything except press fast pray fast pray god will send a great move on elijah and he said what it is they're christians and they feel the pull of the hour but they've not recognized god is fulfilling his word right now so we're praying and fasting but we're not praying and fasting looking for a great revival to come we are praying and fasting in contact with the living god the bread groom who is dwelling in his pride body we have come in full of you amen of our bridegroom we know in whom we have believed we are praying and fasting and seeking after the revealed will of god that's being made known to our lives we have found him hallelujah so my feet are preparing to touch the ground on this one philippians 2 12. wherefore my beloved as ye have also obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling lord me to work out my own salvation with fear and trembling their words fear and trembling means one who distrusts his own ability amen for it is god which worketh in you both to will notice both to will see it's god in you to will and to do you see it isn't our will it's his will that it's moving through our will so it's not my will my will surrendered your will surrender to his will it is his will to do this word this part here let me just read in verse 12. can i read that amplified my dear ones as you have always obeyed my suggestions for the morning suggestions these are these are words paul said let anyone who spiritually acknowledges the things that i write into you i commandments of god so now not now not only with the enthusiasm you would show in my presence but much more because i'm absent work out cultivate carry out to the goal and fully complete your own salvation with reverence and awe and trembling which is self-distrust with serious caution tenderness of conscience watchfulness against temptation timidly shrinking from whatever might offend god and discredit the name of christ verse 13 not in your own strength for it is god who is all the while effectually at work in you i love this energizing and creating in you the power and desire it's god raising up the desire on the inside of you both to will and to work for his own good pleasure and satisfaction and delight brother branham says this recognizing your day and its message he's in prayer and if you go to paragraph 237 i just just cut down to that he says god create in me a revival with ram's personal prayer with the congregation let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me lord to hunger they can say yes lord i just gonna put my hand up make me lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus and say amen amen help me lord amen that i can lord get out of the way that the part that i'm to fulfill in the kingdom which is you working through me that i can yield myself lord yield myself placing myself just the things that you're speaking to my heart and give myself to that word that you're speaking to me see no matter where where where in our lives where a person no matter where you be god speaks to all all right they'll be sitting here no matter where you're at in your walk with god if you've if you've never surrendered your life to the lord this is a good opportunity to surrender it and to accept what the lord jesus christ has already done for you it will it would be the fitting thing to repent and ask the lord jesus to forgive you of your sins it would be a fitting time to make ready to walk into the waters of baptism it would be a fitting moment in this time that if you've come into that place and there's desires and things of the world that you can it's a fitting time to ask the almighty god to say lord clean my life cleanse me lord cleanse me by your spirit lord jesus create lord god remove every desire of everything of the world lord out of my life lord all i want is you let be word on top a word on top of word until i'm fully in that image oh god this would be the moment to ask for that say lord god the holy ghost belongs to me as a child of god lord i lay claim on that lord jesus and not just to name and claim it but my life is inspired god has let me know it belongs to me i'm not asking for something that he hasn't said to me i'm asking for him who has took me out and i've seen my life hallelujah as he showed them the field that was ready for harvest i've seen my life he's took me on a personal tour and asked me and said do you not see this praise god but he's not done that to shame me he's done it because he wants to help me amen he shows little things he shows things in our life not to shame us but that we might say lord help me and we give ourselves beholding him oh we're not beholding our mistakes we're not beholding the things that he's calling out we're beholding him when you want to see a counterfeit what do you do what do you do when you want to see it you want to know whether is it a counterfeit bill or not what do you do get a real one that's right amen get a real one that's why the holy ghost the real image of the living god the word image this is why here we are as we're looking upon him it's reflecting in our life and we can see well this is lacking or that is lacking and as we give ourselves to almighty god he gives us strength within our lives to where you can say this might have been in my family but the cycle stops amen yes why because you've got authority by the word of god if ye abide in me and my words abiding you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen let's pray lord jesus lord i haven't intended to keep the people but father just just just sensing lord that liberty that freedom lord even now lord just testing it lord and oh god because lord of your desire to speak so personally to our lives lord father i pray that god out of this service lord jesus the lord he will not just be your god to every to hearts just another service but may this be lord a life-changing moment father to where lives will be changed oh god for eternity lord we're lives o god that even has the approach within prayer it changes the outlook changes to where we see the privilege to enter in we see the purpose of praying lord it's seeking it's asking for those things that you're speaking to our hearts about lord jesus i'm so thankful that we can hear your voice let me tell you a young person middle aged or old let me just tell you something be thankful you can hear god's voice sammy you may not know where i'm at i don't need to but what i'm telling you is think be to god that you can hear his voice and thanks be to god that there's a heart on the inside that will incline to the voice of god a heart that can recognize and say yes lord be it unto me lord jesus yes lord i see what you're calling for from my life i see what you're calling me to lord god i just want to behold behold your beauty and to inquire in your temple lord jesus may we enter in lord and shut out lord every voice of the world shut out lord the voice of pleasure the voice of politics the voice of the lord of domestic life every every voice it's so true there's so many voices in the world today that once to death the voice of the supernatural lord jesus we lord we love to hear your voice lord how we're so thankful this morning as you would speak to us so clearly lord we want to ask you lord those things that you've spoke to our hearts things that lord that can be so personal in every service or maybe there's one here that even struggled in their prayer life but i pray that god may they recognize if they just the lord would get down and just just worship you they don't necessarily have to get down on their knees the bible would say stand pray david would lay prostrate it's a condition of our heart towards you lord i pray that god may they just commit that to you and say lord teach me how to pray may the lord just be very honest and say lord i want a real prayer life lord i see the value i see it more more real lord no wonder satan is always after my time no wonder all of this is going around lord god i want to make the most of every moment not to be bothered with thinking of whether or not prayers or i feel this way but maybe lord just may we just get into your presence take the things say lord you spoke to my heart hallelujah oh glory be to god lord i think of donnie rambo wrote a song i'm not come to ask you for anything i've just come to talk to you lord i've just come lord to tell you how much i love you how much i appreciate you lord thank you for your care thank you lord jesus thank you lord for your mercy thank you for your loving kindness thank you for your favor oh lord jesus granted lord this morning granted lord lord may there not be one that's intimidated may they cast aside all that away because it's the voice of our beloved who is speaking to us beckoning us calling us to come away come away step aside grant them lord jesus lord for every need that's gathered here whether here on the internet those that would stream it later lord father i pray god for each need lord in a congregation audience lord there would be lord god of a variety of spiritual needs lord jesus you're the one to meet all those needs may they take that lord before you grant it lord jesus may they take that need in that petition before you because you have had a personal conference with them this morning to let them to let me to let us look upon this field to draw our attention to something that we need to look at that we need to ask you for forgive us the lord of our times of neglect forgive us lord of our times where we've been too busy and that's what it comes down to lord amen too busy help us lord i pray i know lord as your children they go through seasons of life i've been there lord in those seasons of life may they not get down may they not lord god allow the enemy lord to condemn him amen but may they recognize that lord jesus even through seasons of life or god that even as they can be riding in a car they might say lord this isn't the same as me being able to get out in the woods or get out in the garage or get out here next to the bed and talk to you lord god but father this car right here or this place where i'm at right here this is a place to have communion with you lord i invite you lord jesus i invite you lord glory be to god oh hallelujah hallelujah glory be to god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord glory glory hallelujah we invite you lord jesus oh in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen amen amen oh do you love him amen oh my any good to us to cause us to stop and gaze like the disciples they weren't looking upon a natural field but you see what all they saw was people walking away you know going back to their homes and but what the lord jesus saw was they're like sheep without a shepherd see they were only seeing in the natural realm but it's his presence that opened them to look into the spiritual realm because that realm is more real and has a greater influence on this room aren't you glad when he stops us i want to say this lord jesus i want to say this i'm available to be stopped amen i'm available to be stopped because i'm sure there's things that i've overlooked and i shouldn't have overlooked i don't want to overlook them help me to see what i need to see help me to be that sensitive to where you say samuel come here a minute i want you to see this i want to be that sensitive if there's something lacking in my life i want to be sensitive to where you can just pull me to the side in a personal i say oh yes lord and inquire oh my let's just not let we're not going to let this slip by it becomes part of our life to ask ask ask whatever you have need of ask ask glory be to god oh he's here hallelujah he's here whatever you have need of amen ask him glory be to god oh hallelujah glory be to god could we stand if you if you're able to stand you want to stand oh my let's just allow just worship him just allow the spirit of god we might be changing positions as far as standing rather than sitting and let's just just
