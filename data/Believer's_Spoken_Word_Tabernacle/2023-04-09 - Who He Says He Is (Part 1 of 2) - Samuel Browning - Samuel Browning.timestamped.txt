[30:58] [Music]
[31:06] sorry about that
[31:12] just a little nervous then a little
[31:14] testimony uh I'm going to thank you all
[31:17] for your prayers
[31:19] and Cardinal and and it was
[31:22] a lot rougher than what I thought I
[31:25] hadn't had anything hit that hit me like
[31:27] that since
[31:28] I was on my way to Germany on a troop
[31:31] ship and got seasick
[31:34] and I got so sick there was nothing else
[31:37] to come up and I thought my thoughts
[31:40] were they're going to find me right here
[31:42] I thought this is it you know
[31:44] so but this hit pretty hard and I it hit
[31:49] so hard I couldn't get my breath I
[31:50] blacked out
[31:52] and uh
[31:55] my wife said I was out about three
[31:57] minutes but
[31:58] when I'll come through I didn't know
[32:01] where I was at what was going on but I
[32:03] heard Shirley's voice calling my name
[32:05] that really helped so I had a time
[32:07] getting out when I was fail but God's
[32:11] good and even in all those he watches
[32:13] over us
[32:15] Hallelujah that's a little song on my
[32:18] heart and I got I wanted to read you
[32:20] this I found this it's in the Smyrna
[32:22] Church days
[32:23] and it was something that really helped
[32:26] me a lot I understand the godhead and so
[32:29] precious I hope it's I'll be a blessing
[32:31] until you're just a little quote he said
[32:33] what we have just set forth would be
[32:35] much easier for all to understand if all
[32:39] belief the doctrine of the Oneness of
[32:41] the godhead
[32:42] for there are not three persons in one
[32:45] godhead but one
[32:47] thus We Are Born Again by the spirit of
[32:49] life
[32:50] thus we are not born again by the spirit
[32:53] of Life Jesus coming in and then
[32:55] subsequently
[32:56] to that the Holy Spirit coming and
[33:00] giving us power
[33:01] if that was true why are we dishonoring
[33:05] the father but not giving him a part in
[33:07] our complete salvation
[33:09] for his salvation is of the lord and
[33:12] there are three Lords then he father
[33:14] must have something to do
[33:16] but surely it can be seen that Jesus
[33:19] made this very clear
[33:21] that he and he own
[33:24] who is God and is he and he alone who is
[33:29] coming into the believer John 14 16 says
[33:32] that the father will send another
[33:34] comforter but verse 17 says
[33:37] that he Jesus dwelleth with him and
[33:40] should be in them will come unto them
[33:45] thus it is the father Son and Holy Ghost
[33:48] all coming in at one time for as the one
[33:52] person
[33:53] comprising the godhead this event took
[33:56] place at Pentecost
[33:58] there aren't two Commons of the spirit
[34:00] just one the trouble is that people
[34:02] don't know the real truth and they
[34:05] simply believed in Jesus for remissions
[34:07] of sin but never go on to receive the
[34:10] spirit
[34:12] and that just helped me so much and I
[34:14] thought it might be a blessing to you
[34:16] and I'm going to try to sing this and
[34:18] it's on my heart and soul if you can
[34:21] sing with me and help me out a little
[34:24] right I need your help and it's down
[34:26] from his glory we didn't get to practice
[34:29] it or anything so I hope I hope they can
[34:31] pick me up on this
[34:36] down from his glory
[34:40] [Music]
[34:49] my God and say
[34:53] your game
[34:56] and Jesus was
[34:59] [Music]
[35:02] born
[35:04] in a manger
[35:09] to his own a stranger

[46:28] up here
[46:29] I'll make a song leader happy
[46:32] I'm finding myself
[46:37] had a loss for words
[46:41] and the funny thing is
[46:45] it's okay
[46:48] the last thing I need
[46:52] is to be heard
[46:56] hers morning Lord
[46:57] I wanna hear
[47:00] what you would say it's a word of God
[47:05] Speak

[47:39] [Music]
[47:48] amen
[47:57] we gather together
[47:59] appreciate all the songs and the
[48:00] specials amen the testimonies
[48:05] uh
[48:07] you know I think what we're going to do
[48:09] is you know brothers let's take out the
[48:12] first five pews
[48:13] and we'll just all cram together
[48:17] I must bite or something something
[48:20] but you know let me tell you what the
[48:21] prophet of God told us
[48:23] he said the anointing flows from the
[48:26] pulpit out
[48:29] amen
[48:30] so
[48:32] that's why many times I set where I sat
[48:35] amen I want to be close to it oh I I
[48:37] know it'll reach clear to the back
[48:39] there's times I've been strategic in a
[48:41] meeting and it might be a tight meeting
[48:43] I'd get right in the back or get right
[48:45] in the middle and just start pulling on
[48:46] the gift of God
[48:48] amen because I know one thing he's more
[48:52] than enough to meet every need
[48:54] in every circumstance and you know I
[48:57] just want to be a blessing I want to be
[48:59] a help the word of God means everything
[49:02] to me he's everything
[49:04] and I know that
[49:07] when he touches a life like he's touched
[49:10] mine
[49:11] they'll never be the same
[49:14] if there's one thing that I could desire
[49:16] for anyone
[49:18] and that's the same way that I feel
[49:20] about my children sure I I we want our
[49:23] children yes I I want them to you know
[49:26] certain things but that's not the
[49:28] priority of my life
[49:30] that's not the priority and I'm just you
[49:32] can talk to them about it
[49:34] the number one priority is is that they
[49:37] know
[49:38] Jesus Christ
[49:40] in the povert's resurrection because
[49:43] they've met him then everything else he
[49:48] will guide them and lead them and be
[49:50] with them when Daddy can't be there when
[49:53] situations don't know and what's coming
[49:55] on but they know the same God that their
[49:58] daddy knows and they have that same
[50:01] reality and when they face adversities
[50:03] of Life they have that Assurance I am
[50:06] with you and I'll never leave you nor
[50:09] forsake you
[50:10] so that that's my objective in life sure
[50:13] I believe in education or whatever more
[50:15] but education will never save a soul
[50:21] amen so good to be in the house of the
[50:23] Lord
[50:24] amen good to be here on this Easter
[50:25] Sunday
[50:27] amen and amen
[50:29] well let's just go into the word of the
[50:32] Lord here and I believe God really has
[50:35] he he never disappoints us he always has
[50:38] something for us and my prayer is and I
[50:41] ask that you would
[50:43] pray with me that God helped
[50:46] help the man of God to get out of the
[50:48] way
[50:50] because you know in every service
[50:52] there's many things that God has placed
[50:55] upon our hearts and there's a thought in
[50:57] what it is is it's he's the one who
[51:00] gives the thought and it's based on our
[51:03] needs
[51:04] you know God doesn't come Among Us and
[51:07] speak things and then we wonder and say
[51:09] well what does that what does that mean
[51:11] but God comes with purposely to minister
[51:15] to our needs and you know what I love
[51:18] about it is because sometimes there's
[51:19] things that you know I might know as a
[51:21] need
[51:22] sometimes I know of certain needs and
[51:25] you know how brother Brown will tell us
[51:26] and it's true sometimes we'll study
[51:29] and we study from where we see things
[51:31] are to where we need to be that to catch
[51:34] it to catch it in there but a man can't
[51:36] do that
[51:38] a man can't catch us from one place to
[51:40] another that has to be God
[51:42] and you know there's things that God
[51:44] comes and he does it in a way to speak
[51:47] to us what we have need of in our life
[51:50] and so I'm just going to speak here on a
[51:54] thought this morning the beginning of
[51:56] the week early one morning about three
[51:58] in the morning woke me up and just
[52:00] standing beside the bed
[52:02] and this is what this is the very
[52:04] thought that I'm going to speak on
[52:06] who he says he is
[52:09] who he says he is second Timothy chapter
[52:14] 1 verse 7.
[52:20] amen God bless the visitors and amen God
[52:23] bless you this morning
[52:26] amen
[52:30] for God hath not given us
[52:33] the spirit of fear
[52:36] but of power and of love
[52:39] and of a sound mind
[52:41] be not therefore ashamed of the
[52:44] testimony of Our Lord nor of me his
[52:48] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[52:51] afflictions of The Gospel According to
[52:54] the power of God
[52:56] who hath saved us and called us with and
[53:00] holy calling
[53:01] not according to our works but according
[53:04] to his own purpose and Grace which was
[53:08] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[53:10] world began
[53:12] but is now made manifest by the
[53:16] appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who
[53:20] hath abolished death and hath brought
[53:23] life and immortality to light through
[53:25] the gospel
[53:27] whereunto I am appointed a preacher and
[53:30] an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles
[53:33] let's just go to him in a word of Prayer
[53:36] hey man could we just pray together and
[53:38] let's pray for one another unless she's
[53:40] here unless just now just invite him in
[53:43] a personal way Heavenly Father Lord as
[53:46] we are gathered here Lord in this moment
[53:49] that God you have given us Lord in this
[53:52] space of time
[53:53] we pray father that Lord as we Look to
[53:57] You Lord and in this Easter morning Lord
[54:00] that is more than Lord just a memorial
[54:03] to our hearts Lord It's a reality Lord

[54:10] year Lord and how we thank you Lord God
[54:13] for your mercy Lord and Lord knowing
[54:16] that right here God that it's your
[54:18] desire to come and to minister to our
[54:21] hearts Lord and I pray that you would
[54:23] help us together Lord as speaker in here
[54:26] to get out of the way and just a step
[54:29] aside and Lord we want to invite you
[54:32] personally the Lord God that you would
[54:34] take control Lord in this service Lord
[54:37] and minister to our needs Lord Speak

[54:45] do Lord I pray that you will come Lord
[54:48] the Living God the supernatural Lord
[54:50] will move right Among Us oh God and
[54:53] confirm your word Lord to every heart
[54:56] Lord in every life oh God we pray we
[54:59] give you all the praise in the honor and
[55:01] glory in Jesus precious name amen
[55:05] amen why don't you greet someone as
[55:07] you're being seated in the name of the
[55:08] Lord amen just say it's good to be in
[55:11] the house of the Lord
[55:13] amen so good to be here indeed
[55:16] amen
[55:18] thank you Jesus
[55:21] Hallelujah
[55:22] amen
[55:24] so I want to take of this thought
[55:27] who he says he is
[55:33] you remember when he revealed himself
[55:37] to John on the Isle of Patmos he not
[55:41] only made himself known that I am he
[55:44] that was dead
[55:45] but I'm Alive forevermore
[55:48] and I have the keys of death hell in the
[55:50] grave
[55:52] so he manifest himself
[55:55] as the mighty conqueror
[55:58] and he made himself known as I am he
[56:01] which was
[56:03] which is and which shall come
[56:06] so it doesn't matter how the calendar
[56:09] changes how time changes
[56:12] he said I'm God and I change not
[56:17] his veils change his form changes but
[56:22] his nature his character never changes
[56:29] and I think of how that when brother
[56:31] Branham would take this in the message
[56:33] it is the rising of the Sun and we
[56:37] we hear this is a theme throughout the
[56:40] whole message because even as it was in
[56:45] the days of the Lord Jesus
[56:47] they had taken promises that were
[56:50] pertaining to the coming of the Messiah
[56:53] and there were other things that were
[56:55] wove in there that became traditions and
[56:59] it was just how that when they were
[57:02] looking at things they missed him for
[57:05] who he really was
[57:07] and God made himself known in such
[57:09] Simplicity and they were holding to so
[57:12] many other things and yet even when he
[57:16] the life-giver would call them they
[57:19] would fall back upon we are Abraham's
[57:23] seed but the Lord Jesus would stand
[57:26] there think about it these are
[57:28] individuals who could say the promises
[57:31] are Promises of adoption that are made
[57:34] and wrote to us as Israelites and they
[57:37] would be truthful and that would be
[57:40] indeed the truth but when the word would
[57:43] go to deal with their life they would
[57:46] fall back upon that where Abraham's seed
[57:49] but Jesus would point out to them if you
[57:53] were Abraham's children you would
[57:56] recognize me and matter of fact you
[58:00] would rejoice as he rejoiced when he saw
[58:05] my day
[58:07] because when God stood before the tent
[58:10] door of Abraham that Not only was a
[58:13] visitation for Abraham's life but it was
[58:16] prophecy that there was coming a messiah
[58:20] that could bring about a change in the
[58:24] inside of a life and a heart of a man in
[58:26] other words it was prophesying God would
[58:31] become flesh
[58:34] and Abraham rejoiced to see that day
[58:37] uh you see what was his rejoicing well
[58:40] his rejoicing is is that he recognized
[58:43] these three men that were walking down
[58:45] there's some things there's something
[58:47] special about that man right there in
[58:50] the middle
[58:51] he had a witness there's something here
[58:54] that is different and how did he Rejoice
[58:57] Abraham just didn't if I can say it this
[58:59] way blow out all the energy through the
[59:02] Smoke Stack but Abraham went and said
[59:04] Sarah the one that spoke to us in the
[59:08] beginning
[59:09] the one that has met me in dreams and
[59:12] lights and visions that same God is here
[59:17] before our tent door this morning
[59:21] I want him to feel welcome here go get a
[59:24] calf go make some corn cakes and go get
[59:27] some buttermilk I want to entertain him
[59:30] because when he's come he has something
[59:34] that he wants to say and is necessary
[59:38] and he wants to do
[59:41] because when we think of this day that
[59:44] you and I are standing in and I you know
[59:46] I think as I went through the stores and
[59:49] uh you know you know you go around and
[59:52] you see all this Easter candy and
[59:56] of course I don't believe in bunny
[59:57] rabbits the only ones I believe in is
[1:00:00] the white chocolate kind that I get
[1:00:04] but they don't have nothing to do with
[1:00:06] Easter
[1:00:08] right Easter egg hunting and had nothing
[1:00:10] to do with Easter and notice all the
[1:00:13] other formalities that even could be
[1:00:15] religious formalities of Lent and
[1:00:19] everything else what good does anything
[1:00:22] do if there is no life in you
[1:00:28] what good is it
[1:00:30] it leaves a person empty and this is why
[1:00:33] that when we look at the resurrection of
[1:00:36] the Lord Jesus this is why that the
[1:00:39] prophet could say it like this is it
[1:00:41] only a memorial now everybody in here
[1:00:43] knows what a memorial is you can travel
[1:00:45] to various parts of this country and see
[1:00:48] memorials you don't even have to leave
[1:00:49] actually the city of Lorraine you can go
[1:00:52] see different memorials from events that
[1:00:55] took place right here in this city is
[1:00:57] that right but they are memorials but we
[1:01:00] recognize that this right here this
[1:01:03] event was not just a memorial as far as
[1:01:07] we would have to travel to the land of
[1:01:10] Jerusalem it's more than a memorial
[1:01:14] it was an expression a witness a
[1:01:18] fulfillment of the prophecies that God
[1:01:21] declared and made in the hour that he
[1:01:24] had spoke and had been announced clear
[1:01:27] from the coming from the Garden of Eden
[1:01:29] I will make a way back
[1:01:32] now to think about it brother Brown
[1:01:34] would say it Satan doesn't care how
[1:01:37] religious you are
[1:01:39] how right you are in your Doctrine but
[1:01:42] if you miss the life you won't come up
[1:01:44] anyhow no matter how religious how good
[1:01:48] how many churches you belong to or will
[1:01:51] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:01:54] unless you have been born again
[1:01:57] let me just bring it close you could
[1:01:59] have set you could sit right there and
[1:02:01] have sat in the Branham Tabernacle when
[1:02:04] the sails were being opened and here the
[1:02:06] minister of the word but if you don't if
[1:02:09] you're never born again it will do you
[1:02:11] no good
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:14] what are you saying brother I'm saying
[1:02:16] there's a purpose for the message coming
[1:02:19] there's a purpose in the resurrection
[1:02:23] [Applause]
[1:02:25] therefore if God raised up Jesus from
[1:02:27] the dead now these are some questions
[1:02:29] did he raise him up for a memorial is
[1:02:33] this Resurrection morning only a one day
[1:02:35] in the year or a certain day that we
[1:02:37] celebrate this or are we benefactors of
[1:02:41] his resurrection what does it mean to me
[1:02:44] I think that's a question what does it
[1:02:46] mean to you
[1:02:48] now we believe by faith that he raised
[1:02:50] from the dead but what has that got to
[1:02:52] do with me
[1:02:54] that was 2 000 years ago
[1:02:57] so notice the ram picks it up and he
[1:02:59] says there had never been a time to that
[1:03:02] time
[1:03:03] that a man could lay his life down and
[1:03:06] pick it up again
[1:03:09] I don't care any other founder or
[1:03:11] whatever more they're still waiting
[1:03:13] outside of their tombs
[1:03:15] they're still waiting on Muhammad to
[1:03:17] rise and I got news for you he ain't
[1:03:19] gonna rise he's a false prophet
[1:03:25] come on friends God never called Ishmael
[1:03:29] Abraham's son he said to Abraham in
[1:03:31] Genesis 21 take Isaac thy only son
[1:03:37] because his promise is in Isaac
[1:03:41] foreign
[1:03:44] I'm not against anybody in the Muslim
[1:03:47] faith but I'm here to say there is a
[1:03:49] true Resurrection there is a life that
[1:03:52] you can enjoy right now and you're not
[1:03:55] waiting for some promise of perversion
[1:03:57] but there's a righteousness that comes
[1:04:00] through the life of Jesus Christ
[1:04:04] Hallelujah
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:06] that's what Jesus means to me
[1:04:09] there had never been a time to that time
[1:04:12] a man could lay his life down and pick
[1:04:14] it up again is that what he said he said
[1:04:17] I got power to lay my life down and
[1:04:19] power to take it up again
[1:04:22] Glory he defied that scientific proof
[1:04:26] they had by raising again
[1:04:28] and when they say now watch how this
[1:04:31] changes to this day
[1:04:33] because we in that quote right there I
[1:04:36] probably could have read that quote in a
[1:04:37] Pentecostal church this morning they'd
[1:04:39] have been shouting of course if I didn't
[1:04:41] tell him you know who said it but they'd
[1:04:43] have been something glory to God that's
[1:04:44] exactly right he defect but now let's
[1:04:47] bring it down to this day
[1:04:49] right because Satan don't care how much
[1:04:51] we rejoice in the history
[1:04:53] but he which was is and shall come when
[1:04:58] he made himself known to Abraham or to
[1:05:00] Moses and all he always said I am I am
[1:05:03] the god of thy father I am he never said
[1:05:07] I was I am he's oppressing God
[1:05:13] and when they say that Jesus Christ
[1:05:15] isn't the same yesterday today and
[1:05:17] forever his power isn't the same his
[1:05:21] gospel isn't the same when the Bible
[1:05:23] says it is the same God defied every
[1:05:27] denomination every Creed and he moved
[1:05:30] forth with his holy spirit as he
[1:05:32] promised and proved it to us that he is
[1:05:35] alive
[1:05:36] we are benefactors I'm gonna get to that
[1:05:39] word in a minute we are benefactors of
[1:05:41] his resurrection quickened after being
[1:05:44] dead in the world in sin and trespasses
[1:05:46] he has quickened us together with him
[1:05:48] raised with him now sitting in Heavenly
[1:05:51] places in Christ Jesus his Spirit look
[1:05:54] at this now his Spirit brings his same
[1:05:57] life again on the Earth
[1:06:01] that's what the coming of the Holy
[1:06:03] Spirit does is to bring his same life
[1:06:06] again upon the Earth
[1:06:09] let me just be very clear it's more than
[1:06:12] just an anointing
[1:06:14] that anointing comes by the word so it's
[1:06:18] anointing of the word that comes to
[1:06:20] express what is the true seed on the
[1:06:24] inside
[1:06:26] just talk to an individual yesterday
[1:06:28] that had gotten a number and called me
[1:06:30] up from a place here in Ohio and was
[1:06:32] talking to me and said you know he said
[1:06:34] they just kind of starting to hear about
[1:06:35] the message and things like that and you
[1:06:37] know as we begin to talk and he said I'm
[1:06:40] seeing certain things in a certain way
[1:06:41] and I go into churches and I see you
[1:06:44] know the women cutting their hair and I
[1:06:45] see all this and I know that ain't
[1:06:47] according to the Bible he said I know I
[1:06:49] said let me tell you what's taking place
[1:06:50] there's another seed that's being sown
[1:06:54] foreign
[1:06:55] it's not the seed of the word because if
[1:06:59] you sow the seed of the word it'll
[1:07:01] produce a word crop but when they start
[1:07:04] sowing other seeds of man's ideas man's
[1:07:07] thoughts man's reasoning all it does is
[1:07:10] produce a bunch of hybrid carnal
[1:07:12] Believers that won't line up with the
[1:07:15] word of God you might say brother Samuel
[1:07:17] that's a little bit strong but that's
[1:07:19] God's word you say why well how has that
[1:07:22] happened because they remember it's two
[1:07:24] Sowers one in white the son of man and
[1:07:27] one in black came behind and he shows
[1:07:30] the seed of discrepancy
[1:07:34] but the sowing of the word by the seat
[1:07:37] of the son of man will always call and
[1:07:40] point to a present life to a living
[1:07:43] reality not something way out there in
[1:07:46] the Milky Way but it will declare itself
[1:07:48] through and behind flesh
[1:07:52] Hallelujah
[1:07:54] if the spirit of God anointed that body
[1:07:57] in such a way now notice that body was
[1:08:00] anointed and when that seed fell on the
[1:08:02] earth he just he just raised him up
[1:08:04] right there he wouldn't let him rest
[1:08:06] there the quickening power raised him up
[1:08:09] now I want to say this we are
[1:08:11] benefactors and to be a benefactor is to
[1:08:14] be a beneficiary that probably is a more
[1:08:17] common word for us which what is a
[1:08:19] beneficiary it's a person who derives
[1:08:22] Advantage from something
[1:08:25] especially a trust a will or a life
[1:08:29] insurance policy
[1:08:31] not only did the Lord Jesus draw the
[1:08:36] full benefit but he came back in order
[1:08:39] to share those benefits with you and I
[1:08:42] let me just say it like this we couldn't
[1:08:44] tap into the benefits we could talk
[1:08:47] about them they could look at him but he
[1:08:49] himself was one to satisfy
[1:08:52] but claims and he drew upon those
[1:08:55] benefits what was the full drawing on
[1:08:58] the benefits you say he healed the sick
[1:09:00] he did he fed the hungry he did but the
[1:09:03] full drawing power of the benefit is the
[1:09:06] resurrection that would raise one up who
[1:09:09] was dead and bring him to life you say
[1:09:11] what has that got to do with me you and
[1:09:14] I were dead in sin and trespasses
[1:09:18] thank you
[1:09:20] Hallelujah but he came by our way
[1:09:24] as a beneficiary
[1:09:28] Oh my he raised again for our
[1:09:31] justification and he come to share the
[1:09:33] benefits
[1:09:37] now in this text said I read Paul is
[1:09:40] calling
[1:09:41] in the admonition by reality in his
[1:09:43] heart
[1:09:44] be a partaker
[1:09:45] of the Affliction the gospel
[1:09:48] according to the power of God in other
[1:09:49] words be all in
[1:09:54] be all in don't don't have one bit don't
[1:09:56] have one part of your life out
[1:09:59] hey man if you're not in get in if
[1:10:01] you've got to toe out get it in
[1:10:03] so the token so the life can operate
[1:10:06] because there are afflictions that come
[1:10:08] there are tests there are trials that
[1:10:10] come but listen friends these are things
[1:10:13] that Paul said being a partaker of the
[1:10:16] afflictions of The Gospel According to
[1:10:19] the power of God so in other words the
[1:10:22] tests and trials that come our way from
[1:10:24] being all in from being fully committed
[1:10:27] fully surrendered those are tests and
[1:10:29] trials that have come to mold and shape
[1:10:32] us and to declare to you and I when I
[1:10:35] don't think I can stand another moment
[1:10:37] but there's one in you that's standing
[1:10:41] Hallelujah when our strength gives way
[1:10:44] there's one there's a strength greater
[1:10:47] on the inside of our lives
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] oh Hallelujah
[1:10:55] who saved us
[1:10:58] in verse 9 who saved us and called us
[1:11:01] with the Holy calling
[1:11:04] we have received an invitation to a
[1:11:07] feast
[1:11:11] now I'm trying to tell anybody how to
[1:11:13] have their wedding reception
[1:11:15] I mean I'll just be on this is me I
[1:11:17] don't like stuff too fancy anyhow I'm
[1:11:19] not just give me one fork I can lick
[1:11:21] that fork off and what I eat my salad
[1:11:23] with I eat my steak with I don't need
[1:11:24] all that stuff
[1:11:27] but I've been there is a wedding
[1:11:29] reception and it ain't nobody here that
[1:11:31] anybody knows but I was just a young boy
[1:11:33] and I was you know I was kind of hungry
[1:11:34] after waiting for that wedding and we
[1:11:36] get down there
[1:11:39] and I I just hope that that's not that
[1:11:41] wedding reception was not a prophecy of
[1:11:43] every southern wedding reception
[1:11:46] we got in there and there wasn't no
[1:11:48] tables they were all setting up chairs
[1:11:50] we looked like we were in another
[1:11:51] meeting and walking up to the table and
[1:11:53] getting little cups and nuts and little
[1:11:55] quarters of bologna sandwiches
[1:12:00] foreign
[1:12:02] you can tell I was disappointed
[1:12:06] you defend me roasting carrots I'd have
[1:12:08] been all right and I hate carrots
[1:12:12] but everything you know we've not been
[1:12:14] called to to uh to uh to to a table of
[1:12:18] hors d'oeuvres to just a little bit and
[1:12:20] a little bit of this but we have been
[1:12:21] called to a feast
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:28] Jesus when he was here think of it when
[1:12:30] he was here you can't call nobody to a
[1:12:33] feast unless you got something to give
[1:12:35] them
[1:12:36] right that's why Brothers before you
[1:12:39] start inviting people over your house
[1:12:40] you better make sure you got food in the
[1:12:41] house to feed them
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:44] that's why you got to check with your
[1:12:45] wife
[1:12:47] but I'm saying like this with this fees
[1:12:49] that you and I have been called to there
[1:12:52] is a meal that's already been provided
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:12:56] and that's why Jesus when he stood there
[1:12:58] and he called to them to Israel he came
[1:13:01] and he said the feast is ready come and
[1:13:05] they started making excuses
[1:13:07] you know I've got I need overtime I got
[1:13:10] a boat I got this and I got that and I
[1:13:12] go you say brother Samuel they didn't
[1:13:14] have boats and have what they did have
[1:13:16] they had everything back there but they
[1:13:18] made excuses why they couldn't come and
[1:13:21] you know what they could be legitimate
[1:13:23] excuses but this is the thing that
[1:13:25] separates when you recognize who's
[1:13:28] calling you and what you're being called
[1:13:30] to that it's worth more than your job
[1:13:33] it's worth more than your Associates
[1:13:35] it's worth more than anything you're not
[1:13:38] just being called to a meal you are
[1:13:41] being called To The Feast of the Lord
[1:13:46] to be a partaker of his glorious life
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:52] he called us with the Holy calling I
[1:13:55] like this part not according to our
[1:13:58] works
[1:14:05] the Bible said in Romans 9 before
[1:14:09] either one he saw her Jacob had done
[1:14:12] good or evil God said I love Jacob and I
[1:14:16] hate Esau
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:18] word hate does not mean like you think
[1:14:20] it means it means to love less
[1:14:22] [Applause]
[1:14:24] oh you hearing me now
[1:14:26] but God before anything was ever done so
[1:14:29] you say what was it that Drew God to
[1:14:33] Jacob because Jacob was a part of God
[1:14:36] from the beginning
[1:14:38] he was the son of God from the beginning
[1:14:41] nothing in this earth transformed or
[1:14:45] changed him from a pig to a sheep
[1:14:48] are you hearing me now
[1:14:50] but what happened is that he got in the
[1:14:54] presence of God and there's something
[1:14:55] that's rising up in Jacob he longed for
[1:14:58] that Birthright he wanted that
[1:15:00] Birthright he valued that Birthright he
[1:15:02] slept about that Birthright he dreamed
[1:15:05] about that Birthright he talked about
[1:15:07] that birthday that's all Jacob caring
[1:15:09] about
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:13] but he saw he didn't care about it
[1:15:18] he was given first priority
[1:15:22] Jacob seemingly didn't have a Fighting
[1:15:25] Chance
[1:15:26] because he won the firstborn
[1:15:29] but you see just because you're close
[1:15:32] don't mean you're close enough
[1:15:34] oh my God
[1:15:35] are you hearing me now you can be face
[1:15:37] to face with Jesus and still not be
[1:15:39] close enough
[1:15:40] the Rich Young Ruler was face to face
[1:15:42] with him but he wasn't close enough
[1:15:45] what was it the very thing that he held
[1:15:48] on to in his life and made excuses for
[1:15:50] and reasons for is the very reason that
[1:15:52] he ended up walking away he was close
[1:15:55] remember what Jesus even said to the
[1:15:57] once Christ Thou Art near the kingdom of
[1:16:00] God
[1:16:01] right he had a righteous rightful answer
[1:16:03] but he went from being close so close to
[1:16:07] so far away
[1:16:08] you say what makes a difference on
[1:16:10] depends on your attitude and what you do
[1:16:12] with what you're hearing
[1:16:15] so it's not according to your works you
[1:16:17] can do all the works in the world and
[1:16:18] still be the most miserable person in
[1:16:20] the world
[1:16:21] are you hearing me I'm not talking about
[1:16:23] an outward work I believe an outward
[1:16:25] works but I believe outward works are
[1:16:26] only expression of the grace that has
[1:16:28] come to you and you've received in your
[1:16:30] own life
[1:16:31] I believe in works the Bible talks about
[1:16:33] where faith that works our faith
[1:16:36] expressed if you're not expressing what
[1:16:38] you believe you say you believe then you
[1:16:40] don't believe it you're only saying you
[1:16:41] believe it
[1:16:44] not according to our works but according
[1:16:47] my my my to his own purpose and Grace
[1:16:51] which was
[1:16:53] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[1:16:56] world began but is now everybody say now
[1:17:00] May manifest by the appearing of Our
[1:17:03] Savior Jesus Christ so what is being
[1:17:06] unfolded to you and I the purpose the
[1:17:08] calling the grace that is given to us
[1:17:10] from the foundation of the world so his
[1:17:13] coming was with a purpose in Redemption
[1:17:17] and it came to those that were included
[1:17:20] all along and then let them know you are
[1:17:23] included in Redemption and you have a
[1:17:27] right to draw upon the benefits
[1:17:30] now I want you to think how Paul is
[1:17:32] declaring this of the appearing I want
[1:17:34] to just kind of make a little Sidetrack
[1:17:35] here right now on this appearing part
[1:17:37] because it's very very important because
[1:17:39] remember how that here in the days of
[1:17:42] the Lord Jesus when he raised I remember
[1:17:44] he appeared uh to there Mary Magdalene
[1:17:48] he paired to appeared to the other women
[1:17:50] he appeared to many that were there of
[1:17:53] his disciples now I want to just deal
[1:17:55] with this a moment Paul is declaring the
[1:17:58] benefit of the appearing of the Lord
[1:18:00] Jesus through the light of the Gospel it
[1:18:02] is a great benefit what Paul has said it
[1:18:06] brings life and immortality to life once
[1:18:09] something has become light it is
[1:18:12] understanding it is made manifest
[1:18:14] there's no more guesswork in it no more
[1:18:17] maybe so could be might be but life
[1:18:20] brings certainty
[1:18:23] now Paul would write it like this in
[1:18:25] second Timothy 4 8 that that in
[1:18:28] henceforth there is later for me a crown
[1:18:30] of righteousness talking about a new
[1:18:31] body which the Lord the righteous judge
[1:18:34] shall give me at that day and not to me
[1:18:36] only but unto all also that love his
[1:18:40] appearing
[1:18:42] now I want you to think about this
[1:18:43] because there are two words and actually
[1:18:46] the same word appearing can be used in
[1:18:49] the New Testament and it will mean the
[1:18:51] appearing of the very life of Jesus
[1:18:54] Christ in a body of Believers and then
[1:18:57] it will also mean the appearing when he
[1:19:00] was here in his Corporal body
[1:19:04] are you with me so now when Paul is
[1:19:06] talking about those who love his
[1:19:09] appearing now when there's an appearing
[1:19:12] let's just look at how the prophet says
[1:19:13] it he said what we are witnessing we
[1:19:16] have already seen and are witnessing the
[1:19:19] appearing of the Lord and he said now
[1:19:21] remember appearing and coming that's two
[1:19:23] different words it's to appear and then
[1:19:25] to come oh my my we could preach on that
[1:19:28] one right there it's to appear and then
[1:19:30] to come because when he appears to you
[1:19:33] then he's announcing I'm coming to you
[1:19:37] and his appearing is also preceding or
[1:19:41] announcing the second coming is on
[1:19:46] oh my you see the same way there is the
[1:19:48] same way of how he deals with us in the
[1:19:50] New Birth now now is the appearing he's
[1:19:53] already appeared in these last days
[1:19:55] right here with us in the last few years
[1:19:57] it's a sign of his coming he's appearing
[1:20:00] in his church in the form of the Holy
[1:20:02] Spirit showing that it's him because
[1:20:05] people cannot do these things that you
[1:20:07] see the Holy Spirit doing that's the
[1:20:10] appearing of the Lord Brother Brown
[1:20:12] picks it up again and he says there is a
[1:20:14] great big difference in the sign of
[1:20:16] Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming
[1:20:19] now the appearing of the Lord is right
[1:20:23] now when he's appearing in his people
[1:20:27] are you hearing me now where now is the
[1:20:30] appearing when he is appearing in his
[1:20:33] people
[1:20:34] his Spirit working among them proving
[1:20:38] that it's him with them getting them
[1:20:40] ready for the Rapture for the coming of
[1:20:43] the Lord to catch away his bride be
[1:20:45] appearing in the coming so the purpose
[1:20:47] of the appearing is to get a people
[1:20:50] ready for the rapture
[1:20:53] now the Bible tells us in Revelations 19
[1:20:56] uh be glad and rejoice for the marriage
[1:20:58] of the Lamb has come and his wife hath
[1:21:01] made herself ready right how can you
[1:21:05] make yourself ready unless there is a
[1:21:08] call that goes out to you and unfolds to
[1:21:11] you of how to make yourself ready you
[1:21:14] say what is that that's Grace that's
[1:21:16] given to you and I in this hour we
[1:21:19] wouldn't know how to find ourselves out
[1:21:20] of a paper bag if not for the grace of
[1:21:23] almighty God but God in his mercy and
[1:21:26] Grace has opened up the word of God to
[1:21:29] you and I that we're not staring at the
[1:21:31] word of God and looking at it as a
[1:21:33] history book but we see it as a book of
[1:21:35] Prophecy we see that it speaks of me it
[1:21:39] speaks of this hour and it is a pathway
[1:21:41] that is opened up to me back into the
[1:21:44] holist of holies
[1:21:45] is that right so it is the pairing of
[1:21:48] the Lord right now it's getting a people
[1:21:51] ready for rapture
[1:21:54] glory be to God in the highest
[1:21:57] Hallelujah
[1:21:59] oh my here he is the appearing on the
[1:22:02] Messiah in the form of the holy spirit
[1:22:04] in the church
[1:22:06] because
[1:22:08] you know how do you know a pear tree is
[1:22:10] a pear tree
[1:22:13] come on somebody say it
[1:22:15] all right it produces not just fruit
[1:22:17] produces pears right
[1:22:21] how do you know an apple tree is an
[1:22:23] apple tree
[1:22:24] produces apples
[1:22:27] right it's the life in it
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:30] right so whatever the life is in that
[1:22:33] tree
[1:22:34] it will produce
[1:22:36] now you know you can see this a brother
[1:22:39] man testifies in oven you can go on the
[1:22:41] internet and look it all up but you can
[1:22:42] take a branch of a citrus tree of an
[1:22:45] orange and graft it into a lemon tree
[1:22:48] and you know what it is Citrus life but
[1:22:51] it will not bear lemons it'll still bear
[1:22:53] oranges
[1:22:55] why because that's what the branch is
[1:22:58] the Citrus life only reveals what the
[1:23:00] branch was all along
[1:23:02] but if that lemon tree if it puts forth
[1:23:06] a branch of its own what will it bear
[1:23:09] then
[1:23:10] lemons is that right that's the way it
[1:23:13] was even when Moses remember there was a
[1:23:16] question and that question there was
[1:23:18] dispute among the people about who is to
[1:23:21] stand in the priesthood let me tell you
[1:23:23] something it's just like the devil when
[1:23:24] he wants to dispute with your life let
[1:23:27] me tell you you'll never defeat him in
[1:23:29] the outer Court
[1:23:30] you'll never defeat him in the injust
[1:23:32] the inner inner Court just in the spirit
[1:23:34] man you've got to get it right back to
[1:23:36] the Shekinah Glory back to the sacred
[1:23:39] Sands because right there is where all
[1:23:41] disputes are settled it's in the
[1:23:44] presence of almighty God it's when the
[1:23:47] pillar fire comes the amen of God is
[1:23:51] what comes down and declares what is
[1:23:53] really true
[1:23:55] come on Friends
[1:23:56] they took every one of them sticks in
[1:23:58] there but guess what it was Aaron's Rod
[1:24:01] back bottom blossomed and burnt almonds
[1:24:05] all in one 24-hour period
[1:24:08] let me tell you something you don't have
[1:24:10] to wait a month or Sundays to become a
[1:24:13] fruit bearing Holy Ghost Field
[1:24:15] Victorious overcoming Powerhouse of God
[1:24:18] what do I do get into the holiest of
[1:24:22] holies
[1:24:23] [Applause]
[1:24:25] get into the presence of God
[1:24:36] I want you to think of this
[1:24:39] I'm gonna just stop right here as he's
[1:24:41] speaking to me it doesn't matter what
[1:24:43] you feel about yourself
[1:24:47] it's true you may not be worthy there
[1:24:50] aren't one of us Worthy
[1:24:52] I don't care if you cut your teeth on a
[1:24:54] message Pew you are not more worthy than
[1:24:57] anybody else
[1:24:59] but I'm telling you when Jesus Christ
[1:25:01] comes by your way
[1:25:03] it's a time to start doubting your
[1:25:05] doubts
[1:25:06] and move right in with the grace of God
[1:25:09] that's coming your way he will lift you
[1:25:12] the woman at the well she didn't debate
[1:25:14] whether she was worthy or not
[1:25:18] Jesus himself came to the well at a time
[1:25:22] no other body would be there that was a
[1:25:24] time when those kind of women would come
[1:25:26] but Jesus had an appointment because he
[1:25:29] knows if I can just get to that scene
[1:25:35] Hallelujah
[1:25:36] she's had a lot of thirsts but there
[1:25:39] will come a satisfaction she'll leave
[1:25:42] this well a different woman she'll live
[1:25:45] it like a real lady
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:54] um
[1:25:55] what do you say I say when he's
[1:25:57] appearing to you move with it
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:01] don't wrestle with it just go with it
[1:26:06] all through the scripture the pattern
[1:26:07] remains true
[1:26:09] to every believer throughout the
[1:26:10] scripture you will read where the Lord
[1:26:12] appeared unto them and it was always
[1:26:15] with a designated purpose in mind
[1:26:18] I wish I had time to read it but I I
[1:26:20] don't have time to read through all of
[1:26:22] this but the Bible would talk about in
[1:26:24] Genesis chapter 12 verse 7 and the Lord
[1:26:27] appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy
[1:26:31] seed will I give this land and their
[1:26:33] build he and altar unto the Lord who
[1:26:35] appeared unto him what was Abraham
[1:26:37] worshiping by he was worshiping by a
[1:26:40] word that was spoken that word was
[1:26:43] leading him to the appearing
[1:26:46] and when he appeared Abraham knew this
[1:26:50] is a place for me to build an altar and
[1:26:53] worship
[1:26:54] boy I feel good right now when he's
[1:26:57] appearing to you when he's manifesting
[1:26:59] himself to you don't wait just start
[1:27:02] worshiping him as he's appearing to your
[1:27:05] life as he's speaking to you Lord You're
[1:27:07] appearing to me this is personal listen
[1:27:10] he didn't mistake you for somebody else
[1:27:13] sitting on your Pew he's appearing to
[1:27:16] you
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:18] Genesis 17 1 when Abraham was 90 years
[1:27:22] old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram
[1:27:26] and said I am the almighty God walk
[1:27:28] before me and be thou perfect Genesis 18
[1:27:31] 1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[1:27:35] plains of mammary and he sat in the tent
[1:27:37] Door In the Heat of the day now in
[1:27:39] Genesis 26 24 this is to Isaac and the
[1:27:42] Lord appeared unto him the same night
[1:27:45] and said I am the god of Abraham thy
[1:27:49] father
[1:27:53] every time God Appears when he appears
[1:27:56] to Jacob he doesn't say I am the god of
[1:27:58] your grandfather Abraham he said I am
[1:28:00] the god of your father Abraham
[1:28:03] why because God don't have no
[1:28:05] grandchildren
[1:28:08] Hallelujah every one of God's children
[1:28:11] are firstborns first generation they are
[1:28:14] part because this generation does not
[1:28:16] die the Bible said in Matthew chapter
[1:28:19] one now these are the generation
[1:28:22] of the birth of Jesus Christ not
[1:28:26] Generations because this generation had
[1:28:30] no beginning and it has no ending
[1:28:33] their flesh bodies died yes they did but
[1:28:37] we're talking about the where the body
[1:28:39] was not the word but the word was in the
[1:28:42] body and the word is what was a part of
[1:28:45] the seed that was declared and spoken
[1:28:47] from the beginning
[1:28:48] so his appearing
[1:28:50] is with a purpose
[1:28:55] I said his appearing is with a purpose
[1:29:00] he just didn't come among them
[1:29:02] just to get them all stirred up
[1:29:05] he came with a purpose
[1:29:07] the appearing of the word is with a
[1:29:10] purpose there is a message to be
[1:29:14] declared
[1:29:15] there is a purpose and it is Grace that
[1:29:18] is given to you and I so it's a purpose
[1:29:20] to make manifest to reveal that of true
[1:29:23] life and immortality so let me just say
[1:29:25] it like this it's not a random event
[1:29:30] I want to just make that clear and just
[1:29:31] sit on that for a moment this is not a
[1:29:34] random event
[1:29:36] it's not a bunch of loosely connected
[1:29:38] events it's not a happenstance that
[1:29:40] you're here
[1:29:42] it's not just by chance that the message
[1:29:45] came across your path
[1:29:47] it ain't a random event
[1:29:50] sure you might have been in places that
[1:29:52] you never intended to be but God knew
[1:29:54] where you was going to be
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:58] and let me tell you you and I weren't
[1:30:00] looking for him he came looking for us
[1:30:02] [Applause]
[1:30:04] you said I had a desire for him but you
[1:30:06] didn't put that in there God put that
[1:30:08] desire in there that's why David could
[1:30:10] say that my soul long and after thee oh
[1:30:14] God
[1:30:15] and David knew that the same God that is
[1:30:19] in the sanctuary he can be the same God
[1:30:21] in a dry and thirsty land he can take a
[1:30:24] try and thirsty land and change it into
[1:30:27] a place of Springs of Living Water
[1:30:30] [Applause]
[1:30:35] it isn't a random event let me just
[1:30:37] preach now
[1:30:39] the appearing of the Holy Spirit look
[1:30:43] he spoke to Abraham in Genesis 12
[1:30:45] actually with Genesis 11.
[1:30:48] what
[1:30:49] all along proof he was appearing to him
[1:30:52] words Visions dreams right he appeared
[1:30:57] right there in flesh melchized he
[1:30:59] appeared he continued to appear let me
[1:31:01] just say this to you Abraham no doubt
[1:31:04] could have looked at his life and said
[1:31:05] man I you know I just don't seem to be
[1:31:09] where the word is calling me to be but
[1:31:11] what Abraham did was entertain what God
[1:31:14] was appearing and saying to him what are
[1:31:17] you saying brother Samuel I'm saying
[1:31:19] that every experience that God has given
[1:31:22] you don't discount it because you can't
[1:31:25] see the full evidence in your life I'm
[1:31:27] telling you to walk on from experience
[1:31:30] to experience until your life has been
[1:31:33] fully changed what are you saying I'm
[1:31:36] saying press on little Lilly that's
[1:31:38] above the mud pass above all the dawn
[1:31:42] that's what I'm saying that ain't a
[1:31:44] random event
[1:31:47] well brother Samuel I was at a meeting
[1:31:49] and I got up and I'm still dealing with
[1:31:51] some of the same thing that ain't a
[1:31:53] random event
[1:31:56] don't discredit it don't discount it but
[1:31:58] let it let it be known to you God cares
[1:32:01] about you he loves you and he wants to
[1:32:03] do for you
[1:32:05] [Applause]
[1:32:07] boo devil
[1:32:09] [Applause]
[1:32:13] Hallelujah I'm saying boo if you don't
[1:32:15] have the strength to say boo I'm saying
[1:32:18] boo devil
[1:32:20] because I'm claiming you as godship
[1:32:23] [Applause]
[1:32:30] Hallelujah
[1:32:34] these are not random events
[1:32:39] Acts chapter 1 verse 2 until the day in
[1:32:42] which he was taken up after that he
[1:32:44] threw the Holy Ghost had given
[1:32:46] Commandments unto the apostles whom he
[1:32:49] had chosen let me read on now verse 3 to
[1:32:53] whom also he showed himself alive after
[1:32:57] his Passion by many infallible proofs
[1:33:01] and being seen of them 40 days and
[1:33:02] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[1:33:04] kingdom of God
[1:33:05] let me just say this the things that he
[1:33:07] did that were infallible proofs
[1:33:09] it was the same things that he did
[1:33:12] when he was walking in his flesh before
[1:33:14] Calvary
[1:33:17] yeah
[1:33:19] yeah matter of fact during this journey
[1:33:22] of 40 days at the first part of it they
[1:33:25] didn't know where he was going to show
[1:33:26] up
[1:33:28] you know what brother Brown was telling
[1:33:29] us he said Jesus when he was everything
[1:33:32] was going on he came out and walked
[1:33:34] beside him on the road he came into the
[1:33:36] house when he was invited he met him
[1:33:37] there when they were out fishing
[1:33:39] couldn't take anything and then he
[1:33:41] hollers from the shore how did his voice
[1:33:43] get there I don't know but it got there
[1:33:44] and he said hey have you got any fish
[1:33:47] little children they said no we don't
[1:33:49] got no fish he said cast your net on the
[1:33:52] other side
[1:33:57] he said cast it on the other side when
[1:34:01] they cast it on the other side what was
[1:34:03] it they were not able to even hardly
[1:34:06] pull the net onto Shore and when Peter
[1:34:09] saw it
[1:34:11] he didn't even lend him a hand and
[1:34:13] pulling it in he took off running
[1:34:19] because he knew I know who's on the show
[1:34:22] his appearing his appearance is
[1:34:27] declaring this is him
[1:34:31] he's the only one that can put fish in
[1:34:34] my net let me say this he's the only one
[1:34:36] that can put joy in your marriage he's
[1:34:39] the only one that can put real
[1:34:40] overcoming in your life he's the only
[1:34:42] one that can give you the real strength
[1:34:44] over all the vices of the devil he is
[1:34:47] the only one and let me tell you he's
[1:34:50] still in the business of putting fish in
[1:34:53] Nets
[1:34:58] Hallelujah
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:01] glory be to God acts 10 39 and Peter
[1:35:05] standing in cornelius's house he said
[1:35:07] and we are all we Are Witnesses of all
[1:35:10] things he did both in the land of the
[1:35:12] Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and
[1:35:14] hanged on a tree him
[1:35:17] God raised up
[1:35:19] the third day
[1:35:21] and showed him openly I want you to
[1:35:23] catch this raised him up on the third
[1:35:26] day according to the word
[1:35:31] is that right
[1:35:32] and he showed him openly
[1:35:36] now he would seem like openly to
[1:35:39] everybody
[1:35:42] but notice the next verse not to all the
[1:35:46] people
[1:35:47] but unto Witnesses
[1:35:50] chosen
[1:35:53] God even to us who did eat and drink
[1:35:56] with him after he rose from the dead
[1:36:00] sure Peter was chosen Andrew was chosen
[1:36:02] Paul was chosen on and on even after
[1:36:05] this but let me say this that brings you
[1:36:08] and I to a reality that God in this last
[1:36:11] days has raised beyond all traditions of
[1:36:15] man and it's made himself known not just
[1:36:18] to anybody but to Witnesses better
[1:36:22] chosen of God before the foundation of
[1:36:26] the world
[1:36:29] you've been chosen to see the just one
[1:36:37] I didn't choose it you didn't choose it
[1:36:40] we were in God's choosing and he's
[1:36:43] appeared to you and I because we were
[1:36:47] included in him before the foundation of
[1:36:50] the world
[1:36:52] you ought to square your shoulders back
[1:36:55] in safe Blue Devil
[1:37:09] so as the pattern of his appearing is to
[1:37:12] his children it's for the purpose that
[1:37:15] they might know him
[1:37:17] know his will
[1:37:19] and that he might make the promise alive
[1:37:22] in and through them
[1:37:26] are you hearing me now
[1:37:28] in John 16 7 here he stands with them
[1:37:31] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[1:37:34] expedient for you that I go away
[1:37:37] remember Peter was ready to fillet some
[1:37:39] people
[1:37:42] Peter was a good one buddy I'll tell you
[1:37:43] what that guy was he can handle he could
[1:37:46] handle a knife
[1:37:48] it's it is expedient for you but I go
[1:37:51] away
[1:37:52] Peter even told him not so Lord
[1:37:55] but but the Lord Jesus hear the
[1:37:57] discernment of the word said get behind
[1:37:59] me Satan he never called Peter Satan
[1:38:01] never called him the devil but he
[1:38:02] recognized the influence that was coming
[1:38:04] upon him was trying to keep him from the
[1:38:07] promise that was needed
[1:38:09] you know Peter didn't even recognize
[1:38:12] that the things that he was out of human
[1:38:14] compassion that here that Spirit came
[1:38:16] upon him and said not so lord they're
[1:38:18] not going to do this for you Peter did
[1:38:19] not realize that this is what I really
[1:38:22] need that this is what the coming of the
[1:38:25] Holy Ghost is going to do for me this is
[1:38:27] going to be greater my my been sitting
[1:38:30] around the campfire hearing a hunting
[1:38:32] story it's going to be greater than
[1:38:34] hearing somebody else's testimony I'm
[1:38:36] going to have a testimony myself
[1:38:43] it is expedient for you that I go away
[1:38:48] for if I go not away the comforter will
[1:38:51] not come unto you but if I depart I will
[1:38:55] send him unto you
[1:38:58] just so there's no confusion to send two
[1:39:01] people
[1:39:02] it's the same God fulfilling one office
[1:39:05] in order to bring one another office
[1:39:08] into manifestation
[1:39:11] is that right because you you in order
[1:39:13] to be a father you first have got to be
[1:39:15] a husband
[1:39:18] come on now one office leads to another
[1:39:21] office
[1:39:23] man I feel like running right now
[1:39:26] John 14 18. let's just let's just deal
[1:39:29] with it now I will not leave yet
[1:39:32] effortless
[1:39:34] I will come to you
[1:39:38] it wasn't us receiving the body but the
[1:39:41] same one who was in that body
[1:39:45] that was appearing and making himself
[1:39:47] known as the Messiah
[1:39:50] he said I will come to you
[1:39:55] when I have been offered up when the
[1:39:58] sacrifice is made that expediency that I
[1:40:01] go away back then when I'm seated there
[1:40:04] in the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:40:07] meaning power and authority let me tell
[1:40:09] you something the devil ain't got no
[1:40:11] power over you
[1:40:13] you don't know what I'm bound with
[1:40:15] there's one who already raised he's
[1:40:17] seated in power and honor and Glory why
[1:40:21] don't you just let the Rays of the
[1:40:23] strength of the son shine down in your
[1:40:25] life
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:28] hmm
[1:40:31] yet a little while in the world see me
[1:40:33] no more but you'll see me
[1:40:36] thank you Lord they ain't going to see
[1:40:38] the Corporal body no more
[1:40:42] all they're going to be able to talk
[1:40:43] about it'll just be history but you'll
[1:40:45] see me
[1:40:49] because I live you shall live also
[1:40:54] you know what it is
[1:40:57] Hallelujah
[1:41:00] it's he who has the policy coming among
[1:41:04] policyholders
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:11] self to be the same
[1:41:14] I said who are the policyholders are you
[1:41:16] a policy holder
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:20] policyholder now just stay with me now
[1:41:23] but because the policyholders are those
[1:41:26] that are named and included in the
[1:41:29] Testament of his will they are the names
[1:41:31] that have been wrote before the
[1:41:33] foundation of the world Revelations 13 8
[1:41:35] when the lamb will slain before the
[1:41:38] foundation of the world you know what
[1:41:40] it's saying there is a security in our
[1:41:43] identity in the lab because you are the
[1:41:46] word you always were the word you can
[1:41:48] never be deceived
[1:41:51] what is it brother Samuel you are
[1:41:54] ordained to receive life
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:57] can I save this person up you are
[1:42:00] ordained to recognize him in this
[1:42:03] generation in this day to see him that
[1:42:07] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:42:09] and forever
[1:42:11] and he was announcing to them when he
[1:42:13] rose up the same life that has quickened
[1:42:15] me and raised me up I'm sending it back
[1:42:18] to you not only have I come to be the
[1:42:21] blessing I've come to share the blessing
[1:42:23] and the very essence of the message that
[1:42:25] I'm releasing to you is I am alive and
[1:42:28] because I live you shall live also it's
[1:42:33] the light that's vindicating it is that
[1:42:36] right he was a comforter when he was
[1:42:39] with him
[1:42:40] right but he told them that it was
[1:42:43] necessary that I go away
[1:42:46] because if I don't go away the comforter
[1:42:49] can't come
[1:42:51] he is the Waymaker for the comforter to
[1:42:54] come
[1:42:55] is that right he still is the Waymaker
[1:42:58] for the comforter to come so he's
[1:43:01] speaking to policyholders now I wanted
[1:43:03] to say it like this you know there's
[1:43:05] appropriate channels for benefits to be
[1:43:07] released
[1:43:13] you know we're living probably in a day
[1:43:15] and age and I guess everybody's been
[1:43:17] done you've got some real corrupt people
[1:43:18] that'll take life insurance policies out
[1:43:20] on their loved ones and their loved ones
[1:43:22] don't even know it
[1:43:26] well it's just a spirit of this age
[1:43:28] lovers of themselves more than lovers of
[1:43:30] God
[1:43:32] come on Friends
[1:43:35] but you see I want you to notice that
[1:43:37] there's appropriate channels for these
[1:43:39] benefits to be released
[1:43:42] because if you're if you're a
[1:43:43] beneficiary on a life insurance policy
[1:43:46] you need to file a claim with a company
[1:43:49] in order to collect the death benefit
[1:43:52] the benefit ain't just going to come to
[1:43:53] your mailbox because you're included in
[1:43:55] it
[1:43:56] you've got to recognize I'm included in
[1:43:58] it and then you get a file for a claim
[1:44:01] this part belongs to me
[1:44:04] come on now Acts chapter 1 verse 4 and
[1:44:07] need notice being assembled together
[1:44:09] with them he commanded they should not
[1:44:11] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[1:44:13] promise of the Father which saith he ye
[1:44:15] have heard of me notice he was declaring
[1:44:19] them he had already breathed upon them
[1:44:21] receive ye the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:23] for John truly baptized with water but
[1:44:26] ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:44:28] not many days hence but ye shall receive
[1:44:31] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[1:44:35] upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto
[1:44:39] me
[1:44:40] now this power
[1:44:42] is God's dunamis power
[1:44:45] that's his quickening power
[1:44:48] John 1 I believe it's 1 16 said he came
[1:44:51] to his own and his own received him not
[1:44:54] but as many have received him to them he
[1:44:58] gave the power
[1:44:59] escousia not due to miss
[1:45:02] cusia is the right to become sons of God
[1:45:06] so he is coming to you his appearing to
[1:45:10] you is ministering our rights that are
[1:45:14] included in the policy that then by
[1:45:17] faith how do we get Faith by his
[1:45:19] appearing and we recognize he's speaking
[1:45:23] to me
[1:45:24] then we can go and draw upon the
[1:45:28] benefits of the policy
[1:45:30] oh my no wonder David could say in Psalm
[1:45:34] 16 11 thou Wilt show me the path of life
[1:45:40] now I'll just say it like this you know
[1:45:42] it's a responsibility here of the
[1:45:44] policyholder whoever takes it out you
[1:45:46] know a lot of times you have loved ones
[1:45:48] you have different ones
[1:45:50] that take out those policies
[1:45:53] and uh I know sometimes they may not
[1:45:55] want to tell who's on it or whatever
[1:45:57] because
[1:45:59] such loving families
[1:46:02] we'll make the Hat Hat Films and McCoys
[1:46:04] look like kindergarteners
[1:46:08] and they got their pistol behind their
[1:46:10] back at the funeral waiting for the
[1:46:11] funeral to come in so we're going to
[1:46:12] start taking heads off
[1:46:15] so sometimes they do those things but
[1:46:17] I'm not talking about the colonel realm
[1:46:19] I'm talking about in that of the
[1:46:21] spiritual Realm
[1:46:23] because it's really the the ideal like
[1:46:25] when I when I did a reading on this part
[1:46:27] of it just looking over some things the
[1:46:29] ideal way is for the person who takes
[1:46:32] out the policy is to make it known to
[1:46:35] the people who are on it
[1:46:37] are you hearing me now the person who
[1:46:40] takes out the policy to make known to
[1:46:43] the people while they are alive while
[1:46:45] they are with them while you can touch
[1:46:47] me and I can say William you are
[1:46:49] included you're not but William you're
[1:46:50] included in my policy I'm alive right
[1:46:53] now right you can handle me right you
[1:46:56] you can look right at me and me being
[1:46:58] alive is letting you know that once I
[1:47:02] pass from this realm to that realm that
[1:47:05] you now can draw on the benefits of that
[1:47:08] policy and that's why the Lord Jesus
[1:47:10] when he makes himself alive and known
[1:47:13] and appears to you and I according to
[1:47:16] his word he is letting you and I know
[1:47:18] that you are in the policy
[1:47:21] that word it is something that's
[1:47:23] gripping your life it's taking a hold of
[1:47:26] your life it's something you can't get
[1:47:28] away from it has a meaning to you
[1:47:30] there's things you can't explain why
[1:47:32] because your name is included in the
[1:47:36] policy
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:39] but you've got to draw on the benefits
[1:47:43] of that policy
[1:47:46] it'll do you no good unless you draw on
[1:47:48] the benefits
[1:47:50] you can walk around all day long and say
[1:47:52] well you know I'm a I'm a benefit
[1:47:54] policyholder you are yeah they left me
[1:47:57] you know 250 000 they did
[1:48:01] yeah they did have you handled any of it
[1:48:04] no
[1:48:05] ain't seen none of it
[1:48:08] now somebody could have a right to call
[1:48:10] you a liar
[1:48:12] because you're saying you got a claim on
[1:48:14] a policy and somebody put your name on
[1:48:16] it and they are no longer here but
[1:48:18] you're included in their policy and you
[1:48:20] say no I've not received what's included
[1:48:22] in that policy then they've got a right
[1:48:24] to doubt who you say you are
[1:48:27] but when you file a claim upon that then
[1:48:31] you receive what is in the claim and
[1:48:34] then they can ask you and say did you
[1:48:36] receive all that was in the writing what
[1:48:39] the writing promise have you received it
[1:48:42] and they can say I have received all
[1:48:45] that was promised unto me and that's
[1:48:48] what the real baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:50] is it's the holy ghost coming right
[1:48:53] Among Us it's Ministry speaking his word
[1:48:56] and he's calling us to what recognize
[1:48:59] the benefits that belong to you and I as
[1:49:02] believers
[1:49:03] it would be a shame to have benefits and
[1:49:06] not exercise our Authority in them
[1:49:11] he is coming to energize our faith in
[1:49:15] him
[1:49:17] I got one more little turn here
[1:49:18] Leviticus 23 there's no way I've got a
[1:49:21] many turn but there's no way I get to
[1:49:22] all them Leviticus 23 right here the
[1:49:25] Bible tells us not here Moses is
[1:49:28] prophesying of the time that when Israel
[1:49:30] is going to come into the land when you
[1:49:31] come into that land now notice in verse
[1:49:34] 10 of Leviticus 23 speaking to the
[1:49:36] children of Israel and saying to them
[1:49:37] when you become into the land which I
[1:49:40] give you and shall reap the Harvest
[1:49:43] thereof then ye shall bring a sheath of
[1:49:46] the first fruits of your Harvest unto
[1:49:49] the priest now notice you will bring a
[1:49:52] sheep when you get in the land in the
[1:49:54] position that place that I've given to
[1:49:57] you you bring a sheath to the priest to
[1:50:01] be accepted for you verse 11 and he
[1:50:03] shall wave the sheath before the Lord to
[1:50:06] be accepted for you on the more after
[1:50:08] the Sabbath the priest shall wave it now
[1:50:10] that she that was that of a seed that
[1:50:13] had went in the ground and it had come
[1:50:16] up though that that that part of the
[1:50:18] field it had come up and come to
[1:50:20] maturity first in other words it was had
[1:50:22] went in the ground as a sheet and he had
[1:50:24] come all the way up through that of you
[1:50:27] know shouting a sprouting tassel and
[1:50:29] shut all the way back to the original
[1:50:32] form once again and now when you come
[1:50:35] into the land then think about it they
[1:50:37] would not be able to come into the land
[1:50:39] until the Harvest would be ready
[1:50:41] remember when God brought them in the
[1:50:43] land he rained down Manna but after then
[1:50:47] that Manna had ceased they were
[1:50:49] circumcised they ate the old corn of the
[1:50:52] Lamb what were they eating they were
[1:50:54] partaking of resurrection power seed
[1:50:58] that had went in the ground and had come
[1:51:00] back up to life and they were living of
[1:51:02] resurrection power so God knows exactly
[1:51:05] that's why it's not a random event
[1:51:07] that's why the Lord Jesus it was no
[1:51:09] happenstance that he was taken there on
[1:51:12] the 10th day and crucified there it was
[1:51:15] no happenstance that he fulfilled healed
[1:51:17] every Prophecy of the scripture
[1:51:21] can I say this it's no happenstance that
[1:51:25] we are here this morning it's not a
[1:51:27] random event of where we're standing and
[1:51:30] scriptures are being fulfilled
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:35] man Hallelujah let me just say like the
[1:51:38] prophet said he said the New Testament
[1:51:40] speaks of this hour
[1:51:43] the whole new testament speaks of this
[1:51:46] hour
[1:51:48] glory be to God because this is the hour
[1:51:51] of the Bride the hour where the groom is
[1:51:55] veiled in Pride form
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:52:00] who are you you are his victory
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:07] the waving of the sheep was a testimony
[1:52:10] there's more coming
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:14] I don't care how many websites you put
[1:52:16] out
[1:52:17] there's more coming
[1:52:20] [Music]
[1:52:21] I don't care how many unbelieving Devils
[1:52:23] they're still coming
[1:52:25] why you can't stop God's word
[1:52:30] though many disbelief it cannot hinder
[1:52:34] God
[1:52:35] I don't care how many skeptic tries you
[1:52:39] can't stop the fulfilling of God's word
[1:52:42] [Applause]
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:47] that way she was a sign it's in effect
[1:52:51] that's why the prophet let me just slow
[1:52:54] down just a moment here
[1:52:56] that's why the prophet could declare now
[1:52:58] think of it
[1:53:00] he's standing here in 1963.
[1:53:03] and he's declaring to the people
[1:53:06] he's been here all along
[1:53:08] the token is now manifesting himself
[1:53:12] right Among Us proving he's the same
[1:53:15] Jesus
[1:53:17] so the token
[1:53:18] is him
[1:53:20] he's right Among Us his appearing the
[1:53:23] wave sheep what's he doing he's making
[1:53:25] himself known to policy holders
[1:53:29] whose names
[1:53:31] are in the book
[1:53:34] well who's the one declaring the names
[1:53:36] in the book the same one that descended
[1:53:39] with a little book in his hand
[1:53:42] what's a little book it's the lamb
[1:53:44] section
[1:53:46] come on now
[1:53:48] fear not little flock
[1:53:51] it's the father's Good Will to give you
[1:53:53] the kingdom
[1:53:55] that's why God ain't in numbers God
[1:53:57] don't need numbers God just needs
[1:53:58] surrendered hearts
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:03] it's the same token Among Us Now notice
[1:54:06] whatever the token did then
[1:54:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:54:11] forever
[1:54:12] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:54:14] right so therefore the token itself
[1:54:18] it cannot be present fully in a life if
[1:54:21] a life says well I don't know about that
[1:54:23] part of the word
[1:54:25] that's not the token
[1:54:27] because he cannot deny himself
[1:54:30] oh that's not necessary he cannot deny
[1:54:32] himself
[1:54:34] are you hearing me that see this is what
[1:54:37] separates this is what separates this is
[1:54:39] what makes who says he is
[1:54:43] who he says he is he is
[1:54:47] let me just try to tie this up now
[1:54:49] he says who he says he is he is who that
[1:54:52] he who he is now think about it when
[1:54:54] you're looking at a token I know this is
[1:54:56] simple but I just want to drop this and
[1:54:58] putting it in very clear because as a
[1:55:00] token when you know you know when I've
[1:55:03] had to buy buy airplane tickets I might
[1:55:05] have the money
[1:55:06] I could go right up and say you know
[1:55:08] what I'm going to go to the Delta
[1:55:09] counter over here and I'm going to send
[1:55:11] them in the cash
[1:55:13] or you know I can go to the plane I'm
[1:55:14] getting on that plane
[1:55:17] or train
[1:55:18] the bus
[1:55:20] now let me ask you I could go up there
[1:55:22] and I could have a wad of cash in my
[1:55:24] wallet in my pocket had be a different
[1:55:27] feeling I don't know what it feels like
[1:55:28] but
[1:55:29] you can walk up there to the gate first
[1:55:31] of all you ain't even going to get to
[1:55:33] the gate nowadays
[1:55:35] I don't care how much cash you got
[1:55:39] right and you better have flight
[1:55:41] oh this could preach you better have
[1:55:43] flight ready
[1:55:45] symbols on your license right now
[1:55:48] or you're packing a passport to fly
[1:55:50] domestically
[1:55:51] are you hearing me now hold my I think
[1:55:53] it's a time of seal in it it's a time to
[1:55:55] say I'm flat ready I've already been
[1:55:57] pre-approved
[1:56:00] [Applause]
[1:56:01] shown the proper documentation I've went
[1:56:05] through yeah it was a hassle but I went
[1:56:07] through it now all I got to do is show
[1:56:09] them there the identity I've got a seal
[1:56:12] on my license that says I'm approved to
[1:56:15] fly domestically I've already been
[1:56:18] cleared I am who I am
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:24] I don't know
[1:56:25] and the token is an identification of
[1:56:28] his presence in our life
[1:56:31] because you could have all the money in
[1:56:33] the world but you got to have the ticket
[1:56:36] because when you go through those Gates
[1:56:37] they want to see they want to scan my
[1:56:39] ticket then they want to see my license
[1:56:41] they want to take that because I'm not
[1:56:44] just scanning my license they want to
[1:56:45] know okay this is your license but now
[1:56:48] that ticket it lets me know that you
[1:56:50] have got a flight that is scheduled for
[1:56:53] departure
[1:56:55] [Applause]
[1:56:57] in other words you wouldn't be here
[1:56:58] right now if you didn't have a flight to
[1:57:00] catch
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:06] has come among us because it's time for
[1:57:10] us to catch a flight home
[1:57:13] brother we ain't going in an airplane
[1:57:18] amen this is the astronaut age an age
[1:57:22] where lies it's scared escape the pool
[1:57:25] of gravity escape the pool of the world
[1:57:28] escape the sin the flesh the gavel and
[1:57:31] everything this is a rapturing age a
[1:57:35] rapturing moment and I have been
[1:57:37] approved by Christ himself
[1:57:42] mama mama
[1:57:45] so let me say it like this
[1:57:47] the chief engineer is present
[1:57:50] [Applause]
[1:57:54] you know brother Ram talks about that
[1:57:56] little guy that was out there you know
[1:57:57] working on the car the brand said he
[1:57:59] touched this to this to that to the you
[1:58:01] know I kind of put myself there
[1:58:04] when I had to work on a lawnmower or
[1:58:06] whatever you know what you're doing not
[1:58:07] a clue
[1:58:08] [Laughter]
[1:58:11] thank God for a little bit of YouTube
[1:58:12] videos for other people who didn't have
[1:58:13] a clue but now they've got Clues and
[1:58:15] they can get all the clues together
[1:58:17] but he was touching this wire to this
[1:58:19] wire to this wire to that wire nothing
[1:58:20] happened this this try to check this out
[1:58:22] change that this isn't doing but look he
[1:58:24] was very busy
[1:58:26] you hear me he was very busy changing
[1:58:27] this changing that trying this trying to
[1:58:29] trying to trying this trying to you
[1:58:30] couldn't say he wanted a worker
[1:58:33] he was a worker
[1:58:35] but the problem with it was
[1:58:37] is he didn't know how to order the
[1:58:38] things
[1:58:41] but here came one up
[1:58:44] he didn't have grease up to his elbows
[1:58:50] he came up in a suit and tie
[1:58:53] he looked over and he said hey
[1:58:57] he's a guy can I share something with
[1:58:58] you
[1:59:00] now what if that little guy would have
[1:59:01] looked up and said
[1:59:03] you ain't even got grease under your
[1:59:05] fingernails and you're going to tell me
[1:59:07] something
[1:59:12] but I believe
[1:59:14] I believe God bringing this spiritual I
[1:59:16] believe there was a presence
[1:59:19] that's there I believe there's a
[1:59:22] presence that moves Upon Our Hearts
[1:59:25] that brings humility
[1:59:27] you say brother Samuel that sounds
[1:59:28] Supernatural it's all Supernatural
[1:59:33] it's pretty super how this natural
[1:59:35] responds to the supernatural
[1:59:40] and here he was
[1:59:41] he looks up at that man
[1:59:43] he said what is it he said well
[1:59:46] if you'll Touch This
[1:59:48] to this and move this right here this
[1:59:51] wire it should start for you
[1:59:53] so he did that
[1:59:56] all he had to do was do what was said
[1:59:59] he obeyed he said how do you know he
[2:00:01] obeyed because he did it
[2:00:03] he did it yeah he did it
[2:00:07] he sacrificed all of his however he
[2:00:10] sacrificed it and he obeyed
[2:00:13] got in
[2:00:14] turn the key
[2:00:17] started up
[2:00:19] when it started up he came out
[2:00:21] he wasn't just saying glory to God it
[2:00:23] started Glory they got to start he came
[2:00:25] out when it started he said who are you
[2:00:28] you see he recognized somebody knew this
[2:00:33] situation
[2:00:35] and he asked the man who are you
[2:00:37] he said I'm the one that designed that
[2:00:39] engine
[2:00:44] there's nobody oh you can struggle all
[2:00:47] your life trying to put this together
[2:00:49] put this together put this together put
[2:00:52] this together do this but the chief
[2:00:54] engineer if you only yield to his voice
[2:00:58] he'll let you know what to put together
[2:01:01] and the engine will run
[2:01:05] he's the one who knows how to turn on
[2:01:07] the lights he's the one who knows how to
[2:01:10] make Sons sons and daughters daughters
[2:01:16] this is why in Romans 8 10 if Christ be
[2:01:20] in you the body is dead because of sin
[2:01:22] but the spirit is life because of
[2:01:25] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[2:01:28] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[2:01:31] in you
[2:01:33] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[2:01:35] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[2:01:39] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:01:42] Oh my he wasn't just only the word but
[2:01:45] he was God himself
[2:01:46] it took mechanics and Dynamics coming
[2:01:49] together
[2:01:50] that body was laying there in the Tomb
[2:01:53] it was cold it was stiff it was dead
[2:01:58] but it took life
[2:02:01] it took the life Giver to come
[2:02:04] and raise him up again
[2:02:07] you know why he was pointing out what
[2:02:10] you and I would need to receive it would
[2:02:13] have to be God not a church
[2:02:17] Hallelujah the prophet was a vessel that
[2:02:20] the wave Chief himself has been waived
[2:02:22] over the people once again
[2:02:26] come on Friends it was a declaration
[2:02:29] this is a sign of his coming it's his
[2:02:32] appearing and he's letting you and I
[2:02:34] know the message was not to Rally around
[2:02:37] tapes not to Rally around books not to
[2:02:40] travel to Jerusalem or Jeffersonville
[2:02:42] but the message is get under the blood
[2:02:47] get in Christ
[2:02:50] be full Uncle Holy Ghost
[2:02:56] that's what the message is all about
[2:03:01] um
[2:03:02] and the bride herself let me tell you
[2:03:05] the bride is standing upon Earth
[2:03:09] she's standing we're not a fragmented
[2:03:12] bunch of people we have been brought
[2:03:15] together by the spirit of almighty God
[2:03:17] and the same spirit of God that has
[2:03:19] brought us together with him he'll
[2:03:22] dissolve all differences he'll settle
[2:03:24] all doubts come on Friends it ain't up
[2:03:27] for you and I to get into baiting with
[2:03:29] one another but let him be the
[2:03:31] Difference Maker falling in love with
[2:03:33] the Lord Jesus Christ let him be
[2:03:35] glorified in his body let him be
[2:03:38] glorified in your life
[2:03:40] it's a testimony you and I are called to
[2:03:44] let him be seen in your life
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:49] I say today
[2:03:50] this is where you recognize
[2:03:54] brother Brandon would say he had not
[2:03:55] only filled their spirit
[2:03:58] inside but it quickened their mechanics
[2:04:01] so they just didn't feel their Spirit
[2:04:03] where they felt the anointing upon them
[2:04:06] but he went down upon that seed
[2:04:09] because that's what the Holy Ghost was
[2:04:11] for
[2:04:12] the Holy Ghost was not to fall upon our
[2:04:14] spirit to where we would only you know
[2:04:17] speak in tongues if that comes or
[2:04:18] prophesy or preach or when they it went
[2:04:22] for that the word the Holy Spirit was
[2:04:23] come to make the word live
[2:04:27] where the word was laying in our life
[2:04:30] cold dead beneath the darkness of
[2:04:34] Genesis 1 beneath the darkness of our
[2:04:37] life let me tell you something we just
[2:04:39] weren't in darkness we were Darkness
[2:04:42] Paul said ye sometimes were Darkness
[2:04:46] but now are ye light in the Lord
[2:04:50] how are you liked because he is the
[2:04:52] light
[2:04:53] and he has come to light up your life
[2:04:59] let me just say it like this
[2:05:02] how will the world know that he lives
[2:05:08] how will they know
[2:05:12] I'm grateful that I know
[2:05:15] and I've experienced
[2:05:17] being a benefit policyholder aren't you
[2:05:21] I mean I can share with somebody else
[2:05:23] hey
[2:05:24] he means what he says
[2:05:26] and let me just tell you this every
[2:05:29] promise in him is ye and amen
[2:05:32] when I need healing amen when I need
[2:05:38] to live all included all that I have
[2:05:40] need of is included in this policy bless
[2:05:44] the Lord O my soul and all that is
[2:05:47] within me and forget not all his
[2:05:50] benefits
[2:05:53] glory be to go nice
[2:05:57] but how will others know
[2:06:01] the only way they'll know
[2:06:03] is when they see Jesus
[2:06:06] in you and me
[2:06:10] is that right
[2:06:12] that's the only way they'll know it
[2:06:15] brother Bram says when the spirit of God
[2:06:16] in man in you manifests the life of
[2:06:19] Jesus
[2:06:20] like the main spring in a watch
[2:06:24] every tick every part of it moves right
[2:06:27] it controls your emotions
[2:06:31] I like that
[2:06:33] the mainspring controls my emotions
[2:06:37] it controls your habits
[2:06:40] it controls your senses it controls your
[2:06:44] faith
[2:06:45] that's what it does think about when
[2:06:47] they were Israel in the midst of a
[2:06:49] battle
[2:06:50] here was a man that fell they were
[2:06:52] running
[2:06:53] what did they do
[2:06:55] they just threw that body in there into
[2:06:56] the grave
[2:06:58] they didn't know hearing what they'd
[2:07:00] thrown it on here was here was the bones
[2:07:02] of Elijah
[2:07:04] Elijah was already gone to Glory
[2:07:07] Rock but then quick at quickening power
[2:07:09] that resided in that life was still
[2:07:12] there upon Them Bones it wasn't the
[2:07:15] bones that brought that man to life it
[2:07:17] was the quickening power
[2:07:19] yeah
[2:07:20] well Mom and Daddy it's not your efforts
[2:07:23] that bring them to life should
