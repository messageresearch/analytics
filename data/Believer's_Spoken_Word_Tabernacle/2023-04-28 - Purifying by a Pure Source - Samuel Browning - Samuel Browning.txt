amen just so thankful to be in his presence tonight and amen to be gathered brothers and sisters of like Precious faith amen I know that um we are thankful for the work that we see done out there and uh so you just keep praying and know that the only thing that's left is that crew to come right back and that should be just a few weeks until we get that Roofing so it'll match the roofing here and then I think that brother Richie is going to be working on all the soffit work and all those things so it's going to be nice when it's really finished I'm thankful thankful we're not pulling up and looking at toothpicks sticking in the air no more hahaha but because you feel like you miss a meal or something you know but uh no it's uh we're just thankful to the Lord that God has provided quite a bit of a story even behind all that but we just thank God for that and ask the Lord to bless amen that crew of Amish that came and did that and so we just thank God for that thank God for all the work that was put into it and the laboring and there's still more just continue to pray amen God will just make a way we can get that Roofing and things here but I'm glad it's very nice very nice so glad to be here tonight and man just so enjoyed the word of the Lord this past weekend and just was so thankful amen for God's grace amen so we want to just look here in the word and tonight thank you musicians and brother Brian if we could let's stand and I want to read from a very familiar place in first John chapter 3 and um just some things that when we begin to look at a useful life here within the Book of Job and right there in job 22 where we've been and wanting to remain as a useful truly a useful life I I don't want to just sit around brother Brown said I'd rather wear out than rust out and over and over and yet brother Brennan would balance that with the statements as well as is what God has called to be done he didn't lay all that burden upon one man as if one man feels the burden to do it all because that's that's the equation for Burnout is that right and uh so when we see this what we want to be what we want to be is is just available I want to always be available because one thing that we don't know is we don't know when God will use us and for what he will use us for and it might be to speak or to minister to someone else to testify witness our life we don't know but we always want to be a channel that's available to him and that's one thing if we can have a declaration in our hearts if there's one thing I'm going to be reserved to I want to be reserved to the presence of God that's that's the objective that's the Forefront that's the goal amen within within our lives because um like when you consider brother Stephen was mentioning ministering here on Sunday on the cure for fellowship and I want you to as you catch that it's a two-fold because we can look at it and say well that part within our life is a cure it was what God was Desiring that Fellowship but do you realize that was a longing that God put in your heart too is that right that's why brother Branham when he preaches and he deals with the messages on communion and he deals with a communion it's where there's a mutual agreement and one can speak to one and one can speak back to another and there's only one place of Fellowship one place of communion and that's under the blood and there's only one thing that can truly satisfy any heart any believer's heart and that's communion with God there's nothing the world itself I know we can all testify there's nothing that from before God got a hold of our lives and even yet now there is nothing that satisfies the believer like his presence he is our satisfying portion amen and we are so thankful for that amen so as we're looking here at the word in first John chapter 3 verse one if you wouldn't mind could we just ask the Lord just his Blessing and Leadership here before we read Heavenly Father we just Lord invite you Lord knowing that God that you're here father you said where two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in the midst of you and Lord there's no greater desire that we would have that you would come in our midst may you move down upon us Lord move Among Us may it become Lord so personal Lord to each and every one of our hearts and our lives Lord tonight you know our needs Lord and father there's a desire we've not only come to worship you but we've come to hear from you Lord that God that when we would leave out of here that God will leave out of your lord being better Christians Lord we know that we cannot Lord do anything once that Soul has been changed oh God it's passed from Death unto life but we want to serve you better Lord that if there's anything Lord oh God may you just come and guide us Lord we do not Lord like Paul profess to be perfect but Lord we are pressing to that profession Lord God and Lord we just ask that you'll come in a special way and anoint us together speaker in here and may you receive all the glory we pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen familiar scripture here in first John chapter 3 and verse 1. and here John would write behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed on us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not frankly put we're not of this world we're not of this world sure we walk around in our outer garments and we have oh you're from this country oh you're from this nation or you've but within we are of the Tree of Life Amen in verse 2 beloved now are we the sons of God I want you to notice how he draws that now to the Beloved are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen you know because we're seeing him right now as he is amen verse 3. and every man that hath this hope in him what hope that hope that expectation that I shall see him I'm looking forward to his coming so every man that has this expectation in him watch what he does purifieth himself now notice purifieth it's ongoing purifieth himself even as he is pure so what is the purpose of our purifying is because we have an expectation in our hearts we have already been purified by the blood of Jesus Christ and because of that that stands out in such a contrast to everything else around us and the more that we we stay in his presence as we're feeding on the word and maturing we even find ourselves beginning to distance ourself from our own Nativity our own upbringing our own birth we begin to distance ourselves from we always done this my family always did this because why we're recognizing I'm not of this world I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham I'm the son of God beloved now are we the sons of God so I'd like to speak here tonight if God will help us on um of the thought and I think I sent that to purifying by a Pure Source purifying by a Pure Source God bless you as you're being seated unless the reading of the word many of these things as you know are just you just keep as the Lord deals with in your study and a lot of times there's things that we come in that has been laying before us here for some time and and just waiting on the Holy Spirit and his timing to actually uh get to some of these things and even as we took that thought last week on how the Lord brought that with David and Abigail and that channel and I want to deal with this this thought of it here on this ongoing purification and purifying by a Pure Source and when you look here in verse 3 because I I believe this with all my heart we need a continual purifying now once your soul let me just set this straight once your soul has been purified by the blood of Jesus Christ we're all unbelief has been removed because sin itself is unbelief all the attributes when it comes to dress and it comes to all the types of things are like those are only attributes that come out that declare they're still unbelief so when unbelief is dismissed the attributes flee and that's what the Holy Spirit comes to deal with is that root of unbelief so once the life has been pure that Soul by the new birth then we're not in a place of purifying our souls but it is living in a place to where as we said moments ago there's such a distance and that part we begin to see the contrast of things that surround us and we then operate and are looking to God through the purifying source that Lord let everything within me let it be pleasing to you and you find that as we grow on and as we mature that immaturity even the little crumbs stick out in our lives as Believers things that once that at one time that we could Overlook and it isn't necessarily that we were willfully overlooking it's just God God knows how to deal with our lives at just the right time and I'm glad about that God didn't leave that for somebody else to deal with my life or God knows how to deal with each of our lives with everything and just at the right time and through that maturing things begin to stand out and the changing within our lives and I mean and even when God is dealing with our hearts when God was wooing us and drawing us to himself remember it how it took a place to where for us giving ourselves to God giving ourselves to his word and as we would walk in obedience to the word we would find a cleanness that would come in our life and what would happen through that cleanliness is more courage would come for a deeper promise of God so the word Works in our life to really bring us courage in approaching the promises of God so notice every man that hath this hope in him so this is our expectation and I want to just say it with something that's very familiar to you and I that brother Brandon would tell us like this he says if there was one in this city that was going to be going in the Rapture the faith that you want to have is I'm that one and it's not about that we're better than anyone else that's not what it's about it's not me comparing myself to anybody else because we realize Paul told us that that's foolishness to do that but it's looking at the word and the word examining our life and we know from our soul there is an amen to the word of God and know that I have passed from Death unto life I know that it isn't something that somebody has told me I know it and I see the effects of it in my life and so that's the faith that I'm living by that if there's going to be one I'm going to be that one because I have that Assurance in my life and so then I live by that faith in my life and that's why brother Brandon could go on to say he would say I want to live so close to him to where that when I know he's going to take me when he comes I don't want to live just see how far I don't want to I don't want to have a casual approach because truly the thought of predestination when it really strikes the heart predestination is the unmerited grace of God in real the real revelation of predestination does not bring loose living sorry the real revelation of predestination it's simply that there is within your heart and your life something that part of God himself that can respond to God thank God for his grace it doesn't promote that it doesn't cultivate that as a matter of fact the word itself when we look at it it comes to cultivate our walk with God and to think about him if we're in love with God why would we want to live far from him I want to live close to him I want to I want to live so close to him to the to the Rose of Sharon is the is the aroma of my life I want to live so close to him to Lily of the Valley I want to live so that I'm I'm in that you know I often tease our boys there at home and I say if I can just get in the vapor trail I won't have to use any cologne or nothing I just don't know if I can just walk in that Vapor trial you just let me know when because it's just like sometimes it just seems like a cloud I know you that's where I want to live is in the cloud of the Shekinah Glory they would take there of the of the prayer and of the of of all the beaten material and they would offer it there on the fire and it just becomes a cloud before the mercy seat I want my life don't you want your life to be sold I want it to be that I want it to be a when you walk among people we walk among lives we're in our homes we want our lives to be a refreshing I want to live that close to him until I know that he is going to he's going to take me when he comes and I want everything to be in line with that so now as we even see that part in the scripture that's an expectation every man that hath this hope in him I've got an expectation for his coming I'm looking for his coming I don't want to be in a place to where I have to sit that I would even have the thought oh Lord don't come this moment oh Lord don't come tomorrow we want to live ready to go let me just go on a side track that's why I've never understood the whole part about of communion even needing to be announced so far in advance now I do it but I don't understand the part where you've had oh because listen what if he comes before communion over the same you gotta we've got to give us time to make everything right we should live ready we should live in a place with no regrets as if he can come in the next moment because we're not even guaranteed to make it to communion service is that right and so the effect of the expectation I want you to notice here's the effect of that expectation we have on our hearts is that it's a purifying of ourselves so let me say this to you we realize brother Brown would tell us he said for you take he said a person that's trying to clean themselves up all your all you're doing is is making your spots like the spots on a leopard you only make them stand out more so it shows that when this scripture says purifieth himself that this is not where I'm purifying myself as by my own means it speaks I have an access as a Believer to a source that brings Real Purity that's a privilege of being a believer that's a privilege of being in fellowship with God that's a privilege of being under the shed blood I'm just talking to you tonight about one of your benefits forget the lot the Lord and all his benefits this is one of the benefits we have an access to a source of purifying Our Lives and I don't need to purify my soul when I've been born again but I must purify every other area of my life is that right don't give any place to the devil tear down strongholds right so all of this this is God's commissioning to our hearts and I'll say it like this as we go on because I'll even come to a place here to where even no matter where you're at in your journey if you've not come to that place of the new birth it's still taking the word and you've got to come according to the source of purification which is the word of God in order for it to lead to a real Pure Life and a real pure birth so here's an ongoing purifieth himself and notice even as he is pure Soul it's not me uh with my reasoning it's not me or you looking at something else but it's him who is standing in view it's him that I'm beholding it's him that I'm examining My Life by because he is Paul said he has been made to be our wisdom our Redemption our sanctification he is our all in all so he's making himself known and as he reveals himself let me just say this when the prophet says that we are to pray for Revelation more than anything else friends I do not believe that that statement there is a few paragraphs there that brother Adam makes that statement in regard solely to Doctrine but he is talking about the revealing of the person of Jesus Christ when the revelation of Jesus Christ was made known to John in Revelations chapter 1 it took the life out of him he said I fell at his feet as dead and I believe with all of my heart to say oh God you say brother Samuel can we have that experience we can't and we need to continue to have experience after experience after an experience when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time he said I can no longer be the same William Branham that I was he didn't get born again when he went beyond the curtain of time but he came into a press a place that he realized nothing else in this earth matters he already felt that way but he came forth with such a determination I'm not going to let nothing stick in my life nothing hold me back oh may God give us Grace may we pursue that to live under the effect of that Realm that he has made a way for us there's a battle to live in Heavenly places and I can't deal with that tonight but there's a battle and there's always that to try to keep you out but to think of how the word comes like a Waters of separation Upon Our Lives to bring a conviction to bring leadership to bring Direction and you see when we serve God when you think about last week when we were talking about David and you talk about David and Saul even in that when you look at David's life David's reverence for God and dwelling in God's presence is what gave him strength to look Beyond Saul let me just tell you something David absolutely held nothing in his heart against Saul because when some men came to him and those men said look what we've done we've killed your enemy Saul and David just steps back and said you've got your own death sentence even when one came and killed there one of Saul's Sons and then he comes Blessed Be him of the Lord I have killed thine enemy David was not even viewing Saul in that way it showed his approach because he could look at that and say you're not fearful to even touch the Lord's anointed and what I'm saying is is that David's strength has he said in Psalms 27 my strength is in the Lord he is the strength of my life that's how David was living in Victory in our life let me just say it like this we are not and the the if we can call them like this bumps in the roads or things that come along in our pathway and things that come and challenge us are not just oh why did that bump happen oh why did this have to happen those are all opportunities for growth is that right I think brother Stephen brought that out even as we have been speaking that even on the Statue of a perfect man and brother Stephen made a statement in this manner he says you're asking God for patience or you know there might be something you have you deal with jealousy or whatever more he said what happens is it isn't God just all of a sudden coming as it was bringing broth that he just deposits something and oh I've gotten more no there's an overcoming so there's opportunities that challenge that is that right so this is why when the statue of a perfect man is adding it means that of an enlargement that of an increasing are you with me that's why this is why the kind of faith that we want to stand with that your that that patience will never be greater than what your faith is virtue will never be greater than what your faith is but see Faith itself because because there must be a pyramid are you with me so it cannot be it's not awkward there is a continual growing and we come into that under the message of the hour that's the entrance into the Capstone and when we've come into the Holy Ghost now we've been birthed and a child grows right so let it be added unto you added so we want to keep on let it be added added because Paul said let yourself let abound in the work of the Lord right let may your love abound one towards another well how can that happen unless there are things that are completely opposite to that that require that not sure nobody in here we're not we're not going to all sign up and say okay can you show me the sign up lifts I want more love because we know in order for that to happen it's going to be more of the opposite coming our way God knows that because we we would take the easy path in the easy way but we are his children and God knows exactly what we have made of once we've done complaining about the bumps and the hiccups and the why did this happening and when we finally get past all are complaining and God said okay okay now are you ready for me to move in your life and give you strength oh yeah Lord are you going to remove this out of my life no I'm going to give you overcoming Grace to grow in that area of your life but if you'll stay in my presence my goodness there is a fountain open in the House of David hallelujah how many know that prayer is important oh brother Branham I'm asking that God would just help me to overcome my temper what did he say sweeten it with prayer sweeten it with prayer that's overcoming that's as tuning of God where we recognize and where our source comes from so I want you to think of how a duck we we all know and I just maybe to reference this first part in this quote of how that a dove itself cannot eat on the carrion that a crow can it can't do it it doesn't have why it doesn't have the gall what's necessary to digest it so it can't it can't do it there's nothing within it that could feed on carrion is that right so notice if then as we look at it brother Brown would go on to say go to the next part sister Brianna a dove is not built like any other bird and that's why God represented himself as a dove descending from Heaven it cannot stand the stink of a carrying it's not a vulture the reason you don't have any goal couldn't digest it he would kill it if it eat it now this is where I want you to notice here a dove never has to take a bath right and Dove's body puts out oil from the inside that keeps it clean so where does its cleansing come from the inside it's a life that's in the Dove it generates in it and oil that keeps the feathers clean and so as a Christian there's a life within them that keeps them clean it's filtered what is it it's an oil within now notice what does that oil do it comes from the inside out why because there are things that can get stuck in the feathers there is a cleansing that's needed when things are in the feathers things upon the Dove and where does its cleansing not from an outside Source but the oil that is within it oh oh my the oil that is within it is where its cleansing comes from that oil emanates from the inside out it's like the woman who had sons that were taken by the Creditor and she asked Elisha she said hey my sons have are going to be taken uh what can I do and Elisha looked and he said you already have oil in your house what you need is empty vessels what was he letting her know your answer is already among you [Applause] but she didn't see it as her answer she didn't see it as the Deliverance but when she got empty vessels the oil that was already among them begin to pour itself out into empty vessels and when the empty vessels were filled it satisfied the debt is that right so there's an oil of the holy spirit that comes from within us and I want to just just picking this in this turn in this manner that it's a cleansing oil of God that rests in the midst of our life that is the power that lays within a believer to release and cleanse every thought that wants to gain a hold in your feathers because if eventually if it starts mounting up it'll weigh you down it'll keep you from flying like you ought to fly but the source of cleansing comes from the inside that's why there must be an inside source and this is why his brother Brown could say it like this so let me just reference this this out of broken cisterns there's a fountain that's open he says there's no other found I know but that Fountain it cleansed me when I was dirty how many witnesses tonight it cleansed me when I was dirty cleansed because I want to live right at it I want to drink this fresh water that fills my soul with joy so in our walk as as Believers there is a continual sanctification by him we're talking about this purifier Romans 6 verse 11. Paul said likewise reckon that means think ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord now these same scriptures that I'm going to read is where a life will pass through even on their Journey to the New Birth these same scriptures apply even after a life has come into the new birth they apply in a continual sanctification of life because once a New Birth has come you don't need a sanctifying of your soul are you with me but it is a need because things sometimes can get stuck in the feathers things can get caught in the feathers ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let me just put in a nutshell remembering Who You Are you are a son and daughter of God beloved now are we so our conduct is Sons and Daughters of God verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust era that word Reign means it's the word uh in the Greek which is basilio which is a is a ruling power you see if something comes in a thought and you don't deal with it eventually that thought it starts moving and working on your emotions and your feelings are you hearing me I don't want no birds I don't want no birds building a nest but the one of the quick signs that you know that they've lit down on a tree with some little twig of a thought is all of a sudden it starts affecting your emotions what do I do wrecking yourselves dead unto sin and Alive unto God I don't want this raining I don't want this controlling I don't want this ruling in my life I want to deal with that here just a little bit don't let it rain in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members now notice who's got the authority here the believer don't yield yourselves members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God I don't want to be yielded to him right I I want him to when it's when it's time I don't want him like the screwdriver or the or the hammer he'll say hey who had the hammer last I want to be right in place I want to be right in place for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but under grace notice verse 15 what shall we say What then shall we sin because we're not under the law but under grace God forbid know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey and whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness now notice now look at that purifying of obedience unto righteousness but God be think that ye were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you so where does obedience take place in the heart first sometimes we're so taken with I don't see this action but it's first got to be here if it's not here so listen when you're praying for any you're praying for a loved one you're praying for another situation pray for the heart pray for the heart God sent a message to deal with the heart when there's problems pray for the heart are you hearing me don't pray for certain actions because maybe God is not going to lead it in that way but you interceding for their heart you're interceding for the real reality of what will bring a change and display in the actions Verse 18 being then made free from sin ye became the Servants of righteousness I'm glad about that I speak after the manner of men because of the strength of your no because of the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanliness and to iniquity unto iniquity look at this even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness for when you were Servants of sin you were free from righteousness and what fruit had you in those things wherever you are now ashamed for the end of those things as death but now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye have your fruit unto Holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord let me just say it in this manner you know brother Branham takes God leads him to speak a message remember when he he led him back and told him to pick up that cigarette pack when he picked it up and said ran fun and surely not he turned around and what did it say uh uh you know a smoking man's fate taste and a thinking man's filter whoo so to think the whole marketability of that particular cigarette company was that by this filter you're not going to get as much nicotine okay so you spoke smoke two twice as many packs to get the same kind of nicotine you wanted in one why instead is instead of smoking one pack now you gotta smoke two packs why because it's not about the filter it's what's on the inside craving that nicotine and so the Holy Spirit would bring that and so take that a thinking man's filter and draw the prophet's attention to it and God here would take a phrase and bring that out to you and I and show you and I there is a provision for a real thinking man for a real thinking woman for one where the spirit of God can deal with our lives and say not just is this world bad but I need God I need a living God in my life I I need a God that'll come and dissolve all unbelief I need a thanking man's filter I need the blood of Jesus Christ because once that Soul has been redeemed once it's been born again there is a thinking man a thanking woman on the inside and it is the filter of the word that's why when a person has been born again in the struggles of the world have ceased in your soul are you hearing me it isn't a struggle to dress right and in the struggle to live right why you've got a different nature on the inside there's a filter that filters out all reasoning filters out all trash and the only thing that can pass through that filter is the word and the spirit because on the other end is a thinking man thinking woman that's drawing upon that word so the prophet would take this even at the end of that message and he would deal with when you come into situations in your life are you using a thinking man's filter when somebody does you bad how do you react are you using a thinking man's filter now let me just say it like this this thinking man's filter is not like the gas mask that the firemen use or some other people we saw use in the past few years they're not like that that isn't something you put on and then you oh we don't handle fire we just take it off and hang it up you need this as a matter of fact as a Believer let me just tell you a real believer you don't take Jesus off and put him on when you've been born again you're a new creation are you hearing me now so it's learning to live by that source of that filter on the inside that everything is to be filtered through that source and it's not about well I have to do it it's about Lord this is your word this is your character this is what your desire that's my desire is to please you and to draw through the filter of God's word in our life I tell you what if we would pass many many of the things right through the filter of God's word I tell you what we wouldn't end up with a lot of other things that we've got to repent over is that right if we just live more by the thinking man's filter what are you saying I'm saying live more by the inside man we are so in touch with outside things that we become out of touch with the God who lives in US he ain't living way out there he's living inside of you that's why when we look at real Fellowship when God told them my house shall be called a House of Prayer you are that House of Prayer you are that house of Fellowship you are the dwelling place of almighty God a place where God can come and unload his heart to his beloved what is it you can only unload your heart when it's a safe place to unload it it's a House of Prayer his people it's a Dwelling Place amen almighty God in Christ Jesus oh blessed be the name of the Lord in the scripture of Matthew 6 verse 9. when the disciples were admonished of how to pray he said after this manner our father would turn in heaven Hollywood be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day Our Daily Bread and forgive us our debts debts as notice that as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen now some months back when I was just looking and studying and many of these things were dropping I just just the thing it just just really Dropped In My Heart on that phrase Deliver Us from Evil just thinking about the manifestation of the sons of God and I just begin to think that phrase the Holy Spirit began to press that upon my heart Deliver Us from Evil now I want you to catch this lead us not into temptation I I don't Lord I I'm not Desiring Tire trials and tests and all that I I'm not because if I were then I would be able I would be saying Lord I'm fit for it but I I he knows what I'm fit for and whatever he makes a room and wait for I guarantee you I don't want to go through it but if he's with me I'll go through it because when I come out on the other side like job said I'm going to come out pure as Glory I know that I don't know how it's all going to work out I don't know all the parts and how everything what all is going to be dissolved but I know when I come out of this I'm going to be pure so job is letting us know that the trials are even as they come away it is a place of even World lives there's a purifying that's going on from his presence oh because let me tell you something when they were walking around in the fiery furnace they weren't down there texting everybody how bad the King was come home they wasn't tweeting out in instagramming or whatever you call it and Facebook and can you believe this rotten guy can you believe him why is he thinking throwing us in here they weren't down there they didn't even have that in their heart if they'd have had anything in their heart like that he'd have never came right but it shows even their approach to the king that they were able to stand there in the presence of the king and without arrogance and say then we've not heard what our God's going to do but we've already reached our decision we don't even got to pray about it we're not going to bow to this because it's wrong what Grace is given I tell you friends that sometimes even when we look at it standing for what's right standing for truth is not easy but if you stand for the truth the truth also has Grace to be released that cleanses you it cleanses you and I want to say Deliver Us from Evil it shows with the from this very phrase why would you need deliverance from it if you haven't been if it isn't around you come on why would we have to even pray this if it's not even around us but you see evil is all around us when I would go to do good evil is present yeah I know sister so no I ain't sister so and so it's this old stinking evil thing and then like brother John LaFontaine Used to Say stinking thinking and if you've got stinking thinking you need checkup from the neck up [Laughter] is that right right now notice it's all around us and Paul deals with this in Galatians 5. it's it's all around us and he did he deals gives us admonition which we've been through that and that evil can come in many forms and ways throughout the day but to deliver us is to free us from the evil laying a hold on my life in other words it might be all around me but I don't zest me I need to affect my thoughts I thought I had my mind I don't want it to affect me to where I become a channel for the evil that's all around me not that I'm going to do the evil I don't want to I don't want to be a channel to where my life becomes showering bitter and exasperating and oh no oh here comes so and so Lord have mercy I'll see you God bless you goodbye no I want my life to be a refreshing I want my life is that what you want I think of one of the greatest testimonies in the book of Philemon one in one of the very first admonitions that Paul makes concerning before Layman himself who was a leader there in the church in colossia he would say by thee brother the Saints are refreshed that's the kind of testimony we want right I don't want a testimony where I exasperate people I want a testimony where there's a refreshing of the spirit of almighty God is that right well how does that happen brother Samuel oh that could be like so-and-so no you cannot put forth the Fountain of Life if you're not living in his presence notice this let's look at this here in teaching on Moses how many know Atari is tar t-a-r I'm not talking southern part I'm talking tar t-a-r like they put on the roads like on blacktop tar like I'm tired no tar you children know what part is when they're fixing the streets oh that awful smell but here's what it does it shuts out all the cracks on the street and that's the way this does it shuts out all water if someone knows aren't this the way this tar does it shuts out all water how many know what the tar was the word the pitch itself was the Holy Ghost the word pitch means atonement that's what prayer does for the believer that's what keeps the world out of you is when you pitch yourself on your knees when you pinch yourself on your knees and say Lord Jesus and the blood comes down and seals you all up so the devil can't get you glory be to God oh that's right oh many times the people go around and say it's awful but I don't make no difference it keeps you safe that's the main thing it keeps you safe you're old-fashioned but it don't matter it keeps you safe what when we pinch ourselves on our knees now you might be standing on your job what's important is is you pitch your heart towards him we pitch our will towards him we're not asking God to come and change it Lord you come according to my will let me just I've already got this printed out how I want you to do it I want you to do it this way and God will say keep your plans because your plans are not my plans your ways are not my ways right but when we're willing to say Lord Jesus let my will be conformed to your will notice the very next scripture here right after that for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you I don't know kind of sounds conditional to me right sounds conditional verse 15. but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses why why would he do that you don't know what they've done to me you don't know this you don't know that it's because we are Sons and Daughters of God and God expects us to act like gods if a dog acts like a dog it's like my wife tells me many times stop it she said they're dogs right some of the rest you got animals and whatever more I know we love them and everything else like that but they're dogs still right they still have the Tendencies of dogs I don't care how many blankets we give them how many nice treats they still will do dog stuff because it's there in their nature is that right and this is where that when we look at it for this notice how this would be placed here for a real god-like expression oh I'm sure all across this building we would raise our hands if God ask us who wants to be more like me what I do Lord I want to and Lord I want to be more like you okay who would like to walk on the water and just be a real display Lord I will sacrifice and I will walk on the water I I will lay my hands I'll surrender to be laid on the sick that they shall recover okay so who also wants to be Godlike in a manner that is so deep because remember many can work miracles but who would want to display the Godlike of forgiveness [Music] oh be careful we're not raising the hands now because if we go to race in that hands he remembers what there's going to be things that will come our way that will require God like forgiveness are you with me oh my notice forgive it means to let go or give up a debt forgive to remit now here's what the word forgive really when we look at it because sometimes we can we can look at the offense we can look at what has taken place I'm talking about a useful life now remaining a channel because we can look at that a lot of the times but remember sometimes the offense itself that is in itself is really what the problem of forgiveness it's what lingers as the result of what was done which to forgive means to stop feeling angry or resentful towards someone for an offense a flaw or mistake how many in here have offended somebody wow only five six eight ten how many have flaws if I could raise my feet I would I've got flaws my wife has to put up with them all the time maybe hers out waiting on but I got flaws right she can spend the month of Sunday's trying to iron all the flaws out of that this is who I am it's not an excuse for things but through those Falls mistakes how many make mistakes yeah sure every one of us and now when I ask you of that with having offenses flaws and mistakes how many want God's forgiveness I know brother Sammy just feels like I'm in elementary school I know I know I know but sometimes participation is good then if we want God's forgiveness now this is what it calls for because for us to be able to forgive others what is greater let me ask you this what's greater the offense what's greater the trespass or a lack of forgiveness you understand as a person can so regard the trespass that they fail to see the lack of forgiveness actually becomes as great or greater than the offense are you with me I'm just going to drag my feet here you see what it does listen to me now what this does you say what's happening here this is the Waters of separation it deals with our life it brings conviction to our life it calms down through our life we want to remain as channels that the Holy Spirit can work through now I want you to think of this forgiveness is a choice I've never as a pastor mandated anybody to forgive somebody else I've admonished them but I realize forgive forgiveness is the condition of the heart it's a choice mama can't make it for you Daddy can't make it for you husband wife nobody it's a choice now here's what I want you to lay on now but forgiveness itself is not something that's cheap we must not make it cheap it must not be something that is just you know because when you think what was it that had to go in on our behalf in order to release us from the hold of sin upon our life and our offenses we were enemies unto God what went into that in order to release us there was a cost is that right it cost almighty God it cost him the life of his only begotten son and you know he was willing to give it in order that not only that we might be forgiven but then through his life coming and lead us to reconciliation with him I want you to think about this right here there's a lot that I could go into but I'm just not going to be able to I know tonight but forgiveness is also something I want to make these points forgiveness is not about whether someone deserves it or not are you hearing me it's not about whether somebody deserves it or not are you with me forgiveness itself is not whether they even asked for it just like sometimes I've had you know individuals that call me up or come to me but so much for me I said listen I forgive you a long time ago I couldn't go on with God not even one moment are you hearing me you can't go on without that I I want to go on with God I want everybody else to be free to go on with God so forgiveness is to be like God it's an act of God that's supernaturally transpires when we surrender our rights of being offended now we can wear our offenses like a badge of Honor I've been offended but what we need is a supernatural we need the in touch with the oil of God on the inside and they say Lord there's some stuff that's got stuck in my mind stuck in my feathers there's some things that I have heard that other people said this and said this I've had things that's got stopped Lord I don't want it stuck I don't want to be stuck because I want to go on with you I don't want to be a Christian that dwells stuck in a rut I want to go on with you Lord are you with me Hey listen friends not one of you every one of you sitting here tonight you can look back at pictures from when you were in kindergarten even five years ago and you see changes in your life you would not expect anybody let's bring in now to the spiritual to hold you back to a spiritual picture of five years ago but sometimes we are guilty of holding one another in spiritual pictures of the past hello well yeah I took out that picture in my wallet well who is that you don't know who that is well that's brother so-and-so that's when they were five years five years old they're 67 years old now and you're still carrying a memory from when they took your marbles on the playground we laugh friends but it's many times these are things that's got stuck in our feathers and the Holy Spirit begins to deal with these things and say hey you want to fly higher you want more of me you want more of my grace in your life you've got to be in tune now with that inner man he purifies himself even as he is pure what is he he's the standard not the church not your brother not your sister he is the living standard of the word that's been raised against the enemy so to be to her forgiveness is to act like God and the impediment is removed that the spirit of God May abide and flow through our lives remember got a kink and a hose sometimes it's a it'd be a long hosing man it's rough because you know the water's turned on you know what's going on what you got to do they'll say hey what's going on you know listen you've been through it enough you know there's a king somewhere and what do you do from where you're at you trace it back to the king right you don't stand out the garden and say hey honey find the kink no the spirit of God leads us to the places where it's kinked why that the channel might flow see that's where Satan he wants to he wants to trap us and I'm closing he wants to trap us we just don't have time he wants to trap us into being selfish sometimes I know we we don't always think of things in these terms sometimes you say what do you mean by being selfish to where that all we can do is ever think about is the wrong that's been done to us feelings that are stirred within us but I want to remind you First Corinthians 13. love seeks not her own love is not about self you might say what are you saying brother Samuel I wasn't here but when I streamed the message and I don't know where I was coming from might have been back in March when I was at brother Homer's and I was coming back I think that's when it was when brother Alexander magulis was here maybe it was in February February and I was coming back home from Brother Ray's and I mean the boys were streaming that service and brother magulis made a statement when he was here and he talked about how that you can take an offense and you can actually make a God out of it it's about three quarters way through the message and the Holy Spirit took him on that and I want to just say in this way if we're not careful you can make a god which is an object of worship out of the offense whereby you worship and everybody that comes into your circle has got to listen to your worship got to listen to the offense some somebody say amen that's on me but friends listen this is true for all of us this is true for all of us this is why we need purifying you see what the enemy's desires to do is to hold you down he wants to weigh you down now listen to me I don't have time to preach on this tonight the word forgiveness and Reconciliation are two different words are you hearing me you forgive but that forgiveness this is why in your heart when you forgive from your heart it looks and Longs for reconciliation God forgives me of my sin right it's already forgiven and I come to that acknowledgment the Holy Spirit keeps working on my heart why did the Holy Spirit correct me why does the Holy Spirit correct me because he likes picking on me Brian I'm going to pick on you I'd like to pick on you no so what is correction if I have to correct Paul what is the what is correction is correction about destroying him no it's correcting what's wrong why does the Holy Spirit come and bring conviction our life to correct what is wrong but he can it will only become corrected when we receive the grace that has brought that correction then our what happens where does that correction start it starts in our heart to say you be it unto me Lord forgive me see that correction within begins to Humble itself what is that it's moving in forgiveness then the same holy spirit that brought that conviction is the same holy spirit that guides and leads through all the proper channels to reconciliation right what's reconciliation back in harmony aren't you glad God is a faithful father he comes to lead us and he comes to guide us and I I don't believe anybody here tonight I don't I just sorry friends I don't believe that any heart even a person that look I know we may have lives and hearts I'm sure you can see lives and hearts and even sometimes when you see lives and maybe hearts and lives that maybe would even come and they Fellowship here are still living in the same address that you and I once lived in where Peter told or Paul told Titus we once lived in hatred we lived in those things but we don't live there no more we don't live there no more what do I do don't despise that person who's there but pray for their heart that God will move upon their heart that they can see that same Liberty and come to that same cleansing within that'll release them and give them a strength to overcome every complex a strength to overcome all of the isms of the world in this life because I don't believe that anyone wants to worship around an offense there's no edification in that is that right so let me just close with this good old General Lee now these men even brother Brown would talk about Stonewall Jackson even when you really read I'm not talking about NR I just say it the history books and stuff that's out now it's just like when I taught history and things in school when they wanted to me to teach certain things on Black History Month I'm on a pool from where I went to Africa and I'm going to teach it the real way I'm going to teach things for how it really was I don't want to know all of these channels of how things were and whatever but sometimes we have things that where it's been kind of you know distorted and I I just say that because these were men as brother Branham would call it these when you really read about these men these were men of character and generally the one of the advice that he he gave there was a woman she was in Kentucky and uh it was a beautiful tree that was in her yard and this tree had been all shot to pieces I mean the the bark was off the trunk limbs were blown off of it so General Robert E Lee had went there and she got Robert E Lee and she said General come here she said I want you to look at what they what these federal troops did to this tree they blew all these holes in it and now this is years after she's still living with what had been done and here's the great words that General Lee gave her when he looked at her he said ma'am cut it down and burn it in other words quit living in the past oh if you're hurt no not big brown words but you know what there's some trees we need to cut down and just what burn it amen not a man-made fire but let the fire of God come down amen let's cut it down instead of living but you say we'll do the same though what's wrong with that because you realize friends sometimes with things that you can keep in your life that can actually keep God at Bay I want to be close to him I want to draw closer and how do I draw closer when there's something that stands out that he'll deal with my heart and I can see it I want to act like God I want I may not be able to break bread off and bread come on and I may not be able to take just a little bit of fishes and break it off and more fish come I may not that may not be what I'm called to do but I am called like everybody else to forgive I am called because I'm part of the I've received the pass over so I've got the strength to give a pass to give a Passover purifyeth ourselves even as he is pure don't you love him tonight that's powerheads I Hallelujah Lord Jesus oh God as we look Lord into your word and more than just a page more than a letter it's beholding your character beholding your image Lord father I pray tonight God that Lord as you had just been sweeping through the building sweeping through each of our hearts I pray Heavenly Father tonight Lord as we Lord God would desire that you would just pass Lord very just closely O Lord may we lord God it's not something that we can try to do from the outside but may we lord live from that of the inside that purifying by the Pure Source oh Lord Jesus there's no words Lord sometimes we look for words that would somehow dispel that dear God at it's getting in your presence Lord It's just Lord and that first of all that starts just even in these moments Lord as your word is coming I don't want to draw back I want to move forward Lord that's you lord it's drawing me it's drawing us into that place Lord I don't believe there's any heart here tonight that would want to distance themselves from you Lord I'll just I'll just say that Lord tonight I don't believe that Lord Hearts would come here with the desire to get further from you but I believe God that every desire is to say Lord I want to draw nine to you Lord that my thoughts if they're contrary to your thoughts Lord then oh God we dismiss them Lord by the grace of almighty God let me Lord think like you Lord help us the Lord as a people oh God how that sometimes the Lord with even past offenses if we're not careful it can actually become what hinders us Lord from even opening and accepting other friendships that you want to send our way oh help us Lord your God in our hearts Lord as as people because we still have feelings Lord when the Holy Ghost has come we don't do away with our feelings but God help us Lord It's a natural tendency sometimes in our lives to draw back when we've been hurt Lord but I don't want to live by the natural tendency of a natural man when Lord I believe with all my heart I have a supernatural birth let me Lord God in everything Lord I may never walk on the water Lord God I may not Lord God be used in certain ways that's okay but oh God may I Lord from every from the very depths of my heart forgive and live a life Lord that oh God to where that oil of God on the inside we just cleanse Lord anything that would want to get caught in our feathers Lord we want to fly we want to move in the liberty of the Holy Spirit and Lord how the enemy Will Spring it's true he Springs traps on us but father it's in these moments Lord that when you come and not only will you make yourself known but it's also a moment that we might grow to be more like you and like job had said when I come out of this it's going to be less of Samuel and more of God Lord Jesus you know the process the refining process Lord that we must go through and it's true Lord it isn't always in forgiveness this is just Lord a part of it but I think in order Lord just for us to operate as a local body even within our homes in our marriages in relationships oh God this is an absolute necessity may we live close Lord and in your presence to where it is recorded of your character and your nature thou art a god who is ready to forgive plenteous in Mercy that's where I want to live Lord if that's the address the Lord to be found that's where I want to be found We Can't Stop Lord the things from coming out I'm trying to stop this from happening I'm stopping Lord God we can try to stop so many things that we end up living in a little bubble house love itself is a risk but it's a risk worth taking relationships Lord all throughout this building we've all been hurt in one way or another something Lord has been said maybe this has been done oh God help us Lord to realize help us Lord I pray oh God Lord my hands are Up My Heart Lord God before you Lord I don't want anything Lord to stick if there's anything in Lord in my heart if there be anything Lord in the heart of anyone anybody want to join me if there's anything Lord Lord God would you make it known Lord I don't want anything Lord God to hold me back I don't want anything Lord that God that would Kink up the hose stop the channel I wanted to be a place where you can come like it says in the Song of Solomon where you can put your head in my lap oh God a place where you can find rest a place where there's a peace oh Lord that you can come into your garden lord it's a place of Solace a place of rest a place of delight a place that is secluded and shut out from the rest of the world what a paradox Lord we see it in this life this world that we're living in hatred is such a common place Lord oh God but in the midst of it all how could we stand if it wasn't for you Lord but God it's what you've done within us lord it's your work the love of God that is shed abroad in our hearts and Lord we want to live from that source of life that purifying I want to be in contact and I want to live from the source of life that Lord is placed Within Me because that's the Shekinah that's that light Lord that keeps and watches over our life that the word itself never corrupts never grows moldy but it stays fresh help us Lord that our lives might always remain fresh it's a battle Lord it will be a battle there will be many things Lord even now that we have to pray through but it's worth it Lord help us Lord I pray oh God May every bit of our worship go to you if there's any Idol in our life God of an offense and this did me wrong and so and so did me wrong and this happened and this Lord even if it's an idol of Mama and Daddy of what Daddy did or an uncle did or an aunt did oh God may we recognize that there is a cleansing Lord Jesus to relieve us from that Idol that would produce nothing but bitterness and resentment oh granted Lord tonight may we lord as we stand and have stood in the washing of Water by the word granted tonight Lord I pray may you grant Lord to every heart Lord what's needed tonight Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen don't you love him amen if you'd like to stand you know it's a Moment Like This I don't know about you but you know even as you look at things and praying about it and pray about it much before you bring it there's just something about it that you just it's so wonderful when you really can just let go and let God just scour it all out it's just there's a refreshing that comes from that it's refreshing that the world wouldn't understand you know the things friends is the world can argue they can they can hold on to their offenses people can hold on to offenses but I'll just say it like this you'll never get any further with God when God brings that to light you'll never get any further you've got to relinquish that why for if you forgive not others of their trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive you of your trespasses I want to live in Liberty don't you I want to walk in Liberty I want to I want to live in that place where brother Romans he talks about in perfect faith living in that channel for that Faith to drop in this is the very text that he reads out of my brother bran will take a time in perfect faith and he'll deal with that faith is based on forgiveness I believe that's what we're called to do I believe it's easy no I'm just from experience is it like the switch on that wall over there I wish it was I wish it was I'm just going to be honest it isn't just something I just say hey but it's right here it's right here this is where it has to be dealt with and I have to invite him and hope first of all I've got to get in his presence then realize that I've got need of him what I need you to cleanse the hurt I need you to cleanse the offense because it's it's real when I say it's real we don't want to make a God out of it I want to say Lord take every Idol out take it all out because I want it to be a place that you can put your head where you can rest you know what's wonderful is when he deals with our lives like this you know what he's saying put your hand in mind I'm here with you you're not alone I'm right here with you we're
