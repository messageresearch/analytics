through the words of the song just speak Lord to our hearts we love you Lord Jesus there's no one like you Lord we appreciate you Father give ourselves to you down the name of Jesus Christ a God bless you tonight if you turn with me to Ephesians 4 I just want to read a few scriptures from there and get right into thought tonight I want to say it's good to have each and every one of you here in the house of the Lord tonight and so glad to have my uncle Glen and my aunt Barbara here with us and it just means it means a lot and Glen administered the gospel and we just so appreciate them amen and their love for the Lord we just we just want to look to the Lord tonight and ask that God would just speak to us tonight we need to hear from him we need to hear from him verse 7 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men that's what I want you to notice here what's the purpose of these gifts now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things that's to feel complete satisfy performed all things verse 11 and he gave some apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers may God bless his word bless the reading of it as you're being seated so these gifts as we're looking at this here tonight as we've been looking at that the gifts of the mighty Conqueror we know that each one of these gifts as well as each and every life that God would Tabernacle himself in is a witness and is to be a witness of the Living God and God would use man he would take that of man and God would so through the gifts that God would place within a life and we understand that those gifts are not things that men would themselves a sin to it's very much like what it was in the time I think it's in second chronicles where it speaks where the presence of God came down in the temple and when Solomon had dedicated it there were men that stood by to wait to see what God would appoint for them to do it's not something that we choose as a matter of fact every one of these gifts were looking at as we started last week to look at that of apostle it's not something that someone starts out that it's something that they want to do but it's rather it's a burden that God would place on that heart and God would so fit even the very nature and the makeup of that man that it would work complementary even to the gift that God has placed in his life and to remember that when we look here in this in this of the gifts we know that these gifts are to proclaim if you think about when Elijah himself when he was moved upon when Elijah put the mantle upon him and he begins to follow Elijah he makes one request and his request is that a double portion of that spirit would come upon me and you remember the statement that Elijah made and all of this in a type here where he made the statement that if thou seus me when I go then you shall have the request that has been upon your heart it was God who put that burden in Elijah's heart to ask for that double portion we know that whereas I believe it was Elijah with four miracles and we see Elijah with eight miracles it was God even testifying in that working of what he would do in his own mystical body after that he would raise from the grave and he would ascend on hind sent back the Holy Ghost there was a need that they'd that the disciples themselves would witness the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ they would be dialed into that because the Holy Ghost was talent was tied in to that reality of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and so when we look at this of the Apostles it was of where this word that we we see here as we were looking at it last week it is a word the word apostle is a word that many times is used interchangeably with missionary one who is sent and when we look at this we recognize that when Paul would even write of this and pulling it out of inspiration from the Book of Isaiah that that that how beautiful are the feet of them that that publish the gospel of peace and it would speak that they would be sent to proclaim the name of the Lord now to think of this that there that the people themselves might call upon the name of the Lord he would speak of the redemptive work of Almighty God it's in other words it's to ask for what has been revealed and who God has declared himself to be how could you know what is available to you unless it is proclaimed to you and once it's proclaimed to you then you can ask for what is spoken directly to you and so this is why Paul would pick that up in Romans 10 how shall they preach except they be sent now we realize it's not men sending men because that'll never work but it's got to be God God called man it's God sending men as Plato Peter would say to preach this gospel with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven it's not enough for the words of man we cannot we can reason with people we can try to exhort him and dispute about scripture but that brings the conversion it can be things that might open people's minds but that is not what the Lord Jesus even meant when he spoke this in the word in Matthew 28:18 let's look here he says Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth he's declaring himself I'm the mighty Conqueror go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you all the way even to the end of the world amen now we recognize as Bible readers that this that the happenings even in the scripture and even what God would be doing present even within our lives we must be able to find his working in our lives within the scripture if it's God working in our lives it must be him working all the way through in our life that places us in the scripture now think about it here is the greatest Wow if we could say it like this the greatest newsflash that's ever struck the face of the earth is when he rose on that Easter morning and when he would announce to them and he would reveal to them that I am deed am Alive I'm he who was dead but now I am Alive for evermore they would they were going from a situation where they were discouraged they were disheartened but notice how the revealed word of the hour reached out to them it didn't appear to calluses it didn't appear to any of the unbelievers or the make believers it only appeared to those as Peter would say those who were chosen of God to witness this and how that he made himself known to them and told them go wait until you are endued with power from on high it was not enough that they would have a knowledge of personal acquaintance if that was not a to hold them they themselves had to become United with that same God who had come down from glory and had fulfilled the promises of His Word and now we make way for the Holy Ghost to come upon the lives of the believer where by putting God back in some of his people amen the same God who walked with them in the beginning now that same God through the appropriate appropriation of his son now the blood and made a way for him to come back down and live inside of his children this was the ant attack the fulfillment of the type of the Jubilee the Jubilee sound remember Jesus said I'm come to preach the acceptable year now remember here in the Ministry of the Lord Jesus the Son of Man the sick were healed demons were cast out lives were set free that was the Ministry of the son of man announcing the Jubilee is getting ready to strike that word already was there in power it was representing in a life glory be to God it was represented in the life of the Lord Jesus as a witness and a type of what you have seen it do in the groom it will do the same thing in the bride because it will be that same original life come back in Bride form and that's just what happened on the day of Pentecost we're talking about an acceptable year we're talking about the Jubilee that of the Jubilee when it would sound it was once every 50 years he did not matter what anybody that had come into they sold themselves into slavery maybe they couldn't pay a debt but you remember the land God told him the land is not yours to sell you might come into a debt but that land still belongs to you because God said the land belongs to me I'm the one who has given you that land but when the time would come for the Jubilee and the sounding of that Jubilee that trumpet itself was the sounding of authority because the atonement had been offered up that had been accepted in the Lamb that lamb had been offered up the blood had been shed now the sounding was a sounding for what others could not see was taking place and the blood was accepted the gospel the sounding out was to let him know that has been accepted and they can take their Liberty when they heard the sounding of the trumpet that's what God when he would send out the apostles and a gret it registers through every heart it should register in every life there should be a proclaiming of Liberty I once was bound but now I'm free hey man I've been made free by the power of Almighty God I've been loosed from Satan's hold upon my life you can return back to your original inheritance no questions asked you don't have to ask nobody the hearing of that trumpet gives you the authority to throw down that tool that Powe whatever it is that's in your head you can throw it down did not have to be pried out of your hands you can throw it down and return to what rightfully belongs to you you see it's calling you to what belongs to you now when we look at this here on the day of Pentecost this is where Jesus told him I want you to go hide this is where I want you to go to Jerusalem and I want you to wait to you endued with power from on high let's look at the spokesman here Peter one on one of the one of the Twelve Apostles the Bible says in acts 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come this was not a type now this was the fulfillment what all the type had been about year after year of keeping the Pentecost now it was indeed the fulfillment they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it's set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance I want you to look how God's perfect timing not only everything had lined up exactly with that of the feast the Feast of the Lord how God had so lined that up but to think that there the Bible were going to say there were devout Jews from all these other nations around the mouth were gathered there at this time it was a very significant important feast and they were there at this time now here's what's taking place when they begin to hear this the Bible would go on to talk about how that they were hearing what was being spoken now this is this is the whole part the miracle was not in the speaking they were speaking like I am speaking now but then what it was was the miracle that was the hearing that was going on in the ears is that right the Bible would say behold our nothing's all which speak their galilaeans but God the Spirit of God was present and interpreting the work of God in their own native language it wasn't an unknown tongue it was a no tongue amen God's got to get a message out so people's gotta understand it Amen God was also giving a clear witness that this gospel it's gonna go to every nation verse 11 says the crease to hear that says we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and were in doubt and sang one to another what meaneth is others were mocking saying these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the eleven notice Peter stands up with the eleven here hears here is the spokesman on the day of Pentecost here is a servant an apostle of God amen he knows his position the Holy Spirit has made him aware of his position notice the Spirit of God has the Lord Jesus would let him know what's your strength and then you strengthen your brethren he knew what God had called him to do he stands up with the eleven here here's an apostle and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day hallelujah he knows what has happened in his life he is died he is identifying what is taking place Hisle is the word happening in my life oh I can't help but drift back to whom God had got ahold of my life in the work that God has done in my life others one they don't know what to expect they don't even know how to describe it oh he got sent off to a church camp he got brainwashed his mom and daddy took ahold of it or this and that these are the statements but all my brother and sister when you meet God on those sacred sand it ain't nothing you're trying to keep but you've met Almighty God who keeps every promise and he himself who made the promise he comes to make that promise of living reality they met in lifts you both sin changes that old nature oh my I'm trying my best not to preach but this is that notice what Peter this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel notice an apostle he's taken him right into the word this is the boldness of the land of the tribe of Judah that's crying out he identifies I don't know if I had time to read it but Peter here he is identifying the promise that they're witnessing they don't know what what meaneth this but Peter is going to identify the promise he reaches and pulls out the promise of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost he pulls the promise there of what David had spoke concerning the Messiah and in verse 22 he says he men of Israel hear these words is not is not it not an option hear these words you need to hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain my goodness it had to be the boldness of the Lion of the tribe of Judah to stand right there and express these things is that right whom God hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it for David spoke concerning him I foresaw the Lord always before my faith for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption Val has made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with that countenance you see what the Spirit of God is doing this is not Peter trying to find things that will that will identify the happening but the Spirit of God has quickened the promises to him that belong to him they are glowing up there listen now they went up there in the upper room not with wondering what's going to happen but there was a clarity the word had given them leadership for what was coming and what they were to expect God has given us clear leadership he's honed and rannian in this hour for what you and I are to expect hallelujah amen any moment and that twinkling of an eye we shall be changed they met God provides leadership from one feast to another he provides leadership for his children to be home in with a true expectation this is a word but the Spirit of God is quickening notice what David was uttering by the Spirit of God of what shall be now the same spirit that moved through David is declaring through Peter what was a future event is Matt made clear by prophecy amen thou has made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with that countenance his presence his face his person rather and let me freely speak unto you the patriarch David that he's both dead and buried and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God has sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus met his hazard in this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all our witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost he had shed forth this which ye now see in here he's declaring what you're seeing and what you're hearing is the Holy Ghost this is the promise this is that which was well now it's made flesh Oh glory it wasn't Peter just expressing this but the Holy Ghost was there to back it up for David oh these are powerful scriptures for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith of himself the Lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until I make back foes by foot store therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ and what you think of this here here when he has it's identified he is seated in power the promises that now have been made now there is a body on the throne not a sea off any body but now that same body that God created and came down here and lived in and did the redemptive work he raised up that same body and it seated at the right hand not the right hand but in the throne see that in power him at all power is given unto me hey man is seated in authority and that authority is that now which is ministered to the sons and daughters of God as the Liberty to proclaim you are free oh god help me tonight this supernatural manifestation it was lifting up when the Bible says there that there were many that heard and how that when they were coming out of their the upper room staggering and everybody found they thought they were drunk now once you watch the supernatural working was taking place what the people were hearing was the wonderful works of God everybody that came out of there listen to me everybody that came out of there they had they were sharing in this same testimony that Peter was a spokesman of they were representative of the message that was being proclaimed Amen they had met that same God and it was the wonderful works of God that was being proclaimed now the think of this this it would declare the manifestation of God's promise in this hour that he's now seated in power just as he rose from the grave it was a message to let them know just as he arose and he is overthrown death and sin has been conquered that message would go that to the children to let them know that it is your turn it is now for you to be raised in power it is time for you to be raised in power over sin over unbelief over death over fear over skepticism it's time to be raised what by that same power that raised up Christ from the dead you see you got to know what's available to you before you can ever ask you know what Peter was preaching to him he was preaching the coming of the Lord now I wasn't preaching just the coming of the Lord back and putting it back on Calvary or putting it in the tomb now that wasn't that one that done you well well enough he was preaching the coming of the Lord that that same God who came from glory who walked in flesh among us who rose from the grave that the Holy Ghost is the same God now living inside of his people he was preaching the coming of the Lord by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see the Apostles understood that there must be a coming of the Holy Ghost in you in order for you to be ready for the literal physical corporal coming of the Lord Laure meter god oh my so now he's declaring this resurrection you're a beneficiary of it verse 37 said when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and they said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do this is key now remember the acceptable year in order to come back to the inheritance key has got to be term just right are you with me now you see the path back it must be a word path back the only way to get back to then inheritance it's got to be the path of the word is that right so this path of the word and man may have been revealed to them quicken to them they were partakers of that but now through this revealed word what's how what what exactly that they're going to express repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins what was it the revelation of the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost those are titles it was the name the name was revealed it was that name they meant Jesus as that of a human made God came down in Redemption to redeem us back to himself that is our sacrifice our Passover lamb and Peter having the keys opening it to the Jews repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he goes on to say for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call he is a very important work as an apostle if he don't set it right it's going to mess everything up you mean God wouldn't trust his word to men God and trust his word to himself that's why I said wait until you endued with power from on high because it would be God now in the feet of his children carrying his word that's why the Bible said in Isaiah 52 how beautiful are the feet of him that terror is its Christ dressed up in his church Alleluia you got us started right if you don't start it right you know air out when it gets way on down the road every word matters is that right that's why one of the Apostles written by wrote my inspiration would say whosoever hadith the word or taketh away a word his pot will be taken away out of the book of life so when you see here then as the Bible goes on to say and many other words verse 40 did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls the Holy Ghost flowed through the word and pricked the heart did it break the heart everybody know though there are those who mocked it enough it didn't affect him unless they got turned around the word was preached he didn't mean everybody heard it but those who heard it it was something that took place inside of their life while the word was being preached it was a yielding and an open you see before God can ever do anything for a heart that heart first of all has to be opened it has to be turned to him now when he noticed this this same message as you as Bible readers would see talking about the Apostles and Alan sent sent to carry this message as Jesus said go you therefore into all the world this was the same message that they preached when the angel of the Lord came and set him free after the Sadducees threw him into prison I want you to notice what the religious did in that day there was nobody more religious than the Pharisees and Sadducees but in the Bible it speaks openly how that they themselves even begin to persecute that work and even witnessing the Living God moving would tell them they would beat him and they were telling don't you go out of here anymore teaching in this name they couldn't deny it they could not deny the working it was the same message the same message that Steven preached same message when there were men the Bible says suborned men who were stirred up by others and paid off go strut trouble against even men in that measure it was Philip who preached in Samaria and Peter came behind and lay hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost this it was the same Philip who preached to the Ethiopian eunuch these funds are making mention here is because these men had been in the same Upper Room they had the same experience they came for preaching the same message they had met the same Jesus they knew him to be the same and what they preached was bad a divinely revealed experience in their life here come the keys Peter here there's been an unlocking an unlocking of the Jews unlock into the Jumeirah to remember the three races of people and Sam and Jeff as people Jews Samaritans Gentiles now here it comes in acts 10 notice here is the house of Cornelius Cornelius is a devout man he's by the way the Scriptures as it would put in verse 22 he's one that feared God and of a good rapport among all the nations of the Jews was warned from God ban Holy Angel to sin for thee into his house and to hear words of V then the angel know the words shredding angel knew all about it he knew but you see God had not called angels to carry his word God has called man to carry the word that man would be a yielded vessel unto Him is that right not to think of this how that we recognize within it that when we see Cornelius Cornelius is how he has the scriptures he has the prophecies matter of fact everything that Peter is going to come down there and preach these are not things that he doesn't already know by scripture but the difference is is how that God would place it and say tell through an angel he said I want you to send up to Joppa I want you to send for one whose name is Simon and imitating his surname his surname is Peter what God was doing there he was also dealing on Peters in God knew in order to get Peter yielded has a vessel although the gift of an apostle was in his life but he had to get him yielded to take this message to the Gentiles of Cornelius house because remember when he saw all of those beasts he said they're unclean and what did God say because of the old sufficient work of Calvary don't you call that unclean which may cleave what's he doing he's giving him the authority to stand on that world and to proclaim that though you are unclean in your life but there is a cleansing you were mention and made known of in Calvary he came bearing a word of authority for their life the Bible says in verse 44 while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word while they heard the word the Holy Ghost came down fill them right there while they heard the word the Holy Ghost filled you see it's God you can't control how God's going to do it you can't even limit God to an altar to a Pew to a church service you can't limit God truly a heart that gets to hungered for God they need trying to put God in the box because they already know he's above all things he's a cloud of his word the same God that met buddy Robinson in the field saying God met the Prophet in the cave he's the same God that'll meet you when you meet him on the conditions of the way he'll come to your eyes hair brother you know what this ministry of apostles it lets the children of God know there is an authority all you have to do is say I accept it I receive what belongs to me and we see they were they went on and they were baptized in the name of the Lord I often believe with all my heart now this isn't this is this is just this is brother Sam you know I don't preach brother Samuel but you look at how God did it here God by his Spirit made a declaration to them and how that he came upon them and the living reality the same way it fell on them at the beginning nobody could deny him entry you know why God had brought him in it 1 Peter that brought the Jews in in the beginning it was God who brought him in by a promise the Gentiles were included in this promise then the Bible says can any man forbid water then they were baptized in the name of the Lord so was the opening of the way of the veil of the flesh it was a way of Liberty that had been proclaimed I tell you anytime we see just right here in this description anytime that the original message is preached where the same original life it'll bring the same results what are those results it brings the word flesh in the body of believers it brings Christ preeminent in the believer not ideas of man not the thoughts and creeds and um but it brings Christ present and when Christ comes president brother he will calls if there's any thought that's out alive if there's anything that's wrong he himself because the love in the heart for the believer for Christ for the word they will relinquish anything that they see is contrary to the word and the stand upon that word you see they were running with the Kings message but they could preach that they were running with the Kings message when they came out of the upper room they got the scepter of the King in their hand they meant like Esther when hear Haman was after the scepter had been extended it was the scepter of righteousness Amen the devils were shaken come on now a man when the healings and the signs and wonders begin to take place the devil started getting nervous now I want to just deal with this part of it in in that of the Apostles the supernatural being done it's just the same way it was in the Ministry of the Lord Jesus the Bible would say his fame went throughout all the regions it was a supernatural accompaniment of that had drawn the people to hear what they needed to hear the supernatural is only a sign that's trying to point the people to the Living God as among us are you with me God still uses the supernatural working so matter of fact the word alone is not enough it takes the supernatural God God proves himself alive today the very last verses in Matt mark 16 verse 19 so then after the Lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following sometimes the signs they'll come out right then in there as the word has preached and then there's other times the signs will follow after the word has already found its place here with me every generation this is laugh but the man would make this this declaration here every generation must have a chance at the fresh word of God it can't be a hand-me-down I can't hand anything down to my children it ain't enough that they're in this church they've gotta have their own personal experience with the same God it's the same way for everybody in the search it ain't enough just come into this church because my momma come to the church my daddy come to this church God don't have grandchildren he has sons and daughters that he himself that's by his Spirit through his word the program of God will not be defeated I mean just an asset to hell it will not be defeated he will feel all things he will complete and accomplish and perform his word to each generation it's just like when a priest one who would become of an age in Israel to enter into the priesthood they themselves has entering into the priesthood they would have that privilege to eat some of the same original manna that fell on that first day that matter itself is life it's the bread of life Jesus said I am that bread of life he that eats of me though he were dead yet shall he live it's speaking of that stuff of life that of his own life it's the privilege of every believer to eat that same original manner that same original life oh brother hey man God seen God already seen all the way down remember even Paul when Paul would gather you know the the the bishops overseers he would gather them at Ephesus and he let him know they're going to be grievious wolves there will be men rise up from among you speaking perverse things but he said I commend you to the word of grace which is able to build you up Paul was recognizing one thing though the rest of the church and they did not know that there would be how many ages how long but to thank God himself would preserve this original outpouring God knew that the church themselves they would after that of Pentecost and entering into that Ephesian age 33 years later he knew that they themselves they would start to go in an organizational form but God made a promise that for every age that there would be that of a representation one who would be sent that's one of the seven stars in the right hand of God they would have the power of Jesus Christ behind them they will have that same original power that of the same Godhead they would stand upon that word and proclaim that there is the same original manner God knew the church would drift off into forms they were drift off in the programs they were drift away from the original life but God himself remember he is Jehovah Jireh he has not entrusted his program to no man but God Himself has come down to fulfill and to complete this work he knew he's fulfilling what he spoke to Zachariah and he showed Zachariah the seven golden candlesticks and he showed of what is this I don't know what is it not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord this mountain shall be removed so that God would be fulfilling his word in every age they have a fresh chance at the Word of God sure there'd be things that were lost water baptism many different doctrines were lost but God said I will restore now I want you to catch this part here because the Bible goes on with that of the supernatural there's so many accounts I'm just not gonna read them all but I want you to catch a few things here and that's five verse twelve and by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and of the rest there's no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them and believers the more were added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women in so much that they brought forth the sickened to the streets laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by my over shadows some of them there came also a multitude out of the cities round about Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one sans and wonders have been a part of the gospel since the inception they will be apart and are a part of the Church of the Living God anybody said we don't need the supernatural they've just put God out I look at what the preacher when you say you don't need the supernatural we need the supernatural we need to live in God coming down here brother it's more than just word wrath Paul would say our gospel came not in word only but it came in power and demonstration and much assurance it changed your life that's the promise of the word go you there for teaching all nations not lecturing them but preaching the gospel demonstrating the power of the Holy Ghost how can man do that man can't it's God accompanying his people you know what it is they were so one with God they didn't try to figure out how the word was gonna work they just knew it were they preach the word stood for the word and God came behind God brought the conviction God brought the healing God brought the deliverance God brought the feeling they had sense confidence of God backing them up but that word that they were speaking they were not taking any thought what they should say but they were yielded as vessels as mouthpiece unto God and the word was having the ride away these are apostles of God hallelujah you see God uses the supernatural as we've seen there in the book in the first part of the book of Acts you see it all through the Ministry of the Lord Jesus there never you don't find anywhere you read the Old Testament you never find such demonic manifestation as when the Ministry of the Son of Man is on earth you never find it but the Ministry of the son of man God come down and take upon a body of flesh devils start trembling Devils start crying out we've never been such a such a manifestation I tell ya for myself personally never seen so much I've been over the past few years youthful meeting after youth meeting after youthful meeting not just one or two multiple ones but in every one God has gotten a victory I said God has gone the victory where lives have been held held in bondage but yet God has come down by a word of authority that he has given us in this end time or glory be to God think of this Paul here he was the Bible and you see these things in the scripture here is Paul an apostle in her acts nineteen eight he went into the synagogue and he spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God but when divers were hardened and believe not but speak evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one fairness and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and Greeks and God rocked special miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchief aprons and diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them it was not a show signs and wonders as it accompanies the believers you find in the Ministry of the Apostles because here God would come special miracles a person could pray and pray and pray it ain't about how much you pray whether or not you do a miracle God is the one who uses you and they just say it has the scriptures we read there and that's five in other places God did did miracles by the hands of the Apostles it was God doing the work God in the body event if you're in the body then it's God working through the body and you're a part of the body now let me just try to take a little bit of a turn of a direction in Titus one one here is here is Paul and he is speaking to Titus now and notice I want you to notice these first words maja we could just preach on these for a while Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness is very important he's a servant of God first then he's an apostle because in order to be a real apostle of God is got to be a real servant of God in order to be a real servant of God it takes a heart that's been humbled in his presence so so much that God Himself will come down and move into that life and that life wants only one desire and that's to serve the will of God the purpose of God that's how it is in every believers life isn't it it's first of all to be a servant to serve Him now Paul goes on in writes let me just kind of skip here in verse 4 to Titus my known son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior for this cause left IV in Crete that thou should have sent in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as I had appointed thee so the representation we see the Apostles one who is sent taking a message sent from God now we find this with the Apostles that it's also those as brother Branham would put it in the message we find he said the Apostle is a special man he's a setter in order he's a man that sent from God to set the things in order you know order is a big thing to God the tabernacle had to be order in it you couldn't just put the furniture anywhere you wanted to put it you couldn't just do anything any way that you wanted to do it there is an order and you see when things are done in the right order it invites God is that right it invites God in the same way you know it's like when I walk in my house tonight you know trusting by the grace of God I'm gonna find it as I left it but if I wouldn't find that as I left it I ain't gonna walk into that house the same way I walk in there you know what's wrong here what's going on in here so you see it's got to be a house that said in order that'll welcome him it'll welcome him the same way let me just put it this simple so even if Peter were to walk through these doors tonight Peter could come here and said and say I feel at home brother Brandon could come in here and sit down he'd say I feel at home tonight Paul could come and sit out feel at home tonight now this is very important because God's presence comes when things are said in order this is why the scripture said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's an order this is why there's an order then why even that as we come in we enter reverently into the house of God then even death with the singing in the music is to invite his presence every time before the word goes forth there what is it it's the music that goes ahead that prepares for the word to come there's an order God sees order that's very important now God is not one with the order it's an order by his word God is not one who sets order without divine love placing it God has he sets the order it's just like when you know Paul when there was that I witness of what was going on in the Church of Corinth and here they were coming in and taking communion and you know the story most of you they come in there and they're taking communion but they're coming and they're eaten they're not just taking a piece of the bread they're not just taking a drink of the wine but they're coming and eating and drinking just like they would during their pagan fest think of it and Paul lets him know he straightens it out you got houses to eat in Paul's an apostle he's setting him in order they got out of order he's setting it in order he's putting it in order why if you don't get it an honor he won't come to it you see this is where Elijah in order for the fire to fall he had to get the stones in order had to put the wood in order had to get the sacrifice in order oh how glorious it shows when a life is yielded and it's put in order by God the fire comes it'll come in a home it'll come in a life by the order of the world that's why the church has had to be put back in order by the Word of God in this generation for a rapture I've had to be put back upon Jesus now I want you to think of this here my this just keeps on unraveling acts 2:42 this is the testimony and they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers where did the Apostles get their doctrine from the Apostle and prepend and him who is the chief of our faith the Lord Jesus Christ and he he was not these are not just things that were just coming up it was reached back from the old it was brought into the new this was not their thoughts that they went forward with it was the Apostles doctrine what they taught on water baptism they they taught on the Holy Ghost come on when they talked then it wasn't enough just to believe on you got it you've got to be born again are you with me they thought that you were chosen in Christ before the foundation world these are all part of the Apostles doctrine I want you to watch how this will how this would operate in acts 11:19 just give me just a few more moments is that okay now the Bible says in acts 11:19 when they were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen it traveled as far as Venus and Cyprus and Antioch preaching the word to none but only but unto the Jews only and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the Grecians preaching the lord jesus and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch now these were converts that had already been warned but now news gets back to the church back in Jerusalem and they send out Barnabas this is why the Bible says no them that labor among you God uses every one of those men and those ministerial gifts and they all have a purpose so here is here is Barnabas he sent to the to the churches now notice who when he came had seen the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that the purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord for he was a good man full of the Holy Ghost and a faith and much people was added unto the Lord then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for two seeks on Barnabas comes exhort some encourages them there being further established and then God moves upon his heart gets all up here gets all up here now you know Saul remember when Judas had went his way Judas was an apostle but he went his way right and before the Holy Ghost come you know they're never gonna choose somebody to fill in so they chose my thighs you don't ever read anything really about Matthias that God already had the one chosen honey with me God already knew where he was at I'm sure if he too made mention at that time and nobody would have believed it it just shows how God users want everybody else ain't no way and God took Paul to minister to us as Gentiles my God has a sense of humor and when he had found him he brought him unto Antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch order is important Paul would let him know you are a habitation of God by the spirit that is built upon the apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone John an apostle was caught by the Spirit of God who was there on the Isle of Patmos he sees in Revelations 21 that heavenly Jerusalem and he sees the twelve gates names of the Apostles 12 foundations names of the apostles what is it it's founded not upon men but upon the working of the Holy Spirit that same original doctrine of the word which what is that same original doctrine Christ in you brings us in union with Christ Jesus where hearts have drifted away from the word don't you see why God had to send a message to us to get our hearts turned back in line to where hearts would be turned back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers that's the original foundation jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it well do we need the Apostles we do does God still have apostles he does he does and let me just say this not just those with a ministerial gift but I'm looking at here tonight lives that God has set free and loose from sin and he has sent you as a witness among your own family among your own job mates among your schoolmates one who is sent by God is a witness but there indeed he's the same yesterday today and forever it's a witness of his life in you what he did back there he's the same Jesus today same power same essence same nature I'm glad aren't you I'm glad let's pray Heavenly Father or Jesus there's a reason Lord there's a purpose Lord in everything Lord Jesus you're working in your word uncertain Lord they they worked under that burden in that hour as apostles we know Lord that there were evangelists that were present teachers as a matter of fact we know Lord God that a man can have more than one gift in his life you make that known Paul would say I'm a preacher I'm an apostle and I'm a teacher or Jesus it's you that does the calling the equipping and the sending forth 'lord one of the things that we find and we see here among the early church Lord when I've just looked at it and studied through many of the passages he never find where people were just operating as though independently on a whim or going here going there many times when there was a burden that came it was always brought before the church they would lay hands on pray fast seek the will of God or Jesus we realize the Lord each you're working in your body what you did in that early church you're the same God here this evening Lord you sent you send us a message Lord to call us out of Babylon to call us back to that original life that reality Lord God Lord bringing us back or God to where we're sent on the Apostles doctrine Lord not just to have doctrine and teaching but where's that same life that's working within it's Lord when it's real din our hearts Lord God it's the grace of God Lord it burns in our hearts every one of us Lord that's here Lord God when a life has been touched by you how can you not want to share it with somebody else how can you not want to share it Lord many times we realize it's not just something we just go erratically but God we must be led we must be led by you help us the Lord Jesus that our feet will be yielded to you the places that you would take us help us to wait on you if there's a word to be given help us to be sensitive we see how that you work Lord through the Apostles they're the men of God right there Lord in the early church they went where you send sometimes the Lord as we read about the persecutions they did not leave because it was something that Lord God of would be of a a joyous or a nice but persecution sometimes would cause them to be scattered they would be put in other places but wherever they went they would shine the light Oh God may our lives Lord may it shine that light that light of true Liberty Oh Lord God - where others Lord they would not see us but they see you then Lord it's you that they're attracted to in our lives it's the supernatural working of God not how well Lord that we could put the word together or not whether we know the Hebrew Greek or whatever the words aren't whether we know them or not it's to know you Lord Lord God were very much aware you can preach your word Lord lives themselves can Lord God be drawn the witness Lord how you can speak through many different lives hearts or God even as a mother Lord God among her children God her life being a witness and an expression of the resurrection of Jesus Christ or God as the fifth gospel she's a witness Lord o Lord God or Jesus I think about your prophet would talk about Susanna Wesley how then Lord God she would find time out of her busy day she would read and pray she did not know that out of that family would come a John and Charles Wesley she did not know that was in your hands but God is a parent there was an absolute that was in her life all that you required of her was hold that absolute over your children hold that absolute in your home Oh God granted granted tonight Lord what I pray father help us Lord as your children I'm no Lord tonight we want to join together I know that or God there's many missionaries apostles Lord different ones Lord God that are going out Lord even when Lord this virus has stopped much of the travel between nations but yet within these nations Lord God there's many of these brethren Lord God that go out I think of one of your great soldiers it's went on home to be with you brother Zephaniah Peters Lord God brothers F and I would go out among those in Tanzania they dwelt in caves Lord God they were people Lord all they knew many many heathen traits but God you had some children back there Brothers F&I would be one of many that would be used by you you would have come to hear God as you accompanied these apostles what a comfort it is to our lives you're the same God that accompanies a smart when we go to talk with that loved one we take the token with them so when we pray we present our token in prayer or Jesus if there's one here tonight Lord that doesn't know you that doesn't know you in that reality maybe they're listening by way of internet and that reality has not come into their heart where you've been seated in power and they've been raised in that newness of life Lord by the Holy Ghost Gordon may they not set or if there's one that's here or listening to my voice may they not settle may they realize the Lord it's not enough just to come to this church it's not enough it's not enough just to believe the messy it's not enough it's not enough just to believe and say well I believe that Jesus died for my sins but it's to become one with him it's to become one with him to be united with him in the power of his resurrection god help am i praying it's no doubt Lord God a question might be in their life how can I be made a lord in their heart allowed to be searched if they've not repented may they repent Lord if they've not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may they heat to that those are two things that you cannot do for them they must do but Lord the last one is something that only you can do and that's Lord God to give them the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the real reality Lord that's what their heart would be longing for granite tonight I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

Laureus church without spot wrinkle was in the blood you read there in the book of Acts you find when Barnabas and different ones would come along they would exhort them to continue keep on pressing they would encourage him even to say how you must enter the kingdom of God through much tribulation no doubt they would come among and sure there were people that some had moved on into the life others maybe had just surrendered their heart to God and others here God was moving and senton sent him free the whole encouragement of the word was calling them to fully yield and walk into their full inheritance he kept on proclaiming when Barnabas would come back around and hear the pastor's that they would put there they were proclaiming that Liberty I wonder brother hare and sometimes when Barnabas maybe he'd make that next trip around somebody see Barnabas I've got what she was talking about I got it I got it I've been set completely free see the word it keeps exhorting into that same original message and you know the power of the Holy Spirit working our life they don't leave us even where he finds us once that birth has taken place now it's time to grow it's time to grow and I'm so glad that God he provides of that quickening power to continue to quickness quickness quickness until eventually these atoms are quickened don't you love him say the greatest thing we can do is to believe him to receive what he has said say be it unto me don't try to figure it out just say be it unto me Lord if you've taken one step say lord help me to take the next step help me to take another
